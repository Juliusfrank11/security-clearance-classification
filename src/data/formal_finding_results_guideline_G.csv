"Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  solid  state  technician  who  has  served  in  the  same
capacity  for  over  five  years.  He  first  received  a  security  clearance  in  2016.  He  has
earned an associate’s degree and working toward a bachelor’s degree. He is single and
has no children.  One colleague described him as “confident, a thoughtful guy, he’s [a]
reliable, good worker,” who has not been seen as under the influence of alcohol at work.
(Tr.  20)  Applicant  has  been  imbibing  alcohol  since  he  was  a  teen.  Overall,  his  family
does  not  drink,  although  his  father  and  a  grandfather  have  been  known  to  consume
alcohol on occasions. (Tr. 76)
In  March  2010,  Applicant  was  out  with  co-workers  drinking  “probably  a  beer  an
hour for multiple hours.” (Tr. 40) He got in his car to drive home, then realized he should
not  be  driving.  He  pulled  off  the  road  and  decided  to  “sleep  it  off.”  (Tr.  40)  A  passing
officer woke Applicant and assessed the situation.  Applicant was charged with Driving/
Attempting to Drive Vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (DADV). He was offered
probation before judgment, with six months of probation completed successfully, and he
completed a 12-week alcohol and drug outpatient program.
In April 2012, Applicant was with a group of friends drinking beer on a parking lot
near an apartment building. He was cited with Possession of an alcoholic beverage in
an open container.  Applicant then continued the evening imbibing with his  friends. (Tr.
61)  The  outcome  of  the  citation  was  that  Applicant  was  asked  to  perform  16  hours  of
community service, which he completed successfully. (Tr. 39)
In  September  2015,  Applicant  spent  the  day  socializing  with  friends  at  a  bar.
After a late meal, he left the venue and was stopped by the police for swerving. (Tr. 36)
The officer smelled alcohol and Applicant admitted he had been imbibing. Applicant now
believes  he  had  consumed  six  or  seven  beers.  (Tr.  34)  He  was  given  a  field  sobriety
test, which he passed, then administered a breathalyzer, the results of which were not
disclosed  to  him.  Later,  at  the  station,  he  refused  a  second  breathalyzer.  (Tr.  64)
Ultimately,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  Driving  Vehicle  Under  the  Influence  of
Alcohol (DUI). At a bench trial, the judge found Applicant not guilty, noting that the issue
should  have  been  settled  when  he  passed  the  field  sobriety  test.  Today,  Applicant
maintains  his  innocence  in  the  matter,  but  agrees  “it  was  unwise  for  [him]  to  put
[himself] in that position. If [he] hadn’t been drinking all that day, [he] would have never
raised the officer’s suspicion. And it was just not a smart move to even put [himself] at a
vulnerable state like that.”  (Tr. 35)
In  mid-January  2018,  Applicant  spent  the  day  at  a  bar  for  a  going-away  party.
(Tr.  68)  He  got  a  ride  to  his  grandmother’s  house,  but  later  decided  to  retrieve  his
automobile from the bar. After a field sobriety test, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  Driving  While  Impaired  by  Alcohol  (DWIA).  He  was  pulled  over  for  a  headlight
issue,  and  the  officer  suspected  he  was  under  the  influence.  Looking  back  at  the
incident,  he  now  recognizes  that  he  was  intoxicated  at  the  time.  (Tr.  29-30)  In  court,
Applicant was found guilty, sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended 60 days, and placed
on probation until late 2019.  He became subject to an interlock system on his vehicle.
(Tr.  72)  His  probation  was  terminated  early,  in  December  2018,  on  petition  after  he
finished  all  other  court-ordered  requirements.  (Tr.  31)  He  was  initially  advised  by  an
attorney to cease using alcohol, then ordered to stop drinking by the court as part of his
probation. As of May 2018, he had not committed to remaining sober. (Tr. 73) As of the
time of the hearing, however, he feels committed to remaining sober. (Tr. 74)
Although he has does not follow the program’s steps, has no sponsor, and does
not subscribe to the program’s religious underpinnings, Applicant has attended over 140
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, which he still attends. (Tr. 74-75, 79; Ex. M) He
attended a one weekend inpatient program, finished 26 weeks of aftercare counseling,
and completed a 16-hour on-line drug and alcohol education course. (see Ex. C, Ex. M,
and Ex. N; Tr. 42) There, it was determined he had a “moderate drinking problem that . .
. [had the] potential to be way worse if [he did not] get it in check.” (Tr. 42) Elsewhere,
he was noted as a “moderate to high-risk” drinker. (Tr. 43) Applicant described his past
pattern of drinking as being “more consistent with binge drinking.” (Tr. 56)
This experience and subsequent rehabilitation have changed Applicant’s attitude
toward alcohol abuse, and it is his intent to endeavor to remain sober and not return to
alcohol  “for  the  foreseeable  future.”  (Tr.  77)  He  no  longer  needs  alcohol  to  have  fun,
and  he  recognizes  that  it  adversely  affects  his  judgment.  Alcohol-free,  he  is  enjoying
new  hobbies,  outdoor  activities,  and  working  on  more  fulfilling  relationships.  He  is
currently dating, but not cohabitating with, a woman who infrequently drinks alcohol. (Tr.
51,  89)  She  is  a  caring  individual  who  supports  his  sobriety  and  acknowledges  that
alcohol  was  adversely  affecting  Applicant’s  life.  (Tr.  88)  She  encouraged  him  to  make
changes in his life regarding alcohol. (Tr. 88) When they do move in together, they will
most likely keep alcohol in the home. (Tr. 51) Applicant stays away from all-day sports
viewing  in  bars  with  his  friends.  (Tr.  77)  He  is  contrite  concerning  his  past  alcohol
abuse. (Tr. 53-54)
",True
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 2.a,
and 2.b. (HE 3) He denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating and
mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  avionics  equipment  specialist  working  for  a  defense
contractor for the past two years. (Tr. 7, 9; GE 1) In 2003, he graduated from high school,
and he completed three years of college. (Tr. 7-8) He served in the Air Force from 2004
to 2008. (Tr. 8) When he was discharged from the Air Force, he was a senior airman, and
he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 8) His Air Force specialty was nuclear cruise
missile maintenance technician. (Tr. 9) For most of his Air Force service, he had a top
secret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI). (Tr. 9) He
was married from 2006 to 2012, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 8)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that from about 2003 until at least October 2014, Applicant used
marijuana with varying frequency. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that from about March 2005 until
June  2008,  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  while  holding  a  security
clearance. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that from about  March 2012 until at least October 2014,
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency while employed in a position of public
trust.  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c  explaining  that  his  marijuana  use  was
limited to June and July 2014. (HE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that from about June 2014 to July 2014, Applicant purchased
marijuana with varying frequency. SOR ¶ 1.e alleges that in about May 2014, Applicant
was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  and  possession  of
marijuana while operating a motor vehicle. (GE 8 at 1) In May 2014, Applicant had a drink
of alcohol before he started driving home. (Tr. 24) A police officer said he crossed the
center line. (Tr. 24) He also had an open container of alcohol in his vehicle. (Tr. 24) The
police officer searched Applicant and found marijuana in his possession. (Tr. 24; GE 1 at
33) He also had a small glass marijuana pipe in his vehicle. (Tr. 25) He was not charged
with an alcohol offense. When he went to court, he received deferred adjudication for one
year,  and  his  record  was  expunged  after  one  year.  (GE  1)  Applicant  said  he  used
marijuana  three  or four  times  in  May  2014.  (Tr.  23,  25-26)  He  insisted  he  did  not  use
marijuana before May 2014. (Tr. 26) He clarified that he used marijuana 10 to 15 times
or  once  or  twice  a  week  from  May  through  July  2014.  (Tr.  35)  He  held  a  public  trust
position when he possessed marijuana. (GE 1 at 33)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  that  in  about  October  2014,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  by  a
licensed addiction  counselor (LAC)  with  a  condition  called  Cannabis  Abuse. The  court
adjudicating  Applicant’s  July  2014  arrest  required  him  to  undergo  a  substance-abuse
evaluation. (Tr. 30) On October 9, 2014, an LAC interviewed Applicant. (Tr. 30) According
to the LAC’s report (also dated October 9, 2014), Applicant told the evaluator:
[Applicant] reports first drinking at age 17 and smoked pot for the first time
at age 18. States he got intoxicated for the first time at age 17 and has been
a regular user since age 18. States he drank three times and smoked pot
once in the last 30 days. States pot is his drug of choice, a bowl once or
twice a day . . . . States the last time he drank was 10-04-14, last time he
smoked pot was about a week and a half ago . . . . States he spends $50.00
to $100.00 a month on using . . . . States . . . pot relaxes him. Denies being
preoccupied  with  the  thought  of using.  [Applicant]  states  his using isn’t  a
problem . . . . States he has four close friends and they all use . . . . States
his mother and father are chemically dependent, they live in [a state where
marijuana] is legal. (GE 5)
The  LAC  indicated  in  Axis  I:  305.20  (Cannabis  Abuse);  and  305.00  (Alcohol
Abuse). (GE 5) The LAC concluded Applicant was “not chemically dependent,” and he
should receive a 16-hour education program. (GE 5)
Applicant  strenuously  disputes  the  LAC’s  description  of  his  marijuana  use;
however, he did not give a reason the evaluator would intentionally lie about the duration
and frequency of Applicant’s marijuana use. (Tr. 33) Applicant suggested the evaluator
“got [his] notes mixed up.” (Tr. 33) He said the LAC may have confused his description of
his alcohol use with his description of his marijuana use. (Tr. 37) Applicant called the LAC
and confronted him with his concerns about the accuracy of his notes. (Tr. 33) Applicant
said  the  LAC  mentioned  his  inability  to  remember  what  Applicant  said  during  the
interview;  however,  the  LAC  refused  to  disavow  the  accuracy  of  his  notes.  (Tr.  33)
Applicant provided a letter from the LAC dated March 28, 2019, which states as follows:
[Applicant]  called  me  on  03-19-19,  concerning  the  alcohol  and  drug
evaluation I did on him on 10-09-14. He was questioning the information in
the evaluation of when he first used marijuana. At the time of the evaluation
he reported first using at age 18. He went on stating in the report that he
used pot in the thirty days prior to 10-09-14, but during the call he assured
me that he didn’t use before 2014. When talking to [Applicant] on 03-19-19,
he  said  he  didn’t  know  if  he  reported  that  information  inaccurately  or  if  I
made a mistake in my documentation. I have no way of knowing if this is
accurate other than looking at the information I received at the time of the
evaluation. If he feels this is inaccurate, I have no other recommendation
for him other than to get another evaluation. (AE C)
Applicant said that he could not have used marijuana when he was on active duty
in the Air Force and held a TS/SCI-level clearance because of the frequency of the Air
Force’s urinalysis testing of those holding TS/SCI-level clearances with access to nuclear
materials. (Tr. 40) He insisted the LAC’s notes were not accurate. (Tr. 40-41)
There is no evidence Applicant tested positive on a urinalysis test for use of illegal
drugs. Applicant denied that he currently possesses any marijuana or drug paraphernalia.
(Tr. 38) He has friends  that  use marijuana; however, they  do  not use marijuana  in  his
presence. (Tr. 39)
Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in  about July 2014, and charged
with  operating  a  vehicle  while  intoxicated.  Applicant  was  sad  or  depressed  about  his
situation after his marijuana-related arrest in May 2014, and he made a bad decision to
drink excessive amounts of alcohol. (Tr. 26-27) In July 2014, he drank eight or nine beers
over a six-hour period. (Tr. 39) The police stopped Applicant’s vehicle for improper lane
change and asked him if he drank any alcohol that day. (Tr. 26, 39; GE 3; GE 6) Applicant
denied that he drank any alcohol to the police officer because he did not want to go to
jail. (Tr. 39; GE 6) Applicant subsequently told the police officer that he only had two or
three drinks. (Tr. 39; GE 6) The preliminary blood alcohol test indicated .129 BAC. (GE 6
at 2) A police officer found an open container of beer in Applicant’s vehicle. (GE 6 at 1)
Upon arrival at jail, the police found marijuana on Applicant’s person. (GE 6 at 1-2) Two
breath tests were administered at the jail with results of .10 and .11 BACs. (GE 6 at 2)
Applicant was not charged with possession of the marijuana found on his person
in July 2014. (GE 3) Applicant pleaded guilty to operating while impaired (OWI), and he
was  sentenced  to  six  months  of  probation,  to  pay  a  fine,  to  have  a  substance-abuse
assessment, and to complete a 16-hour alcohol-treatment class. (GE 1 at 34; GE 6; GE
7) Applicant did not inform his supervisor or security officer of his arrests in May and July
2014. (Tr. 28) He said he did not inform the government of his arrests because of “fear of
losing  my  job.”  (GE  4  at  18)  About  a  year  after  his  second  arrest,  the  government
conducted a  background  check of  contractor  employees  because of  a  security  breach
unrelated to Applicant’s conduct, and his employer discovered his two arrests in 2014.
(Tr. 29) Applicant’s contractor employer fired him. (Tr. 29)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant was diagnosed by an LAC with a condition called
Alcohol Abuse. Applicant consumed alcohol since the age of 17. (Tr. 36) In 2014, he was
drinking alcohol four or five times a week. (Tr. 36)
In Applicant’s September 17, 2018 response to DOHA interrogatories, he said he
consumed two to three drinks, two to three times a month. (GE 4 at 19) The most recent
time he was intoxicated was on September 15, 2018. (GE 4 at 20) Applicant stated at his
hearing that he has dramatically reduced his alcohol consumption to about once every
two months. (Tr. 37) There is no evidence of alcohol-related incidents involving the police
or the courts after July 2014.
Personal Conduct
The  SOR  cross-alleges  in  ¶  3.a  the  same  conduct  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through 1.e above. The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts as follows:
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges Applicant stated that on or about July 5, 2016, he completed an
SCA which asked in Section 23 about whether he used any controlled substance in the
previous seven years. Applicant responded, yes, and said “I had never smoked marijuana
before June 2014. I was introduced to it during a rough period in my life. I only smoked it
a handful of times, and stopped all together in July of 2014.” (GE 1 at 32) He said he
“[e]xperimented  with  it,  only  smoked  10-15  times  between the  beginning  of  June  2014
and the end of July 2014.” (Id.) After his arrests for possession of marijuana and OWI, he
said he “decided it was time to get my life back on track. I was forced to resign my position
due to the charge. My experimental use of marijuana did damage to my life as a whole,
and I will never use it again.” (Id.)
SOR ¶ 3.c alleges Applicant stated that on or about October 19, 2017, during an
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  personal  subject  interview  (PSI),  he  used
marijuana 10 to 15 times between June and July 2014. (GE 3 at 4) He specifically denied
any marijuana use prior to June 2014. (GE 3 at 4) He said he purchased marijuana once,
and the other times he received marijuana without purchasing it. (GE 3 at 4-5)
SOR  ¶  3.d  alleges  Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  on  or  about
September 17, 2018, and he denied that he used marijuana except for 10 to 15 times
between June and July 2014. (GE 4) He said in his DOHA interrogatories that from April
2014 to July 2014, he used marijuana two to four times a week. (GE 4 at 9) He also said
he “bought small amounts of marijuana for personal use from April 2014  – July 2014.”
(GE 4 at 9) He concluded, “I only started smoking marijuana well after I was divorced. I
smoked a handful of times over a few month period in 2014. I stopped because marijuana
was not the way to deal with my problems.” (GE 4 at 11)
Applicant failed to disclose or admit the full duration and frequency of his marijuana
use  as  indicated  in  the  October  9,  2014  substance-abuse  evaluation  in  the  drug
involvement and substance misuse section of this decision, supra. Applicant told the LAC
on October 9, 2014, he used marijuana “once in the last 30 days” or about 10 days before
his interview. (GE 5)
Character Evidence
Six coworkers, colleagues, and/or friends as well as his former spouse provided
character  statements  supporting  reinstatement  of  Applicant’s  access  to  classified
information. (AE B; AE D-I) His character evidence includes statements from persons who
are  honorably  retired  after  many  years  of  military  service,  senior  noncommissioned
officers on active duty, and highly trained technicians and managers. The general sense
of  their  statements  is  that  Applicant  is  diligent,  knowledgeable,  intelligent,  meticulous,
professional, generous, loyal, honest, a good leader, and trustworthy. (AE B; AE D-I) His
hard  work  and  professionalism  made  substantial  contributions
to  mission
accomplishment. (AE B; AE D-I) None of his character statements described any abuse
of  alcohol  or use  of  illegal  drugs  by  Applicant.  (AE  B-AE  D-I)  There  is  no  evidence  of
security  violations,  improper  disclosure  of  classified  information,  or  that  Applicant
compromised national security.
",False
"Under Guideline G, the Government alleged that Applicant consumed alcohol, at
times  to  excess,  from  the  time  he  was  a  teenager  until  at  least  2016,  and  that  he  still
consumes alcohol (SOR 1.a). It was further alleged that between 2006 and 2013, he was
arrested on six occasions for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and other charges incidental
to his DWI arrests (SOR 1.b – 1.g).
Under Guideline J, the Government alleged that between June 2001 and August
2012, Applicant was cited, charged, or arrested 11 times for various moving violations,
failure to appear in court, and driving on a suspended license (SOR 2.a – 2.k); and that
in March 2018, Applicant was cited for speeding, to which he pleaded nolo contendere
(SOR 2.l). Additionally, the DWI arrests alleged at SOR 1.b – 1.g were cross-alleged as
criminal conduct (SOR 2.m).
Under Guideline E, the allegations at SOR 1.a – 1.g (SOR 3.a) and at SOR 2.a –
2.m (SOR 3.b) were cross-alleged as adverse personal conduct (SOR 2.m). Additionally,
it was alleged that Applicant falsified his answer to the first question in e-QIP Section 24
(Alcohol  Use)  by  listing  a  DWI  arrest  in  January  2007  but  failing  to  list  all  of  the  DWI
arrests delineated in SOR 1.b – 1.g (SOR 3.c).
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  3.c,  but  admitted  all  of  the
remaining SOR allegations. He also provided an attached statement in which, inter alia,
he  explained  his  denial  of  SOR  3.c.  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old and employed as a software engineer for a large defense
contractor.  He  grew  up  in  State  A,  where  he  earned  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in
computer science and mathematics in May 2016. In June 2017, Applicant was hired by
his current employer while completing graduate studies and working on a dissertation for
his Master of Science degree in computer science. He became a full-time employee the
day  he  received  his  Master’s  degree  in  December  2017.  Applicant  established  an
excellent  academic  record  in  college,  graduating  magna  cum  laude.  As  a  graduate
student, he compiled a 3.75 GPA. In June 2017, Applicant moved from State A to State
B, his current residence, to accept the defense contractor position he now holds. During
the summer of 2014, Applicant held a security clearance required for his internship with
a federal agency. (GX 1; GX 2; AX B; Tr. 7, 9, 48).
As alleged in SOR 1.a, Applicant began consuming alcohol, at times to excess, as
a  teenager.  Between  high  school  and  July  2013,  his  use  of  alcohol  resulted  in  the
convictions for DWI and related charges delineated in SOR 1.b – 1.g. Applicant last used
alcohol  to  excess  in  June  2016,  but  he  still  consumes  alcohol  in  moderation  in  social
settings.  He  never  has  been  diagnosed  with  any  alcohol  use  disorder,  such  as  being
alcohol dependent. His DWI sentences have not resulted in more than a few days in jail
awaiting  initial  court  appearances,  and  he  has  completed  court-ordered  alcohol  safety
awareness  classes  on  multiple  occasions.  Those  classes  included  evaluations  of  his
alcohol use and did not result in any clinical diagnoses. (Answer; GX 1 – 5; Tr. 32 – 41,
52 – 55)
As  alleged  at  SOR  2.a  –  2.l,  Appellant  committed  numerous  traffic  violations,
ranging from simple speeding to reckless driving between 2001 and 2018. He also was
cited  for  various  technical  infractions,  such  as  improper  insurance,  and  defective
equipment and devices. On four occasions, Appellant was charged with failure to appear
in response to traffic citations. On four other occasions, he also was charged with driving
on an expired or suspended driver’s license. Applicant did not commit any such violations
between 2012 and March 2018, when he pleaded nolo contendere to driving 55 mph in a
45 mph zone in State B. That most recent traffic violation occurred in State B, six years
after his last violation in State A. Although all of the SOR 2.a  – 2.l allegations involved
violations of law, none of them resulted in arrest as alleged. Only the allegation at SOR
2.m,  which  cross-alleged  the  DWIs  addressed  in  SOR  1.b  –  1.g  involved  conduct  for
which  Applicant  faced  possible  incarceration.  In  early  2017,  when  Applicant  was  first
being considered for his current job, he did not own a car or hold a valid driver’s license
because of his many traffic violations before 2012. To have his State A driving privileges
restored,  Applicant  researched  and  satisfied  all  outstanding  requirements  in  State  A
before moving to State B. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 4 – 6; Tr. 36, 47 – 48)
Applicant denied that he intended to falsify his answers to e-QIP Section 24 (Use
of Alcohol) questions by omitting adverse information about his DWIs. When he submitted
his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed as required by Section 22 (Police Record) nearly all of the
non-DWI traffic offenses  that occurred in the seven years preceding the e-QIP. In that
same section, Applicant also listed the DWI offenses alleged at SOR 1.f and 1.g. At e-
QIP Section 24, he stated that alcohol had a negative impact in the previous seven years
due to multiple DWIs between 2007 and 2013. The only DWI he did not disclose was the
oldest offense from December 2006. Applicant claimed that, at most, he misunderstood
what was required in Section 24. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 25, 27, 41 – 42)
Applicant was candid and forthright in his testimony.  In response to the adverse
information  presented  by  the  Government,  Applicant  admitted  the  accuracy  of  the
allegations. He also acknowledged that before his last DWI arrest in 2013, he behaved
irresponsibly by drinking too much and generally disregarding rules and regulations about
driving and other societal norms. He had matriculated at a state university in the fall of
2002 but left after a semester. By contrast, Applicant described two events in 2013 as a
turning point in his life. Although he re-enrolled in college in the spring of 2013, his risky
lifestyle and poor choices continued. But the day he was released from jail after his May
2013  DWI  arrest,  he  learned  his  infant  cousin  had  died  suddenly.  A  few  months  later,
when Applicant was arrested for his last DWI, he had been drinking at a party celebrating
his  great  grandmother’s  100th  birthday.  She  died  soon  after  and  Applicant  claims  he
realized he had to change his life for the better. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 26 – 29)
After  July  2013,  Applicant’s  alcohol  use  declined  markedly  and  he  was  last
intoxicated in June 2016. Applicant has not driven after having anything to drink since his
July 2013 arrest, but he admits that before then he drove drunk on a number of occasions
without  being  stopped.  Applicant  still  consumes  alcohol,  albeit,  on  infrequent  social
occasions  and  only  in  moderation.  He  also  avers  that  he  leads  a  more  active  lifestyle
characterized by physical fitness activities, and that his job and his volunteer work are not
conducive  to  a  lifestyle  that  includes  more  than  moderate  and  responsible  drinking.
(Answer; GX 2; Tr. 29 – 35, 38 – 41)
After re-enrolling in college, Applicant established a superior academic record and
graduated  on  time  with  a  3.5  cumulative  GPA.  He  compiled  a  3.75  GPA  for  his  post-
graduate degree. During his undergraduate career, Applicant’s academic record qualified
him as an ambassador in the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and
Universities  (HBCU).  Currently,  he  is  a  member  of  the  National  Black  Engineers
Association and volunteers as a mentor to middle and high school students in State B. In
the workplace, Applicant has earned more than ten awards for his technical expertise and
teamwork. He  also  logs  significant  hours of his own  time  through company-sponsored
volunteer programs. He has a reputation for integrity, reliability, and professionalism. After
initially  being  granted  interim  access  to  classified  information,  Applicant  demonstrated
that he was able and willing to protect such information. (AX A – E; Tr. 32, 42 – 47)

"Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She is a high school
graduate. She has never been married and has no children. She has been working for
her  current  employer  and  security  sponsor  since  October  2002.  She  is  a  level  three
(senior)  research  assistant.  In  2003,  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
granted Applicant eligibility for a position of trust, and she has held it to present.
In her responses to Sections 22 (Police Record) and 24 (Use of Alcohol) of her
2017  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  a  history  of  alcohol-related  offenses.  The  background
investigation provided additional details about the security concerns alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  Guideline  G  allegations  with  some  clarifications
(SOR 1.a – 1.g), and denied all of the Guideline J allegations (SOR 2.a – 2.d). Her SOR
admissions, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
1. In 2006, Applicant was charged with drinking an alcoholic beverage in  a retail
area and second degree assault. Both charges were nolle prosequi. (SOR 1.a; GE 3).
2.  In  February  2008,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  while  impaired  by
alcohol,  assault  second  degree,  disorderly  conduct, and failure to obey  a  lawful order.
She pleaded guilty to the charge of driving while impaired by alcohol, and was adjudged
probation  before  judgment.  The  probation  was  extended  until  December  2009.  (SOR
1.b;  GE  4.a,  4.b,  and  4.c)  She  was  required  to  remain  abstinent  during  the  probation
period. She successfully complete her probation.
3. Between April and May 2008, Applicant received alcohol-related counseling (a
six week, 12 hour education program) and was diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder -
mild. (SOR 1.c; GE 11)
4. In January 2011, Applicant was arrested for driving while impaired by alcohol,
and she pleaded guilty to the offense. She was placed on supervised probation. (SOR
1.d; GE 5)
5.  Between  March  and  October  2011,  Applicant  received  alcohol-related
counseling  (a  26-week  treatment  program)  and  was  diagnosed  with  an  alcohol  use
disorder  -  severe.  She  was  required  to  remain  abstinent  during  the  probation  period.
(SOR 1.e; GE 11)
6.  In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  driving  while  impaired  by  alcohol.
She  was  found  guilty  of  the  offense  in  February  2015, and  was  sentenced to  60  days
confinement  (58  days  suspended),  placed  on  a  weekender’s  work  program,  and  on
supervised probation and parole. (SOR 1.f; GE 6.a - 6.c)
7. Between August and September 2014, Applicant successfully participated in a
28-day residential recovery and treatment program. In December 2015, she completed
the subsequent 48-week aftercare group counseling program. (GE 12)
8.  In  April  2017,  Applicant  was  arrested  for driving  while  under  the  influence  of
alcohol.  She  was  found  guilty  of  the  offense  in  February  2018,  and  was  sentenced  to
one-year  of  supervised  probation.  She  was  also  charged  with  failure  to  display  her
driver’s license, failure to drive in right half, failure to stop at a stop sign, failure to drive
to curb upon signal by police, and taking a left turn from improper position. All of these
related  traffic  offenses  were  placed  on  a  STET  (inactive)  docket  following  Applicant’s
guilty plea to DUI. (SOR 1.g; GE 7.a, 7.b)
9.  In  June  2017,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  a  vehicle  not
equipped  with  an  ignition  interlock.  She  pleaded  not  guilty,  and  the  charge  was  later
nolle prosequi. She also was charged with driving on a suspended license. She pleaded
guilty and was found guilty of the charge in January 2018. She was sentenced to one-
year of confinement (suspended for 30 days). She appealed the sentence to the Circuit
Court,  apparently  requesting  a  consolidation  of  other  pending  traffic  offenses.  The
Circuit  Court  considered  the  appeal  and  entered  its  verdict  in  March  2018.  Applicant
was sentenced to two-years of supervised probation with conditions, and a $1,000 fine,
suspended. (GE 8, 10)
10. In September 2017, Applicant was charged with failure to display her driver’s
license to a police officer, driving on a suspended license, and driving without a license.
All  charges  were  nolle  prosequi,  apparently,  as  a  result  of  a  consolidation  of  traffic
offenses and plea agreement concerning the offenses and court proceedings discussed
in paragraph 9, above. (GE 8, 9, and 10)
11.  In  April  2018,  Applicant  was  admitted  to  an  outpatient  recovery  center  and
treatment  program  sponsored  by  the  state.  During  the  rehabilitation  phase,  she
attended three-hour meetings, three times a week, for a total of 20-30 sessions over a
period of two months. During the continued care phase, she attended 75 group therapy
sessions, once a week, in addition to Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) meetings. There is no
evidence of her return to alcohol use during the treatment program, as evidenced by her
negative drug and alcohol screens, the last one taken in November 2019. Applicant was
diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, moderate-severe. She is considered to have made
excellent progress while in the treatment program. Her prognosis for continued sobriety
is  considered  to  be  good  with  her  continued  investment  in  community  meetings  and
utilizing a sober support network. (See GE 13, AE 1, and AE 2)
Under  Guideline  J,  the  SOR  cross-alleged  the  alcohol-related  offenses  alleged
under Guideline G (SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g). For the sake of brevity, my findings
of facts related to all of the offenses alleged under Guideline G, above, are incorporated
into my findings under Guideline J.
SOR  2.b  alleged  that  in  June  2017,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
changing  lanes  where  prohibited,  driving  a  vehicle  not  equipped  with  an  ignition
interlock,  and  driving  on  suspended  license.  The  allegation  of  “changing  lanes  where
prohibited”  is  not  established  by  the  documentary  evidence.  The  other  two  traffic
offenses are established by the evidence and are discussed above in paragraph 8.
SOR  2.c  alleged  that  in  September  2017,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged
with  failure  to  display  her  driver’s  license  to  a  police  officer,  driving  on  a  suspended
license,  and  driving  without  a  license. These  charges  are  established  by  the  evidence
and discussed in paragraph 10, above.
SOR 2.d alleged that in January 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with
driving  a  vehicle  not  equipped  with  an  ignition  interlock  and  driving  on  suspended
license. These two traffic offenses did not occur in January 2018. As discussed above in
paragraphs 9 and 10, these offenses occurred in June 2017. The court adjudicated the
offenses in January – March 2018. (GE 8, 9, 10)
At hearing, Applicant presented the testimony of two witnesses “WM” and “WA”.
WM is Applicant’s onsite program manager at the federal facility where she works. WM
has supervised Applicant since 2003. WM testified that through the years, Applicant has
been instrumental in doing all the purchasing, preparation, and setting up the facilities to
accomplish their mission. Applicant is also in charge of training all of the new lower-level
research assistants. She described Applicant's work as intricate, and requiring planning,
dedication, attention to detail, and reliability.
In 17 years, WM never had any trouble with Applicant showing up to work late or
not doing her job. She is liked by the staff and their customers. There has never been
any alcohol-related incidents at work.
Applicant was candid with WM and disclosed her alcohol-related problems. WM
was  surprised  about  Applicant’s  alcohol  problems  because  there  was  no  indication  in
her  work  performance  that  she  was  having  any  problems.  Applicant  always  comes  to
work on time, gets along well with coworkers and clients. WM would like Applicant to get
her  clearance  and  to  come  back  to  work.  She  believes  it  would  be  detrimental  to  her
department  and  the  research  mission  if  Applicant  was  removed  from  her  position.  (Tr.
68-69)
WA has been  Applicant’s  direct  supervisor  since  2006. They  have  daily  contact
and interact with each other several times a day. She described Applicant as “one of my
most  important  employees  because  she  knows  everything  and  does  everything.”  WA
considers Applicant to be an extremely reliable and responsible person, not only within
the work environment, but also when taking care of her team members and her family.
WA considers Applicant to be and essential member of the team.
Applicant  has  oversight  of  logistics,  training,  equipment  (purchasing  and
maintenance),  and  the  trouble  shooting  of  unexpected  problems.  She  is  a  reliable
custodian of controlled substances. Applicant disclosed her alcohol-related problems to
WA  when  she  was  incarcerated  as  a  result  of  one  of  her  DWI  convictions.  WA  has
frequently followed up with Applicant about her attendance to meetings and participating
in the therapy program.
Additionally,  Applicant  presented  three  favorable  reference  statements  from
colleagues  and  friends.  The  references  consider  Applicant  to  be  highly  skilled,
knowledgeable, conscientious, ethical, dedicated to the mission, extremely dependable,
reliable, and punctual. Applicant displays a high level of attention to detail regarding her
duties. She is considered to be one of the top research assistants, and the go-to person
for  mentoring  new  staff.  All  of  the  references  endorsed  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a
clearance without reservations.
Applicant  credibly  expressed  remorse  for  her  alcohol-related  misconduct.  She
understands that she needs help to control her alcohol consumption. She has learned a
hard lesson and promised to be responsible in the future.
Applicant  testified  that  she  has  been  abstinent  since  May  2017.  She  is  grateful
for the intensive treatment she received at the outpatient recovery center and treatment
program  sponsored  by  the  state  between  2018  and  November  2019.  She  was  given
medications  and  intensive  therapy  to  develop  the  tools  needed  to  stop  consuming
alcohol.  She  believes  that  the  treatment  she  received  at  prior counseling-rehabilitation
facilities  was  superficial,  requiring  only  for  her  to  show  up,  and  did  not  assist  her  with
her  alcohol  problems.  She  attributed  her  alcohol  problems  to  a  coping  mechanism  to
deal with the loss of family members, and her emotional and financial problems.
Applicant has made lifestyle changes to stop her from consuming alcohol. She is
now  living  with  her  family.  Her  family  provides  the  emotional  support  she  needs  to
remain  abstinent.  She  believes  that  she  has  been  working  very  hard  in  her  recovery.
She  is  committed  to  remaining  sober,  being  healthy,  and  helping  others  with  similar
problems.  She  is  concerned  about  not  getting  her  clearance,  losing  her  job,  and  not
being  able to provide  financial  support for her elderly  parents and  siblings.  (Tr. 61-62)
Applicant noted that her past alcohol consumption caused financial problems that led to
her  losing  her  house  in  a  foreclosure.  Applicant’s  family  depends  on  her  income  and
she does not want to fail or let her family down.

"Applicant, age 36, is divorced with one minor child. The record did not specify when
he received his high school diploma. He attended a university specializing in aviation and
aerospace on a part-time basis from March 2015 through May 2016, without earning a
degree. As of May 2019, he was pursuing a degree in electrical engineering technology.
He served on active duty as an aerographer in the U.S. Navy from February 2008 until
February 2017, when he received a general discharge due to misconduct. At the time of
his  discharge,  he  was  a  first  class  petty  officer  (AG1).  Since  April  2017,  he  has  been
employed as a civilian contractor working as an administrative assistant supporting a U.S.
Navy human resources and administrative support contract. He has maintained a DOD
security clearance since 2008. (Item 3; Item 4 at 4, 5, 8-9, 19, 45; Item 5)
Under Guideline G, the SOR alleged four incidents involving Applicant’s excessive
alcohol consumption between 2004 and 2016 including: two driving under the influence
(DUI) convictions (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d), and two other alcohol-related incidents, one at
work  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  and  one  away  from  work  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  It  also  alleged  that  he  was
diagnosed  with  a  severe  alcohol-use  disorder  (SOR  ¶  1.e)  and  that  he  continues  to
consume alcohol after a treatment recommendation to abstain (SOR ¶ 1.f). In his SOR
answer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.f. (Items 1, 2)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana, with varying
frequency, from 2001 through 2016 (SOR ¶ 2.a), including after having been granted a
security clearance (SOR ¶ 2.b). It also alleged that he was diagnosed with a  cannabis
use disorder (SOR ¶ 2.c). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in SOR
¶¶ 2.a. – 2.c. However, he reported a period of abstinence from marijuana from 2008 until
2016. (Items 1, 2)
Guideline G
In 2004, Applicant consumed three to four rum-and-coke mixed drinks during an
unspecified period of time while at a club with friends. While he was driving home, a police
officer stopped  him for  an  unknown  reason. After failing  a field  sobriety  test,  Applicant
was arrested and charged with DUI, and spent 24 hours in jail. He was later convicted of
DUI and sentenced to 40 hours in jail, including the 24 hours he already served and 16
hours he served during weekends. He also paid a $300 fine. (Item 2 at 1; Item 4 at 16-
17)
In  2009,  while  on active  duty  with  the  U.S. Navy,  Applicant  consumed 10 to  12
beers one day between 2:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. while at a barbeque with friends. The
following morning, he overslept and missed a mandatory briefing at work. A co-worker
came to his residence to wake him up and bring him to work. Once Applicant arrived at
work, his supervisor smelled alcohol emanating from him. He was verbally reprimanded
and  sent  to  a  10-day  outpatient  alcohol  treatment  program,  which  he  successfully
completed. (Item 3 at 42; Item 4 at 10)
In 2011, while on active duty with the U.S. Navy but on extended leave for training,
Applicant consumed an excessive amount of alcohol during an unspecified period of time
while at a house party with friends. At one point, he was asked to leave the party because
he  got  into  a  verbal  altercation  due  to  being  too  drunk  and  acting  out,  too  loud,  and
inappropriate  towards  female  guests  at  the  party.  He  left  that  house  and  walked  to  a
friend’s house nearby. Because his friend did not respond to his repeated knocking, he
lost his temper and kicked the sliding glass door causing it to break. Shortly thereafter,
he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  public  swearing  and  intoxication  (Charge  1)  and
destruction of property (Charge 2), and spent one night in jail. After his arrest, he learned
that he had been at the wrong house, which belonged to a stranger and not his friend.
Charge 2 was nolle prossed. Charge 1 was dismissed after he paid $800 in restitution.
His  command  ordered  him  to  undergo  a  30-day  inpatient  alcohol  treatment  program,
which he successfully completed. (Item 3 at 36-37, 42-43; Item 4 at 14, 23; Items 6, 8)
In February 2016, while on active duty with the U.S. Navy, Applicant consumed six
vodka shots and six beers while at dinner with a friend over an unspecified period of time.
After dinner, he drove the friend to a club, which was closed when they arrived. He then
drove them to a nearby park to wait for the club to open. They fell asleep while waiting.
Applicant, who was behind the wheel, was awoken by a police officer just before midnight.
After failing a field sobriety test and having a blood alcohol content over the legal limit,
Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, and spent the night in jail. In October 2016,
after pleading not guilty, he was convicted of DUI and sentenced to  90 days in jail (85
days suspended), which he served on the weekends. His driver’s license was restricted
for one year, and he was ordered to install an interlock ignition device on his vehicle for
six months. He also paid a $250 fine. (Item 3 at 37-39, 42; Item 4 at 15-16; Item 7)
Applicant did not notify his command of his 2016 DUI for fear that he would get
into trouble. He was hoping that he could handle the matter on his own. However, his
command discovered the 2016 DUI during an internal background investigation that was
being  conducted  for  Applicant’s  potential  promotion.  In  October  2016,  Applicant  was
charged with violating Article 92 (failure to obey any order or regulation) for which he was
imposed the following non-judicial punishment: removal of recommendation for promotion
to E-7, reduction in rank to E-5 (suspended), and forfeiture of one-half month’s pay times
two (suspended). (Item 3 at 24; Item 4 at 9, 11-13)
In November 2016, after a command-ordered alcohol evaluation stemming from
his 2016 DUI, Applicant was admitted to a 35-day substance abuse rehabilitation program
(SARP) for the treatment of alcohol dependence. He was diagnosed with severe alcohol
use  disorder.  After  Applicant  was  notified  that  he  tested  positive  for  marijuana  during
intake,  he  disclosed  a  pattern  of  regular  marijuana  use  for  several  months  prior  to  his
admission to SARP. He was then also diagnosed with mild cannabis use disorder. Upon
his successful completion of SARP, he was discharged in December 2016. At discharge,
the initial two diagnoses remained unchanged, and the recommendations of his SARP
treatment  team  included  “Patient  remains  advised  to  abstain  from  all  alcohol  and  any
other  substance  use.”  These  recommendations  were  in  addition  to  the  terms  of  the
aftercare plan discussed below. Throughout his SARP treatment, Applicant was a very
active participant. As further validation of the improvement and work he achieved while
at SARP, he was selected by his peers and treatment team to be the student-speaker at
the commencement ceremony. (Item 2 at 2, 3; Item 3 at 43-44; Item 4 at 4, 11-12, 15, 22;
Item 9 at 3, 5, 6, 7, 9)
Following  his  discharge from  SARP  in  December  2016,  Applicant was  removed
from regular duty and required to engage in a continuing care program with a command-
approved aftercare plan (formulated with input from Applicant and his  SARP treatment
team)  over  the  following  12  months.  His  aftercare  plan  included  abstention  from  the
consumption of alcohol and  drugs,  participation  in  one  to  three  Alcoholics  Anonymous
(AA)  meetings  per  week,  participation  in  bi-weekly  outpatient  group  sessions,
participation in the Navy MORE program (a web-based tool to assist with personal growth
and  abstinence  during  the  first  year  of  recovery),  and  random  and  periodic  urinalysis
testing. (Item 4 at 4; Item 9 at 8-9, 12-24)
According to treatment records, Applicant reportedly abstained from alcohol while
participating in the continuing care program. However, he failed to follow other aftercare
plan  requirements  on  more  than  one  occasion.  Despite  repeated  reminders  of  his
requirement  to  do  so,  he  failed  to  complete  the  requisite  tasks  of  the  Navy  MORE
program. He failed to attend any AA meetings or contact his sponsor one week. He used
marijuana over the New Year’s holiday weekend in January 2017 and over the Valentine’s
Day weekend in February 2017. The details of his marijuana use during those weekends
were not specified in the record. His participation in the continuing care program ended
when he was discharged from the U.S. Navy in February 2017. (Item 4 at 4; Item 9 at 8-
9, 12-24)
During  his  April  2018  security  clearance  interview  (SI),  Applicant  reported  the
following history of his alcohol consumption: from 1999 to 2004, he drank three beers per
month; from 2004 to 2008, he drank one to six beers three to four times per week; from
2008 to 2009, during his first year in the military when he cut back his consumption to
stay in good physical condition, he drank three beers once per week; from 2009 to 2017,
he drank one to six beers three to four times per week; from 2017 through present, he
drank three beers per week. Although he averred that it took eight to ten beers for him to
become intoxicated, he admitted that he drank to intoxication every two weeks prior to his
2016 DUI. He maintained that he had not consumed alcohol to intoxication since his 2016
DUI.  He  acknowledged  that  he  had  a  problem  with  alcohol  and  that  he  took  action  to
control  it  by  attending  counseling  after  his  2016  DUI.  Inexplicably,  Applicant  did  not
reference any period of abstention from the consumption of alcohol, including while he
was participating in SARP treatment and the continuing care program. (Item 4 at 18-19)
In  May  2019,  Applicant  asserted  that  he  was  committed  to  abstaining  from  the
consumption of alcohol. He cited his child as his primary motivation for doing so. In his
October  2019  SOR  answer,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  continued  to  consume
alcohol. He stated that when he “elects to partake in an alcohol beverage,” he ensures
that he partakes “responsibly.” He averred that he does not exceed three beverages and
“takes no chances in getting behind the wheel.” (Item 2 at 2; Item 4 at 5)
Guideline H
Applicant used marijuana during two periods of his life. The first period began in
either 2001 or 2002 and continued until 2007 when he began to transition into the military.
The second period began sometime after he separated from his wife in January 2015 and
continued through February 2017, during which time he was on active duty in the U.S.
Navy and in possession of a security clearance. The facts and circumstances underlying
his use during those two periods are not entirely clear due to a combination of the lack of
specific information in the record, and Applicant’s differing accounts. (Item 2 at 2-3; Item
3 at 40-41; Item 4 at 17-18, 23)
On his June 2017 SCA, Applicant reported October 2016 as his most recent use
of marijuana. He did not specify his frequency of use during the first period beyond stating
that  it  gradually  became  more  frequent  with  his  “heaviest  use”  to  be  “about  1/8  of  an
ounce per week.” He did not address the frequency of his use during the second period.
He  asserted  that  the  second  period  began  in  the  fall  of  2016,  when  he  had  “become
discouraged with senior leadership and could no longer support agendas outlined in new
polices.” He claimed that he used marijuana during the second period because he knew
that  finding  traces  of  marijuana  “would  open  a  door  for  [him]  to  transition  back  to  the
civilian  sector.”  He  answered  “No”  to  whether  he  had  ever  purchased  marijuana.  He
answered “No” to whether he intended to use marijuana in the future. (Item 3 at 40-41)
Applicant discussed his marijuana use during his April 2018 and May 2018 SIs. He
reiterated  that  he  had  not  used  marijuana  after  October  2016.  He  acknowledged  that,
upon enlistment in the U.S. Navy, he reported using marijuana 45 times during the first
period. He estimated that he used marijuana approximately six to eight times during the
second  period.  He  explained  that  he  used  marijuana  out  of  curiosity  and  because  he
enjoyed it. He attributed his use during the second period to providing him with an escape
from the stresses of reality as he dealt with  getting caught at work for his DUI and his
marital  separation.  He  reaffirmed  that  he  had  no  intent  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future
because of its negative impact on him. (Item 4 at 17-18, 23)
Applicant acknowledged during his April 2018 SI that he obtained the marijuana
he  used  during  both  periods  either  through  friends  or  by  purchasing  it  himself.  He
estimated that he purchased it approximately 20 times between 2003 and October 2016.
He  admitted  that  he  answered  “No”  to  the  question  on  his  SCA  about  purchasing
marijuana because he did not want to “look bad.” He asserted that he had no intent to
purchase  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  acknowledged  that  he  continued  to  associate
approximately one to two times per year with one of the friends with whom he had used
marijuana. (Item 4 at 17-18)
In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana, but only through
December 2016. He recognized that he made a terrible decision to use marijuana, which
he  described  as  “haphazardly  lean[ing]  on  an  old  crutch.”  He  admitted  that  he  “lost
control,” which led him toward “an escapist mentality” towards the despair he felt at that
time  of  his  life  due  to  his  2016  DUI,  unfolding  divorce,  and  other  sensitive  matters
involving his wife. He asserted that after he tested positive for marijuana during his SARP
treatment, he “immediately shifted [his] mindset.” (Item 2 at 2-3; Item 4 at 5)
Whole Person
Applicant reported facts about the 2009, 2011, and 2016 alcohol-related incidents
on  his  2017  SCA.  He  was  interviewed  by  a  DOD  authorized  investigator  three  times
between April and May 2008 in connection with his security clearance. When asked why
he  failed  to  report  the  2004  DUI  on  his  SCA,  he  asserted  that  he  misunderstood  the
question and believed that he only had to report incidents within the prior seven years.
He failed to report, acknowledge, or otherwise address the two times he used marijuana
in  2017  (which  was  revealed  in  his treatment  records)  at any  point  during  the  security
clearance  process.  These  omissions  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  so  they  will  be
considered only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-person concept. (Item 3 at 36-39,
42-43; Item 4 at 16)
In February 2017, Applicant received a general discharge from the U.S. Navy for
serious misconduct because of his 2006  DUI  conviction  and having  tested positive for
marijuana. It was unclear in the record whether the discharge related to the positive test
for marijuana during his initial SARP intake or another test in February 2017. Applicant
asserted  that  it  related  to  the  intake  test,  but  his  treatment  records  show  that  he  was
required to submit to a urinalysis in February 2017, the results of which were not specified.
His military record revealed that an enlistment waiver had been approved for his 2004
DUI and prior marijuana use. (Item 3 at 23-24; Item 4 at 4, 11-13; Item 9 at 23)
Applicant  made  statements  in  his  SCA,  during  his  SIs,  and  in  his  SOR  answer
accepting responsibility for his excessive alcohol consumption and drug involvement. He
also offered excuses and explanations that were minimizing his behavior and culpability.
He maintained that he is no longer the same person who was involved in the incidents
alleged in the SOR and hopes that his story will help others avoid the mistakes he made.
(Item 2; Item 3 at 36-39, 42-43; Item 4 at 5, 10, 14-17, 23)
Applicant  was  promoted  by  his  employer  in  January  2018.  A  senior  manager
praised his “exemplary” work performance for which he has received accolades from his
superiors  and  peers.  In  her  role,  she  has  the  opportunity  to  observe  Applicant  on  a
consistent and regular basis. She has not witnessed Applicant consuming alcohol during
company events where alcohol is available. She has not seen or heard of any instances
where  Applicant  had  been  late  to  work,  or  appeared  to  be  under  the  influence  of  any
substance while at work. She proffered that Applicant has demonstrated a high level of
humility, integrity, and strong work ethic. Without specifying  the details of what he told
her, she stated that Applicant took “full ownership” for “his actions while in the military”
and the “poor decisions he made during that period in his life.” (Item 4 at 8; AE A)

"Applicant is 37 years old, married a second time, and has no children.  He has a
high school diploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Assembler V. He is
seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  employment.    Applicant
served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  on  active  duty  from  2005  to  2008  and  was  honorably
discharged as a Third Class Petty Officer, E-4.
Guideline G – Alcohol Consumption
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has  engaged  in  excessive  alcohol
consumption that often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to
control  impulses,  and  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  under  this  guideline.    He  has
been arrested for drunk driving  on five separate occasions over the past fifteen years.
He was first arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) in August 2004.  He pled guilty
to the offense.  His two-day jail sentence was extended by an additional 20 days when
he reported to jail intoxicated.  His second arrest for Driving Under the Influence (DUI)
occurred  in  December  2006.    (Government  Exhibits  1,  2,  3  and  6.)    This time  he  was
arrested with a child passenger in the car.  He pled no contest to this offense.  His third
arrest for DUI occurred in January 2008.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  Two years later, he
was arrested a fourth time for DUI.  This occurred on November 2010.   (Government
Exhibits 1 and 2.)    Applicant pled guilty to the lesser offense of Reckless Driving.
recent  arrest
Applicant’s  most
for  DUI  occurred
in  September  2017.
(Government Exhibit 4.)  He pled guilty to this offense.  Applicant explained that on this
occasion he went out with a friend to a bar and had some beers.  When he left, it was
raining and traffic was heavy; and as he was driving onto the freeway on ramp, the cars
in front of him stopped and he tried to stop, but was unable to before hitting the car in
front of him.  Applicant’s license was suspended, he was fined $2,500 and was required
to have a two-year ignition-interlock system installed.  He was confined for 120 hours,
received  60  days  house  arrest  requiring  him  to  wear  an  ankle  bracelet,  and  then
community  service.    He  was  also  required  to  complete  an  18  DUI  program.    He  was
sentenced  to  five  years  of  informal  probation,  which  will  end  in  December  2022.    His
driver’s license remains restricted as he is only allowed to drive as long as the interlock
is on.  (Applicant’s Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 7, and Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)
Applicant  has  never  formally  been  diagnosed  as  an  alcoholic.    He  has  never
attended  an  inpatient  alcohol treatment  program.    Following  his  most  recent  arrest  for
DUI,  Applicant  has  been  sober for  the  longest  period  that  he  can  remember,  which  is
about  30  months.    He  then  returned  to  consuming  alcohol  on  April  2018.    Applicant
states that he last consumed alcohol on Thanksgiving when he had a couple of beers.
(Tr.  p.  50.)    He  states  that  he  continues  to  drink,  but  has  reduced  his  alcohol
consumption.    He  further  states  that  he  has  also  found  Alcoholic  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings  to  be  helpful.    He  has  never  worked  the  steps  of  AA,  nor  does  he  have  a
sponsor, but realizes that it could be helpful to him in the future.   At this time, he does
not feel that he is ready to start “sharing” at this point.  (Tr. p. 50.)
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations  under  this  guideline.    He  has  used
marijuana  from  2008  to  at  least  2017.    In  August  2005,  Applicant  was  charged  with
possession of methamphetamine, a controlled substance.  Applicant explained that he
was in his car with his friend when he was pulled over by the police for no reason.  They
searched Applicant’s car and found methamphetamine underneath the passenger’s side
seat.    Applicant  states  that  the  methamphetamine  was  not  his,  but  his  friend’s.
Applicant was arrested and spent the night in jail.  The next day, he was administered a
drug test and it came back clean.  Applicant then went to court and believes the matter
was dropped.  (Government Exhibits 1, 2, and 3.)
Guideline J – Criminal Conduct
The  Government alleges  that Applicant has engaged  in  criminal  conduct,  which
raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive information.
Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.   In 2011,
Applicant was arrested for driving an unregistered vehicle and on a suspended driver’s
license  as  a  result  of  a  prior  DUI  conviction.    (Government  Exhibit  8.)    He  was  found
guilty of driving without a valid driver’s license.  He is currently on probation until 2022.
Applicant states that since he has been working for his current employer, he has
worked his way up the ladder at the company.  His performance reviews started at “high
meets”  and  as  time  passed,  he  was  promoted  and  they  now  reflect  that  he  “exceeds”
his job requirements in every aspect.  (Tr. p. 63.)
Applicant believes that his current wife has  been a contributing factor in  helping
him become more mature and responsible.  He is now trying to buy a house.

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  the  cross-allegation,  SOR  ¶  2.a,  with
explanations. I have incorporated his admissions and statements into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old. He was married from 2004 to 2011 and he has a 17-
year-old son from this marriage, which ended in divorce. He remarried in 2014. He and
his wife have a three-year old daughter. (GE 2 at 5) Applicant graduated from high school
in  2002.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  2005  to  2009,  and  was  discharged
honorably. He earned an associate’s degree in 2013 and a bachelor’s degree in 2016.
(GE 1) In early 2020, he was accepted into a master’s degree program. (AE H) Applicant
has  held  a  security  clearance  since  2005.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a
defense contractor, since April 2009, shortly after leaving the Air Force. (Tr. 26-29, 36-
38, 67; GE 1) He has an annual salary of $100,000. (Tr. 73)
In  September  2013,  Applicant  went  to  a  pool  hall  after  work.  He  consumed  a
pitcher of beer over the course of the evening. While driving home, he was pulled over by
police for having a light out on his car. He failed a roadside sobriety test, registering a
blood  alcohol  content  of  0.06.  A  search  of  his  car  revealed  a  container  of  marijuana.
(Answer; Tr. 30)
Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol
(DUI)  and  possession  of  marijuana.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  In  March  2014,  through  a  plea
agreement, the DUI charge was dismissed, and the marijuana possession charge was
reduced  to  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia,  to  which  Applicant  pleaded  guilty.  He
received a 90-day suspended jail term and two years of unsupervised probation. He was
required to attend four meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), to attend a 48-hour drug
rehabilitation  program,  and  to  submit  to  random  drug  screenings.  Applicant  completed
the requirements of probation in late June 2014. (Answer; AE A; GE 2 at 8, 11; GE 3; Tr.
30-37) He has not used illegal drugs since his 2013 offense. He recognizes that using
marijuana, particularly with a clearance, was a very poor decision. (Tr. 41, 54, 67)
Applicant testified that his 2013 arrest occurred in the aftermath of a family tragedy.
His sister, who had suffered from a severe mental impairment due to a car accident as a
teenager years before, passed away in April 2013 at age 27. Applicant did not pursue
grief counseling. He dealt with his grief by self-medicating with marijuana from May to
September  2013.  He  also went  out  drinking with  friends.  (Tr.  30-34,  40-41,  46,  68-69)
Applicant described his drinking pattern at the time as “severe.” He consumed six drinks
a day, and “upwards of 10 sometimes on weekends.” (Tr. 46)
Applicant  abstained  from  drinking  for  about  six  months  after  his  2013  DUI.  He
resumed  drinking  during  his  honeymoon  in  August  2014.  He  limited  his  drinking
somewhat. He would consume two or three beers with dinner a few nights a week and
six beers on weekends. He also continued to go out drinking on occasion. (Tr. 46-47, 50-
54, 69-70, 74)
In July 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) to renew
his clearance. He disclosed his 2013 offense. (GE 1)
In  August  2017,  Applicant  was  out  with  family  members  celebrating  his  wife’s
birthday. He consumed two or three beers over a three-hour period. While driving home,
he drove off the road while looking at his cell phone, striking a telephone pole. Applicant
refused to take a roadside field sobriety test, and he was arrested on a charge of DUI.
(Answer; GE 2 at 5-6; GE 3; Tr. 55-56) (SOR ¶ 2.a) Applicant does not believe he was
intoxicated at the time. (Tr. 74) He acknowledged that, unlike with the 2013 offense, there
was no real triggering event for the 2017 DUI beyond his own poor decision making. (Tr.
70)
In February 2018, Applicant was found guilty of DUI. He was fined and received a
60-day suspended jail term and two years of probation. He appealed to the circuit court.
(GE 3) In August 2018, Applicant entered a diversion program. He was ordered to pay
court  costs  and  fees,  to  perform  100  hours  of  community  service,  to  participate  in  an
alcohol  evaluation,  to  attend  a  victim-impact  panel,  and  to  attend  four  AA  meetings.
Applicant  completed  the  requirements  in  April  2019,  and  the  charge  was  dismissed  in
June 2019. (Answer; AE B; GE 2, GE 4, GE 5; Tr. 56-60)
As part of the diversion program, Applicant participated in alcohol counseling from
November 2018 until April 2019. In his initial screening in November 2018, Applicant was
diagnosed  with  alcohol  abuse  disorder  under  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of
Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) by a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. (AE C;
Tr. 41-44)
Applicant testified that the counseling program involved weekly group meetings for
eight weeks. He had to abstain from drinking during the program. He said he benefited
significantly from the program, and credited his participation in counseling with changing
his priorities. He became more goal-oriented. (Tr. 47-49) Applicant’s counselor submitted
a letter of recommendation noting that Applicant completed the program successfully and
attesting to Applicant’s maintenance of a healthy lifestyle. (AE E, AE G)
After his second DUI, Applicant stopped going to pool halls and started going to
the gym. He ceased drinking during the week. He testified that when he drank alcohol
outside the home, he would use ride-share programs to return to his home. Applicant is
now in a management position at work and knows the potential impact his actions would
have on his career. (Tr. 60-62, 71; AE C) He said he was last intoxicated at a party at his
house on New Year’s Eve in December 2019, when he consumed three  or four beers
over the course of the evening. (Tr. 74-75)
Applicant participated in court-ordered AA and a few additional sessions. He felt
that he did not benefit from his participation in AA. (Tr. 72-73) He had two subsequent
appointments with his counselor, but is not currently in alcohol counseling or AA. (Tr. 41-
45, 60, 75; AE G)
Applicant feels his alcohol consumption is now under control. He said, “I don’t need
it” to relax or to “de-stress” (Tr. 63-64) Applicant recognized that it took the second DUI
for him to change his outlook. He blamed the first DUI on events in his life and on his drug
use. He is now more focused on professional advancement and on his family. He accepts
full responsibility for his actions. (Tr. 116-119)
In February 2020, Applicant submitted documentation from his alcohol counselor,
who  found  that  Applicant  does  not  meet  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  any  alcohol  use  or
substance  abuse  disorders  under  the  DSM-5.  As  a  result,  no  treatment  was
recommended. (AE J, AE K)
Applicant’s  father  testified  that  Applicant  is  a  dedicated  father  and  a  good  son.
They  are  very  close.  He  said  he  was  not  aware  that  his  son  had  a  drinking  problem.
Applicant’s father, who served in the Air Force and held a clearance, regards his son as
very trustworthy. They do not talk about Applicant’s work, but instead discuss their shared
interests, like college sports. (Tr. 78-85)
Applicant’s wife testified that he is a good father. He is very intelligent and tactful.
She is very proud of him for being so driven and goal-oriented. Applicant does not drink
to excess. (Tr. 100-104)
Applicant’s  direct  supervisor  testified  that  Applicant  has  worked  for  him  for  11
years. Applicant informed him about his two arrests when they occurred. Applicant has a
great  work  ethic.  He  is  “a  bright  and  upcoming  star.”  He  is  trusted  and  liked  in  the
workplace. Applicant knows what he did was wrong. The supervisor testified that “I would
trust him with my life.” (Tr. 87-98; AE E, AE F) A coworker of Applicant’s provided a letter
of recommendation expressing similar sentiments. (AE E)
",True
"Applicant  admitted  to  both  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 15 line
1  to  page  19  line  5.)  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  for  eight  years,  has  been  employed
with the defense contractor since 1998, and has held a security clearance for about “20
years.” (Id.) He is single, and has no children. (TR at page 18 lines 8~13.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
1.b. In October of 2009, Applicant was arrested, charged and subsequently pled
guilty  to  Driving  under the  influence  (DUI).  (TR at  page  19  line 11  to  page  26  line  12,
and GX 4.) He was “at a bar,” consuming “a couple of beers and a couple of shots.” (TR
at page 23 lines 9~17.) [Later at his hearing, Applicant defined “a couple of beers and a
couple of shots” as “five/six beers . . . two/three” shots of alcohol.] (TR at page 29 lines
9~15.) Pursuant to his guilty plea, Applicant paid a $250 fine, and a 90 day jail sentence
was suspended. (GX 4.)

Applicant consumed “five/six beers . . . two/three” shots of alcohol. (TR at page 29 lines

attended  counseling,  and  was  placed  on probation for three  years.  (GXs  5 and  6.)  He
has successfully completed that counseling. (AppX A.)
However,  Applicant  remains  on  probation  until  September  of  2020,  and  he  still
consumes alcohol. (TR at page at page 26 line 13 to page 37 line 6, at page 37 lines

"Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  is  a  1987  high
school  graduate,  and  has  completed  some  college  courses,  but  not  enough  for  a
degree. He married his first wife in 1999 and divorced in 2003. He married his second
wife in 2004 and divorced in 2018. He has no children.
Applicant  has  been  working  as  a  network  analyst-technician  for  federal
contractors  since  2005.  He  was  hired  by  his current employer  and  security  sponsor  in
October  2015.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  first  granted  a  secret  clearance  in  2006
while employed with a federal contractor and detailed to  a federal agency. In 2012, his
clearance  was  upgraded  to  top-secret  and  he  has  held  it  to  present.  He  stated  that,
except  for  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  he  has  never  had  any  other  security  issues  or
concerns.
In  his  responses  to  Sections  22  (Police  Record)  and  24  (Use  of  Alcohol)  of  his
2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  a  history  of  alcohol-related  offenses.  The  background
investigation provided additional details about the security concerns alleged in the SOR.
In  substance,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 1989, 2006, and 2016; arrested in
2009 for an alcohol-related domestic violence offense; diagnosed with alcohol abuse in
2016;  and  has  continued  to  consume  alcohol  notwithstanding  his  diagnosis  of  alcohol
abuse and recommendation that he abstain from alcohol consumption.
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  1.a  –  1.e,  with
some  clarifications.  He  denied  the  allegation  that  he  continues  to  consume  alcohol.
(SOR 1.f) At his hearing, he admitted that while in counseling he was advised to remain
abstinent.  He  was  abstinent  during  his  treatment  periods,  but  after  treatment,  he
continued  to  consume  alcoholic  beverages  in  moderation.  Applicant  repeatedly  stated
that  he  was  not  aware  of  receiving  an  alcohol  abuse  diagnosis.  His  SOR  admissions,
and  those  at  the  hearing,  are incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough
review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
1.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI  in  December
1989. He has no additional recollection of the offense or its disposition.
2. In January 2006, Applicant was charged with driving an all-terrain vehicle (ATV
– four wheeler) while under the influence of alcohol. He explained that he was fixing the
ATV and drank about six or seven beers. He took the ATV for a ride on the side of the
road  to  charge  its  battery.  He  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  and  charged  with  DUI.
The charge was later downgraded to a misdemeanor. Applicant was adjudged probation
before  judgment  in  May  2006.  He  successfully  completed  the  court-mandated  alcohol
counseling  program  from  June  to  September  2006,  and  two-year  unsupervised
probation.
During  a  September  2006  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  Applicant
stated that he would consume three-to-four beers, two-to-three times a week. His future
plans were to limit his alcohol consumption to a few beers at home, and no drinking and
driving.
3.  In  December  2009,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  domestic
violence  (second  degree  assault).  He  explained  he  discovered  his  wife  was  sending
improper  pictures  of  herself  to  another  man.  He  was  upset,  and  took  the  laptop  from
her. At the same time, she grabbed the laptop to stop him from taking it, and during the
struggle,  she  cut  herself  and  reported  the  incident  to  the  police.  He  stated  he  had
consumed  three-to-four  beers  before  the  incident,  but  was  not  intoxicated.  Applicant
and  his  wife  reconciled.  She  failed  to  appear  in  court  to  testify  against  him,  and  the
charge was dismissed.
4.  In  April  2016,  Applicant  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer,  refused  to  take  a
breathalyzer  test,  and  was  charged  with  DUI.  The  charge  was  downgraded  to  a
misdemeanor after Applicant agreed to serve 15 days of confinement. He pleaded guilty
to the offense and was placed on unsupervised probation for three years (until August
2019). (SOR 1.d; GE 2)
5.  The  court  required  Applicant  to  attend  alcohol  counseling.  He  successfully
participated  in  the  12-week  substance  abuse  treatment  program  between  July  and
December 2016. (SOR 1.e; GE 3) The counseling services report (dated December 9,
2016)  states  that  Applicant  was  first  evaluated  in  July  2016.  His breathalyzer  test  was
negative for  alcohol use  and  his  urinalysis test  was  negative  for illegal  substance  use.
He completed the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) and it was “indicative of an
alcohol  problem.”  The  Chemical  Dependency  Screening  Test  (CDST)  suggested  no
apparent  problem  with  chemical  substances.  The  report  further  stated  that  Applicant
successfully  completed  his  treatment  in  December  2017,  and  that  “he  reports  sincere
motivation for total abstinence from alcohol use in the future.” (GE 3)
There  is  no  record  evidence  to  support  the  conclusion  that  Applicant  was
diagnosed with “alcohol abuse” (as alleged) or with an “alcohol use disorder” as outlined
in  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-5).  The  counseling
services  report  states  that  the  MAST  test  was  “indicative  of  an  alcohol  problem;”
however,  the  counselor  failed  to  articulate  a  diagnosis.  I  find  that  the  government’s
evidence is insufficient to establish that Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol abuse.
Applicant was interviewed in July 2018 by a government investigator concerning
his  2016  DUI.  Applicant  told  the  investigator  he  believed  the  recurrence  of  a  similar
incident was unlikely because he was now consuming only a few beers at home.
6.  SOR  1.f  alleged  Applicant  continues to  consume  alcohol,  notwithstanding  his
diagnosis, and a recommendation that he abstain from alcohol. Applicant admitted that
he  continues  to  consume  alcohol,  but in  moderation.  Concerning  the  recommendation
that  he  abstain  from  alcohol,  Applicant  admitted  he  was  required  to  remain  abstinent
while attending counseling-therapy, which he did. There is no evidence in the record file
to  establish  that  Applicant  was  counseled  to  remain  abstinent  as  part  of  his  aftercare
treatment.  As  stated  above,  I  find  that  the  government’s  evidence  is  insufficient  to
establish that Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol abuse.
I  note  that  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  13  reorganization  in  January  2017.  The
bankruptcy court discharged his dischargeable debts in April 2018.
At  hearing,  Applicant  presented  three  favorable  reference  statements  from  a
team  lead  and  two  coworkers.  The  references  consider  Applicant  to  be  highly  skilled,
knowledgeable,  competent,  dedicated  to  the  mission,  dependable,  efficient,  and
reliable.  He  is  considered  to  have  contributed  highly  in  the  daily  functions  of  the
business. He is a very reliable source in obtaining information, researching issues, and
physical relocations. Applicant has excellent rapport with other member of the team and
he willingly shares his experience with younger employees. He is also considered to be
trustworthy and a man of his word.
Applicant expressed remorse for his alcohol-related misconduct. He understands
that he needs to control his alcohol consumption. He acknowledged that he made some
mistakes in the past, and now is paying for them. Applicant stated that life is a learning
experience.  He  believes  that  he  has  learned  the  hard  way,  and  he  is  trying  to
reestablish normalcy in his life. He promised to be more responsible in the future.
Applicant testified that he has been abstinent  only while attending counseling or
treatment.  After  that,  his  plan  has  been  to  consume  alcohol  in  moderation.  In  his
response  to  May  2019  DOHA  interrogatories  and  at  hearing,  he  stated  that  he
consumes about five beers a week. He stated that he has not been arrested or involved
in  any  alcohol-related  misconduct  after  April  2016.  Before  the  2016  DUI,  he  was
consuming six beers every two days or every day, about five days a week (Tr. 38-40)
Applicant testified  that  after  his 2016  DUI,  he  reduced  his  alcohol  consumption.
He currently consumes about three beers every two days, and may have none on some
days. He stated that he has further reduced his alcohol consumption over the past year
because  he  is  having  medical issues,  including  high  blood  pressure,  and  he  does  not
believe  that  consuming  alcohol  is  helping  him.  He  has  been  monitoring  how  much
alcohol he consumes. He averred that he only consumes alcohol at home. He believes
that  he  has  faced  and  resolved  the  pertinent  issues  in  his  life.  He  has  been  drinking
moderately after his 2016 DUI, he divorced in 2017, and filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy
protection to resolve his financial problems.
Applicant  believes  he  has  made  lifestyle  changes  to  stop  him  from  consuming
excessive amounts of alcohol. He is now living with his mother and helping her with the
maintenance  of  her  home.  She  provides  him  with  the  emotional support  he needs.  He
believes that he has been working hard in  his recovery. He is committed to consuming
alcohol in moderation and has established healthy habits. Applicant is concerned about
not getting his clearance, losing his job, and not being able to provide financial support
for his mother. (Tr. 61-62) Applicant does not want to fail or let his mother down.

"Applicant was born in Somalia in 1963. He immigrated to the United States in 1984,
and became a U.S. citizen in 1992. He has a co-habitant, and one adult child from a prior
marriage. Applicant has a high school diploma and some college. He is seeking to obtain
national security eligibility in connection with a prospective job as a linguist with the DoD.
Applicant  is  conversant  in  several  languages,  but  English  is  not  his  first  language,  as
shown in the transcript. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. (Government
Exhibit 1 at Sections 9, 12, 13.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he uses intoxicants to excess. Applicant had a severe alcohol problem for many
years.  He  began  drinking  in  1982.  He  began  drinking  heavily  in  1995.  (Government
Exhibit 3 at 11-12; Tr. at 69.)
Applicant’s alcohol problem resulted in several alcohol-related arrests, as set forth
below:
1.a. Applicant was first arrested for DUI in April 1997. The available records do
not show a disposition. Applicant does not have an accurate recollection of the disposition
of this case. (Government Exhibit 3 at 9-10, Exhibit 5 at 5; Tr. at 24-25.)
1.b.  Applicant  was  arrested  for  DUI  a  second  time  in  September  1998.  The
available  records  do  not  show  a  disposition.  Applicant  does  not  have  an  accurate
recollection of the disposition of this case. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10, Exhibit 5 at 5; Tr.
at 25.)
1.c.  Applicant  was  arrested  a  third  time  for  DUI  in  November  2004.  He  was
convicted and sentenced to one day in jail, probation for three years, and a fine. Applicant
testified that he completed all the requirements of his sentence. (Government Exhibit 5 at
2; Tr. at 26-27.)
1.d. Applicant was again arrested for DUI in December 2006. The available records
do  not  show  a  disposition.  Applicant  believes  that  this  case  was  either  vacated  or
dismissed.  He  further  stated  that  he  had  not  been  drinking  on  the  date  in  question.
(Government Exhibit 3 at 8, Exhibit 5 at 5; Tr. at 28.)
1.e. Applicant was arrested for Extreme DUI  and Failure to Stop at an Accident
Scene in January 2007. Applicant did not resolve this arrest in a timely fashion and an
arrest  warrant  was  issued.  He  resolved  this  case  in  2013,  along  with  the  offense  in
allegation 1.h. The sentence included jail for 90 days, probation for three years, a fine,
community service and restitution. (Government Exhibit 3 at 9, Exhibit 5 at 5-6; Tr. at 28-
30, 37.)
Applicant’s driver’s license was also suspended for two years as a result of this
case  and  1.h.  At  the  end  of  that  time,  approximately  2015,  Applicant  had  to  have  an
ignition interlock device installed in his car. The device was originally supposed to be in
his car for three years. However, due to two incidents involving Applicant and his vehicle,
the time was extended by an additional two years. The device was still on his car at the
time of the hearing. Applicant has a current driver’s license, which was reviewed by this
administrative judge, confirming that Applicant was restricted to driving vehicles with an
interlock device. (Tr. at 46-52, 71-73.)
1.f. Applicant was again arrested for DUI in March 2008. The available records do
not show a disposition. Applicant does not have an accurate recollection of the disposition
of this case. (Government Exhibit 5 at 3; Tr. at 30.)
1.g. Applicant was arrested for Disorderly Conduct While Intoxicated in April 2008.
The records show he was convicted and paid a fine. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10, Exhibit
5 at 3; Tr. at 30-31.)
1.h. Applicant was arrested for extreme DUI in February 2010. He failed to appear
and a warrant was issued. Applicant testified that he found out about the warrants in this
case and allegation 1.e in 2013, at that time he went to court and resolved both cases.
The  sentence  included  jail  for  90  days,  probation  for  three  years,  a  fine,  community
service and restitution. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10-11, Exhibit 5 at 6; Tr. at 31-37.)
According to Applicant, the 2010 arrest for extreme DUI occurred because he was
having an epileptic seizure after drinking. He testified that police took him to the hospital,
where  he  was  diagnosed  with  diabetes.  At  that  time  Applicant  did  not  know  he  was
suffering from diabetes. Because of his diabetes diagnosis, Applicant made the decision
to stop drinking alcohol for health reasons. As of the date of the hearing he had not had
anything  to  drink  in  approximately  nine  years.  He  submitted  a  laboratory  report  dated
October 18, 2019. That report stated Applicant had no alcohol in his system, and that he
had diabetic levels of blood sugar. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10-11; Applicant Exhibit C;
Tr. at 32-33, 37-39.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline F: Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Applicant admitted that he did not filed his 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 Federal
and state income tax returns in a timely fashion. He submitted documentation showing
that  the  subject  tax  returns  were  all  filed  in  2018.  (Government  Exhibit  2;  Applicant
Exhibits A and B.)
For  many  years  Applicant  has  owned  a  small  business  in  the  United  States.
According  to  Applicant  he  was  unable  to  complete  his  tax  returns  in  a  timely  manner
because of the actions of his business partner, who did not provide timely information to
Applicant. In addition, Applicant was making a minimal income in the United States during
those years and he wrongfully believed he did not need to file a tax return. Applicant is in
the midst of closing down the partnership so as to avoid any future problems. (Tr. 39-42,
44, 52-65.)
In addition to operating his state-side business, Applicant was living and working
outside the United States during 2014, 2015, and 2017. That fact made it difficult for him
to communicate with his business partner and his tax preparer. In 2018 Applicant decided
it  was  time  to  file  all  of  his  missing  tax  returns.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  11,
Exhibit 4.)
Available records show that Applicant’s 2017 tax returns were filed, albeit late. In
addition,  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  yet  to  file  his  2018  income  tax
returns. He was uncertain of the status of those tax returns, and was unable to provide a
time frame in which they would be filed. (Tr. 43-44.)
Paragraph 3 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant has engaged in conduct
that  shows  questionable  judgment,  untrustworthiness,  unreliability,  dishonesty,  and  an
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.
Allegation 3.a states that Applicant’s conduct under paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR
are cognizable under this paragraph as well.
Allegation 3.b concerns an arrest of Applicant in December 2010 for Driving with
a  Forged  or  Counterfeit  Driver’s  License,  Driving  While  License  Suspended,  and  No
Vehicle Registration. He was convicted and sentenced to three days in jail and probation
for  three  years.  Applicant  was  stopped  by  police  and  presented  his  brother’s  driver’s
license, since Applicant’s driving privileges had been suspended. Applicant admitted that
he  had  been  driving  on  an  occasional  basis  during  the  time  his  license  had  been
suspended. He stopped this conduct in approximately 2013. (Government Exhibit 3 at 12,
Exhibit 5 at 3-4; Tr. 45-46, 65-69.)
",True
"Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security
clearance. (Tr. 6-7) He works as a lead flight mechanic performing maintenance on UH-
60  Black  Hawk  helicopters.  He  has  been  employed  with  this  company  or  its
predecessor-in-interest since December 2011. He has a very good employment record
with  his  current  employer.  (Exhibit  M)  For  example,  in  a  highly  favorable  letter  of
recommendation, Applicant’s program manager described Applicant as “one of our best
and  brightest  and  is  routinely  sought  after  when  there  is  a  problem  with  one  of  our
aircraft.” (Exhibit M at 1) Applicant stated that he has increased his annual income from
$52,000  in 2011 to about $90,000  in  2019.  (Tr. 71)  He  was  previously  employed as  a
master  aircraft  mechanic  from  October  2010  to  December  2011.  His  educational
background includes a high school diploma and some college.
Applicant’s  employment  history  also  includes  honorable  service  as  a  traditional,
part-time  Guardsman  in  the  Army  National  Guard  from  August  2006  to  August  2012.
(Exhibit  H)  His  military  occupational  specialty  (MOS)  was  15T10,  helicopter  repairer,
which is primarily responsible for maintenance of the Black Hawk helicopter. He was on
active  duty  for  about  one  year,  from  June  2008  to  June  2009.  During  that  period,  he
deployed  to  and  served  in  Iraq  for  about  ten  months  with  an  aviation  unit.  His  military
decorations  include  the  Air  Medal  (2nd  award),  Iraq  Campaign  Medal  with  Campaign
Star, and Combat Action Badge.1
1  The  Air  Medal  is  awarded  for  single  acts  of  heroism  or  meritorious  achievement  while  participating  in
aerial flight. The Combat Action Badge is awarded to soldiers of the U.S. Army of any rank, and who are
not  members  of  an  infantry  of  special  forces  unit,  for  being  present  and  actively  engaging  or  being
engaged by the enemy and performing satisfactorily per the rules of engagement.
Applicant married in 2012. He and his spouse have two young daughters. He has
lived separately from his spouse for some time, and his intention is to obtain a divorce.
(Tr.  70-71)  He  described  the  current  relationship  as  cordial,  they  are  both  focused  on
co-parenting, and he usually has his children on the weekends.
The SOR alleged and Applicant  largely admitted a history of financial problems.
In addition to his admissions, the factual allegations in the SOR are established by the
documentary  evidence.  (Exhibits  2,  3,  and  5)  The  SOR  concerns  seven  collection  or
charged-off  accounts  ranging  in  amounts  from  $439  to  $6,704  for  a  total  of
approximately  $18,646.  Applicant  denies  or  disputes  two  of  the  seven  delinquent
accounts. Pertinent details about the seven debts are discussed below.
Applicant  attributed  the  cause  of  his  financial  problems  to  an  unexpected
recoupment  action  taken  by  the  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service  (DFAS)  in
2012  and  2013.  (Tr.  33-35;  Exhibit  J)  Per  the  February  2013  last-chance  letter  from
DFAS, the $7,106 debt was due to recoupment of the unearned portion of his National
Guard bonus. (Exhibit J at 3) Applicant believed the recoupment action took “more than
double the money” they were supposed to take, which occurred via wage garnishment
and  interception  of  income  tax  refunds.  (Tr.  33)  Applicant  tried  to  contest  the  action
without success. As a result, Applicant was unable to pay other outstanding debts. (Tr.
35) Per the 2017 credit report, the DFAS debt is described as a paid $7,100 collection
due to government overpayment, and the account is closed. (Exhibit 3 at 3)
The  $6,704  charged-off  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  stems  from  a  deficiency  balance
after repossession of an automobile. The 2017 credit report shows that account was an
automobile  loan  for  $22,754  with  a  repayment  schedule  for  72  months  at  $429  per
month, which was opened in May 2012. (Exhibit 3 at 3) The credit report also shows the
$6,704  debt  was  charged  off  in  August  2013.  Applicant  explained  that  he  voluntarily
surrendered the auto because he was unable to repay the loan due to the then ongoing
DFAS recoupment action. (Tr. 33-34) He has not taken any action to repay the charged-
off debt. (Tr. 46-47)
The  $4,853  charged-off  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  stems  from  an  automobile  loan
Applicant  obtained  in  March  2017.  (Exhibits  2  and  3)  Applicant  explained  the
delinquency occurred after the vehicle was involved in an accident in January 2018, and
he  understood  his  auto  insurance  company  was  supposed  to  settle  the  matter  with
Nissan Motor. (Tr. 35) He has not taken any action to repay the charged-off debt. (Tr.
48-49)
The $1,105 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.c stems from a class Applicant sought
to  take  with  a  Christian  college  or university.  He  explained  that  he  dropped  out  of  the
class after the initial session after he was ridiculed for his religious faith. (Tr. 35, 49-50)
He settled the debt for a lesser amount in June 2019. (Exhibit F)
The $450 charged-off account in SOR ¶ 1.d stems from an account with a major
credit-card company. Applicant denied this debt because he believes it was erroneously
established when he opened a credit-card account with the same company, an account
which is in good standing. (Tr. 35-36, 50-51) In other words, the company created two
accounts at the same time. To that end, Applicant presented three account statements
from August 2019 through October 2019 for a credit-card account with the same major
credit-card company showing the account is in good standing. (Exhibit N) Applicant also
presented a single page from a credit report that reflects both accounts. (Exhibit O) The
account  in  good  standing  was  opened  in  January  2018,  and  the  account  status  is
described  as  open/never  late.  The  account  at  issue  in  the  SOR  was  opened  in
December  2017,  the  balance  was  $450  as  of  May  2019,  the  account  status  was
charged  off  with  $450  past  due  as  of  May  2019,  and  the  account  was  closed  at  the
creditor’s request. Applicant is mistaken in his belief; namely, the closure of a delinquent
account does not equate to a favorable resolution. The debt is a legitimate charged-off
account as reflected in the April 2019 credit report. (Exhibit 2 at 2)
The $439 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.e stems from a cable TV bill. (Tr. 36, 51-
52) Applicant paid the account in full in June 2019. (Exhibit E)
The  $4,480  collection  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  stems  from  an  apartment  lease
Applicant  signed  in  September/October  2010  in  his  state  of  former  residence.  (Tr.  36-
37,  53-54;  Exhibit  K)  Applicant  disputes  the  validity  of  this  debt.  He  explained  in  vivid
detail that after he signed the lease, he inspected the apartment and discovered holes
in the wall, blood on the floor, and all the appliances were missing. (Tr. 36) He deemed
the apartment unfit for occupancy, and the landlord attempted to have him sign another
lease for a different apartment. He refused, but did move his household goods into the
second apartment where it remained for a few weeks until his departure. The charged-
off  account  is  reflected  in  the  2017  credit  report  but  is not  reflected  in  the  2019  credit
report.  (Exhibits  2  and  3)  Given  the  age  of  the  account,  it  probably  aged  off  the  2019
credit report.
The  $615  collection  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  stems  from  a  telephone  account.
Applicant settled the debt for $472 in June 2019. (Exhibit G)
In addition to the matters in the SOR, Applicant presented proof of payment of a
$25 medical collection account stemming from an emergency room visit. (Exhibit I)
Overall,  Applicant  stated  that  his  financial  situation  was  improving.  He  had
$2,000  in  a  savings  account,  $2,000  at  home  as  an  emergency  fund,  and  he  was  no
longer living paycheck-to-paycheck. (Tr. 72)
Applicant has a history of excessive consumption of alcohol, beer in his case. He
attributes  his  heavy  drinking  to  the  culture  he  experienced  during  his  military  service.
(Tr. 64-65) It may have included drinking to the point where he had blackouts. (Tr. 59)
He stated that after returning from his deployment to Iraq in 2009, he “kind of crawled
into a bottle and it took a while for [him] to work [himself] out of it.” (Tr. 59) He further
explained  that  he  believes  he  was  a  functioning  alcoholic  for most  of  the  time  he  was
living and working in State T from October 2010 to December 2011. (Tr. 59, 70; Exhibit
1)  He  believes  that  he  used  to  have  an  alcohol  problem,  but  that  he  has  essentially
grown  out  of  it.  (Tr.  63)  He  currently  drinks  a  six-pack  of  beer  over  the  course  of  a
weekend,  and  he  does  not  drink  at  all  during  the  work  week.  (Tr.  64-65)  The  change
came  about  when  he moved from State T  to  State A,  and he began  his current  job  in
December 2011 (Tr. 65) His subsequent marriage in 2012 and the birth of his first child
in 2012 were also motivating factors. He has not sought out treatment or counseling for
his  use  of  alcohol  other  than  what  he  went  through  after  he  was  charged  with  driving
under the influence (DUI) in January 2018, as discussed below. (Tr. 63, 69-70)
The  SOR  alleged  and  Applicant  admitted  a  police  record  of  five  alcohol-related
incidents  away  from  work. Four of  the  incidents occurred  during  2010-2012. The  most
recent incident was a DUI arrest following a single-car accident in January 2018. He has
never had an alcohol-related incident at work. In addition to his admissions, the factual
allegations in the SOR are established by the documentary evidence. (Exhibits 1, 4, 5,
A, and B) Pertinent details about the five incidents are discussed below.
Applicant  was  arrested  for  and  charged  with  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI)  in
October  2010  while  living  in  State  T.  The  FBI  Identification  Record  reflects  that
Applicant  pleaded  no  contest  and  the  charge  was  dismissed.  (Exhibit  4)  Applicant
explained  that  he  was  stopped  by  the  police  after  leaving  a  sports  bar  where  he  had
drunk  beer.  (Tr.  37-38)  He  also  explained  that  the  charge  was  dismissed  under  a
program  for  returning  military  veterans  with  combat  experience.  The  DWI  charge  was
dismissed when he showed proof of his Combat Action Badge.
Applicant  was  arrested  for  and  charged  with  public  intoxication  in  November
2010  while  living  in  State  T.  The  FBI  record  reflects  that  Applicant  was  charged  with
unlawful carrying a weapon, the disposition of which was a no bill. (Exhibit 4) Applicant
explained that he was stopped by the police while walking to a store. (Tr. 38-39, 57-60)
He  may  have  declined  to  perform  a  field  sobriety  test,  but  he  told  the  police  he  was
carrying  a  firearm,  which  he  then  assisted  them  in  locating  on  his person.  He  went  to
the scheduled court appearance intending to contest the public intoxication offense, but
decided to plead guilty and pay a $100 fine so he could avoid waiting and get back to
work.
Applicant was arrested for and charged with DWI in September 2011 while living
in State T. The FBI record reflects that the charge was dismissed. (Exhibit 4) Applicant
explained  that  he  believes  he  was  charged  because  he  refused  to  perform  a
breathalyzer test. (Tr. 39-40, 60-61) He stated he had previously taken and passed the
field sobriety tests. He had not consumed alcohol that night, as he was the designated
driver.
Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication in March 2012, a few
months  after relocating  to State A.  Applicant  explained this incident  stemmed from his
attempt to buy a piece of furniture via Craigslist and the resulting misunderstanding and
conflict between him and the seller. (Tr. 40-41, 61-62; Exhibit 5 at 4) Applicant had one
or two beers at a sports bar before meeting with the seller. The seller called the police,
and Applicant ended up arrested for public intoxication. He sought legal advice because
he was soon to be married and wanted to dispose of the matter. Per his lawyer’s advice,
he pleaded no contest and paid a small fine.
The  fifth  and  most  recent  incident  occurred  in  January  2018,  when  he  was
arrested  for  and  charged  with  DUI.  Applicant  explained  this  incident  stemmed  from  a
single-car accident while driving home after a poker game at a friend’s house where he
had a couple of beers. (Tr. 41-42, 63, 74-75). He stopped on the way and bought a 12-
pack of beer. Resuming his trip, he hit a deer about three miles from his home, entered
the ditch next to the road, and then hit a tree. He broke a rib, fractured his leg, and was
laying  alongside  the  road  when  the  authorities  arrived.  The  12-pack  of  beer  had
exploded  during  the  accident.  The  police  wanted  him  to  perform  a  field  sobriety  test,
which he refused due to his injuries. He was subsequently arrested.
In  February  2018,  the  State  Driver  License  Division  concluded  the  available
information  about  the  incident  was  not  sufficient for an  administrative  suspension, and
decided  not  to  administratively  suspend  his  driving  privilege  based  on  his  refusal.
(Exhibit B) For the DUI case, with assistance of counsel, Applicant completed a type of
pre-trial diversion program over the course of several months requiring him to submit to
random  drug  and  alcohol  tests  and  attend  classes  on  substance  abuse.  The  major
lesson he learned from the program was that “it’s just easier to not live life on that side.”
(Tr. 74-75) Applicant complied with all requirements, including payment of $370 in court
costs, and the state court dismissed the DUI charge in November 2018. (Exhibit A)
At  the  time  of  the  accident,  Applicant  had  already  reduced  his  level  of  alcohol
consumption. After the accident, Applicant abstained from alcohol during the months he
was in the program, from about March through October 2018. (Tr. 73) He then resumed
drinking beer, but only on weekends as described above.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.2  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”3  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the  burden  of  proof  is  less  than  a  preponderance  of  evidence.4  The  DOHA  Appeal
2  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).
3 484 U.S. at 531.
4 484 U.S. at 531.
Board  has  followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s findings  of  fact  are  reviewed
under the substantial-evidence standard.5
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.6  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.7
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or

separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of  the  past-due  debt  which  is  the  cause  of  the  problem  and  provides
documented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Turning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant’s financial problems are related to
the  unexpected  DFAS  action  to  recoup  a  bonus  he  received  for  his  service  in  the
National  Guard.  The  recoupment  action  was  for  $7,100,  which  is  not  a  minor  sum  of
money. The recoupment action was in late 2012 and early 2013, it followed his marriage
and the birth of his first child in 2012, and it proved to be a financial setback. He acted
reasonably  under  the  circumstances  by  voluntarily  surrendering  a  vehicle  he  could  no
longer afford. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(b) applies in
Applicant’s favor.
Applicant  has  made  a  good-faith  effort  to  resolve  some  of  his  delinquent
accounts.  He  paid  or  settled  three  of  the  smaller  debts  and  he  paid  a  minor  medical
collection  account  too.  But  there  are  also  three  accounts  for  which  he  has  taken  no
action  and  had  no  plan  to  do  so.  One  of  those  three  he  was  under  the  mistaken
impression that the account is invalid. Given the circumstances, the mitigating condition
at AG ¶ 20(d) applies in Applicant’s favor to a limited extent.
Applicant  has also provided  sufficient  evidence,  through his vivid  testimony  and
documentation, that he has a legitimate basis to dispute the $4,480 collection account
stemming  from  the  apartment  lease  he  signed  in  2010.  He  probably  has  a  legitimate
claim of constructive eviction, in that the landlord’s act of making the apartment unfit for
occupancy  resulted  in  Applicant  being  compelled  to  leave.  In  any  event,  the  debt  is
nearly ten years old, and it is no longer reflected in the Government’s most recent credit
report  from  2019.  Given  all  the  circumstances,  it  is  no  longer  of  security  significance.
Accordingly, the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(e) applies to this particular debt.
Under Guideline G for alcohol consumption, the suitability of an applicant may be
questioned  or  put  into  doubt  because,  as  set  forth  in  AG  ¶  21,  excessive  alcohol
consumption  often  leads  to  the  exercise  of  questionable  judgment  or  the  failure  to
control  impulses,  and  it  can  raise  questions  about  a  person’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while
under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,
or  other  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  the  frequency  of  the
individual’s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with
alcohol use disorder;
AG  ¶  22(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of
impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with
alcohol use disorder; and
AG ¶ 23(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent,
or  it  happened  under  such  unusual  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to
recur  or  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,
trustworthiness, or judgment.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
consumption of alcohol that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline G.
For  the  reasons  discussed  below,  the  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  noted
above apply here.
The  key  facts  are  not  in  dispute.  Applicant  was  involved  in  five  incidents,  as
alleged  in  the  SOR,  which  resulted  in  a  police  record.  He  admits  that  he  consumed
alcohol in four of the five incidents. The incidents cover a period of years; the first four
occurred during a period of less than two years from October 2010 to March 2012. The
fifth  and  most  recent  occurred  in  January  2018,  about  18  months  before  the  record
closed  in  this  case.  The  three  incidents  resulting  in  DWI  or  DUI  charges  ended  in
dismissal, while he pleaded guilty or no contest to two charges of public intoxication and
paid a small fine for each offense.
Applicant  reports  that  he  has  reduced  and  modified  his  beer  drinking.  He  limits
himself to a six-pack on the weekends and does not drink during the work week. He has
followed that pattern of consumption since his relocation to State A in December 2011.
He  abstained  from  alcohol  for  a  period  of  several  months  following  the  January  2018
incident.  He  did  so  as  part  of  the  pre-trial  diversion  program,  which  he  successfully
completed and had the DUI charge dismissed in November 2018.
Applicant’s honorable military service also deserves consideration. The award of
the Air Medal on two occasions and the Combat Action Badge for his service in Iraq are
significant  matters.  A  bit  of  leeway  or  forgiveness  or  both  is  appropriate  for  a  soldier
who risked his life for our Nation, and I have credited him accordingly.
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  impressed  me  as  a  no-nonsense  person.  He  was
candid  and  direct  with  answers  in  response  to  questions.  He  made  admissions  (e.g.,
crawled into a bottle and functioning alcoholic) about his history of alcohol consumption
that demonstrated self-awareness, insight, and self-reflection about his use of alcohol. It
was also an acknowledgment of his abuse of alcohol.
Finally,  I  considered  the  history  of  Applicant’s  financial  problems  and  alcohol-
related incidents together. A good part of his problems, but not the entirety, took place
years ago. His financial position is much improved and he is earning enough income to
provide for his family and pay his creditors. His pattern of alcohol consumption has also
much improved, as he reduced and modified his beer drinking to a point where it is not
excessive.  Overall,  I  am  persuaded  that  Applicant’s  history  of  financial  problems  and
alcohol-related  incidents  are  now  safely  in  the  past  and  will  not  recur  in  the  future.
Accordingly, given the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that Applicant is an
acceptable security risk within the meaning of ¶ 2(a) of Appendix A to the Directive.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  about
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or  vice
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate
burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.

"Applicant  is  55,  and  widowed.  He  does  not  have  any  children.  Applicant  has  a
Bachelor  of  Science  degree  and  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  software
engineer. He is seeking to retain a national security eligibility in connection with his work
with the DoD.
Paragraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he uses intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted allegations 1.a through 1.d in
the SOR under this guideline, with explanations. He denied allegation 1.e. Allegations 1.a
through 1.d will be discussed in chronological order:
1.d. Applicant was first arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) on June 29,
1987. He was 23 at that time. Applicant pled guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced
to three years of probation, a fine, to serve a suspended jail sentence, and was ordered
to  attend  a  first  conviction  program.  Applicant  was  fulfilling  the  requirements  of  his
sentence when he was arrested for DUI a second time, as set forth below. (Government
Exhibits 8 and 9; Tr. 44-45.)
1.c. Applicant was arrested for a DUI on December 12, 1988. He pled guilty to DUI
with a prior conviction. His sentence included five years of probation, his driver’s license
was restricted for one year, a fine and jail time. Applicant successfully completed all the
terms of this sentence. His probation ended in approximately March 1994. Applicant did
not drink during his time on probation. (Government Exhibits 7 and 9; Tr. 40, 45-47.)
1.b. Applicant was arrested a third time for DUI in August 1995. He plead guilty to
DUI.  His  sentence  included  seven  years  of  probation,  a  fine,  community  service,  his
driver’s license was suspended for eighteen months, and he had to attend an eighteen-
month alcohol awareness class. Applicant successfully completed all of the requirements.
(Government Exhibits 6 and 9; Tr. 47.)
Applicant met his wife in 1998. They were together until her death on July 8, 2017.
During that time Applicant continued to drink alcohol, but he stated his use was primarily
restricted  to  home  and  sporting  events  with  friends.  Applicant’s  alcohol  use  increased
after her death, as he would drink when he got home to help him sleep. His alcohol use
continued at sporting events. He also had a heart attack a short time after his wife died.
After about a year Applicant decided he needed to get out and socialize. This resulted in
his fourth DUI arrest, described below. (Tr. 30-31, 47-50.)
1.a. Applicant was arrested for DUI on August 19, 2018. Applicant had been out at
an event and had too much to drink. On the way home he decided to park his truck and
sleep it off, but left his engine running. Police woke him up and arrested him after receiving
a report from a concerned citizen. According to court records, Applicant’s blood alcohol
level was 0.14%. He plea guilty and was sentenced to five years of summary probation,
and fined. He was also required to attend a first conviction program that included several
types of counseling, and a Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD) program. Applicant
remains  on  probation  until  2023,  but  has  completed  the  rest  of  the  sentencing
requirements.  Applicant  stated  that  he  will  never  drink  and  drive  again.  (Government
Exhibits 3 and 5; Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 19-29, 51-60, 64, 67.)
1.e.  Applicant  has  been  a  habitual  alcohol  user  for  many  years,  starting  in
approximately 1982. Applicant continued to drink after his most recent arrest, primarily on
social occasions, occasionally to excess and intoxication.  He testified that he last used
alcohol when he drank approximately five glasses of whiskey at a football game about a
month  before  the  hearing  in  this  case.  Applicant’s  testimony  about  his  future  use  of
alcohol was unclear. He appeared to state that he had stopped drinking completely. Yet,
Applicant also testified, “I hope that I’m trending towards not drinking, but I’m not there
yet.” He also stated that his goal was to stop drinking irresponsibly. He is not currently
attending  any  alcohol  treatment,  including  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA).  (Government
Exhibit 3; Tr. 37-39, 43-44, 60-62.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct)
2.a.  The  Government  alleged  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
national  security  eligibility  because  he  will  remain  on  probation  until  approximately
October  2023  as  a  result  of  the  conviction  set  forth  under  allegation  1.a.  Applicant
admitted this allegation.
Mitigation
Applicant has had a successful career, as shown by his resume. (Applicant Exhibit
B.)
",False
"Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  cybersecurity  engineer  who  has  been  in  his  present
positon  for  nearly  two  years.  He  is  considered  an  excellent  employee  and  has
maintained  a  security  clearance  without  adverse  incident  since  2006.  He  appreciates
the  responsibilities  of  one  maintaining  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  26)  Applicant  has
earned a master’s degree in information systems.
Married, Applicant is the father of a toddler and is expecting a second child. He is
the  main  wage-earner  with  an  income  of  about  $120,000  a  year.  His  wife,  who  also
maintains  a  security  clearance,  works  at  home  as  a  business  analyst  generating
approximately $100,000 a year in salary.
The couple own their  home, in which no alcohol is present. Applicant has been
abstinent  since  March  2018,  consuming  his  last  alcoholic  beverages  at  a  party  for  his
child.  (Tr.  22).  This  led  to  his  most  recent  alcohol-related  incident,  discussed  below.
Prior  to  that,  he  had  not  had  alcohol  for  over  three  years.  (Tr.  25,  62)  He  has  never
been  diagnosed  as  an  alcoholic  or  alcohol-dependent.  (Tr.  27)  He  has  had  extensive
counseling and does not believe he has a problem with, or need for, alcohol. (Tr. 27)
Applicant’s  alcohol-related  issues  and  legal  issues  date  back  to  at  least  2010.
One night in about September 2010, Applicant was spotted by a police officer swerving
his car. (Tr. 46)  At the time he was heading back to his hotel after attending an event
where he had consumed alcohol. (Tr. 43) He passed the field sobriety test and he had a
.06  or  a  .07  result  on  a  breathalyzer  reading,  under  the  legal  threshold  of  .08  for
intoxication. (Tr. 28-29; 41) However. Applicant was arrested and charged with driving
under the influence (DUI). Being handcuffed and driven to the station was “devastating
and  it  shook  [him].”  (Tr.  46-47)  His  lawyer  appeared  in  court  and  the  matter  was
dropped. He no longer has much faith in field sobriety tests or breathalyzers. (Tr. 29)
In  January  2012,  Applicant  was  arraigned  for  DUI  (first  offense).  Applicant  had
been stopped for a broken headlight after drinking at an earlier social event. (Tr. 49) He
does  not  remember  how  much  time  had  passed  between  his  imbibing  and  his  being
pulled  over,  nor  does  he  recall  how  much  alcohol  he  had  consumed.  (Tr.  49-50)  He
does not remember the result of a urine test and does not recall whether a breathalyzer
was  administered  at  the  time  of  arrest.  (Tr.  30,  52)  His  attorney  negotiated  a  plea
agreement. (Tr. 53) In February 2012, a deferred sentencing agreement was filed and
Applicant  was  enrolled  in  a  diversion  program.  (Ex.  6)  Ultimately,  the  charges  were
dismissed  as  part  of  the  plea  agreement  after  successful  conclusion  of  the  diversion
program (nolle diversion) in February 2013. (Ex. 6; Tr. 53)
In  about  April  2014,  Applicant  had  been  out  with  friends  and  had  a  “couple”  of
alcoholic beverages. (Tr. 57) On the way home, his vehicle was rear-ended by another
car.  The  other  driver  appeared  to  be  injured  and  he  called  the  police.  After  officers
arrived, he was asked to submit to a breathalyzer and a field sobriety test, both of which
he refused because he “wasn’t confident to perform the test . . . .[he] did not think [he]
was  under  the  influence.”  (Tr. 31)  He  did so because in  the  past,  he had  been told to
refuse  such  tests  unless  a  lawyer  was  present.  (Tr.  34)  He  was  arrested  and
handcuffed, leaving him to feel “awful, not good.” (Tr. 59)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI.  He  admitted  to  the  DUI  charge
and  was  convicted  of  that  crime.  (Tr.  56)  He  entered  a  diversion  program,  which  he
successfully  completed.  A  counselor  gave  him  a  good  prognosis.  (Tr.  59)  He  was
advised  not  to  drink  and  drive  in  the  future.  After  three  alcohol-related  incidents,
Applicant  began to  feel  he was  “running out  of  luck” and,  given his  job, marriage,  and
baby,  he  realized  he  had  too  much  to  lose  if  his  pattern  continued.  (Tr.  63)  He
understood  “bad things happen  when I  consume  alcohol.”  (Tr. 63)  At  some  point  after
the 2014 incident, he decided to permanently quit using alcohol. (Tr. 61) He maintained
that commitment for “over three years.” (Tr. 62)
Despite his decision to give up alcohol, Applicant again imbibed in March 2018.
After drinking alcohol at a party for his child at home, Applicant and some friends went
to  a  bar.  (Tr.  65)  While  driving  himself  home  around  3:30  a.m.,  he  was  detained  at  a
traffic  stop  by  police.  (Ex.  12;  see  also  Tr.  70,  indicating  the  stop  was  at  about  1:00
a.m.) His attorney argued that reckless driving was a more appropriate charge. (Tr. 34,
71;  Ex.  12).  Applicant  attended  several  alcohol  counseling  sessions  and  courses.  He
was  ultimately  convicted  of  reckless  driving  and  breathalyzer  refusal,  and  his  driver’s
license was suspended for three years.  It remains suspended.
As a consequence of the 2018 incident, Applicant was asked to resign from his
employer  for  violation  of  a  new  drug  and  alcohol  policy.  (Tr.  55)  Applicant  and
management  discussed  the  issue.  Applicant  knew  that  even  the  reckless  driving
conviction could lead to his termination. (Tr. 76) It was ultimately agreed that Applicant
could simply resign from his position and keep his record “clean.” (Tr. 40)
Today,  Applicant  maintains  that  he  has  never  driven  a  vehicle  under  the
influence of alcohol nor ever blown an alcohol level above the legal limit for intoxication
and DUI. (Tr. 30) He has signed a letter of intent not to return to drinking. (Tr. 35-36, 38;
Ex. E) He believes he is no longer at risk for driving after drinking because he does not
drink. (Tr. 36) After being assessed by a counselor, he was not found to be in need of
treatment. (Ex. F) It was noted that he was on a “positive trajectory.” (Tr. 38)
",False
"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old, has never married, and has no children. He earned his
bachelor’s  degree  in  mathematics  in  September  2010,  and  his  master’s  degree  in
computational  science,  engineering,  and  mathematics  in  August  2012.  He  took  some
courses online from January 2014 to January 2017, and earned a graduate certificate. He
has worked for the same defense contractor since  August 2012, after interning for the
company in the summer of 2011, and he is currently a senior research associate. Applicant
indicated on a July 2014 security clearance application that he  was granted an interim
secret-level clearance in July 2014, although he has not worked on any classified projects.
(GEs 1-2, AE A; Tr. 24.)
Psychological Conditions
Applicant first sought mental health treatment in 2000, when he was 13 years old.
He was struggling with depression, had low self-esteem, and lacked motivation. He was
prescribed a mood-stabilizer medication at that time because of his family history of bipolar
disorder,  and  he  has  been  voluntarily  receiving  outpatient  psychiatric  treatment  and
counseling since then. (GEs 3-4.)
At age 17, in December 2003, Applicant had a manic episode after he ran out of his
Lamictal medication while on a family vacation. Over the course of two weeks, he became
extremely talkative with rapid speech, grandiose ideas, insomnia, and held a delusional
belief. His mother took him to an emergency room, and he was admitted to a hospital for
two weeks in January 2004 and treated for diagnosed depression. (GE 4; Tr. 25.) On his
discharge from the inpatient psychiatric treatment, Applicant was prescribed Lithium, and
he resumed his mental health treatment under the care of a psychiatrist and psychologist
for diagnosed bipolar I disorder. (GE 4; Tr. 26-27.)
Clinical  notes  from  his  then  treating  psychiatrist  in  August  2010  indicate  that
Applicant’s bipolar I symptoms were under good control on the antidepressants Zoloft and
Sertraline,  and  the  mood-stabilizers  Lamictal  and  Lamotrigine.  During  a  psychiatric
evaluation at the university health services for a transfer of providers when he moved for
graduate  school in  September 2010,  Applicant  related that he was consuming alcohol
three nights a week, three to four drinks per occasion, and six drinks on the weekend days.
He stated he was not using any illegal drugs. He reported feeling “definitely depressed,”
and worrying excessively. Applicant reported some improvement in functioning over the
previous  two  years.  He  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  I  disorder,  most  recent  episode
depressed, moderate. Applicant was started on Abilify medication, and he began weekly
therapy with a psychologist in the community while continuing to meet with a psychiatrist at
the  university’s  health  services  department.  Applicant  continued  to  struggle  with
depression, with some exacerbation of symptoms around academic examinations. (GE 4.)
During a session with his university health services’ psychiatrist on March 2, 2011,
Applicant  reported  a  significant  improvement  in  mood  since  his  previous  session  in
December  2010.  He  was  taking  Lamictal  and  Zoloft  medication  with  good  effect,
experiencing  no  mood  swings,  and  continuing  in  therapy  with  a  psychologist  in  the
community. During his next session, which occurred in May 2011, Applicant reported no
mania or severe depression, although he had downward turns of mood lasting several
hours or days and moderate generalized anxiety. He had a pattern of relying on alcohol to
medicate for his anxiety. He was advised to obtain care from a psychiatrist in the local
community. (GE 4.)
In September 2011, Applicant had a final session at university health services. He
advised that he had not found a new psychiatrist and was running low on his medications.
He  was  given  a  14-day  supply  of  Zoloft  and  contact  information  for  some  local
psychiatrists. His mental health was assessed as fairly stable. (GE 4.) The psychologist
who treated Applicant on a regular basis from September 2010 to December 2011 for
diagnosed bipolar disorder indicates that their sessions focused primarily on managing
Applicant’s depression and related issues. Applicant exhibited no serious problems with
judgment or impulse control, and no serious behavioral or psychiatric issues. (GE 5.)
After earning his master’s degree in August 2012, Applicant began working for his
current employer. (GE 1.) Life stress led Applicant to retreat into a very depressive episode
in late 2013. He missed approximately one month of work because of his depression and
checked himself into a three-week partial hospitalization program. The treatment consisted
primarily of talk therapy, medication adjustments as needed, and support to regain his
stability after the depressive episode. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 29-30.)
Over the years, Applicant’s medication dosages have been adjusted to address his
mental health issues. He continues to experience depression and intense anxiety, but he
has  not  had  any  symptoms  of  mania  since  2003.  (Tr.  25-26.)  He  currently  takes
Lamotrigine  (a  mood-stabilizer),  Lexapro,  Ativan,  and  Wellbutrin  for  his  mental  health
issues.  (Tr.  27-28.)  He  sees  his  psychiatrist  once  every  two  months  for  medication
management and his psychologist every two weeks for counseling. (GEs 6-7; Tr. 29.)
Applicant began a therapeutic relationship with his current psychiatrist in April 2013
(GE  6)  and  with  his  psychologist  in  March  2015.  (GEs  2,  7.)  Applicant’s  psychiatrist
diagnosed  him  with  bipolar  I  disorder  (single  manic  episode,  most  recent  episode
depressed); social anxiety disorder; and generalized anxiety disorder. Between April 2013
and March 2016, Applicant experienced four episodes of depression but no hypomania or
mania. Applicant took his medications as prescribed and had extended psychotherapy.
(GE 6.) During his intake with his current psychologist, Applicant presented with episodic
depression and problems with social anxiety. The psychologist diagnosed him with major
depressive disorder, moderate, recurrent, and with social anxiety disorder. As of March
2016, Applicant had attended 41 sessions with his psychologist. He was actively committed
to working on ways to manage his symptoms and keep them from interfering with his life.
His treating psychologist indicated that Applicant was particularly responsive to cognitive-
behavioral interventions  to  decrease  problematic  thoughts,  and  he made considerable
progress in the area of being more active in pursuing social interactions and confronting his
anxieties. His mood was stable and bright for several months as of March 2016. (GE 7.)
On October 6, 2018, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation by a clinical
psychologist  at  the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF.  Applicant  reported  that  he  continues  to
experience  approximately  four  depressive  episodes  of  varying  intensity  per  year.  He
reported  experiencing  symptoms  of  anxiety,  especially  in  social  settings,  although  he
exhibited  no  observable  signs  of  anxiety.  He  expressed  an  understanding  of  the
seriousness of his condition and of the importance of taking his psychiatric medications as
prescribed. The psychologist assessed Applicant’s judgment as good and his insight as
intact. Clinical testing revealed no marked elevations indicative of psychopathology, but
some potential problems with regard to his anxiety, albeit still within the normal range. The
psychologist  noted  that  Applicant’s  single  manic  episode  at  age  17  could  have  been
triggered by the anti-depressant medication he was taking at the time, and she gave him a
good prognosis as to the risk of another manic episode. Depression was more prominent,
but the psychologist noted that his depressive symptoms had not negatively interfered with
his work environment since 2014. Applicant showed that he is able to identify triggers for a
depressive  episode  (i.e.,  that  they  are  more  likely  to  occur  in  the  winter,  after  the
dissolution of a romantic relationship, or when he is overwhelmed at work), but this insight
was considered to be a strength in that it allows him to be proactive in utilizing his coping
skills,  and  taking  measures  to  minimize  the  impact  of  his  symptoms.  The  clinical
psychologist assessed his prognosis for future depressive episodes as poor in that they are
likely to occur throughout his life, but the chronicity of his depression has a fairly predicable
pattern  that  makes  his  condition  “quite  stable.”  Applicant’s  ongoing  anxiety  could
exacerbate or serve as a trigger for his depressive episodes, although it could serve as “a
protective  factor when  it  comes  to  judgment  and  impulsivity.” The  clinical  psychologist
concluded about his mental health conditions as follows:
[Applicant] does have chronic mental health conditions, including Bipolar I
Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder, that are being appropriately managed
and treated, and they are currently stable. Even when symptomatic, it is not
believed  that  these  conditions  pose  any  significant  risks  to his judgment,
reliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified information. Additionally,
the risk to judgment and reliability of any future mental health problems is
low.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant used marijuana regularly in high school, initially once or twice a month
starting at age 16 in approximately 2002. After his hospitalization for his manic episode in
2003,  Applicant  began  to  consider  ceasing  his marijuana  use.  He  understood  that  his
marijuana use contributed to his lack of motivation and caused him intense anxiety. Yet, by
age 18, he was using marijuana daily and sometimes multiple times per day. His marijuana
use was social with friends, and he used marijuana because his friends were using it. (GEs
2-3;  Tr.  30-31.)  Applicant  reported  to  a  psychiatrist  in  September  2010  that  he  was
“consistently high” from smoking marijuana between the ages of 18 and 20 (between 2004
and 2006). (GE 4.)
Initially, Applicant used marijuana shared by his friends, occasionally contributing
money  for marijuana  or splitting  the  cost  of  marijuana  with  others. By age 18, he was
purchasing marijuana once or twice a week at a cost of $40 each time. Approximately once
every couple of months, Applicant sold some of his marijuana to friends, but not for profit.
(GE 2.)
Applicant decided to reduce his marijuana use because it made him feel paranoid
and interfered with his productivity. He no longer purchased marijuana after 2005, but he
continued to use marijuana once a year to once every couple of years to at least 2016.
(GEs 2, 4; Tr. 31.) During a session with his then treating psychiatrist in late May 2011,
Applicant reported that he was using marijuana rarely, less than once a month. (GE 4.)
During  his personal subject  interview  with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
investigator on May 3, 2017, Applicant indicated that he used marijuana once every couple
of  years.  (GE  2.)  At  his  March  2020  hearing,  he  described  his  marijuana  use  since
approximately 2005 as “once a year tops.” (Tr. 32.)
On  July  24,  2014,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86.) In response to an inquiry concerning
any illegal drug use in the last seven years, Applicant responded that he used marijuana
between  September  2002  and  November  2011,  stating,  “In  high  school  I  smoked
marijuana recreationally with some periods of heavy use. In college, I used it on the rare
occasion.” Applicant responded “No” to whether he intended to use marijuana in the future
and explained that he used the drug as a teenager and was no longer interested in using it.
Applicant answered “No” to a question concerning any illegal drug purchase in the last
seven years. He responded “Yes” to an inquiry into whether he had intentionally misused a
prescription  drug  in  the  last  seven  years,  and  disclosed  that  he  had  used  “Concerta”
between January 2007 and January 2008 “as a stimulant for pulling all night study sessions
in college.” (GE 1.)
Applicant used marijuana after he completed his SF 86. He used marijuana while
vacationing with college friends in June 2015, and another time in 2016. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 31-
32.) About his use in June 2015, he told the OPM investigator in May 2017 that he wanted
to confirm that he no longer liked the drug, and that after taking two hits of marijuana from
a bowl, he felt uncomfortable and stoned. (GE 2.) Applicant held a “misguided notion” that
his  drug  involvement  would  not  be  disqualifying  because  he  was  truthful  about  his
marijuana use, did not have a serious addiction problem, and his use was restricted to
“lighter substances such as marijuana or Adderall.” (Tr. 35-36, 44.) Applicant states that he
would not have used marijuana if he understood it was a problem for his security clearance
eligibility. (Tr. 44.)
As  of  March  2016,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  by  his  treating  psychiatrist  with
cannabis  use  disorder, severe,  but  in  remission.  (GE  6.)  During  his May  2017  subject
interview, Applicant admitted that he has friends who currently use marijuana, and that his
roommates use marijuana in their home, but not in his presence. He indicated that he
made a personal choice to stop using marijuana, but when asked about his future intent,
he expressed “a reasonable expectation” that he may smoke marijuana in the future, once
every few years, depending on the situation. (GE 2.) During his psychological evaluation for
the DOD in October 2018, Applicant admitted to the evaluating psychologist that he used
marijuana as recently as 2016 and would be open to using marijuana again. He also stated
that, although his friends use marijuana, he has been able to refrain from using it. (GE 3.)
Applicant knew that marijuana use remains illegal under federal law, notwithstanding the
state’s decriminalization of recreational use of marijuana. (Tr. 46.)
At his hearing in March 2020, Applicant expressed a willingness to abstain from
marijuana  use  if  he  is  granted  a  clearance.  (Tr.  34,  44.)  He  testified  that  he  would
“potentially” use marijuana in the future if he does not have a clearance. (Tr. 34.) Applicant
lived with persons who used marijuana from September 2016 to September 2018. Within a
few  months  of  his  March  2020  security  clearance  hearing,  he  was  at  a  small  social
gathering  with  persons  who  smoked  marijuana  in  his  presence.  He  did  not  use  any
marijuana at that time because he had no desire to use it, as he “generally” does not enjoy
it at this point in his life. (Tr. 45-46.) As to why then he would then consider the possibility
of future marijuana use, especially given its illegality under federal law, Applicant testified:
That’s a legitimate question. Part of it is just out of curiosity, just to see if [it]
still affects me in the way that it does right now, in the way that provokes just
anxiety. (Tr. 46.)
Applicant used Adderall without a prescription about once every two to three months
from 2002 to 2005. He obtained the drug from friends. (GE 2.) While he was in college,
Applicant used Adderall or Concerta “a handful of times” from January 2007 to January
2008 as a study aid. The drugs were not prescribed for him. (GEs 1-2.) During his May
2017 subject interview with the OPM investigator, he denied any intention to misuse either
Adderall or Concerta in the future. (GE 2.) Yet, he used Adderall recreationally at a party in
July 2018 while socializing with some friends from college. The drug was given to him by a
friend who had a prescription. (GE 3; Tr. 35.) Applicant did not think his substance misuse
was a problem for his clearance eligibility because he did not have a serious drug problem
and his use was of a “lighter substance.” In hindsight, he would not have used it had he
realized it posed a problem for his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 35-36.) Applicant knew that
taking a drug not legally prescribed for him was against the law, but he did not think much
of it because “[it] was in a controlled environment, private environment. And there was no
potential of harm to [himself] or others at the time.” (Tr. 53.)
The licensed clinical psychologist, who evaluated Applicant for the DOD in October
2018, expressed her belief that his marijuana use poses no significant risk to his judgment,
reliability, or trustworthiness, given he had not used the drug with any regularity since 2005.
His use of Adderall in July 2018 was “a moment of poor judgment, especially considering
his mental health conditions and the fact that he is in the process of undergoing a security
clearance determination. The psychologist opined that Applicant’s drug use did not meet a
clinical level of pathology, and that more often than not, Applicant is able to make good
decisions. However, she deferred to the adjudicators as to whether his recent misuse of a
stimulant in July 2018 is relevant to his security worthiness. (GE 3.)
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant drank alcohol a few times in high school, but he did not enjoy it. After two
years at a community college, he transferred to a four-year university in January 2007. He
was pulled over in 2009 and failed a field sobriety test, but he was not charged with an
alcohol offense. (GE 3.) While at the university, Applicant began drinking six or more beers
on the weekends at bars to be social. In September 2010, he started graduate school. He
socialized  with  others  who  drank  alcohol,  and  over  the  next  two  years,  his  drinking
increased to five to seven days per week, three to four beers on weeknights and five to six
beers on the weekends. As of March 2011, Applicant reported drinking alcohol two days
during the work week, up to three drinks per day, and six drinks on both weekend nights.
(GE 4.) In February 2011, Applicant had been advised by his psychologist that his drinking
was likely exacerbating his depression. Applicant was reportedly mildly defensive with his
psychologist about his drinking, and expressed that it was the only really bright spot in his
week in that alcohol helped him feel less anxious. Despite being advised of the risk that
alcohol posed for his bipolar disorder, Applicant did not plan to quit drinking, although he
told his psychologist he would consider reducing his weekday consumption. (GE 5.)  In late
May  2011,  Applicant  admitted  to  his  then  treating  psychiatrist  that  he  was  consuming
seven to eight drinks on Friday and Saturday nights regularly to get drunk, and three to four
drinks two other nights of the week. (GE 4.)
In October 2011, Applicant acknowledged to his mental health providers that he was
drinking too much. He was drinking daily up to five beers at a sitting during the week and
more on the weekends. Applicant expressed no interest in ceasing his alcohol use. (GE 5.)
In March 2016, Applicant’s current psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use
disorder, moderate. Applicant regularly engaged in binge drinking (in excess of six drinks in
an evening) since he began treatment with the psychiatrist in 2013. (GE 6.) However, the
psychiatrist told the DOD-contracted clinical psychologist in October 2018 that Applicant
has shown an ability to control his alcohol use, as demonstrated by periods of voluntary
sobriety for a couple of months at a time, and that he had never recommended to Applicant
that he refrain from all alcohol use. Given Applicant uses alcohol to alleviate his anxiety in
social situations, his treatment with his psychiatrist has focused on strengthening other
coping skills. (GE 3.)
The clinical psychologist, who evaluated Applicant for the DOD in October 2018,
indicated that Applicant’s use of alcohol is of concern because it exceeds general medical
recommendations for the use of alcohol per the National Institute of Health’s guidelines,
and he may be self-medicating his anxiety with alcohol instead of relying on psychological
or pharmacological methods. She diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, mild, but
expressed  her  opinion  that  Applicant’s  alcohol  use  did  not  present  an  acute  security
concern because the amount Applicant consumes is “mediated by age-normative social
experiences in which alcohol is commonly seen as a social lubricant;” his alcohol use has
not impaired his work; and it is not contrary to his treating psychiatrist’s recommendations.
The psychologist found that Applicant did not minimize his alcohol use and concluded that
his use of alcohol did not rise to the point of impaired judgment. (GE 3.)
Applicant testified that his treating psychiatrist has recommended that he consume
less alcohol. (Tr. 41.) About 90% of Applicant’s drinking has been social, but he also drinks
alcohol to relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression. Since at least May 2017, Applicant
has played trivia at a bar on Tuesday nights with friends. (GE 2.) As of October 2018,
Applicant reported that he was drinking alcohol (usually beer) five to seven days per week,
in  quantities  of  three  to  five  beers  on  weeknights  and  six  beers  at  a  sitting  on  the
weekends. He had hangovers a few times per month. He expressed his belief that he
drinks too much, but it helps him to feel more confident and less anxious. (GE 3; Tr. 41.)
As of March 2020, Applicant was playing “bar trivia” and billiards at a bar. He started doing
trivia as an undergraduate in college and has been playing in a pool league for about a
year. (GE 2; Tr. 37-38, 47-48.) He had a “dry January” in 2020 where he abstained from
alcohol  for  one  month.  He  had  no  intention  to  maintain  abstinence  from  alcohol  and
resumed drinking (usually beer) in his previous pattern of two or three drinks almost every
night  and  five  to  six  drinks  on  the  weekends  over  a  course  of  about  five  hours  while
socializing  with  friends,  frequently  at  his  apartment.  (Tr.  50-52.)  As  of  March  2020,
Applicant was drinking to intoxication “not each night of the week, but more so than not
probably.” (Tr. 39-40.) Applicant now believes his alcohol use is having a negative health
effect in terms of long-term disadvantages should he continue to use alcohol to alleviate
symptoms  of  depression  and  anxiety.  (Tr.  41-42.)  He  has  been  trying  to  reduce  his
consumption for years, but the motivation to change is “not super strong.” (Tr. 49.) He
considers his alcohol use a “personal concern” that does not impact his professionalism or
ability to handle classified information. (Tr. 44.)
Work Reference
Applicant enjoys his job. He has missed work at times due to his depression, but his
supervisor is supportive.  (GE 3.) Applicant has had the same supervisor since August
2012.  Applicant’s  supervisor  described  Applicant  as  “a  dependable  and  dedicated
coworker with keen insights, great analytic skills, and a terrific knack for working in a team.”
Applicant is willing to assist his coworkers, and is a mentor to junior staff. He has good time
management skills, is diligent about his work, and takes project objectives seriously, often
working beyond regular hours to meet tight deadlines. Applicant always represents their
employer well when interacting with clients. His supervisor expressed complete confidence
in Applicant and his character.

Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing

"I  have  incorporated  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  responses  to  all  of  the  SOR
allegations  in  my  findings  of  fact  and  have  noted  his  corrections  to  the  relevant  time
periods referred to in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. Applicant’s personal information is
extracted from GE 3, his SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to
the  record.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  the  Government’s
FORM, Applicant’s response to the FORM, and the documentary evidence in the record,
I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant, 32, is unmarried and has no children. He has lived with his partner since
approximately  2006.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  2005  and  has  taken  some
college courses. He has worked for a defense contractor as a functions specialist since
2008. He was granted eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI)
in 2009.
In April 2016, Applicant self-reported to his security officer a one-time experience
he had with an illegal drug, ecstasy, in November 2013. He was working as a contractor
at a DOD agency with eligibility for access to SCI at that time. He wrote to his security
officer that his guilt over the use of the drug causes him “massive anxieties” and that he
is  not  a  “risk  of  ever  again  partaking  in  such  drug  use.”  He  expressed  his  regret  in
reporting  this incident in  an untimely  manner  because  it has been “an  embarrassment
and  tax  on my  conscience.” After self-reporting  this drug  use,  Applicant  disclosed  in  a
July 24, 2017 interview that he had also illegally used an inhalant commonly known as
whip-its  on  one  occasion  in  January  or  February  2017.  He  reported  that  on  that  one
occasion  he  used  20  or  more  canisters  of  nitrous  oxide  along  with  a  whipped  cream
dispenser to get high. In his Answer, he corrected the approximate date of this drug use
as November 2016. He also reported in his July 2017 interview using a different inhalant,
alkyl  nitrates,  three  weeks  before  the  interview.  The  common  name  of  this  inhalant  is
poppers, and it is used as a sexual aid. In his Answer, he corrected the date of his use of
poppers to have been in about March 2017. He wrote that he does not intend to use whip-
its or poppers again. In each of the three instances of illegal drug use, the drugs were
given to Applicant without any payment by him for the drug or inhalants. (GE 9 at 1-2; GE
8 at 5-6; Answer.)
Applicant has consistently maintained that his use of alcohol was a contributing
factor in each of his three uses of illegal drugs. He has reported that his use of alcohol
affected his judgment on each occasion. He has a long history of abusing alcohol. He has
blacked out from excessive alcohol consumption on at least two occasions, first in August
2011 and a second time in about June 2017. In the past, he has been cautioned by friends
and a family member about his excessive drinking. Due to his alcohol consumption, he
has  nearly  lost  his  relationships  with  close  friends,  including  his  long-time  partner.  He
stopped drinking for a brief period in 2017 and then resumed. In June 2018, he made a
commitment to sobriety. He claims in his FORM response that he is seeking treatment
for depression, which he believes is the underlying cause of his alcohol abuse. While I
accept  Applicant’s  statement  that  he  is  receiving  treatment  for  depression,  the  record
contains  no  evidence  regarding  any  treatment  by  an  alcohol-abuse  specialist,  with  an
exception of a one-time session with a counselor. There is no evidence in the record that
he has been diagnosed as having an alcohol-abuse disorder. (FORM response; GE 8 at
3-GE 4 at 2-4; GE 9 at 1.)
In his FORM response, Applicant asserted that he has discontinued contact with
the individuals with whom he has used the illegal drug and inhalants in the past. Since
choosing to remain sober, he has changed his social group to avoid persons who drink
alcohol  and  use  drugs.  He  expressed  a  desire  “to  self-correct  and  heal”  from  his
depression and past abuse of alcohol, and writes that “at current it is my intent to continue
to focus on self-care and repair.” (FORM response.)
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the five allegations in the SOR under Guideline
E, four of which allege falsifications. Two of these subparagraphs (SOR ¶¶ 3.a and 3.c)
allege  that  he  falsely  denied  any  illegal  drug  use  in  his  December  30,  2013  security
clearance application and falsely omitted his March 2017 use of poppers in his February
2018  SCA. The other two  falsification  allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  3.b  and  3.d)  assert  that he
falsely  denied  in  the  2013  application  and again  in  the SCA  that  he  used  illegal drugs
while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  The  earlier  application  is  not  included  in  the
Government  Exhibits  attached  to  the  FORM,  but  the  record  evidence  refers  to  that
application and to Applicant’s false denial in the application of any prior drug use, when
in fact, he used ecstasy one month before he signed the application and while he already
possessed a clearance. (GE 5 at 8.)
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  falsely  answered  a  question  in  his
February  2018  SCA  that  asked  if  he  had  “illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled
substances” in the past seven years or while possessing a security clearance, by failing
to disclose his use of poppers in 2017. In his SCA, Applicant disclosed his past use of
ecstasy  and  whip-its,  but  failed  to  disclose  his  use  of  poppers.  In  his  March  2018
background  interview  for  his  pending  collateral  clearance,  he  made  the  same  two
disclosures and omitted his use of poppers. By admitting the falsification allegations in
SOR ¶¶ 3.c and 3.d, Applicant has conceded that the use of the inhalant alkyl nitrates, or
poppers, constitutes substance misuse for purposes of a security clearance adjudication
just as the use of whip-its is a substance misuse, and his use of poppers should have
been disclosed in his SCA. (GE 11 at 3-4.)
The fifth admitted Guideline E allegation cross alleges the security concerns raised
in the first two paragraphs of the SOR, which set forth the allegations under Guidelines H
and G. Applicant is not disputing any of the facts in the SOR, except that he corrected the
approximate dates of his use of the two inhalants in his Answer.
As a result of a security investigation by another government agency, Applicant’s
eligibility for SCI access was suspended in July 2017 and then revoked on November 30,
2017. The revocation decision of the other government agency was finalized on January
30, 2018. (GE 5, 11 at 3.)

"Applicant is a 38-year-old design engineer employed by a defense contractor since
February  2019.  He  was  previously  employed  as  a  shipyard  contractor  employee  from
2004 to 2019. Applicant graduated from high school in 1999, and completed some college
credits. He married in 2002, separated in about 2008, and divorced in 2010. He remarried
in 2018 and has two children that do not live with him. He served on active duty in the
United States Air Force from 2000 until he was honorably discharged in 2004.
The  original  SOR  alleges  Applicant  has  four  delinquent  debts  totaling  about
$45,000.  The  debts  include  a  home  equity  line  of  credit  and  credit  card  accounts.
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations. The amended SOR alleges
under guideline G, that Applicant was arrested in September 2019 for driving under the
influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  The  DUI  allegation  was  cross  alleged  under  Guideline  J.
Applicant admitted the DUI arrest, but denied the cross allegation under Guideline J.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  home  equity  line  of  credit  (HELOC)  debt  with  his  former
spouse. According to Applicant’s 2019 credit report, the last payment on the loan was in
October 2013. Applicant’s December 2008 separation agreement permitted him to live in
the property and pay expenses until it was sold, but his former spouse was responsible
for paying the HELOC as required. She did not do so, and the HELOC debt was eventually
charged  off.  Applicant  received  an  IRS  Form  1099-C  (Cancellation  of  Debt)  for  the
charged-off  amount.  The  account  is  resolved.  Of  note,  but  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,
Applicant and his mother lived in the home for about one year without paying the majority
of mortgage payments as required, and the home was foreclosed around 2009.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a consumer credit card debt. The debt was placed for collection in
June  2018.  Applicant  negotiated  a  settlement  and  paid  the  debt  in  June  2018.  This
account is resolved. SOR ¶ 1.c is another credit account with the most recent payment
being paid in August 2017. Applicant resolved it in Jan 2018 and it was removed from his
credit  report.  This  account  is  resolved.  SOR  ¶  1.d  is  a  home  improvement  credit  card
account  that  fell  into  default  and  was  charged  off  in  about  January  2018.  Applicant
testified that  he paid the debt in 2018, and it was removed from his credit report. This
account is resolved.
Applicant  purchased  a  house  in  February  2019,  and  has  not  missed  a  house
payment.  He  has  bank  savings  accounts  valued  at  about  $5,000,  a  401K  retirement
account  valued  at  about  $10,000,  and  a  pension  fund  with  over  $40,000.  His  current
spouse  works  at  the  same  government  facility  as  he  does.  He  has  not  had  financial
counseling.
In  September  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  DUI.  He  met  his  spouse  at  a
restaurant/bar  to  discuss  plans  for  their  wedding  anniversary.  When  he  left,  he  was
stopped for not maintaining his lane, and failed the field-sobriety test. His blood alcohol
level tested at .13%, well over the legal limit. He was confined and released on bail. He
pleaded not guilty in September 2019, and is awaiting trial. Applicant had a previous DUI
in  2006  that  was  resolved  in  2007  with  a  dismissal  after  completing  probation  and  an
alcohol and substance abuse program. He has not submitted to a medical or substance
abuse  evaluation,  although  after  the  hearing  in  this  case,  he  attempted  to  contact
counselors  that  would  accept  a  new  client,  but  so  far  he  has  been  unsuccessful  in
scheduling a program. He noted that he uses a ride share service after drinking when a
designated driver is unavailable. He claims that he drinks one to two beers a week on a
social basis. No character or work performance evidence was submitted.

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except the allegation in ¶ 3.a. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2008. He is not married
and has no children. He was employed from May 2008 to October 2013,  with a private
company. He then worked from October 2013 to July 2016, for a federal contractor. He
left  this  job  because  he  was  having  difficulties  with  his  alcohol use,  and  he  voluntarily
enrolled in an alcohol recovery program where he was a patient for one month. After his
discharge,  he  was  unemployed  for  eight  months  before  starting  work  with  his  current
employer in March 2017. (Items 2, 3, 4, 6)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  March  2010  for  possession  of  marijuana.  He  was  on
probation for a year and completed a drug rehabilitation course. The charge was nolle
prossed.  During  his  August  2018  background  interview,  he  told  the  government
investigator that after his arrest he had no intention of being involved with illegal drugs
again. He made changes in his life and found more positive outlets for his time. There is
no evidence of subsequent drug involvement. (Item 5, 7)
Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in August
2012.  The  charge  was  nolle  prossed.  He  has  had  no  other  alcohol-related  incidents.
Applicant continued to consume alcohol after his arrest, drinking four to six drinks a night.
He  decided  to  address  his  alcohol  consumption  and  voluntarily  entered  an  alcohol
rehabilitation  program  in  July  2016.  This  coincided  with  him  leaving  his  job  and
subsequent unemployment. He was diagnosed by a medical doctor with alcohol abuse
disorder.  He  successfully  completed  the  rehabilitation  program.  He  indicated  in  his
answer  to  government  interrogatories  that  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  August
2016. There is no evidence to the contrary. (Items 4, 5, 7)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  August  2017.
Section 22 asked if he had ever been charged with an offense involving drugs or alcohol.
Applicant  failed  to  disclose  his  marijuana  arrest  and  his  DUI.  In  his  SOR  answer,  he
explained that he misread the question believing it asked him if he had been convicted of
these  type  of  offenses.  I  found  his  explanation  credible  and  conclude  he  did  not
intentionally fail to disclose the requested information. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
The SOR alleges 29 delinquent debts totaling approximately $165,742. Applicant
admitted owing all of the debts. He was confronted with many of these debts during his
background interviews. He indicated his willingness to pay his debts and attributed them
to poor decisions he made when he was consuming alcohol. He was going to look into
the debts and work to resolve them. (Items 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)
In  June  2019,  Applicant  began  working  with  a  law  firm  to  help  him  dispute  and
settle his delinquent debts. He provided a copy of the agreement and information included
to show he had disputed certain debts that were removed from his credit report. He has
delinquent  student  loans  that  total  approximately  $117,598  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b;  this
amount is included in the overall delinquent debt balance). It appears he has two debts
owed for vehicles (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-$12,848 and 1.n-$17,688); numerous medical debts (SOR
¶¶  1.d-$8,051;  1.i-$351;  1.p-$720;  1.s-$409;  1.v-$132;  1.x-$92;  1.y-$80;  1.z-$80;  1.aa
$65; 1.bb-$60 and 1.cc-$39); delinquent rent (SOR ¶ 1.e-$2,218); and other consumer
and payday loans. (Items 2, 4, 5, 8, 9)
Applicant did not provide information that any of the alleged SOR debts have been
settled  or  paid.  The  document  he  provided  showed  that  nine  debts  were  removed,
presumably from his credit report. Only one debt removed may possibly be included in
the SOR, but the only information noted is that the creditor is “medical.” It does not specify
the amount of the medical debt or the collector. The other debts removed do not appear
to be those included in the SOR. Applicant did not provide any evidence to identify if any
other debts removed were alleged in the SOR. He did not provide any other information
about whether he has paid any of these debts, even the smallest ones. (Items 2, 4, 5, 8,
9)
During his background interview, Applicant indicated that his finances were stable,
and he was working to better manage them. He did not provide a budget or any other
information  about  his  finances  or  any  proof  that  he  has  paid  or  settled  any  of  his
delinquent  debts.  Applicant  received  his  college  degree  in  2008.  He  provided  no
explanation for his failure to make payments on his student loans when due and while he
was  employed.  He  indicated  to  the  government  investigator  that  he  was  making
arrangements to pay his student loans. He did not provide evidence that he has done so.

"The SOR allegations arise under Guideline G. SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant
was arrested and charged with  driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI)  in January
2012.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  one  year  probation  and  120  hours  of
community  service,  his  license  was  suspended  for  one  year,  and  he  was  required  to
attend six Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. Applicant admits this allegation.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in March 2014 for disturbing the
peace after having consumed alcohol. He pleaded guilty and was fined. He admits this
allegation.
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI,  light  law
violation, and failure to maintain lane in April 2016. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced
to  36  hours  in  jail,  one-year  probation,  and  120  hours  of  community  service.  He  was
required to wear an ankle monitor for three months and his license was suspended for
one  year.  Applicant  admits  this  allegation  with  the  correction  that  his  license  was  not
suspended, but he was required to use an interlock device on his vehicle for one year.
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  was  cited  for  public  intoxication  in  November
2018 and that the charge was dropped. He admits this allegation.
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  Applicant  was  examined  by  a  licensed  psychologist  in
August  2019  and  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use  disorder,  mild,  in  early  remission.  The
psychologist  stated  that  Applicant’s  history  of  binge  drinking  episodes  and  the  related
consequences make him vulnerable to poor decision making that represents a threat to
sensitive information. He admits this allegation. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated
in my findings of fact.
Applicant,  27,  is  a  geospatial  analyst  currently  working  for  a  defense  contractor
since 2017. He received his bachelor’s degree in 2015. He has resided with his girlfriend
since 2018. This is his first application for a security clearance. (GX 3; GX 4.)
Applicant  began  consuming  alcohol  as  a  teenager  at  parties  with  his  friends  in
2009. After joining a fraternity in college in 2011, Applicant began drinking beer on a daily
basis at fraternity parties. In January 2012, Applicant attended a fraternity party where he
consumed an excessive amount of alcohol. He was pulled over on his way back to his
dormitory for driving the wrong way on a divided highway. He was convicted of DUI in
April 2012 and sentenced as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
In March 2014, while still in college on spring break in Florida, Applicant consumed
numerous beers throughout the day on the beach with his friends. The group had rented
a  locker  to  secure  their  belongings  during  the  day.  On  the  way  back  to  their  hotel,
Applicant and his friends were stopped by police officers and questioned about a stolen
cell phone. The group gave the officers permission to search their belongings and a cell
phone  that  did  not  belong  to  anyone  in  the  group  was  found  in  Applicant’s  friend’s
backpack. The friend denied stealing the cell phone and the rest of the group, including
Applicant, became loud and unruly in defending their friend’s innocence. The friend was
arrested for theft of the cell phone and the rest of the members of the group, including
Applicant, were cited for disturbing the peace. The disposition of the charge is as alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.b.
In April 2016, Applicant and several friends attended a fraternity party where they
consumed alcohol throughout the day.  In the afternoon, Applicant left the party and slept
for several hours, then awoke to join his friends for a late night dinner. Applicant thought
he  was  capable  of  legally  driving,  and  drove  the  group  out  for  dinner.  On  the  way,
Applicant  was  pulled  over  for  a  broken  tail  light.  The  officer  questioned  Applicant  who
admitted to drinking earlier in the day, but stated he believed he was sober. The officer
administered  a  field  sobriety  test,  which  Applicant  failed.  The  officer  administered  a
breathalyzer and Applicant’s blood alcohol content (BAC) registered as .12, with the legal
BAC limit being .08. He was arrested and the disposition of the case is as alleged in SOR
¶ 1.c and corrected by Applicant.
Following the April 2016 DUI arrest and conviction, Applicant underwent an alcohol
use psychological evaluation. The evaluation concluded that Applicant did not have an
alcohol  use disorder  and  it  did  not  make  any treatment  recommendations.  He  has not
driven a vehicle after consuming any alcohol since the 2016 DUI. (GX 5.)
In April 2016, Applicant began voluntarily attending weekly AA meetings which he
continued until April 2017. He discontinued attending AA meetings because he believed
he had matured, was making better decisions about his alcohol consumption, and did not
have an alcohol use problem. (GX 4.)
In  November  2018,  just  after  his  twenty-sixth  birthday,  Applicant,  attended  a
Thursday night professional football game. Prior to attending the game, Applicant secured
a friend to be the designated driver. Applicant consumed numerous beers beginning in
the afternoon at the pregame festivities. At some point, Applicant went to the designated
driver’s vehicle to sleep. At about 3:00 am, he was awoken by the police. Applicant was
detained by the police and charged with public intoxication. Later that morning, Applicant
called his facility security officer (FSO) to report the charge, and the human resources
officer, who is also Applicant’s mother, to take paid leave for the day. Applicant retained
an attorney, and the charge was ultimately dropped. (GX 5.)
Concerned about this incident, and due in part to his girlfriend’s and his mother’s
concern about his alcohol consumption, Applicant self-assessed his drinking pattern. He
determined that it had resulted in conduct that was detrimental to him, and modified his
behavior, which includes no longer partying with his fraternity brothers. Applicant worked
to find balance in his life by not involving alcohol in his activities and changing his social
group.  Applicant  states
intoxicated  since  2018.  From
November/December  2018  until  April  2019,  he  voluntarily  practiced  abstinence  from
alcohol. Since then, Applicant rarely drinks. Once or twice a month, he drinks two to three
beers, but never more than three. He does not keep alcohol in his home. He states that
his  “priorities  were  out  of  line  in  college  and  shortly  after,  which  aided  in  some  bad
decisions.” He has since matured and prioritized his life much differently. (GX 4.)

In  August  2019,  at  the  behest  of  the  DOD  CAF,  Applicant  underwent  a
psychological evaluation performed by a clinical psychologist to assess potential security
concerns  regarding  Applicant’s  alcohol  use.  The  evaluator  reviewed  Applicant’s  2016
evaluation,  his  2017  e-QIP,  and  his  personal  subject  interview  with  the  background
investigator, and contacted Applicant’s two work supervisors. The evaluator interviewed
Applicant and administered several psychological tests. The most relevant test that the
evaluator administered was the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) which
“examines problematic alcohol use.” The results of this test indicated that Applicant was
low risk. (GX 5.)
In discussing Applicant’s six-month period of abstinence followed by his ongoing
practice  of  modified  consumption,  the  evaluator  stated  that  Applicant  had  not
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified alcohol consumption. He goes
on to state that “typically, one year of sustainable substance-use change is a beginning
toward  sustainable  change.”  He  noted  that  Applicant’s  six  months  of  sobriety  was
promising but “he has resumed a limited alcohol use that is likely to increase given past
behavior.”  The  evaluator  specifically  cited  Applicant’s  reported  past  binge-drinking
episodes and alcohol-related incidents as a basis for concern about Applicant’s potential
vulnerability
“legal
from  poor  decision  making.  The  evaluator  observed
consequences  seem  to  occur  after  binge  drinking  episodes  with  his  friends  when  his
judgment  is  impaired  .  .  .  [and  Applicant’s]  substance  use  appears  to  be  significantly
influenced by his peers.” (GX 5.)
that
The  evaluator  concluded  that  the  frequency  of  Applicant’s  past  “binge  drinking
episodes  leaves  him  vulnerable  to  poor  decisions  and  additional  consequences  in  his
personal  and  professional  life.”  The  evaluator  further  stated  that  Applicant’s  “decision-
making, while under the influence of alcohol, represents a threat to sensitive information.”
He  concluded  that  Applicant’s  past  alcohol  use  raises  concerns  about  future
consumption. He recommended that Applicant “receive psychotherapy and/or reengage
in  self-help  services  (e.g.  Alcoholics  Anonymous)  .  .  .  [and  that  he]  should  seriously
consider long-term sobriety from alcohol as a treatment goal.” However, the evaluator did
not conclude that abstinence was mandatory for Applicant. (GX 5.)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
and 2.a, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  engineer  employed  by  defense  contractors  since
January 2009. (AX A.) He has never married and has no children. He worked for a federal
contractor as a computer programmer from September 2005 to February 2006 and for
non-government  employers  from  March  2006  to  December  2008.  He  received  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  science  in  September  2006.  His  SCA  reflects  that  he
received  a  security  clearance  in  July  2006  and  is  seeking  to  continue  that  clearance.
(FORM Item 2 at 35.)
On January 1, 2008, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI).
He was convicted on April 3, 2008, fined $1,488, placed on probation for 18 months, and
sentenced  to  jail for  10 days,  with  9 days suspended.  He  was  required  to  undergo  an
alcohol  evaluation  and  counseling,  attend  a  victim-impact  panel,  and  install  a  vehicle
ignition  interlock.  (FORM  Item  2  at  29-30.)  On  December  30,  2010,  he  submitted  an
application to set aside the judgment and order on the ground that he had fulfilled the
conditions  of  the  probation.  His  application  was  granted  on  January  5,  2011,  and  his
conviction was set aside. (GX 2 at 29; Answer at 7-8.)
On  September  3,  2017,  while  Applicant’s  application  to  continue  his  security
clearance was pending decision, he was arrested for speeding and DUI. (FORM Item 5.)
When asked by a police officer whether he had been drinking, he declined to answer. He
declined  a  request  to  undergo  a  field-sobriety  test  or  provide  a  breath  sample.  He
requested an opportunity to talk to a lawyer. The police officer allowed him to call a lawyer
and observed him talking to someone. The police officer declined to allow him to attempt
to contact another lawyer. The police officer obtained a search warrant from a magistrate,
obtained a blood sample, and allowed Applicant to go home in a ride-share vehicle. The
laboratory analysis of Applicant’s blood sample reflected a blood-alcohol content (BAC)
of .183. (FORM Item 5.)
At  Applicant’s  trial  in  June  12-13,  2019,  he  requested  that  he  be  given  the
chromatograms  for  his  blood  samples.  The  trial  judge  deferred  ruling  until  the  state’s
expert  from  the  laboratory  testified.  It  is  not  clear  from  the  record  whether  Applicant
renewed his request after the state’s expert testified. The jury acquitted him of DUI but
convicted him having a BAC of more than .08 and “Extreme DUI,” with a BAC of more
than .15. In July 2019, he was fined $2,779; sentenced to jail for 180 days, with 171 days
suspended;  and  placed  on  probation  for  36  months,  with  12  months  on  supervised
probation and 24 months on unsupervised probation. The terms of his probation include
alcohol screening and evaluation, treatment, attending a victim-impact program, violating
no laws, and possessing or consuming no alcohol. (SOR Answer at 9.) The sentence and
probation were stayed pending his appeal.
In October 2019, Applicant appealed his conviction, alleging that he was illegally
detained following the initial traffic stop, that the arresting officer lacked probable cause
to arrest him, that the arresting officer violated his right to counsel, and that the trial court
erred  by  denying  his  request  for  disclosure  of  the  chromatograms  from  his  blood  test.
(SOR  Answer  at  10.)  On  April  9,  2020,  the  state  superior  court  upheld  Applicant’s
conviction. (FORM Item 6.)
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he admitted his September 2017 DUI. He
included a letter from his attorney dated April 29, 2020, stating that he was appealing to
the state court of appeals and raising the constitutional violations that were raised before
the  state  superior  court.  His  appeal  does  not  contradict  his  admission  that  he  was
intoxicated, but focuses on constitutional issues. (AX C.)
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  he  moderated  his  alcohol
consumption  after  his  DUI  conviction  in  2008,  either  limiting  his  consumption  to  two
alcoholic  beverages  at  a  sitting  or  parking  his  vehicle  and  taking  a  cab  home  after
drinking.  He submitted no evidence reflecting how often he exceeded his two-drink limit
and  by  how  much.  He  stated  that  he  had  not  consumed  any  alcohol  at  entertainment
establishments  since his  arrest, and  that  he now  spends considerable time  biking and
hiking. (SOR Answer at 1-2.) In his response to the FORM, he stated that he now focuses
on  off-duty  activities  that  do  not  involve  drinking  and  has  not  visited  a  drinking
establishment since his arrest. (AX A at 2.) He submitted no evidence in his SOR answer
or his response to the FORM reflecting his drinking habits at home.
Applicant  was  required  to  undergo  counseling  after  his  DUI  conviction  in  2008.
There is no evidence in the FORM that he was diagnosed with an alcohol-abuse disorder
or that he was advised by a medical professional to abstain from alcohol or moderate his
consumption. The conditions of his probation after his second conviction included alcohol
screening, evaluation, treatment, attending a victim-impact panel, and abstinence from
alcohol,  but  these  requirements  were  stayed  pending  his  appeal.  He  submitted  no
evidence of treatment or counseling after his conviction in June 2019. His answer to the
SOR  and  response  to  the  FORM  indicate  his  intention  to  moderate  his  alcohol
consumption but not to abstain.
In  April  2019,  Applicant  was  nominated  for  a  $500  bonus  in  recognition  of  his
contributions  to  the  company,  “going  above  and  beyond  the  expectations  for  [his]  job
position. His team lead commented that he “consistently over-delivered more quickly than
expected and provided extraordinary value to the team.” (SOR Answer at 4.) A co-worker

provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  senior  systems  administrator  working  for  a  defense
contractor. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1) In 1992, he graduated from high school, and in 1996, he
graduated from college. (Tr. 19) He has never served in the military. (Tr. 19) He majored
in computer science. (Tr. 19) He has never married, and he has four children who are
ages 13, 19, 23, and 25. (Tr. 18) Since 1996, he has been employed working for a defense
contractor without periods of unemployment until his security clearance was revoked on
July 19, 2019. (Tr. 20) He has held a DOD security clearance for at least 20 years. (Tr.
25, 71) There is no evidence of a security violation.
When Applicant’s security clearance was revoked, he lost his employment with a
DOD  contractor,  and  he  filed  for  unemployment.  (Tr.  26)  Despite  having  20  years  of
information  technology  experience  and  a  college  degree,  he  was  unable  to  find
information  technology  employment  without  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  26)  He  found  it
heartbreaking to be unable to use his skills to contribute to DOD. (Tr. 26) On November
1, 2019, he found employment, but now he has to commute 51 miles from his home on
dangerous highways, and for reduced pay. (Tr. 26)
Applicant explained the source of his financial problems and why he should have
a security clearance:
For 25 years I’ve performed my duties as a government contractor with prior
loyalty  and  commitment.  I  was  excited  about  the  work  I  was  doing  as  a
senior system administrator for the [DOD contractor] and looking forward to
the opportunities ahead of me with a top secret security clearance as high-
performance computing continues to advance. I was good at my job; my co-
workers  held  me  with  high  regards.  As  you  can  see  by  the  performance
reviews and letters of recommendation provided.

times financially, been the sole source of income with dependent children. I
may have gotten into trouble when my mom was sick and the mother of my
children left home after 20 years together.
I was taking care of my sick mom and dealing with the pain of a love lost. I
admit my mistakes; I have learned from my mistakes, and I’ve grown and
moved on from my mistakes. I am worthy of a top secret clearance, and I
will serve my country well with it just as I did with my secret clearance.
However,  Your  Honor,  if  you  do  [not]  see  fit  for me  to  have  a  top  secret
clearance,  I  ask  you  [to  grant  my  request]  to  keep  my  secret  clearance,

The SOR alleges the following financial allegations:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant owes $4,860 for a  charged-off debt. Applicant
incurred the debt to install floors in his residence. (Tr. 41) On March 22, 2019, the creditor
offered to settle the debt for $2,916; however, the payment would have to be made by
the March 29, 2019, or the settlement offer would be null and void. (AE N) Applicant failed
to provide any documentation showing that he settled this account or made payments to
the creditor. (Tr. 41-42; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.i allege that Applicant owes about $2,000 for a charged-off credit
card account. On March 22, 2018, the creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant for
$1,838. (GE 7) Applicant settled this credit card debt after making two $800 payments in
late 2018. (Tr. 42-43; GE 3; AE E) On October 5, 2018, the creditor wrote that the debt
was settled. (AE E)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $927  for  a  telecommunications  account
referred for collection. Applicant made some payments on this account, and he returned
equipment to the creditor. (Tr. 43-45) On April 13, 2019, the creditor wrote the balance
owed  was  $536.  (AE  O)  The  current  remaining  balance  owed  to  this  creditor  is  about
$450. (Tr. 45-46; GE 3; GE 4; AE G; AE H; AE O) He would have made more payments
except he was unemployed after he lost his security clearance. (Tr. 46)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant owes $141 for his car insurance. He provided
documentation with his SOR response showing that he paid this debt. (Tr. 46-47; GE 3;
GE 4)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $102  for  a  medical  account  referred  for
collection. Applicant provided a receipt with his SOR response showing that this account
was paid. (Tr. 47; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that Applicant owes $21,777 in delinquent Federal income taxes
for  tax  years  2015  and  2016.  In  March  2015,  a  creditor  forgave  a  mortgage  debt  for
$25,526, and the IRS determined he received income when the creditor forgave this debt.
(Tr. 48-49; GE 1 at 36-37; GE 2 at 29; GE 5 at 32; AE J) He also withdrew $24,000 from
his 401(k) account and was unable to repay his account in time to avoid a federal income
tax  penalty.  (Tr.  48-49)  In  his  December  21,  2016  SCA,  Applicant  stated  he  was  in  a
payment  plan,  and  he  was  making  $228  monthly  payments  to  the  Internal  Revenue
Service (IRS). (GE 1 at 37-38; GE 2 at 29) Applicant subsequently stopped making his
monthly payments. (Tr. 48; GE 2 at 29) His  plan was “to  let them take my income tax
[refund] in addition to [his] monthly payments.” (Tr. 28; GE 5)
As of May 2018, the IRS tax transcript for tax  year 2015 showed that Applicant
owed $14,353. His 2016 tax transcript showed that his delinquent tax debt was $7,424.
Applicant’s 2017 tax refund was intercepted and applied to his delinquent accounts owed

several months. (GE 5 at 31) In June 2016, he received a $9,000 bill for real estate taxes.
(GE 5 at 31) Applicant said he is making monthly $50 payments, and he paid $51 in March
2019, September 2019, and December 2019. (Tr. 51; GE 2; GE 5 at 31; AE I, AE J; AE
R)
Applicant’s gross annual income was about $82,000 before his security clearance
was revoked. (Tr. 53) His adjusted gross income on his federal income tax return for tax
years 2015 and 2016 were anomalous because a creditor forgave a mortgage debt and
his withdrawal from his 401(k) account resulted in a higher income than he actually had
available to pay his debts. (Tr. 53) He started new employment on November 1, 2019,
and his new salary is $70,000 annually. (Tr. 55)
Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in March 2015 for speeding and
operating  a  vehicle  while  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (OVI).  The  police  stopped
Applicant for speeding, and they smelled alcohol on his breath. (Tr. 56) Applicant said he
did  not  remember  his  breathalyzer  test  or  blood  alcohol  test  (BAT)  result.  (Tr.  56)
However, he conceded his BAT result was above the legal limit. (Tr. 72) The court record
shows a .14 BAT result. (GE 8 at 1, 3) Applicant pleaded guilty to OVI first offense, and
the speeding charge was dismissed. (SOR response) Applicant was sentenced to a fine
and court costs, 180 days in jail with 177 days suspended, and one year of probation.
(GE 8 at 1) Applicant was required to attend a three-day alcohol awareness course and
his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six  months.  (Tr.  56;  GE  1;  GE  2;  GE  8;  SOR
response)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in May 2016 and charged with OVI
and physical control. Applicant had consumed some alcohol. He was on his way home,
and he decided to pull over to the side of the road where he fell asleep. (Tr. 58-59) The
police arrived and arrested him. The police said he did not blow into the breathalyzer hard
enough to register, and the police declared it to be a refusal. (Tr. 72) He pleaded guilty to
physical control, and the OVI was dismissed. (Tr. 59; SOR response; GE 8 at 5) He was
fined, paid court costs, and placed on five years of community control. (Tr. 73; GE 1, GE
2, GE 8) Applicant was unsure what “community control” entailed. (Tr. 73-74) During his
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, he said he was prohibited from having
any similar incidents. (GE 2 at 26)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges that Applicant was arrested in April 2018 for physical control of
vehicle  while  under  the  influence  of  alcohol.  Applicant  was  moving  his  vehicle  in  the
driveway  of  his  residence  and  honking  the  horn  at  his  cohabitant  who  was  inside  the
residence. (GE 2 at 17) His cohabitant called the police. (GE 2 at 17) The police described
Applicant as being “highly intoxicated.” (GE 2 at 17, 21) His speech was slurred, and he
was unable to stand without assistance. (GE 2 at 21) Applicant told the police “he had
been drinking all day and night.” (GE 2 at 18) He refused a breathalyzer test. (Tr. 73) The
police  seized  a  Xanax  pill  that  was  in  his  pocket.  (GE  2  at  18)  Applicant  was  initially
charged  with  physical  control  and  possession  of  drugs,  but  he  pleaded  guilty  to  an
amended  charge  of  reckless  operation,  and  the  possession  of  drugs  charge  was
dismissed. (Tr. 60-61; GE 8 at 7)
There is no evidence that Applicant was diagnosed with an alcohol-use disorder.
Applicant  did  not  attend  any  Alcoholics  Anonymous  meetings  or  receive  any  other
outpatient  treatment for alcohol consumption.  (Tr. 73)  His  most  recent  consumption  of
alcohol was 30 days before his hearing when he consumed two or three beers. (Tr. 74-
75)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The SOR alleges in ¶ 3.a that Applicant used Xanax, without a prescription, on at
least  three  occasions,  until  at  least  2018,  while  he  held  a  security  clearance.  When
Applicant was arrested in April 2018, the police searched him and found a green pill inside
a baggie in his pants pocket. (Tr.  62; GE 2 at 18) Applicant stated, “Oh, that’s just my
Xanax.” (Tr. 62; GE 2 at 18) Xanax is a Schedule IV Controlled Substance. Applicant told
the police that he did not have a prescription for the Xanax. (Tr. 62; GE 2 at 18) At his
hearing,  Applicant  said  that  he  did  not  “have  any  recollection”  of  having  Xanax  in  his
pocket when he was arrested, and he “was made aware of it when [he] read his [police]
statement.” (Tr. 63) He did not remember telling the police officer the pill was Xanax. (Tr.
75) Applicant suggested he may not remember what he told the police because he was
intoxicated. (Tr. 75)
The possession of Xanax charge was subsequently dismissed. Applicant admitted
that he took Xanax at least once as recently as 2018. (Tr. 67-69) He was uncertain how
many times he used Xanax, and he refused to estimate how many times he took Xanax
without a prescription. (Tr. 67-69) He has never had a prescription for Xanax. (Tr. 71)
Character Evidence
The mother of Applicant’s children described him as a good provider and father
figure. (Tr. 29, 33) She has lived with him most of the time for 23 years. (Tr. 30) In the
past year, he dramatically reduced his alcohol consumption because of health concerns
relating  to  high  blood  pressure  and  cholesterol.  (Tr.  30,  33-34)  She  has  not  seen  him
drink any alcohol for six months. (Tr. 31) They have not had any alcohol in their home for
six  months.  (Tr.  31-32)  She  does  not  use  illegal  drugs,  and  she  is  unaware  of  the
presence of any illegal drugs in their home. (Tr. 32)
Five  coworkers,  colleagues,  and/or  friends  provided  character  statements
supporting reinstatement of Applicant’s access to classified information. (AE A; AE B; AE
C; AE D; AE Q) The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is honest, diligent,
knowledgeable,  intelligent,  generous,  courteous,  loyal,  respectful,  kind,  reliable,  and
trustworthy. (AE A; AE B; AE C; AE D) His performance evaluations describe him as an
excellent employee who made substantial contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE
K; AE L; AE P) He received salary increases in 2015 ($1,094) and 2016 ($1,034). (AE K;

",False
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that he could not admit or deny the
allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  2.a,  and  3.a,  because  he  had  not  seen  the  medical
reports  on  which  the  allegations  were  based.  I  have  treated  his  answer  to  these
allegations  as  denials.  He  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶  2.b,  3.b,  and  3.d.  He
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 3.c. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  logistics  management  specialist  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  since  March  2006.  He  married  in  2015,  after  cohabitating  since
2012.  He  divorced  in  2016.  He  has  a  six-year-old  child,  and  he  shares  custody  of  the
child with his ex-wife. He currently lives with his fiancée, who has two children, ages 8
and 10. He received a security clearance in August 2009.
In 1997, while Applicant was in high school, he and some friends were at a party,
and they were mixing  liquid drain cleaner with aluminum foil in  two-liter plastic bottles.
The  chemical  reaction  made  the  bottles  explode.  Someone  was  alarmed  by  the  loud
noise  and  called  the  police,  and  Applicant  and  five  others  were  taken  into  custody.
Applicant’s  five  companions  were  released  to  their  parents.  Because  his  father  was
traveling and his mother did not want to drive at night on the highway, Applicant spent
the night in juvenile detention. (Tr. 83-84.)
Applicant attended  college from 1997  to  2001  but  did  not  graduate.  He  testified
that  he  was  very  sheltered  at  home,  to  the  extent  that  he  did  not  know  how  to  do
laundry or balance a checkbook. (Tr. 129.) Around 2000, he began consuming alcohol
infrequently,  but  he  quickly  increased  his  consumption  to  the  point  of  frequent
intoxication, regularly consuming 7-9 beers at a sitting. (Tr. 84.)
On  September  22,  2001,  Applicant  had  been  drinking  with  friends,  and  he  was
heavily intoxicated. A friend dropped Applicant off at his apartment. While walking to the
apartment, Applicant flicked a lighted cigarette into the bed of a pickup truck parked in a
carport and started a fire. The fire spread to the carport and four adjoining residences.
The truck and all four residences were destroyed. (GX 9 at 1-2; Tr. 85.)
On October 10, 2001, after another night of heavy drinking with friends, Applicant
flicked  a  cigarette  onto  the  carpet  in  a  hallway  of  his  apartment  building  and  ignited  a
small fire that he quickly extinguished. About a week later, he poured hair spray from a
pump bottle into a beer can and ignited it. He stumbled and ignited a fire in the hallway.
He  was  unable  to  extinguish  the  fire,  and  the  fire  department  was  summoned.  A  day
later, he dropped a lighted match onto a bed comforter and ignited it. (GX 9 at 2; tr. 85-
86.)
In  November  2001,  Applicant’s  father,  who  was  on  active  duty  at  the  time,
arranged to have him evaluated by a psychologist in the Navy Addictions Rehabilitation
Department. Applicant told the psychologist that he  had been diagnosed with attention
deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a child and treated with medication. He also
told the psychologist that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2000 and was
prescribed medication, but that he stopped taking the medication because he could not
drink  alcohol  while  on  the  medication.  He  told  the  psychologist  that  he  had  difficulty
controlling anger because of his bipolar disorder. The psychologist did not believe that
Applicant  was  open  and  forthcoming  during  their  interview.  He  commented  that
Applicant appeared to be seeking help in order to present himself in a positive light in
court.  The  Navy  psychologist  diagnosed  him  with  alcohol  abuse  but  did  not  diagnose
him with bipolar disorder. (GX 6.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that he was never
diagnosed  as  bipolar,  but  he  assumed  that  he  was  bipolar,  because  he  was  given  a
prescription for a drug used to treat bipolar disorder while he was in college. (Tr. 104-
05, 110.)
After  the  November  2001  evaluation,  Applicant  completed  a  two-week  alcohol-
awareness  program,  followed  by  a  third  week  of  intensive  treatment.  (Tr.  89-90.)  The
Navy  psychologist  recommended  that  he  abstain  from  alcohol.  Applicant  testified  that
he complied with the recommendation.  (Tr. 111.) The record does not reflect when he
resumed drinking or his level of consumption.  He now limits his consumption to one or
two drinks when he and his fiancée have a dinner “date” twice a month. (Tr. 123.) In his
2014  SCA,  he  was  asked,  “Have  you  EVER  received  counseling  or  treatment  as  a
result  of  your use  of  alcohol in  addition to  what  you  have  already  listed on  this form?”
He answered “No” and did not disclose his treatment in the Navy program. (GX 1 at 35.)
In  September  2002,  Applicant  was  tried  for  the  four  fire-related  events.  He
pleaded guilty to two felony counts of risking a catastrophe, two misdemeanor counts of
reckless endangerment, and two misdemeanor counts of criminal mischief. Two felony
counts  of  arson  were  nolle  prosequi  in  accordance  with  a  plea  agreement.  In  October
2002, he was sentenced to jail for four consecutive sentences of 3-6 months (totaling 12
to  24  months)  for  the  two  counts  of  risking  a  catastrophe  and  two  counts  of  reckless
endangerment,  and  he  was  sentenced  to  probation  for  the  two  counts  of  criminal
mischief. He was in jail until October 2003. (GX 1 at 32-33; GX 7.)
While Applicant was awaiting trial, he was employed as a cook in a local tavern.
The tavern owner’s son accused Applicant of damaging a restroom. When the owner’s
son kept questioning Applicant and “got in his face,” Applicant pushed him away, and an
altercation ensued. Applicant had not been drinking because he was at work. Applicant
was  “asked  to  leave,”  but  two  days  later  he  was  rehired.  (Tr.  87-88.)  No  criminal
charges were filed.
In June 2003, while in jail, Applicant completed an alcohol and drug educational
seminar and a 30-hour wellness-education program presented by the state department
of  corrections.  (AX  B;  AX  C.)  In  May  2011,  he  received  an  associate’s  degree  in
business management. In November 2012, he was on the dean’s list for the winter term,
and  he  was  inducted  into  a  national  technical  honor  society.  In  December  2013,  he
received an associate’s degree in information security technology. (AX D-H.)
Applicant started seeking psychotherapy around 2011-2012, after he learned that
his ex-wife was pregnant by her ex-husband. (Tr. 97.) He started having panic attacks,
and  his  psychotherapist  prescribed  an  anti-anxiety  medication.  (Tr.  93.)  He  did  not
disclose his treatment for anxiety in his 2014 SCA, apparently because it was related to
his marital problems. (GX 1 at 29.)
In  May  2014,  Applicant  was  involved  in  an  altercation  with  a  fellow  worker  that
was  triggered  when  his  fellow  worker  played  a  practical  joke  by  disconnecting  all  the
cables  from  Applicant’s  computer.  Applicant  was  convicted  of  assault  and  battery.  He
was  fined,  placed  on  administrative  leave,  and  was  permanently  barred  from  entering
the  military  installation  where  he  had  been  working.  The  permanent  bar  was  later
reduced to six months. (Tr. 108-09; GX 2; GX 3 at 20. In August 2014, he completed a
12-week psycho-educational program in anger management. (AX A.)
In February 2018, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist at
the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF.  The  psychologist  commented  that  Applicant  was  not
truthful  and  forthcoming  during  the  evaluation.  She  noted  that  he  denied  ever  having
symptoms of ADHD, and that he did not disclose his treatment for anxiety in his SCA.
She  administered  a  personality  assessment  inventory  but  found  that  the  results  were
not interpretable because the validity scales indicated that he was presenting himself in
an unrealistically favorable light. She reported that Applicant admitted starting only one
fire  and  claimed  that  he  was  present  at  the  other  fires  but  did  not  start  them.  She
reviewed  his  medical  records,  which  reflected  that  a  psychiatrist  diagnosed  Applicant
with  bipolar  disorder  in  2000.  She  also  commented  that  Applicant’s  medical  records
reflect  that  he  frequently  admitted  that  he  was  diagnosed  as  bipolar.  She  stated  her
ability to make a definitive diagnosis was limited, because Applicant appeared to have
withheld information about his mental health history. She concluded that Applicant “has
mental,  emotional,  or  personality  conditions  that  could  impair  judgment,  reliability,  or
trustworthiness.” Her diagnosis was (1) alcohol use disorder, remission status unknown;
(2)  bipolar  disorder,  most  recent  episode  depressed;  and  (3)  anxiety  disorder,
unspecified. (GX 4.)
A  long-time  friend  and  former  co-worker  describes  Applicant  as  sincere,  kind-
hearted, trustworthy, and hardworking. She describes him as a “doting father and caring
friend.” (AX J.) A deputy sheriff and former classmate considers Applicant trustworthy,
committed,  and  hardworking.  (AX  K.)  A  friend  who  has  known  him  for  more  than  25
years  considers  him  trustworthy,  dedicated,  hardworking,  compassionate,  and  a
wonderful father. (AX L.) A friend who has known him for more than 30 years considers
him caring, determined, and hardworking. (AX M.) Applicant’s fiancée knows him as an
honest and hardworking person and a loving father for his daughter as well as her two
children. (AX N.)
A psychologist, who has known Applicant for about nine years, submitted a letter
attesting to his positive attitude and integrity through difficult times and his honesty and
loyalty  to  family  and  country.  The  psychologist’s  relationship  with  Applicant  has  been
one of friendship rather than professional. (AX O.)
Applicant’s father, a retired U.S. Navy officer, is a co-owner and vice-president of
the  company  for  whom  Applicant  works.  He  submitted  a  statement  describing
Applicant’s  discovery  that  his  daughter  was  molested  by  her  half-brother,  his
subsequent  divorce,  and  the  contentious  custody  battle  that  followed  the  divorce.  He
states  that  Applicant  was  diagnosed  as  a  child  with  ADHD  without  hyperactivity.  He
states  that  Applicant  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  bi-polar  disorder  or  alcohol
dependence.  He  describes  Applicant  as  a  loving  father,  and  he  describes  Applicant’s
fiancée as a “wonderful woman.” (AX P.)
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  qualified  medical  health
professional  and  was  administered  a  substance-abuse  subtle-screening  inventory
(SASSI-4) and determined to have a low probability of a substance-abuse disorder. The
SASSI  reflected  a  “moderate  clinical  issue  with  defensiveness,”  but  the  clinician  who
administered  the  SASSI  did  not  observe  any  remarkable  defensiveness  during  the
administration of the SASSI or the biopsychosocial assessment. The evaluator did not
recommend substance-abuse treatment. (AX Q.)
Applicant  received  psychotherapy  from  three  medical  professionals  between
November  2017  and  March  2019.  He  saw  the  first  therapist  15  times  and  was
diagnosed  with  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),
and adjustment disorder with anxiety. He was transferred to another therapist after the
first therapist starting seeing his daughter, who had accused her half-brother of sexually
molesting her.
Starting in August 2018, the second therapist saw him  six times and diagnosed
him with generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and major depressive disorder, recurrent
and  moderate.  This  therapist  attributed  his  PTSD  in  large  part  to  trauma  during  his
previous  marriage  and  the  contentious  divorce  that  followed.  He  is  now  considered
emotionally stable, but occasionally is affected by stress and depression, mostly when
he  and  his  ex-wife  have  conflicts  in  their  co-parenting.  He  continues  to  receive
psychotherapy for anger management. He is in the clinical range for anxiety and PTSD,
but  his  aggressive  tendencies  and  anger  are  in  the  non-clinical  range.  He  has  no
indication  of  an  alcohol-abuse  disorder  and  is  not  bipolar.  This  therapist  concludes  by
stating that Applicant’s “current mental health assessments, observations, mental health
treatment,  and  his  personal  commitment  to  change  via  training  place  [him]  in  a
favorable light.” She continues to treat Applicant and sees him every two or three weeks
for about an hour. (Tr. 19-20.) She has never seen symptoms of a bipolar disorder. She
gives him a “good” prognosis. (Tr. 20-23.)
A third therapist evaluated Applicant in December 2018. He diagnosed Applicant
with  adjustment  disorder  with  mixed  disturbance  of  emotions  and  conduct,  which  was
considered an improvement from the two previous evaluations. (AX R.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  takes  an  anti-anxiety  medication  every  morning.
Although  his  prescription  allows  him  to  take  the  medication  “as  needed,”  he  has  not
needed  to  take  a  second  dose  during  the  day.  If  he  feels  a  sense  of  conflict,  he  has
learned to walk away, talk to himself, and ask himself how he should handle it. He no
longer needs to “harbor everything inside anymore.” Instead, he talks to one of his close
friends. (Tr. 93-94.)
The  co-owner  of  the  company  by  whom  Applicant  is  employed  has  known  him
since  he  was  first  employed  in  2006.  She  owns  51%  of  the  company  and  Applicant’s
father  owns  49%.  She  is  aware  of  the  Applicant’s  incarceration  in  2002  and  his
altercation  with  a  fellow  employee  in  2014.  She  believes  that  the  co-worker,  a  known
trouble-maker who is no longer employed by the company, was partly to blame for the
2014  incident.  She  believes  that  Applicant  has  matured  since  he  was  first  hired.  She
considers  him  emotionally  stable,  honest,  reliable,  and  trustworthy.  She  has  seen  no
signs of alcohol abuse. (Tr. 39-45.)
A  close  friend  of  Applicant,  who  served  on  active  duty  in  the  Navy  with
Applicant’s father, has known Applicant since 2000. She visited Applicant when he was
incarcerated.  For the past  three  years,  they  have  had  monthly  job-related  contact  and
personal  contact  about  every  other  month.  She  considers  Applicant  honest,  reliable,
and  hardworking.  She  believes  he  has  good  judgment.  She  has  never  observed  any
emotional  instability  or  excessive  alcohol  consumption.  She  believes  Applicant  was
remorseful about his mistakes and has worked hard to turn his life around. She testified
she would hire him “in a minute without hesitation. (Tr. 50-56,)
A  co-worker,  who  is  a  retired  master  chief  petty  officer,  has  had  daily  personal
and  professional  contact  with  Applicant  since  September  2018.  They  have  become
close  friends.  They  have  discussed  Applicant’s  past  conduct,  including  the  arson
incidents in 2002, the altercation in 2014, and his current mental health treatment. The
co-worker testified that he considers Applicant’s reliability “above reproach,” and he has
complete trust in his judgment. He has no doubts about Applicant’s emotional stability.
(Tr. 62-72.)
Applicant  has  held  a  second  job  as  a  contractor,  on  an  “as  needed”  basis,  for
about  four  years  for  a  company  that  owns  four  radio  stations.  His  supervisor  has
professional contact with him “every month at least” and social contact every month or
two.  His  supervisor browsed  the SOR but  did  not  read  it  carefully.  He  has  never seen
Applicant intoxicated. He considers Applicant mature, trustworthy, reliable, “honest to a
fault,” and a person with good judgment. He testified that Applicant had “some issues”
during his divorce proceedings, but he is usually “very even-keeled.” (Tr. 73-81.)
",True
"Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  a  30-year-old  project  manager
employed by a defense contractor since July 2005, when he graduated high school. He
married in September 2015, and he and his wife have a son, born November 2016. He
seeks to retain the clearance he was issued in November 2005.
Applicant used alcohol under questionable circumstances from June 2008 to July
2012,  resulting  in  three  incidents  indicative  of  poor  judgment.  In  June  2008,  he  was
charged with operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol (SOR 1.a). He received
and  completed  probation  before  judgment,  and  the  charge  was  dismissed.  In  August
2011, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, when he had a .12%
blood alcohol content (SOR 1.c). He was otherwise satisfactorily completing the terms
of  his  sentence  when  he  was  again  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  (.12%
blood alcohol content), and speeding, in May 2012 (SOR 1.d). Because of this second
arrest, Applicant was found to be in violation of the terms of his probation for the August
2011  arrest,  and  received  additional  punishment  (SOR  1.e).  Applicant  ultimately
completed the sentencing requirements of these arrests, and has been off probation for
over three years (Tr. 39, AE A). Applicant’s criminal record included a July 2010 driving
on a suspended license charge which was nolle prossed (SOR 1.b),  and a July 2012
citation for possessing alcohol in a campground (SOR 1.e).4
Between 2008 and 2010, at a time Applicant was in an apprenticeship program
with  his  employer,  Applicant  used  marijuana  2-3  times  with  coworkers.  Applicant  was
not aware that he had been granted a clearance in November 2005, but was aware that
he had applied for a clearance. Applicant has not used marijuana since 2010, and the
coworkers with whom he used marijuana are no longer employed by the company.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  his  poor  decisions  reflect  adversely  on  his
judgment, but attributes them to his youth (Tr. 22, 42). However, he notes that since his
marriage and the birth of his son, his lifestyle has changed. His wife’s family does not
engage in the kind of misconduct that punctuated Applicant’s youth, and he wants to set
a good example for his son and maintain the kind of good image his wife’s family has.
The  vice  president  of  his  company,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  over  ten  years,  is
aware  of  his  misconduct  and  recommends  him  for  his  clearance  (Answer).  He  also
successfully  completed  a  voluntary  county  outpatient  substance  abuse  program  in
Applicant moved to a new state, and failed to comply with state requirements to transfer his license. His old
state license was suspended, which was discovered during a routine traffic stop not otherwise alleged in the
SOR.
A park ranger observed a visitor to Applicant’s campsite in possession of alcohol, a violation of campground
rules.  The visitor had left the campsite, but because the campsite was registered to Applicant, Applicant was
cited, and paid a fine.

which were negative (Answer).

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. (HE 3) He
denied the other SOR allegations in full or in part. He also provided mitigating information.
(HE 3) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  42  years  old,  and  he  is  employed  as  a  senior  systems  security
specialist. (Tr. 39, 49) He protects sensitive healthcare information in his current position.
(Tr. 39, 49) One of his primary goals is to mitigate risk in information security. (Tr. 50) He
has an associate’s degree in computer science. (Tr. 43) In 2015, he received a bachelor’s
degree in systems security. (Tr. 48) He is in the process of obtaining his certification as
an  information  systems  manager.  (Tr.  48)  He  has a  strong  resume  in  communications
security and information technology. (AE I)
In 1998, Applicant married, and he and his spouse have three children ages 8, 16,
and 19. (Tr. 18, 25-26, 36, 40) Applicant’s spouse holds a security clearance, and she is
employed as a financial manager. (Tr. 35)
Applicant served in the Army from 2004 to July 2012. (Tr. 42-43) He was a senior
communications  security  repair  specialist.  (Tr.  44-45)  In  2010,  he  held  a  top  secret
clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). (Tr. 46) He said he
never had a security violation. (Tr. 46) He denied that his alcohol consumption affected
his work performance. (Tr. 47)
Alcohol Consumption
The SOR alleges the following conduct of security significance.
SOR  ¶ 1.a  alleges  in August  2004,  Applicant  was  arrested for and  convicted of
driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant drove after consuming alcohol and
hit a guard rail. (Tr. 58) He was in Army advanced individual training or AIT when he was

in the cited exhibits.
arrested for  DUI.  (Tr. 61)  He  said  he  did  not  recall  his  breathalyzer  result.  (Tr.  61)  He
pleaded guilty to DUI. (Tr. 61) The court imposed 48 hours in jail, 80 hours of community
service, a fine, and driver’s license suspension. (Tr. 62, 64)
Applicant’s commander imposed nonjudicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15,
Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  for  the  August  2004  DUI.  His  punishment
included  45  days  of  extra  duty,  and  his  commander  required  him  to  attend  the  Army
Substance Abuse Program (ASAP). (Tr. 62-64; GE 7 at ¶ 1) After completion of AIT, the
Army assigned Applicant to a unit in Germany. (Tr. 62)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges in November 2006, Applicant was charged with drunk on duty
and wrongful distribution of hallucinogens. His NJP included a reduction in rank. As to the
drunk on duty offense, Applicant said a sergeant relieved him from duty on New Year’s
Eve. (Tr. 67) He and some other soldiers left the barracks and went to a club, where he
consumed alcohol. (Tr. 67) He returned to the barracks and went to sleep. (Tr. 67) The
first sergeant, and the sergeant who released him from duty, came to Applicant’s barracks
room. The first sergeant asked Applicant why he was not on duty, and Applicant did not
respond  to  his  question  because  he  believed  he  would  not  be  believed  if  he  said  the
sergeant  with  the  first  sergeant  released  him  from  duty.  (Tr.  67,  113)  Applicant’s  unit
referred him to the ASAP. (Tr. 68, 112) He successfully completed ASAP. (Tr. 68-70; GE
7  at  ¶  1)  Applicant  denied  that he  was  under  the  influence  of alcohol  on  duty,  and  he
claimed  that  he  was  not  under  the  influence  of  alcohol.  (Tr.  69)  He  believed  he  was
unfairly accused of being drunk on duty. (Tr. 70)
The  allegation  of  wrongful  distribution  of  hallucinogens  was  made  against
Applicant  several  months  after  the  drunk  on  duty  accusation  was  made.  (Tr.  71)  An
airman, who tested positive in a urinalysis test for use of Ecstasy, said Applicant provided
an Ecstasy pill to him. (Tr. 71; GE 6 at 2-3) Applicant consented to the search of his room
in the barracks, and the searcher found three Ecstasy pills in the drawer under Applicant’s
bed.  (Tr.  72;  GE  6  at 2)  Applicant  said  others  had  access  to  his  room and must  have
placed  the  Ecstasy  pills  into  his  drawer.  Applicant  said  he  provided  statements  to  the
Army  Criminal  Investigation  Command  from  witnesses  who  said  they  did  not  see
Applicant commit drug offenses. (Tr. 74-75, 132) Applicant’s commander imposed NJP
including a reduction in grade, forfeiture of half a month’s pay for two months, and extra
duty. (Tr. 73; GE 14) Applicant said the colonel who imposed the NJP told him that he
believed  Applicant;  however,  he  had  to  punish  Applicant  to  show  illegal  drugs  are  not
tolerated “whether [he] did it or not.” (Tr. 73, 133-134) Applicant accused the colonel of
punishing  him  even  though  Applicant  was  innocent.  (Tr.  134)  Applicant  denied  his
involvement with illegal drugs. (Tr. 74) Applicant did not provide a statement from anyone
besides  himself  corroborating  his  assertion  that  the  colonel  said  he  was  innocent,  but
punished  him  anyway.  He  did  not  provide  proof  to  support  his  claim  that  the  colonel
violated  his  rights  by  knowingly  and  improperly  punishing  him  for  a  crime  he  did  not
commit.
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  in  August  2008,  Applicant  voluntarily  referred  himself  for
treatment in ASAP. Applicant did not recall his self-referral for treatment in ASAP. (Tr. 76,
78; GE 7) Applicant was diagnosed in March 2009, as alcohol dependent. (Tr. 76, 131;
GE 5; GE 7)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges in June 2009, Applicant was charged with DUI, simple assault,
and  disorderly  conduct.  Applicant  got  into  an  altercation  after  consuming  alcohol.  He
pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, and the DUI and assault charges were dismissed.
In 2009, Applicant was with a friend at a bar. (Tr. 79) Applicant drank four or five
strong drinks, and Applicant admitted he was intoxicated. (Tr. 80-81) Applicant was the
only Black person in the bar, and a man came up to Applicant, asked him for a cigarette,
and called him a n _ _ _ _ r. (Tr. 82) More words were exchanged, and Applicant left the
bar and went to the parking lot. (Tr. 83) Applicant described his own conduct in the bar
as reasonable and peaceful. In the parking lot outside the bar, the man insulted Applicant
again and tried to punch Applicant. (Tr. 83) Applicant hit the man in the face, and the man
hit his head on the ground. (Tr. 83) Someone tackled Applicant and knocked Applicant
down. Others kicked Applicant and his friend while they were down. (Tr. 83-84) Applicant
said, “I heard the whole, entire bar . . . [say] ‘[w]e’re going to hang us a n _ _ _ _ r.’” (Tr.
84) Applicant said he believed they were going to get a rope and drag him down the street
by the neck. (Tr. 84) Applicant and his friend left in his friend’s vehicle. (Tr. 84) A short
time later, the police arrested Applicant and his friend. (Tr. 85) Applicant did not recall
whether a blood alcohol test (BAT) was administered, and Applicant denied that he was
driving. (GE 3 at 7) The police told Applicant that the person Applicant punched had “a
pretty  bad  gash  on  his  head.”  (Tr.  85)  According  to  the  notice  of  preliminary  hearing,
Applicant was charged with simple assault, disorderly conduct, DUI/high rate of alcohol
.10-.16, and DUI/Gen IMP/INCAP of driving safely. (GE 8)  Applicant’s friend was charged
with  DUI,  simple  assault,  and  disorderly  conduct.  (Tr.  86)  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to
disorderly conduct, and the other charges were withdrawn. (Tr. 88; GE 8) He received
court fees totaling $229. (Tr. 88; GE 8) Applicant’s record was subsequently expunged.
(Tr. 88; AE A)
On March 2, 2009, an Army social worker and ASAP Clinical Director evaluated
Applicant’s alcohol consumption. (GE 7) She indicated he met three of seven criteria for
alcohol dependence, and his beer consumption during ASAP established a fourth criteria.
(GE 7)2 The Clinical Director indicated that his diagnosis of alcohol dependence “became
2 In 2000, the  American Psychiatric  Association  issued the  Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual  of
Mental Disorders (DSM–IV-TR).  This manual indicates that if three of the following seven criteria are met
in the previous year, a diagnosis of alcohol dependence is warranted. The seven criteria are as follows:
Had to drink much more than you once did to get the effect you want? Or found that your
usual number of drinks had much less effect than before?
Found that when the effects of alcohol were wearing off, you had withdrawal symptoms,
such as trouble sleeping, shakiness, restlessness, nausea, sweating, a racing heart, or a
seizure? Or sensed things that were not there?
Had times when you ended up drinking more, or longer, than you intended?
More than once wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn’t?
a point of contention for [Applicant] and he spent a number of weeks fixated on this and
his adamant disagreement with same.” (GE 6 at ¶ 2) Applicant claimed the ASAP Clinical
Director said that “Anyone that has two sittings a year drinking alcohol, and in those two
sittings  drink[s]  more  than  two  drinks,  is  considered  an  alcoholic.”  (Tr.  98,  118,  123)
Applicant denied that he was an “alcoholic”; however, he said he did “binge drink.” (Tr.
98, 111-112) He said the statement in the Clinical Director’s report that he drank half a
beer while in ASAP was false, but that she was not lying. (Tr. 134-135) He did not recall
admitting  to  her  that  he  drank  beer  while  in  ASAP.  (Tr.  135)  Applicant  said  he  was
unaware of the diagnosis of alcohol dependency. (Tr. 126) He characterized the Clinical
Director  as  “mean,”  “very  attacking,”  “very  abusive,”  and  “very  manipulating.” (Tr.  122,
134) He said she told him, “I’m going to get you. I’m going to get you.” (Tr. 134) He denied
that anyone told him not to drink alcohol. (Tr. 119)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  in  September  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI.  After
attending a civilian substance abuse program, the charge in state court was dismissed.
In  May  2012,  Applicant’s  command  charged  him  with  operating  a  vehicle  while  drunk
under Article 111, UCMJ. He was discharged from the service in lieu of courts-martial,
and he received a general discharge under honorable conditions.
In September 2011, Applicant and his spouse were both drinking alcohol before
they started to drive home. (Tr. 31-32) Applicant was asked how much he had to drink,
and he said he had a “drink or two” or “at least two drinks that evening.” (Tr. 91) Applicant
said he did not feel intoxicated. (Tr. 91) Applicant fell asleep while driving to their home
and hit a tree. (Tr. 32-33, 89) Applicant received serious burns to his legs and had multiple
broken bones. (Tr. 23-24, 44, 89-90) He was in a coma for six days and in the hospital
for about four months. (Tr. 23-24, 90) His spouse attributed the accident to Applicant’s
severe sleep apnea and being tired. (Tr. 33) Applicant’s records indicate he had a BAT;
however, Applicant said he did not remember the result. (Tr. 91; GE 3 at 5) A letter of
reprimand from a major general indicates that a police officer at the scene of the accident
“noted a strong odor of alcohol coming from [Applicant’s] breath and person,” and he had
a BAT result of a .14 blood alcohol content (BAC). (AE B at ¶ 1) The state dismissed the
DUI charge. (Tr. 92)
The  Army  preferred  a  charge  of  drunk  driving  against  Applicant.  (Tr.  93,  136)
Applicant said his lawyer convinced him that he could not get a fair trial in the military
because “[t]he Army has deep pockets,” “they are known to get on the witness stand and
lie,”  and  “[t]here  is  no  way  you  could  win  this.”  (Tr.  94-95)  He  was  convinced  he  was

getting “railroaded.” (Tr. 95) At his security clearance hearing, Applicant admitted he was
guilty of the DUI offense. (Tr. 138)
Applicant was a sergeant (E-5) before being reduced to private (E-1) through an
administrative reduction related to being charged with operating a vehicle while drunk and
receipt  of  a  discharge  under  Chapter  10  of  Army  Regulation  635-200.  (Tr.  45,  95)  He
received a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 45-46, 97)3
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  from  about  February  2012  to  July  2012,  Applicant  received
treatment  at  an  ASAP.  He  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependence.  Applicant  self-
referred himself to ASAP. (Tr. 126) He said he decided not to get drunk anymore. (Tr.
127) Applicant said he successfully completed ASAP. (GE 1)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  Applicant  continues  to  consume  alcohol  notwithstanding  his
diagnosis  of  alcohol  dependence.  Applicant  said  he  ended  his  alcohol  consumption  in
June 2017. (Tr. 104) He also said he stopped drinking alcohol after the accident in 2011
or his alcohol consumption was “close to none” until his birthday in June 2017. (Tr. 104-
105) He said he did not drink alcohol and drive after the accident in 2011. (Tr. 105) He
claimed he did not drink alcohol while he was in ASAP. (Tr. 120-121) He denied that he
was alcohol dependent. (Tr. 129) There is no evidence that Applicant currently consumes
alcohol, and SOR ¶ 1.g is not substantiated.
Applicant  denied  receipt  of  the  January  14,  2010  memorandum  from  the  Army
Central Personnel Security Clearance Facility (CPSCF) granting his access to sensitive
compartmented information and top secret information, and warning him not to have any
future  incidents  involving  alcohol,  criminal  conduct,  or  other  unfavorable  information
because it may result in suspension of his security clearance. (Tr. 124; GE 12) There is
no receipt signed by Applicant in the file showing Applicant received the January 14, 2010
Army CPSCF memorandum. (GE 12)
Applicant’s spouse said the last time she observed him consuming alcohol was on
his birthday in June 2017. (Tr. 20) She said on that occasion, he drank one half of a glass
of wine. (Tr. 20, 37) Applicant said he had “two glasses of wine on [his] birthday.” (Tr.
128) After the accident in 2011, he seldom consumed alcohol and not to intoxication. (Tr.
21) His alcohol-related accident in 2011 was a shock to him, and he changed. (Tr. 21) He
denied that he drank to intoxication after the accident in 2011. (Tr. 128) He denied drinking
alcohol after his birthday in June 2017. (Tr. 129) His spouse maintains wine in her house.
(Tr. 22) In 2015, Applicant and his spouse were baptized, and his church is available to
3  Applicant  denied  that  he  admitted  the  offense  as  part  of  the  discharge  process  or  he  did  not
remember admitting an offense carrying a bad-conduct discharge. (Tr. 136-137) Under Army Regulation
(AR)  635-200,  Active  Duty  Enlisted  Administrative  Separations,  Chapter  10,  paragraph  10-2e,  “The

him as a support system. (Tr. 22-25) His spouse indicates Applicant has “great integrity,”
and  she  recommends  approval  of  his  security  clearance.  (Tr.  38)  He  said  he  “took
responsibility” for his conduct. (Tr. 70, 140-141)
On  September  9,  2016,  an  Officer  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator
interviewed Applicant about his history of alcohol consumption. (GE 3) The summary of
the OPM interview states:
In 2009 or 2010; Subject could not be more specific, Subject found [G]od
and dedicated himself to his family and Subject’s drinking decreased to its
current level of three to four mixed drinks over a five to six hour time period
once  or  twice  per  year  during  the  holidays.  .  .  .  Subject  has  no  intent  on
changing his drinking habits in the future. (GE 3 at 11)
Applicant said he had changed after the accident in 2011. (Tr. 100) “[He] had an
out-of-body experience where [he] met the Creator.” (Tr. 100) The Creator held Applicant
by the neck over a fire and said, “Is this what you want?” (Tr. 101) He responded that he
wanted a second chance, and he woke up in the hospital. (Tr. 101) Applicant believed he
healed from his injuries “at a supernatural rate.” (Tr. 101-102) He considers himself to be
honest, responsible, reliable, and trustworthy. (Tr. 107)
In sum, Applicant successfully completed ASAP in April 2005, January 2009, and
February 2012. (AE D) He has never had a positive urinalysis for use of illegal drugs. (AE
D) In 2012, he was diagnosed with alcohol-use disorder. (AE D) In February 2012, he
made a commitment to abstain from alcohol use. (AE D) At his hearing, he promised to
abstain from alcohol consumption in the future.
Character Evidence
Before Applicant deployed to Iraq with a task force, his colonel said “we were going
to lose 40 – almost half, 44 percent, which we did lose half.” (Tr. 66) Applicant said he
was a gunner for “over 279 missions.” (Tr. 66) His “mind state was that I’m going to die,
but if I’m going to die, I’m going to die honorably, and just, you know for my brothers and
sisters that wear the flag.” (Tr. 66)
While in Iraq, Applicant said he received multiple Combat Action Badges (CAB).4
He explained why he only had one CAB in his records as follows:
4 I decline to credit Applicant with receipt of more than one Combat Action Badge. The Army Human
Relations Command website states:
Subsequent award of the  CAB  is not authorized during the same qualifying period. The
qualifying period is defined as the contingency/conflict for which the Secretary of the Army
authorized combat badges is awarded. Currently, the only qualifying period for award of
the  CAB  is  the  GWOT.  OEF,  OIF,  and  OND  are  operations  within  the  GWOT
contingency/conflict. Therefore, no matter how many times a Soldier rotates to the theater,
only one award of each combat badge is authorized. (For example, a Soldier who engages
in combat with the enemy during OIF I, OEF III, and OIF V will only receive one CAB.).
And I remember throwing them down. I was, like, I’m tired of these combat
action  badges.  And  I  remember  throwing  them  down  and  walking  away
because I was upset about . . . all the combat, the killing. And I said, I’m
tired of you giving me awards for killing all these people. And I just walked
away, and I said, you know. Give me money for the combat action badges,
because I saw no value to it. (Tr. 139)
He indicated records were burned in the trunk of his car during the accident in 2011. (Tr.
139-140) He did not provide corroborative evidence that he was a gunner for “over 279
missions,”  that  he  was  assigned  to  a  unit  that  sustained  a  high  percentage  of  combat
casualties, or that he was awarded multiple CABs.
Applicant said that after he came back from Iraq, he described symptoms of having
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a doctor “threw some pills at [him]” and told
him he would be fine in three months. (Tr. 77) Applicant threw the pills in the trash. (Tr.
77) The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) decided that he had a disability rating of 90
percent, which included 30 percent for PTSD. (Tr. 135; AE D)
Applicant’s  DD  Form  214  indicates  he  has  the  following  medals,  badges,  and
ribbons:  Army  Commendation  Medal  (ARCOM);  Army  Achievement  Medal  (AAM)  (6th
Award); Army Superior Unit Award (ASUA); Army Good Conduct Medal (AGCM); National
Defense Service Medal (NDSM); Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (GWTSM); Iraq
Campaign Medal with Campaign Star (ICMCS); Noncommissioned Officer Professional
Development  Ribbon  (NCOPDR)  (2nd  Award);  Army  Service  Ribbon  (ASR);  Overseas
Service  Ribbon  (OSR)  (2nd  Award);  Combat  Action  Badge  (CAB);  and  Certificate  of
Achievement (COR). (GE 4; AE G) He completed multiple military training courses. (GE
4)  He  served  in  Iraq  from  August  2006  to  October  2007.  (GE  4)  He  also  served  an
overseas tour in Germany.
In  2017,  Applicant  received  an  excellent  performance  evaluation  from  his
employer. (AE E) He also received some excellent evaluation reports when he was in the
Army. (AE F) Applicant was the distinguished honor graduate of a course. (Tr. 47) He
provided award certificates and orders for several medals and one CAB as listed on his
DD Form 214. (AE F) Letters of recommendation from his spouse, supervisors, friends,
and colleagues lauded Applicant’s intelligence, diligence, positive attitude, enthusiasm,
honesty, friendliness, athleticism when he was younger, and professionalism. (AE H)
",False
"Under Guideline G, the SOR alleges that Applicant consumed alcohol to the point
of intoxication from about 1991/1992 to at least January 2016, and that this excessive
consumption resulted in five arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), two
of  which  resulted  in  12  months’  probation,  and  that  Applicant  received  alcohol-related
treatment  for  a  condition  diagnosed  as  alcohol-use  disorder.  Applicant  denies  the
characterization of his alcohol consumption. He admits the DUI arrests, but denies that
he was intoxicated during the incidents. Applicant also denies that he was sentenced to
probation as a result of his December 2015 DUI arrest. However, he admits that he was
sentenced  to  12 months’  probation following  his  February  2016  DUI  arrest. He  admits
that he successfully underwent alcohol-related treatment. The SOR cross-alleges under
Guideline  J, the  alcohol-related arrests. Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 48-year-old avionics supervisor employed by a defense contractor
since  May  2014,  and previously  employed  by  another  defense  contractor  beginning  in
December 2009. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 1989 until he
retired in August 2010. He deployed to a combat zone during Operation Desert Storm.
He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  approximately  1990.  Applicant  has  a  teenage
daughter. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 26.)
Applicant began drinking alcohol in 1991 while assigned to an aircraft carrier, but
did  drink  not  to  the  point  of  intoxication  or  have  any  alcohol-related  issues  during  the
1990s. In February 2006, Applicant had been drinking and was pulled over for speeding.
(Tr. 40.) At the stop, Applicant refused to perform field sobriety tests or take a breathalyzer
at  the  officer’s  direction,  but  instead  requested  a  blood  test.  He  was  arrested  for  DUI,
speeding, no insurance, and no seatbelt. The DUI charge was reduced to reckless driving
and ultimately dismissed.
In  December  2010,  Applicant  was  pulled  over  for  speeding.  The  officer  asked
Applicant  if  he  had  been  drinking,  Applicant  denied  that  he  had  been,  and  refused  a
breathalyzer. He was arrested and charged with DUI and speeding. Ultimately, the DUI
charge was dismissed, the related court costs were waived, and Applicant paid a fine for
speeding.
In January 2015, Applicant was pulled over on an Army base for speeding. The
officer stated in his report that Applicant smelled strongly of alcohol. However, Applicant
has consistently stated that he had not been drinking. (Answer; Tr. 31; Tr. 41; Tr. 46.)
Applicant  refused  a  breathalyzer,  and  was  arrested  for  DUI  and  speeding.  He  was
detained for approximately 14 hours, then released. The DUI charge was later dismissed
and Applicant paid a $10 fine for speeding. (GX 5; Answer.) Applicant testified that he
had several run-ins with arresting officer of the incident on the Army base. He reported
the officer’s conduct to the commanding officer, but ultimately Applicant decided to move
off base to avoid future issues. Applicant believes that the officer was confusing Applicant
with someone else. (Tr. 45-46.)
In December 2015, Applicant was pulled over for speeding while on the way to the
hospital to visit his girlfriend. After the stop, the officer stated that he had seen Applicant
throw  drugs  from  the  vehicle.  Applicant  denied  this  and  demanded  to  see  the  footage
from the officer’s dashboard mounted camera. The officer refused. Applicant was arrested
and charged with DUI, speeding, illegal lane change, no insurance, and no registration.
Applicant denies that he consumed any alcohol prior to the arrest. At Applicant’s fourth
court  appearance,  the  officer  was  not  present  and  Applicant’s  attorney  stated  that  all
charges would be suspended and later dismissed if Applicant pled guilty and completed
a  pre-trial  diversion  program  and  paid  a  $3,600  fine.  Applicant  did  not  enter  the
agreement,  but  instead,  requested  a  jury  trial.  At  the  pretrial  conference,  all  charges
except for the speeding were dismissed. (Answer.)
In February 2016, Applicant was in a rental car in a friend’s driveway. He had been
drinking the night before and there was an empty cup in the car which had contained a
non-alcoholic daiquiri. His  friend  noticed  the vehicle,  which  she  did  not  recognize,  and
called  the  police.  The  police  arrived,  and  after  speaking  with  Applicant  and  noting  the
apparent open container, asked Applicant to take a breathalyzer. Applicant refused and
was arrested for DUI. Applicant pled no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to
12 months’ probation, which required Applicant to abstain from alcohol use, attend alcohol
awareness classes with random urinalysis, and complete 50 hours of community service.
Applicant successfully completed the requirements and was released from probation in
June 2017. (Answer.)
Three days after his last DUI arrest in February 2016, Applicant self-referred to the
Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP). He was evaluated by a counselor who stated
that Applicant met the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (Moderate). He was assessed as
not  needing  medical  detoxification  or  inpatient  treatment.  Applicant  entered  outpatient
treatment  and  counseling  and  “met  his  treatment  goal  of  establishing  and  maintaining
abstinence while increasing his knowledge about the disease of addiction in the process
of  recovery.”  He  successfully  completed  the  treatment  requirements  which  included
attending Alcohol Anonymous (AA) meetings, and, in May 2016, received a fair to good
prognosis. (Answer.)
Applicant  has  abstained  from  alcohol  consumption  since  February  2016,  four
months before beginning probation. Despite his denials that he had been drinking prior to
several of his DUI arrests, Applicant admits that he had been drinking before the 2006
and 2016 arrests, and that consuming alcohol has created problems in his life. (Tr. 40-
43;  Answer.)  Applicant  has  no  other  criminal  history.  He  strives  to  continually  set  an

church, and coaches Little League basketball and football. (Tr. 36.) He is working towards
his bachelor’s degree, regularly works out at a gym, and continues to attend AA meetings
two to three times a week. (Tr. 37-38; AX A.) He has no intention of drinking alcohol in
the future. (Tr. 38.)
Applicant  accepts  full  responsibility  for  his  actions.  He  is  dedicated  to  his  job.
Applicant’s two fellow service members and friends since 1991, and a current coworker
since 2011 attest to Applicant’s strength of character, integrity, and trustworthiness, and
highly recommend him for a continued security clearance. (AX A.)

"Applicant admitted all of the allegations with the exception of SOR ¶ 2.a, which
he denied. He is 37 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he had never been married
and he did not have any children.1
Applicant graduated from high school in 1999 and earned a bachelor’s degree in
2005. He has worked for various defense contractors since 2008. He has worked for his
current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  2016.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance
since 2009.2
Applicant started consuming alcohol at age 15. In July 1999, at age 18, he was
charged with driving under the influence (DUI) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a). This was his first DUI.
Though his blood alcohol content (BAC) was under the legal limit, he was convicted of
DUI  due  to  a  zero  tolerance  violation  for  consuming  alcohol  as  a  minor.  His  driver’s
license was suspended for six months, he was ordered to complete a six-month alcohol
program, and he was fined $100.3
In  July  2001,  at  age  20,  Applicant  was  charged  and  convicted  of  underage
possession  of  alcohol.  He  was  in  college  and  he  threw  a  party  where  alcohol  was
present.  He  was  sentenced  to  one  year  probation,  50  hours  community  service,  and
alcohol counseling (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.a). He completed individual alcohol counseling from
August to December 2001. During this period, he consumed beer a few times weekly.4

In  December  2005,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI),
BAC  .15%  to  .20%,  1st  offense.  This  was  his  second  and  last  alcohol-related  offense
while driving. He had a few drinks while watching football at a bar. As he was driving to
his  parents’  home,  he  hit  a  patch  of  ice  and  his  car  slid  into  a  ditch.  A  police  officer
asked  him  if  he  had  been  drinking  and  he  said  “Yes.”  He  was  convicted  of  reckless
driving and fined $250 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 2.a). He consumed two to three beers three to four
times weekly during this period.5
In  June  2012,  Applicant  was  disciplined  for  reporting  to  work  hungover  and
smelling  of  alcohol.  He  had  consumed  alcohol  the  night  before.  This  was  his  first  and
only alcohol-related incident at work. He was consequently involuntarily terminated from
employment in August 2012 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.a). He consumed six beers daily during this
period.  He  also  started  drinking  hard  liquor  in  October  2010,  after  his  long-term
relationship  of  five  years  ended;  he  found  himself  battling  depression;  he  isolated
himself;  and  he  used  alcohol  as  a  coping  mechanism.  His  mother  testified  that  she
observed Applicant begin to binge drink on the weekends in 2010, which had not been
his normal behavior. He also withdrew from participating in family events and he did not
answer her telephone calls.6
In October 2012, Applicant was  charged and convicted of drunk in public (SOR
¶¶  1.e,  2.a).  He  was  fined  $25.  He  was  walking  to  his  residence  from  a  convenience
store when the police stopped him because he was stumbling. When the police asked
him  if  he  had  been  drinking,  he  said  “Yes.”  The  police  arrested  him,  took  him  to  the
police station, and advised him to pay the fine, which he did. He consumed two beers
daily and more on the weekends from June to October 2012. He was still in denial about
his alcoholism.7
By  March  2014,  Applicant’s  level  of  alcohol  consumption  had  escalated.  He
consumed primarily hard liquor, and “more than the average person drinks in a sitting.”
He asked his mother for help and she took him to the emergency room, where he was
held  until  a  bed  was available  for  him  at  an  addiction  treatment services  program.  His
BAC was .392%. He disclosed his family history of alcoholism. For the first time and for
four  days,  he  received  inpatient  alcohol  treatment.  He  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol
dependence (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 2.a).8
After completing treatment, Applicant was sober for one month. He then resumed
consuming alcohol. By his November 2014 background interview, he consumed alcohol
approximately  two  times  weekly  (SOR  ¶¶  1.g,  2.a).  By  April  2015,  his  alcohol
consumption had escalated to an average of eight to twelve drinks daily, prompting him
to again contact his mother for help. She helped him enroll in a 28-day inpatient alcohol

treatment program at an addiction treatment center. He received treatment through May
2015, and he was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, continuous (SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 2.a).9
Applicant  has  been  sober  since  the  day  he  entered  the  April  2015  treatment
program. Though he knew he had an issue with alcohol when he enrolled in the March
2014  treatment  program,  he  had  neither  accepted  that  he  is  an  alcoholic  nor  taken
responsibility for such knowledge and his recovery until April 2015. He testified that the
day he entered the April 2015 treatment program was:
[A] pivot point for me . . . a moment of clarity, that there was a lot more to
my  life  that  I  could  be  doing,  and  that  I  needed  to  ask  for  help.  I  found
strength  in  asking  for  help,  that  I  couldn’t  find  within,  and  I  sought
treatment that day.
During  his  final  week  at  the  2015  treatment  program,  he  was  elected  the  male
community  representative--a  role  through  which  he  helped  the  other  men  in  the
program.10
Applicant complied with the recommendations of his treatment counselor after his
2015  discharge  from  the  treatment  program:  he  attended  90  Alcoholics  Anonymous
(AA)  meetings  in  90  days;  he  obtained  an  AA  sponsor;  and  he  saw  a  licensed
professional counselor weekly. As of the date of the hearing, he was still attending AA
daily;  he  was  in  daily  contact  with  his  AA  sponsor;  he  was  also  in  daily  contact  as  a
sponsor  for  an  individual  in  recovery;  and  he  was  seeing  his  licensed  professional
counselor  weekly  to  biweekly.  In  2016,  the  counselor  diagnosed  him  with  alcohol
dependence  in  full  sustained  remission.  He  intended  to  continue  attending  AA,
remaining active in his AA community, and seeing his counselor, whom he viewed as a
coach that has taught him different coping strategies for life’s stressors.11
Applicant testified that he learned through both the 2015 treatment program and
AA that his previous failure to remain sober hinged on his thinking that he could handle
his alcoholism on his own, rather than reach out to others for help. He also learned that
“I  couldn’t  drink  safely  or  like  other  people  could,  and  that  I  was  fully  alcoholic”  and
“there  are  consequences  when  I  drink.”  A  friend  from  AA  since  2016  testified  that
Applicant is a “rock… [h]e knows what to do and he does it consistently and he does it
always.”12
Applicant signed a statement of intent in June 2018 to abstain from using alcohol
on penalty of losing his security clearance. He testified that he now has a social life, and
he  enjoys  fishing,  playing  guitar,  and  reading  books.  He  is  also  a  part  of  his  family’s

being involved as an uncle to four minor children.13
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  September  2016  to  December  2017  is  a  retired
brigadier  general  and  a  former  deputy  director  for  a  federal  government  agency  from
2014  to  2015.  As  of the  date  of the  hearing,  he  was  the  vice  president  for a  business
unit within the company. He testified that he first met Applicant in 2014, when Applicant
worked for him as an executive assistant in a contractor capacity until 2015, when the
witness  left  the  government  agency.  He  then  hired  Applicant  to  work  for  him  at  their
current  company  in  2016.  He  described  Applicant  as  an  outstanding  performer.  He
identified Applicant as a high potential employee and gave him a top performance rating
in 2017.14
The  witness  testified  that  he  first  became  aware  of  Applicant’s  challenges  with
alcohol  in  2014.  The  witness  testified  that  Applicant’s  mother  also  informed  him  about
Applicant’s  2015  treatment  for  alcoholism  the  day  Applicant  entered  the  program,  and
he observed Applicant’s impressive work performance when Applicant returned to work
after  completing  treatment.  The  witness  also  testified  that  he  reviewed  the  SOR,  and
Applicant  was  forthright  about  his  issues  with  alcohol  and  his  efforts  to  address  them.
While the witness was aware of Applicant’s history with alcohol, he testified that he did
not believe that anyone else at work was and that there was some speculation among
several individuals at their prior job of Applicant’s challenges. The witness testified that
he  has  seen  Applicant  on  numerous  occasions  in  social  situations  where  alcohol  is
present,  and  described  Applicant  as  firm  in  his  decision  to  not  consume  alcohol.  The
witness  indicated  that  he  had  no  doubts  that  Applicant  has  turned  his  life  around.
Numerous professional and social character references describe Applicant as a superb
employee  and  a  man  of  exemplary  character,  with  demonstrated  integrity  and
trustworthiness.15

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  2.a,  and  2.b,  with  explanations.  His
admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 50 years old. He graduated from high school in 1986, and enlisted in
the  U.S.  Navy.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  Navy  in  information  technology  from

is included in GE 2.

letters, all dated in August or September 2018. AE A and AE 10 are the same letter.
1987 to 1998, and was honorably discharged. Since 1998, he has worked as a defense
contractor,  either  for  his  current  employer  or  its  predecessor.  He  works  as  a  systems
engineer and program manager. He has held a security clearance since his time in the
Navy, and needs a clearance for his job. (Tr. 31, 35-37; GE 1; AE 6-AE 11)
Applicant and  his  wife  married  in 1994. They  have  two  daughters,  ages 20  and
21.  Both are  now  in  college. He  also  has a 28-year-old  stepson, his  wife’s  son from  a
prior  relationship.  Applicant  and  his  wife  have  had  several  separations.  They  first
separated in 2005. They reconciled in 2007, but his wife then spent the next four years
in  jail  after  her  fourth  conviction  for  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI)  or  driving  while
intoxicated (DWI). (Tr. 34, 67) She returned to the home in 2011 after her release. She
moved  out  of  the  house  again  in  November  2014,  and  was  away  for  about  the  next
year. Applicant and his wife separated again in about June 2016. He later retained legal
counsel and considered divorce. (AE 5; Tr. 92) They remained separated at the time of
Applicant’s background interview, in February 2017. (GE 3)
Applicant’s wife returned to the home in December 2017, though she moved out
again in January 2018. It is unclear when she returned, but at the time of the hearing,
they remained legally married and were living under the same roof, though maintaining
separate  lives.  Applicant  said  they  do  not  speak,  and  do  not  have  arguments.  “I  don’t
know  what  there  would  be  to  fight  about,”  he  said.  Applicant  is  the  household’s  sole
financial provider, and he pays the mortgage. (Tr. 31-39, 89-93; GE 1)
In August 2012, Applicant had an altercation with his stepson, then age 22, over
his  compliance  with  house  rules.  Applicant  had  consumed  several  beers  over  several
hours  while  watching  an  early-season  college  football  game  at  home.  During  the
altercation,  his  wife  called  the  police,  and  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
assault  and  battery  of  his  stepson.  (Tr.  40-46,  83-84;  GE  1;  GE  3)  In  about  October
2012,  Applicant  went  to  court  and  pleaded  guilty.  He  was  sentenced  to  one  year  of
probation, and ordered to attend anger-management classes. He completed the terms
of his sentence. (Tr. 47-48, 83; GE 1 at 26-27; GE 3 at 3; Answer) (SOR ¶ 2.a)
In December 2013, Applicant had an altercation with his wife. Both of them had
been drinking. Applicant testified that his wife had a habit of stealing his wallet and keys,
and  he  believed  she  had  done  so  on  this  occasion.  He  grabbed  her  wrists  and  pulled
her up off the couch in an effort to get her to help him look for his wallet. They lost their
balance and fell over, and his wife hit her head, though she was not injured. Applicant
had  consumed  between  two  and  four  beers,  and  said  he  was  “buzzed”  but  not
intoxicated. No one was arrested at the time. (Tr. 48-53, 86-87; GE 3 at 4)
A few months later, in February 2014, Applicant’s wife and their elder daughter,
then  17,  had  an  altercation,  in  which  his  daughter  threw  a  coffee  mug  at  her  mother,
hitting her in the face. Applicant’s brother-in-law was visiting at the time, and he called
police. The daughter was arrested and spent the night in juvenile detention. (GE 3 at 4;
Tr. 67-70, 85-86)
Applicant’s  wife  then  told  the  police  about  the  December  2013  altercation  with
her husband. Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic assault upon his wife.
He spent the night in jail. (Tr. 53, 84-87; GE 1 at 27-29; GE 3 at 4) (SOR ¶ 2.b) In June
2014,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty.  He  was  sentenced  to  two  years  of  probation  and
ordered to attend 12 weeks of alcohol education and domestic-violence training. (Tr. 49-
53, 87; GE 1 at 27-29; GE 3 at 4)
Applicant’s  two  daughters  were  referred  to  therapy  through  his  employer’s
Employee  Assistance  Program  (EAP).  Through  Applicant’s  own  involvement,  he  was
referred to mental-health and substance-abuse counseling.3 (Tr. 57-59, 99-100; GE 2 at
5)
At his initial evaluation in May 2014, Applicant reported that he began drinking at
age 16. His drinking had increased gradually over the previous seven years (beginning
in  2007,  the  year  his first  separation  ended, and  the  year his wife went  to  jail).  During
that  time, his  longest period  of  abstinence was  four  days.  (GE  2  at  42)  Applicant  self-
reported that he drank about five nights a week, usually by himself. He would have two
or three shots of liquor on weekdays (including the night before the evaluation), and four
to six shots on weekend nights. He reported some history of “shakes, queasy stomach,
night  sweats,  and  anxiety  the  next  day  after  drinking  heavily,”  as  well  as  likely  partial
blackouts.  He  recognized  “that  drinking  has  become  a  problem  with  his  becoming
dependent on it.” He expressed a desire to cut back on his drinking though he had not
been able to do so. (GE 2 at 41)
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependence  and  depressive  disorder  not
otherwise  specified  (NOS)  by  a  Ph.D.  licensed  clinical  psychologist.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  The
psychologist  recommended  that  Applicant  participate  in  an  intensive  outpatient
chemical-dependency program. (GE 2 at 39, 42)
Applicant’s treatment plan included drug and alcohol abstinence, participation in
Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA),  and  development  of  an  effective  social-support  network
and  of  coping  strategies  for  dealing  with  stress.  Documentation  reflects  that  Applicant
was  briefed  verbally  on  the  treatment  program:  (“I  have  gone  over  this  plan  with
[Applicant]” and he “verbally agrees to treatment plan.”) (GE 2 at 43)
Applicant  began  the  intensive  outpatient  group  treatment  program  on  June  16,
2014.  (GE  2  at  35)  He  missed  a  week  of  group  sessions  in  late  July  2014  after  he
relapsed  into  binge  drinking.  (GE  2  at  23-38)  When  he  returned  to  the  program,  he
continued attendance and completed the required 18 sessions on August 11, 2014. (AE
1)  He  attended  AA  during  the  program.  (GE  2  at  7,  14)  His  prognosis  in  mid-August
2014  was  “poor  to  guarded.”  (GE  2  at  16,  17)  There  is  no  record  evidence  of  a
subsequent prognosis.
3  GE  2  is  a  43-page  exhibit  consisting  of  treatment  records  from  both  the  psychology  provider  and  the
intensive outpatient substance abuse counseling provider.
Applicant  returned  for  individual  therapy  with  EAP  in  late  September  2014.  He
reported  that  during  the  intensive  outpatient  group  treatment,  his  longest  period  of
sobriety  was  about  three  weeks.  He  resumed  drinking  shortly  after  completing  that
program.  In  late  August  2014,  Applicant’s  son-in-law  moved  back  into  the  home.
Applicant  and  his  wife  coped  with  the  resulting  stress  by  drinking,  despite  what  he
indicated was a court order not to do so. It was recommended that he develop a more
extensive  recovery  plan  with  AA  and  that  he  identify  how  to  achieve  longer-term
sobriety. (Tr. 68-75; GE 2 at 14)
At  the  time,  Applicant’s  daughters  had  been  removed  from  the  home  by  Child
Protective  Services  (CPS),  in  August  2014,  and  an  October  2014  court  date  was
pending. As part of his efforts to get them released by CPS and back into his custody,
Applicant  requested  and  received  a  prescription  for  Campral  to  help  with  his  alcohol
cravings, because, he said, he wanted to do more than what was required. (Tr. 66, 76-
77; GE 2 at 13)
Applicant  continued  therapy  with  the  EAP  psychologist  through  late  2014.  He
was  sober  for  several  months.  He  reported  to  his  providers  that  the  Campral  was
working and that he found AA useful. (GE 2 at 7) In order for Applicant’s daughters to
return  home  from  CPS  custody,  his  wife  had  to  leave  the  home,  which  she  did,  in
November 2014. She was out of the home for the next year. (Tr. 68-75) Applicant’s last
documented therapy session with EAP was in November 2014. (GE 2 at 1)
Applicant  completed  a  parenting  class  in  December  2014.  He  completed  a
batterer’s  intervention  program  between  March  and  July  2015.  He  tested  negative  for
alcohol  on  August  27,  2015.  A  September  9,  2015  letter  from  community  supervision
authorities documented that he completed the requirements of his probation. (AE 1) He
said  he  had  been  given  drug  and  alcohol  tests  during  his  probation.  (Tr.  54-63)
Applicant  completed  his  two-year  probation  period  in  June  2016.  He  has  had  no
subsequent arrests or criminal offenses. (Tr. 88)
Applicant  had  a  background  interview  in  February  2017  in  connection  with  his
SCA.  He  reported  consuming  alcohol  three  or  four  times  a  week.  He  reported
consuming two beers when in public, and up to eight beers at home. As to hard liquor,
he reported consuming one to two cocktails in public, and three shots and four cocktails
“if  he  is  trying  to  get  loose  and  have  fun.”  He  said  he  drank  three  shots  and  four
cocktails, or eight beers, about twice a month “to get buzzed.” He said this had been his
drinking pattern intake for the previous 10 years. He drank more when he was younger.
(GE 3 at 5) This alcohol consumption is alleged as a security concern, as it post-dates
his diagnosis of alcohol dependence, in 2014. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b)
to
In  his  Answer
the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  his  offenses,  accepted
responsibility  for  his  conduct,  and  expressed  regret.  He  said  he  had  been  in  a  “toxic
relationship.” He said he had completed the required treatment plan and all probationary
requirements  for  both  of  his  offenses.  He  disputed  that  he  had  been  diagnosed  with
alcohol dependence. (Answer)
At  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  drinks  three  or  four  times  a  week.
Sometimes  he  drinks  cocktails  or  two  or  three  shots  of  alcohol,  and  sometimes  he
drinks “no more than two” bottles of beer when out with others. He denied that he drinks
to excess. (Tr. 108-109)
Applicant testified that prior to this hearing, he had not seen documentation that
he  had been  diagnosed  as alcohol dependent,  and that  his  diagnosis  had  never  been
discussed with him during his treatment. (Tr. 62-64, 88, 101). As he did in his Answer,
Applicant  repeatedly  testified  that  he  had  never  been  diagnosed  with  alcohol
dependence,  and  that  he  disagreed  with  the  diagnosis.  Applicant  said,  “I  don’t  agree
with the statement that I’m alcohol dependent;” (Tr. 76) and “I don’t consider [myself] - I
mean, alcohol dependent, I just don’t agree with it.” (Tr. 79; 80, 113)
Treatment  records  reflect  that  Applicant’s  EAP  psychologist diagnosed  him  with
alcohol  dependence  in  May  2014  and  that  Applicant  was  verbally  briefed  on  his
treatment plan and agreed to it. (GE 2 at 43) His treatment records do not indicate that
Applicant was expressly told he was alcohol dependent.
Applicant  testified  that  no  medical  doctor  or  licensed  clinical  social  worker
(LCSW) ever told him he was an alcoholic or that he had a drinking problem. (Tr. 102,
111) He acknowledged that he would have been told or advised to stop drinking as part
of  the  intensive  outpatient  program:  “I  may  have  been.  I  mean,  that’s  their  goal.  .  .  .  I
would say as part of the program, yeah.” (Tr. 65; 76, 103)
Applicant  has  not  seen  any  other  treatment  provider  for  substance  abuse  other
that  what  is  reflected  in  GE  2.  (Tr.  77,  110)  He  does  not  currently  see  a  therapist  or
alcohol  counselor.  He  does  not  believe  he  has  a  drinking  problem.  (Tr.  77-78,  80)  He
offered  no  evidence  that  he  is  currently  participating  in  AA  or  any  similar  counseling
group,  nor  did  he  indicate  involvement  with  a  support  network  to  help  him  curtail  his
drinking.
Applicant acknowledged that he and his wife have a history of confrontations, all
of which involve alcohol: “[Applicant] reports infrequent physical fights with his wife, with
the drinking having always been involved when they have occurred.” (GE 2 at 2; Tr. 81)
He  recognizes  that his  wife  has  a  problem  with  alcohol,  given  her history  of  DUIs  and
DWIs. (Tr. 81-82) Applicant expressed regret for his actions, and accepted responsibility
for them. (Answer; Tr. 65, 113-114)
Applicant  provided  no  documentation  at  the  hearing  to  refute  or  to  update  the
2014  diagnosis  of  alcohol  dependence.  (Tr.  81)  After  the  hearing,  he  provided
documentation  from  his  primary  care  physician,  whom  he  visited  on  August  30,  2018.
His provider noted that Applicant “had ETOH [alcohol] issues a few years ago” and that
he  was  “now  fighting  to  have  his  legal/employment  status  returned  to normal.”  Among
the  “diagnoses  attached  to  this  encounter”  was  a  diagnosis  of  Alcoholism.  Applicant’s
provider  “advised  counseling  to  resolve  legal/alcohol  issues.”  (AE  3,  AE  4)  The
documentation  does  not  include  an  updated  diagnosis  of  Applicant’s  alcohol  use
disorder, nor does it note any prognosis for the future.
Applicant  oversees  a  contract  supporting  communication  networks  for  Navy
ships.  He  has  had  no  reportable  security  incidents.  References  attest  that  he  carries
himself with dignity and takes great pride in his work. He is regarded as highly valued by
his government customers, and has the trust and confidence of those who rely on him.
His references recommend retention of his clearance. (AE A; AE 2; AE 6 – AE 11)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  comments,  nearly  all  of  the
factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.,
and  1.f.  through  1.j.);  and  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a.  through  3.i.,  and  3.k.
through 3.q.). He failed to admit or deny the allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption,
so  a  denial  was  registered  for  him.  He  denied,  with  comments,  all  of  the  remaining
allegations. Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving,
first as the manager, web business, and currently as an application systems developer,
with his current employer since May 1999. A 1990 high school graduate, Applicant earned
some college credits, but no degree.  He has never served in the U.S. military. He has
never held a security clearance, but has been occupying a position of public trust since
1999.  Applicant  was  married  in  1993.  He  has  three  children,  born  in  1993,  1995,  and
1998, respectively, and is now a grandfather.
Criminal Conduct and Alcohol Consumption
Applicant  starting  consuming  alcohol  when  he  was  15-years  old.  He  eventually
generally  drank  12  12-ounce  beers  over  a  three-day  weekend,  every  weekend,  or  an
unspecified amount of alcohol every other day, to feel calm and relaxed. He estimated
that  a  half-pint  of  liquor  and  a  12-pack  of  beer  would  make  him  feel  intoxicated.  He
became  intoxicated  monthly.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  is  an  alcoholic,  but  he
contends that he stopped drinking alcohol in about June 2016.1 He indicated that after
the  2013  incident,  described  below,  he  obtained  counseling  assistance  from  the
Employee  Association  Program  (EAP),  and  he  attended  five  sessions  with  a  certified
psychologist. He was referred to Alcohol Anonymous (AA). He claimed that he regularly
attends Alcohol Anonymous (AA) three times per week, but acknowledged that he has
not been to an AA meeting during the three weeks leading up to the hearing; he has an
AA sponsor; and he attends an unspecified number of church-related Adult Children of
Alcoholics (ACOA) counseling sessions with a spiritual advisor. ACOA is an organization
intended  to  provide  a  forum  for  individuals  who  desire  to  recover  from  the  effects  of
growing up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family.
Applicant stated an intention of never picking up another drink in his life, but if he
fails in doing so, he believes he has a strong foundation and support network to help him
get back on the right track.2 Applicant failed to submit any documentation or witnesses to
support his contentions that: (1) he no longer consumes alcohol, and the date he stopped
consuming it; (2) he attends AA, or the nature of his participation; or (3) he attends ACOA,
and the nature and frequency of the meetings and counseling sessions.
The  SOR  alleged  one  incident  of  criminality  by  Applicant  in  1991,  and  another
seven incidents over a period 14 years, commencing in 2001 and continuing until 2015.
At least three of those incidents were alcohol-related:
(SOR  ¶  1.a.):  In  April  1991,  one  month  shy  of  his  19th  birthday,  Applicant  was
arrested and charged with Attempt to Commit Robbery, Conspiracy to Commit Robbery,
and Simple Assault. The two robbery-related charges were dismissed, and Applicant pled
guilty to Simple Assault. He was placed on probation for two years;3
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): In July 2001, Applicant was charged with Driving Without a License,
a misdemeanor, as opposed to the charge Driving Under Suspension (DUS). Applicant
denied  being  aware  that  his  operator’s  license  had  been  “suspended”;  although,  he
subsequently indicated that because he had a number of tickets, the license from another

state may have been suspended. He was convicted as charged. The sentence was not
reported;4
(SOR  ¶  1.c.):  In  August  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driving  Without  a
License, a misdemeanor, once again as opposed to the charge DUS. He again denied
being aware that his operator’s license had been suspended, and he thought it had been
transferred to his current state of residence during a “period of transition.” The disposition
of the charge was not reported;5
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): In  December  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driving  Under  the
Influence (DUI), Driving Without a License, and Violation ABC Law, all misdemeanors,
after  losing  control  of  his  vehicle  on  an  Interstate  highway  and  striking  a  guard  rail,
breaking his neck. Once again, he was not charged with DUS. In this instance, Applicant
acknowledged that he lost his operator’s license because of excessive parking tickets.6
He  also  acknowledged  that  he  had  consumed  four  or  five  12-ounce  beers  before  he
drove.7 Although the disposition of the charges was not reported in the FBI Identification
Record,8 Applicant indicated that he was fined;9
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): In April 2007, Applicant was charged with Fraudulent Check Under
$500 – 1st, a misdemeanor. Although Applicant denied that he was ever formally charged
with a crime related to the “inadvertently bounced” check, he was, in fact, convicted of the
charge and fined $93.73;10
(SOR  ¶  1.f.):  In  November  2012,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUS,  a
misdemeanor. He was convicted of the charge and fined $652.50;11

state statute covering the cited charge:
A person who drives a motor vehicle on a public highway of this State without a driver's
license in violation of [the section] is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction of a first
offense,  must  be  fined  not  less  than  fifty  dollars  nor  more  than  one  hundred  dollars  or
imprisoned for thirty days and, upon conviction of a second offense, be fined five hundred
dollars or imprisoned for forty-five days, or both, and for a third and subsequent offense
must be imprisoned for not less than forty-five days nor more than six months.

11 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3. According to the state
statute covering the cited charge:
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): In May 2013, after arguing with his wife and consuming “a couple of
beers” with a friend, Applicant was charged with DUI – 1st, Open Container, and DUS, all
misdemeanors;12 and he was convicted of Reckless Driving and DUS.
(SOR  ¶  1.h.):  In  December  2015,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Habitual  Traffic
Offender, a felony, DUI – 3rd, a misdemeanor, and DUS – 3rd, a misdemeanor. The DUS
charge  was  nolle  prossed,  and  the  disposition  of  the  other  charges  was  not  reported.
Applicant contended that upon his successful completion of a court ordered DUI program,
lasting  four  days  per  week  for  a  period  of  one  year,  with  random  urinalysis,  and  total
alcohol abstinence, his DUI would be expunged. He claimed he successfully completed
the program in November 2017,13 but he failed to submit any documentation about the
program, his participation in the program, or his successful completion of the program.
A person who drives a motor vehicle on a public highway of this State when the person's
license to drive is canceled, suspended, or revoked must, upon conviction, be punished as
follows:
(a) for a first offense, fined three hundred dollars or imprisoned for up to thirty days, or both;
(b) for a second offense, fined six hundred dollars or imprisoned for up to sixty consecutive
days, or both; and (c) for a third or subsequent offense, fined one thousand dollars, and
imprisoned for up to ninety days or confined to a person's place of residence pursuant to
the  Home  Detention  Act  for  up  to  ninety  days.  No  portion  of  a  term  of  imprisonment  or
confinement under home detention may be suspended by the trial judge except when the
court is suspending a term of imprisonment upon successful completion of the terms and
conditions  of  confinement  under  home  detention.  For  purposes  of  this  item,  a  person
sentenced to confinement pursuant to the Home Detention Act is required to pay for the
cost of such confinement.
(e)(i)  A  person  convicted  of  a first  or second  offense of  this  item,  as  determined  by  the
records of the department, and who is employed or enrolled in a college or university at
any time while the person's driver's license is suspended pursuant to this item, may apply
for a route restricted driver's license permitting the person to drive only to and from work
or  the  person's  place  of  education  and  in  the  course  of  the  person's  employment  or
education during the period of suspension. The department may issue the route restricted
driver's license only upon a showing by the person that the person is employed or enrolled
in a college or university and that the person lives further than one mile from the person's
place of employment or place of education.
12 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3.
13 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3; Tr. at 52-54. According to the
state statute covering the cited charge:
An  habitual  offender  shall  mean  any  person  whose  record  as  maintained  by  the
Department of Motor Vehicles shows that he has accumulated the convictions for separate
and distinct offenses described in subsections (a), (b) and (c) committed during a three-
year period; provided, that where more than one included offense shall be committed within
a one-day period such multiple offenses shall be treated for the purposes of this article as
one offense:
(a) Three or more convictions, singularly or in combination of any of the following separate
and distinct offenses arising out of separate acts: (1) Voluntary manslaughter, involuntary
manslaughter  or  reckless  homicide  resulting  from  the  operation  of  a  motor  vehicle;  (2)
Applicant  claimed  that  over  an  extended  period  of  years,  especially  when  his
operator’s license was suspended, or when he did not actually have a license, he rarely
drove  his  vehicle.  He  said  he  got  to  work  as  part  of  a  car pool  with  his  wife  or  others
driving,  and  on  other  occasions  when  the  children  were  in  the  car,  also  with  his  wife
driving. He noted that on some of occasions, such as when he was stopped by the police,
or during an emergency situation with a sick child, he was not accompanied by his wife.14
Applicant also attributed the reasons for the suspensions of his operator’s license
to  the  parking  issues;  tax  liens;  failure  to  pay  property  tax  on  the  vehicle;  or  the
cancellation of his automobile insurance.15 During the hearing, Applicant stated that he
currently  does  not  have  an  operator’s  license  as  it  was  suspended  because  of  his
designation as a habitual traffic offender.16
Financial Considerations17
Applicant acknowledged that when he started his family at the age of 21, he did
not  understand  the  value  of  a  dollar  or  what  exactly  “credit”  meant.  That  lack  of
understanding, coupled with his “alcoholism,” left him in a financial hole. He claimed to
have hired a credit repair company to assist him in rebuilding his credit,  essentially by
disputing most of the delinquent accounts listed in his credit reports, as well as financial
advisors  to  help  him  spend  his  money  wisely.18  He  failed  to  submit  documentation  to
Operating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating
liquor, narcotics or drugs; (3) Driving or operating a motor vehicle in a reckless manner; (4)
Driving a motor vehicle while his license, permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has
been suspended or revoked, except a conviction for driving under suspension for failure to
file proof of financial responsibility; (5) Any offense punishable as a felony under the motor
vehicle laws of this State or any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used;
(6) Failure of the driver of a motor vehicle involved in any accident resulting in the death or
injury of any person to stop close to the scene of such accident and report his identity;
(b) Ten or more convictions of separate and distinct offenses involving moving violations
singularly or in combination, in the operation of a motor vehicle, which are required to be
reported  to  the  department  for  which  four  or  more  points  are  assigned  pursuant  to  [the
statute] or which are enumerated in subsection (a) of this section.
(c) The offenses included in subsections (a) and (b) shall be deemed to include offenses
under any federal law, any law of another state or any municipal or county ordinance of
another state substantially conforming to the above provisions.

support  his  claims  that  a  credit  repair  company  had  been  hired;  the  identity  of  that
company;  what  that  company  had  actually  done  for him  or  in  his  behalf;  that  financial
advisors had been hired; the identity of the financial advisors; or what type of guidance
they had furnished him. Additionally, aside from Applicant’s lack or financial knowledge,
coupled  with  his  alcoholism,  it  is  unclear  how  or  when  his  financial  problems  first
emerged.
In February 2005, Applicant and his wife filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy
under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and in September 2007, that bankruptcy
was  discharged  after  the  Bankruptcy  Trustee  had  disbursed  $36,854.20  to  various
creditors, including the U.S. Treasury and the state department of revenue.19
Despite the bankruptcy discharge and the relative abatement of his financial issues
associated  with  the  Bankruptcy  Trustee’s  rejection  of  various  accounts,  within  three
years,  Applicant’s  financial  problems  mushroomed  once  again.  In  2010,  the  Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) notified him that because of errors in his income tax returns he
owed the IRS between $10,000 and $20,000, and a voluntary repayment plan withdrawal
was established, ending in approximately 2014-2015. In 2011 and 2012, several accounts
became  delinquent,  and  over  the  ensuing  years,  even  more  accounts  became
delinquent.20 In 2014, a number of tax liens were filed against him.21
In  addition  to  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  the  SOR  identified  16  purportedly
delinquent  accounts  that  had  been  placed  for  collection  or  charged  off,  as  generally
reflected  by  Applicant’s  March  2017  or October  2017  credit  reports.  Those  debts  total
approximately $12,275. The current status of those accounts is as follows:
There has been no change in the status of a vast majority of Applicant’s accounts
that  were  placed  for  collection.  While  many  of  them  were  unsuccessfully  disputed  for
reasons not explained, the following accounts remain unaddressed and unresolved, as
acknowledged by Applicant: various medical accounts with unpaid balances of $90 (SOR
¶ 1.b.); $125 (SOR ¶ 1.c.), $561 (SOR ¶ 1.d.); $225 (SOR ¶ 1.e.); $85 (SOR ¶ 1.k.); $415
(SOR ¶ 1.n.); and $760 (SOR ¶ 1.o.); and other accounts: two bank-issued credit-card

purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered:
(a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or
changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide
evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd.
Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at

2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged delinquent accounts and tax liens will be considered only for the
five purposes listed above.
accounts with unpaid balances that were charged off in the amounts of $179 (SOR ¶ 1.l.)
and $171 (SOR ¶ 1.m.); a cable-television account with an unpaid balance of $689 (SOR
¶  1.p.);  and  a  fitness  center  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $2,090,  that  Applicant
intends to start making unspecified payments to in August 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.q.).22
There are also some accounts that Applicant claims he has either made payments
to, or has paid them off. There are three medical accounts with unpaid balances of $162
(SOR ¶ 1.f.); $85 (SOR ¶ 1.g.); and $51 (SOR ¶ 1.h.).23 Applicant’s most recent credit
report reflects seven delinquent medical accounts with the same collection agent. Only
three of those accounts are alleged in the SOR. Applicant submitted a May 2018 receipt
from the collection agent, in the amount of $405.66,24 and he contended that the payment
covered all of the delinquent accounts with that one collection agent. He submitted three
letters from the collection agent indicating that ten different accounts, including the three
listed in the SOR had been settled in full.25 AE B refers to the three SOR-related accounts.
Those three accounts have been resolved.
The two remaining accounts refer to a lease with an unpaid balance of $6,507 due
to damage (SOR ¶ 1.i.) that was placed for collection; and a student loan with an unpaid
balance of $80 (SOR ¶ 1.j.).26 With respect to the former account, Applicant contends that
he reached out to the creditor and agreed to a repayment plan under which, starting in
March 2018, he would pay $100 per month.27 Regarding the latter account, he contended
that he paid the creditor the outstanding amount in June or July 2018.28 Applicant failed
to  submit  documentation  to  support  his  contentions  that  payments  had  been  made  to
either creditor, even though he indicated that he would do so if the record would be kept
open. In the absence of such documentation, neither account has been resolved.
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  requested  to  complete  a  Personal  Financial
Statement to reflect his monthly net income; monthly expenses; and a monthly remainder
available for  discretionary  saving  or spending.  He failed to  do  so. However,  during  the
hearing, he acknowledged that his annual salary was about $74,000 and his wife’s annual
salary  was  about  $125,000,  for  a  total  of  approximately  $200,000.29  He  has  less  than
$1,000  in  his  401(k),  after  withdrawing  $10,000  in  anticipation  of  closing  on  his  new

residence;  and  less  than  $1,000  at  the  end  of  each  month  for  discretionary  saving  or
spending.30 He purchased a new hybrid sport-utility vehicle (SUV) for his wife in 2016. In
response  to  a  question  as  to  why  he  failed  to  make  more  progress  with  modest  or
minimum delinquent debts with a combined annual income of $200,000, Applicant could
not respond, claiming that because “we have a ton of bills,” they are trying to adjust their
finances.  Applicant  disputed  certain  accounts  solely  because  he  disagreed  with  the
amounts  reflected.  He  was  unable  to  explain  why  his finances  went  into  such  disarray
before 2005 as to justify his filing for bankruptcy; and he was unable to explain why his
finances  deteriorated  in  2007  to  create  his  current  delinquencies.  Although  the  record
remained open, he also failed to furnish a requested updated status of his SOR-related
accounts supported by receipts, checks, or letters related to those debts; and a copy of
his repayment plan showing any priority for addressing his delinquent accounts.
Personal Conduct31
(SOR ¶ 4.a.): This allegation cross-references the SOR allegations associated with
his criminal conduct and alcohol consumption.
(SOR  ¶  4.b.):    On  January  10,  2017,  when  Applicant  completed  his  e-QIP,  he
responded to certain questions pertaining to his police record found in Section 22. Those
questions requested certain information regardless of whether the record in his case had
been sealed, expunged, or otherwise stricken from the court record, or the charge was
dismissed.  Certain  convictions,  not  relevant  here,  did  not  need  to  be  reported.  Those
questions were essentially as follows: In the past seven years have you been: a. issued
a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against you?; b.
arrested  by  any  police  officer,  sheriff,  marshal,  or  any  other  type  of  law  enforcement
official?; c. charged, convicted, or sentenced of a crime in any court?; and d. or are you
currently on probation or parole? In addition, are you currently on trial or awaiting a trial
on  criminal  charges?  Applicant  answered  “yes”  to  the  combined  questions,  and  he
reported the incident from 2013 in which he said he was charged with DUI, but reduced
to Reckless Driving, and ordered to pay a fine.32 He omitted the 2013 DUS charge, the
November 2012 DUS charge; and the December 2015 DUI, DUS, and Felony Habitual
Traffic Offender charges. He certified that his responses to those questions were “true,
complete,  and  correct”  to  the  best  of  his  knowledge  and  belief,  but,  because  of  his
omissions, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.
Applicant subsequently offered differing explanations for the omissions. He either
did not recall the 2012 or 2015 incidents; did not consider traffic incidents to be criminal;
30 Tr. at 102-107.
31 During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶ 4.a. by deleting that portion of
the allegation that reads “and 3.a. through 3.q.” There being no objection, the motion was granted, and the
SOR was amended as indicated. See Tr. at 135-138.
32 GE 1 (e-QIP, dated January 10, 2017), at 24-25; Tr. at 120-128.
misinterpreted the questions; or his claimed, but otherwise unconfirmed, stroke interfered
with his recollections. He denied deliberately failing to disclose the omitted information.
(SOR ¶ 4.c.): On January 10, 2017, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he also
responded  to  certain  questions  pertaining  to  his  finances  found  in  Section  26.  Those
questions asked if, in the past seven years, he had any bills or debts turned over to a
collection agency; or he had any account or credit card suspended or cancelled for failing
to pay as agreed. Applicant answered “no” to each of the questions.33 He certified that his
responses  to  those  questions  were  “true,  complete,  and  correct”  to  the  best  of  his
knowledge  and  belief,  but  the  responses  to  those  questions  were,  in  fact,  false.  He
omitted every one of the 16 delinquent accounts that were eventually alleged in the SOR
as  well  as  the  tax  issues  that  were  not  alleged;  even  though  those  tax  liens  were  not
resolved until 2014, well within the seven-year period of interest.
Applicant  subsequently  offered  differing  explanations  for  the  omissions.  He
claimed that at the time he completed his e-QIP, he was unaware that he had any such
delinquent  accounts;  a  creditor  reached  out  to  him  after  the  e-QIP  was  completed;  he
thought “all that stuff was off [his] credit report;”  he thought his medical bills had been
paid; he did not think that tax liens would show up on his credit report; and he did not
consider a voluntary payment to be the same as a garnishment.34 He denied deliberately
failing to disclose the omitted information.
Work Performance
A  review  of  several  years’  of  Applicant’s  annual  performance  reviews  reveals  a
number of bonus and incentive payments as well as final overall ratings that generally fall
within the “sometimes exceeds expectations” with occasional “meets expectations” and
one “consistently exceeds expectations.”35

"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b and denied SOR ¶ 1.c.
She  is  47  years  old.  She  married  in  1997  and  divorced  in  2014.  She  has  two  adult
children.1
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1989.  She  then  enlisted  in  the  U.S.
military  and  honorably  retired  in  2009.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2016.  She
has worked for various defense contractors since 2009. She has worked for her current
employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  approximately  2015.  She  was  first  granted  a
security clearance in approximately 1991.2
Applicant  started  consuming  alcohol  at  age  18,  after  she  enlisted  in  the  U.S.
military. She acknowledged that she drank to excess, at times, from age 18 to 24. She
binge drank approximately eight to nine beers twice weekly on the weekends. From age
24 to 39, she drank three to four beers or shared a bottle of wine with her then-husband
once weekly.3
In  December  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  and  convicted  of  driving  while
intoxicated  (DWI)  1st  offense  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  This  was  her  first  alcohol-related  offense.
She went to a friend’s retirement party and had two glasses of wine. She learned later
that because the wine she consumed was  homemade, it had a higher alcohol content
than store-bought wine. She did not feel impaired. On her way home, she picked up a
friend  at  a  nearby  bar  who  asked  her  for  a  ride.  She  was  pulled  over  as  she  was
dropping her friend off at his home. When the police asked her if she had been drinking,
she replied “Yes.” She was administered a breathalyzer and her blood alcohol content
(BAC) was .10%. She was sentenced to 60 days suspended, driver’s license restriction

for six months, ordered to complete a 20-hour safe driving course, and fined $450. She
complied with the court’s sentence.4
In October 2013, Applicant was charged and convicted of DWI 2nd offense (SOR
¶  1.b).  This  was  her  second  alcohol-related  offense  and  the  last  time  she  drove  after
drinking.  After  work  that  day,  she  went  directly  to  class.  She  and  several  classmates
grabbed drinks at a bar across the street after class. She had three beers. She last ate
at  noon.  She  was  tired  but  she  did  not  feel  impaired.  She  was  pulled  over  about  one
mile  from  home.  The  police  officer  told  her  that  she  was  driving  erratically,  and  she
replied  “Yes”  when  asked  if  she  had  been  drinking.  She  was  administered  a
breathalyzer and her BAC was .11%.5
Applicant  was  sentenced  to  180  days  with  150  suspended;  probation  for  three
years;  suspended  driver’s  license  for  four  months,  then  driver’s  license  restriction  for
three  years  with  an  interlock  device  installed  on  her  car  for  six  months;  ordered  to
attend  alcohol  counseling  and  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA),  and  abstain  from  alcohol;
and fined $700. She complied with the court’s sentence. She served 15 days in jail; she
successfully  completed  probation;  she  did  not  consume  any  alcohol  during  her  three-
year probation period; and she attended counseling once monthly and two AA meetings
weekly  for  36  weeks.  She  did  not  receive  an  alcohol  diagnosis,  but  learned  through
counseling  how  to  handle  her  tendency  to  make  decisions  impulsively  and  how  to
exercise mindfulness.6
In March 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with probation violation, due
to  an  alcohol  reading  registering  on  the  interlock  device  installed  on  her  car  (SOR  ¶
1.c). She denied that she consumed alcohol in violation of her probation. She testified
that  she  appeared  in  court  to  fight  the  charge,  was  found  not  guilty,  and  the  court
ordered the removal of the interlock device, which was done in July 2015. She believed
that a court record reflecting that she was found guilty of the violation was an error. The
same record reflected that she did not receive a sentence from the court in connection
with  this  offense.  She  provided  a  copy  of  another  court  record  reflecting  that  she  was
found not guilty for the same offense, and the court ordered the removal of the interlock
device in June 2015.7
Applicant testified that she resumed consuming alcohol in November 2016, when
she  had  a  glass  of  wine  with  Thanksgiving  dinner.  She  consumes  one  drink  once
monthly, and testified that she does not have a compulsion to drink more. She has no
future  intentions  of  driving  after  drinking.  On  the  occasions  where  she  knows  she  will
have  a  drink  and  have  to  get  home,  she  plans  ahead  and  arranges  for  alternate
transportation.  She  attributed  her  heavy  drinking  in  2011  and  2013  to  adjusting  to  life

after  military  retirement,  her  2010  separation,  and  her  subsequent  divorce,  while
simultaneously working and attending school. She testified, though, that she never felt
she  abused  alcohol,  and  her  alcohol  use  did  not  negatively  factor  into  her  previous
marriage.  She  testified  that  other  than  a  2013  speeding  ticket,  her  driving  record  is
clean.8
Applicant indicated that her two DUIs are common knowledge. She testified that
she told her witness and her character reference about her DUIs. Her witness was her
team supervisor since 2015. He testified that he was aware that Applicant had at least
one  DUI.  He  had  never  witnessed  Applicant  report  to  work  under  the  influence  of
alcohol.  He  had  occasions  to  observe  her  consume  alcohol  and  did  not  witness  her
consume irresponsibly. He also relied on her to serve as a designated driver for a fellow
team member several times between 2015 and 2018. He described Applicant as one of
his best analysts on a team of 23, and an exceptional worker. Her character reference
was  her  direct  supervisor  since  March  2017.  He  wrote  that  he  was  “extremely
impressed by [Applicant’s] work ethic and reliability,” and described her as a trustworthy
individual.9

"The SOR alleges under Guideline G, that Applicant was arrested and charged with
driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 2003, 2012, and 2016. It also alleges he
continued  to  consume  alcohol  despite  treatment  in  2013  where  he  was  diagnosed  as
alcohol  dependent.  Applicant  admitted  the  allegations,  with  the  explanation  that  he
stopped drinking in March 2016, and completed a 32-day inpatient rehabilitation. After a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 52-year-old lead test technician, employed by a defense contractor
since  2005.  He  completed  high  school  and  electronics  technician  school  in  1986.  He
honorably  served  in  the  United  States  Marine  Corps  from  1988  to  2004,  including
deployments  to  Afghanistan.  He  married  in  1988,  separated  in  2008,  and  divorced  in
2010. He has two children, one of which passed away in 2016. He previously held a top
secret security clearance.
In  2003,  Applicant  was  traveling  from  overseas  to  the  U.S.  for training.  He  was
arrested for driving the wrong way on a one-way road while returning to his hotel after
watching the Super Bowl. He was charged with DUI. His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was
.24%. He pleaded guilty, was placed on one-year probation, fined, and ordered to perform
community service. He was also referred to a military 30-day alcohol inpatient counseling
program. He continued to drink and drive after separating from the Marine Corps in 2004.
In 2012, Applicant was arrested for DUI after he backed his car into another car
and  failed  to  stop.  His  BAC  was  .14%,  and  he  was  charged  with  DUI.  He  agreed  to
probation and treatment before judgment. He attended a 26-day outpatient counseling,
and the charge was dismissed. Applicant did not believe he had a drinking problem, but
was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 2013. He was required to stop drinking during
the  counseling  period,  but  he  continued  to  drink.  From  2015  to  2016,  Applicant  was
counseled for being late to work and taking excessive Mondays off.
In 2016, Applicant was again stopped by police for traffic violations after drinking
on St. Patrick’s Day. His BAC was .18% and he was arrested and charged with DUI. He
pleaded  guilty,  was  sentenced  to  one-year  probation,  fined,  and  ordered  to  install  an
ignition-interlock device on his car for one year. He successfully completed the probation
and  did  not  have  any  ignition-interlock  violations.  He  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous
(AA) in 2016.
As a result of a desire to change his lifestyle, Applicant stopped drinking alcohol
on March 27, 2016. He realized on Easter morning, that he needed to stop drinking and
should have been in church services. He believed he was too weak to accomplish sobriety
on  his  own,  so  he  attended  a  32-day  residential  recovery  and  treatment  program
(including four extra days) with 24-hour monitoring, strict supervision, daily breathalyzer
tests,  and  certified  drug/alcohol  counselors.  No  medications  were  prescribed.  He  also
voluntarily  attended  an  additional  48-week  outpatient  aftercare  program,  which  he
completed  in  June  2017.  Finally,  he  attended  self-help  meetings  regularly,  and  was
required to remain clean and sober. He stopped associating with friends  with whom he
drank in the past, and attended a Mothers against Drunk Driving (MaDD) victim impact
panel in February 2017.
The director of Applicant’s counseling program noted that Applicant made great
progress in the program, was courteous, cooperative, compliant, and had demonstrated
a committed willingness to address his substance use issues. He attended all required
sessions  regularly  and  with  punctuality,  and  engaged  in  all  counseling  sessions  and
educational seminars. He willingly took suggestions to keep his sobriety at the forefront,
and remains in contact with his counselors, attends alumni meetings, and often visits with
the  staff.  He  notes  that  Applicant  has  “truly  embraced  a  lifestyle  of  recovery  and
expressed his excitement for his recovery.” He remains steadfast in his program and is
expected to remain clean and sober as long as he continues to put in the work.
Applicant’s supervisor and coworkers have noted a change in Applicant after he
stopped drinking. He was no longer taking Monday’s off and borrowing vacation time, he
requested  a  change  in  schedule  to  allow  him  to  focus  on  changing  his  lifestyle  and
manage  his home  life,  and  has  been  a  model  employee.  He  is  lauded  for his  positive
attitude, reliability, and conscientiousness. Another coworker stated that Applicant was
responsible, honest and ethical, and was promoted to a group lead position since 2016.
Another coworker that has known Applicant for 13 years, attested to his struggles with
divorce and the loss of his child, but that he has remained alcohol free and continues to
maintain  self-control.  Finally,  a  long-standing  friend  who  used  to  drink  with  Applicant,
testified that he has not seen him drink in the past two years.
Applicant  testified  that  his  family  has  struggled  with  alcoholism  for  many  years.
Applicant’s brother and mother testified on his behalf. Applicant has been living with his
brother for five years. His brother has been sober since 1991, and has not seen Applicant
drink since March 2016. His mother sees Applicant about once per week. She testified
that  Applicant  used  to  spend time  in  bars, but  now  he  stays  away  from  them  and  has
remained  sober  since  2016.  She  has  seen  big  changes  to  his  personality  since  he
stopped  drinking,  and  she  can  tell  if  he  is  drinking.  He  has  helped  others  with  alcohol
problems and she is very proud of him. She said the last counseling program was the
best thing that happened to him. He is now open and talkative rather than introverted; a
pleasure to be around.

"Applicant is 39 years old. He graduated from high school in 2003 and he completed
some college.  He enlisted in the Air National Guard (ANG) in 2003 and served honorably
for 13½ years until late 2016.  Applicant was married in February 2018 and he reports no
children. (Tr. 40-46) He deployed three times overseas  Qatar (2005), Kyrgyzstan (2009),
and Qatar again (2011). (Tr. 42) He attained the rank of staff sergeant (E-5) and served
as a warehouse supervisor and logistician. Applicant earned numerous military awards
including two Air Force Achievement Medals. (Tr. 44) In February 2018, he moved with
his wife from state A to state B  for a pending job offer with a federal contractor in state
B, which is why he needs a security clearance. (Tr. 24, 56)
On  November  21,  2016,  Applicant  signed  a  Security  Clearance  Application
(SCA),2  and  in  section 22  (Police  Record) he  disclosed an  arrest for  driving  under  the
influence (DUI) of alcohol in state A in July 2009. In his Answer to the SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant
stated that he was drinking to celebrate a friend’s birthday, after a military trip. Applicant
made a mistake in driving his friend to various bars while consuming alcohol. Applicant
drove into a DUI checkpoint one mile from his home, where he was arrested and charged
with DUI, first offense. He obtained an attorney and pled guilty to a reduced charge of
reckless driving. Nonetheless, he was required to have an interlock device installed on
his vehicle for nine months, to insure no recurrences.
Applicant  disclosed  his  arrest  for  DUI,  second  offense,  in  September  2010,  as
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. He was out partying with friends in a bar, but he had pre-established
his girlfriend as his designated driver for that evening. (Tr. 49-50) However, after several
rounds of drinks, Applicant noticed that she was also drinking and unable to drive them
all  home  in  her  van.  Applicant  ingested  several  beers  and  shots  of  whiskey.  (Answer)
They tried to call a taxi cab, but it was 4 a.m. After trying unsuccessfully for several hours,
Applicant decided he could drive his girlfriend’s van (sans interlock device) himself. (Tr.
50) He was stopped and arrested for DUI. He pled guilty to DUI, first offense, since the
earlier charge was reduced to reckless driving. (Tr. 50) He disclosed that he was ordered
to seek alcohol counseling, which he completed, and pay court costs and a fine.
Applicant’s third alcohol-related incident occurred in October 2015 when he was
arrested and charged with DUI and driving on a revoked license. The latter charge was

dismissed as a mistake since Applicant’s license had merely expired. (Answer) Applicant
had recently lost his best friend to addiction and he was grieving. He went to a local bar
within two miles of his home to watch football and play in a fantasy football league. (Tr.
51) He was there for seven hours and ingested five beers and two shots of whiskey. He
had  eaten  lunch, and an appetizer  later. When he  left, he  was  pulled over  by  a  police
cruiser while turning into his housing development. Applicant testified that he respectfully
declined the field sobriety test because he had recently had knee surgery. (Tr. 77) This
was  immediately  reported  to  Applicant’s  chain  of  command  at  the  ANG,  and  he  was
forced to resign his full-time position while being discharged after 13 ½ years of service
with  a  general  under  honorable  conditions  discharge.  Applicant  was  in  the  process  of
having a home built with his fiance’ (now wife) and he did not have the funds available to
vigorously contest the DUI charge.
Although he was adamant that he was not intoxicated in the October 2015 incident,
Applicant pled guilty to DUI. Applicant was sentenced to five days in jail. He also paid
court costs and fines, was ordered to install an interlock device until 2019, and attend a
state A DUI safety and treatment program. He started the education component of that
program  in  January  2016  and  completed  six  weeks  of  three-hour  lectures.  Then,  he
completed six weeks of the intervention portion, completing the entire program in June
2016. He was diagnosed as alcohol use disorder (AUD) moderate during his treatment.
(records attached to Answer) Applicant also voluntarily attended Alcoholic’s Anonymous
(AA) meetings, and he intends to continue to attend AA meetings in his newly adopted
home state. (Tr. 58)
Applicant testified credibly that he had his last drink in November 2016 and he is
a changed man since getting married and moving. (Tr. 82) He is no longer exposed to a
culture of profligate alcohol consumption. It broke his heart to get discharged and lose his
chosen career. (Tr. 85) He is coaching baseball and football and hopes to start a family
soon in his recently purchased home in state B.  He self-reported all of his offenses, and
he has cooperated fully in the background investigation. Applicant provided four favorable
character reference letters, which all attest to his integrity, work ethic, and trustworthiness.
(AE A-D) He fully disclosed his offenses to his new federal contractor employer. (Tr. 85)

"In his SOR answer, Applicant denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, and admitted SOR ¶
1.c.  He  submitted  comments  in  mitigation  and  explanation.  Because  SOR  ¶  2.a  cross
alleges  the  same  facts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1,  he  submitted  the  same  answers  for  both
SOR  paragraphs.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  53  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  1983,  and  shortly
thereafter,  he  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Navy.  He  honorably  served  on  active  duty  until  his
discharge in 1989. (AE 5) He possessed a clearance while in the service. He married in
1991 and divorced in 1998. He has an adult son of this marriage.
Applicant has been working for federal contractors since 2001. He has received
good  evaluations  and  is  well-regarded  by  his  employers.  (AE  4)  He  noted  that  of  the
160 employees working for his employer in 2006-2007, only he and 12 other employees
have  been  continued  to  present.  Applicant  has  been  promoted  twice,  and  has
possessed a clearance since 1993. His clearance was upgraded to top-secret in 1996,
which has been continued to present. He seeks the continuation of his clearance which
is required for his work with his current employer.
In response to Section 22 (Police Record) of his 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed
he was involved in an alcohol-related conviction for malicious bodily injuring (a felony) in
April 2010. He arrived at a bar at about 7:30 p.m. to watch a couple of hockey games,
and left the bar at about 1:45 a.m. He testified that he only drank four beers during the
six-hour  period. Applicant  claimed that  on  his  way  home he  was  threatened  by  a  man
who  was  also  at  the  bar  watching  the  games.  He  assaulted  the  man.  Applicant  was
found guilty at a jury trial of malicious bodily injuring, and required to make restitution of
$1,250. Applicant claimed he was not intoxicated, and that he was the victim to a bad
investigation.
In April 2011, Applicant arrived at a bar for dinner and to watch some games. He
claimed that he only consumed four beers over a six to seven-hour period. At about 2
a.m., when the bar closed, Applicant went to a restaurant to eat. After a couple of hours
at  the  restaurant,  he  was  involved  in  an  altercation  with  three  police  officers.  Alcohol
use was noted in the police report. He was charged with resisting arrest, obstructing a
police  officer,  and  disorderly  conduct.  The  charges  were  later  dismissed  due  to  the
police officers’ failure to appear. Applicant repeatedly claimed he was not drunk and that
he was the victim of police misconduct.
During  his  March  2017  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  Applicant
disclosed that he was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol in 2016.
Applicant  and  coworkers  went  to  a  bar  to  eat  and  celebrate  the  completion  of  a  job.
They  arrived  at  the  bar  at  about  8:00  p.m.,  and  stayed  until  the  bar  closed  at  2  a.m.
Applicant  claimed  he  consumed  four  beers  and  two  shots  of  scotch.  He  was  arrested
while  weaving  on  the  road.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI  and  was  sentenced  to  one-year
probation;  fined  $2,000;  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  one  year,  with  driving
privileges  for  work;  breathalyzer  in  the  car,  and  to  attend  VA  ASAP  classes.  He  has
complied with all the terms of his sentence. (AE 7)
Applicant reported all the above incidents to his facility security officer and in his
SCA. He has continued to consume alcoholic beverages, but averred he drinks once a
week,  three  to  four  beers  per  occasion.  Applicant  denied  having  a  drinking  problem.
There  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  he  has  been  diagnosed  with  any  alcohol  use
disorder.  He  credibly  testified  that  he  has  learned  a  valuable  lesson  as  a  result  of  his
DUI conviction. He no longer drives after consuming alcohol. He now uses the services
of taxis, a designated driver, or ride-sharing companies to avoid drinking and driving.
Applicant submitted five favorable reference statements. (AE 8) He is considered
to  be  responsible,  dependable,  hardworking,  diligent,  honest,  and  trustworthy.  His
references lauded his work ethic, performance, knowledge, and specialized skills. They
recommended his eligibility for a clearance. His supervisor noted that Applicant follows
security rules and procedures.

"After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I find that SOR ¶ 1.f does
not allege additional conduct of security concern, but rather reflects the disposition for the
offenses covered in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e. My findings of fact are as follows:
Applicant is a 24-year-old high school graduate, who completed certificate programs
to be a nurse’s aide in late 2013 and an automotive technician in July 2016.  He is not
married  but  is  in  a  cohabitant  relationship  with  his  fiancée.  They  have  a  two-year-old
daughter. (GEs 1-2; AE A; Tr. 20, 26-27, 32.) Applicant is employed in automobile sales,
but  he  has  an  offer  of  defense-contractor  employment  contingent  on  him  obtaining  a
security clearance. (Tr. 27-28.)
Applicant began using mood-altering substances as a teenager. He was influenced
by friends in his environment and used marijuana on a daily basis with two friends from
June 2010 to June 2014. He purchased the drug from those friends, and he sold marijuana
to his friends. The date when he started drinking alcohol is not in the record, although he
volunteered that he drank alcohol in quantity of five drinks or more to intoxication until early
2015, when he then moderated his consumption. (GE 4; Tr. 30, 70.)
Applicant also began committing crimes as a teenager. At age 15 in July 2009,
Applicant broke into some vehicles with a friend and stole loose change and a GPS unit.
He  was  charged  with  felony  burglary  and  placed  on  two  years  of  probation.  In
approximately July 2011, Applicant was loitering at a local baseball field with three friends
when the police arrived. Intoxicated from drinking at a party earlier that night, Applicant ran
into a pharmacy and stole five packs of cigarettes. He was given accelerated rehabilitation
for the theft. (GEs 1, 4.)
The month following his high school graduation, Applicant started the nurse’s aide
program at a local community college in July 2011. That September, he began working a
part-time retail job. (GEs 1, 4.)
On March 20, 2012, Applicant was arrested for sale of a controlled substance, a
felony.1 He was a passenger in a vehicle with some friends when they were pulled over by
the state police for a brake light issue. The police smelled marijuana because Applicant
and his friends had been smoking the drug in the backseat, and Applicant had multiple
bags of marijuana in his jacket. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 52-53.) Applicant completed court-ordered
treatment for his marijuana use from September 2012 to November 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 37.)
1 During his subject interview, Applicant recalled the offense as occurring in May 2012, and that he was at a
carnival with three bags of marijuana to sell and to smoke. He indicates that an unknown individual walked up
to him and gave him a cell phone for the marijuana. Applicant was then arrested in a vehicle in the parking lot.
(GE 4.) An FBI record shows that he was arrested in March 2012 for sale of a controlled substance. (GE 3.)
The statute Applicant violated, Section 21a-277(b) provides in part:
(b) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds,
transports with intent to sell or dispense, possesses with intent to sell or dispense, offers,
gives  or  administers  to  another  person  any  controlled  substance,  except  a  narcotic
substance, or a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, except as authorized in this
chapter, may, for the first offense, be fined not more than twenty-five thousand dollars or be
imprisoned  not  more  than  seven  years  or  be  both  fined  and  imprisoned;  and,  for  each
subsequent  offense,  may  be  fined  not  more  than  one  hundred  thousand  dollars  or  be
imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or be both fined and imprisoned.
The FBI record does not indicate that he was arrested for possession with intent to sell as alleged in the SOR,
although intent to sell would violate the same statute.
Applicant sold marijuana with some regularity, including at times once or twice a
week, from 2012 to September 2014. He sold the drug usually to friends and “here and
there” to friends of his friends. His profit from the marijuana sales was usually enough for
him to purchase more for his personal consumption. (Tr. 35-37, 45.)
On  April 7, 2012, Applicant was stopped for OUI and reckless driving, although
formal charges were not filed against him until December 2012. Applicant had consumed
alcohol at a party when his companion suggested that he drive because he appeared to be
more sober. He drove her to another party, where Applicant became “totally drunk.” He
then  drove  three  friends  to  a  store,  but  on  returning  to  the  party  with  his  friends,  he
“blacked out” and crashed his vehicle into a house. Applicant was unconscious, and broke
his neck and back in the accident. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 56-61.) He was ordered into alcohol
counseling following his arrest in December 2012, which he completed. (Tr. 38-39.)
Applicant was terminated from his part-time retail job in July 2012 after he failed to
report for work. He failed to keep track of his work schedule and was often tardy. Applicant
also  speculates  that  his  co-workers  may  have  told  his  supervisor  that  he  smelled  of
marijuana. He had rolled a “blunt” in the bathroom the day before his termination, although
he claims it was for future use. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 43-44.)
Applicant was unemployed from July 2012 to June 2013. He supported himself by
selling marijuana. He also spent his time partying. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 44.) On June 17, 2013,
Applicant was sitting on his porch when a minor age 15 or 16 spat at him. It escalated into
a physical altercation. A few weeks later, the police charged Applicant with risk of injury, a
felony, and with assault, 3rd degree, and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. (GEs 1,
3-4;  Tr.  62-64.)  Applicant  now  asserts  that  he  “just  basically  restrained”  the  minor  by
putting him in a headlock to calm him down.2 He denies that he injured the youth in any
way and attributes his arrest to the youth’s brother, who disliked Applicant. (Tr. 64.)
Applicant worked as a part-time cashier at a doughnut shop from June 2013 to
August 2013. He was late for work several times because he was out too late partying and
did not report for his 5:00 a.m. shift. He was issued written warnings three or four times
before being fired for tardiness. Applicant was unemployed for the next year. He supported
himself by selling marijuana. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 45.)
On March 1, 2014, Applicant was arrested for felony sale of a controlled substance
and for misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Applicant was stopped by the police in
2 Applicant testified about the July 2013 assault of a minor, as follows:
They said that [the minor] was bleeding. And they said that he was hurt. But the only thing I
did to him was I put him in a headlock and I had to calm him down. He kept trying to swing at
me. But I already knew that he was young and underage. So I just basically restrained him.
And even after the fact that he spit on me even after everything got broken up and all that
stuff. (Tr. 64.)
route to a party after he threw something from his vehicle. He had three bags of marijuana
on him to sell at a party, and he smelled of marijuana.3 (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 65-66.)
On June 26, 2014, Applicant was arrested for felony possession of marijuana, felony
sale of a controlled substance, felony conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to sell,
and  felony  conspiracy  to  sell  a  controlled  substance.  A  friend  contacted  him  about
purchasing some marijuana from him in a local parking lot. When Applicant arrived, the
police  arrested  him  for  selling  marijuana  for  financial  profit.  He  had  four  ounces  of
marijuana in his possession. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 66-67.) Applicant asserts that he ceased his
marijuana use in June 2014 because it made him feel “demotivated.” (GE 4.) He continued
to  sell  marijuana  until  September  2014  to  pay  for  his  lawyer.  He  possessed  some
marijuana after his arrest and he “wasn’t going to give it away.” (Tr. 45-46.)
With the aforesaid criminal charges still pending against him for offenses committed
since March 2012, Applicant began working part time as a cashier at a sporting goods
store  in  September  2014.  He  was  terminated  in  November  2014  after  he  was  caught
stealing. He is ineligible for rehire. Applicant attempted to steal some food from the store
because he did not have enough money to pay for lunch. He was making “wrong decision
after wrong decision.” (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 46-47.) Applicant lived at home with his mother, and
she supported him financially when he was unemployed from November 2014 to January
2015. (GE 4.)
In January 2015, Applicant began working as a part-time cook at a pizza restaurant.
He left the job in March 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 46.) According to the employer, he is not eligible
for rehire because he was slow and did not follow instructions. Applicant held a second
part-time job at a fast-food establishment from February 2015 to February or March 2016,
when he resigned to spend time with  his child and focus on his training to become an
automotive technician, which he had started in July 2015. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 50.)
Pursuant to a plea deal, on March 9, 2015, Applicant pleaded guilty to the March
2012 felony sale of a controlled substance and the April 2012 misdemeanor OUI (arrested
in December 2012). In exchange, the prosecutor entered nolle prosequi dispositions for the
April 2012 reckless driving infraction and all of the criminal charges filed against him since
July 2013.4 Applicant was sentenced for OUI to six months in jail (suspended); 18 months
of supervised probation, to be served concurrent with his probation for the felony drug
charge;  a  fine  of  $500;  and  100  hours  of  community  service.  For  the  felony  sale  of  a
controlled substance, he was sentenced to five years in jail, suspended; three years of
supervised  probation;  and  50  hours  of  community  service.  (GEs  1,  3-4;  Tr.  67-70.)  In
approximately May 2015, Applicant cut his ties with those friends involved with marijuana.
(Tr. 33.)
3 During his subject interview in March 2017, Applicant inaccurately recalled the possession and drug sale
charges as occurring in September 2013. (GE 4.)
4 A nolle prosequi (shortened as “nolle” in the FBI record) is a formal entry on the record by a prosecutor by
which he or she declares that there will be no further prosecution.
Applicant was drug tested during his probation on a regular basis, and all of the
tests  were  negative.  (Tr.  70.)  He  was  also  required  to  complete  counseling  for  his
marijuana use and to complete an Ignition Interlock Device (IID) Program. Applicant had
substance abuse counseling from  April 2015 to July 2015, which he asserts “definitely
started to drive [him], wake [him] up a little bit in the right direction.” (Tr. 40-41.) On his
completion of the IID program on September 26, 2016, the interlock device was removed
from his vehicle. He successfully completed his probations for the OUI on September 9,
2016, and for the felony sale of a controlled substance on March 9, 2018. (GEs 1, 3-4; AEs
B-C.)
As part of his employment application to work for his defense-contractor employer,
Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) on October 29, 2015. He disclosed his arrest record; his use of marijuana
(“Smoked a blunt once a day”) from June 2010 to June 2014; his sales of marijuana to his
friends once or twice a week from May 2012 to June 2014 “due to the surroundings in
which  the  substance  brought  upon  [him];”  and  his  completion  of  counseling  for  his
marijuana use in 2012 and 2015. He denied any intention to use marijuana in the future for
the following reason:
Marijuana has changed my life in a very negative way. Bad characteristics
had been introduced and held onto, through this substance. Through me
quitting this substance I’m more motivated and ready to pursue my career
and maintain a happy standard of living. (GE 1.)
In July 2016, Applicant earned his automotive technician certificate. (GE 4; Tr. 20.)
He has since worked in the automotive industry, primarily in sales, without any adverse
incidents. (GEs 1, 4.)
On March 2, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant discussed his criminal charges, his
marijuana use, his alcohol use, and his involuntary termination from some previous jobs.
He indicated that the date of his last use of marijuana was accurately reported on his SF
86 and that he was no longer associating with any known illegal drug users. About his
alcohol use, he indicated that his drinking had decreased since early 2015 to once a month
and not to intoxication. He admitted that he drank to intoxication once a week until early
2015. He denied any intention to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. He
did not expect his drinking habit to change in the future. (GE 4.)
On September 20, 2017, Applicant responded to interrogatories from the DOD CAF
concerning his illegal drug use. He indicated that he had used cannabis a total of 20 times
in 2011, 2012, and 2014. He responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he
had ever purchased, sold, transported, or manufactured the drug. He also listed a one-time
use of Xanax in 2015, which was apparently obtained from his mother-in-law who has a
prescription. He was working and going to school and used it as a sleep aid. (Tr. 41-42.)
He denied any use of marijuana since his arrest in March 2014.5 Applicant indicated that
5 Applicant disclosed discrepantly on his SF 86 that he used marijuana (“smoked a blunt once a day”) to June
he did not have any illegal drugs or paraphernalia in his possession and that he had no
current association with any illegal drug users.  He also responded “Yes” to whether he had
ever participated in any drug or alcohol rehabilitation program and disclosed that he had
inpatient therapeutic meetings from March 2015 to June 2015. (GE 2.)
At his hearing, Applicant testified that he has put his past behind him and wanted
the opportunity to work for the defense contractor that is sponsoring him for a clearance.
(Tr. 24-25.) He denies any marijuana use since June 2014 and any current association with
illegal drug users. He spends his time outside of work with his fiancée and their daughter.
He and his fiancée began dating around the time of his last arrest in 2014, and they are
currently cohabitants. (Tr. 32, 73.) His fiancée works as a dental assistant. (Tr. 32-33.) He
attributes his turnaround to his probation officer, who became a mentor to him. (Tr. 72.)

"Under Guideline G, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested and charged with
public intoxication in 2004, and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 2008, twice
in 2013, and in 2015. This conduct is cross-alleged under Guideline E. Applicant admits
each of the allegations under Guideline G, but denies the allegations under Guideline E,
stating  that  he  does  not  think  Guideline  E  is  applicable.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 40-year-old project manager employed by a defense contractor since
May 2012. He received his bachelor’s degree in 2012. He has held a security clearance
since 2013. (GX 1.)
Applicant  began  drinking  alcohol  when  he  was  15  years  old.  In  March  2004,
Applicant  was  walking  home  in  a  college  town  when  the  police  noticed  that  he  was
staggering and arrested him, charging him with public intoxication. He paid a $2,000 fine
and was released.
In  December  2008,  after  attending  several  Christmas  parties  with  his  cousin,
Applicant was pulled over and arrested and charged with DUI. His license was suspended
for six months, he was fined, and he was required to take an alcohol education course.
In August 2013, Applicant was at a bachelor party in another town. He left the party
to go purchase more beer, and was stopped for a broken tail light. The officer suspected
that Applicant was driving under the influence of alcohol, but Applicant would not submit
to  a  breathalyzer.  Applicant  was  arrested  under  the  suspicion  of  DUI.  He  pled  guilty,
served one year probation, and attended DUI awareness classes.
In November 2013, Applicant was driving to the airport at approximately 2:00 a.m.
when  he  was  stopped  at  an  alcohol  checkpoint.  The  officer  claimed  that  he  smelled
alcohol  on  Applicant.  Applicant  told  the  officer  that  he  had  not  been  drinking  and
requested a field sobriety test. The officer refused, and upon discovering that Applicant
was  driving  on  a  suspended  license,  the  officer  arrested  Applicant.  He  was  released
approximately 90 minutes after the arrest. Applicant appeared in court and the DUI and
driving on suspended charges were both dismissed.
In  December  2015,  after  recently  returning  from  working  in  Asia,  Applicant
attended  a  company  party,  where  he  consumed  several  beers.  On  his  way  home,
Applicant took a wrong turn and ultimately ran out of gas. He fell asleep in his car, and
someone  notified  the  police.  The  police  arrived,  awoke  Applicant,  who  appeared
disoriented, and required him to perform field sobriety tests. Applicant failed the tests and
was arrested and charged with DUI. In June 2016, Applicant pled guilty, was sentenced
to 48 hours in jail, his license was suspended, and he was required to install a vehicle
interlock system. Applicant was also required to attend 12 hours of alcohol awareness
training and was placed on one year probation.
Applicant timely reported the 2015 and 2013 charges to his facility security officer
(FSO).  Following  his  2015  DUI  arrest,  Applicant  became  concerned  about  his  use  of
alcohol  and  the  resulting  consequences.  In  July  2016,  Applicant  voluntarily  sought  an
alcohol evaluation and treatment with a psychiatrist. Applicant reported to the psychiatrist
that he began abusing drugs, including cocaine and Xanax, when he was 16 years old.
In 2000, when Applicant was 21 years old, he awoke in the hospital following an apparent
overdose. Applicant voluntarily entered an inpatient rehabilitation facility for three months
and participated in outpatient treatment for nine months for cocaine and prescription drug
addiction. Following his successful completion of treatment, Applicant was drug-free until
2002, when he relapsed for one night. He has not used any cocaine or other illegal drugs
or misused any prescription drugs since that time. (AX A; GX 5; GX 1.)
The psychiatrist evaluated Applicant and determined that he had an alcohol use
disorder  with  a  history  of  stimulant  and  sedative  dependence  use  disorder  that  was
presently in remission. The psychiatrist’s recommended treatment was for Applicant to
refamiliarize  himself  with  the  treatment  model  he  learned  from  his  previous  drug
rehabilitation, limit his alcohol use, and use diversion techniques, such as exercise and
dating. Additionally, the treatment plan requires Applicant to meet with the psychiatrist at
least  annually,  and  to  maintain  telephonic  contact  periodically.  Further,  Applicant  was
required to agree to permit the psychiatrist to maintain contact with Applicant’s brother
who reports his observations of Applicant’s overall behavior and specifically alcohol use
to the psychiatrist. (AX A.)
Applicant met with the psychiatrist in March 2018. As a result of that meeting, the
psychiatrist produced a written report which includes a summary of Applicant’s personal
history,  his drug  rehabilitation  treatment,  his DUIs,  and  references their  July  2016  and
June 2017 sessions. The report states that Applicant acknowledges his previous pattern
of maladaptive alcohol use, has taken positive actions to overcome his problem, and has
complied  with  the  requirements  of  his  treatment.  (AX  A.) The  psychiatrist  testified  that
Applicant’s alcohol use disorder has been in remission since 2016, and that his prognosis
is good. (Tr. 85; Tr. 89.)
Applicant accepts full responsibility and is remorseful for his actions. He currently
consumes one or two beers a few nights a week, and at a social event or on the weekend,
he  sometimes  consumes  4  to  5  beers per occasion.  He  does  not  drink  to  the  point  of
intoxication. (Tr. 46.) Following his 2016 DUI conviction, Applicant was required to have
an interlock device installed on his vehicle for 12 months. He voluntarily maintained the
interlock device for an additional six months. He does not ever drink alcohol then drive.
(Tr. 48.) Applicant regularly travels for work outside the United States, and for his personal
safety and professional integrity, rarely consumes any alcohol. (GX 4; Tr. 37.) Applicant
is dedicated to his job. In his free time, Applicant spends time with his brother and his
family, exercises, socializes, and volunteers. (Answer.)
Applicant’s  current  supervisor,  who  initially  hired  Applicant,  was  aware  of
Applicant’s history of alcohol-related arrests. Applicant’s supervisor testified that following
the  2015  DUI  arrest, he  determined  that  Applicant  must follow  strict  requirements  and
guidelines in order to maintain his employment with the company. Specifically, Applicant
could not have any more alcohol-related incidents and he must participate in and comply
with  alcohol  treatment.  Applicant  gave  permission  for  his  supervisor  to  independently
consult  with  Applicant’s  psychiatrist  regarding  Applicant’s  treatment.  Additionally,
Applicant voluntarily discussed the details of his treatment program with his supervisor.
Applicant  has  complied  with  these  requirements.  Applicant’s  supervisor  states  that
Applicant accepts responsibility for his past, poor decisions, and that Applicant has made
positive personal changes. Throughout Applicant’s employment, his supervisor has never
seen  Applicant  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  while  at  work.  Applicant’s  supervisor
continues to support Applicant and highly recommends the continuation of his security
clearance. Applicant’s supervisor also states that Applicant is trustworthy, dependable,
reliable, and responsible. (Tr. 105-106; AX B.)
Applicant’s coworkers and friends, all of whom are aware of the allegations in the
SOR, collectively state that Applicant is a dedicated professional with good character and
integrity  who  is  honest  and  trustworthy.  They  do  not  see  any  current  signs  of  alcohol
abuse. They highly recommend the continuance of Applicant’s security clearance. (AX C
through AX H.) Applicant’s lifelong friend, who saw Applicant immediately following the
2015 DUI arrest, has observed Applicant’s remorse and acceptance of responsibility for
his  past  conduct,  and  has  witnessed  positive  changes  in  Applicant’s  attitude  and
behavior. (AX D.)

"Applicant is 49, separated from his wife, and has two children. He is seeking to
retain a security clearance in connection with his work with the DoD.
Applicant graduated from the United States Naval Academy and served on active
duty with the Navy from 1992 through 2015, when he retired as a commander (O-5). He
has  two  master’s  degrees.  He  has  worked  for  his  present  employer  since  2015  as  an
acquisition management professional. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections  12, 13A, and
15; Appellant Exhibits C, D, E, and O.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he uses intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR,
with explanations.
Applicant had been a habitual alcohol user for many years. Starting around 2000,
he drank throughout most of the rest of his military career. Other than several brief periods
of  abstinence,  the  longest  lasting  several  months,  he  drank  almost  daily,  often  having
blackouts on weekends. (Tr. 20-22, 26-28, 51-52.)
Applicant’s first alcohol-related arrest occurred on August 23, 2003, when he was
attending an advanced education course for the Navy. He had gone out with friends and
drank  too  much,  then  was  arrested  when  he  attempted  to  drive  home.  He  plead  nolo
contendere  and  was  sentenced  to  probation  for  five  years,  along  with  a  fine,  various
alcohol-education courses, and jail time. Applicant successfully completed all aspects of
the sentence. While Applicant continued to drink excessively from 2003 to 2011, he did
not have any alcohol-related arrests. (Government Exhibits 2 and 3; Applicant Exhibit L;
Tr. 22-26, 52.)
The second arrest occurred on November 16, 2014, when Applicant was assigned
to a major Navy command. He and his wife were at a formal dinner where he became
extremely intoxicated. Applicant and his wife had a fight, and he began to walk home.
Eventually, he stopped and fell asleep on the side of the road. He was arrested by police
for Disorderly Conduct and Public Intoxication. He spent the night in the drunk tank. The
decision was made not to press charges and Applicant was released in the morning with
no further proceedings. (Government Exhibits 3 at 9, 4, and 5; Tr. 28-31, 53.)
After  his  retirement  in  early  2015  Applicant’s  drinking  increased.  Applicant
admitted that his drinking affected his work, though he stated that he was never under the
influence  of  alcohol  at  work.  He  would  leave  work  early  to  meet  friends  and  drink,  or
occasionally  would  not  come  into  work  after  drinking  the  night  before.  (Government
Exhibit 2 at 6; Tr. 46-47, 63-65.)
Applicant’s third alcohol-related arrest occurred on March 17, 2016. This was 16
months after his last arrest. Applicant became extremely intoxicated on St. Patrick’s Day.
He drove with a high blood-alcohol level and was arrested after going the wrong way on
a one-way street. Applicant plead guilty and was sentenced to probation for five years, a
fine, to perform public service, and to attend various alcohol-related education programs.
He completed all the requirements of his sentence, except his probation that runs until
2021. (Applicant Exhibit M; Tr. 32-37, 54-56.)
Around the time of his last arrest Applicant began to realize that he had problems
with alcohol. At that point he began voluntarily  getting personal therapy. Applicant has
attended  therapy  with  several  counselors.  One  of  them  diagnosed  Applicant  with  a
Substance Use Disorder. (Applicant Exhibits A, K, and N; Tr. 39-43, 65-69.)
Applicant also began attending AA on a regular basis beginning in March 2016,
though he continued to drink, sometimes heavily, for about a year after starting AA. He
has a sponsor and stated he has been clean and sober since June 23, 2017. Applicant
stated that AA is part of his life, and he is working at creating a sober lifestyle for himself.
(Applicant Exhibits P and Q; Tr. 37-41, 43-48, 56-62, 68-73.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national
security  eligibility  because  he  has  engaged  in  conduct  of  a  criminal  nature.  Applicant
admitted the single allegation with explanations.
2.a The SOR alleged the  three arrests discussed above under Paragraph 1 are
also cognizable under this paragraph as criminal conduct.

"Applicant is a 48-year-old male with medical training received in the military. He
is  currently  unemployed  with  a  job  offer  pending  from  a  defense  contractor.  Applicant
honorably  served  in  the  United  States  military  for  over  24  years,  mostly  spent  as  a
special  forces  medic  with  a  top  secret  security  clearance.  He  has  taken  a  number  of
college-level  courses  and  completed  a  medical  certification  program.  He  is  currently
separated from his third spouse.
In January 2004, when he was serving in the military, Applicant and colleagues
were celebrating the completion of a three-year course. Driving in his new Mustang after
leaving  a  bar,  he  was  caught  driving  90  miles  per  hour  in  a  50  miles-per-hour-speed-
limit. He did not realize how fast he was going. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC)
level measured at 0.18. and he was arrested for driving while impaired (DWI). He was
reprimanded  through  the  military  with  a  general  officer  memorandum.  He  was  neither
ordered to seek, nor sought, treatment or counseling after the incident.
In  2014,  around  the  time  he  was  honorably  discharged  from  the  military,
Applicant  and  his  now-estranged  wife  prepared  to  move  to  a  new  state  so  he  could
apply  to  a  particular  academic  program.  His  wife’s  ex-husband  objected  to  her  taking
their  children  out of  state,  and  a  court  order  made  her return them  so  the ex-husband
could  continue  visitation  rights  until  a  hearing  could  be  held.  The  wife  and  children
returned,  but  the  hearing  was  postponed.  Meanwhile,  Applicant  remained  in  the  new
state  until  the  court  finally  convened  and  declared  the  family  could  not  move  the
children away. Once reunited, Applicant found it difficult to find a job, although his wife
had found work relatively quickly. Having to be at the dictates of his wife’s “terrible” ex-
husband  “broke  her  spirit.  .  .  .  she’s  never  been  the  same,  still  now.  And  she  started
isolating  herself.  [She  and  Applicant]  weren’t  communicating.”  (Tr.  23)  Applicant  was
unsure what was happening to them and he began drinking alcohol more often.
In  January  2016,  Applicant  went  to  the  basement  to  remind  his  17-year-old
stepson not to be “vaping” in the house, and to focus more on his studies than on sitting
around  playing  Internet  games  with  his  friends.  The  stepson  ignored  Applicant,  but
continued chatting with his friends. Applicant unplugged the television set the boy was
watching. The stepson, a wrestler, jumped on Applicant and the two wrestled. This led
to the teen suffering an injury to his lip, which bled. Applicant’s wife broke up the fracas.
Applicant  ultimately  left  the  room,  at  which  point  the  teenager  called  the  police.
Applicant  was  eventually  arrested  and  charged  with  assault.  Two  hours  later,  he
returned home.  Considering this to be an internal, domestic issue between stepfather
and  teen,  Applicant  wanted  to  contain  or  avoid  the  problem,  and  pled  guilty  to  simple
assault  in  March  2017.  He  was  sentenced  to  45  days  in  confinement  (suspended  12
months),  12  months probation  (unsupervised),  $100 fine, and  required  to  complete  an
anger  management  class.2  He  also  completed  two  months  of  substance  abuse
counseling. (Tr. 48-50)
Applicant’s  effort,  however,  did  not  help  his  eroding  relationship  with  the  teen’s
mother. Applicant and his now-estranged wife separated a week or so later. Living apart
and bored from not working, Applicant began to drink more. Then, one night in February
2016, Applicant was bored, alone, and having alcoholic beverages by himself when his
spouse asked him to come over. Hopeful at this development, he prepared to go.
Despite  the  fact  he  had  been  imbibing  and  knew  he  “wasn’t  really  in  a  good
condition to drive,” Applicant got into his car. (Tr. 29) On his way, he was pulled over by
police on his way to see her. Applicant was charged with driving while impaired (DWI)
with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level measured at 0.17. He pled guilty to the
charge in March 2017.
Since  that  time,  Applicant  does  not  consider  alcohol  to  be  a  factor  in  his  life,
although he continues to consume alcohol. (Tr. 40) He completed counseling in March
2018, where it was recommended he attend a minimum of two Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA)  meetings  a  week  in  addition  to  group  counseling.  He  attended  “a  few”  meetings,
but “it’s difficult to find one that you actually like just because of the people that are in
there,  so  I  tried  a  couple  of different ones,  recorded  it,  and that  was  it.”  (Tr. 42)   He’s
replaced boredom in his life with enjoying the nature abundant in his current region and
in  getting  to  know  his  biological  family,  whom  he  discovered  a  year  ago  in  the  same
area  in  which  he  now  lives.  (Tr.  41) These finds  have  brought  joy  to  his  life  and  have
alleviated his boredom. Now, he generally only drinks while watching sports games on
television with his brother. He is mindful not to drive after imbibing.

Applicant is a 63-year-old research and development mechanic who has worked for
his defense-contractor employer since January 2003. He has held a secret clearance since
April 2003. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 33.)
Applicant  and  his  spouse  met  in  AA  in  1985  and  married  in  1987.  They  were
separated in 1994 but reconciled in 2004. They have been legally separated since April
2016 because of his drinking. They have a 29-year-old son who lives with Applicant and
has a ten-year-old son of his own. Applicant’s spouse has two grown daughters from a
previous relationship whom Applicant adopted and raised as his own children. (GE 1; Tr.
33-37.)
Applicant began consuming alcohol at age 14. From 1969 until he turned of legal
age to drink in 1973, he drank two beers or a half-bottle of wine monthly with friends. Over
the next decade, he drank 6 to 12 beers twice weekly. In 1984, he began drinking daily,
consuming six beers at a sitting in his home or at bars with friends. In 1985, Applicant
recognized that he was drinking too much. Following completion of an alcohol-rehabilitation
program, he attended AA meetings until 2001 or 2002. He eventually drifted away from AA,
but stayed abstinent from alcohol for some 20 years until 2005. (GE 10; AE A.) He started
drinking periodically on business trips with his co-workers. Before long, he was consuming
alcohol on weekends in quantity of two to three beers or shots of liquor with dinner. He
concealed his drinking from his spouse because  he knew she would disapprove of his
drinking. (GE 2.)
In  2006  or  2007,  Applicant  was  prescribed  a  narcotic  for  pain  from  a  local
orthopedist for a condition misdiagnosed as sciatica. Applicant has variously reported that,
after two to three months of taking his pain medication as prescribed, he began illegally
obtaining  and  using  narcotics  and  OxyContin.  He  reported  illegally  using  Vicodin  on  a
weekly basis for five to six months and OxyContin daily for four months, which he obtained
from friends and associates. (GE 10; AE A.) Medical records from 2009 indicate more
extensive  abuse  of  narcotics  and  opiates.  (GEs  3-4.)  Applicant  acknowledged  at  his
hearing that he abused prescription pain medications (Vicodin and OxyContin) from 2007
to  May  2009  (Tr.  48-49) and  that  he  also  used  heroin  a  few  times  when  he  could  not
illegally obtain OxyContin. (Tr. 51.) Most of the time, he obtained the prescription painkillers
from friends and did not have to pay for the drugs. However, he also testified that he spent
$5,000 to $6,000 for the drugs over the two years he abused them. (Tr. 56-57.)
Applicant  missed  a  couple  of  days  of  work  in  May  2009  because  of  his
polysubstance abuse. On May 18, 2009, Applicant’s spouse brought him to the emergency
department of a local hospital seeking help for his alcohol problem. His blood-alcohol level
tested at .285%. He told medical staff that he had resumed alcohol consumption about five
years ago; that his drinking had gotten out of control in the past few months; and that in the
last three weeks, he had consumed a pint of schnapps per day. He also admitted that he
had  been  abusing  opiates.  Medical  records  indicate  that  he  reported  abusing  opiates
(OxyContin, Fentanyl patches,1 and some heroin) for the past three years to self-medicate
for pain, with his most recent use being on the weekend preceding his presentation in the
emergency department. Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, opioid abuse,
and  alcohol  intoxication,  and  referred  to  a  hospital  specializing  in  mental  health  and
addictions treatment (hospital X) for alcohol-detoxification treatment. (GEs 3-4.)
Applicant  received  voluntary  alcohol-detoxification  and  opioid-detoxification
treatment at hospital X from May 19, 2009, to May 26, 2009. He reported to clinicians that
he began taking prescribed Percocet for pain about two years prior, and that when his
prescription ran out three weeks later, he began obtaining pain medications from friends
1 Applicant asserts that he used a Fentanyl patch only one time. (Tr. 51, 54.) He admitted that he used heroin
when he could not obtain OxyContin and used heroin twice in May 2009. (Tr. 51-52.) Applicant acknowledged
that he had a DOD clearance when he engaged in illegal drug use. (Tr. 55.)
and acquaintances. He reported illegally taking 60 mg. of OxyContin per day since then
with some increase to 80 mg. daily in the last year. Applicant stated that, at times, he used
“half a bundle of heroin per day.”2  He reported using heroin twice, and OxyContin and a
Fentanyl patch once during the May 15-17, 2009 time frame. He stated that he had also
been consuming 1.5 pints of vodka per day for the last two years. Applicant expressed
concern about the possible loss of his job if he continued to drink. Diagnoses on admission
were alcohol withdrawal, alcohol dependence, opioid withdrawal, and opioid dependence.
He appeared motivated to cease his alcohol and opioid abuse, and was safely detoxified
from both substances. He transitioned to the facility’s partial hospitalization program (PHP)
on Suboxone3 and Trazodone with a fair prognosis if he became engaged in outpatient
treatment. (GE 4.)
While at hospital X, Applicant began a therapeutic relationship with a psychiatrist.
She placed Applicant on Suboxone for his opiate abuse, and she had individual counseling
with Applicant weekly to twice weekly in 2009 and then monthly until August 2016, when
she terminated their relationship after finding out that he had been drinking alcohol while
taking  Suboxone.  Applicant  knew  he  was  required  to  abstain  from  alcohol  while  on
Suboxone. (GEs 1, 4, 10; Tr. 59.)
On January 6, 2015, Applicant went to his local emergency department complaining
of leg atrophy and weakness. He acknowledged that he was drinking approximately ten
shots of alcohol per day while taking prescribed Suboxone, but expressed no interest in
alcohol detoxification unless it would help his leg. He was diagnosed with alcohol abuse
and discharged in stable condition, but advised to decrease his alcohol intake. (GE 3.)
On June 11, 2015, Applicant presented at the emergency department with moderate
alcohol abuse. He reported that he had been binge drinking for the past week and wanted
alcohol-detoxification  treatment  at  hospital X.  He  was  discharged  from  the  emergency
department in stable condition. (GE 3.)
Applicant had alcohol-detoxification treatment at hospital X from June 11, 2015, to
June 15, 2015. On admission, he admitted he had been drinking four to nine “nips”4 on the
weekends with an increase over the past week to at least six or more drinks (“shots of
bourbon” and “nips”) per day to intoxication while taking Suboxone. Applicant reported
missing several days of work recently because of his alcohol use, although he had the
leave  to  cover  his  lost  time  and  was  not  reprimanded.  (Tr.  73.)  He  exhibited  some
2 Applicant testified that he was never addicted to heroin. He knew that heroin and OxyContin were both
opiates and he told clinicians that he was buying a bundle of heroin per day because it was a way for him to
get accepted into the Suboxone program. (Tr. 50.)
3 Suboxone is a combination of two narcotics, buprenorphine and naloxone, both partial opiate agonists. It was
approved for the treatment of opioid dependence by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002. According to
studies from the National Institute of Health, people addicted to prescription painkillers reduced their opioid
abuse  when  given  sustained  treatment  with  Suboxone,  which  reduces  withdrawal  symptoms.  See
www.nih.gov.
4 Applicant testified that he drank as many as ten shots per day. Applicant’s “nips” were the small bottles of
liquor containing 1.5 ounces. (Tr. 74-75.)
symptoms  of  alcohol  withdrawal,  including  tremors.  He  reported  that  he  was  actively
involved in AA “as a sponsor,” and he expressed a desire to attend AA meetings on his
discharge. He was discharged in stable condition to continue to take Suboxone and follow
up with his psychiatrist. Diagnoses at discharge included alcohol dependence, continuous,
and opioid dependence, in remission. (GE 4.)
In 2015, Applicant’s psychiatrist closed her private practice for a clinic affiliation.
Applicant began outpatient counseling with a therapist at the clinic in September 2015 for
his diagnosed opioid use disorder, severe, in sustained remission; depressive disorder;
and  alcohol  dependence.  Applicant  reported  abstinence  from  alcohol  and  some
improvement in his depression after being placed on mood stabilizers.  His psychiatrist
continued  to  prescribe  Suboxone  for  his  opioid  use  disorder  and  pain  relief,  and  she
prescribed Campral medication for alcohol cravings. In early January 2016, Applicant told
his psychiatrist that he had thought about drinking a few times, but that he had maintained
sobriety.  Applicant  was  advised  to  attend  AA.  Applicant  reported  during  counseling
sessions in late February 2016 and early May 2016 that he was still not drinking, although
he now acknowledges that he continued to drink alcohol on weekends and hide his alcohol
use from his psychiatrist. (Tr. 64.) His mood was noted as stable on Cymbalta, although he
was stressed about a new home purchase. During a session at the clinic in mid-June 2016,
Applicant reported that he had stopped taking Campral and that family stress had led him
to drink alcohol. He was advised to take Campral, engage in counseling, and attend AA.
His opioid dependence was in remission. (GE 7.)
On July 4, 2016, Applicant began drinking heavily due to chronic pain. Three days
later, Applicant was transported by ambulance to his local emergency room because of
alcohol intoxication. He smelled of alcohol and his speech was slurred. He chose to leave
the hospital against medical advice, and he was discharged to his wife’s custody. (GE 3.)
Applicant was unable to work because of his pain, and he went on short-term disability,
which lasted nine months. (GEs 3, 9; Tr. 47.)
On July 16, 2016, Applicant called his counselor at the outpatient clinic. He was
intoxicated and was told he needed a higher level of care than the clinic could provide. He
was discharged from his outpatient therapy at the clinic on July 20, 2016, but allowed to
remain in medication management with his psychiatrist as long as he sought a higher level
of care. Diagnoses at the time of his discharge from the clinic were opioid dependence, on
antagonist therapy, and alcohol abuse. (GE 7.)
On July 20, 2016, Applicant was transported by his daughter to his local hospital.
He  was  diagnosed  in  the  emergency  department  with  acute  alcohol  intoxication  and
alcoholism. He reported two weeks of heavy drinking and steady drinking of approximately
a liter of vodka per day for the past five days. Urine screens were negative for opiates, but
his blood-alcohol levels were critically high. He had withdrawal symptoms from alcohol,
including  anxiety  and  tremors.  Applicant  was  transferred  to  hospital  X  for  alcohol-
detoxification treatment on July 21, 2016. (GE 3; Tr. 75.)
Applicant  told  staff  at  hospital  X  that  he  had  been  consuming  two  pints  of
peppermint  schnapps  per  day  and  that  his  increased  drinking  was  precipitated  by  an
argument with his wife and their subsequent marital separation. Applicant was diagnosed
with alcohol use disorder, severe. Treatment was attempted with benzodiazepines for a
few hours, but he was tremulous, agitated, and hallucinating. He was transported back to
his local hospital for medical treatment of suspected delirium tremens. (GEs 3-4.)
On July 22, 2016, Applicant was readmitted to hospital X for alcohol-detoxification
treatment. Notes of an attending psychiatrist indicate that Applicant was involved in AA and
was  an  AA  sponsor.  He  was  successfully  detoxified  from  alcohol  using  the  hospital’s
standard protocol. At discharge on July 28, 2016, Applicant was prescribed Suboxone and
urged  to  maintain  sobriety.  Aftercare  plans  included  continuing  with  his  outpatient
counseling at the clinic and medication management with his psychiatrist. (GE 4.) Applicant
stayed sober for ten days only to again relapse into drinking alcohol. (GE 6.)
During a medication-management session with his psychiatrist on August 2, 2016,
Applicant  exhibited  moderate  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depression.  The  psychiatrist
assessed his progress in treatment as minimal, given he had relapsed with alcohol. She
advised  him  to  contact  hospital  X  as  soon  as  possible  about  its  intensive  outpatient
program (IOP). She noted his need for Suboxone to prevent withdrawal and relapse into
opioid dependence, recommended counseling for diagnosed major depressive disorder,
and ended her treatment with him. (GE 7.)
During  the  morning  of  September  6,  2016,  Applicant  was  brought  to  his  local
hospital by his son. Applicant was intoxicated at the time. He reported consuming ten or
more alcohol drinks per day and also feeling that his life was out of control. (Tr. 75.) He
attributed  his  relapse  to  being  discharged  from  his  Suboxone  protocol.  He  went  into
withdrawals that triggered his relapse. He was seen as ambivalent about his sobriety and
lacking insight into his situation. He was transferred to hospital X for alcohol-detoxification
treatment. (GEs 3, 6.)
Applicant was treated at hospital X from September 6, 2016, through September 12,
2016. He reported symptoms of helplessness. His treatment plan addressed symptoms of
anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. On September 13, 2016, he was transferred to
the hospital’s IOP consisting of clinical group therapy five days per week with the goal of
relapse prevention. On admission to the IOP, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder,
severe; unspecified anxiety disorder; and unspecified depressive disorder. While in the
IOP, Applicant was engaged in clinical group therapy, and he admitted that he had stopped
attending AA, which led to his relapse. He expressed a willingness to return to AA and a
desire to remain sober. Over the next few days, he reported no substance use, but he was
considered to be at risk for relapse. On September 15, 2016, Applicant was evaluated by a
physician  for medication  management.  Applicant  denied  any  suicidal ideation, and his
judgment and insight were assessed as fair. He met diagnostic criteria for severe alcohol
use disorder and severe opioid use disorder. The physician recommended that he continue
with the IOP and regular AA meetings. Applicant continued to attend his IOP group-therapy
sessions, showing receptivity to treatment interventions, but also some depression and
anxiety.  He  reported  attending  AA  meetings  and  contacting  his sponsor. He remained
concerned about being at home alone, which was a trigger for his abuse. As of September
29, 2016, he reported attending at least four AA meetings a week. (GE 6.) Despite his
involvement in AA, he was unable to stop drinking. (Tr. 64.)
On October 5, 2016, Applicant was transported by ambulance to his local hospital
for suicidal thoughts and alcohol intoxication. He had been drinking “as much as he could”
over the previous five to six days after his son was involved in a car accident. Applicant
was diagnosed with alcohol abuse and depression. Applicant initially denied he had been
drinking and was belligerent with staff. He was medically cleared for discharge to home
that evening with the recommendation that he continue in his IOP at hospital X. As soon as
Applicant arrived home, he drank alcohol. (GE 3.)
On October 6, 2016, Applicant went to his IOP and reported that he wanted to kill
himself.  He  went  to  his  local  hospital’s  emergency  department  for  a  mental-health
evaluation, which was not conducted at that time because he was not sober. (GE 3; Tr.
62.) Available medical records indicate that Applicant was then treated at hospital X until
October 10, 2016. (GE 6.)
Applicant  resumed  his  participation  in  his  IOP  on  October  11,  2016.  He  was
remorseful about his latest relapse and indicated that he was actively returning to AA. He
was motivated to stay sober but admitted that he struggled on the weekends when alone at
home.  Applicant  reported  significant  issues  with  irritability  and  depression  and  being
overwhelmed by health and financial concerns. (GE 6.)
After drinking heavily for three days, on October 18, 2016, Applicant went to his
local hospital requesting a placement for alcohol detoxification. He did not exhibit any signs
or symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal and was referred to his IOP. (GE 3.) At the
referral of his therapist, Applicant received alcohol-detoxification treatment at a different
hospital from October 19, 2016, to October 25, 2016. He admitted that he drank alcohol on
most Saturdays and exhibited blunted affect with depressed and anxious mood, but he
also appeared committed to sobriety. His judgment and insight were assessed as impaired.
Following  an  uncomplicated  inpatient  detoxification,  he  was  discharged  in  improved
condition with a primary diagnosis of alcohol use disorder with uncomplicated withdrawal;
depressive  disorder,  unspecified;  and  obsessive  compulsive  disorder  trait.  He  was
prescribed  an  anti-depressant,  advised  to  follow-up  in  his  IOP  program,  and  given  a
referral to an inpatient 28-day alcohol-rehabilitation program. (GE 9.)
Instead, Applicant resumed his participation in his IOP. He appeared frustrated by
his  recent  detoxification  stay  and  indicated  that  he  had  declined  the  referral  to  the
rehabilitation facility because of the cost. Applicant testified that he had no guarantee of a
bed. (Tr. 79.) In the IOP, Applicant struggled to accept responsibility for his sobriety. (GE
6.)
On October 31, 2016, Applicant was transported by the local fire department to his
local  hospital’s  emergency  department  for  a  mental  health  evaluation.  Applicant  was
diagnosed with alcohol intoxication, depression, and suicidal ideation. He possessed a gun
and expressed fear that he might kill himself.5 Applicant told medical personnel that he had
been drinking seven to nine alcohol drinks on a daily basis for the last five days. He had a
mental-health assessment on November 1, 2016, and was considered stable for discharge.
He was given a referral to a 28-day inpatient alcohol-rehabilitation program in a distant
state with treatment to be at no cost to him. (GE 3.)
Applicant declined the referral and resumed his participation in hospital X’s IOP on
November 3, 2016. He advised his therapist that he declined residential treatment because
it was too far away, he had bills to pay, and he had to care for his son. Applicant was
depressed, but he had no suicidal thoughts. He expressed an intention to attend an AA
meeting  daily  and  several  AA  meetings  on  the  weekends  to  offset  triggers.  He  was
persuaded to attend a PHP more tailored to substance abuse. (GE 6.)
Applicant reported to the PHP on November 4, 2016, as “clean and safe and sober.”
Similar to his IOP, his treatment plan included attending at least 20 support meetings per
week for treatment of alcohol use disorder, severe, to work on identifying triggers for his
substance  abuse  and  to  learn  coping  skills.  In  addition,  he  received  psychological
education and had psychiatrist appointments as needed with a focus on alcohol recovery,
and  depression  and  anxiety  management.  His  anxiety  was  high  at  times  because  of
external stressors, including a lack of funds. His short-term disability income was less than
his  regular  income,  and  he  was  not  able  to  work  because  of  chronic  knee  pain.  He
appeared motivated for sobriety and remained alcohol and drug-free. All toxicology screens
were negative. He attended AA daily and had a sponsor in AA and was receptive during his
group therapy sessions. Applicant was transferred back to the IOP on November 9, 2016.
On November 23, 2016, he was successfully discharged from the IOP with diagnoses of
alcohol use disorder, severe; unspecified anxiety disorder; and unspecified depressive
disorder (provisional). He reported no longer experiencing anxiety or depression. In the
opinion of his primary therapist, Applicant had demonstrated the ability to use several new
coping  skills.  His  therapist also noted that Applicant’s main source of sobriety was his
“strong connection” with AA. Applicant was discharged with a good prognosis to continue in
aftercare consisting of individual therapy and medications for his anxiety. (GE 5.)
Applicant had an intake session for counseling with an addiction-recovery service on
December  1,  2016,  Applicant  reported  a  history  of  abusing  alcohol  and  prescription
medications;  sobriety  for  20  years  with  the  help  of  AA  after  completing  an  inpatient
program at age 29; but then drinking on and off after going on a “road job” for his employer.
He attributed an increase in his drinking after he was cut off from Suboxone six months
ago. At its worst, he drank 13 to 15 nips every night, but he reported no drinking for the
past 36 days. He admitted that he had spent “thousands” on opiates in the past. He denied
significant  symptoms  of  depression  or  anxiety.  He  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use
disorder,  severe,  and  with  opioid  use  disorder,  severe,  in  early  remission.  Applicant
participated  in  two  individual  therapy  sessions  and  two  group  therapy  sessions  in
5 Applicant now maintains that it was a BB gun. (Tr. 62.) He believes his depression and suicidal ideation were
a product of his heavy drinking. (Tr. 65.) Applicant testified that when he was not working, “there was no
reason not to drink during the day.” (Tr. 76.)
December 2016. Available medical records from the provider reflect that his treatment was
expected to end in June 2017. (GE 8; Tr. 75.)  The last available progress note from the
facility is January 4, 2017. (GE 8.) Applicant testified that he completed the counseling in
June  2017  (Tr. 80),  but  he  also  told  a  clinical  psychologist  during  an  October 8,  2017
evaluation for the DOD that he stopped treatment because his insurance would no longer
pay for his sessions. (GE 2.)
On January 5, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant asserted that he abstained completely
from alcohol from 1985 until 2005, but from 2005 to March 2016, he drank two or three
beers or shots of liquor on the weekends. He hid his alcohol consumption from his wife,
whom he met in AA, and also from his treating psychiatrist because he knew that she
would discontinue his Suboxone medication if he was drinking. He stated that he drank two
to three nips of liquor three times a week after work from March 2016 to April 2016, when
his spouse left him because of his drinking. He then drank daily, although only one to two
nips per day until July 2016 when his drinking increased to six to eight shots of liquor on
the weekends. He claimed he stopped drinking in September 2016 because he started
attending AA, and he denied any intention to drink alcohol in the future. He acknowledged
that he had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent, but also stated that he did not consider
himself to be alcohol dependent. Applicant discussed his recent treatments for his alcohol
use. With regard to the concerns that he was suicidal in October 2016, Applicant denied
that he was suicidal and explained that he had been discouraged because he could not
stop drinking. He was in addictions counseling, and had been going to AA once or twice a
day  since  October  2016.  He  reported  an  intention  to  continue  with  his  addictions
counseling and with AA. (GE 10.)
Regarding his misuse of opiates, Applicant acknowledged that he had illegally used
Vicodin  and  OxyContin,  although  he  indicated that his abuse was limited to five or six
months  for  Vicodin  and  four  months  for  OxyContin  starting  in  2008.  After  receiving
detoxification treatment for five days for diagnosed addiction to opiates, Applicant was
prescribed Suboxone, which he took for the next eight years. Applicant acknowledged that
alcohol was contraindicated with Suboxone, and that after he tested positive for alcohol in
a urine screen in July 2016, his psychiatrist terminated the Suboxone. (GE 10.)
On January 12, 2017, Applicant met with the OPM investigator to provide further
information about his alcohol treatments. He explained that his therapist wanted him to
attend a long-term recovery program, but he chose to be treated at a more local hospital
for detoxification in October 2016. As for his previous claim that he had stopped drinking in
September 2016, he stated that his therapist told him that he had to drink in order to be
admitted, and so he consumed six nips before his admission for treatment in mid-October
2016. (GEs 9-10.)
Applicant remained abstinent from alcohol while attending about nine AA meetings a
week. He had surgery in January 2017, which proved effective in alleviating his chronic
pain. He took prescribed painkillers after his surgery with no misuse of prescription drugs.
(Tr. 47.) He returned to work from disability in April 2017 (AE A; Tr. 46), but mounting
10
financial issues,6 including federal and state tax delinquencies (Tr. 81), and problems with
his son led Applicant to feel depressed and overwhelmed. His son was abusing illegal
drugs  (including  crack  cocaine  and  heroin),  taking  his  money,  and  intimidating  him.
Applicant turned to alcohol to cope in June 2017. He consumed four to five nips of whiskey
the first day followed by daily drinking of as much as a pint of liquor. After three weeks of
heavy drinking, he called his spouse in early July 2017, and she took him to the hospital.
He was transferred to hospital X where he received inpatient treatment from July 7, 2017,
to July 14, 2017, for major depressive disorder, alcohol withdrawal, alcohol dependence,
and  suicidal  ideation.7  He  was  on  suicide  watch  briefly,  but  he  asserts  that  he  only
expressed suicidal ideation at his spouse’s suggestion to ensure that he would be admitted
for alcohol treatment. (GE 2; Tr. 81-83.) Applicant now believes that his depression and
suicidal ideation were a product of his heavy drinking. (Tr. 65.) Applicant was discharged to
the  hospital’s  IOP  where  he  attended  counseling  three  nights  per  week  for  about  five
weeks. (GE 2.)
During Applicant’s inpatient stay at hospital X, his counselor filed a report of elder
abuse about his son’s behavior. The state’s child protective services became involved
because Applicant’s son has physical custody of his ten-year-old child four days a week. It
motivated Applicant’s son to become involved in treatment himself. As of November 2018,
Applicant’s son was attending an IOP, reportedly no longer abusing drugs, and employed
at a donut shop. (Tr. 38-43.)
On  September  9,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire  for National Security Positions (SF 86). Applicant disclosed that he had
received mental-health treatment for an estimated eight months in 2008. In response to an
inquiry concerning whether he had ever been hospitalized for a mental-health condition,
Applicant reported that he had undergone voluntary treatment for five days in July 2016 for
alcohol  detoxification  and  for  seven  days  in  July  2017  for  alcohol  detoxification  and
depression at hospital X. He also responded affirmatively to whether he had misused any
prescription drug in the last seven years, but then disclosed that he misused OxyContin
and  Vicodin  from  January  2008  to  May  2008,  more  than  seven  years  ago.  Applicant
answered “Yes” to an inquiry concerning whether his use of alcohol has had a negative
impact on his work performance, professional or personal relationships, or finances in the
last seven years. He reported that his drinking between March 2015 and May 2015 led him
to miss work. He listed three alcohol-related treatments: his outpatient therapy at the clinic
in 2015 and voluntary alcohol treatments at hospital X in May 2015 and July 2017. (GE 1.)
At the request of the DOD, Applicant was evaluated on October 8, 2017, by a duly-
qualified licensed psychologist. Applicant indicated that he was again living with his son
and grandson, who was no longer using drugs and was employed. Applicant discussed
6 Applicant’s disability benefit ran out after six months (Tr. 47), and he began to rely on credit cards to pay bills.
He resolved most of his financial stress by a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge granted in October 2017. (AE A;
Tr. 89.)
7 The medical records from this admission were not presented in evidence. Applicant provided a copy of the
records to the psychologist, who evaluated him for the DOD in October 2017.
11
with the psychologist his misuse of opiates obtained from friends and associates in the
past to self-medicate for pain. He denied ever using heroin, although he indicated that he
voluntarily sought Suboxone treatment because he was concerned that his opiate use
would progress to heroin. He reported taking Suboxone for about six years before being
discharged for using alcohol. He denied any misuse of opiate pain medication since 2005.
Applicant reported experiencing depression and suicide ideation in the past, but only when
he was drinking alcohol and facing a number of stressors. He reported that he was taking
medications for depression and sleep prescribed during his recent hospitalization in July
2017, but also that he did not see any benefit to  the medications and planned to stop
taking them. Applicant denied any consumption of alcohol since July 6, 2017, and  any
desire to drink alcohol. He was attending seven AA meetings per week, working the steps
with his sponsor, and felt that AA had saved his life. Applicant expressed confidence that, if
he continued working with AA, he would be fine. (GE 2.)
The  clinical  psychologist  assessed  Applicant’s  optimism  about  his  sobriety  as
“somewhat excessive at this point considering his relapses despite being involved in AA in
the past and his relatively short period of sobriety.” He diagnosed Applicant with alcohol
use disorder, severe, in early remission, and with a history of adjustment disorder with
depressed  mood.  Symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depression  were  only  present  within  the
context of Applicant’s excessive alcohol use or in the face of significant life stressors. The
psychologist considered alcohol abuse a significant concern due to Applicant’s long period
of difficulties and his repeated relapses. He opined that Applicant’s alcohol use disorder,
severe, is a condition that would negatively impact his reliability, judgment, stability, and
trustworthiness.  He  noted  that  Applicant  had  an  appointment  to  restart  addictions
counseling, but that Applicant appeared ambivalent about restarting psychotherapy. While
Applicant appeared strongly invested in AA, the psychologist recommended that Applicant
also have treatment and monitoring by professionals, such as in outpatient psychotherapy.
The psychologist gave Applicant a guarded prognosis due to his brief period of sobriety
(since July 6, 2017), his repeated relapses in the past, and his lack of recent consistent
engagement in treatment. In Applicant’s favor, the psychologist cited his lengthy sobriety of
some 20 years in the past; his AA involvement with a supportive sponsor; his resolution of
a number of stressors by recently filing for bankruptcy and filing a complaint of elder abuse
against his son; and his recent outreach for help when needed. The psychologist did not
consider Applicant’s drug abuse to be a recent or current problem, given that drug screens
during recent hospitalizations have been consistently negative. (GE 2.)
Applicant stopped taking his prescribed anti-depressant and sleep medications a
couple  of  months  after  he  regained  his  sobriety  and  resumed  his  affiliation  with  AA
following his July 2017 treatment. He did not feel that he needed them. (Tr. 67.) He also
did not keep the appointment for addictions counseling. (Tr. 84.)
Applicant does not allow alcohol or illegal drugs in his home. (Tr. 64, 89.) He has not
consumed  any  alcohol  since  July  2017  (Tr.  71),  and  he  does  not  believe  that  he  will
relapse if his son relapses. (Tr. 78.) He denies ever reporting to work drunk or ever drinking
at work. (Tr. 74.) Available medical records show that he may have been hungover at work
in the past (GE 2), but he was never reprimanded. (Tr.73.)
Applicant describes himself as “a recovering—recovered alcoholic.” He attributes his
past substance abuse to an incorrect diagnosis of a physical condition which resulted in
chronic pain that undermined his attempts at sobriety. As of November 2018, Applicant
was still attending seven AA meetings a week. Applicant has been an AA sponsor for about
ten months as of November 2018. He sponsors four AA attendees in his home group. In
March 2018, he started a Saturday night “Big Book” meeting. He supports alcoholics in
local sober-house programs by driving several men to area AA meetings multiple times per
week.  Applicant  has  attended  two  weekend  retreats  and  is  involved  in  a  group  that
emphasizes the 12-step recovery program. He has worked all 12 steps of the AA program.
He has had his current sponsor since August or September 2017. His sponsor has 12
years of sobriety. (AE A; Tr. 85-99.)
Applicant  was  not  currently  in  any  formal  counseling  or  psychotherapy  as  of
November 2018. (Tr. 88.) He does not believe that he currently needs any psychotherapy
and  explained  that  it  never  worked  for  him.  (Tr.  93.)  When  asked  to  explain  why  he
believes AA is now sufficient to guarantee against relapse given his relapse history, which
includes  relapse  after  20  years  of  sobriety  with  AA  involvement  for  most  of  that  time,
Applicant  responded  that  he  was  working  the  steps,  sponsoring  people,  attending
meetings, and “doing the work that [he] wasn’t doing at the end of that last 20 years.” In the
past, he got caught up with work and did not think that he needed AA anymore. (Tr. 101-
102.)
Applicant’s AA sponsor provided a character reference letter attesting to Applicant’s
initial struggles in recovery from his alcohol problem. He agreed to become Applicant’s
sponsor without reservations because Applicant demonstrated to him willingness to change
his  life.  He  corroborates  that  Applicant  has  been  very  active  in  his  local  recovery
community  by  sponsoring  others  struggling  with  addiction  and  by  starting  a  Saturday
evening AA meeting attended by 30 to 40 people. In the sponsor’s opinion, Applicant has
“always been a person with integrity, honesty, and morals as a driving force in his life.” The
sponsor has “the highest respect” for Applicant. (AE B.)

"Applicant  is a 67-year-old, college-educated man with two adult children. He is
currently separated from his wife. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1971 to 1991, retiring
honorably. (Item 3 at 10) He has worked for a defense contractor as a senior logistics
analyst since 2014.
Applicant consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication, from
approximately 1966 until November 2016. (Item 2 at 1) Over the years, his alcohol abuse
has  led  to  multiple  alcohol-related  charges  and  arrests.  Specifically,  in  1978,  he  was
charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). (Item 2 at 1) The disposition of the charge is
unknown from the record. In 2001, he was arrested and charged with DWI and driving
under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (Item 2 at 1) The case was placed on the inactive
docket. After the arrest, Applicant voluntarily entered an alcohol and substance abuse clinic
where  he  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  abuse.  (Item  7  at  1-2)  In  2004,  Applicant  was
charged with attempting to drive a vehicle while impaired by alcohol. The case was nolle
prossed. (Item 2 at 1; Item 4 at 5) In September 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged
with DUI, DUI per se, and DWI. (Item 2 at 1) Applicant was found guilty of the DWI charge,
and  all  of  the  other  charges  were  nolle  prossed.  He  was  sentenced  to  60  days  in  jail
(suspended),  two  years  of  probation,  and  court  costs.  Also,  his  driver’s  license  was
restricted to use to and from work for one year. (Item 4 at 4)
In October 2012, Applicant’s attorney referred him to a 28-day inpatient counseling
program.  (Item  5  at  6)  At  or  about  that  time,  Applicant  began  attending  Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) meetings. Upon completion of the inpatient program, a substance abuse
counselor  diagnosed  him  with  alcohol  dependence.  (Item  6  at  122,  124)  Upon  his
discharge in November 2012, the substance abuse counselor noted that Applicant “does
not believe he has alcoholism despite the fact of significant negative consequences of his
use.” (Item 5) Per the discharge recommendations, Applicant was to abstain from alcohol,
attend outpatient counseling for relapse prevention, start Antabuse, a medication to control
the  urge  to  drink  alcohol,  and  continue  attending  AA.  (Item  2  at  1;  Item  5  at  7)  The
counselor concluded that Applicant’s long-term prognosis was good, so long as he accepts
that he can never safely use alcohol. (Item 5 at 9)
Applicant attended outpatient treatment from January 2013 to April 2013 on a twice
- weekly basis. Some time after the end of the treatment program, Applicant resumed his
alcohol consumption. As of November 2016, he was drinking two to three beers per week.
(Item 4 at 6) Also at that time, he was no longer attending AA meetings. (Item 4 at 6)

"Applicant  is  36  years  old.    He  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a
Protective  Security  Officer.    He  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security  clearance  in  connection
with  his employment.   Applicant  began  working  for his current employer in  September
2015.
Guideline G – Alcohol Consumption
The  Government  alleges  that  the  Applicant  has  engaged  in  excessive  alcohol
consumption, which often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure
to  control  impulses,  and  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.
(Government Exhibit 4.)  He has a history of alcohol abuse that began in about 2001 at
the age of 20, when he joined the Army.  His alcohol abuse has continued over the past
fourteen years, until at least 2017.  He has been arrested for Driving While Intoxicated
(DWI)  on  three  occasions.    In  2001,  Applicant  was  arrested  in  North  Carolina  and
charged  with  Driving  While  Intoxicated.    Applicant  was  stopped  at  a  DWI  check  point
and found to be intoxicated with a blood alcohol content of .18%.  (Government Exhibit
6.)  The charges were eventually dropped due to the fact that Applicant was serving in
the military and had moved out of the state.  Applicant was arrested in January 2008 in
Washington  D.C.,  and  was  charged  with  Driving  While  Intoxicated  and  Speeding.
Applicant  was  pulled  over  while  driving  for  going  80  mph  in  a  35  mph  zone.    Prior  to
driving,  Applicant  has  been  drinking  at  a  bar.    Applicant  was  also  found  to  be
intoxicated. In July 2008, he was convicted of Driving While Intoxicated and placed on
one years of supervised probation.  In 2009, while still on probation for his 2008 offense,
Applicant  was  arrested  in  Virginia  and  charged  with  Driving  While  Intoxicated  2nd
Offense  within  five  years.    Applicant  was  pulled  over  on  his  way  home  from  a  party
because  he  was  driving  90  mph.    He  refused  a  breathalyzer  and  was  arrested  and
charged  with  Driving  Under  the  Influence  (DUI),  Reckless  Driving,  and  Refusal.
Applicant was convicted of DUI and Reckless Driving.  He was sentenced to 180 days
in  jail  with  160  days  suspended.    About  this  same  time,  he  was  also  charged  in
Maryland  with  Violation  of  Probation  from  his  2008  DWI  case  and  required  to  service
approximately 20 days in jail in Maryland.  (Government Exhibits 8 and 10.)
Since 2009, Applicant has worked as a Security Guard.   In 2015, Applicant was
terminated from his employment as a Security Guard for misconduct – being under the
influence of alcohol at work.  (Government Exhibit 9.)  Applicant admits that he blacked
out  and  was  delusional  on  the  day  in  question,  although  he  attributes  his  condition  to
high blood sugar.  Applicant was reported to his supervisor that Applicant was drunk at
work.  The following day, Applicant returned to work and was asked to resign.  Applicant
refused  to  resign  because  he  claims  that  the  allegations  against  him  were  false.
Instead,  he  sought  representation  by  a  union  representative.    (Government  Exhibit  4.)
At the conclusion of the investigation, Applicant was terminated.
Guideline E – Personal Conduct
The  Government  alleges  that  the  Applicant  has  engaged  in  conduct  involving
questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules
and regulations which can raise questions about his reliability and trustworthiness.
Applicant  completed  an  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing
(e-QIP),  dated  May  10,  2016.    (Government  Exhibit  5.)    Section  22,  regarding  police
records, asked him if he had ever been convicted in any court of the United States of a
crime,  sentenced  to  imprisonment  for  a  term  exceeding  1  year  for  that  crime,  and
incarcerated  as a  result  of  that  sentence for not  less  than 1  year?   Had  he  ever been
charged with any felony offense?  Had he ever been convicted of an offense involving
domestic  violence  or  a  crime  of  violence  against  your  child  dependent,  cohabitant,
spouse, former spouse, or someone with whom he shares a child in common?  Had he
ever been charged with an offense involving firearms or explosives?  Had he ever been
charged  with  an  offense  involving  alcohol  or  drugs?    Applicant  answered,  “NO”.    This
was  a  false  answer.  Applicant  failed  to  Iist  any  of  his  arrests  set  forth  in  the  SOR
subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d., discussed above.
Section  13A  of  the  same  application,  regarding  employment  activities,  asked
about  his  reason  for  leaving  prior  employment.    (Government  Exhibit  5.)    Applicant
wrote  that  he  was  terminated:  accused  of  being  inattentive  on  post.    This  was  also  a
false  answer.    Applicant  failed  to  list  that  he  was  terminated  for  being  under  the
influence  of  alcohol at  work.    In  addition,  the  arrests  discussed  above  also  show  poor
personal conduct, poor judgment, and unreliability.
Applicant states that he failed to disclose his alcohol-related arrests in his 2016
E-QIP because  he misread the  relevant  question  and thought  he  was  only  required  to
disclose incidents that occurred within seven years of the date of this e-QIP submission.
(Government  Exhibit  4.)    With  regard  to  his  employment  termination,  Applicant  states
that  he  thought  the  termination  letter  that  he  signed  indicated  that  he  was  being
terminated for being in attentive on duty.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  This argument holds
no merit.  First, Applicant does not provide any documentation in support  of this claim.
Second, Applicant was well aware of his alleged intoxication at work by the fact that he
challenged  the  claim  against  him  and  forced  an  investigation  into  the  matter.    His
argument is not credible.  Applicant clearly falsified information on his security clearance
application in May 2016, by failing to disclose any of his alcohol-related arrests and by
providing a false reason for his employment termination in 2015.

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 37 years old. As of his 2015
security clearance application (SCA), he had never been married and he did not have
any children.1
Applicant obtained his general education diploma in 2001. He attended college in
2006, 2012 to 2015, and re-enrolled as of his 2018 response to the SOR, but he had not
yet earned a degree. He served honorably in the U.S. military from 2001 to 2009, during
which  time  he  deployed  to  the  Middle  East,  Central  and  North  America,  and  Iraq.  He
received  numerous  medals  for  his  military  service.  He  previously  worked  overseas  for
two U.S. defense contractors from 2010 to 2013, and he was unemployed from 2013 to
2015.  He  has  worked  as  an  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor  since  2015,  and  he
received  a  promotion  and  recognition  awards  between  2016  and  2018.  He  was  first
granted a security clearance in 2003.2
Applicant  has  consumed  alcohol,  at  times  in  excess  and  to  the  point  of
intoxication,  since  age  16.  He  drank  two  to  three  beers  once  to  twice  yearly  until  July
2002,  when  he  turned  21  years  old.  He  acknowledged  that  his  heavy  alcohol  abuse
started during his military service. He then drank four to five beers or hard liquor drinks
on the weekends at social gatherings. Before his April 2016 driving under the influence
(DUI)  conviction,  further  discussed  below,  he  drank  between  five  and  fifteen  beers  on
the  weekends.  He  described  his  drinking  habits  during  his  2017  background  interview
as moderate, stating that he drank occasionally. In January 2017, he drank three beers
and three glasses of champagne. In February 2017, he drank two beers with dinner. In
June  2017,  he  drank  two  beers.  As  of  his  2018  response  to  interrogatories,  he  last
drank three glasses of champagne in December 2017.3
In April 2000, Applicant was charged and convicted of DUI. He was 18 years old.
He was at a friend’s sister’s house and he drank two to three beers. He did not believe
he was intoxicated and he drove his friend home. He was pulled over by a police officer
and  administered  a  breathalyzer.  Though  his  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  was  .04%,
the officer arrested him because he was a minor. He was fined and his driver’s license
was suspended for one year.4

In September 2013, Applicant was charged and convicted of DUI. He had been
watching football at his cousin’s house, where he drank six to seven beers. He did not
believe he was intoxicated, attempted to drive home, and got into an accident. He was
arrested, administered a breathalyzer, and his BAC was .16%. He was fined, ordered to
take  a  drug  and  alcohol  awareness  course,  and  his  driver’s  license  was  revoked  for
three  months.  He  complied  with  the  court’s  sentence  and  his  driver’s  license  was
reinstated in February 2014. Applicant stated during his 2015 background interview that
he had no future intentions of drinking and driving.5
In  April  2016,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI.  He  was  with  friends  watching  a
hockey game at a sports bar. He drove to the bar but planned to take an Uber home.
He drank seven to eight beers and three to four shots of hard liquor over three hours.
He drove to a friend’s house nearby, with the intention of sleeping off the alcohol before
driving home later. En route, he realized he was too drunk to drive so he pulled into a
residential  neighborhood  to  sleep.  He  was  arrested  after  a  resident  reported  an
unknown  parked  car  in  the  neighborhood,  and  the  officer  smelled  alcohol  on  him.  He
was  sentenced  to  one  year  of  supervised  probation,  one  year  of  a  suspended  driver’s
license, fined, 50 hours of community service, and DUI and victims awareness courses.
He was also ordered to attended counseling and treatment.6
Applicant  attended  an  outpatient  program  consisting  of  24  group  counseling
sessions, two individual sessions, and 12+ Alcoholics  Anonymous (AA) meetings from
May  to  August  2017,  when  he  completed  the  program.  A  discharge  summary  record
reflects:
[Applicant]  accepted  the  consequences  of  his  alcohol  use  and  understands  the
risks  of  continued  use  of  any  mood  altering  substance  .  .  .  He  appears  sincere
about remaining substance fee.7
His discharge diagnosis reflects an Axis I diagnosis of “Alcohol Abuse (In Remission) –
F10.10,” states that his prognosis is “Good, if [Applicant] follows recommendations,” and
recommends  that  Applicant  abstain  from  all  mood  altering  drugs  and  continue  AA
attendance.8
In  his  October  2017  background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not
believe  he  had  an  alcohol  dependence  issue,  but  he  considered  himself  an  alcoholic
based on information he obtained from the counseling sessions. Though he stated that
he does so only rarely, he acknowledged in both his 2017 background interview and his
2018 response to the SOR that he still consumed alcohol. He decided to decrease his

alcohol  consumption  because  he  learned  from  the  counseling  sessions  that  alcohol
could negatively impact him. He sold both of his vehicles and decided to bicycle or Uber
wherever he goes. He stated that he previously drank alcohol to feel happy and relieve
work stress, but realized that he could exercise and listen to music instead. He did not
provide  evidence  of  continued  AA  attendance.  He  stated  that  his  DUIs  are  common
knowledge among his family and friends.9

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 27 years old. He obtained a
high-school diploma in 2009, and he attended some college from 2011 to 2012 but did
not earn a degree. He has worked as a material handler for a defense contractor since
August 2016. He previously worked for another defense contractor from March 2015 to
August  2016.  He  has  never  held  a  DOD  security  clearance.  As  of  his  August  2016
security clearance application (SCA), he had never been married and did not have any
children.1
Applicant  has  consumed  alcohol,  at  times  in  excess  and  to  the  point  of
intoxication,  since  after  he  graduated  from  high  school.  When  he  was  underage,  he
typically drank two to four beers once to twice monthly at house parties. Between ages
21  to  24,  he  drank  around  two  to  eight  beers  almost  nightly  while  socializing  with
friends. From ages 24 to 26, he decreased his alcohol consumption because he tried to
become more responsible. He did not like the person he had become after receiving his
second driving under the influence (DUI) charge in March 2015, as discussed below. He
no  longer  enjoyed  feeling  hung  over.  As  of  his  2017  background  interview,  he
consumed five to six beers on the weekends while socializing with friends.2
In March 2012, at age 20, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was
at  a  party  with  a  friend  and  he  drank  five  to  six  beers.  He  thought  he  was  in  good
condition to drive, but he wrecked his car in a ditch on his way home. He failed a field
sobriety test. He pled guilty and was sentenced to probation and fined. He was ordered
to  participate  in  an  alcohol  assessment,  attend  a  victim  impact  panel,  and  enroll  in  an
alcohol  and  drug  substance  abuse  course.  He  completed  the  alcohol  classes  in
September 2012, and he was on probation from around August 2012 to June 2013. A
court  record  corroborates  Applicant’s  indication  in  his  SCA  and  background  interview
that this DUI was dismissed in around January 2013.3
In  February  2015,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  employment  due  to  multiple
late arrivals and absences. He indicated in his background interview that he likely had a
week’s worth of late arrivals and three to four absences in the last several months of his

employment. He was late and absent because he partied and drank with friends at bars,
was hungover, tired, and did not feel like working.4
In March 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and speeding. He
was  at  a  restaurant  with  a  friend.  Over  the  course  of  six  to  seven  hours,  he  drank  at
least 12 beers. As he was driving, he was stopped by a police officer for speeding. He
failed  a  field  sobriety  test.  The  speeding  charge  was  dismissed.  He  pled  guilty  to  DUI
and  was  sentenced  to  jail  for  one  year,  suspended;  probation  for  one  year;  license
suspension; and fined. He was again ordered to participate in an alcohol assessment,
attend a victim impact panel, and enroll in an alcohol and drug substance abuse course.
He was also ordered to complete 80 hours of community service. He was on probation
from September 2015 to June 2016, and he completed the court’s requirements.5
In November 2015, Applicant received a written warning from his employer. The
warning was for his failure to call or show for work. The previous evening, he was out
drinking and watching football with a friend. He overslept.6
In September 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication
and resisting an officer. He and a friend were celebrating a holiday weekend at a bar,
and  he  drank  eight  to  nine  beers  and  two  shots  of  hard  liquor.  He  walked  back  to  his
apartment,  which  was  around  one  mile  from  the  bar,  when  he  was  arrested  in  his
apartment  complex  parking  lot.  He  was  difficult  with  the  arresting  officer  because  he
was drunk and upset. He pled no contest and was fined.7
In  his  2017  background  interview,  Applicant  indicated  that  such  alcohol-related
incidents were unlikely to recur because he was a changed person. He indicated that he
stopped drinking during the week and on Sundays because it interfered with work and
he did not like the person he was. He indicated that his family and friends are aware of
his  alcohol-related  incidents.  He  also  indicated  that  he has  never  received  an  alcohol-
related diagnosis.8

"In  her  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  comments  all  of  the  factual
allegations in the SOR pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.). She
failed  to  address  the  factual  allegations  pertaining  to  the  criminal  conduct  issues.
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving
as a systems administrator with her current employer since January 2016. A 2009 high
school  graduate,  Applicant  earned  a  number  of  college  credits,  but  no  degree.  She
enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in September 2009, and served on active duty
until September 2013, when she was honorably discharged. She completed her military
service  commitment  in  the  Individual  Ready  Reserve  (IRR)  in  August  2017.  She  was
granted a secret clearance in November 2010. Applicant was married in December 2013,
and separated in May 2016. She has two sons, born in October 2012, and sometime in
2018.
Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct
Applicant is an alcohol abuser whose consumption of alcohol  has led to at least
three incidents over a five-year period that resulted in actions taken by police and court
authorities:
•In  November  2011,  when  she  was  on  active  duty,  after  being  out  drinking  an
unspecified quantity of beer at a bar with friends, Applicant drove onto her military facility
while  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  and  emitting  the  odor  of  alcohol,  and  she  was
apprehended at the gate by the military police. She was administered a breathalyzer and
field-sobriety test. In December 2011, the traffic court on base assessed her 10 points to
her driving record on base, and she was ordered to attend a one-day alcohol education
program. She was eventually administratively counseled by her command with a write-up
under what is called a page 11 entry, declared ineligible for promotion for three months,
and issued a reprimand.1
•In March 2012, when she was on active duty, after being out drinking one shot of
liquor, a mixed drink, and up to two beers at a bar with her sister, she decided to return
to the military facility by taxi. While riding in the taxi, she passed out. The gate guards
could not awaken her, so she was transported to the base hospital. She was subsequently
ordered to undergo an alcohol screening. Based on the alcohol screening, Applicant was
advised  to  participate  in  outpatient  treatment,  but  because  she  was  pregnant,  she
requested inpatient treatment. She was in the hospital treatment program from March 27,
2012, until April 24, 2012, during which she participated in group counseling, was given
a  smokers  patch,  and  administered  Melatonin  to  treat  insomnia.  No  diagnosis  was
reported. She purportedly successfully completed the program “by mutual decision,” and
was discharged. The U.S. Navy medical office guided her through an outpatient follow-
up from May 2012 until August 2012, during which she participated in individual therapy
and individual therapy. There was no diagnosis. She purportedly successfully completed
that program “by mutual decision,” and was discharged.2
•On July 2, 2016, at about 1 a.m., after being out drinking two beers and what she
described as a “trashcan”3 at a café with a friend, blaming the anniversary of her father’s
passing and the absence of her husband for her frame of mind,  Applicant drove to her
residence. On the way there, Applicant’s vehicle struck a tow truck stopped at a traffic
signal in a traffic lane, sideswiping it coming from the opposite direction. As a result of the
impact,  a  trail  of  debris,  including  the  front  left  tire,  most  of  the  front  bumper,  and  the
license plate were left behind. Applicant drove away without exchanging any information
with the tow truck driver. He followed her at a fast rate of speed and called the police. The
police arrived just as Applicant and her companion were attempting to enter her house.
Her  damaged  vehicle was  out front.  Applicant  was  questioned and  acknowledged  that
she had been drinking, and that she fled because she was scared. There was a strong
odor of alcohol coming from her breath and person. She was administered field sobriety

Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5. It should be noted that although the medical records were
requested  from  the  hospital,  and  Applicant  authorized  the  release  of  those  records,  there  are  no  such
medical or treatment records in the case file, and the specifics of the treatment remain unreported.

tests  and  arrested  for  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  She  was  later
administered  an  intoxilizer  test.  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  while  intoxicated
(DWI),  first  offense,  with  a  blood  alcohol  reading  of  between  .15  and  .20  percent,  a
misdemeanor;  and  failing  to  stop  at  an  accident,  a  misdemeanor.  On  September  15,
2016, she was found guilty of the DWI, and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, 85 days of
which were suspended, ordered to attend an area alcohol safety program (ASAP), placed
on unsupervised probation for three years, fined, her operator’s license was restricted,
and an ignition interlock restriction was required. The remaining charge was dismissed
nolle prosequi.4
Applicant  claimed  that  she  enrolled  in  the  ASAP  and  attended  weekly  group
therapy meetings for 16 weeks, as well as a 4-week program, not otherwise described,
ending  in  March  2017.  She  also  contends  that  she  voluntarily  attends  Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) meetings when she feels the need to do so.5
In January 2014, Applicant acknowledged to an investigator from the U.S. Office
of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  that  she  began  consuming  alcohol  when  she  was
approximately  18  years  of  age  while  attending  high  school  parties.  There  were  times
when she would drink two to three beers on three or four occasions per week, and periods
when she did not drink at all. Describing intoxication as being “fuzzy headed” and slurring
words, she acknowledged becoming intoxicated after consuming seven or eight beers,
something  she  did  weekly  on  average.  She  also  acknowledged  that  she  has  become
intoxicated  after only  three  beers. Applicant drinks  sometimes  to  deal with  stress,  and
sometimes just to be social.6 In August 2017, she claimed to another OPM investigator
that she had no future intent to consume alcohol nor would she ever operate a vehicle
while intoxicated. She denied that her drinking and driving incidents constituted a pattern,
and contended that her 2016 incident was an “isolated” incident.7 In her Answer to the
SOR, Applicant claims that she has attempted to turn her life around by avoiding being in
situations where alcohol is involved, by changing the friends with whom she associates,
and  by  no  longer  drinking.8  In  her  Response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  reiterated  her
position regarding alcohol.
",False
"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e. He admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d in
part and denied them in part.3 His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years old. He is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and F-16 pilot who
is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.  He  and  his  wife  have  been  married  since  1995.
They have three children, ages 22, 21, and 10. Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in
1993  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2005.  He  served  in  the  Air  Force  from  1993  to  2016,
retiring  as  a  lieutenant  colonel.  Rated  as  a  “command  pilot,”  he  had  over  2,500  flying
hours and more than 300 hours flying over combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. He
has  worked  for  his  employer  in  the  defense  industry  since  May  2016,  as  the  deputy
director of one of the company’s divisions. He has held a security clearance for 26 years
1 When he answered the SOR, Applicant did not formally “admit” or “deny” the allegations. I noted this in
an  e-mail  to  counsel  before  the  hearing,  and  Applicant  addressed  each  allegation  during  hearing
preliminaries. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I; Tr. 10-14)
2 Post-Hearing e-mail correspondence between myself and the parties is marked as HE IV. On December
21, 2019, when he provided Applicant’s post-hearing submissions, counsel requested “an indefinite delay
in  your  ruling  in  order  to  provide  ongoing  updates”  from  Applicant’s  counselor.  I  declined  to  hold  the
record open indefinitely for submission of evidence on an ongoing basis. DOD Directive 5220.6 ¶ E.3.1.10
states  that  “[t]he  Administrative  Judge  .  .  .  shall  conduct  all  proceedings  in  a  fair,  timely,  and  orderly
manner.”  (Emphasis  added)  Additionally,  ¶  E3.1.25  states  that  “The  Administrative  Judge  shall  make  a
written  clearance  decision  in  a  timely  manner  .  .  .”  An  applicant  is  not  entitled  to  a  delayed  or  deferred
adjudication of his or her security eligibility. ISCR Case No. 10-07892 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 7, 2011); ISCR
Case No. 09-02926 at 2 (App. Bd. May 11, 2010).
3  Applicant’s  partial  denials  as  to  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.d  largely  concerned  the  fact  that  the  allegations
misidentified the facility where he was treated and diagnosed. He otherwise admitted the substance of the
allegations. (Tr. 12-13, 28-29)
since he was commissioned as an Air Force officer. (Tr. 16, 53, 122-123, 159-162; Ans.
Encl. 11; SCA; AE G)
Applicant discussed his historical drinking pattern in his background interview. He
was  a  social  and  weekend  drinker  in  college.  He  drank  alcohol  sporadically  in  the  Air
Force until about 2012, when his drinking increased significantly after his wife  became
seriously ill. Applicant dealt with the resulting stress by  drinking frequently as a coping
mechanism.  He  said  in  his  background  interview  that during  this period, he  consumed
four  to  six  glasses  of  beer  or  wine  on  a  daily  basis.  (Tr.  165;  GE  2  at  12)  At  hearing,
Applicant  testified  that  his  drinking  became  “unhealthy”  sometime  in  early  2015,  and
that he was drinking habitually, four or five times a week at the time. (Tr. 145-147) He
said  no  one  came  to  him  at  the  time  and  said  he  was  drinking  too  much,  nor  did  he
realize that himself. (Tr. 190-191)
In  June  2015,  Applicant  was  stationed  at  a  military  base  near  where  he  now
lives,  in  State  1.  He  went  to  another  state,  State  2,  to  attend  a  conference.  The  night
before  he  was  to  return,  he  consumed  eight  to  ten  alcoholic  drinks  over  a  five-hour
period, alone in his hotel room. He had been working out beforehand, and had nothing
else to eat or drink. (Tr. 162-164; GE 2 at 11)
Applicant went to sleep after midnight. He woke at about 3:30 am and drove to
the  airport for  his  return  flight. While  en  route,  he  became  disoriented  and  entered  an
interstate  highway  by  driving  the  wrong  way  down  the  exit  ramp.  He  was  stopped  by
police after he was seen driving eastbound in a westbound lane. (Tr. 123-125, 163-164;
GE 2 at 11; GE 7 at 1)
Applicant  was  administered  a  breathalyzer  test  at  the  scene  and  registered  a
blood alcohol content (BAC) of .225. Results of a blood test later showed a BAC of .28.
He  was  arrested  and  initially  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI)  and
reckless driving under State 2 law. (SOR ¶ 1.a) (Tr. 125; GE 7 at 1; GE 2 at 7, 11)
Applicant  immediately  disclosed  his  arrest  to  his  command.  Upon  returning,  he
was referred to the Air Force Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Treatment (ADAPT)
program  and  diagnosed  in  early  July  2015  with  a  severe  alcohol  use  disorder  after
meeting 8 of the 11 criteria for alcohol use disorder under the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). (Tr. 126, 131, 144, GE 4 at 1)
Applicant  then  entered  recommended  inpatient  treatment  at  the  Substance
Abuse Rehabilitation Program (SARP) at a local Navy hospital. (SOR ¶ 1.b)4 While his
attendance was voluntary, he was also told that if he chose not to enter inpatient alcohol
treatment,  the  Air  Force  would  begin  administrative  separation  proceedings.  While  he
4  SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use  disorder,  severe,  while  in  inpatient
treatment  at  the  Navy’s  SARP  program,  when  in  fact,  the  initial  diagnosis  was  made  during  his  initial
alcohol evaluation by Air Force ADAPT providers. (Tr. 131; GE 4 at 2). While there is no documentation of
SARP’s diagnosis, Applicant testified that SARP accepted the diagnosis he received from the Air Force,
“and just put me into treatment.” (Tr. 150)
initially  preferred  outpatient  treatment,  he  also  recognized  that  he  had  a  problem  with
alcohol,  so  he  was  “easily  convinced  and  ready  to  get  help.”  (Tr.  126-127,  130,  135,
149-150, 166; GE 1 at 38, 46).
Applicant  was  in  inpatient  treatment  at  SARP  for  30  days  in  July  and  August
2015. He was considered “an active and motivated member of treatment groups,” and
he successfully completed inpatient treatment in August 2015. (Tr. 131, 151, GE 4 at 2;
GE 5; Ans. Encl. 3)
Applicant’s  continuing  care  and  aftercare  plan  developed  by  ADAPT  in  August
2015, which he acknowledged by signature, detailed certain requirements over the next
12 months. They included: 1) abstinence from alcohol; 2) participation in at least one to
three  self-help  group  meetings  per  week  (Alcoholics  Anonymous,  or  “AA”);  3)  weekly
follow-up  counseling  with  his  ADAPT  counselor;  and  4)  participation  in  a  formalized
continuing care group on a weekly basis for the next 12 months. (Tr. 131-132, 151-153;
GE 5 at 2-3)
Applicant testified at hearing that his abstinence “was unrelated to the treatment”
he  received  at  SARP,  but  was  instead  “related  to  me  wanting  to  fly  again.”  (Tr.  151;
Ans.  Enc.  3)  The  documentary  record  says  otherwise,  however,  as  abstinence  from
alcohol is the first requirement listed in the ADAPT program. (GE 5 at 2)
After  inpatient  treatment,  Applicant  transitioned  to  the  ADAPT  continuing-care
abstinence group, where he continued treatment on a bi-monthly basis. He met with a
counselor  to  discuss  treatment  goals  (maintaining  abstinence  from  alcohol,  improving
stress  management  skills  and  improving  his  marriage).  He  attended  meetings  with  a
local alcohol-abstinence support group, what he called “AA for aviators,” became more
engaged  at  church,  and  began  marital  counseling.  (Tr.  131-133,  167-169;  GE  4  at  2;
Ans. Encl. 3)
In  September  2015,  Applicant  received  a
from  his
commanding  officer  as  a  result  of  his  arrest.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  The  letter  noted  that,  in
addition to the civilian  charges of DUI and reckless driving, he  was also in  violation of
Article  111  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ)  for  drunken  operation  of  a
vehicle. (GE 7 at 1) A determination was made to adjudicate Applicant’s DUI in State 2
criminal  court,  so  Applicant  was  not  formally  charged  by  military  authorities.  (Tr.  126-
128; GE 2 at 7)
letter  of  reprimand
In  October  2015,  after  two  months  in  continuing  care,  Applicant  transitioned  to
the  aftercare  phase  of  the  ADAPT  program.  (SOR  ¶  1.d)5  During  this  phase,  he  met
monthly  with  his  ADAPT  program  manager,  an  Air  Force  captain  in  the  Biomedical
Service  Corps  (BSC). He  also  continued  attending  other support groups,  including  the
5  SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  received  aftercare  treatment  with  ADAPT  at  the  Navy  hospital  from
August  to  October  2015,  and  was  again  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use  disorder,  severe.  In  fact,  Applicant
began  the  Aftercare  program  in  October  2015,  after  two  months  in  the  “continuing  care  abstinence
group,” and the program was run by the Air Force, not the Navy.  Applicant said he did not recall a “new
diagnosis” at that stage. (Tr. 152)
“AA for aviators”  program.  He  abstained from  alcohol throughout the  program,  verified
by lab tests. (Tr. 131-133, 154, 167-169; GE 4 at 2; GE 6; GE 7 at 3-6; Ans. Encl. 3)
In  February  2016,  Applicant  requested  an  updated  alcohol  evaluation  from
ADAPT  in  order  to  maintain  his  flight  status.  His  DSM-V  diagnosis  at  that  time  was
alcohol  use  disorder,  severe,  in  early  remission,  because  he  had  no  demonstrated
symptoms for “longer than three months but less than one year.” (GE 4 at 3-4)
The  ADAPT  providers  noted  that,  given  the  “beneficial  and  socially  supportive
nature” of Applicant’s participation in marital therapy and the “AA for aviators” group,
it is recommended that he continue to engage in these therapeutic outlets
in the future (i.e., post-ADAPT treatment), in order to continue his upward
prognostic  trajectory  and  best  assist  him  in  the  maintenance  of  his
abstinence as well as the continued remission of his condition.6
Given  this  evidence,  and  given  Applicant’s  stated  desire  to  maintain  a  sober
lifestyle and to continue progressing towards recovery, his  prognosis was regarded as
excellent. It was estimated that in the absence of relapse, his condition would eventually
meet  the  criteria  for  alcohol  use  disorder,  severe,  in  sustained  remission  if  he
demonstrated no symptoms for over a year. (GE 4 at 4)
Applicant  was  allowed  to  maintain  his  flight  status.  (Tr.  132-133,  161,  170)  He
was  subject  to a  retirement  grade  determination but  was  allowed  to  retire from  the  Air
Force as a lieutenant colonel in early May 2016.7 (GE 2 at 7; Ans. Encl. 5; AE A – AE C)
Applicant did not complete the Air Force’s ADAPT aftercare program because he
retired  from  the  Air  Force.  (Tr.  137,  181)  The  record  does  not  indicate  that  Applicant
pursued a civilian alternative to the ADAPT program once he retired.
Applicant’s DUI case in State 2 remained pending until February 2017, when he
pleaded guilty to one count of DUI, extreme BAC, .15 – .19. The remaining charges, a)
DUI; b) DUI – liquor BAC .08 or more; c) DUI extreme BAC .20 or more; and d) reckless
driving) were dismissed. (GE 3; GE 1 at 40-41) Applicant was sentenced to 12 months
of unsupervised probation, which he completed. He was ordered to pay about $3,000 in
fines, fees, and costs, which he did in October 2017. He had an ignition interlock device
installed on his car from May 2017 to May 2018, and had no violations. He attended a
Mothers  Against  Drunk  Driving  panel.  He  was  not  under  any  pre-trial  restrictions  from
State  2  authorities  before  he  pleaded  guilty,  and  was  not  required  to  abstain  from
alcohol while on probation. (Tr. 128-129, 155-158, 171-175; GE 1 at 41-42; GE 3; AE H)
6 GE 4 at 4 (emphasis added)
7  In  March  2016,  DOD  CAF  issued  Applicant  a  Memorandum  of  Intent  (MOI)  to  revoke  his  security
clearance,  alleging  security  concerns  due  to  the  DUI  arrest.  As  a  result,  his  security  clearance  was
suspended. Applicant responded to the MOI on March 15, 2016. (GE 8)  Because he retired from the Air
Force soon thereafter, it does not appear that the March 2016 MOI was ever adjudicated. (Tr. 189-190)
Applicant resumed drinking after leaving the Air Force. He said in his background
interview that he resumed drinking in June 2016 (about one year after the DUI). (GE 2
at 12) At hearing, he said he resumed drinking around his birthday, in September 2016
(about 15 months after the DUI). (Tr. 134-136, 158, 176-177)
Applicant testified that his current pattern of consumption is to have two to three
drinks about two or three times a week. He described his pattern as social drinking with
family  and  friends,  such  as  on  weekends  watching  football,  and  a  drink  on  special
occasions, such as birthdays or holidays. (Tr. 137-138, 177-178; GE 2 at 2, 12) He said
when he is on business travel, he takes customers out and will “probably have a couple
more drinks than my average.” (Tr. 138)
Applicant’s renewed consumption of alcohol is alleged as a security concern, as
it post-dates his treatment for alcohol use disorder. (SOR ¶ 1.e) In an affidavit submitted
with his Answer to the SOR, he reported that:
[Applicant’s  mental  health  doctor  during  ADAPT  treatment]  knew  I  was
abstaining  from  alcohol  during  treatment  and  that  I  was  hitting  or
exceeding all of my progress goals. My doctors also knew I had not made
a decision as to whether I would abstain forever, and complete abstinence
was  never  a  mandatory  part  of  my  long-term  treatment  plan.  In  fact,  I
recall several treatment sessions where we discussed that living sober did
not necessarily mean living dry.8
Applicant also stated in his affidavit that he was required to abstain from alcohol
only  as  long  as  he  was  on  flight  orders,  though  this  was  “not  an  official  part  of  my
treatment  plan.”  (Ans. Enc. 3  at  2)  He  asserted  in  his  affidavit  that his resumed  social
drinking  has  been  safe  and  responsible,  and  without  any  adverse  issues,  either
personally  or  professionally.  Applicant  also  attested  that  “my  responsible  consumption
of  alcohol  is  completely  in  line  with  my  treatment  plan,  as  explained  to  me  by  my
doctors when I completed treatment.” (Ans. Encl. 3 at 2) He testified that he was never
told by his doctors that he could never drink alcohol again. (Tr. 133, 158, 171) Applicant
was  not  told  by  anyone  else  that  he  is drinking  too  much.  (Tr. 191)  These  statements
are  unsupported  by  updated  corroborating  documentation.  Applicant  did  not  indicate
that  he  currently  drinks  to  intoxication,  and  he  reported  no  additional  alcohol-related
offenses or “negative incidents.” (Tr. 138, 176; GE 2)
After retiring from the Air Force, Applicant continued marital counseling. He also
supported  his  wife  as  they  sought  medical  care  at  various  hospitals  for  her  medical
conditions,  as they  raised  their  three  children.  He  began  a busy  travel schedule  in  his
current job. Applicant attended the “AA for aviators” support group for about a year and
benefitted from it, but stopped going in part because it was geographically difficult to get
there.  (Tr.  182-183:  GE  2  at  12)  Applicant  offered  no  evidence  at  hearing  that  he  is
8 Ans. Encl. 3; see also Tr. 133-134.
currently  participating  in  AA  or  any  similar  counseling  group,  nor  did  he  indicate
sustained involvement with a formal support network to help him address his drinking.
Applicant testified that after the DUI, he was prohibited from driving in the county
in  State  2  where  the  offense  occurred.  (Tr. 174) Shortly  before  his  DOHA  hearing,  he
was on a business trip in another state, and was told that his driver’s license was about
to  expire,  which  he  had  not  noticed.  Even  though  he  had  lived  in  State  1  for  several
years, he still had a driver’s license from State 3, where he had served in the Air Force
from 2007 to 2010. (GE 1 at 17) When he sought to get a new license, he learned that
his  State  3  driver’s  license  had  been  suspended  as  a  result  of  the  DUI.  Applicant
testified that he was unaware of this, and said that he did not drive until his license was
renewed. (Tr. 183-188)
After the hearing, Applicant presented documentation from State 3 of an alcohol
assessment  he  underwent  in  November  2018  in  order  to  have  his  driving  privileges
renewed there (a prerequisite for getting a valid license in State 1). He testified that he
was issued a valid driver’s license from State 1 a few days before his hearing. (Tr. 183-
188)
The assessment is from a licensed professional counselor (LPC) in State 1.  (AE
J;  AE  L)  She  met  with  Applicant  for  one  hour,  in  November  2018.  (AE  I)  The
assessment summarizes the procedural history of the DUI case in State 2, Applicant’s
treatment  and  counseling,  retirement  from  the  Air  Force,  and  the  requirements  of  his
probation.  The  assessment  does  not  mention  Applicant’s  June  2015  diagnosis  of  a
severe  alcohol  use  disorder,  or  the  February  2016  diagnosis  that  his  disorder  was  in
early remission at that time. The documentation does not include an updated diagnosis
of Applicant’s alcohol use disorder.
With respect to a prognosis, the assessor finds that Applicant “did not present as
a risk to himself or others regarding the use of alcohol.”  The LPC found that Applicant
demonstrated that “he is managing his stress level and appears to be functioning within
normal limits at this time.” (AE J at 15/26)
The  assessor  noted,  however,  that  a  “plan  should  be  in  place  for  [Applicant]  to
manage  his  stress  levels  and  not  [succumb]  to  relapse  or  alcohol  abuse.”  (AE  J  at
13/26)  Counseling  was  recommended  to  help  him  manage  his  stress  and  his  wife’s
health issues. (AE J at 16/26) After the hearing, Applicant e-mailed the LPC and said he
wanted  to  begin  counseling  with  her.  (AE  K)  There  is  no  indication  of  additional
counseling with the LPC as of the date the record closed.
In his testimony, Applicant acknowledged his poor judgment the night of the DUI.
He  referred  to  the  event  as  “life-changing.”  He  intends  to  continue  making  “good
personal decisions” and relying on his support network of family, friends and counselors
going forward. He is also very patriotic, and understands the security significance of his
actions.  He  accepted  responsibility  for  his  actions  and  was  remorseful.  (Tr.  123,  139-
143)
Two witnesses from Applicant’s current employment testified. Witness 1 (W1) is
a senior lead engineer for Applicant’s employer. Applicant is one of his supervisors, but
they  work  in  separate  geographic  areas.  Witness  2  (W2)  is  the  facility  security  officer
(FSO) for Applicant’s employer and several of its subsidiaries. (AE D) He  served in the
Air  Force  for  30  years,  retiring  as  a  master  sergeant.  Both  W1  and  W2  have  had
clearances  for  many  years.  Applicant’s  work  performance  is  “beyond  reproach”  and
“stellar.” Applicant has been upfront about the DUI, and uses it as a cautionary tale for
others. The incident had a “huge impact on him.” W1 and W2 are aware that Applicant
abstained from alcohol for a year and has resumed drinking.  As the FSO, W2 has had
interaction  with  others  who  have  had  alcohol  issues.  He  noted  no  “telltale”  signs  of
alcohol  issues  with  Applicant.  He  said  it  would  be  a  security  concern  if  Applicant  had
repeated  alcohol  issues,  but  he  had  none,  but  for  the  DUI.  Both  W1  and  W  2  rate
Applicant  a  “10”  (on  a  1-10  scale)  for  national  security  trustworthiness  and  suitability.
(Tr. 37-49; (Tr. 50-55; AE D)
Two  other  witnesses  testified  who  had  firsthand  knowledge  of  the  DUI  and  its
aftermath. Witness 3 (W3) and Witness 4 (W4) are both retired Air Force colonels. W3
was the deputy division chief at the Air Force command where Applicant  served at the
time of the DUI. W4 was Applicant’s supervisor at the time, and he issued Applicant GE
7,  the  letter  of  reprimand.  Applicant’s  performance  at  the  command  was  “outstanding”
and  “exemplary.”  Both  W3  and  W4  recommended  that  Applicant  retain  his  rank  at
retirement. (AE A; AE B) W3 testified that he has “absolute faith and trust” in Applicant,
and he provides a valuable service to the Air Force in his position. W3 regards Applicant
as a “fine gentleman.” (Tr. 71-108)
W4  is  aware  of  Applicant’s  participation  in  alcohol  treatment.  W4  said  that
Applicant’s  professionalism  “never  wavered”  after  the  DUI.  He  said  Applicant  was
forthcoming,  admitted  his  mistakes,  and  wanted  to  move  forward  from  them.  W4
believes  Applicant  has  learned  “a  tremendously  difficult  lesson.”  Applicant’s  judgment,
trustworthiness,  and  reliability  are  “upstanding  [and]  of  the  highest  order”  and  he
believes Applicant should have a clearance. (Tr. 89-108; AE B; AE E)
Witness  5  (W5)  is  Applicant’s  brother.  He  testified  by  phone.  He  is  a  police
sergeant  in  a  large  U.S.  city.  He  is  professionally  experienced  with  the  importance  of
confidentiality,  privacy,  and  the  protection  of  sensitive  information.  W5  testified  that
Applicant is a loving father and family man with excellent character. (Tr. 111-113) W5 is
aware of the DUI, but has never known Applicant to otherwise behave irresponsibly with
alcohol. W5 is aware of Applicant’s alcohol treatment, his one year of abstinence, and
the  fact  that  he  has  resumed  drinking.  It  does  not  cause  W5  concern  with  respect  to
Applicant’s  ability  to  safeguard  secrets.  W5  considers  his  brother  a  role  model  and
“moral  compass.”  He  has  always  admired  Applicant’s  patriotism,  dedication,  and
commitment to his family. (Tr. 111-119)

"Applicant is a 42-year-old systems specialist employed by a government contractor
since  2016.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  1994.  Applicant  married  in  1993  and
divorced in 2003. He remarried in 2004 and divorced in 2015. He has four children. This
is his first application for a security clearance.
The SOR alleges Applicant has consumed alcohol to excess to at least November
2017. In May 2017, he was admitted to a hospital for a heart condition, and was treated
for five days in an alcohol-detoxification program. In September 2017, he was arrested
for driving while intoxicated (DWI). Applicant admitted the excessive drinking and detox
treatment allegations, but denied the DWI arrest because he was not prosecuted. The
Government’s documentary evidence is sufficient to support the SOR allegations.
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2017. He stated
that  in  March  2017,  he  was  placed  on  medical  leave  from  his  work  to  address  health
issues. He was on bed rest for 60 days, and developed depression. He started consuming
alcohol heavily, including up to a fifth of whiskey a day. His spouse urged him to seek
treatment after Applicant thought he was having a heart attack. He underwent a five-day
inpatient  alcohol-detoxification  program  and  was  treated  for  depression.  He  was
prescribed Wellbutrin and Effexor, which he still uses. Applicant returned to work in May
2017. At that time, he described his current use of alcohol as “minimal,” to include one-
to-two shots of whiskey a month.
In September 2017, Applicant was arrested for DWI. He began drinking at home
where he consumed about four to five shots of vodka over one to two hours. When he
ran out, he drove to a store for another pint of vodka. Applicant was stopped by police for
a  traffic  violation,  was  arrested,  and  held  overnight.  Applicant  immediately  referred
himself to a 24-day inpatient alcohol treatment program. The prosecutor did not pursue
the DWI charge.
Applicant  was  re-interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in  November  2017,
where he disclosed his DWI and alcohol-detoxification treatment. He also disclosed that
he enjoys drinking alcohol, and now consumes one to two pints of vodka per week, which
is less than the pint every one-two days that he previously consumed. He stated that he
is decreasing his alcohol use, and is continuing his counseling and the medications for
depression. He admitted using poor judgment when he drove after consuming alcohol,
and stated he will not do so in the future.
Since Applicant elected a decision without a hearing, I was unable to inquire further
into his alcohol use, treatment, alcohol-related arrest, medical evaluations, prognosis, and
any changes in lifestyle.
Law and Policies
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued revised adjudicative guidelines
(AG) in a Security Executive Agent Directive, effective on June 8, 2017. These AGs are
applicable to this decision.
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption
",False
"The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  G,  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
alcohol consumption, including after treatment. Applicant was also charged with alcohol-
related offenses including: two charges in 1997 for underage possession of alcohol, and
driving while intoxicated (DWI) with a minor under 15 years old. The SOR cross-alleged
the DWI arrest under Guideline J, criminal conduct. Additionally, the SOR alleges under
Guideline  H  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  from  1993  to  at  least  2015,  including  while
holding  a  security  clearance  in  2015,  and  misused  two  prescription  medications  from
September to October 2011, while holding a security clearance.  In Applicant’s answer,
she admitted all of the allegations with explanations, except she denied the extent of her
alcohol use after treatment, and denied use of marijuana after 2000, except for one time
in  May  2015.  The  record  evidence  substantially  supports  the  SOR  allegations.  After a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 40-year-old software engineer, employed by a defense contractor
since 2001. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2001. She married in 2005 and divorced
in 2013. She has two children, ages 12 and 17. She has held a security clearance since
2003.
Applicant was twice cited for underage possession of alcohol in 1997, while a 19-
year-old  college  student,  and  also  used  marijuana  on  occasion  until  2000.  Applicant
began working for her current employer after graduating from college in 2001. She was
married  in  2005  to  a  recovering  alcoholic.  Applicant  struggled  with  her  weight,  and  in
2010, she had gastric bypass surgery and was getting knee injections for arthritis. She
was prescribed pain medications because she could no longer use over-the-counter pain
medication  after  surgery.  At  times,  she  used  the  medications  even  after  the  pain
subsided, so it was not in compliance with the prescription directions.
Applicant  considered  herself  a  social  drinker,  but  her  beer  and  wine  use  also
increased  after  bypass  surgery  as  a  substitute  for  food.  She  stopped  drinking  in
September 2011, but had increased anxiety and depression. She was having difficulty in
her marriage and her children had behavioral issues. She stopped drinking in September
2011,  sought  counseling  in  October  2011  for  anxiety  and  depression,  and  was
recommended  to  include  treatment  for  alcohol  abuse.  She  was  tapered  off  the
prescription  medications  as  they  were  not  permitted  during  treatment,  and  began
treatment  for  alcohol  abuse,  anxiety,  and  depression.  She  denied  ever  receiving  a
diagnosis.  She  reported  her  treatment  to  her  employer,  continued  with  Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA), and successfully abstained from her self-imposed alcohol use until she
relapsed in 2015.
In 2013, Applicant and her spouse divorced, and, at the same time, her employer
transferred her job to another state. She moved as a single mother of two children, with
no friends, family, or other support. In 2015, Applicant’s parents were visiting and helped
her move from a rental property. After the move was completed, her father offered her
alcohol. She had two mixed drinks, and, without feeling any effects, drove to a drug store
for bath products when she suddenly felt the effects of the alcohol. Her nine-year-old son
met her outside and insisted on riding to the store with her. She ran a red light, and was
struck by another car. She was cited for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and was convicted
of misdemeanor DWI, fined, ordered to complete community  service, probation for two
years, and required to use an ignition interlock device. One month later, after returning
from work, Applicant stopped at a friend’s house, drank, and used marijuana offered by
the friend. This was her first and only use of marijuana since 2000, and was related to her
drinking on that day.
On advice of her friend, Applicant checked herself into a hospital outpatient eight-
week alcohol treatment program with a psychiatrist, and reported that she was suffering
from anxiety, stress, and being counseled at work for taking too many sick days. In 2015,
Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent but met criteria for early partial remission.
She  was  advised  to  stop  drinking,  and  was  prescribed  Antabuse  to  assist  her  with
cravings.  She  stopped  using  alcohol,  has  successfully  continued  Antabuse  without
incident, successfully completed the two-year ignition interlock program without incident,
and regularly attends AA and counseling with a therapist. Her psychiatrist and therapist
provided  positive  letters  of  support,  indicating  that  she  has  been  compliant  with  her
medications, attendance at AA and church. She has an AA sponsor and she is making
improvements in her mental health. Her AA sponsor wrote of her daily work with Applicant
since  2015,  and  despite  a  one-day  relapse  at  a  cookout  in  July  2017,  Applicant
reestablished sobriety immediately and reported her relapse in her AA meeting and to her
counselor.
Applicant’s friend testified on her behalf, was aware of her history and relapses,
and noted her efforts at sobriety as discussed above. Her friend, was very supportive of
her recovery. Her psychiatrist noted Applicant has developed better insight and is using
good  judgment.  With  continued  compliance  with  recommended  treatment,  Applicant’s
prognosis is “very good.”
Applicant  was  straightforward,  open  and  honest
testimony.  She
acknowledged her struggle with alcohol, but was encouraged by her efforts at sobriety,
abstinence, and treatment. She has made friends, and now has personal support that has
substantially  reduced  her  stress  and  anxiety.  Applicant’s  ex-spouse,  neighbor, friends,
in  her
church members, and employment team leader strongly support her, noting Applicant’s
friendship, love for her children, loyalty, and honesty.
Since 2017, Applicant noted that she has performed well at work, winning several
awards,  including  a  prestigious,  global company-wide  award  from  the  company’s chief
executive officer. This award noted Applicant’s energy, ingenuity, and integrity. She has
exceeded performance standards, and has a history of receiving monetary awards. She
believes her home-life is stable, understands how to deal with stress, regularly uses her
Antabuse medication and meets with her counselor and sponsor, and vowed to continue
to abstain from any further alcohol or drug use.
",True
"The SOR alleges that Applicant was admitted for inpatient alcohol-detoxification
treatment and diagnosed as alcohol dependence in February 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.a); that he
was admitted for inpatient alcohol-detoxification treatment in June 2016, diagnosed with
alcohol use disorder, and advised on discharge to abstain from alcohol (SOR ¶ 1.b); and
that  Applicant  continues  to  consume  alcohol  despite  his  treatment  for  alcohol
dependence/alcohol use disorder (SOR ¶ 1.c). When Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations, he admitted the alcohol-detoxification treatments but denied that he continues
to  drink  alcohol.  After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is a  43-year-old  high  school graduate, who has worked for a defense
contractor since July 2014. (GE 1.) He is currently a nuclear inspector and holds a DOD
secret clearance. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 26-28.) He previously worked as a mechanic for the
defense contractor from 2003 to 2006. (Tr. 27.)
Applicant  was  twice  married  and  divorced  before  he  married  his current  wife  in
February 2012. He and his spouse separated in 2017 and were in the process of a divorce
as of April 2019. Applicant has a 15-year-old daughter, a five-year-old son, and an 11-year-
old stepdaughter. (GEs 1-2, 4-5.)
Applicant began drinking alcohol at age 20. At age 26, he began drinking on a daily
basis. He received inpatient alcohol treatment for 45 days in 2004. (GE 3.) From March
2006 to February 2012, Applicant was employed as a parts supervisor. He left the job
following  a  disagreement  with  the  owner’s  son,  and  he was unemployed until October
2013. (GE 1.)
On  February  20,  2013,  Applicant  had  an  argument  with  his  spouse  that  was
overheard on the telephone by her ex-husband, who came over to the house. Applicant
was arrested for a disorderly conduct offense,1 but the charge was subsequently dropped.
He admits that he had consumed alcohol before the offense, although he denies he was
intoxicated. (GE 1; Tr. 28.) On February 21, 2013, Applicant went to a substance abuse
treatment facility requesting alcohol detoxification and referral to an outpatient treatment
program. He was admitted as an inpatient for medically-monitored alcohol detoxification. At
intake, he reported that he had consumed whisky the prior evening and that drinking was
an issue in his current marriage. His judgment and insight were assessed as poor, and he
was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependence  and  cannabis  abuse.  He  had  been  smoking
marijuana for the past 1.5 years to as recently as February 18, 2013. After completing the
detoxification  protocol,  Applicant  was  discharged  on  February  25,  2013,  in  improved
condition. His prognosis was considered good with follow-up in outpatient treatment and
continued involvement in community support programs. (GE 3.) Applicant now claims that
he had consumed a couple of beers before his February 2013 arrest; that he was court-
ordered to attend a program offered by the facility consisting of once weekly sessions
discussing “current issues or this or that;” and that he misunderstood the court order and
check himself into the facility instead. (Tr. 29.) Concerning his drinking pattern before that
detoxification treatment, Applicant testified, as follows:
I don’t know. I mean, that was a while ago. Nothing—I would say a couple of
beers, couple of beers at night or—like I’ve always had—we’ve always had
alcohol in the house, you known. I mean, maybe some—like a rocks glass of
Jack Daniels if I’m sitting down after the kids are sleeping or keep a sleeve of
nips2  in  the  freezer,  grab  one  or  two  nips  or  something  like  that,  but
nothing—an excessive consumption. (Tr. 29-30.)
Applicant admitted that he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent. However, he then
stated, “They diagnose everybody that’s alcohol dependent when they come in there.”3 (Tr.
30.)
Applicant was abstinent until sometime in 2014, when he began drinking one beer
per day while working on his old house. According to available medical records (GE 4), by
late  2014  or  early  2015,  Applicant  was  consuming  half  to  a  full  fifth  of  whiskey  or the
equivalent of 14 nips of alcohol and beers per day, usually in the evenings after work; that
drinking pattern persisted for the next 1.5 years; and it was beginning to adversely affect
his family life and his work. On June 3, 2016, he was voluntarily admitted for inpatient
alcohol detoxification to a substance-abuse treatment facility. Records indicate that he
reported  more  than  a  20-year  history  of  alcohol  dependence  and  an  inability  to  stop
drinking.  He  was  taking  prescribed  Ativan  for  anxiety  issues  and  was  aware  of  health
concerns  that  could  arise  from  combining  that  medication  with  alcohol.  Applicant  was
1  Applicant  indicated  on his SF 86 that he was charged with breach of peace in February 2014. (GE 1.)
However, medical records from February 2013 show that he had a charge of disorderly conduct pending
following his arrest on February 20, 2013. (GE 3.)
2 Applicant described a nip as 1.5 ounces of alcohol, “like a shot bottle.” (Tr. 30.)
3 Given Applicant’s denial of an alcohol dependency problem, it is likely that he meant to say that everyone that
is in the facility for alcohol detoxification is diagnosed as alcohol dependent.
diagnosed  with  alcohol  use  disorder,  moderate.  After  a  medically  uncomplicated
detoxification, he was discharged on June 6, 2016. A medical notation in the discharge
summary indicates that the hospital was unable to keep Applicant against his will. Applicant
was advised by his attending physician to abstain completely from alcohol. He was told that
he was at high risk of relapse without continued treatment. Applicant was not interested in
a residential program or day program because he wanted to return to work. He expressed
some  interest  in  an  intensive  outpatient  program,  but  then  did  not  participate  in  an
outpatient alcohol-treatment program. (GE 4.)
Applicant disputes the medical records indicating that he was drinking a half to one-
fifth  of  whiskey  or  combination  of  beer  and  liquor  per  day,  stating,  “That’s  not  even
possible.” He testified that if he had an alcohol problem, his inpatient stay would have been
a minimum of seven days because of withdrawal symptoms that occur between the fourth
and fifth days of detoxification. (Tr. 33.) He claims that he usually had a 12-pack of beer in
his refrigerator. He testified that he drank “a couple, two or three beers a day, maybe, like I
said, at night, if I’m working on the house, maybe two—two nips. . . . Three nips. I mean,
that’s like maybe three ounces of alcohol, four ounces, if that.” He indicated that he drank
as much as two or three beers plus two or three nips during the course of an evening only
occasionally when he had a lot to do and was not paying attention to his drinking. (Tr. 34-
35.) He could not explain the discrepancy in the accounts of his drinking habits. He was not
accompanied by anyone when he sought treatment in 2016.  (Tr. 49.)
Applicant  asserts  that  he  “pretty  much  stopped  drinking”  for  a  while  after  his
inpatient detoxification. (Tr. 36.) He put off following through with any aftercare. It was not a
priority for him. (Tr. 51.)
On November 1, 2016, Applicant sought counseling with a licensed alcohol and drug
counselor (LADC) affiliated with a private behavioral health practice. He reported that he
had last consumed alcohol about two weeks previously. During a session of November 8,
2016, he indicated that his drinking has been “very bad” and that he used alcohol to self-
medicate while dealing with difficult family issues. He and his spouse had separated. (GE
5.) He now claims to have no recall of any specific event that precipitated his counseling.
(Tr. 52.) On November 29, 2016, he told the LADC that he last drank alcohol about two
weeks  before  their  session.  He  went  to  an  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meeting  after
having one sip of alcohol. By January 17, 2017, Applicant and his spouse had reconciled.
Applicant stopping going to counseling at that time. (GE 5.)
By late April 2017, Applicant and his spouse had separated again.  On April 26,
2017, Applicant returned to the private behavioral health practice and began psychological
counseling with a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) for emotional distress caused by
his marital separation. At his intake session, Applicant reported that he had last consumed
alcohol  about  a  month  ago,  and  that  he  was  attending  AA  meetings  twice  weekly.  He
expressed that he was managing his alcohol use. He denied any use of alcohol as of late
July 2017. During a session with the LCSW on August 9, 2017, he reported a decline in his
AA attendance. (GE 6.)
On  August  29,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He responded affirmatively to an
inquiry concerning whether he had ever voluntarily sought counseling or treatment as a
result of his use of alcohol and listed his alcohol detoxification in February 2016 and his
counseling  with  the  LCSW,  which  he  indicated  started  in  June  2016.  Applicant  also
reported that he had charges of disorderly conduct and interfering with a police officer
pending against him since June 2017 after an argument with his spouse. He stated that the
charges would be dropped at his next court date. (GE 1.) A contemporaneous progress
note from his treating LCSW indicates that Applicant was “suspected to be intoxicated” on
the occasion of his June 2017 arrest. (GE 6.) Applicant testified at his hearing that he was
ordered by the court to obtain an alcohol and drug assessment to determine whether he
needed treatment, and that no treatment was recommended. (Tr. 22.)
In approximately October 2017, his spouse filed for divorce. By November 2017,
Applicant was drinking alcohol socially on occasion, although not when his children were in
his home. His therapist encouraged him in early November 2017 to attend AA if alcohol
became an issue. (GE 6.)
On December 5, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He reported his ongoing counseling for stress
caused by his marital separation and issues with his children. About the argument with his
spouse that led to his arrest in June 2017, Applicant explained that he was released by the
police so quickly because he was not intoxicated. Applicant was instructed by the court to
continue with his mental health treatment, and the charges were dismissed in September
2017. About his alcohol-detoxification treatment in February 2016, Applicant stated that he
voluntarily attended a two-day inpatient alcohol-detoxification program in an attempt to
prove to his spouse that he did not have alcohol dependency and to repair his marriage.
He related that he had alcohol counseling from the behavioral health provider from June
2016 to July 2016 [sic] because he wanted to prove to his spouse that he did not have an
alcohol dependency problem. He claimed that he discontinued the treatment shortly after it
began because his treatment provider determined that he did not have a condition that
warranted further treatment. Applicant described his current alcohol use as moderate, and
indicated that he was drinking two to three beers three to four nights per week after work
and on the weekends. He also consumed a glass of whiskey at night on occasion. He
denied that his drinking had any appreciable effect on his behavior. (GE 2.)  Applicant had
no answer at his hearing for why he resumed drinking alcohol against medical advice. (Tr.
39.)
As of a session with the LCSW in early January 2018, Applicant was hoping to
reconcile with his spouse. He admitted to having consumed a couple of drinks socially not
to self-medicate. After a total of 23 sessions with the LCSW focused on his marital issues,
Applicant was discharged from counseling on February 1, 2018. The LCSW was leaving
the practice, and she was in agreement with Applicant that he was ready for discharge.
(GE 6.)
In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on June 15, 2018, that he
was drinking two or three beers and one or two drinks of liquor on a weekly basis to as
recently  as  June  10,  2018.  He  denied  that  he  was  currently  consuming  alcohol  to
intoxication.  He  responded  “None”  to  separate  inquiries  concerning  his  last  date  of
intoxication and last date of blackout. (GE 2.) At his hearing, he testified that he could
recall  blacking  out  from  drinking  only  one  time,  which  was  at  his  bachelor’s  party  in
approximately 2012. (Tr. 56-57.)
In March 2019, Applicant and his estranged spouse stipulated to sharing joint legal
and physical custody of their five-year-old son. They agreed that neither Applicant nor his
spouse would consume alcohol during access with their son. Applicant has his son three
days one week and four days the next week. (AE C.)
Applicant testified at his April 2019 hearing that he obtained alcohol treatment “more
to save [his] marriage than anything,” and added that his drinking was always brought up
by his spouse’s family as a reason for him and his spouse not to be together. (Tr. 25.) He
indicated that there was a break in his counseling after his therapist left the practice, but
she returned, and he resumed his therapy, which has continued on a weekly basis. (Tr. 22-
23, 37.) He has not attended an AA meeting in 2019. (Tr. 38, 45.) Applicant testified that
his present  consumption  of  alcohol is “very limited. . . . Maybe two times a week.” He
consumed a couple of drinks over the weekend before his hearing when he had company
for dinner. (Tr. 42.) After an argument with his estranged spouse a couple of weekends
before his hearing, she complained to the police that he had been drinking around their
minor child. According to Applicant, the police performed a wellness check and then left
after only four minutes. (Tr. 42-43.) Applicant denies that any drinking was involved, and
asserted that circumstances have been manipulated to “make it look really bad for him.” He
claims to have no recall of the last time he was intoxicated. (Tr. 43.) He was advised by his
physician to avoid drinking alcohol because of his anti-anxiety medication. His explanation
for not following that advice is that he takes his anti-anxiety medication on an as-needed
basis. (Tr. 58.)
Applicant denies that alcohol has had any effect on his work performance, citing his
merit and time increases in his pay over the past 4.5 years. (Tr. 25.) Applicant’s current
supervisor  has  worked  with  Applicant  since  June  2015.  He  attests  that  Applicant  has
demonstrated  such  reliability  at  work  that  upper  management  gave  Applicant  the
responsibility  of  being  a  closed  area custodian of three areas. Applicant is required to
handle classified and sensitive information, and he has done so without any infractions.
Applicant’s supervisor has not observed any behavior by Applicant that would cause him to
lose trust in him, and he highly recommends that Applicant be allowed to retain his nuclear
inspection and security liaison positions. (AE A.)
The supervisor of security services indicates that Applicant’s work as a closed area
custodian is in one of the most sensitive areas at their facility. Applicant’s duties in that
regard include “protecting and inspecting classified and sensitive information, conducting
inventory of classified and sensitive information, maintaining control of classified areas,
training  employees  who  work  in  classified  areas  and  supporting  internal  and  external
security  audits.”  He  attests  that  Applicant  never  hesitates  to  support  the  security
department, and he has become an integral member of their team. Applicant has become
“essential” to their daily operations, and he has been dedicated to his job. (AE B.)

Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  has  never  married  and  has  no  children.  He  has
worked for a defense contractor since January 2016. Before his current position he was
incarcerated  in  a  state  penitentiary  for  28  months  for  felony  aggravated  assault.  Upon
his release from prison, he was placed on probation, which he successfully completed
in February 2016. He has a high school diploma.1
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  discharged  a  firearm  into  an  unoccupied  vehicle  in
May 2012, which resulted in a citation for criminal damage (SOR ¶ 1.a). It also alleged
that in August 2012, Applicant shot an associate in the face, pushed his body out of his
truck,  and  fled  the  scene.  He  was  charged  with  attempted  first  degree  murder  and
aggravated  assault.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  aggravated  assault  and  was  sentenced  to
three  and  one-half  years  imprisonment  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  The  amended  SOR  alleged  that
Applicant  was  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  when  he  committed  the  acts  alleged  in
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  (SOR  ¶  2.a).  Also  in  the  amended  SOR,  all  the  above  acts  were
cross-alleged as personal conduct under Guideline E (SOR ¶ 3.a).
On approximately May 10 and into May 11, 2012, Applicant and a friend (F) (who
he  described  as  his best  friend  at  that  time)  were  drinking  alcohol  at  a friend’s  house.
Upon  leaving  the  residence,  rather  than  driving  home,  Applicant  chose  to  sleep  in  his
truck parked outside. The police were called when a neighbor’s car alarm went off. The
police investigated noting that a car window was broken close to where Applicant’s truck
was parked. Applicant was sleeping in his vehicle when the police approached him. He
was  questioned  about  whether  he  damaged  the  car  window.  Applicant  appeared
intoxicated to the officer. Applicant said he did not know if he broke the window, but that
it was possible that he broke it. Applicant had a loaded pistol in his truck at the time of
the  incident.  Evidence  discovered  at  the  scene  included  a  shell  casing  next  to  the
damaged car. Applicant was issued a citation for criminal damage to property. The case
1 Tr. 85, 95, 98; GE 1.
was  disposed  of  through  a  civil  compromise  where  Applicant  paid  the  victims  of  his
criminal  damage  and  his  criminal  case  was  dismissed.  His  father  paid  the  civil
compromise fee on behalf of Applicant. Applicant admitted that alcohol played a part in
this incident.2
In  August  2012,  Applicant  and  F  engaged  in  an  evening  of  drinking  at  various
locations.  Applicant  claims  F  also  used  Xanax  as  well.  Applicant  claimed  he  drank  at
least seven alcoholic beverages and F drank more than that. After leaving a restaurant,
Applicant  and  F  drove  away  in  Applicant’s  truck.  Applicant  had  two  handguns  in  his
truck,  one  in  the  center  compartment,  and  one  in  the  driver’s  side  compartment.
Sometime late in the evening, Applicant and F began arguing. It reached the point that
Applicant  claimed  that  F  reached  into  the  center  compartment  and  grabbed  the  gun.
Applicant  reacted  by  pulling  the  gun  on  the  driver’s  side  and  shooting  F  in  the  face,
opening  the  passenger  door,  pushing  F  out,  and  driving  away.  He  admitted  using
alcohol  that  night,  but  testified  that  he  was  in  control  of  his  senses  when  he  shot  F.
Later,  he  was  arrested  by  the  police  and  charged  with  attempted  first  degree  murder
and two counts of aggravated assault. After consulting with his attorney, he decided to
forego  pursuing  self-defense  with  a  not  guilty  plea  at  trial.  Instead,  Applicant  pleaded
guilty  to  aggravated  assault  in  May  2013,  and  was  sentenced  to  three  and  one-half
years  in  the  state  penitentiary.  Upon  completion  of  his  sentence,  he  was  placed  on
probation, which he successfully completed in February 2016. F survived the shooting,
but has had multiple surgeries since the shooting. Applicant does not recall apologizing
to F or his family at his sentencing hearing. He has not spoken to F since the incident.
Applicant  had  no  misconduct  incidents  while  incarcerated  and  has  had  no  law
enforcement involvement since his release.3
Applicant  admitted  that  he  used  alcohol  before  both  the  May  and  August  2012
incidents. He did not receive any alcohol treatment or counseling while incarcerated. He
continues  to  drink  alcohol.  The  last  time  he  was  intoxicated  was  at  a  friend’s  wedding
about  a  year  ago.  He  consumed  about  five  drinks  in  five  hours.  He  has  not  sought
alcohol treatment or counseling since leaving prison.4
Applicant  presented  the  testimony  of  three  officers  from  his  company  (the  vice
president  of  finance,  the  chief  operating  officer,  and  the  chief  executive  officer)  at
hearing. They also provided statements. All described the process of hiring Applicant for
their IT position. They were aware of his legal issues when they hired him. Applicant’s
father formerly worked for the same company and suggested him for the position. The
officers knew there was risk involved should they hire Applicant. They decided to do so
anyway. They universally believe the company has been rewarded many times over by
hiring  Applicant.  He  has  earned  more  and  more  responsibility  by  performing  in  an

outstanding  manner.  All  the  officers  trust  Applicant  implicitly  and  all  recommend  the
granting of his clearance.5

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact. He is 27 years old, married, and he has one child, a minor. He has
owned his home since approximately 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 9, 45-66, 85; GE 1; AE I).
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  2010.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree
from  The  U.S.  Military  Academy  at  West  Point  (West  Point)  in  2014  and  was
commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was involuntarily honorably
discharged in November 2016. He was unemployed until March 2017, when he became
a systems engineer for his current employer, a defense contractor. As of the date of the
hearing, he was pursuing his master’s degree and expected to obtain it in May 2020. He
has held a security clearance since 2011. (Tr. at 6-7, 85-90, 96-100, 105-115, 144-146,
163; GE 1, 4, 5, 6; AE D, F, I, K, M, N).
Applicant  began  consuming  alcohol  when  he  was  a  senior  in  high  school.  He
drank a few beers on occasion. He did not consume alcohol during his first year at West
Point, but drank about five to seven beers on the six to seven occasions when he was
on  leave from West  Point during  his second  year.  His  leave  increased  during  his  third
year  and  he  drank  five  to  seven  beers  on  12  to  14  occasions.  By  his  fourth  year,  he
consumed six to nine beers approximately once monthly. (Tr. at 164-167; AE I).
In  November 2014,  Applicant  was  cited  with  public  drunkenness.  He  was  a  22-
year-old flight school student. He described his level of alcohol consumption during this
period  as  the  same  as  his  fourth  year  at West  Point.  He  and  his  classmates  had  just
completed  their  two-month  basic  officer  leadership  course  and  decided  to  attend  a
weekend  college football  game  during  their two  week  break  to  “blow  some  steam off.”
He  drank  beer  and  mixed  drinks  from  early  in  the  day  while  tailgating,  fell  asleep
sometime after the game commenced, and was wakened by a campus police officer for
sleeping  in  public  and  taken  to  a  local drunk  tank  to  get  sober.  He  was  cited,  pled  no
contest, and paid his fine. He “laid low” from consuming alcohol for a while because he
was upset and ashamed of himself. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 3.a; Tr. at 90-96, 100-103, 146-
147, 167-168, 171-172; GE 1; AE I).
From November 2014 to April 2016, Applicant was “deep into the training of flight
school.” He and his classmates consumed alcohol at a friend’s house or a local bar to
“enjoy the free time that we did have.” By January 2016,  his alcohol consumption had
increased  to  eight  to  ten  beers  every  weekend.  In  April  2016,  he  was  arrested  and
charged with driving under the influence (DUI). This was his first DUI. He was 23 years
old and a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was less than one week from flight school
graduation and felt “on top of the world . . . a little bit invincible.” He attended a party at
a friend’s house with the intention of spending the night. He consumed beer and mixed
drinks and drove home. The police stopped him after he took “a right-hand turn out of
the  straight-only  lane”  and  then  a  “left-hand  turn  without  signaling  my  turn.”  Upon  his
arrest,  he  initially  denied  having  consumed  alcohol  out  of  fear,  but  then  admitted  to
drinking during his field sobriety test. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .16%. (SOR
¶¶ 1.b, 2.a, 3.a; Tr. at 60, 90-96, 103-117, 147-154, 158-161, 168-169, 172-173; GE 1,
2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE I, J, M, N).
The  DUI  was  nolle  prossed.  The  U.S.  Army  revoked  Applicant’s  driving
privileges;  issued  him  a  General  Officer  Memorandum  of  Reprimand  (GOMR)  in  May
2016; and notified him in July 2016 that he would be involuntarily honorably discharged.
He  enrolled  in  and  completed  the  Army  Substance  Abuse  Program  (ASAP)  in  May
2016,  through  which  he  received  alcohol  counseling.  He  did  not  consume  alcohol  for
three  months  from  around  April  to  July  2016.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  2.a,  3.a;  Tr.  at  60,  90-96,
103-117, 147-154, 158-161, 168-169, 172-173; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE I, J, M, N).
While  Applicant’s  involuntary  discharge  was  pending,  he  was  charged  with  his
second  DUI  in  October  2016.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  2.a,  3.a).  He  was  24  years  old.  He  had
resumed consuming alcohol in July 2016 as self-medication for his depression about his
“unknown future and unknown fate.” His tipping point occurred in September 2016 when
his roommate moved out. He found himself socializing with “bar buddies” who he did not
really  know  and he  did  not  communicate or  seek  help from  his family  or friends.  On a
holiday  weekend,  he  consumed  alcohol  at  a  Halloween  party.  He  then  drove  to  a  bar
where he continued to consume alcohol. On his drive home, he was going too fast upon
arriving at an intersection, tried to turn his car sideways, hit  a curb, and flipped his car
into a ditch. His BAC was .23%. The DUI was dismissed. He was discharged from the
U.S Army honorably, due to unacceptable conduct. (SOR ¶ 3.b; Tr. at 90-96, 108, 117-
125, 132-133, 154-161, 168-169, 172-174; GE 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE F, I, M, N).
Applicant confided in his parents and wife after his second DUI. During his two-
to  three-week  out processing  from  the  U.S.  Army,  he  received  alcohol  counseling  and
treatment from the same ASAP counselor as his first DUI. The counselor diagnosed him
with  alcohol-related  disorder,  moderate  and  recommended  that  he  attend  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA)  and abstain from alcohol. His  father  took  him to his first  AA meeting
and he attended AA daily for two to three weeks. He testified that he accepted that he is
an  alcoholic  at  his  first  AA  meeting.  He  then  returned  to  live  with  his  parents  and
continued  to  attend  AA  meetings  weekly  to  twice  weekly  from  approximately  March
2017 until April 2018, when he relocated. He attended one to two AA meetings in June
2018. Since his October 2016 DUI, he consumed alcohol on  three occasions when he
was with close friends and family: he had three beers at his wedding in December 2016,
and four to five beers on two occasions in January 2017. (Tr. at 50, 60, 62-66, 121, 125-
144, 161-164,172-178; GE 1; AE A, I).
Applicant  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  January  2017.  He  intends  to  remain
sober.  He  testified  that  although  he  intends  to  resume  with  AA  meetings,  he  does  not
rely  on  AA  to  maintain  his  sobriety.  He  has  instead  focused  on  his  family,  job,
education,  exercise,  home,  church,  and  friendships  that  are  not  centered  around
alcohol. In June 2018, he sought an alcohol evaluation and his previous diagnosis was
updated
remission.  He  was
recommended  to  continue  with  AA  and  remain  sober.  He  does  not  have  any  other
alcohol-related  incidents.  He  testified  that  he  identified  that  the  root  cause  of  his
problems was alcohol, so he completely removed it from his life. He testified:
to  alcohol-use  disorder,  moderate
in  sustained
I  don’t  regret  what  happened,  because  my  life  has  completely  turned
around from it. I think if I didn’t have the second DUI, I would really, truly
[not]  realized  I  had  a  problem  until  something  worse  might  have
happened.
(Tr. at 50, 60, 62-66, 121, 125-144, 161-164, 175-178; AE B, C, I).
Applicant  disclosed  to  his  previous  and  current  managers  his  first  DUI  and  his
consequent military discharge.  He testified that he  would disclose his second DUI, but
had  not  done  so  because  he  was  not  so  required,  since  it  was  not  a  conviction.  He
received a performance evaluation rating of “successful” from his employer in 2017 and
an “excellent” rating in 2018.  (Tr. at 96-100, 170-171; AE E, G, I, L).
Applicant’s  wife  testified.  She met and began  dating Applicant  in 2014  and  was
aware  of  his  alcohol-related  incidents  and  involuntary  discharge  from  the  U.S.  Army.
She  reiterated  that  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  January  2017.  She  does  not
consume  alcohol.  She  testified  that  though  they  have  found  themselves  in  social
situations  where  alcohol is present,  to  include  through  their  intramural kickball  league,
she  has  no  concerns  about  his  ability  to  maintain  sobriety.    She  described  him  as  a
matured,  responsible, determined,  self-motivated  individual  “focused  on his health and
his career and family” who has “turned his life around.” She testified that Applicant has
“realized that alcohol serves no purpose in his life.” (Tr. at 45-66; AE H).
One of Applicant’s West Point classmates, who was also a roommate on various
occasions, testified. The witness was serving in the U.S. military on active duty as of the
date  of  the  hearing.  He  was  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  testified  that  while
attending West Point, he, Applicant, and their peers drank fairly often on the weekends.
Though  he  did  not  consider  Applicant  to  have  an  alcohol  problem,  he  was
“disappointed”  but  “not  completely  blindsided”  when  he  learned  of  Applicant’s  DUIs.
Since  graduation,  they  communicate  approximately  once  monthly  and  see  each  other
occasionally.  The  witness  testified  that  Applicant  informed  him  about  Applicant’s
sobriety.  The  witness  also  observed  Applicant  practice  sobriety  on  around  four
occasions  and  stated  that  he  has  no  concerns  with  Applicant’s  ability  to  maintain  his
sobriety.  He  described  Applicant  as  “very  intelligent”  and  one  who  has  “always  done
very well at everything he set his mind to.” (Tr.at 33-44; AE G).
Applicant’s colleague and mentor since 2017 testified. She previously interacted
with  him  daily,  but  since  his relocation  in  April 2018  they  interacted  twice  weekly.  She
testified  that  she  was  aware  of  his  alcohol-related  incidents  and  involuntary  military
discharge. She testified that he “has always  been one of the highest performing junior
engineers”  who  “performs  above  his  level.”  As  such,  she  has  given  his  managers
“extremely  positive”  peer  feedback  for  his  performance  evaluations.  She  testified  that
she  had  been  in  social  situations  with  Applicant  and  never  observed  him  consuming
alcohol.  She  was  aware  that  he  was  sober.  She  considers  him  to  be  an  honest  and
trustworthy individual. Numerous professional and social character references describe
Applicant  as  a  man  of  exemplary  character,  with  demonstrated
integrity  and
trustworthiness. (Tr. at 66-84; AE G).
",True
"Applicant admitted all four allegations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a- 1.d), with an explanation.
I have incorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 29 years old. He and his wife were married in November 2014. They
have a four-year-old son, and at the time of the hearing, were expecting another child.
Applicant  has  attended  some  community  college,  and  has  some technical training.  He
served as a helicopter mechanic in the United States Marine Corps Reserve (USMCR)
from April 2009 until March 2017. He served about two years on active duty, providing
humanitarian post-disaster relief in Haiti in 2010, and was also on active duty until mid-
2012 for various training duties. He was discharged honorably as a sergeant (E-5). (Tr.
21-22, 45, 47-51, 73, 83-84; GE 1, GE 2)
After holding several other civilian jobs,  Applicant began working in the defense
industry in late 2015. He was hired by his current employer in January 2017, in the field
of aviation maintenance. Since July 2017, Applicant has worked in Afghanistan, a month
at a time, followed by a month off at home. (Tr. 45-46, 62; GE 1) Applicant commented at
hearing that he loves working on helicopters and that it is the only job at which he excels.
This is his first application for a security clearance. He earns an annual salary of about
$125,000. (Tr. 21-23, 76; GE 1)
Applicant  began  drinking  at  age  18.  He  would  often  become  intoxicated  on
weekends. (Tr. 23-25) In June 2012, when he was 22 years old, Applicant was outside
with friends after drinking at a bar and they were “being loud.” The police were called, and
Applicant was “rude to the officer.” Applicant allegedly “blacked out” and was unable to
recall  the  incident  the  next  day.  He  was  detained  and  cited  for  public  swearing  and
intoxication, and was fined $25. (SOR ¶ 1.a) (Tr. 26-27, 51; GE 1 at 42-43; GE 3) During
his  detention,  Applicant  was  screened  by  an  assessor  for  alcohol  and  mental  health
issues. He was advised to stop drinking. (Tr. 27-28, 55-57)
In November 2013, Applicant was driving home from a party when he was pulled
over for speeding. He had consumed several drinks, and the officer smelled alcohol in
the car. After a field sobriety test, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while
intoxicated  (DWI)  and speeding.  In  about  March  2014,  he  was found  guilty,  fined, and
ordered  to  attend  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings  and  alcohol safety  awareness
program  (ASAP)  classes.  The  court  also  ordered  that  an  ignition  interlock  system  be
installed in his car. His driver’s license was restricted for six months, and he was placed
on two years of probation. (SOR ¶ 1.b) (Tr. 29-33, 51-53; GE 1 at 43-44; GE 3)
In October 2014, Applicant failed an ignition interlock test. He was charged with
being  non-compliant  with  the  ASAP  program.  He  pleaded not  guilty,  asserting  that  the
positive ignition test was caused by cologne. In February 2015, he was tried and found
guilt.  He  was  fined  and  ordered  to  spend  two  days  in  jail.  He  was  also  referred  to  an
alcohol program for an alcohol assessment and appropriate substance abuse treatment.
(SOR ¶ 1.c) (Tr. 31-33, 51-53; GE 1 at 44; GE 3) As he did during his court case, Applicant
asserted during his hearing testimony that the ignition interlock results were caused by
cologne. He said he had not been drinking at the time. (Tr. 53)
Applicant  entered  the  outpatient  alcohol  treatment  program  in  March  2015.  He
asserted in his intake interview that he had not had any alcohol since November 2013.
He  completed  a  substance  abuse  screening  assessment,  and  he  was  diagnosed  as
suffering from alcohol dependence. (GE 4 at 91, 102) The diagnosis is not alleged in the
SOR.
Applicant  was  referred  to  a  16-week  substance-abuse  class.  (GE  4  at  23,  91)
Applicant signed an acknowledgement that he was to abstain from alcohol consumption
during the treatment program. (GE 4 at 33; Tr. 37) He attended group counseling sessions
through AA about twice a week. (Tr. 65-67)
In June 2015, while in the alcohol treatment group program, Applicant went to visit
a friend in another state who was experiencing a mental health crisis. They went to a bar,
and Applicant had three beers and a mixed drink over several hours. Applicant got into a
fight, and punched another patron in the face. He was charged with public drunkenness
and harassment, and fined. (SOR ¶ 1.d) (Tr. 37-38, 53-55; GE 1 at 45; GE 3)
Applicant did not disclose the incident  at his next  AA group counseling  session.
(GE 4 at 53-75, 81) He said at hearing that he did not disclose the incident at the time
because he had been embarrassed about it. (Tr. 38-39, 55)
Applicant  was  discharged  successfully  from the  group  program  in August  2015.
(GE 4 at 79) He was to attend additional counseling sessions for recovering addicts at his
family’s  church,  similar  to  an  AA  program.  Applicant  did  not  follow  through  with  those
sessions  because  he  was  concerned  about  the  program’s  confidentiality,  due  to  the
program’s location. He has not participated in additional AA meetings since then. (Tr. 39-
41, 68-70)
Applicant has significantly curtailed his drinking. He said the last time he consumed
any alcohol was on New Year’s Eve 2018, when he consumed one large beer at a party
at his in-law’s house. He did not drive that evening. (Tr. 41-44, 58-61, 78-80; GE 2 at 2,
17)
Applicant has not sought an alcohol assessment from a medical provider to update
his 2015 diagnosis of alcohol dependence. He has not had any offenses or arrests since
June 2015. (Tr. 71)
Applicant disclosed his offenses on his SCA. He acknowledged his misconduct,
but said he had stopped drinking and had dedicated himself to caring for his wife and son.
(GE 1 at 52)
At hearing, Applicant acknowledged his wrongdoing and poor decision-making. He
blamed  his  prior  actions  on  “young,  immature  stupidity.”  He  said  he  has  matured
significantly since he has had the responsibility of raising a young family. He testified that
he knows he has “too much to lose” by consuming alcohol again. He and his wife recently
purchased  a  home,  and  he  was  recently  promoted  at  work,  in  a  job  that  requires  a
clearance. Tr. 21-23-44, 71-77)
Applicant keeps no alcohol in his house. The people he and his wife socializes with
now are young parents. He no longer drinks at bars. When he is home from Afghanistan,
Applicant works in his garage restoring a car, and manages child care for his son, since
his  wife  works.  (Tr.  71-77)  Alcohol  is  not  available  in  Afghanistan,  so  there  is  no
opportunity for him to drink when he is working there. (Tr. 46-47, 63, 70)
Applicant’s  wife  wrote  a  supportive  reference  letter,  in  which  she  attests  to  her
husband’s growth and maturity as a husband and father. He is hardworking, dependable,
and  honest.  Applicant’s  supervisor
to  his  maturity,
professionalism,  and  integrity.  He  is  a  dedicated  professional,  and  is  entrusted  with
releasing aircraft as “safe for flight,” a serious responsibility upon which lives depend. The
supervisor wishes there could be “ten more just like him.” A personal friend attested to
Applicant’s character as a husband, father, and proud veteran. (AE A, AE B, AE C)

"A  40-year-old  chemist  who  has  served  in  his  current  position  for  13  years,
Applicant  has  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  is  considered  to  be  a  “dedicated,
hardworking,  and  trusted”  member  of  his  work  team.  (Ex.  A)  Applicant  is  married  and
has one preteen child.
Applicant  first  began  trying  alcohol  in  about  1996  as  a  teen.  Before  his  more
recent incidents involving alcohol, Applicant’s only legal infractions took place while he
was  an  undergraduate  student:  a  1999  arrest  leading  to  the  charges  of  possession  of
marijuana  and  possession  of  paraphernalia  and  a  2000  arrest  for  driving  under  the
influence (DUI) that was reduced to reckless driving. Applicant has not used marijuana
again since that time, nor does he socialize with those who use it. He has not consumed
alcohol  to  excess  since  November  2016,  and  has  not  had  alcohol  since  June  or  July
2017.
Many  of  Applicant’s  troubles  began  in  2010.  In  that  year,  he  and  his  family
suffered multiple devastating tragedies, including the death of his infant daughter, then
his  mother  passed  away  suddenly  a  few  weeks  later.  His  supervisor  later  noted  that
these events led to increased alcohol use and symptoms of depression. (Ex. C) During
this  time  he  was  cited  for  driving  while  intoxicated  (DUI),  and  he  was  given  probation
before judgment. He felt the court was too lenient and, on his own initiative, he started a
12-week  alcohol  program  as  well  as  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  attendance.  (Tr.  21)
He was not entirely satisfied by either effort. While he continued to imbibe, however, his
consumption  of  alcohol  was  reduced  significantly.  A  period  of  leave  from  work  lasting
about  three  months,  along  with  professional  counseling,  proved  to  be  effective  in
helping Applicant refocus. (Ex. C)
About two years later, Applicant and his wife had a child. He became protective
of the new baby and mindful not to drink to excess. In about November 2016, Applicant
drank alcoholic beverages at a friend’s home. Feeling intoxicated, he spent the night at
the house. In the morning, he began driving home, but fell asleep at a lengthy red light.
A concerned citizen saw him asleep and took control of his vehicle, pulling it into a fast
food store’s parking lot.
Concerned  Applicant  might  have  been  experiencing  some  sort  of  diabetic
condition, the citizen asked someone to call for an ambulance. When the police arrived,
he  was  ultimately  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while  impaired  by  alcohol  (DWI),
DUI, negligent driving, reckless driving, and failure to obey properly placed traffic control
instruments. At the time, Applicant was unaware he was legally impaired and thought he
was  only  tired.  He  refused  a  breathalyzer  test  because  it  was  his  understanding  that
one should always do that. The arrest awakened him to the facts as they were, and he
immediately repented his inattentiveness and failure to self-monitor.
On  his  own  volition,  Applicant  put  himself  into  a  three-day  inpatient  “lockup”
program  where  a  patient  is  subjected  to  intensive  counseling  all  day.  The  experience
was eye-opening. After receiving a certificate for successfully completing that program,
he entered a second program for three months at an outpatient center. There, he found
much in terms of self-discovery through batteries of tests and introspection.2 (Tr. 25)
During this time, Applicant also returned to AA. He learned that each meeting site
had its own character. After checking several of them out, he found a group that was a
good  fit  and  where  he  learned  from  the  stories  of  others.  He  started  attending  about
three times  a  week  minimum.  He  continues attending  to  date,  visiting  the  site  three  to
six times a week, “like a sponge, to try to get any information I can from them.” (Tr. 26)
He  attributes  his  nearly  two  years  of  sobriety  to  these  meetings,  citing  it  as  one of  his
largest  supports.  (Tr.  26)  He  is  also  supported  by  his  family,  who  is  expecting  a  new
baby  within  a  couple  of  months.  In  addition,  he  has  his  own  personal  desire  and
conviction  to  be  free  from  future  trouble  involving  alcohol.  Finally,  Applicant  and  his
family  are  becoming  increasingly  active  with  their  church.  Having  had  his  probation
abated  early  and  with  a  support  structure  in  place,  he  now  feels  he  is  on  his  way  to
starting over. (Ex. 7)
Applicant  told  his  supervisor  in  November  2016  that  he  had  suffered  a  relapse
and  had  actively  resumed  counseling.  He  has  been  open  about  his  issues  at  work,
where his career has been flourishing. With AA still an integral part of his life and while
maintain  healthy  sobriety,  Applicant  finds  he  is  much  more  productive  at  home.  He
noted that “everything with [his] wife and child has been a million times better.” (Tr. 35)
Living without alcohol has brought him closer to his wife, now that time away from home
at friends’ homes for barbeques or sports is now spent as a family unit.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g.
He did not specifically admit or deny the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a, which cross-alleges the
conduct in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old cybersecurity analyst employed by a defense contractor.
He was a part-time bartender from August 2006 to May 2015, and he also worked part-
time  in  construction  and home-cleaning  services  from  June 2006 to  January  2013.  He
received an associate’s degree in May 2015. Shortly thereafter, he began working for a
defense contractor as a help-desk technician. In October 2017, he began working in his
current position. He has held a security clearance since December 2015.
Applicant has never married and has no children. He has lived with a cohabitant
and her three children since June 2017. (Tr. 95-96.)
In January 2013, Applicant was stopped by a state trooper for speeding (60 miles
per hour in a 45-mile-per-hour zone). Applicant had consumed three or four beers.  He
testified that a regular beer for him was a 22-ounce draft beer. (Tr. 98.) He failed a field
sobriety  test  and  a  breathalyzer  registered  a  blood-alcohol content  (BAC)  of 0.12.  (Tr.
100.) He was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). On advice of his
attorney, he attended an alcohol-education class before his court appearance. He could
not remember receiving any diagnosis after the class, but he remembered that he was
advised to modify his consumption. He followed that advice to the extent that he stopped
drinking hard liquor and limited himself to beer. (Tr. 101-02.) He pleaded guilty and was
sentenced  to  probation  before  judgment,  confinement  for  20  days  (suspended),  and  a
$185 fine. He was placed on probation for three years, until June 2016. (GX 3 at 1-2.)
In October 2015, Applicant was stopped by a state trooper for crossing the white
line on the edge of the road. He had consumed four or five beers. He was detained for

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
about  an  hour  until  he  was  released  to  his  brother’s  custody.  He  remembered  that  a
breathalyzer at the police station registered a BAC of 0.20. (Tr. 106.) The charges were
dismissed  pursuant  to  a  plea  agreement  requiring  him  to  make  a  $5,000  charitable
contribution, undergo a 28-day treatment program, and install an ignition interlock on his
vehicle. (GX 2 at 8; Tr. 107.) His treatment consisted of 54 group sessions and 4 individual
sessions.  He  was  diagnosed  with  a  severe  alcohol-use  disorder.  He  completed  the
program  in  November  2015.  The  treatment  facility  recommended  that  he  abstain  from
alcohol,  complete  an
intensive  outpatient  addiction-counseling  program,  attend
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or equivalent meetings a minimum of three times a week,
and obtain a male AA sponsor. Applicant abstained from alcohol for about two  or three
months, but he did not follow any of the other recommendations. (Tr. 110.)
In June 2018, Applicant was stopped by city police for driving without his headlights
turned on. He had spent the day on a beach vacation with his cohabitant and her sisters,
and had consumed several beers throughout the day. He was arrested for DUI. (GX 3 at
3-4.) His interim clearance was revoked on September 4, 2018. (SOR Answer at 16.) His
trial was pending when the SOR was issued. In December 2018, he entered an “Alford
plea,” which does not admit guilt but admits that the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to
prove guilt. (Tr. 113.) He was fined $600 and sentenced to 11 days in jail. He served four
days  and  received  a  work  release.  He  is  required  to  have  an  ignition  interlock  on  his
vehicle until July 3, 2019. (AX M at 2; Tr. 116-17.)
Applicant testified that after his arrest in June 2018, he went home, consumed half
a beer, and decided to stop drinking. He testified that he has not consumed alcohol since
June 22, 2018. (Tr. 115.)
In  July  2018,  Applicant  entered  a  12-week  substance-abuse  treatment  program
that  included  weekly  breathalyzer  tests  and  random  urinalysis  screening.  As  of
September 24,  2018, his prognosis was  “good.” (AX  E.) He  completed the  program  in
October 2018. (Tr. 124.)
Applicant began attending AA meetings on the day he was released from jail in
June 2018. He attended meetings daily for 60 days. He then began attending meetings
three times a week and calling his sponsor daily. He did not attend meetings or talk to his
sponsor for about six weeks in February-March 2019, but he has resumed meetings and
talks  to  his  sponsor  about  once  a  week.  (Tr.  118-22.)  His  sponsor  submitted  a  letter
expressing confidence in his continued sobriety and recovery. (AX F.)
Applicant’s  mother  and  stepfather  submitted  a  joint  statement,  and  his  mother
testified  at  the  hearing.  She  testified  that  for  many  years  they  had  little  contact  with
Applicant, even though they are a large and socially active family and underwent several
health emergencies. They witnessed his drinking binges and his hangovers. Since June
2018, Applicant has attended all family functions, he calls his mother daily, and his attitude
and  temperament  has  changed.  He  no  longer  is  involved  in  the  bar  and  restaurant
business and no longer indulges in the heavy drinking after work that was common when
he was working as a bartender. (Tr. 24-32; AX B.)
Applicant’s cohabitant submitted a statement and testified. She and Applicant have
known each other for about 13 years and both worked at the same bar and restaurant.
They  became  friends  and  now  live  together.  She  has  a  security  clearance  and  is  the
assistant facility security officer for a defense contractor. She testified that Applicant is a
kind and generous person and a talented and dedicated employee. She has watched him
attend  AA  meetings  and  listened  to  him talking  to  his sponsor. She  believes  he has  a
strong  support  system,  including  herself,  his  mother,  stepfather,  brother,  colleagues,
many friends, and his AA sponsor. She was present when Applicant returned from work
after his most recent arrest and said, “I can’t do this anymore. This is going to destroy my
life.”  She  testified  that  she  has observed Applicant at  events  where  alcohol  was  being
served,  and  he  has  seemed  comfortable  limiting  himself  to  non-alcoholic  drinks.  She
believes that he has been abstinent since June 22, 2018. (AX D; Tr. 34-46.)
Applicant’s  aunt,  a  recently  retired  federal  employee  with  33  years  of  service,
regards  herself  as  his  “favorite  aunt.”  She  testified  that  Applicant  comes  from  a  large,
strong family that supports his decision to overcome his alcohol problems. She testified
that the family gathers almost every month for a special occasion, and alcohol is served
at these gatherings. Applicant has attended every gathering, and he has not consumed
alcohol at any of them. (Tr. 58-66.)
Applicant’s supervisor when the June 2018 incident occurred testified that he was
notified when Applicant was arrested. His former supervisor changed jobs in August 2018,
moving from being the contractor lead to being the government lead. He was impressed
by Applicant when he was the contractor lead and continued to be impressed when he
became  the  government  lead.  He  and  Applicant  have  become  personal  friends.  They
recently traveled to a job location, and most of the contractor employees and government
employees went out for the evening after work, but Applicant asked to be dropped off for
an AA meeting in the area. (Tr. 78-85.)
Applicant’s supervisor since August 2018 testified and submitted a statement. She
testified that she and Applicant work together daily, and she has had the opportunity to
know him on a personal level. She testified that Applicant has been very open about his
problem with alcohol and his steps to overcome it. Applicant is under consideration for
promotion based on his technical skill, leadership, and overall performance. She admires
him  for  his  decision  to  seek  help,  complete  treatment,  and  commit  to  sobriety.  She
believes Applicant is qualified for a security clearance. (AX A; Tr. 68-77.)
Three  family  members  (his  father,  an  uncle,  and  a  cousin)  submitted  letters
attesting  to  Applicant’s  good  character  and  dedication  to  overcoming  his  alcohol
problems, and one of them suggested that alcohol abuse was a family problem. (AX I, J,
and K.) A former co-worker and a current co-worker regard him as hardworking, focused,
and passionate about his job. (AX G and H.)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 2.b through
2.e, and 3.a through 3.e. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information.
(HE 3) Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact
follow.
Applicant is a 43-year-old aircraft maintenance specialist in flight test mechanics
who has been employed by the same defense contractor since 2007. (Tr. 10, 13, 27) In
1995,  he  graduated  from  high  school.  (Tr.  10)  He  attended  college  for  several  years;
however, he did not receive a degree. (Tr. 10) He served in the Navy from 1998 to 2001,
and he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 10-11) In 2001, he
married; in 2010, he separated from his spouse; and in 2012, he divorced. (Tr. 11-12, 28)
His children are ages 13 and 16. (Tr. 12)
Financial Considerations
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant owes federal income taxes of $19,010 for tax
year 2011 and $5,096 for tax year 2012. He filed his 2011 and 2012 federal income tax
returns in April 2013. (Tr. 29-30) He has been aware that he owed federal income taxes
since April 2013. (Tr. 30) More details about his payments to address delinquent taxes
are contained in this section, infra.
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.f allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state M tax
returns for tax years 2013 through 2016. He said he filed his 2013 through 2016 federal
and state M tax returns in 2019. (Tr. 31) However, he might have filed those tax returns
in  the  last  half  of  2018,  based  on  the  payments  he  made  after  June  2018,  and  his
response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  indicating  he  planned  to  file  his  tax  returns  in  June
2018. (GE 2) Filing was somewhat delayed by a flood around 2012 and 2013 and possibly
by his divorce, which was final in 2012. (Tr. 31)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e allege Applicant owes state M income taxes as follows: $5,537
for tax year 2003; and a total of $10,572 for tax years 2011 and 2012. SOR ¶ 1.g alleges
in March 2014, a state M tax lien was filed against Applicant for $7,597. On September
21, 2018, Applicant paid the state M tax authority $20,000 by cashier’s check, and state
M  released  the  hold  on  Applicant’s  driver’s  license.  (AE  J;  AE  K)  In  October  2018,
Applicant paid the state M tax authority a total of $7,934 by cashier’s checks. (AE L; AE
M) He currently has a 2018 state M tax debt of $11,928, which is not alleged in the SOR.
(Tr. 39) He has not made any payments to address his 2018 state M tax debt. (Tr. 40)

Applicant’s annual salary is about $85,000. (Tr. 28) On May 1, 2019, the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) wrote Applicant and established a payment plan to address his
tax debts for tax years 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (AE A) It is unclear why some
of the tax years were not listed that are depicted  as delinquent in the above table. For
example, the federal tax debt for tax year 2018 of $36,082 does not appear to have been
included in the installment agreement. Applicant’s federal tax debt for 2018 was $36,082,
which  resulted  from  withdrawals  from  his  401(k)  account,  which  has  been  almost
exhausted. (Tr. 36-37, 71) According to the May 1, 2019 IRS installment agreement, his
monthly payments were supposed to be $1,000 with the first payment due on May 25,
2019. (AE A) He provided page 1 of the agreement. (AE A) In May 2019, he paid $100;
in June 2019, he paid $200; and in July 2019, he paid $100. (AE B) He is renegotiating
the payment plan because he believed the IRS erred and overestimated his gross annual
income or ability to pay the tax debt. (Tr. 35) He planned to pay the IRS $200 a month
until the monthly payment to the IRS is renegotiated. (Tr. 36-37)
On April 29, 2019, Applicant paid the IRS $42,463, which was used to address his
tax debt for 2012. (Tr. 32, 65; AE B) From December 3, 2018 to July 8, 2019, he made
one  payment  of  $3,563, one  payment  of  $2,022,  six  payments from $1,000  to $2,000,
and seven payments from $100 to $500 during this time period. (AE B) He estimated that
he  owed  the  federal  government  about  $65,000  after  he  was  credited  for  his  $42,463
payment when his home was refinanced. (Tr. 32-35, 37) He hopes to net about $45,000
on the sale of his residence, and he wants to use those funds to pay his tax debt. (Tr. 38)
He  is  also  working  overtime  to  obtain  additional  income  to  address  his  delinquent  tax
debt. (Tr. 40)
Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 3.a allege that around 1999, Applicant was charged with driving
under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI),  and  in  2000,  he  was  charged  with  driving  while
license suspended. (Tr. 40-41, 45, 64) He received deferred prosecution for five years for
the DUI, and the DUI charge was later dismissed after his successful completion of his
probation; however, he was convicted of driving with a suspended license. (Tr. 41) His
driver’s license was suspended for one year. (Tr. 41-42)
SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  in  May  2000  while  Applicant  was  in  the  Navy,  he  received
disciplinary action for failure to obey an order. Applicant violated the order of a chief petty
officer who told him to remove his sunglasses when he was on a vessel. (Tr. 43; GE 6 at
32) He had consumed alcohol ashore before the incident. (Tr. 44) He received nonjudicial
punishment for disobeying the order of the chief petty officer. (Tr. 44)
SOR  ¶  2.c.  alleges  in  September 2001,  Applicant  received  a  general  discharge
from  the  Navy  due  to  alcohol  rehabilitation  failure.  After  the  1999  DUI,  Applicant
volunteered to attend alcohol counseling. (Tr. 45) After the incident with the chief petty
officer in 2000, Applicant was discharged from the Navy for alcohol rehabilitation failure.
(Tr. 45-47)
SOR  ¶  3.b  alleges
in  December  2001,  Applicant  was  charged  with
assault/domestic violence. He struggled with his spouse and took the keys to his truck
from her. (Tr. 48-49) He conceded under state law the struggle constituted assault. (Tr.
49) He was not under the influence of alcohol. (Tr. 48) He attended anger management;
he was convicted of assault; and he received probation for two years. (Tr. 47-49)
SOR ¶ 3.c alleges in June 2007, Applicant was charged with petty theft/shoplifting.
He  wanted  to  purchase  sunglasses  at a military  exchange.  (Tr.  49-50) A  sales  person
would not assist him with the purchase. (Tr. 49-51) According to the January 29, 2008
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), he took the tag
off of the sunglasses and left his old sunglasses on the counter. (GE 2 at 67-68) During
his February 14, 2013, and January 18, 2018 OPM PSIs, and at his hearing, he said he
put some money on the counter, and then he took the sunglasses. (Tr. 51; GE 2 at 77,
85) The January 29, 2008 OPM PSI does not mention that he left money on the counter
for the sunglasses. (GE 2 at 67-68) The theft charge was dismissed after he completed
40 hours of community service. (Tr. 52; GE 2 at 67-68)
SOR ¶ 3.d alleges in February 2009, Applicant was charged with second degree
assault  of  his  spouse.  Applicant  was  upset because  his spouse  was mismanaging  the
family finances. (Tr. 52) Applicant took her phone from her and threw it against the wall.
(Tr. 52) When he took her phone, he grabbed her arm and left a red mark on her wrist.
(Tr. 53) She did not testify against Applicant, and the charge was dismissed. (Tr. 53)
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges in June 2012, Applicant was charged with operating a vehicle
while under the influence of alcohol (OWI). (Tr. 54-55) A police officer stopped him for
speeding and gave him a breath alcohol test (BAT) because they could smell tequila on
his breath. (Tr. 56) His BAT result exceeded .08. (Tr. 56) He pleaded guilty to this offense
and  received  five  years  of  probation  before  judgment,  and  he  completed  an  alcohol-
education  class.  (Tr.  57-58)  After  successful  completion  of  probation,  the  charge  was
dismissed. (Tr. 57) He was allowed to consume alcohol during probation. (Tr. 57-59)
SOR  ¶  3.e  alleges  in  January  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  on  a
suspended  license.  His  case  was  placed  on  the  Stet  docket.  He  explained  that  he
completed  all  requirements  for  reinstatement  of  his  driver’s  license,  and  the  state
erroneously failed to completely process and reinstate his driver’s license. (Tr. 59) The
charge was dismissed. (Tr. 59-60)
SOR ¶ 2.e alleges in June 2017, Applicant was charged with disorderly conduct.
He  was  subsequently  convicted  of  disturbing  the  peace/obstruct  public  area.  He  had
consumed  alcohol  prior  to  this  arrest.  Applicant  and  a  friend  were  wrestling  or
“roughhousing,”  and  Applicant  fell  and  cut  his  head  on  some  concrete.  (Tr.  60-61)
Applicant had consumed a beer before the wrestling occurred. (Tr. 60) Applicant and his
friend were taken to jail. (Tr. 61) Applicant said his conviction was equivalent to a traffic
infraction. (Tr. 62)
SOR ¶ 3.f alleges the same information that is in SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.e. Applicant
has not been charged with any offenses since June 2017, and he is not on probation. (Tr.
63) Applicant has not consumed sufficient alcohol to the extent to become intoxicated for
about two years. (Tr. 68-69) He ended his alcohol consumption almost one year ago. (Tr.

clarifications, as stated in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e, and 2.a. (Item 2.)
Applicant  has  been  involved  in  five  alcohol-related  incidents  since  March  2007,
including  multiple  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI)  arrests.  His  first  DUI  arrest  was  in
March 2007. He was convicted. In April 2011, Applicant was charged with DUI. He was
sentenced to 12 months of probation and 48 hours of community service. He completed
court-ordered  substance  abuse  treatment  and  counseling  as  part  of  his  sentence.
Despite his participation in that counseling program, he had a third DUI charge in July
2012.  He  was  sentenced  to  40  days  in  jail,  three  years  of  probation,  and  required  to

out of the three people involved, she drove the vehicle because she drank the least at the
festival, and that she has not consumed alcohol and driven since the 1995 arrest. She
also noted that her use of alcohol never affected her employment or personal life.
In  2007,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  operating  a  vehicle  under  the  influence  of
alcohol.  She  pleaded  guilty,  was  fined,  and  attended  a  weekend  intervention  program
where she was purportedly diagnosed as an alcohol abuser.2 She also attended follow-
up treatment at another facility, but no details of the treatment were provided.
In  2016,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  operating  a  vehicle  under  the  influence  of
alcohol after she lost control of her vehicle, left the road and hit a pole. The police report
noted that upon approaching Applicant in her car, she was so intoxicated she nearly fell
out of the car, could not perform roadside sobriety tests, could not stand on her own, and
was nearly carried to the police station. Her breathalyzer sample revealed a .334 blood
alcohol content (BAC). She was convicted and ordered to serve 33 days confinement (30
days  suspended),  fined,  placed  on  one-year  probation,  and  ordered  to  continue  an
alcohol treatment program already started. Details of the alcohol treatment program are
not available in the record.
In October 2017, Applicant was arrested for operating a vehicle under the influence
of alcohol following a traffic accident. Her attorney recommended she attend an alcohol
treatment program. She pleaded guilty and was ordered to be confined for 180 days (170
2 Applicant admitted the allegation, but the FORM does not contain documentation to support the diagnosis.
days suspended), home detention, supervised probation, fined, and ordered to undergo
a drug and alcohol evaluation. She was released from probation in April 2018. There is
no record of the results of the drug and alcohol evaluation.
Applicant provided a short, hand-written letter from her therapist, dated June 21,
2018. (AE A) The therapist noted that she was contacted after Applicant’s “second OVI.”3
She noted Applicant’s hard work in therapy on personal issues that led to alcohol abuse,
but did not expand on the issues involved,  type and extent of  treatment or therapy, or
diagnosis. The therapist stated that Applicant no longer drinks alcohol and has resolved
her personal issues satisfactorily. She stated that Applicant was doing extremely well in
her life, and was not a threat to national security.
Applicant noted the support of her employer and the Air Force, but did not provide
independent evidence of such support. She also noted her dedication to her work and
years of holding a security clearance without a security violation. She also stated that in
the 15 months preceding her 2017 arrest, she fell on “hard times” and life was extremely
difficult, but that she learned a valuable lesson, grew as a person, and changed her habits.
Since Applicant elected a decision without a hearing, I was unable to inquire further into
her alcohol treatment and evaluations, personal issues that led to alcohol related arrests,
and any changes in lifestyle.
Law and Policies
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued revised adjudicative guidelines
(AG) in a Security Executive Agent Directive, effective on June 8, 2017. These AGs are
applicable to this decision.
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
3 At the time Applicant sought counseling with this therapist, she had four alcohol related driving arrests.
Applicant’s therapist did not disclose whether she was aware of Applicant’s complete background of alcohol
related criminal history or prior treatment.
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption
",False
"Under Guideline G, the Government alleged that in August 2012, Applicant was
charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol (SOR 1.a); that in June 2016 he
again was charged with DUI, and that because he failed to comply with the terms of his
sentence, warrants for his arrest were issued in July 2016 and May 2017 (SOR 1.b); and
that in July 2017, he was arrested for DUI (SOR 1.c). In response, Applicant admitted,
with explanations, each of the allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established
by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  37  years  old.  Since  June  2015,  he  has  worked  in  an  information
technology position for a large defense contractor. Between September 2007 and June
2015, he held similar positions with several other companies in both the defense industry
and  the private  sector.  Applicant  served  in  the  U.S. Air  Force from  October  1999  until
being honorably discharged in September 2007. Applicant was married from March 2009
until divorcing his wife in June 2013. They have two children, ages 9 and 13, together.
Applicant has a bachelor’s degree in computer science and is working toward a master’s
degree in the same field. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 6)
Applicant first consumed alcohol at age 19 while stationed overseas with the Air
Force. At that time, he would drink socially at least once a week, consuming two or three
mixed  drinks  each  time.  After  returning  to  the  United  States  in  early  2002,  he  did  not
consume alcohol again until he turned 21 in 2003. His drinking then moderated, occurring
only about once or twice monthly. Applicant’s drink of choice was a mixed drink of whiskey
and a soft drink. He claims he has not consumed any alcohol since May 2017. He has
described  himself  as a  “problem drinker”  in response  to  a  questionnaire he  completed
during alcohol counseling in 2013. (GX 2; Tr. 34 – 36, 47 – 48, 59)
2 The adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016,
and made effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017.
3 GX 7 and GX 10 were admitted over Applicant’s objections. (Tr. 24 – 26, 28 – 29)
Applicant’s first arrest for DUI occurred on August 17, 2012. He had been out at a
club where he consumed at least five shots of alcohol. On the way home, his car hit a
curb and one of his tires went flat. As he was trying to change the tire, police arrived and
determined  that  he  was  intoxicated.  Applicant  testified  he  believed  a  blood  test  taken
when he was arrested revealed he had a .87 blood alcohol content (BAC). Applicant later
pleaded guilty to DUI and was sentenced to two years of probation, with leave to petition
for  early  release  from  probation  after  one  year  if  in  compliance  with  the  terms  of  his
probation, which began on June 18, 2013. Those terms included completion of 52 hours
of alcohol counseling and 48 hours of community service within 10 months of sentencing.
Applicant also was ordered to abstain from alcohol during probation. Applicant completed
his probation in June 2015. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 4; Tr. 36 – 40)
On June 25, 2016, Applicant was again arrested and charged with DUI. Applicant
claimed  he  had  been  at  a  friend’s  house  that  evening  and  had  two  beers,  which  he
normally would not drink and resulted in an upset stomach. He stated that as he drove
home, he had no cell service and became lost as he was unfamiliar with the area where
his friend lived. He decided to pull off the road and sleep in his vehicle until it became
light out and he could get his bearings. Police later arrived and woke him up. Applicant
averred that they smelled alcohol on his breath only because he had vomited earlier in
the evening. He also denied being intoxicated when police arrived, and he claimed the
police told him he had passed the field sobriety test they administered before arresting
him. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 40 – 43)
According to a police report about his arrest, police found Applicant asleep in his
vehicle in the middle of a private one-lane road. They had difficulty waking him up and
there was vomit on the driver’s side door. Applicant appeared disoriented and could not
provide cogent answers to their questions about his understanding of where he was or
how he wound up there. After Applicant refused a roadside sobriety test, he was placed
under arrest and transported to a police station where he was given a breathalyzer test.
The results of that test showed that, more than an hour after police took him into custody,
he had a BAC of .158. The record does not reflect what time he last consumed alcohol.
After  initially  pleading  not  guilty  to  DUI,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty.  On  January  5,  2017,
Applicant was sentenced to 10 days in jail (with credit for one day already served when
he  was  first  arrested)  to  be  served  by  February  17,  2017.  He  also  was  placed  on
supervised  probation  for  two  years,  was  assessed  $2,200  in  fines  and  court  costs,
ordered to complete a drug and alcohol evaluation, and complete any alcohol counseling
as  directed  in  his  drug  and  alcohol  evaluation,  and  complete  48  hours  of  community
service. Applicant was also ordered to abstain from alcohol during his term of probation.
(GX 4; GX 9)
Applicant’s probation requirements also included regular urinalysis testing. In May
2017, Applicant tested positive for alcohol. He claims that he advised his probation officer
the day after he consumed champagne while celebrating a recreational sports victory with
his  friends.  Further,  on  July  26,  2017,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI.
Applicant has denied consuming any alcohol that evening, and that he was acting as the
designated driver for two intoxicated friends who were in the car with him when he was
stopped for speeding. They and the driver of a second car traveling with Applicant’s were
out celebrating a birthday. According to the police reports of his arrest, Applicant failed a
field sobriety test and was taken into custody. After refusing a breathalyzer at the scene,
he was transported to a nearby hospital and blood was drawn over an hour after he was
arrested. That blood sample showed Applicant had a .091 BAC, which exceeded the legal
limit for alcohol. (Answer; GX 2; GX 7; Tr. 43)
Applicant was charged with DUI; however, on December 15, 2017, the charge was
dismissed. On the night of Applicant’s arrest, police also stopped the other car driven by
another friend with whom they had been out celebrating. That person also was suspected
of  DUI  but  had  a  lower  BAC.  A  prosecutor  mistakenly  based  his  decision  to  enter
Applicant’s  charge  as nolle  prosequi  on  the  other  driver’s  information.  Nonetheless,  in
July 2017, Applicant’s probation was revoked because he had consumed alcohol in May
2017, and because he had not yet completed the terms of his sentence for the June 2016
DUI conviction. Specifically, Applicant had not completed his jail sentence, and he had
not completed his alcohol counseling. Applicant was ordered to jail on July 7, 2017. After
his release from jail, Applicant was returned to probation; however, in September 2017,
another  probation  revocation  hearing  was  held  because  he  had  not  yet  completed
required counseling and pending the outcome of his July 2017 charges, which occurred
in a different jurisdiction. Applicant was returned to probation on March 8, 2018. At his
hearing  in  this  matter,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  has  yet  to  complete  court-ordered
alcohol counseling and will remain on probation until he does so. (Answer; GX 2; GX 7;
GX 10; Tr. 44 – 52, 56)
",False
"In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a and 3.b. He denied the
remaining SOR allegations.  Applicant  is 63 years old.  He married in  1978,  divorced  in
2006, remarried in 2010, and divorced in 2012. He has three adult children. Two serve
in the U.S. military and the third is a state trooper. (Response to the SOR; Tr. at 8, 49-
51, 57, 63, 67, 83-85, 158-160; GE 1, 2, 3, 4).
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  the  U.S.  Military  Academy  at  West
Point  (West  Point)  in  1978  and  two  master’s  degrees,  in  1985  and  1991.  He  was
commissioned  as  an  infantry  officer  and  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1978  to  1985,
when he was honorably discharged. He has since worked for various DOD contractors.
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  worked  as  a  consultant  for  a  DOD  contractor  since
October 2018. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 1974. (Tr. at 5-6, 51-
57, 158-160; GE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A).
In  1998,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence
(DUI)  (SOR  1.a,  3.a).  This  was  his  first  and  only  alcohol-related  incident.  He  was
separated from his first wife. He was at a restaurant with coworkers and he consumed
six  12-  to  16-ounce  beers  over  the  course  of  approximately  four  hours.  He  felt
intoxicated.  He  wrecked  his  car  as  he  drove  home,  after  overcorrecting  in  an  effort  to
avoid a deer. The police took him into custody and cited him for DUI. He was sentenced
to probation before judgment; his driver’s license was suspended for approximately 90
days; he was fined; and he was ordered to make a donation to Mothers Against Drunk
Driving. (Tr. at 62-66; GE 2, 3; AE D).
Applicant  has  not  had  any  subsequent  alcohol-related  arrests  or  charges.  He
denied consuming alcohol to the point of intoxication and driving under the influence of
alcohol  and  while  intoxicated  on  numerous  occasions  between  2005  and  2015  (SOR
1.b,  1.c,  3.a).  He  denied  the  following  information  reflected  in  a  May  2015  report  of
polygraph  examination  that:  (1)  he  stopped  consuming  alcohol  after  his  2010  heart
attack;  (2)  from  November  2013  to  November  2014,  he  consumed  four  vodka  tonics,
totaling one pint of vodka, over the course of an evening four to five nights weekly, and
he drank until he felt intoxicated and then fell asleep three to four nights weekly; (3) he
had most recently  operated a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in February 2014,
after attending a poker game with friends and consuming three to four two-ounce shots
of bourbon over a four-hour period, and he would have likely been cited with DUI if he
had  been  stopped  by  police  on  this  occasion;  (4)  his  girlfriend  in  November  2014
expressed concern about the amount of his alcohol consumption; and (5) in his lifetime,
he had driven “a few dozen times” while feeling intoxicated but was undetected. (Tr. at
66-70, 112-124, 160; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant testified that he was either misinterpreted or he misspoke in May 2015.
He testified that he continued to consume red wine in moderation after his heart attack.
He acknowledged potentially consuming a pint of vodka over the course of a week from
November 2013 to November 2014; he could not explain how he may have misspoken
about  drinking  until  he  felt  intoxicated  then  falling  asleep  three  to  four  nights  weekly
during that period. He testified that his reference to the February 2014 occurrence was
to a friend in the poker group who had consumed bourbon and “was slurring his words”
when  the  friend  telephoned  him  to  notify  him  of  a  roadside  sobriety  checkpoint.  He
testified that he meant to state that he typically consumed a few drinks of red wine over
the course of approximately six hours at periodic poker games with friends. He testified
that his girlfriend did not express concern over the amount of his alcohol consumption in
November 2014. (Tr. at 66-70, 112-124, 160; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant acknowledged that as a single man, from approximately 2006 to 2010
and since 2012, he has belonged to a social activities group for adults whose principal
event  consisted  of  weekly  beach  volleyball,  where  he  would  consume  a  beer  or  two
over  the  course  of  a  three-  to  four-hour  evening  game  before  driving  home.  From
January to June 2015, he testified that he consumed around three to four vodka tonics
or  red  wine  nightly  to  treat  his  hip  pain,  as  further  discussed  below,  but  he  did  not
consider himself intoxicated on these occasions. Since his hip surgery in June 2015, he
testified  that  he  consumes  two  drinks  a  night,  two  nights  a  week.  From  mid-2015  to
February  2017,  he  testified  that  he  consumed  a  drink  or  two  socially  with  friends.  He
testified  that  he  was  careful  not  to  consume  alcohol  when  he  took  Oxycodone,  as
further discussed below, because doing so “is an instant prescription for falling asleep”
and “you’re a danger to everybody” if you drink, take Oxycodone, and drive. (Tr. at 66-
70, 112-124, 135-140, 160; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant denied that he knowingly circumvented appropriate methods to obtain
his  prescription  heart  medication,  Crestor,  twice--in  2013  and  in  2014  (SOR  3.c).
Though he had health insurance, his deductible was $700, which he could not afford on
his limited income as a consultant at the time. He testified that he informed his doctor of
such  to  no  avail.  He  testified  that  he  discussed  his  situation  with  his  sister  and  she
offered to send him her Crestor pills. On both occasions, she sent him a 30-day supply.
He believed she had a prescription for Crestor, but he could not recall whether she, in
fact,  did  or  if  she  obtained  a  prescription  for  him.  He  testified  that  she  paid  a  nominal
amount, sent him her medication, and he sent her a check for $65 to $75. He testified
that he did not think it was a big deal at the time. He does not anticipate this becoming a
problem in the future since the generic Crestor is now more affordable and he would be
eligible  to  qualify  for  Medicare.  He  also  testified  that  he  would  utilize  other
methodologies, such as declare himself indigent, go to the emergency room, or obtain
doctor  samples,  if  necessary.  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to  not  use  any  illegal
substance or abuse prescription drugs in the future, and that violation would result in the
revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 85-90, 143-147, 174-175; GE 2; AE E).
Applicant  denied  using  marijuana  in  December  2014,  and  he  denied  that  this
alleged  use  of  marijuana  occurred  after  he  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in
September  2005  (SOR  2.a,  2.d,  3.a).  A  December  2015  report  of  polygraph
examination reflects:
During pretest interview, [Applicant] reported that in December 2014, while
tailgating  at  the  Army  vs.  Navy  football  game  at  M&T  Bank  Stadium  in
Baltimore, MD, [Applicant] smoked marijuana. [Applicant] took a “hit” off of
a  marijuana  joint  that  [Applicant’s]  friend  passed  around.  [Applicant]  did
not purchase the marijuana or contribute money towards the purchase of
the marijuana. [Applicant] was aware of the policy regarding no illegal drug
involvement while holding a security clearance, but at the time, [Applicant]
thought “why not?” [Applicant] initially did not report this incident during his
previous  polygraph  on  06  May  2015  because  he  was  embarrassed  and
believed it was a one[-]time event.
Applicant  denied  that  the  marijuana  was  passed  around,  testifying  that  it  was  just
passed to him from his friend. He testified that he could not recall using the word “hit,”
but  stated  “I  think  I  used  the  word  drag.  .  .  .”  (Tr.  at  70-73,  81-83,  109-110,  125-132,
147-155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant also denied saying that he did not report his December 2014 marijuana
use during his May 2015 interview with the AGA (SOR 3.f) due to “embarrassment.” He
testified, “I can’t imagine that because I’m sure it came up . . . .” Rather, he testified that
he did not disclose it in May 2015 because he did not consider it a “use” of marijuana,
and he chose to volunteer the incident in December 2015. He continued:
Certainly  not  because  of any  embarrassment,  although  I  will freely  admit
that it was not my finest hour. But I do believe that it was, in fact, a one-
time event – and it was actually a one-time non-event.
He  denied  saying  that  he  chose  to  disregard  the  policy  against  illegal  drug  use  while
holding a clearance. He testified, “I would never say something like ‘why not.’ That’s just
not  in  my  DNA  to  even  respond  to  him.”  (Tr.  at  70-73,  81-83,  109-110,  125-132,  147-
155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant described the December 2014 marijuana incident as follows: he and a
group  of  40  other  individuals,  to  include  some  of  his  West  Point  classmates,  took  a
three- to four-hour bus ride to a football game. His hips “stiffened up quite dramatically”
during the ride, but they were not “horrible, they were just stiff and very uncomfortable.”
While tailgating, his friend, who had a medical marijuana card, offered him marijuana to
provide relief for his hips. He “stupidly . . . went to try it” and concurrently with doing so,
thought it was a bad idea. He testified:
I  pulled  the  smoke  into  my  mouth  and  .  .  .  it  was  just  so  incredibly
disgusting that I spit it out and had to rinse my mouth out, it was absolutely
off-the-chart disgusting . . . .
He  acknowledged  that  he  took  a  “puff”  of  the  marijuana  cigarette,  but  insisted  that  he
did not inhale or ingest it, he did not experience any effect from it, and he did not believe
it  rose  to  the  level  of  “use.”  He  testified  that  he  “ran  up  to  the  line  and  leaned  over  it,
perhaps, but . . . I do not think I crossed that line.” He signed a statement of intent to not
use  any  illegal  substance  or  abuse  prescription  drugs  in  the  future,  and  that  violation
would result in the revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132,
147-155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D, E).
Applicant  denied misusing  the  prescription medication  Xanax  in  February  2015.
He  also  denied  misusing  the  prescription  medication  Xanax  after  he  was  granted  a
security  clearance  in  September  2005  (SOR  2.b,  2.d,  3.a).  He  testified  that  he  went
through  a  “manic  depressive”  period  during  the  military  deployments  of  two  of  his
children, the first deployment of which occurred in 2004. He described himself as:
I couldn’t relax. I . . . would stand up and then just start pacing. And, or I
was just like, I wouldn’t say lethargic, but . . . I found just found it hard to
care about things. . . . I was crazed. . . . I was freaked out.
He testified that in February 2015, his then live-in girlfriend suggested that he take one
of her prescription Xanax. He testified that he used one quarter of one pill. Within three
or  four  days,  he  testified  that  he  had  an  appointment  with  his  primary  care  physician,
who  prescribed  him  Xanax.  Though  he  felt  the  angst  related  to  his  children’s
deployments for a number of years prior to 2015, he had not previously been prescribed
Xanax. He used his prescribed Xanax for approximately three weeks and “it settled me.”
(Tr. at 51, 73-77, 79-83, 110-111, 132-135, 147-155, 162-171; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant testified that he did not believe he misused his then girlfriend’s Xanax
because he “used it in the manner that it was supposed to be used,” and he obtained a
prescription of his own shortly after. He testified that it did not occur to him that such use
was  illegal,  though  in  hindsight  he  saw  that  it  was.  He  testified  that  in  the  future,  he
would  go  to  the  emergency  room  rather  than  use  another  individual’s  prescription.  He
signed a statement of intent to not use any illegal substance or abuse prescription drugs
in the future, and that violation would result in the revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 51,
73-77, 79-83, 110-111, 132-135, 147-155, 162-171; AE E).
Applicant  denied  misusing  the  prescription  medication  Oxycodone  in  December
2015.  He  also  denied  misusing  the  prescription  medication  Oxycodone  after  he  was
granted  a  security  clearance  in  September  2005  (SOR  2.c,  2.d,  3.a).  He  cited  to  a
series of health problems that started when he experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in
June  2010.  In  December  2010,  he  then  had  a  quintuple  bypass  surgery,  and  his
recovery period lasted for approximately one year. In January 2015, he was diagnosed
with  degenerative  problems  in  both  of  his  hips,  requiring  bilateral  hip  replacement
surgery.  He  underwent  the  first  of  two  surgeries  in  June  2015,  and  the  second  in  late
2015. He required an assistive walker, crutches, or a cane to walk, through March 2017.
(Tr. at 57-62, 77-83, 110-111, 135-142, 162-167; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant was first prescribed Oxycodone by his doctor after his first hip surgery
in  June  2015.  He  took  Oxycodone  daily,  as  prescribed,  from  June  2015  through
February  2017.  As  discussed  above,  though  he  consumed  an  alcoholic  drink  socially
from mid-2015 to February 2017, he testified that he did not do so on the days he took
Oxycodone. He testified, “[y]ou’d have good days and you’d have bad days . . . the pain
was, sometimes, absolutely extraordinary and, sometimes, it was not bad.”  He testified
that his prescription for Oxycodone varied:
Sometimes they would be for . . . ten 325s, sometimes for 20 325s. And,
and  when  I  say  20,  it’s  20  milligrams  of  oxycodone,  combined  with  325
milligrams of Motrin. Or, sometimes, 2,500 of Motrin and, sometimes, just
like 20 milligrams of oxycodone with no Motrin. So it was all, it was, kind
of, a mixed bag and it, you know, it was, you never knew what you were
going to get.
He never had more than a month’s supply at a given time, so he had to obtain a refill at
least  monthly.  To  do  so,  he  had  to  go  through  his  doctor’s  assistant,  a  nurse
practitioner,  to  obtain  a  signed  prescription.  (Tr.  at  57-62,  77-83,  110-111,  135-142,
162-167; GE 2; AE D).
In December 2015, Applicant was in severe pain. He testified that he was unable
to  obtain  a  refill  for  his  then  existing  Oxycodone  prescription  because  the  nurse
practitioner  was  on  vacation,  and  neither  his  doctor  nor any  of  the  administrative  staff
returned his calls. His sister, who resided in a different state, offered to overnight him a
bottle  of  her prescription  Oxycodone,  consisting  of  “twenty  pills  of  each  pill having  ten
milligrams of oxycodone and 325 milligrams of Motrin . . . .” He testified that “it got me
over the hump. It was a gap fill, until such time, as I could get another . . . refill,” which
occurred  approximately  less  than  a  week  later.  (Tr.  at  77-83,  110-111,  123-125,  135-
142, 144, 162-167; GE 2; AE D).
As with Applicant’s use of his then girlfriend’s Xanax in 2015, he testified that he
did  not  believe  his  use  of  his  sister’s  prescription  Oxycodone  constituted  misuse.  He
stated:
[Y]ou  could  say  that  my  .  .  .  method  of  acquisition  might  not  have  been
exactly  right,  and  I,  probably  could’ve  done  that  better,  but  in  the  grand
scheme of things, I was using it for the purpose that it was intended.
(Tr. at 77-83, 110-111, 123-125, 135-142, 144, 162-167; AE D, E).
Applicant testified that he did not realize then that he was doing anything wrong.
He  testified  that  he  has  since  learned  that  he  is  not  to  use  another  individual’s
prescription, and that in the future, he would go to the emergency room to obtain a new
prescription. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant testified that  the only medications
he  was  taking  were  for  blood  pressure,  cholesterol,  and  blood  thinner.  He  signed  a
statement  of  intent  to not  use  any  illegal substance  or abuse prescription  drugs  in  the
future,  and  that  violation  would  result  in  the  revocation  of  his  clearance.  (Tr.  at  77-83,
110-111, 123-125, 135-142, 144, 162-167; AE D, E).
Applicant  maintained  that  at  the  time  of  the  marijuana  incident  in  December
2014, his use of his then girlfriend’s Xanax in February 2015, and his use of his sister’s
Oxycodone in December 2015, he was eligible for a security clearance but he did not, in
fact, have one. He testified that he understood that his clearance was inactive because
he had been previously read off all classified programs and was not read back on until
around  2016.  When  confronted  with  the  AGA’s  October  2016  clearance  decision
statement,  which  reflects  that  he  had  “been  in  SCI  access”  with  the  AGA  since
September 2005, and he was granted eligibility for access to SCI by the U.S. military in
December 2010, he responded that any information reflecting that he was in continuous
access  was  “news  to  me.”  He  also  testified  that  his  interviews  became  “somewhat
contentious,”  and  he  did  not  have  an  opportunity  to  appeal  the  eventual  unfavorable
2016 AGA decision because he did not receive the appeal documents in the mail before
the  appeal  period  lapsed.  (Tr.  at  70-73,  81-83,  109-110,  125-132,  147-155,  160-162,
167-177; GE 1, 2).
Two of Applicant’s character witnesses, as further discussed below, testified that
they believed Applicant had a security clearance in December 2014. One witness was
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  October  2018  to  the  date  of  the  hearing.  This  witness
testified that he assisted Applicant with obtaining employment in October 2014 with the
DOD  contractor  for  whom  Applicant  worked  until  October  2018,  and  he  believed
Applicant’s work there required a clearance from its inception. A second witness worked
for  the  same  employer  as  Applicant  in  2014,  but  in  a  different  sector.  This  witness
testified  that  he  was  told  that  Applicant  had  “a  Top  Secret  SCI  clearance  and  he  was
over  in  the  cyber-division  for  two  years  --  2014  and  2015  --  as  a  senior  capture
manager.” (Tr. at 178-204; AE A, C).
Since Applicant did not believe he used marijuana in 2014 or misused Xanax in
2015,  he  testified  that  he  did  not  falsify  his  responses  to  sections  23a  and  23b  of  his
March  2015  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  or  section  23  of  his November 2015
SCA (SOR 3.d, 3.e, 3.g, 3.h, 3.i). He testified that he did not falsify information during a
May  2015  interview  with  the  AGA,  when  he  failed  to  disclose  his  2014  marijuana  use
(SOR  3.f).  He  also  testified  that  he  did  not  falsify  his  response  to  section  23  of  his
August  2017  SCA  since  he  did  not  believe  his  misused  either  Xanax  or  Oxycodone
(SOR 3.k). Sections 23a and 23b of his March 2015 SCA  inquired, respectively, about
the illegal use of controlled substances, to include prescription drugs, in the seven years
prior  to  the  date  of  the  SCA,  and  any  illegal  use  of  a  controlled  substance  while
possessing a security clearance. Section 23 of his November 2015 SCA inquired about
illegal drug use or drug activity, to include the intentional misuse of prescription drugs, in
the seven years prior to the date of the SCA, and any illegal use or other involvement
with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. Section 23 of
his August 2017 SCA inquired about the intentional misuse of prescription drugs in the
seven  years prior to  the  date  of  the SCA.     (Tr. at  90-99, 108-111,  147-155.  167-171;
GE 1, 2, 3).
Applicant,  however,  listed  his  December  2014  marijuana  use  in  response  to
section 23 of his August 2017 SCA, which inquired whether he had illegally used a drug
or  controlled  substance  in  the  seven  years  prior  to  the  date  of  the  SCA.  He  marked
“Yes,” listed “THC (Such as marijuana, weed, pot, hashish, etc.)” and explained:
I was at a tailgate for the Army-Navy Game on Dec 13th, 2014 and with a
bunch  of  friends  in  the  parking  lot;  a  friend  was  smoking  a  joint  and
passed it to me. I took one puff. This was the only instance. . . . One puff,
one time. I am completely at a loss to explain why.
When asked whether he intended or not to use marijuana in the future, he noted, “No,
this  was  a  stupid,  mindless  aberration.”  He  provided  no  commentary  that  he  did  not
inhale or ingest the marijuana, that he did not experience any effect from it, or that he
did not believe it rose to the level of “use.” (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132, 147-
155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 1, 2).
Applicant  denied  that  he  stated  during  an  interview  with  the  AGA  in  December
2015  that  he  intended  to  violate  a  state’s handgun  registration  laws  by  not  registering
his handguns, as required. He testified that he intended to state that he simply had not
gotten around to doing so. He testified that he prioritized his work and health issues at
the time, but he had no intent to keep unregistered guns. He testified that he complied
with the registration laws in November 2016 and registered his one handgun, as he had
given his second one to his son who is a state trooper. (SOR 3.j). (Tr. at 101-108, 155-
158; GE 2)
In August 2009, Applicant paid a prostitute for sex. He testified that this was the
only  instance  he  did  so.  He  was  single.  His  friend  suggested  it  after  Applicant  was
lamenting  about  his  dating  life.  He  testified  that  he  was  stupid  and  unaware  of  the
ramifications  of  his actions,  though  he  knew  his  conduct  was  illegal.  He  has  no  future
intentions of repeating such conduct. (SOR 3.b). (Tr. at 83-85, 142-143; GE 2).
Applicant’s witnesses described him as generous, trustworthy, reliable, and loyal.
They each testified that they reviewed the SOR. Two witnesses referred to Applicant as
a lifelong friend, having known him since their simultaneous attendance at West Point in
the 1970s. Both indicated that they have seen Applicant at least once monthly over the
past  10  years.  One  indicated  that  he  was  surprised  about  the  accuracy  of  the  SOR,
given  his  interactions  with  Applicant.  The  other  indicated  that  he  had  never  observed
Applicant consume alcohol to excess, use marijuana, or misuse prescription drugs. This
witness  testified  that  he  was  unaware  of  Applicant’s  1998  DUI  and  alleged  2014
marijuana use until he saw the SOR, and that he organized the group of 40 to 50 people
that  attended  the  football  game  in  December  2014,  where  Applicant  allegedly  used
marijuana.  This  witness  testified  that  he  held  a  security  clearance  his  entire  adult  life,
and  he  knew  that  illegal  drug  use  and  the  misuse  of  prescription  drugs  was  not
permitted while holding a clearance. If the SOR allegations were proven to be accurate,
he believed they were situational and not reflective of Applicant’s overall character. (Tr.
at 25-48, 178-204; AE B, C).
The  third  witness,  as  previously  discussed,  consisted  of  the  individual who  was
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  October  2018  to  the  date  of  the  hearing.  The  witness
referred to Applicant as his best friend, having known him since 1996. Applicant has, at
various  times  since  2006,  worked  for  this  witness.  In  addition  to  testifying  that
Applicant’s position with the employer for whom Applicant worked from October 2014 to
October  2018  required  a  clearance  from  its  inception,  the  witness  also  testified  that
Applicant’s  position  in  2013  when  Applicant  worked  for  the  witness  as  a  consultant
required  a  clearance.  He  described  Applicant’s  work  performance  as  impeccable.  He
testified that he socialized with Applicant at monthly poker games,  where he observed
Applicant consume alcohol responsibly. He indicated that he did not observe Applicant
misuse prescription drugs or use illegal substances. (Tr. at 178-193; AE A, C).
The fourth witness also referred to Applicant as a lifelong friend, having first met
him  when  they  were  coworkers  from  1997  through  2006.  From  2006  to  2014,  the
witness and Applicant kept in touch through an occasional email. In 2014, as previously
discussed, when Applicant and the witness once again worked for the same employer
but  in  different  sectors,  the  witness  testified  that  he  was  told  that  Applicant  had  a
clearance  in  2014  and  2015.  The  witness  then  served  as  Applicant’s  supervisor  from
2016  to  2018.  He  stated  that  Applicant’s  performance  was  exceptional.  He  described
Applicant as a responsible drinker. He indicated that he was unaware that Applicant had
allegedly  used  any  illegal  substance  until  he  reviewed  the  SOR.  He  testified  that
Applicant told him that he took “a puff of marijuana, but was sickened by it immediately,
and blew it out” in December 2014 at a football game. (Tr. at 193-204; AE C).
",True
"Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2015.  He  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance.  He  has  a
bachelor’s degree, which was awarded in 2003. He has never married, and he has no
children.1
Applicant was involved in several alcohol-related criminal incidents. He was cited
in 1998 for minor in possession of alcohol. He was 18 years old at the time. He pleaded
guilty and paid a fine. Applicant testified that he was at a party when the police arrived.
He stated that he was not drinking, but there was alcohol at the party. He pleaded guilty
because his parents told him to accept responsibility.2
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2008  and  charged  with  driving  while  impaired  by
alcohol (DWI). He pleaded guilty and received probation before judgment for one year
and a $500 fine. The charge was dismissed after he successfully completed the terms
of his probation.3
Applicant testified that he had two beers with dinner over the course of about two
to three hours. He thought that he was fine to drive. He stated that he did well on the
field sobriety test, but there was a malfunction with the breathalyzer, so there were no
blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  results.  He  followed  his  attorney’s  advice  and
accepted  the  guilty  plea  and  probation  before  judgment  with  the  knowledge  that  the
charge would be dismissed if he completed the terms of the probation.4
Applicant  submitted  Questionnaires  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
2009  and  2014.  He  reported  the  above  two  incidents  in  both  SF  86s.  He  wrote  that  a
DUI “will not happen again.”5
Applicant was arrested in May 2017 and charged with driving under the influence
of alcohol (DUI). In November 2017, he pleaded guilty to DWI, and the DUI charge was
dismissed. He was sentenced to 60 days in the county detention center, with all 60 days
suspended,  and  supervised  probation  for  18  months.  As  part  of  his  probation,  he  was
ordered  to  attend  a  victim  impact  panel.  His  state  required  him  to  install  an  interlock
system on his car’s ignition for one year, which he successfully completed without any
violations. He will remain on probation until May 2019.6

Applicant testified that he went to dinner with a friend, and he had two large shots
of tequila over the course of a long evening. He again felt that he was fine to drive. He
was stopped after making a right turn while at a red light. He stated that he did not see
that there was a no turn on red sign. He believes he passed the field sobriety test, but
he  refused  to  take  a  breathalyzer.  He  testified  that  he  had  friends  who  were  lawyers
who  advised  him  that  if  he  was  ever  stopped  by  the  police,  he  should  refuse  the
breathalyzer.7
Applicant  attended  and  completed  alcohol  counseling  from  June  2017  to
November  2017.  He  completed  26  sessions,  which  included  group  and  individual
sessions.  His  counselor,  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker  (LCSW),  reported  that
Applicant  showed  marked  improvement  throughout  the  course  of  treatment,  and  that
Applicant “showed sincere remorse and shame about the fact that he did not learn from
his first offense which led to his second arrest.8 The LCSW concluded:
As  with  any  human  behavior,  no  one  person  has  a  crystal  ball.  The  best
we can do is look for sustained improvement in behavior and judgment. It
is  in  my  professional  opinion  that  [Applicant]  not  only  successfully
completed  treatment  but  went  on  to  demonstrate  to  me  that  he  has
learned from his mistakes and genuinely expresses sincere motivation to
continue in his commitment to sobriety.9
Applicant informed his supervisor at work that he was arrested for DUI. Applicant
testified that he benefited greatly from the counseling. He decided to completely abstain
from  alcohol.  He  has  not  had  a  drink  since  January  2018.  He  assures  that  he  has
learned from his mistakes, and the conduct will not be repeated.10
Applicant is highly regarded, as reported by three witnesses. He is praised for his
excellent job performance, trustworthiness, responsibility, work ethic, and integrity. The
witnesses recommended that he retain his security clearance11
",False
"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with some comments, nearly all of
the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.g.), drug
involvement and substance misuse (SOR ¶¶ 2.a., 2.b., and 2.d.); and personal conduct
(SOR ¶¶ 3.b. and 3.c.). He either denied or failed to address the remaining allegations.
Applicant’s admissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein as findings
of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
in  an  unspecified  position  with  his  current  employer  since  August  2015.  A  2013  high
school graduate, he earned some college credits, but no degree. He has never served
with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant has never been
married, and he has no children.
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant commenced drinking alcohol out of curiosity in 2006, when he was about
12 years old, and he continued doing so until 2008.  He generally stole a beer from his
father’s refrigerator two to three times per year. Starting in 2008, his consumption steadily
increased,  and  he  went  from  two  beers  every  three  months,  to  five  of  six  beers  every
three  months,  to  eight  to  ten  beers  every  two  weeks.  By  August  2013,  Applicant  was
consuming 15 to 30 beers on weekends at college. From May 2014 until January 2016,
he  drank  10  to  20  beers on  weekends.  In  January  2016,  he  was  drinking  on  a  nightly
basis, and on least one occasion, he consumed a 30-pack of beer over a two-day period.
(Item 4, at 123) His early curiosity about alcohol transitioned into believing that drinking
was “cool” and fun. He also enjoyed being “buzzed” or drunk. On at least six or seven
occasions, Applicant’s drinking resulted in his intoxication, and caused him to black out.
(Item 3, at 12-13) Applicant acknowledged that he would “get the shakes [and] need a
drink.” (Item 4, at 8)
On October 20, 2016, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant acknowledged that his use of alcohol
occurred only on the weekends. Because he became calm when intoxicated, he drank
seven to eight beers to intoxication about once every month. He denied having a problem
with drinking, and he expressed an intention not to stop doing so. (Item 3, at 6)
Applicant’s  relationship  with  alcohol  has  resulted  in  several  incidents  involving
either injury to himself or being charged with various violations. In January 2015, he was
observed  by  the  police  holding  a  beer  in  the  back  seat  of  a  vehicle.  He  was  issued  a
summons for possession of alcohol by minor. After pleading guilty to the charge, Applicant
was ordered to attend an eight-hour alcohol class sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk
Driving  (MADD).  Less  than  five  months  later,  he  was  again  issued  a  summons  for
possession of alcohol by minor when he was observed walking on a college campus with
a beer in his hand. After pleading guilty to the charge, he was ordered to complete eight
hours  of  community  service.  (Item  3,  at  5-6)  In  the  spring  of  2015  or  2016,  while  at  a
casino, Applicant became intoxicated, blacked out, got thrown over a blackjack table, and
he was transported to the hospital emergency room. (Item 4, at 7, 11, 53; Item 1)
In January 2016, Applicant consumed 10 to 12 beers and 3 to 4 shots of liquor
within a two-to-five-hour period at a house party. The following morning, he consumed
additional liquor. He then drove his vehicle, not caring that he was under the influence of
alcohol. He either ran a stop-sign and struck a moving vehicle, or he rear-ended a stopped
vehicle, depending on which version of the incident Applicant reported. When the police
arrived, they administered Applicant a field sobriety test, which he failed. He was arrested
and charged with driving under the influence (DUI). He was administered two breathalyzer
tests, both of which registered high percentages: 0.17 percent and 0.21 percent. (Item 3,
at 6, 12) He entered a plea of guilty to the DUI. Applicant was ordered to attend another
MADD program; directed to obtain alcohol treatment; required to have an ignition interlock
device installed on his vehicle for six months; and his operator’s license was suspended
for 60 or 90 days. (Item 3, at 6, 12)
Applicant acknowledged that his 2016 DUI was the result of an “irresponsible and
reckless mistake.” In his Answer to the SOR, He added: “I regard the situation though
unfortunate, as a catalyst to the curbing of my behavior in a much more responsible light.”
(Item 1)
Nevertheless, between July 2016 and October 2016, Applicant operated a vehicle
on five or ten occasions while he was under the influence of alcohol. He did so because
he thought he could manage driving, he was not traveling too far, or he did not care that
he  was  under  the  influence.  (Item  3,  at  13)  In  July  or  August  2016,  while  under  the
influence of alcohol, Applicant fell off a roof, and he was hospitalized for stitches on his
face and hand. (Item 4, at 7, 11; Item 1) On at least one occasion, after drinking in the
morning, he waited until the afternoon before trying to drive. That effort resulted in the
ignition interlock device recognizing that Applicant had consumed alcohol, and he failed
to unlock it. (Item 4, at 123; Item 1)
On October 14, 2016, Applicant enrolled in the intensive outpatient program of a
substance  abuse  treatment  program.  During  his  intake  assessment,  he  acknowledged
that his initial use of alcohol occurred when he was 10 years old, that regular use occurred
at the age of 19, and that over the six-month period preceding the assessment, he had
been drinking up to two beers per day, with binge drinking on the weekends. (Item 4, at
5)  He  underwent  individual  and  group  therapy.  During  the  program,  Applicant  was
diagnosed  under  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fifth  Ed.
(DSM-V), with Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe. (Item 4, at 19, 123)
Despite his participation in the program, Applicant admitted continuing his reduced
consumption of alcohol on several occasions in October and December 2016. (Item 4, at
49-50, 55) On December 19, 2016, the intensive outpatient treatment program ceased,
and Applicant was recommended to continue his goal of reduced alcohol intake, and to
continue ongoing substance abuse treatment on a weekly basis for individual therapy and
group therapy for additional support. He was prescribed naltrexone – a medication used
to  treat  alcoholism  by  reducing  the  urge  to  drink  alcohol  –  as  needed.  (Item  4,  at  46)
Applicant denied the SOR allegation and he contends that he completed the program to
its completion, and the Government offered no evidence that Applicant had failed to follow
treatment  advice.  As  recently  as  June  2018,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  continued  to
consume two to four drinks per weekend or less. (Item 3, at 16)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant was also a recreational substance abuser whose primary substances of
choice were marijuana, cocaine, and amphetamines. In addition, although not alleged in
the SOR, Applicant admitted that he was a frequent user of unspecified hallucinogens.
(Item 4, at 6, 41) As noted above, on October 14, 2016, Applicant enrolled in the intensive
outpatient program. During his intake assessment, in addition to the information furnished
regarding  alcohol,  he  acknowledged
in
approximately  2004,  when  he  was  15  years  old,  and  continued  his  regular  use  of
marijuana until September 2016. He used cocaine on various occasions from at least an
unspecified date in 2015 until at least October 2016. (Item 4, at 5-6; Item 1)
that  he  commenced  using  marijuana
Despite  his  participation  in  the  program,  Applicant’s  urine  toxicology  screens
tested positive for cocaine on several occasions: October 24, 2016; October 25, 2016;
October 28, 2016; October 31, 2016; and November 1, 2016, and he admitted continuing
his use of cocaine. (Item 4, at 55, 142-146) In addition, Applicant’s urine toxicology screen
tested positive for amphetamines on December 16, 2016. (Item 4, at 127; Item 1)
In his response to the interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged the use of Adderall
–  a  combination  medication  containing  four  salts  of  amphetamine  –  which  was  also  a
prescribed medication for someone other than himself, in February 2017. (Item 3, at 17)
That  acknowledgement  was  apparently  the  basis  of  the  SOR  allegation  that  he  had
misused Adderall. However, in his Answer to the SOR, Applicant clarified his response
and claimed that he had made a mistake because of confusion on his part. He contended
that the Adderall misuse was actually the same December 2016 incident reported as a
result of his positive urine toxicology screen tested positive for amphetamines. During the
program,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  under  the  DSM-V  with  Cocaine  Use  Disorder,  a
diagnosis  he  denied  being  aware  of.  (Item  4,  at  120,  123;  Item  1)  Starting  in  January
2019, and continuing until March 2019, Applicant underwent drug screens ordered by a
physician. All of the toxicology screens were negative. (Item 1 attachments)
Personal Conduct
On April 22, 2015, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to certain
questions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23 – Illegal
Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. The most significant question, and the one alleged in the
SOR, was essentially as follows: In the last seven (7) years: “have you illegally used any
drugs or controlled substances?” Applicant answered “no” to the question. (Item 2, at 24)
He omitted and concealed his subsequently admitted use of marijuana. He certified that
his  response  to  that  question  was  “true,  complete,  and  correct”  to  the  best  of  his
knowledge and belief, but, because of his omission and concealment, the response to
that question was, in fact, false. Applicant admitted the allegation. (Item 1) With respect
to the cocaine aspect of the question, the Government failed to prove that Applicant had
used cocaine at any time before he submitted the SF 86 in April 2015, and Applicant only
admitted that he had used it in 2015 and 2016.
On June 20, 2018, when Applicant completed his responses to the interrogatories,
he responded to a question pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in
Question 1 – Drug Use. He was asked to provide a complete history of his use of any
illegal narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), Cannabis
(marijuana or Hashish), prescription drug without a valid prescription, and any misuse of
a drug prescribed to you (e.g., taking more than the required dosage, etc.). Although he
acknowledged  his  misuse  of  Adderall,  he  omitted  and  concealed  his  subsequently
admitted use of marijuana and cocaine. He swore that his response to those that question
was  “true  and  correct”  to  the  best  of  his  knowledge  and  belief,  but,  because  of  his
omissions and concealments, the response to that question was, in fact, false. Applicant
admitted the allegation, and added that “the deliberate withholding of information I now
realize  was  unbecoming  and  illustrates  untrustworthiness.  I  believe  at  the  time  I  was
nervous  and  admittedly  frightened  of  the  consequences  for  disclosing  that  type  of
information.” (Item 1)

"Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  video-conference  technician  who  has  been  in  that
position working for the same employer for over five years. He is a high school graduate
who  was  enrolled  in  community  college  from  2004  to  2006,  until  his  education  was
interrupted  by  a  debilitating  accident.  Applicant  has,  however,  pursued  and  received
multiple post-secondary certifications. He is single and has no children. He applied for a
security clearance in 2016. The results of the subsequent investigation led to the SOR.
In late June 2013, Applicant attended a pool party, arriving around 3:00 p.m. The
party  was  “byob”  -  bring  your  own  bottle  or  booze  –  so  liquor  was  available.  Although
the party  began  to  unwind  around dusk, Applicant  decided  to  stay  behind  because  he
had been drinking vodka mixed with juice. (Tr. 17-19) Around 10:00 p.m., he decided to
leave the party with a friend. He planned to run an errand, then drop the friend off on his
way home. Applicant was pulled over for speeding around 1:00 a.m. During the stop, he
registered  a  .11  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  on  a  breathalyzer  and  failed  a  field
sobriety test. (Tr. 22) In late September 2013, Applicant entered into a plea agreement
with  the  prosecutor  under  advice  of  counsel.  (Tr.  24)  Pleading  guilty,  Applicant  was
found  guilty  of  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  He  was  sentenced  to  60
days  confinement  (suspended),  agreed  to  two  years  of  probation,  had  his  driver’s
license suspended for 60 days, and paid a $500 fine plus court costs. He successfully
completed his probation period in September 2015.
In  early  November  2016,  a  couple  of  months  after  applying  for  a  security
clearance, Applicant left a dance bar after consuming two rum drinks. They were served
either straight or with mixer, over the course of about two hours. (Tr. 29-31) He did not
feel  so  impaired  he  should  not  drive  a  vehicle.  (Tr.  48-49)  Heading  home  in  his
automobile  with  his  girlfriend,  who  was  then  visiting  from  out-of-town,  he  was  stopped
for speeding at around 1:00 or 2:00 am. As the officer prepared to conduct sobriety and
breathalyzer testing, Applicant curtailed his participation in the examination. (Tr. 27-28,
36) He does not recall if he understood that in declining to submit to a breathalyzer, his
driver’s license would be automatically suspended. (Tr. 28)
Ultimately, in February 2017, Applicant appeared before a judge and pled guilty
to driving while intoxicated (DWI). He was again sentenced to 60 days confinement, but
this  time  he  served  seven  days  in  prison  and  paid  both  a  $200  fine  plus  court  costs.
Although two years of supervised probation were ordered, he met the criteria for early
abatement  in  April  2018  and  was  transferred  to  unsupervised  probation  through  mid-
February 2019. (Ex. D) In the interim, he completed alcohol and drug testing and, from
February  to  April  2017,  he  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  about  twice  a  week.
(Tr. 41, 53, 56-57)
Since  the  DUI,  Applicant  has  had  no  additional  brushes  with  the  law.  He
recognizes that his troubles were based on poor judgment that needed to be improved.
During  counseling,  he  totally  refrained  from  alcohol,  but  he  now  limits  his  alcohol
consumption to two to three glasses of alcohol per month. (Tr. 42-46) Since April 2018,
he has considered himself a “social drinker.” (Tr. 50-51) This is an overall reduction in
his alcohol consumption compared to his earlier patterns before the DWI. (Tr. 53)
Applicant’s  driving  privilege  has  been  restored.  He  no  longer  drives  his  own
sporty vehicle, which is presently on blocks in his driveway. When he needs to drive, he
uses  his  girlfriend’s  utilitarian  automobile.  (Tr.  57)  Otherwise,  having  purposefully
relocated  to  a  home  near  public  transportation  where  he  now  cohabitates  with  his
girlfriend, he relies on that mode of transportation or hires either Uber or Lyft. (Tr. 57)
Applicant  does  not  drive  if  he  has  been  imbibing.  (Tr.  63)  He  has  also  had  to
monitor his alcohol consumption due to a form of eczema wherein alcohol “was ruining”
his  skin.  (Tr.  68)  His  personal  circle  of  friends  has  been  reduced  and  he  no  longer
socializes as much with those with whom he used to once abuse alcohol, preferring to
associate  with  a  more  professional  crowd.  (Tr.  68)  At  present,  he  is  excelling  at  work
and looking to aspire to a more challenging and more lucrative position.

2002  and  his  master  welder’s  license  in  2007.  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  a
master welder by a federal contractor since 2017. He reports no military service and he
married in May 2016. Applicant has two daughters, age 3 months, and 10 years old. In
section 22 (Police Record) of his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86)
or  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  he  disclosed  an  arrest  for  driving  under  the
influence  (DUI)  in  July  2012.  He  pled  guilty  to  a  reduced  charge  of  reckless  driving  in
April  2013. He  completed probation and  community  service;  paid  fines and  costs;  and
attended  mandatory,  court-ordered  DUI-counseling  sessions  one  day  each  week  from
April to October 2013. He disclosed another arrest for DUI in November 2016.
The SOR alleges that Applicant was also arrested for DUI and criminal mischief
in  July  2005  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant  pled  no  contest  to  reduced  charges  of  reckless
driving  and  criminal  mischief  in  October  2005,  and  he  was  sentenced  to  one  year
probation  and  ordered  to  complete  a  DUI  level  one  program.  Applicant  admitted  all  of
the  allegations  in  the  SOR  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  in  July  2018.  (Item  3)  He  also
admitted  to  five  other  driving  offenses  including:  driving  while  license  suspended  in
2006, 2008, and 2017 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.e, and 1.i) and driving in violation of court-ordered
license  restrictions  in  2007  and  2013  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.g).  Additionally,  Applicant
admitted being charged with possession of drug paraphernalia in January 2007. (SOR ¶
1.c)  State  court  records  provided  by  Department  Counsel  corroborate  Applicant’s
admissions and confirm his multiple criminal offenses. (Items 6 – 7)
In his personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant stated that his latest November
2016 DUI occurred after he had dinner and three beers with friends and he was pulled
over  by  police.  Applicant’s  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  was  .09  and  the  state  law
threshold  for  DUI  is  .08  BAC.  Again,  he  paid  fines  and  $2,000  in  court  costs  plus  25
hours of community service, and one year probation. He completed mandatory alcohol
abuse  counseling  in  January  2018,  and  his  license  was  revoked  for  one  year.
Nonetheless,  Applicant  continued  to  drive  since  he  needed  to  get  to  work  and  felt  he
had  no  other  choice.  In  2007,  when  he  was  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana,  it
was  provided  to  him  at  a  party.  He  never  purchased  or  sold  marijuana,  and  claims  to

Guideline G – Alcohol Consumption
Guideline J- Criminal Conduct
The  Government  alleges  that  the  Applicant  has  engaged  in  excessive  alcohol
consumption, which often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure
to  control  impulses,  and  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant began working for his current employer in 2015, but has been working
on  the  same  military  base  for  the  past  thirty-four  years.   He  states  that  he  has  held  a
security clearance for thirty-four years.
Applicant has a long history of alcohol abuse.  On three separate occasions over
the  past  thirty  years,  he  has  been  arrested  for  Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol
(DUI).  Applicant does not believe he is an alcoholic, but does believe that he may have
had a drinking problem when he was a young man in the 1980’s.  He explained that his
excessive drinking has occurred only at social gatherings.
Applicant’s  most  recent  arrest  for  DUI,  and  DUI  with  a  blood  alcohol  content  of
.08% or higher was in July 2016.  (Government Exhibit 9.)  His blood alcohol content at
the  time  of  arrest  was  about  .15%.    Applicant  explained  that  he  drove  his  assistant
college  baseball  coach  home  after  one  of  the  games.    When  they  arrived  they
discussed  and  reviewed  game  plays  and  write-ups  that  were  presented  to  various
baseball  scouts.    Applicant  states  that  he  had  one  Jack  Daniels  and  coke  drink.    His
friend then asked for a ride to his wife’s friend’s house where his wife was located, and
when  Applicant  arrived  he  consumed  another  drink  of  alcohol.    He  then  proceeded  to
drive himself home, and on the way was arrested.   Applicant was given a field sobriety
test that he failed, and was taken to county jail where he spent the night.  Applicant pled
no contest to the second count, and the first count was dismissed.  He was ordered to
enroll  in  an  alcohol  program,  complete  45  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings,  and
abstain from alcohol for 15 months.  He was placed on three year probations that was to
end in August 2019.  Prior to this arrest, Applicant was arrested on two other occasions
for DUI.
In January 2001, Applicant was arrested for DUI, and DUI with a BAC of .08% or
higher.  (Government Exhibit 8.)  Applicant stated that on this occasion, he and his wife
were invited to attend a Super Bowl Party.  His wife fell ill and did not attend.  Applicant
attended the party without her, and left the party unexpectedly around halftime when an
individual he did not like showed up that Applicant did not want to be around.  On the
way home there was a checkpoint, and Applicant was pulled over, and arrested for DUI.
Applicant’s blood alcohol level at the time of arrest was .20%.  Applicant pled no contest
to  the  DUI  and  was  placed  on  three  year  probation,  in  addition  to  being  fined  $1,429,
ordered  to  pay  victim  restitution  of  $100,  enroll  in  and  complete  a  six-month  alcohol-
awareness program, and ordered to abstain from drinking alcohol for two years with his
driving privilege suspended for ninety days, serve ten days in jail with credit for one day
on March 16, 2001.  Applicant’s probation did not terminate until about March 2004.
In May 1987, Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.
(Government Exhibit  7.)    He  pled no  contest  and  was  placed  on  three  year probation,
fined,  and  ordered  to  attend  an  alcohol  awareness  program.    Applicant  does  not
remember the details of this arrest.  (Tr. p. 61.)
Applicant is currently on probation for his 2016 DUI conviction that will terminate
in August 2019.  He states that he no longer consumes alcohol.  He states that his last
drink of alcohol was in the summer of 2016.  He no longer has cravings for alcohol.  He
states that he has made the decision to completely live a sober lifestyle.  He states that
he  has  no  intentions  of  ever  using  alcohol,  not  simply  because  it  was  a  term  of
probation but because he genuinely wishes to take positive steps to improve himself as
a  person.    He  wants  to  look  for  some  kind  of  psychological  counseling  that  he  thinks
would be helpful to him.  (Tr. pp. 58 -59.)  He has continued to comply with all terms of
his probation and has enrolled in the prescribed alcohol awareness program that he has
attended for about a year.  (Applicant’s Exhibits D, G, and Tr. p. 64.)
Applicant states that he is now more involved with the community, still coaching
baseball, and has found religion.  He attends church regularly, and the power of prayer
has helped him with his drinking.  (Tr. p. 75.)  He had previously stepped away from his
religion and is now back on course.  His brother helped get him back into it, and it has
helped create a new outlook on life for Applicant.  (Tr. p. 71.)
In December 2003, Applicant was issued his first SOR from the DoD.  The matter
was  adjudicated,  and  Applicant’s  security  clearance  was  subsequently  revoked.
Applicant  was  aware  at  that  time  that  the  DoD  was  concerned  about  his  excessive
drinking,  and  at  that  time  Applicant  had  only  been  arrested  on  two  occasions  for  DUI.

Applicant’s  immediate  supervisor,  as  well  as  the  Director,  testified  on  behalf  of
the  Applicant.    Both  gentlemen  considered  the  Applicant  to  be  an  excellent  employee

drinking  with  no  cravings  for  alcohol in  between  episodes  resulting  in four  DUI’s.  The
psychotherapist  further  noted  that,  “quite  commonly,  this  drinking  pattern  limits  an
individual’s  ability  to  identify  the  power  alcohol  exhibits  over  them.    Despite  this,  Mr.
Muro  took  his  2016  DUI  seriously  and  stopped  drinking  immediately  afterwards.”

"Unless  otherwise  indicated  by  citation  to  another  part  of  the  record,  I  have
extracted these findings of fact from Applicant’s SOR answer (Item 2) and his 2015 SCA
(Item 3).
Applicant, age 38, is unmarried without children. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in
2003 and served on active duty through at least 2015. During his service, he deployed to
Iraq  three  times.  The  record  does  not  specify  when  or  under  what  conditions  he
separated. The record also does not specify for how long he has worked for his current
defense-contractor  employer.  He  was  granted  DOD  security  clearances  in  2003  and
2011. (Item 3; Item 5 at 4 and 6).
The  SOR  alleged  four  incidents  of  Applicant’s  excessive  alcohol  consumption,
involving two Non-Judicial Punishments (NJP) under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, in 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.b); and two Driving Under the
Influence of Alcohol (DUI) arrests, in 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.c) and 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.d). Applicant
admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c. He admitted the underlying arrest and
conviction,  but  denied  SOR  ¶  1.d  on  the  basis  that  certain  other  facts  alleged  were
incorrect.
While  on  active  duty  in  2003,  Applicant  received  NJP  for  drinking  alcohol  in
advanced  individual  training.  The  record  does  not  contain  any  other  details  about  this
incident. (Item 11 at 30).
While on active duty in 2006, Applicant became drunk and disorderly, damaged a
wall  in  an  unoccupied  room,  and  then  became  involved  in  a  verbal  altercation  which
turned physical when he pushed and choked another  soldier. He received NJP for two
offenses: (1) damage to government property, and (2) drunk and disorderly. The resultant
actions taken were a letter of concern or counseling (the record does not specify which),
a  $429  fine,  and  a  reduction  in  rank  from  E-4  to  E-3.  He  was  referred  to  an  Army-
sponsored substance abuse program, which he completed. He admitted that he became
“carried away” while drinking with his friends in the barracks that evening, having recently
returned from a deployment. He has not had any physical altercations since this incident.
(Item 5 at 4; Item 7; Item 10; Item 11 at 30 and 43).
While on active duty in 2013, Applicant consumed five or six whiskey and cokes at
a bar one night between 7:00 pm and 2:00 am. During his drive home, he was stopped
by state police at a sobriety checkpoint. After the police officer detected a strong odor of
an  alcoholic  beverage  emanating  from  Applicant’s  person,  three  standardized  field
sobriety  tests  were  administered  which  indicated  he  was  impaired.  He  was  also
administered  a  breath  test  which  measured  a  .089  breath  alcohol  content.  He  was
arrested and charged with DUI. The court later dismissed the charge due to suppression
of the evidence from the checkpoint. (Item 5 at 4-5; Item 8; Item 10).
While on active duty in 2015, Applicant consumed two beers at a softball field after
a game. While he was driving home, a civilian police officer stopped him for speeding.
After  detecting  a  moderate  odor  of  an  alcoholic  beverage  emanating  from  Applicant’s
person, the officer administered standardized field sobriety tests, which Applicant failed
to  perform  satisfactorily.  A  preliminary  breath  test  administered  during  the  arrest  also
indicated  impairment.  He  was  arrested  for  DUI.  While  being  processed  at  the  civilian
police station, Applicant gave two breath samples, which measured .138 and .137 breath
alcohol concentrations. He was then transported to the military police station, where he
was notified of the suspension or revocation (the record does not specify which)  of his
on-post driving privileges. Applicant was later convicted of DUI, and sentenced to 10 days
in jail (all but one day suspended), fined approximately $1,960, and ordered to complete
16 hours of DUI education. He completed each requirement. (Item 4; Item 5 at 5-6; Item
9; Item 10).
During a 2015 security clearance interview (SI) with a DOD authorized investigator,
Applicant described the facts and circumstances of the 2006, 2013, and 2015 incidents
and his alcohol consumption habits in general. He described himself as a social drinker,
who generally consumed approximately three beers or mixed drinks at a time. He did not
believe  that  he  had  a  drinking  problem  and  had  not  been  diagnosed  as  alcohol
dependent. He did not intend to consume any alcohol while undergoing his 16 hours of
DUI education, which consisted of classes led by a counselor. He had completed 8 hours
at  the  time  of  the  SI.  He  did  plan  to  resume  responsible  drinking  after  completing  his
hours, but professed a future intent never to drink and drive again. (Item 5 at 5-7).
In April 2016, the DOD CAF sent Applicant a SOR alleging security concerns under
Guidelines G and J (Criminal Conduct), due to three of the incidents alleged in the 2019
SOR  currently  being  adjudicated.  It  did  not  allege  the  2003  incident.  In  May  2016,
Applicant responded to the 2016 SOR. He admitted the substance, but not some of the
details,  of  the  alleged  incidents,  including  what,  if  any,  disciplinary  or  administrative
actions were taken by Applicant’s command in connection with his 2015 DUI. The record
did not specify the outcome of the adjudication of the 2016 SOR or the current status of
the DOD security clearances that he was previously granted. (Item 3; Item 5 at 6; Item 6;
Item 10).
In Applicant’s August 2018 responses to DOHA-issued interrogatories about his
alcohol  consumption,  Applicant  reported  that  he  consumed  “3-4  beers”  two  times  per
month (most recently August 2018), and “2-3 beers” two times per month (most recently
July 2018). He had not driven after consuming any amount of alcohol since his 2015 DUI.
Instead, he had either used a ride-sharing service or taken a cab. He had stopped going
to bars. He concluded his responses with the following statement: “I refuse to let alcohol
affect my life.” (Item 5 at 9-10, and 12).
In addition to the court-ordered actions Applicant took after his 2015 DUI, he also
voluntarily refrained from drinking after his softball games, attended a Mothers  Against
Drunk  Driving  victim  impact  panel,  and  completed  traffic  survival  school.  Applicant’s
response to the 2016 SOR included the statement: “I have become aware that I have let
alcohol be the reason for bad decisions. So, I have established a strong support system
with my friends and family to help me be more responsible.” He declared that with the
help of his “strong support system,” DUI incidents will not occur again. (Item 10).

Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  who  has  been
employed as a calibration technician for his current employer since 2008.2 In 1982, he

Syndrome. (Tr. 33-34, 81) He has held a security clearance for about 31 years. (Tr. 83;
SOR response) If he loses his security clearance, he will lose his employment. (Tr. 85)
Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct
The SOR alleges the following conduct of security significance.
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in June 1990, Applicant was charged with Operating a Vehicle
While Drunk. It was dark and raining, and Applicant hit a car with his motorcycle. (Tr. 45-
47) Applicant received minor injuries. (Tr. 47) The car left the scene of the accident. (Tr.
46) Applicant  refused a  breathalyzer test.  (Tr. 46) He  received  nonjudicial punishment
under  Article  15,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice,  and  a  general  discharge  under
honorable conditions because of misconduct. (Tr. 46, 48; GE 1 at 12-13) He conceded
his blood-alcohol level exceeded the legal limit. (Tr. 46)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges in November 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with
Disorderly Conduct-Brawling/Fighting-Domestic Violence. Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 2.b;
however, he said the case never went to court because the charges were dismissed. (Tr.
1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available
in the cited exhibits.
2  Unless  stated  otherwise,  the  source  for  the  information  in  this  paragraph  is  Applicant’s
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government
Exhibit (GE) 1)
70-71; GE 3; SOR response) There is no evidence that this incident was related to his
alcohol consumption.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges in March 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving
Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). (GE 1) Applicant drank five or six rum and cokes at
a bar. (Tr. 87; GE 3) The police stopped Applicant because of a traffic violation. (Tr. 50)
He kept burping, and the police were unable to conduct a breathalyzer. (Tr. 50) The police
did not complete the breathalyzer test or attempt to conduct a blood-alcohol test. (Tr. 51)
He attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings twice a week for six months. (Tr. 88)
He was required to remain sober for one year. (Tr. 88) He successfully completed the
diversion plan, and the charge was dismissed with prejudice. (Tr. 52; GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges in August 2012, Applicant was charged with Disorderly Conduct
and  Criminal  Trespass.  (GE  1)  Applicant  said  he  drank  about  two  drinks  at  a  party;
however, he told the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he drank
five or six drinks and that he was intoxicated. (Tr. 55, 90; GE 3) He left the party, and he
followed a 16-year-old girl to her apartment which was located in the same building as
the party. (Tr. 53, 90-91) At the time, he said he thought the girl he was following was an
adult. (Tr. 109) She told him he could not come inside her apartment, and he went to the
parking lot where his vehicle was located. (GE 3) He left the parking lot and he returned
to her apartment because he said he needed to obtain directions. (Tr. 54) She told him to
leave; they argued; and her father evidently called the police. (Tr. 92, 110, 115; GE 3)
The  owner of  the  apartment  where  the  party  occurred  was  cited for serving  alcohol to
minors. (Tr. 110) Applicant conceded that alcohol played a part in his decisions because
if  he  had  not  been  drinking  he  would  not  have  needed  directions.  (Tr.  55-56,  92)  He
pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. (GE 3)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  in  June  2013,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI.  (GE  1)  The
police  stopped  Applicant for a  traffic violation.  (Tr. 56-57) His  blood-alcohol test  (BAT)
result was .187. (Tr. 57) Applicant believed he could drive, and he did not think he was
“impaired” even though his BAT was .187. (Tr. 57, 93-94) Applicant was found guilty of
DUI, and he was on probation for one year. (Tr. 94; GE 1; GE 3) He received a $1,000
fine,  and  he  was  required  to  remain  sober  during  his  probation.  (Tr.  94;  GE  1)  After
completing  probation,  he  reduced  the  number  of  occasions  in  which  he  drove  after
drinking alcohol. (Tr. 58, 95) He limited his alcohol consumption to one beer when he is
going to drive. (Tr. 58) SOR ¶ 2.a cross alleges the information in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through
1.d as criminal conduct.
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges in September 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with
Domestic  Battery-Knowing/Reckless  Bodily  Harm.  (GE  1)  The  assault  involved
Applicant’s first wife. (Tr. 30-32) Applicant had about two drinks of an alcohol beverage.
(Tr. 72, 95) He was angry, and he pushed and kicked a door, which struck his spouse’s
hand. (Tr. 67-68) He claimed he did not see her when he hit her with the door. (Tr. 69)
She also claimed he threw keys at her and hit her; however, he denied that the keys hit
her. (Tr. 72-74) He threatened to sell the house. (Tr. 74) The part of the OPM summary
of interview and the police report indicating he threatened to kill everyone in his home are
incorrect. (Tr. 75, 96-97; GE 3) The police arrested him, and he was issued a 72-hour
restraining  order. (Tr. 69;  GE  3)  His  spouse  wanted  Applicant  to  come home,  and  the
prosecutor dismissed the charges. (Tr. 70, 76; GE 1)
Applicant’s current spouse met his first spouse on one occasion at a wedding, and
his current spouse described his first spouse as aggressive and violent. (Tr. 30-32) His
current spouse observed his first spouse as she assaulted Applicant at a wedding, and
his first wife was so out of control that it was “like you see in the cartoons.” (Tr. 30-31)
SOR  ¶  2.d  alleges  in  July  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Domestic  Battery-
Bodily Harm. Applicant had gone out drinking. (Tr. 97; GE 2) His current spouse took his
wallet  and  his  identification  cards  and  credit  cards.  (Tr.  98-99)  She  threw  his  wallet
outside, and she locked him out of the house. (Tr. 98; GE 3) She subsequently returned
his  identification  and  credit  cards  to  him.  (Tr.  99)  A  day  or  so  later,  Applicant  and  his
spouse were involved in a physical altercation. He said she was the aggressor, and he
was only attempting to keep her from driving his truck. (Tr. 77) His spouse hit him, and
her ring cut his face. (Tr. 78)
Applicant’s  spouse’s description  of  the  July  2017  altercation  with  Applicant  was
consistent  with  Applicant’s  description.  Applicant’s  spouse  said  that  she  and  Applicant
argued about his alcohol consumption several days before he was arrested for assault.
(Tr. 37) She took his wallet. (Tr. 37) She was anxious about when he would come home
after work. (Tr. 38-39) She said she was “yelling and screaming and lying and saying he’s
hurting  me.”  (Tr.  18)  She  said  they  had  a  “scuffle”  because  he  took  her  car  keys  and
passport and  because  she had  taken pain medication  and  consumed  alcohol.  (Tr. 18)
Her purse was in his vehicle, and it contained her passport and car keys. (Tr. 20) She
attributed the altercation to her use of alcohol together with “Prozac and really high doses
of steroids.” (Tr. 19) She felt angry and aggressive, and she hit him. (Tr. 19-20) He was
not aggressive; however, the videotape showed him not letting her in his truck and pulling
her away from his truck. (Tr. 20) She believed the police arrested Applicant because he
is a large person; he was yelling; and a witness made a statement against him. (Tr. 21-
22) He did not punch her; however, she had “some scrapes and things.” (Tr. 22) She said
she  lied  to  the  police  about  the  abuse  because  she  was  angry,  and  the  drugs  were
affecting her judgment. (Tr. 22)
Applicant’s spouse asked the prosecutors not to charge Applicant, nevertheless,
they prosecuted him. (Tr. 23) He pleaded guilty; and he received a “deferred judgment”
probation agreement. (GE 2; AE A) He received fines and court costs totaling $482. (GE
2) His probation specified that he was not supposed to consume alcohol from February
2018 to February 2019. (Tr. 102-103; GE 2 (stating that he would “[u]se no alcohol”) He
said he had a single relapse; however, he did not report it to his probation officer because
he did not consider it to be relevant. (Tr. 103)3 His probation officer did not specifically
ask him whether he consumed alcohol. (Tr. 105)  He conceded violating probation was
pertinent, but he did not consider it to be crucial. (Tr. 103-104) He received a deferred
3 Applicant’s August 4, 2018 SOR response indicates he has “complied and continues to comply
with his probation” requirements. (SOR response at 4, 6) His SOR response indicates that he “no longer
drives while under the influence” of alcohol. (SOR response at 3)
sentence, and he remained on probation until February 2019. (Tr. 79) On February 28,
2019, the domestic violence offense was dismissed with prejudice. (AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges on November 28, 2017, Applicant stated at an OPM interview
that he drank alcohol every day, and he drank alcohol to intoxication every other week.
(GE 3) Applicant admitted that he drank three or four beers almost every day, and every
other weekend he drank seven or eight beers. (Tr. 59-60; GE 3) In the past five years,
Applicant  drank  enough  alcohol  to  have  blackouts  once  or  twice.  (Tr.  115) Applicant’s
spouse said he reduced his alcohol consumption in 2017. (Tr. 16)
On  March  30,  2018,  Applicant  received  an  alcohol  use  assessment.4  It  did  not
recommend  counseling  or  treatment.  (Tr.  105)  He  reported  his  arrests  in  2006,  2011,
2013, and 2017 to security. He said he drank two to six drinks twice a week. He completed
alcohol treatment or counseling in 2006 and 2013.
Applicant  said  he  attends  counseling  once  a  week  or  more  often  as  needed,
meditation, and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as needed. (Tr. 63, 82) He most
recently attended an AA meeting three weeks before his hearing. (Tr. 113-114) He said
he attends AA meetings once or twice a month; however, he did not attend enough AA
meetings  to  receive  any  AA  coins.  (Tr.  114)  In  May  2018,  he  completed  a  class  on
domestic violence.
More recently, Applicant used Uber or public transportation in lieu of driving himself
after  he  consumes  alcohol.  (Tr.  26-27)  Applicant  said  he  decided  to  quit  consuming
alcohol in 2017, and he actually stopped drinking “[a]bout that time.” (Tr. 101, 116-117)
He subsequently had a couple of relapses. (Tr. 101, 106, 117-118) He said the last time
he consumed alcohol was in August 2018. (Tr. 102, 106, 118)5 His spouse also stopped
consuming alcohol, and they do not have alcohol in their home. (Tr. 17) They do not go
to bars. (Tr. 25) Applicant does not intend to drink alcohol in the future. (Tr. 111)
Character Evidence
In  the  winter  of  2017,  Applicant’s  spouse  had  major  surgery.  (Tr.  18)  After  she
married  Applicant,  she  had  a  stroke,  transient  ischemic  attacks  or  TIAs,  an  embolism,
broken bones from a fall, a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection,
and  blood  clots.  (Tr.  27-28)  She  spent  41  days  in  intensive  care.  (Tr.  28)  She  was
bedridden for a time. (Tr. 28) She said the post-surgery drugs affected her memory. (Tr.
18)  Applicant  has  been  very  supportive  of  her.  (Tr.  18-28)  He  attended  marriage
counseling and classes. (Tr. 23) She supported approval of his security clearance. (Tr.
36, 43-44)
4 Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this paragraph is an alcohol assessment
on March 30, 2018. (SOR response)
5 Applicant’s spouse  did  not pay  attention to the  amount  of beer he drank. (Tr. 41)  She did not
notice  when  he stopped drinking alcohol for several  weeks. (Tr. 42) She  was unable to say  whether he
stopped drinking alcohol in 2017, 2018, or 2019. (Tr. 43)
Applicant’s 2017 and 2018 performance reviews indicate he exceeds expectations
or meets expectations for all categories. (AE B; SOR response) The general sense of the
statements of six of Applicant’s coworkers, a family support worker, and friends is that he
is  diligent,  reliable,  peaceful,  dedicated,  intelligent,  professional,  and  compliant  with
procedural requirements. (AE C; SOR response)
",False
"Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following
findings  of  fact:  Applicant  is  48  years  old.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
November 2000. She was married from 1993 to 1997. She married a second time in
1999,  which  ended  in  a  divorce  in  2011.  She  has  a  16-year-old  daughter  from  her
second marriage. Applicant  is  a  consultant for  a  DOD  contracting group.  She  started
this  job  in  September  2010,  but  left  the  company  in  September  2016  for  a  project
manager  position  in  Germany.  Applicant  and  her  daughter  moved  to  Germany  in
September 2016. She was terminated by that U.S. defense contractor in August 2017,
and  Applicant  and  her  daughter  returned  to  the  U.S.  Her  previous  employer  then
rehired  Applicant  in  October  2017.  Since  2010,  she  has  possessed  a  DOD  security
clearance. (Tr. 12-15, 33; GE 1, AE A, AE B)
The  amended  SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  deliberately  omitted  material
facts during her background interview with a DOD authorized investigator on October
25, 2017. She had been asked if she had any law enforcement-related incidents while
she was overseas, which Applicant denied. In fact, Applicant was charged with Driving
under  the  Influence  (DUI)  in  December  2016,  with  a  blood-alcohol  content  of  .061%
(exceeding  the  German  limit  of  .05%).  She  had  been  involved  in  a  car  accident  and
considered  at  fault.  Applicant  was  also  charged  with  child  endangerment  since  her
minor daughter was in her car.
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  admitted  that  she  was  involved  in  an  incident  in
Germany  in  December  2016,  which  involved  a  traffic  accident.  She  also  admitted  to
consuming  alcohol  prior  to  the  accident.  She  had  one  “very  full”  glass  of  wine  while
having dinner out with her daughter. At the time, she was stressed because she and
her  supervisor  did  not  get  along.  Applicant  drank  the  wine  quickly,  she  did  not  feel
intoxicated,  and  they  left  the  restaurant  to  run  errands.  She  was  involved  in  a  car
accident shortly after leaving the restaurant. (Tr. 15-19)
Applicant did not believe she was at fault for the car accident. She was struck
by another car while she was attempting to make a turn. She reported the accident to
the U.S. military police. The German police arrived and asked Applicant and the other
driver  to  take  a  breathalyzer  test.  She  tested  over  the  German  legal  limit.  She  was
charged  with  DUI  and  she  was  also  cited  for  causing  the  car  accident.  The  U.S.
military  police  picked  up  Applicant  and  her  daughter  from  the  German  police  station.
Her  criminal  case  was  transferred  to  the  U.S.  military’s  legal  department.  The  U.S.
Command suspended her driver’s license for 90 days. Her driving privileges were also
suspended  for  10  months  by  the  German  government,  and  she  was  fined.  She
subsequently  participated  in  an  alcohol  evaluation  in  March  2019,  and  the  results
showed she did not have any alcohol disorder or any need for alcohol treatment. (Tr.
20-28; GE 3; AE J)
Applicant was also charged with child endangerment by the German police after
her DUI and accident, because her 13-year-old daughter was in the vehicle. Applicant
was  arrested  by  the  German  authorities  and  placed  in  handcuffs,  and  her  daughter
was  taken  into  protective  custody.  Applicant  and  her  daughter  were  referred  to  a
therapist associated with the family advocacy program. Applicant was investigated for
child neglect, and she met with the therapist several times. The therapist also met with
Applicant’s  daughter.  The  therapist  determined  that  Applicant  met  the  criteria  for
neglect,  but  concluded  that  Applicant  did  not  need  additional  parenting  classes  or
alcohol counseling, as her risk level was determined to be low. Applicant reported her
arrest to her supervisor. (Tr. 28-30, 34; GE 3, GE 4; AE K, AE L)
Applicant’s  employer  placed  her  on  a  performance  improvement  plan,  and  in
July  2017,  she  was  placed  on  administrative  leave.  In  August  2017,  she  was
terminated by her employer due to her inability to successfully perform her job duties.
Applicant and her daughter returned to the U.S., and in about October 2017, she was
rehired by her former federal contractor employer. (Tr. 33; AE B)
Applicant met with an authorized DOD investigator in October 2017. The report
summarizing the interview  was later reviewed and adopted by Applicant as accurate,
after she made a few changes to her reported travel. (GE 2) Applicant had extensive
foreign travel and connections. The DOD investigator questioned her about her foreign
travel,  foreign  connections,  and  asked  her  if  she  had  any  law  enforcement  related
incidents  during  her  time  spent  overseas.  Applicant  answered  “no.”  She  was
specifically questioned whether she had any interactions with law enforcement, either
foreign  or  domestic.  Again,  she  provided  a  negative  response.  Applicant  was  then
confronted  with  her  December  2016  arrest  for  DUI,  failure  to  stop  at  traffic  control
device, and child endangerment by the German police. The investigator asked her why
she  did  not  initially  disclose  this  information  during  questioning,  and  she  stated  that
since the incident occurred in Germany, she did not believe anyone would discover it.
She  also  stated  that  she  did  not  want  the  incident  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  her
future since she believed if the incident had occurred in the U.S., she would not have
been charged with DUI. (Tr. 42-46; GE 2)
At  the  hearing, Applicant  stated  that  she  carefully  listened  to  the DOD  agent’s
questions,  and  he  had  only  asked  her  if  she  had  any  incidents  with  U.S.  law
enforcement  since  the  completion  of  her  SCA,  which  she  truthfully  responded,  “no.”
Applicant testified that, at the time, she was being interviewed by a “junior investigator”
while a “senior investigator” observed the interview. Applicant testified that the “senior
investigator”  asked  her  something  to  the  effect  of,  “Would  you  like  to  tell  us  what
happened  in  Germany?”  Applicant  then  provided  the  information  about  her  arrest  in
Germany.  She  did  not  initially  disclose  her  2016  arrest  during  the  interview  because
she was embarrassed by it, and it was also out of character for her. She denied that
she deliberately tried to hide the information during her background interview. (Tr. 35-
41, 62-64)
Upon  further  questioning,  Applicant  denied  ever  telling  the  investigators  that
she  did  not  disclose  her  arrest  because  she  did  not  believe  anyone  would  find  out
about it since it happened in Germany, or that she did not want the incident to have a
negative  impact  on  her  future.  Applicant  made  some  detailed,  specific  corrections  to
the  interview  summary  regarding  her  foreign  travel,  however,  she  did  not  list  any
modifications,  or  even  note  in  the  interrogatory  these  incorrect  statements  that  were
attributed to her during the background interview. (Tr. 42-49; GE 2)
Applicant provided four character letters. One of the individuals recommending
her  for  a  security  clearance  stated:  “She  (Applicant)  told  me  that  during  an  interview
for  her  Top  Secret  clearance  background  investigation  she  misinterpreted  the
investigator’s  line  of  questioning  regarding  the  incident  which  led  to  the  investigators
believing  she  was  being  deceptive.”  All  four  individuals  stated  that  Applicant  is
trustworthy and honest. (AE C)

"Applicant admitted to the one allegation of the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  5.)
He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2004, and has held a security
clearance since 2013. (TR at page 18 line 16 to page 21 line 5.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
1.a.  Applicant  started  drinking  alcohol  “regularly”  in  2006.  (TR  at  page  27  lines
1~6.)  Until  2006,  his  regular  consumption  would  be  about  “eight  drinks”  at  one  sitting.
(TR  at  page  27  line  17  to  page  28  line  4.)  That  consumption  “increased  both  in
frequency  and  in  quantity”  in  “about  2008.”  (TR  at  page  28  lines  5~20.)  In  2013,
Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from “fatty liver disease,” but Applicant continued
to  consume  alcohol.  (TR  at  page  29  lines  1~24.)  His  treating  physician  thought
Applicant  was  drinking  excessively;  and  as  a  result,  “advised  .  .  .  [Applicant]  to  quit
drinking.” (Id.) However, Applicant continued to consume alcohol.
From September of 2013 until January of 2014, Applicant received treatment for
his  liver  disease.  (TR  at  page  33  line  3  to  page  34  line  23.)  There  he  “learned  a  lot
about  alcohol,  alcoholism,  or  alcohol  addiction.”  (Id.)  As  a  result,  Applicant  abstained
from  alcohol  consumption  until  May  of  2014.  (TR  at  page  34  lines  15~23.)  He  then
returned to its consumption, “more than approximately six drinks at the time during the
week. On the weekend . . . it was variable but would tend towards more 10 drinks at a
time.”  (TR  at  page  37  line  18  to  page  38  line  3.)  In  October  of  2015,  and  again  in
February of 2018, Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from an “alcohol use disorder,
moderate.”  (GXs  4  and  5.)  However,  Applicant  continued  to  consume  alcohol  until
August of 2018, a month after the issuance of the SOR. (TR at page 18 lines 1~8.) In
the last seven months, Applicant has been committed to his alcohol abuse recovery, as
evidenced by his authored progress reports. (AppXs B~D.)
",False
"Applicant, age 55, has two adult children and one minor child. In December 2017,
because of his drinking habits, his wife separated from him after 29 years of marriage. A
divorce is pending. He received a high school diploma in 1981. He has been employed
as  a  product  line  manager  since  2005,  and  has  maintained  his  current  DOD  security
clearance since 1996. He previously held a DOD security clearance during his service in
the U.S. Air Force from 1981 through 1990. (Item 2; Item 4 at 7).
Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI)
in 1997, 2002, and 2017. He successfully completed alcohol treatment programs in 1996,
2003,  and  2018.  Each  time,  his  treatment  recommendations  advised  abstention  from
alcohol.  He  was  diagnosed  with  an alcohol use  disorder  during  treatment  in  2003  and
2018. The record does not establish whether a diagnosis was rendered during his 1996
treatment. (Item 1; Item 2 at 29-30, 33-34; Item 4 at 4, 5, 7, 8 11, 12; Item 5; Item 8).
During his 2015 and 2018 security clearance interviews, Applicant acknowledged
his alcoholism and referred to himself as an alcoholic. He recognized that he consumed
alcohol  to  relieve  stress  and  to  avoid  his  problems.  He  conceded  the  poor  judgment
associated  with  his alcohol  consumption.  However, in  his  2019 SOR  answer,  while  he
admitted the “bad decision” that he made driving after drinking, he believed that his 2017
arrest “would not have occurred” had it not been for his wife and daughter pressuring him
to conduct a safety test on a vehicle with an expired registration. (Item 1; Item 4 at 5 and
8).
Earlier in the day of his arrest in 2017, Applicant reportedly consumed “almost a
pint” of whiskey at his home. After dinner, believing “enough time had passed” and that
he was not impaired, he drove his daughter’s car to test whether its power steering issues
had resolved before she drove it to college the following day. An officer stopped him for
an  unspecified  reason  and  then  discovered  that  the  vehicle’s  registration  had  been
flagged for failing an emissions test. After failing field sobriety tests and registering a blood
alcohol  content of  .11,  Applicant  was  charged  with  several offenses,  including  DWI.  In
February 2018, he pled guilty to DWI for he received probation before judgment, including
six months in jail, suspended, and unsupervised probation for three years. (Item 4 at 7;
Item 5).
Applicant reported two periods of sobriety prior to his 2017 arrest: approximately
one year following his 1997 arrest, and approximately 10 years between 2004 and 2014.
He attributed resuming alcohol consumption in about 2014 to the stress associated with
ongoing  marital  issues.  He  had  been  in  counseling  due  to  his  marital  problems  in  the
months prior to his 2017 arrest, and had attended an AA meeting just days before. (Item
1; Item 4 at 8, 11 through 13).
Applicant  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  his  2017  arrest  and  intends  to  stay
sober.  As  of  April  2018,  he  had  been  attending  AA  meetings  three  days  per  week.  In
March 2019, he affirmed his desire and motivation to stay sober, particularly since he had
reportedly suffered a myriad of negative personal and financial consequences after his
2017 arrest. Because he did not address it in his SOR answer or respond to the FORM,
the record does not specify his current relapse prevention or stress management plans,
including whether he continued his AA attendance after April 2018. (Item 1; Item 4 at 8
and 13).
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact. He is 29 years old, single, and does not have any children. (Answer;
GE 1; AE A).
Applicant graduated from high school in 2008 and earned a bachelor’s degree in
2013.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  had  been  pursuing  his  master’s  degree  since
late 2015.  He  has  worked as  an engineer for his current  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,
since 2013, when he was also first granted a security clearance. (Tr. at 5-6, 19-22, 41-
42, 58; GE 1; AE A, B).
Applicant testified that a number of his college friends remained in the vicinity of
their  college  after  graduation  but  he  moved  away.  As  he  traveled  for  work  one  to  two
weeks  monthly,  there  was  “no  social  aspect  of  drinking.”  In  approximately  October
2016, when he moved back to the area in which his college friends lived, he consumed
alcohol weekly to monthly at social events. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 1, 3; AE B).
Within  the  first  weekend  of  his  move,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
driving  while intoxicated (DWI), first offense.  He had consumed eight to ten  beers and
mixed  drinks  throughout  the  course  of  the  day  with  his  college  friends  while  watching
football.  He  acknowledged  that  his  decision  to  drive  was  “completely  irresponsible”
since he was drunk, but he thought “I’m right down the corner . . . I made the mistake of
thinking I could make it.” He testified that he got a flat tire and attempted to pull over to
the side of the road when he was pulled over by the police, questioned, and arrested.
He  denied  that  he  had  been  swerving  or  of  having  being  told  such  by  the  officer.  He
acknowledged  that  he  initially  denied  that  he  had  consumed  alcohol  that  evening
because  he  was  “scared,”  but  he  then  admitted  to  having  done  so  upon  further
questioning by the officer. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .26%. (Tr. at 22-59; GE
1-5, 7; AE A, B, E).
Applicant was convicted and sentenced to 180 days confinement with 165 days
suspended,  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  12  months  with  restricted  use
permitted,  he  was  fined  $500,  and  he  was  ordered  to  attend  and  complete  an  alcohol
and  substance  abuse  program  (ASAP).  In  December  2016,  during  pre-trial,  he
underwent  a  voluntary  substance  abuse  evaluation  as  recommended  by  his  DWI
attorney.  The  licensed  professional  counselor  (LPC)  noted  that  Applicant  expressed
genuine  concern  and  regret  regarding  his  DWI,  and  seemed  to  be  a  “responsible
individual  who  has  accomplished  his  educational  goals  and  maintains  an  established
career.”  She  concluded  that  he  did  not  meet  the  criteria  for  any  alcohol-related
diagnosis. She recommended that he remain abstinent from alcohol and complete a 24-
session  alcohol  treatment  plan  due  to  her  concern  that  he  attempted  to  drive  with  a
significant  BAC.  He  testified  that  he  remained  abstinent  throughout  the  duration  of
ASAP,  he  completed  ASAP  in  approximately  January  2018,  and  the  LPC  made  no
further recommendations upon his ASAP completion. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 1-5, 7; AE A, B,
D, E).
As a result of his DWI, Applicant had an ignition interlock device installed in his
car  in  approximately  April  2017.  Between  then  and  July  2017,  he  registered  a  total  of
three  violations.  He  testified  that  he  believed  two  of  the  three  violations  were  false
positives. He believed the device was triggered on these occasions by the banana and
protein  shake he  consumed for breakfast  during  his  1.5  hour commute  to  work, as  he
would test at a .00% BAC when he would blow into the device again five minutes  later.
(Tr. at 22-59; GE 2, 5-7; AE A, B).
The  night  before  his  third  violation,  Applicant  testified  that  he  consumed  one  to
two beers between 5:00 pm and 9:00 pm. He set the device off after he  ate a banana
and drank a protein shake during his commute to work that morning. He did not believe
that the two beers he consumed the previous night were sufficient to trigger the device.
He testified that he pulled over to the side of the road, blew into the device again, and
registered a .00% BAC. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 2, 5-7; AE A, B).
Applicant  was  charged  with  ASAP  non-compliance  as  a  result  of  his  three
violations.  He  pled  guilty.  His  suspended  confinement  for  his  DWI  conviction  was
reduced to 157 days, he was ordered to eight days confinement, which was reduced to
four for good behavior, 50 hours of community service, and his probation was extended
for one year. He was permitted to retain his restricted driver’s license.  He testified that
he would have worked remotely from home if he had reason to believe he would trigger
his ignition interlock device, and he did not intentionally trigger it and thereby violate his
probation. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 2, 5-7; AE A, B).
Applicant  completed  probation  in  early  2018.  These  were  his  only  alcohol  and
criminal-related offenses, and he has not since had  any further such incidents. In April
2019, he voluntarily underwent another substance abuse assessment. The assessment
coordinator  noted  that  he  did  not  meet  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  a  current  or  past
substance  use  disorder,  and  no  further  recommendations  for  treatment  services  were
necessary. (Tr. at 22-60; GE 2, 7; AE A, B, D).
Applicant testified that his family, friends, boss, and security office are aware of
his alcohol-related incidents. As of the date of the hearing, he testified that he had not
consumed  alcohol  for  several  months,  he  limits  himself  to  one  alcoholic  drink  during
special occasions, and he no longer consumes alcohol to socialize because “it has lost
a  majority  of  its  appeal.”  He  testified  that  he  moved  out  of  the  area  where  his  college
friends live, and he disassociated from those who have “the same drinking patterns as
they always have;” he has a long-time girlfriend who consumes alcohol responsibly; and
he realigned his social groups with individuals who share his same hobbies, to include
golf,  fishing,  and  outdoor  activities.  He  testified  that  he  learned  from  his  mistakes,  he
has no desire to find himself in the same situation again, and has no future intentions of
consuming alcohol and driving. (Tr. at 22-60; GE 2, 7; AE A, B, D).
Applicant’s  first  witness,  a  former  member  of  the  U.S.  military,  testified  that  he
has  known  Applicant  since  Applicant  came  to  work  for  his  group  in  2013.  He  testified
that he was aware of Applicant’s DWI and interlock violations. He testified that Applicant
was promoted in December 2018, becoming one of two senior engineers on a team of
10  to  12.  He  testified  that  Applicant  has  served  as  a  mentor  and  group  leader,
responsible  for  training  new  team  members.  He  described  Applicant  as  a  model
employee and his “go-to-guy” in the office and on temporary duty overseas. He testified
that  he  has  socialized  with  Applicant  after  work  and  he  described  Applicant  as  a
“professional” during these occasions. (Tr. at 20, 42-43, 60-78; AE A, C, E).
Applicant’s  second  witness,  a  security  engineer  for  a  DOD  contractor  and
Applicant’s high-school friend, testified that he, too, was aware of Applicant’s DWI and
interlock  violations.  He  described  Applicant  as  an  upstanding  person  and  believed
Applicant  has  since  matured.  Numerous  character  references  attested  to  Applicant’s
trustworthiness and reliability. (Tr. at 20, 42-43, 60-78; AE A, C, E).
",True
"Applicant  is  a  61-year-old  staff  engineer  currently  employed  by  a  government
contractor  since  2005.  He  previously  worked  for  various  government  contractors  from
1979 to 2005. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1979. Applicant is twice divorced, and
is currently unmarried. He has held a security clearance since 1980.
The SOR alleges Applicant was charged with public intoxication in 2008; driving
while  intoxicated  (DWI)  in  2011;  and  DWI  2nd  offense  in  2016.  Additionally,  the  SOR
alleges he has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to intoxication, from 1975 to at
least May 2018. Applicant admitted the criminal charges, with  some explanations, and
denied the consumption allegation because it is overbroad.
In November 2008, Applicant was intoxicated after drinking at a bar. He was cited
for public intoxication as he walked to his car. The bar was about five miles from his home,
but he testified that he was only going to sit in his car to sober up. He pleaded no contest,
and was found guilty and fined.
In  May  2011,  Applicant  was  drinking  after  work  at  a  restaurant  bar  with  some
coworkers. He drove to a fast-food restaurant and was stopped for a traffic violation. He
failed a sobriety check and a breathalyzer test found that he had a .12% blood alcohol
content (BAC). He pleaded guilty in October 2011, and was sentenced to probation for
18 months, required to attend an alcohol awareness class, and abstain from alcohol. He
admitted  to  making  a  poor  decision  to  drive  while  intoxicated.  In  2014,  Applicant  was
diagnosed with diabetes.
In March 2016, Applicant was drinking with a friend at dinner. He was intoxicated
and caused an accident as he drove home. He was arrested and his BAC tested at .13%.
He  claimed  his  low  blood-sugar  levels  caused  tunnel  vision  that  contributed  to  the
accident, along with the alcohol. He was placed in a pretrial diversion program, required
to use an ignition interlock device for two years, and attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
meetings. Applicant completed three AA open meetings per month for one year, and the
ignition interlock was removed in March 2018. He admitted to making a poor decision, but
he did not feel intoxicated. He also claimed his weight loss, no food, and low blood-sugar
levels  while  drinking  contributed  to  the  events  that  evening.  He  admitted  that  he  has
consumed alcohol to intoxication on occasion over the past 40 years, and has at times,
driven while intoxicated without being caught.
Applicant now drinks about once per week, and drinks to intoxication once every
four-five  weeks.  He  does  not  drink  at  home,  and  uses  a  car  service  when  drinking
elsewhere. He does not believe he has an alcohol problem and has not been evaluated
for an alcohol disorder. He attended AA open sessions but not the 12-step program, and
he does not follow their advice to abstain from drinking. He provided a statement from a
long-term  friend  who  has  socialized  with  him.  His  friend  stated  that  Applicant  mostly
declines to drink alcohol with them at dinner, and on the evening he was stopped for his
last DWI, the friend said he “appeared to be carrying himself quite well” about an hour
before.  His friend  attested to Applicant’s  honesty,  intelligence,  and  change  in direction
about drinking alcohol.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).

"Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  contractor  who  has  been  in  that  position  working  for

undergraduate  degree  in  1997,  and  his  Master’s  degree  in  2014.  (Exs.  B,  D)  He  is
married and has six children. He completed a security clearance application in 2016. He
has previously held a security clearance for about 15 years. (GX 1)
In  December  2010,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI  and
possession of an open container. (1.c) He had left a night club and was stopped for an
erratic  lane  change.  He  pled  not  guilty  and  the  charge  was  dismissed  for  lack  of
sufficient  evidence.  (GX  5,  AX  K)  Applicant  attended  alcohol  counseling  classes.  He
returned to social drinking after a period of time. (Tr. 61)
In February 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI (first offense).
He was found guilty of the charge, and as a result, was ordered to attend state alcohol
safety  action  classes,  and  his  driver’s  license  was  restricted  for  a  period  of  one  year.
(1.b)  He  paid  $275  in  fines.  Applicant  left  a  bar,  but  did  not  feel  intoxicated.  He
acknowledged that he had three to four cocktails. (GX 2)
During  his  2018  investigative  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  he  first  drank
alcohol at age 19 or 20, on the weekends at parties. He usually drank beer.  He told the
investigator  that  he  drank  at  that  time  at  home  once  a  month.  He  also  stated  that  he
would not drink and drive again. (Investigative Interview)
In August 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI–second offense in
five  years.  He  pled  guilty  to  the  DWI  and  as  a  result  he  was  ordered  to  attend  state
alcohol  safety  action  programs,  which  he  completed.  (AX  I)  His  driver’s  license  was
restricted until October 2018. (1.a) He admits that he made a poor choice that night. He
was  leaving  a  friend’s  house,  and  he  believes  he  had  three  drinks.  (Tr.  51)  At  the
hearing,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  the  2013  incident  did  not  leave  him  with  the
understanding of the magnitude of getting behind the wheel of a car after drinking. (Tr.
52) He had an ignition interlock system in place. On one occasion, he blew positive, but
it was not from drinking but rather from mouthwash. (Tr. 73)
Since  2017,  Applicant  has  not  had  a  drink.  (Tr.  52)  He  realized  after  the
completion  of  15  weeks  of  counseling  with  an  LCSW  and  the  treatment  assessment
report that noted his involvement with AA and men’s groups, combined with abstinence
that he did have a problem with alcohol which was something that was indeed impacting
his life and needed to change. (Tr. 53, AX N) He submitted the monthly progress reports
from the treatment sessions. Each one noted that Applicant was in full compliance with
the plan. (AX L) His conversations with others, such as his father and wife, convinced
him  that  he  had  to  abstain from  drinking.    (Tr.  53) He  wants  to  support his family  and
without a security clearance, he could not continue to get federal contract positions.
Applicant  signed  a  Letter  of  Intent  in  November  2018.  (AX  G)  He  signed  an
updated Letter of Intent in April 2019. (AX Q) He was credible in his testimony that he
never  drank  at  work  or  had  any  security  violations  during  his  career.  (Tr.  54)  Another
motivation to abstain from alcohol is the fact that he lost a five year contract due to the
alcohol  issues.  He  still  attends  AA  meetings.  He  has  been  attending  those  meetings
twice a week since 2017. (Tr. 77)
Since  the  2017  DWI,  Applicant  has  had  no  additional  brushes  with  the  law.  He
recognizes that his troubles were based on poor judgment that needed to be improved.
During  counseling,  he  totally  refrained from alcohol.  He  made  a  pledge  to himself  and
his family to abstain from the use of alcohol in the future. He signed two letters of intent.
Applicant  came  to  grips  with  alcohol  use  as  a  problem  in  his  life.  He  has  had  two
convictions  in  his entire  adult  life.  His family  supports him.  Applicant’s  driving  privilege
has been restored.
Applicant’s  personal  circle  of  friends  has  been  reduced  and  he  no  longer
socializes as much with those with whom he used to once abuse alcohol, preferring to
associate  with  a  more  professional  crowd.  At  present,  he  is  excelling  at  work  and
looking to continue with his challenging position.
Applicant presented four witnesses who have known him for many years and are
aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Each  stated  that  Applicant  is  a  man  of  integrity  and  is
dedicated to his family. (Tr. 19-25) One witness noted that Applicant is a changed man
and believes he is credible that Applicant will not drink in the future. (Tr. 27) Applicant’s
father, who has held a security clearance, testified that Applicant was forthright with him
and they  have  had  conversations  concerning  the  alcohol driving  incidents.  He has not
seen  his son  drink  in at  least  two  years. (Tr. 34) Applicant’s father stated  that his son
had no issues with drinking prior to the arrests. Applicant’s wife of 12 years testified that
she holds a security clearance and is aware of the alcohol arrests and convictions. She
maintains  that  there  is  no  alcohol  in  the  home  and  that  she  does  not  drink.  As  to
Applicant,  her  husband,  she  is  convinced  that  he  has  learned  a  lesson  from  the
incidents  and  realizes  that  he  has  put  his  family  in  jeopardy.  She  told  him  she  was
disappointed  in  him  and  that  he  has  to  be  a  role  model  for  the  children.  (Tr.  42)  She
knows that he is ashamed of his previous behavior. Applicant lost his clearance due to
the second alcohol incident.
Applicant  submitted  nine  letters  of  recommendation.  Each  letter  states  that
Applicant  is  an  upstanding  citizen.    He  is  described  as  an  outstanding  leader  and  a
trustworthy and reliable individual. (AX A)

"Applicant is 46 years old, not married and has no children.  She has two Master’s
degrees,  one  in  business  administration,  and  the  other  in  project  management.
(Applicant’s Exhibits C and D.)  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Project
Manager.    She  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  her
employment.
Guideline G – Alcohol Consumption
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has  engaged  in  excessive  alcohol
consumption that often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to
control  impulses,  and  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Guideline E – Personal Conduct
The Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in conduct  which shows a
lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  that
raise  questions  about  her  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  or
sensitive information.
Applicant  has  worked  for  her  current  employer  since  June  2009,  almost  ten
years.    She  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in  2007.    In  May  2010,  Applicant  was
arrested  and  charged  with  Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol  (DUI)  with  blood
alcohol  level  of  .08  or  higher.    She  explained  that  she  and  a  work  colleague  were
celebrating  a  milestone  and  went  out  to  a  restaurant  for  dinner  and  then  to  a  bar  for
drinks.    Applicant  consumed  three  glasses  of  wine  with  dinner  and  five  vodka  drinks
while  at  the  bar.    She  admits  that  after  consuming  this  amount  of  alcohol  she  was
intoxicated.    Applicant  was  pulled  over  while  driving  her  car  and  given  a  field  sobriety
test, which she failed.  Her blood alcohol level was .19%.  In about July 2010, she pled
guilty to misdemeanor DUI and was required to pay a fine, attend alcohol abuse training
and serve three years of probation.  She completed these court conditions.  She states
that she also learned not to drink and drive in the future.  She no longer goes out to bars
just to drink alcohol.  (Tr. pp. 49-51.)  Following this DUI, she abstained from drinking for
a while.  Applicant states that she now consumes alcohol about once or twice a month,
and when she drinks she has about two drinks each time, usually beer.  (Tr. p. 73.)
Although  not  alleged,  when  confronted  by  Department  Counsel  as  to  whether
she  has  a  previous  DUI  in  1996,  Applicant  admitted  that  she  had.    At  that  time,
Applicant’s blood alcohol level was a .13%.  As a result of that DUI, she was required to
attend  three  months  of  MADD  classes,  AA  meetings,  pay  a  fine  and  placed  on
probation.    Her  driver’s  license  was  suspended  and  restricted  to  allow  her  to  drive  to
work only.  (Tr. p. 69.)  Applicant complied with all of these conditions.  Applicant states
that following this DUI, she did abstain from drinking for a while.
Applicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes her use of marijuana from
about  January  1996  to  about  June  2004;  cocaine  use  from  about  June  1995  to  about
December  2002,  and  in  October  2015;  and  ecstasy  in  January  2016,  while  holding  a
security clearance.
Applicant  used  marijuana  from  January  1996  to  about  June  2004.    At  the
beginning, she used it about once a day.  It tapered off as her group of friends changed.
She  stopped  using  it  in  2004,  because  she  was  going  to  school  to  get  her  Master’s
degree.    She  last  used  marijuana  in  2004  while  she  was  in  Amsterdam.    She  did  not
hold a security clearance at the time.  She use it with a group of friends.  She no longer
uses marijuana because it stopped being desirable to her.  (Tr. p. 63.)
She  also  used  cocaine  from  June  1995  to  about  December  2002.    She  states
that she used it during this period about five times.  From 2002 to 2015, Applicant states
that  she  did  not  use  cocaine  because  she  lost  interest  in  it  and  no  longer  associated
with her friends that used it.  (Tr. p. 54.)  Applicant use cocaine again in October 2015.
She explained that she was at a party at a friend’s house.  Some people were going into
the  garage  randomly  and  she  wandered  in  to  see  what  was  going  on.    A  friend  of  a
friend,  who  Applicant  does  not  know,  had  some  cocaine  and  Applicant  used  some.
Applicant  states that  it  never occurred  to  her that  she  held a  security  clearance  at  the
time and should not be using illegal drugs.  She states that she has never worked in a
classified  area  and  never  used  her  clearance.    She  did  not  enjoy  the  experience  and
regretted using it.  She no longer puts herself in those environments.
In  January  2016,  while  holding  a  security  clearance,  Applicant  used  ecstasy  on
one  occasion.    She  was  in  Las  Vegas  with  a  friend  of  hers,  and  his  group  of  friends
were all using ecstasy.  They were getting ready to go out for the evening to a concert
and  Applicant  was  offered  some.    She  did  not  feel  pressured  to  use  it,  and  again  her
security clearance was not in the forefront of her mind at the time.  She states that she
has no intention of ever using ecstasy again.
Applicant  executed  two  sworn  statements  of  intent  promising  never  to  abuse
alcohol  or  any  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.    In  the  event  that  she  does,  her  security
clearance is subject to immediate revocation.  (Applicant’s Exhibits E and F.)
Applicant  states  that  she  now  realizes  the  seriousness  involved  in  holding  a
security clearance.  Although she possessed a security clearance at the time she used
cocaine  and  ecstasy  in  the  past,  she  did  not  use  her  clearance  to  access  classified
information, and so she did not take the matter seriously.  Applicant states that she now
understands  the  responsibilities  and  obligations  that  come  with  holding  a  security
clearance.  This situation has been an eye-opener for her and she believes that she is
“scared  straight.”    (Tr.  p.  68.)    Applicant  does  not  believe  that  her  employer  has  a
separate (company) drug policy that prevents the use of illegal drugs.
Two witnesses testified on Applicant’s behalf.  A principal systems engineer who
works  with  the  Navy  met  Applicant  while  taking  a  Master’s  course  class  before  2007.
He interacts with her once a month and talks with her once every two weeks.  He states
that  she  is  responsible  and  reliable  and  he  has  no  reservations  about  her  holding  a
security clearance.  They started hanging out socially in 2007 when he moved back to
the city.  She educated him on “good beer” in the city at the time.  (Tr.pp.  21 - 33.)
The  other  witness,  a  senior  project  engineer,  stated  that  she  has  known  the
Applicant for several years, they interact daily, and they are friends.  She described the
Applicant  as  a  motivated  employee  who  goes  above  and  beyond  her  job  to  complete
her  responsibilities.    She  is  considered  to  be  a  caring,  trustworthy,  honest,  and
dedicated  employee.    The  writer  does  not  believe  the  Applicant’s  past  actions  are  a
threat  to  the  national  security  of  the  United  States,  and  she  recommends  Applicant’s
retention of her security clearance.  (Tr. pp. 45 - 68)
Performance evaluations of the Applicant for the periods from 2013 through 2018
all  are  favorable  and  indicate  that  she  either  “meets”  her  job  requirements,  or  “highly”
meets her job requirements in every instance.  (Applicant’s Exhibit G.)
Letters  of  recommendation  from  previous  coworkers,  friends,  and  professional
colleagues of the Applicant attest to her integrity, honesty and trustworthiness.  She is
described as intelligent, loyal and responsible.   One letter also indicates that Applicant,
in  execution  of  her  duties,  has  been  exposed  to  sensitive  information.    (Applicant’s
Exhibits I and M.)
A  Substance  Abuse  evaluation  of  the  Applicant  prepared  by  a  certified  alcohol
and  drug  counselor dated  November 28,  2018,  indicates  that  Applicant does not meet
the criteria of substance abuse at that time, although her past consumption resulted in
serious  legal  consequences.    Her  current  consumption  of  alcohol  at  that  time  was  in
normal limits, however she is encouraged to self-monitor her consumption bi-annually.
The report also indicates that Applicant’s alcohol-abuse history involves being drunk to
intoxication  about  50  times  in  her  lifetime.  She has  blacked out from  drinking  at  least
four times in her life.  She reported vomiting from drinking two times in her life and her
pattern of consumption was bi-weekly and she would consume four drinks.  (Applicant’s
Exhibit L.)

November 30, 2018.  (Applicant’s Exhibit J.)

instead of opting for alternate safe transportation. (Answer) Applicant is remorseful and
stated that he had been drinking beer and he was just over the legal limit. (Tr. 29)

"Applicant  is  a  26-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance for the first time.  He  is seeking  eligibility  for access to  classified  information
for his job as a program analyst for a large company in the defense industry. His formal
education  includes  a bachelor’s  degree awarded  in  2015, and  he  is currently  pursuing
an MBA degree. (Exhibit H) He has never married and has no children.
The  SOR  alleges,  and  Applicant  admits,  five  alcohol-related  incidents  that
resulted  in  citation,  arrest,  charge,  or  conviction  over  a  five-year  period  during  2012-
2017.  (Exhibits  1,  4-8,  and  Exhibits  A  and  B)  He  also  described  the  facts  and
circumstances  surrounding  each  incident  in  his  hearing  testimony.  These  matters  are
discussed briefly below.
The first two incidents, essentially underage drinking, occurred in 2012 when he
was  a  19-year-old  college  student.  In  April  2012  he  was  cited  by  university  police  for
criminal damage and minor with alcohol in body after an incident where he seriously cut
his wrist on broken glass from his dorm-room window. (Exhibit 6) He pleaded guilty, was
placed on a diversion program, and was required to attend an alcohol-education class.
About  seven  months  later in  December 2012,  while  still  age  19, he  drank  alcohol at a
party and was subsequently one of several passengers in a car that was stopped by the
police.  The  police  officer  smelled  alcohol  and  required  everyone,  since  they  were
minors, to take a breathalyzer test.  He received a citation for minor with alcohol in the
body. He pleaded guilty, paid a small fine, and was required to attend another alcohol-
education class.
The third incident occurred about two years later in August 2014 when he was a
21-year-old  college  student.  He  spent  the  night  in  jail  after  he  was  arrested  for  the
offenses  of  public nuisance-obstruction of  property  and failure  to  obey  a police  officer.
The  incident  occurred when  he  was  walking  home under the  influence of alcohol after
attending a social gathering at a bar with fellow interns who were celebrating the end of
their internships at a large, well-known financial services firm. He was represented by a
public defender, he pleaded guilty to the public nuisance offense, and he was ordered to
pay a $250 fine.
The fourth incident occurred less than a year later in April 2015, shortly before he
graduated from college at age 22. He was arrested and charged with the felony offense
of  aggravated  assault  of  a  peace  officer  (non-serious  injury)  based  on  spitting  in  the
officer’s  face.  (Exhibit  7)  This  incident  stems  from  an  evening  at  a  restaurant  with  his
then girlfriend and other friends. He and his girlfriend returned to her apartment where
they had a noisy disagreement that caused someone to call the police. He was initially
detained by the police while walking home to his nearby apartment.
The  police  report  described  Applicant  as  quite  intoxicated;  his  speech  was
slurred; the odor of alcohol was strong; the effects of alcohol were obvious; his attitude
was  combative;  and  he  was  wearing  blue  jeans  without  a  shirt.  (Exhibit  7)  The  police
report  further  described  him  as  failing  to  follow  instructions  to  remain  seated  on  the
curb;  demanding  to  know  what  he  was  being  charged  with;  cursing  and  insulting  the
police officer; and then spitting in the officer’s face striking the officer on the right cheek
bone below the eye. At the hearing, Applicant stated that he spat in the direction of the
officer. (Tr. 48) In his November 2017 security clearance application, he explained that
he “accidentally spat in the direction of another person with no foul intentions.” (Exhibit
1)  At  the  hearing,  he  explained  his  characterization  of  the  spitting  incident  as
“accidental” was due to oversight, an explanation I find to be not credible. (Tr. 75-78)
With  assistance  of  counsel,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  attempted  assault.  The
court  sentenced  him  to  serve  probation  for  18  months  and  attend  alcohol-education
classes.  In  September  2016,  the  state  court  terminated  his  probation  after  12  months
and ordered that the case be designated a misdemeanor. (Exhibit A)
The fifth incident occurred in June 2017 when he was 24 years old and had been
working for his current employer for about a year. He was arrested for driving under the
influence of alcohol (DUI) and criminal damage after crashing his car into a cinder-block
wall near his home. (Exhibit 8) After failing a series of field sobriety tests, he refused to
take a preliminary breath test. He did submit to a blood alcohol test at the police station.
The  police  report  described,  among  other  things,  that  Applicant  initially  ignored  the
commands  of  and  walked  away  from  a  police  officer,  resulting  in  the  officer  grabbing
him  “by  the  arm  and  neck  area  and  escort[ing]  him  to  the  ground  by  pulling  him
downwards” and handcuffing him behind his back. (Exhibit 8, page 13 of 16)
Applicant  reported  the  incident  to  his  employer’s  facility  security  officer  (FSO).
(Exhibit 5) The final adverse information report indicates he was charged with failure to
notify  owner  or  person  in  charge  of  striking  a  fixture;  DUI  based  on  liquor,  drugs,  or
vapors; criminal damage; DUI liquor BAC .08 or more; and DUI extreme BAC .15 - .19.
With assistance of counsel, he pleaded guilty to a DUI offense to the slightest degree at
or around .08 BAC. The court imposed a fine and sentenced him to serve 30 days in jail
with 28 days suspended. He served 48 hours in a short-term holding facility. The court
also  imposed  probation  for  12  months  and  required  an  alcohol/substance  abuse
evaluation. He attended and completed 16-hours of level-two DUI education in October
2017. (Exhibit E) He attended and completed a MADD victim-impact panel in November
2017.  (Exhibit  D)  He  attended  and  completed  a  traffic-survival  school  in  December
2017. (Exhibit C) He did not recall if he had received any type of diagnosis regarding his
use of alcohol. (Tr. 55-56) In May 2018, less than a year from his DUI arrest, the court
granted Applicant’s application and motion to set aside the judgment and conviction for
DUI. (Exhibit B; Tr. 55)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  took  full  responsibility  for  his  alcohol-related  offenses
and  acknowledged  a  serious  lack  of  judgment.  (Tr.  38)  He  expressed  remorse  for  his
misconduct and a desire to learn from those experiences so they do not  recur. (Tr. 38-
39) He stated that the last 24 months were a “transformational period” in his life, as he
is  working  to  develop  good  judgment  and  sound  decision-making  skills.  (Tr.  39)  His
ultimate goal is to abstain from alcohol given the difficulties it has caused him. (Tr. 58)
He stated his recent use of alcohol as occurring on May 23, 2018, May 5, 2018, and the
end of March 2018, noting that he can count on one hand how many times he had used
alcohol  in  the  past  six  months.  (Tr.  56)  He  has  a  strategy  or  plan  to  avoid  situations
where alcohol is served, and also strictly limiting himself to no more than one alcoholic
drink. (Tr. 56) And he will not consume any alcohol if he is driving an automobile. (Tr.
56-57)
Applicant  has  a  good  employment  record.  (Exhibits  F,  G,  and  H)  For  example,
his  current  supervisor  described  him  as  conscientious,  diligent,  motivated,  self-driven,
honest, forthright, dependable, and mature. (Exhibit H) Applicant is an active participant
in  community  activities  as  a  volunteer.  (Exhibit  H)  He  also  submitted  several  highly
favorable letters of recommendation on his behalf. (Exhibits F and H)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt

‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).
2 484 U.S. at 531.
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6

together,  because  they  are  based  on  the  same  five  alcohol-related  incidents.  Under
Guideline G for alcohol consumption,  the suitability of an applicant may be questioned
or put into doubt because, as set forth in AG ¶ 21, excessive alcohol consumption often
lead  to  the  exercise  of  questionable  judgment  or the failure to  control impulses,  and  it
can  raise  questions  about  a  person  reliability  and  trustworthiness.  Likewise,  under
Guideline J for criminal conduct, the suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put
into doubt when that applicant  has a history of involvement with criminal conduct. The
overall concern as set forth in AG ¶ 30 is aptly put: “By its very nature, [criminal conduct]
calls  into  question  a  person’s  ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and
regulations.”
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while
under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,
or  other  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  the  frequency  of  the
individual’s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with
alcohol use disorder;
AG  ¶  22(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of
impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with
alcohol use disorder;
3 484 U.S. at 531.
4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶ 23(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent,
or  it  happened  under  such  unusual  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to
recur  or  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,
trustworthiness, or judgment;
AG ¶ 31(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would
be  unlikely  to  affect  a  national  security  eligibility  decision,  but  which  in
combination  cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  judgment,  reliability,  or
trustworthiness;
AG ¶ 31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an
admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of
whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;
AG  ¶  32(a)  so  much  time  has  elapsed  since  the  criminal  behavior
happened,  or  it  happened  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is
unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  reliability,
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and
AG ¶ 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not
limited  to,  the  passage  of  time  without  recurrence  of  criminal  activity,
restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or
higher  education,  good  employment  record,  or  constructive  community
involvement.
The  key  facts  here  are  not  in  dispute.  Applicant  was  involved  in  five  alcohol-
related incidents of criminal conduct over a five-year period. The last incident, the DUI
offense,  was  adjudicated  in  2017  and  concluded  with  the  court  setting  aside  the  DUI
conviction  in  May  2018,  about  13  months  before  the  hearing  in  this  case.  All  the
incidents involved alcohol, the last of which resulted in damage to private property, his
and  others.  Three  of  the  incidents  involved  behavior  where  Applicant  was  belligerent,
disobedient,  or  disrespectful  (or  all  three)  when  interacting  with  police  officers.  In  the
2015 incident, in which he was quite intoxicated, Applicant spat in the face of the police
officer, which I find to be despicable behavior. The disqualifying conditions noted above
apply.
Applicant presented a decent case in mitigation. I took into consideration all the
evidence in mitigation, including his explanations for the five alcohol-related incidents as
well as the evidence of rehabilitation. The evidence of reform and rehabilitation includes
higher education (the current MBA program), his good employment record, his favorable
references,  his  self-report  of  the  2017  DUI,  and  the  passage  of  time  since  the  June
2017 DUI incident without recurrence of criminal activity. He also reduced and modified
his consumption of alcohol with the ultimate goal to abstain. And he demonstrated some
insight and self-reflection concerning his circumstances.
Nevertheless,  the  frequency  and  seriousness  of  Applicant’s  alcohol-related
incidents  weigh  heavily  against  him.  Multiple  incidents  of  alcohol-related  criminal
conduct over a five-year period are obviously problematic because they demonstrate a
pattern  of  behavior,  suggesting  another  alcohol-related  incident  is  likely  to  recur.  In
addition, his last two alcohol-related incidents, in 2015 and 2017, were neither minor nor
trivial  matters.  His  disrespectful  attitude  toward  police  officers  is  troubling  and  speaks
volumes.  Taken  together,  the  evidence  of  Applicant’s  alcohol-related  criminal  conduct
calls  into  question  his  current  ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and
regulations. It also calls into question his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.
Simply  stated,  it  is  too  soon  to  tell  if  he  will  continue  responsible  use  of  alcohol  and
conduct himself as a law-abiding person.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he
has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline G:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a -- 1.e:
Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline J:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph 2.a:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. Eligibility denied.

"Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact:  Applicant is 52 years old. In March 1990, he enlisted in the U.S. Army.
Applicant  received  serious  injuries  from  a  parachute  malfunction,  and  he  received  an
honorable discharge in November 1993 for medical reasons.  He earned an associate’s
degree  in  2013.  He  has  never  been  married  and  he  does  not  have  any  children.  In
October  2014,  he  was  employed  by  a  DOD  contractor  as  a  customer  service
representative serving veterans. (Tr. 12-15; GE 1; AE A)
(SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant was arrested in March 2008 for driving under the influence
(DUI). His driver’s license was suspended, he was placed on one year of probation, and
required to attend an alcohol education course.
Applicant  started  drinking  alcohol  as  a  teenager.
In  1993,  his  drinking
escalated  after  he  sustained  the  injuries  in  the  U.S.  Army.  He  also  used  alcohol
as  a  coping mechanism for his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). His choice of
alcohol  is  beer  and  bourbon.  At  the  time  of  his  first  alcohol-related  arrest  in  2008,
Applicant  was  drinking  excessively  on  the  weekends  only.  He  had  been  at  a  friend’s
house drinking, and on his way home he was pulled over by the police. His breathalyzer
registered .11%. Applicant admitted that his drinking pattern did not change much after
his  probation  ended,  and  he  eventually  started  drinking  during  the  week  after  he  left
work. He admitted that over time his alcohol increased to daily use. (Tr. 16- 22, 40-41;
GE 1; GE 2)
(SOR  ¶  1.b)  Applicant  was  arrested  in  November  2015,  and  charged  with
DUI. Applicant admitted drinking alcohol to excess. He was about 40 miles away from
home  on  a  Saturday  night,  and  he  was  involved  in  a  single  car  accident  while  driving
home.  The  police  arrived  and  he  refused  to  take  a  breathalyzer  test.  He  pled  guilty  to
the DUI charge and  he  lost  his  driver’s  license  for  three  months.  He  was  ordered  to
attend  an  alcohol education course. Initially, Applicant changed his drinking pattern and
did not go out on the weekends, but over time, he found that he was drinking again on a
daily basis. (Tr. 23-27; GE 1; GE 2; GE 3)
(SOR ¶ 1.c) Applicant was arrested in June 2017, and charged with DUI. He was
sentenced to two weeks in jail, his driver’s license was suspended, and he was required
to install an interlock device in his vehicle for 18 months. Applicant was ordered to attend
alcohol counseling on a weekly basis for one year. Prior to this 2017 arrest, Applicant ate
dinner and had a few drinks on his way home from work. His one-way travel time from his
house  to  his  job  is  an  hour-and-a-half  drive.  The  American  Legion  is  about  half-way
between the job site and his home. He was pulled over by the police for veering over the
marked line, and he refused to take a breathalyzer test. The DUI charge was considered
a second offense, and he was required to serve 14 days in jail. Applicant stated that his
two-week  jail  sentence  caused  him  to  hit  “rock  bottom.”  He  realized  that  he  could  no
longer drink alcohol  at  his current  rate.  After  the  18-month  interlock  device  period  had
expired, Applicant requested to keep the device in his vehicle. He later received a letter
from  the  state  advising  him  that  he  needed  to  return  the  interlock  device,  which  was
removed in December 2018. (Tr. 27-31; GE 1; GE 2; GE 3)
(SOR ¶ 1.d) Applicant received alcohol treatment at a counseling facility from July
2017  to  “present”  (August  2018),  for  a  condition  diagnosed  as  Alcohol  Use  Disorder
(mild). According to the counselor, Applicant responded well to treatment and maintained
total abstinence while enrolled in the program, which was not a requirement. As a result
of his progress and meeting all treatment goals, Applicant was released from the program
early. (Tr. 31-35; GE 1; GE 2; AE B)
Since the fall of 2017, Applicant reported that he has consumed alcohol less than
six times total, and always in a social setting. He no longer drinks and drives. He no longer
feels  an  urge  to  drink  alcohol.  He  stated  that  if  he  thought  alcohol  was  becoming  a
problem for him, he would immediately report to his alcohol counselor or the Veterans
Administration (VA) chaplain. Since 1993, Applicant also received treatment from the VA
for  PTSD  and  pain  management.  He  does  not  take  any  habit  forming  prescription
medications, and his medical issues are controlled with the medication. (Tr. 34-39)
Applicant’s program manager submitted a letter of recommendation. He stated that
Applicant is efficient, detailed oriented, and was chosen over his peers to provide training
to  new  customer  service  representatives.  He  is  a  valued  employee,  and  the  program
manager recommended he be granted a security clearance in order that Applicant can
continue to serve our military veterans with his outstanding customer service. (AE A)
",True
"Applicant is 42 years old and married for two years. His wife is Thai, and continues
to live in Thailand. He has received an associate’s degree. He has worked for his current
employer  since  2015  and  wishes  to  retain  national  security  eligibility  for  a  security
clearance  in  connection  with  that  employment.  Applicant  has  worked  for  various
contractors  at  the  same  remote  location  outside  the  United  States  since  2005.
(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 17; Tr. 30-33.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Applicant admitted the single SOR allegation under this paragraph, with explanations.
Applicant admitted that he did not file his Federal or state income tax returns in a
timely fashion for the tax years 2010 through 2017. Since Applicant was living and working
outside the United States during the entire time at issue here, his taxable income was low
enough  to  exempt  him  from  paying  taxes.  However,  that  did  not  mean  Applicant  was
exempt from filing tax returns. He stated, “I guess I thought that if I owed nothing - - owed
no taxes - - that it wouldn’t be much of a problem that I could just kind of file a few years
together.” He further stated that all of his tax returns have now been filed. His testimony
was vague as to how and when all of the subject Federal and state tax returns were filed,
stating that several years may have been filed together. Applicant further indicated that
he was a procrastinator when it came to fulfilling his tax return responsibilities. Finally,
Applicant  admitted  that  he  has  knowns  since  December  2015  of  the  Government’s
concern with regard to his failure to file tax returns. (Tr. 14-22, 41-42; Government Exhibit
1 at Section 26, Exhibit 2 at 10.)
Subsequent to the hearing, Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibit A, consisting of
a group of U.S. mail return receipts, e-filing information, extension of time to file tax return
information, and contact information for his tax preparer. It appears from the exhibit that
his  2014  and  2018  tax  returns  were  filed  electronically,  albeit  late.  The  return  receipts
from both the IRS and his state taxing authority are from 2015, 2017, and 2018. It is not
possible to know, from the documents he submitted, what specific returns were included
in each mailing.
Paragraph 2 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he abuses intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this
paragraph, with explanations.
Applicant has a long history of alcohol abuse. As stated, he has worked at a remote
location for many years and drinking was his leisure-time activity. Until just recently he
would  drink  five  to  six  drinks  each  weekend  day.  Applicant’s  wife  became  pregnant  in
early 2019 and Applicant testified that, because of the pregnancy, he stopped drinking
altogether in about April 2019. (Tr. 23, 27-28.)
Applicant has had several alcohol-related incidents. In 2016 Applicant passed out
from excessive alcohol consumption at least three times. One of these occasions was in
a public place. In addition, in 2017, Applicant again passed out in public from excessive
alcohol  consumption.  A  passerby  found  Applicant  and  called  911.  Police  and  an
ambulance  responded  and  Applicant  was  transported  to  the  base  medical  clinic.  He
received a citation for public intoxication from the local police and paid a fine. (Tr. 22, 27;
Government Exhibit 2 at 8-9.)
There is evidence that Applicant was sent home from work at least once in 2016
for coming  to  work with  alcohol on  his breath.  Applicant  denied  knowledge  of  such an
event,  but  his  second-level  supervisor  testified  that  it  did  happen  and  Applicant  was
cautioned not to have it happen again. (Tr. 25-26, 42, 49-51.)
Paragraph 3 (Guideline B. Foreign Influence)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has foreign connections that may subject him to foreign influence or coercion.
Applicant admitted both allegations under this guideline.
As stated, Applicant has been married for two years to a Thai national. His wife,
who  is 34,  continues  to  reside  in Thailand, where  she  is pregnant  with  their first  child.
Applicant  met  his  wife  in  Thailand  in  approximately  2008.  They  dated  for  nine  years,
primarily through the internet, until they were married in May 2017. Due to the nature of
Applicant’s job, he is only able to visit his wife in Thailand twice a year for a period of
about 30 days each time. Spouses are not allowed to live at Applicant’s  work location.
Applicant and his wife communicate daily over the internet. (Tr. 31-34.)
Applicant’s wife works as a loan officer at a credit union in Thailand. Her mother is
a farmer. Applicant’s wife has two sisters, both of whom she is helping support. Applicant
has little contact with his wife’s mother or sisters. (Tr. 35-38.)
Mitigation
Applicant served honorably in the Marine Corps for four years, from 1995 to 1999.
He held a Secret clearance during that time. (Tr. 40.)
Applicant’s second-level supervisor testified on Applicant’s behalf. He has known
Applicant for several years and recommended him for a security clearance. However, the
witness also indicated a lack of direct knowledge about the alcohol-related incidents in
Applicant’s past described earlier in this decision. (Tr. 44-56.)
Thailand
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts:  Thailand  is  a  constitutional
monarchy,  ruled  by  an  interim  military  government  since  2014.  The  United  States  has
urged  the  restoration  of  elected  civilian  government  and  return  to  democracy  through
elections.  Human  rights  issues  in  Thailand  include  unlawful  or  arbitrary  killings  by  the
government or its agents; torture; arbitrary arrest and detention; censorship; restrictions
on political participation; and corruption. Thailand is a key U.S. security ally in Asia, and
the country’s stability and growth are important to the maintenance of peace in the region.
Since  World  War  II,  the  United  States  and  Thailand  have  significantly  expanded
diplomatic, security, and commercial relations.
When evaluating an applicant’s national security eligibility, the administrative judge
must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations
",True
"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 56-year-old senior designer, who has been employed by a defense
contractor since August 1990. He was granted a confidential-level security clearance in
July 1991, and he has held a secret-level clearance since September 1996. His clearance
was renewed most recently in August 2008. (GE 2; Tr. 44-45.)
Applicant has had several ex-wives and girlfriends. He and his fourth wife remarried
in August 2019. (Tr. 79.) Applicant has an adult daughter from his first marriage and two
adopted adult children from his second marriage. (GEs 2-3, 15-16, 19.)
Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in June 1981 (SOR ¶
2.a). He had consumed 12 beers while driving around. He was fined $50 and ordered to
attend a DWI school. In August 1982, he was charged with public intoxication after sharing
24 beers with a friend (SOR ¶ 2.b). He forfeited a $35 bond for being drunk in public. (GEs
6, 20- 21.)
In April 1988, Applicant and his first wife divorced after three years of marriage,
partially because of his drinking. On May 15, 1988, his ex-wife complained to the police
that he had assaulted her (pushed her, struck her across the face, knocked her to the
ground, and threatened to kill her). The police noticed scratches on her neck and other
signs that she had been assaulted. Two days later, Applicant was arrested and booked into
the county jail on a peace bond complaint of intent to murder his ex-wife (SOR ¶ 2.c). In
the jail, he exhibited signs of polysubstance abuse, and he admitted he had consumed 24
beers before his arrest (SOR ¶ 4.a). He posted a bond of $2,000 on May 23, 1988, and
was released from custody. On June 8, 1988, he pled guilty to assault by contact on his ex-
wife and was fined $200 plus costs. (GEs 6, 21.) Applicant testified at his hearing that his
ex-wife “broke into the house.” (Tr. 62.)
In September 1988, Applicant married his second wife, and one month later, he
enlisted in the U.S. military. On April 22, 1989, he was arrested for breach of peace and
third degree assault after he started a fight with another person at a local motel (SOR ¶
2.d). Applicant was intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol when he was arrested. (GE
7.) During a subject interview with a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) special agent in
May  1989,  Applicant  volunteered  that  he  had  consumed  eight  to  ten  mixed  drinks
containing vodka before the incident and that he was fined $35. He also reported an arrest
in May 1989 for malicious damage (SOR ¶ 2.e). After consuming a gallon of vodka at a
concert,  he  started  an  argument  and  dented  the  hood  of  the  victim’s  vehicle.  He  was
required to pay $200 in restitution and $43 in court fees. (GE 21.)
At  the  request  of  his  military  command,  Applicant  was  evaluated  at  his  base’s
counseling and assistance center on May 22, 1989. He acknowledged responsibility for two
pre-service alcohol-related incidents for which he had a pre-service waiver. He indicated
that he had been drinking regularly since age 16, and that his drinking had doubled while in
the military. He expressed a desire to abstain from alcohol, and reported drinking more
than intended, loss of control, increasing tolerance, and some withdrawal symptoms. The
screener opined that Applicant was “psychologically dependent” on alcohol and that he
was likely to continue to abuse alcohol unless he completed Level III inpatient treatment. It
was  recommended  that  he  attend  a  minimum  of  three  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings  per  week  and  be  placed  on  a  supervised  Antabuse  program  in  the  interim.
Applicant satisfactorily completed a 36-hour alcohol and drug education course on June
23,  1989.  On  June  29,  1989,  he  was  processed  for  disqualification  from  his  military
program because of his alcohol problem and was advised that failure to complete the Level
III drug and alcohol abuse program would be grounds for his separation from the military.
(GE 5.)
On his admission to the Level III program in July 1989, Applicant was diagnosed
with substance abuse disorder (SOR ¶ 4.b). He reported a significant increase in tolerance
since January 1989. He was admitted to a structured program of group therapy, individual
counseling, and education with a strong AA component. He was cautious at first but was
later able to identify factors impacting his alcohol use and to initiate actions to address his
problem. He was active in developing his aftercare plan, which included meeting with his
command’s drug and alcohol program advisor on a weekly basis for one year; participating
in a 12-step program; submitting to urinalysis screening at least four times per month for
one year; and attending a formal aftercare group two hours a week for 12 weeks. He was
returned to active duty in August 1989 with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. (GE 5.)
Applicant and his second wife divorced in early November 1989. (GEs 1-2.) On
November 9, 1989, Applicant was evaluated by a military clinical psychologist because of
suicidal ideation. He reported abstinence from alcohol since August 1989 with the help of
nightly AA meetings, but admitted that he had started thinking about suicide about two
months prior. He exhibited a depressed mood with a constricted affect. He was diagnosed
with alcohol dependence (alcoholism) in remission, and avoidant personality traits, but
found fit for full duty. He was advised to obtain an AA sponsor and to receive group and
individual  therapy  through  the  command’s  psychiatry  department.  In  December  1989,
Applicant  was  dis-enrolled  from  his  weekly  aftercare  group  for  failing  to  show  for  a
scheduled session for the second time. (GE 5.) Applicant was discharged from his military
service obligation in March 1990. (GE 1.)
Applicant was married to his third wife from June 1992 to October 1995. (GEs 1-2.)
There is no evidence that he had any legal or substance abuse problems during that time.
In December 1995, Applicant was arrested for threatening, breach of peace, bigotry, and
assault  on  a  police  officer  (SOR  ¶  2.f).  (GE  8.)  No  details  are  in  evidence  about  the
offense.
Applicant  and  his  fourth  wife  married  in  June  1997,  but  they  separated  around
October 2000 or 2001 and were divorced in approximately 2006. (GEs 1, 22.) In February
2005,  he  was  arrested  for  his  own  safety  following  an  incident  involving  a  girlfriend.
Applicant appeared to be suicidal. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital (SOR ¶ 1.b),
where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He indicated during a June 2006 interview
with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he spent four days in the
hospital (GE 22), although he reported to a clinical provider in 2012 that he was in the
hospitalized for two weeks in 2005. (GE 17.) Applicant was charged with possession of a
loaded handgun and domestic violence for the incident involving his girlfriend (SOR ¶ 2.g),
but the charges were nolle prossed in March 2005. (GEs 3, 22.)
While on a temporary work assignment for his current employer in approximately
July 2005, a co-worker told Applicant that he should try marijuana to relax.  Applicant took
one or two puffs from a marijuana cigarette offered him by the co-worker. From November
2005 to 2006, Applicant used marijuana with the son of his current spouse. Applicant liked
the effect, but did not use any marijuana for the next three years. (GE 22.)
To renew his security clearance, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National
Security Positions (SF 86) on December 5, 2005. He indicated that he had consulted with a
mental  health  professional  from  February  2005  to  June  2005,  and  that  he  had  been
arrested in February 2005 for possession of a loaded handgun and domestic violence for
which  he  had  to  complete  violence  education  classes.  He  responded  negatively  to  an
inquiry concerning whether he had illegally used any controlled substance in the last seven
years (SOR ¶ 5.b). (GE 1.) When he answered the SOR, Applicant denied falsifying his SF
86, stating that he had not used marijuana in the seven years preceding the application.
After it was pointed out to Applicant at his hearing that his reported use of marijuana in July
2005 predated his December 2005 SF 86, Applicant explained that he “was thinking it was
backwards,” i.e., that his drug use occurred after he completed his SF 86. (Tr. 70.)
From 2009 to the spring of 2015, Applicant used marijuana with acquaintances he
met  while  playing  disc  golf.  Between  the  spring  of  2015  and  February  2016,  he  used
marijuana  with  his  wife’s  son  on  four  occasions.  Applicant  was  usually  provided  the
marijuana that he used, but a few times he contributed money towards its cost. (GE 22.)
In January 2012, Applicant began taking several psychiatric medications prescribed
for him by his primary care physician. On October 19, 2012, Applicant sought treatment
from  a  behavioral  health  service,  complaining  of  anxiety  and  depression.  He  reported
sobriety from alcohol for the past 23 years. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and
referred for treatment at a psychiatric hospital. (GE 19; Tr. 50-51.)  Applicant was formally
discharged from the behavioral health service on January 3, 2013, for failure to attend any
sessions beyond the initial assessment. (GE 20.)
Applicant began treatment at the psychiatric hospital on November 12, 2012, four
days after the death of his sister (SOR ¶ 1.b). He reported a history of depression with
outbursts  of  anger  and  deterioration  of  his  condition  for  about  a  year.  He  denied  any
drinking  since  1989,  but  admitted  experiencing  suicidal  ideation  daily.  Applicant  was
treated for four days in the facility’s partial hospitalization program (PHP) and twelve days
in its intensive outpatient program (IOP). Random screens were negative for alcohol (he
reported attending AA) but positive for marijuana (SOR ¶ 3.b). After acknowledging that he
needed to stop seeing his friends who use marijuana, he reported a relapse of marijuana
use  on  December  19,  2012.  At  his  discharge  on  December  21,  2012,  Applicant  was
diagnosed on Axis I with bipolar I disorder – severe without psychotic feat – depressed;
PTSD;  cannabis  abuse  –  unspecified;  ADHD  not  otherwise  specified;  and  alcohol
dependence  in  sustained  full  remission.  He  was  diagnosed  on  Axis  II  with  antisocial
personality disorder. At discharge, Applicant was assessed at low risk for harm to self or
others.  Aftercare  plans  included  follow-up  with  the  behavioral  health  service  and
pharmacological management. (GE 17.) There is no evidence that he engaged in aftercare
treatment at that time other than medication management by his primary care doctor.
On  January  13,  2014,  Applicant  sought  treatment  in  a  hospital’s  emergency
department for depression and thoughts of suicide. He was discharged to follow up in the
hospital’s PHP, where he received treatment from January 16, 2014, to March 7, 2014, for
his diagnosed bipolar disorder I, PTSD, and attention deficit disorder (ADD). He reported
on admission to the PHP that he had been using marijuana for eight years, although not
within the past ten days. His attendance in the program was sporadic, but he reported no
use of marijuana while in the program. On his discharge, he was given a good prognosis
provided he followed up with recommended counseling. (GE 15.)
On March 20, 2014, he began psychotherapy three times a week with a licensed
clinical social worker (LCSW), who diagnosed him on Axis I with major depressive affective
disorder  –  recurrent  episode,  moderate  degree;  PTSD;  and  alcohol  dependence  in
remission. Applicant told the LCSW he was not using any marijuana and had abstained
from alcohol for the last 25 years. (GE 14.)
Applicant had developed a close relationship with a girlfriend’s grandson. After their
relationship ended, his ex-girlfriend threatened to prevent him from seeing her grandson.
Applicant  reacted  by  attempting  suicide,  overdosing on his prescription Xanax and his
insulin drug on April 1, 2014. (Tr. 52-53.) He was administered Narcan at the emergency
room of a local hospital, where he became very agitated, tried to hit emergency room staff
and hospital security, and threatened to kill one of the security officers. (GEs 3, 10, 13, 22.)
He tested positive for benzodiazepine, amphetamines, cannabis, and opiates, and was
admitted to the intensive care unit, where he continued to express threats toward his ex-
girlfriend. He was diagnosed with multiple drug overdose, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, and
transferred on April 3, 2014, to the hospital’s inpatient psychiatric unit on an involuntary
legal status (SOR ¶ 1.b). He had good behavioral control on the unit and explained that he
overdosed as a test of his ex-girlfriend’s love, i.e., would she obtain medical attention for
him.  On  April 7,  2014,  Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  hospital with  a  diagnosis of
bipolar disorder – recurrent, severe, mixed with psychosis, to follow up with his outpatient
counseling and medication management. (GE 13.)
While Applicant was in the hospital, his ex-girlfriend served him with a restraining
order. After his discharge, Applicant relapsed on alcohol and marijuana for a couple of
days because he was depressed. He started texting and leaving voice messages on his ex-
girlfriend’s cellular phone and drove by her house. On April 12, 2014, he was arrested for
violating the protective order. (GEs 9, 12, 14, 22.) On April 15, 2014, Applicant was treated
in a hospital emergency room after state police, in responding to a welfare check, found
Applicant in an agitated and belligerent state. He had called his supervisor and expressed
a  threat  of  suicide.  A  urine  screen  was  positive  for  cannabinoids.    Applicant  was
discharged  from  the  emergency  room  after  declining  treatment,  but  he  continued  his
outpatient counseling with the LCSW. (GEs 14-15, 22.)
On May 2, 2014, Applicant had an argument with his current spouse (then fourth ex-
wife) over Applicant’s ex-girlfriend taking “his grandson” from him. Applicant’s spouse told
the police Applicant had pulled her hair, but he had not assaulted her. A witness stated that
Applicant had pinned his spouse to the ground. Applicant was arrested and charged with
disorderly conduct (SOR ¶ 2.j). (GEs 11-12, 22.) On February 10, 2015, the disorderly
conduct  charge  was  nolle  prossed.  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  violating  a  condition  of  his
release  for  violating  the  protective  order  obtained  by  his  ex-girlfriend,  and  he  was
sentenced to one year in jail (execution suspended), and two years of probation. (GE 12.)
He was also required to attend 26 weeks of anger management classes, which he began in
June 2015. (GE 18.)
An  arrest  warrant  was  issued for Applicant for breach of peace because of his
combative and threatening behavior in the hospital emergency room on April 1, 2014 (SOR
¶ 2.h). Applicant turned himself in to the police when he learned of the warrant on May 8,
2014. He was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail, execution suspended, and
placed on probation for two years. (GEs 10-12.)
The incidents of April and May 2014 occurred despite counseling and medication
management.  (GEs  14, 22.) On July 3, 2014, Applicant entered a PHP where he was
treated for bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation. He expressed on admission that he had
some auditory hallucinations. His anti-depressant medication was adjusted with positive
effect, and he was “stepped down” to the hospital’s intensive outpatient program on July
21, 2014. He was discharged on August 6, 2014, to aftercare counseling with his therapist
three  times  per  week,  and  medication  management  by  his  physician.  Applicant  was
clinically stable, and his prognosis was assessed as good as he was able to recognize his
triggers and his unhealthy behaviors. (GE 15.)
Applicant resumed his psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW on August 8, 2014.
His mood remained stable for the most part, although he was tearful over the loss of his
relationship  with  his ex-girlfriend’s grandson.  As  of  November 26,  2014,  he  was  using
marijuana occasionally as a sleep aid against the clinical advice of his therapist. (GE 14.)
Applicant reported his recent psychiatric treatment and his psychotherapy with the
LCSW on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) completed on February
13,  2015.  He  also  indicated  that  he  was  on  probation  for  two  years  for  violating  the
conditions of his release and for breach of peace. He falsely responded “No” to whether he
had used any illegal drug in the last seven years. He admits that he lied on his SF 86. (GE
1; Tr. 70.)
As of March 2015, Applicant was attending psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW
once a week. He had demonstrated increased insight and ability to make decisions in his
best interest. Inconsistent compliance with his medications and distress over being denied
a  promotion  at  work  led  to  an  increase  in  his  depression  in  July  2015,  although  his
condition improved once he took his medications as prescribed. Applicant married his fifth
wife  in  September  2015,  but  she  left  him  in  October  2015.  Applicant’s  mental  health
deteriorated after the breakup, and he missed two weeks of work because of his mental
state. He presented for a session with his treating LCSW in a decompensated state in late
October 2015. At the LCSW’s recommendation, Applicant was taken by his son to a local
hospital. (GEs 14, 22.)
Applicant received treatment the hospital from October 26 – 27, 2015, for diagnosed
bipolar disorder – most recent episode depressed; cannabis use disorder – moderate; and
alcohol use disorder in full remission. He tested positive for amphetamines and cannabis,
and admitted that he had used cannabis on 15 out of the last 30 days. He was transferred
from the emergency room to a psychiatric unit, where he was discharged at his request, to
obtain treatment elsewhere. He was advised to avoid alcohol and illegal drugs. (GEs 16,
22.)
On November 4, 2015, Applicant was assessed for treatment by a behavioral health
service. He had experienced multiple losses over the previous two years, to include the
suicide of a nephew. Applicant reported no current suicidal ideation, and no alcohol use for
the past 25 years. He admitted that he had used marijuana on October 21, 2015, but none
otherwise in the last 30 days. Applicant was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder – current or
most recent episode depressed, severe; and with PTSD. On November 9, 2015, Applicant
was admitted to a PHP five days per week. He was reminded of the risks of using alcohol
or illegal drugs and the risk of combining alcohol or other substances with his prescription
medications.  He  was  an  active  participant  in  group  therapy,  and  reported  regular
attendance at AA with no drinking. He was discharged in January 2016, having completed
the PHP and an IOP, to follow up with his therapist. (GE 18.) The last available progress
note of his treatment with the LCSW is dated February 23, 2016, although that progress
note does not reflect that he was discharged. (GE 14.) Applicant recalls having sessions
with  the  LCSW  in  2017  and  in  2018.  (Tr.  55.)  Of  all  his  treatments,  he  considers  his
sessions with the LCSW to have been the most beneficial for him. (Tr. 66.)
Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) on February 22, 2016. He detailed his involvement with marijuana,
including  on  four  occasions  since  the  spring  of  2015.  He  admitted  knowing  that  using
marijuana was not allowed because of his security clearance. His recent drug involvement
had been with his current wife’s son, and he contributed funds to pay for the drug two or
three times. Applicant added that he would never use marijuana at work. He expressed an
intention to continue using marijuana on his personal time because it helps him to cope. He
claimed his co-workers, family, and friends know about his marijuana use and denied it
could be a source of blackmail. (GE 22.)
On September 11, 2016, Applicant was arrested for felony unlawful restraint in the
first degree following a domestic violence incident involving an ex-girlfriend. (GE 3.) His ex-
girlfriend, who wanted to get drunk with him, bought a bottle of whiskey. After getting “very
wasted” with her, he tried to choke her during an argument. (GE 4; Tr. 71-72.) The offense
was in violation of his probation for the April 2014 protective order violation. On November
1, 2017, he was sentenced  to three years in jail, execution suspended, and placed on
probation  for  three  years.  (GE  9.)  Applicant  was  also  required  to  attend  a  six-month
domestic  violence  program,  which  he  completed.  (Tr.  72-73.)  He  testified  that  his  ex-
girlfriend indicated that she would write a positive letter to the court to end his probation
early  in  2019.  (Tr.  73.)  He  presented  no  record  showing  that  his  probation  has  been
terminated.
At  the  request  of  the  DOD,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed  clinical
psychologist on May 6, 2018. He reported to the psychologist that he had been attending
anger management classes twice per week since January 2018. He explained that he had
stopped his psychotherapy with the LCSW at the latter’s request. He claimed without any
corroboration that the LCSW told him he was on the cusp of recovery and his coping skills
were good, although he then admitted that he got bored with the therapy and had no plans
to resume it. He was taking medications prescribed by his primary care physician, and he
expressed an intention to continue taking them for his mental stability. Applicant described
current symptoms of low esteem, sadness, attention and concentration issues, and missing
his ex-girlfriend’s grandson. He reported a supportive relationship with his fourth ex-wife
(spouse  as  of  August  2019).  He  denied  any  episodes  of  mania  since  2014.  When
discussing his past treatments, Applicant generally indicated that they were beneficial.
Regarding substance abuse, he stated that he had been abstinent from alcohol from May
1989  to  September  2016,  when  he  relapsed  for  one  day.  He  stated  that  he  was  not
currently using any illegal drugs, and while he had used marijuana occasionally to help him
calm down from approximately 2005 through 2014, he only used it with friends at parties.
He acknowledged knowing that he was not supposed to use marijuana while holding a
security clearance. Applicant also admitted that he was currently on probation after he
choked an ex-girlfriend. (GE 4.)
During the evaluation, Applicant appeared guarded when discussing clinical issues;
demonstrated loss associations; and needed repeated, direct, and specific questions to
disclose information that did not portray him in a positive manner. He was not involved in
any psychotherapy. In the opinion of the psychologist, Applicant’s judgment and reliability
appeared  poor,  and  his  insight  appeared  fair.  He  diagnosed  Applicant  with  bipolar  I
disorder  –  unspecified,  ADHD  –  combined  presentation;  and  borderline  personality
disorder.  Applicant  did  not  report  any  current  PTSD  symptoms  or  substance  abuse,
although the psychologist opined that Applicant likely met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis
as  well.  He  found  it  concerning  that  Applicant  had  used  marijuana  while  holding  a
clearance and indicated that he would be very concerned if Applicant resumed drinking. He
assessed  Applicant’s  prognosis as guarded and opined that  the bipolar I disorder and
10
borderline personality disorder are conditions that negatively impact Applicant’s reliability,
judgment,  stability,  and  trustworthiness.  If  Applicant  became  noncompliant  with  his
medications,  it  would  have a significant negative impact on his reliability, stability, and
judgment. The psychologist considered Applicant’s disengagement from his psychotherapy
to be ill-advised. Applicant’s longtime employment since 1990, his dedication to his job,
and  the  fact  that  Applicant  felt  much  better  than  in  the  past,  were  favorable  issues
warranting consideration in the opinion of the psychologist. (GE 4.)
Applicant testified that he obtained a medical marijuana card in January 2017. (Tr.
64.) He denies any use of marijuana since his last use sometime during the spring of 2019.
(Tr.  67.)  He  explained  that  he  had  used  marijuana  in  the  past  when  he  “was  in  total
breakdown.” (Tr. 63-64, 67-68.) He admitted that he lied on his February 2015 SF 86 form
by denying that he used any illegal drug in the last seven years. (Tr. 70.) He knew that
marijuana use was not allowed while he held a DOD clearance. (Tr. 67.) Applicant does not
currently attend AA. He denies any current consumption of alcohol and any intention to
drink in the future. (Tr. 73.) He realizes that drinking any alcohol will not help him because
he loses control when he drinks. (Tr. 74.)
Applicant is grateful to the DOD for granting him the privilege of having a clearance,
which has allowed him to continue his work over the years. He does not believe that he has
worked on any classified projects. Some of his co-workers do not have security clearances.
Applicant believes he has done his job well. He is passionate about his work and has had
no trouble focusing on his work. (Tr. 46-49.) He continues to struggle on a daily basis with
controlling  his  emotions.  (Tr.  54.)  He  is  currently  prescribed  Lamictal  (for  his  bipolar
disorder),  Adderall,  and  a  new  anti-depressant.  He  does  not  always  take  the  Adderall
because it impairs his ability to sleep, and he does not think the Lamictal is helping him.
(Tr. 56-57.) He sought counseling for anxiety and depression through his EAP in late spring
2019, and he was referred to a local psychiatric hospital where they wanted to admit him to
an inpatient substance abuse treatment program. He was using marijuana at that time,
although he denies he was drinking alcohol. He did not pursue treatment because he did
not want to take more time away from his work. (Tr. 58-59.) Applicant testified that he is
“holding  it  together,”  and  learning  to  not  allow  his  emotions  to  get  the  better  of  his
judgment. (Tr. 59-60.)
Applicant’s current spouse has known Applicant for over 25 years. She testified that
he has stopped drinking; that they have no alcohol in their house; and that they do not go
to bars or to alcohol stores. She has not seen him with any alcohol since September 2016.
(Tr. 76-78.) She is aware that he obtained a medical marijuana card in 2017 and that he
last used marijuana in the spring of 2019 when “he was having an episode.” (Tr. 81-82.) To
her knowledge, Applicant “only uses it when he has an issue.” She does not know how
Applicant obtained the marijuana that he used earlier this year. (Tr. 82.) In all the years that
she has known him, Applicant has not talked about his work with her. (Tr. 83-84.)
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  2004  to  August  2015  attests  that  Applicant
demonstrated a high level of proficiency working on very complex products. This former
supervisor never witnessed Applicant intoxicated or impaired at their workplace. Applicant
11
always put full effort into his duties and cared about his work. The supervisor knows of “no
professional reason” why Applicant should lose his security clearance. (AE A.)
A co-worker of Applicant’s for the last 15 years, who has become a close friend,
indicated that he understands the concerns, but he trusts Applicant with his life. In his
experience,  Applicant  has  been  committed  to  providing  a  quality  product  for  the  U.S.
military. As a friend, Applicant has been reliable, consistent, and trustworthy. (AE B.)
Applicant’s supervisor since 2014 has known Applicant since 2001. They graduated
from  apprenticeship  school  together  and  worked  on  the  same  crew  on  and  off.  This
supervisor indicated that he has not witnessed or suspected Applicant of coming to work
under the influence of any substance. He vouched for Applicant’s integrity as a trusted
employee and patriot. Applicant continues to be a “valuable and necessary asset to [his]
crew.” (AE C.)

"Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since March 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for the
first  time.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree,  which  was  awarded  in  1984  and  additional
credits  but  no post-graduate degree.  He  is divorced  with  one  child.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  at

Applicant  went  through  protracted  divorce  proceedings  from  2011  until  the
divorce  was  finalized  in  2013.  He  stated  that  he  “was  under tremendous  stress  during
that  time  and  .  .  .  exercise[d]  bad  judgment.”  He  was  arrested  in  October  2013  and
charged  with  driving  under the  influence  (DUI), with  blood  alcohol  level above  .15.  He
pleaded  nolo  contendere  to  the  charge.  He  was  sentenced  to  $1,000  in  fines  plus
additional  court  costs,  50  hours  of  community  service,  and  probation  for one  year.  He
was required to attend a DUI school and a victim awareness program. He completed all

Applicant attended outpatient substance abuse counseling from November 2013
through  January  2014.  He  admitted  during  his  intake  assessment  that  he  smoked
marijuana for relief from his chronic pain associated with fibromyalgia. He stated that he
smoked  marijuana  when  he  was  in  college,  but  then  nothing  until  he  turned  50.  He
stated  that  from  age  50  to  52,  he  would  smoke  half  a  joint  for  relief  from  his
fibromyalgia.  Applicant  was  52  years  old  when  he  completed  the  intake  assessment.
His  drug  test  at  admission  tested  positive  for  THC,  the  active  ingredient  in  marijuana.
He successfully completed the last of his 12 sessions at the end of January 2014.  He
was diagnosed at intake and discharge with alcohol abuse and cannabis abuse.  (Tr. at

Applicant  was  arrested  in  July  2016  and  charged  with  DUI,  second  offense.  He
pleaded nolo  contendere  to the  lesser charge  of  reckless driving  involving  alcohol.  He

probation for one year. He completed all the terms of his probation in October 2018. (Tr.
at 26-27; GE 1-3, 5; AE A, C)
Applicant denies that he was intoxicated when he was arrested in July 2016. He
asserted that he had one drink with dinner five hours before he drove. He attributed his
erratic  driving  to  a  mechanical  problem  with  his  car.  He  refused  to  have  his  breath  or
blood  tested  because  his  previous  attorney  told  him  that  the  tests  are  inaccurate,  and
he should refuse to submit to them if he is ever arrested again for DUI. (Tr. at 26-31, 43-

Applicant  attended  outpatient  substance  abuse  counseling  as  part  of  a  DUI
program  from  October  2016  through  February  2017.  He  admitted  on  his  intake
assessment that he smoked marijuana about 20 times while he was in college. There is
no  mention  of  his  more  recent  use.  He  remained  abstinent  during  the  program.  He
attended  8  individual sessions  and  14  group  sessions.  He  successfully  completed  the
program  with  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  use  disorder,  mild,  which  was  later  corrected  to
alcohol use disorder in sustained remission. (Tr. at 35-36, 41-42; GE 2, 7; AE A, C)
Applicant  stated  that  he  has  not  used  marijuana  since  before  he  started  his
counseling in November 2013. He asserts that he has learned a costly lesson from his
DUIs,  and  he  has  benefitted  from  his  counseling.  He  assured  that  he  only  drinks
responsibly and that he will never drink and drive again. He signed a statement of intent
to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any
future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr.

The  SOR  alleges  a  $92,288  charged-off  mortgage  loan;  $11,409  in  unpaid
federal income taxes for tax year 2015; and 34 delinquent medical debts with balances
totaling  about  $12,150.  Except  as  addressed  below,  the  allegations  are  established
through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant’s finances were adversely affected by his divorce, a lay-off from his job
in 2014, and a serious medical operation in 2017. As part of his divorce, he was ordered
to refinance the mortgage on his home to remove his ex-wife’s name from the loan or
sell the property, to include a short sale. He was unable to refinance the property, but
the creditor agreed to a short sale, which took place in 2016. There is no evidence that
the  creditor  has  actively  pursued  any  deficiency  on  the  mortgage  loan.  (Tr.  at  23-24;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 9, 10; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A, C)
Applicant’s federal income  tax  liability  for tax  year 2015  was  $37,912,  but  there
was  only  $1,658  withheld  from  his  paycheck.  He  made  payments  totaling  $2,000  in
2016. The IRS withheld $7,424 from his 2016 refund and $8,420 from his 2017 refund.
He  made  payments  totaling  $400  in  2017.  He  paid  $5,969  in  March  2018  and
established a $500 per month installment agreement. He maintained the payments and
the IRS withheld $5,139 from his 2018 refund. In June 2019, the IRS released the tax
lien  it  had  filed  against  him  and  indicated  that  the  taxes  owed  for  tax  year  2015  had
been satisfied. (Tr. at 22; GE 8; AE B, C)
Applicant’s  surgery  in  2017  cost  more  than  $228,000  in  medical  bills.  He

$5,000  limit  on  his  liability.  He  paid  a  number  of  the  medical  debts  and  referred  other
debts to his attorney. He stated that he is willing to pay all the medical debts that are his
responsibility. His finances are otherwise in order. (Tr. at 22-25; Applicant’s response to

Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
March  2018.  He  reported  his  two  DUI  arrests;  his  substance  abuse  counseling;  and  a
$9,045  delinquent  medical  debt.  He  answered  “No”  to  the  question  that  asked  if  he
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances  in  the  last  seven  years.  He  failed  to
report  his  marijuana  use  between  2011  and  November  2013.  (GE  1)  He  denied
intentionally  providing  false  information  about  his  marijuana  use  with  the  following
explanation.
I truly believed at the time that my use was over 7 years earlier. During the
intake  into  counseling,  if  I  were  informed  that  traces  of  Cannabis  were
found  in  my  system,  I  would  have  been  more  likely  to  remember  the
timeframe.  All  I  recalled,  when  answering  the  statement,  was  that
sometime during my divorce which started 2010 and filed in 2011 (7 years
earlier),  I  did  on  a  few  occasions  exercise  poor  judgment  and  use
Cannabis. The 2011 date stuck in my mind and hence why my response
was such. (Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant’s testimony was consistent in that he asserted he thought his marijuana
use was beyond the seven-year window for the question. He stated that he was never
informed  that  he  tested  positive  in  November  2013  during  his  substance  abuse
counseling, which if he had known might have sparked his memory when answering the
question. He stated that “knowing that it was that long ago. I gave myself the benefit of
the doubt.” (Tr. at 32-35, 45-55)
Applicant  responded  to  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)
interrogatories  in  March  2019.  He  answered  “No”  to  the  question  that  asked  if  he
“EVER”  used  any  illegal  drugs.  He  denied  that  the  answer  was  intentionally  false.  He
stated  that  he  misread  the  question  and  assumed  it  was  asking  about  the  previous
seven years, and he thought his marijuana use occurred more than seven years before
his response. (Tr. at 35, 46-47, 51; Applicant’s response to SOR)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  factual  allegations
pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant’s admissions are
incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving

previously served in a number of sales positions with other employers. Although he was

Alcohol Consumption
Applicant commenced consuming alcohol after the age of 21, initially starting with
beer, but eventually graduated to mixed drinks with whiskey. The frequency of his alcohol
consumption  commenced  monthly  at  parties,  but  soon  transitioned  into  two  times  per
week during the week and weekends at parties. Applicant acknowledged that he drank to
intoxication at every party. He also acknowledged that he has gone to work hung over on
many  occasions.  Consuming  alcohol  to  intoxication  made  him  tired,  sluggish,  and
emotional. He does not recall how much alcohol it takes to become intoxicated. (Item 6,
at 7-8) Applicant has a substantial history of maladaptive alcohol use that has resulted in
three incidents described below.
On April 20, 2012, when he was about 22-years-old, Applicant attended several
different parties, consuming an unknown quantity of beer at each party. He left the last
party  at  about  2 a.m.  While  searching  for friends, he  dozed  off  while  driving  and  rear-
ended a private security patrol car which was stopped at a stop light. It was estimated by
the  authorities  that  he  was  traveling  at  about  50  miles  per  hour  upon  impact.  He  was
charged with driving under the influence (DUI), arrested, and jailed overnight. He entered
a plea of guilty to DUI, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to time served; ordered to
attend nine months of First Offender Traffic School classes, six Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA)  meetings;  required  to  complete  two  weeks  of  community  service;  placed  on  36
months of probation; and directed to pay restitution as well as about $2,000 in fines and
fees. Applicant estimated that the total amount of costs eventually totaled between $8,000
and $9,000. He reportedly complied with the court mandates. (Item 6, at 6-7; Item 7)
On July 12, 2014 (as opposed to June 2014, as stated by Applicant and as alleged
in  the  SOR),  Applicant  consumed  two  whiskey  and  cokes  while  at  home.  At  about  10
p.m., he decided to drive to a store to obtain items for the following day’s lunch. He was
stopped by the local deputy sheriff for a faulty license plate light. The deputy inquired if
Applicant  had  been  drinking,  and  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had.  Applicant  was
administered a blood alcohol content test (BAC) and the result registered 0.08 percent.
Applicant  was  charged  with  prohibited  license  plate  lights;  possession  of  alcohol
beverages in motor vehicle; and operating a vehicle while intoxicated (DWI). (Item 7, at
2; Item 6, at 6) He was arrested and jailed overnight. He entered a plea of guilty to DWI,
a  misdemeanor,  and  was  sentenced  to  time  served;  ordered  to  attend  nine  months  of
First  Offender  Traffic  School  classes,  and  view  a  number  of  traffic  videos;  required  to
complete an unspecified period of community service; placed on six months to a year of
probation;  and  directed  to  pay  an  unspecified  amount  in  fines  and  fees.  Applicant
estimated that the total amount of costs eventually totaled between $4,000 and $5,000.
He reportedly complied with the court mandates. (Item 6, at 6-7)
In May 2017, during an interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. Office
of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant denied that he had a problem with alcohol,
or that alcohol has had any impact on his work, home life, school, or current friendships.
(Item 6, at 8)
On  January  21,  2019,  after  apparently  consuming  an  unspecified  quantity  of
alcohol, Applicant was stopped by the local police authorities and charged with DUI, a
misdemeanor;  and  DUI  alcohol  with  a  BAC  of  0.8  percent.  (Item  5;  Item  8)  He  was
arrested  and  jailed  overnight.  He  entered  a  plea  of  nolo  contendere  to  DUI  alcohol,  a
misdemeanor,  and  the  DUI  was  dismissed  in  the furtherance  of  justice.  Applicant  was
sentenced to ten days in jail, with credit for the one day served; entered into a 9-day work
release program; ordered to attend a Traffic and Alcohol Awareness School (TAASK) for
its  multiple  offender  18-month  program;  placed  on  summary  probation  for  five  years  -
served without supervision by a  probation officer; required to have an ignition interlock
device  installed  on  any  vehicle  he  may  drive  for  a  period  of  three  years;  subjected  to
random search for alcohol; and directed to pay $2,018 in fines and fees. (Item 5; Item 8)
Applicant complied with the interlock requirement on July 18, 2019. (Verification, attached
to the Response to the FORM) As of July 29, 2019, he had completed a portion of the
required TAASK sessions. (Progress Report, attached to the Response to the FORM) As
of August 6, 2019, he had paid $60 of his total fine (Statement, attached to the Response
to the FORM)
Applicant  now  claims  that  he  has  learned  his  lesson  and,  effective  January  21,
2019,  he  decided  to  become  completely  sober,  and  he  stopped  drinking  any  kind  of
alcohol.  With  regard  to  the  most  recent  incident  (the  one  in  January  2019),  Applicant
stated that he was “going through a very stressful and emotional situation at the time,”
not otherwise specified, and he “decided to use alcohol to numb the pain.” He claimed
that he is “not normally a heavy drinker.” (Statement, attached to the Response to the
FORM)

"After  a  thorough  review  of  the  case  file,  I  make  the  following  findings  of  fact.
Applicant is 62 years old. Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in May 2000, and took
additional college courses from January 2003 until November 2005. He did not receive
an additional degree. He married the first time in 1980, had one child, and divorced in
1985. He married again in 1985 and had four children. Applicant and his wife separated
briefly  a  number  of times  in their marriage  and now  have  been separated  since  2015.
Applicant  and  his  wife  are  trying  to  reconcile.  He  has  four  adult  children  from  this
marriage.  Since  separating  from  his  wife,  Applicant  rented  the  basement  of  a  town
house where he and his special needs son reside. (Tr. 25-26, 35-38)
Applicant served on active duty in the Army from March 1975 until April 1995. He
retired as a First Sergeant (E-8) with an honorable discharge. After leaving active duty,
he served as a minister for three years until approximately 2000. In February 2002, he
started  working  with  his  present  defense  contractor  employer  as  a  mechanic.  He  was
continually  promoted  and  has  been  a  production  supervisor  for  the  last  ten  years.
Applicant’s  employer  has  been  very  supportive  of  him  while  he  undergoes  substance
abuse rehabilitation, to care for his son, and the need to care for and bury his mother.
(Tr.  26-27;  33-36;  GX  1,  e-QIP,  dated  June  18,  2016;  GX  3,  e-QIP,  dated  March  29,
2012)
The SOR alleges four financial security concerns under Guideline F; a Chapter 7
bankruptcy filed in November 2016 with debts discharged in March 2017 (SOR 1.a); a
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  filed  in  July  2016  but  dismissed  in  December  2016  (SOR  1.b);
federal income tax debt of approximately $45,773 for tax years 2009, and 2011 to 2015
(SOR 1.c); and a failure to file in a timely fashion federal tax returns for tax years 2009
through  2015  (SOR  1.d).  Delinquent  student  loans  are  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  as
financial  security  concerns  but  are  noted  on  credit  reports  (GX  4,  dated  May  9,  2017;
GX 5, dated August 19, 2016; GX 6, dated September 2, 2014; and GX 7, dated April 3,
2012).
The  SOR  alleges  under  alcohol  consumption  (Guideline  G)  that  Applicant  in
October 2011 discharged a firearm from a moving vehicle after consuming alcohol. He
was  sentenced  to  be  incarcerated  for  180  days  with  165  days  suspended.  (SOR  2.a).
The  SOR  also  alleges  that  after  consuming  alcohol  Applicant  was  arrested  for
recklessly  handling  a  firearm,  swearing  in  public  and  public  intoxication.  He  was
sentenced  to  probation  for  12  months.  (SOR  2.b)  These  offenses  were  also  cross-
alleged  as  criminal  conduct.  (SOR  3.a)  Applicant  admitted  all  allegations.  (Answer  to
SOR, dated October 25, 2018)
Applicant lived beyond his means while on active duty. He used credit cards sent
to  him  in  the  mail  to  bolster  his  ability  to  purchase  whatever  he  wanted.  After  leaving
active  duty  in  1995  and  working  as  a  minister,  Applicant  continued  to  have  financial
problems  caused  by  lack  of  sufficient  income  and  living  beyond  his  means.  In  1997,
Applicant and his second wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in an attempt to save their
house. They were unable to make the required payments to the bankruptcy trustee, so
the bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their debts at the time were
discharged in the bankruptcy in 1997. His house was foreclosed in 2002. (Tr. 20-21, 35-
37;  GX  8  and  9,  Bankruptcy  Documents, 1997;  GX  10,  Foreclosure  documents,  dated
May 3, 2002; GX 11, Applicant’s Statement, dated May 16, 2002)
Applicant  and  his  wife  continued  to  have  financial  issues.  They  moved  so  he
could  have  a  better  job,  but  his  wife  could  not  find  employment  to  provide  sufficient
income for the family. He could not afford to buy a house so he rented one. Applicant’s
wife  usually  calculated,  completed,  and  filed  their  tax  returns.  After  a  separation  in
approximately 2006 from his wife, Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns for
six  years  from  approximately  2009  until  2015  because  he  knew  he  would  owe  about
$6,000  each  year  in  taxes  that  he  could  not  afford  to  pay.  His  wife  continued  to  file
separately. Starting in 2008, Applicant knew he would owe substantial federal taxes. He
was overwhelmed by his problems and did not focus on what he needed to do and did
not take care of his business. (Tr. 40-41, 73-75)
In 2012, Applicant went to a tax service and an attorney to resolve his taxes to no
avail. Starting in 2012, Applicant’s pay was garnished by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS).  After  the  IRS  pay  garnishment,  Applicant’s  take-home  pay  was  reduced  to
approximately  $600  a month  after  garnishment.  Applicant’s  car  was  repossessed,  and
he  and  his  family  were  evicted  from  the  home  they  rented.  Applicant  and  his  wife
separated permanently in 2015. In 2016, Applicant was able to have a tax preparer file
his  past-due  tax  returns.  Applicant  has  continued  to  use  this  attorney  to  file  his  taxes.
(Tr. 41-43)
Applicant  also  contacted  an  attorney,  and  Applicant  and  his  wife  filed  another
Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was later converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their debts
were again discharged in 2017. (Tr. 21-23, 43-45; GX 2, Bankruptcy Documents)
Applicant was overwhelmed by his financial issues and the need to care for his
special  needs  son.  After  the  bankruptcy  discharge,  Applicant  worked  with  a  Certified
Public  Accountant  (CPA)  to  resolve  the  federal  tax  debt  that  remained  from  the
bankruptcy  discharge.  With  the  help  of  the  CPA,  Applicant  was  able  to  have  his
disabled  son  declared  his  dependent  and  his  income  restructured  to  minimize  his  tax
liability. Instead of owing taxes, he received a tax refund that is applied to his tax debt.
His mother, who was located in another state, became sick and Applicant had to travel
to help care for her. His mother passed away in September 2018. (Tr. 23-25, 35-38)
Applicant filed his past-due federal tax returns in 2016. (AX F, G, and H, IRS Tax
Documents). He timely filed his 2016 and 2017 federal tax returns. (AX I and J, IRS Tax
Documents)  After  all  of  the  tax  returns  were  filed,  the  IRS  determined  that  Applicant
owed  approximately  $35,000  in  back  taxes.  In  April  2018,  Applicant  agreed  to  a
payment plan of $425 a month with the ISR to pay back taxes. His payment amount will
increase in April 2019 to $595. No taxes were owed for tax years 2016 and 2017. He is
current  with  the  IRS  payment  plan  for  past-due  taxes  for  tax  years  2010  to  2015.  (Tr.
49-52, 72-74)
Applicant  drank  alcohol  from  approximately  1990  to  2000.  He  started  drinking
because he was a young soldier and just wanted to drink alcohol. He stopped drinking
alcohol in 2000 because he entered the ministry becoming a pastor and did not want to
be  seen  consuming  alcohol.  He  started  drinking  again  in  2003  because  he  left  the
ministry  and  there  was  no  accountability  for  behavior,  he  was  still  having  financial
problems,  and  he  had  lost  his  home.  In  2010,  his  consumption  of  alcohol  increased
substantially  for  no  reason  except  he  and  his  wife  were  separated;  his  children  had
moved back into his house; and he had issues caring for his mother who was in another
state.  He  was  consuming  from  six  to  nine  beers  a  day.  He  drank  to  deal  with  his
problems  and  his  stress.  Applicant  sought  substance  abuse  counseling.  In  2015,  he
started to consult with a psychologist who he still periodically sees.  He  last  consumed
alcohol on September 22, 2018, the day before his mother’s funeral. The day before the
hearing,  he  started  a  Veteran’s  Affairs  (VA)  Substance  Abuse  Rehabilitation  Program
(SARP) through his employer. He understands he has an issue with alcohol and needs
treatment. He stated that he does not intend to consume alcohol in the future. (Tr. 51-
58, 75-78: AX A through D; VA Hospital staff assignments and schedule)
In  October  2011,  Applicant  was  separated  from  his  wife  and  dating  another
woman. He was consuming a few beers before the woman asked him to take her and
her young daughter to run some errands. Since he had been drinking alcohol, he asked
the  woman  to  drive.  Applicant  brought  a  handgun  with  him  because  the  jurisdiction
where  they  were  located  allowed  the  open  carrying  of  handguns.  Applicant  and  the
woman  argued  and  Applicant  became  irritated.  As  they  drove  down  a  road,  Applicant
fired his gun out the window of the moving car. He apologized to the woman and gave
her  his  gun.  But  she  drove  to  a  store  to  call  the  police.  Applicant  did  not  consider
himself  intoxicated  but  he  knew  he  was  over  the  legal  limit  to  drive.  Applicant  was
convicted of two counts of brandishing a weapon, served seven days in jail, and placed
on  probation for  six  months.  He  completed  the  period  of  probation.  He  was  monitored
for  substance  abuse  while  on  probation.  All  tests  were  negative.  (Tr.  59-65,  79-8;  GX
12,  Police  Report;  GX  13,  Court  Record;  GX  16,  Incident  Report;  GX  17,  Criminal
History Report)
Applicant had another incident with a weapon in 2015. By September 2015, his
mother, who had been living with him, moved back to her home because Applicant was
unable to care for her. Applicant also had problems with his special needs son, and the
IRS  was  questioning  him  about  his  failure  to  file  tax  returns.  Applicant  was  angry  and
frustrated. He went outside and fired his gun into the air three times. On the day of the
incident, Applicant consumed over a pint of alcohol. He was arrested and charged with
reckless handling of a firearm and public intoxication. He was convicted and sentenced
to twelve months of supervised probation. He wore an ankle bracelet from October 2015
until October 2016. He did not consume alcohol and successfully completed probation.
He  no  longer  owes  a  firearm.  However,  he  has  continued  to  consume  moderate
amounts  of alcohol  since ending  his probation  in  October  2016.  (Tr. 65-70, 80-81; GX
14,  Police  Report;  GX  15,  Court  Record;  GX  16,  Incident  Report;  GX  17,  Criminal
History Report)
Applicant presented a letter from a friend who is a psychologist and has known
Applicant for over 25 years. The friend provided mentoring and counseling for Applicant.
Applicant  has  been  candid  and  transparent  about  the  issues  he  has  encountered
including  the  death  of  his  mother.  He  believes  Applicant  has  taken  the  counseling  he
received  to  heart  and  is  developing  positive  coping  methods.  He  is  resolving  his
financial  issue  and making  restitution. He  is  taking  strides to  correct  his past mistakes
and entered substance abuse treatment. He is making efforts to reconcile with his wife.
The friend recommends that he be granted eligibility for access to classified information.

"Under Guideline G, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in 2014 for driving
while  intoxicated  (DWI),  pled  guilty  and  was  convicted  in  January  2016.  His  sentence
included  15  months’  probation.  He  participated  in  treatment  from  December  2017  to
January  2018  following  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  use  disorder.  Applicant  was  arrested  in
March 2018 and charged with DWI, second offense. He pled guilty and was convicted in
January 2019. His sentence included 180 days confinement, suspended, and 15 months’
probation. He was evaluated in March 2019 and diagnosed with moderate alcohol use
disorder in early partial remission. Applicant was advised to abstain from all mood altering
chemicals, including alcohol. Applicant admits each of these allegations. Applicant stated
in his answer that he also participated in treatment from April 2018 until June 2018. The
two DWI arrests are cross alleged under Guideline J. Applicant admits the Guideline J
allegation.
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified material
facts  on  his  2012  and  2014  e-QIPs  by  failing  to  disclose  that  he  had   illegally  used
marijuana from May 2004  until  2012. Applicant  admits  the two allegations under Guideline
E.  Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant, 35, is a trade compliance specialist employed by a defense contractor
since August 2016. He worked for another defense contractor from April 2013 until August
2016. He received his associate’s degree in 2007 and his bachelor’s degree in 2012. He
married  in  2015  and  he  and  his  wife  have  two  children.  He  was  previously  granted  a
security clearance in February 2014. (GX 3; GX 4.)
In  response  to  DOHA’s  June  2020  interrogatories,  which  stated  that  records
obtained in Applicant’s background investigation revealed past illegal-drug use and asked
Applicant to describe his marijuana use, Applicant disclosed that he first used marijuana
in May 2004 and last used it in 2012 with a frequency of less than once a month. He did
not disclose this use on his 2012 and 2014 e-QIPs as required. (GX 4; GX 3.) The record
does not contain any explanation by Applicant regarding his falsifications.
In May 2014, while holding a security clearance, Applicant consumed eight or nine
beers over approximately three hours with his then girlfriend now wife at her home. They
got into an argument and Applicant left with the intention of dropping to his parents’ house.
He  was  pulled  over  for  speeding  and  ultimately  arrested  for  DWI  with  a  blood  alcohol
content of .13. In approximately January 2016 he pled guilty to DWI and was sentenced
to  15  months  of  supervised  probation,  70  hours  of  community  service,  a  fine  of
approximately $1,000, and required to pay the state DWI surcharge of $800 a year for
three years. He was also required to attend alcohol awareness classes. He underwent a
court-ordered alcohol abuse evaluation and the evaluator did not recommend treatment.
In December 2017, Applicant voluntarily entered an alcohol treatment program where he
was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. He participated in the program for 30 days. (GX
4.)
In March 2018, Applicant was drinking beer at home, argued with his wife, and got
in his car and drove away. He was pulled over for speeding and ultimately arrested for
DWI with a blood alcohol content of .08. In January 2019, he pled guilty to DWI and was
sentenced  to  180  days  in  jail,  suspended,  15  months’  supervised  probation  which
included random alcohol and drug screening, 60 hours of community service, court costs
and fines of $850, and the state DWI surcharge of $800 for three years. (GX 4.) He was
still on probation when he underwent his 2019 background investigation.
In  April  2018,  Applicant  again  voluntarily  entered  an  alcohol  abuse  treatment
program at the same facility. He successfully completed a 60-day program in June 2018
and Applicant asserts that has maintained sobriety since completing the program and that
he regularly attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. (GX 4; GX 3.) However, he did not
submit any substantiating evidence of his continued abstinence.
Applicant  again  underwent  a  court-ordered  alcohol-abuse  evaluation  in  March
2019 and was diagnosed with moderate alcohol use disorder in early partial remission.
The evaluator made the following recommendations: that Applicant remain abstinent from
all  mood  altering  chemicals  to  include  alcohol;  that  Applicant  undergo  random  drug
screening; and that Applicant participate in a 30-hour DWI intervention course for repeat
DWI offenders. The evaluator did not recommend treatment unless evidence indicated
that Applicant was using alcohol or illegal drugs or abusing prescription medication,  in
which case he should be required to participate in intensive outpatient treatment. (GX 4.)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.f,
1.g, and 1.j. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k-1.u. He stated,
“I  agree” to  the allegation in  SOR  ¶ 1.e, but his explanation amounted to a denial. He
admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b but denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.c.
He denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 3.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
General Background Information
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is the field service
lead for a team providing IT support for the senior leadership on a military installation. (Tr.
56-57.) He attended a community college from June 2010 to August 2012 and obtained
an associate’s degree in computer science. He married in August 2010. He and his wife
lived apart for about three years while she was employed in another state. They are now
living together. They have no children.
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 2005 to January
2008  and  was  honorably  discharged  for  medical  reasons.  He  testified  that  he  was
discharged because he has angioedema, a swelling of areas under the skin. His medical
records  also  reflect  chronic  lower  back  pain.  He  has  a  30%  disability  and  receives
disability pay of about $456 per month. (Tr. 80.)
Applicant   was  employed  by  federal  contractors  in   physical-security  jobs  from
January 2008 to March 2013.  He  was  unemployed  from March  2013  to February 2014.
He  was employed by another federal contractor from February 2014 to September 2014,
when he quit that  job  for a  better opportunity. He  was employed  in  the private sector from
September  2014  to  August  2016.  He   worked  for   a   federal  contractor  in   August  and
September 2016. (GX  1 at  10-16.)  He  was unemployed from September 2016 to January
2017. (GX 2 at 7.) He  has worked  for his current employer since February  2017.  His SCA
reflects that he has never held a security  clearance. (GX 1 at 32.) However, in  his answer
to the SOR, he refers  to a reinvestigation of his clearance in  2017-2018, indicating that
he has previously held a clearance.
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges that Applicant has 21 delinquent debts totaling about $61,348.
The evidence concerning these allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: judgment obtained  by  a credit union in March 2015 for $24,582.
Applicant obtained  a debt-consolidation loan from  his credit union,  while  he was on active
duty.  (GX  10 at 1; GX 12 at  10.) He  made payments on this loan until  he was laid  off  in
March  2013.  (Answer  at  1.)   In  March  2015,  the  credit  union  obtained   a  judgment  for
$24,582. (GX 3.)  In January 2020,  the credit union initiated a garnishment of Applicant’s
pay   to  satisfy  the  judgment.  The   interest,   attorney’s  fees,  and   garnishment  costs
increased  the  amount  of  the  debt  to   $46,406,  and   a  hearing  on  the  garnishment  was
scheduled for  May 2020. (AX A-2.)  His pay has been garnished in  the amount of $263.66
per week since January 2020. (AX 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: judgment obtained by  a credit union in March 2015 for $13,029.  In
Applicant’s  answer to the SOR  and at the hearing, he stated that this debt was  included
in SOR ¶ 1.a.  (Answer at 1; Tr. 92.)  In March 2015, the credit union obtained a judgment
for  $13,029. The  judgment alleged in  SOR ¶ 1.a and  this judgment were initiated on the
same day and  the both judgments were entered on the same day, but they have  different
case numbers, indicating two separate debts. (GX 3;  GX  4.)  This  judgment is not satisfied.
SOR ¶ 1.c:  judgment  obtained by  an apartment  complex  in November 2018
for  $925.   In   his  answer  to   the  SOR,  Applicant  claimed   that  this   judgment  was   for  a
fraudulent debt opened in  his name.  Court records reflect that  a default judgment  was
entered against him. (GX  5.)  At  the hearing,  he testified that he  had  never heard of the
creditor who obtained the judgment. He has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 96-97.)
SOR ¶ 1.d: judgment obtained by  a furniture company  in February  2018  for
$992. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant  claimed that this judgment was for  a  fraudulent
debt  opened   in   his  name.  Court  records  reflect  that  a  default  judgment   was  entered
against him. (GX 6.)  He has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 97.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: judgment obtained  by  an apartment complex  in October 2017 for
$2,262.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed  that he  had a  payment  agreement
with  the  rental  company  after  being  laid   off,  but  new  owners  refused  to   honor  the
agreement  and   obtained   a  judgment   in   October  2017.  Court  records  reflect  that  the
judgment is not satisfied. (GX 7.)  Applicant  claimed  that the  amount owed was $1,100
and   the  rest   of  the  amount  of   the  judgment  was  for  legal  fees.  (Answer  at  1.)   At   the
hearing, he testified that he made payments of $100 per month for six to eight months,
but he could not recall why he stopped making payments. (Tr. 99-100.) He provided no
documentation of payments. The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.f: unpaid court costs and fines of $356. In Applicant’s answer to the
SOR, he admitted this debt and said he was using his tax refunds to pay it. (Answer at
1.) Court records reflect that the fines and costs were for failure to appear, resulting in his
being charged with contempt of court. (GX 8.) At the hearing, he testified that he believed
that he paid them, but he submitted no documentation of payment. (Tr. 100.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: unpaid court costs and fines of $466. In Applicant’s answer to the
SOR, he admitted this debt and said he was using his tax refunds to pay it. (Answer at
1.) The fines and costs were for an arrest for driving while intoxicated in April 2016 and a
conviction  in  September  2016.  (GX  9.)  The  arrest  and  conviction  are  alleged  under
Guideline G in SOR ¶ 2.a and reflected in court records in GX 13. SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g
allege Applicant’s failure to pay the fines and court costs for his  September 2016 DWI
conviction. He initially testified that he intended to pay them, but when he found that the
fines and court  costs were  being  taken from  his tax refunds,  he decided he  would “let
them take whatever they needed” and then worry about those that were not paid. (Tr. 64.)
Later in the hearing, he testified that he paid this debt in person at the courthouse, but he
submitted no documentation of payment. (Tr. 100.)
SOR ¶ 1.h  charged-off automobile loan for $7,102. In Applicant’s answer to the
SOR, he denied this debt and claimed that it was a fraudulent debt opened in his name.
(Answer at 1.) The credit reports reflect that the debt was for an automobile loan opened
in January 2015. (GX 10 at 2; GX 11 at 2; GX 12 at 8.) In a personal subject interview
(PSI) in August 2017, Applicant told the investigator that he bought a vehicle from a small
dealership and financed it with a loan from the dealership. When he received a bill for a
large sum of money from the dealership that he could not pay, he surrendered the vehicle.
(GX 2 at 8-9.) At the hearing, he admitted that the debt is not resolved. (Tr. 102-03.)
SOR ¶ 1.i: collection account for $2,118. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he
denied this debt and claimed that it was a fraudulent debt opened in his name. (Answer
at 1.) The credit reports reflect that the collection account was opened in January 2015
and that the last activity on the debt was in November 2013. (GX 10 at 2; GX 11 at 2; GX
12 at 13.) In the August 2017 PSI, he told the investigator that this debt had been paid
with a loan from the credit union alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (GX 2 at 8-9.) At the
hearing, he admitted that he had taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 103-04.)
SOR ¶ 1.j: student loan placed for collection of $1,186. In Applicant’s answer
to the SOR, he admitted this debt and stated that he was making payments on it. (Answer
at 1.) He submitted no documentation of payments. At the hearing, he testified that he
attended college on the GI Bill and had no student loans. (Tr. 104.) A credit report from
May 2019 reflects a student loan referred for collection in August 2013 for $1,186. (GX
10 at 2.) He has not attempted to resolve this debt. (Tr. 104.)
SOR ¶ 1.k: collection account for $1,124.  In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he
denied this debt.  In the August 2017 PSI,  Applicant  told an investigator that this debt had
been paid  with a debt-consolidation loan from the credit union alleged  in  SOR ¶¶  1.a and
1.b. (GX  2 at 8.)  At the hearing, he denied this debt,  claiming  that he has never had  an
account with the original creditor. (Tr. 105.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.l:  debt  to  furniture-leasing  company  charged  off  for  $836.  In
Applicant’s  answer  to the  SOR, he stated that  this was  a fraudulent  debt.  This  debt  is
reflected in the May 2019 credit report as charged off in February 2017. (GX 10 at 2.) At
the hearing, he testified that he has made no effort to contract the creditor. (Tr. 105.) The
debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.m: cellphone account referred for collection of $730. In Applicant’s
answer,  he  claimed  that  the  debt  was  paid  when  he  switched  providers  and  the  new
provider paid off the old account. The last activity on this account was in May 2013. It was
referred for collection in October 2017. (GX 10 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he
referred this debt to a credit-repair company in 2017 but received no response from the
credit-repair company or the creditor. (Tr. 107.) He terminated his contract with the credit-
repair company after one year because they made no progress. (Tr. 109.) The debt is not
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.n: credit-union debt charged off for $569. In Applicant’s answer, he
stated that this debt was included in a debt-consolidation loan. The creditor for this debt
is the same credit union alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. It was charged off in September
2014, before the judgments alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were entered. (GX 10 at 2.) It
is likely that this debt was included in one of the judgments.
SOR ¶ 1.o: utility bill placed for collection of $306. In Applicant’s answer, he
stated that this debt was paid, and he has contacted the company to determine the basis
for this account. The last activity on this debt was in May 2018. It was placed for collection
in  October  2018.  (GX  10  at  2.)  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  still  has  an
account with this company, but he has not contacted the company to determine the basis
for this collection account. (Tr. 111.) He did not provide any evidence to show that his
account is current.
SOR ¶ 1.p: telecommunication bill placed for collection of $164. In Applicant’s
answer, he stated that this was a fraudulent debt. This account was placed for collection
in December 2017. (GX 10 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he contacted the creditor
and  was  informed  that  it  has  no  record  of  this  debt.  He  did  not  ask  the  creditor  for
documentation. (Tr. 112.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.q:  telecommunication  bill  placed  for  collection  of  $1,516.  In
Applicant’s answer, he stated that this was a fraudulent debt. The service provider for this
debt  is the  same  as alleged in  SOR ¶ 1.p,  but  the  account number  is  different.  It was
placed for collection in July 2016. (GX 11 at 2.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that this
debt was for unreturned equipment. (Tr. 113.) He sent an email to the collection agency
on February 1, 2021, asking about the possibility of a payment plan. (AX A-3.) The record
does not reflect a response to his inquiry. This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.r: satellite television bill placed for collection of $1,277. In Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he stated that this debt was for unreturned equipment and that the
equipment was picked up by a representative of the service provider in his presence. (Tr.
113.) It appears that Applicant’s  testimony at the hearing may have confused this debt
with the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q. The date of last activity on this account was in May 2016. It
was placed for collection in August 2017. (GX 11 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he
never had an account with this creditor. (Tr. 114, 138.) On February 1, 2021, after the
hearing, Applicant made a payment arrangement providing for monthly $25 payments,
and he made the initial payment. (AX A-1.)
SOR ¶ 1.s: student loan past due for $500. In Applicant’s answer, he stated that
this was a fraudulent debt. It is reflected in the September 2016 credit report as a deferred
student  loan  opened  in  August  2012.  (GX  12  at  8.)  It  is  reflected  in  the  January  2018
credit report as more than 180 days past due. (GX 11 at 2.) It is reflected in the May 2019
credit  report as a collection account  assigned to  the government.  (GX 10 at  2.)  At the
hearing, Applicant testified that he had not tried to determine the basis for the adverse
credit-report entries. (Tr. 115.)
SOR ¶¶  1.t  and  1.u: telecommunication bills placed for collection of $942 and
$366. In Applicant’s answer, he stated that these are fraudulent debts. They are reflected
in the September 2016 credit report. The first was for cellphone service and was placed
for collection in September 2014. The second appears to be for other telecommunications
services,  and  it  was  placed  for  collection  in  September  2016.  (GX  12  at  8-9.)  At  the
hearing, Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor. (Tr. 114-15.) He submitted no
documentation showing that he had contacted the creditor or that the debts were being
resolved.
Applicant’s disability pay is $456  per month. His weekly gross pay  as a contractor
employee  is $1,362.40. His weekly net pay after taxes  and  the garnishment is $790.97.
(AX A.)  He pays $800 per month to his wife for  “rent,” $89  per month for  Internet service,
$300 every two  weeks for  groceries, $100 per  month  for video games, and  $80 per month
for  cigarettes. He  does not have  a savings account. He  has about $2,000 in  his checking
account.  He  intends to start a 401(k)  retirement account.  (Tr. 126-28.)  He  testified that he
does not know   his wife’s annual salary,  but it is more   than he earns. (Tr.   90.)  His wife
testified that they shared finances briefly after they were  married, but she  now  takes care
of most of  their living expenses. She was not  asked and  did not disclose  her annual  salary.
At the time of her testimony, she was not aware of Applicant’s financial problems  that are
alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 47-50.)
Guidelines G, Alcohol Consumption and J, Criminal Conduct
The  SOR  alleges  three  incidents  of  driving  while  intoxicated  under  Guideline  G
and cross-alleges the same incidents under Guideline J.
Applicant testified that his father, grandfather, and grandmother all suffered from
alcohol addiction. He first used alcohol at age 14. He started binge drinking every two
weeks at age 19. (AC C at 238.) He began drinking regularly in 2013, after he lost his job.
Before 2013, he drank socially but infrequently. (Tr. 60.).
Applicant was charged with DWI on February 2005. In his answer to the SOR, he
denied being charged or convicted. He stated that he was sitting in his mother’s parked
car and talking on the phone when the police searched the car and found his mother’s
prescription  drugs  in  the  glove  box  and  charged  him  with  possession  of  a  controlled
substance.  He  claimed  that  the  charges  were  “thrown  out”  because  there  was  no
evidence that he was intoxicated or was driving. However, the court records reflect that
his mother posted a $500 bond, he was arraigned in March 2005, and he pleaded guilty
to DWI. (GX 15.) This conviction is alleged in SOR ¶ 2.c.
Applicant was charged with DWI in April 2016 and convicted in September 2016.
This conviction is alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. He testified that had been working late at night,
around 10:00 p.m., and he stopped at a parking lot to have a telephone conversation with
his wife that became tense. He testified that after the conversation ended, he went to a
nearby bar and had two or three drinks. (Tr. 117-19.) He was stopped as he was driving
home  at  about  1:00  a.m.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  30  days  in  jail,
suspended,  fined  $250,  assessed  court  costs  of  $216,  and  placed  on  unsupervised
probation for two years. His driver’s license was restricted and he was required to install
an ignition interlock. (GX 13.)
Applicant  was  again  charged  with  DWI  in  September  2016  and  convicted  in
February 2017. His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was more than .15. He pleaded guilty
and was sentenced to 365 days in jail, with 305 days suspended, a fine of $1,000, court
costs  of  $236,  and  unsupervised  probation  for  36  months.  (GX  14.)  This  conviction  is
alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b.
After  Applicant’s  arrest  for  DWI  in  April  2016,  he  was  required  by  the  court  to
complete  a  12-week  substance  abuse  program.  (Tr.  66.)  After  his  DWI  arrest  in
September 2016, he was jailed, and the court informed him that he would not be released
on bond unless he was enrolled in a substance-abuse program.
On October 24, 2016, Applicant was admitted into a residential substance-abuse
program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). On admission, he was
diagnosed with an alcohol-abuse disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and chronic low
back pain. (AX C at 272.) During his intake, he disclosed that for the past year he had
been drinking between a pint and a fifth of rum or brandy daily. (AC C at 61.)  His diagnosis
was later changed to alcohol dependence. (AX C at 1.) He was required to live at the VA
facility and could not leave without a pass. He received individual and group counseling,
was tested regularly for alcohol use, and was required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA)  meetings.  He  was  allowed  to  leave  the  facility  to  seek  employment.  The  facility
records reflect that he was cooperative, attentive, and compliant. He was discharged on
February 3, 2017, and immediately began working for his current employer. (AX C at 55.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  abstained  from  alcohol  until  September  2020.  The
evidence  indicates  that  Applicant  resumed  drinking  earlier  than  September  2020,
probably in July or August. He testified that he resumed drinking, thinking that one drink
would not be a problem, drank again two weeks later, drank a third time a couple days
later, and then realized he had a problem. (Tr. 66-67.) On August 31, 2020, he notified
his attorney that he had self-admitted into a medical facility and would be there for an
undetermined period. His attorney requested that the hearing scheduled for September
3, 2020, be postponed. Applicant submitted no documentation of the dates of this period
of rehabilitation, but his testimony is corroborated by his attorney’s correspondence about
postponing the hearing and his attorney’s multiple updates about his projected completion
dates for the rehabilitation program. The correspondence about the postponement and
rescheduling of the hearing is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I.
Applicant  submitted  no  evidence  about  the  content  of  this  recent  rehabilitation
program. He submitted no evidence of a diagnosis or prognosis by a medical professional
associated with the program. He testified that he has abstained from alcohol and attended
AA meetings every other day since his completion of the rehabilitation program in October
2020. (Tr. 70.) He provided no documentation of his AA participation.
",True
"Applicant is 40 years old. He is a process management team lead for a defense
contractor. He is divorced and has three children. He obtained his undergraduate degree
in 2012. (Tr.33) He has been with his current employer since March 2020. He has held
his current clearance since 2004. (GX 1) He completed his most recent security clearance
application in March 2016.
The  Statement  of  Reasons  alleges  under  Guideline  G,  SOR  1.a,  in  June  2009,
Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI); 1.b, in March
2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI; and 1.c, in January 2018, arrested
and charged with DUI. In addition, the SOR alleges under Guideline J, 2.a, information
as set forth under paragraph one.
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant has been a social drinker since the age of sixteen while in high school.
He would typically drink rum and coke. He stated that he would have two drinks in a sitting
once per week to three times per month. In a 2010 subject interview, Applicant stated has
never had any problem reducing his consumption. (GX 3) Within the past ten years he
has been arrested in alcohol-related-vehicular incidents three times. Applicant admitted
the allegations and provided explanations. (Answer to SOR)
As to SOR 1.a, Applicant admitted that he showed poor judgment and immaturity
by overindulging in alcohol. He was with friends at a restaurant and had several drinks.
He had a friend drive him to his car. He sat in the driver’s side, the engine was running
and he fell asleep in the parked car. He stated that he was waiting for another friend to
arrive to drive him home. He claimed that he was tired but not intoxicated. A police officer
knocked on his car window and asked Applicant to step out of the car. Applicant does not
remember  if  he  was  administered  a  sobriety  test.  The  case  disposition  was  Nolle
Prosequi. (GX 5)
As  to  SOR  1.b,  Applicant  admitted  that  again  he  showed  poor  judgment  and
immaturity. In 2014, he was returning from a happy hour after he had consumed alcohol.
In  his  interview  he  stated  that  he  should  not  have  been  driving,  but  at  the  time  he
underestimated the influence of alcohol on his driving. He drove to a fast-food restaurant,
and when he left the parking lot, he found himself driving the wrong way on the highway.
(Tr. 77) He was pulled over by the police and was administered a sobriety test. He failed
the test and was arrested and charged with DUI. At the court date, the arresting officer
did not appear. The court later dropped charges and he was acquitted. (GX 3; GX 6)
As to SOR 1.c, Applicant was arrested in January 2018, and charged with DUI. He
pled  guilty  and  was  placed  on  probation  before  judgment  (PBJ).  He  completed  his
probation in May 2020. He completed a 12-hour drug and alcohol awareness class on
October  15,  2020.  (AX  A)  He  also  completed  a  20-week  classroom  alcohol  and  drug
treatment program on August 10, 2018. An ignition interlock was placed on his vehicle in
2018, and there were no reported violations. (Tr. 88)
Applicant continues to drink about once every few months. (Tr. 93). He drinks a
glass of wine or a bourbon and coke. (Tr. 93) He recalls drinking about a month ago. The
amounts are sometimes a half glass of wine or a sip of a drink.  Since September 2020,
he has participated in weekly therapy sessions, with a focus on how his misuse of alcohol
has been  detrimental to  him  in the  past,  and family  counseling.  (Tr.90). In an October
2020 report, his therapist  notes that  there is  no indication  that he is making unhealthy
choices. (AX B) Applicant  believes the 2018 conviction was a wake-up call. (Tr. 96) He
was emphatic that he was told not to drink and drive, but he was never told not to drink in
the future. (Tr.107) He has never attended AA meetings. (Tr.111)
A friend of Applicant, who has known him since childhood, testified at the hearing
that she knew the reason for the hearing and that Applicant told her about his arrests for
DUI. (Tr.20) She understands that Applicant is still consuming alcohol. (Tr. 21) She does
not believe that he has a problem with alcohol. The witness testified that she recommends
Applicant for a security clearance because she believes that he would not put himself in
a situation that might result in an alcohol-related incident. (Tr. 23)
Another witness  testified that she has been dating Applicant for about two years.
They are in  a serious relationship.  She is aware of Applicant’s DUI’s and  the reason for
the security  clearance hearing. (Tr. 120) She claims that he does not drink at all and  then
supplemented that with maybe once a month.   She stated that he wants  to remain healthy
and be a role model for his children. The witness stated that Applicant is trustworthy and
exemplifies good character.
Applicant submitted five letters of reference. Each letter attests to Applicant’s work
integrity,  professionalism,  and  responsibility.  His  program  manager  believes  Applicant
encompasses every quality that a person who holds a security clearance should possess.
(AX C)
Criminal Conduct
The SOR (2.a) cross-alleges the information alleged in 1.a through 1.c. Applicant
admitted to all SOR allegations in paragraph 1.
Applicant  admitted  his  2009,  2014  and  2018  arrests  for  DUI  charges.  He
completed his probation for the 2018 conviction in May 2020.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with a defense contractor since 1989. He has held a security clearance since
1989. (TR at page 15 line 22 to page 17 line 18, and GX 2 at page 7.)  He is married,
and  has  two  adult  children.  (TR  at  page  15  line  22  to  page  17  line  18,  and  GX  2  at
pages 15, 17 and 18.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
Applicant  began  drinking  alcohol  at  about  15  years  of  age,  and   started  having
“drinking problems”  at the age  of 18. (TR at page 17 line 20 to page 18 line 13.)  His first
Driving Under the Influence  of Alcohol  (DUI)  incident occurred about 1988. This incident
was not alleged in  the  SOR. Applicant considers himself to be an alcoholic. (TR at page
17 line 20 to page 19 line 14.)
1.d.  Applicant’s  second  alcohol-related  incident  occurred  in  February  of  2008,
when he was charged with and pled guilty to DUI. (TR at page 19 line 15 to page 25 line
13.) He received treatment, was diagnosed as suffering from an Alcohol Use Disorder,
and attended Alcoholics Anonymous for two years. (Id., and TR at page 27 lines 3~8.)
1.a. After about eight years of sobriety, Applicant returned to the consumption of
alcohol;  and  as  a  result,  received  out-patient  treatment  for  his  Alcohol  Use  Disorder
from about February 2017 to about August 2017. (TR at page 25 line 20 to page 28 line
7, and at page 30 lines 2~8.)
1.b. After a “few months” of sobriety, Applicant again returned to the consumption
of  alcohol;  and  as  a  result,  received  in-patient  treatment  for  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,
Severe from about January of 2018 to about May 2018. (TR at page 28 line 10 to page
32 line 7.)
1.c.  Despite the above mentioned in-patient and out-patient treatments, Applicant
returned  to  the  consumption  of  alcohol.  (TR  at  page  32  line  8  to  page  35  line  5.)  He
avers  that  he  has  abstained  from  its  consumption  since  October  of  2018,  about  two
years prior to his hearing. (Id.)
Guideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
2.a.  and   2.b.  Applicant  used  marijuana  on  numerous  occasions  from  1981  until
about January of 2018. (TR at page 35 line 10 to page 36 line 14.) Most of his usage
was  prior  to  his  being  granted  a  security  clearance,  but  Applicant  did  use  the  illegal
substance “a couple of times”  while holding a security clearance. (TR at page 17 lines
9~14, at page 37 line 8 to page 38 line 18, and at page 42 lines 6~25.)
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
3.a.  and   3.b.  In  answer  to  Section  23  on  his  October  5,  2017,  SCA,  Applicant
failed  to  disclose  his  marijuana  usage.  During  his   subsequent  subject  interview
conducted   under  oath  on  January  17,  2019,  Applicant  continued  to  conceal  his
marijuana usage. (TR at  page 38 line 19 to page 39 line 11, and  GX 2 at  pages 29~30.)
This lack of candor constitutes willful falsifications.
",False
"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 25 years old. He worked for a defense contractor (DC) at various times
from  March  2018  to  March  2020,  either  in  an  internship  program  or  a  cooperative
program. He holds an associate’s degree and is working toward his bachelor’s degree.
He is single, never married, and has no children. (Tr. 6, 23-28; GE1)
The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana at various times from October 2018 to
August 2019; that he used marijuana after being granted an interim security clearance in
June  2018;  and  in  response  to  interrogatories,  in  August  2019,  he  admitted  that  he
intended to use marijuana in the future. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c) It also alleged that Applicant
consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication twice per month; and that he was arrested
in September 2018 and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. (SOR ¶¶
2.a-2.b) All these allegation were also cross-alleged as personal conduct concerns. (SOR
¶ 3.a)
Applicant admitted that his marijuana use began after he started working for DC in
March  2018.  Before  that,  he  had  never  tried  it.  By  the  time  of  his  first  use,  he  had
completed  filing  out  his  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  and  he  was  aware  that
marijuana use violated DC’s drug abstinence policy. He also knew that using marijuana
violated both federal and state law at the time. He associated with people at a commercial
job who had access to marijuana in vape form and that is the method he used to ingest
marijuana. He used marijuana approximately six times while holding a security clearance
with the last time being in August 2019. He also stated in interrogatory responses that
“my future drug use will remain sporadic and recreational.” In November 2020, marijuana
use became legal for recreational use under the state law of his residence. During his
hearing testimony he modified that position somewhat by claiming that he would only use
marijuana  in  the  future  if  it  was  legal  under  federal  law.  He  did  not  submit  a  signed
statement of intent not to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 26-27, 30, 37-39, 44-45, 51-52;
GE 3)
In  an  April 2019  statement  given  during  his  background  investigation,  Applicant
admitted to drinking to the point of intoxication twice a month. These were his drinking
habits in about August 2018. He would drink five or six beers, or two to four cocktails,
once  or  twice  a  week  with  friends.  In  his  SOR  answer  and  during  his  testimony,  he
modified  the  amount  of  alcohol  he  is  now  consuming.  He  claims  that  he  cut  back  his
alcohol  use  in  2019  to  about  one  to  two  beers  or  cocktails  per  month.  He  does  not
regularly become intoxicated anymore. The last time he was intoxicated was in October
2020 at his parents’ Halloween party. There is no evidence of his alcohol use causing a
legal or employment issue. He has not been diagnosed with an alcohol abuse disorder.
(Tr. 31, 45, 49-50; GE 3; Answer to SOR)
At  approximately  three  a.m.  on  October  15,  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  for
contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was 22 years old at the time and was with
two females,  ages 18 and 15. The  18-year-old  female was  driving Applicant’s car  in  a
residential neighborhood. The car was stopped by police and it was determined that the
18-year-old had a blood alcohol content of .06 percent, which is over the legal limit for
someone under age 21. Both Applicant and the 15-year-old had negative blood alcohol
test  results.  After  initially  denying  that  he  provided  the  alcohol  to  the  driver,  he  later
admitted  doing  so.  He  was  arrested  and  pleaded  guilty  through  a  pre-trial  diversion
program. He satisfied all the terms of his diversion and after six months, the charges were
dismissed. Applicant explained that he was associating with the wrong crowd at that time
and  he  stopped  doing  so.  He  has  not  associated  with  those  two  females  since  the
incident. (Tr. 32, GE 2; Answer to SOR)
Applicant admitted that he did not report the arrest to his security officer at DC or
to  his  parents.  He  claims  that  he  was  not  aware  of  his  duty  to  report  the  arrest  to  his
security officer. He admitted that his nondisclosure to his parents was partly based on
him wanting to handle the incident himself, and partly based on his desire to  keep the
information from them. (Tr. 42, 52-53)
Applicant presented two character letters from a coworker from DC and from his
general  manager  from  a  commercial  job  he  held.  Both  noted  that  he  is  reliable  and
competent at his job. Both felt that he is an excellent employee. An appraisal from DC for
his 2019 internship acknowledged that he fulfilled management’s expectations of him with
solid contributions to the team. Over the course of several internships in 2018 and 2019,
he was recognized with two “Spot Awards” and three “Achievement Awards.”

"In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  denied  the  SOR  allegation  in  ¶  1.a,  and  he
admitted in part and denied in part the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b. (HE 3) He also provided
extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  28-year-old  embedded  electrical  and  software  engineer  who  has
worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  April  2016.  (Tr.  7,  9,  59;  GE  1,  5)  In  2010,  he
graduated from high school, and in 2015, he graduated from college Summa Cum Laude
with a 4.0 grade point average and received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering.
(Tr.  60;  GE  1;  GE  5)  In  December  2020,  he  expects  to  receive  a  master’s  degree  in
electrical and computer engineering from an elite university. (Tr. 59) He has not served
in the military. (GE 1) Applicant married in 2015, and his children are ages three, two, and
seven months. (Tr. 61, 70)
Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant  frequently and habitually consumed alcohol in
excess  and to  the  point  of  intoxication  from  about  December  2007 to  at  least  January
2019.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that a licensed psychologist “diagnosed [Applicant] with alcohol
abuse, uncomplicated (rule out alcohol dependence) and opined that [his] prognosis from
alcohol abuse is only fair, given that [his] motivation to reduce [his] use to a healthier level
is low.” The psychologist acknowledged that Applicant had not had any legal trouble from
alcohol consumption; however, his “regular periods of intoxication could negatively impact
[his]  judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  in  the  context  of  safeguarding  sensitive
information and working in a cleared environment.”
On November 27, 2017, an Office of Personnel Investigations (OPM) investigator
interviewed Applicant. (GE 2) In 2011, Applicant drank two bottles of beer, and then he
drove. (Id. at 9) He drank to the point of intoxication once or twice a week from December
2014 to November 2017. (Id. at 8) He told the OPM investigator that he was essentially
drunk  for  the  year  of  2014.  (Id.)  Occasionally  he  drank  to  intoxication  three  times  in  a
week,  and  once  he  drank  to  intoxication  on  five  consecutive  nights.  (Id.  at  8-9)  He
consumed alcohol because of stress and anxiety. (Id.) Much of his stress was related to
becoming engaged to be married, and his family life in the first two or three years of his
marriage. (Id.)
The  SOR does not allege sexual behavior or criminal  conduct security concerns.
Applicant’s  counsel objected to consideration of Applicant’s sexual  behavior  while under
the influence of alcohol. I overruled the objection, and  will only consider the evidence for
the limited purpose of mitigation in  connection with alcohol-related judgment issues.  In
2013 when he was 21 years old, Applicant engaged in sexual  intercourse on one  occasion
with his 17-year-old cousin  and on another occasion with his cousin’s 17-year  old friend.
(Tr.  72-73;   GE  2   at  9-10;  GE  5  at  4,   6)   The   sexual  contact  with  each   of   them   was
consensual. (Tr. 72-73)
Under  the  state  law  where  the  conduct  occurred,  a  person  who  engages  in
intercourse or a sexual act with a child age 14 or 15 when the defendant is over the age
of 21, or who engages in sexual contact (genital touching short of penetration) with a child
under the age of 14 when the defendant is at least four years older than the child commits
a crime. Accordingly, Applicant’s sexual acts with the 17-year-old girls were not criminal
offenses. Applicant’s cousin’s friend sent Applicant partially nude photographs of herself
on Snapchat (showing her breasts and buttocks), and he retained them on his phone for
a  time,  and  then  he  deleted  them.  (Tr.  73;  GE  2  at  9;  GE  4)  He  did  not  state  he  was
intoxicated at the time he possessed the sexual images of a child (person under 18 years
of age). Possession of sexual images of a child on a cell phone violates federal law and
is serious criminal conduct. See Department of Justice website, Citizen's Guide To U.S.

A licensed psychologist, who is a consultant for the DOD CAF (CAF psychologist),
interviewed Applicant on January 14, 2019. (Tr. 16-20; GE 5 at 1) A licensed clinical social
worker  participated  in  Applicant’s  interview  with  the  CAF  psychologist.  (Tr.  22-23)
Applicant consumed alcohol in high school and college at times to excess. (Tr. 62-63, GE
5 at 2) The only time he drove with alcohol in his system occurred when he was in high
school. At that time, he drank two drinks and then drove to a restaurant. (Tr. 70-71) He
was worried that the police would arrest him for underage alcohol consumption, but he
was not arrested. (Tr. 70-71) Applicant’s alcohol consumption in college was limited. (Tr.
62-63) His alcohol use increased in 2014. (GE 5 at 2) Applicant told the CAF psychologist,
“I spent most of [2014] drunk.” (Id.) Applicant said this comment to the CAF psychologist
was an exaggeration because he never consumed alcohol during the day. (Tr. 74-75) He
consumed  eight  or  more  drinks  while  playing  video  games  at  night.  (GE  5  at  2)  He
requires about eight drinks to become intoxicated. (Tr. 31) When he had  to work the next
day, he limited  his alcohol  consumption to four or  five drinks. (GE 5 at 2) After he married
in   2015,  he reduced his  level of  alcohol   consumption.  (Id.) In  January  2019,  when the
CAF psychologist evaluated him,  his level of alcohol consumption for a typical week was
about 18 to 24 standard drinks of  about 1.5 ounces per drink of whiskey.  (Tr. 75; GE 5 at
2) He  drank more on weekends  and less during the week. (Tr. 75; GE 5 at 2) He  described
himself  to  the  CAF  psychologist  as  a   “highly  functioning  alcoholic.”  (Id.)  He   enjoyed
alcohol consumption, but believed he could stop drinking if he  had  a good reason to do
so. (Id.) His alcohol consumption did not adversely affect his marriage  or employment.
(Id.)
“The National Institute of Alcohol  Abuse and Alcoholism defines normal  drinking
for men as four or fewer drinks per day and 14 or fewer drinks per week. Consuming more
alcohol than this categorizes a person as an at-risk drinker.” (Id. at 6) According to the
CAF psychologist’s January 2019 report, Applicant’s “prognosis for recovery from alcohol
abuse is only fair particularly given his motivation to reduce his use to a healthier level is
low.” (Id.) Because of his alcohol use, particularly his periods of intoxication, his alcohol
consumption “could negatively impact his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness in the
context of safeguarding sensitive information and working in a cleared settling.” (Id. at 7)
The CAF psychologist diagnosed  Applicant  in January 2019, as “Alcohol abuse,
uncomplicated  (Rule  out  Alcohol  Dependence),”  which   he  based  on  International
Classification of Disease (ICD) code F10.10. The World Health Organization  uses ICD
F10.10 for  diagnosing alcohol use. (Tr. 32; GE 5) ICD F10.10 does not have  diagnostic
criteria   but  is  loosely  associated  with  the  Diagnostic  and   Statistical  Manual  (DSM)  4,
published  by  the  American  Psychiatric   Association,  which   includes  the  term  “Alcohol
Dependence.”   (Tr.  32-33,  47)  DSM   5   was   issued  in   2013,  and  the  term  Alcohol
Dependence was changed to Alcohol  Use Disorder.  (Tr.  33)   ICD 11 is expected to be
released in 2021, and  it may incorporate the term alcohol  use disorder  from DSM  5. (Tr.
33) The  CAF psychologist did not limit himself to the diagnostic criteria  in  DSM  5, and
instead, he used his own  background  and  experience  to  make his  diagnostic assessment
of Applicant’s alcohol  consumption. (Tr. 33-36, 38)  He  believed Applicant  was an open,
candid  person.  (Tr.  39)  If  Applicant   received   alcohol-related  therapy,  and   he  stopped
drinking alcohol for six months, the CAF psychologist would conclude that Applicant was
not a risk to security. (Tr. 38-39)
In  2020,  a  forensic,  clinical  psychologist  evaluated  Applicant  (Applicant’s
psychologist). (Tr. 42) He concluded Applicant’s alcohol use was at a normal level at its
highest  point  “and  not  worthy  of  any  kind  of  concern  or  diagnosis.”  (Tr.  46,  57)  At  its
height, Applicant drank about a fifth to a fifth and a half “over the course of a week with
pretty much daily drinking in the evening starting at 6 o’clock.” (Tr. 52) Applicant never
drove a car after drinking (except the one occasion when he was in high school). (Tr. 52)
Applicant had increased tolerance due to his regular alcohol consumption, and therefore
his judgment was not as significantly affected by his alcohol consumption as it would have
been  without  the  increased  tolerance  for  alcohol.  (AE  A  at  7)  Applicant  did  not  suffer
withdrawal from ending his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 55-56) He noted Applicant is “now
completely sober and participating”  in AA meetings. (Tr. 46) He has sustained sobriety
and his prognosis is excellent. (Tr. 46-47) The DSM 5 was issued to reduce subjectivity
in diagnosis. (Tr. 48)
Applicant’s psychologist believed the CAF psychologist’s evaluation was incorrect
because it did not rely on DSM  5 criteria, and Applicant’s alcohol  consumption  did not
have a negative impact on his marriage, social life, and employment, and there were no
arrests.  (Tr.  49-50)  Applicant’s  attendance  at  AA,  does  not  mean  Applicant  is  an
“alcoholic” or suffers from alcohol abuse disorder. (Tr. 50) AA defines “an alcoholic” as
“anyone  for  whom  alcohol  has  been  a  problem.  So  it’s  a  subjective,  self-identification.
.  .  .  And  everybody  who  attends  AA  calls  themselves  an  alcoholic.”  (Tr.  50-51)  The
“alcoholic”  term  in  AA  has  no  medical  standing.  (Tr.  51)  Applicant’s  psychologist
concluded, “to a great degree of psychological certainty, [he] found [Applicant] to suffer
from  no  psychological  or  other  mental  health  limitation  that  would  adversely  affect  his
ability to hold a security clearance.” (AE A at 8)
A licensed  clinical social worker  (LCSW),  licensed  substance abuse professional
(SAP), and  certified substance abuse  counselor  (CSAC),  provided an assessment and
alcohol-related counseling to Applicant  at six  sessions beginning in April 2020.  (AE C; AE
D)  The   LCSW  described  Applicant  as  “candid  and   forthright”   and  indicated  that  he
“exhibited excellent insight into his situation, expressed sincere remorse,  and  has actively
engaged  in  rectifying   his  past   behavior.”  (AE   C  at  2)  Applicant   continued  his  AA
attendance via  Zoom meetings  in  2020. (Id. at 3)  Applicant “did not  experience cravings,
tolerance, withdrawals, blackouts or  hangovers.” (Id. at 4)  Applicant  “passed one  of the
critical  thresholds of sobriety,  namely the  first six  months.” (Id.) This six-month time  period
tense. (Id.) Based  on DSM  5, the
is important because withdrawal symptoms are more in
LCSW diagnosed Applicant with “No Use Disorder”  and  she recommended no treatment.
(Id.)  She recommended approval  of his  access to classified information. (Id. at 5)
Over  the last several years, Applicant decreased  his alcohol consumption as his
family responsibilities increased. (Tr. 63)  In  July 2017, when his spouse  was  expecting
their first  child, he planned to end his alcohol  consumption. (Tr. 79) However, he did not
end   his  alcohol   consumption   until   April  21,  2020,   even  though  he  was  attending  AA
meetings  in   2018   and  2019.  (Tr.   63,  79)  Applicant’s   alcohol   use  did  not  cause  any
problems with the police, courts,  or his employment (aside from the security clearance
issue).  (Tr. 64)  From  April  to June  2020, he  attended alcohol-related counseling, and  his
counseling   reinforced his  decision not  to  consume  alcohol.  (Tr. 69)  Applicant  is happy
with his decision to end his alcohol  consumption. (Tr. 65) In 2020, he lost 45 pounds and
is now  down to 185  pounds. (Tr. 65) His high-blood  pressure has  decreased to normal.
(Tr. 76)  Applicant  has more  energy, and  his circle  of  friends has increased. (Tr.  66)  He
believed that ending his alcohol consumption would be better for his career and alleviate
security  concerns.  (Tr.  66).  He   has  attended  AA  since  2018,  and   he  increased  his
attendance at AA  meetings to at  least once  a week  in  December 2019. (Tr. 67, 78-79).
When he attended AA  meetings, he limited his alcohol  consumption to about “a half a pint
or  so.”  (Tr.   79)   Applicant   believes  that  he   profits   from  AA   attendance.  (Tr.  67)  He   has
committed  himself  to not drinking  alcohol in  the future.  (Tr. 68)  His support  groups are his
family, AA, and  his church. (Tr. 68)  He  brought his AA  sobriety chips to his hearing. (Tr.
80)  Applicant concluded his hearing statement indicating:
I think I’ve been very truthful through this whole entire  process. And when I
say I have no intentions to ever  drink again,  I mean it absolutely. It’s not
worth it to  me.  If it’s going to risk my career  and  being  able to  provide for
my  family  in   any  way,   then  I’m  done  with  it.   And  I  think  I’ve  thoroughly
enjoyed the past  seven months of being completely sober and  abstaining
that I have every intent to stay that way.  (Tr. 81)
Character Evidence
Three  friends who attend the same church with Applicant as well as his spouse
provided  character  statements  supporting   reinstatement  of  Applicant’s   access  to
classified information.  (AE F) The  general sense of their statements is  that Applicant  is
diligent,   knowledgeable,  intelligent,   honest,  and   dependable.   (Id.)  His  wife   said   he
reduced his alcohol consumption in  2018, and completely ended his alcohol  consumption
on April 21, 2020. (Id.) The  termination of his alcohol  use improved his health, energy
level, and  demeanor.  (Id.) Applicant  has received  a bonus and  achievement award from
his employer. (Tr. 60)

"Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  August  2017.  He  submitted  documents  attesting  to  his
superior job performance during that period. He is applying for a security clearance for
the first time. He has about three and a half years of college in  pursuit of a  bachelor’s
degree. He has never married, but he has lived with his girlfriend since about 2008. He
does not have any children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17, 29-30, 43; GE 1; AE A-C)
Applicant has a history of alcohol-related criminal offenses. He was detained for
being drunk in public in 2005. The police held him in jail overnight and released him the
next day without charges. He was arrested in June 2005 and charged with driving under
the influence (DUI). He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of wet reckless. He attended
several alcohol courses. (Tr. at 23-24; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6)
Applicant was arrested in October 2009 and charged with DUI; DUI with a blood
alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  of  .08  or  more;  and  DUI  with  a  BAC  of  .15  to  .20.  He
pleaded  guilty  to  a  reduced  charge  of  reckless  driving,  and  the  other  charges  were
dismissed. He was sentenced to jail for one day (presumably with credit for time served
for the  day he was arrested), a fine,  and alcohol counseling.  (Tr. at 24-27; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6)
Applicant  was  gambling  and  drinking  at  a  casino  in  about  June  2017.  He  lost
about  $500.  He  saw  a  slot  machine  with  about  $100  credit  on  it.  He  waited  about  15
minutes, but there was no indication that anyone was playing the machine. He cashed
out the $100. When he visited the casino about two weeks later, he was confronted by
the casino’s security personnel. He was eventually charged with theft. He paid the $100
back, hired a lawyer, pleaded not guilty, and was prepared to fight the charge with the
defense  that  the  property  had  been  abandoned,  but  the  judge  dismissed  the  charge
without a trial. (Tr. at 18-22; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 7)
Applicant admitted that he drank and gambled too much for a period. He stated
that  he  significantly  cut  back  on  his  drinking  after  he  quit  the  moving  industry  and
started  working more stable jobs  in about 2015,  with  his current job  starting in August
2017.  His  coworkers  are  more  professional  than  his  previous  associates.  He  has  not
been  arrested  or  charged  with  anything  since  the  2017  theft  charge.  (Tr.  at  13-14-17,
27-28, 41, 44-45; GE 2)
Applicant’s  gambling  adversely  affected  his  finances.  He  used  his  credit  and
attempted to win enough to help him with his finances, but the exact opposite occurred
as  his  losses  exacerbated  the  problem.  He  estimated  that  he  lost  $2,500  from  about
March 2017 to June 2017. (Tr. at 30-31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  reported  his  criminal  issues  on  his  August  2017  Questionnaire  for
National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to financial questions, he wrote: “I am
trying to pay off my credit card and personal loan. Just have been a little pushed back
with  attorney  fees  and  rent.”  A  September  2017  credit  report  listed  that  he  had  a
defaulted  student  loan  in  collection,  with  a  balance  of  $20,473.  It  also  reported  two
accounts  with  a  credit  union:  a  credit  card  account  that  was  current  with  a  $16,425
balance;  and  a  loan  that  was  opened  in  April  2017,  was  $107  past  due,  and  had  a
$7,349 balance. (GE 1, 3)
A credit report from January 2019 listed that the balance of Applicant’s defaulted
student loan had been reduced to $14,139. Both credit union accounts were reported as
past due: the credit card account was $1,499 past due with a $15,275 balance; and the
loan was $923 past due with a $6,916 balance. (GE 4)
The SOR alleges the two delinquent credit union accounts. A credit report from
October 2020 listed both accounts as charged off, with balances of $15,270 and $7,004.
That  credit  report  listed  Applicant’s  student  loan  as  current  with  a  balance  of  $9,900.
(GE 5)
Applicant  stated  that  he  concentrated  on  paying  his  student  loans,  and  that  he
paid  more  than  $10,000  towards  them  since  2017.  The  credit  reports  corroborate  that
assertion. He has not made any recent payments toward the credit union accounts. He
stated  that  he  planned  to  contact  the  credit  union  in  an  attempt  to  resolve  the  debts,
either through settlement or a payment plan. He has not received financial counseling.
He rarely goes to the casino, and if he does, he does not take more money than he can
afford to lose. (Tr. at 14, 30-43; GE 3-5)

"Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  is  a  2002  high
school  graduate  and  disclosed  no  further  advanced  education.  He  has  never  been
married. He has a 12-year-old son.
According  to  his  April  2018  SCA,  Applicant  worked  for  private  companies
between 2008 and 2016. During that same period, he was self-employed as the owner
and  operator  of  a  construction  business.  He  was  hired  as  an  optics  technician  by  his
current  employer,  a  federal  contractor  and  security  sponsor,  in  April  2018.  This  is  his
first SCA.
In  his  responses  to  Sections  22  (Police  Record)  of  his  2018  SCA,  Applicant
disclosed a history of alcohol-related and substance misuse offenses. The background
investigation provided additional details about the security concerns alleged in the SOR.
In substance, the SOR alleges under Guideline G that Applicant:
(1)   was  arrested   for   DWI   in  2008   (SOR  1.c).  In   his  SOR  answer,  Applicant
admitted   the   arrest   for  DWI,   but   denied   that  he   was  charged   or  convicted.  Applicant
explained   that  he   tested   .08   on   a   breathalyzer  test   when   he   was  stopped   by   a   police
officer,   and   .06   when   retested   at  the   police   station.  He  was  not  charged   with   any
offenses.
(2) drove  a boat while  intoxicated  in 2012  (SOR 1.b).  Applicant admitted he drove
a  boat  after consuming  six  beers. He pled  guilty  to  the  DWI  and  was fined  about  $400.
The court imposed no  other punishment or requirements; and
(3)  was  charged   with   DWI   and   drinking   beer-wine   while   driving   in  June   2018.
(SOR 1.a)  During  his August 2018  interview, Applicant explained  that in  June  2018,  he
was stopped  by  a  police  officer and  a  subsequent breathalyzer test indicated  a  .08. At
the  police  station, he  refused  to  perform  another breathalyzer test and  he  was charged
with  DWI. He  pled  guilty  to  DWI  and  was fined  $400.  He  was required  to  participate  in
an   alcohol  assessment   and   a   short-term   outpatient  program.  The   assessment   was
favorable to  Applicant  and  it  did  not find  Applicant had  a  problem  with  alcohol. He  was
not  referred   for  any   alcohol  counseling   or  aftercare  treatment.   There  was   no   alcohol
abuse  or dependence  diagnosis  made. Applicant  successfully  completed  the  treatment
program and  his prognosis was considered excellent.  (FORM Items  3  - 5)
Applicant started drinking at age 21. He does not consider himself a big drinker.
He claimed he currently drinks two beers during the weekends, about every other week.
His future plans were to limit his alcohol consumption, and never to drink and drive. He
told  the  investigator that  recurrence  of  a  similar incident  was  unlikely because he  was
consuming  less  alcohol  and  had  learned  his  lesson.  In  his  SOR  Answer,  Applicant
stated “sobriety has been sustained.”
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged
with  possession  of  methamphetamine  and  simple  possession  of  a  Scheduled  II
Controlled  Substance  in  May  2007  (SOR  2.a).  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegation,
and  explained  that  the  possession  of  methamphetamine  charge  was  reduced  by  the
court to  simple  possession  of  a  Schedule  II  Controlled  Substance.  He  was  also found
guilty  of  possession  of  paraphernalia.  He  was  sentenced  to  45  days’  confinement,  12
months’  probation,  to  participate  in  a  substance  abuse  assessment  and  to  attend
treatment.  (FORM,  Items  6,  7)  Applicant  denied  ever  using  the  Schedule  II  Controlled
Substance  and  averred  he  was  charged  because  he  was  in  the  car  with  the  person
possessing it. (FORM Item 3)
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  2018  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency  between  January  2007  and  March  2017  (SOR  2.b).  He  explained  to  the
government investigator that he was an occasional marijuana user. Once in a while he
would have a couple of puffs from a marijuana cigarette being shared among friends at
a party or other social activity. He described his marijuana use as once every four to six
months.  Applicant  denied  using  any  other  illegal  drugs.  He  claimed  he  stopped  using
marijuana in March 2017, because he believed nothing good would ever come from it.
Applicant stated that because of his career obligations he had no intention of ever using
marijuana  or  any  other  controlled  substance  in  the  future.  (FORM,  Item  1  - SOR
answer)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR,  with  explanations,  except  for
SOR allegation ¶ 4.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a  Master’s
of  Science  degree, and  has been  employed with  the  defense contractor  since  June of
2010.  (TR  at  page  7  lines  9~25,  and  GX  1  at  pages  7  and  15.)  Applicant  has  held  a
security clearance since 2001, initially as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. (GX 1 at
pages 36~38.) His “less than a year and a half” marriage was annulled in 2014. (TR at
page 22 lines 5~23, and GX 1 at page 23.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations & Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
1.a. and 4.c. Applicant admits that he failed to file his Federal  and state income
tax  returns  for  tax  years  2014~2018  in  a  timely  fashion.  He  mistakenly  “believed”  that
Applicant did  not  have  “to  file  the  taxes unless .  . . [he] owed  money.” (TR at page  25
line 18 to page 26 line 13.) In 2019 and 2020, he has filed returns for those tax years as
evidenced by documentation from the taxing authorities. (TR at page 40 lines 19~23, at
page 51 lines 7~34, and AppX I.)
Guideline   H  -  Drug   Involvement   and Substance   Misuse   &   Guideline   E   -  Personal
Conduct
2.a.  and  4.c.  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency, from  about 2009
to   at  least  August   of   2018   (a   period   of  more   than   ten   years)   while   holding   a   security
clearance. (TR at page 30  line  22 to page 31 line 2, at page 34 line  8 to page 36 line  19,
at page  37  lines 1-~25, and  at page  40  line  24  to  page  41  line  23.) He avers that he  did
not  know  the  use  of marijuana  was illegal under Federal  law, as  it was legalized  under
state law. (Id.)
This averment is countered by the fact  Applicant used  both  his former spouse’s
and  current  girlfriend’s  marijuana  prescription  to  obtain  the  drug.  (TR at  page  65  lines
7~11, at page 67 line 5 to page 68 line 11, and at page 71 line 17 to page 75 line 1.)
Furthermore,  such  usage  is  clearly  contrary  to  his  employer’s  drug  policy  that  clearly
states:  “Even  though  marijuana  has  been  legalized  in  certain  US  states,  it  is  still
considered  illegal  under  federal  law.  Therefore,  our  company  prohibits  use  even  in
locations where it is not against  state  law.” (TR at page  83  line  1  to  page  84  line  5, at
page   85   line   17   to   page   88   line   1,  and   GX   3   at  page   2.)   Applicant  intends  no   future
illegal drug usage. (AppX J.)
2.b.  and   4.c.   Applicant  used   Hallucinogenic  Mushrooms  twice   in  2010   while
holding  a  security  clearance. Again,  he  avers he  did not  know  such  use  was illegal. (TR
at page  23  line  16  to  page  24  line  2.) This averment does not pass scrutiny, particularly
as his employer warns  against  the  use  of  drugs that may  impair  decision  making. (TR at
page   75   line   2   to   page   76   line   7,   and   GX   3   at   page   2.)   Although   it  appears  that   his
employer  alludes  to   on-the-job   conduct,   “loose   lips  can   sink   ships”  off-the-job,  where
judgment  is  impaired   by   hallucinogens.   Applicant  intends  no   future   illegal  drug   usage.
(AppX J.)
Guideline G  - Alcohol Consumption  & Guideline  E  - Personal Conduct
3.a.~3.d.  and  4.c.  Applicant  admits  that  between  2011  and  April  of  2020,  he
consumed  alcohol  at  times  in  excess  and  to  the  point  of  intoxication.  (TR  at  page  31
lines  3~25,  and  at  page  42  lines  2~11.)  Applicant  further  admits  that  alcohol  was
involved, in about 2013, when he threatened a university employee, who was “cheating”
with his then wife. (TR at page 46 line 4 to page 47 line 6.) He also admits that alcohol
was involved, in about 2013, when he physically assaulted his former spouse who was
“cheating”  on  Applicant.  (TR at  page  43  line  12  to  page  45  line  9.)  In  2018,  Applicant
missed  work,  pursuant  to  his  doctor’s  instruction,  to  address  his  alcohol  consumption.
(TR at page 42 lines 12~22.)
Applicant  now   attends   Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  on   a   regular  basis,  and   last
consumed  the  intoxicant in  April of  2020, about a  year prior to  his hearing. (TR at page
31   lines  3~25.)  In   February   of   2021,  Applicant  was  evaluated   by   a   Licensed   Clinical
Social Worker, who  diagnosed  Applicant as suffering  from  “Mild Alcohol Use  Disorder
–   In  Sustained  Remission.”  (AppX   K   at   page   9,  emphasis  in   original.)  She   further
opined:  “No   Treatment   Warranted.  Continued   participation   in   the   fellowship  of
Alcoholics Anonymous, regular meeting with his  sponsor, and working the steps.”  (Id.)
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
4.a.  Applicant  answer  “No”  to   Section   23   on   his  March  2018   SCA   as  to   “Illegal
Use  of  Drugs   .  .  .  in  the   last  (7)  seven   years  .  .   .  [and]  While   possessing   a   Security
Clearance.” (SCA  at pages 34~35.) This was a  willful falsification, as he  admits to  using
marijuana pursuant to the prescriptions of his former spouse and  his current girlfriend.
4.b. Applicant knowingly  provided  materially  false information  during  a  November
2018   interview   with   a   DoD  investigator  as  to   his  above-mentioned   illegal  drug   usage.
(TR at page  47 lines  14~21.)
4.c.  This allegation  has been discussed  at length, above.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  all  allegations  in  the  SOR  without  explanation.  He  did  not
address  the  paragraphs  (¶¶  2.e,  2.i,  2.m,  2.o,  and  4.b)  that  cross-alleged  conduct
alleged  under  other  guidelines,  but  since  the  underlying  allegations  were  admitted,  I
consider  the  cross-allegations  admitted  as  well.  The  admissions  are  incorporated  into
the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  was  born  in October 1990.  He  is 30  years  old.  He  has  never married
and  he  has  no  children.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  spring  2008.  He  started
college that fall and earned a bachelor’s degree in 2014. He has worked for his current
employer and  clearance  sponsor, a  large  defense  contractor,  since  April 2017.  During
most  of   the   time   since   he   graduated   from   college,  Applicant  worked   for  other
contractors at  the  same  location,  with  some  gaps in employment when  contracts ended.
(Item  3)
Guidelines J &  G:
During   Applicant’s  time   in  college,  he   incurred   multiple   infractions,   allegedly   for
alcohol-related   conduct,  resulting   in  discipline   from   university   authorities.   He  also
incurred  multiple  alcohol-related  arrests  both  during and after his time in college.
The   first  infraction   was  in  October  2008,   after  Applicant   and   his  college
roommate   were  allegedly   playing   a   drinking   game   in  their   dorm   room.  Applicant
explained  in  his  background  interview  that they  had  been  playing  the  game  with  water,
and  not  with  beer.  Nevertheless,  he  was ordered  to  participate  in  an  alcohol-awareness
class,  which  he   did.   (Item   4   at  2-3)  The   university   registrar’s   office  recorded   an
infraction   for  possession   of  “alcohol  paraphernalia”  for  which  Applicant   was  found
“responsible,”  and   that  he   completed   an   “educational  paper”   as  a   sanction.  (Item   8)
(SOR ¶ 2.b)
On  three  additional occasions over the  next  two  years (March 2009, September
2010, and  November 2010), Applicant engaged  in  drinking  in  his dorm  room. (Item  4  at
3)  These   instances  violated   university   policy   prohibiting   underage   drinking.  He  was
ultimately  placed  on  disciplinary  probation  and  removed  from  student housing. (Item  8)
(SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.d, and  2.f)
In   September  2010,  also  while   underage,  Applicant  was  driving   home   after  a
night  out  drinking   with   friends   when   he   was  pulled   over for   speeding.  He  was  given   a
breathalyzer   and   registered   a   0.07   blood   alcohol content  (BAC).  He  was  arrested   and
charged   with   a   misdemeanor offense   of   having   an   unlawful blood   alcohol level (under
21)  of  0.05   or  higher,  while   operating   a   motor  vehicle.  He   pleaded   no   contest  in
December 2010, and  he  was ordered  to  attend  alcohol  counseling  and  a  DUI  program.
His driver’s license  was also  suspended  for a  month. (Item  3  at 39-40; Item  4  at 6)(SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 2.e)
Applicant reported on his SCA that he attended alcohol counseling, with Ms. W,
from  January  to  April  2011,  and  noted  that  it  was  court  ordered.  (Item  4  at  46)  In  his
PSI, he generally referenced his counseling with Ms. W, and noted that she had advised
him  to  abstain  from  alcohol.  (Item  4  at  7)  SOR  ¶  2.g,  which  Applicant  admitted,  also
alleges  that  he  was  diagnosed  at  the  time  with  alcohol  abuse.  Notwithstanding  the
admission,  there  is  no  documented  record  evidence  of  either  the  diagnosis  or  the
treatment in 2011.
On or about September 8, 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving
under  the  influence  (DUI)  with  a  0.14  BAC.  He  reported  in  his  PSI  that  he  and  his
girlfriend had a disagreement in a campus parking lot because they had to move the car
to another lot, and Applicant had been drinking and did not want to drive. (Item 4 at 3)
University police came to the scene and detained him before turning him over to county
police. He spent the night in jail. (Item 4 at 10) Applicant went to court in March 2013,
and entered a no contest plea to the DUI charge. He was convicted, ordered to attend
alcohol  treatment,  a  DUI  program,  and  a  victim-impact  panel,  and  his  driver’s  license
was suspended for a year. (Item 3 at 41-42; Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at 8; Item 7)(SOR ¶¶
1.b, 2.i)
In  addition  to  the  criminal sanctions  resulting  from  this event,  Applicant was  also
found   responsible   by   university   authorities   for  violating   university   policy   regarding
individuals under the  age  of  21  concerning  possession  and/or consumption  of  alcohol,
among   other university   policy   violations  regarding   student  conduct.   University   records,
as  reviewed   by   an   employee   of   the   registrar’s  office,  indicate   that  he   received
disciplinary   probation,   participated   in  a   counseling   assessment,   and   completed   court
sanctions. (Item  8 at 2) (SOR ¶ 2.h)
SOR ¶  2.j, which is also  based  on  review  of  university  records,  alleges that on  or
about  September   17,  2012,  Applicant  was  found   responsible,  sanctioned,  and
suspended   for  non-compliance   with   an   official  request,   complicity   in  violating   the
student code of  conduct,  disruptive  conduct, and hazing. (Item  8) SOR ¶  2.j also alleges
that  Applicant  “had  consumed  alcohol prior to  this  offense.” This  “offense”  is not detailed
anywhere in the  record, even  in Applicant’s PSI,  unless  it is already  covered  in SOR ¶
2.i. (Item  4  at  3)  Notwithstanding  Applicant’s admission  to  SOR ¶  2.j, it is  unclear what
“conduct” or “offense” is addressed  in  the  allegation, and  the details of  the  sanctions  are
undocumented.
Applicant reported on his SCA that he attended additional court-ordered alcohol
counseling  with  Ms.  W  from  January  to  May  2013.  (Item  45-46).  This  was  part  of  his
sentence for the September 2012 DUI offense discussed above. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.i) In his
PSI, Applicant generally referenced his counseling with Ms. W, and noted that she had
advised him to abstain from alcohol. (Item 4 at 7) SOR ¶ 2.k, which Applicant admitted,
also alleges that he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Notwithstanding the admission,
there  is  no  documented  record  evidence  of  either  the  diagnosis  or  the  treatment  in
2013.
In  September  2013,  Applicant  was  again  found  responsible  by  university
authorities for violation of university policy regarding guests and alcohol, and complicity
in  violating  the  student  code  of  conduct.  He  was  required  to  take  a  course  and  was
reprimanded.  (Item  8)  Applicant  reported  in  his  PSI  that  this  concerned  a  party  in  his
dorm  room  that  was  broken  up  by  the  RA.  (Item  4  at  3)  (SOR  ¶  2.l)  While  Applicant
admitted  the  allegation,  there  is  no  documentation  in  the  record  to  detail  the
circumstances  of  this  incident,  alcohol-related  or  otherwise.  There  is  nothing  in  the
record to reflect that Applicant himself was drinking at the time.
In  January 2014,  Applicant  was  detained  by university police  after an argument
with  his  girlfriend.  He  had  been  drinking.  (Item  4  at  9)  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  2.m)  The  record
does  not  reflect  that  he  was  arrested  as  a  result.  He  was  again  disciplined  by  the
university for his disruptive conduct, and placed on probation. (Item 8 at 2)(SOR ¶ 2.n)
Applicant graduated from the university in spring 2014.
In November 2016, Applicant was driving home when he fell asleep at a red light.
He was awakened by police, and arrested for DUI after he refused a field sobriety test
and a breathalyzer. (Item 4 at 6) In May 2017, Applicant pleaded no contest to the DUI
charge  and  was  convicted.  He  was  sentenced  to  10  days  of  confinement,  ordered  to
attend  a  16-week  substance  abuse  program,  a  DUI  program,  and  weekly  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA) meetings.  He  received  one  year of  probation,  was  required  to  install
an  ignition  interlock  device  on  his  car,  and  his  driver’s  license  was  revoked  for  five
years. (Item 3 at 42-43; Item 6 at 6-7; Item 7)(SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.o)
After spending two days in jail, Applicant spent eight days in an inpatient alcohol
facility in May 2017. His initial assessment by the counselor, Mr. S, was a diagnosis of
severe alcohol use disorder. Applicant disclosed prior marijuana use that ended several
years before, and drinking several times a week from age 18 until the time of his most
recent  DUI  arrest,  in  November  2016.  On  discharge  from  the  16-week  program
(including  outpatient  treatment)  in  August  2017,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with
polysubstance  use  disorder,  in  early,  partial  remission.  He  was  advised  to  maintain
abstinence from drugs and alcohol. (Item 5 at 17-22) (SOR ¶ 2.p)
Guideline E
Applicant submitted  his SCA in  September 2017,  and  had  his initial background
interview  (PSI)  in March  2018. The  summary of  his  PSI reflects that Applicant discussed
his  high   school,  community   college,  and   undergraduate   education.   It   also  states  that
“after the Subject [Applicant] provided  he had  no disciplinary issues while at [his college,
identified   by   name],   the   Subject  was  confronted”  with   his  numerous  disciplinary
incidents, including  those  alleged  at SOR ¶¶  2.b, 2.c, 2.d, 2.h, 2.l, and  2.n. (Item  3  at 2-
4) SOR ¶  4.a  alleged  that Applicant falsified  material facts when  he  stated  to  the  OPM
investigator that  he  had  no  disciplinary  actions at  his university, when  in  fact  he  did,  and
deliberately   sought  to   conceal  that   information.  Applicant  admitted   SOR  ¶   4.a   without
explanation.
In March 2019, the DOD CAF sent Applicant an interrogatory about his history of
alcohol  involvement.  (Item  5)  He  reported  drinking  one  to  six beers,  twice  a  week,  on
weekends, between November 2016 (his most recent DUI) and Christmas 2017. (Item 5
at  3-4)  Applicant’s  acknowledged  drinking  up  to  at  least  Christmas  2017  was  after  he
was advised to abstain from alcohol use as recently as August 2017, by Mr. S., in the
substance abuse program. (SOR ¶ 2.q)
Guideline I
In  January  2020,  DOD  CAF  referred  Applicant  for  a  psychological  evaluation.
The  evaluator,  Dr.  B,  a  Ph.D.  licensed  clinical  psychologist  and  board-certified
neuropsychologist, reviewed Applicant’s 2017 counseling records and his 2018 report of
investigation  (ROI)  from  2018,  including  his  background  interview  summaries.  The
evaluation  report  reflects  that  Applicant  reported  his  most  recent  use  of  alcohol  was
Christmas 2018, not Christmas 2017; he said he consumed five or six drinks  at a time
which he also estimated as the “normal” amount of consumption  for the average person.
(Item  6 at 6-7)
In her report (Item 6 at 8), Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder,
severe (provisional). (SOR ¶ 2.r) She concluded as follows:
While  I  cannot  confirm   a   personality   disorder  in  this  case,  it  is  worth   of
note   that  I  identified   this  applicant  as  having   an   overly   inflated   sense   of
self-worth   and   lack  of  acceptance   for  his  inappropriate   illegal  behaviors
historically,  which  could   be   indicative   of   the   very   diagnosis  of   antisocial
personality   disorder  indicated   by   his  psychological  testing.  However,
based  on  the  medical records and  history  of  this applicant,  a  diagnosis of
alcohol  use   disorder,  severe,  is  certainly   likely.  Though   he   reports  not
drinking   for  a   little  over  a   year,  he   has  a   recent  history   of   giving   varying
information  about his alcohol intake  and  his  general  lack of insight into  the
problematic  behavior is concerning   to   me   as   a   clinician.  I  have   concerns
regarding   his  risk  of  relapse.  He   is  not  in   treatment,  and   has   received
treatment  only   when   mandated   by   this  [sic]  courts   and   his  inconsistent
reporting   of  use   leads  me   to   believe   he   still   may   be   abusing   alcohol;
however, at minimum  it raises  concerns  about his  candor  and  as  such  his
reliability/judgment/trustworthiness.  His  insight  is   poor.  (Item   6   at  8)
(Emphasis added)
When  Applicant  answered  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations  without
providing  any  explanation  or  comment.  He  also  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  He
therefore did not offer any evidence to mitigate any security concerns established by the
Government.
",False
"The SOR alleges that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to
the point of intoxication, from about 2005 to present, and that she continues to consume
alcohol despite two diagnoses of alcohol use disorder, one qualified as moderate in 2019,
and the other as mild in 2017. (SOR ¶ 1.d) Specifically, the SOR alleged that: in 2005,
while in the Army, Applicant was reprimanded for being involved in a physical altercation
where alcohol was involved (SOR  ¶ 1.g); in  2008,  Applicant participated  in the  Army’s
Alcohol Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) (SOR ¶ 1.c); in 2015, she was arrested and
charged  with  alcohol-related  misconduct  (breaking  and  entering,  receiving  stolen
property,  criminal mischief, and theft) (SOR ¶  1.f); and  in 2017,  she  was  arrested and
charged  with  alcohol-related  misconduct  (criminal  mischief,  aggravated  assault,  public
drunkenness, and disorderly conduct). It also alleged that in 2017, she was treated for
alcohol abuse and diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, mild (SOR ¶ 1.b); and in 2019,
she was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, moderate (SOR ¶ 1.a).
Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that:  “Your boyfriend, with whom you have
cohabited, is a citizen of India residing in the United States.” (SOR ¶ 2.a, as amended);
and that she continues to associate with an ex-boyfriend who is a Saudi Arabian citizen
working for the Saudi embassy (SOR ¶ 2.b).
Applicant  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations,  except  for  (SOR  ¶  1.e),  which  she
admitted. Applicant’s SOR admission and those at her hearing are incorporated herein
as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant,  35,  graduated from  high  school  in 2004,  and  received  her bachelor’s
degree in 2014. She enlisted in the U.S. Army  after high school and honorably served
until November 2008, when she was discharged as an E-4. During her service, she held
a clearance; was deployed twice for 15-months to a combat area; and was awarded three
Army Commendation Medals for distinguished performance, a Good Conduct Medal, and
received  a  highly  prestigious  award  for  exceptional  performance.  Applicant  married  in
2010 and divorced in 2012. She has a daughter, age 12, of this relationship.
In 2005, while deployed abroad, Applicant, a friend, and two other soldiers were
consuming  alcoholic  beverages.  After  a  verbal  altercation,  she  threw  a  drink  into  a
soldier’s face and all four were involved in a physical altercation. The two other soldiers
were  intoxicated.  There  is  no  evidence  Applicant  and  her  friend  were  intoxicated.  She
received an oral reprimand for the offense. (GE 6) In May 2008, Applicant completed 16
hours of ASAP. She testified that she attended ASAP to earn promotion points, and not
because she was ordered to do so. (AE 14; GE 3)
Applicant  attended  college  between  2009  and  2014.  While  in  college,  Applicant
studied Arabic. The Arabic class also hosted Middle East students learning English. The
professor required students to interact and teach each other their respective languages.
In  early  2014,  Applicant  met  a  citizen  of  Saudi  Arabia  in  the  Arabic  class,  and  they
developed  a  romantic  relationship.  (Tr.  19-20)  In  December  2014,  he  graduated  and
moved  back  to  Saudi  Arabia.  He  returned  to  the  United  States  in  early  2015,  but  the
relationship had ended in May 2015, except for a few emails.
Applicant has had no personal contact with the Saudi national since 2015. In April
2017,  he  contacted  Applicant  by  email  to  tell  her  he  was  back  in  the  United  States  to
complete his doctorate degree, and informed her he was working at the Saudi embassy.
They had infrequent email contact until June 2017. Applicant has had no contact with the
Saudi Arabian citizen during the last three years. She reported her contact with the Saudi
national in her April 2017 SCA. (GE 1; Tr. 31)
Applicant  has  a  romantic  relationship  with  a  citizen  of  India  (IC)  residing  in  the
United States under a work visa. He is 38 years old and entered the United States in 2010
on a student visa and never left. They met via a dating website in November 2015. After
some  dating  in  early  2016,  they  started  living  together  as  a  couple  in  July  2016.
Apparently, he moved out of her apartment in July 2017, and the relationship ended in
February 2018 for 10 months.
In December 2018, Applicant and IC rekindled their relationship and are now in a
long-distance  romantic  relationship.  He  is  a  chemical  engineer  working  on  developing
batteries  for  a  company  in  another  state.  Applicant  and  IC  communicate  daily  via
telephone calls, emails, or text messages. The relationship is getting more serious. He is
schedule to  visit Applicant’s parents sometime after the hearing. Applicant has met his
parents and other family member via the internet. (Tr. 65-73)
According  to  Applicant,  IC  never  worked  for  the  Indian  government  and  is  not
involved with its military or intelligence services. She does not know what IC’s parents do
for a living in India or whether he has relatives with connections to the Indian government,
its  military,  or  intelligence  services.  She  does  not  know  how  IC  paid  for  his  master’s
education in the United States; however, she believes he did a work-study program for
his doctorate, and either the Indian government helped him or he received a scholarship.
(Tr. 113-114) She reported her contact with IC in her April 2017 SCA. (GE 1)
In   2015,   Applicant  consumed   alcoholic  beverages  to   excess. While  intoxicated,
she   fell   through   a   pharmacy   door  and   used   the   pharmacy’s  bathroom.  While   in  the
bathroom,  she  stole about $289  of  merchandise.  The  next day, Applicant walked  into  a
police   station   and   self-reported   her  misconduct.   She   was  charged   with   burglary,  theft,
receiving  stolen  property, and  criminal mischief. In  December 2015, pursuant to  a  pre-
trial agreement,  Applicant plead  guilty  to  simple  criminal trespass. She  was fined  $300,
plus court costs, and  paid $300  in restitution.  All  other charges were  dismissed. (GE 7)
Following this incident, Applicant did not seek substance abuse counseling.
In February 2017, Applicant consumed alcoholic beverages to excess while taking
Chantix,  a  smoke  cessation  drug.  Chantix  was  prescribed  to  Applicant  by  a  Veterans
Affairs  physicians’  assistant.  (AE  15)  Chantix’s  literature  indicates  that  some  people
develop changes in behavior including agitation, hostility, depression, suicidal thoughts,
aggression, hallucinations, and paranoia. The drug also increases the impairment due to
alcohol consumption. (AE 16)
While  intoxicated,  Applicant’s  behavior  became  aberrational,  as  if  suffering  a
psychotic episode. She abruptly left her apartment without proper clothing or shoes for
the weather conditions. She had suicidal ideations, and climbed a tree, from which she
fell.  She  was  screaming belligerently and  police  officers responded.  Applicant  resisted
arrest and physically assaulted several police officers. She was charged with aggravated
assault,  drunkenness,  and  disorderly  conduct.  In  September  2017,  she  pled  guilty  to
disorderly conduct hazardous/physical offense. She was fined $300 and required to pay
court costs and fees. The court required Applicant to attend anger management classes
(AE  18),  and  to  participate  in  a  mental  health  and  substance  use  disorder  evaluation.
Applicant stopped taking Chantix after the February 2017 incident.
In April 2017, Applicant participated on a mental health and substance use disorder
evaluation.  The  evaluation  was  performed  by  a  Veterans  Affairs  physician  with  a
doctorate  degree  in  psychology.  Applicant  told  the  psychologist  she  first  consumed
alcohol  when  she  enlisted  in  the  Army  at  age  18.  Her  heaviest  consumption  period
occurred  while  in  the  service,  from  age  18  to  21.  She  reported  having  about  a  dozen
blackouts during that period. After her discharge, she substantially reduced her alcohol
consumption because she was raising her daughter as a sole parent. She claimed that
prior to the February 2017 incident, she was consuming about a six-pack of beer or a pint
of  vodka  over  the  course  of  a  weekend.  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use
disorder – mild. No follow-up treatment was recommended. (AE 17; GE 3)
After her February 2017 incident, Applicant did not seek alcohol counseling. She
stopped  drinking  for  about  three  months,  and  then  started  consuming  light  beer.  She
consumed  approximately six light  beers  during  a  period  of  three  to  five  hours,  twice  a
month while socializing. The consumption of six beers made her feel a little giddy. (GE 5)
Applicant testified that she has not been involved in any alcohol-related misconduct after
February  2017.  However,  she  has  continued  consuming  alcohol  to  the  point  of
intoxication. The last time she remembers drinking to intoxication was in May 2019. In her
July 2020 answer to interrogatories, Applicant indicated she was consuming three to five
beers daily with dinner, about two mixed drinks once a month, and two to four glasses of
wine monthly. Her most recent consumption of alcohol was two weeks before the hearing,
after returning from a deployment. (Tr. 105)
In  May  2019,  Applicant  participated  in a  psychological evaluation  requested  by  the
DOD CAF. It was  performed by a licensed psychologist. (GE 2) The report indicates that
after the  February  2017  incident,  Applicant resumed  consuming  alcoholic beverages in
June   2017.   She   claimed   she   was  consuming   light  beers,  five   or  more   drinks  on   a   bi-
monthly   basis.  In   May   2019,  Applicant  stated   she   does  not  consume   alcohol  while
deployed  - about seven  times since  she  was hired, for a  period  of about  three  months at
a time.
Applicant  reported  to  the  psychologist  in  2019  that  she  currently  consumes
approximately eight glasses of wine per week, but not every day. She noted the greatest
number  of  drinks  she  will  consume  include  a  six-pack  of  light  beer  over  a  weekend,
approximately five times per month.
According the psychologist, Applicant has  engaged in habitual binge drinking to
the point of impaired judgment; used alcohol to cope with emotional distress; does not
acknowledge her substance abuse issues; and continues to engage in binge drinking and
regular use of alcohol. The psychologist concluded Applicant has an alcohol use disorder,
moderate.  Because  Applicant  continued  to  drink  after her history of  legal charges,  the
psychologist  believes  her  drinking  behavior  seems  imprudent  and  considered  her
diagnosis as guarded. She concluded Applicant presents a condition that could pose a
significant  risk  to  her  judgment,  reliability,  or  trustworthiness  concerning  classified
information. (GE 2)
Applicant  has  been  working  for  her  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor,  a
federal  contractor,  since  September  2015.  Her  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information was continued during her current employment. Applicant has excelled in her
job, and was promoted  to a leadership position. She is a team technical lead handling
important  projects  with  direct  impact  on  deployed  U.S.  personnel.  She  has  received
commendations  from  her  employer,  supervisors,  coworkers,  and  clients  for  her
exceptional performance. She is the “go-to” person for help with the company programs
when there are problems. Applicant is considered to be trustworthy, reliable, dependable,
knowledgeable,  and  demonstrates  excellent  communication  skills  and  leadership.
Applicant  has  deployed  abroad  about  seven  times  since  she  was  hired,  sometimes  to
dangerous conflict areas. (Tr. 31-33; AE 8, 9, 10)
",True
"The SOR alleges under Guideline I (SOR ¶ 1.a) that Applicant received mental-
health treatment from approximately May 2017 to December 2018 for  diagnosed major
depressive  disorder-single  episode,  other specified  anxiety disorders, cannabis abuse,
and  alcohol  dependence  in  remission;  under  Guideline  G  that  Applicant  consumed
alcohol at times to excess and intoxication, from age 20 to at least February 2020 (SOR
¶  2.a)  and  that  a  licensed  psychologist  determined  in  February  2020  that  Applicant’s
current  and  continued  level  of  alcohol  use  could  impact  his  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness (SOR ¶ 2.b); under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana from age
18 to at least February 2020 (SOR ¶ 3.a) and that he abused non-prescribed Ativan in
January 2017 and was fired from his job after testing positive for the drug (SOR ¶ 3.b);
and under Guideline F that, as of the issuance of the SOR on October 27, 2020, Applicant
owed  charged-off  debt  totaling  $24,444  on  four  accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  4.a-4.d);  a  $406
collection debt (SOR ¶ 4.e); a mortgage debt of $152,484 in foreclosure and $25,239 past
due (SOR ¶ 4.f); and a $25 medical collection debt (SOR ¶ 4.g).
When Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations except
for the mortgage delinquency (SOR ¶ 4.f) and possibly the medical collection debt, which
he had been unable to confirm. He indicated that the mortgage loan was refinanced in
October  2020   and   is   no   longer  in  foreclosure  proceedings.  Regarding   the   Guideline   I
concern,   he   explained   that  he   was  currently   in  mental-health   treatment.   As  for   the
Guideline   G  concerns,  Applicant  stated   that  he   tries  to   drink  responsibly   when   he
consumes alcohol,  and  that if  he  had  continued  drinking  at the  same  level as February
2020,  it  “could  have   an   impact   on   [his]  judgment   and   reliability,  but  not  concerning
classified  information.”  He acknowledged  that he  has used  cannabis from  about age  18
to   the   present,   at  a   level  and   frequency   that  has   fluctuated   over   the   years,  but  he
explained   that  he   is  now   a   medical  marijuana   patient.   Applicant  admitted   that  he   had
taken  the  Ativan  to  relax  while  being  unaware  of the  possible  consequences for his non-
prescribed  use. About  his financial issues,  Applicant explained  that   he  and  his spouse
needed  to  settle  their  mortgage  foreclosure  situation  before  resolving  other debts and  that
they  are seeking  legal advice as to  the  best course of  action  to  settle  their  debts.  He cited
several  factors  (loss  of   employment,   an   unplanned   pregnancy,   a   knee   injury,  his
underemployment, his spouse’s car  accident  and  her drug  rehabilitation)  as  causes  of his
financial difficulties.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old, married, and the father of two sons, ages six and eight.
A high school graduate, he completed Class A commercial driver training in December
2014 and took a five-week design/drafting course in 2018. He was employed full time by
a defense contractor as a mechanical draftsman learner for about 11 days from April 2018
to May 2018, when he was laid off for lack of a security clearance while his application
for security clearance eligibility was pending. He indicates that he is subject to rehire if
his clearance eligibility is adjudicated favorably. (GE 1; Tr. 25.)
Substance Use  and Psychological Issues
Applicant started drinking alcohol in high school and using cannabis shortly after
graduating  from  high  school  at  age  18.  (Tr.  37.)  He  has  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency since then, including four times a week from ages 18 to 38. (GE 3.) However,
there were also times of abstention from marijuana for as long as three or four years. (Tr.
39.) Applicant purchased marijuana for his own consumption, at times on a weekly basis.
(Tr. 39.) He has continued to use marijuana, albeit now with a medical marijuana card,
and  to  use  alcohol.  He  engaged  in heavy drinking from ages  20 to  25, although  there
have been times when he has abstained, and also times of responsible consumption. (GE
3; Tr. 47.)
In June 1993, after Applicant consumed 12 beers to intoxication while socializing
with friends, he and his friends stole some items from unlocked vehicles and garages.
Felony  burglary  and  larceny  charges  were  filed  against  Applicant  but  eventually  not
prosecuted.  After  Applicant  consumed  ten  beers  at  a  bar  in  October  1997,  he  was
involved in an altercation with two men. He paid a fine for misdemeanor assault. In July
1999, Applicant was arrested for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin).
The drug had been left in his vehicle by a friend in May 1999. Applicant admitted illegal
possession, and  in December 1999, he  was sentenced  to  six  months in jail (deferred),
one   year  of  probation,  and   a   $500   fine.   (GEs  1-2,  6.)   Applicant   refrained   from   any
marijuana  use  while  he  was on  probation  because  he  was subject  to  random  urinalysis.
A  year or two  later, he  resumed  using  marijuana  with  a  new  roommate, whom  Applicant
indicates was “a regular smoker.” (Tr. 38.)
Applicant was employed as a dealer and table games supervisor at a casino from
October 1996 to March 2001 and again from September 2001 to March 2014 when he
was terminated following a few incidents involving co-workers or patrons. In September
2015,  Applicant  began  working  as  a  commercial  truck  driver.  Applicant  refrained  from
using any marijuana for close to three years while in training for, and then working as a
truck driver. (Tr. 41-42.) He was terminated from that job in January 2017 after he failed
a random urinalysis. He tested positive for taking Ativan that his spouse gave him from
her  prescription.  He  had  been  experiencing  considerable  anxiety  related  to  some
accidents on the job, and neither he nor his spouse realized it was a banned substance.
(GEs 1, 6.) He had used the Ativan as a sleep aid approximately three times in December
2016. (Tr. 46.)
Depressed and experiencing anxiety to the point where his spouse was concerned
about his mental health, Applicant voluntarily received outpatient mental-health treatment
from  late  May  2017  to  mid-December  2018  for  diagnosed  major  depressive  disorder-
single  episode,  other  specified  anxiety  disorders,  cannabis  abuse-uncomplicated,  and
alcohol dependence, in remission. He reported on intake that he drank about six beers
per week and was “self-medicating” with marijuana four times a week. (Tr. 40.) He was
prescribed  Zoloft  and  advised  to  cease  using  marijuana  and  to  continue  sobriety  with
respect to his alcohol use. The clinical records do not expressly indicate that he was told
to cease using alcohol. However, Applicant testified that the psychiatrist told him to stop
drinking.  (Tr.  60.)  During  a  session  on  June  7,  2017,  Applicant  complained  of  anger
management  issues  and  worry  about  finances.  He  reported  medical  marijuana  use  to
treat a physical condition and occasional alcohol use. At each session, the psychiatrist
advised him to decrease and stop using marijuana, and discussed “the risks of marijuana
with mood worsening [in the] long run.” With adjustments to his Zoloft and the additions
of Trazodone and Buspar to his medication regimen, Applicant’s mental health improved.
During a session on September 18, 2017, Applicant reported that he had decreased his
marijuana use in that he had smoked the drug only once in the last month. He declined
therapy beyond an initial session because of his finances. (GEs 2-3, 6.) Applicant asserts
that  he  reduced  his  consumption  of  alcohol  “quite  a  bit”  while  in  treatment  with  the
psychiatrist because he was taking psychiatric medications. (Tr. 35.)
Applicant refrained from marijuana use while looking for work and then in training
to work for a defense contractor because he did not want it to be held against him by a
future  employer.  He  passed  a  hair  follicle  test  administered  for  employment  with  the
defense contractor. (Tr. 43-44.) On March 29, 2018, Applicant completed a Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF 86) to work for a defense contractor. He disclosed that
he  had  been  in  treatment  since  approximately  June  2017  for  “borderline  personality
disorder”  and  that  he  had  been  arrested  in  1993,  1997,  and  1999.  In  response  to  an
inquiry concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years, Applicant reported that he
had failed a random drug test after taking some of his spouse’s anti-anxiety medication
three  or  four  times  in  a  week  in  December  2016  while  struggling  with  major  anxiety
because he had recently witnessed a suicide by a man stepping out in front of a truck
ahead of him, and, on another occasion, he had locked the brakes on his truck when cut
off by another vehicle on the highway. He denied any other illegal use of a drug in the
previous seven years. (GE 1.)
On June 12, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he had received medication
management  for  “borderline  personality  disorder”  with  symptoms  of  depression  and
anxiety  for  the  past  year,  and  that  he  had  attended  one  session  of  therapy  at  the
recommendation of his psychiatrist. (GE 6.) The session occurred on June 8, 2017. (GE
2.) There is no indication that  Applicant told the OPM investigator about his marijuana
use  or  that  he  was  asked  about  any  use  of  cannabis.  Applicant  explained  to  the
investigator  that  he  elected  not  to  pursue  therapy  because  he  felt  better  on  his
medications, and it was expensive. Applicant discussed his use of his spouse’s Ativan in
December  2016,  and  his  positive  drug  screen  that  led  to  the  loss  of  his  commercial
driver’s license and employment as a truck driver. (GE 6.)
Applicant stopped seeing the psychiatrist after December 2018. He elected instead
to  have  his  psychiatric  medications  prescribed  and  monitored  by  his  primary  care
physician.  His  primary  care  physician  suggested  that  he  apply  for  the  state’s  medical
marijuana program  to  address some physical  ailments. Applicant  obtained his medical
marijuana  card  in  August  2019,  which  allows  him  to  purchase  up  to  2½  ounces  of
marijuana  per  month  from  state-authorized  dispensaries.  (Tr.  35,  40,  66-67.)  His
physician  has  to  annually  recertify  his  need  for  marijuana.  (Tr.  40.)  Applicant  is  in  his
second year of the program. (Tr. 66.)
During the course of its background investigation, the OPM obtained the records
of  Applicant’s  treatment  with  his  former  psychiatrist.  In  early  2020,  the  DCSA  CAF
referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation to a licensed psychologist because of
his history of alcohol and cannabis use and his mental-health treatment reflected in the
psychiatrist’s records. During the February 29, 2020 psychological evaluation, Applicant
reported using both tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD for medical issues under his
state’s medical marijuana program, about three times a day, as prescribed by his primary
care  physician  “as  needed  for  any  symptoms  that  may  arise.”  (Tr.  43.)  Applicant’s
judgment  and  insight  were  assessed  as  adequate,  and  he  appeared  relaxed  for  his
interview. He reported no current issues with symptoms of depression, euphoria, mood
disturbance,  or  anxiety,  but  he  indicated  that  he  had  stress  because  of  some  life
circumstances, including involving his spouse, who, after totaling his car in an accident in
August  2019,  checked  herself  into  a  rehabilitation  program.  He  reported  that  he  was
working for his uncle at the time, but had to quit to care for his sons. (GE 2.)
During the evaluation, Applicant admitted that he had consumed alcohol on a daily
basis before his spouse went into rehabilitation. His uncle kept beer at work, and he would
sometimes drink with  his uncle at the  end  of the  work day. Applicant  would then  drink at
home  with  his wife, a  half  to  a  full  pint  of liquor per night.  Following  his spouse’s return
from   her  rehabilitation   program   in   mid-November  2019,  Applicant  limited   his  alcohol
consumption   to   once  every   two   weeks,  and   generally   beer rather than  hard  liquor. He
refrained  from  drinking  in his spouse’s presence, but a  friend  would share a  six-pack with
him  when  his spouse  was out of  the  house. Applicant reported  having  consumed  three
beers  and  two  nips  of liquor with  his brother the  night  before  his  February  2020  evaluation,
but no  drinking  for 1½  weeks before that. He stated  that had  abstained  for two  or three
weeks before  his use  1½  weeks prior to his evaluation.  He explained  that  he  did  not find
it  difficult   to   maintain  that   level  of  consumption.  As  for  his  use   of  medical  marijuana,
Applicant  indicated   he   generally   smoked   or  vaped   three   times  a   day:  first  thing   in   the
morning,  after  work,  and   before  going   to   sleep   at  night.   The   psychologist  opined   that
Applicant did  not currently  meet  the  diagnostic criteria  for a  diagnosable mental-health
condition  and  that  the symptoms  that led  him  to  seek psychiatric treatment in  2017  were
sufficiently   managed   with   medication.  The   alcohol  dependence   diagnosis  of   2017
appeared   to   be  based   on   Applicant’s previous heavy  drinking   when  he  was in his 20s.
The   psychologist  nonetheless  expressed   some   concern   about  Applicant’s  recent  daily
drinking.  Although   noting   the   absence   of   any   alcohol-related   consequences   and   the
reduction  in  Applicant’s drinking  since  November  2019,  the  psychologist opined  that  “his
continued  use  of alcohol does not reflect good  judgment  in light of his history  of  alcohol
dependence, and  this could be  detrimental to  his judgment,  reliability  or trustworthiness
concerning   classified   information.”  As  for  Applicant’s  use   of   medical  marijuana,  “while
permitted  under the laws of his state, [it] is exclusionary for granting a security clearance
under federal guidelines.” (GE 2.)
In May 2020, Applicant’s brother passed away. Applicant “got into a bad habit of
drinking.” (Tr. 61-62.) After drinking heavily that summer, including up to 12 to 15 drinks
of beer and a few nips over the course of a day while on vacation, he realized that he had
to  get  his drinking under control.  (Tr.  62-63.) Applicant  began  weekly treatment with  a
licensed professional mental-health counselor in November 2020. (AE D; tr. 37.) In May
2021, the counselor opined that Applicant had not previously truly addressed his trauma
and mood-related history before now, and that his reported “co-existing issues such as
alcohol  use,  excessive  spending  of  money,  etc.  are  all  symptoms  of  this.”  She
acknowledged  the  DOD’s  concerns  “regarding  the  issues  outlined  that  could  impact
[Applicant’s]  judgment,
truthfulness  regarding  classified
information,” and  indicated  that  he  has  started  the  process,  “with  a  genuine  intent,”  to
work  on  improving  his  situation.  She  noted  that  some  of  the  DOD’s  concerns  had
improved, although she did not elaborate in that regard about which issues. She did not
provide a diagnosis but addressed his current need for time in therapy and medication
management to address his issues, including his substance-use issues. (AE D.)
impulses,  reliability,  and
As  of  his  May  2021  hearing,  Applicant’s  psychiatric  medications  were  being
monitored by a nurse practitioner. (Tr. 33-34.) Applicant testified that he has worked on
his drinking, and that he does not consume as much alcohol as he had in the past. (Tr.
31.) About his current consumption, Applicant testified:
I might have  about five  drinks a  week. My  wife  doesn’t allow  me  to  have
drinks at the  house  here very much. But every once  in awhile, I’ll  meet a
friend out and we’ll have a beer or two. Maybe a beer and a nip – fishing or
something. (Tr. 48.)
As  to   why  he   continues  to   consume   alcohol  despite   his  previous  diagnosis  of
alcohol dependence  –  in remission  and  being  advised  to  stop  drinking  by  a  psychiatrist,
Applicant responded,  “Don’t know. I’ve  always drank just casually. I’ve  never seen  it as
being  a  problem  if  I only  have  two  or three  drinks. It’s when  I get carried  away.” (Tr. 60-
61.)  Sometime  in  April 2021, Applicant  consumed  nine  or ten  beers  while  socializing  with
friends in his own  home. He admits that he  “definitely  was over the  legal limit at some
point during the day.” (Tr. 64-65.) Applicant believes that he can control his drinking. (Tr.
65.)
Applicant  continues  to  consume  cannabis  three  times  a  day  as  a  medical
marijuana card holder in his state. (Tr. 31, 42-43.) He knows that the defense contractor
has a drug policy. However, he also testified that he knows that there are people working
for  the  defense  contractor  with  their  medical  marijuana  certifications.  (Tr.  44-45.)  He
believes that “there’s a strong possibility” that he can work for the defense contractor and
still use marijuana as long as he has a medical marijuana card. (Tr. 44.) However, he also
testified that if it is not possible to use marijuana and work for a defense contractor, he
could stop using and attempt to find alternative treatment for his medical conditions. (Tr.
44.) He would like to continue his medical marijuana use. (Tr. 45.)
Finances
Applicant opened some credit card accounts early on in his marriage to establish
credit so that he and his spouse could buy a house. (Tr. 49.) He and his spouse did not
always spend wisely, and she did not return to work immediately after the birth of their
first child in March 2013 due to postpartum depression. (Tr. 49.) After losing his job at the
casino in March 2014, Applicant was unemployed until September 2015. He spent the
time caring for his then infant son, and he collected unemployment compensation during
that  time.  (GE  6.)  From  October  2014  until  December  2014,  Applicant  attended  and
completed a commercial driver training course. (GEs 1-2, 6.) For about 12 to 18 months,
he and his spouse were “treading water,” but it got to the point where they relied on credit
to pay their utility bills and purchase groceries. (Tr. 49.) His spouse spent irresponsibly,
and their financial situation “got out of control.” (Tr. 50.)
After testing  positive  for Ativan  in December 2016, Applicant lost  his commercial
driver’s  license.  He  struggled   to   find   suitable   employment,   and   was  unemployed   from
January   2017   to   May   2017.  During   that  time,  he   attended   school  for  bartending.  His
spouse  took  $20,000  from  her  retirement funds to  support  their  family. (GE 6.)  Applicant
worked  as a  traffic controller for a  security  company  from  May  2017  to  July  2017,  when
he   was  laid   off   for  lack  of   work.   In   August  2017,  Applicant  began   working   at  a   pizza
restaurant.  After only  three  or four days on  the  job, he  injured  his knee. He filed  a  worker’s
compensation claim, and he elected not to return to that job. (GEs 1, 6.) He received a
settlement of $9,500 for his injury. (GE 6.)
Applicant was unemployed from August 2017 to January 2018. He held temporary
employment  for  a  short  time  in  January  2018,  but  he  was  terminated  when  he  was
observed wearing a knee brace to work. Through his state, he enrolled in a manufacturing
pipeline  design  program  at  a  community  college  in  March  2018.  Two  weeks  into  his
training, he received a conditional offer of employment from a defense contractor, pending
his successful completion of the training, which ended on March 28, 2018. (GEs 1, 6.)
At  the  end  of  his  training,  Applicant  completed  his  March  29,  2018  SF  86.  He
reported some financial difficulties involving routine accounts: $1,500 in hospital bills in
collection;  unresolved  credit-card  delinquencies  of  $9,946  (SOR  ¶  4.a).  $2,731  (not
alleged), $3,526 (SOR ¶ 4.d), $4,690 (SOR ¶ 4.c), and $5,815 (SOR ¶ 4.b); his mortgage
that was past due for $4,016 (allegation withdrawn); and an $876 energy bill (not alleged).
Applicant explained that he fell behind on the accounts because he was injured at work
in August 2017, lost his job, and was unable to get new work. He was appealing denial of
a worker’s compensation claim. He added that he was working with his mortgage lender
to remodify his loan and arrange a payment plan to bring his loan current, and that he
was in a program with the energy company to spread out his debt so that he could bring
his account up to date. He explained that he was presently unable to make any payments
on the credit-card delinquencies. (GE 1.)
Applicant started working for the  defense contractor as a mechanical draftsman
learner  in  April  2018.  He  was  laid  off  only  weeks  later  because  of  a  lack  of  security
clearance. He understands he would return to work for the employer if his clearance is
adjudicated favorably. (GE 6.) Applicant went to work for a family member. (Tr. 50.)
As of May 2018, Applicant’s credit report showed that he owed credit-card charged
off balance of $9,945, $4,689, $6,284, and $3,536, and a medical collection debt of $25.
(GE 4.) When asked about his finances during his June 12, 2018 interview with the OPM
investigator,  Applicant  stated  that  he  had used  credit  cards  to  support himself  and his
family,  and  he  stopped  making  even  the  monthly  minimum  payments  on  some  of  the
accounts (a $1,500 hospital debt and those accounts in SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.e). He explained
that he tried to establish repayment plans with the creditors in November 2017 but none
would agree on a payment that he could afford. He volunteered that the creditor in SOR
¶ 4.a had filed for judgment in February 2018, and that he had yet to receive a court date.
Additionally, he and his spouse had consulted with a bankruptcy attorney in January 2018
to resolve their debt. They had not filed a bankruptcy petition because he did not want a
bankruptcy to negatively impact his chance of being rehired by the defense contractor.
He expressed an intention is to file after he is rehired. He added that he had rectified his
mortgage  issues  and  was  making  timely  payments  following  a  loan  modification.
Applicant  did  not  recognize  the  $25  medical  collection  debt  (SOR  ¶  4.g)  on  his  credit
record. He stated that he had taken an online credit-counseling course and attended a
mortgage crisis job training program to improve his financial situation. (GE 6.)
In October 2019, Applicant lost his job with his uncle because he had to stay at
home to care for his two young children. His spouse gave him two days notice before she
left for a rehabilitation program located out of state. Applicant was unemployed until late
January 2020, when he began working for a manufacturing machine company. (Tr. 50,
56.)  He  left  that  job  in  May  2020,  when  his  brother  died.  Applicant  was  emotionally
distraught and unable to work without compromising his and others’ safety. (Tr. 57.)  As
of May 2020, the credit bureaus were reporting no progress on Applicant resolving the
credit-card delinquencies in SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.d. Additionally, a $406 satellite television debt
was in collection (SOR ¶ 4.e), and his mortgage loan was in foreclosure. (GE 5.) Applicant
and his spouse were approved for a mortgage loan modification in October 2020, which
lowered  their  monthly  payment  from  $985  to  $886.  (GE  4.)  They  have  made  timely
mortgage  payments  since  then.  (AEs  A-C,  E.) However,  as  of  May 2021,  the  debts  in
SOR ¶¶ 4.a and 4.c-4.e were still on his credit record as unpaid. (AEs A-C.) The creditor
for the debt in SOR ¶ 4.a had offered to settle Applicant’s balance for $2,000. Applicant
has not been able to reach the creditor about the proposed settlement. (Tr. 26.) There is
no evidence of record showing that the debt in SOR ¶ 4.b has been resolved, although it
is no longer listed on his credit report.
Applicant has been unemployed for a year as of his May 2021 hearing.  (Tr. 26,
51.) He has been collecting unemployment compensation for the last year. It is currently
the minimum of $200 per week plus the $300 stimulus. (Tr. 57-58.) His spouse has been
employed as a dealer at a casino since 2006, with the exception of a brief furlough and
time  off  after the  birth  of  their  children.  (Tr. 57.)  She  works  four  days  a  week  and  her
earnings fluctuate depending on tips. She  averages about $25 to $35 per hour in tips,
and brings home about $850 per week. (Tr. 51, 59.) He and his spouse have “just under
$10,000 in [their] savings account.” (Tr. 26, 52.) Applicant has had some credit counseling
because he and his spouse are contemplating filing for bankruptcy.  He would like to gain
stable employment so he can negotiate with his creditors and bring his accounts current.
His spouse is looking into a loan from her 401(k) to address some of the debts. (Tr. 55.)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c,
1.e, and 2.a-2.l. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my
findings of fact.
Background Information
Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  senior  military  analyst  employed  by  various  federal
contractors since August 2008. He has worked for his current employer since April 2019.
(Tr. 16.) He received a security clearance in April 2008.
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  September  1986  to
September 1994 and from July 1996 to July 2008. He retired as a chief petty officer (pay
grade E-7).
Applicant married in February 1984, divorced in July 2008, married in August 2012,
and separated in July 2020. He and his wife intend to divorce. (Tr. 15.) He has a 20-year-
old  son  child  and  three  stepchildren,  ages  21,  18,  and  15.  He  earned  an  associate’s
degree in 2019. (Tr. 17.)
Alcohol Consumption (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.3)
In  March  1990,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  and
reckless driving. During an interview with a security investigator in October 2017, he told
the investigator that he had consumed 4-5 beers and that he failed a field sobriety test
after he was stopped by police. He was convicted of reckless driving, fined, and required
to complete an alcohol safety action program. (GX 2 at 13.)
In 2013, Applicant found himself in a stressful marriage, living with a teenager, a
preteen,  and  his  mother-in-law.  He  started  to  increase  his  alcohol  consumption  to  a
couple of 16-ounce cans of beer and a half pint of alcohol every other day, and then his
alcohol consumption “got out of hand.” (Tr. 22, 38-39.) He began drinking 4-6 beers daily,
with a slight increase on weekends. (GX 2 at 2.)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  sought  help  from  a  psychiatrist  at  a  Department  of
Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital. He told the psychiatrist that he was consuming ten or more
drinks four or more times per week, and that he used alcohol to help him sleep. In June
2014, the psychiatrist diagnosed him with an anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, and
nicotine dependence. The psychiatrist prescribed Naltrexone for his alcohol dependence.
Applicant testified that he disagreed with the VA psychiatrist’s diagnosis of alcohol
dependence, because he needed help coping with stress and not help with controlling his
alcohol consumption. (Tr. 22-23.) Starting in June 2014, he abstained from alcohol for
about  18  months  while  using  the  Naltrexone.  He  testified  that  he  stopped  drinking
because he wanted to and not because he had to. (Tr. 21.) In 2016, he resumed social
alcohol consumption, limiting his consumption to one or two beers, and then he stopped
drinking again from early 2018 until the end of 2019. (Tr. 29.)
In January 2020, Applicant had a violent confrontation with an intoxicated friend.
After the incident, he felt threatened by his former friend and  started to carry a firearm
with him at home. Applicant’s wife was concerned about his behavior and asked him to
leave their home for two-weeks.
Later in January 2020, Applicant met with his primary-care physician. During this
visit, he told the physician that his wife had asked him to leave the home, and that he felt
stressed  because  his  wife  did  not  respect  him.  (Tr.  30.)  He  told  the  physician  that  he
usually consumed one or two beers four times a week. However, he also disclosed that
he had consumed 28 drinks during the preceding week and had five incidents of binge
drinking during the preceding month. His physician advised him to abstain from alcohol.
(Tr. 34; GX 4 at 3-4, 8.)
At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he continued to drink beer “or something”
at social occasions, notwithstanding  his physician’s advice to  abstain from  alcohol. He
prefers  non-alcoholic  beer,  and  he  described  his  present  alcohol  consumption  as
“minimal.” He does not believe he has an alcohol problem. (Tr. 37-38.)
In  February  2020,  Applicant  consulted  with  a  VA  psychiatrist  regarding  issues
unrelated to alcohol use and was prescribed an anti-anxiety medication. The psychiatrist
advised him to avoid using alcohol or other drugs while taking the anti-anxiety medication.
(GX  4  at  4.)  Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  consume  alcohol  while  taking  the  anti-
anxiety medication. (Tr. 44.) He continued to visit the psychiatrist on a monthly basis until
June 2020. (Tr. 35.)
In March 2020, Applicant was evaluated by a psychologist at the CAF’s request.
He  was  diagnosed  with  a  generalized  anxiety  disorder  and  moderate  alcohol-use
disorder. The psychologist noted that Applicant’s current alcohol use (about eight beers
per week) was not above the guidelines for use of alcohol, but that he also had five recent
incidents of binge drinking and had exhibited poor judgment by carrying a firearm at home.
She  noted  that  Applicant  was  compliant  with  his  medication  programs  and  enjoyed
previous therapy. Her prognosis was “somewhat guarded given that he does not currently
acknowledge   that   his   use   of  alcohol   has   been   problematic.”  She   concluded   that
Applicant’s  continued   use   of   alcohol  “could   potentially   pose   a   significant  risk  to   his
judgment,  reliability  or trustworthiness concerning  classified  information  and  that  “the  risk
to   judgment  and   reliability   of   any   future  mental  health   and   substance   use   problems  is
moderate as long as he continues to use  alcohol.” (GX 4 at 8.)
Financial Considerations—Federal and State Income Taxes (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.i)
Applicant’s SCA reflects that he had two periods of unemployment from October
2008 to February 2009 and from February to December 2015. Both  occurred when his
employers were unable to obtain or retain government contracts. (GX 1 at 11-15.)
During  an  interview  with  a  security  investigator  in  October  2017,  Applicant
voluntarily disclosed that he had not filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax
years 2014, 2015, and 2016. He did not file his returns because he could not afford to
pay the amounts he believed owed for federal and state taxes. (GX 2 at 15.)
In  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  May  2020,  Applicant  submitted  federal
income  tax  transcripts  reflecting  that  he  had  not  timely  filed  his federal  returns  for  tax
years 2012 through 2019. (GX 2 at 27-34.) In his narrative response to the inquiries, he
stated that he had filed his federal returns for tax years 2012 through 2019; that he owed
nothing for tax years 2012 through 2014; and that he owed $87 for 2015; $5,032 for 2016;
$176  for 2017;  and  $2,520 for  2018.  He  did  not  indicate  whether he  thought  he  owed
taxes for 2019. He did not respond to the question asking whether he had filed his state
tax returns for the same years, but he disclosed that he owned $619 for 2017; $1,076 for
2018; and $1,080 for 2019. (GX 2 at 3-4.)
In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR,  he  stated that  he  had filed  all his federal and
state tax returns. In his post-hearing submission, he provided documentary evidence that
that his state tax debts for 2017 and 2018 were paid in full in February 2021, and his state
tax  debt  for  2019  was  paid  in  full  in  March  2021.  (AX  C.)  He  requested  a  federal  tax
transcript  for  2017,  but  the  IRS  advised  him  that  it  could  not  provide  it  at  that  time,
apparently  because  of  an  unresolved  identity-theft  issue.  (AX  D.)  The  federal  tax
transcripts for 2018 and 2019 reflect that the returns for those years were both received
on November 23, 2020, and that Applicant owed $2,520 for 2018 and $2,358 for 2019.
(AX E; AX F.)
In March 2021, Applicant hired a tax-resolution service to assist him in resolving
his federal tax debt. (Tr.45; AX G) As of the date the record closed, Applicant had not yet
negotiated a payment plan for the past-due federal income taxes.
Financial Considerations—Consumer Debts
SOR ¶ 2.j. A credit report from April 2020 reflects a military credit-card account
referred for collection of $6,003. The account was opened in November 1993 and became
delinquent in September 2018. (GX 5 at 2.) Applicant admitted the debt in his answer to
the  SOR  and  submitted  a  printout  of  an  email  reflecting  a  payment  plan  initiated  in
November 2020 and providing for monthly $400 payments. (AX B at 4-6.) He provided no
evidence that he had made any of the agreed payments.
SOR ¶ 2.k. The April 2020 credit report reflects a collection account for $261. (GX
5 at 3.) In his post-hearing submission, Appellant submitted documentary evidence that
the debt was resolved in July 2021. (AX B at 1.)
SOR ¶ 2.l. The April 2020 credit report reflects a deficiency after repossession of
an automobile charged off for $11,562. The last payment was in September 2014. The
credit report reflects that the debt is disputed. At the hearing, Applicant admitted that the
automobile was repossessed after he was  20 days late on a payment. (Tr. 52-53.) He
disputed the debt because the lender would not give him an opportunity to make the late
payment and recover the automobile. (Tr. 57.) The debt is not resolved.

"Applicant, age 32, has never married nor had children. He received a high school
diploma in 2007 and a bachelor’s degree in 2015.  He has been employed as a quality
lead by a defense contractor since January 2018. Another defense contractor offered him
a position as an avionics technician in August 2019, conditioned on him being granted a
security clearance. Applicant previously held a security clearance while serving on active
duty with the U.S. Marine Corps from 2012 through 2016. (Item 3; Item 4 at 3)
Under Guideline G, the SOR alleged facts related to five criminal charges involving
Applicant’s excessive alcohol consumption between 2009 and 2017 including: two driving
under the influence (DUI)  charges  (SOR  ¶¶ 1.a and 1.e),  two  driving while  intoxicated
(DWI) charges (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d), and one public intoxication charge (SOR ¶ 1.g). It
also alleged facts concerning Applicant’s 2014 alcohol abuse treatment (SOR ¶ 1.c), his
2016  service  discharge  for alcohol rehabilitation failure  (SOR  ¶ 1.f),  and  his continued
consumption of alcohol through at least November 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.h). In his SOR answer,
Applicant admitted each of the SOR allegations, without explanation. (Items 1, 2)
In March 2009, when he was a college student, Applicant parked his vehicle behind
a closed business with two friends as passengers. After deeming the vehicle suspicious
given the location in which it was parked at a late hour, a police officer pointed a spot light
on  the  vehicle  to  find  heavy  smoke  coming  out  of  the  driver’s  side  window.  As  he
approached the vehicle (in which its engine was still running), the officer detected a heavy
smell of burnt marijuana emitting from the vehicle. During a pat down, the officer smelled
a heavy odor of alcohol and burnt marijuana on Applicant’s person. During a search of
the vehicle, the officer found two red plastic cups under the driver’s seat that contained
beer. Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol or drugs (OVI). While being processed at  the police station, Applicant gave an
invalid  breath  sample  (claiming  that  his  asthma  prevented  him  from  providing  a  valid
sample) and refused to give a urine sample (on the basis that the officer already knew
“what is in there”). In July 2009, Applicant pled guilty to a lesser charge of having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence for which he was fined $200. His father paid
the fine. (Item 4 at 12-13; Item 5; Item 9; AX I, II)
There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  that  Applicant  was  charged  with  any  drug-
related offense in connection with the 2009 incident. When questioned about the incident
during his March 2012 security clearance interview (SCI), Applicant maintained that he
was arrested because the officer observed beer in his vehicle, he had been consuming
beer, and he was in the driver’s seat of the parked vehicle. He estimated that he drank
about two to three beers while parked. He did not mention marijuana with regard to the
incident, but admitted that his only marijuana use occurred on the day of his high school
senior prom in April 2007. On that day, he tried marijuana twice; both times by smoking
a  marijuana  cigarette  (about  two  puffs  each  time).  He  did  not  use  marijuana  again
because  it  made  him  sick  to  his  stomach  and,  at  that  time,  he  was  concerned  that
marijuana use would threatened his career in the fire safety program in college. During
his 2012 SCI, Applicant declared his intent not to use marijuana in the future because he
did not want it to affect his career in the Marine Corps. (Item 4 at 12-13)
In May 2014, while on active duty, Applicant consumed purportedly six to seven
alcohol  beverages  with  friends,  while  at  an  unknown  person’s  home.  During  his  drive
home,  a  police  officer  pulled  Applicant  over  for  erratic  driving.  After  failing  both  field
sobriety  and  breathalyzer  tests,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DWI.  He  was  also
charged with speeding, which was later dismissed. He spent one night in jail. In December
2014,  he  pled  guilty  to  DWI  for  which  he  was  fined  and  sentenced  to  60  hours  of
community  service  and  two  years  of  unsupervised  probation.  Additionally,  his  driver’s
license  was  revoked  for  30  days.  He  paid  $515  for  the  fine  and  court  costs,  and
successfully completed his community service. The record did not indicate the status of
his probation. (Item 3 at 36-37; Item 4 at 5-6, 9; Item 6)
After Applicant informed his chain of command of the May 2014 DWI arrest, which
occurred off-base, he received a non-judicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15 of the
Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ).  The  NJP  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  rank,
forfeiture of pay, and 45 days of restriction. Applicant was ordered to undertake alcohol
abuse  treatment.  Although  he  successfully  completed  that  treatment  in  June  2014,  he
failed to follow treatment advice to abstain from consuming alcohol and attend Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) meetings. (Item 2; Item 3 at 28, 42; Item 4 at 5, 7)
In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted that he was treated for alcohol abuse in
2014. He also admitted that he failed to follow treatment advice by continuing to consume
alcohol  and  declining  to  attend  AA  meetings.  The  record  does  not  otherwise  address
whether he has ever been diagnosed with alcohol abuse or another alcohol use disorder.
In his September 2020 response to interrogatories, Applicant listed “Fit for Duty” as the
diagnosis he received in 2014. (Item 2; Item 4 at 21)
In January 2015,  while on active duty, Applicant  consumed purportedly one 40-
ounce light beer, while  watching  a  football  game  at a  friend’s house.  He did not think he
was too impaired to drive home. During his drive home, a police officer pulled Applicant
over for speeding. He was arrested and charged with DWI, driving while license revoked
for  impaired driving  (DWLR),  and  speeding.  The  facts  and  circumstances  of  his arrest
were not indicated in the record. In February 2015, he pled guilty to DWLR and speeding
pursuant to a plea agreement in which the DWI charge was dismissed. He was sentenced
to 45 hours of community service and twelve months of unsupervised probation, both of
which he successfully completed. He paid $395 for a fine and court costs. (Item 4 at 8;
Item 6; AX III)
In May 2015, while on active duty, Applicant consumed alcoholic beverages, in an
amount that he could not recall, while attending a wedding. He borrowed a friend’s vehicle
so  that  he  could  leave  the  wedding  to  get  food  from  McDonalds.  While  Applicant  was
driving, at approximately 2:11 a.m., a police officer observed the vehicle crossing the fog
line several times with the passenger side tires.  The officer pulled Applicant over after
observing the vehicle cross the fog line completely and drive partially in the grass. During
the  traffic  stop,  the  officer  could  smell  an  odor  of  alcoholic  beverage  coming  from  the
driver’s side window. Applicant told the officer that he had not been drinking. The officer
observed that Applicant’s speech was “very slurred” and that he fumbled with his wallet
when asked to produce a driver’s license. When exiting the vehicle, Applicant staggered.
The officer could smell a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Applicant’s
breath,  and  observed  him  to  have  “very  bloodshot”  and  “glassy”  eyes.  After  Applicant
failed three field sobriety tests, he was arrested and charged with OVI. The officer noted
that Applicant’s movements were “over exaggerated.” While being processed at the police
station,  Applicant  underwent  two  breathalyzer  tests  within  four  minutes.  The  first
registered a .197 blood alcohol level (BAC); the second a .207 BAC. He was also charged
with OVI with a breath alcohol concentration of .17 gram or more (OVI .17 Breath). At his
initial  court  appearance  in  May  2015,  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  until  August
2015.  In September 2015, Applicant  pled  guilty to  OVI  for which  he  was  sentenced  to
three days in jail and fined $500. The OVI .17 Breath charge was dismissed. (Item 3 at
37-38; Item 4 at 6, 9; Item 7; Item 9)
The  record  did  not  indicate  whether  Applicant  received  another  NJP  following
either of the 2015 alcohol-related incidents. However, in March 2016, Applicant received
a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions  from  the  Marine  Corps  for  alcohol
rehabilitation failure. He maintained that his alcohol use did not negatively impact his duty
performance. However, he acknowledged that it negatively impacted his military career
since he was discharged earlier than his End of Active Service (EAS) date. (Item 3 at 41;
Item 4 at 5)
In  November  2017,  Applicant  consumed  purportedly  four  alcoholic  beverages,
while at a bar with a friend. Applicant lost his keys and phone while at the bar and had no
way home after his friend left him. After exiting the bar,  Applicant approached a police
officer.  The  officer  smelled  a  strong  odor  of  an  alcoholic  beverage  emanating  from
Applicant’s  breath  and  body,  and  observed  him  to  have  bloodshot  and  watery  eyes,
extremely slurred speech, and an unsteady balance. Because Applicant was in a public
place  with  no  party  to  control  him,  the  officer  attempted  to  call  a  taxi  for  him  but  was
unable to reach one. Applicant told the officer that he did not know the phone number of
anyone that could come get him. Based on his level of intoxication, the officer deemed
Applicant to be a danger to himself and others. Applicant was arrested and charged with
public intoxication. He spent one night in jail. In March 2018, the charge was dismissed
for  reasons  unknown  to  Applicant.  He  believed  that  he  did  not  do  anything  wrong.
However, he acknowledged that he had been belligerent towards the officer during their
interaction, but alleged that it was the result of feeling that the officer was harassing him
for crossing the street to use the phone. (Item 3 at 39; Item 4 at 6, 10; Item 8)
Applicant’s  complete  history  of  alcohol  consumption  was  not  developed  in  the
written record. He could not recall when he began to consume alcohol, but described his
alcohol use  during  several  time  periods.  Prior  to  his March  2009 arrest,  he  consumed
alcohol about two to three times per week, on weekends in social settings with friends.
He would drink about five to six beers each time, which was the amount it took for him to
become intoxicated. After his March 2009 arrest, he decreased his consumption to about
one to two times per month; about two to four beers each time. As of September 2019,
he  consumed  alcohol  every  two  or  three  weeks.  From  November  2019  through
September 2020, he abstained from consuming any alcohol. Without indicating a specific
timeframe, he reported that his consumption prior to November 2019 was one drink (beer
or liquor) every three weeks. (Item 4 at 7, 12-13, 19, 20, 24)
At no point in the record did Applicant acknowledge having a problem with alcohol.
During his 2012 SCI, he stated that he did not believe that he had a problem with alcohol.
He professed an intent to continue responsible use of alcohol and declared that he would
not drive a vehicle after consuming alcohol. During his September 2019 SCI, Applicant
acknowledged that his alcohol use contributed to his legal, but not any other, problems.
He  attributed  his  alcohol-related  criminal  offenses  to  having  fun,  being  immature,  and
trying to show off for his friends. He vowed to follow the law and stay out of trouble in the
future by only having one drink and using ride-share services for transportation when he
drank outside of the home. During his October 2019 SCI, he attributed his May 2014 DWI
and May 2015  OVI to being young and making dumb decisions.  During his November
2019  SCI,  he  reiterated  that  immaturity  and  wanting  to  have  fun  underlay  his  January
2015 DWI. He affirmed that he would follow the law and prevent future alcohol-related
driving offenses by never driving after consuming any alcohol. (Item 4 at 7, 8, 10, 13)
Applicant  asserted  that  he  last  consumed  alcohol  to  intoxication  in  November
2019, and last blacked out in October 2017. From November 2019 through September
2020, he abstained from consuming any alcohol because “it was time for a change,” and
he did not want to “screw the opportunity up [sic]” to work in the avionics position offered
to him, which he anticipated would provide him with job security and financial stability. In
his  September  2020  response  to  interrogatories,  Applicant  indicated  that  he  was
committed to sobriety, asserting: “I knew if I continued to consume alcohol I was likely to
make a bad decision, and possibly lose my job. I took a hard look in the mirror and realized
I have a great career in Avionics, and don’t need alcohol to sustain life.” He also extolled
the benefits of sobriety, declaring: “Mentally and physically [it’s] the best I’ve felt in years.”
There was no indication in the record that Applicant has either sought or received sobriety
support  from  any  individual,  group,  or  resource  since  his  2014  command-ordered
treatment. (Item 4 at 19, 20, 23, 24)

Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption  & Guideline  J: Criminal Conduct
1.a.~1.k., and 2.a. Applicant admits that in  August of  1994, he was arrested for
and  found  guilty,  in  part,  of  Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol  (DUI).  He  was
sentenced to four days in jail and fined $1,500. [Listed chronologically below.]
Applicant admits that about four years later, in April of 1998, he was arrested for
and  found  guilty,  in  part,  of  DUI,  and  of  Driving  on  a  Suspended  License.  He  was
sentenced to four days in jail and fined $1,760.
Applicant admits that about two years later, in August of 2000, he was arrested
for Disorderly Conduct, Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs. Applicant avers that these

"The six allegations of the SOR total $55,142 in unpaid taxes and delinquent debt.
SOR 1.a alleges that Applicant owes $30,000 in federal taxes for tax year 2016. SOR 1.b
alleges that Applicant did not file a federal tax return for 2013. He admitted SOR 1.a and
claimed he was paying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $250 a month.  He admitted
SOR 1.b. He pointed to his job lay off as the reason he did not file his federal tax return
for 2013.
Applicant admitted the remaining allegations SOR 1.c through 1.f. He claimed he
was making arrangements to pay the delinquent account in SOR 1.c. He claimed that his
December 2020 payment satisfied the balance owed to the SOR 1.d collection agency.
He explained that the delinquent $21,103 account in SOR 1.e is for a boat repossession.
He did not know about the SOR 1.f account.
Applicant is 61 years old.  He served on active duty in the United States Army
(USA) from 1978 to September 1982. (Item 3 at 14-15) He has been married since 1986
to his second wife, following his divorce from his first wife in 1981. He is the father of six
adult children. (Item 3 at 18-27)
According  to  his  June  2017  e-QIP,  Applicant  has  been  working  as  a  field
technician since April 2014. From January to April 2014, he was machine operator. He
was  unemployed  from  June  to  December  2013,  due  to  a  lay  off  after  28  years  of
employment as an information technician (IT) for an insurance company. He is seeking
his first security clearance. (Item 3 at 35)
Regarding SOR 1.a, Applicant explained in his June 2017 e-QIP that he did not
pay $30,000 in federal taxes for tax year 2016. He submitted one $250 check addressed
to the U.S. Treasury, but provided no documentation of the current status of the SOR 1.a
federal tax balance.  His reasons for not paying the taxes are  unclear. His initial vague
reference  to  his  retirement  paying  the  tax  amount  makes  no  sense.  His  subsequent
statement that the IRS wanted him to file his 2013 federal tax return  (SOR 1.b) before
they provide him a payment plan for federal tax year 2016, is more understandable. His
claim that his computer stopped working does not justify his failure to file his 2013 federal
tax return through some other means. (Item 3 at 36-37)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  was  making  arrangements  to  pay  the  delinquent
account in SOR 1.c. No additional information was provided regarding the status of the
arrangements.
In  support  of  his  claim  that  the  collection  agency  in  SOR  1.d  was  paid  in  full,
Applicant provided a $164 debit payment that was posted on December 28, 2020. There
is  no  documentation,  i.e.,  cancelled  checks,  bank  ledgers  or  statements  describing  a
record of consistent payments, I am unable to accept Applicant’s claim that the account
was paid in full. See, Item 5 at 2.
In  his  answer  to  SOR  1.e,  Applicant  indicated  that  the  delinquent  account  he
owed  the  insurance  company  was  for  a  boat  that  was  repossessed.  He  furnished  no
additional documentation to describe the current status of the account.
Item  4 at page 3  verifies  the  account  alleged  in  SOR  1.f. The  joint-installment
finance account was opened in 1986. The account payments were $240 a month, and the
account was charged off in May 2015.
Applicant claimed that he was receiving financial counseling and his mortgage
lender helped him achieve more reasonable mortgage payments. He explained that his
mortgage was restored to a current status after he sold off some personal property. (Item
3 at 37-39) Due to the fact that Applicant provided no documented evidence of financial
counseling  or  a  budget,  it  is  impossible  to  determine  what  his  financial  management
practices are and how he intends to resolve the commercial debts, the unpaid taxes, the
and missing 2013 federal tax return.

"Applicant  admitted  some  of  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations  (SOR  1.a,
1.c, 1.d, 2.a, and 3.a), and he denied others (SOR 1.b and 3.a-3.c). His admissions are
incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  has  worked  for
this employer since November 2017. He is a high school graduate. He married in 1996
and  divorced  in  2012.  He  has  three  children  from  this marriage,  ages  24,  20,  and  14.

The SOR alleged, under Guidelines J and G, that Applicant was involved in four
alcohol-related  arrests  between  2002  and  2019  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d,  2.a).  The  SOR  also
alleged, under Guideline E, that he falsified his August 2019  Electronic Questionnaires
for  Investigation  Processing  (e-QIP)  when  he  failed  to  list  his  previous  arrests  as
required  by  the  questions  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a-3.b).  The  criminal  conduct  was  also
multiplicitously  pleaded  in  SOR  ¶  3.c.  The  allegations  are  supported  by  a  September
2019 federal arrest report, statements to a defense investigator during his background
investigation in October 2019, admissions he made in his answers to interrogatories in
May 2020, and his December 2020 SOR answer. (GE 2-4; SOR Answer)
Applicant described his alcohol history as beginning when he was either 18 or 19
years  old.  He  increased  his  amount  of  consumption  in  approximately  1996  after  he
married.  When  he  was  approximately  26  years  old  he  abstained  from  alcohol  use  for
religious reasons. This lasted until he was 30 years old. (Tr. at 27-29)
The four alcohol incidents are described below:
2002   Driving  Under  the   Influence   (DUI)  arrest.   Applicant  could  not  recall  the
details  of  this  arrest.  He  admitted  the  conduct  in  his  SOR  answer.  (Tr.  at  33;  GE  2-3;
SOR answer)
2011   Disorderly   Conduct;   Intoxication  by   Alcohol  or  Drugs;  DUI   arrest.
Applicant could not recall the details of this arrest.  He believed he received a ticket for
disorderly  conduct.  He  denied  the  conduct  in  his  SOR  answer.  A  federal  arrest  report
describes  the  arrest  and  it  appears  that  only  the  disorderly  conduct  and  intoxication
offenses went to court. (Tr. 40-41; GE 2, 4; SOR answer)
2014   DUI,   Driving  on  Suspended  License,  Failure   to   Appear,  and  other
related charges. Applicant described being stopped by law enforcement while having a
wine cooler in his car. A federal arrest report describes the arrest. (Tr. 40-41; GE 2, 4;
SOR answer)
2019   DUI.   Applicant  described  having  several  glasses  of  wine  and  bourbon
whiskey  at  a  friend’s house  in  June  2019. After  he  left  the  house,  he  was  stopped  by
law  enforcement  for  having  tinted  windows.  During  his  October  2019  interview  with  a
defense  investigator,  he  recalled  taking  a  breathalyzer  test,  which  showed  a  result  of
.08 percent blood alcohol. During his hearing testimony, he recalled that he declined the
breathalyzer  test.  He  admitted  committing  this  offense  in  his  SOR  answer.  He  was
convicted  and,  among  other  things,  he  was  sentenced  to  four  years’  probation.  He
remains on probation. (Tr. 37-39; GE 2-4; SOR answer)
Applicant  offered  a  progress  report  from  the  court  showing  he  had  completed
approximately 63 hours of  education and counseling sessions as of  October 2020. He
also  provided  a  compliance  form  showing  he  had  attended  a  victim-impact  panel  in
August  2020,  as  required  by  his  sentence.  He  has  not  participated  in  any  alcohol
treatment programs and he also does not participate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He
claims  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  his  June  2019  arrest.  He  claims  he  uses
meditation to control any urge to consume alcohol. (Tr. at 56-47; SOR answer)
Applicant listed his 2019 DUI arrest when he completed his SCA in August 2019.
He did not list the earlier alcohol-related offenses (2002, 2011, 2014). He testified that
he  was  under  pressure  to  complete  his  e-QIP  and  did  not  recall  the  earlier  incidents,
which is why he failed to list them. (Tr. at 23, 26, 33, 44-45; SOR answer)

the  point of intoxication, from  about  June  of  2004  until about September  of 2021,  “a few
weeks ago,” as admitted  at her hearing, which was  after the  issuance  of  the  SOR. She
is also an  admitted  alcoholic. (TR at  page  26  line  16  to  page  33  line  23, at  page  42  line
3 to  page  47 line 24, and at page 56 lines 1~11.)

1.c. In about May of 2017,  Applicant  admits  that  she   received   a   written   warning
from  Employer B  for being  intoxicated  while  on  the  job.  (TR at page  34  line  22  to  page

alcohol-related incident. (TR at page 37 line  21 to  page  38 line 17.)
1.g. In  about  March of 2018,  Applicant admits that  she  was  terminated  from  her
place  of  employment,  with  Employer C, for being  under the  influence  of alcohol on  the
job. (TR at page 34 line 22 to  page 37 line 20.)

Applicant was discharged  from  the  Air  Force as a  senior airman  (E-4) with  an  honorable
discharge. (Tr. 15; AE  E)  He contended  that  his DD  Form  214  incorrectly  indicated  his
rank when  discharged  was senior airman; however, he  was actually a  staff  sergeant (E-
5). (GE  2 at 11) He received  multiple certifications in information technology, including  in
information   technology   security.  (Tr.  23-24;  AE   J)  He  received   a   security   clearance   in
December 2006. (GE 1  at 33) He has worked  with  sensitive  or classified  information  for
16 years, and  he  has never been  accused  of  a security violation. (Tr. 24)
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant  first  consumed  alcohol  in  high  school.  (Tr.  42-43)  He  began  drinking
alcohol to intoxication before 2005. (Tr. 43) He rarely drank to intoxication when he was
married from 2004 to 2009. (Tr. 44)
Around  May  2008,  Applicant  was  drinking  beer  while  fishing.  (Tr.  17)  When  he
returned to his Air Force base, security at the gate stopped Applicant and asked him if he
had been drinking. (Tr. 17) He said he was drinking, and he was apprehended for driving
while impaired. (Tr. 17; SOR ¶ 1.d; GE 2 at 13) He believed his blood alcohol  content
(BAC) was below the legal limit, and he was unsure how the authorities concluded he
was intoxicated. (Tr. 54; GE 2 at 11) He received a field grade Article 15 or NJP for drunk
driving and driving with an expired driver’s license. (Tr. 17, 25, 52-55; GE 2 at 6-7) His
punishment included a suspended reduction in rank to airman first class, and 25 days of
extra duty. (Tr. 52; GE 2 at 7) He did not appeal his NJP. (Tr. 63) He attended alcohol-
related training. (Tr. 17; GE 2 at 7) He lost his on-base driving privileges for six months.

nonjudicial punishment for his 2008 offense. (Tr. 55-56)
Around   September  2011,  Applicant  was  drinking,  and   he   believed   he   was  not
intoxicated.  (Tr. 18) The  police  stopped  his vehicle  for driving  70  miles per hour  (MPH)  in
a  45  MPH zone, and  they  arrested  him  for DUI. (Tr. 18, 27-28; SOR ¶  1.c;  AE  C at 18-
19) His BAC was .08. (Tr. 56-58; AE  C  at 3, 20) He  was convicted  of DUI,  and  a  civilian
court  imposed   two   years   of   probation,   a   $600   fine,   and   court  costs.   (AE   C  at  5)   He
successfully  completed  an  alcohol and  substance  abuse  class. (Tr.  18, 28; GE  1  at 30;
AE  C at 5, 9, 13)  His driver’s license  was suspended  “as a  matter of  law”  for an  unspecified
period.  (AE  C  at  5) After the  2011  DUI arrest,  he  modified  his alcohol consumption  by
consuming  less  alcohol. (Tr.  28-29) He  did  not disclose  the  DUI arrest and  conviction  to
his chain  of command  even  though  he  realized  at that time  that he  had  an  obligation  to
disclose it. (Tr. 26-27)
Applicant  disclosed  his  2011  DUI arrest on  his  August 16, 2016  SCA.  (GE 1  at 28-
29)  His  SCA  asked   whether  he   had   been   ordered,  advised,  or  asked   to   seek  alcohol
counseling  or treatment in  the  previous seven  years,  and  he  answered, no.  (Tr. 48-49;
GE  1  at 32) Applicant  said he  answered,  no because  he  believed  the alcohol counseling
or treatment question  was seeking information about one-on-one counseling. (Tr. 49)
Around January and April 2017, Applicant was drinking, and the police stopped his
vehicle on two occasions and arrested him for DUI. (Tr. 18-20; SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d) As
for the April 2017 arrest, he was cited for DUI and driving with a suspended license. (AE
A at 5) The police  alleged  Applicant failed  to yield  to  the  officer’s commands, and  they
pointed  their firearms at  him.  (Tr. 37; GE 2 at  5) Applicant did  not remember resisting
arrest or having firearms pointed at him. (Tr. 37-38) His first BAC from the April 2017 DUI
was .197, and his second BAC was .16. (GE 3 at 3, 5, 14; AE A at 2) Both DUIs were
adjudicated in the same proceeding, and resulted in two DUI convictions. (Tr. 59) The
driving with suspended license was nol prossed. (AE A at 10, 12) He received a combined
sentence,  which  included  12  months  of  probation,  a  $700  fine,  court  costs,  and  a
suspended jail sentence of 60 days. (AE A at 6; AE B at 4) He attended an alcohol and
substance abuse class for 12 hours. (Tr. 19-20, 35) He did not report the two alcohol-
related arrests in 2017 to his employer even though he knew he had a duty to report them.
(Tr. 46-47)
After Applicant completed about eight hours of therapy, his plan was not to drink
more than two drinks at a setting, and not to drink on more than two occasions per month.
(Tr. 21, 40, 51) He has never been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. (Tr. 51) He has
different friends from 2017, and his new friends are not focused on alcohol consumption.
(Tr.  41)  He  enjoys  exercise  and  healthy  outdoor  activities  unrelated  to  alcohol
consumption. (Tr. 41)
Applicant denied having alcohol-related blackouts or having withdrawal symptoms.
(Tr. 45) Over the past 15 years, he abstained from alcohol consumption for nine or ten
month periods and then resumed alcohol consumption. (Tr. 46) He completed alcohol-
related counseling on April 11, 2018. (AE H)
Applicant  signed  a  statement  of  intent  not  to  drive  while  under  the  influence  of
alcohol. (Tr. 22; AE D) He said, “I understand that any future involvement with drinking
and driving is grounds for revocation of my national security eligibility.” (Id.) He promised
to responsibly consume alcohol in the future. (Id.)
On March 9, 2020, a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), licensed substance
abuse professional (SAP), and certified substance abuse counselor (CSAC), provided an
assessment of Applicant’s alcohol consumption. (AE G) During the  interview, Applicant
said his BAC was “well below the legal limit” when Air Force security personnel arrested
him for DUI in 2008. (Id. at 2) He denied that he was drunk driving for the arrests in 2008
and  2011.  (Id.  at  3)  For  his  January  2017  DUI  arrest,  he  said  the  police  stopped  him
because his brake lights malfunctioned, and the police office did not see him stop for a
stop sign. (Id.) For his April 2017 DUI arrest, the LCSW  said “[u]nlike former situations,
however, in this instance his BAC was above the legal limit.” (Id.) However, she did not
indicate his BAC, which were .197 and .16. She indicated Applicant “has never engaged
in  binge  drinking  or habitual drinking  to  the  point  of  impaired  judgment.” (Id.  at  4) She
noted  that  after  the  two  DUI  arrests  in  2017,  he  successfully  completed  9  months  of
random drug and alcohol urine testing, 12 hours of alcohol and drug abuse classes, and
8 hours of one-on-one counseling with a psychologist. (Id. at 4) The LCSW diagnosed no
alcohol  use  disorder.  (Id.  at  6)  She  recommended  that  he  “engage  in  self  imposed
sobriety,” and that he receive access to classified information. (Id.)

that was stopped at a light. The driver of the second vehicle was taken to the hospital
with  minor  injuries.  Applicant  stated  that  he  was  drinking  and  had  taken  his  sleep
medication,  and  then  a  friend  called  and  asked  to  meet  at  a  bar.  The  investigation
revealed that shortly before the accident,  Applicant was asked to leave a bar because
he  was  too  intoxicated.  He  was  charged  with  DUI  of  an  alcoholic  beverage,  causing
bodily injury to another; DUI with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08% or more,
causing bodily injury to another; and DUI of a drug, causing bodily injury to another. (Tr.
at 34-35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 5, 6)
In  his  September  2018  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86),
Applicant wrote:
I will go to court in December 2018. I will plead no contest and accept my
punishment.  I  am  responsible  for  this  embarrassing  event.  The  day  after
my  arrest,  I  contacted  Alcoholics  Anonymous,  obtained  a  sponsor  and
have been meeting with him every day since then. I also regularly attend
AA  meetings  and  I  am  working  on  the  12  steps  of  recovery.  I  am
convinced  that  my  drinking  is  a  problem.  I  am  determined  to  never  drink
again.  I  know  that  the  results  of  my  drinking  could  have  meant  injury  or
death  to  an  innocent  motorist  and  I  am  putting  into  action  the  steps  to
avoid this ever happening again. (GE 1)
In  July  2019,  Applicant  pleaded  nolo  contendere  to  all  charges.  He  was
sentenced  to  90  days  in  jail  (suspended);  probation  for  three  years;  20  days  of
community  labor;  completion  of  a  three-month  alcohol  and  drug  education  counseling
program; and $936 in fines, court costs, and restitution. Terms of his probation included
not  driving  with  any  measurable  amount  of  alcohol  or  intoxicating  drug  in  his  system;
attendance  at  12  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings;  completion  of  a  victim  impact
panel  (VIP);  and  installation  of  an  ignition  interlock  device  on  his  car.  Applicant
completed the alcohol education program and all of the requirements of his probation by
December  2019.  He  remains  on  probation  until  July  2022.  (Tr.  at  23,  35-36,  48-49;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 7)
Applicant  was  cited   in  September  2019   in   State   A   with   use   of  a  handheld
portable device while driving;  and driving  with license suspended, revoked, or cancelled.
He pleaded  guilty  to  use  of  a handheld  portable device while  driving;  and  the  charge  of
driving  with  license  suspended,  revoked,  or  cancelled, was dismissed. He  paid  a  fine  of
$174.   Applicant  stated   that  the   status   of  his driver’s  license   was  unclear, but  he   knew
that he  should  not be  driving. He testified  that he  “really  only  [drove] to  work and  back,
grocery store and  back.” Applicant now  has a  valid  driver’s license   in State  A, but that
was issued in January 2021.1  (Tr. at 47-48; GE  8)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  is  an  alcoholic.  He  attended  intensive  16-week
outpatient  treatment  programs  in  about  2010,  2014,  and  2016.  He  had  periods  of
sobriety lasting up to six months, but then he resumed drinking. He stated that he had a
breakthrough  while  attending  an  AA  meeting  in  late  October  2019.  He  finally
surrendered  to  alcohol,  and  admitted  that  he  lost  the  fight.  He  has  been  sober  since
November 3, 2019. He currently attends three AA meetings per week; he is a sponsor;
and  he  volunteers  at  a  facility  for  troubled  teens.  He  sees  a  psychiatrist  who  is  an
addiction specialist. He has taken Antabuse for almost two years. (Tr. at 20-23, 30-32,
37-44, 49-50; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE B, D)
Applicant’s  addiction  psychiatrist  wrote  that Applicant  is meeting with  him  every
two to three weeks. He wrote that Applicant has consistently demonstrated that he has
a solid foundation in recovery. He concluded:
As  is  quite  frequently  the  case,  and  certainly  with  [Applicant],  individuals
that  find  Recovery,  emerge  an  even  better  version  of  themselves.
Individuals  that  have  known  suffering,  known  struggle,  known  loss,  but
have found a way out of the depths, have a unique understanding of life,
that  fills  them  with  compassion,  perspective,  and  humility.  In  my
professional opinion, having cared for this patient population for nearly 15
years,  [Applicant]  exhibits  all  of  the  characteristics  and  clinical  signs,  of
someone “living a Life of Recovery.” (AE B)
Applicant self-reported his alcohol-related offenses. He requested that I consider
the  possibility  of  a  “probationary  clearance,”  which  is  a  conditional  clearance  and  is
permitted under the adjudicative guidelines. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 9; AE
E)
1 These charges were not alleged in the SOR and cannot be used for disqualification purposes. They may
be  considered  when  assessing  Applicant’s  rehabilitation,  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and
during the whole-person analysis.
Applicant  submitted  letters,  including  from  his  ex-wife,  attesting  to  his  excellent
job  performance  and  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  reliability,  honesty,
responsibility,  trustworthiness,  dependability,  and  integrity.  The  authors  note  his
commitment to  sobriety,  his  participation  in AA,  and  the positive  changes  in him  since
he has been sober. (AE A, C)
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 51 years old. He attended college, but did not earn a diploma. He was
married twice, both ending in divorce. He is in a long-term relationship and lives with his
fiancée. They have been together for about 10 years. He has no children. Applicant has
worked for his present employer since June 2018. (Transcript (Tr.) 13-15)
Applicant testified that he began drinking alcohol to excess when he was about 30
years old.  He would  consume alcohol every day.  He continued this  pattern until about
2010, when he reduced his drinking to three to four beers a day or every other day. He
continued this pattern until about 2016. (Tr. 21-23)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  been  on  medication  since  about  2005  for
depression, which he said runs in his family. From 2012 to 2015, he was seen at a mental
health clinic for his depression. He was not being seen for his alcohol issues. He began
seeing  a  psychiatrist-psychologist  (Dr.  G)  in  2015.  This  was  the  first  time  his  alcohol
issues were addressed along with his depression. He had been advised by Dr. G to not
consume alcohol while on prescribed medication. He did not follow his Dr. G’s advice and
continued to consume alcohol. (Tr. 27-30, 39-40)
In January 2016, reacting to the death of David Bowie, Applicant brought alcohol
(vodka) to work with him to drink. He said he did not normally bring alcohol to work. Later
in the day, he purchased beer and brought it back to the office. He drank the vodka and
about 12 beers. He became intoxicated and drove his car, which he crashed into a pole
after falling asleep. He was uninjured and his fiancée drove him home. The police were
not notified. (Tr. 23-27)
Applicant stated that prior to 2016, he consumed alcohol at work on a couple of
occasions. He would bring the alcohol to work with him. He remembered drinking at work
one day in the summer of 2015 as a coping mechanism because his mother was in the
hospital. He had about three beers. A month later he did the same thing for the same
reason. He estimated from 2015 to 2016, he consumed alcohol at work about four times.
(Tr. 36-38)
In  2016,  Applicant  was  advised  by  Dr.  G  to  stop  consuming  alcohol.  Applicant
testified that Dr. G referred to him as a “drunk.” He said that this was the first time he was
ever told to stop drinking. He said he attempted to abstain, could not, but reduced his
consumption. Dr. G diagnosed Applicant with unspecified Alcohol Use Disorder. Applicant
consumed alcohol before a couple of his appointments with Dr. G. On one occasion, he
was told to wait for transportation to be arranged because it was unsafe for Applicant to
drive.  He  left  the  office  without  waiting.  Applicant  was  also  seeing  a  therapist  once  a
month in conjunction with Dr. G. Applicant testified that in 2017 he stopped seeing Dr. G
because he did not have a good rapport with him and was unhappy with being referred
to  as  a  “drunk”  instead  of  an  alcoholic.  He  also  stopped  seeing  the  therapist.  Dr.  G’s
medical notes state that Applicant was terminated as a patient in November 2017, due to
a pattern of noncompliance with treatment recommendations, multiple relapses of alcohol
abuse,  not  seeking  a  12-step  program,  not  seeking  psychotherapy,  and  leaving  the
waiting room when mildly intoxicated after agreeing that his fiancée would come pick him
up because he should not be driving. (Tr. 27-30, 39-41; GE 3)
Applicant testified that the accident was a wake-up call to him regarding his alcohol
abuse.  He  attempted  to  stop  drinking,  but  could  abstain  for  only  short  periods.  He
continued  to  consume  alcohol  daily  from  2016  until  he  started  his  current  job  in  June
2018.  He  said  he  cut  back  on  his  daily  drinking  because  it  was  inconsistent  with  his
employment.  He  testified  he  was  only  drinking  on  the  weekends  during  this  time.
Applicant  testified  that  in  late  2019,  he  abstained  from  alcohol  consumption  for  nine
months. He felt his prescribed medication was working, and he was enjoying life. He said
he did not plan to abstain from alcohol consumption forever and thought he would resume
consumption  at  some  point.  In  2021,  he  resumed  consuming  alcohol.  He  testified  he
drinks on the weekends during football season and perhaps on a few special occasions
such  as birthdays.  He  consumes  about a  six-pack  of  beer on  Saturdays  and Sundays
with his fiancée. (Tr. 18-20, 27-35)
Applicant testified that in 2018, he began seeing Dr. Z about every two to three
months to have his prescriptions refilled for his depression. He was advised by Dr. Z to
not consume alcohol while taking the depression medications. Dr. Z would ask him “where
his brain was at?” (Tr. 42) He said he was prescribed Antabuse by Dr. Z. He took it for six
months  and  stopped  drinking.  He  said  that  Dr.  Z  decided  in  early  2021  to  stop  the
Antabuse because Applicant was not drinking. Applicant testified that he told Dr. Z that
he had resumed consuming alcohol, but it was controlled. He admitted he has attempted
to abstain from alcohol consumption on several occasions in the past, but would always
resume drinking. (Tr. 15, 41-46)
Applicant  testified  that  he  believed  in  the  past  he  resorted  to  alcohol  use  when
under stress, but does not do this any longer. He said he is in a different place now than
when the  security clearance process started. His  believes his brain is sharper, and he
solves problems better. He is not willing to abstain from alcohol consumption because he
enjoys drinking while watching football on the weekends. He said he has been seeing a
therapist since mid-2020 about once a month due to his mother’s passing. He consumed
alcohol when his mother and sister passed away in 2019 and 2020. He explained, he had
a couple of bad days. During this time, he was drinking about 12 beers on each day of
the weekend. (Tr. 16-18, 46-50)
DOD CAF requested a psychological evaluation of Applicant and it was conducted
licensed  clinical  psychologist  and  board-certified
in  February  2020  by  a
neuropsychologist. Applicant told the psychologist that after his 2016 car accident it was
a wake-up call and he stopped drinking alcohol completely for a few years, but in the last
six  months  he  and  his  fiancée  occasionally  have  a  couple  of  glasses  of  wine  on  the
weekends. He said he is not addicted to alcohol anymore. He did not freely report that he
had seen his psychiatrist after consuming alcohol. He told the psychologist that he only
drank beer. He was confronted with Dr. G’s medical records from October 2017, where it
was noted he was drinking a fifth of vodka or rum per  day. He admitted that he did so
briefly after his sister’s passing. (Tr. 52-54; GE 2)
The psychologist noted during the evaluation that Applicant was not defensive, but
was  not  forthcoming  with  information.  When  directly  questioned  about  information,  he
never denied the incidents, but seemed to minimize them. During the testing process, she
noted that he also was not completely forthcoming in his responses. She indicated that
given his response style and tendency to withhold information during the interview unless
directly  confronted,  his  test  results  are  unlikely  to  capture  any  true  psychological
conditions and reflect only his own self-description. She noted that his profile indicates
poor insight into his history of alcohol misuse, or the difficulties alcohol use has had in his
life. His interest in and motivation for treatment is below average compared to adults who
are not being seen in a therapeutic setting, and a great deal lower than those in treatment
settings. She  stated: “This indicates that he is satisfied with himself as he is, and sees
little need for changes in his behavior. As such, he is likely to be reluctant to commit to
therapy.” (GE 2)
I
The  psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with  Alcohol  Use  Disorder-Severe;
-
Major  Depressive  Disorder,  Recurrent,  Moderate.  She  found  that  Applicant
-
continues  to consume  alcohol  and  has  not  undergone  treatment  for  alcohol  use
disorder.  She  has concerns  that  he  is  a  high  risk  for  relapse.  She  observed
that  during  their interview,  Applicant  either  lacked  insight  into  his  problematic
alcohol  use  or  was intentionally  attempting
Applicant’s  prognosis
likely  to  be  impaired.  (Tr. 52-54; GE 2)
is guarded  and  his  judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  is
to  downplay  his  alcohol  use.
During his hearing, Applicant admitted that he was not truthful to the psychologist
during his interview. He said he was embarrassed to admit his alcohol use. When asked
what  has  changed,  he  said  he  is  getting  older  and  more  honest.  He  does  not  think
alcohol impacts his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. He said he tried Alcoholics
Anonymous  in  2018,  but  does  not  like  the  religious  connotations.  He  now  practices
meditation and yoga. (Tr. 52-54)
Applicant  consumes  alcohol  on  the  weekends  with  his  fiancée.  She  consumes
about the same amount of alcohol as he does. During a typical month during the football
season, they will watch games at their house on two weekends and the other two they
go
to one of his sisters’ houses, which are about ten miles away. Either his fiancée or he will
drive home after they have consumed alcohol. Applicant said he will wait about an hour
after  drinking  before  driving.  He  said  I’m  not  super  intoxicated,  I’m  just  sort  of  a  little
buzzed.”  (Tr. 58) He admitted he would likely be over the legal limit. When asked why
would he risk driving, he said they just want to get home. He estimated he has done this
about four or five times. He believes he had an alcohol problem in the past, but no longer
does. He does not intend to abstain from alcohol consumption because he enjoys it. He
stated  that when football season  is over, he will stop  drinking.  However, he  intends  to
resume when the new season starts. I did not find Applicant credible (Tr. 46-47, 54-60)
Applicant  testified  that  he  is  embarrassed  about  not  being  forthright  about  his
drinking. He is stronger now and is not going to let alcohol take over his life. He loves his
job and has been taking classes to improve his chances for professional advancement.

"Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and SOR ¶¶ 4.a – 4.g,
all without further comment. He denied the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 4.h, 4.i, and 4.j,
all with narrative explanations. He did not answer SOR ¶ 2.b, but it is a cross-allegation
of subparagraphs ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, both of which he admitted. Applicant’s admissions and
explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old. He has never married and he has no children. (Tr. 52)
He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1996. He has taken subsequent graduate classes and
is about four credits shy of a master’s degree. (Tr. 53, 63; GE 3 at 11-12)
Applicant’s  employment  history   is  detailed   in  security   clearance   applications
(SCAs)  he   submitted   in  connection   with   his  employment,  in   January   2010   (GE   1),
February  2015  (GE  2),  and  January  2018  (GE  3)  and  an  SF-85P  application  for  a
position  of  public  trust  in  September  2018.  (GE  5)  Applicant  also  submitted  a
Declaration for Federal Employment (DFE) in September 2018. (GE 4)
From 2007 until July 2012, Applicant worked in various classified positions with a
variety  of  defense  contractors.  (GE  1  at  17-22,  46,  GE  2  at  15)  He  has  held  various
positions  in  the  IT  field,  mostly  as  a  contractor,  in  the  years  since.  Since  July  2017,
Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor,  defense
contractor  S.  (GE  5  at  10)  He  has  held  a  clearance  for  about  15  years,  and  he  also
holds a clearance with another government agency (AGA). (Tr. 13, 53-54, 141-142) At
the time of the hearing, he had an annual salary of $120,000. (Tr. 143)
From   July   2012   to   July   2013,  Applicant  worked   for  another  department  of  the
U.S.  Government  as   an   information   security   specialist.  He  testified   that   he   had
nationwide   responsibility   for  IT  security   regarding   the   Affordable   Care   Act   (ACA),
working   with  each  of  the  50  states.   He described  the  experience  as “a nightmare.” He
had  no  prior government experience,  and  little  to  no  support. He said he   had  “no  idea
what to  do.”  He missed  deadlines and  acknowledged  that  he  “failed  to  perform  up  to  the
expectations”   of  the   job.  He   said   it   was  “completely   my   fault.”  (Tr.  55-57)   Following   a
written   warning   in  January   2013,  Applicant  was  terminated   from   that  position   in  July
2013  for unsatisfactory  performance.  (SOR ¶¶  4.f,  4.g)  (GE 2  at 13-14) As Department
Counsel  acknowledged,  the   “internet  rollout”   of   the   ACA  had   significant  problems,  as
was  widely   publicized   at  the   time, and  Applicant  was  by   no   means  solely   responsible.
(Tr.  98-99)  Applicant  said  he   did  not   have   any   personality   conflicts,   and   praised   the
interpersonal and  professional skills of his co-workers there. (Tr. 99-100)
Shortly   thereafter,  in   July   2013,   Applicant  began   working   for  government
contractor   C.  He   said  he   loved   his   job,   which  involved   travelling   to   Army   bases
nationwide   and   testing   IT   equipment.   He  also  said   the   job   was  in  a   very   stressful
environment  with   lots  of   travel  and   little  sleep.  He  said  he   did  not  get  along   with   his
boss. Following  two  written  warnings, in September 2013  and  December 2013  (SOR ¶¶
4.f, 4.e), Applicant was placed  on  a  probationary  performance  plan. In  about April 2014,
he  and  his boss got into  a  heated  argument.  Applicant was  terminated  soon  thereafter
for failing  to  perform  to  expectations and  for losing  his temper. (SOR ¶  4.c) (GE  2  at 12-
13,  GE   7;  Tr.  58-59,  101-102)  He  did  not  dispute   his  employer’s  version   of   his  work
performance. (Tr. 60)  He believes they were looking to get him  to resign. (Tr. 101-102)
In   June   2014,  Applicant  began   working   part   time  for another federal  contractor,
T.  (GE   2   at  11;  Tr.  60-62,  107-110)  Beginning   in  December  2015,  he   also   began
working   full   time   for  another  contractor,  M.   (Tr.  61-62)  He   worked   both   jobs  until  July
2017, when  he  was terminated  by  contractor T for unsatisfactory  performance,  after he
missed   some   important  deadlines  for  the   customer  (another  large   defense   contractor)
because   he   did  not  have   enough   time   to   devote   to   the   work.   (SOR  ¶   4.a)  (Tr.  61-62,
110-112)  However, Applicant was otherwise well-regarded  by  contractor T.  (Tr. 110-112
and  AE  E, a July 2017  letter from the  president of contractor T)
Guideline K:
In May 2017, Applicant was working for contractor M at an Army facility. He said
he  was  not  in  a  “SCIF”  (Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facility)  but  did  have
access to what he  called  a  “simulated” SIPRNet, which he asserted had not been fully
accredited. (Tr. 108-109; Answer) While there, he received an unclassified e-mail from
Ms. M, his government supervisor, the contractor office’s representative (COR). (Tr. 44)
The e-mail listed all of the names of the systems within the lab that were supported by
his  then  employer.  Some  of  the  systems  processed  classified  information.  The  e-mail
was  labeled  as  “unclassified,”  but  the  spreadsheet  document  contained  the  names  of
some  classified  systems.  (Tr.  36)  Applicant  was  supposed  to  complete  appropriate
“patches” for that particular week on the document and then return it to Ms. M, per her
instructions, which he did. (Tr. 36, 46; Answer)
Applicant  acknowledged  in  his  testimony  that  he  should  have  encrypted  the  list
when he returned it, but he said the list was also not encrypted when he got it. “I didn’t
think it needed to be encrypted because of the publically available information and there
was  no  classified  information  in  the  e-mail.”  (Tr.  47)  He  said  that  he  believes  that  the
COR  should  have  known  that  “she  was  setting  someone  up  for  aggregation”  of
classified information. (Tr. 48)
Applicant  also  denied  that any classified  spillage  took  place, because  “nowhere
within  the  SEC  community  classification  guide  does  it  say  that  the  names  of  any
classified  systems  were  themselves  classified.” (Tr.  42)  This assertion  is unsupported.
He  said  it  was  the  aggregation  of  certain  information  that  was  classified.  (Tr.  43)  He
denied moving any classified information onto an unclassified system. (Tr. 44; Answer)
Applicant  said  he   was  he   was  “accused   of   committing   aggregated   spillage.”  He
indicated   in   his  testimony   and   in   his  Answer  that   he   was  pressured   to   sign   a   security
form   acknowledging   culpability   for  the   spill.  (Answer)   He  believes  he   was  “intimidated
into  telling  the  government that it was my  fault and  [that]  I’ll  never do  it again.” (Tr. 37,
48) The security form referenced  by Applicant is not in evidence.
The  Government’s  evidence  includes  a  May  10,  2017  memo  from  the  Army
command to Applicant’s employer that names Applicant as “the originator of a classified
spillage  that  occurred  on  5  May  2017.”  (GE  8  at  3;  GE  8  at  6)  In  its  memo,  the  Army
Information  Assurance,
cited  Army  Regulation  25-2,
Paragraph  4-14,  Personnel  Security  Standards;  subparagraph  b.(6):  “New,  credible,
derogatory information revokes any standing waiver and results in immediate denial of
access to IT systems.” (GE 6 at 3)
Information  Management,
As  a  result,  Applicant’s  access  to  the  government  customer’s  information
technology (IT) system was suspended that day, pending the results of an Army inquiry.
(GE 8 at 3) As a result, Applicant could not perform his duties for contractor M, so he
was terminated, on May 12, 2017. (GE 8 at 6, Tr. 49-52) (SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 4.b)
The  termination  memo  to  Applicant from  his employer began, “This  letter serves
as  your  official  notice   that  you   have   been   removed   from   contract  due   to   unintentional
classified   spillage.”  (GE  8   at  4)   (Emphasis  added)  This  conclusion   comports  with
Applicant’s testimony  that his actions were unintentional and  not  deliberate. (Tr. 50-51,
103-104) He  continues  to  believe  that  the  information  at  issue  in  the  incident  was not in
fact classified; and  he  attested  that others working  in the  lab  told  him  this as well. (Tr.
106-107)  However,  Applicant   stated   at  the   hearing   that   he   acknowledged   to   his
employer at the time that he was culpable  for the incident. (Tr. 105-106)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  verbally  informed  of  the  government  customer’s
concerns about the spillage incident, but was not given an opportunity to respond, either
verbally or in writing. (Tr. 103-104) He said he  “strongly disagreed  with  the  decision  to
terminate  him,  and  he  said  he  “did  not  spill  or  aggregate  classified  information.”  He
believes  that  the  government  supervisor  should  have  “retracted”  (i.e.,  redacted)  or
encrypted  the  information.  (Tr.  37-39)  He  said  he  was  not  aware  of  the  result  of  any
government investigation into the incident, and he is not aware that his clearance itself
was  ever  suspended.  (Tr.  54-55,  139)  Nor  is  there  documentation  of  any  such
investigation in the record.
Applicant said he had no other employment issues at contractor M before he was
terminated over the spillage incident. (Tr. 107) He said he was told he was eligible for
rehire.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant  also  noted  his  stellar  security  record,  with  no  violations,  and
said this would not happen again. (Tr. 39-40)
The Government did not offer testimony of any expert witness in the security field
regarding whether the spillage  was in fact classified; whether it was due  to  Applicant’s
culpability;  whether  Applicant’s  actions  were  deliberate,  negligent,  or  inadvertent;  and
what  damage  to national security  resulted from the spill,  if  any.  Beyond  the  May 2017
letter from the Army on the matter  (GE 8), the Government offered no evidence of the
conclusions of any investigating authorities. Nor did the Government offer any testimony
about applicability of any of the NISPOM paragraphs cited in the SOR.
Guidelines J & G:
In  August  2007,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence of alcohol. (DUI) (SOR ¶ 1.b) He explained that he was drinking at a pub one
evening and was pulled over on his way home after making a left turn at a red light. He
failed a roadside breathalyzer test. He was cited or ticketed, and allowed to take a cab
home. He said he was not arrested. He went to court in August 2007 and received one
year of probation  including a six-month alcohol awareness group therapy program. He
completed  the  program  early,  in  April  2008.  (Tr.  64-65;  GE  1  at  45,  93-96)  Applicant
was required to abstain from alcohol while on probation, but resumed drinking casually
once his probation ended. (Tr. 94-95)
In  June  2017,  Applicant  was  out  one  night  at  a  nightclub  and  restaurant  with  a
friend. Applicant had about three beers and two shots. While driving the friend home in
the early morning hours, he crossed the center line and was pulled over by police. After
failing  a  roadside  sobriety  test  and  refusing  a  breathalyzer,  he  was  arrested  and
charged with driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI) (SOR ¶ 1.a (Tr. 118-119) He was
later allowed to call a cab. Applicant acknowledged at his hearing that he had had too
much to drink, and that it was “completely my fault.” (Tr. 66) He pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to  two  years of  probation.  He also  spent three  weekends  in  jail.  (Tr. 65-66,
69)
In  July  2017,  Applicant  was  evaluated  and  found  appropriate  for  a  26-week
outpatient substance abuse treatment program. No diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder
was  indicated.  (Tr.  67-68,  72;  AE  B)  The  program  consisted  of  group  sessions.
Applicant was an active and positive participant and was regarded as a model client. He
completed the program successfully in early March 2018. (AE B)
In  November 2017, while  on probation for the  DWI, Applicant was  arrested and
charged  with  a  probation  violation,  after  he  attempted  to  purchase  a  firearm  in  a
neighboring state. (SOR ¶ 2.a) Applicant testified that during this period, when he was
“going  in  and  out  of  jail”  on  weekends,  he  would  make  himself  feel  better  by  “buying
things.” He saw a shotgun that he thought his father would like as a gift. The best deal
for the gun was in a neighboring state, where there was no sales tax, so he went there
to purchase the weapon. (Tr.  73-74) The attempted firearms purchase was disallowed
because of the background check. (Tr. 143-144) Applicant does not own any firearms.
(Tr. 74)
Applicant testified that he was not aware that his actions were prohibited while on
probation, because he did not read the full details of his probation document and other
available information detailing the restrictions. (Tr. 73, 124) His DWI charge came up in
the  background  check  for  the  firearms  purchase.  A  warrant  was  issued,  and  he  was
arrested. Applicant had to perform 10 hours of community service as a result, which he
completed in May 2018. (Tr. 68, 71; AE C, AE D) Applicant acknowledged the probation
violation was his fault. (Tr. 73) He testified that he reported the violation to his employer.
(Tr. 124)
Applicant  testified  that  there  was  no  other  negative  impact  on  his  probation  for
the DWI. He completed  probation  successfully in  August 2019. (GE  6 at 3;  Tr. 69) He
has had no other charges. (Tr. 143)
Applicant said he was required to abstain from drinking while on probation  for two
years, and  did  so. (Tr.  119-120)  He  said  that  since  his second  alcohol offense,  he  has
significantly   curtailed   his  drinking.  He  recalled   having   “a  drink  or  two”  at  home   on
Memorial  Day   and   on   the   July   4th   weekend   (2021),  but  otherwise,  “I  really   don’t  drink
much  at all.” And  he  does not  drink and  drive  “no  matter how  much  I’ve  been  drinking.”
(Tr. 71, 119, 123)  He said he  now  consumes alcohol once  a  week or less (“if  that.”). He
said he  consumes  at most,  three  beers, and  not  to  intoxication. (Tr. 120-122) Applicant
said he  was not currently  in any  alcohol counseling  or therapy  and  does not believe  he
has an alcohol problem. (Tr. 122-123)
Guideline E:
Having  submitted  an  SCA  in  January  2018  (GE  3),  Applicant  had  a  related
background interview on September 13, 2018. (GE 6 at 5-10) Days later, on September
17,  2018  (addendum  signed  September  18,  2018),  Applicant  submitted  a  Declaration
for  Federal  Employment  (GE  4),  for  a  job  application  with  another  government
department.  (Tr.  88-89)  He  then  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  Public  Trust  Positions
(SF-85P).  on  September  27,  2018.  (GE  5) The  record  does  not  contain  a  subsequent
background interview after GE 4 and GE 5.
The Guideline E allegations in the SOR concern Applicant’s allegedly deliberate
failure to disclose some of his arrests and some of his employment terminations on his
January  2018  SCA  and  his  September  2018  SF-85P  application.  Applicant  denied  all
allegations of deliberate falsification in the SOR. (Answer; Tr. 74)
Alleged  Falsifications relating to  Arrests:
SOR ¶ 4.h alleges in part, that in answering a series of questions on his January
2018  SCA  with  a  seven-year  timeframe  (“In  the  past  seven  (7)  years  …”),  Applicant
failed to disclose his first DUI in 2007. (GE 3 at 35) During questioning at his hearing, it
became  clear  that  Applicant  had  no  duty  to  disclose  that  offense  in  answer  to  those
questions, since it occurred in 2007, 11 years prior. (Tr. 75-82)
Applicant  acknowledged,  however,  that  he  also  did  not  list  his  2007  DUI  in
answer to other questions on GE 3, such  as “Other than those offenses already listed,
have you  EVER had the following happen to you? . . . Have  you EVER been charged
with  an  offense  involving  alcohol or drugs?” (GE  1  at 37)  Falsification  of  that  question
was not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  had   disclosed   his  2007   DUI  on   his  2010   SCA,   and   detailed   the
circumstances of  the  arrest,  his court case, and  alcohol awareness program. (GE 1  at
43-45; Tr. 96-98) He did not list the 2007 DUI on his 2015 SCA, in answer to a question,
“Have  you  EVER been  charged  with  an offense  involving  alcohol or drugs.” (GE 2  at 31-
32) When  asked  why  he  did  not  list the  2007  DUI in answer to  that question,  Applicant
said  he   “must  have   misinterpreted   the   question   and   that  it   was  another  seven-year
question.”   He  asserted   that   he   would   not   have   “intentionally   tried   to   hide   something   I
already  [had] previously  disclosed.” (Tr. 115, 116)  This omission  was not alleged  in the
SOR as a deliberate  falsification.
Applicant  also  explained  that  when  he  was  interviewed  in  2015  about  his
previous SCA, he was told by the interviewing agent that he did not have to discuss his
2007 DUI after that interview. (Tr. 75-78, 117-118) Applicant also volunteered the 2007
DUI  in  his  September  2018  background  interview  (GE  6  at  10)  and  listed  it  on  his
September 2018 SF-85P. (GE 5 at 27)
On  his January  2018  SCA,  Applicant disclosed  his 2017  DUI, but did  not disclose
his November 2017  probation  violation  arrest  for the  attempted  gun  purchase. (GE  3  at
35) This omission is alleged as an  additional deliberate  falsification in SOR ¶ 1.h.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  should  have  disclosed  his  2017  probation
violation  arrest  on  GE  3.  He  asserted  that  he  told  his  security  chief  and  program
manager about it, but this is uncorroborated. He denied intentionally failing to disclose it
and said he must have overlooked it or misinterpreted the question. (Tr. 82) However,
Applicant  acknowledged  that  in  January  2018,  the  charge  from  the  November  2017
probation violation was pending, and had yet to be adjudicated. (Tr. 144-147) As such,
he  should  have  disclosed  it  in  answer  to  the  question,  “Are  you  currently  on  trial  or
awaiting  a  trial  on  criminal  charges.”  (GE  3  at  35)  That  omission,  however,  was  not
alleged in the SOR as a deliberate falsification. The summary of Applicant’s September
2018  background  interview  reflects  that  he  voluntarily  disclosed  the  arrest  and  the
violation to the interviewer. (GE 6 at 9)
When   he   prepared   his  September  27,  2018   SF-85-P,  Applicant  disclosed   both
the   2007   DUI  arrest  and   the   2017   DWI   arrest,   but,   again,   not  the   subsequent  2017
probation   violation   arrest,  in  answer  to   a   question   about  his  criminal  history   with   a
seven-year timeframe.  (SOR ¶  4.j)  Of this  omission,  Applicant  said, “I  don’t  know  why  I
would intentionally  deny  it. Maybe  because  it  hadn’t gone  to  trial yet,  I’m  not sure.” (Tr.
83)   In   fact,   the   document  regarding   Applicant’s  completion   of   the   10   hours  of  work
release   shows  a   trial  date   of   March  27,  2018,  and   that  he   completed   the   required
community  service a  month  later,  so  the  charge  was no  longer pending  by  September
2018. (AE D)
Asked why he failed to list his 2017 probation violation arrest on either GE 3 or
GE 5, Applicant said, “I don’t know why I wouldn’t have, Your Honor. I discussed it with
both  investigators.  It  must  have  been  an  oversight  on  my  part  and  I’m  sorry.”  (Tr.  90,
130-131)
Alleged Falsifications relating to  Employment  Terminations:
SOR  ¶  4.i  concerns  several  employment-related  falsification  allegations  on
Applicant’s  September  2018  SF-85P.  (GE  5)  In  answer  to  a  question  calling  for
disclosure of all employment terminations in the past seven years, Applicant disclosed
his  2017  termination  from  contractor  M  (SOR  ¶  4.b),  but  he  did  not  disclose  his  other
terminations,  from  contractor  T  in  July  2017;  from  contractor  C  in  April  2014  (SOR  ¶
4.c); or from his federal job in January 2013 (SOR ¶ 4.g).
When asked why he did not disclose these other terminations on GE 5, Applicant
testified that he had filled out a lot of SCAs and  SF-85Ps in the past, and believed he
had  disclosed  them  previously.  He  asserted  that  the  errors  he  made  on  his  various
applications  were honest mistakes, and  were  not an  attempt  to  “obfuscate  any sins or
past indiscretions whatsoever.” (Tr. 91)
On his 2015 SCA, Applicant disclosed his termination from another government
department and provided extensive details. (GE 2 at 13-15) He also disclosed his April
2014  termination  from  contractor  C  and  noted  that  he  had  been  fired  because  the
customer was not satisfied with his work, (GE 2 at 12-13)
On  his  January  2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  his  July  2017  termination  from
contractor T, and  noted  that the  customer, a  large  defense  contractor, “didn’t need  my
input  anymore.”  (GE  3  at  14-15;  Tr.  125).  He  disclosed  his  2017  termination  from
contractor M, said that he “left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of
misconduct,”  noted  the  spillage  incident,  and  said  he  had  been  removed  from  the
contract, but was subject to rehire. (GE 3 at 16; Tr. 125)
On   his  January   2018   SCA,   Applicant  also   noted   other  terminations,  from
contractor  C,   in  April  2014   and   from   the   federal  department   job,  in  July   2013,   but   he
gave  no  details. (GE 3  at 17-18) He also answered  “No” in answering  questions calling
for  disclosure  of   adverse  circumstances   (if   he   was  fired,  quit,   or  left  by   mutual
agreement following  allegations of  misconduct or  unsatisfactory  performance). (GE 3  at
27)  Applicant  explained   that,   he   was  confused   by   the   page   break   in  the   middle  of  the
page   that  he   filled   out,   and   did  not  realize   he   should  have   answered   “yes”  to   the
question,  since   he   knew   he   had   been   fired   by   contractor  C.  (Tr.  126-129)   No
employment-termination-related  falsifications of GE 3  are alleged  in the SOR.
Applicant  discussed  his  various  terminations  during  his  September  13,  2018
background  interview.  (GE  6  ay  6-7).  However,  on  his  September  27,  2018  SF-85P,
submitted  only  two  weeks  later,  Applicant  did  not  disclose  his  terminations  from
contractor  C  and  contractor  T,  both  of  which  had  occurred  during  the  previous  seven
years,  in  answer  to  a  question  calling  for  disclosure  of  those  events.  (GE  5  at  22).
Curiously,  Applicant  disclosed  his  July  2017  termination  from  contractor  M,  which
occurred  within  the  seven-year  timeframe  of  the  question,  but  also  two  other
terminations from many years before, in 2002 and 2005. (GE 5 at 22; Tr. 137) Applicant
again acknowledged that he should have disclosed the terminations from contractors C
and  T,  but  asserted  that  his  omissions  were  unintentional.  (Tr.  137-138)  Applicant
expressed remorse for his errors and apologized for them. (Tr. 147-148, 161-162)
Applicant  also  did  not  list  his  terminations  from  contractors  C,  M,  and  T  on  his
Declaration  for  Federal  Employment,  in  September  2018,  despite  the  presence  of  a
question calling for disclosure of all employment terminations in the last five years. (GE
4 at Question 12). As to this form, Applicant explained that he thought the question he
was only being  asked  to  disclose  terminations from  “a federal job  or a  government job
within the  last  five  years. That’s how  I looked  at the  question.” (Tr.  134-135) Applicant
maintained  his  interpretation  of  the  question  under  additional  questioning  at  hearing.
(Tr. 135-136)
Among the documents Applicant submitted after the hearing was a  DFE that he
submitted in April 2020. (AE G) On that form, he checked “Yes” to a question asking if,
during the  last  seven  years, he  had  been  convicted,  imprisoned,  been  in  prison,  been
on probation or been on parole. The question “includes felonies, firearms or explosives
violations,  misdemeanors,  and  all  other  offenses.”  (AE  G  at  Q.  9)  He  reported  an
offense as follows:
2019   [City   B,  State   X].   2.   Year
Question   9:   Misdemeanor  DUI  5/17/----
probation  completed  August 2019. No further  issues” followed  by  a  phone
number (AE G at 2) (Emphasis added).
The   year of  the   offense   given,  2019,  is   likely  an   error,   as   probation   ended   only
months   later,   in  August  2019,   and   there  was  no   discussion   at  hearing   of   a   May   2019
DUI.   I  conclude   that  he   likely   meant   to   disclose   his  2017   DUI  on   AE   G.  Yet   Applicant
also did not list his November 2017  arrest for  the  probation  violation  on  AE  G, in answer
to   this  question   with   a   seven-year  timeframe,  and   also   said  that   probation   was
completed with “no other issues.”
AE G also contained a question asking, in part,
During the last five years, have you been fired for a job for any reason, did
you  quit  after  being  told  that  you  would  be  fired,  did  you  leave  any  job
because  of  specific  problems,  or  were  you  debarred  from  Federal
employment by the Office of Personnel Management or any other Federal
agency? (AE G at Q. 12)
Applicant  answered   “Yes”  and   disclosed   his  May   2017   termination   from
contractor  M   “per  request  of   the   Government  COR  for  allegedly   mishandling   sensitive
information;  eligible   for  rehire.”  (AE   G  at  2)  He  did  not  disclose   his  termination   from
contractor  T,  in  July   2017.   Since   Applicant   submitted   AE   G  post-hearing,  he   was  not
questioned about any of these  answers.
Since  his termination  following  the  spillage  incident  in  May  2017,  Applicant  has
subsequently participated in extensive annual training required for his position. After the
hearing,  he  provided  extensive  documentation  of  his  remedial  and  other  security
training on numerous subjects related to his professional position. (Tr. 140; AE F, AE H)
Applicant’s  2020   performance   review   reflects  that  he   exceeds   expectations
across  the  board.  He performed   “extraordinary   work”   under difficult  circumstances.   He
is  a   highly   trained   and   capable   security   professional  and   greatly  contributed   to   the
mission’s success. (AE A)
",True
"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, the hearing testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is   43   years old.   He   enlisted   in   the   U.S.   Navy   following   his  graduation
from  high  school in 1996. He served  in the  Navy  until 2005. He has worked  as a  mechanic
for three  U.S.  Government contractors since  2006.  He  testified  that  he  has never held  a
security  clearance  because  he  was never required  to  have  one  to  access the  military  base
at which he works. He now requires a clearance,  and his current employer is sponsoring
him  to  meet  the  requirements for base  access. He has never married  and  has no  children.
In  2018,  he purchased  a  home  with  the  help of  his parents, who  live  with  him.  (Tr. at  37-
39, 88.)
Applicant has suffered from social anxiety since he was in high school. He began
drinking alcohol when he was a senior in high school. He self-medicated with alcohol to
try to control his anxiety. He has a history of  drinking to excess followed by periods of
sobriety. (Tr. at 41-42, 47-49.)
SOR Allegations
Paragraph  1,  Guideline  I  - The  SOR  sets  forth  five  allegations  regarding
Applicant’s psychological condition. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations with
explanations.  The  details  regarding  each  of  the  allegations  under  this  adjudicative
guideline (AG) are as follows:
1.a  Mental  health treatment from June 2009  to  about  March 2010  –  By  mid-
2009, Applicant’s anxiety  “was out of control.” He was drinking  alcohol heavily  at the  time.
He  experienced  additional stress due  to  an  arrest for driving  under the  influence  of  alcohol
(DUI) in November 2008  (SOR subparagraph  2.c). His relationship with  his girlfriend  was
also causing  him  stress. From  June  2009  to  June  2010,  he received  outpatient  mental
health  treatment for his anxiety.  He was prescribed  multiple  medications  for his condition.
His medical records note that he has a history of social anxiety disorder. (Answer at 2; Tr.
at 48-49; GE 4 at 3; GE 6 at 20, 24, 29.)
1.b  Involuntary  mental  health treatment  beginning in  August  2010, following
an episode of  anxiety  and hallucinations  –  A couple of months later, Applicant was
involuntarily hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and hallucinations. He reported
hearing “many voices” saying they will “kill him.” He was using alcohol excessively at the
time to self-medicate. Applicant was hospitalized after he searched in the area near his
home looking for the sources of the voices. When he could not find them, he experienced
suicidal thoughts and cut his arms several times. His roommate became concerned and
called an ambulance. His therapist diagnosed Applicant with “depression/psychosis” and
“alcohol induced psychosis.” When his involuntary commitment terminated, he continued
voluntary  inpatient  treatment  for  about  a  week.  He  then  continued  with  outpatient
treatment until February 2011. He was prescribed medications for depression, but he did
not want to stay on the drugs. He testified that his therapist at the time agreed that he
should stop taking prescription drugs, and he did. He also stopped his treatment with his
therapist due to his loss of insurance coverage because of a change of employers. At that
time, he was not drinking alcohol. (Tr. at 50-59; GE 4 at 3; GE 6 at 10, 15, 16.)
1.c   Mental   health  treatment  from  about   July   2014   to   October  2014   for  a
condition  diagnosed   as   social  anxiety   –   Applicant  continued  without  counseling  or
medication until July 2014. He does not recall why he sought mental health treatment at
that time. He testified that he might have been having difficulties with co-workers. He also
admitted that he had started drinking alcohol in early 2014. He decided to seek treatment
for his social anxiety. He did not explain why he stopped this treatment in October 2014.
As discussed below, he was arrested and charged with his third DUI in October 2014. He
stopped his mental health treatment that same month. (Tr. at 56-60, 71; Answer at 3.)
1.d  Inpatient   mental   health  treatment  from  March  2018   to   April   2018   for
alcohol detoxification  and treatment for hallucinations –  From  October 2014  to  March
2018, Applicant received  no  mental-health  treatment, although  he  participated  in  an  18-
month  court-ordered  alcohol  program  as  a  result of his October  2014  DUI. For a  period
prior to  March  2018, he  resumed  using  alcohol to  self-medicate.  He  was under stress at
work due  to  an  allegation  made  against  him  by  a  female  co-worker. In  March  2018,  he
voluntarily  admitted  himself  into  a  treatment facility  for alcohol  detoxification  because  he
realized  he  was drinking  “a little  too  much” and  was starting  to  hear voices again, though
he   testified   that  the   voices  were  not  as   loud   as   in  2010.   He  remained   hospitalized   for
seven  days and  then  was referred  to  an  outpatient program for   aftercare. According  to
the   records,   he   was  diagnosed   with   alcohol   use   disorder  and   alcohol   withdrawal.  He
testified, however,  that his use  of  alcohol was never discussed  when  he  was hospitalized.
He testified  that he  was only  treated  for  social anxiety. He was prescribed  medications
and  saw  his  physician  monthly  for several months  and  then  once  every  three  months. He
returned   to   working   a   night  shift at his job, which  helped   relieve   his social  anxiety.  He
believed  that he  no  longer needed  the  medications.  He did  not like  how  they  made  him
feel.  He testified that the drugs made  him  lose  his  motivation.  (Answer at 3;  Tr. at  61-66,
85; GE 4 at 4.)
Applicant  stayed  on  the  medications,  though,  until March  2020,  the  beginning  of
the  Covid-19  pandemic and  restrictions  on  certain activities. He  testified  that the  Covid-
19  restrictions in his state  made  it difficult for him  to  obtain  his medications.  He was feeling
better  so   he   did  not  “fight”  to   get  the   drugs.   He  did   not  want  to   take   the   drugs  for  his
anxiety. He  testified:
[W]hen  you  have  anxiety, you’re  gonna  get worked  up  at certain times and
that’s   the  only   times   you  need   that medication  and  that’s   the  only   - - you
know, ideal medication, that  would be  the  perfect time  and  it would just kick
in and work and calm  me  down. But it does that constantly.
You  take  it every  day  so  you’re  calm  and  even  calmer when  you  are  already
calm, so there goes your energy.
(Tr. at 76.)
After he stopped taking his medication in 2020, he began drinking again. He would
drink a beer or two at home with his father. He stopped drinking two or three months prior
to the hearing. He started going to the gym about the same time. He has not sought any
counseling  for  his  anxiety.  Now  that  he  understands  that  his  job  is  at  risk  without  a
clearance, he does not intend to drink alcohol. He is dealing with his anxiety as best as
he can. He admitted that he was extremely stressed learning about the date of the hearing
in  this  case.  Without  medication  or  counseling,  he  does  not  have  a  specific  plan  for
dealing with future stressful situations that cause him anxiety. He does better now with
his  parents  living  with  him  and  working  a  night  shift  when  there  are  fewer  co-workers
around him. He testified that drinking alcohol is not a good solution to his anxiety, though
in a moment of complete candor, he admitted that drinking helps temporarily after a day
full of stress. He testified that it was not difficult for him to stop drinking in the past. He
claimed that drinking is not an important part of his life. He further testified that if he cannot
deal with his anxiety, he has no problem seeking help from a mental health counselor “as
long as they’re not trying to push medication.” He also admitted that he has never been
given the option to participate in extended periods of individual counseling for his mental
health condition. (Tr. at 66-73, 86-92.)
1.e  November 2020  mental health evaluation by  a  licensed psychologist with
a  diagnosis  of  social  anxiety  disorder  and alcohol use  disorder, mild/moderate –
The  CAF requested  Applicant  submit to  a  psychological evaluation  in  connection  with  his
application  for a  security  clearance.  The  evaluation  by  a  licensed  psychologist  took place
in  November 2020. The  psychologist diagnosed  Applicant with  social  anxiety  disorder and
alcohol use  disorder, mild/moderate. He noted  that Applicant “has suffered  from  anxiety
since  adolescence,  which has developed  into  a  disorder.”  The  psychologist  noted  in his
prognosis  that “medication  treatment has largely  been  ineffective  and  [Applicant]  had  not
exhibited  a  pattern of stability  outside  of  working  during  the  night shifts.”  The  psychologist
concluded his prognosis with  the following  opinion: “[Applicant’s]  judgment and  reliability
are clearly  impacted  by  his diagnoses.”  Applicant offered  no  professional opinion  about
his mental health  in response  to  the  opinion  of  the  Government’s psychologist.  Applicant’s
counsel noted though that the Government’s expert had not discussed Applicant’s case
with his work colleagues who know him well. (Tr. at 104; GE 6 at 4-6; Answer at 3.)
Paragraph  2,  Guideline   G   -  The  SOR  sets  forth  seven  allegations  regarding
Applicant’s alcohol consumption. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations, with
one exception (SOR subparagraph 2.e), and provided additional information. The details
regarding each of the allegations under this adjudicative guideline (AG) are as follows:
2.a  Consumed alcohol, at times  in excess  and to  the  point  of   intoxication,
from  1996  to  at least November 2020  –
Applicant began drinking alcohol on the day of
his graduation from high school in 1996. He drank excessively and blacked out. After he
enlisted in the Navy, he started binge drinking following his initial training when he was
19 or 20 years old. He continued on and off  drinking, often to the point of intoxication,
until  two  of  three  months  prior  to  the  hearing.  He  has  also  had  extended  periods  of
sobriety  over  the  past  25  years,  typically  while  he  was  participating  in  court-ordered
classes and while seeing a therapist. (Tr. at 66-74; GE 2 at 4-5; Answer at 4.)
2.b November 2002  arrested for DUI  – Applicant’s first of three arrests for DUI
occurred  in  November 2002.  His  BAC  was  .15%.  He  was  convicted  and  sentenced  to
attend  an  alcohol  education  class  and  six  months  of  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings. Applicant was uncomfortable in the group setting of AA meetings, and he did
not  have  a  sponsor.  He  was  also  sentenced  to  five  years  of  probation  and  fined.  He
completed all of the requirements of his sentence. (SCA at 32; Tr. at 75-76; GE 3 at 3;
GE 4 at 2; Answer at 4.)
2.c   November  2008   arrested  for  DUI  –   After  the  completion  of  his  probation,
Applicant was arrested again for DUI. His BAC was .24%. He was again convicted. The
court sentenced Applicant to serve four days in jail and five years on probation. He was
also ordered to attend an 18-month DUI program and AA meetings and was fined. His
driver’s license was suspended for one year. (SCA at 33; Tr. at 76-77; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at
3; GE 4 at 2; Answer at 4.)
2.d October 2014  arrested for DUI –  Prior to his third DUI arrest, Applicant was
drinking  alone  at  his  residence  when  his  girlfriend  arrived.  He  was  drinking  alcohol  to
relieve stress and anxiety. He had completed his probation from his second arrest.  He
had an argument with his girlfriend and left the home in his car. His vehicle hit a telephone
pole and stopped. The police arrived and arrested him. He was convicted and sentenced
to  serve  four  days  in  jail,  to  attend  an  alcohol  education  program,  and  an  18-month
counseling  program.  He  was  also  ordered  to  attend  AA  meetings.  He  was  again
sentenced to serve five years on probation and was fined. He was on probation at the
time he submitted his application for a clearance. (SCA at 29-31; Tr. at 77-78; GE 2 at 4;
GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 2-3; Answer at 4.)
2.e  February  2015  arrested for DUI –  The FBI report for Applicant in the record
lists  a  DUI  arrest  of  Applicant  on  February  13,  2015.  Applicant  testified  that  this
information is incorrect and that he was not arrested for DUI a fourth time. The record
contains no  additional evidence  to  establish  that the  Government’s evidence  is correct.
(Tr. at  78, 82-83;  GE 2 at 4;  GE 3  at 4; Answer at 4.)
2.f Subparagraph 1.e,  above, cross-alleged  under Guideline  G –  As noted, the
psychologist’s diagnosis of Applicant included  “alcohol use disorder, mild/moderate.”  In
his Answer, Applicant’s attorney wrote that Applicant “does not dispute his diagnosis and
recognizes  that  the  consumption  of  alcohol places  his judgment  and  reliability at  risk.”
The  psychologist  viewed  Applicant’s  history  of  alcohol  use  as  “likely  a  form  of  self-
medication for his anxiety.” He commented further that Applicant’s “previous alcohol use
was likely significant enough to warrant a ‘severe’ modifier,” rather than “mild/moderate.”
He  noted  Applicant’s  three  DUI  convictions  and  repeated  periods  of  probation.  In  his
prognosis,  the  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant  continued  to  drink  alcohol  even
though Applicant “recognizes that alcohol may have a deleterious effect on him.” He wrote
further:
[Applicant] continues to consume alcohol and while this may be a response
to  his  heightened  anxiety,  it  still  places  him  at  risk  and  likely  hinders  his
engagement in treatment that could actually produce a sustainable effect.
As  such,  [I]  believe  that  [Applicant’s]  judgment  and  reliability  are  clearly
impacted by his diagnoses.
(Answer at 5; GE 4 at 6.)
2.g Continued drinking of  alcohol,  notwithstanding treatment  for a  condition
diagnosed as  alcohol  use  disorder, as  set forth  in subparagraph  1.d,  above  – In his
July  2021  Answer,  Applicant’s  attorney  wrote  that  Applicant  is  committed  to  a  life  of
sobriety. Applicant had advised the psychologist in November 2020 that he had reduced
his drinking to weekends. He also reported that he no longer consumes stronger alcoholic
drinks.  The  psychologist  correctly  noted  that  Applicant  had  advised  the  background
investigator who conducted his security clearance interview in April 2018 that he would
never consume alcohol again. In the investigator’s interview report, Applicant stated that
he has sought professional help to make sure that he does not drink again. Applicant also
testified that he was never ordered by a court to remain sober and that sobriety was never
a requirement of the DUI programs that he was required  by three courts to attend. He
stopped  drinking  on  his  own  during  the  periods  of  the  three  mandatory  DUI  classes.
(Answer at 5; Tr. at 79-80; GE 2 at 4; GE 4 at 3.)
Mitigation and Whole Person Evidence
Since 1996, when he was a Navy enlistee, Applicant has performed the same or
similar work. He is proud of his skills and work ethic. His current and former supervisors
praised his work and dedication to his job as a civilian contractor for the  military. They
have never experienced any difficulties due to Applicant’s consumption of alcohol or due
to his mental health issues. He has always been reliable. Other co-workers noted in letters
appearing in the record Applicant’s positive  attitude  and commented that he effectively
trains less experienced employees. His team lead wrote that Applicant “is an exemplary
employee and individual.” (Tr. at 19-35; AE C-F.)
Applicant provided his DD 214, which reflects that he was awarded several medals
and ribbons during his nine years of  military service. He noted proudly on his resume,
which is also in the record, that he received a Letter of Commendation from his squadron
in 2005 and a Letter of Appreciation from his Commanding Officer in 1998, as well as two
achievement medals. (AE A at 3; AE B.)
",False
"In  Applicant’s SOR  response,  he  admitted SOR  allegations.  (¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,  1.c,  1.d, and
2.a.) He qualified his admission to ¶ 1.b, that alleged he had used THC while granted access to
classified  information,  with  the  qualification  “if  that’s  what  I  wrote  then  I  admit.”  There  is  no
evidence in the record that Applicant wrote (or stated) that he had used marijuana while holding
a security clearance or while having access to classified information. He did not specifically admit
or deny ¶¶ 3.a, and 4.a. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. (Item 1)
Applicant is 59 years old. He married in 1992 and divorced in 2013, and currently lives
with  a  cohabitant.  Since  September  2018,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor.  Applicant  listed  on  his  April  2019  SCA  that  he  previously  held  a  DOD  security
clearance in approximately 1982. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) showed that
Applicant  had  been  granted  a  secret  security  clearance  in  February  2006.  There  is  no  other
evidence that was submitted to show the specific period of time Applicant possessed his security
clearance, whether it was for one month, one year, or if Applicant continuously held the security
clearance from February 2006 through January 2013. (Items 3, 4 and 6)
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant smoked marijuana (THC) with varying
frequency from about January 1979 to January 2013. His heaviest use occurred during his high
school years and he used marijuana occasionally in his 30s and 40s. Over the course of his life
Applicant  estimated  he  has  used  marijuana  on  about  100  occasions.  He  used  LSD  and
psilocybin mushrooms (hallucinogens) from about 1979 to 2005. His heaviest use occurred in
high school, but he did use these substances again in his 40s. Applicant used cocaine from 1985
to 1995. He experimented with this drug and never enjoyed the experience. Over the course of
ten  years  he  used  cocaine  about  ten  times.  He  has  no  plans  to  use  any  of  these  illegal
substances in the future. (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Applicant  self-reported his illegal drug history on  the  SCA he  signed  in  April 2019.  He
listed that he had not used any illegal drugs while he held a DOD security clearance. During his
background interview in June 2019, which was certified by Applicant in November 2020, he told
the investigator that he had not used any illegal substance while holding a security clearance.
Applicant also responded to an interrogatory question which specifically asked whether he had
used  any  illegal  drugs  after  he  had  been  granted  a  security  clearance  in  February  2006.
Applicant responded; “No.” (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Applicant was granted a security clearance in February 2006, about eight months after
he had been hired by a different federal contractor. Department Counsel argued in the brief that
one  could  assume  that  Applicant  continuously held  a  security  clearance  from  February 2006
until September 2015, when he left that employment. According to Applicant’s admissions, his
use  of  marijuana  until  January  2013  overlapped  with  his  employment  and  possession  of  a
security clearance  if  he  held  it  continuously from  February 2006  until he  left  the  employment
position in September 2015. JPAS reflected the date the security clearance was issued, but it
did not reflect the length of time Applicant possessed the security clearance. (Items 3 and 6)
Under Guideline  G it  alleged  that Applicant  was arrested  in March 2017  for Driving  Under
the   Influence   of  Alcohol.   (DUI)   He   was  found   guilty   and   was  sentenced   to   restricted   driving
privileges  for six   months,  to   serve   eight   days  in   the  Sheriff’s   work program,  completion  of  an
alcohol education  program, fined about $1,900, and he was placed  on three years of probation.
This alcohol-related  allegation  (¶ 2.a) and  all  of  the  allegations under Guideline  H (¶¶  1.a  through
1.d) were cross-alleged  under Guideline J (¶  3.a).  The  allegation that Applicant used marijuana
while  possessing  a  security  clearance  (¶  1.b) was cross-alleged  under  Guideline  E  (¶  4.a).  (Items
1, 2, 3,  4, and 5)
Applicant told the investigator during his June 2019 background interview that this arrest
in 2017 was his only alcohol-related arrest. He successfully completed his court-ordered alcohol
education program and was not recommended to participate in any other alcohol treatment. He
consumed alcohol about three times weekly from the age of 21 until November 2015, when his
mother  passed  away.  After  November  2015  he  consumed  a  greater  volume  of  alcohol  more
frequently. He would consume a couple glasses of wine and on occasion, a shot of bourbon.
After  his  March  2017  DUI  arrest,  he  greatly  reduced  his  alcohol  consumption.  He  told  the
investigator  that  he  did  not  have  a  problem  with  alcohol  and  the  2017  DUI  was  an  isolated
incident. In the 2020 interrogatories,  Applicant reported that he completely stopped all use of
alcohol in October 2019. He also quit smoking tobacco for health, spiritual, and mental reasons.
(Item 4)
",True
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.f, 2.a, 2.b,
2.c, and 2.d. (HE 3) He denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating
and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old  database  analyst  working  for a  defense  contractor. (Tr.
5, 36; GE  1) He orders repair  parts and  supplies using  a  computer. (Tr.  36) In  2010,  he
graduated  from  high  school, and  he  attended  college  for less than  one  semester. (Tr. 5-
6)  He served  in the  Navy  from 2010  to  2018. (Tr. 6, 17) When  he  was discharged  from
the  Navy, he  was a  petty  officer third  class  (E-4). (Tr. 7) His Navy  specialty  was logistics
specialist. (Tr. 6)  He was discharged  for serious misconduct,  and  he  received  a  general
discharge  under honorable  conditions.  (GE  7)  In  2011,  he  married,  and  in  2017,  he  was
divorced. (Tr. 8) His four children  are ages one, two, five, and eight.  (Tr. 8)
Financial Considerations
In January 2018, Applicant’s pay was reduced because of  a reduction in rank to
petty  officer  third  class  from  a  proceeding  under  Article  15,  Uniform  Code  of  Military
Justice  (UCMJ).  (Tr.  22)  He  was  unemployed  for  about  three  months  after  he  was
discharged from the Navy in March 2018. (Tr. 21) He was underemployed after leaving
the Navy. (Tr. 26)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c allege three charged-off debts owed to the same credit
union for $15,988, $10,459, and $4,252. SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e allege two charged-off debts
owed to a bank for $3,422 and $377. SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a medical debt in collection for
$461.
In March 2019, Applicant enrolled in a debt reduction program (DRP). (Tr. 26; SOR
response at 16) DRP told Applicant that they could settle his debts for 50 percent of the
face  amount  of  his debts.  (Tr. 27) He  made  the  agreed  upon  $524  monthly payments
under the DRP. (Tr. 28; SOR response at 17-64) He paid all of the SOR debts except the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for $16,588. (Tr. 29-33; AE A at 5) He anticipates the last debt will be
paid in 2022; however, it is unclear precisely when the debt will be paid under his payment
plan. (Tr. 33; AE A at 5) The DRP indicates the debt is $8,292, and it is in the process of
being paid. (Id.) A settlement agreement from the creditor was not provided.
Applicant  completed  a  personal  financial  statement  (PFS)  after  his  hearing
showing his monthly income was $4,120; his primary payment was monthly alimony of
$1,019;  and  his  monthly  net  remainder  was  $184.  (AE  A  at  1-3)  He  did  not  include  a
payment to DRP in his PFS. Based on his general confusion during the hearing, he may
not have understood how to properly complete the PFS.
Alcohol Consumption  and  Criminal Conduct
SOR ¶¶  2.a,  2.b, and  3.a  allege  that Applicant was arrested  in about December
2011  for  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI)  and  underage  consumption  of  alcohol. (GE  2  at
5) His blood  alcohol  content (BAC)  from a breathalyzer test was .13.  (GE  2  at  5)  He was
found  guilty  of  DWI, and received  a suspended jail sentence with two years of probation,
and  a   $500   fine.  (Id.)  He  completed   a   two-day   Navy   Substance   Abuse   Rehabilitation
Program   (SARP)   alcohol-impact  class.   (Id.)   In   January   2012,   his   commanding   officer
imposed  nonjudicial punishment  (NJP) for  drunk driving, in violation  of Article 111, UCMJ,
for the  December 2011  DWI, and  he  was reduced  from  E-2  to  E-1, received  forfeitures of
half of one  month’s pay for two months, and restriction  for 45 days. (Id.)  See  Tr. 18.
SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.d, and 3.a allege Applicant was arrested in about October 2017 for
DWI, and reckless driving (speeding). His BAC was .11. (GE 6) He was convicted of DWI,
and his driver’s license was suspended for one year. (GE 1) The court sentenced him to
365  days  in  jail  (suspended  for  two  years),  and  he  received  a  $250  fine.  (GE  1)  His
commanding officer imposed NJP for the October 2017 drunk driving offense, in violation
of  Article  111,  UCMJ.  (GE  6)  In  November  2017,  his  commanding  officer  imposed  a
reduction from petty officer first class to petty officer second class and 30 days of extra
duty as well as forfeiture of one half of one month’s pay for two months (suspended). (GE
2 at 2) He received an alcohol evaluation from the Navy SARP, which determined he did
not need to attend alcohol-related classes, counseling, or treatment. (Id.) See Tr. 19-20.
Applicant rarely consumes alcohol, and when he does, he limits his consumption
to two drinks. (Tr. 23-25) He does not believe he has a problem with alcohol consumption.
(Tr. 25)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 4.a alleges that in response to the question on his March 18, 2020 SCA
about the type of discharge he received, Applicant wrote “Honorable.” (GE 1 at 25) His
discharge was actually general under honorable conditions. Applicant was told he was
going  to  be  entitled  to  benefits  from  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  and  he
believed he was getting an honorable discharge. (Tr. 34) After reviewing his DD Form
214, he acknowledged it was a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 34)
He did not intend to deceive security officials with his answer on his SCA. (Tr. 34)
SOR ¶ 4.b alleges that on May 12, 2020, Applicant responded to questions from
an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator about his discharge. It alleged
that  he  falsely  stated  that  he  served  out  his  contract,  and  he  was  not  discharged  for
misconduct.  Actually,  Applicant  received  an  administrative  discharge  after  having  a
hearing. (Tr. 21) He said he misunderstood what the OPM investigator was asking him,
and he intended to accurately convey the processing of his discharge during the interview.
(Tr. 35)
SOR ¶ 4.c alleges that Applicant’s March 18, 2020 SCA asked whether he had
ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol, and he failed to disclosed his DWI
charges  in  2011  and  2017.  Applicant  disclosed  his  2017  DWI  arrest,  and  sentence  in
civilian  court  on  his  SCA.  (GE  1  at  38-39)  On  May  12,  2020,  Applicant  told  an  OPM
investigator that he failed to disclose his 2011 DWI charge on his SCA because he failed
to  carefully read  the  question,  and  he  believed  he  only had  to  disclose  charges  in  the
previous seven years. (GE 2 at 5). He did not intend to deceive anyone with his answers
about his DWIs. (Tr. 35)
Character Evidence
Applicant  received  the  following  Navy  ribbons  and  medals:  National  Defense
Service Medal; Navy  “E” Ribbon  (2); Navy  Good  Conduct Medal  (2); Inherent Resolve
Campaign Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; and Sea Service Deployment
Ribbon. (GE 7)
",True
"Applicant is 41 years old. He has been an employee for a federal defense company
since 1999. He is married and has two children.  He graduated from high school in 1998,
attended community college, but did not receive a degree, and completed a certificate of
completion for a machinist in 2004. He has held his current clearance since 2004. (GX 1)
He  completed  his  (SCA)  on  June  30,  2020.  This  is  his  first  application  for  a  security

(Items 1, 4, 5, and 6)
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant  has been  a  social drinker since  the  age  of  sixteen  while  in high  school.
He would typically  drink on  the  weekends (a six  pack of  beer). He stated  that he  would
have  two  drinks in a  sitting  once  per week to  three  times per month.  In  a  2020  personal
subject   interview,  Applicant   stated   that   he  has  never  had   any   problem   reducing   his
alcohol consumption. (Item 3) Within the past ten years he has been arrested in  alcohol-
related-vehicular  incidents  three  times. Applicant  admitted  the  allegations and   provided
explanations.  (Answer to SOR)
In   his  2020,  subject   interview   Applicant  stated   that  all   of   his  drinking   occurred
during   social  situations,   and   he   never  felt  impaired.  After his first  and   second   DUI,   he
slowed  down  his drinking  to  one time  every  other week, and he  would  have  three  to four
beers each  time. He told the  investigator he  would not drink to  intoxication.  (Item  3)  His
drinking   increased   in   later years due   to   a   loss  of family   members  (two   grandmothers).
(Answer  to  SOR)  He  also  stated  that  he  had  no  intent  to  stop  drinking.  (Item  3)  He
understands that he has made some bad decisions. (Answer to SOR)
As to  the  allegation  under SOR 1.c in 2019, Applicant explained  to  the  investigator
that  he  had  six  to  seven  beers, but  did not feel impaired.  He puts his level of  intoxication
“around   a   “10”.   (Item   3)   He   felt  he   could   drive   after  drinking.   Applicant   took  the
breathalyzer  and   field   tests.   He  spent  a   night  in  jail  and   was  charged   with   DUI  –   2nd
offense.   Appearing   in   Court,  he   was  represented   by   a   lawyer,  and   he   pled   guilty.  He
received  30  days in  jail and  as noted  in  the  SOR, his license  was suspended  for three
years. He was required  to  attend ASAP. (Item  3) Applicant is still  being  monitored  under
ASAP  until December 2022. (Item  3)
He  had  attended  outpatient  group  counseling.  Applicant  reported  in  his  DOHA
interrogatories  that  he was  diagnosed  with Alcohol Use Disorder  –Moderate  SOR  1.d)
and  that  it  was  recommended  that  he  abstain  from  alcohol.  In  his  answer,  Applicant

The SOR (2.c) cross-alleges the information alleged in 1.a through 1.c. Applicant
admitted to all SOR allegations in SOR paragraph 1.a-1.c.
Applicant also admitted to SOR 2.a, that in 2004, he was arrested for possession
of marijuana.  (Items 4-6) He received deferred prosecution after supervised probation

Alcohol Consumption  and Criminal Conduct
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  in  about  December  2018  and
charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. He was stopped while driving home
from  a  holiday  party.  Applicant  entered  a  Nolle  Diversion  Program.  In  April  2019,  he
successfully  completed  the  terms  of  the  diversion  program  to  include  three  days  of
community  service;  completing  a  Traffic  Alcohol  Program  (TAP);  completing  a  Traffic
Safety Program and attending a Victim Impact Panel. (SOR ¶ 1.a: Tr. 27; Gov 4; Gov 5;
Gov 6 at 3)
In  July  2012, Applicant  was arrested  and  charged  with  Driving  Under the  Influence
of  Alcohol. He  attended  a  friend’s birthday  party  and  had  several drinks. He dropped  off
his friend,  and  while  he  was driving  home,  he  was pulled  over for  speeding  and  having
expired  tags. The  police  officer smelled  alcohol on  his breath  and  gave  Applicant a  field
sobriety  test,  which he  failed.  In  2013, Applicant plead  guilty. He was sentenced  to  30
days   house   arrest  with   the   exception   of  driving   to   and   from   work.  His  license   was
suspended  for one  year. He paid  a  $2,500  fine  and  attended  alcohol  awareness classes.
(SOR  ¶ 1.b: Tr. 26-27;  Gov 1 at 34; Gov 2; Gov 3; Gov 6 at 3).
Finally, Applicant was arrested in January 2009 and charged with Driving Under
the Influence of Alcohol. He was drinking at a bar with friends. He claims someone might
have put something in in his drink.  The police pulled him over while he was driving home.
He plead guilty to DUI on September 16, 2009. His driver’s license was suspended for 60
days,  He  entered  a  diversion  program.  Once  he  completed  the  diversion  program  the
conviction was expunged from his records. He initially left this DUI offense off his 2018
security clearance application. He thought he did not have to list the offense because it
was expunged from his record. (SOR ¶1.c: Tr. 24-26; Gov 6 at 3-4)
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant states he is very remorseful and would like to
apologize  to  his  family,  employer  and  government  clients.  They  all  placed  trust  in  his
decision-making  ability.  He  has  complied  with  all  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  each
offense in a timely manner. He has gained a better understanding on how to prevent a
similar situation occurring in the future.
Applicant’s most recent DUI offense in December 2018, occurred shortly after he
submitted his security clearance application. He attempted to contact his Facility Security
Officer (FSO) the next day after his arrest. His FSO did not answer the phone so he sent
an e-mail. (Tr. 30; Gov 4)
As part of his nolle diversion program for the December 2018 offense, Applicant
successfully  completed  a  state-certified  Alcohol  and  Drug  Treatment  Program  on
February  5,  2019.  Dr.  R.,  Clinical  Counselor  for  the  program,  indicates  that  Applicant
successfully  completed  26  sessions  of  the  program.  Dr.  R.  states:  “[Applicant]  was  an
attentive and active participant and contributed with good thoughts in group sessions. It
appears that he had gained knowledge on the consequences of alcohol and illicit drugs
in in his life.”  (Note: The case file provides no evidence Applicant used illicit drugs nor is
it alleged in the SOR.) (Tr. 28; AE B-1)
Applicant was required to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) Victim
Impact Panel. He testified that the panelists spoke about how alcohol-related incidents
negatively affected their lives. He could relate because his father was killed when he was
younger. The panel changed his perspective and made him understand how drinking and
driving can negatively impact others. (Tr. 28-30; AE B-2) Applicant completed 24 hours
of community service. (Tr. 28-30; AE B-3)
Applicant  completed  the  requirements  of  his diversion  program  in  2019.  (AE  C)
He was not diagnosed with an alcohol or substance abuse disorder. He was not advised
to stop drinking alcohol. He occasionally drinks once or twice a week. He meets friends
to watch sports or attend work-related network events. He testified that he has worked to
change his behavior.  He monitors his alcohol consumption and makes sure that he does
not drink and drive. He arranges to take an Uber or Lyft when he plans on drinking. (Tr.
30-32)
Since October 2021, Applicant has met with a therapist every two to three weeks
to seek help with setting better boundaries and self-care, and seeking healthier ways to
relieve  stress.  His  therapist’s  credentials  include  PhD,  LICSW,  and  LCSW-C.  The
therapist provided  a  letter on  Applicant’s behalf  stating  that since  October 2021, Applicant
has made  significant progress on  “managing  stress, regulating  emotions, and  effectively
communicating  thoughts and  feelings.  [Applicant]  fully  engages in  the  therapeutic  process
and consistently  demonstrates commitment to his mental and  emotional well-being.” (Tr.
32-33; AE  E)
Applicant has begun to exercise more and has learned to meditate. He does not
struggle  with  controlling  his  alcohol  intake.  He  has  not  had  an  alcohol-related  incident
since his December 2018 arrest. (Tr. 33)

as  an  example  of  what  they  can  become  if  they  focus  on  their  goals.  Mr.  C.D.  trusts
Applicant and feels lucky that Applicant is willing to teach without receiving pay. He notes
Applicant  faced  his  barriers  and  miscalculation  of  judgment  directly.  Applicant  took
responsibility and shares a wealth of knowledge with the students and anyone else who
needs assistance. (AE B – 5; RSP003)
Applicant provided employer feedback of his duty performance from 2019 to 2021.

"Applicant  is 34 years old  and married. He has  an  associate’s degree. Applicant
has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  2018  and  seeks  to  obtain  national
security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 2 at
Sections 12, 13A, and 17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he consumes intoxicants to excess.
1.a. Applicant admitted that he has consumed alcohol in excess and to the point
of  intoxication  from  about  age  21  to  at  least  April  2019.  In  written  responses  to
interrogatories propounded to him by DOHA, Applicant stated that he last had an alcohol-
related  blackout  in  December  2017.  He  also  admitted  that  he  was  last  intoxicated  in
December 2019. Applicant further stated that he had stopped drinking for health reasons.
(Item 3, Item 4.)
1.b. Applicant admitted  he  had  been  arrested  in  or about March 2009  and  charged
with  Driving  Under the  Influence  (DUI), No Driver’s License  in  Possession, DUI  with  BAC
.08% or More, Speed  in  a  Posted  Zone, and  No Display  of  Registration. Applicant failed
to  appear in  court  and  a  bench  warrant for his arrest was issued  on  April 12, 2010. This
warrant remains active. (Item 5.)
Applicant was first questioned  by  a  Government investigator in August 2010  about
his arrest  and  bench  warrant.  He admitted  the  arrest,  but denied  knowing  about the  bench
warrant. He indicated  at that time  that he would “resolve the  problem.” (Item  4.)
Applicant  was  questioned  by  a  different  Government  investigator  in  April  2019
Applicant admitted the arrest, but stated he was unsure about a bench warrant. Applicant
did admit under further questioning that he was told about the warrant during his  2010
interview. Applicant stated he would talk to his current lawyer, who represented Applicant
in relation to allegation 1.f, about the warrant. There is no information showing Applicant
has done anything further about this case. (Item 3.)
1.c. Applicant was arrested by military police officers in March 2010 while he was
serving  in  the  Marine  Corps.  At  that  time  Applicant  was  intoxicated  and  became
belligerent and physical with the officers. According to Applicant, he did not receive any
judicial or non-judicial punishment due to this incident. (Item 3, Item 7,)
1.d. Applicant was involved in an alcohol-related incident in May 2010, while still
on active duty with the Marine Corps. Applicant was drinking alcohol in the barracks with
another  Marine,  who  was  under  the  drinking  age.  They  both  became  intoxicated  and
damaged  Applicant’s  barracks  room.  Applicant  may  have  received  non-judicial
punishment for this incident, but the record is unclear. (Item 3, Item 4.)
1.e.  Subsequent  to  the  incident  in  May  2010,  Applicant  received  some  form  of
alcohol counseling. The Report of Investigation (ROI) of the 2010 interview stated:
[Applicant]  stated  that  he  was  sent  to  the  Substance  Abuse  Counseling
Center (SACC) on [Base One] for a two-day evaluation which concluded he
had alcohol abuse or dependence issues ([Applicant] was not sure  of the
diagnosis).  [Applicant]  said  that  the  SACC  referred  him  to  their  alcohol
rehabilitation program. [Applicant] reported that he saw a counselor four or
five  times,  but  left  [Base  One]  and  transferred  to  [Base  Two]  prior  to
completing the full rehabilitation program. (Item 4)
At the time of this interview in 2010 Applicant had applied to resume the program
at Base Two, but had not been accepted. No further information was available in the file
or provided by Applicant.
1.f. Applicant was arrested  in January  2019  and  charged  with  DUI.  He stated  in his
Answer “that case  has  been  cleared  and  dismissed  with  prejudice.” This dismissal was
based  on  a  legal technicality. Applicant does not dispute  the  underlying  fact that he  was
driving under the influence  when he was arrested. (Item 6.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about  a  person’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant did not admit or deny this allegation,
which stated that the information set forth under allegations 1.b through 1.d, and 1.f, are
cognizable under this guideline as well.
Paragraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. Applicant
denied both allegations under this paragraph.
3.a. Applicant filled out a Government questionnaire on December 21, 2018. (Item
2.) Section 22 of the questionnaire asked questions about Applicant’s police record. One
subpart of the question asked, “Have you EVER been charged with an offense involving
alcohol or drugs?” (Emphasis in  original.) Applicant  answered  the  question,  “No.” This
was a false answer to a relevant question about Applicant’s criminal history involving the
use of alcohol.
3.b. Section 24 of the same questionnaire concerned  Applicant’s use  of alcohol.
One subpart asked, “Have you EVER been ordered, advised, or asked to seek counseling
or  treatment  as  a  result  of  your  use  of  alcohol?”  (Emphasis  in  original.)  Applicant
answered  the  question,  “No,”  This  was  a  false  answer  to  a  relevant  question  about
Applicant’s alcohol-treatment history.
Applicant stated  in  his  Answer, “I did not understand the questions clearly, thus
resulting in my answering the questions incorrectly.”
",False
"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  admitted  the  factual  allegations  in
Subparagraphs 1.a.~1.c. and 2.a. of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual
in  Subparagraphs  1.d.  and  1.e.  Applicant  also  provided  additional
allegations
information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant  is  27  years  old,  unmarried,  and  has  no  children.  (Item  3  at  pages  7,
and 17~18.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption  & Guideline  J:  Criminal Conduct
1.a.  and  2.a.  Applicant admits that in November of 2014, he was arrested for and
pled guilty to being a Minor in Possession of Alcohol.
1.b.  and  2.a.  Applicant admits that in April of  2017, he was, in part, arrested for

1.d.  Applicant  denies  that,  from  September  2018  to  March  2019,  he  received
treatment  for  a  condition  diagnosed  as  Alcohol  Use  Disorder.  However,  this  is
contradicted  by  the  “Completion  Summary”  from  an  “Impaired  Driver  Program,”  dated
March  25,  2019,  which  states  Applicant’s  “Current  Diagnosis:  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,
mild, in early remission.” (Item 8 at pages 1~2.)
1.e. Applicant denies that he continued to consume alcohol, notwithstanding his
treatment  noted  in  subparagraph  1.d.,  above.  However,  this  is  contradicted  by
Applicant’s  response  to  interrogatories,  dated  November  12,  2020,  wherein  Applicant
admits  he  consumed  “2~3”  beers  on  September  29,  2020,  about  two  weeks  prior  to
answering the interrogatories. (Item 4.)

Alcohol Consumption and Criminal  Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  in  March  2020,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use
disorder, moderate. Applicant agreed the diagnosis was accurate in March 2020. (Tr. 21)
Applicant  felt  stress  at  work  from  interactions  with  coworkers  and  due  to  extensive
mission-related  travel.  (Tr.  24-25)  He  left  defense-related  employment  in  March  2016
because his branch of the company was being sold. (Tr. 26) He had been using alcohol
to help him cope with the stresses of his employment. (Tr. 28) He made extensive efforts
to ensure his alcohol consumption did not adversely affect his employment. (Tr. 28) He
was unemployed from March 2016 to November 2017. (Tr. 27) After November 2017, he
worked  part time  for several retail  entities for  about  12  to  25  hours a  week. (Tr. 30, 34,
36)  He  also  worked   at  several  other  part-time   endeavors  unrelated   to   his  previous
defense  employment.  (Tr. 31,  35) During  2020, he  worked  for a  defense  contractor for  six
months  in  his specialty, and  then  he  was unable to  work because  the  security  levels for
his employment were increased. (Tr. 32-33)
Applicant has a family history of excessive alcohol consumption and mental health
disorders. (Tr. 37) He acknowledged a personal predisposition to these issues. (Tr. 38)
Applicant  first  consumed  alcohol  at  age  11.  (Tr.  38)  He  consumed  alcohol  in
college, and drank more regularly after college. (Tr. 38) He estimated that after college
he  consumed  about  six  beers  a  week.  (Tr.  38)  After  he  started  his  defense-related
employment and was traveling, he drank four to six beers a day. (Tr. 39)
In the 2010 to 2011 period, the volume of Applicant’s alcohol consumption peaked.
(Tr.  74)  Around  2010,  while  Applicant  was  on  mission-related  travel,  he  consumed
sufficient alcohol for an alcohol blackout. (Tr. 59-62) He did not remember how he went
from  the bar  where  he was  drinking  to  his hotel room. (Tr. 59) He believed  one of  his
Marine Corps companions at the bar drove him to his hotel. (Tr. 60) He missed the class
he was supposed to attend the next day. (Tr. 59-61)
In 2011, Applicant was consuming alcohol when he erroneously believed a bottle
in his freezer contained vodka. He consumed about six ounces of methanol that he was
storing in his freezer to use to maintain his vehicle. (Tr. 55-56) He called poison control
and  an  ambulance  took  him  to  the  emergency  room.  (Tr.  56)  He  was  hospitalized
overnight. (Tr. 57)
In 2015, Applicant was consuming alcohol and he slipped off of the couch, and cut
his toe on a knife that was on the floor. (Tr. 62) He received care at an urgent care clinic.
(Tr. 62) The incidents in 2011 and 2015 were the only alcohol-related incidents after which
he received medical care. (Tr. 63)

alarm went off; he awoke; and he walked back to his residence. (Tr. 58) He did not suffer
frostbite or other cold-related injury.
After  he  left  his  defense-related  employment  in  2016,  he  increased  his  alcohol

milliliters of  alcohol (tequila  or gin)  on  more  than one  day during a week.  (Tr. 40)  The
frequency of his alcohol consumption peaked in 2017, and later in 2017, he reduced his
alcohol consumption. (Tr. 43-44, 74) In 2017, he hid bottles around his residence, and
consumed  alcohol  in  the  middle  of  the  night.  (Tr.  44)  Applicant  hid  his  alcohol
consumption from his cohabitant by consuming alcohol outside of her presence, such as
when she was at work. (Tr. 29-30) He described himself as having “extreme competency
in  being  a  functioning  drunk.”  (Tr.  30)  His  alcohol  consumption  when  off  duty  did  not
adversely affect his performance at work. In 2017, he began therapy. (Tr. 43, 45, 64) In
March 2018, he broke up with his cohabitant. (Tr. 64)
Applicant  attended  individual  therapy  and  group  counseling  from  2018  to  2020.
(Tr. 64) He attended about 15 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (Tr. 72) His therapist
met with him on a weekly basis for 50-minute sessions which focused on treatment of his
anxiety and replacement of alcohol as a coping mechanism with more constructive means
of coping with stress. (Tr. 65-66) In late 2018, he began 105-minute weekly group therapy
sessions, and he limited his alcohol consumption to three to four beers for each drinking
session. (Tr. 45,  66) In  March 2020, he stopped meeting with  a  therapist  because  the
COVID-19  pandemic  security  protocols  for  video  teleconferencing  were  not  adequate.
(Tr. 67) His therapist did not provide a written diagnosis or prognosis. (Tr. 67) Applicant
was never explicitly told that he should abstain from alcohol consumption; however, he
acknowledged that during group sessions the message was that it was best to completely
abstain from alcohol consumption. (Tr. 68-70)
Applicant’s current level of alcohol consumption  is “almost zero.” (Tr. 46) He did
not drink any alcohol for about eight months in 2021. Then, during one three-day weekend
about one month before his hearing while visiting family, he drank nine beers. (Tr. 47, 54)
This was the most alcohol he consumed in the previous year. (Tr. 47) He acknowledge
that after consuming one drink, inhibitions are somewhat relaxed, and the next drink is
more of a possibility. (Tr. 75-76) He is confident that he is able to control the amount of
alcohol he consumes. (Tr. 71-72) He lives in a drug and alcohol free community. (Tr. 73)
On March 5, 2020, a psychologist, Dr. B, evaluated Applicant, and she diagnosed
alcohol use disorder (moderate). (GE 2 at 6) Dr. B said:
Given   [Applicant’s]  drinking   habits,  his  family   history   of   substance   abuse
and  mental health  conditions,  as well  as  [Personality  Assessment Inventory
(PAI)]  results pointing  to  significant alcohol-related  problems and  variable
mood, there  is reason  for concern. These  factors, coupled  with  his history
of   alcohol-related   incidents   and   lack  of   long   term   plans  to   abstain  from
alcohol, raise questions about his judgment.
*  *  *
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the risk of future alcohol-related incidents
seems  moderate,  and  [Applicant’s] prognosis  appears guarded. Although
[Applicant] reported that he had been consistent with individual and group
therapy, and he has gained insight into himself and his drinking, a medical
opinion  could  not  be  obtained  and  during  the  investigatory  process,  he
consistently conveyed a lack of confidence in his ability to avoid relapse in
the face of future stressors. As such, his diagnosis could pose a risk to his
judgment,  reliability  or  trustworthiness  concerning  classified  information.
(GE at 6) (emphasis added)
At the time of his March 2020 evaluation, Applicant had been sober for two months, and
he was concerned about “reversion into the past behaviors and activities.” (Tr. 50) After
his March 2020 evaluation, he ended his  alcohol-related therapies; nevertheless, he is
now comfortable with his current state of limited to almost zero alcohol use. (Tr. 50)
Applicant recognized that after receiving the March 2020 evaluation he would have
a  better  change  of  approval  of  his  access  to  classified  information  if  he  stopped
consuming alcohol. (Tr. 76-77) However, he decided to continue his alcohol consumption
because complete abstinence from alcohol as not his goal or intention. (Tr. 77) He did not
want to stop consuming alcohol because of his security clearance. (Tr. 77) He rationalized
that the reason for ending his alcohol consumption should be because of  his personal
goals and not because of security concerns related to his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 77)
Applicant  never  drives  after  consuming  alcohol.  (Tr.  51)  He  has  consumed
sufficient alcohol over the last three years to be intoxicated three or four times. (Tr.  51)
The most alcohol he consumed in the previous three years was one mixed drink and five
beers in November 2020, when his father passed away. (Tr. 48)

Applicant provided statements from four character witnesses. (AE A-AE D)
The general sense of his character statements is that he is a model employee, who
is mature, professional, empathetic, punctual, helpful, trustworthy, responsible, and
reliable. Two statements also described an improvement in his weight, health, and
general wellbeing in the last few years.

"Applicant is a  44-year-old laborer, employed by a defense contractor  since July
2019. He is also self-employed as an independent contractor as an executive protection
(bodyguard)  service  provider  since  2014.  He  was  previously  employed  in  an  armed
security  position  from  January  to  July  2019;  agent-in-charge  of  special  events/field
training officer/site lead from February 2018 to August 2018; executive protection officer
from  June  2017  to  July  2019  for  two  other  companies;  VIP  security  host  lead  from
December  2011  to  October  2014;  and  security  supervisor  from  October  2009  to
December  2011.  Applicant  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  2004.  He  was  previously
married in 2016 and divorced in November 2018.  He remarried in February 2022, and
has no children. He has never held a security clearance.
The original SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with
varying frequency from about July 1993 to about January 2019; and he used cocaine with
varying frequency from about February 2008 to about January 2019. Under Guideline G,
the  SOR  alleges  Applicant  was  arrested  in  another  state,  in  about  December  2004,
charged and convicted of DUI; and he was arrested in about August 2017 and charged
with DUI and open container of alcohol in a vehicle. Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-
alleges the previous SOR allegations, and that he was arrested in about March 2015 and
charged with trespassing, a charge in which he pleaded guilty; and in September 2016,
he committed domestic battery against his former spouse. This allegation was amended
to  allege  that  his  former  spouse  accused  him  of  domestic  battery  on  at  least  three
occasions in July, August, and September 2016. In addition, the amended SOR added
allegations new ¶ 4.a, under Guideline E, cross-alleging SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b regarding
marijuana  and  cocaine  use;  ¶¶  2.b  alleging  the  2017  DUI  charge,  and  ¶¶  3.b  and  3.c
alleging the trespassing conviction and domestic battery accusations. Applicant admitted
to all of the original SOR allegations except SOR ¶ 3.c (alleging domestic battery against
his former spouse), and generally objected to the amended SOR allegations.
Applicant  admitted  to  using  marijuana  recreationally  and  regularly,  usually  on
weekends  and  when  socializing,  from  1993  to  2019.  He  both  purchased  it  and  it  was
provided by friends. He purchased marijuana approximately twice per month from about
1998 to about 2016, and approximately once per month from about 2016 to 2019. Of note,
he  denied  purchasing  marijuana  when  interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in
December 2019. He also declared the accuracy of his personal subject interview (PSI)
summary in a January 2021, interrogatory response. (GE 2)
Applicant  testified  that  he  used  cocaine  recreationally  about  “once  every  six
months,”  from  about  2008  to  January 2019,  usually  at  social  gatherings.  However,  he
also  inconsistently  stated  in  testimony  that  he  only  used  cocaine  three  to  four  times.
However,  in  his  PSI,  he  stated  he  used  cocaine  with  his  former  spouse  “weekly  to
quarterly” during social settings at nightclubs. (GE 2) During this period of illegal drug use,
he worked in several security and executive protection positions, purchased firearms in
2009, 2010, and 2020, and held a concealed firearm permit (CFP) for executive protection
and personal safety, issued by his current state of residence in 2013 and renewed it in
2018. It remains valid until 2023. The CFP application (Rev 8/19) states:
You   are  not  eligible   to   carry   a   Concealed   Firearm   Permit  if   any   of   the
following   apply:  .  .  .   (6)  You   have   habitually   used   intoxicating   liquor  or  a
controlled  substance  to  the  extent that  your normal faculties are impaired,
including DUI convictions within five previous years and Medical Marijuana
Patients. (AE B)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed his use of marijuana “occurred on my
personal  time.”  However,  he  admitted  that  in  2006,  he  was  working  security  and
bodyguard jobs in nightclubs and “on the entertainment scene” and “was exposed to the
good and the bad that went along with it.” He stated that he initially rejected cocaine that
was  offered  to  him,  but  eventually  gave  in  and  used  it  “to  understand  the  effects  and
correlate it with the behaviors [he] experienced as a security/bodyguard.” At times it was
“offered to [him] from someone [he] or a client of [his] was interacting with.”
Applicant  testified  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  and  cocaine  on  or  about
January 1, 2019, partly as a result of a new year’s resolution. Coincidentally, he began
working  in  an  armed  security  position  in  January  2019  that  required  obtaining  a  state
private investigator license from a state licensing board to carry a firearm, and he worked
armed security for several medical marijuana dispensaries as well as jewelry and trade
shows.  He  also  applied  for  a  security  clearance  in  August  2019.  In  a  post-hearing
submission,  Applicant  provided  a  signed  notice  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement and substance misuse. He also stated he has never failed an employment,
pre-screening, or random drug test, and that he has disassociated from acquaintances
with whom he used drugs in the past. (AE B)
In December 2004, Applicant was arrested in another state for DUI at an impaired
driving  checkpoint.  He  was  convicted  in  2005,  placed  on  probation,  and  required  to
complete alcohol-related classes. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he was driving
home from  a work-related  holiday  party.  He  said  he  “gained  valuable  insight from  that
experience.”
In 2017, Applicant was again arrested for DUI and open container of alcohol after
he drove into a tree after returning from a bachelor party at 5 a.m. He was the “designated
driver” for his friends during the evening. He testified that he had a “shot or two” during
the evening, but denied that alcohol contributed to the accident. Of note, in his answer to
the SOR, he admitted to  having “a  drink a  couple drinks  [sic]  with  dinner”  at  a  casino.
When the police found an open container and a closed beer in his armrest, he stated they
were placed there without his knowledge. He said he “dozed off a mile, or less, from home
assumedly because [he] was in familiar surroundings and [his] body was  comfortable.”
He was given a field sobriety test at the scene but he refused a breathalyzer test because
he “felt their demeanor and attitude switch towards [him] and [he] no longer trusted the
process.” (Ans.) He was arrested for DUI and open container. The police suspected drunk
driving and obtained a warrant to take blood samples, but it was hours after the accident.
Applicant stated that his subsequent blood tests showed his blood alcohol level was under
the legal limit. He was not ultimately charged with drunk driving, but was found guilty of
failure to maintain a lane and having an open container of alcohol in his vehicle.
In  2015,  Applicant  was  charged  with  trespassing.  He  testified  that  he  was  at  a
casino  when  he  had  a  vocal  disagreement  with  a  card  dealer  and  management  over
errors he perceived were committed by the table dealer. Of note, he did not mention his
disagreement  with  the  dealer  during  his  PSI,  rather  he  stated  he  was  drinking  while
playing a table game “without incident” when the table game manager asked him to stop
playing and leave. He believed he was being treated unfairly and disrespected, and he
refused to leave the casino even though the manager and security officials told him they
would call the police. He believed it was a “peaceful protest” for the way in which he was
treated. Applicant was arrested, offered a deal to plead no contest, and was convicted of
trespass. In his answer to the SOR, he claimed the incident was a result of racism and
other  factors,  was  asked  “one  last  time  to  leave  or  be  arrested,”  and  that  he  was
“comfortable protesting and standing up for what [he] believed was right.” He noted that
since  then,  he  has  “meditated  and  looked  back  on  the  situation  and  understands  that
there are some things that are out of [his] control and it is better to remove [himself] from
those situations than to add fuel to the fire.”
Applicant married his former spouse in May 2016, but they lived together before
marrying. He moved out in October 2016, and their divorce was final in December 2016.
In  a  September  2016  police  report  to  her  local  police  department,  Applicant’s  former
spouse accused him of choking her and shaking her in July 2016 while they were at his
mother’s home in another state. She also accused him of pulling her hair and choking her
during  an  argument  in  September  2016,  while  they  were  again  visiting  his  family  in
another  state.  She  did  not  report  the  July  incident  because  they  were  at  his  mother’s
home  in  another  state,  and  that  she  thought  he  would  change.  She  reported  the
September incident about four days after it occurred, apparently after returning to their
state  of  residence.  No  arrest  was  made  because  the  incidents  occurred  in  another
jurisdiction.
In  the  same  police  report,  Applicant’s former spouse  also  alleged  an  incident  in
August  2016,  where  they  were  drinking  at  a  bar when  he  began  arguing  with  her  and
made a scene. She left the bar and Applicant followed. He blocked her from entering their
vehicle and continued arguing. He became angry and pulled her hair and yelled without
letting it go. At some point, he drew his firearm, pointed it at himself, and yelled “what do
you  want me  to  do, blow  my brains out”?  She  did not report the  incident at the  time  it
occurred because she thought he would change.  Applicant admitted drinking that night
and taking out his firearm and threatening to kill himself, but denied pulling her hair. He
also denied the alleged strangling incident in September 2016, and said he never had a
physical encounter with her except “face-to-face encounters.”
Applicant’s  current wife’s cousin and his supervisor testified on  his behalf. They
generally  attested  to  his  reliability  and  good character,  but  his  wife’s  cousin,  a  military
member that has known him for three years, was unaware of any issues with alcohol or
drugs.  Neither were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant  also submitted  character
letters from  co-worker  and  a  training director/apprentice  coordinator. Both  attest  to  his
work ethic, positive attitude, reliability, accountability, and willingness to take on greater
responsibilities  and  to  teach  new  apprentices,  but  neither  mentioned  specific  SOR
allegations. Additionally, Applicant’s current spouse wrote a strong, supportive letter on
his behalf, attesting to his judgment, kindness, reliability, and compassion. Applicant also
noted that after his divorce in 2016, he enrolled in personal counseling with a licensed
therapist  to  address  his  emotional  and  mental  concerns.  No  records  of  diagnosis  or
treatment were submitted from these counseling sessions.

"Applicant  is   48   years   old.   She   was  married   from   2014   until  her   divorce  was
finalized  in July  2019, and  she  has no  children. She  graduated  from  college  in 1995, and
received  a  master’s degree  in 2018. Applicant  has worked  for her current employer since
July  2001, and  in February  2020, she  was promoted  to  a  senior level manager. (Items 1-
4)
Applicant started consuming alcohol when she was 16.  In 2011, she underwent
gastric bypass surgery. As a result of the surgery, her body processed alcohol differently,
and she also started consuming it in larger quantities. In subsequent years, her unhappy
marriage and the stress of graduate school contributed to her desire to consume more
alcohol. (Items 1-6)
In late 2015, Applicant was referred by her primary care physician to a psychiatrist
specializing  in  geriatric  psychiatry  and  addiction  medicine  “to  determine  if  medication
could assist with  this behavioral issue”. Starting on December 16, 2015, Applicant met
with Dr. X weekly for 1 month. He diagnosed her with, Adjustment Disorder with Mixed
Anxiety  and  Depressed  Mood  (Active);  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,  Severe  (Active);  and
Insomnia Due to a Medical Condition (Active). Dr. X prescribed her with Revia and Vivitrol,
which are used to prevent alcohol and drug relapses and Desyrel, an antidepressant. He
recommended that she attend 90 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings in 90 days and
referred her to a therapist. Their meetings decreased to monthly and then every  six to
eight weeks.
Applicant provided copies of the Dr. X’s treatment records in response to DOHA’s
interrogatory request. For periods of time between December 2015 and March 13, 2020
(the  most  recent  record  provided),  she  claimed  to  be  sober,  but  was  often  combining
alcohol with her alcohol-cessation medication. She drank as much as a box of wine at
night, and frequently she consumed two bottles of wine a night. Applicant continued to
consume  alcohol  against  her  physician’s  advice  to  cope  with  the  stress  of  her  job,
graduate school, and her unhappy marriage. She admitted to binge drinking due to stress;
binge drinking while on medication; binge drinking over the holidays; and an unwillingness
to  go  to  AA  meetings.  Additionally,  it  was  noted that  because  she worked  from  home,
prior to the COVID 19 pandemic, Applicant’s alcohol consumption blended from day into
evening; she sometimes drank in the morning; and she suffered from blackouts.  (Item 6)
While Applicant was being treated by Dr. X, her drinking escalated to the point that
she voluntarily sought inpatient treatment. At the time that she was admitted to Facility
A’s  detox  unit  on  June  24,  2017,  she  was  consuming  two  bottles  of  wine  nightly.  She
sought  treatment,  in  part,  because  the  medication  she  had  been  prescribed,  including
double doses of Antabuse, was not working. At Facility A she was initially diagnosed with
Alcohol  Dependence,  and  it  was  noted  in  her  treatment  records  that  her  potential  for
relapse was “at a high risk without residential treatment for Addiction.”
Upon  her  discharge  from  Facility  A  on  July  5,  2017,  the  treating  health  care
provider recommended that Applicant avoid alcohol and all addictive mood-altering drugs;
maintain  abstinence;  continued  integration  of  12-step  recovery;  and  obtain  a  sponsor
within two weeks of discharge. Additionally, she had a discharge intake appointment with
a psychologist and was enrolled in a continued connection program with a referral to AA.
Her  diagnosis  at  discharge  was,  in  part,  Alcohol  Dependence  with  withdrawal,
uncomplicated and Alcoholic liver disease, unspecified. (Item 5)
There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  that  Applicant  complied  with  Facility  A’s
treatment recommendations  to attend AA meetings. She admitted to Dr. X on July 29,
2017,  at  her  appointment  following  her  release  from  Facility  A,  that  despite  receiving
some follow-up psychological treatment  upon leaving Facility A, she had relapsed and
consumed alcohol. Applicant’s extensive  treatment records from Dr. X indicate that she
continued to consume alcohol up until March 13, 2020 (the most recent record provided)
despite his ongoing recommendation that she refrain from consumption, seek therapy,
and  attend  AA  meetings.  As  of  March  13,  2020,  Dr.  X’s  diagnosis  was,  Persistent
Depressive Disorder with intermittent major depressive depression (Active); Alcohol Use
Disorder, Moderate (Active); and Insomnia Due to Medical Condition. (Items 5-6)
During Applicant’s July 15, 2019 personal subject interview, she admitted that she
was continuing to consume six to eight cans of beer nightly, but she believed that once
her divorce was finalized her alcohol consumption would decrease. In her April 20, 2020
response to DOHA’s interrogatory request, she provided updated information regarding
her consumption of alcohol. At that time, she was consuming six to seven 12 ounce cans
of hard seltzers every night of the week, and she had last consumed alcohol the night
before she completed her response. (Item 4)
In her December 2020 response to the SOR, Applicant asserted that her drinking
had  improved  after  she  started  attending  therapy  in  2020.  However,  she  provided  no
additional  details  as  to  how  frequently  she  attended  therapy,  nor  did  she  provide  an
explanation as to why she had not previously attended therapy, as recommended to her
since 2015. She did not provide supporting documentation from her therapist in her SOR
response, nor did she provide a response to the FORM. Additionally, she admitted that
the longest period of sobriety that she was able to maintain was six weeks, but did not
provide details as to when this period occurred. She also claimed that she no longer drank
daily and described her drinking as a “habit” that she uses as a “wind down period from
a busy day.” (Items 1, 6)
In  her  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  described  herself  as  “a  very  highly
functioning person” and denied that her alcohol-related issues raised concerns regarding
her reliability and trustworthiness. However, she did admit that she drinks “too much, and
it impacts [her] health and cognitive ability.” She provided documentation related to her
work  performance,  reflecting  that  she  is  a  valued  employee  who  consistently  exceeds
expectations in her performance ratings. (Item 1)

"Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  eligibility  for  access  to
classified  information  for  his  job  as  a  senior  software  engineer  for  a  company  in  the
defense  industry.  He  has  worked  as  a  software  engineer  since  2015.  His  educational
background includes a bachelor’s degree awarded in 2015. He has not married and has
no children.
The  SOR  alleges  a  history  of  excessive  alcohol  consumption.  The  allegations
appear  to  be  based  on  information  Applicant  self-reported  in  his  security  clearance
application and during his background investigation. (Exhibits 3 and 4) The information
he  provided  during  his  2021  background  investigation  is  most  informative  and  is
summarized below.
Applicant  reported  during  the  background  investigation  that  he  had  a  couple  of
drinks while a high-school student, but mainly began using alcohol at about age 21. He
typically would have six drinks per occasion every couple of weeks. In about June 2014
his cousin passed away due to muscular dystrophy. The death hit Applicant hard. As  a
result,  he  increased  his  consumption  to  six  beers  or  liquor  drinks  daily  to  the  point
where he became intoxicated. He continued at that level until about two or three years
ago. Since then to present he drinks about ten beers or liquor drinks daily to the point of
intoxication. He drinks at home alone. He stated that his use of alcohol has progressed
to  the  point  of  addiction  and  habit.  He  has  no  intention  to  decrease  or  modify  his
drinking  or  to  obtain  treatment  in  the  future.  He  stated  that  he  previously  sought
treatment  during  2016-2017  per  the  advice  of  his family.  He  stated  that  he  received  a
diagnosis  of  alcohol  dependency.  He  stopped  attending  the  treatment  when  his
therapist  or  counselor  left  the  organization.  He  also  attended  a  meeting  of  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA)  in  January  2019  but  did  not  return  for  additional  meetings.  He  does
not believe his use of alcohol has impacted his ability to perform at work, but mentioned
that it has made him more anti-social.
Turning  next  to  the  matters  in  the  SOR,  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  is  that
Applicant has consumed alcohol, at time in excess and to the point of intoxication, since
about June 2014 to at least May 2020. The allegation is established by the information
Applicant self-reported in his SF 86 and during his background investigation.
The  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  that  Applicant  consumes  alcohol  to  the  point  of
intoxication  daily.  The  allegation  is  established  by  the  information  Applicant  self-
reported in his SF 86 and during his background investigation. In particular, he reported
during the background investigation that he drinks about ten beers or liquor drinks daily
to the point of intoxication.
The  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  is  that  Applicant  received  “treatment”  at  a  specific
“AA”  [city,  state],  from  about  January  2019  to  about  January  2019.  This  allegation  is
misplaced because it  is based on a misreading or misunderstanding of his attendance
at a single AA meeting in January 2019. Attendance at a single AA meeting, which is a
form of self-help and peer support group, does not constitute treatment.
The  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  is  that  Applicant  received  alcohol  treatment  from
about  September  2016  to  about  February  2017,  and  received  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol
dependence. This allegation is established by the information Applicant self-reported in
his SF 86 and during his background investigation.
The allegation in SOR ¶ 1.e is that Applicant has continued to consume alcohol
notwithstanding the diagnosis of alcohol dependence mentioned above. This allegation
is  established  by  the  information  Applicant  self-reported  in  his  SF  86  and  during  his
background investigation.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
1  Department  of  the  Navy   v.  Egan,  484   U.S.  518,  528   (1988)   (“it  should  be   obvious   that  no   one   has   a
‘right’  to a security  clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no
right to a security clearance).
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline G for alcohol consumption, the suitability of an applicant may be
questioned  or  put  into  doubt  because,  as  set  forth  in  AG  ¶  21,  “excessive  alcohol
consumption  often  leads  to  the  exercise  of  questionable  judgment  or  the  failure  to
control  impulses,  and  it  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.”
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying
condition as most pertinent:
AG  ¶   22(c)   habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of
impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with
alcohol use disorder.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  lengthy  history  of
excessive  consumption  of  alcohol  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under
Guideline G. The disqualifying condition noted above applies here. Note, I did not apply
the  disqualifying  conditions  at  AG  ¶  22(d)  and  AG  ¶  22(f),  as  argued  by  Department
Counsel,  because  the  evidence  is  not  sufficient  to  establish  the  qualifications  of  the
person who made the diagnosis. (Exhibits 3 and 4) I also considered all the mitigating
conditions under AG ¶ 23, and conclude none apply in Applicant’s favor.

6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15
The  key facts are not in  dispute.  Applicant  habitually drinks  to excess. Whether
it’s  called  binge  drinking,  heavy  drinking,  etc.,  he  is  drinking  excessively  by  any
reasonable  measure.  This  conclusion  is  established  by  the  frequency  (daily)  and
amount (ten beers or drinks) of alcohol he consumes. Even more worrisome is that he
does  not  appear  to  be  interested  or  motivated  to  abstain  from  or  modify  his  use  of
alcohol.
Applicant  stated  that  his initial trigger for  increased  use of  alcohol goes  back to
June  2014,  when  a  cousin  passed  away  due  to  muscular  dystrophy.  I  certainly  have
empathy  for  Applicant.  I  had  a  great  friend  during  childhood  who  was  inflicted  with
muscular  dystrophy.  I  served  as  a  pallbearer  for  his  funeral.  My  friend’s  passing  at
about age 19 was tough to take. But I came realize  that my friend would have wanted
me to get on with things and live my life. My hope here is that Applicant—who is still a
young man at age 29—comes to realize there is a better way to live his life. Likewise, I
strongly encourage Applicant to obtain qualified professional help. Given his excessive
drinking  and  past  diagnosis  of  alcohol  dependence,  it  is  highly  likely  Applicant  would
benefit from a rigorous alcohol-treatment program, such as inpatient treatment followed
by  appropriate  aftercare.  But  until  he  does  so  and  can  show  substantial  evidence  of
reform and rehabilitation, he will continue to be an unsuitable candidate for eligibility for
access to classified information.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent standard, I have  doubts and  concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good   judgment,  and   ability   to   protect
classified   or  sensitive   information.   In   reaching   this  conclusion,  I  weighed   the   evidence
as  a   whole  and   considered   if   the   favorable  evidence   outweighed   the   unfavorable
evidence  or  vice versa. I also considered  the  whole-person  concept. I conclude  that he

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR
(SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d,  and  the  cross  allegation,  SOR  ¶  2.a)  with  brief  explanations.  His
admissions  and explanations  are  included  in  the findings  of  fact. After a thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since December 2017. He was granted a DOD security clearance
in  January  2019.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2002  and  a  master’s  degree  in
2005. He has never been married and has no children. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  alcohol-related  criminal  offenses,  alleged  under
Guideline G and cross-alleged under Guideline J. In about April 1998, he was charged
with  public  intoxication  in  State  A  and  fined.  In  September  1998,  he  sought  in-patient
alcohol counseling because he believed that he might be drinking too much. He ceased
this  counseling  after  about  three  days  because  he  decided  that  he  did  not  have  a
problem with alcohol after hearing about the other attendees’ issues. Applicant believes
that his record with respect to this charge of public intoxication has been expunged from
his criminal record. (Items 3-5; AE AA, BB, EE; Enclosure 3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2000  in  State  A  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI). He spent the night in jail. As a result of this DUI, he had to complete 40
hours  of  community  service,  a  DUI  course,  and  have  an  ignition  interlock  device
installed  on  his  car.  He  received  a  two-year  deferred  sentence.  He  believes  that  his
2000  DUI  has  been  expunged  from  his  record.  As  a  result  of  this  DUI,  Applicant
reduced his drinking to about two beers at a time, once every two months.  (Items 3, 5;
AE EE; Enclosure 3)
Applicant was arrested again in July 2002 in State A and charged with DUI after
a  night  out  with  friends.  He  again  spent  the  night  in  jail.  Applicant  pleaded  guilty.  He
received  a  two-year  deferred  sentence,  had  an  ignition  interlock  device  placed  on  his
vehicle, and attended a DUI school for 12 hours. He completed all the requirements of
his  deferred  sentence.  After  this  DUI,  Applicant  reduced  his  drinking  to  no  more  than
two  or  three  beers  on  any  occasion,  only  drank  twice  per  year,  and  never  drove  a
vehicle after he consumed alcohol. (Items 3, 5, 6; AE EE; Enclosure 3)
In  approximately  2011,  Applicant  decided  that  he  wanted  to  work  for  the
government  or  a  government  contractor.  He  began  attending  Alcoholics  Anonymous
(AA) meetings in an effort to mitigate his alcohol issues and related legal problems. He
attended AA meetings from 2011 until 2016. His  attendance was  initially fairly regular,
but gradually decreased until he stopped attending in 2016. He completed all 12 steps
of  AA  at  some  point  between  2014  and  2016,  while  having  regular  contact  with  his
sponsor. As part of a plan to improve his health, he abstained from alcohol for over four
years. He resumed drinking in the summer of 2016, and consumed one to three beers
once per month until the end of 2016. From 2017 until September 2019, he drank about
one to three servings of alcohol about six times per year. (Items 3-5; AE G; Enclosure 3)
In October 2019, Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with Aggravated
DUI after a night out with friends. His blood alcohol content was measured at either .16
or .18, after he had been arrested and taken to jail. Applicant pleaded nolo contendere
to  a  lesser  charge  of  non-aggravated  DUI,  for  which  he  received  a  deferred  one-year
sentence  with  unsupervised  probation,  50  hours  of  community  service,  and  about
$1,700  in  fines.  He  was  also  ordered  to  install  an  ignition  interlock  system  on  his
vehicle. Applicant completed all of his post-sentencing requirements and paid all of his
fines. He completed a 24-hour alcohol and drug abuse course, a victim input panel, and
a  six-week  substance  abuse  group  through  State  A.  (Items  3,  4,  5,  7;  AE  EE,  DD;
Enclosure 3)
Applicant resumed  attending  AA  meetings again in October 2019,  after his 2019
DUI arrest.  He  had   a   “small” glass of champagne  on   December   31, 2019, New   Years’
Eve.  In  connection  with  his resumed  AA  participation, he  has again completed  the  12-
step  program  and  has received  his one, three, six, and  nine-month  sobriety  chips.  After
moving  to  Country  A  for his  job,  he  continued  attending  AA  meetings two  to  three  times
per  week  online   and   obtained   a   new   AA   sponsor,   who   is  a   citizen   and   resident   of
Country A. (Items 3, 5; AE G,  H,  EE; Enclosure 3)
In  a  written  statement  attached  to  his  October  2021  SOR  response  Applicant
committed  to  never  drinking  again.  He  claimed  that  no  one  had  ever  advised  him  or
recommended  to  him  that  he  should  fully  and  permanently  abstain  from  alcohol.
(Enclosure 3)
Applicant  submitted a Drug and  Alcohol Assessment, dated February 16,  2022,
from  an  individual  who  is  a  licensed  social  worker  and  licensed  chemical  dependency
counselor  III  (Clinical  Evaluator).  The  Clinical  Evaluator  reviewed  the  results  of
Applicant’s  drug  abuse  screening  test,  a  Michigan  alcohol  screening  test,  and  a
proprietary  mental  health  screening.  The  Clinical  Evaluator  opined  that,  despite
Applicant’s written  screenings providing  evidence  of  problem  alcohol use, “the  drinking
habits” Applicant “acknowledges are insignificant enough for alcohol abuse disorder ….”
(AE EE, FF)
Applicant  submitted  letters  from  friends,  acquaintances,  co-workers,  and  fellow
AA  participants  praising  him  for  his  reliability,  honesty,  responsibility,  trustworthiness,
dependability,  integrity,  and  charitable  work.  Some  of  the  authors  also  noted  his
commitment  to  sobriety  and  his  participation  in  AA.  He  submitted  documentation  of
numerous  cash  awards  his  employer  granted  him  in  2018,  2019,  and  2020.  (AE  A-J,
GG, HH)
Through  his  Personal  Representative,  Applicant  requested  that  I  consider
granting  him  a  conditional  clearance.  He  provided  several  suggestions  “to  ensure
monitoring and enforcement of the conditions.” (Applicant’s response to FORM)

"Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about July 2021. His current employer hired him when it was
awarded the government contract of his previous employer for whom he worked since
March  2018.  There  has  been  no  interruption  in  his  employment  with  a  defense
contractor since March 2018. He was granted an interim security clearance in 2018. He
has an associate’s degree. He has never been married and has no children. (Transcript
(Tr.) at 30-34; GE 1, 2, 19)
Applicant has a significant history of criminal offenses, including several alcohol-
related offenses. In about January 2008, he was charged with driving with a suspended
driver’s license after being pulled over for speeding. His driver’s license was suspended
because  he  had  let  his  insurance  coverage  lapse.  In  about  August  2008,  he  failed  to
appear  for  his  court  date  for  driving  on  a  suspended  license  and  was  charged  with
failure  to  appear.  In  September  2009,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  driving  on  a  suspended
license, speeding, and failure to appear and was  placed on probation before judgment
(PBJ).  He  completed about  three  to  six months  of  probation  successfully  and  paid  his
required  fines  and  court fees.  (Tr. at  34-36, Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;  GE  1,  2,  4,
19)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  December  2009  in  State  A  and  charged  with  driving
under  the  influence  (DUI),  after  driving  home  from  a  bar  despite  knowing  he  was
intoxicated. He had a .13 blood alcohol content (BAC) at the time of his arrest. He spent
the night in jail. As it was Applicant’s first DUI, these charges against him were dropped.
(Tr. at 36-37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 19)
About two months later, in February 2010, Applicant was arrested in State A and
charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). He had been drinking at a bar and decided
to drive home despite knowing that he was intoxicated. He had a .19 BAC at the time of
his arrest. He spent one or two nights in jail. In October 2010, he pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to 60 days in jail, all suspended. His driver’s license  was suspended  for six
months, and he had to  pay fines and complete 24 hours of  community service.  (Tr. at
37-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5, 19)
Applicant had enlisted in  the  U.S. Navy  in about February  2010. As a  result of his
February  2010  DWI, Applicant’s accession  to  the  Navy  was declined.1  (Tr. 31, 59;  GE  2,
3, 19)
In  May 2010, Applicant  was  charged with  driving  with  a  suspended license.  His
license  had  been  administratively  suspended  as  a  result  of  his  February  2010  DWI
charge.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  received  PBJ  as  a  result  of  this  charge.  (Tr.  at  41-43;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 5, 6, 19)
In November 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI and Failure to
Stop After Accident Involving Damage to Attended Vehicle/Property. Prior to his arrest,
Applicant  had been drinking alone at  home for three  to four hours and had  consumed
about  two  bottles  of  wine.  He  decided  to  drive  despite  knowing  he  was  impaired
because he had to go to work. On his way to work, he collided with a pick-up truck, left
the  scene  of  the  accident,  and  drove  the  additional  two  to  three  miles  to  work  at  a
restaurant where he was employed  as a bartender. While investigating the hit and run
involving  the  aforementioned  pick-up  truck,  the  police  determined  that  Applicant  was
responsible and arrested him at work. Applicant had a .21 BAC when he was arrested.
He pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced to 365 days in jail with all but 45
days  suspended,  probation  for  three  years,  and  two  months  of  alcohol  classes.  He
claimed  that  he  completed  all  the  requirements  of  his  sentence.  In  his  January  2018
subject interview (SI), he did not tell his investigator about the hit and run aspect of his
arrest.  He  only  discussed  a  version  of  events  involving  the  DWI  that  did  not  include
colliding with another vehicle. (Tr. at 43-49; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 7, 8,
19, 20)
Applicant  attended  court-ordered alcohol classes from  February 2013  until April
2013.  Prior  to  attending  these  court-ordered  classes,  he  voluntarily  began  attending
some  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings.  He  attended  AA  meetings  from  January
2013 until about July 2013. He completed a couple of the AA steps but did not have a
sponsor. (Tr. 57-58; GE 19)
In late June 2017, Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with intoxicated
endangerment. Applicant was  walking back to  the location where he  was  staying after
drinking  at  a  bar  for  seven  or  eight  hours.  A  bouncer  at  the  bar  where  Applicant  had
been drinking alerted the police that Applicant had too much to drink, so police  began
following him. Applicant tried to steal a bike that was locked to a bench and pushed it
over when he realized he could not take it. Police lost him for a couple of minutes, but
then relocated him when they saw him vomiting in a bush. When he noticed police were
following him, Applicant ran to evade them, but they apprehended him. Applicant spent
the  night  in  jail.  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  intoxicated  endangerment  in  August  2017.
(Tr. 49; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 9, 19, 21)
1  Any  adverse  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  such  as  Applicant’s  issues  with  joining  the  Navy,
cannot  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be  considered  when  assessing  Applicant’s
rehabilitation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and for the whole-person analysis.
In November 2017, Applicant was charged with Failure to Control Vehicle Speed
on  a  Highway  to  Avoid  Collision  after  he  was  involved  in  a  car  accident.  In  January
2018,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  this  charge  and  prepaid  a  fine.  The  vehicle  that  he  was
driving was  totaled as a  result of  this accident.  (Tr. 49-50,  52; Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 10)
In  March  2018,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driver  Using  Hands  to  Use  Hand-
Held  Telephone  while  Motor  Vehicle  was  in  Motion.  This  charge  resulted  from  his
involvement in an accident because he was looking at his mobile phone and rear-ended
another vehicle.  He pleaded  guilty and paid a fine.  (Tr.  49-52;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 11)
In  March  2020,  Applicant  was  cited  for speeding  when  he  was  caught  traveling
64  mph  in  a  55  mph  zone.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  paid  a  fine.  (Tr.  52-53;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 12)
Sometime in 2021, Applicant was cited for speeding after a speed camera caught
him exceeding the speed limit. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine online. (Tr. 53-54)
Applicant  admitted   that  his  drinking   has   caused   problems  with   his  family,  his
finances, and  his health.  Applicant has a  paternal history  of   kidney  disease. Beginning
when  he  was about  25  years  old  in 2012,  Applicant showed  symptoms of  chronic  kidney
disease.   As  early   as  January   2018,  he   recognized   that  his  alcohol  consumption   had
exacerbated  his kidney  disease.  However, he  continued  to  consume  alcohol to  excess,
acknowledging  that,  at  that time, he  was consuming  four to  five  drinks once  or twice per
month and  drinking to the point of intoxication about once every two months.  (Tr. 29, 55-
56; GE 2, 3, 19; AE B, C)
As a result of a referral by the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication
Facility  (DOD  CAF),  in  February  2021,  with  a  follow-up  in  June  2021,  Applicant
underwent a psychological evaluation by a licensed clinical psychologist (Psychologist).
The Psychologist was contracted by the DOD CAF. In order to make her psychological
evaluation,  the  Psychologist  reviewed  background  information  submitted  by  the  DOD
CAF,  the  results  of  a  clinical  interview,  testing  observations,  and  the  results  of  the
Personality Assessment Inventory. (Tr. 59; GE 2, 3)
Based  upon  these  measuring  tools,  the  Psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with
alcohol  use  disorder  (moderate-severe).  She  found  the  risk  of  future  alcohol-related
incidents to be moderate with a guarded prognosis. She noted her concern that, despite
all  of  the  adverse  effects  alcohol  has  had  on  him,  Applicant  continued  to  consume  it
without  undergoing  any  alcohol-related  treatment.  She  also  noted  that,  in  about  2019,
Applicant’s doctor recommended that he abstain from alcohol entirely. (Tr. 59; GE 2, 3)
Applicant claimed that, in the Fall of 2021, he turned over a new leaf and stopped
drinking. This decision was spurred partly by knowing that his kidneys were “basically all
the  way  gone,”  and  a  May  2021  medical  emergency  that  put  him  in  the  hospital  after
“throwing up 10 pints of blood” and nearly dying. He also credits his decision to change
his  lifestyle  on  a  subsequent  medical  issue  in  about  July  2021  when  his  right  lung
collapsed. He testified that he has not had a drink since Fall 2021, and that he plans to
continue to abstain from alcohol entirely. (Tr. 29, 55-56; GE 2, 3, 19; AE B, C)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  32  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately
23,400.  Many  of  these  delinquent  debts  are  medical  debts  resulting  from  Applicant’s
aforementioned  chronic  kidney  issues.  However,  Applicant  also  has  other  debts,  such
as a delinquent credit-card debt, a delinquent debt to State A, a delinquent student-loan
debt, and a delinquent telecommunications debt. Applicant attributed his financial issues
to  his  youth,  his  disorganization,  and  a  lack  of  income.  He  also  attributed  them  to  his
past and ongoing health conditions. He has been covered by health insurance through
his employer as of March 2018 at the latest. (TR. 63-83, 110-121; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 13-19; AE A-D)
The  $1,916  judgment  entered  in  2011  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  4.a  has  not  been
resolved. Applicant claimed that he has paid this debt through garnishments, however,
he did not provide any documentation establishing it was paid. He testified that he may
have had documentation showing the debt was paid at one time, but he no longer does.
(Tr. 63-65; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 13)
The $848 medical judgment entered in 2013 alleged in SOR ¶ 4.b has not been
resolved. Applicant believes that he paid this  debt because he has not heard from the
creditor  or  any  collection  agencies  about  the  debt.  However,  he  did  not  provide  any
documentation  establishing  that  it  was  paid.  (Tr.  65-68;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;
GE 14, 19)
The $2,461 judgment entered in 2017 in favor of State A alleged in ¶ 4.c has not
been  resolved.  Applicant  does  not  know  the  nature  of  this  debt.  He  presented  no
evidence  that  he  has  made  a  payment,  disputed  this  debt,  offered  or  negotiated  a
payment  agreement,  or  taken  any  significant  actions  to  resolve  this  debt.  (Tr.  68-70;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 16; AE C)
The $9,231 educational loan judgment entered in 2018 alleged in ¶ 4.d has not
been resolved. Applicant presented no evidence that he has made a payment, disputed
this debt, offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to
resolve this debt. (Tr. 70-71; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 15)
The  $119  telecommunications  debt  alleged  in  ¶  4.i  has  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  testified  that  he  paid  this  debt  sometime  in  2019  but  did  not  provide  any
documentation  establishing  it  was  paid.  The  debt  appears  on  Applicant’s  2018  credit
report but not  on  his 2021  credit  report.  (Tr. 76; Applicant’s  response  to  SOR; GE  17,
19)
The  remainder  of  Applicant’s  delinquent  debts  listed  in  the  SOR  are  medical
debts  (¶¶  4.e  through  4.h,  ¶¶  4.j  through  4.aa,  and  ¶¶  4.cc  through  4.gg).  Applicant
initially testified that he has paid only the debts listed in ¶¶ 4.e, 4.f, 4.h, 4.n, and 4.p. He
provided  documentation  establishing  that  the  debts  listed  in  ¶¶  4.e,  4.h,  and  4.p  were
paid in March and April 2022. The debts in ¶¶ 4.e, 4.h, and 4.p have been resolved. (Tr.
76-83; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 17-19; AE A, B)
Applicant  and  his mother  also testified  that they  believe  that most of  the  medical
debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶  4  have  been  paid.  Applicant  claimed  that he  could  not  match  up
his payment receipts  with  the  debts  listed  in  the  SOR because  creditors  combined  the
debts  into   one   statement.   He  was  unable   to   identify   which  documents  he   provided
corroborated  the  payments  he  alleged  he  made  on  the  remaining  SOR debts.  Many  of
Applicant’s  documents   relate   to   medical  services  that  were  provided   to   him   in   March
2021  and  later.  The  SOR debts listed  in  ¶¶  4.j through  4.aa  and  4.cc through  4.gg  are
all  contained  in  the  April 2018  credit report,  so  those  debts were incurred  prior to  March
2021.  As evidenced  by  information  in the  July  2021  credit report, the  SOR debts listed
in ¶¶  4.f  and  4.g  were also incurred  prior to  March 2021.  Any  of  Applicant’s documents
purporting   to   show   payments  for  medical  services  provided   to   him   after  March   2021
cannot  show   payments  for  the   debts  listed   in   ¶¶  4.f,   4.g,   4.j  through   4.o,  4.q   through
4.aa,  and  4.cc through  4.gg.  (Tr. 76-83,108-121; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  17-
19; AE A-D)
Applicant’s  documents  show  that  he  has  made  some  payments  on  medical
debts,  but  he  has  failed  to  show  that  he  has  made  payments  on  the  aforementioned
SOR  debts.  Applicant  largely  began  his  efforts  to  pay  these  medical  debts  at  the
beginning  of  2022.  Most  of  the funds  that  he  used  to  pay  these  debts  were  gifts  from
friends and family, often raised through his mother’s fundraising efforts in February and
March  2022.  As  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  corroborating  his  alleged
payments, the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 4.f, 4.g, 4.j through 4.aa and 4.cc through 4.gg are
unresolved. (Tr. 76-83,108-121; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 17-19; AE A-D)
Applicant testified that, at some time between 2005 and 2008, his aunt gave her
permission to add her name to his loan application from Bank A for a student loan. He
testified that  his aunt  told  him  she  would  be responsible for paying  back  this debt.  He
applied for this loan in his name and added his aunt as a co-signor. The debt became
delinquent by 2017 and Bank A filed a lawsuit against Applicant and his aunt to recover
the  balance. Applicant’s aunt  hired  an  attorney  and  defended  herself against Bank  A’s
lawsuit, claiming that Applicant had forged her signature to the loan application without
her permission. Bank A dismissed  Applicant’s aunt from  the  lawsuit with  prejudice,  but
obtained a judgment against Applicant as described in SOR ¶ 4.d.  (Tr. 70-76, 99-100;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 15, 17, 22, 23)
Applicant  claimed  that  his  aunt  changed  her  mind  about  their  agreement  with
respect to this loan years after he applied for it because she needed money.  Applicant
has  no  documentation  evidencing  his  aunt’s  consent  to  sign  her  name  to  loan
applications, but claimed that his mother is aware of the arrangement. Applicant’s aunt
passed away in late 2018. (Tr. 70-76, 99-100; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 15, 17,
22, 23)
In  order  to  assist  him  with  his  debts  and  investments,  Applicant  consulted  a
financial advisor beginning in February 2021 that his mother recommended. He did not
provide  evidence  as  to  what  his  financial  advisor  has  done  to  assist  him  with  his
finances. (Tr. 92-94)
As  a  result  of  his  chronic  kidney  disease,  Applicant  is  in  need  of  a  kidney
transplant  and  is  on  a  kidney  donor  list.  However,  he  claimed  that  in  order  to  be
approved for a transplant, he has to improve his credit-to-debt ratio. Applicant plans to
continue to pay down his delinquent debts in order to improve this ratio.  He also plans
to  continue  his  education  and  is  eight  to  ten  classes  shy  of  earning  his  bachelor’s
degree.  He  provided  a  transcript  from  his  school  showing  that  he  has  earned  good
grades. (Tr. 32-33, 80, 118-119; AE A-D)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and  1.b  without  further  comment.  She  neither  admitted  nor  denied  the  cross-alleged
allegations  under  Guideline  J,  so  I  find  that  she  has  denied  those  allegations.
Applicant’s admissions are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her current employer since  September  2017.  She earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  June
2017. She has never been married and has no children. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant  has  two  alcohol-related  criminal  offenses.  In  March  2018,  despite
knowing  that  her  employer  prohibited  alcohol  consumption  during  working  hours,  she
drank two mimosas at a restaurant while on her work lunch hour. She then drove back
to  her  place  of  employment. While  driving  back  to  work,  she  was  stopped  by  a  police
officer, arrested, and charged with driving under the influence (DUI). She spent the night
in jail. She hired an attorney to help her fight the charges because she thought she had
been  treated  unfairly  by  the  police  officer  because  he  would  not  verbally  divulge  her
blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  level.  After  requesting  an  analysis  of  her  blood  at  a
hospital,  it  was  determined  that  her  BAC  was  over  the  .08  legal  limit.  She  ultimately
pleaded  guilty  to  the  charge  of  Operating  a  Vehicle  with  Alcohol  Concentration
Equivalent to at Least .08 but Less than .15. She was sentenced to 60 days in jail with
56  suspended,  180  days  of  probation,  random  drug  and  alcohol  testing,  a  60-day
driver’s  license  suspension,  and  $605  in  fines.  She  completed  all  of  her  sentencing
requirements. She had not consumed alcohol during work hours before this incident and
has not done so since. (Items 1-5)
Prior  to  her  guilty  plea,  she  underwent  an  alcohol  and  drug  evaluation  from  an
individual  who  is  a  licensed  social  worker,  licensed  chemical  dependency  counselor,
and  certified  substance  abuse  counselor  (Clinical  Evaluator).  The  Clinical  Evaluator
reviewed the results of an in-person interview with Applicant, the results of Applicant’s
Substance  Abuse  Subtle  Screening  Inventory,  and  the  Behavior  and  Attitude  Drinking
and Driving Scale. Based upon these measurement tools, the Clinical Evaluator opined
that there is no probability of an alcohol abuse disorder and a low chance of her drinking
and  driving  in  the  future.  The  Clinical  Evaluator  recommended  that  Applicant  attend  a
12-hour substance abuse program, which Applicant completed in July 2018. (Items 3, 4)
Despite knowing that she should tell her employer about her March 2018 arrest,
Applicant did not do so. Initially, she did not tell her employer because she thought the
charges  might  be  dropped.  Once  she  was  convicted  of  the  DUI,  she  did  not  tell  her
employer because she forgot. (Item 4)
In May 2019, after drinking for several hours at a friend’s house, Applicant drove
home despite feeling intoxicated. On her way home, she hit  a curb  and  side-swiped  a
tree,  shattering  her  passenger  side  window.  She  resumed  driving  home  because  she
had  not damaged  anyone  else’s property  and her car was still drivable. Approximately
two  minutes later,  she  was stopped  by  a  police  officer for speeding  and  arrested  again
for DUI. She spent two nights in jail. (Items 1-5)
In  order to attempt  to  mitigate  any potential criminal penalties,  she had another
alcohol evaluation. This alcohol evaluation was completed verbally and the diagnosis is
unknown.  The  evaluator  recommended  that  she  attend  36  hours  of  group  therapy,
which she completed in August 2019. On January 13, 2020, she pleaded guilty to felony
DUI. She was sentenced to 730 days of home detention with 545 days suspended and
two-days credit for time served, along with 540 days of probation. She had her driver’s
license suspended and was ordered to pay fines. She completed her probation period in
December  2021,  as  well  as  all  other  requirements  of  her  sentence.  Despite  knowing
that  she  should  tell  her  employer  about  her  second  DUI  arrest,  she  did  not  do  so
because she forgot. She claimed that she will tell her employer about both DUIs. (Items
1-5)
After  her  May  2019  DUI,  Applicant  decided  to  stop  drinking  entirely.  There  is
evidence  that  she  has  abstained  from  alcohol  until  at  least  June  2021  when  she
submitted  her  interrogatory  responses.  However,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant
has  continued  to  abstain  from  alcohol  after  June  2021.  Applicant  was  on  probation
when  she  answered  those  interrogatories.  The  group  therapy  she  attended  in  August
2019  allowed  her to more fully understand the  negative  impact  alcohol was  having on
her  life  and  strengthened  her  resolve  to  abstain  from  alcohol  in  the  future.  Applicant
understands  that  she  has  a  problem  with  alcohol,  but  believes  it  is  not  related  to
addiction. Instead, her issue is that once she begins drinking alcohol, she has a difficult
time  stopping her consumption until she  is extremely intoxicated.  She does not  attend
any alcohol counseling or treatment. (Item 4)

"Applicant admitted all allegations contained in the SOR. (¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a.) In
addition to his admissions, he made a short statement about his lifestyle changes, current
separation  from  a  verbally  and  physically  abusive  spouse,  and  his  decision  to  abstain
from all alcohol consumption. (Answer)
Applicant is 30 years old, married with no children, and currently separated from
his  spouse.  Their  divorce  is  pending.  After  graduating  from  college  in  2014  with  a
bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, he worked as an engineer for the aviation

In  October  2020,  Applicant  submitted  an  Electronic  Questionnaires
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In January 2021, a government investigator conducted
a background interview with Applicant. They discussed Applicant’s June 2016 domestic
dispute and a November 2020 domestic dispute that occurred after he submitted the e-
QIP. Applicant reviewed the interview report, made corrections, and certified the summary
of the edited interview as accurate and true on June 6, 2021. (GE 1, GE 2)
SOR ¶  1.a  (cross-alleged under  ¶  2.a):
During the January 2021 background interview, Applicant discussed his June 2016
domestic dispute which occurred five months after he and his spouse were married. They
were  preparing  dinner  in  the  kitchen  and  he  had  consumed  four  to  five  beers,  but  he
denied  being  intoxicated.  An  argument  ensued,  and  he  picked  up  a  kitchen  knife  and
pretended to stab his wife. He did this to get her to stop arguing, but at no time did he
intend to harm her. His wife called the police, and he departed the residence. The next
day the police served him with a domestic violence protective order and confiscated all of
his  firearms.  He  was  not  charged  with  any  criminal  offense.  Applicant  and  his  spouse
lived  apart  for  a  couple  of  months  before  reconciling,  and  they  participated  in  marital
counseling. (GE 2; Tr. 30-34)
SOR ¶ 1.b  (cross-alleged under ¶  2.a):
Applicant informed the investigator during the January 2021 background interview
that  he  had  been  arrested  in  November  2020  for  another  domestic  dispute.  On  this
occasion, he and his wife were having dinner with family, and he drank 8-10 beers which
left him intoxicated. His wife drove them home, and he started to work on a foyer light
fixture in their new home. He received an electrical shock while working, cursed loudly,
and his wife came to investigate. She was irritated that he was working on the light fixture
and told him to go to bed, but Applicant ignored her. She pulled him off of the ladder, and
he fell to the floor. She was in a rage and threatened to break every item in the garage
that he cared about and proceeded to break several items. Applicant threw his wife to the
floor. He punched her multiple times in the face and stopped only after he realized there
was blood on the ground. She drove to her sister’s house and was taken to the hospital.
The police came to the residence and arrested Applicant. He stated that his earlier use
of alcohol had impaired his judgment. (GE 2; Tr. 40, 43-51)
In January 2021, Applicant was charged with assault with serious bodily injury, a
first degree felony, after his spouse suffered a fractured nose and other injuries. He was
also charged with two misdemeanor offenses: 1) assault on a female, and 2) assault inflict
serious injury. At the time of the security clearance hearing, Applicant’s criminal case was
still pending. He testified that his attorney recently informed him that he was working with
the prosecutor on a plea agreement. While the record was held open following the security
clearance hearing, Applicant timely submitted court records dated March 31, 2022, which
showed he pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to a misdemeanor offense of assault
inflict serious injury. He was sentenced to serve 60 days in jail, with two days credit. He
was  also  ordered  to  enroll  in  the  domestic  violence  intervention  program  (DVIP),  pay
restitution of $3,650, and he was placed on probation for 18 months. (GE 4, GE 5, and
AE G; Tr. 40, 52-58)
Applicant testified that he stopped drinking alcohol altogether in April 2021. At that
time,  he  had  visited  a  counselor  to  better  understand  his  behavior,  and  he  made  a
personal decision that he did not need alcohol in his life. He stopped drinking on his own.
He  has  never  received  alcohol  treatment  or  been  diagnosed  with  an  alcohol-related
disorder. He has not consumed any alcohol for one year. (Tr. 56; Answer)

friends,  family  members,  and  a  former  work  associate.  His  former  manager  praised
Applicant’s  depth  of  knowledge,  work  ethic,  and  professionalism.  Two  friends  and  two
family members stated that Applicant was not a violent person by nature. They believed
Applicant  was  in  an  unhealthy  relationship  with  his  spouse  and  his  actions,  although
inexcusable,  were  not  unprovoked.  Since  November  2020,  they  personally  witnessed
Applicant make positive changes, to include seeing a counselor and abstaining from using
alcohol.  Applicant’s  criminal  lawyer  stated  that  Applicant  has  been  a  considerate,
thoughtful, and forthcoming client. All of these individuals stated Applicant did not pose a

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f
and  2.a,  and  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.g-1.i  and  2.b.  His  admissions  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 25-year-old engineer hired by a defense contractor in October 2020,
contingent on his ability to obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 39.) He served on active duty
in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  December  2015  to  November  2018  and  received  an  honorable
discharge. He held a security clearance in the Navy. He  has been a university student
from January 2019 to the present, using his GI Bill educational benefits  and seeking a
degree in electrical engineering. (Tr. 39-40.) He was married from March 2018 to October
2020. He has no children.
In March 2016, Applicant received non-judicial punishment for underage alcohol
consumption.  His  punishment  was  restriction  to  the  base  for  45  days  and  forfeiture  of
one-half of his pay per month for two months. He was required to attend a 20-hour alcohol
and drug impact course, which he completed. (GX 2 at 11.). At the hearing, he testified
that this incident occurred after he had completed his engineering school, where he was
the  top  graduate,  and  he  was  celebrating  with  several  classmates.  After  he  and  his
classmates  returned  to  their barracks,  they were  unruly and  rowdy. When  questioned,
Applicant’s  classmates  identified  him  as  one  of  the  participants  at  the  graduation
celebration. He was 19 years old at the time, and he was punished for underage drinking.
(Tr. 25-27.)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  September  2017  and  charged  with  driving  while
intoxicated (DWI), first offense, and refusal of a blood or breath test. The blood or alcohol
test  refusal  was  disposed  of  by  nolle  prosequi.  (GX  6  at  1.)  He  was  convicted  of
misdemeanor DWI and appealed the conviction. In April 2019 he withdrew his appeal. He
was sentenced to 180 days in jail (suspended) and fines and costs of $546. His driver’s
license was suspended for one year and restricted to use for work and medical treatment,
and he was required to install an ignition interlock device. (GX 6 at 3-6.) At the hearing,
Applicant  stated  that  he  intends  to  apply for  expungement  of  the  court  records  of  this
incident. The petition for expungement submitted at the hearing showed no indicia that it
had been filed. (AX E.) I have taken judicial notice that the law of the jurisdiction where
Applicant was charged limits expungement to cases where there was an acquittal, a nolle
prosequi , or dismissal of the charge. (§19.2-392.2.)
In April 2018, Applicant received non-judicial punishment for failure to report his
September 2017 arrest to his command. He was reduced from paygrade E-4 to paygrade
E-3, restricted for 45 days, required to perform extra duty for 45 days, forfeited one-half
of a month’s pay for one month, and ordered to receive treatment in a substance abuse
rehabilitation program (SARP). He received treatment and was diagnosed with Alcohol
Use Disorder-Mild. Treatment at Level 1 was recommended. (GX 4 at 7.) He completed
the Level 1 treatment at a military medical facility in April 2018. (GX 2 at 9; GX 3.) The
record reflects that he was briefed on the mandatory one-year aftercare program, but it
does not reflect whether he completed it. (GX 2 at 10.)
In  June  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  public  intoxication.  He
testified that he and a group of friends were asked to leave a bar, but he returned to the
bar  to  retrieve  his  cellphone,  became  involved  in  a  discussion  about  his  reason  for
returning to the bar, and was arrested. (Tr. 34-35.) He appeared in court with an attorney,
and the charge was dismissed. (GX 2 at 14.)
In January 2020, Applicant was waiting for a rideshare service outside a bar, and
he  became  involved  in  a  loud  argument  after  someone  made  a  derogatory  comment
about  his  cousin,  whose  funeral  was  earlier  in  the  day,  and  was  charged  with  public
intoxication.  In  February 2020,  the  charge  of  public  intoxication  was  dismissed,  and  in
June 2020, the record was expunged. (AX B at 3-4.)
In March 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication after
he  and  an  intoxicated  family  member  were  involved  in  an  altercation.  He  completed
treatment  through  a  SARP  program  in  April  2020.  In  July  2020,  the  charge  of  public
intoxication was dismissed, and in October 2020, the record was expunged. (AX B at 1-
2.)
After Applicant’s non-judicial punishment in April 2018, he was required to attend
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as part of his treatment. He continued to attend AA
meetings sporadically through 2019.  During an interview with a security investigator in
January  2021,  he  stated  that  he  was  consuming  four  or five  beers  at  a  sitting  once  a
month. (GX 2 at 15.) In response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2021, he stated that he
was  consuming one  to  three  beers once a week  or every two  weeks.  (GX 2  at 6.)  He
resumed regular AA attendance in May 2021. (Tr. 32-33.) He testified that, after a “lot of
trial and error with responsible drinking,” he stopped drinking alcohol in May 2021. At the
time of the hearing, he had stopped attending AA meetings. He testified that AA is very
helpful, but over time it becomes very depressing and its value is diminished. (Tr. 41.) He
has separated himself from his Navy friends, found new hobbies, and worked on physical
fitness. (Tr. 28-29.)
Applicant’s former division officer aboard a Navy ship for two years considers him
an honest, reliable, and inspiring sailor. (AX D at 5.) A chief petty officer who has known
Applicant  for  about  five  years  describes  him  as  “tirelessly  hard  working,  trustworthy,
courteous, and honest.” He believes that Applicant always achieves what he decides to
do “with dedication and sheer force of will.” He is aware of the allegations in the SOR and
believes that they will not be repeated. (AX D at 2.) A retired chief petty officer who was
Applicant’s leading petty officer believes that the conduct alleged in the SOR is not a true
representation of Applicant’s character and that it will not recur. (AX D at 6.) A first class
petty officer who has known Applicant for about three years states that Applicant had a
reputation  as  one  of  the  most  hard-working  and  trustworthy  sailors  in  the  engineering
department of their ship. (AX D at 3). A former shipmate and personal friend considers
Applicant honest, dependable, and trustworthy. (AX D at 4.)  A fellow petty officer third
class states that Applicant was one of the hardest working, trustworthy, well-respected,
and honest sailors in the command. (AX D at 1.)

Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  offenses,  primarily  alcohol  related.  He  was
arrested in 2015 and charged  with assault. Alcohol was not a factor in this charge. He
explained  that  he  had  an  argument  with  his  roommate  and  pushed  him.  His  attorney
was  apparently  able  to  negotiate  a  plea  bargain  to  a  less  serious  offense.  Applicant
claims it was littering. (Tr. at 23-26; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  September  2016  and  charged  with  driving  while
intoxicated  (DWI).  The  police  report  of  the  incident  shows  that  Applicant  took  a
breathalyzer  test  that  registered  .19%  blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC),  more  than
double  the  legal  limit.  He  pleaded  guilty  in  December  2016  and  was  sentenced  to
probation for two years. (Tr. at 33-36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5)
Applicant broke both of his wrists in a motorcycle accident in about 2017 after he
had been drinking. He was  able to  walk away from  the accident and  was  taken to the

charged. (Tr. at 17-18, 22-23, 36-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant was drunk in February 2020 and had an argument with a friend at the
friend’s  house.  The  friend  told  Applicant  to  leave.  After  leaving,  Applicant  “keyed”  the
friend’s car and the friend’s girlfriend’s car. Applicant testified that he had about three to
four beers over a period of a couple hours and that he felt “buzzed,” but not intoxicated.
He did not feel that alcohol was a factor in his conduct because he “was super mad, and
[he]  would  have  done  it  even  if  [he]  was  sober.”  His  testimony  is  inconsistent  with  his
statement to a background investigator in August 2020 that he was super drunk during
the incident. (Tr. at 38-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
An arrest warrant was issued, and Applicant was charged with two felony counts
of  property  damage.  Pursuant  to  a  plea  bargain,  in  about  February  2022,  he  pleaded
guilty  to  two  misdemeanor  counts  of  property  damage.  He  was  required  to  make
restitution of $1,625 and $1,490 to the two victims, and he was sentenced to probation
for one year. Terms of the probation included no contact with the victims and payment
of court costs. (Tr. at 15, 38-41; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 6, 7; AE 1)
Applicant testified that he has not had any alcohol since the incident in February
2020.  He  admitted  that  he  told  a  background  investigator  in  August  2020  that  he
continued to regularly drink until shortly before the interview. He testified that he lied to
the  investigator when he  told  the  investigator that he  had been  drinking when  actually
he  had  not.  He  did  not  like  his  team  at  work,  and  he  thought  if  he  did  not  receive  a
clearance he would be transferred to another team. (Tr.at 43-46; GE 2)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
June  2020.  He failed  to  report any  of  his criminal arrests  or  charges  under any  of  the
pertinent questions. (Tr. at 29-30; GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2020. When
asked if he had been arrested within the last seven years, if he had ever been charged
with a felony, and if he had ever been charged with a drug or alcohol-related offense, he
answered  “no”  to  each  question.  He  discussed  his  2016  DWI  after  being  specifically
confronted with it. He stated that he did not report the DWI on the SF 86 and discuss it
with the investigator because he did not know if it would show up on a records check.
Applicant  then  also  discussed  his  2015  and  2020  offenses.  He  stated  that  he  did  not
report  the  2020  arrest  and  charges  on  the  SF  86  because  he  thought  if  his  current
employer knew about the charges, he would not have been hired. (Tr. at 30-32; GE 1,

Applicant  denied   intentionally   providing   false   information   on   the   SF  86.  In   his
response   to   the   SOR,   he   wrote   that  he   “did   not  fully   understand   what  charge   meant,”
and  that  he  thought that since  he  had  a  lawyer and  the  charges were reduced, he  was
not being  charged  at the  time. When  asked  at hearing  why  he  did not report  that he  had
been  arrested, he  testified: “I believe  negligence  of the  law. I thought - - I felt like  I  was
just  being  like  in  a  hold, and  I hadn’t gotten  arrested  yet,  like  until my  case  got  to  trial.”
He testified  that he  thought the  2016  DWI  charge  had  been  reduced  to  littering.  Other
than  Applicant’s  testimony, there  is no  evidence  that the  DWI  charge  had  been  reduced
to   littering.  Applicant  could  not  explain   why   he   did   not  report  a   conviction   for  littering.

The SOR alleges that Applicant was evaluated in September 2018, by a licensed
clinical psychologist and was subsequently diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, most recent
episode  with  psychotic  features;  alcohol use disorder, severe;  and unspecified  anxiety
disorder. Additionally, the SOR alleged that the psychologist determined that an absence
of any clear medical indication that Applicant’s consumption of alcohol was in accordance
with  medical  recommendations,  it  could  adversely  affect  her  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness due to her psychological condition. The alcohol use disorder was cross-
alleged under Guideline G. The SOR also alleged that when Applicant was discharged in
April 2015 from an inpatient treatment program for her bipolar I disorder, she received a
medical recommendation that she abstain from alcohol, yet she continued to consume
alcohol. (SOR; GE 5)
Applicant admitted in her Answer to the SOR that her current diagnosis is bipolar
I disorder, for which she receives regular treatment. However, she denied the alcohol use
disorder, severe diagnosis,  and stated that in  2015  she stopped taking the  medication
that  was  contraindicated  with  alcohol  use.  Additionally,  she  indicated  that  she  has
voluntarily abstained from alcohol since November 2019. (SOR; Answer; AE A; AE B)
From  a  young  age, Applicant suffered  from  sporadic depression  issues, and  her
drinking,  in  part,   was  the   result  of   her  depression   and   undiagnosed   mental  health
conditions.  She   started   drinking   alcohol   in  high   school  at   the   age   of  15   or  16.  Her
depression   worsened   while  she   was  in  college,   and   consequently,   her  alcohol
consumption  increased after she  started college  in 1996. (GE 4  at 4;  GE 5;  Tr. at  29, 44-
45, 59-60; Tr. 2  at 20)
In 2000, while still in college, Applicant was “very depressed” and started “drinking
heavily.” She consumed alcohol three to four times a week to the point of intoxication. In
September  2000,  she  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  of
alcohol (DUI) after attending a party. Applicant pled guilty and paid the relevant fines. She
was not court ordered to receive treatment, nor did she voluntarily seek treatment for her
alcohol consumption at that time. (GE 4 at 3-4; GE 5; Tr. 37-39, 59-60; Tr. 2 at 20)
In July 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with a second DUI. Following
this arrest, she voluntary attended alcohol-related treatment from August to September
2001.  She  received  inpatient  treatment  for  approximately 10  days  and  then  outpatient
treatment for two to three months. According to Applicant, the treatment she received was
helpful, but she does not recall what her diagnosis was at that time. (Applicant attempted
to  obtain  a  copy  of  these  treatment  records,  but  they  had  been  destroyed.)  It  was
recommended  that  following  her  treatment,  she  discontinue  consuming  alcohol  and
continue attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (AA meetings were part of her
outpatient treatment.) She voluntarily attended AA meetings for approximately three years
after the July 2001 DUI. She found that the AA meetings fell in line with her personal faith,
and they were very helpful overall in her life. (GE 4 at 4; GE 5; Tr. at 38-42, 61-62; Tr. 2
at 21, 23)
Applicant was unaware of how significant her depression or mental health issues
were  until  approximately  2004,  when  she  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  disorder
(unspecified) by her then primary care physician. He also treated her older sister, who
had previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It was stressed to Applicant that she
take her medication regularly; however, after her initial diagnosis, she freely admits that
she was inconsistent with taking her medications for about a year. She later realized that
she needed her medication and was mostly compliant for approximately ten years, until
about 2014. (Tr. at 29, 40, 43-46, 61)
In approximately 2004, when Applicant resumed consuming alcohol, she disclosed
to her primary care physician that she was drinking again in moderation. He asked her to
watch her levels of alcohol consumption, but he never told her not to drink or gave her
instructions as to how much she should or should not drink. She testified that she resumed
consuming  alcohol,  because  she  believed  she  had  dealt  with  her  underlying  mental-
health issues and did not consider herself to be an alcoholic, alcohol dependent, nor have
an  alcohol-related  condition.  She  also  described  her  drinking  as  responsible,  due  to
having matured. Between 2004, when Applicant resumed consuming alcohol, and 2019,
when  she  discontinued  consuming  alcohol,  as  further  discussed  below,  she  had  no
alcohol-related incidents. (GE 4; Tr. at 42-43, 46-47, 62-66; Tr. 2 at 24)
In August 2011, Applicant sought treatment from her primary care physician, due
to a crying spell. (She received treatment from him from 2009 to 2015.) He referred her
to  a  local  hospital  where  she  received  three  days  of  inpatient  treatment  for  a  bipolar
episode.  She  could  provide  no  additional  details  regarding  the  circumstances  of  this
incident. (GE 4; Tr. at 64, 66-68)
In April 2015, Applicant noticed her medications were no longer working, as she
was hearing voices and having paranoid and suicidal ideations. She went to her parents’
home  for  support  and  later  contacted  her  primary  care  physician.  She  was  ultimately
referred  to  an  inpatient  facility  for  five  days  of  treatment.  At  that  time,  she  was
experiencing  a  manic  episode  and  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  I  disorder,  recurrent,
severe depression with psychotic features, and anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified.
Following this diagnosis and treatment, she felt like her medications were working, but
due to the effect the situation had on her, she voluntarily did not drink for approximately
eight months, as she wanted to allow her brain time to rest and heal. (GE 2; GE 4; GE 5;
Tr. at 30-31, 47-51)
Applicant did not recall if the inpatient facility recommended that she abstain from
alcohol and drugs. Nor did she read the medication instructions for the prescriptions that
she  received.  According  to  the  records  that  she  provided  in  her  response  to
interrogatories, at least one of the medications she was prescribed in April 2015, indicated
that a person taking the prescription should “[a]void alcoholic drinks.” (More than one of
the medications she was prescribed at that time, also indicated that it was recommended,
“Give your health care provider a list of all the medicines, herbs, non-prescription drugs,
or dietary supplements you use. Also tell them if you smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal
drugs. Some items may interact with your medicine.) As stated above, for approximately
eight months after her hospitalization, Applicant voluntarily abstained from alcohol. She
does not recall receiving any specific recommendations from her treating physicians to
abstain from alcohol. (GE 2; GE 4; GE 5; Tr. at 30-31, 47-51; Tr. 2 at 24)
After Applicant was discharged from the inpatient facility in April 2015, she started
receiving  treatment  from  Facility  X,  which  is  an  outpatient  facility  specializing  in
psychotherapy, substance use disorders, and other related therapies. She has received
consistent treatment from this facility up until at least the reconvened hearing.
I did not expect to have a manic episode. But it ended up being a blessing.
…[O]nce  I got to  [Facility  X], and  ultimately  ended  up  following  up  with  them,
they  just  really  know  what they’re  doing.   … [T]hey’re  experts in their  field
and   it’s been   a  great  thing. And  I  did  follow  up  with  my  psychiatrist every
three  months, I believe. And  of  course,  I can  always call  and  get in sooner
if I need  to. (Tr. at 31-32)
At Facility  X,  Applicant  primarily  saw  Dr. A, a  psychiatrist,  from April 2015  to  February
2017, when  her treating  psychiatrist became Dr. B. In  Applicant’s medical records, Dr. B
noted  that in October 2018, Applicant had  bipolar II  disorder, generalized  anxiety disorder,
and   ADHD.  She   found   Applicant’s  thought   process,  at  that  time,  to   be   logical  and
coherent.  (GE 3)
Applicant’s medical records from Facility X reflect that she became more compliant
with taking her medication the longer she received treatment from this specialized facility.
Additionally, her prognosis improved and the frequency of her appointments decreased.
Throughout the notes in the records, it is apparent that Applicant self-reported periods of
non-compliance with various prescribed medications. In her February 2018 appointment,
Applicant disclosed that she had discontinued taking Zoloft due to its side effects, and
she  and  Dr.  B  developed  a  new  treatment  plan.  At  various  points  in  her  treatment,
Applicant discussed discontinuing other medications with Dr. B based upon side effects
she was experiencing. Her most significant non-compliance with taking medications was
noted in February 2017, when she discontinued taking her medications for three weeks,
but she self-reported this to Dr. B. At the hearing, Applicant explained that she stopped
taking one of her prescriptions, because it would get stuck in her throat. Applicant was
required to undergo a procedure under general anesthesia, as the medication had burned
her throat. She did not like taking this medication, and at the hearing could only recall
discontinuing this specific medication. (GE 3; Tr. at 45-46; Tr. 2 at 20-21)
Following  her  2015  manic  episode  and  bipolar  I  disorder  diagnosis,  Applicant
slowly resumed consuming alcohol again in approximately 2016, while she was receiving
treatment at Facility X. She explained that she felt comfortable drinking because she was
in  a  good  place  with  her  psychotropic  medication.  Applicant  disclosed  that  she  was
consuming  alcohol  to  both  Dr.  A  and  Dr.  B.  Applicant’s  records  reflect  that  she  also
disclosed  to  Dr.  B,  her  prior  DUIs  and  her  earlier  history  of  drinking  related  to  her
depression. Dr. B did not diagnose Applicant with an alcohol-related disorder nor did she
note that Applicant should discontinue drinking due to her prescribed medication. (GE 3
at 25, 27; GE 5; AE A; AE N; AE O; Tr. at 52-53; Tr. 2 at 24-25)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  her  current  mental  health  condition  is
positive. She been receiving treatment every three months by her treating psychiatrist,
Dr. B.  Since  receiving  treatment at  Facility  X,  where she  received  specialized  treatment
for the  first time  since  she  was diagnosed  with  a  psychological condition, she  has received
better medications, has realized how much she  needs them, and how important they are
to  her wellbeing. Her medications  are  currently  working  for her. She  saw  her psychiatrist
the  week before the  first hearing. She  takes her medications as prescribed  and  has  no
intention of discontinuing  them..  (Answer; GE  3; GE 5; AE  A; AE  O; Tr. at 32, 45-46, 56-
57)
On  September  26,  2018,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  board  certified
neuropsychologist hired by the DOD CAF to perform an evaluation. Applicant met with
the psychologist once for approximately two to three hours. The psychologist noted that
Applicant  was  punctual,  friendly,  open,  exhibited  poor  recall,  showed  no  signs  of
psychosis,  and  she  had  normal  affect.  The  psychologist  administered  the  Personality
Assessment Inventory (PAI) test. Applicant’s results indicated that her clinical profile was
entirely within normal limits, and there were no indications of significant psychopathology.
“Her profile  indicates that she  is generally a  confident,  resilient,  and  optimistic person.”
(Tr. at 68; GE 5)
The psychologist reviewed records provided to her by the DOD CAF, but her report
did not provide a detailed list of the documents she reviewed. Based upon statements in
her report, she reviewed records that were not offered into evidence at the hearing by the
Government,  as  various  statements  and  references  are  not  corroborated  by  the
Government’s exhibits that are in the record. Applicant signed multiple releases for her
treatment records at Facility X. However, the psychologist completed her evaluation on
October  23,  2018,  less  than  a  month  after  interviewing  Applicant.  The  Government
received a copy of Applicant’s  records from Facility X on January 21, 2019, but did not
apparently  submit  them  to  the  psychologist  for  an  updated  report.  Additionally,  in  her
September 2019 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a copy of the April
2015 treatment records from the inpatient treatment facility mentioned above. Based upon
her report,  it  is unclear if the DOD CAF  psychologist  reviewed  a  summary of  the  April
2015 records from the Report of Investigation (ROI) or the actual records. (GE 3; GE 5)
Based upon the documents available  to her,  her interview of  Applicant, and the
results of the PAI test, the DOD CAF psychologist determined that as of October 2018
Applicant’s:
Bipolar Disorder is quite  severe and  likely  to  require  medical management
for the  foreseeable future. She  maintains that she  has been  consistently  on
her mood  stabilizing  medications  for three  years though  this could not be
verified   by   her  current  prescribers….  Assuming   [Applicant’s]  report  is
accurate  that she  is fully  adherent  to  her medication  regiment,  that is clearly
favorable to  her and  additionally, she  seems to  have  a  supportive  family  that
helps her when  she  has a  symptom  breakthrough  of  her disorder, which is
quite  favorable.  However, through  the  clinical interview, it is apparent that it
is not uncommon  for her to  have  some  breakthrough  symptoms of mania
on  occasion,  despite  her claims  of medication  compliance.  Again,  given  the
lack  of  any  substantiating  records,  it  is  unclear  whether  [Applicant]  is
disclosing  these  breakthrough  symptoms  to  her  treating  psychiatrists  or
whether they have considered titrating her medications accordingly. (GE 5)
The DOD CAF psychologist noted that regarding Applicant’s alcohol consumption:
Of   greatest   concern  is   applicant’s  clear  history   of   Alcohol  Use  Disorder,
particularly   given   her  concomitant  Bipolar  I  Disorder.  My   aforementioned
inability   to   obtain   any   contemporaneous   records  from   her  treating
psychiatrists  or  discuss  [Applicant’s]  case   with   them   has  not  allayed
concerns  about  her  alcohol consumption  or determine  if her  treating  doctors
are even  aware she  consumes alcohol while  on  her specified  medication
regimen.  While  the  amount of alcohol [Applicant]  claims to  consume  may
be relatively moderate  for individuals without a concomitant serious mental
illness, I am  concerned  that any  amount of  alcohol consumption  in light of
her co-occurring  Bipolar Disorder may  be  contraindicated, given  the  severe
nature  of her symptoms as discussed  above. As such, these  factors indicate
a guarded prognosis. (GE 5)
The psychologist’s 2018 report opined that at some point, Applicant’s drinking may have
become somewhat problematic again for a period, following a traumatic incident when
she  was  30.  However,  after  speaking  to  her  mother,  she  reduced  her  consumption.
Ultimately, the psychologist determined that, “Applicant’s psychological condition and her
alcohol  consumption  may  have  an  untoward  effect  on  her  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness. (GE 5; Tr. 2 at 21)
Applicant  discontinued  drinking  alcohol  after  she  received  the  SOR  in  early
December 2019. She attended 47 AA meetings from December 2019 until March 2020,
when in-person meetings were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From March
2020 until the time of the hearing,  she has been  reading AA  literature and the AA Big
Book  three  to  four  times  a  week,  and  she  has  been  attending  church.  She  intends  to
continue to abstain from alcohol. Since she started working for her current employer in
2016 until 2019, when she discontinued drinking, she drank two or three times a week,
but would typically consume less than one beer. When she was interviewed May 2017,
by  a  Government  investigator,  Applicant  indicated  that  she  did  not  believe  she  had  a
problem with alcohol. At the hearing, she reiterated that she does not consider herself to
be an alcoholic but recognizes that “alcohol has caused enough problems in [her] life  –
with two DUIS, and now with the SOR – it’s best to just leave it alone at this point.” (GE
4; AE B; Tr. at 33-36, 57-59, 72)
The DOD CAF psychologist also indicated that Applicant had trouble remembering
things  during  the  interview;  therefore,  she  concluded  that  Applicant  was  not  as  well
stabilized as she claimed. At the reconvened hearing in May 2021, Applicant explained
that she was nervous and anxious about the evaluation due to its importance. In , addition,
she  suffers  from  Attention-deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD),  which  could  have
affected  her  recall  ability  during  her  interview  with  DOD  CAF  psychologist.  Applicant
underscored that she was not having a manic episode at the time of her interview, which
the DOD CAF psychologist suggested in her report. (GE 5; Tr. 2 at 18-20)
At the  reconvened  hearing, Applicant testified  that she  had  issues with  the  CAF’s
2018  psychology  report. When  she  met with  the  psychologist, the  psychologist, told her
that she  did not have  any  of  Applicant’s medical records.  Prior to  meeting  with  the  CAF
psychologist, Applicant  had  signed  release  forms for all  of  her medical records.  She  asked
the   CAF  psychologist  if   they   could  call   Facility   X   together  to   try   to   get  copies  of   her
records.  They  spent 45  minutes  on  the  phone  together trying  to  get the  records faxed  to
the  CAF psychologist. A  week later, Applicant  followed  up  with  the  CAF psychologist, who
told her that  she  had  not received  the  records  yet.  Applicant  contacted  Facility  X  again to
try to get the records to  the CAF psychologist. (Tr. 2 at 15-16)
Applicant’s treating   psychiatrist,  Dr. B, wrote   medical status letters in November
2019, December 2020, and April 2021  for her. Dr. B’s November 2019 letter, stating  that
Applicant  has  been   compliant  with   her  appointments  and   medication   regimen   and   her
“mental  illness   has   been   stable.  She   showed   good   insight  and   judgement  toward  her
condition   and   necessary   steps  to   maintain  remission   of   her  illness.”  In   her  December
2020  letter, Dr.  B  reiterated  that  Applicant’s  “mental health  condition  has been  stable  and
in  remission   in  the   past  year  and   a   half   with   no   medication   adjustments   needed.
[Applicant] has been  sober from alcohol for over a  year now  and  denied  having  cravings
for alcohol. She has continued  using AA philosophy to maintain sobriety. [She] has been
compliant  with   her  medications  and   appointments  and   has  been   seen   by   psychiatrist
every three  months for the  past year.” (Answer; AE  A; AE N; Tr. at 32; Tr. 2 at 24-25)
At  the  reconvened  hearing,  Applicant  provided  an  updated  letter  from  Dr.  B,  to
respond  to  the  issues  raised  in  the  2018  DOD  CAF  report.  In  it,  Dr.  B’s  reported
Applicant’s current diagnoses, which considered the findings of the DOD psychological
evalution from 2018:
[Applicant] has been seen by several [Facility X] psychiatrists since 2015.
She  has  been  followed  by  this  provider  since  February  2017  for  Other
Schizoaffective  Disorder  (F25.8),  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  (F41.1),
Attention-deficit  Hyperactivity Disorder, combined type  (F90.2), History of
Alcohol abuse, currently in remission.
[Applicant]  has  been  having  her  symptoms  well  controlled  after  last
medication adjustments on 6/20/2019. [Applicant] has been showing good
insight in her condition and has been compliant with her medications and
appointments.  [Applicant]  has  been  showing  determination  and  ability  to
stay  sober  and  maintain  her  best  ability  to  function.  She  has  not  been  a
threat  to  herself  or  others.  PDMP  has  been  monitored  and  no  concerns
about filling habits were found.
Of   note,   Dr.  B,   indicated   that  Applicant’s  history   of  alcohol  abuse   disorder  was  in
remission. Additionally, she  changed  Applicant’s diagnosis from  bipolar I disorder to  Other
Schizoaffective Disorder. (AE O;  Tr. 2  at 24-25)
At  the  first  hearing  in  April  2021,  seven  work-related  witnesses  testified  for
Applicant. They are aware of the allegations in the SOR, and they all possess either secret
or  top  secret  security  clearances.  None  of  them  have  concerns  regarding  Applicant
having access to classified material. (Tr. at 71-72)
Witness  1  (W1)  has  known  Applicant  since  April  2016,  and  is  her  current
supervisor.  They  have  socialized  outside  of  work,  and  she  has  never  observed  her
consume  alcohol.  According  to  WI,  Applicant  does  great  work,  she’s  very  thorough,
people love working with her, and she is a great employee. W1 is aware of the issues
raised  in  the  SOR  and  has  never  witnessed  “at  any  point…anything  that  made  [her]
hesitant in any way either as an employee or as a friend.” (Answer; Tr. 77-84)
Witness 2 (W2) has known Applicant since April 2016. They are part of the same
security team and work closely together. He considers her to be very conscientious. She
has a great reputation and is known for thoroughness. He has held a top secret security
clearance for three years and held a secret security clearance for approximately fifteen
prior  years.  W2  has  never  observed  Applicant  exhibit  any  behavior  that  caused  him
concern. They have only interacted outside of work a couple of times, and he has never
observed her consume alcohol. (Tr. 84-90)
Witness 3 (W3) has held a top secret security clearance for approximately fifteen
years.  He  has  known  Applicant  since  April  2016,  and  interacts  with  her  daily.  She  is
always timely, reliable, dependable, a very fast learner, and “an absolute energetic team
player.” W3 has never observed Applicant exhibit behavior that caused him concern. (Tr.
91-96)
Witness 4 (W4) has held a security clearance since 1999, and currently holds a
top secret security clearance. He is a retired combat Marine. Applicant works for him on
his security team, and he as her senior rater; they interact daily. He wishes that he “had
ten  of  her.  She  does  amazing  work,  outstanding  work,  and  she’s  relied  upon  heavily
because  she  gets  the  job  done,  right,  on  time,  every  time.”  He  has  never  observed
Applicant exhibit behavior that caused him concern, or  seen any indications of alcohol
abuse. (Tr. 96-101)
Witness  5  (W5)  has held a  security  clearance  since  2007,  and  currently  holds  a
top  secret  security  clearance.  She  has known  Applicant since  2018, has been  her direct
supervisor since  2020, and  interacts  with  her daily. Applicant is one  of the  her most  valued
team  members and   “goes  way   above   and  beyond.”  W5   has  never observed   Applicant
exhibit behavior that caused  her concern, or any  indications of  alcohol abuse.  (Tr. 102-
106)
Witness 6  (W6)  is a  retired  U.S. Army  officer. He has held a  security  clearance  his
entire professional career. He has known  Applicant since  approximately  2017, and  works
with  her daily. He considers Applicant to  be  an  excellent worker and  has received  nothing
but  compliments  regarding   her  work  performance.  W6   has  never  observed   Applicant
exhibit behavior that  caused  him  concern, or any  indications  of  alcohol abuse.  (Tr. at 106-
112)
Witness  7  (W7)  has  known  Applicant  since  2019.  They  have  been  co-workers
since 2020, and interact daily. He stated, “She  is an  impeccable addition to this team.
She  saves  our  backsides  more  often  than  we  save  hers.”  W7  has  never  observed
Applicant exhibit behavior that caused him concern, or any indications of alcohol abuse.
(Tr. at 112-116)
Witness  8  (W8)  has  been  Applicant’s  boyfriend  since  2015.  He  is  aware  of  the
SOR allegations. He has no concerns regarding her mental health and considers her to
be well-adjusted. She regularly visits her physician and takes her medication. She has
never  expressed  a  desire  to  discontinue  taking  her  medication  with  him.  Prior  to  the
issuance of the SOR, W8 knew Applicant consumed alcohol, but never observed it being
a problem or saw her drinking to excess. Since December 2019, he has not observed her
consume alcohol. (Tr. at 116-124)
The  DOD  CAF  psychologist  also  opined  that  although  it  is  “not  uncommon  for
patients to have difficulty recalling specific events surrounding manic/psychotic episodes,
[Applicant’s] confusion for recall of  other major life  events was particularly concerning.”
Department Counsel, who was the only person at the original hearing who had read GE
5, did not question Applicant’s witnesses to determine if any of them had ever observed
Applicant acting confused or scattered either at work or outside or work. However, none
of Applicant’s witnesses testified that she was prone to confusion or scattered thinking.
(GE 5)
Applicant’s performance evaluations and numerous awards demonstrate that she
is  a  highly  valued  employee  of  her  company  who  “greatly  exceeds  expectations.”  As
noted in one of her awards, she:
“[r]egularly  achieves  highly  impressive  results  that  surpass  agreed
outcome-based  goals”;  “[d]emonstrates  initiative  and  willingness  to  go
beyond own job requirements”; [and has] “[s]trong interpersonal skills and
organizational  knowledge  which  contributes  success  to  the  team  and
[company].”
Applicant’s current credit score is 825. (Answer; AE E-L; AE N; AE M)

",True
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  61  years  old.  He  is  a  college  graduate.  He  is  twice  divorced  and
married to his current wife since 2002. He has one adult biological child and two adult
stepdaughters.  He  has  five  grandchildren.  The  grandchildren  live  close  to  him and  his
wife, and they provide support and care for them as needed. They see the grandchildren
several times a week. Applicant is a father figure as there are no other males in the family.
(Tr. 21-25, 79-80)
In January 2019, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUI). The breathalyzer registered .10%. He cooperated with police and was remorseful
for his conduct. Applicant was on a business trip and was out to dinner with his boss. He
admitted he had more drinks than he should have had. He has diabetes and did not take
his insulin that day. He testified that he did not feel impaired, but he used poor judgment
in driving. He said he should have known better. He preaches to his children never to
drink and drive and felt like a hypocrite. Prior to the incident, he occasionally had alcoholic
drinks on a special occasion such as his birthday His last drink was on his last birthday in
July. Due to his diabetes he rarely consumes alcohol because of its negative impact. He
credibly testified this was a one-time isolated incident. He acknowledged it was a terrible
mistake. (Tr. 73-77, 83, 137-145)
The charge was reduced to reckless driving. Applicant completed a MADD victim
impact panel as part of his sentence and paid a fine. The charge was expunged from his
record in September 2019. (AE N, O, P, Q, R)
In  September  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  felony  domestic
battery by strangulation. SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that he grabbed his stepdaughter (SD) by the
neck after she kicked and attempted to strike him.
Applicant  testified  that  he  had  loaned  SD  money  and  she  came  to  his  house
uninvited. She was agitated and yelling at him. He asked her to pay the money she owed
him  that  was  due  that  day.  She  refused  and  yelled  profanity  at  him.  According  to
Applicant, she then kneed him in the groin and punched him several times in the chest,
neck  and  throat  area.  They  engaged  in  a  mutual  altercation,  shoving  each  other.  She
hooked her finger in his mouth and her finger got cut, likely from his teeth biting her. She
took a bottle that was accessible and hit him on the head. She then called the police, who
responded about an hour later, and Applicant was arrested and taken to jail. (Tr. 35-47;
129-137, 157-159.)
The police report showed that SD made a sworn statement saying she had a verbal
altercation  with  Applicant  and  then  he  attacked  her  by  pushing  her,  taking  hold  of  her
throat, held her against a doorway, and he placed her finger in his mouth and bit it. (AE
E)
SD provided a written statement in support of Applicant regarding the incident (and
also a 2013 incident). She stated that she provoked the argument and “flew off the handle”
and the name calling began. (AE F) She stated:
I  was  the   one   who   provoked   the   incident  by   first  slapping   him   and   then
kicking  him  in the  groin. He was defending  himself  and  I persisted  which  led
to  the  incident where we  both  grabbed  one  another. I grabbed  him  and  he
grabbed   me.  As  we   were  pushing   each   other  away   we   both   ended   up
grabbing  each  other by  the  throat.  I tried  to  hook him  in  the  mouth  where
my   finger  became   cut.   I   also   hit  him   in  the   back  of  the   head   with   a
vase/bottle. (AE F)
SD  further  stated  that  it  was  a  horrible  and  tragic  event  that  led  to  Applicant’s
arrest. She acted immaturely and deeply regrets the incident. She discussed the incident
with the State attorney and the charges were dropped against Applicant. She described
Applicant as a kind and loving man toward his children and grandchildren. She stated this
was an isolated incident and since the altercation she and her family have developed a
non-adversarial communication system to discuss issues. She and her stepfather are on
good terms and are embarrassed and ashamed about their past behavior. They love and
support each other. After the incident they apologized to each other. (AE F)
SD  testified  at  the  hearing.  She  refused  to  answer  questions  that  raised  issues
about  her  veracity  based  on  the  sworn  statement  she  provided  to  police,  her  written
statement, and her testimony. I did not find her credible. (Tr. 191)
SD testified that Applicant has been a father figure to her for the past 20 years.
She has been diagnosed with depression and said “I basically am suicidal.” (Tr. 172) She
stated that she was responsible for starting the 2018 incident, it was her fault, and it was
not fair to him. She did not believe he bit her finger on purpose. She had the charges
dropped because it was not fair to Applicant when she was the one who was wrong. She
no longer needs Applicant’s help financially. (Tr. 172-212)
Applicant  admitted  it  was  an  emotional  incident.  He  took  responsibility  for  his
conduct.  In  October  2018,  the  State  Attorney  declined  to  prosecute  the  case  after
considering SD’s statement, statements of witnesses, and the police report. The charges
were dropped. (Tr. 35-47; AE F)
In December 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault
with a deadly weapon. It was alleged he was engaged in a physical fight with his son-in-
law  (SD’s  husband)  after  the  son-in-law  attempted  to  strike  Applicant.  The  son-in-law
alleged Applicant wielded a knife during the altercation. (GE 3, 4, 5; AE G)
Applicant testified that SD was married to S at the time of the incident. SD has two
children from another marriage. On the birth certificate of her third child, S is listed as the
father, but he is not the biological father. This child was three years old at the time of the
2013 incident. SD called Applicant because she was afraid of S. He was attacking her
and  she  was  concerned  for  the  safety  of  the  children.  Applicant  described  S  as
unpredictable due to his use of  illegal drugs, including methamphetamine and alcohol.
Applicant drove to SD and S’s house. He did not call the police because he said the police
have never done anything in the past when SD called. He admitted he did not think to call
the police, but was acting on instinct. When he arrived at the house, Applicant observed
S and SD tussling. He asked S what was the matter with him. Then S took a swing at him
and the two began to fight. There is conflicting testimony and in written statements, SD
said she was being attacked by S and was on the ground when Applicant arrived. At some
point, Applicant and S stopped fighting, and S called the police. Applicant stated that S
got the worst of it with a cut on his face and mouth. Applicant stated he was defending
himself. He then went outside and waited for the police to arrive. Applicant was arrested
and put in jail. (Tr. 47-60 118-126, 160-163; AE G)
S claimed that Applicant arrived at the house and charged him unprovoked, threw
him against the wall, and held a pocket knife to his throat. Applicant denied a knife was
involved and none was retrieved as evidence. He said he does not own a pocket knife. In
January  2014,  the  State  Attorney  determined  he  would  not  file  an  information  on  the
charges. (Tr. 47-60; AE H)
SD  testified  that  she  was  being  attacked  by  S  and  someone  called  the  police.
Applicant arrived and pulled S off of her and started to defend her. She did not see a knife
during  the  altercation.  She  stated  that  S  had  a  drug  problem  and  was  in  and  out  of
recovery.  He  was  abusive  and has been in other relationships where  he  was  abusive.
She had two protective injunctions against him. (Tr. 178-186)
Applicant admitted  he  could have  done  something  to  deescalate  the  situation  by
removing  SD  from  the  house  and  calling  the  police. Through  counseling,  he  is more aware
of  approaching  a  volatile situation  with  the  premise  of doing  the  right thing.  S  provided  a
statement in  his motion  to  dissolve  an injunction  for protection  dated  January  29, 2014.
His statement said  that  the  incident was a  misunderstanding  with  his “soon  to  be  ex-wife.”
He said he  did not want the  incident to  impact  Applicant’s job  because  he pays all  of  the
bills and  he  didn’t  want  the  rest  of  the family  to  suffer. He stated  he was sorry  and  never
intended  to  waste  anyone’s time.  A  copy  of  a  mug  shot  and  booking  record for a  later  May
2019   arrest  of   S   for  a  domestic  violence   violation;  controlled   substance   –   possession
without a  prescription;  and  possession  of drug  paraphernalia  was provided, presumably
to  show  S’s character, but also to  show  the  pose  he  struck for the  photo.  (Tr. 81-84, 126-
128; AE H, BB)
In 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery-domestic violence. The
SOR  alleged  he  struck  his  wife  after  she  struck  him  during  an  argument.  Although
Applicant admitted the allegation in his SOR answer, at his hearing, he had no recollection
of  the  incident.  In  his  2010  and  2011  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  he
disclosed his wife hit him and he hit her back. She called the police. The charges were
dropped  by his wife  and  the  court. He  attended  a  battered  women’s course at  a family
counseling center one night a week for about two months. This was not court ordered. At
his hearing, he denied he hit his wife. (Tr. 62-63, 106; GE 6, AE I)
In about May 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault
with a weapon. He was arrested after a motorist described a vehicle matching Applicant’s
vehicle and identified Applicant in a police line-up as the person who pointed the firearm
at him from another vehicle. Applicant believes he was falsely identified. Applicant denied
he  owned  a firearm  and  none  was  found  in his vehicle  or retrieved  from his house  as
evidence. He denied that he was involved in this altercation. Applicant and his wife were
moving that day and were together. He testified that he had lent his vehicle to his brother-
in-law, who is similar in stature. He told this to his lawyer. His brother-in-law was never
questioned. Applicant explained that his lawyer told him that he had a 50-50 chance of
winning or losing the case, it would be expensive, and since he had a security clearance
to  not  take  any  chances  and  plead  no  contest,  which  he  did.  The  charge  was  nolle
prosequi, and he participated in a pretrial diversion program. He was required to complete
50 hours of community service. The charge was dismissed in 2004. (Tr. 63-71, 96-106,
163; GE 4, 6; AE J)
In  1997,  Applicant  was  charged  with  domestic  battery.  He  could  not  recall  the
incident.  The  offense  is  not  listed  on  Applicant’s  FBI  report.  Applicant  admitted  this
allegation in his answer to the SOR. Court records show the offense was nolle prosequi
in October 2001. (Tr. 71-73, 95-96; AE K)
More  than  ten  years  ago,  Applicant  participated  in  counseling  associated  with
stress and completed the program. The facility does not retain records past ten years and
he  could  not  recall  the  exact  dates.  He  attended  anger  management  classes  in
approximately 2004-2005 and marriage counseling during the same period of time. He
indicated he gained valuable insight from the counseling. (Tr. 113-117; GE 3)
In November 2020, Applicant participated in an anger management assessment.
The assessment was done by a psychologist, who holds a Ph.D. and is a licensed marital
and  family  therapist.  Applicant  stated  that  after  receiving  the  SOR  it  prompted  him  to
reach out to have the assessment. He did it on his own volition. The psychologist did not
have  information  about  his past  domestic  violence  allegations from  Applicant’s  record,
and Applicant did not provide it to her. Her opinion is based solely on psychological tests
she  had  Applicant  complete.  Applicant  had high  scores  in  areas  that  indicate a  strong
understanding and  mastery of  different  skills sets,  some  of  which  manage  and  control
anger, stress, and aggressive  or disruptive  behavior.  He  showed  a  low score  in  areas
indicating little tendency to behave in an attacking manner and he had good boundary
skills with others. His scores reflected he was satisfied with his behavior and had a lower
level of motivation to change. The psychologist’s recommendation was: No further anger
management treatment recommended at this time. (Tr. 117, 153-155; AE M)
Applicant saw a mental health therapist (JPD) in November 2020 who specializes
in family counseling.  JPD  testified and  was  told  by Applicant he needed  an evaluation
and  letter  for  his  security  clearance  issues.  JPD  found  Applicant  sincere,  and  they
discussed  Applicant’s life  traumas and  coping  mechanism. JPD was aware of  some  of
Applicant’s past issues, but not all of them. He was unaware of the 2018 allegations or
the more dated allegations. Applicant explained the reason he provided the 2013 incident
was because that was the one he remembered. Applicant did not disclose the other SOR
allegations. JPD and Applicant had approximately eight counseling sessions. JPD opined
that Applicant had the tools to make good decisions and he accepted responsibility  for
his actions. Applicant was provided tools for looking at things from a different perspective
and coping mechanisms. JPD did not provide a formal diagnosis. He believed Applicant
to be sincere and trusted him to make good decisions. (Tr. 145-153; 213-232; AE L)
Since the last domestic violence incident in 2018, Applicant said there have been
family changes. LM is divorced from S, which caused great strife within the family. He
does not visit and is not part of their lives. Applicant has had a more active positive role
in helping raise his grandchildren. Since being diagnosed with diabetes he is on a strict
diet and exercise program. He and his family have taken steps to mitigate and ensure
there will be no future incidents and improved their communication skills. (GE 3)
Applicant’s Facility Security Officer testified on his behalf. He has known him for a
couple years.  He has had frequent interaction  with  Applicant.  He has  never witnessed
any aggressive behavior by Applicant  nor has he seen Applicant involved in a security
incident. Applicant is honest and reliable. Applicant has advised him of his past arrests.
He  does  not  have  security  concerns  about  Applicant.  He  was  aware  of  the  SOR
allegations. (Tr. 236-246)
Other  witnesses
testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  They  have  known  him
professionally  and  personally,  dating  back  to  1998.  They  all  had  varying  degrees  of
interaction with him, but all knew him very well. Some knew his family. None had concerns
about Applicant’s past  incidents  regarding  domestic violence.  None  had  ever observed
Applicant be aggressive or lose his temper. They have not observed him overindulge in
alcohol, nor do they believe he has a problem with alcohol. They did not have a concern
about  his  honesty,  integrity  or  trustworthiness.  He  has  treated  others  with  dignity  and
respect. He is considered a hard-worker and family-oriented. (Tr. 247-278)
Applicant  provided  numerous  documents  to  corroborate  his  outstanding  career
performance. He provided copies of certificates for awards he has received and training
he has completed. (AE S, T, U, V)
Applicant provided numerous character letters that attest that he is professional,
trusted, respected, honest, patriotic, and ethical. He takes responsibility for his actions.
He is a person of good character and has  integrity, He has an outstanding work ethic.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.a-1.g,
2.a-2.d, 3.a, and 3.b. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶ 4.a and 4.b. His admissions in
his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 62-year-old instrument repairer employed by a defense contractor
since September 1982. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 1978 to
August 1982. He married in November 1990.
Applicant  received  a security clearance  shortly after he  was  hired by a  defense
contractor in September 1982. (GX 5 at 2.) He applied to continue his clearance in June
2008. His application was denied in September 2008 after a hearing by an administrative
judge. (GX 5.) He applied again in March 2012, and his application was denied. (GX 1 at
32.). After he reapplied in 2013, his security clearance was reinstated.
In January 1990, Applicant was charged with felony possession of marijuana with
intent to distribute. At the hearing, he testified that he was riding in a car with two other
individuals, but he did not know that the driver had marijuana in the car. (Tr. 33-34.) The
record  indicates  that  he  was  represented  by  an  attorney  and  pleaded  guilty  to  a
misdemeanor  to  avoid  risking  a  jail  sentence.  He  was  convicted  of  misdemeanor
possession of marijuana and was fined. (GX 5 at 2.)
In October 1994, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana. He testified
that he was visiting a young woman outside an apartment complex. He gave the woman
his  jacket  because  it  was  cold.  She  walked  inside  the  apartment  complex  and  then
returned, wearing the jacket. While she was inside, security guards challenged Applicant
for being in the apartment complex and asked for identification. His identification was in
his  car,  but  he  responded  that  he  did  not  have  any  identification.  After  Applicant  was
arrested  for  trespassing,  the  young  woman  gave  his  jacket  to  the  police,  who  found
marijuana  in  the  pocket.  (Tr.  35-39.)  Court  records  reflect  that  he  pleaded  guilty  to
misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Although he testified that he was also convicted
of trespassing, a trespassing charge is not reflected in the record. He was sentenced to
30 days in jail (suspended) and fined $100 (GX 4 at 13.)
In August 1998, Applicant was stopped for making an illegal stop on a highway to
let a passenger out of his vehicle. His arrest occurred during a time that a labor strike was
ongoing. He submitted to a breathalyzer and was charged with driving under the influence
of  alcohol  (DUI).  (Tr.  41-42.)  He  was  convicted  and  required  to  attend  an  alcohol-
education program once a week for six months. (GX 5 at 3.) He completed the program
as required. (Tr. 42.)
In  September  2000,  Applicant  was  charged  with  felony  possession  of  cocaine.
During  his  September  2019  security  interview,  he  told  an  investigator  that  a  bag
containing a few rocks of cocaine was found nearby in a parking lot. During the interview
and at his hearing, he denied that the cocaine was his. (GX 2 at 15; Tr. 42-43.) He pleaded
not guilty, but he was convicted and sentenced to five years in jail (suspended) and one
year of supervised probation. (GX 4 at 11.)
In July 2009, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana, drunk in public
and  felony  assault  on  a  law  enforcement  officer.  He  testified  that  one  of  his  sons  had
hidden a marijuana cigarette in the garage. When he found it, he confronted his son while
holding it in his hand. He had consumed alcohol and admitted that he was “a little irate.”
A police officer approached and told Applicant he needed to go into the house. The record
does not reflect what caused the police officer to approach the house. Applicant told the
police officer that he was in his own yard and that he would not go into the house. The
factual  basis  for  charging  him  with  felony  assault  on  a  law  enforcement  officer  is  not
reflected in the record. The charges of marijuana possession and drunk in public were
disposed  of  by  nolle  prosequi.  Pursuant  to  a  plea  agreement,  he  was  convicted  of
misdemeanor  assault  and  battery  and  sentenced  to  180  days  in  jail,  with  160  days
suspended. (GX 4 at 5.) He served his jail time on weekends. He testified that the charge
of felony assault was in  retribution  for “talking  back” to  the  police  officer, and his guilty
plea  to  misdemeanor  assault  and  battery  was  a  non-negotiable  element  of  his  plea
agreement. (Tr. 50-51.)
In  March  2016,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI  and  refusing a  blood or breath
test. At the hearing, he testified that he hit a broken drainage grate in the road and ran
into a retaining wall. The airbags went off and he was stunned. He had no memory of
refusing a blood or breath test. He told a security investigator that he requested a blood
test,  which  was  refused.  (GX  2  at  12.)  He  pleaded  guilty  to  reckless  driving  and  was
sentenced to 12 months in jail (suspended), unsupervised probation for two years, and a
$250 fine. He was required to participate in 26-week substance-abuse program, which he
completed. (GX 2 at 10; GX 4 at 1-2.) The charge of refusing a blood or breath test was
disposed of by nolle prosequi. (GX 4 at 3) He testified that he did not inform his employer
about this incident because he was convicted only of reckless driving and not an alcohol-
related conviction.
Applicant testified that he usually consumed two or three beers a day before the
March 2016 incident. Now that he has started attending church, he seldom drinks beer,
but when he does, it is not more than two beers. He last consumed two beers at a wedding
on the weekend before his hearing. He has not received any treatment for alcohol use
since  he  completed  the  court-ordered  26-week  program  after  his  conviction  in  March
2016. The program included attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but he did
not actively participate in the meetings or continue his attendance after completing the
program. (Tr. 60-63.)
On July 4, 2019, Applicant used cocaine at a party, and he subsequently tested
positive for cocaine on a urinalysis test. He held an active security clearance at the time.
During a security interview in September 2019, he told an investigator that he had invited
friends to join him for a July 4 party, that a friend brought cocaine to the party, and that
he snorted two lines of his friend’s cocaine at the party. At the hearing, Applicant testified
that his use of cocaine was not due to peer pressure, but “just a little stupidity” on his part.
(Tr. 68-69.) After he tested positive  in  the  urinalysis,  he  was  referred  to the Employee
Assistance  Program.  He  was  enrolled  in  a  six-week  program  at  a  behavioral  health
facility,  which  he  successfully  completed.  (GX  2  at  14)  The  SOR  alleges  that  he  was
diagnosed with cocaine use disorder (moderate), and Applicant admitted the allegation-
in his answer to the SOR. However, at the hearing, he testified that he was unaware of
any diagnosis. There is no evidence of a diagnosis in the record. Applicant testified that
the friend who brought cocaine to the party lives in another area and it has been years
since they have had any contact. (Tr. 68.) He testified that he no longer associates with
drug-users. (Tr. 92.)
When Applicant submitted his most recent SCA in February 2019, he answered
“No” to the questions in Section 22, which included asking if he had ever been charged
with any felony offense and if he had ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol
or drugs. He also answered “No” to the questions in Section 23, asking if he had illegally
used any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years, if he had ever used or
otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security
clearance,  and  if  he  had  ever  been  ordered,  advised  or  asked  to  seek  counseling  or
treatment as a result of illegal use of drugs or controlled substances. (GX 1 at 27.) He did
not  disclose  that  he  was  charged  with  felony  possession  of  marijuana  with  intent  to
distribute  in  January  1990,  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana  in  October  1994,
charged  with  DUI  in  August  1998,  charged  with  felony  possession  of  cocaine  in
September 2000, charged with possession of marijuana in July 2009, charged with being
drunk  in  public  in  2009,  and  charged  with  felony  possession  of  cocaine  in  September
2000.
Applicant’s  testimony  regarding  his  failures  to  disclose  his  drug  and  alcohol
involvement in his February 2019 SCA, Department Counsel’s cross-examination about
his non-disclosure, and Applicant’s responses to cross-examination were repetitive and
circular, with both parties talking past each other and apparently not understanding each
other. However, the following facts were established. Applicant was generally familiar with
the security-clearance process. He received a security clearance around 1983. He had
previously submitted two paper versions of the SCA in 2006 and 2008 and two electronic
versions in 2013 and 2019. He found the completion of an SCA “really hard stuff” and he
had  been  “pinged” by an  administrative  judge  in 2008  for not disclosing  all  his criminal
conduct.  (Tr. 78;  GX 5 at 3.) He had admitted  during his 2008 hearing that he did not
report his criminal conduct because he was embarrassed. (Tr. 44; GX 5 at 3.) The record
does not reflect what Applicant disclosed in the SCAs he submitted in 2012 and 2013. He
testified that when he was filling out the 2019 SCA, he asked a woman, whose identity
and duties are not reflected in the record, whether he  needed to “go  all the  way back.”
The woman replied that she did not know. Applicant  testified that he believed  that “the
government” already knew about his criminal record, and so he did not disclose it in the
SCA. (Tr. 73-75.).
During  a  follow-up  interview  in  September  2019,  Applicant  initially  denied  any
illegal  drug  use  during  the  past  seven  years.  After  the  investigator  asked  him  about
involvement  in  any  drug  incidents  at  work,  he  disclosed  his  cocaine  use  and  positive
urinalysis in July 2019. (GX 2 at 14; Tr. 89.)
At the hearing, Applicant attributed some of his criminal record to racism, resulting
in  arrests  and  charges  that  would  otherwise  have  not  occurred.  (Tr.  19-24.)  I  have
considered his concern, especially with respect to his arrest for marijuana possession in
January 1990, his arrest for trespassing in October 1994, his arrest for making an illegal
stop on a highway in 1998, and his arrest for being drunk in public in July 2009.
In May 2019, Applicant was selected by his employer as an “Excellence in Action”
honoree for his outstanding performance of duty. (AX F.) In September 2020, he received
an  “on-the-spot”  recognition  certificate  for  “honesty  and  integrity  when  no  one  was
looking.”  He  had  raised  a  “red  flag”  on  a  ship’s  hull  after  noticing  that  cables  were
damaged. (AX A.)
Applicant’s  general  foreman  attested  to  his  unquestionable  integrity,  technical
knowledge, deck-plate experience, and leadership. (AX E.) A coworker who has known
Applicant  for  almost  40  years  describes  him  as  dependable,  responsible,  honest,
talented, and patriotic. (AX G.) Another coworker who has known Applicant for 32 years
admires  his  technical  experience,  leadership,  and  commitment  to  his  job.  (AX  H.)  A
coworker who has known Applicant for 18 years considers him the subject matter expert
in their shop, a caring coworker, and a person of honesty and integrity. (AX J.) Another
coworker who has worked with Applicant for three years similarly attests to his loyalty,
reliability,  and  technical  skills.  (AX  I.)  Applicant’s  pastor  describes  him  as  a  devoted
husband,  a  loving  father,  and  “an  extremely  humble,  considerate,  and  trustworthy
person.” (AX B.) A church member who has known him for five years regards him as loyal
and dependable, with great interpersonal skills (AX D.) A personal friend who has known
Applicant for more than 30 years considers him an honest, trustworthy, and dependable
person.  (AX  C.)  Applicant  testified  that  the  individuals  submitting  letters  on  his  behalf
might know about his past, but they probably do not know about his criminal convictions.

"Applicant is a 44-year-old single mother of two children, ages 20 and 17. Applicant
has been married twice previously. Her children are from her first marriage. She earned an
associate  degree  in 1999  and  she  earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in 2006. She  has been
working with her current employer, a defense contractor, since 2017.
Applicant is highly respected on the job and in her community. According to the
person  who  has  supervised  her  since  2017,  Applicant  is  a  trustworthy  employee  who
“completes  all  of  her  work  requirements  and  has  an  excellent  work  record.”  (Tr.  50)
Moreover, she characterized Applicant as “a high contributor who adds excellent value to
the  team.” (Tr. 48)  All  of  Applicant’s annual evaluations since  beginning  work with  her
current employer have been stellar. (AE K – AE M) Per a coworker, Applicant is “everything
you could hope for in a co-worker,” and demonstrates sound judgement in her research
and analytical assessments. (AE E)
Applicant has a  drinking  problem. She  began  drinking  alcohol in 2007. At that time,
she drank “a couple of drinks a couple nights per week,” primarily to help her sleep. (Tr.
111;  Answer  at  1) Her drinking   gradually   increased   over the   years. By   2014,  she   was
drinking up to eight shots of  vodka  daily, and  drinking  continuously  from  6  pm, when  she
came   home   from   work,  to   bedtime.  (Tr.  114;  187)  Alcohol  use   contributed   to   the
deterioration  of her marriage. (GE 2 at 28)
One night in July 2016, Applicant fell down the steps in her home while intoxicated.
(GE 2 at 38) She required emergency medical treatment. (Id.)  For the next few months,
Applicant tried to reduce her alcohol consumption, but was unsuccessful. In October 2016,
she voluntarily enrolled in an intensive outpatient alcohol treatment program. (Answer at 1;
Tr. 73) Such programs are less intensive than an inpatient program, but more intensive
than a traditional outpatient program. (GE 3) She attended the program for three months.
While receiving treatment, a psychologist diagnosed her with alcohol dependence. (GE 2 at
39; Answer at 1)
Applicant’s  outpatient  program
included  group  counseling  and  alcoholics
anonymous  (AA)  meetings.  (GE  2  at  8,  15)  While  abstinent  from  alcohol,  Applicant
experienced  “normal  recovery  symptoms,”  including  emotional  outbursts,  decreased
appetite, and weight loss. (GE 2 at 32) She was actively involved in group therapy, offering
constructive and valuable feedback to other group members. (GE 2 at 14)
During New Year’s Eve of 2016, while out of town, Applicant drank two cocktails.
(Tr. 86) She was still working with the intensive outpatient program at the time. Applicant
characterized  her  decision  to  have  the  drinks  as  “somewhat  intentional.”  (Tr.  87)  By
February 2017, Applicant began to believe that she had overcome her addiction to alcohol.
(Tr. 142)
In April 2017, Applicant resumed drinking alcohol. (Tr. 90) By this time, she had
enrolled in another alcohol-addiction recovery program. (Tr. 91) Unlike AA, it was secular,
and  per  Applicant,  it  was  based  upon  developing  the  ability  to  consume  alcohol  in  “a
responsible way,” as opposed to abstaining from alcohol, as prescribed by the intensive
outpatient program. (Tr. 91) She found what she understood to be the moderation model to
be better than the abstinence model. Specifically, she found the faith-based AA component
to be ineffective. (Tr. 87) Her opinion about the inefficiency of faith-based alcohol recovery
programs is supported by research. Specifically, a study published in Journal of Substance
Abuse Treatment concluded that individuals with a more secular worldview may find it
difficult to fit into a spiritually-based recovery program and are more likely to be engaged in
a secular group, “thus improving the prognosis for long-term abstinence.” (AE K at 3)
Under the moderation model, users plan how many drinks they are going to have in
a week, together with the days that they are going to drink. (Tr. 93, 161) They then record
their drinking on an app and record whether they are on target or over target. (AE O) Using
this model, Applicant has been consuming approximately  one to two drinks per sitting,
three days per week. (Tr. 163) She has not been intoxicated since the incident when she
fell down the stairs.
Contrary  to  Applicant’s  testimony,  the  alcohol-addiction  program  that  she  is
participating  in  is  not  moderation-based.  Rather,  per  the  program’s  online  profile,  it  is
“organized to support people who have chosen to abstain or who are considering doing
so.” (GE 7) Furthermore, the program’s online profile states, as follows:
Despite   participant  statements  about  ‘cutting   back’  or  moderating,  the
working  time   of   the   meeting[s]  [are]  devoted  to   how   to   achieve
abstinence . . .  (GE 7) (emphasis added by publisher of online profile)
Another Smart Recovery program outline, submitted by Applicant’s counsel,
states that Applicant’s recovery plan is equally effective as conventional programs in
helping people overcome alcohol disorders. (AE N) Per the manager, a licensed
social  worker  with  the  outpatient  treatment  program  that  Applicant  attended
between  2016  and  2017,  “if  you  were  diagnosed  with  the  chronic  disease  of
addiction/alcoholism,  one  is  never  cured.”  (GE  4)  Such  people  need  ongoing
recovery activities, including maintaining abstinence. (GE 4)
Applicant has been seeing her family doctor since 2006. (AE P) He is aware
that she participated in an intensive outpatient program for alcohol dependency.
She continues to have regular follow-up visits with him. Per the family doctor, she
“does not currently have a diagnosis of alcohol dependency . . . , is maintaining a
safe and healthy lifestyle,” and has no indicators of high-risk behaviors or substance

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c and the cross-allegation, SOR ¶ 2.a; and he
denied SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old. He has been married to his second wife since 1998. He
has  two  grown  children  from  his  first  marriage  and  he  and  his  wife  have  two  teenage
children together. After high school, he served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from
1981 to 2002, retiring as a master sergeant (E-7). Since 2002, he has been employed
as an avionics manager for a defense contractor.  He has held a security clearance for
about 40 years, since his time in the Air Force, without incident. (Tr. 26-31, 68-69, 81;
GE 1; GE 3)
In early January 2017, Applicant went out drinking with some friends. He had two
drinks  at  a  bar,  came  home,  and  drank  some  more.  His  wife  and  daughters  became
concerned about his excessive alcohol use and drove him to the hospital. (GE 2, GE 3)
Hospital  records  reflect  that  Applicant  was  examined  and  diagnosed  with  acute
alcohol  intoxication  and  alcohol  use  disorder.  Notes  also  reflect  that  the  treating
physician had a lengthy discussion with Applicant and his family about his alcohol level
and  abnormal  liver  function  tests.  At  the  time,  Applicant  indicated  that  he  was
concerned  about  seeking  alcohol  treatment  due  to  fear  of  losing  his  job.  Notes  reflect
that  he  consumed  one  or  two  bottles  of  wine  daily  at  that  time  and  that,  though  he
wanted  help,  he  was  not  ready  to  stop  drinking.  He  was  discharged  and  advised  to
follow up with his doctor, and to pursue outpatient alcohol treatment.  (GE 2 at 6-7, 39,
GE 3) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b)
Applicant  did  not  pursue  alcohol  treatment  following  his  2017  ER  visit.  His
primary care doctor later told him to stop drinking and Applicant attempted to lessen his
drinking gradually. He said he  got down  to  two  beers and  then  “shot myself  in  the  foot
and almost blew it.” (Tr. 57, 60) A follow-up visit in 2018 with the same doctor he saw in
his 2017 ER visit (Dr. A) reflects that she questioned his judgment, as he knew he had a
problem with alcohol yet was not doing anything to address it. (GE 3 at 3, 5)
Applicant  testified   that   he   first  consumed   alcohol  at  age   18,  in  the   military.  He
often  drank beer and  wine  overseas, where social drinking  was commonplace. Records
reflect  that   between   1997   and   2017,   he   drank  beer   and   wine,  mostly   on   weekends.
During   his  hearing   testimony,  Applicant  acknowledged   that  he   had   been   drinking   too
much, and  had  not been  ready  to  stop  drinking, calling   himself  “hard-headed.” (Tr. 31-
34, 47-53, 57-59, 70;  GE 3)
In March 2020, at the DOD CAF’s request, Applicant participated in an evaluation
by  a  licensed  clinical  psychologist.  (GE  3,  GE  4)  The  evaluator  reviewed  his  medical
records from his 2017 ER visit, other medical records, his security clearance paperwork,
and  conducted  a  clinical  interview  and  appropriate  testing  of  Applicant.  The  evaluator
noted  that  Applicant  “has  a  habit  of  severely  minimizing  his  history  of  alcohol  abuse,”
including the events surrounding his 2017 ER visit, which he failed to mention, and any
periods when he drank excessively, which he denied. (GE 3 at 3, 5)
As  Applicant’s  provider  did  in  2018,  the  evaluator  expressed  concerns  about
Applicant’s  insight  and  judgment,  lack  of  treatment,  and  ongoing  alcohol  consumption
with  no  plan  or  intent  to  abstain.  She  diagnosed  Applicant  with  severe  alcohol  use
disorder, with a guarded prognosis. (GE 3 at 5) She found that his condition “may make
him  prone  to  lapses  of  judgment,  thereby  posing  a  risk  to  his  reliability  and/or
trustworthiness concerning classified information.” (GE 3 at 6) (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 2.a)
In  early  July  2020,  at  the  advice  of  his  family,  Applicant  voluntarily  entered  an
inpatient  substance  abuse  treatment  program.  Applicant  testified  that  he  remained  at
the  facility,  and  in  the  program,  an  extra  two  weeks,  until  he  was  discharged
successfully  in  mid-August  2020.  The  program  was  designed  to  integrate  participants
into  Alcoholics  Anonymous  and  its  12-step  program,  with  daily  meetings  and
sponsorship. (Tr. 36-38, 73; AE B)
Applicant’s  case  manager  at  the  facility  noted  that  he  was  an  “absolute  joy”  to
work  with;  he  was  consistently  attentive,  cooperative,  and  respectful,  and  appreciative
of  the  opportunity  to  learn,  grow,  and  change.  The  case  manager  gave  him  what  was
essentially  a  positive  prognosis,  assuming  he  remained  clean  and  sober.  He  was
advised  to meet with  his primary care  physician, a  counselor,  and his sponsor, and to
continue 12-step AA meetings daily for 90 days. (AE B)
Shortly  thereafter,  in  late  August  2020,  Applicant  began  meeting  with  a
counselor, a licensed clinical social worker. They had 28 sessions over the next year, as
of  August  2021.  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  adjustment  disorder  and  mixed  anxiety
and  depressed  mood,  as  well  as  alcohol  use  disorder,  in  remission.  He  presented  as
“lucid,  calm,  and  cooperative  in each  of our teletherapy  sessions.” (AE  A;  Tr. 42-45) (I
note  that  these  teletherapy  sessions  took  place  during  the  ongoing  COVID-19
pandemic).
The counselor’s handwritten notes do not reflect information on Applicant’s then-
current drinking habits (if any), and a prognosis is not indicated. The document does not
address whether, and if so,  to  what extent,  the  fact  that Applicant’s condition is now in
remission  has  impacted  his  judgment,  reliability,  or  trustworthiness  with  respect  to
classified information. (AE A)
Prior  to  his  March  2020  evaluation,  Applicant  had  never  had  any  alcohol
treatment or other professional counseling. He acknowledged that his several attempts
to curtail his drinking on his own were unsuccessful. He went to inpatient rehabilitation
(in  July  2020)  because  he  finally  recognized  that  he  needed  help.  He  said  he  was
comfortable there because the center has military clientele.  He said this treatment was
“the answer.” (Tr. 71) He reported his inpatient treatment to his supervisor at work and
said they were “very understanding.” Tr. 60-64)
Applicant acknowledged that he had continued drinking after he was diagnosed
with severe alcohol use disorder, in March 2020. (SOR ¶ 1.d) However, he said that he
had  not  consumed  alcohol  at  all  since  before  he  entered  inpatient  treatment  in  July
2020.  By  the  time  the  record  closed,  he  had  abstained  from  alcohol  for  one  year  and
eight months. (Tr. 35-36, 46, 78; AE J)
Applicant testified  that  he  has  no  alcohol  in his house.  He  takes no  medication  to
treat his alcohol issues. He has never had  an  alcohol-related  arrest or driving  offense,
such as a  DUI,  and  he  has never had  an  alcohol-related  incident  at work. (Tr. 59-60,  64-
65, 70)
Applicant testified that he had been going to AA with a sponsor, several nights a
week for 10-12 months (Aug 2020 to summer 2021), then backed off to a few nights a
week,  due  to  the  pandemic  and  also  due  to  a  shift  change  at  work  in  fall  2021.  He
attended  AA  once  in  January  2022,  but  not  since  then.  (Tr.  38-42,  73-75)  He  said  he
has a sponsor, and intended to resume counseling and AA attendance. (Tr. 65-66)
After the hearing, Applicant re-contacted his counselor and indicated an interest
in  resuming  monthly  sessions  with  her.  She  responded  and  indicated  that  she  was
retiring,  but  that  he  would  be  contacted  by  a  new  therapist.  (AE  G)  Applicant  had  not
participated in counseling with his therapist since about August 2021. (AE A, AE H) In
late February 2022, Applicant also resumed participation in AA and contact with his AA
sponsor. (AE I)
Applicant’s  work  evaluations  (2018-2021)  show  that  he  is  regarded  as  being
instrumental  to  the  overall  success  of  the  mission.  He  is  a  model  employee  has  an
aggressive  approach  that  achieves  remarkable  results.  He  consistently  achieves
outstanding  ratings.  He  maintains  responsibility  for  highly  sensitive  communications
equipment. A longtime employee asserted that Applicant is an exemplary manager. The
employee  credited  Applicant  with  asking  for  help  (with  his  alcohol  issues)  when  he
needed it. Applicant exhibits integrity, leadership, and mission awareness. He performs
his job well and can be trusted by the U.S. Government. (AE C – AE F)

(Items 3, 4)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  substance  abuse.  His  alcohol  use  resulted  in
community  service  for  an  open  container  citation  in  2014.  He  became  very  drunk  in
September 2015 after about 12 to 15 drinks. He engaged in a heated argument with his
ex-girlfriend; she slapped him; and he may have slapped her. She obtained a temporary
restraining order against him the next day. They were both college students, and their
university directed him to complete six months of counseling, which he did. (Items 2-4)
Applicant had about 15 drinks (beer and liquor) in July 2019. An ambulance took
him  to  the  hospital  for  severe  alcohol  intoxication.  He  was  given  fluids  at  the  hospital
and released on his own accord after several hours. Applicant continues to drink, but he
asserted  that  he  is  drinking  more  moderately,  and  he  never  drinks  and  drives.  He
admitted  that  he  still  occasionally  gets  drunk.  In  March  2021,  he  reported  that  he  last

Applicant  used  marijuana  from  about  December  2015  through  at  least  June
2019,  and  cocaine  from  about  2013  through  at  least  February  2019.  He  reported  his
alcohol  issues  and  his  marijuana  and  cocaine  use  on  a  Questionnaire  for  National
Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in May 2020. He indicated for both drugs that
his use was “Occasional use, socially. No more than once every few months.” He stated
that he intended to use the drugs in the future with the comment: “I would say there is a
possibility of future use were the situation to arise socially.” (Items 2-4)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  August  2020.  He
discussed his marijuana and cocaine use. He asserted that he stopped using the drugs
because  he  no  longer  had  the  desire  to  do  so.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  plan  to  use
illegal drugs in the future, but he could not guarantee that he would not. He stated that
in the right social setting, he would use both drugs in the future. (Item 4)
Applicant  responded  to  interrogatories  in  March  2021.  He  certified  that  he  had
not  used  any  illegal  drugs  since  June  2019.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  continue  to
associate  with  individuals  who  used  illegal  drugs,  and  he  did  not  intend  to  use  illegal
drugs in the future. Applicant admitted without further explanation SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d,

Applicant  has  a  history of  substance  abuse  and  criminal offenses  related  to  his
substance abuse. He became addicted to prescription opioid painkillers after he injured
his  back  sometime  between  about  2008  and  2011,  resulting  in  significant  pain.  The
physician’s  assistant  who  prescribed
for
overprescribing “oxycodone, hydrocodone, and other controlled substances” to patients
he  was  treating  for pain  management.  Applicant’s  addiction  led  to doctor shopping for
prescriptions,  alcohol  abuse,  employment  issues,  marital  difficulties,  and  financial
problems. In addition to the opioid painkillers, he would sometimes drink between a pint
and  a  fifth  of  vodka  a  day  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  3.a).  (Tr.  at  18-38,  82-96,  126;  Applicant’s
response to SOR, attachments A, F, P, S; GE 1, 2)
the  medication  was
later  sanctioned
Applicant was arrested in May 2013 and charged with two felony counts of falsely
obtaining  a  prescription  in  December  2012  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  2.c).  The  essence  of  the
offense is that he obtained a prescription for a controlled substance from one provider
without  informing  the  provider  that  he  also  received  the  controlled  substance  from
another source. He pleaded guilty on June 11, 2013, to falsely obtaining a prescription.
The second count was dismissed. He was sentenced to up to five years in prison, which
was  suspended  upon  his  completion  of  probation  for  36  months,  and  included
conditions  that  he  complete  substance  abuse  treatment,  and  not  possess  or  use
controlled  substances  or  alcohol.  The  felony  was  reduced  by  the  court  to  a
misdemeanor  in  December  2017.  (Tr.  at  38-41;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,
attachments A, G, H, N, P; GE 1-3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  August  2013  and  charged  with  six  felony  counts  of
falsely obtaining a prescription between April 1, 2013, and June 10, 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b,
2.c).  He  pleaded  guilty  in  October  2013  to  three  felony  counts  of  falsely  obtaining  a
prescription.  The  three  remaining  counts  were  dismissed.  In  January  2014,  he  was
sentenced  to  up  to  five  years  in  prison  and  $15,000  in  fines.  The  prison  term  and
$14,397  of  the  fine  were  suspended  upon  his  completion  of  probation  for  36  months.
Conditions  of  his  probation  included  a  drug  and  alcohol  evaluation  and  completion  of
any  recommended  substance  abuse  treatment,  and  to  not  possess  or  use  controlled
substances  or  alcohol.  The  felonies  were  reduced  by  the  court  to  misdemeanors  in
February 2018. (Tr. at 38-41, 98; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachments A, H, N, P;
GE 1-3)
Applicant  continued  to  abuse  opioid  painkillers  and  alcohol  notwithstanding  the
two  convictions  and  probation.  He  completed  a  36-day  inpatient  substance  abuse
treatment  program  from  about  February  2014  to  April  2014.  He  reported  that  he  was
drinking between a pint and a fifth of vodka a day  with the opioids. He was diagnosed
with  alcohol  dependence  and  opioid  dependence  (SOR  ¶¶  2.d,  3.a,  3.b).  He  was
advised  to  remain  abstinent  from  alcohol  and  recommended  upon  discharge  for
aftercare  and  outpatient  treatment.  (Tr.  at  40-43,  96;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,
attachments I, P, R, S; GE 2, 5)
Applicant  did  not  follow  through  on  aftercare  or  outpatient  treatment,  and  he
relapsed after leaving the treatment facility. He found that alcohol enhanced the effects
of the opioids. He was driving under the influence of opioids and alcohol when he  was
arrested in May 2014. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was about two and a half
times  the  legal limit.  He  was  charged  with  driving under the  influence  of  alcohol/drugs
(DUI). He pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of impaired driving in May 2014. He was
sentenced to 90 days in jail, with the 90 days suspended, and a fine (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 3.b,
3.c). (Tr. at 42-46, 102-103; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachment J; GE 1-3, 5)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  found  in  violation  of  his  probation  for  the  2013
convictions,  and  his  probation  was  revoked  and  restarted.  He  was  sentenced  to  150
days  in  jail  for  the  June  2013  conviction,  with  all  but  three  weeks  served  at  a  work
release facility (SOR ¶ 1.d). He was sentenced to 365 days in jail for the August 2013
conviction, with all but three weeks served at a work release facility (SOR ¶ 1.e). (Tr. at
47-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
After  he  completed  the  work-release  program,  Applicant  resumed  abusing
alcohol  and  opioids,  including  oxycodone,  morphine,  and  fentanyl  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b).
From about April 2015 to June 2015, he used heroin  during a period that he could not
obtain  the prescription opioids.  Heroin was  also  cheaper than the prescription opioids.
(SOR  ¶  2.e).  In  June  2015,  he  checked  into  the  same  substance  abuse  treatment
facility for inpatient treatment for 45 days. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence
and  opioid  dependence  (SOR  ¶¶  2.f,  3.d).  The  facility  certified  that  he  successfully
completed the inpatient program in July 2015. He was then provided a 45-day aftercare
program. He was advised to remain abstinent from alcohol and opioids. In August 2015,
he successfully completed a workout-based life coaching program. (Tr. at 49-50, 51-57,
59, 97-99; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachments K, L, P, R, S; GE 2, 5)
Applicant did not use heroin after his discharge from the facility, but he returned
to  abusing  alcohol  and  opioids,  including  fentanyl  (SOR  ¶  2.b).  He  was  again  driving
under the influence of opioids and alcohol when he was arrested in December 2015. His
BAC  was  about  two  times  the  legal  limit.  He  was  charged  with  DUI  and  alcohol-
restricted  driver.  In  March  2016,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI,  and  the  alcohol-restricted
driver charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to four days in jail and a fine (SOR  ¶
1.c). (Tr. at 51-55, 102-103; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachment M; GE 4)
There  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  has  used  any  illegal  controlled  substances
after 2016. His  parents,  who  could  always  tell when  he  was  using,  have not observed
any indication of use in years. He returned to the workout-based program in 2016. He
enrolled  in  a  90-day  workout  and  addiction-recovery  program  in  March  2019.  The
program  “requires  at  least  90  days  of  commitment  to  strenuous  activity,  dedication  to
sobriety, and active involvement in [their] fitness, nutritional, spiritual, and life coaching
curriculum.”  He  continues  to  be  actively  involved  in  the  program,  and  he  sees  a
therapist   unrelated   to   that  program.  He   has  learned   to   deal  with   his  back  pain   with
ibuprofen   and   an   active   lifestyle.   He  is  motivated   by   his  children   and   his  faith   to   stay
clean.  He  has   disassociated   himself   from   drug-using   associates  and   contacts,  and   he
passed   numerous  drug   tests.   He  signed   a  statement  of  intent   to   abstain  from   all   drug
involvement  and   substance   misuse,  acknowledging   that  any   future  involvement  or
misuse  is grounds  for revocation  of national security  eligibility.  (Tr. at 59-65,  70-82,  100-

In  2020,  Applicant  was  prescribed  a  prescription  opioid  to  deal  with  pain  in  a
tooth before a root canal (SOR ¶ 4.a). He did not enjoy the experience and did not use
the  drugs  again  after  the  procedure  was  completed.  He  stated  that  he  has  not  had
cravings for opioids in four or five years, and the short use of a prescription medication
in 2020 did not change that. (Tr. at 67-70, 94-96; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant stated that he does not believe that alcohol was ever his real problem,
and  that  he  never  really  enjoyed  large  amounts  of  alcohol.  As  such,  he  does  not  feel
that  he  has  to  completely  abstain.  He  describes  his  drinking  as  occasional  and
responsible. He stated that his last drink was in November 2021 (SOR ¶ 3.f). (Tr. at 45,
50, 65-67; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August  2018.  He  reported  most  of  his  substance  abuse  and  criminal  history,  but  he
intentionally  failed  to  report  his  heroin  use  (SOR  ¶  4.b).  He  admitted  that  he  felt,  and
continues to feel, shame about his heroin use. (Tr. at 56-58, 103; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  June  2019.  He
discussed  his  addiction  to  opioid  painkillers,  including  oxycodone,  but  he  did  not
mention heroin use. He admitted heroin use in interrogatories in January 2020 after he
was specifically asked about heroin use as documented in records obtained by the DOD
from  the  substance  abuse  treatment  facility  where  Applicant  was  treated  in  2014  and
2015. He admitted at his hearing that if the DOD did not know about his heroin use, he
would  be  conflicted  and  it  would  be  very  hard  to  discuss  it,  even  at  his  hearing.  He
clarified that if he was directly asked about his heroin use, he would be honest.  (Tr. at

Applicant  called  three  witnesses,  and  he  submitted  documents  and  letters
attesting to his excellent job performance and strong moral character. He is praised for
his dedication, reliability, competence, enthusiasm, attention to detail, leadership, work
ethic,  trustworthiness,  and  integrity.  (Tr.  at  19-61;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,

policies  (SOR  ¶  3.a);  and  in  Section  22  inquiring  about  his  police  record,  he  failed  to
disclose information set forth under SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, related to 1996 to 2000
alcohol and domestic violence arrests (SOR ¶ 3.b). Applicant denied SOR ¶¶ 3.a and 3.b.
The  Government’s  exhibits  and  testimony  support  the  SOR  allegations,  except  as
specifically addressed below.
Applicant’s  criminal  history  began  in  1996  when  he  was  arrested  for  domestic
violence against his girlfriend at the time, who later became his spouse. He and his current
spouse  were  living together from 1996 to 2001, then again  in  2010.  Applicant testified
about an argument between him and his girlfriend after a football game where she was
the  aggressor,  he  called  the  police,  and  she  left  the  home.  However,  he  claims  they
arrested him because they spoke to him, he was the male, and he was considered the
“perpetrator.”  He was convicted  of inflicting corporal injury on a spouse/cohabitant  and
sentenced to 10 days’ confinement and three years’ probation.
In  1998  he  was  arrested  for  misdemeanor  minor  in  possession  of  liquor,
intimidating/stalking,  and  minor  driving  after  drinking.  He  was  found  guilty  of  minor  in
possession  and  driving  after  drinking,  and  sentenced  in  May  2000  to  five  days’
confinement  and  probation.  The  record  is  unclear  whether  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c  are
duplicates of the same offenses as asserted by the Applicant, and insufficient evidence
was introduced to made a determination, therefore SOR ¶ 1.c is found in Applicant’s favor.
In  September 2000,  Applicant  was arrested  for DUI and  DUI  with  a  BAC of  .10  or
more.   He  was  found   guilty   in  January   2001   and   sentenced   to   10   days’  confinement,
suspended. Then, in October 2001, he  was arrested  for felony  aggravated  assault with  a
deadly   weapon,  felony   burglary   in  the   1st   degree,  and   felony   aggravated   assault  –
entering  a  residence. He pleaded  guilty  to felony  aggravated  assault in December 2001,
and  was sentenced  to  three  months’ confinement and  three  years’  probation.   Applicant
claims he  entered  his girlfriend’s  residence  while  they  were fighting  and  he  was arrested.
He asserted  that he  and  his spouse, who  was his girlfriend  at the  time, argued  and  fought
often  after consuming  alcohol. He testified  that he  was permitted  into  his cousin’s home
and  confronted  his girlfriend  there,  and  pushed  her. In  his personal  subject  interview  (PSI)
(GE  2),  he   claimed   that  he   violated   probation   from   his  2000   DUI  conviction   for  not
completing  court-ordered  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) classes and  not checking  in with
his probation  officer as  directed. He also  violated  probation  for having  a  new  offense  in
2001.
In August 2002, Applicant violated probation and a bench warrant was issued for
his arrest. In December 2002, he was arrested in another state as a fugitive from justice
based on his bench warrant. His probation was revoked in February 2003, and he was
sentenced  to  serve  three  years’  confinement.  He  was  confined  from  2002  to  2005.
Applicant claimed he was homeless during this period and left the state with his mother
knowing that it violated his probation terms. He refused to follow the directions from his
probation officer in order to leave the state, and made a “decision right there on the spot
to go to [another state] with my mom” to keep his wife and kids off the street. (Tr. 49.) He
said the burglary, assault to enter a residence, and assault charges were reduced to one
domestic violence charge.
In  2007,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  inflicting  corporal  injury  on  a
spouse/cohabitant. He was with another girlfriend at the time, who he claimed would call
the police after every incident because she knew he was vulnerable to criminal charges.
They drank, argued, and fought. He claimed she drank more than him and was “acting
out,” so he told her to leave and she called the police. She failed to appear in court as the
complaining witness, so the case was dismissed.
In 2010, he was again arrested for inflicting corporal injury on spouse/cohabitant
and vandalism of $400 or more. He claims the charges resulted from another fight with
his girlfriend, who failed to appear in court as a complaining witness, and were dismissed.
In 2019, Applicant was arrested for DUI and DUI with a BAC of .08 or more after
returning from a “date night” outing with his spouse. In 2020, he pleaded guilty to DUI with
a  BAC  of  .08  or more,  and  was  sentenced  to  180  days’  confinement  and  three  years’
probation. He testified that his BAC was .14, despite his answer to the SOR where he
claimed he had “a drink with dinner” that evening. He served community service and his
sentence  to  confinement  was  suspended.  He  remains  on  probation  until  January  28,
2023.
No alcohol consumption is permitted while he is on probation. As a result, Applicant
stated since returning from prison, he only drank on “special occasions,” but he stopped
drinking after March 9, 2019, and denies having an alcohol disorder. (Ans.)
In  2017,  Applicant  completed  his  SCA  but  failed  to  disclose  his  charges  and
convictions involving domestic violence or alcohol or drugs as required in SCA Section
22 – Police Record. He testified that he read the questions as only asking about offenses
in the last seven years, not “ever” as indicated in questions regarding domestic violence
and  alcohol  offenses.  The  offenses  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.d  required
disclosure on the SCA, but Applicant did not list them. In his post-hearing submission, he
highlighted some areas on his SCA where he disclosed some items, but with reference
to the section asking about domestic violence or alcohol related charges, he changed his
“no” answer to “yes,” and wrote “mistake – sorry.” (AE A (SCA pages))
In addition, Applicant was terminated from employment in May 2016 for violation
of the company code of conduct and harassment policy. (GE 9) The company reported
that on May 11, 2016, Applicant was aggressive to and threatened another employee,
and referred to supervisors with inappropriate racial slurs. He was terminated on May 16,
2016.  Applicant  did  not  disclose  this  termination  on  his  2017  SCA  as  required  under
Section 13A - Employment Activities. Applicant testified that his employer’s termination
report was false, and he did not believe he was terminated, rather he was laid off and
received  unemployment  insurance  benefits.  In  a  post-hearing  exhibit,  he  provided
evidence  of receiving  $2,250  in  unemployment compensation.  The  document,  in  and  of
itself,  is  not  dipositive   as  to   whether  he   was  laid   off,  fired,  or  both.   He  admitted   in
testimony, that he  had  a  verbal altercation  with  his supervisor after he  was laid  off,  but
denied any verbal altercations or  use of  racial slurs about  his supervisors, but he  agreed
that  he  may  have  been  fired  after being  laid  off.  In  his PSI,  Applicant disclosed  that he
had  a  verbal altercation  with  his manager after being  laid  off, and  told him  to  “F---- off.”
As a  result, the  manager tried  to  deny  him  unemployment benefits,  but he  appealed  the
matter in “unemployment court” and was awarded  benefits. (GE 2)
The DCSA CAF referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation, which occurred
in September 2020. (GE 3) Despite claiming in testimony and in his answer to the SOR
that  he  stopped  drinking  in  2019,  the  psychologist  reported  that  he  stated  he  was
“currently”  consuming  alcohol  once  every  three  weeks  or  on  holidays  and  special
occasions, and consumes an average of four beers on those occasions. He denied ever
consuming alcohol in greater frequency than that, or that alcohol had ever impaired his
social, interpersonal, or occupational functioning.  The doctor noted that documentation
he reviewed showed Applicant reported consuming larger amounts in the past, including
consuming  12-18  beers  over  a  three-day  period,  and  the  impacts  alcohol  had  on  his
conflicts with his spouse. Applicant admitted in his 2018 PSI that from age 16 to 25, he
consumed 10 beers each day on weekends, and from age 25 to present, he consumed
18 beers on weekends over the entire weekend (Friday to Sunday).
Of note, the psychologist stated that Applicant admitted to a verbal altercation with
his supervisor, and that he was given a choice to work part-time or take unemployment
compensation.  He  chose  unemployment  compensation,  but  “received  a  letter  several
months  later  from  unemployment  services  stating  that  he  should  not  have  received
benefits due to him being ‘fired.’” Applicant told the doctor that he disputed the company’s
allegation  and  was  able  to  maintain  his  unemployment  benefits.  He  admitted  that  he
engaged in an altercation with a supervisor and cursed at him, but vehemently denied
using any racial language. (GE 3, p.2)
Applicant reported participating in several anger management classes but did not
complete the courses. He and his girlfriend also participated in about five to six counseling
sessions.  Applicant  also  noted  he  did  not  like  the  constant  oversight  and  invasion  of
privacy that came with being on probation, which led to him avoiding his probation officer
and eventual probation violation.
The  psychologist  determined  that  Applicant  is  not  currently  experiencing  any
significant psychological symptoms that would disqualify him from being able to hold a
security clearance, however, his history of  sustained alcohol use across his  lifespan is
indicative of an alcohol use disorder. Applicant’s examination showed that he answered
questions with a “high degree of defensiveness” and he attempted to portray himself as
being free of faults and managed the impressions and denials he gave to minimize “even
the most common shortfalls” to a degree well outside the expected range. It was noted
that  Applicant  struggles
including  compulsiveness,  alcohol  abuse,
suspiciousness, and inflated self-esteem. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder,
in  areas
moderate,  remission   status   undetermined.   Cumulatively,  the   findings  show   Applicant’s
“judgment and  reliability  are compromised  by  his past,  and  likely  current,  alcohol use. Due
to   the   variety   of   omissions   and   lack   of  candor  in  his  reporting,  the   [Applicant’s]
trustworthiness cannot  be  considered  intact and  should also be  viewed  with  a  high  level
of   caution.”   In   testimony,  Applicant  disputed   the   doctor’s  findings  and   conclusions  and
believed  the doctor was trying  to  catch  him  in  a  lie.  He  stated  that he  did  not feel he  was
an  alcoholic because  “an  alcoholic is somebody  who  drinks beer every  day  constantly, …
to cope with life, to deal with their problems, and all that stuff.”  (Tr. 77)
Government exhibit (GE  11) is a  company  report to  the  DoD  alleging  that Applicant
provoked  a  dispute  with  a  coworker in August 2020.  Apparently, Applicant commented
on  the  employee’s IQ  and  called  him  “retarded,”  then  challenged  him  to  “do  something
about it”  in  a  face-to-face  confrontation. Applicant was reprimanded  for violating  company
policy. This  incident  was not  alleged  in the  SOR.  I  will  consider this unalleged  incident  in
assessing  Applicant’s credibility; in evaluating  his  evidence  of  extenuation, mitigation, or
changed   circumstances;  in  considering   whether  he   has  demonstrated   successful
rehabilitation; and  in applying  the  whole-person  concept. See, e.g., ISCR  Case  No.  15-
07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017).
In  addition  to  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  included  work  awards  and
certificates,  and  character  letters  from  his  wife,  daughter,  and  daughter’s  fiancé.  As  I
mentioned in the hearing, these statements appeared strangely similar and do not attest
to him ceasing use of alcohol in 2019. (Tr. 78-79) In a post-hearing submission, Applicant
submitted several letters of support from his current coworkers, supervisor and manager
attesting to his work ethic, honesty, decency, and superb work performance. He testified
about his love for his work and country, and current healthy lifestyle with his spouse and
children.
",False
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  28-year-old  welder-training  specialist  employed  by  defense
contractors since March 2015. He married in May 2019 and has three children, ages 17,
16, and 2. He received a security clearance in April 2015. (FORM Item 8.)
Applicant used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  2008  to  June  2017. When
he   submitted   an   SCA  in  April  2015,  he   answered   “No”  to   a   question   asking   if   he   had
illegally  used  any  drugs or controlled  substances during  the  last seven  years, and  did not
disclose  his marijuana  use. (FORM  Item  4  at 27.) He  received  a  security  clearance  on  a
date  not reflected  in the  record, but before July  15, 2015, when  he  signed  a  nondisclosure
agreement.   (FORM   Item   8.)   He   continued   to   use   marijuana,   as   well   as  heroin   and
cocaine, while holding  a security clearance.
In 2016, Applicant began using heroin, in addition to using cocaine regularly and
marijuana  occasionally.  In  February  2017,  Applicant  self-admitted  to  a  drug-treatment
facility  and  received  inpatient  treatment  for  alcohol  and  cocaine  dependence.  He  was
released  in  March  2017.  The  treatment  recommendations  upon  discharge  included
avoiding  activities  that  involve  alcohol  or  other  drugs.  He  began  attending  Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) meetings in early 2017.
In June 2017 Applicant intentionally overdosed on his prescribed Trazadone. After
being treated in an emergency room for the overdose, he was readmitted into the drug-
treatment  facility.  In  June  and  July  2017,  he  received  inpatient  treatment  for  cocaine
dependence, cannabis abuse, and opioid abuse.
In July 2017, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor driving while intoxicated
(DWI)  and  refusing  a  blood  or  breath  test.  In  accordance  with  a  plea  agreement,  he
pleaded guilty to refusing a blood or breath test, and the DWI charge was dismissed. He
was sentenced to a fine, and his driver’s license was suspended for one year. From July
2017  to  September  2017,  he  received  outpatient  treatment  for  “alcohol  use  disorder
(severe,  dependence).”  Based  on  his  arrest  for  DWI,  his  security  clearance  was
suspended in September 2017.
The DWI charge triggered an interview by a security investigator in March 2018.
During  the  interview,  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  not  illegally  used  any
drugs  or  controlled  substances  during  the  past  seven  years.  He  denied  misusing
prescription drugs. He also told the investigator that he had not sought or been ordered
to receive counseling or treatment for using drugs or controlled substances. (FORM Item
5 at 6.) In his answer to the SOR, he admitted that his statements to the investigator were
false. (FORM Item 2 at 2.)
Applicant was fired by a defense contractor in January 2019 for coming to work
under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. He was hired by another defense contractor
with no significant period of unemployment.
In Applicant’s response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he has been sober
since he was fired in January 2019. (FORM Item 5 at  14.) In his most recent SCA, he
stated that he now attends AA meetings regularly and has a sponsor who has been sober
for 32 years. (FORM Item 3 at 37, 47.)
",True
"In her Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Paragraph
1 of the SOR, with explanations. Applicant is 65 years old, separated from her husband,
and  has  two  adult  children.  (Item  3  at  pages  7,  30,  and  33.)  She  has  a  doctorate
degree. (Item 3 at pages 15~16.)
Guideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
1.a. Applicant admits that she used marijuana with varying frequency from about
2008 to, at least, October 2021, when she answered the SOR.
1.b. Applicant admits that she used marijuana, from about December of 2016 to,
at least, October 2021, after completing her August 7, 2014 e-QIP.
1.c.  Applicant further admits that she used marijuana to, at least, October 2021,
about  ten  months  after  completing  her  January 28,  2021  e-QIP.  Applicant  argues  that
she uses marijuana as a medicine in a state where it’s use has been legalized, but also
understands it’s use is against Federal law.
",False
"Applicant  is  33  years  old.  She  is not  married  and  has  no  children.  She  has a
Bachelor’s  degree.  Applicant holds a full time position  with  a  defense  contractor as  a
Software Engineer.  She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with this
employment.  The  SOR  alleges  security  concerns  under  three  of  the  following  four
guidelines:
Guideline  I –  Psychological Condition:   The Government alleges that Applicant has
an emotional, mental, and personality condition that can impair judgment, reliability, or
trustworthiness.  Applicant denies the allegation set forth under this allegation.
Guideline   G  –   Alcohol  Consumption:  The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant
engages in excessive alcohol consumption that can lead to the exercise of questionable
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about her reliability
and  trustworthiness.  The  SOR  refers  to  allegation  1.b.,  which  does  not  exist.
Accordingly, there is no finding for or against the Applicant under this guideline.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:   The  Government alleges  that
Applicant has used controlled substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are
used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their  intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions
about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.  Applicant admits with explanation the
allegations  set  forth  in  3.a.,  and  3.b.  The  SOR  refers  to  allegation  3.c.,  which  does  not
exist.  Accordingly, there is no finding for or against the Applicant for 3.c.
Guideline   E   –   Personal   Conduct:   The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has
engaged  in  conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or
unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  that  can  raise  questions  about  her
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  The
Applicant admits with explanation the allegations set forth under this guideline.
Applicant  began  working  for  her  current  employer  in  March  2015.  Applicant
completed a security clearance application dated September 21, 2016.  In response to
questions  in  Section  23,  Applicant  was  asked.  “In  the  last  seven  years,  have  you
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances?”  The  Applicant  answered,  “NO.”
Applicant deliberately failed to disclose that she used marijuana with varying frequency
from  about  high  school  to  at  least  2015.  She  also  failed  to  list  her  use  of  ecstasy  in
2018, while granted a security clearance.  Furthermore, Applicant did not report to her
facility  security  officer  that  she  used  ecstasy  in  2018  as  required  by  DoD  policy  and
procedure.  During  her  interview  with  an  investigator  from  OPM  on  August  21,  2018,
Applicant  was  asked  why  she  did  not  tell  the  truth  about  her  illegal  drug  use  on  her
security clearance application. Applicant stated that she was afraid of losing her security
clearance.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
In regard to the use of illegal drugs, Applicant initially stated that she has never
used  any  illegal  drugs.
(Government  Exhibit  4.)  She  later  admitted  that  she  used
marijuana in high school; about once a week for the last few months of her senior year.
Then,  in  college  her  use  of  marijuana  continued  until  she  quit,  during  the  second
semester.  Applicant did not use marijuana again until 2015, when she visited Colorado
on  two  separate  occasions.  While  in  Colorado,  Applicant  smoked  marijuana  and  ate
marijuana  gummy  bears  one  or  two  times  on  each  trip.  Applicant  decided  to  use
marijuana  since  it  was  legal  in  Colorado,  and  because  she  was  on  vacation.  The
marijuana made her feel loopy, lazy, and dumb.  Applicant stated that the effects of the
gummy  bears  lasted  longer  than  when  she  would  smoke  marijuana.  Applicant  states
that she no longer uses marijuana.  (Answer to SOR.)  Applicant also admitted that in
2018,  she  used  ecstasy  at  a  music festival  in  Ireland  with  a  friend.  She  stated  that a
stranger offered it to her and she tried it.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
Applicant also stated that since April 2017, she has been seeing a mental health
counselor for general anxiety and depression.  Her therapy has continued on a weekly
basis since then.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
In  September  2019,  Applicant  was  referred  for  a  psychological  evaluation  in
relation  to  her  security  clearance  application.
(Government  Exhibit  5.)  During  the
evaluation,  Applicant  discussed  her  difficulty  managing  her  alcohol  consumption,  and
how  she  has  used  alcohol  to  cope  with  stressors  and  stressful  situations.  Applicant
stated that her work with her therapist “focuses on curtailing her drinking.”  In describing
her drinking pattern, Applicant stated that she currently does not drink during the work
week, but drinks wine on Friday and Saturdays.  She has never had a period of drinking
daily, but has “binged” in social situations.  She does not know if she has been formally
diagnosed with  depression  and anxiety,  but she  reported that  she is sad and anxious.
The last time she drank more than she wanted to was October 28, 2019.  She reported
that she had three beers.  Prior to that she drank too much around Valentines day while
on a ski trip.  She consumed about three seltzers and whiskey (about 5-6 drinks).  She
does  not  remember  everything  from  that  night,  but  knows  that  she  had  too  much  to
drink.  She  states  that  she  currently  drinks  heavily  every  couple  of  months  while  at
home.  During those times, she has said things to her roommate that she does not want
to say, and has done things she does not want to do.  For about a two-month period in
2017, she stopped drinking alcohol, and found  that she experienced increased energy
and motivation.  She then returned to her regular drinking pattern.  Applicant has never
attended  Alcoholics Anonymous  or any rehabilitation program for her alcohol problem.
(Government Exhibit 5.)
Applicant explained that in social situations, she becomes very anxious.  At least
once a month she has to leave work early because of her emotions.  Applicant admitted
that  her  alcohol  consumption  has  helped  her  connect  with  people,  but  also
acknowledged  that  it  has  made  things  worse  for  her  most  of  the  time.  (Government
Exhibit 5.)  Applicant believes that she has control over her alcohol consumption since
she tries to follow moderation management.  (Answer to SOR.)
During  the  evaluation,  Applicant  discussed  her  struggle  with  Attention  Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, reflected by an ongoing pattern of impulsivity and poor decision
making.  For  about  a  year,  Applicant  has  been  taking  a  medication  prescribed  by  her
primary  care  physician  for  her  attention  deficit  related  difficulties.  Applicant  explained
that she was having difficulty accomplishing anything at work, and felt like she was not
quite hearing what people were talking to her about.  She feels that she does not listen
well and felt overwhelmed.  She feels that overall, the medication has helped her, but it
can make her feel sick and anxious in the mornings.  (Government Exhibit 5.)
The psychologist  stated that Applicant’s above-described conditions  have led to
episodes  of  poor  judgment  and  failure  to  consider  her  behavior  and  decisions  in  the
face of her obligations related to her security clearance.  Her poor decisions  can place
her in unsafe situations that could make her a target for blackmail or at risk of coercion,
particularly when she is drinking heavily.  She is unable to stop drinking altogether and
says things she wishes she did not say to her roommate when she is home drinking on
the  weekends.  Her alcohol use  places  her  judgment  and  reliability  at  risk  as  she  has
placed  herself  in  dangerous  situations  when  drunk  or  impaired  by  alcohol,  and  later
reports that she cannot report the details.  (Government Exhibit 5.)
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder,  Major  Depressive
Disorder  and  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,  Moderate.  The  psychologist  concluded  that
Applicant’s overall prognosis is poor.  She continues to struggle to eliminate episodes of
heavy drinking, continues to experience impairing levels of depression and anxiety, and
appears insufficiently motivated to put the requirements of her security clearance before
her own desires, even when recognizing the possible security concerns of her actions.
It is also noted that given her ongoing pattern of alcohol use, her ongoing symptoms of
depression  and  anxiety,  as  well  as  her  impulsive  decision  making,  her  judgment,
reliability  and  trustworthiness  appear  impaired  which  impacts  her  capacity  to  properly
safeguard classified information.  (Government Exhibit 5.)

"Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  about  June  2019.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.
military  from  2010  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  2014.  He  has  an  associate’s
degree,  which  he  earned  in  2013  and  additional  college  credits  toward  a  bachelor’s
degree. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 18; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  has  a history of  alcohol-related  criminal offenses. He  was  stopped on
base  in  2013.  His  blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  was  about  .17%.  He  received
nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)
for drunk driving under Article 111 of the UCMJ. He was reprimanded and reduced one
pay  grade.  He  also  lost  his  driving  privileges  on  base  for  a  year.  He  received  an
evaluation from an alcohol and drug counselor, but no diagnosis and no treatment.  (Tr.
at 20-24; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  August  2017  and  charged  with  operating  a  vehicle
while  intoxicated  (OWI).  The  breathalyzer  test  registered  .088%  BAC,  just  above  the
legal limit. He pleaded guilty in February 2018 to a lesser offense of careless operation
of  a  vehicle.  He  was  required  to  pay  a  fine  and  take  a  traffic  safety  course  and  a
substance abuse class. (Tr. at 25-28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant was arrested in September 2018 and charged with OWI. He refused a
breathalyzer. He pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to what he described as
underage  driving under the  influence.  He  could  not  explain  why a  person  in their later

Applicant  submitted  a  letter  from  a  supervisor  attesting  to  Applicant’s  moral
character and excellent job performance. He praised Applicant for his professionalism,
trustworthiness,  work  ethic,  loyalty,  and  careful  handling  of  sensitive  information.  He
recommends Applicant for a security clearance. (AE A)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e), while also providing additional explanation to his admissions for SOR
¶¶  1.d  and  1.e.  His  admissions  and  explanations  are  included  in  the  findings  of  fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  February  2018.  He  earned  a  high  school  degree  in  2007,
attended  community  college  for  a  year,  then  earned  a  trade  certificate  in  2016.  He
served on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps from September 2008 until September
2013,  deploying  to  Afghanistan  for  seven  months  in  2010  and  in  2012.  He  held  a
security clearance while he was in the military. He has never been married and has no
children, but has lived with a co-habitant since December 2017. (Items 5, 6)
Applicant  began  drinking  when  he  was  about  16  years  old.  Throughout  high
school,  he  drank  about  one  or  two  beers  per  week.  He  started  drinking  more  alcohol
after he finished  his Marine  Corps boot  camp,  when he drank  about  one or two  beers
per  night  until  early  in  2010.  In  early  2010,  he  started  drinking  hard  liquor.  Within  a
couple of months, he was consuming about one-half bottle of hard liquor per night. For
the  remainder  of  his  time  in  the  military,  his  drinking  varied  from  two  beers  in  seven
months  to  about  one-half  bottle  of  hard  liquor  per  night,  depending  upon  his  military
requirements. (Items 1, 4-6, 8, 9)
From 2013 until spring 2016, Applicant drank one-fourth of a bottle of hard liquor
per night. In spring 2016, he moved in with his parents and switched to drinking four to
five beers per night until October 2016. In about October 2016, he was arrested in State
A  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  He  had  consumed
about eight to nine shots of alcohol at a bar with one of his co-workers. He had a blood
alcohol content level of .183. He spent the night in jail. (Items 1, 4-9)
As  a  result  of  this  DUI,  Applicant  did  not  drink  for  six  months.  From  December
2016 until April 2017, Applicant attended 22 hours of out-patient alcohol treatment. On
his  intake  form  for  this  treatment,  his  stated  goal  was  to  abstain  from  alcohol.  During
this outpatient alcohol treatment, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder-moderate,
and  his  treatment  counselor  recommended  that  he  abstain  from  alcohol  indefinitely.
However,  in  contravention  of  his  counselor’s  recommendation,  by  the  end  of  his
treatment, his stated goal was to drink alcohol in moderation.  In April 2017, he started
drinking  again.  He  soon  progressed  back  to  one-half  bottle  of  hard  liquor  per  night.
(Items 1, 4-9)
In  November  2017,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  the  DUI  charge  from  October
2016.  He  was  placed  on  probation  for  one  year  and  ordered  to  pay  court  costs  and
fines.  He  was  ordered  to  complete  50  hours  of  community  service,  attend  alcohol
awareness  courses,  and  submit  to  drug/alcohol  testing.  His  probation  was  reduced  to
six months because he had already completed most of the court-ordered requirements
by   the   time   he   was  convicted.  He  had   his  driver’s   license   restricted   to   business
purposes  only   for an  additional six   months. Applicant  stated   that   his DUI  taught   him  a
lesson. He claimed  that he learned to never drink and  drive again. (Items 1, 4-9)
As  of  May 2020,  Applicant  was  consuming one-fourth  to  one-half  bottle  of  hard
liquor per night. He drank to intoxication three nights per week. He sometimes needed
to  drink  alcohol  to  help  him  fall  asleep  at  night.  He  often  drank  at  home  with  his
girlfriend.  It  took  him  nine  beers  or  three  mixed  drinks  to  get  intoxicated.  As  of  May
2020, despite his prior treatment diagnosis and recommendation, Applicant did not think
he had a problem with alcohol and had no plans to stop drinking. He acknowledged that
his  drinking  sometimes  caused  him  to  be  late  for  work,  and  that  his  girlfriend
complained about his drinking. (Items 1, 4-6, 8, 9)
As a result of a referral by the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication
Facility (DOD CAF), in May 2021, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation by a
licensed  clinical  psychologist  (Psychologist).  The  Psychologist  was  contracted  by  the
DOD  CAF.  In  order  to  make  her  psychological  evaluation,  the  Psychologist  reviewed
background  information  submitted  by  the  DOD  CAF,  the  results  of  a  clinical  interview,
and the results of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) that Applicant completed
following the interview. (Items 1, 4-6, 8, 9)
Based  upon  these  measuring  tools,  the  Psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with
alcohol  use  disorder  (moderate).  She  opined  that  he  should  be  further  evaluated  in
order  to  rule  out  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  or  other  anxiety  disorder.  She
noted the marked discrepancy between what Applicant told her about his drinking habits
versus  what  was  contained  in  the  background  information  submitted  by  the  CAF.
Applicant told the Psychologist that he only consumed  one to two beers per night and
denied that he ever drank one-fourth to one-half bottles of liquor per night. He failed to
report to the Psychologist that he sometimes needed alcohol to sleep, that alcohol had
led to tardiness at work, or that his girlfriend disapproved of how much he drank. Based
upon  these  discrepancies,  she  found  that  the  information  Applicant  provided  to  her
during  his  clinical  interview  may  be  unreliable.  She  found  that  he  has  a  guarded
prognosis, and questioned his trustworthiness. (Items 1, 4-6, 8, 9)

"Applicant is a 56-year-old married man with two adult children. After graduating from
college in 1990, he joined the U.S. Air Force (USAF) where he served for 20 years until
retiring honorably in 2011. (Item 2 at 12) While in the USAF, he flew aircraft. After retiring,
he worked as a pilot for two commercial aircraft companies. Since August 2019, he has
been working for a defense contractor as an aircraft lab test director. (Item 2 at 12)
Applicant  has  a  drinking  problem.  Between  1983  and  2018,  he  consumed
approximately 10 to 14 alcohol drinks daily. (Item 1 at 3) Applicant’s alcohol consumption
resulted in a 1985 arrest for driving under the influence. He later pled guilty to the lesser
charge of driving while ability impaired. (Item 1 at 3) Applicant’s alcohol abuse also led to
family problems, as it caused his wife to temporarily separate from him in 2013. (Item 4 at
14)
Applicant frequently flew airplanes while intoxicated, both in his military and civilian
career. He would sometimes drink up to a bottle of alcohol the night before flying. (Item 3
at  7)  He  was  fired  from  both  of  his  commercial  piloting  jobs  for  showing  up  to  work
intoxicated.  (Item  4  at  14,  16)  On  the  second  instance,  a  Transportation  Security
Administration (TSA) agent smelled alcohol on his breath as he was passing through the
airplane checkpoint. The TSA agent then contacted the TSA supervisor, who called the
police. Upon arriving, the police administered a field sobriety test. (Item 5 at 2) The test
revealed that Applicant’s blood alcohol content was three times the state limit for driving an
automobile. (Item 5) The police then escorted Applicant from the airplane. Consequently,
the airline had to cancel the flight, deplane the passengers, and reschedule them for later
flights. (Item 5 at 2)
This  episode  prompted  the  acting  administrator  of  the  Federal  Aviation
Administration to issue an emergency order revoking Applicant’s airman certificates. (Item
6 at 1) Subsequently, Applicant was fired. (Item 5 at 1)
In  November  2018,  after  Applicant’s  termination,  he  checked  into  an  inpatient
alcohol  treatment  facility.  (Item  3  at  7)  He  attended  inpatient  treatment  for  30  days,
followed by outpatient treatment once a week for eight weeks. (Item 4 at 7) In January
2019, he was diagnosed with severe alcohol dependence. (Item 1 at 4; Item 4 at 20) As
part  of  his  treatment,  he  received  individual  and  group  therapy.  (Item  4  at  5,  9)  He
satisfactorily completed the inpatient treatment program. (Item 4 at 20)
Applicant has been clean and sober since checking into the alcohol treatment facility
in November 2018. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings regularly, as well as
therapy sessions. (Item 4 at 5, 7, 10) He characterizes himself as “a better, more reliable,
and more trustworthy person” since he stopped drinking alcohol. (Item 1 at 2)

"Applicant admitted all allegations contained in the SOR, (¶¶ 1.a-1.f, and 2.a.), but
she denied the single allegation under Guideline E. (¶ 3.a.) In addition to her admissions,
she  provided  explanations  and  submitted  two  documents  from  a  substance  abuse
treatment provider with her response to the SOR; one dated August 11, 2017, and the
other dated March 7, 2018. (Answer)
Applicant  is  46   years  old.  She   earned   an   associate’s  degree   in  1996.   She   was
divorced  from her first husband  in 2004. They have four daughters, ages 27, 25, 21, and
18. She  remarried  her  second  spouse  in  2011.  Since  August  2018,  she  is  employed  by  a
federal contractor as a  CATS  analyst,  but because  it is a  small  company, she  performs a
variety  of employment duties,  to  include  assistant  facility  security  officer.  She  held a  DOD
security   clearance   from   2006   when   she   was  first  employed   by   a   federal  contractor.  In
2010  she  worked for a  different federal contractor until she  was laid  off  in October 2016.
She   is  required   to   possess  a   security   clearance   to   perform   specific  job   duties  for  her
employer. (Tr. 24-31; GE 1,  GE  3)
In July 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations
Processing  (e-QIP).  She  disclosed  a  July  2015  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol
(DUI)  arrest.  In  October  2017,  a  government  investigator  conducted  a  background
interview  with  Applicant.  They  discussed  Applicant’s  listed  July  2015  DUI  arrest.  She
volunteered that she had been arrested in September 2016 and charged with a second
DUI,  which  was  discussed.  A  third  DUI  arrest  was  developed,  and  she  admitted  after
questioning that she had been arrested in June 2017, but that she had not yet appeared
in  court.  On  July  15,  2020,  Applicant  reviewed  the  interview  report  and  certified  the
information provided therein was accurate and true. (GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 43)
Applicant  consumed alcohol,  at  times  in  excess  and  to  the  point of  intoxication,
since  about  age  15  to  at  least  July  2017  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  During  the  October  2017
background interview, Applicant stated that she began consuming alcohol regularly in her
early 30s and drank a half bottle of wine three to four times a week. She believed  her
consumption of alcohol was not excessive. After her first DUI arrest in July 2015 (¶ 1.b),
counseling helped her stop drinking alcohol for a short period of time. She resumed her
use  of  alcohol  to  self-medicate  when  experiencing  high  levels  of  stress.  Her  alcohol
consumption continued despite her second DUI arrest in September 2016 (¶ 1.c). After
her  third  arrest  for  DUI  in  June  2017  (¶  1.e),  she  voluntarily  admitted  herself  into  a
substance abuse rehabilitation center (¶ 1.f). She told the investigator that she does not
intend to use alcohol in the future. (GE 3; Tr. 34-36, 40-46)
Applicant  responded  to  an  alcohol  interrogatory  with  attached  medical  records,
which  she  completed  in  July  2020.  She  admitted  that  she  drank  alcohol  again  during
Christmas 2019. She listed that she realized that she cannot drink like a “normal person
on a regular basis.” She periodically attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings until
2018.  At  the  hearing  she  admitted  that  she  attended  a  total  of  approximately  10  AA
meetings, and she did not attend any other AA meetings after 2018, or that she needed
AA support after her December 2019 relapse. (GE 2; Tr. 51-55)
Post-hearing  documents  submitted  by  Department  Counsel  included  the  police
reports for the three alcohol-related arrests in 2015, 2016, and 2017. According to one
report, Applicant was stopped by police in July 2015 at approximately 7:00 p.m. When
the police officer asked her if she had any alcohol to drink, Applicant stated; “I had three
drinks at lunch today because that is part of my job.” The officer noted in the report that
she was wearing high heeled shoes which were removed before she was administered
the field sobriety tests. When asked if she would consent to taking a breathalyzer test,
Applicant responded that if she took the test she would go to jail. She told the police officer
that she  held a  security clearance  and  if  her employer found  out  she  was “[expletive].”
She took the test and her blood alcohol content (BAC) registered 0.258.  Applicant was
taken into custody and charged with DUI and violating a traffic control signal.  She was
ultimately found guilty of DUI and she was placed into a diversion program with specific
conditions to include enrolling into an alcohol treatment program and to not consume any
alcohol while she was on her one-year probation. (GE 3; GE 5; Tr. 40-42, 79)
During the hearing, Applicant explained the circumstances which resulted in her
first  DUI  arrest.  After  she  got  off  from  work,  she  went  to  a  bar  and  consumed  some
alcoholic drinks, but she could not recall how many she drank. Applicant was specifically
asked if she had ever been under the influence of alcohol while working, and she replied;
“never.” Department Counsel asked Applicant if she had told the investigator during her
background interview that she had consumed six shots of liquor before she was arrested
for her first DUI, and she admitted that was accurate. Department Counsel asked her if
she was aware that her BAC of 0.258 was more than three times over the legal limit, and
Applicant said she was surprised by that information. When asked again whether she had
ever reported to work under the influence of alcohol, Applicant admitted that a previous
employer  had  a  private  conversation  with  her  about  alcohol.  When  confronted  with
information  developed  from  her  background  investigation  from  a  previous  employer,
Applicant did not recall that her supervisor had found her in an intoxicated state on two
occasions in October 2016, or that her husband had to pick her up and take her home on
both occasions. She also did not recall that in October 2016 her employer laid her off, in
part, due to her excessive use of alcohol while on the job. (Tr. 40-44, 59, 77-78, 89-91)
The  September  2016  police  report  disclosed  a  phone  call  was  made  about  the
welfare of a woman who had gotten out of a parked vehicle and urinated, returned to her
car and passed out. When the police officers arrived at approximately 4:30 p.m., Applicant
was  slumped  over  the  steering  wheel  of  a  running  car.  The  officers  knocked  on  the
window, nudged her shoulder, and reported that her cell phone was also ringing loudly.
She was unresponsive. Paramedics were called to the scene; the car was turned off; and
the keys were removed from the ignition. When an officer tried to get Applicant to rest
back in her car seat, she opened her eyes. There was a strong odor of alcohol coming
from her. The officer told Applicant that an emergency squad was coming and asked her
what she had to drink. She responded that she drank two bottles of vodka. Applicant was
arrested and charged with DUI and parking on a curb. When she arrived at the station,
her BAC registered 0.283. Ultimately, the DUI charge was dismissed but the court added
an  additional year  of  treatment  to  the  2015 diversion  program  requirements.  Applicant
had violated the terms of her probation by consuming alcohol when the second alcohol-
related arrest occurred. (GE 6; Tr. 42-43, 82-87)
Applicant  received  treatment  from  about  October  2015  to  October  2017,  for  a
condition  diagnosed  as  alcohol  abuse  disorder.  (¶  1.d)  Applicant  stated  she  had
approximately monthly therapy sessions during the two-year period. She admitted that
she continued to consume alcohol during her treatment and against medical advice. She
was arrested for her third DUI a few months before the treatment program ended. (Tr. 42,
44-45, 47-48)
The June 2017 police records disclosed that Applicant had moved her daughter’s
car, and while turning at an intersection, she hit a street sign which damaged the car. She
did not report the accident to police. The police officer who had filed the 2017 report noted
that she previously had four contacts with Applicant, all involving alcohol, to include a DUI
arrest  in  2016. When Applicant  was  asked  if  she  had been  drinking alcohol,  Applicant
stated “a few sips of wine.” She did not pass the field sobriety tests and was taken into
custody. Applicant registered 0.199 BAC at the station. She was charged with DUI and
failure to give information after striking unattended property. The day following the arrest
Applicant admitted to the police officer that she had been to the liquor store and drank “a
vodka shooter” prior to the accident. At the hearing Applicant stated that she was found
guilty of DUI, fined, and she served 24 hours in jail. (Tr. 45-47; GE 6)
Applicant  testified  that  she  had  a  cordial  relationship  with  her  ex-husband  until
about 2015. At that time, he announced that he had military orders to move to  another
state for about a year. He and his current wife would take their recreational vehicle (RV)
and requested that the youngest daughter stay with them. Applicant refused to relinquish
custody of their youngest daughter, and in retaliation, he filed for full custody for their two
youngest daughters. She was in court frequently and the custody battle was contentious.
She started drinking alcohol more frequently during this time period while her life was very
stressful.  For  several  years  she  took  prescribed  antidepressant  medication  while
consuming  alcohol.  The  first  time  she  considered  that  she  may  have  a  problem  with
alcohol,  occurred  after  she  was  arrested  for  her  first  DUI  in  2015.  She  continued  to
consume  alcohol,  in  violation  of  her  probation  and  against  medical  advice,  until  June
2017, when she was arrested for her third DUI. (Tr. 36-39, 70, 75-76, 87-89)
Applicant stated that she voluntarily admitted herself to an alcohol treatment center
after her third DUI arrest. The medical records disclosed Applicant’s self-reported alcohol
and prescription drug history. She began using alcohol at age 15. Her primary choice of
alcohol was beer, vodka, and wine. She last used alcohol on the day of her admission,
July 14, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., after drinking 10 shooters (shots of liquor). She reported to
personnel that she is unable to stop using alcohol without help. It also disclosed that her
drinking pattern consisted of drinking 10 to 20 shooters while on binges, about one day a
week for the last ten years. She enrolled into inpatient treatment for substance abuse in
2016, but she was released after staying a few days because her insurance would not
cover the cost of treatment. She had experienced alcohol-related blackouts, emotional
problems,  family  problems,  marital  conflict,  and  legal  problems  from  abusing  alcohol.
Applicant was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder Severe, and Sedative Use Disorder
Severe. She was discharged from the treatment facility on August 11, 2017. During the
hearing, Applicant stated that the alcohol treatment center’s diagnosis was questionable
since the facility coded her with a serious diagnosis in an effort to have her insurance
cover  her  inpatient  treatment.  She  stated  the  facility  took  “creative  license”  with  the
medical diagnosis. Applicant denied that all of the information was reported accurately in
her  medical  records.  She  completed  six  months  of  outpatient  treatment  following  her
discharge (¶ 1.f).  (GE 2; Tr. 48-50, 59, 72-74, 82)
Applicant relapsed after consuming alcohol at a 2019 Christmas party. She drank
two  glasses  of  wine  with  dinner.  She  was  disappointed  in  herself  for  drinking  alcohol
because she had to start her sobriety clock all over again. Her husband was also upset
with her for drinking alcohol. She did not return to alcohol treatment or AA meetings. She
said she does not need any assistance to maintain sobriety, and she has made many
positive changes to live a healthier lifestyle. (GE 2; AE H; Tr. 51-55)
Applicant  provided  an  independent  alcohol  abuse  evaluation  from  a  licensed
clinical  social  worker  (LCSW),  and  certified  substance  abuse  counselor  (CSAC).  The
professional evaluator listed on her resume “specializing in security clearance evaluations
and  mental  health  treatment  for  federal  government  employees  and  contractors.”  As
previously stated, this report and the enclosures were the basis for the motion in limine
filed by Department Counsel. My review of these documents will be limited as indicated
previously. (GE H, GE I)
The  alcohol  evaluation  took  place  on  March  11,  2022,  via  live  video  feed,  and
involved standardized testing and a one-on-one personal interview. The report noted that
in  1996,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),
depression, and anxiety. This diagnosis has continued throughout her life. She has been
prescribed various medications over the years to treat her conditions. In 2015, Applicant
experienced  excessive  stressors  after  she  and  her  ex-husband  became  involved  in  a
combative custody lawsuit, and she drank alcohol to relieve the tension. It was during this
time she was arrested for her first DUI in 2015. She stated that she was wearing “very
high” heeled shoes and failed the sobriety tests. She completed all the requirements for
the diversion program successfully.
For the second DUI, Applicant admitted that had a few drinks at a friend’s house.
After leaving her friend’s house, she called her husband to pick her up because she was
aware that she should not be driving. She was arrested for DUI only after she admitted to
the police officer that she had consumed alcoholic drinks with her friend. Her diversion
was extended an additional year. The third DUI occurred because Applicant had to move
her  daughter’s  car  to  make  room  for  a  basketball  game.  Unbeknownst  to  her  or  her
daughter, her ex-husband had a “tracker” placed on the car. The stepmother called and
asked the daughter why she was driving the car  and the daughter apparently reported
that her mother had moved the car. The stepmother called police to report that Applicant
was illegally driving the car. The police arrived, and Applicant admitted to having two to
four glasses of wine prior to moving the car. She was arrested for DUI, she lost her driver’s
license,  and  was  required  to  install  an  interlock  device  on  her  car  once  her  driving
privileges were restored. There was no indication that the evaluator had any corroborating
information, to include any of the police reports, and the only source of information used
in the evaluation was supplied solely by Applicant.
The mental health professional wrote in the evaluation report:
“…It should be noted that when patients first enter treatment they may  well
be   diagnosed   with   a   higher  level  of  disorder,  as   was  the   case   with   Ms.
(omitted)  when   she   entered   [alcohol   treatment].  Often   the   scale   used
includes a  DUI or evidence  of  interactions with  the  law. However, it should
be   noted   that  a   diagnosis  upon   entry   to   treatment  is  not  a   static  event.
Treatment,   education,   spiritual  healing,  psychotherapy,  community,  and
engagement  in   a   healthy   lifestyle  will  adjust   the   diagnosis  accordingly.”
There  was  no   indication   that  the   evaluator  had   corroborating   information
from  [the  alcohol treatment center] or a  professional medical publication  to
support her opinion. (AE H)
The  evaluator  noted  that  Applicant  had  remained  sober  from  July  2017  to
December  2019  before  her  relapse.  Applicant  regretted  the  relapse  and  made  a
commitment  to  never  do  so  again.  The  evaluator  diagnosed  Applicant  with  moderate
alcohol  use  disorder,  in  remission.  It  was  her  professional  opinion  that  if  Applicant
continued with daily spiritual practices, attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,
and continued engagement of a healthy lifestyle, Applicant had a very good prognosis for
the future. (AE H, AE I)
Personal Achievements and Recognition:
Applicant  submitted  a  September  2007  e-mail  from  a  branch  chief  who  lauded
Applicant’s accomplishments with a challenging work project, and recommended her for
a bonus due to her outstanding efforts. Applicant also submitted a March 2015 certificate
of appreciation from the Intelligence, Surveillance, & Reconnaissance Integration for her
exemplary support. There was a photograph of Applicant receiving a CSC award, possibly
the 2010 winner of the CSC President’s Award, as listed in her resume. (AE D, AE E)

admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c in part, and admitted the allegations in
SOR ¶ 1.d and 2.a. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 47-year-old flight instructor employed by defense contractors since
October 2017. He has worked for his current employer since April 21, 2022. (Tr. 11.) He
graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in May 1998 and served on active duty until
he retired in September 2017 with the rank of major. While on active duty, he completed
12  deployments  and flew 304  combat  missions  consisting  of  more than  2,000  combat
flight hours. He received numerous awards and commendations for his service, including
three awards of the Meritorious Service Medal, seven awards of the Air Medal, the Joint
Service  Commendation  Medal,  the  Aerial  Achievement  Medal,  and  the  Air  Force
Achievement Medal. (AX A, TAB E.) He held a security clearance throughout his military
service  and  as  an  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  His  clearance  has  not  been
suspended during the ongoing security clearance adjudication. (Tr. 179.)
Applicant   married   in   May   2003   and   divorced   in  February   2005,   due   to   his  then

Applicant first consumed  alcohol on  his 21st  birthday, while  he  was a  cadet. He and
fellow  cadets consumed  a  six-pack of beer and  a  bottle  of cognac.  He was very  sick the
next day  and  did not drink again until the  night  he  graduated  from  the  Air  Force academy,
at age  23, when  he  consumed  numerous  “tequila  poppers” and  again was very  sick. (Tr.

Beginning in about 2013, Applicant began drinking heavily, consuming about 350
milliliters of whiskey every evening (six to seven standard drinks), but he abstained from
alcohol for at least 12 hours before flying. He attributed his heavy drinking to the stress
of  an  unhappy  marriage.  He  used  his  educational  benefits  to  allow  his  then  wife  to
complete her education and begin a career as a nurse practitioner. He believed that his
then  wife  became  totally  involved  in  her  own  career  and  was  no  longer  interested  in
contributing  to  the  marriage.  (GX  2  at  5;  GX  3  at  38.).  His  then  wife  and  his  brother
attempted to intervene to stop his excessive drinking, without success. He testified that
he resisted their efforts to intervene because he and his then wife had discussed divorce,
and he believed that their efforts were intended to discredit him and gain leverage in any
subsequent  divorce.  (Tr.  113-14.)  As  a  result  of  the  attempted  intervention  and  other
factors, Applicant is estranged from his brother. (GX 2 at 4.) Applicant is also estranged
from his father because of his father’s heavy alcohol consumption, use of marijuana, and
abusive behavior. (Tr. 126; AX A, TAB F at 52.) He is close to his mother, who helped
him pay for inpatient treatment for an alcohol abuse disorder in 2018.
About two or three months after the attempted intervention by his then wife and his
brother, Applicant voluntarily admitted himself into a medical facility, because he believed
he was drinking too much. (Tr. 114.) He chose the facility because it was advertised on
the Internet as a facility that  specialized in trauma treatment, including trauma-induced
substance abuse. (Tr. 133; AX A, TAB F at 53.)
Applicant testified that there were two stressors in his life. The first was the result
of  12  deployments,  where  he  “killed  a  bunch  of  people,  saw  a  lot  of  stuff  that  people
probably shouldn’t see,” and the second was “a one-sided marriage.” (Tr. 130.)
From  November 2018 to  December 2018,  Applicant  was  treated  at  the  medical
facility. During his intake interview, he disclosed that on November 5, 2018, he was briefly
hospitalized after threatening to kill himself after his wife took his alcohol away from him.
He disclosed that he made the threat to frighten his wife and make her realize “where he
was emotionally,” but he did not believe he was suicidal. (GX 3 at 30.)
When Applicant was discharged from the medical facility, he was diagnosed with
alcohol  use  disorder,  severe;  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD);  anxiety  disorder,
unspecified;  major  depressive  disorder,  recurrent  and  unspecified;  sleep  disorder,
unspecified;  and  exposure  to  disaster,  war,  and  other  hostilities.  The  discharge  notes
recited that his alcohol use disorder was in remission; his PTSD was mild; his anxiety and
depression were in remission; and he was sleeping well. His follow-up recommendations
included follow-up with his primary care doctor and a therapist. His prognosis was “good.”
The suggestions for continued recovery were to attend 90 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
meetings in 90 days, to obtain an AA sponsor, to continue receiving counseling, and to
find an AA “home group” where he could continue his AA participation. (GX 3 at 1-4.) He
testified that he was never advised to completely abstain from alcohol. (Tr. 119.)
In accordance with the recommendation of the medical facility, Applicant met with
a counselor, found his techniques unusual, and stopped seeing him after two visits. He
attended AA meetings for a couple of months but found it unhelpful. (Tr. 113.) He had a
sponsor and initially met with him at almost every meeting. (Tr. 160.)
Applicant  met  his  cohabitant  while  they  both  were  being  treated  at  the  same
medical facility. His cohabitant was being treated for trauma, but not for an any alcohol
issues, and she became his “recovery friend.” (Tr. 161, 169). He testified that his divorce
in May 2019 removed much of the stress that caused his excessive drinking. (Tr. 113.)
He and his cohabitant began living together in June 2019.
Applicant abstained from alcohol while in treatment in November and December
2018. In September 2019, he and his cohabitant went out for dinner, where they each
had two drinks. At his cohabitant’s suggestion, they went to a bar after dinner, where they
met several of Applicant’s colleagues for drinks. Applicant drank too much, went to a fast-
food restaurant, and was rear-ended by another vehicle as he left the fast-food restaurant.
The other driver who rear-ended him claimed that Applicant pulled out in front of him.
Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI)  with  a
blood-alcohol content (BAC) of greater than .15.  On April 9, 2020, he pleaded guilty to
DUI with a BAC of less than .15. On April 17, 2020, he was fined $50, required to perform
30 days of community service and was placed on supervised probation for 11.29 months.
(The fractional length of probation for 11.29 months is reflected in the court records but
was  not  explained  in  the  records  or  elsewhere.)  He  was  also  required  to  attend  a
substance-abuse  school  and  attend  a  victim-impact  panel.  His  driver’s  license  was
suspended  for  six  months.  (GX  2  at  12-14.)  He  successfully  completed  his  term  of
supervised probation in April 2021.
During a security interview in April 2020, Applicant told an investigator that he was
consuming about “two fingers” of whiskey twice a month on weekends. (GX 2 at 4.) His
shared custody of his daughter motivates him to moderate his consumption. He testified,
“Obviously, alcohol consumption and  chasing around a 5-year-old is not conducive, so
that doesn't happen.” (Tr. 117.)
After Applicant received the SOR in January 2021, his attorney recommended that
he undergo a psychological evaluation. In February and March 2021, he was evaluated
by a board-certified psychologist with extensive military and medical experience, including
evaluations in connection with security clearance adjudications. (AX B.) The psychologist
concluded that Applicant met the diagnostic criteria for a moderate alcohol use disorder
between early 2017 and late 2018, but he was in sustained remission at the time of the
evaluation, and his prognosis was good because he did not have a long history of alcohol
abuse and he had maintained sobriety for about 18 months  before resuming moderate
consumption  of  alcohol.  He  concluded  that  Applicant  does  not  have  an  alcohol  use
condition that could negatively impact his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness and he
does not have any behavioral pattern or personality characteristics that could render him
unable or unwilling to safeguard national security information. (AX A at TAB F.)
The  psychologist  had  two  virtual  meetings  with  Applicant  shortly  before  the
hearing,  He  testified  that,  based  on  the  additional  passage  of  time,  he  changed  his
prognosis  from  “good”  to  “excellent.”  (Tr.  36.)  He  disagreed  with  the  December  2018
diagnoses  of  severe  alcohol  use  disorder  and  PTSD,  describing  them  as  “relatively
sloppily  assigned,”  and  he  would  have  counseled  Applicant  rather  than  send  him  to
someone else for treatment. (Tr. 38-39.)
On cross-examination, the psychologist testified that his diagnosis was based on
information provided by Applicant. He had not seen the medical records from Applicant’s
treatment in 2018.  (Tr. 64.) He was not aware that the medical records for Applicant’s
treatment in 2018 reflected that he showed signs of alcohol withdrawal and that he was
prescribed a drug used to minimize the effects of withdrawal. The psychologist also was
not aware that Applicant began drinking alcohol at age 21, that during his period of heavy
drinking that he experienced blackouts, that he had been drinking heavily for five years
instead  of  three  years,  and  that  he  told  a  staff  member  in  2018  that  he  experienced
depression, low interest, flashbacks, and hyper-vigilance of mild severity. (Tr. 70-74, 84.)
The  psychologist  testified  that  he  did  not  believe  Applicant  intentionally  withheld
information. He admitted that his opinions might have been different if he had been aware
of  the  additional facts.  However,  even  after  learning  about  the  additional facts,  he  still
believed that Applicant’s prognosis is good. (Tr. 102.)
One  of  Applicant’s coworkers,  who  has known  him  for about ten  years and  is a
lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, testified that he has never observed him
drink  to  excess,  come  to  work  under  the  influence  of  alcohol,  or  drive  a  vehicle  after
drinking.  He  considers  Applicant  reliable,  honest  and  trustworthy.  He  believes  that
Applicant’s DUI was a  one-time mistake that he regrets and will not repeat. (Tr. 18-21;
AX A, TAB G.)
Another coworker, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who has known Applicant
for about 22 years, has become a good friend since around 2018. They work together on
a daily basis and they “hang out” socially. He considers Applicant “the most skilled pilot
[he has] ever flown with.” He believes that the DUI was a one-time incident that will not
recur. He has never observed Applicant intoxicated, come to work intoxicated, or operate
a vehicle or any type of equipment under the influence of alcohol. He considers Applicant
honest and trustworthy. He testified that when they go to lunch or dinner, Applicant usually
does not drink, but when he drinks the amount is insignificant. (Tr. 23-28; AX A. TAB H.)
The  training  integrator who  supervises Applicant has  known  him for more  than 13
years. He regards Applicant as  “one  of the  best and  most thoughtful pilots” that  he  has
known. He notified  the Federal Aviation  Administration  (FAA) that Applicant  would never
attempt  to  operate  an  aircraft  while  impaired.  He told  the  FAA  that “it is just  not how  he  is
wired.” (AX A, TAB I.)
In Applicant’s response to the SOR and at the hearing, he submitted a statement
of intent not to abuse alcohol in the future, and he agreed that any alcohol abuse would
constitute grounds for automatic revocation of his security clearance. (AX A, TAB J.)
",True
"Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since December 2020. He is applying for a security clearance for
the  first  time.  He  has  an  associate  degree  and  additional  college  credits,  but  no
bachelor’s degree. He is single without children. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant has a history of substance abuse. He started using marijuana in about
2006.  He  was  issued  citations  for  possession  of  marijuana  in  2006  and  2010.  He
stopped using marijuana after the second citation, but his alcohol use started to become
problematic in about 2011. It increased to the point that he was drinking beer daily and
liquor several times a week. He was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated
(DWI) in 2012. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 45 days in jail, with all of the jail
time suspended; probation for one year; a fine and costs; and attendance at an alcohol
class. (Items 1-3)
Applicant’s  alcohol  use  contributed  to  medical  problems,  resulting  in  inpatient
hospitalizations in July 2019 and from October 2019 to December 2019. He has not had
any  alcohol  since  he  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  in  October  2019.  He  was  told  that
drinking again could kill him. (Items 1-3)
Applicant was prescribed opioid medication for the pain. After consulting with his
pain-management  doctor,  he  decided  that  marijuana  was  a  better  alternative  than
opioids. In March 2020, he resumed using marijuana, but only for medicinal purposes.
He purchased the marijuana about once a month. (Items 1-3)
Applicant reported his alcohol issues and his marijuana use on a Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in January 2021. He stated that he
intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future  with  the  comment:  “I  use  this  for  medical
reasons.  As  suggested  by  my  Doctors.  It  provides  a  level  of  relief  that  could  only  be
achieved by heavy narcotic and opioid medication.” (Item 2)
Applicant  provided  similar  information  when  he  was  interviewed  for  his
background  investigation  in  March  2021  and  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  in
October 2021, in which he wrote:
My  use  of  medical cannabis/marijuana  has been  a  vital tool in  my  journey
of  recovery  and  has  helped  me  become  the  best me  I  have  ever been.  In
addition   to   the   fact  that  it  helped   me   stop   taking   heavy   doses  of   opioids
almost
relief,   gastric
stress/problems   relief,   sleep   issues,   and   it   works  in  conjunction   with   my
anxiety medication  for anxiety relief. If permitted, I would like to continue to
use  medical cannabis.  (Item  3)
its  use   helps  me   with   pain
immediately,
Applicant  wrote  in  his  response  to  the  SOR:  “I  am  willing  to  work  and  find  an
alternative  medical  solution,  but  until  that  medical  solution  is  found,  I’m  going  to
continue  to  use  the  medical solution  that  works, as it is legal in  my state  to  do  so.”  He
did not respond to the FORM, so additional information is not available.
",True
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted most of the information in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.d, and 2.a. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are
accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  information  system  security  officer  (ISSO)  who  has
worked for a DOD contractor for the previous eight years. (Tr. 6, 9) In 1999, he received
a bachelor’s degree, and in 2003, he received a master’s degree in information systems
management.  (Tr.  6,  36)  He  has  about  eight  security  or  information  technology
certifications. (Tr. 37) He served in the Air Force from 1987 to 2011, and he honorably
retired as a master sergeant (E-7). (Tr. 7, 38-39) He has been married and divorced three
times: from 1990 to 1991; from 1993 to 1994; and from 2009 to 2017. (Tr. 7, 52-54; GE
1;  GE  2)  He  has  one  12-year-old  child.  (Tr.  8,  54)  He  has  held  a  security  clearance
continuously since he was age 18. (Tr. 8)
Alcohol Consumption and Psychological Conditions
Department  Counsel  requested;  Applicant  did  not  object;  and  I  approved  an
amendment to SOR ¶ 1.a, which now alleges: “You have consumed alcohol, at times in
excess  and  to  the  point  of  intoxication  from  about  age  14  to  about  1998.  You  were
abstinent from about 1998 to 2018. You consumed alcohol from 2018 to June 30, 2021.
On July 1, 2021, you resumed your sobriety.” (Tr. 14-18)
Applicant admitted he consumed alcohol at times excessively starting in about age
14  until  he  stopped  drinking  in  1998.  (Tr.  27,  41,  45-46)  For  example,  when  he  was
married the first time from 1990 to 1991, he “never took a sober breath.” (Tr. 52) He drank
at least one beer every other day, and he believed it takes 48 hours for a beer to get out
of his system. (Tr. 52) He attended some Alcoholics Anonymous  (AA) meetings during
his first marriage and he stopped drinking during his first marriage; however, his first wife
continued to consume alcohol. (Tr. 53)
During the years when Applicant was consuming alcohol, he continued to do so
even  though  he attended  some  AA meetings.  (Tr.  53) Some  of  his  periods  of  sobriety
were for a few days, sometimes he was sober for several weeks or for several months.
(Tr. 53) He told himself “I’m going to quit drinking and then [he] would like forget and [he]
would  start  drinking  again.  [He]  would  forget  that  [he]  quit.”  (Tr.  53)  He  would  resume
drinking, and then go through the same process of quitting and restarting. He was “in and
out through a revolving door” for several years. (Tr. 53)
Applicant  said  he  resumed alcohol consumption  after 20  years of  abstinence  in
2018,  because  he  stopped  attending  AA  meetings;  he  was  divorced;  and  he  was  in
recovery from surgery for a deviated septum. (Tr. 20, 55) After his surgery, he received a
pain  medication  which  reduced  his  inhibition  against  drinking  alcohol.  (Tr.  21,  55)  His
mother passed away. (Tr. 55) In 2018, he gradually increased the frequency of his alcohol
consumption until he was drinking on a daily basis. (Tr. 56) At his worst, he was drinking
10 drinks a day on weekends. (Tr. 57)
During a May 6, 2020 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, Applicant
disclosed he was drinking one to six drinks per day, five or six days a week. (Tr. 58; GE
4 at 4) He told the OPM investigator that he did not believe he had a drinking problem. Id.
He drank to intoxication about once a week. (Tr. 73) He did not drink during the work day;
however, sometimes he worked into the evenings and drank alcohol during a break, and
then  he  resumed  working.  (Tr.  74-75)  It  did  not  occur  to  Applicant  that  his  alcohol
consumption was a security issue. (Tr. 58) He had some alcohol-related blackouts in the
late 1980s and the 1990s. (Tr. 59) On June 30, 2021, he was thinking about his security
clearance on the eve of his psychological evaluation, and he “got really drunk.” (Tr. 59)
The next day, he concluded he definitely needed to abstain from alcohol consumption.
(Tr. 59) His most recent alcohol-related blackout was on June 30, 2021. (Tr. 77) In July
2021, he resumed attendance at AA meetings. (Tr. 59) He started working with a sponsor
and the 12-step AA program. (Tr. 60) At the time of his hearing, he attended one to three
AA meetings a week. (Tr. 66)
Applicant does not see a medical or mental-health person to address his alcohol
consumption. (Tr. 67) He has been taking a prescription drug for depression for 15 years.
(Tr. 68-69) His  general practitioner renews  his prescription for depression.  (Tr. 69) He
has been “totally sober” since July 1, 2021. (Tr. 66) No medical person ever told him he
should remain sober; however, at AA meetings they recommend complete abstinence.
(Tr. 71)
SOR  ¶   1.b   alleges   Applicant   sustained   an   alcohol-related  bruise  to   his foot   and
sought medical attention. In  1994, Applicant blacked  out from  alcohol consumption, fell,
and  injured  his foot.  (Tr. 47-48, 71) He was diagnosed  as alcohol dependent; however,
he  did  not believe  the  treating  physician  recommended  that he  not consume  alcohol.  (Tr.
72) Applicant  said  he  was treated  for an  injury  to  his foot,  and  released.  (Tr.  28) He  was
not  hospitalized.  (Tr. 28)   He  was  referred   to   and   successfully   completed   an   Air   Force
alcohol-counseling  program. (Tr. 48;  GE  4)  He complied  with  the  order to  abstain  from
alcohol consumption  while  he  was enrolled  in  the  Air  Force alcohol-counseling  program,
and  then  he  resumed  his alcohol consumption  after he  completed  the  Air  Force  alcohol-
counseling  program. (Tr. 48)
SOR ¶  1.c alleges in 1998  Applicant received  alcohol treatment.  In  1998, Applicant
drank  a few  beers and a  couple  of martinis, and he  could  not function. (Tr. 44)  He asked
some   teenagers  to   help  him   get  home.  (Tr.  44)  They   refused.  He  was  stumbling   and
falling.  (Tr.  44)  A   good   Samaritan   drove   him   home.  (Tr.  44)  He   could  not  lay   down
because  the  room  was spinning. (Tr.  45)  He called  his supervisor’s supervisor, and  told
him  he  had  a  drinking  problem  and  needed  help.  (Tr. 45) He received  outpatient alcohol
counseling  after work and  on  weekends about three  days a  week for three  months. (Tr.
49)  He successfully completed  this alcohol-counseling program. (GE 4)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a licensed psychologist diagnosed Applicant with Alcohol Use
Disorder Severe. The psychologist indicated Applicant’s current condition will likely impair
his  judgment,  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  his  ability  to  safeguard  classified
information.
On July 26, 2021, Andrea Graves, Psy.D., evaluated Applicant at the request of
the DCSA CAF. (GE 3) Applicant provided some corrections to the facts in Dr. Graves’
report,  and  I  find  his  corrections  to  the  facts  in  the  report  to  be  truthful  and  accurate;
however,  his  corrections  about  the  timing  or  location  of  events  or  circumstances  are
insufficient to impeach her diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder Severe. (Tr. 26-33, 82) For
mental status, Dr. Graves concluded Applicant was average to above average in most
respects. (GE 3 at 4) There is no evidence of suicidal  or homicidal ideations, paranoid
thinking, delusional thought processes, or psychosis.  Id. She criticized his decisions to
stop taking medically necessary medications for cholesterol and blood pressure when he
resumed drinking. Id. at 6. She characterized his decision to stop taking his medications
as possibly being “passively suicidal,” but noted his insistence that he wanted to stay alive
for his son. Id. at 6. At his hearing, Applicant assured he checked his blood pressure on
a daily basis, and due to loss of weight, his health had improved to the extent that taking
blood pressure and cholesterol medications are unnecessary.
Dr. Graves indicated Applicant had been abstinent from alcohol consumption for
about one month and attended two AA meetings a day. GE 3 at 5. Applicant disagreed
with the psychologist’s conclusions that his history of alcohol consumption “likely impairs
his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to safeguard classified information.”
Id. at 6. He considered the impact of his alcohol consumption on his ability to safeguard
classified  information  not  “to  be  a  big  deal  at  all.”  (Tr.  50)  After  he  received  the
psychologist’s  report,  he  acknowledged,  “This  looks  really  bad.”  (Tr.  50)  He  described
himself as stable and responsible. (Tr. 50-51)
Applicant promised  to  stop  drinking  alcohol while  holding  a  security  clearance. (Tr.
76) He intends to  continue  attending  AA  meetings and  maintain his sobriety  even  if  his
security  clearance  is revoked. (Tr. 78)  He  has never been  arrested  or  convicted  of any
alcohol-related   offense.  There  is   no   evidence   of  security   violations  or  abuse   of  illegal
drugs.
SOR ¶ 2.a cross alleges the same information in SOR ¶ 1.a under Guideline I.

Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in about March 2007, Applicant was charged with driving under
the influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant said he had three drinks at a unit hail and farewell
function  over  about  a  three-hour  period.  (Tr. 32,  75-76,  118) The  drinks  were  not  “big
ones”  or  “doubles.”  (Tr.  118-119)  A  police  officer  stopped  him  for  swerving  on  his

Applicant received a memorandum of reprimand for the 2007 DUI arrest, and he
was transferred from the elite aviation unit in the United States to another unit in Korea.
(Tr. 79, 120) The reprimand was filed in his personnel file. (Tr. 120) He was taken off of
the promotion list for CW5, and he realized he would not be promoted to the rank of CW5.
(Tr. 120) He also completed the standard Army alcohol-counseling program consisting of
about six weeks of classes for two hours a week. (Tr. 130) His heaviest period of alcohol
consumption  was  from  2006  to  2009,  and  during  this  period  he  occasionally  had  five
drinks during a single sitting. (Tr. 82, 112)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  in  about  August  2009,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI.  He
claimed he drank four drinks  over about a  three-hour period  at a party.  (Tr.  80)  At his
hearing, he said that he did not remember the blood-alcohol content (BAC) test result,
and  then  he  said  it  could  have  been  a  .2.  (Tr.  121-122)  The  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) report of investigation (ROI) indicates his BAC was .23 percent. (AE
M at 80) After considering the OPM ROI BAC test result, he conceded that he did not
remember how much he had to drink at the party. (Tr. 163) He believed he was impaired
but not intoxicated. (Tr. 81) The police arrested him for DUI on his way home from the
party. (Tr. 82) He was found guilty of DUI first offense. (Tr. 123; AE M at 81) He received
11 months and 29 days of probation, 2 days in jail, a $350 fine, and loss of driver’s license
for one year. Id. He did not participate in any alcohol counseling or treatment after the
2009  DUI.  (Tr.  83)  Applicant  disclosed  the  DUI  arrest  to  his  supervisor.  (Tr.  84,  123)
However,  no  incident  report  from  his  security  record  was  offered  as  an  exhibit  at  his
hearing. (Tr. 84, 93)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges in about March 2013, Applicant was charged with DUI. Applicant
claimed that he drank two to five beers at a  friend’s residence  over a five-hour period,
and then he elected to drive a friend home before going to his own home. (Tr. 85-86, 123)
The police stopped Applicant because he was blocking an intersection. (Tr. 86) Applicant
was stopped in the intersection because he was unsure about which way to turn. (Tr. 86)
He was arrested for DUI, but not charged with DUI. (Tr. 90)  He refused a breathalyzer
even though he was aware that he should have metabolized one beer per hour and not
been intoxicated by the time the police stopped him. (Tr. 123-124) He was also aware
that the refusal of a breathalyzer would result in suspension or revocation of his driver’s
license, and the refusal would be admissible in a DUI trial. (Tr. 125)
Applicant received a pretrial diversion for the 2013 DUI. (Tr. 90) He completed two
years of unsupervised probation and about 12 hours of alcohol classes. (Tr. 87, 91; GE
6 at 3) He performed community service, and he went to two Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
meetings. (Tr. 88) He said he was told by the county alcohol counselor that his DUI was
a  one-time  event,  and  because  he  did  not  drink  during  the  week,  he  did  not  have  a
problem with alcohol. (Tr. 88-89) However, Applicant realizes now that he had an alcohol
problem. (Tr. 89) He did not have a document from the counselor indicating he did not
have an alcohol problem; however, he believed such a document was possibly submitted
to the court adjudicating the DUI offense. (Tr. 89-90) He said he disclosed the DUI arrest
to his supervisor and security officer; however, no incident report from his security record
was offered as an exhibit at his hearing. (Tr. 92-93)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges in about  May 2017, Applicant was charged with  Operating a
Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol (OUI). He claimed that he went to dinner
and had three, maybe four drinks over about a three-hour period. (Tr. 39, 95, 125) The
police stopped him possibly for swerving while driving; he refused a breathalyzer; and he
was arrested for OUI. (Tr. 39, 95, 125) The police report indicates he swerved and almost
hit a “passing semi.” (Tr. 96; AE N (police report)) However, Applicant did not remember
much  about  his  driving  before  the  arrest.  (Tr.  95)  He  was  charged  with  OUI  Second
Offense. (AE N (arraignment)) He pleaded guilty to OUI First Offense. (file) He received
a fine of $1,250. In November 2017, he completed a 24-hour class over a weekend and
learned about alcohol consumption. (Tr. 40-47, 96-97; AE B; AE F) He abstained from
alcohol consumption from May to November 2017. (Tr. 41, 53) No incident report from
his security record concerning the 2017 OUI was offered as an exhibit at his hearing. (Tr.
102)
Applicant admitted he had a problem with alcohol consumption, and it is a “lifelong
issue” for him. (Tr. 43, 49, 63) He described himself as a “recovering alcoholic.” (Tr. 63)
He decided to limit his alcohol consumption after November 2017 to two standard drinks
in an evening. (Tr. 49, 51-52, 165-166) He claimed he has only consumed about 20 drinks
in the last year, or perhaps it was 24 or 25 drinks. (Tr. 50, 62) He typically drinks no more
than three beers in a weekend or possibly two or four drinks in a month. (Tr. 50-51, 53,
105; SOR response ¶ 39) He may not drink anything for a month. (Tr. 105) He has not
become  intoxicated  since  2017.  (Tr.  53)  He  most  recently  consumed  alcohol  a  month
before his hearing, and on that occasion, he drank one beer. (Tr. 102-103)
Applicant occasionally reviews the workbook he received from his alcohol-related
class  in  2017  to  reinforce  and  refresh  what  he  learned  about  limiting  his  alcohol
consumption.  (Tr.  60,  66,  97;  AE  F)  He  understands  the  risks  of  excessive  alcohol
consumption  and  believes  he  will not  engage  in  excessive  alcohol consumption  in  the
future. (Tr. 66) In June 2021, he moved overseas, and attendance at alcohol counseling
or classes was difficult. (Tr. 100) He attended two sessions over the Internet about alcohol
consumption in 2021 after he received the SOR. (Tr. 61, 97-98) Those two sessions are
the only counseling or treatment he has received for alcohol since 2017. (Tr. 65) He never
had a one-on-one session where an alcohol or medical counselor reviewed his history of
alcohol  consumption.  (Tr.  128)  He  was  never  advised  that  his  history  warranted  a
recommendation of abstinence from alcohol consumption. (Tr. 128)
Applicant  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependence  or  alcohol  use
disorder. (Tr. 113) He exercises to reduce stress. (Tr. 54, 62) He has not engaged in any
questionable conduct after 2017. (Tr. 110) His support group is his girlfriend and a close
friend. (Tr. 64) He does not drive after consuming alcohol. (Tr. 100, 105, 134, 165; SOR
response ¶ 39)
Character Evidence
Applicant had the same supervisor, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, from 2008
to 2020 while working for a DOD contractor. (Tr. 35; AE C) He and another supervisor
described Applicant as honest, reliable, mission focused, and diligent. (Tr. 36, 142-159)
Their  statements  and  statements  from  friends  and  coworkers  support  Applicant’s
continued access to classified information.
Applicant  received  excellent  performance  evaluations  from  the  DOD  contractor.
(Tr. 67; AE G; AE I-AE L) In 2021, he received an award from his employer, and he was
lauded for his trustworthiness and diligence. (AE G)
",False
"The SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR ¶ 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline
J (SOR ¶ 2.a), that Applicant was convicted of a January 2020 driving under the influence
(DUI) offense (SOR ¶ 1.a); that, while intoxicated, he was arrested in September 2018 for
breach of peace for which he had to complete an alcohol-intervention course (SOR ¶ 1.b);
and that, while intoxicated, he was arrested in May 2018 for disorderly conduct for which
he  had  to  complete  court-ordered  community  service  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  Applicant  is  also
alleged under Guideline G to have consumed alcohol at time to excess and intoxication
from about May 2018 to at least January 2020 (SOR ¶ 1.d).
Applicant  provided  a  detailed  response  in  which  he  admitted  the  arrests  and
detailed  the  circumstances  of  each  incident.  He  submitted  in  mitigation  that  he  had
reduced his drinking from previous levels and that he had been assessed and found to
not need a substance abuse or alcohol-intervention program. (AE A.)
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a 25-year-old  college  graduate  with  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  national
security  studies.  During  the  summer  of  2018,  following  his  junior  year  of  college,  and
again during his semester break in January 2019, he worked as an intern for his current
employer, a defense contractor. In early June 2019, he began full-time employment for a
company that contracted his services to his current employer. (GE 5.) He began working
as  a  direct  hire  of  his  defense-contractor  employer  in  December  2020  in  a  position  of
greater  responsibility  than  he  held  as  a  contractor.  (AEs  A,  K;  Tr. 13,  74.)  He  holds  a
secret clearance (Tr. 42), although the date it was granted is not in evidence.
Applicant drank to excess at times while he was in college, especially during his
sophomore year. (AEs A, G; Tr. 82-85.) He drank to the point of blacking out “once every
few  months.”  (Tr.  83.)  There  were  nights  when  he  drank  too  much  and  did  not  drink
responsibly. (Tr. 85.)
In May 2018, Applicant consumed four to five alcohol drinks while celebrating the
end of his junior year in college with some high school friends at a local bar. When he left
the bar, he walked  over to a vehicle  that was the same make and model  as a  friend’s
vehicle. Mistakenly thinking a friend was there to pick him up, he opened the passenger
door and attempted to enter the vehicle. The driver exited the vehicle, started a verbal
altercation,  and  it  escalated  into  a  shoving  match.  Applicant  was  arrested  for
misdemeanor  disorderly  conduct.  (GE  5;  AE  A;  Tr.  51-52.)  He  informed  his  current
supervisor about the incident  when he was  being hired for his summer internship.  (Tr.
29.)
In June 2018, the charge was dismissed, and the record of the charge was sealed,
in exchange for Applicant completing ten hours of community service. Applicant continues
to believe that the charge was expunged from his record. (Tr. 54.)  The police jurisdiction
involved indicates that the charge was expunged from its records, but the court records
show that Applicant’s record was sealed. (AE D.) Applicant fulfilled the community service
requirement  by  recording  the  names  and  locations  of  veterans  buried  in  a  couple  of
cemeteries and placing flags at their graves. (GEs 1, 5; AEs A, C; Tr. 53-54.) The task
took him over 20 hours to complete. (AE C.) Applicant now understands that he should
have walked away when the driver exited his vehicle.  His alcohol consumption and his
pride contributed to his actions that night as he was not one to back down at the time.
(AE A.; Tr. 52-53.)
In  September  2018,  Applicant  was  visited  in  college  by  some  friends  from  high
school. He went with them to a bar, where he consumed some alcohol before proceeding
to a barbecue restaurant where he hung around with his ex-girlfriend of about one month.
She had come from a Happy Hour and was likely intoxicated. She asked him about any
contacts with other females, and at her request, he gave her his cell phone. She became
angry  and  agitated  on  seeing  some  texts  on  his  phone  to  another  female.  Whether
intentionally or not, she hit him in the face with a glass, causing some lacerations to his
nose.  (GE  5;  AE  A;  Tr.  56-57.)  A  friend  of  Applicant’s,  who  was  present  at  the  time,
indicates  that  Applicant  did  not  instigate  or  escalate  the  incident  and  that  Applicant
remained calm and did not react. (AE E.) Applicant admits, however, that after she threw
the glass at him causing injury, he felt “betrayed” and yelled at her. (Tr. 58.) The police
came with an ambulance. Fearing the cost of the ambulance ride, and not thinking clearly
because of the assault and the alcohol he had consumed, he refused the instructions of
the police to get into the ambulance and was charged with breach of peace in the second
degree. Because he had been assaulted, he considered the charge unfair, but he wanted
to put it behind him. On the advice of his attorney, he accepted a plea deal. In return for
dismissal of the charge, he was required to submit himself for an alcohol assessment and
to  comply  with  any  recommended  alcohol-intervention  program  or  substance-abuse
treatment. (GEs 1, 5; AE A; Tr. 59-60.)
Applicant was assessed for substance abuse on November 6, 2018, by a licensed
professional counselor at an outpatient substance-abuse intervention facility. He reported
that he thought he had a problem with alcohol during his sophomore year  of college in
that he found himself “having more in one night,” but he “got over that.” He reported that
he had used alcohol in 10 of the previous 30 days and averaged four beers or four or five
mixed drinks per occasion. At the time, Applicant was struggling with risk factors including
his  legal  involvement,  living  in  an  environment  where  alcohol  use  was  prevalent,  and
socializing with a group of friends who drink. He appeared motivated to complete court
requirements,  including  any  treatment,  and  had  a  supportive  family  and  friends.  The
clinician assessed him with mild alcohol use disorder and recommended that he attend
weekly  intervention  treatment  starting  on  November  12,  2018,
to  explore  the
consequences of his alcohol use, and to also attend individual sessions with the clinician.
(AE G.)
The  clinician  told  Applicant  that  he  was  required  by  the  court  to  attend  “the
minimum  amount,”  which  consisted  of  an  eight-week  course  with  weekly  urinalysis  to
ensure he was abstaining from alcohol. Applicant was required to only attend six weeks
so  that  he  could  finish  it  before  his  winter  break  from  college.  Applicant  successfully
completed intervention and individual services on December 12, 2018 (GE 1; AE F, Tr.
61), and the charge was dismissed in January 2019. (Tr. 62.)
On April 28, 2019, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a Questionnaire
for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  for a  secret-level  clearance  for  his  duties  as  a
contractor in his current employer’s security department. Applicant reported the May 2018
disorderly conduct and September 2018 breach of peace charges, which were dismissed.
About the September 2018 incident, he stated, in part:
I was charged with breach of peace second degree for technically being in
a bar fight, despite me not striking or attempting to strike anyone physically.
I  did  verbally  yell  at  the  girl  after  the  glass  hit  my  face.  The  court  was
concerned that I might have provoked the incident as a result of my drinking
that night so we made an agreement for me to take an alcohol intervention
class in exchange for the charges [sic] to be dropped against me. I did this,
believing it to be the faster option between that and pursuing a court case
against her. Upon the initial screening at the intervention I was told I did not
need any classes but we opted to take the least serious classes anyway. I
passed the course with zero incidents and the case was dismissed. (GE 1.)
In response to an SF 86 inquiry into whether he had ever been ordered, advised,
or  asked  to  seek  counseling  or  treatment  as  a  result  of  his  use  of  alcohol,  Applicant
indicated  that  he  took  an  alcohol-intervention  course  from  October  2018  to  December
2018, and stated:
I  made  a  deal  with  the  family  affairs  court  to  do  an  alcohol  intervention
course to prove that I was not an alcoholic who was provoking altercations.
Upon my initial screening [with] the treatment organization, I was verbally
told that they did not believe that any treatment was necessary but I went
on  with  the least  intensive  course  in order to honor the agreement made
with the court. During that time, I also remained sober. (GE 1.)
Applicant discussed the May 2018 and September 2018 incidents during a May
28,  2019  interview  with  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator.  He
admitted that he had consumed three or four beers before the May 2018 incident, and his
alcohol  consumption  may  have  affected  his judgment.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he
drank two or three beers with dinner before the September 2018 incident, but he did not
believe  his  consumption  of  alcohol  played  any  role  in  that  incident.  Applicant  told  the
investigator that he was currently drinking two or three beers per week, usually in social
settings with friends, but he never drank more than one beer if he has to drive. He claimed
that he had consumed alcohol to intoxication only three times: twice at age 18, when he
first  tried  alcohol and had  three  shots  of  whiskey  and  then  when  he  had  three  or four
beers at a house party; and one other time when he was in college and drank four or five
beers at a house party on campus. He denied that he had a drinking problem and asserted
that he drank responsibly. (GE 5.)
On a Saturday night in January 2020, Applicant drank alcohol to intoxication while
watching football playoffs at a friend’s house. He now recalls having consumed two mixed
drinks and three or four beers. (Tr. 63.) His friends all decided to stay over, and told him
not to drive home. After they had all gone to bed, Applicant made a very poor decision to
drive home around 2:00 a.m. on that Sunday, because he and his father planned to go to
a  basketball  game  later  that  day.  He  was  pulled  over  for  speeding  75  miles  per  hour
(MPH) in a posted 35 MPH zone. He exhibited signs of intoxication, and he told the police
that  he  had  consumed  “a  few  beers.”  He  failed  field  sobriety  tests  (Tr.  64)  and  was
arrested for DUI-first offense with a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of .15 or greater and for
speeding. His BAC tested at .174% initially and then .171% a few minutes later. (GE 2;
AE  A.)  When  he  went  to  work  on  that  Monday,  he  reported  his  arrest  to  his  security
manager. (AE A; Tr. 30.) The security manager, who knew about Applicant’s two incidents
in 2018 (Tr. 30-31) but believed Applicant was not at fault in the September 2018 incident
(Tr. 38), was “devastated  and  surprised” to learn of Applicant’s arrest for DUI.  (Tr. 42.)
The company made a timely report to the DCSA  CAF of the arrest involving Applicant.
(GE 3.)
Applicant pled no contest to the DUI and was ordered to complete his state’s driver
retraining program; comply with an alcohol assessment and any treatment recommended;
complete 20 hours of community service; and pay a fine of about $500. His driver’s license
was  to  be  suspended  for  30  days,  but  on  his  application,  he  was  granted  a  hardship
license to drive to and from work with an Interlock device installed on his vehicle. He had
no violations of the Interlock device. In July 2020, the device and all driving restrictions
were removed. For his community service, Applicant cleaned a trailer owned by the scout
troop through which he had attained the rank of Eagle Scout. (AEs H-I; Tr. 66-67.)
At the start of the driver’s training program, Applicant was assessed on November
9,  2020,  via  a  virtual  platform  due  to  COVID-19,  by  a  licensed  chemical  dependency
professional (LCDP). He admitted that he was intoxicated on the occasion of his January
2020  arrest and  that he  made  a bad decision  to operate  a motor vehicle.  He  reported
current consumption of three or four drinks once a week. He denied any urges to drink
alcohol or any withdrawal symptoms. While the clinician believed Applicant might have a
mild alcohol use disorder, she did not refer him to substance abuse counseling, but opined
that he would likely benefit from driving while intoxicated (DWI) classes to reduce the risk
of recidivism and to gain education and insight. (AE J.) Applicant attended the classes,
which he indicates were required of all first-time offenders in the driver retraining program,
in December 2020. (AEs A, J; Tr. 68.) Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the DWI classes
were delayed and eventually held online. (AEs A, J.) With his completion of the classes,
Applicant  fulfilled  all  the  requirements  of  his  sentence  for  the  DUI.  (Tr.  68.)  Applicant
considers  his  decision  to  drive  after  drinking  to  intoxication  in  January 2020  the  worst
decision of his life to present. (Tr. 69.)
Applicant  was  re-interviewed  for  the  OPM  on  June  8,  2020.  About  his  January
2020  arrest,  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  consumed  four  beers  and  two
mixed  drinks while  at a friend’s house  watching football. He admitted that he had been
stopped for speeding and failed field sobriety tests; that while he initially pled not guilty to
DUI,  he  pled  nolo  contendere  in  early  March  2020.  He  explained  that  his  family,
supervisor, co-workers, and current girlfriend were all aware of his arrest. He denied any
chance of  recurrence as he had learned his lesson and  did not want to jeopardize his
employment  and  security  clearance.  When  asked  to  detail  his  alcohol  use  since  his
previous interview conducted in May 2019, he stated that prior to his January 2020 arrest,
he drank three or four days per week in quantity of three to four drinks at a sitting; that he
became intoxicated half the time; and that his drink of choice was and still is beer and
Irish whiskey. He explained that he had taken no steps to reduce his alcohol consumption
as he did not see his drinking to be a problem. After his DUI, he continued to drink beer
and whiskey but in quantity of only two or three drinks at a time, and only once a week,
usually on Friday nights after work. He stated that he reduced his alcohol consumption
after discussing his arrest and the impact of his drinking with his supervisor. (GE 4.)
At his hearing, Applicant testified that he did not always drink responsibly when he
was younger, but it did not rise to the level of a substance-abuse problem:
I’ll fully admit when I was younger and less responsible  of  my alcohol that I
had  issues and  I didn’t behave  as appropriately with it as I do now. But there
was no substance abuse issue that I had that directly caused these issues.
Alcohol   certainly   contributed,   but   it  wasn’t   an  issue  that  I  ignored  or
otherwise  let  get  out  of  control  that  caused  these  instances.  But  just
because  I did not  have  a  problem  with  these  doesn’t mean  that I  didn’t take
what happened very seriously. (Tr. 70.)
Applicant presently drinks alcohol only on the weekends, but not every weekend.
He no longer drinks to intoxication because he realizes the trouble it caused him, and he
does not want to jeopardize his employment or security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 73, 89-
90.) He drank one beer at a social function with co-workers on June 4, 2022. (Tr. 88.)
Applicant  no  longer  socializes  with  the  college  friends  with  whom  he  drank  in
college.  (Tr.  91.)  He  continues  to  socialize  with  the  high  school  friends  with  whom  he
drank on the occasion of  his DUI, and he went to a concert with them in August 2021
where at least one of his friends became intoxicated. Applicant drank one beer that night.
He made sure that this friend arrived home safely. These friends know of his arrest for
DUI and do not pressure him to drink more. (Tr. 94-95.)
Applicant bought a house in May 2022. (Tr. 13, 99.) He is currently in a cohabitant
relationship with his girlfriend. They began dating in April 2019. His girlfriend consumes
alcohol but not on a regular basis. (Tr. 92.)
Character References
Applicant currently runs the badge control and visitor management office for their
facility, and he is directly managed by the supervisor for security services. This supervisor
authored  character  reference  letters  for  Applicant  in  September  2018  (AE  B)  and
September  2021  (AEs  A,  K),  and  he  also  testified.  (Tr.  28-42.)  He  gives  Applicant  his
highest  recommendation,  having  observed  Applicant  as  a  summer  intern,  contract
employee,  and  as  a  direct  hire  into  the  security  department.  This  security  manager
considers  Applicant  to  be  “one  of  the  most  amazing  people  [he  has]  ever  met  in  [his]
professional career.” Applicant has demonstrated his value to their department. Willing to
help others and take on extra tasks, he has a work ethic which the supervisor considers
as  “nothing  short  of  amazing.”  The  supervisor  asserts  that  he  “cannot  think  of  anyone
more loyal and trustworthy to have in that position.” (AEs A, K; Tr. 35-36.) Applicant timely
reported the incidents in the SOR to him, including that alcohol was involved, although
not  the  details  of  the  quantities  of  alcohol  consumed.  (Tr.  29-30.)  At  the  time,  the
supervisor scolded him (“I was point blank with him. But then I beat him up a little bit. I
dusted him off, then I put him back to work.”).  (Tr. 42.) He believes Applicant made “a
few  bad  judgment  calls  as  he  was  transitioning  from  a  young  adult,”  and  deserves  a
second chance. Applicant has shown “extreme remorse,” and has taken responsibility for,
and learned from, his mistakes. (AEs A, K; Tr. 31-36.) The supervisor has socialized with
Applicant  outside  of  work  and  has  seen  him  consume  alcohol.  Applicant  drank
responsibly in those instances. (Tr. 39-40.) The supervisor testified that he will fight for
Applicant to stay in his department should Applicant lose his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 40.)
The assistant FSO has also been familiar with Applicant’s work performance since
2018. She was charged with delegating and assigning some tasks to Applicant during his
internship, and he displayed a great work ethic. In 2021, she sat on his interview board
for a permanent position with their employer. Applicant impressed her as someone who
will  progress  within the  company. As the  facility’s badge  control officer, he  works daily
with personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive information (including classified
information).  The  assistant  FSO  has  never  questioned  Applicant’s  ability  to  properly
handle and safeguard that information. He takes national security “extremely seriously.”
(AEs A, O.) He completed PII training on December 8, 2021. (AE N.)
The chief of the human resources at Applicant’s worksite found Applicant “unique
in his professionalism and poise, even as a young intern.” Applicant paid attention to detail
in every task assigned, and he stood out as a very good teammate. As a contractor, and
now as a member of the security team, he continued to demonstrate his value to their
employer. (AEs A, L.)
A co-worker with whom Applicant has worked closely indicates that Applicant has
been  “diligent,  attentive  to  detail, dependable, reliable,  and  an  absolute  professional.” A
self-starter,  Applicant  sees  projects  through  to  their  completion.  He  has  also  been  a
reliable and dependable friend to this co-worker. (AEs A, M.)

September  2021.  He  is  single.  Applicant  received  a  Doctorate  in  August  2021.  He  is
seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  work  with  the  Defense
Department. This is his first application for a security clearance.
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  four  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
1.a  and  1.d.  Applicant  used  marijuana  approximately  seven  to  nine  times  between
2015 and October 2020. His usage included  smoking marijuana  and consuming edibles.
He purchased  marijuana  on  a  single occasion  in 2018.  HIs  October  2020  marijuana  use
occurred  when  he  visited  friends in  a  state  where the  purchase  and  use  of  marijuana  is
legal. He further testified  that he  stopped  marijuana  use  because  he  really  did  not like  it
and  he  wanted  to  move  on  with  his career.  (Tr. 21-27, 42-44,  46;  Government Exhibit 1
at Section  23; Government Exhibit 2.)
1.b   and   1.c.   Applicant   purchased   and   used   psilocybin  mushrooms  on   a   single
occasion   in   about   July   2020   with   friends.  He  realizes  that  the   purchase   and   use   of
mushrooms was illegal. He has no  intention  of using  or purchasing  any  mushrooms in the
future,   admitting   that   this  was  an   impulsive   mistake.  He  is no   longer  in  touch   with   the
person from  whom  he obtained the mushrooms. (Tr. 44-45, 54; Government Exhibit 1  at
Section 23; Government Exhibit 2.)
Applicant submitted a Statement of Intent. In that Statement he indicated that he
is not currently using any controlled substances, that he has no future intent to use any
illegal  controlled  substances  or  misuse  prescription  medication,  and  he  stipulated  to
random  drug  testing  and  the  immediate  and  unqualified  revocation  of  his  security
clearance in the event of a positive drug test. (Applicant Exhibit G.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline G  –  Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he consumes intoxicants to excess. Applicant denied the single allegation under
this paragraph.
2.a.  Applicant admitted  that he  has consumed  alcohol, occasionally  to  intoxication,
starting  in  about  March  2018  through  December  2021.  He  testified  that  he  has  reduced
his  drinking   “significantly”  because   he   is   too   busy   with   his   job   and   healthy   personal
lifestyle   to   engage   in  excessive   alcohol  consumption.  He   has  had   no   alcohol-related
arrests  or  incidents   at   any   time   in  his  past.   There  is  no   evidence   that  he   has  been
diagnosed with an alcohol problem.  A current coworker submitted a  statement  indicating
that  he  has  not seen  the  Applicant  drink to  the  point  of  intoxication  during  the  time  he  has
known him. (Tr. 27-39, 45-46; Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit D.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  conduct  that  shows  poor  judgment,  untrustworthiness  or
unreliability. Applicant denied subparagraph 3.a. He admitted the other two allegations.
3.a.  This  subparagraph  alleged  that  Applicant socializes with  individuals who  use
illegal  substances.  Applicant  testified   that  he   has  informed   the   people  he   used   illegal
substances  with  earlier  that they  could  not do  that  in  front  of him.  He  believes that these
people will support  him  in this endeavor. Applicant Exhibit F is a  statement  from  a  friend
concerning  Applicant’s  decision  not to  be  around  people who  use  illegal substances. (Tr.
46-49.)
3.b.   The   Government   alleges  in  this  subparagraph   that  Applicant’s  drug   use
history, as set forth  under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E.
3.c.   The   Government  alleges  in  this  subparagraph   that  Applicant’s  alcohol   use
history, as set forth  under Paragraph  2, above, is also cognizable under Guideline  E.
Mitigation
Applicant received an evaluation from a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist
(LMFT) who is also an Addiction Treatment Counselor. Her report is dated June 6, 2022,
and is Applicant Exhibit H. Based on her evaluation of Applicant using various diagnostic
criteria  she  reported,  “[Applicant]  does  not  fit  any  of  the  criteria;  thus  no  evidence  of
misuse of drugs or alcohol. He has not experienced any adverse effects or consequences
consistent with the misuse of substances.”
The therapist further stated, “Lastly, my impression of [Applicant] is that he is an
honest, reliable, hard-working individual. He also made it clear to me that a career is of
the  utmost  importance  to  him  and  he  would  not  do  anything  to  jeopardize  such  a  life-
changing opportunity.”
As stated, Applicant Exhibit D is a letter from a coworker. The witness writes that
Applicant is an effective member of the team stating, “He [Applicant] is honest about his
work and someone I can trust to put forth his best work.”
The record shows that Applicant had a successful academic career. In addition to
school,  he  also  engaged  in  extra-curricular  activities  that  helped  his  community.
(Applicant Exhibits A through C.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  been  very  successful  in  his  first  year  with  his
employer. He was nominated for and received an award for his hard work. (Tr. 19-21.)

"Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  about  December  2016.  He  has  a  high  school  diploma,
earned  a  certificate  from  a  technical  college,  and  attended  college  courses  without
earning  an  undergraduate  degree.  Applicant  served  on  active  duty  with  the  U.S.  Air
Force from 1983 until 1999, earning an honorable discharge. He then served on active
duty with the U.S. Air Force Reserve from 2000 until 2004, again earning an honorable
discharge.  Applicant  estimated  that  he  was  involved  in  40  to  50  foreign  missions.  He
has been married since 1984 and has one adult child. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-20; GE 1, 2;
AE A)
Applicant  has  a  significant  history  of  alcohol-related  criminal  offenses.  In  about
January 1999, he was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in State A. Applicant
had been drinking at a bar and decided to drive home after a taxi cab he called did not
show  up.  Applicant  also  claimed  that  he  sought  assistance  with  a  cab  from  someone
who  worked  at  the  bar,  but  they  would  not  help  him.  He  had  a  .15  or  higher  blood
alcohol  content  (BAC)  at  the  time  of  his  arrest.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  DWI.  Applicant’s
driver’s  license  was suspended  for a  year and  he  was placed  on  probation  for a  year.
He  was  also  required to  undergo  court-ordered  alcohol-related  counseling and  he  had
to  pay $500 in fines. Applicant  did not  believe  that he had a drinking problem  and did
not undertake alcohol-related counseling beyond that mandated by the court. Applicant
did not list this arrest in his 2018 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86).
He  also  admitted  to  this  offense  during  his  2018  security  interview  only  after  being
confronted by his investigator. (Tr. 20-22, 37, 42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  stopped  drinking  for  about  five  or  six  years  after  his
1999 DWI arrest until about 2006. He stopped drinking during this time period because
of his military obligations and because he was often on-call for work. Applicant claimed
that  from  2006  until 2010,  he  drank occasionally,  but did not  get  “hammered.”  (Tr. 37,
42-43)
Despite  allegedly  not  consuming  alcohol  during  this  time  period,  Applicant  was
arrested  in  July  2004  in  State  A  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI).
According  to  the  police  report,  he  was  pulled  over  for  speeding  after  driving  his
motorcycle 62 miles per hour in a location where the speed limit was 35 miles per hour.
The  police  officer  reported  that  Applicant  had  trouble  stabilizing  his  motorcycle  during
the stop and the officer smelled the strong odor of alcohol from Applicant’s person and
breath. While Applicant claimed that he was not drinking alcohol at the time, the police
officer reported that Applicant told him that he had a “few.” Applicant denied having this
conversation  with  the  police  officer  or  that  he  made  the  statement  that  he  had  been
drinking.  The  police  officer  noted  that  Applicant  had  a  hard  time  keeping  his  balance
and  had  a  “staggering  walk.”  Applicant  refused  field  sobriety  tests,  reportedly  stating,
“not just no, but hell no,” and was arrested. He also refused to provide a breath sample.
Applicant  claimed  that  he  was  not  drinking  and  refused  the  field  sobriety  tests  and
breath sample based on the advice of his attorney from his 1999 DWI. He also believed
that  he  was  being  unfairly  targeted  by  the  local  authorities  because  of  a  personal
grudge  and  for  “political  reasons.”  Applicant  pleaded  not  guilty.  His  plan  was  to  go  to
trial to  try to  expose  what  he  considered  to be  corruption,  but  he claimed  that he  was
not permitted to put on evidence at trial of his being unfairly targeted. He was tried and
convicted  by  a  jury  of  DUI.  Applicant’s  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  a  year.  He
spent two days in jail and had to pay approximately $1,500 in fines. He was placed on
supervised probation for approximately 16 months. Applicant denied the SOR allegation
relating to this arrest because he believes that the arrest was improper and because the
SOR alleged that the arrest occurred in State B when it actually took place in State A.
He admitted at hearing that the SOR allegation referring to the 2004 DUI arrest would
have  been  accurate  had  it  alleged  that  the arrest  occurred  in  State  A.  Applicant  knew
that the allegation concerning the 2004 DUI arrest in State B was, in actuality, referring
to the 2004 DUI arrest in State A. I base this finding on his admission that the allegation
would  have  been  accurate  had  the  location  been  changed  and  his  ability  to  describe
with specificity the circumstances surrounding the 2004 DUI arrest, as well as what he
perceived to be its factual and procedural shortcomings. I also base this finding on the
lack of any other DUI arrest, regardless of jurisdiction, within approximately five years of
the 2004 arrest. (Tr. 20-21, 23-25, 43-46; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6)
In June 2010, Applicant was involved in a single vehicle accident in State B. His
injuries  as  a  result  of  this  accident  were  severe  enough  that  he  had  to  be  flown  by
helicopter to a nearby hospital. The police officer who responded to the accident noted
that  Applicant  smelled  of  alcohol  and  that  there  were  several  empty  beer  cans  near
Applicant and the crashed vehicle. The police officer did not charge Applicant with DUI
at the scene because of the seriousness of his injuries, but requested that the hospital
draw blood from Applicant so that it could be tested for alcohol. The hospital performed
a blood draw of Applicant while he was being treated for his injuries and the result was
a BAC of  .351. Applicant remained in the hospital for about three days. A few months
later, the police officer who responded to the accident personally served Applicant with
a citation for DUI. Applicant acknowledged that he was impaired by alcohol at the time
of the accident and that he had been drinking alone while fishing. Applicant claimed that
his BAC was incorrectly calculated, as he speculated without any basis, that the testing
could not account for the time lapse between the blood draw and the testing. Applicant
does  not  believe  that  he  had  a  drinking  problem  at  the  time  and  did  not  undergo  any
alcohol  counseling  as  a  result  of  this  accident.  He  denied  the  SOR  allegation  alleging
this incident because he believes that he was never charged with or convicted of DUI.
Despite  the  seriousness  of  the  accident  and  Applicant’s  extremely  high  BAC,  the
charges  against  him  were  dismissed.  (Tr.  26,  28,  30-31,  38-44,  46-49;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5)
In about December 2017, Applicant was arrested in State B and charged with his
fourth  DUI.  Applicant  was  arrested  after  another  person  driving  on  the  same  road
reported to police that they saw his vehicle weaving on the road. Applicant claimed that
he was not intoxicated at the time. He admitted to having had about six ounces of liquor,
but  claimed  that  he  was  weaving  because  his  dog  that  was  in  his  car  distracted  him.
Applicant failed  his field sobriety  test  as it was discontinued  because  he  fell  twice while
performing   it.   Applicant  again  refused   any   chemical  tests   to   determine   his  BAC,   but  a
judge   issued   a   warrant  for   two   vials  of  his   blood.   Police   took  two   vials  of  Applicant’s
blood  pursuant to  the  search warrant and  his blood  was tested  for  alcohol.  The  results
of   the   test  were  that  Applicant  had   a   .14   BAC  with   a   level  of  confidence   greater  than
99.73%.  Applicant  was  convicted,  had   to   attend   alcohol   counseling,  which   he
completed,  and   had   an   ignition   interlock   device   installed   on   his  vehicle   for  two   years.
After his 2017  conviction, he  admitted  that  he  had  a  problem  with  alcohol.  He claimed
that  he  modified  his  behavior by  drinking  less  alcohol  and  taking  more taxis and  Ubers.
He stated  that  he  switched  to  only  drinking  beer and  cutting  out  hard  liquor. He  testified
that after his 2017 DUI, he only drinks a couple of beers on a weekend and he no longer
drinks and  drives. Applicant also credits having  his wife  move  to  State  B in May  2022  to
live  together full  time  as a  positive  factor that keeps  him  out of  trouble.  (Tr. 26-30, 32-
33, 35-36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE  2, 4)
There  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  has  been  diagnosed  with  an  alcohol  use
disorder.  Applicant  claimed  that  no  alcohol  counselor  or  medical  professional  has
advised  him  to  stop  drinking,  but  did  not  provide  any  other  evidence  of  treatment
recommendations.  He  has  not  undergone  any  alcohol  counseling  beyond  what  was
court ordered. He claimed that he has reduced his drinking from a 12 pack of beer over
the course of a weekend to “pretty much nothing” in about 2010. He acknowledged that
he  continued  to  drink and  drive  between 2010  and  2017,  but  that he  has not  done  so
after  his  2017  DUI.  He  claimed  that  the  higher  amount  of  alcohol he  drank  before  his
2017 DUI was an aberration. (Tr. 35-41)

"In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR ¶ 1.a and
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b, with explanations. His admissions and
explanations are incorporated into these findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old. He earned a high school diploma in May 1992. He is
married, for the second time. He has two adult children who were born in 1992 and 1999,
several  years  before  his  first  marriage.  He  has  never  served  in  the  military  or  been
employed  by  the  government  of  the  United  States.  He  said  that  the  DoD  granted  him
some level of local clearance, which was required for him to work as a bus driver under
an Army support services contract, from August to September 2019. This clearance was
revoked when he was fired for failing a breath alcohol test. He is seeking national security
eligibility in connection with his current employment at the same Army installation, by a
different defense contractor, as a Fuel Ammunition Specialist.  (Item 2; Item 3.)
Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Liquor (DUI) on October
3, 2001, according to a state criminal history report (Item 5.)  The local municipal court
prosecutor  declined  to  prosecute  the  case,  and  it  was  dismissed  (nolle  pros.)  on
November 19, 2001. Since submitting his November 13, 2019 Electronic Questionnaire
for Investigations Processing, Applicant has denied having ever been arrested for DUI. In
his  Answer  he  said  he  does  not  recall  this  incident.  No  evidence  regarding  his  blood
alcohol content (BAC) after this arrest appears in the FORM. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 5.)
Applicant began working as a refueler at a U.S. Army airfield in September 2015.
This was his first employment by a DoD support-services contractor. He was fired from
that job for two reasons related to an aviation fuel spill that he caused. On January 24,
2019, his employment was “terminated effective immediately due to [his] refusal  to take
a  drug  test  after  [his]  accident  on  January  22,  2019.”  On  January  31,  2019,  after
completing  its  investigation  of  the  incident,  the  company  also  “terminated  [his
employment] effective immediately due to negligence and violation of safety protocol and
procedure before, during, and after a major fuel spill involving a fuel truck and helicopter.”
Applicant claimed that his employer had no training program and that he was not properly
trained to handle emergency shutdown procedures. He also claimed that the company
did not relieve him of duty to go take a drug test, but instead told him to clean up the fuel
spill and then resume work, after which he went home. He said that after resting for at
least ten hours at home, he went to a clinic and “followed up with the required drug testing,
which  [he]  passed.”  He  offered  no  corroboration  for  these  explanations,  which  are
incongruous with the quoted language of the formal letters of termination issued by his
employer two and nine days later. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 3; Item 6.)
A  different  support  services  contractor  at  the  same  Army  installation  hired
Applicant in August 2019 to work as a bus driver. On the morning of September 3, 2019,
he  was  scheduled  to  drive  a  bus  full  of  flight  school  students  to  a  location  that  is  not
identified in the FORM. Before the bus departed, another company employee notified the
project manager that Applicant smelled of alcohol and he was sent to a medical clinic for
a breath alcohol test. At 12:44 that afternoon his blood alcohol content (BAC) tested at
.079; followed by a reading of .073 on the confirmation test administered 16 minutes later.
The project manager fired Applicant in a letter dated the same day for this direct violation
of  the  company’s  safety  and  security  policies.  Applicant  admitted  these  facts,  and
explained that he was not aware he smelled of alcohol  when he reported to work after
staying up late and drinking at home the night before. He said that he does not remember
how much or what he was drinking. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 3; Item 4; AE A.)
Applicant  said  that  he  is  not  dependent  on  alcohol  anymore  and  it  no  longer
controls his life, although he attended no treatment program and continues to drink. He
said that his awareness of his past mistakes has made him a better man, husband, and
employee. He claimed, without providing further detail, that he voluntarily attended some
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) support sessions during 2019. He submitted letters signed
by  two  coworkers  who  had  known  him  for  five  months,  in  which  they  describe  his
dedication,  professionalism,  integrity,  excellent  performance,  and  skills  working  with
others.  I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since
he elected to have his case decided without a hearing. (Item 3; AE A.)

"Applicant is 43 years old. He married in September 2020. He has three children,
ages  21,  17,  and  15,  and  his  wife  has  two  children,  ages  17  and  13,  from  a  prior
relationship. Applicant received a high school diploma in 1998 and attended a technical
institute for two years, but did not receive a degree or certification. He enlisted in the U.S.
Navy in December 1998, but in April 2000 he was administratively discharge under Other
Than  Honorable  conditions.  He  held  a  security  clearance  while  serving  in  the  Navy.
Applicant  has  experienced  two  periods  of  unemployment  since  2016  (August  2016  to
September 2017 and December 210 to March 2019). He has been employed by a DoD
contractor as an artisan since March 2019. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance
in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 23-25; GE 1 at 14-16.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 1 are as follows:
1.a.   March  2000  Non-Judicial  Punishment  (NJP)
for  Drunkenness  and
Incapacitation  for  the  Performance  of  Duties.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his
Answer. He was too drunk to report for duty. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 27, 32; GE 2 at 19.)
1.b.   June  2008  Charge  of  Felony  Battery  resulted  from  an  incident  in  which
Applicant  was  under the  influence  of  alcohol.  Applicant denied  the battery  charge,  but
admitted that he  was under the influence of  alcohol at the  time of  the dispute  with  his
domestic partner and unplugged the house phone while his domestic partner was making
a call to 911. He was taken to jail intoxicated. The record evidence reflects that the battery
charge was a misdemeanor. The altercation was just verbal and there were no injuries.
The  record  evidence  also  reflects  that  the  offense  of  maliciously  obstructing  a
communication  device  is  also  a  misdemeanor.  Neither  the  battery  charge  nor  the
obstruction of the call charge were prosecuted. Applicant recalls pleading guilty to being
drunk. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 28, 32-35; GE 8 at 17; GE 9 at 2, 4.)
1.c.  November  2008  charge  of  Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol  (DUI).
Applicant admitted that he pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of DUI and was ordered
to  complete  a  DUI  program.  He  was  given  a  sentence  of  probation  for five  years.  His
driver’s license was also suspended. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 28, 35-36; GE 7 at 3.)
1.d.  February 2009 charge of Drunk in Public amended at the hearing to Driving
on Suspended License (DSL). Applicant denied the original allegation because he has no
memory of any such charge or arrest. Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to
conform  to  the  Government’s  evidence.  According  to  that  evidence,  Applicant  was
actually cited for DSL at that time. Applicant admitted this amended allegation. He was
sentenced to probation for three years. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 29, 35-37; GE 8 at 10; GE 10
at 8.)
1.e. March 2010 charges of  DUI and DSL and failure to complete court-ordered
DUI program. In his Answer Applicant admitted the arrest on that date and the charges.
He was on probation at that time for his 2008 DUI and his DSL convictions. He pled guilty
to misdemeanor DUI and was sentenced to probation for five years. The court ordered
him to attend a program for multiple DUI offenders. He denied part of the SOR allegation
because he disputed the Government’s claim that he had not completed the DUI program.
He testified that he completed the program, but his certificate of completion was never
submitted to the court. He requested the program manger to provide a duplicate certificate
to the court, and he submitted a copy of the certificate into evidence at the DOHA hearing.
The  certificate  reflects  that  Applicant  enrolled  in  the  course  in  October  2012  and
completed it in November 2016. He attributed the delay in enrolling and completing the
course to his inability to pay the fees associated with the program. It took him about four
years to complete an 18-month program. He claims that he sought extensions from the
court when he could not continue the program for financial reasons. (Answer at 2; Tr. at
29-30, 38-39; GE 7 at 3; AE A.)
1.f. April 2010 charges of DUI and DSL. Applicant asserts that these charges are
the same as those alleged in 1.e. The time difference between the two alleged dates is
only six days. He noted that during this period, he had no access to his vehicle, which
had been taken from him by the police. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 30, 39-40.)
1.g. August 2016 charges of DUI, DSL, Spousal Battery, and maliciously/unlawfully
removing  telephone.  At  the  hearing  Department  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  SOR
allegation  by  deleting  the  phrase  “maliciously/unlawfully  removed  telephone”  on  the
ground  that  this  charge  was  part  of  the  charges  filed  against  Applicant  and  alleged  in
SOR  1.b,  above,  and was  not  a  part of  the 2016  charges.  Applicant  denied  the  entire
allegation.  He  believes  that  his  criminal  records  are  wrong  or  they  have  been
misinterpreted  in the  preparation  of the  SOR.  He asserted  that he  has only  had  two  DUIs
(2008  and  2010)  and  the  battery  charge  is a  duplicate  of  the  2008  charge. At the  hearing,
Applicant denied  the  DUI charge, but  admitted  he  was cited  for DSL  due  to  the  lack  of a
record  evidencing   his   completion   of  the   court-ordered   course   that   was  part   of  his
sentence  for the  2010  DUI.  He argued  that his driver’s  license  should  never have  been
suspended.  He claimed  that  the  DSL  charge  was withdrawn  after  he  established  that  he
had completed  the  program  by  producing  a  duplicate  of  his certificate  of  completion. I find
Applicant’s  testimony   regarding   the   DSL   charge   to   be   credible   and   that   the   SOR
allegation regarding other charges is based upon incorrect information. (Answer at 2; Tr.
at 30, 40-45; GE 2 at 23; GE 7  at 4; GE 8 at  3, 21-24; GE 10 at 3.)
Applicant has never received any in-patient treatment for alcohol abuse. He has
never been diagnosed with alcohol dependence or abuse. (Tr. at 45-46.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 2 are as follows:
2.a.  March   2000   Non-Judicial  Punishment   for  testing   positive   for  marijuana.
Applicant was administratively  discharged   from  the  Navy   under Other Than  Honorable
conditions  as   a   result  of   failing   a   drug   test   on   March  2,  2000.  Applicant  admitted   this
allegation. He commented  that he  was 19  years old at the  time  and  was influenced  by  his
friends and  peers. He  regrets the  choices he  made  at that  time.  (Answer at 2, 5; Tr. at  49-
51; GE 6.)
2.b. Applicant used marijuana from 2000 until June 5, 2013. Applicant denied this
allegation on the ground that the June 5, 2013 date is incorrect. That date is his official
“clean date” for abstaining from both illegal drugs and alcohol. His last use of marijuana
was in 2012, the year in which he gained custody of two of his children. The information
in the report of his background interview about drug use until June 2013 is the result of a
misunderstanding by the investigator. That date only applies to his last use of alcohol.
(Answer at 2, 5; Tr. at 50-51; GE 2 at 20, 23.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The  SOR  sets  forth  three  allegations  of  omissions  in  Applicant’s  e-QIP  that
resulted in false answers. The details regarding the SOR falsification allegations set forth
in this paragraph and Applicant’s responses are as follows:
3.a.   Failure  to  disclose  his  use  of  marijuana  in  the  seven  years  preceding  April
2019 in his response to Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs in the e-QIP. Applicant ceased
using marijuana in 2012 when he was granted full physical custody of two of his children.
He understood that responsibility required him to be drug-free. He did not list his last use
of marijuana sometime in 2012 because it was about seven years prior to the date of his
e-QIP  and  disclosure was not required  under the  question’s seven-year time limitation.
He credibly testified that the information in GE 2 regarding drug use until June 5, 2013, is
a misunderstanding. That date only applies to use last use of alcohol. (Tr. at 52-53; GE 2
at 20.)
3.b.  Failure  to  disclose  in  his  response  to  Section  22  - Police  Record  all  of  his
offenses involving alcohol and drug use during the period 2000 to August 2016 and an
alleged felony charge. Applicant was never charged with a felony, so he had nothing to
report in response to the e-QIP question regarding past felony charges. The same is true
with respect to the alleged 2016 DUI. Applicant disclosed his 2010 DUI arrest in response
to  Section  22,  and  in  response  to  Section  24  –  Use  of  Alcohol,  he  disclosed  the  DUI
offenders program he was ordered to take. He failed to respond correctly to a follow-up
question in Section 22 that asks for other instances of certain types of charges including
alcohol and drugs. As a result, he failed to list his 2008 DUI charge and his 2000 NJPs
for  alcohol  intoxication  and  drug  use.  He  failed  to  list  these  incidents  due  to
misunderstanding  the  question  and  acknowledges  that  he  answered  the  question
incorrectly. He said that he filled out the questionnaire, which he described as lengthy,
after  a  long  day  of  work,  and  he  did  not  clearly  understand  the  question.  He  credibly
testified that he had no intention to mislead the Government or to withhold this derogatory
information  from  many  years  ago.  In  his  background  interview,  he  volunteered  the
information regarding 2008 DUI before being confronted. (Tr. at 54-57; GE 1 at 31-32,
33-34; GE 2 at 7, 10.)
3.c. Failure to disclose his delinquent debts incurred in the seven years preceding
April 2019 in his response to Section 26 – Financial Record. Applicant credibly testified
that he failed to disclose his delinquent debts and repossessed vehicle due to oversight.
He acknowledged that he answered the question incorrectly. He said he was not prepared
to respond to these detailed financial questions. He did not have a credit report at the
time  he  prepared  his  responses  to  the  e-QIP  questions,  and  he  mistakenly  did  not
disclose certain debts in response to the questions. He had no intention to mislead the
Government about his debts. In his July 2019 background interview, Applicant discussed
his  debts  at  length  indicating  that  he  had  no  intent  to  shield  information  from  the
Government in his e-QIP. (Tr. at 55, 57-58; GE 2 at 10-18.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
is
financially  overextended  and
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
because  he
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
identifies eight past-due debts that have been referred to collection or charged off. The
debts total about $23,000. In his Answer, Applicant denied all of the allegations under this
guideline, except one (4.b). (Answer at 3-4, 7-8.)
The current status of the allegations in paragraph 4 of the SOR is as follows:
4.a.   Credit  union  account  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $14,888.  This  debt  is  a
vehicle loan account. Applicant defaulted on paying the monthly loan payments in 2016
during  a  period  of  unemployment  from  August  2016  to  September  2017..  In  2020  he
entered into a payment plan agreement with the creditor and has been paying this account
monthly.  GE  3  and  4  confirm  that  Applicant  is  “paying  under  a  partial  payment
agreement.” This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 59-60; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4.)
4.b. Credit account in collection in the approximate amount of $1,263.  Applicant
paid this debt after his July 2019 background interview, possibly in 2020. He does not
have  a  receipt.  The  account  does  not  appear  on  the  most  recent  credit  report  in  the
record, dated March 31, 2022. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 60-61; GE 3; GE 4 at 2; GE
5 at 6.)
4.c. Credit account in collection in the approximate amount of $878. The original
creditor on this account is the same creditor as the one listed in 4.b, above. Applicant
testified that he only had one account with this creditor. In 2021 he disputed this debt with
the  credit  bureaus.  He  believes  his  dispute  is  still  under  investigation.  He  provided  no
evidence regarding the dispute. The credit reports in the record do not reflect that this
debt is disputed. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 61-62; GE 4 at 2.)
4.d.   Collection  account  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $593.  This  account  was
originally a credit-card account. Applicant paid this debt in May 2021. He provided proof
of payment of the debt. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 62-63; GE 4 at 2-3; GE 5 at
12; AE C.)
4.e. Payday loan account in collection in the approximate amount of  $315.  This
account became delinquent after Applicant prepared his e-QIP. Applicant paid this debt
in late 2020 or early 2021. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 63; GE 2 at 11; GE 4 at
3; GE 5 at 12.)
4.f. Credit union account in collection in the approximate amount of $815. Applicant
defaulted  on  paying  this  credit-card  account  in  late  2016  or  early  2017  when  he  was
unemployed. Applicant settled this debt for less than the full balance, as evidenced by a
credit report in the record, dated January 5, 2021 (GE 4). The settlement was paid in June
2020. Applicant provided proof of the resolution of this debt. This debt has been resolved.
(Tr. at 63; GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 5; AE B.)
4.g.  Collection account in the approximate amount of $4,516. Applicant disputed
this  account  in  about  April  2021  because  he  does  not  know  what  it  is.  The  dispute  is
confirmed  by  the  Government’s  March  31,  2022  credit  report  in  the  record  (GE  3).
Applicant called the original creditor identified in his credit report (Creditor A) and learned
that it is an online lender. He claimed that he has never taken out a loan from Creditor A.
His dispute has not been resolved. In his background interview, Applicant admitted that
he   received   a   loan   in   the   amount   of  $3,000   from   Creditor  A   in   May   2016   and   that  he
became  delinquent  on  the  loan  in  August  2016  due  to  limited  financial resources during
periods  of   unemployment.   Government   Exhibit  5   confirms  Applicant’s  loan   for  $3,000
from  Creditor A  and  the  dates  he  provided  to  the  investigator. This  debt  is  unresolved.
(Tr. at  64; GE 2 at 16; GE 3  at 5; GE 5  at 4.)
4.h.   Medical  account  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $294.  Applicant  does  not
recognize  this  debt.  He  insists  that  in  2019  and  2020  he  had  a  state-funded  medical
insurance policy for low-income families that has no co-pays. The date on which Applicant
became delinquent on this account is not apparent in the Government’s credit reports and
it  only  appears  on  the  oldest  report,  dated  May  11,  2019.  Applicant  has  reviewed  his
recent credit report and this debt does not appear on it. He has not taken any action to
dispute this debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 64; GE 2 at 11; GE 5 at 12.)
Mitigation
Applicant  summarized  his  life’s  journey  in  a  brief  statement  (AE  K).  He
acknowledged his history of misconduct when he was young and irresponsible. He also
admitted that  he  has a  history of  losing jobs  and encountering financial  difficulties.  He
wrote that he began to change his ways when he was granted full physical custody of two
of his children in 2012. In that year he stopped using illegal drugs, i.e., marijuana. In 2013
he ceased drinking alcohol so that he could become a better father. He joined a church
that has become central to his life along with his family. Now he is married at age 41. He
works on improving his character and being a better husband and father. He has been an
active participant in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) for over 8 years and has worked all of the
steps. He has been sober since June 2013. He has a support group as part of NA that is
important  to  him.  His  most  important  supporter  is  his  wife.  He  has  made  a  serious
commitment to himself and his family to provide his children with a better life. His children
have successfully developed into responsible individuals. His oldest is attending college
studying civil engineering, and the younger ones are excelling as well. (Tr. at 48, AE K.)
Applicant provided character letters from  senior managers, supervisors, and co-
workers at his place of employment and from his church pastor and assistant pastor. They
all describe Applicant in glowing terms and remark how he matured and devoted himself
to his wife and family and to his church. His pastor wrote that Applicant has “completely
turn[ed]  his  life  around”  and  has  “grown  emotionally,  mentally  and  spiritually.”  The
church’s assistant pastor commented that Applicant takes “full responsibility for his past”
and now is one of the pastors “must trusted and faithful friends.” At work, he is described
as “dedicated, hardworking, and possess[ing] a can do spirit.” He is praised for his work
ethic, reliability, honesty, integrity, and positive attitude, as well as his professionalism.

",True
"In  her  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations,  except  the
allegations  concerning  her  future  intent  to  use  drugs  (¶¶  1.f  and  1.g).  No  further
information  was  provided  with  her  answer.  Her  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  38  years  old.  She  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  2004.  She  is
employed  as  an  engineering  technician  for  a  defense  contractor.  She  has  worked  for
this employer since 2004 and has held a secret clearance since March 2010. She was
married  in  2005  and  divorced  in  2013.  She has  two  children;  one  is  an  adult,  and  the
other a minor. (Item 3)
In February 2020, a Government investigator conducted a background interview
with Applicant. In response to an interrogatory, she verified the accuracy of the report of
this interview. On the signature block of her interrogatory response,  the year printed is
2020,  which  is  an  administrative  error,  because  her  interrogatory  response  would
predate the interview. The correct year of this response is 2021. (Item 4)
In her background interview, Applicant disclosed to the investigator that she had
used  marijuana  from  2001  to  November  2016.  Between  2010–2016,  she  had  been
using  marijuana  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.  She  reported  that  until
2013, she had used marijuana recreationally on most weekends. After her divorce, she
was using it every day after work and on weekends. This continued until 2016. (Item 3,
4)
In her background interview, Applicant also disclosed that she had used ecstasy,
mushrooms  (psilocybin),  and  cocaine  in  the  last  seven  years.  She  reported  that  she
used mushrooms once in about 2016, because she had never tried it.  She stated that
she  had  used  ecstasy  on  about  twelve  occasions,  from  about  2016  to  2019,  while
attending festivals or concerts. Her most recent use was in December 2019, which was
the month after she submitted her most recent SCA. She stated that she used ecstasy
after a period of abstinence from substance abuse, because she wanted to see what it
would  feel  like  after being  sober for  a  long  time.  She  admitted  in her  answer  that  she
used ecstasy while granted access to classified information. (Item 4)
Applicant admitted to the investigator that she had first tried cocaine in November
2013,  while  at  a  party.  She  continued  to  use  it  about  six  more  times  over  the  next
month. After then, she used cocaine most weekends until her driving while intoxicated
(DWI)  arrest  in  November  2016.  She  last  used  cocaine  in  December  2019.  She
admitted  in  her  answer  that  she  used  cocaine  while  granted  access  to  classified
information. (Item 4)
In her background interview,  Applicant was asked about her intent to use drugs
in  the  future.  She  claimed  that  she  does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  because  it  is
expensive and smelly. She admitted that she would do ecstasy again if it was given to
her, because  it is enjoyable for concerts or festivals.  She stated that  she  will probably
use  ecstasy  about  once  a  year  from  now  on.  She  also  admitted  that  if  cocaine  is
available,  she  will  use  it  a  couple  of  times  a  month.  She  has  friends  that  provide  it  to
her.  She  claimed  that  she  could  abstain  from  drugs  if  it  threatened  her  job,  and  has
been  able  to  abstain  in  the  past  because  she  avoided  her  friends.  She  denied  future
intent to use drugs in her answer. (Item 4)
Applicant  failed  to  report  any  drug  use  or  drug  use  while  possessing  a  security
clearance  on  her  SCA.  When  asked  about  her  omissions  by  an  investigator,  she
claimed  that  she  was  only  thinking  of  her  three  years  of  sobriety,  and  that  she  must
have mismarked the form. She also stated that she did not know why she answered the
question in that way. (Item 3, 4)
In  November 2016, Applicant was  arrested for DWI. When she was  pulled over
by police at about 4 AM,  her blood alcohol content (BAC) was almost double the legal
limit  of  intoxication.  She  was  arrested,  and  pled  guilty  to  fourth  degree  driving  while
impaired.  In  March  2017,  she  was  sentenced  to  two  years  of  probation,  a  45  day
suspended  jail  sentence,  a  fine,  and  attendance  at  state  mandated  DWI  offender
classes. (Item 3, 4, 5)
After  her  DWI  conviction,  Applicant  attended  an  outpatient  substance  abuse
program.  She  reported  on  her  SCA  that  she  attended  from  March  2017  to  October
2017.  She  verified  this  information  in  her  background  interview.  SOR  ¶  2.c  listed  the
year she attended this program as 2016, which appears to be an administrative error. In
this  program,  she  attended  individual  therapy  and  group  therapy  once  a  week.  In  her
answer,  she  admitted  being  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use  disorder,  cannabis  use
disorder, and cocaine use disorder. (Item 3, 4)
Applicant reported that her drinking became a problem after her divorce in 2013.
Until  her  DWI  arrest,  she  was  binge  drinking  on  weekends.  After  attending  the
substance abuse program  in 2017, she was sober for two and a half  years.  In August
2020, she had a drink at a wedding, and decided to start drinking again on weekends.
She claimed that she is not binge drinking anymore, and limits herself to three shots per
weekend night or special occasion. She asserted that she has not abused alcohol since
completing the substance abuse program in 2017. She stated that she intends to keep
drinking because all her friends do it,  and  she  does not want  to be  excluded from  her
friends. She claimed that she will able to drink in moderation. (Item 4)
In  her  FORM response,  Applicant stated  that  she  was  sorry and  ashamed, and
has been grateful for the privilege to hold a clearance for 12 years. She stated that she
regrets  her  offending  behavior  and  understands  the  damage  that  drugs  can  do.  She
asserted  that  she  has  worked  for  her  employer  for  over  17  years,  and  has  been
mentoring and leading her co-workers for ten years. She stated that she has a history of
anxiety  and  depression,  and  had  planned  to  seek  help  to  continue  to  address  her
mental  health  issues,  and  has  been  spiritually  practicing  and  seeking  guidance.
(Response)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  with  clarifications.  I  have
incorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  36  years  old.  He  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  2006  and  a
bachelor’s degree in 2009. He married in 2010, separated in 2012, and divorced in 2014.
He has an 11-year-old child. He has been employed by his current employer, a federal
contactor, since May 2018. (Tr. 14-17, 41-42; GE 1)
In  approximately  July  2014,  Applicant  was  reprimanded  by  his  employer  after
arriving at work hungover and smelling of alcohol (SOR ¶ 1.a). He showed up for work
after drinking the night before. He did not recall exactly how much he had to drink, but he
did not consume alcohol in the morning before work. He stated that he probably drank
between  8  and  10  beers  the  night  before.  His  supervisor  smelled  alcohol  on  him.  His
supervisor  had  him  work  in  the  office  by  himself  and  told  him  his  conduct  was
unacceptable, and not to do it again. He received a written reprimand. He believed his
employer had a three-strike policy. He understood that if he did not comply with the rules,
he would lose his job. Applicant continued to consume alcohol, but thought he drank less.
He  agreed  that  sometimes  his drinking impacted  his ability to  get  to  work on  time.  He
testified that he was unhappy and was using alcohol to cope. He drank every day. Later
his life improved. (Tr. 17-19, 59-64)
In July 2015, Applicant received a second reprimand from his employer as a result
of his excessive tardiness due to his alcohol consumption. He could not recall how many
times he was late for work due to his alcohol consumption, but estimated it was a hand-
full of times when he did not feel well. He said that some of his tardiness was not always
attributed to his alcohol consumption. He testified that no one else at work mentioned his
tardiness, but his supervisor noticed it. He received a second reprimand and forfeited a
bonus  he  likely  would  have  received.  He  testified  that  his  drinking  at  this  time  was
problematic. He understood that he could lose his job. He said after his second reprimand,
he made people at work aware if he was going to be late and he modified his drinking
(SOR ¶ 1.b). (Tr. 18-20, 64-70)
In October 2016, Applicant’s employer sent him on a temporary duty assignment
for five months in a foreign country. He would go out to dinner with his fellow employees.
A couple of times a week, they would have alcoholic drinks at the hotel bar or infrequently
they would go to a different bar. Applicant testified he would have two to three drinks. He
testified  that  on  one  particular  weeknight  he  had  an  incident  after having  more  than a
couple of drinks. He became intoxicated, met a woman from a foreign country, and they
drank alcohol together. Later that night they had sex, and the next day he went to work
late and smelled of alcohol. He said he was a few minutes late for work.  He could not
recall the woman’s name. He knew she had an accent. He held a security clearance at
the  time.  He  said  he  just  did  not  think  of  this  incident  as  a  foreign  contact  until  it  was
brought to his attention during his background interview. He did not report the contact as
required. He explained he just did not think anything of it and even if he had been sober
he would not have reported it. (Tr. 19, 70-80)
Applicant said that at the time, none of  his fellow employees  mentioned  that he
smelled like alcohol or that he had sex with the foreign woman. When he returned to the
United  States,  a  fellow  employee  who  was  with  him  on  the  trip,  reported  Applicant’s
conduct to a supervisor. He was told by the supervisor that even though this was his third
strike, he was being given one last chance, but the next time there was an issue, he would
be terminated. He was suspended from work-related travel due to this incident. Applicant
said he modified his behavior by consuming less alcohol. (Tr. 63, 77-82)
In  May  2017,  Applicant  testified  that  he  had  gone  to  a  bar  around  7  p.m.  and
consumed between 8-10 drinks that included beer, mixed drinks, and shots. He left the
bar between 12:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. and felt fine to drive. He offered his friends a ride.
In his statement to a government investigator in June 2019, he said he felt “buzzed” but
not  intoxicated.  He  admitted  the  way  he  felt  would  produce  lower  reaction  time  and
impaired judgment. He was driving about 45 mph and hit the car in front of him. He pulled
his car to the side of the road. Someone called the police. The car he hit had a driver and
passenger. When  the  police  arrived,  he  was  asked  if  he  had  been  drinking,  which  he
admitted. His breathalyzer reading was .195%. He was arrested and charged with DUI
resulting in personal injury. He stated that after impact the other driver got out of the car
and was angry, and they had words. He said he thought the passenger in the other car
was injured, but he did not recall, and he vaguely remembered dealing with his insurance
company and an injury was mentioned. He had two passengers in his car, both had been
drinking with him. Neither were injured. (Tr. 20-22, 82-94)
Applicant  pleaded  no  contest  to  the  charge  and  was  found  guilty  of  DUI  with
property damage and sentenced to 12 months of supervised probation, assessed fines
and court costs totaling approximately $1,650, and he was required to complete alcohol
treatment. He testified he also had to complete 50 hours of community service and his
license was suspended for six months (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d). (GE 1-2)
Applicant could not recall if he reported the DUI to his Facility Security Officer at
the time, but the FSO was made aware. He said he told his supervisor. The car crash
happened during the workweek and he was detained for 36 hours, so his girlfriend called
Applicant’s  supervisor  to  tell  him  why  he  was  not  at  work.  He  was  subsequently
terminated  from  his employment  in  June  2017,  as  a  result  of  his repeated  issues  with
alcohol. He testified that he then modified his drinking. (Tr. 22, 91-95)
Applicant completed the court-ordered alcohol treatment program in May 2018 as
part of his DUI sentence. Through this treatment program he was diagnosed by a licensed
clinical social worker/substance abuse professional/ diplomat in clinical social work (SW),
with Alcohol Dependency, sustained remission. The SW noted that Applicant was actively
engaged in the program, but “a little non accepting of a problem with alcohol.” (GE 3) He
also noted  that tolerance  plays “a pretty  significant part  in his lifestyle”  and he exhibits
“the defense mechanism of minimization more often than I feel comfortable.” (GE 3) His
prognosis  was  good  if  he  was  involved  in  a  support  program,  such  as  Alcoholics
Anonymous or a  church-based program, or other program. Without a support  program
his prognosis was fair. As part of the program he completed 22 group counseling sessions
and 3 individual sessions. The SW advised Applicant that if he wished to follow up with
group treatment he could do so free of charge. (Tr. 21-22, 95-97; GE 3)
Applicant testified that as part of his counseling he and the counselor discussed
family issues and genetic predisposition. He testified that he has known for a long time
that his mother had a DUI, and she has always consumed alcohol, and it is part of their
relationship. During his 2019 interview with a government investigator, he disclosed that
his mother is an alcoholic and has consumed alcohol his whole life. She has participated
in inpatient rehabilitation treatment. He said her alcohol use is now under control and is
not an issue. His half-brother, who is now deceased and was in and out of prison, was an
alcoholic.  He  testified  that  he  did  not  feel  comfortable  going  to  AA  or  a  church-based
support system. He says his girlfriend, his 11-year-old son, his mother and a family friend
are his support group. He said his girlfriend does not drink much. His mother encouraged
him to slow down his drinking. She lives in a different state. He did not know why he did
not take advantage of continuing counseling with the SW, which is free. Applicant testified
that  while  on  probation  he  did  not  consume  alcohol.  When  he  was  released  from
probation, he celebrated by drinking alcohol. (Tr. 23-24, 96-104, 107-108, 118-119; GE
3)
During  Applicant’s  2019  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  he  explained
that his alcohol consumption started to slowing increase beginning in 2010 when he drank
about  once  a  week  to  almost  daily  in  2017  when  he  was  arrested for  DUI.  At first,  he
would typically have at least a six-pack of beer, that then increased to 9-10 beers daily
until his DUI. (Tr. 44-45; GE 2)
Applicant testified that he has modified his drinking by not drinking every day, but
he drinks a couple of times a week and has between 8 and 12 beers at a time, when his
son is not present. He said he does not do this every week. He said in the past two weeks
he  only  had  two  beers.  He  explained  that  this  is  how  he  modified  his  drinking.  He
previously was drinking daily. He said 8 to 10 drinks will make him intoxicated. He only
drinks at home now, does not go to bars, and is not endangering anyone. He believed he
was alcohol dependent, but he would like to believe he is no longer. He no longer feels
physically  or  mentally  dependent  on  alcohol.  He  said  his  use  was  a  product  of  his
environment, which has changed. He stated that he no longer drinks and drives. Prior to
his DUI arrest, he drove about once a month after he had consumed alcohol. He said the
DUI was an eye-opener. He continues to drink alcohol when he has custody of his son,
but said he does not become intoxicated. (Tr. 25-26, 32-33, 103-107, 113-115, 119-122)
Applicant testified that he and his ex-wife share custody of their child. He would
have physical custody three to four days a week and then he and his ex-wife would switch
the  days  the  following  week.  He  could  not  recall  if  while  they  were  together  if  she
commented  on  his  drinking.  He  admitted  he  would  consume  alcohol  when  he  had  his
child in his physical custody. His ex-wife addressed his drinking with him after his DUI
arrest and told him he had a problem. He does not know if she was aware he consumed
alcohol when he had custody of their son. He admitted being intoxicated when he had
physical custody of his son, but could not estimate or recall how many times. He estimated
about 75% of the time when he had physical custody of his child he was drinking alcohol,
until 2017, when he had his DUI. He testified that he did not drink and drive with his son
in the car. (Tr. 46-51)
Applicant was living with his girlfriend from about 2011 to 2018. His girlfriend and
he would consume alcohol together. His girlfriend also had a small child living with them.
There  was  a three to four-year age  difference  between the children.  Applicant and his
girlfriend would share a 12-pack of beer, each consuming 6, while they had the children.
He said their consumption was over a five-hour period. At some point his girlfriend voiced
concern about their drinking habits. Applicant agreed with her that they were consuming
too much alcohol. They would abstain for about a month, then resume when one of them
showed up with alcohol. He estimated they abstained about four or five times. They would
have alcohol-related arguments. At one point, she wanted him to quit, and he did not want
to at the time. Their relationship ended after an alcohol-related argument. (Tr. 44, 51-58)
Applicant testified that his best friend MC talked to him about his drinking and his
need to quit. They would talk several times a year after Applicant had consumed alcohol
and described MC as a shoulder to cry on. MC finally gave him an ultimatum that they
could no longer be friends if he continued to consume alcohol. They are no longer friends.
Applicant admits alcohol has had a negative impact on his life, due to job loss, loss of a
friendship, and loss of a relationship. He testified, despite the negative impact alcohol has
had  on  his  life,  he  does  not  know  why  he  has  not  chosen  to  abstain  from  alcohol
consumption. He feels he is in a better place now that he is not reliant on others and he
is independent. (Tr. 103-105, 109-110)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  alcohol  counseling  since  his  court-ordered
treatment  ended  in  May  2018.  In  his  March  2021  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  he
intended  to  modify  his  relationship  with  alcohol  and  attend  counseling  to  manage  his
drinking habits. He also provided an exhibit from March 2021 stating that he intended to
modify  his  drinking  and  attend  counseling.  When  questioned  at  his  hearing  if  he  had
attended counseling, he said no. At his hearing, he said he now intends to abstain from
drinking alcohol and post-hearing he provided a letter of intent to abstain from drinking
and attend counseling. (Tr. 31-32, 110, 113-117, 119-120, 123; AE F, G, I)
Applicant testified that he has learned from his past mistakes and that consuming
alcohol is not worth it as it has hurt himself and others, and jeopardized his career. He
said the impact alcohol has had on him is now very real because he may lose his job. He
does not keep alcohol in the house, but will go to the gas station to purchase it. He testified
that his work is phenomenal, he is one of the best workers on a current project, and he is
really good at what he does. (Tr. 32-33, 38-40, 68-69)
Applicant  provided  his  resume,  education  transcripts,  photos,  and  character
letters.  In  them,  he  is  described  as  hard-working,  valued,  committed,  diligent,
conscientious, trusted, kind, considerate, trustworthy, dedicated and a man of character
and integrity. (Tr. 26-31; AE A, B, C, D, E, H)

"In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the SOR allegations  in ¶¶  1.a -1.d,  and
2.a  - 2.b.  He  denied  the  SOR allegations  in paragraphs  3.a  and  3.b  (Response  to  SOR).
At hearing, he  admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.e  and  2.b  as amended.  His admissions  are accepted
as findings of  fact.
Applicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from
high school and has some college credit, but no degree. He served on active duty in the
Navy from March 1986 to April 2009. After 23 years, he retired at the rank of E-8, senior
chief  petty  officer,  with  an  honorable  discharge.  While  in  the  Navy,  he  held  security
clearances at the Secret and Top Secret levels. He is divorced and has one adult son.
He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  April  2009  after  his  retirement  from  the
Navy. (Tr. 14-16, 24-25)
Alcohol Consumption
Alcohol concerns were raised  because  Applicant was arrested  and   convicted  of
DUI offenses  on  four occasions between  July  1995  to  September 1,  2018.  (SOR ¶¶  1.a
–  1.d) After the  SOR was issued, Applicant  was arrested  and  charged  with  DUI on  May
15, 2022. (SOR ¶ 1.e) The alcohol-related driving offenses are:
SOR ¶  1.a:  In July 1995, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 1]. He pled guilty
and received a fine. (Tr. 16; Gov 1 at 34; Gov 4 at 9) He does not recall the specifics of
this arrest. He was driving home alone from a bar. The police stopped him. He failed a
breathalyzer test. He was on active duty in the Navy at the time. The Navy was aware of
the arrest. (Tr. 26-28)
SOR ¶  1.b: On October 29, 2000, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 1]. He
pled  guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  three  days  in  jail,  a  $600  fine  and  his  license  was
suspended. (Tr. 17; Gov 1 at 34; Gov 4 at 9) Applicant and his roommate were driving to
get breakfast after drinking at a bar. A police officer stopped him. He took a breathalyzer,
but was not sure of the results. His license was suspended for one year. He reported this
offense to the Navy. (Tr. 28-30)
SOR ¶  1.c:   On April 30, 2011, Applicant was arrested for DWI in [State 2]. He pled
guilty and received a fine. (Tr. 17; Gov 4 at 10) He was staying at a hotel. He drove his
motorcycle back to the hotel after going to a sports bar. He had 3-4 alcoholic drinks at the
sports bar. When he pulled into the hotel parking lot, a police officer approached him and
asked to look at his helmet. The police officer smelled alcohol on Applicant’s breath and
asked if he had been drinking. Applicant took a breathalyzer at the police station. He was
over the legal limit. Applicant testified that he attended 20 hours of counseling. He told
his alcohol counselor that this was his third DUI arrest. He does not recall receiving an
alcohol diagnosis and was never advised to stop drinking alcohol. He reported his alcohol
arrest to his employer after his court conviction. (Tr. 31-35)
SOR ¶  1.d: On September 1, 2018, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 3]. He
pled  guilty  and  received  20  days  in  jail,  suspended;  a  $300  fine;  ordered  to  use  an
interlock device on his car for a period of one year; three years probation; and ordered to
attend alcohol counseling through the county health department. (Tr. 17-18; Gov 2 at 26;
Gov 3 at 26; Gov 4 at 2, 11; Gov 5; Gov 6)
Applicant’s  September  2018  arrest  occurred  on  the  Saturday  of  Labor  Day
weekend. He spent the day on a boat with friends. They would dock the boat at different
restaurants throughout the day to drink mixed alcoholic drinks and eat. Applicant does
not recall the number of alcoholic drinks he consumed during the day. He left the boat
around  6:30  or  7  pm.  He  went  to  a  restaurant  after  getting  off  the  boat.  He  stopped
drinking when he left the restaurant around 9 pm. While driving home, he rear-ended a
car that was turning left at an intersection. The passengers in the other car were not hurt.
Applicant  had  about  $500  damage  to  his  car. When  the  police  arrived  at  the  accident
scene, they smelled alcohol on Applicant’s breath. He failed a failed a field sobriety test.
A breathalyzer at the police station registered 0.16. (Tr. 35-39)
SOR ¶ 1.e: On May 15, 2021, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 3]. He pled
guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  60  days  in  jail,  suspended,  and  a  $250  fine.  He  lost  his
license for a period of one year. (Tr. 19, 53; Gov 7) At the time of his May 2021 arrest,
Applicant was still on probation related to his 2018 conviction for DUI. An officer observed
Applicant’s vehicle swerving over the line and pulled him over. Applicant admits drinking
about three or four alcoholic drinks before  the  arrest over a period of  three hours at a
restaurant. He refused to take a breathalyzer test because he did not want to take it.  He
claims he reported his arrest to his supervisor after he was convicted. (Tr. 40-43)
Appellant testified that he has never been  diagnosed  with  an alcohol disorder. N  o
one  has ever recommended  that he  abstain  from  alcohol.  He  never attended  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA)  meetings.  He  does  not  believe   he   is  an   alcoholic.  He  usually   drinks
alcohol   on   the   weekends.   He  usually   has  three   to   four  drinks  over  a   few   hours  at   a
restaurant.  He does not drink alcohol at home  unless he has company. Before 2009, his
alcohol  consumption  was higher while  he  served  in  the  Navy. Applicant testified  he  drank
alcohol on  average  of  five  to  six  times a  week. He has never tried  to  stop  drinking  alcohol.
He  realizes  that   he   should  stop   or  curtail   his  drinking.  Later,  he   testified   he   does  not
believe  he  needs to  stop  drinking. He just needs to  stop  making  stupid  decisions. (Tr. 48-
52)
Applicant’s  license  has  not  been  reinstated  yet.  It  has  been  over  a  year,  so  he
intends to request a hearing to have his license reinstated. He has not driven after drinking
alcohol since his May 2021, arrest for DUI. When he goes out, his friends drive him or he
takes  an  Uber.  The  last  time  he  went  out  drinking  was  the  Saturday  night  before  the
hearing. He has never reported to work while intoxicated. (Tr. 53- 54)
Criminal Conduct
Applicant’s five  DUI arrests were cross-alleged  under Criminal  Conduct.  (SOR ¶
1.b) A  May  27, 2002  arrest in [State  1] for operating  a  vehicle  with  a  suspended  license
was also alleged. For this offense, Applicant pled  guilty, was fined  $1,000,  and  served  48
hours in jail. Applicant was in the  process of  transferring  to  a  new  duty  location  in [State
3].  He  drove  from  [State  3]  to  [State1].  He  was pulled  over for having  a  tail  light out.  He
said  it was the  first and only time  that he drove on  a suspended license. He reported it to
the  Navy. He claims it did not violate  the  terms of  his probation. He  had  to  fly  back to
[State 3] to serve his 48-hour jail sentence. (SOR ¶ 2.a: Tr. 30-31; Gov 4 at 10)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges that in response to Section 22, on his February 3, 2019, security
clearance application, “Have you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or
drugs?” Applicant answered, “Yes.”  He listed his September 2018 arrest for DUI. He is
alleged  to  have  deliberately  omitted  his  alcohol-related  arrests  in  July  1995,  October
2000, and April 2011, which are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c.
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges that in response to Section 22, on his August 31, 2020, security
clearance application, “Have you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or
drugs?” Applicant answered, “Yes.”  He listed his September 2018 arrest for DUI. He is
alleged  to  have  deliberately  omitted  his  alcohol-related  arrests  in  July  1995,  October
2000, and April 2011, which are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c.
Applicant testified that he misunderstood the question. He believed he was only
required to list alcohol offenses within the last seven years. Applicant listed his November
2000 and July 1995 arrests on his previous security clearance application  in 2009. He
believed  the  question  regarding  alcohol-related  offenses  in  Section  22  did  not  include
alcohol arrests that he previously disclosed. The government was on notice of Applicant’s
1995 and 2000 DUI arrests. (Tr. 20-22. 45-46; Gov 2, Section 22 at 33-34)
Applicant  found  the  e-QIP  security  clearance  applications  in  2019  and  2020
confusing. He never intended to falsify his security clearance applications. He listed his
2018 DUI offense in response to section 22 on both his 2019 and 2020 security clearance
applications.  He  did  not  list  his  2011  DUI  on  either  application.  This  coincides  with
Applicant’s mistaken belief that he did not have to list alcohol offenses that were more
than seven years old on his 2019 and his 2020 security clearance applications. I find SOR
¶¶  3.a  and  3.b  for  Applicant  because  he  did  not  intend  to  deliberately  withhold  these
offenses from the government. He misunderstood the question. (Tr. 21-22)
Character Evidence
Mr. D.A. wrote a letter on Applicant’s behalf. He has known Applicant for over 11
years. He works with Applicant and also socializes with him outside of work. He states
Applicant  cares  about doing  the  job  correctly.  Mr.  D.A.  understands  the  importance  of
national security. He believes Applicant is a valuable asset with knowledge, skill, and a

"In his answer, Applicant  denied SOR ¶ 1.a, and admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 2.a,
and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review
of  the  pleadings,  evidence  submitted,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following  findings  of
fact:
Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  2012,  and  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  2018.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  computer  programmer  by  a
defense contractor since 2020. This is his first application for a security clearance.  (Tr.
10; GE 1)
In  July  2012,  Applicant  was  driving  his  mother  to  an  appointment,  and  lost
control of his vehicle. He stated that he had a seizure and lost muscle control because
of a medication that he was taking at the time. The police suspected that he was driving
under the influence, and arrested him. His blood was tested right after the accident for
intoxicants, and the toxicology report showed that none were found. The case was nolle
prosequi by the local county prosecutor’s office. (Tr. 43-45, 66-73; GE 3; AE F)
In February 2019, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He stated that he went into a
metropolitan  area  about  an  hour  away  to  meet  friends  at  a  hotel for  drinks.  He  stated
that  his  understanding  was  that  he  and  his  friends  would  all  be  staying  in  the  hotel
together.  At  the  end  of  the  evening,  his  friend  who  rented  the  hotel  room,  kicked
everyone else out so that he could be alone in the room  with his girlfriend.  His friends
left the area at that time. He claimed that since he was newly out of college, he did not
have funds  to get  another hotel room  in  the area,  and was  not  able  to afford  a  taxi  to
drive him home. He was stopped for speeding two blocks from home, and was arrested
for  DUI.  His  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  was  .10,  which  is  above  the  legal  limit.  He
pleaded  guilty,  and  received  a  suspended  90-day  sentence,  a  restricted  license,  an
ignition lock on his car for 6 months, a monetary fine, and state mandated DUI classes.
He stated that he regretted and learned from the incident, that he has better judgment
now, and associates with more reliable friends. (Tr. 45-48,58-66; GE 1, 2, 4)
In November 2019, Applicant was arrested for public intoxication. He stated that
he had about three drinks of alcohol one evening. He stated that later in the evening, he
was  working on a car that he was restoring, and wanted to circulate the engine fluids.
He drove the car around his apartment building, the car became unresponsive, and he
had to swerve into some bushes. After walking back home to call a tow truck, the police
arrived at the place he left his car. He was asked by police if he had been drinking that
evening,  and admitted he  had earlier.  He  was  arrested for public intoxication,  but  was
never given a breathalyzer test. The charge was converted to improper control/driving,
and  he  plead  guilty,  and  was  fined.  He  stated  that  he  regretted  the  incident  and
recognizes that his actions that evening were a mistake. (Tr. 45-48, 58-66; GE 1, 2, 5)
When Applicant was 17  years old, he was a habitual marijuana user. He stated
that  in  2009,  marijuana  became  unavailable  for  a  period  in  the  area  that  he  lived.
Someone  he  knew  offered  to  sell  him  marijuana.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  trust  this
person,  and  he  had  been  known  to  rob  people.  He  reported  that  when  he  met  this
person to purchase marijuana, he took a knife for protection. They met in the parking lot
of local shopping center. He stated that he could tell that the drug seller was high when
he  got  into  Applicant’s  car.  He  stated  the  seller  took  $250  from  him,  but  had  no
marijuana to sell. He claimed that he demanded his money back, but the seller did not
comply, and when he understood that the seller was not going to give his money back,
he  threatened  him  with  his  knife.  He  stated  the  confrontation  continued  out  of  the
vehicle,  and  he  cut  the  seller  twice,  and  left.  He  asserted  that  he  used  the  knife  to
defend himself. He was eventually arrested by police and charged with felony malicious
wounding.  He  served  three  years in  juvenile prison,  and had  three years of  probation.
He  stated  that  he  matured  a  lot  while  serving  his  sentence,  and  understands  that  he
used  very  poor  judgement  in  that  circumstance.  He  asserted  that  his  drug  habit  and
youth were contributing factors to the incident. (Tr. 48-51, 73-83; GE 1, 2)
While  serving his  sentence,  Applicant  completed his GED,  and  was  selected  to
take  some  college  level  courses.  He  also  was  chosen  to  participate  in  a  work-release
program,  where  he  worked  three  different  jobs  during  the  week,  and  returned  to  the
detention  facility  at  night.  After  he  was  released,  he  started  attending  community
college. He had a high GPA at community college, and once he received his associate’s
degree,  he  was  able  to  transfer  into  a  regular  four-year  university.  He  earned  his
bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  science  in 2018. He asserted  that he  has  learned from
his mistakes, and now only associates with mature people who are role models for him.
Applicant  stated  that  he  has  learned  from  his  two  alcohol-related  arrests  in  2019,  and
has modified his alcohol consumption. He has a close relationship with family members
who  act as his support system.  He stated that he is committed to serving in  a  positon
that  serves  the  interests  of  national  defense,  and  is  willing  and  able  to  meet  the  high
standards required of a person entrusted with national security information.  (Tr. 46-47,
89-98)
His  character witnesses,  who  have  known  him  about  seven  years,  testified  that
they  have  never  seen  any  signs  that  he  abuses  alcohol,  and  have  seen  him  drink
appropriately in social situations. They are aware of his criminal history in his youth, and
assert that he is a loyal and trustworthy person. (Tr. 17-40)

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  except  ¶  2.d,  which  he  denied.
Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2005. He does not
have  children.  He  earned  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2017.  He  began  work  for  a  federal
contractor in April 2019. He worked at various jobs from 2013 to 2019, including working
in food service, at liquor stores, retail stores and computer repair. He had long sketches
of unemployment with periods of short, contract jobs from 2009 to 2013. (Item 3)
Applicant  received  treatment,  with  varying  frequency,  at  a  health  and  human
services center, from about June 2006 to about June 2009, for Bipolar Mood Disorder.
His  treatment  consisted  mostly  of  obtaining  free  samples  of  medication.  His  mental
health  and  substance  abuse  history  shows  he  received  outpatient  psychological
treatment and tried a myriad of medications. (Items 2, 3, 5)
In  September  2020,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  duly  qualified  licensed
psychologist  (LP)  approved  by  the  Government.  Based  on  an  interview,  a  review  of
available records, and an analysis of his current psychological results, the LP diagnosed
Applicant  with  Bipolar  II  Disorder,  in  remission,  and  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,  severe,
currently in remission. He advised the LP that he was not currently abusing alcohol, but
still  consumed  beer  despite  the  severe  difficulties  it  had  caused  him  in  the  past.  His
consumption would increase during football season. He told the LP that in 2008 he had
stopped drinking heavily when he moved back into his parents’ house, but admitted that
he continued to consume alcohol and hid his drinking from his parents while living there.
Applicant  did  not  desire  to  undergo  formal  treatment  for  his  psychological  disorders.
(Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
The  LP  found  that  Applicant’s  psychiatric  conditions  and  lack  of  ongoing
treatment  could  ultimately  lead  to  compromised  reliability,  judgment,  stability,  and
trustworthiness. She concluded Applicant’s prognosis is guarded. (Item 5)
Applicant  consumed alcohol,  at  times  in excess  and  to  the  point of  intoxication,
from  about  1994  to  at  least  September  2020.  He  continued  to  consume  alcohol,  but
decreased his drinking in 2008. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the psychological
condition  allegations and  stated:  “I have  stopped  drinking  completely  as  the  pandemic
progressed  and  am  open  to  formal  treatment.”  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  alcohol-
related incidents since 2005 or that he has consumed alcohol since 2020. (Items 2, 3, 4)
Applicant was arrested in about 2005 and charged with operating a vehicle while
intoxicated,  first  offense.  In  his  June  2019  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  he
disclosed  that  the  final  disposition  ordered  by  the  court  was:  “Alcohol  and  Other  Drug
Abuse  (AODA)  assessment  after  an  Operating While  Intoxication  offense.  Referred  to
group dynamics for driver safety. Completed March of 2019, 14 years after the offense.”
He provided no explanation for his delay. (Items 2, 3, 5)

arrested  in  1999  for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia.  He  was  found  guilty,  and  was
given  a  six-month  suspended  jail  sentence,  and  had  his  license  suspended.  He  was
arrested  in  March  2001  for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  and  possession  of
marijuana. He was found guilty. He was arrested in about July 2005 for possession of

Applicant  was  arrested   twice  in  2006   (May   and   August)   for  operating   a   vehicle
while   his  license   was  revoked   (3rd   offense).  He  was  found   guilty   both   times  and
sentenced to one day in jail. (Items 2, 8, 9)
Applicant was arrested in March 2007 for possession of drug paraphernalia and
possession of marijuana. He was found guilty and given a four-month jail sentences that
was suspended, a six-month suspended license, and one year of probation with no use
of drugs or alcohol, and to attend substance abuse treatment. (Items 2, 7)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2012  for  obstruction  of  justice,  or  congress,  or
legislative, or commission. He stated in his SOR answer that he was obstructing a street
that was closed by police barricades during a permitted protest. In June 2013, Applicant
was  arrested  for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  and  possession  of  marijuana.  He
was found guilty and sentenced to five days in jail and a $400 fine. (Items 2, 6, 12)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in July 2019. During his
interview,  he  acknowledged  his  past  drug  use.  He  indicated  his  likelihood  of  being
involved in illegal drugs in the future was very low. He said he had switched to craft beer
and  was  learning  how  to  lead  a  more  responsible  life  without  indulging  in  the  use  of
marijuana.  He  had  moved  to  a  new  city  and  no  longer  socialized  with  the  people  he

Alcohol Consumption
Applicant’s five allegations under this concern are established by his September
28, 2021 SF-86; his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigation
conducted  from  December  2,  2019,  to  December  20,  2019,  containing  his  December
13,  2019  OPM  Personal  Subject  Interview  (PSI);  his  October  1,  2019  FBI  Criminal
Background  record;  his  February  19,  2020  local  county  sheriff’s  criminal  record;  his
local  hospital  medical  records  for  alcohol  treatment  printed  on  January  10,  2020;  and
his February 1, 2021 SOR Answer. (Items 1 – 6)
The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  five  allegations  against  Applicant  under  the
alcohol consumption concern and his response to those allegations.
SOR ¶ 1.a – Alleged that Applicant consumed alcohol, at times in excess to the
point  of  intoxication,  from  approximately  2005  to  at  least  2006  and  from  2011  until  at
least December 2019. Applicant admitted this allegation. He explained that, “Beginning
in 2006 I abstained from alcohol consumption [u]ntil approximately 2011. To the best of
my recollection, I also did not have a  problem with alcohol until I began suffering from
depression in late 2017.” (Item 1)
SOR  ¶  1.b  –  Alleged  that  Applicant  received  treatment  at  a  local  hospital,  on
multiple occasions in 2018 and 2019 for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Dependence
and  Alcohol  Use  Disorder  (Severe).  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation.  He  explained
that,  “I was diagnosed  with  depression  while  at (the  local hospital)  in 2018. It  took me
several visits to get a handle on my problem which I believe I am now free of.” (Item 1)
SOR  ¶  1.c  –  Alleged
to  consume  alcohol,
notwithstanding  his  diagnosed  condition.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation.  He
explained that, “I admit. I occasionally have a beer when at Caution-home [sic].”
that  Applicant  continues
SOR ¶ 1.d –  Alleged that Applicant was arrested in about July 2019 in  his state
of residence and charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence of alcohol and
/or misdemeanor driving under the influence of alcohol with .08 percent or higher blood
alcohol  level.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation.  He  explained  that,  “Following  my
conviction  of  Misdemeanor  Driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol,  I  completed  the  9
month  DUI  program  which  consisted  of  40  hours  of  community  service  at  Habitat  for
Humanity,  30  AA  meetings,  30  individual  counseling  sessions,  and  weekly  group
counseling meetings from February 2020 to December 2020. I completed this program
in December 2020. All of this DUI program occurred after my background investigation
which took place in December 2019.” (Item 1)
SOR  ¶ 1.e  –  Alleged  that Applicant  was  terminated from  his employment at his
Government  contractor  employer  in  about  July  2019  for  going  to  work  intoxicated.
Applicant admitted this allegation. He did not add anything beyond his admission to this
allegation in his SOR Answer.
Personal Conduct
Applicant’s two allegations under this concern are established by his September
28, 2021 SF-86; his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigation
conducted  from  December  2,  2019,  to  December  20,  2019,  containing  his  December
13,  2019  OPM  Personal  Subject  Interview  (PSI);  and  his  February  1,  2021  SOR
Answer. (Items 1 – 3)
The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  two  allegations  against  Applicant  under  the
personal conduct concern and his response to those allegations.
SOR ¶  2.a  –  Alleged  that Applicant falsified  material facts  on  his  September  28,
2019 SF-86 when queried whether in the last seven years he had ever been  fired  from a
job;   quit  after  being   told  he   would  be   fired;   left  a   job   by   mutual  agreement  following
charges  or  allegations   of  misconduct;   left   a   job   by   mutual  agreement  after   notice   of
unsatisfactory  performance;  received  a  written  warning; or  been  officially  reprimanded,
suspended,  or  disciplined   for  misconduct  in   the   workplace,  such   as  a   violation   of
security   policy,  to   which  he   answered,   “No.”  Applicant  admitted   this  allegation.  He
explained   that,   “I   erred   in   answering   this  question   and   I   now   acknowledge   that   I  was
terminated  from  [Government contractor employer] for coming  to  work intoxicated.  I had
been  up  late  the  night before  celebrating  my  71st  birthday  and  should not have  gone  to
work at 6  am,  my  usual start  of my  shift.  I  found  it  hard  to  believe  at  the  time  that I could
have  had  a  measurable  quantity  in my  system.  I now  acknowledge  that   I was wrong  in
answering  ‘No’  (to) this question.” (Item 1)
SOR ¶  2.b  –  Alleged  that Applicant falsified  material facts  on  his   September  28,
2019   SF-86   when   queried   whether  in   the   last  seven   years  his   use   of  alcohol   had   a
negative  impact on  his  work performance, his professional or personal relationships,  his
finances,  or  resulted   in  intervention   by   law  enforcement/public  safety   personnel,  to
which  he   answered   “No.”  Applicant  admitted   this  allegation.  He  explained,  “Same   as
1.a. above.”
Although  not  alleged,  it  is  noteworthy  that  in  addition  to  the  two  Guideline  E
allegations  discussed,  infra,  Applicant  also  told  two  different  versions  about  his
termination  from  his  Government  contractor  employer  in  July  2019.  While  he  told  the
OPM investigator that he  showed  up for  work with  alcohol in  his system from drinking
the  night  before,  he  told  his  doctor  that  he  had  been  terminated  from  his  job  after
returning from lunch with alcohol on his breath. (Item 6)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He
admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 2.a, and 3.a in part and denied them in
part.  He  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 58-year-old aeronautical engineer employed by a defense contractor
since August 2004. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from May 1984 to October
2004,  retired  as  a  chief  petty  officer  (pay  grade  E-7),  and  received  an  honorable
discharge. He started working for his current employer while on terminal leave from the
Navy.  (Tr.  32.)  While  on  active  duty,  he  was  awarded  the  Navy  and  Marine  Corps
Commendation Medal twice, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal six times,
the Navy Good Conduct Medal five times, and various service awards. (AX E.) He held a
security clearance in the Navy and retained it as an employee of a defense contractor.
Applicant married in February 1988  and divorced in April 2012. He remarried in
July 2019. He has two adult children.
Applicant earned an associate’s degree from an online university in July 2005. (AX
D.)  He  attended  a  university  from  October  2007  to  March  2012  but  did  not  receive  a
degree. (GX 1 at 12.)
Applicant began consuming alcohol in high school. In March 1986, while he was
on  active  duty  in  the  Navy,  he  was  convicted  of  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI)  and
sentenced to probation for two years. (GX 1 at 30-31.) He was required to complete a six-
week  alcohol rehabilitation program. He  did not resume  consuming alcohol until 1993.
(Tr. 27-28.)
Applicant  testified that when  he  returned from a deployment to Iraq in  2003, he
was depressed and distant. He turned to alcohol in an unsuccessful attempt to escape
from his depression. He started seeing a counselor in 2005, because he was struggling
with his feelings about his role in the taking of lives. After a shore duty assignment, he
volunteered  to  deploy  again  with  his  old  unit. When  he  returned,  he  talked  to  his  wife
about his depression, and her response was, “Don’t expect me to feel sorry for you; you
volunteered for this.” (Tr. 30-31.) Between 2005 and 2010, he sometimes drank to excess,
and he believed he was an alcoholic. (Tr. 33.)
In May 2011, Applicant’s wife left him. He thought about suicide. When he told his
primary physician about his suicidal thoughts, his physician told him he needed treatment.
He completed a four-day inpatient program that he did not find helpful. His wife moved
back into the home for a few days and then left again. In June 2011, he overdosed on a
prescription  sleep  medication  combined  with  alcohol.  His  wife  found  him  unconscious
when she came to the house on the following morning, and she took him to a hospital.
Applicant  was  voluntarily  admitted  to  a  psychiatric  hospital  in  July  2011  for
psychiatric  stabilization.  He  was  discharged  a  week  later  and  diagnosed  with  a  major
depressive disorder, recurrent, and alcohol abuse. He was prescribed a drug to reduce
his craving for alcohol and a drug for his depression. His prognosis was “fair if compliant
with the medicine.” (GX 3 at 11.)
During 2011 and 2012, Applicant was drinking  one or two drinks in the evening
every day. His consumption on weekends was heavier. At the same time, he was taking
medications for depression, even though he was advised to not consume alcohol while
taking the antidepressants. (Tr. 35.) His depression and alcohol abuse worsened after his
divorce. (Tr. 21-22.) He saw a psychologist regularly until July 2012, when he moved to
another location. (Tr. 37-38.)
Applicant’s alcohol consumption increased to five or six drinks at day. (Tr. 41.) In
October  2015,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DWI.  (GX  1  at  28.)  He  reported  his
arrest  to  his employer, as  required.  (GX  2  at  6.)  His  case  was  referred  to  a  Veteran’s
Court, where he pleaded guilty. He was required to compete a nine-month program that
began in September 2016 and involved wearing an ankle monitor for alcohol, mentoring,
counseling, random urinalysis, and victim impact panels. He was required to attend the
program  for  three  additional  months  because  he  consumed  alcohol  once  during  the
program.  He  completed  the  program  in  May  2017.  (AX  J.)  After  he  completed  the
program, the charges against him were dismissed, and record of his arrest and conviction
was expunged. (GX 1 at 26 and 28; AX K; AX L; AX M.)
In  early  2017,  Applicant  went  to  his  employee  assistance  program  (EAP)  and
asked  for  help.  He  was  enrolled  in  an  inpatient  program  for  five  or  six  weeks  and
completed it in April 2017. (AX L.) In late 2017, he resumed his alcohol consumption. (Tr.
31.)
On  February  14,  2018,  Applicant  was  self-admitted  to  a  psychiatric  hospital  for
outpatient  treatment  after  he  developed  suicidal  ideation  while  intoxicated.  He  was
diagnosed with  a major depressive  disorder.  After two  days,  he was  discharged at his
request, because the treatment was not covered by his insurance. (GX 5; Tr. 52.)
On February 19, 2018, which would have been Applicant’s 30th  anniversary with
his ex-wife, he began feeling severely depressed. He told his son how he was feeling,
and his son took him to a hospital for outpatient treatment. He was discharged on March
9, 2018, at his request so that he could return to work. (GX 6.) He was advised to seek a
mental health professional and to stop consuming alcohol. (Tr. 55.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in August 2018, he told
the investigator that he and the woman who became his second wife both enjoyed going
to draft breweries on weekends, and he usually consumed about two beers at one of the
breweries. (GX 2 at 5; Tr. 56.) As they approached the date of their marriage, Applicant
increased his alcohol consumption due to the stress of merging households.
In  July  2019,  the  CAF  requested  that  Applicant  undergo  a  mental  health
evaluation.  He  was  evaluated  in  November  2019  by  a  licensed  psychologist.  He  was
diagnosed  with  a  major  depressive  disorder,  in  partial  remission,  and  an  alcohol  use
disorder,  moderate.  The  psychologist’s  diagnostic  impressions  included  the  following
comments:
Clinical interview, psychological testing, and  medical records converge  to
suggest  [Applicant]   experienced   intermittent  depressive   symptoms  for
approximately  17  years. At times, since  2011, these  symptoms have  been
coupled   with   suicidal  ideation   after  his  ex-wife   moved   out  of  their   home.
More severe depressive symptoms  apparently  tended  to  occur annually  in
February, the  date  of  his previous anniversary  with  his ex-wife. However,
he  denies experiencing  any  significant symptoms of  anxiety  or depression
at  the   present  time.   His  psychological  testing   does   not  indicate   any
significant  distress.   His  mental  health   symptoms  appear  to   be   managed
presently  with  [a  prescription  drug], and  he  has apparently  gained  insight
and   coping   skills  through   therapy.  Any   depressive   symptoms  he   may   be
experiencing   presently   do   not   appear  to   be   significantly   impacting   his
occupational or social functioning.
The psychologist stated, however, that Applicant’s decision to consume beer gave
her pause, “given his history of alcohol abuse in conjunction with his previous treatment
provider’s recommendation of abstinence.” (GX 7 at 6.)  She concluded that Applicant’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are impaired, “as evidenced by his decision to
continue   to   consume   alcohol  on   a   weekly   basis,  despite   historically   experiencing
significant  consequences  as  a   result  of  his  alcohol  use,  and   in   contradiction   to   his
treatment  provider’s  recommendations.”  The   psychologist’s  prognosis  was  “fair.”  She
commented  that if  Applicant “could provide  information  from  a  mental health  practitioner
familiar with  his history of alcohol  use  disorder and  related  treatment  which indicates  his
alcohol  consumption   falls  within  their   recommended   levels,  this   could  improve   his
prognosis as well. . . .” (GX 7 at  6.)
On December 7, 2020, Applicant was evaluated by a another medical professional
who is a licensed clinical social worker, certified substance abuse counselor, and licensed
substance abuse professional. Her evaluation states:
The   results  of   standardized   testing   revealed   the   client   to   have   a   low
probability  of  an  alcohol use  disorder. The  client has no  problematic use,
nor is there  a  pattern to  the  use. There  are  no  clinical  effects,  and  there is
no  interference  in  the  patient’s life.  The  client has  ceased  all  consumption
of alcohol.
This evaluator determined that Applicant has no alcohol use disorder and that no
treatment is warranted. (AX R.) Although Department Counsel objected to consideration
of her evaluation on the ground that she was not qualified to make it, I am satisfied that
her credentials are sufficient to warrant consideration of her evaluation, although she may
have  exceeded  the  limits  of  her  qualifications  by  expressing  opinions  about  the
applicability of the adjudicative guidelines.
In  late  December  2020,  Applicant  completed  an  online  four-hour  behavior
modification course and an online four-hour drug and alcohol awareness course. (AX P;
AX Q.) In June 2022, he took a PETH test to determine the presence of alcohol in his
blood, and it was negative. (AX R.)
Applicant suffered a stroke on February 12, 2022, which he believes was due in
part  to  his  alcohol  abuse,  failure  to  control  his  diabetes,  and  hypertension.  Since  his
stroke,  he  has  changed  his  dietary  and  exercise  habits,  takes  his  medicines  as
prescribed, and has not consumed alcohol. (Tr. 21-24.) He testified that his primary care
physician  since  the  summer  of  2013  had  warned  him  that  he  had  two  choices:  “stop
drinking and live or keep drinking and die.” When Applicant saw his primary care physician
after the stroke, she told him, “I told you so, and I’m only going to say that once.” (Tr. 59.
At the hearing, Applicant testified that his last drink was on February 11, 2022, the
night before his stroke. He did not describe the circumstances of his alcohol consumption
on that date. (Tr. 66.) His vision and hearing were still impaired by the consequences of
the stoke.
Applicant has started seeing a new counselor. He has changed his diet, started
exercising, and consistently takes his medications. He tried Alcoholics Anonymous in the
past and found that it did not help him. To the contrary, he left the AA meetings wanting
to drink more than when he walked into the meeting. (Tr. 71.) He has two close friends,
one  of  whom  is  a  recovering  alcoholic  and  the  other  recovering  from  addiction  to
methamphetamine,  who  have  helped  him.  (Tr.  67-68.)  Applicant’s  wife  continues  to
consume alcohol, and they keep it in their home, but he testified that he is not tempted
by it. He testified that the thought of how close he came to death during his stroke is with
him every day. He believes that every alcoholic has “a bottom,” and he hit bottom when
he had a stroke. (Tr. 71-72.).
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he submitted a sworn statement declaring his
intent to not use alcohol in the future. He agreed that any future involvement in alcohol
use may be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (AX O.)
Applicant’s immediate supervisor submitted a letter supporting reinstatement of his
security clearance. His supervisor has worked with him for 15 years and is familiar with
his struggles with  depression  and  alcohol abuse.  He states that  Applicant  “has  earned
the respect of his work community, especially the pilot community, due to his honesty,
accountability, and integrity.” Applicant is regularly requested by name for tasks requiring
a  high  degree  of  trust.  The  supervisor  states,  “He  does  not  accept  failure  lightly,  and
works very hard to overcome failures at work and in his personal life.” (AX F at 1-2.)
Applicant’s  team  members  share  his  supervisor’s  high  regard  for  his  technical
skills, integrity, and honesty. (AX F at 3-31.) He has received numerous awards for his
achievements and technical skills. (AX G; AX H.)
Applicant’s performance evaluation for 2017 rated him as exceeding expectations
for technical execution and integrity and achieving expectations in all other performance
categories.  (AX  I  at  1-7.)  His  2018  performance  evaluation  rated  him  as  exceeding
expectations in all categories. (AX I at 8-14.) His performance evaluation for 2019 rated
him  as  exceeding expectations  in  performance  and achieving expectations  in  all other
categories. (AX I at 15-20.)

"The SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR ¶ 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline
J (SOR ¶ 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR ¶ 4.b) that Applicant was convicted of driving under
the  influence  (DUI)  or  operating  under  the  influence  (OUI)  offenses  committed  in  July
2013  (SOR ¶ 1.b), April 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.c), and August 2015  (SOR ¶ 1.d). Also under
Guideline G, Applicant allegedly consumed alcohol at times to excess and to intoxication
since about 2013 to at least December 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a); was separated from the Army
National Guard Reserve (ARNG) because of his alcohol-related offenses; and received
treatment from November 2015 to January 2016 for diagnosed addictive disorder-alcohol
abuse and attention deficit disorder (SOR ¶ 1.f) and from February 2016 to April 2016 for
substance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (SOR ¶ 1.g).
The   SOR  alleges  under  Guideline   H  (SOR  ¶   3.a),  and   cross-alleges  under
Guideline  J  (SOR ¶  2.b), that  Applicant  used  cocaine  with  varying  frequency  from  about
September  2013   to   at  least  September  2015   while   granted   access  to   classified
information  (SOR ¶  3.b).  His use  of cocaine  while  granted  access  to  classified  information
was also cross-alleged  under  Guideline  E  (SOR ¶  4.a).  Also  under Guideline  E,  Applicant
allegedly   falsified   his  June   30,  2018   Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing   (hereafter  SF  86)  by   responding   negatively   to   inquiries  concerning   any
delinquency  regarding  routine  accounts  (SOR  ¶  4.c). Under Guideline  F, the  SOR alleges
that   Applicant owed,  as  of   May   21,  2021,  three   charged-off   debts for $24,833   (SOR  ¶
5.a), $  830  (SOR ¶ 5.b), and  $53  (SOR ¶ 5.i); and  eight  collection debts for $185  (SOR ¶
5.c), $572  (SOR ¶  5.d), $1,493  (SOR ¶  5.e), $619  (SOR ¶  5.f), $1,188  (SOR ¶  5.g), $567
(SOR ¶ 5.h), $3,923 (SOR ¶ 5.j), and $469 (SOR ¶ 5.k).
When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations but indicated
that he did not intentionally falsify his SF 86. Applicant asserted that he had abstained
from alcohol since December 5, 2019; that he sought help for his depression and is on
mental-health  medications;  and  that  he  had  paid  off  some  of  the  delinquent  debts,
including the debt in SOR ¶ 5.a.
Applicant’s admissions to abusing alcohol and committing drunk-driving offenses;
to receiving treatment for the diagnosed conditions; and to having owed the delinquent
debts are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings,
exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old high school graduate with some online college study.
(GE  1.)  He  has  never  married,  but  he  has  had  a  cohabitant  girlfriend  for  the  past  five
years.  She  has  two  children,  ages  17  and  20,  who  live  with  them.  (Tr.  29,  32,  81.)
Applicant has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since about June
2017. (GE 1.)
Applicant enlisted in the ARNG at age 17 in April 2004 (Tr. 32-33), and he served
until February 2016, when he was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions
because he had tested positive for cocaine and alcohol in a routine ARNG screening. (Tr.
35.) He appealed the character of his discharge, and it was later changed to honorable
based on his military service record. (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 35-36.) He was activated twice to
combat duty: from May 2006 through April 2007 and from July 2008 to May 2009. (AE B;
Tr. 33.) He was granted a security clearance shortly before his second deployment. (Tr.
34.) On his return from active duty, he worked full time for his state’s ARNG, which included
a deployment overseas from October 2012 to August 2013. (AE C.) In September 2013,
he lost his full-time job with the ARNG. He indicated on his June 2018 SF 86 that funding
for  his  full-time  position  with  the  ARNG  ran  out,  but  his  medical  records  from  the  VA
indicate that his job loss was because of his July 2013 DUI. (AE C.)
Substance Use  and Treatment
Applicant  drank  alcohol  in  high  school  “at  a  party  here  or  there.”  (Tr.  36.)  His
drinking to excess started in the summer of 2007. After he returned from being deployed,
he initially consumed alcohol in quantity of 30 beers and 750 ml of liquor per week. (AE
C.) He eventually moderated his consumption to social drinking, about twice a week, until
about April 2013. After he and his then-fiancée called off their relationship three months
before  they  were  to  marry  (Tr.  37),  he  began  to  turn  to  alcohol,  often  nightly,  to  self-
medicate for mental-health issues. (AE C; Tr. 25.)
After drinking four to five alcohol drinks while out at a casino with family members
one evening in July 2013, Applicant was stopped by police for swerving. He failed field
sobriety  tests  and  was  arrested  for  DUI.  He  pled  guilty,  was  granted  accelerated
rehabilitation,  placed  on  probation,  and  ordered  to  complete  100  hours  of  community
service and alcohol counseling. The charge was dismissed after he completed the terms.
(GE 2.)
Applicant’s July 2013 DUI was a factor in him losing his full-time job with the ARNG
around September 2013. He drank 750 ml of vodka per night early that winter before his
family intervened in January 2014, and he attended a two-week alcohol program. (AE C.)
From March 2014 to November 2014, he worked as a part-time bartender. (GEs 1, 2.) He
drank  alcohol  at  times  to  excess  and  used  cocaine  intermittently  in  combination  with
alcohol in that job. (Tr. 26, 44.) He used cocaine as the drug helped him sober up more
quickly from drinking. He found that the drug helped him drink more. (Tr. 42.)
Applicant consumed five to six alcohol drinks and three to four shots of liquor on
April  18,  2014,  while  talking  with  patrons  and  then  cleaning up  with  his manager  after
closing the bar. While driving home, he was stopped by the police, who smelled alcohol
on his breath. He failed a breathalyzer and was arrested for  DUI. (GEs 1-2.) Available
records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicate a re-arrest date of October
25, 2014; a disposition date of January 14, 2015; and a sentence of  six months in jail,
suspended, a $500 fine, one year of probation, and 100 hours of community service. (GE
6.)
Applicant was seen at a VA health center in May 2014 and referred to the facility’s
substance-abuse  clinic.  He  reported  an  escalation  of  alcohol  use  following  two
deployments and use of alcohol to avoid his mental-health problems. A toxicology screen
of  May  8,  2014  was  positive  for  cocaine.  While  attending  substance-abuse  outpatient
programs  at  the  VA  between  July  2014  and  September  2014,  he  continued  to  drink
alcohol once a week, about two to four drinks each time. His drinking adversely affected
his relationship with his family between April 2014 and February 2015. (AE C.)
Applicant was unemployed from about November 2014 to June 2015. He was not
engaged  in  any  substance-abuse  treatment  nor  seeing  a  psychiatrist  during  that  time.
(GE  1;  AE  C;  Tr.  25.)  On  March  6,  2015,  he  presented  at  a  VA  clinic  for  a  medical
screening for a research study. He showed signs of mild intoxication, and he reported a
history of  consuming two to three alcohol drinks per day. He described his drinking as
“out of control” in the recent past. He was advised to abstain from alcohol. (AE B.)
Applicant worked for a home-improvement retailer from April 2015 to August 2015.
He  told the VA in 2015  that he had been  sober, but he  subsequently admitted  in  May
2016 that he had been drinking the entire time. (AE C.) In August 2015, he started working
as a manager at a bar. (GE 1.) In addition to using alcohol, he used cocaine on occasion
to at least November 22, 2015. (GE 2; AE C.) He reported during a psychiatric consult at
the VA in May 2016 that he had “hired his cocaine dealer” when he managed the bar so
that he and his staff would have access to the drug “as needed.” At times, he slept on a
sofa at work and was late to his drill weekend because of drinking. (AE C.)
On August 31, 2015, Applicant crashed his scooter in route home after consuming
five to six alcohol drinks with a friend on the friend’s boat. He was charged with DUI and
with probation violation (two counts). (GE 6.) He testified that he was charged with being
a two-time first offender for the April 2014 and August 2015 DUIs in that he faced one
DUI charge for the August 2015 offense with the ramifications of two DUIs. (Tr. 38.) FBI
records show that, on April 27, 2016, he was convicted of  the August 2015 DUI and of
the violation of probation charges. On May 4, 2016, he was sentenced on the DUI charge
to six months in jail, one year of probation, and a $500 fine. He had to serve only ten days
in jail as the court accepted his attendance at a substance-abuse treatment program in
lieu of jail time. He was sentenced on the probation violation counts to two days in jail for
each  offense,  to  serve  concurrently.  (GE  6;  AE  C.)  He  was  also  required  to  have  an
interlock-type device in his vehicle. (GE 2; Tr. 28.) He testified that he fulfilled the terms
of his sentence, and the device was removed. (Tr. 78.)
On  September  17,  2015,  Applicant  went  to  a  VA  mental-health  clinic  seeking
substance-abuse  treatment.  He  reported  some  anxiety  and  exhibited  some  signs  of
minimization of the harm drinking had caused him. He reported drinking “only six drinks”
before his August 2015 DUI. He was placed on a trial dose of Lexapro and referred to an
outpatient alcohol and substance abuse program. (AE C.)
During a follow-up visit with his treating psychiatrist at his local VA clinic on October
19,  2015,  Applicant  reported  he  had  completed  seven  sessions  of  substance-abuse
treatment and had abstained from alcohol. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder
and PTSD (rule out), and was continued on Lexapro. (AE C.)
Applicant  quit  working  at  the  bar  in  November  2015  to  focus  on  his  alcohol
rehabilitation.  (GE  1.)  On  November  23,  2015,  he  went  to  a  VA  medical  center’s
psychiatric emergency department accompanied by his ARNG supervisor. Applicant had
been  late  to  a  military  drill  because  of  intoxication,  after  having  consumed  a  gallon  of
alcohol. He reported binge drinking of six to eight beers plus 750 ml of vodka or rum every
three weeks and consumption of lesser amounts several times per week, to as recently
as November 20, 2015. He complained of symptoms of PTSD and requested substance-
abuse treatment. He was admitted for observation for 23 hours, and was diagnosed with
alcohol use disorder (binge pattern) and PTSD.  Assessed as psychiatrically stable, he
was discharged on November 24, 2015, for immediate admission to a private inpatient
alcohol-treatment facility for alcohol detoxification. The records from that private treatment
facility were not submitted in evidence, but the VA records show that he was discharged
from the inpatient facility on December 1, 2015. (AE C.)
While residing in a sober-housing situation, Applicant received follow-up recovery-
support treatment in a VA intensive outpatient program (IOP) from December 2, 2015, to
December 23, 2015, for diagnosed alcohol use disorder (severe) and PTSD. In reviewing
his  options  for  follow-up  care  with  his  recovery  support  team  on  December  17,  2015,
Applicant expressed a desire to continue individual therapy to address his negative life
experiences, as his felt his alcohol and drug use stemmed from “defective ability to cope.”
He did not believe group substance-abuse treatment would be helpful to him, although
medical records show that he had demonstrated active listening skills in group sessions.
He  was  discharged  on  December  23,  2015,  to  follow-up  with  counseling  until  a  dual-
diagnosis  program  became  available,  and  to  continue  with  his  VA  psychiatrist.  At
discharge, Applicant indicated that he was “considerably” confident in his ability to abstain
from alcohol and drugs. He denied any cravings to use alcohol or drugs in the prior 30
days. (AE C.)
During a session with his VA psychiatrist on January 12, 2016, Applicant reported
that he had abstained from alcohol for 50 days with no cravings. On January 26, 2016,
he  was  determined  to  be  not  a  good  candidate  for  a  certain  dual-diagnosis  program
because  his  medical  record  did  not  adequately  support  the  PTSD  diagnosis.  He  was
accepted into another program through the VA to start on May 26, 2016, or earlier, if a
slot became available. (AE C.)
Applicant agreed to participate in  a once-weekly continuing care program at the
VA,  but  he  never  started  the  program.  He  told  the  VA  he  was  on  active-duty  orders
through February 23, 2016, and was unable to attend. In lieu of that program, he attended
individual  therapy  outside  the  VA  setting.  His  therapist  advised  the  VA  that,  after  six
weeks  of  therapy,  she  considered  Applicant  to  be  in  the  “pre-contemplative  stage”
regarding  his  drinking  and  in  some  denial.  VA  records  show  that  Applicant  consumed
alcohol on at least February 14, 2016. (AE C.)
On March 4, 2016, Applicant was admitted to a six-week specialized inpatient dual-
diagnosis  program  at  a  VA  facility  for  diagnosed  alcohol  dependence  and  PTSD.  A
breathalyzer  test  on  admission  was  negative  for any  alcohol.  Applicant  interacted  well
with peers and staff and attended all groups and classes with good participation. Clinical
opinion was positive for Applicant’s development of goals toward an overall improvement
in his lifestyle and his challenges. He was discharged as scheduled on April 15, 2016,
with a plan to continue cognitive behavioral therapy with his private therapist.  During a
psychiatric visit at the VA on April 19, 2016, Applicant reported that he had maintained
sobriety. (AE C.)
On May 16, 2016, Applicant was assessed at the VA to see if an increase in his
service-connected disability was warranted due to his mental-health issues. He reported
no alcohol consumption since February 14, 2016, and was diagnosed, in part, with PTSD
and alcohol use disorder, severe, in early remission. (AE C.)
Applicant became employed as a clerk at a gas station in June 2016. He was fired
in March 2017 for a violation of his employer’s policies unrelated to drinking. (GEs 1-2.)
Applicant then held a part-time job in maintenance for a daycare facility until he started
his current employment in June 2017. (GE 1.) He denies any drinking around that time,
but admits that he did not take his recovery as seriously as he should have. (Tr. 26.-27.)
After not drinking for approximately 18 months (AE C), he began drinking socially, “a drink
now  and  then  at  dinner,”  in  the  summer  of  2017.  (Tr.  47.)  Applicant  thought  he  could
control his drinking. (Tr. 50.)
On his June 2018 SF 86, Applicant disclosed that he received treatment for PTSD
for  about  two  months  in  2016.  He  listed  his three  DUIs  and  one  violation  of  probation
offense. Concerning an SF 86 inquiry into whether his use of alcohol had any negative
impact on his work performance, professional or personal relationships, his finances, or
resulted in law enforcement intervention, Applicant indicated that, in addition to the DUIs,
alcohol caused him problems between September 2013 and September 2015 in that his
relationships  with  family and  friends  suffered.  He  disclosed  that  he had  participated  in
alcohol-rehabilitation programs at the VA between November 2015 and January 2016.
(GE 1.)
In  response  to  an  SF  86  illegal  drug  inquiry,  he  reported  that  he  used  cocaine
infrequently and only when drinking between September 2013 and September 2016. He
responded affirmatively to an SF 86 inquiry into whether his drug use occurred when he
possessed a  security clearance.  He explained  that he self-medicated  with  alcohol and
sometimes cocaine when he was in a “rough place” in his life, but that he had checked
himself  into  rehabilitation,  was  taking  medications  to  control  his  PTSD,  and  going  to
support groups for his PTSD.  He  added that he  had  ended  all ties to  people  who  use
illegal drugs and drink heavily, and he denied any intention of returning to that lifestyle.
(GE 1.)
On  August  10,  2018,  Applicant  had  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an
authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He related that
he  was  drinking  alcohol,  despite  previous  treatment  for  alcohol  use.  He  described  his
current  consumption  as  one  or  two  drinks  per  month  at  family  functions,  usually
celebrations, which he did not consider to be abusive. He stated  that he  would “never”
again consume alcohol to the point where it impacted him negatively. (GE 2.)
As for his cocaine use, Applicant recalled during his PSI that he last used cocaine
around September 2015 and not September 2016. He stated that he used cocaine about
five times, in bar settings, while he held a security clearance. He denied any intention to
use  cocaine  in  the  future  because  of  his  “current  career”  and  stated  that  he  had  no
ongoing association with individuals who use the drug. (GE 2.) Applicant now asserts that
his  cocaine  use  occurred  between  September  2014  and  September  2015,  when  a
positive drug screen for cocaine led to his discharge from the ARNG in February 2016.
(Tr. 41.) VA records show he tested positive for cocaine on May 18, 2014, and again on
November 22, 2015. (AE C.) He now recalls that he first used cocaine on his birthday in
March 2014 and last used cocaine before he entered the dual-diagnosis program, which
VA records show started on March 4, 2016. (AE C; Tr. 44) He told the clinicians in the
dual-diagnosis program that he last used cocaine on November 22, 2015. The evidence
substantiates  that  he  used  cocaine  on  occasion  between  March  2014  and  at  least
November 2015 rather than from September 2013 to September 2015 as reported on his
SF 86, or from September 2014 to September 2015 as stated during his PSI.
Applicant’s  drinking  eventually  progressed  to  every  other  day  after  work.  He
testified at his hearing that it was not that he lacked control over his drinking at that time,
but  he  “thought  it  was  on  that  path.”  (Tr.  47-49.)  On  December  5,  2019,  Applicant
contacted his VA psychiatrist and reported that “the drinking started back up” and that his
mental-health  medications  were  ineffective.  He  had  not  been  taking  his  psychiatric
medications. (AE B.)
On December 10, 2019, Applicant voluntarily sought treatment in the psychiatric
emergency room  at  the  VA for his alcohol use  disorder.  He felt  that  he  could  not  stop
drinking on his own and could not safely undergo detoxification at home. (Tr. 49-50.) He
was admitted overnight for observation prior to entering a substance-abuse day program.
A drug screen of December 10, 2019, detected no presence of illegal drugs. He reported
a last use of  cocaine some four years prior, but recent use of alcohol to a last use on
December 5, 2019. He described his drinking as “getting out of hand.” He used alcohol
to address issues of insomnia and anxiety, and reported consuming two bottles of vodka
every two to three days preceding his last use. He was discharged to a recovery-support
program  on December 11, 2019, with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  He was not
accepted for admission to a higher level of residential treatment as clinical opinion was
that his needs could be met at the lower level of care. (AE B.)
Applicant  attended  a  recovery-support  program,  which  included  group  day
sessions  starting  December  12,  2019,  in  the  same  substance-abuse  rehabilitation
program  he  had  attended  in  2015.  He  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependence,
uncomplicated.  His  family  and  friends  were  supportive  of  his  recovery,  and  he  felt
extremely confident throughout treatment that he would not use alcohol or illegal drugs.
Initially, he reported that he was slightly bothered by cravings or urges to use alcohol. He
attended  and  participated  in  all  aspects  of  the  program,  including  group  sessions  of
December  17,  2019,  in  which  the  importance  of  medication  compliance  was  stressed,
and  December  30.  2019,  in  which  attending  self-help  meetings  after  discharge  was
encouraged.  He  remained  abstinent  from  alcohol  and  illegal  drugs,  as  confirmed  by
negative urine screens and breathalyzer tests. Clinicians assessed him as able to identify
and discuss triggers and urges, and having developed good coping skills to avoid relapse.
Applicant requested to follow up the program in an evening IOP outside the VA network.
At discharge to his home on January 6, 2020, he was referred to a community resource
for assistance with securing an IOP. He also planned to see his private therapist and his
psychiatrist at the local VA primary-care clinic. (AE B.)
During a January 7, 2020 session with his VA psychiatrist, Applicant reported that
he  had  become  complacent  with  social  alcohol  use  and  so  took  action  to  stop  using
alcohol.  He  expressed his intention  to  pursue  an  evening  IOP  and denied  any current
cravings or urges to use alcohol. Concerning his mental-health medications, he admitted
that he had discontinued taking his Depakote on his own. He was continued on Adderall
and cleared to return to work. (AE B.)
Applicant testified that he attended an IOP three nights per week for two months.
(Tr. 27, 51.) Records of that program are not in evidence. In response to interrogatories,
on  January  21,  2021,  Applicant  stated  that  his  alcohol  and  drug  use  was  “more  of  an
escape from underlying PTSD issue.” He indicated that he was “seeking counseling for
mental health due to PTSD still.” (GE 2.)
On July 27, 2020, Applicant was diagnosed by the VA with adult attention deficit
hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD).  He  currently  takes  bupropion  for  a  mood  disorder
diagnosed in February 2021 and Ritalin for his ADHD. (AEs B-C; Tr. 79.) He is currently
on a maintenance schedule where he sees his VA-appointed psychiatrist every two or
three  months.  He  is  not  currently  receiving  therapy  from  a  therapist.  He  last  saw  the
private  therapist  in  Spring  2021,  and  he  has  been  looking  for  a  new  therapist  without
success. (Tr. 51, 84.) He has requested an appointment with his VA psychiatrist because
of  increased  depression  over  the  last  month.  (Tr.  80.)  Notwithstanding  his  history  of
drinking  to  self-medicate  mental-health  issues,  he  does  not  believe  he  is  at  risk  of
relapsing into alcohol. (Tr. 80.)
Applicant is not  involved  in any  self-help  meetings such  as  Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA), but he  has participated  about once  a  week in  an  online  program  Smart Recovery,
which he states instructs on “more  modern coping skills and  techniques.” (Tr. 52-53.) He
signed  onto  Smart Recovery  in January  2020. (Tr. 53.)  He  denies any  consumption  of
alcohol since  December 5, 2019, and  any  intention  to  drink alcohol in the future. (Tr. 27-
28.)  His girlfriend  and  family  are his primary  support system. (Tr. 53.)  He testified  that his
job is also a significant deterrent to relapse. (Tr. 81.)
Finances
Applicant’s finances began to suffer around 2014 and 2015, when he was drinking
heavily.  He  testified  that  all  of  his  money  went  to  fight  cancer.  (Tr.  54.)  Available  VA
records  do  not  show a  cancer diagnosis (AEs  B-C),  and  he  presented  no  evidence of
medical payments. Periods of unemployment were a factor in him being unable to meet
some of his expenses. (Tr. 54.)
Applicant  responded  affirmatively  on  his  June  2018  SF  86  to  inquiries  into  any
delinquency involving enforcement. He listed one debt of $20,000, for which his pay was
garnished. At the time, he believed it was a credit-card debt, but he recalled during his
August 2018 PSI that it was a car-loan deficiency balance. (GE 2.) About steps to satisfy
the debt, he indicated on his SF 86, “I had no clue about it. . . talking with lawyer to get it
resolved  sooner.”  He  answered  “No”  to  the  SF  86  questions  about  any  delinquency
involving  routine  accounts,  but  added,  “Besides  previously  stated  not  that  I  can
remember.” (GE 1.)
As  of  July  14,  2018,  Applicant’s  credit  report  (GE  5)  showed  the  delinquent
accounts listed in SOR ¶¶ 5.a.-5.j. As of April 9, 2020 (GE 4), his credit report showed an
additional  delinquency  (SOR  ¶  5.k).  The  delinquency  and  payment  histories  for  the
accounts are reflected in the following table:

During his August 2018 PSI, Applicant was confronted about the delinquencies on
his credit  report. About  the previously disclosed  garnishment, Applicant  stated  that his
wages were being garnished at 24% if his pay since March 2018 to recover a $20,000
deficiency balance on a  car loan  that he  thought  insurance had covered.  He  indicated
that  he  was  unaware  of  any  other delinquent  accounts,  and  when  confronted  with  the
adverse credit information on his credit report, he was unable to provide any details. He
expressed  an  intention  to  pay  off  his  legitimate  debts.  He  had  not  had  any  financial
counseling, but stated that he intended to get some help to address his debts. (GE 2.)
Applicant asserts that when  he  found  out  about  the  adverse credit  information  on
his credit record,  he  “tried  to  get one  of those  credit  consolidators and  figure it out  that
way, and  then  it  kind  of fell  off. [He] got  promoted  at work and  it wasn’t important to  [him],
so   [he]  neglected   it.”  (Tr.  55.)  In   his  January   2021   response   to   DOHA   interrogatories,
Applicant stated,  “1/2  of  all  debts  paid  and  working  with  lawyer for rest.” (GE  2.)  He  now
admits   that  it  was  not   until  he   received   the   SOR  that  he   realized   he   could  not  put   off
11
dealing with the debts any longer. (Tr. 55.) He maintains that he paid off some $30,000
in debt balances, including the car-loan debt in SOR ¶ 5.a, which was resolved through
garnishment. (Tr. 56.) He provided no documentation proving that any of the SOR debts
have been paid.
As of May 2022, Applicant was $387 past due on a $16,012 vehicle loan obtained
in August 2017. His account first became past due 30 days in December 2017. It was 90
days  past  due  in  January  2019,  December  2020,  and  January  2021.  The  loan  had  a
balance  of  $8,364  as  of  late  May  2022.  (AE  A.)  He  testified  about  the  May  2022
delinquency that his car payment was not debited properly from his bank account so the
bank rejected his payment. He paid $400 on July 4, 2022, to catch up. (Tr. 76.)
A credit-card account opened with a retailer in May 2021  was reported as being
120 days past due in February 2022, although it was current as of June 2022 with a $253
balance. A $22,122 vehicle loan cosigned by Applicant for his girlfriend in August 2017
had never been late. She made the $421 monthly payments on time and had reduced the
balance  to $6,303 as of  May 2022.  (AE A; Tr. 30.) As of  July 2022, a $148 debt from
February 2020 for his interlock device was in collection.  (AE A.) He maintains that the
debt has been paid. (Tr. 77.) As of July 2022, his credit rating was poor. (AE A.)
Applicant received a substantial increase in his salary from $68,000 to $104,000
annually on his promotion effective May 2, 2022, to a supervisory role at work. (Tr. 29,

"In  his  answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  with  explanation.  His
admissions  and  explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  Based  on  my
review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following findings
of fact:
Applicant is 47 years old. He was married in 2006, and has two minor children. He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1997,  and  a  computer  science  certificate  in  1999.  He
worked for a large government contractor, Employer A, for 18 years, and over time was
promoted into an executive and leadership role. He left that employment in May 2021,
and started working for another government contractor, Employer B, in a similar role. His
job  performance  in  both  positions  has  been  lauded.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance
since 2003. (Tr. 23-28; GE 1; AE E, F)
A  significant  part  of  the  corporate  culture  for  Employer  A  was  to  meet  with
colleagues in monthly after-work happy hours. Applicant explained that he had hundreds
of  employees  who  reported  to  him,  but  they  were  spread-out  in  various  government
offices throughout the region. He was taught that an effective way to engage and connect
with his employees face-to-face was in these after-work social events. (Tr. 31-33.)
In  December  2016,  Applicant  attended  an  after-work  happy  hour  event,  and
afterwards went out with friends. He stated that despite drinking, at the end of the evening
he  thought  that  he  was  able  to  drive  a  short  distance  home.  While  driving  home,  he
missed his exit and got his car stuck in a grassy area. He claimed that he called the police
for assistance, which resulted in his arrest for DUI. He pled guilty, and had a restricted
license for a year, an interlock device placed on his vehicle, 6 months of probation through
the state Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP), and 10 mandatory ASAP classes from
about March – August 2017. He successfully completed the ASAP classes and the terms
of his sentence. He stated that his decision to drive that night was a mistake, and he is
remorseful. After his arrest, he made changes to prevent future incidents, by leaving his
car  at  home  and  only  using  ride-share  services  for  transportation  if  any  alcohol  was
involved in work or personal social events. He also stopped drinking alcohol for about 9
months after his arrest. (Tr. 29-31, 35-36, 82; GE 3; AE A)
For about two years, Applicant had been successfully using ride-share services to
travel  home  after  consuming  alcohol.  In  October  2019,  he  had  a  scheduled  dinner
meeting one evening after work. He stated that he had planned to drive home and take a
ride-share service to dinner. However, one of his employees asked to meet with him right
after work. He reported that meeting went longer than expected, and he was unable to go
home before leaving for his dinner meeting. He stated that the evening ended late, and
he had drank that night, but thought that he was safe to drive his car approximately three
miles home. He was stopped by police in a speed trap on the way home, and was arrested
for DUI. He pled guilty in February 2020, and was sentenced to 10 days in jail; a three-
year  license  restriction/suspension;  a  mandatory  three-year  supervision  by  the  state
ASAP  program  during  his  license  restriction/suspension;  a  fine;  and  mandatory  ASAP
classes. He has complied with the terms of his sentence, and his license restriction and
supervision ends in about three months. (Tr. 36, 46-50 53-56; 186; GE 4, 5, 6, 7; AE A)
Right  after  his  second   DUI   arrest,   Applicant   stated   that  he   sought   personalized
counseling  to  ensure that he  was taking  all  steps to  address any  issues with  alcohol,  and
find  a  professional who  could  best  assess and  assist him. He attended  counseling  from
October  2019   to   February   2020   with   Dr.  G,   a   clinical  psychologist  who   specializes  in
substance  abuse  treatment.  He reported  that this counseling  gave  him  the  insight into  the
specific way  his body  processes alcohol,  and  his personal and  family  history  of  alcohol
use.   He  reported  that he   learned  that   some  people  have   negative   reactions   to   alcohol
and  process  it in a way  that is  different from  the  general  population. He  stated  that he  was
not addicted  to  alcohol,  but  rather had  a  problem  with  binge  drinking. Applicant had  follow-
up meetings with  Dr. G  in 2021  and  2022.  He also  met with  a  counselor from  Employer
A’s employee’s assistance  program  for six  sessions in the  summer of  2020. (Tr. 38-46,
50-53,  56-57, 62, 90-95, 113-115, 127-128; AE A)
Applicant  stated  that  he  does  not  drink  anymore.  After  his  arrest,  he  abstained
completely  from  alcohol  use  from  Oct  2019  to  Jan  2021.  He  reported  that  he  learned
techniques from Dr. G to handle any social pressure he felt to drink at work or personal
social events. This included having a non-alcoholic drink in his hand at social functions.
He  was  also  taught  a  method  called  “zero,  one,  two”,  which  gave  him  an  appropriate
strategy to handle any situations involving alcohol. He stated that he was not told that he
could  never drink  again,  but  rather the counseling focused on how to  prevent  a future
relapse to situations where there was excessive alcohol use.  (Tr. 38-51, 59-60, 90-95;
AE A, L, M)
Applicant reported that he was ashamed of his DUI convictions, and he was not
ready to explain to colleagues and subordinates at work why he was no longer drinking.
He reported that after COVID-19 restrictions waned, he felt significant pressure at work
and personal social events. He stated that from about spring 2021 to October 2021  he
used the “zero, one, two” method to give the impression that he was drinking, when he
did not want to consume alcoholic drinks. He stated that on a few occasions, he would
have an alcohol drink in his hand, from which he had a few sips over the course of an
evening, to stave off questions about why he was not drinking. He left Employer A in May
2021, which removed the pressure he felt to drink at work social events.  Employer B’s
culture does not promote drinking. (Tr. 96-99, 101, 107-108; AE A)
His wife testified that after his second DUI, Applicant was ashamed and was not
ready  to  discuss  his conviction  with  their  social  circle.  She  reported  that  when  COVID
precautions loosened they started seeing friends again. To avoid questions about why he
was not drinking, on occasion he used the “zero, one, two” method to give the impression
that he was consuming alcohol, when in reality he would have only a few sips of a drink
over a long period of time. She stated that eventually pretending to drink was too stressful,
and he just started telling their family and friends about why he  stopped drinking.  She
stated that he found support and understanding, and became vocal with friends about the
dangers of excessive drinking. (Tr. 188-215).
Dr.  G  testified  about  Applicant’s  treatment,  assessment  and  prognosis.  He  also
testified as an expert witness on substance abuse treatment. He has a doctorate in clinical
psychology and is a licensed substance abuse treatment provider. He has over 30 years
of  experience  providing  substance  treatment,  including  in  several  military  substance
abuse programs, by serving as a treatment provider, supervisor, and clinical director on
a  large  military  base.  In  February  2020,  Dr.  G  provided  an  assessment  of  Applicant,
stating that he has made  significant  life  style  changes and adopted healthy behaviors,
which  promote  low  risk  choices.  He  also  stated  that  he  was  effectively  implementing
coping strategies as a deterrence to high-risk choices at social events. He reported that
he  expected  that  Applicant  would  effectively  manage  life  stressors  and  social  events
involving alcohol use in the future. He had similar findings in reevaluations in December
2021 and June 2022. He also conducted credibility assessments of Applicant along with
his evaluations, and believes that he was being honest. (Tr. 146-147, 184; GE 8; AE C,
D)
When he started counseling in 2019, Dr. G diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use
disorder  - moderate,  because  he  had  reported  a  dysfunctional  pattern  of  alcohol  use.
However, his current assessment of him is alcohol use disorder – moderate in sustained
remission. Dr. G reported that in their counseling sessions, they dug into his patterns of
behavior involving alcohol use, and identified changes that he needed to make. While Dr.
G prefers that his patients did not drink at all, he realizes that they need effective coping
skills and strategies for life situations where alcohol is present. One of the skills he taught
him was the “zero, one, two” method. He believes that Applicant’s current work and social
life  circumstances  are  healthier  for  him,  as  is  his  decision  to  stop  drinking.  He  is  not
concerned that Applicant will drive under the influence again. (Tr. 133-150, 150-185; AE
G, L, M)
There  are  four  character  letters  in  the  record  from  two  of  Applicant’s  friends,  a
colleague, and his supervisor. Two have known him over 20 years. He is highly regarded
and  he  is  described  as  trustworthy,  responsible,  professional,  committed  to  his family,
and possessing good judgment. The writers have knowledge of his DUIs and challenges
with alcohol, and they have witnessed the positive life changes that he has made. (AE F,
H, I, N)

"Applicant is 58 years old, married for the second time, and has two children. He
received  a  bachelor’s  degree.  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  December  2019  and  seeks  to  obtain  national  security  eligibility  and  a  security
clearance in connection with his employment. He worked as a Federal employee for one
of the military services as a manager from 1997 until he retired in October 2019. (Item 2
at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about  a  person’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this
paragraph.  All  the  statements  of  fact  regarding  the  allegations  are  from  a  Report  of
Investigation  (ROI)  prepared  by  an  authorized  investigator  of  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management  after  an  interview  with  Applicant  taken  under  oath,  except  as  otherwise
stated.  Applicant  agreed  to  the  accuracy  and  truthfulness  of  the  ROI  in  DOHA
interrogatories signed by him on August 3, 2021. (Item 4,)
1.a.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  July  2011  and  charged  with  Driving  Under  the
Influence (DUI). He stated that the court sentenced him to a pre-trial diversion program
and  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended.  He  also  had  to  perform  community  service,
attend  Mothers  Against  Drunk  Drivers  presentations,  and  take  a  drivers’  education
course. He stated that after completing the diversion program the charges were dismissed
and expunged. When questioned as to why this arrest  was not set forth in his 2020 e-
QIP, discussed below, he stated that he had self-reported it at the time, and he believed
the Government should know about it. (Item 4 at 12-13.)
1.b.  Applicant  admitted   that  he   was  arrested   in  April  2017   and   charged   with
Disorderly  Conduct. He  stated  this incident  was the  result of  an  argument between  his
wife  and  a  restaurant owner, eventually  both  he  and  his wife  were arrested.  He further
stated   that  the   court   dismissed   the   charges  after  one   year  of  no   interaction   with   the
restaurant.  Applicant stated  he  could not  remember  whether he  self-reported  this incident.
He further stated  that he  did not report this incident on  his security  questionnaire  because
he did not think it was required. (Item  4 at 11-12.)
1.c.   Applicant  admitted   that  he   was  charged   in  July   2019   with   a   Warrant,
Communicating  a  Threat.  During  a  verbal argument with  his wife  he  stated  that he  would
kill her after she  communicated  a  threat to  cut off  his penis while  he  slept.  The  police  were
called and  Applicant was arrested.  He  stated that  the  court initia
lly  found  him  guilty. Two
weeks later, on  a  petition  from  his wife, the  charges were dismissed. He stated  that he
did not  report this incident  on  his  security  questionnaire  because  the  case  was dismissed.
(Item  4 at 10-11.)
1.d. Applicant admitted that he was arrested in August 2019 and charged with DUI.
He  was  arrested  after  attending  his  own  retirement  party.  In  February  2020  he  was
convicted. He spent two days in jail, paid a fine, his driver’s license was suspended for
90 days, and he was placed on one year’s unsupervised probation. Applicant stated that
he did report this arrest to his Federal civilian employer as required. He did not report it
on his security questionnaire since he did self-report it, and he believed the Government
should know about it. (Item 4 at 9-10.)
1.e.  Applicant  admitted   that  he   was  arrested   in  July   2020   for  Harassment  and
Simple  Assault. The  charges were in regard to  two  fights between  Applicant and  his wife.
According   to   Applicant   all   the   charges  were  eventually   dismissed   by   the   court   with   no
findings. (Item  4 at 8-9.)
1.f.  Applicant  admitted   that   he   was  arrested   in  August  2020   and   charged   with
Public Intoxication. He  was issued  a  citation, and  immediately  paid the  $300  fine. (Item  4
at 7-8.)
1.g. Applicant  admitted  that  he  was arrested  in April 2021  and  charged  with  DUI.
He  was  found   guilty   and   ordered   to   perform   community   service  and   attend   alcohol
treatment.  Attached  to  his Answer is documentation  from  the  treatment center showing
that he  had  successfully  completed  a  30-hour outpatient  program  on  August 17, 2021.
(Item  1 at 7-9; Item  4 at 17-18.)
There is no  documentation  from  any  court or law  enforcement agency  in the  record
to support Applicant’s statements regarding the disposition of  any of these offenses.
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  G, Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he consumes intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted this allegation.
Applicant had previously admitted to the facts of the  four alcohol-related arrests
described  under  subparagraphs  1.a,  1.d,  1.f,  and  1.g.  He  stated  in  his  responses  to
Interrogatories that he stopped drinking in April 2021 after his last DUI arrest.  As noted
above,  he  has  successfully  completed  a  drug  and  alcohol  education  and  treatment
program. (Item 1 at 7-9; Item 4 at 17-18.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. Applicant
admitted both allegations under this paragraph with explanations.
Applicant  submitted   an   e-QIP   on   May   29,  2020.  (Item   3.)  Section   22   of  that
questionnaire  concerns Applicant’s Police  Record. As  a preliminary  matter it states, “For
this section  report information  regardless of  whether the  record  in your case  has been
sealed,  expunged,   or   otherwise  stricken   from   the   court  record,   or  the   charge   was
dismissed.”
3.a. One subpart of that section asked Applicant to set forth criminal conduct within
seven years of the date of the questionnaire. The question asked specifically whether he
had received a summons, citation, or ticket. It also asked whether he had been charged,
convicted, or sentenced of a crime. Applicant answered, “No.” This was a false answer to
relevant questions about Applicant’s criminal history. Applicant stated  in  his Answer, “I
admit, but thought question was asking for unreported arrests.” (Item 1 at 5.)
3.b.   A   second   subpart  of  Section   22   asked   Applicant,  in   part,   “Have   you   EVER
been convicted  of an offense involving domestic violence or a crime  of violence (such  as
battery  or assault) against  your  . .  .  cohabitant,  spouse  or legally  recognized  civil union
domestic partner”  and,  “Have  you  EVER  been  charged  with  any  offense  involving  alcohol
or  drugs?”  (All   emphasis  in  original.)  Applicant  answered,   “No.”  This  was  also  a   false
answer to  relevant questions concerning  Applicant’s criminal history. Applicant stated  in
his  Answer,  “I  admit,  but  thought  this  was  asking   for  any   unreported.  Everything   was
reported to my supervisor at time  of  arrest.” (Item 1 at 5.)

employment.  Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  April  2020.
In  his
answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under each of the
three guidelines set forth below.
Guideline F: Financial Considerations
The  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  is ineligible  for a  clearance  because  he
made
judgment,  or
financial  decisions
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  raise  questions  about  his

In  February  2020,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  7  Bankruptcy.  (See  Government
Exhibit 2.)  The debts listed in the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy were discharged in July 2020.
A  Credit  report  of  the  Applicant  dated  February  1,  2022,  confirms  this  bankruptcy.
(Government  Exhibit  3.)  Applicant  explained  that  he  had  a  seizure  at  work  in
September 2019, and lost his job.  He could no longer afford to pay the household bills.
(Tr. p. 68.)  He is the sole financial provider of the household, as his wife does not work
outside of the home.  The bills discharged were mainly credit cards that he was able to
pay  when  he  was  employed.  Some  debt  that  was  discharged  were  his  wife’s  credit
cards that he did not know about.  He managed to keep the house and his student loan
debt.
Applicant currently has no delinquent debt.  He pays his bills on time, and lives
within his means.  He now uses a computer program to help him with his budget when
he  pays  his  monthly  expenses.  He  now  has  money  in  his  bank  account,  and  three
401(k) accounts where he is saving for retirement.
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
The  Government alleges that Applicant engages in excessive  alcohol consumption
that  can  lead  to  the  exercise  of questionable  judgment or the  failure  to  control  impulses,
and can  raise questions about his reliability and trustworthiness.
Applicant has a history of alcohol consumption that began as an adolescent and
has  continued
legal  and  occupational
consequences.  Applicant began consuming alcohol at sixteen years of age.  He states
that  he  usually  consumes  beer.  Over  the  years, he  has encountered  problems  at  the
into  adulthood,  despite
there  being
work  place  and  outside  of  work  from  his  excessive  alcohol  consumption.  He  was
arrested in 1992, 1993, and 1997, for Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants (DUI).
Applicant  does  not  recall  the  exact  dates  or  all  of  the  circumstances  of  the  arrests.
(Government Exhibits 5, 6, and 7.)
Applicant testified  that following  his second  arrest for DUI,  the  court  ordered  him
to  attend  Alcoholics  Anonymous (AA) meetings for 90  days, at least once  a  week.  (Tr.
p. 30.)  He  remembers  that after his first and  second  DUI,  he  was able to  stop  drinking
for  at   least   a   month.    (Tr.  p.  31.)    Regarding   his  third   DUI  in  1997,   he   really   has  no
memory  of  it.   He does know  that  the  court  sentenced  him  to   complete  90  days of  AA
meetings again,  and  that he  was placed  on  probation  for a  period  of time.   Following  all
three   arrests  for  DUI,   his   driver’s  license   was  also  revoked.     After  the   first  DUI,   his
license  was revoked  for 30  days;  after the  second  DUI,  his license  was revoked  for 90
days;  and  following the third DUI, his license  was revoked  for one year.  (Tr.  pp. 32-33.)
Applicant testified  that  while  working  for  a defense  contractor  from  2007  to  2015,
he  was reported  on  two  occasions by  two  different individuals because  they  could  smell
alcohol   on   his   breath   at  work.    He   was  warned   that  if  it   kept  happening,  he   would  be
subject   to   disciplinary   action,   up   to   and   including   termination.     (Tr.  p.  36.)     Applicant
admits   that   he   had   been   drinking   prior  to   coming   to   work  on   the   days  that   his  breath
smelled  of  alcohol.  (Tr. p. 37.)   He  was drinking  on  average  about  a  six-pack to  a  12-
pack of beer every other day, but did not  feel impaired by his drinking.  (Tr. p. 39.)
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  working  for  another  employer.  On  this
occasion,  he  was  sent  home  from  work  because  alcohol  was  detected  on  his  breath.
Applicant  believes  that  he  had  consumed  three  beers  before  going  to  work  that  day.
(Tr. p. 41.)  For about a month, from  November 2018 to  December 2018, he received
counseling  treatment  for  his  alcohol  abuse.  Applicant  stated  that  he  met  with  a
psychiatrist for half hour sessions.  He did not find their discussions overly helpful, as it
appeared to him that the psychiatrist seemed more concerned with other things.  (Tr. p.
42.)  Applicant was able to abstain from drinking alcohol for about two months following
the work incident.  (Tr. p. 43.)
It  was  not  until  March  2019,  that  Applicant  realized  that  he  had  a  real  drinking
problem and needed help.  He knew that he was drinking heavily, consuming between
6-10 drinks on a daily basis.  Through his Employee Assistance Program, he voluntarily
sought  out  help  for  his  alcohol  problem.  He  was  concerned  that  his  drinking  heavily
might be related to his depression.  (Government Exhibit 8.)
In March 2019, Applicant was called into work when he had been drinking earlier
that  day  at  home.  He  believes  that  he  had  consumed  about  five  or  six  beers  before
going to work that day.  Applicant arrived at work and smelled of alcohol.  His employer
required  him  to  take  a  breathalyzer.  Applicant  registered  a  blood  alcohol  content  of
0.167%.  Applicant was terminated from his job.  (Tr. pp. 43-44.)
Applicant entered a 30-day inpatient treatment program for alcohol abuse.  From
March 2019 to April 2019, he received intense treatment for alcohol abuse.  During this
treatment  program,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependence,  in  remission.
Applicant  had  one-on-one  sessions  with  his  therapist,  attended  counseling  meetings,
and  participated  in  all  aspects  of  the  program  as  required.  He  was  able  to  maintain
complete sobriety for 100 days.  (Tr. p. 46, and Government Exhibit 9.)
Applicant  stated  that  following  his  in-patient  treatment  program,  he  was
unemployed,  depressed  and  drinking  again.  From  September  through  October  2019,
he was unemployed.  He testified that he was not consuming much beer because food
and bills came first and money was scarce.  (Tr. p. 49.)
He  last  consumed  alcohol  about  a  week  before  the  hearing.  (Tr.  p.  49.)  He
consumed  a  couple  shots  of  Jim  Beam  and  two  beers.  (Tr.  p.  55.)  In  the  last  three
months,  Applicant  consumed  alcohol  about  once  or  twice  a  week.  He  usually
consumes four or five beers on each occasion.  Applicant testified that he was told by
his primary physician that he should stop drinking.
Applicant was referred for evaluation to determine if he may have a condition or
diagnosis,  which  if  left  untreated  may  disqualify  him  from  being  eligible  to  access
classified information.  During the evaluation by the psychologist on December 7, 2021,
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use  disorder  moderate/severe.  This  evaluation
was  obtained  through  an  interview  with  the  Applicant,  a  comprehensive  review  of  all
medical  records  and  supporting  records  provided  by  the  DODCAF  or  his  security
manager.  (Government Exhibit 8.)
Guideline I: Psychological Conditions
The  Government  alleges
that  Applicant  has  an  emotional,  mental,  and
personality condition that can impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.  Applicant

Applicant’s  evaluation  discussed  above  also  determined  that  Applicant  was
diagnosed  with  an  unspecified  depressive  disorder.  Results  of  the  personality
assessment  indicated  that  he  may  be  vulnerable  to  self-criticism,  uncertainty  and
indecisiveness during periods of stress.  The evaluator also stated that Applicant’s long
history of alcohol abuse with a lack of sustained abstinence inherently brings risk to his
judgment and reliability.  (Government Exhibit 8.)

"Applicant is a 30-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He will
be hired if he obtains a security clearance. He has a bachelor’s degree earned in 2015

Applicant was arrested in 2015 and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI)
and  felony  grand  larceny-auto  theft.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  DWI  and  the  lesser
misdemeanor charge of unauthorized use of a vehicle. He was sentenced to 12 months
in jail, with 11 months suspended for the unauthorized use of a vehicle charge. For the
DWI charge, he was sentenced to 60 days in jail, with 55 days suspended; probation for
12  months;  a  fine;  and  court  costs.  His  driver’s  license  was  restricted,  and  he  was
required  to  attend  alcohol  education  classes.  (Tr.  at  25-26;  Applicant’s  response  to

Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  drunk  when  he  was  arrested.  He  stated  that he
drove  a  short distance from  a  bar  to  a  7-11  that  was  next  to  an  IHOP.  He  left  his car
running at the 7-11 with an open alcoholic beverage inside that was left by his  cousin.
He  was  arrested  as  he  was  coming  out  of  the  IHOP.  He  fit  the  race  and  general
description of someone  who  took a mall officer’s vehicle  at the mall  close to where the
bar  was  located.  Applicant  does  not  think  that  he  took  the  mall  officer’s  car  because
Applicant’s  car  was  at  the  7-11  next  to  the  IHOP  running,  so  he  does  not  understand
how he could have driven both cars, but he blacked out and does not remember, so he
cannot completely rule it out. He accepted a plea bargain on the case because he did
not  want  to  risk  the  greater  consequences,  and  he  knew  that  he  was  very  drunk  and
should not have been driving. (Tr. at 45-48; GE 1, 3)
Applicant was arrested in June 2018 and charged with DWI, second offense. He
was stopped after making an illegal left turn. He had two to three beers, but he did not
feel  that  he  was  intoxicated.  He  stated  the  police  officer  had  difficulty  with  the
breathalyzer. He retained an attorney and was going to contest the case, but decided to
plead  guilty  with  a  plea  bargain.  He  was  sentenced  to  90  days  in  jail,  with  80  days
suspended; a  fine; and  his driver’s license  was suspended  for an extended period.  He
completed  all  of  the  terms  of  his  sentence,  except  his  license  is  still  suspended.  The
suspension will end in February 2023, but he will require an Interlock ignition device for
an additional two years. (Tr. at 21-22, 50-57, 61; GE 1, 3, 4)
Applicant has not been involved in any criminal activity since his 2018 arrest. He

"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.e and 1.g. He denied the
allegations in SOR ¶ 1.d, 1.f and 1.h. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of
fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 62  years old and  a  high  school graduate. He married  in 1981  and  has
two  adult children. He has worked  for federal contractors since  2007. (Transcript (Tr.)  21-

Applicant admitted that he drank alcohol at times to excess beginning in the 1980s.
On  November 12,  1996,  he  began  abstaining  from  alcohol consumption,  went back  to
church, and participated in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He admitted he relapsed twice,
once in 2015 and again in 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a). The first relapse was initially reported as
2016, but it was 2015. (Tr. 23-24, 26, 74)
In September 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He
disclosed that in 1996, he believed he was consuming too much alcohol. He was having
drinks with his friends after work, which turned into a daily occurrence. His wife did not
approve and it had a negative impact on his family. He confided in his supervisor who
assisted him in entering an inpatient alcohol treatment program. He was hospitalized for
three  days,  was  treated  for  alcohol  use  disorder,  and  upon  his  release,  he  began
attending AA and church, which he found helpful in maintaining his sobriety (SOR ¶ 1.c).
He testified that he did not consume alcohol until he relapsed in 2015. (Tr. 33, 48-50; GE
8)
Applicant told the investigator that in November 2015, while on a work trip he and
his coworkers had Sunday off. They went to church and later to the beach. Applicant was
offered a drink from a bottle of alcohol that was being passed around. He said he took a
swig and that was the first drink he had since 1996. He then went swimming, slipped, and
hit  his  head.  He  did  not  believe  he  was  intoxicated  or  that  alcohol  contributed  to  him
falling, but when he was treated for his head injury, the doctor smelled alcohol. He told
the doctor about his history of  sobriety and AA. The doctor decided to send him home
early  due  to  the  limited  amount  of medical care available  in  the  remote  location  where
they  were. Applicant said  he  reported  the  incident to  his supervisor upon  his return.  He
testified  that he  did consume alcohol at that time, but did not drink to excess.  He told the
doctor  he  was active  in  AA  and  believed  that  information  along  with  his head  injury, which
why  the  doctor sent  him  home. He stated  that in 2015, he  was
he  described as minor, is
attending  AA  daily  because  he  was helping  a  person  from  church with  his sobriety, so  he
attended  with  him. He said this was the first drink he  had  since  1996. SOR ¶ 1.d  alleges
the  incident  occurred  in  January  2016  and  Applicant said  it  occurred  in 2016. The  actual
incident  took place  in  2015  and  his  treatment occurred  in  January  2016.  (Tr. 27-30,  50-
52; GE 8)
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  due  to  concerns  by  his  employer  about  his
alcohol  use,  he  voluntarily  submitted  to  an  alcohol  evaluation  with  his  employee
assistance  program.  From  January  2016  to  March  2016,  he  participated  in  three
counseling  sessions  at  BA,  a  treatment  center.  A  letter  from  his  counselor  stated  that
Applicant  had  been  sober  for  18  years  and  attended  AA.  He  had  an  excellent
understanding of addiction and there was no need for further counseling. No disciplinary
action  was  taken  nor  were  there  any  security  concerns  noted.  Applicant  testified
essentially to the same facts at his hearing. (SOR ¶ 1.d) (Tr. 34-37, 52-55; GE 3, 8)
Applicant told the  investigator that in  March  2018  he  had  minor surgery  on  his  leg
and   arm   and   was  not  prescribed   any   pain  medication.  He  was  driving   home   from   the
surgery   center,   was  in   pain,  and   was  anxious  about  being   off   work.  He   impulsively
purchased  two  airplane-size  bottles of alcohol that were each  about  two  ounces.  He drank
the  bottles. He  then  proceeded  to  drive  home  and  clipped  the  mirror on  a  truck with  the
mirror on  his car. He did  not purchase  over-the-counter pain  medication  because  he  was
going  to  go  home  and  sleep  and  thought  the  alcohol was the  easiest way  to  sleep.  At the
time, he did not realize he had clipped the  mirror until the  driver of the truck pursued  him
and  Applicant pulled  his car over. The  driver called  the  police. The  police  detected  alcohol
on  Applicant. He failed  a  field  sobriety  test and  was arrested  for driving  under the  influence
of   alcohol   (DUI).  Applicant  testified   that   he   passed   the   field   sobriety   test,   except   for
walking  in a  straight line, which he  had  difficulty  due  to  the  surgery on  his leg  and  pain
associated  with  it. A  breathalyzer test was conducted  and  it recorded  .13% and  a  second
test recorded  .11%. Applicant disputed  the  results due  to  the  amount of alcohol he  said
he   had   consumed.  He   was  also   charged   with   leaving   the   scene   of  an   accident  with
damage  to  property  and  careless  driving, misdemeanors. (SOR ¶ 1.e)  (Tr.  30-33, 37,  57-
61; GE 8)
Applicant testified essentially to the same facts. He acknowledged he used bad
judgment. He explained he was not swerving, but the truck had extended trailer mirrors
that were lightly fastened to the truck. He further explained that the breathalyzer was not
working correctly at the time. Two men were trying to fix the breathalyzer while he was at
the police station. He waited about four or five hours for them to fix it before the test was
administered. He did not agree with the results because based on what he said he had
to drink, the reading was too high. The DUI charge was reduced to reckless driving and
the other charges were dismissed. Applicant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge and
the court withheld adjudication based on Applicant’s compliance with the court orders. He
paid  the  associated  fine,  completed  community  service,  and  completed  the  other
requirements. (Tr. 30-33, 37-38, 77-79; GE 6)
After  Applicant’s  arrest,  he  was  required  to  report  to  his  state’s  safety  council,
which recommended he participate in alcohol counseling, which he did from April 2018 to
June  2018,  attending  15  sessions.  Het  disputes  the  information  on  the  intake
questionnaire that is part of the packet from the counseling center, BA. (GE 4)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that in April 2018, Applicant provided misleading statements to
a mental health professional (MHP) evaluating his alcohol use. The allegation states “You
stated  you  drank  ‘two  airplane  bottles of  liquor’  before  your DUI arrest  in  March  2018;
when  in  truth,  it  was  determined  you  drank  five  full  alcoholic  beverages  prior  to  your
arrest.”  Applicant  has  consistently  stated  he  drank  two  airplane  bottles  of  alcohol.  He
credibly testified that he told the MHP that he drank two airplane bottles of alcohol. He
explained  that  the  MHP  completed  the  questionnaire,  not  him.  The  form  is  not  in
Applicant’s  handwriting,  but  is  typewritten.  He  disputed  what  she  put  on  the  form.  He
credibly testified that she told him that it did  not matter what was on the form, he was
going to therapy. He said he answered “no” to questions that she checked “yes”. The form
asks “Type/amount consumed/used” and in the space provided in typed words, it states
“verbal: 2-2 ounce bottles. Written 2 airplane bottles.” Under the section which asked, “If
breath test refused, why?” [she] typed in “BAC .113/.108=5 drinks at time of testing.” He
testified that one question asked how often he would drink to have fun and the answer on
the  form  said  almost  all  of  the  time.  He  testified  that  he  would  never  have  said  that.
Another question asked how many days a week he consumed alcohol and the answer
said seven. He said this was false. There were numerous other questions that Applicant
said the answers were not his. I believe him. (Tr. 38-43, 60-62; GE 4 pages 42-62)
Many of the questions used the word “ever.” Applicant clearly stated that he had
an alcohol problem prior to 1996 and he relapsed once in 2016 and 2018, when he was
arrested for DUI. He disputed many of the answers on the questionnaire as misleading
by indicating that he had a current problem and was regularly drinking alcohol, which he
stated he was not. He testified that other than these two relapses, he has not consumed
alcohol and did not consume it after his 2018 arrest. I believe there may be confusion in
the questionnaire in that Applicant was responding to questions about his entire alcohol
history and not about his recent relapse and use of alcohol. The document does note that
Applicant refers to his relapse in 2016 and his second relapse in 2018. This also appears
to be the issue when Applicant was responding to government interrogatories. He was
referring to his alcohol use prior to 1996. He testified that he only consumed alcohol twice
after 1996. (Tr. 38-43, 66-72; GE 2, 4)
Applicant participated in the BA outpatient treatment from April 2018 to June 2018
and was diagnosed by a qualified mental health professional with alcohol use disorder,
relapse. He completed the program with a final diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, in early
remission. His prognosis was good. The MHP recommended he continue to participate
in AA. (Tr. 43-44; GE 4)
In  February  2021,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  government-approved  duly
qualified  mental  health  professional  (GMHP).  She  determined  Applicant  was  not
forthcoming with information, was inconsistent with his responses, and therefore he was
either untruthful or in denial of his alcohol use disorder condition. She determined that
Applicant  was  at  high  risk  for  relapse,  and  there  were  significant  concerns  about  his
reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness, and his prognosis was poor. (Tr. 44; GE 7)
Applicant disputed the GMHP findings and stated that he was frustrated with her
because  she  did  not  seem  familiar  with  the  steps  of  the  AA  program  and  seemed  to
disregard  his  active  participation  in  AA  as  significant.  He  believed  she  was  more  of  a
science person than a spiritual person. Applicant explained that he is active in his church
and has been a deacon for 17 years. He took his time answering the GMHP’s questions,
which  she  characterized  as  responses  as  being  elusive,  but  he  said  he  was  being
cautious  and  thoughtful,  realizing  his  answers  were  important.  He  believed  she
interpreted that as not being forthright. The GMHP did not agree with his use of his church
and  AA  for  help  with  his  alcoholism  and  abstinence.  His  spiritual participation  with  his
church and with AA is what he practices. She did not agree with him regarding step two
of AA that is accepting a power greater than  oneself and step three to turn over one’s
decisions to God. He felt there was tension with her because she did not agree with him
that AA has kept him from consuming alcohol. He admitted that during the past 26 years
of sobriety he has had two relapses in 2015 and 2018. He was surprised by the GMHP’s
responses to his commitment to AA.  I found  Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 44-46;
GE 7)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  had  two  relapses  since  1996,  once  in  2015  and
another in 2018, as noted above. He has participated in AA since 1996. He believes he
has taken responsibility for his actions. Applicant attends two AA meetings a week.  He
had a sponsor, who passed away about nine years ago. He has an accountability partner
who he is in contact with every day. They inquire on how they are doing and they share
devotionals.  He  continues  to  participate  in  the  AA  12-step  program.  He  is  an  active
member of the musical group in his church. He believes he is a recovering alcoholic and
will be forever. (Tr. 62-64, 75
Applicant read  a  character letter from  his  wife. She  stated  that they  were brought
up  in very  strict Christian  homes that did not allow  smoking, drinking, dancing, or going
to  movies.  She  believes because  of their  background  that any  alcohol consumption  was
considered  heavy and  that this is why Applicant has referred in the past to his heavy use
of  alcohol. She  stated  that Applicant abstained  from  alcohol consumption  in the  1990s,
began  attending  AA,  and  the  family  went back to  church. He  has  been  a  deacon  in  the
church for 17  years, taught Sunday  school, and  was in charge  of  counting  and  depositing
the  church’s offerings. He plays in the  band  at church every  Sunday. He shares his faith
“even   to   people,   sometimes  therapists,  who   aren’t  receptive.”  She   acknowledges  he
made   a   reckless  mistake   in  2018   when   he  used  alcohol.   He  took   responsibility   for his
actions.  He is  a  great husband,  father, and  friend  who  is  trusted  by  his bosses. (Tr. 24-
25; AE A)
Applicant provided character letters from friends and coworkers. He is described
as  dependable,  trustworthy,  and  upbeat.  His  supervisor  described  him  as  a  positive
person  whose  skills  are  “top  notch.”  He  is  valued  and  appreciated  by  his  coworkers.
Applicant also provided copies of awards photographs of his work. (AE B-M)

In about August 2006, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol  (DUI)  in  State  A.  He  had  been  drinking  mixed  drinks  at  a  party  and  was
impaired.  He  claimed that  he  gave  his keys  to  another individual  in  order  to  drive  him
home,  but  that  person  was  also  impaired.  Whoever  was  driving  Applicant’s  car  hit  a
telephone  pole  and  police  arrived  on  the  scene.  Applicant  claimed  that  the  driver  fled
the scene and he was in the passenger seat. He told police he had not been driving. He
claimed that, despite the fact that he had not been driving, police arrested him for DUI
because his car had been involved in the accident and he had a blood alcohol content
(BAC) over the legal limit. He was convicted of DUI. Based upon the self-serving nature
of his story and his arrest and conviction, I find Applicant’s claim that he was not driving
his  car  strains  credulity.  He  was  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  during  this
incident.  His  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  nine  months  and  he  was  placed  on
probation. He was also required to attend court-ordered alcohol-related classes and he
had to pay $1,600 in fines. He claimed that he has satisfied all the requirements of this
DUI conviction. He went to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings for about a year after
this  arrest.  However,  he  drank  alcohol  during  the  time  period  he  was  attending  these
meetings. (Tr. 18, 23, 25, 33, 37-38, 52; Answer; GE 1-3)
In  about  July  2010,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI  in  State  A.  He  was  pulled
over  after  driving  home  from  a  concert  where  he  had  been  drinking  beer.  He  claimed
that  he  had  only had  four  beers  over  a  five-hour  period.  He  was  given  a  breathalyzer
test,  resulting  in  a  .08  BAC.  He  was  arrested  and  spent  the  night  in  jail.  He  pleaded
guilty and was convicted of DUI. As a result of his conviction, he was fined and ordered
to take 18 months of weekly DUI instructional classes. He attended these classes until
about  2011,  but  transportation  issues  and  scheduling conflicts  resulted  in  his failing to
complete the courses. He was also ordered to install an ignition interlock device on his
vehicle, which he failed to do. Applicant lost his job as a driver as a result of this DUI. As
of the date of the hearing, he still had not complied with the terms of his sentence as he
has yet to complete the DUI instructional courses or install an ignition interlock system
on  his  car.  He  claimed  that  he  has  not  completed  these  requirements  because  of  the
time  and  money  it  would  cost  him.  He  also  acknowledged  missing  these  classes
because he was being foolish. (Tr. 19, 23, 26-27, 33-34, 37-43, 46-49, 56; Answer; GE

Applicant was arrested in about April 2011 for failure to appear and for failing to
complete  the  requirements  of  his  2010  DUI  conviction.  As  a  result  of  his  failure  to
complete the terms of his 2010 DUI conviction, his driver’s license was suspended. He
was  arrested  again  in  December  2012  on  the  same  charges  as  the  April  2011  arrest.

was  suspended,  Applicant  drove  his  vehicle  to  and  from  work  nearly  every  day  from
2011  until  2018.  In  about  December  2018,  while  driving  to  attend  a  job  interview,  he
was pulled over by a  police officer in State B for following another vehicle too closely.
When the police officer determined the suspended status of Applicant’s driver’s license,
he  was  arrested and charged  with  driving  on  a  suspended  license  and  driving  without
an ignition interlock device. He was convicted of both of these charges. Applicant knew
that  he  was  not  supposed  to  be  driving,  but  he  did  so,  regardless.  His  vehicle  was
impounded  and  he  was  fined.  He  paid  the  fines  through  a  payment  arrangement  in

Action” of his State A driver’s license suspension. Despite arguably not being eligible for
the Termination Action in State A pursuant to the language in its own forms (ineligible if
individual  has  not  complied  with  an  ignition  interlock  requirement),  Applicant  was
granted his request for a Termination Action in State A and obtained a driver’s license in
State  C.  He  is  not  permitted  to  drive  in  State  A  because he  has  not  complied  with  (at
least) the ignition  interlock  portion of  his 2010  DUI  conviction.  He claimed that  he has
not  driven  on  a  suspended  license  after  his  2018  charge  in  State  B.  He  also  claimed
that  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  and  driven  after  his  2010  DUI  arrest.  (Tr.  44-51;

Applicant claimed that he has steadily cut back on his drinking after his 2010 DUI
arrest  and  conviction. He  was  drinking  about  a  six-pack  of  beer  every day  prior  to  his
2010  DUI.  In  2020,  he  claimed  that  he  was  drinking  a  12-pack  of  beer  two  weekends
per month. During the hearing, he testified that, after he obtained his driver’s license in
State C in 2020, he only drinks one or two beers at a sitting. However, he also testified
that he drank four beers at a sitting about three weeks before the hearing. He claimed
that  he  no  longer  drinks  to  the  point  of  intoxication.  However,  he  testified  that  he  was
last intoxicated in December 2021 after drinking 11 beers at one sitting while visiting his
family in State A.  He acknowledged  that, at some point  in  the past,  he had a problem
with  alcohol  and  considered  himself  to  be  an  alcoholic,  but  he  has  never  been
diagnosed  by  a  qualified  professional  as  having  an  alcohol  use  disorder.  He  claimed
that he has never tried to abstain from alcohol completely, but may when he is married
and has children. (Tr. 23-28, 52-56)
Applicant  provided  a  character-reference  letter  from  his  facility  security  officer
(FSO) praising Applicant for his honesty, hard work, and responsibility. His FSO claimed
that he believed that Applicant has learned from his mistakes and should be entrusted
with a security clearance. (AE C)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h
and 2.b. He did not expressly admit or deny SOR ¶ 2.a, which cross-alleges SOR ¶¶ 1.a,
1.b,  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.g.  He  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  3.a  and  3.b,  but  with
explanations that amount to denials. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of
fact.
Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  mechanical  technician  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since June 2008. He graduated from high school and attended some college
courses but did not receive a degree. (Tr. 21.)  He has held a security clearance since
July  2009.  He  married  in  March  2017  and  separated  in  December  2019.  He  has  no
children.
In May 2008, Applicant was charged with carnal knowledge of a child, a felony. He
was 19 years old, was dating a 15-year-old girl, and had a sexual relationship with her.
The girl’s sister told their parents about the relationship. He pleaded guilty to contributing
to the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to eight weekends in
jail. (GX 10.) During an ESI in June 2018, Applicant told a security investigator the he did
not  think  he  was  doing  anything  wrong,  because  the  girl’s  mother  consented  to  their
relationship. (GX 4 at 18.)
In July 2008, Applicant was convicted of being a minor in possession of alcohol.
He was required to complete 50 hours of community service.
In  November  2008,  Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  driving  while
intoxicated (DWI). He was convicted and served two weekends in jail.
In  July  2009,  Applicant  was  charged  with  failure  to  appear  in  court.  He  was
convicted  and  required  to  pay  restitution.  (GX  9  at  4.)  At  the  hearing,  he  could  not
remember missing a court date, but he accepted the fact that court records reflected the
offense. (Tr. 24.)
In  February  2010,  Applicant  was  charged  with  being  drunk  in  public.  He  was
convicted in April 2010 and required to pay restitution. (GX 9 at 5.)
In  March  2011, Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor DWI,  2nd  offense.  He
pleaded  guilty  to  DWI  and  was  sentenced  to  a  $250  fine  and  6  months  in  jail,  with  5
months and 25 days suspended, He served two weekends in jail. (GX 8; GX 9 at 5.)
In February 2016, Applicant was suspended from work for three days because he
overslept due to alcohol consumption and missed his flight to a job location. He overslept
after drinking and arrived at the airport too late to check in. Someone else took his place
on the flight, and he switched places with his replacement two weeks later. (Tr. 24-25.)
In May 2018, Applicant was cited for urinating in public. He pleaded guilty and paid
a $60 fine. (GX 7.)
In   August  2019,  Applicant  was  charged   with   DWI,  2nd   offense.  He  had   been
drinking,   took   the   wrong   exit  off   a   highway,  and   ended   up   at   the   gate   of   a   military
installation where he could not turn around. He was arrested, pleaded guilty, was placed
on  probation  for 12  months, and  was sentenced  to  ten  days in jail,  which he  served  on
four  weekends.  The   terms  of  his  probation   included   refraining   from   excessive   use   of
alcohol,  and he  was required  to  complete an alcohol  safety  action  program  (ASAP).  (GX
6; Tr. 18-19.)  He  did  not report this conduct to  his employer  until he  went to  court.  His
employer suspended  him  without pay  for a  “few  days” for failure  to  report the  incident.  (Tr.
27.)
In July 2020, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor public drunkenness. This
incident occurred when he went to a friend’s house, found that the friend was not at home,
and  discovered  that  his  cellphone  was  dead.  He  lingered  around  the  house,  “trying  to
figure out how to get home.” Neighbors were suspicious and called the police. The police
arrived, smelled alcohol, and arrested him. He had consumed about eight beers and a
shot of alcohol. (Tr. 12-15.) He pleaded guilty, paid a $15 fine, and his probation for the
August 2019 DWI was extended for six months. (GX 5.) He reported this incident to his
employer, having learned his lesson for not reporting the August 2019 incident. (Tr. 27.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  abstained  from  alcohol  since  this  incident  in  July
2020. (Tr. 12.) He testified that he had attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings “in
and out” since 2019. His last AA meeting was in 2021. He stopped attending AA meetings
because he believed that he was finally on the right path. In 2020, he attended counseling
for about two months. He knows he has a drinking problem. He testified, “I wouldn’t say
I’m dependent on alcohol. I mean, I –it’s just, once I start, it’s always been difficult for me
to stop. It always  go extreme. And sadly enough, it took all this trouble for me to start
realizing that I needed to make changes.” (Tr. 20.)
Applicant  does  not  keep  alcohol  in  his house.  He  enjoys  playing  golf,  spending
time with his two young nieces, and hiking and camping with his girlfriend. He recently
bought a home, and he enjoys outdoor yard work. (Tr. 23.)
Applicant  submitted  an  SCA  in  April  2009.  He  answered  “No”  to  the  question,
“Have you EVER been charged with any felony offense?” He did not disclose that he was
charged with felony carnal knowledge of a child in May 2008. (GX 3 at 33.)
During  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  in  May  2009,  Applicant  told  the
investigator that he did not disclose the carnal knowledge charge in his SCA because he
was  told  by  an  unknown  person  that  his  record  would  be  cleared  if  he  completed  his
community service after his arrest for underage possession of alcohol. (GX 10 at 1.)
Applicant submitted another SCA in July 2016. In response to the same question
about ever being charged with a felony, he again answered “No,” and he failed to disclose
that he was charged with felony carnal knowledge of a child in May 2008. (GX 2 at 25.)
When he was interviewed by a security investigator in June 2018, he asserted that he did
not  read  the  question  carefully  enough  to  understand  that  the  question  asked  “ever”
instead of a specific timeframe. (GX 4 at 18.)
Applicant submitted a third SCA in August 2020. In response to the same question
about ever being charged with a felony, he again answered “No,” and he again failed to
disclose the felony charge of carnal knowledge in May 2008. (GX 1 at 31.) In his answer
to the SOR, he stated that he misunderstood the difference between being charged and
being convicted.
At the  hearing, Applicant  testified  that  when  he  was talking  to  investigators, he  was
talking  about  “the  situation” and  not  about whether  it was a  felony. He denied  that  he  was
hiding  anything, and  he  insisted  that  he  was confused  about  the  difference  between  being
“charged” and “convicted.” (Tr. 31.)
Two former supervisors submitted  statements on  Applicant’s behalf.  One former
supervisor has known Applicant personally and professionally for 15 years. He describes
Applicant as a natural leader and a reliable, trustworthy, and dependable worker. (AX B.)
Another former supervisor has known Applicant professionally for 14 years. She regards
Applicant as a trustworthy, responsible, and dependable individual. (AX A.)

Applicant attributed his alcohol issues at least partially to PTSD and dealing with
the  effects  from  his  two  combat  deployments.  By  2013,  he  was  drinking  almost  every
day. He was arrested in  January 2016  and charged with driving  while impaired  (DWI).
He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three days in jail, a fine, and court costs. (Tr. at

Applicant  was  arrested  in  September  2019  and  charged  with  DWI  with  a  blood
alcohol concentration (BAC) of more than .15%. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced

Shortly  after  his  arrest  in  September  2019,  Applicant  entered  a  veterans
treatment  program  for  PTSD  and  alcohol  use  disorder.  He  reduced  his  alcohol
consumption  throughout  his  treatment  until  he  stopped  drinking  in  March  2021.  He
received  treatment  from  the  program  through  about  May  or  June  2022.  His  therapist
(M.A.,  LPC  (licensed  professional  counselor),  LCDC  (licensed  chemical  dependency
counselor))  wrote  in  October  2021  that  Applicant  was  “extremely  engaged  and
consistent  with  his  treatment.”  He  made  significant  progress  and  displayed  an
awareness  of  the  negative  impact  his  previous  alcohol  use  had  on  his  wellbeing.  The
therapist concluded:
[Applicant]   has  developed   healthier   coping   strategies  for  managing   his
PTSD  symptoms  as   well  as  coping   strategies  for  managing   his  urges  to
use   alcohol.   He  has  displayed   an   increased   ability   to   express  difficult
emotions  related   to   his  past   trauma   and   effectively   manages  these
emotions without the use of  alcohol. (Applicant’s response  to SOR)
Applicant  went  through  a  court-monitored  veterans  program  (separate  from  the
program discussed above) as part of his probation. He is required as a condition of his
probation to abstain from alcohol. He completed therapy and group sessions under the
program. The court certified that he graduated from the program in March 2022, and he
completed  the  aftercare  program  in  October  2022.  His  probation  runs  to  about  March
2023. (Tr. at 10-11, 27, 29-32, 35-36, 47-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A)
Applicant   initially   testified   that  he   had   been   abstinent  from   alcohol   since   March
2021.  He   later  admitted   that   he   violated   his  probation   in  June   2022   by   drinking.1   He
stated  he  had  significant stressors, including  the  death  of  his brother-in-law,  and he had
about four beers.  He was required  to  write  a   “think piece”   to  the  court explaining  what
happened,   and   the   court  increased   his  monitoring,   He  has  been   abstinent  since   June
2022  and  plans to  remain sober.  He relies on  the  skills he  learned  through  therapy  and
a strong support system through his friends and  family. (Tr. at 10, 12, 17, 32-37, 48)
The SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling about $15,475, including $3,841

"The SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR ¶ 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline
J (SOR ¶ 3.a) and Guideline E (SOR ¶ 4.f), that Applicant was arrested for driving under
the influence (DUI) offenses in February 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and September 2018 (SOR ¶
1.b), and for operating under the influence (hereafter DUI) in October 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.c).
Under Guideline H (SOR ¶ 2.a), and cross-alleged under Guideline J (SOR ¶ 3.a) and
Guideline E (SOR ¶ 4.a), Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in February 2014,
while granted access to classified information, and charged with possession of less than
one-half ounce of cannabis.
Under  Guideline  E,  Applicant  is  also  alleged  to  have  falsified  a  May  17,  2017
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by not disclosing the 2014
marijuana possession charge in response to the police record inquiries (SOR ¶ 4.a) and
by denying any illegal drug involvement in response to a question concerning any drug
use while possessing a security clearance (SOR ¶ 4.b). Applicant is also alleged to have
concealed the September 2018 and October 2018 DUI offenses and the 2014 marijuana
possession  charge  when  questioned  during  his  December  2019  PSI  (SOR  ¶  4.c).
Additionally, Applicant allegedly failed to self-report his September 2018 (SOR ¶ 4.d) and
October 2018 (SOR ¶ 4.e) DUIs to his FSO.
Applicant denied all of the allegations when he responded to the SOR, including
the  DUIs,  which  he  denied  on  the  basis  that  he  had  passed  the  outpatient  programs
without incident and no recurrence since the October 2018 offense. He explained about
the marijuana charge that he was ticketed $50, but that the marijuana was left in his car
by  a  former  colleague.  He  asserted  he  had  forgotten  about  the  ticket  for  marijuana
possession,  and  he  denied  any  intentional  concealment  of  his  DUIs  or  the  marijuana
charge.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  high  school  graduate,  who  subsequently  completed
vocational  training  in  July  2005.  (GE  2.)  He  worked  as  a  technician  in  the  automotive
repair industry for over a decade before going to work in equipment repair for his current
employer, a defense contractor, in late May 2017. (AE A; Tr. 56.) He served honorably as
a wheeled vehicle mechanic with a clearance in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) from May
2007 to June or July 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 49-50, 56-57.) He has never married and has no
children. (GE 1; Tr. 56.)
On November 14, 2006, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-QIP
in application for a secret clearance for his Army enlistment. He listed two speeding tickets
from September 2005 and September 2006, but no other issues. (GE 2.) He was granted
a secret clearance for his duties in the military. (GE 1.)
On February 23, 2014, Applicant was stopped by the police in the parking lot of a
local  convenience  store.  He  exhibited  signs  of  intoxication,  including  glassy  eyes  and
slurred  speech.  He  told  the  police  he  had  consumed  four  beers  at  a  local  pub  and
admitted that he was “inebriated.”  The police directed him to a dry portion of the sidewalk.
After failing field sobriety tests, he was arrested for DUI. During an inventory search of
Applicant’s vehicle, the police found marijuana and two glass pipes containing marijuana
under his driver’s seat; marijuana residue in his center console; and a marijuana grinder
in the pocket of his driver’s door. (GE 5.) Applicant was subsequently charged with DUI
and possession of less than one half ounce of cannabis, first offense. He was fined $50
for  the  marijuana  charge.  (GE  3;  Tr.  48.)  Applicant  asserts  that  he  was  told  by  the
prosecutor that “it was the equivalent of a parking ticket with a $50 fine.” (Tr. 48.) For the
DUI, he was required to attend 15 alcohol-education classes. On his completion of the
classes, the charge was dismissed and his record was sealed. (GE 3.) He asserts that
his command in the USAR was aware of his arrest. (Tr. 51.)
On May 17, 2017, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-QIP for the
security clearance needed for his current employment. In response to the police record
inquiries,  he  reported  his  2014  arrest  for  DUI  and  indicated  that  he  had  to  attend  15
classes for the offense. He did not disclose that he had also been charged with, and fined
for, marijuana possession, and responded negatively to questions regarding illegal use
of drugs or drug activity including the following:
Have  you  EVER  illegally  used  or otherwise  been  involved  with  a drug  or
controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security  clearance  other  than
previously listed? (GE 1.)
Applicant’s clearance eligibility was renewed through the military about four or five months
after he submitted his e-QIP, and it was transferred for his work with a defense contractor.
(Tr. 60.)
On September 23, 2018, Applicant was on a business trip in another state for his
employer when he was pulled over for not having his headlights on. He told the police
that he had consumed three beers with dinner, but he had a strong odor of alcohol about
him and slurred speech. He failed field sobriety testing and was arrested for DUI. At the
police station, his blood alcohol content (BAC) tested at .14% by breathalyzer. (GE 4.)
Applicant  pled  guilty  to  DUI,  was  fined  $460,  and  ordered  to  attend  alcohol-education
classes  within  one  year.  As  of  December  4,  2019,  he  had  not  completed  the  required
alcohol-education classes as he was asking the court to accept classes taken as a result
of a subsequent DUI offense, committed in October 2018 in his state. (GE 3.)
Applicant consumed about four to five beers at a bar while out on a date in October
2018. He and his date drove separately, and he did not feel too impaired to drive safely.
He was pulled over while exiting a highway on suspicion of drunk driving. Applicant told
the  officer  that  he  had  consumed  some  alcohol  on  a  date,  and  he  failed  field  sobriety
tests. He was arrested for DUI and brought to the police station. Applicant recalls that his
breathalyzer result showed a .12% BAC. In April 2019, his driver’s license was suspended
pending the installation of an Interlock device  on his vehicle, which he had installed in
November 2019. He was placed on probation for 18 months, and was required to attend
eight  alcohol-education  classes,  and  complete  100  hours  of  community  service.  As  of
December 2019, he had attended seven alcohol-education classes but had yet to start
his  community  service  or  complete  the  alcohol-education  classes  required  for  his
September 2018 DUI in another state. (GE 3.)
On December 4, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator,
who  confirmed  that  Applicant  was  very  nervous.  (Tr.  26-27.)  When  asked  about  his
disclosed February 2014 DUI arrest, Applicant stated that he had consumed three to four
beers while playing video games in his home before driving to a local convenience store.
He claimed that he failed only one field sobriety test in that he could not walk a straight
line because of ice on the ground. He denied that any drugs were involved in that arrest;
that  he  ever  used  any  illegal  drugs;  and  that  he  had  an  additional criminal  charges  to
report since completing his e-QIP in May 2017. (GE 3; Tr. 19.) Additional questioning by
the investigator elicited an admission and details from Applicant about his October 2018
DUI, including that his BAC tested at .12% and that he was on 18 months of probation.
He  expressed  regret  for  the  incident,  but  asserted  that  he  did  not  believe  he  has  an
alcohol problem. (GE 3.)
When  asked  again  by  the  investigator  about  any  additional  arrests  or  any
association with drugs or drug-related arrests, Applicant responded negatively. (GE 3; Tr.
19-20.) He was then confronted about the February 2014 marijuana possession charge.
Applicant asserted that the marijuana found in his vehicle belonged to a former co-worker
who must have dropped it in his vehicle, although he also stated that he had never seen
this co-worker use or possess an illegal drug. Applicant expressed that he pled guilty to
possession  of  marijuana  because  the  drug  was  in  his  vehicle,  and  he  paid  a  fine.  He
denied  any  intention  to  conceal  the  drug  charge,  and  explained  that  he  had  forgotten
about it when he completed his e-QIP and when questioned during his PSI. (GE 3.)
After discussing the drug charge with the investigator, Applicant again denied any
additional arrests or charges involving drugs or alcohol before additional questioning by
the investigator disclosed his arrest for DUI while out of state on business in September
2018. (GE 3; Tr. 20-21.) He explained that he believed he passed field sobriety testing,
but  admitted  that  he  “blew  a  .12  failing  the  [breathalyzer]  test.”  He  admitted  that,  in
February 2019, he pled guilty to DUI, paid a $460 fine, and was sentenced to complete
alcohol-education classes within one year. He explained that he had not disclosed  the
arrest in response to previous questioning because he was scared that it would adversely
affect  his  security  clearance  eligibility.  He  stated  that  he  reported  the  incident  to  his
supervisor,  co-workers,  and military command,  but not  to his FSO because  he did not
know that it  was  required.  (GE 3.)  The investigator recalls  that  Applicant provided  him
with contact information for his military chain of command and for his civilian department
head, who could corroborate his self-report (Tr. 27), and that Applicant told him that he
did not know he had to notify his FSO. (Tr. 31-32.)
The  investigator  flagged  Applicant  as  having  questionable  integrity  because  he
had to question Applicant numerous times, and had to confront him with the evidence of
the  charges  before  Applicant  provided  the  information  about  his  2018  DUIs  and  2014
drug charge. (Tr. 22-23.) However, the investigator believes that, after Applicant admitted
that he  had  not  disclosed  his September 2018  DUI  because of  fear it  would  affect his
clearance, Applicant was “as transparent as possible with [him] after the fact in regards
to self-admitting.” (Tr. 23.)
Applicant testified about his PSI as follows:
As the  interview  went along, yes, I was very nervous. It  was an  interview
that randomly  came  up  with  no  knowledge  of  anything  that was occurring.
So   yes,  I  was  absolutely   nervous.  And   I  do   not  believe   I  was  asked   that
many   times   to   recollect.   From   my   memory   I   do   remember  Special   Agent
[name  omitted] asking  me  was there anything  else.  And  I stuttered  when  I
told him. And  told him  about the  DUIs.  And  my   verbiage  at the  end  was,
yes, I am  aware that  these  can  affect  your security  clearance  that’s why  that
makes  me  nervous. Not the  fact that I  was hiding  it made  me  nervous. So
that was also a  clear misinterpretation  of  what I was saying  or what I thought
I clearly  came  across with  towards him. And  still, I was very  nervous of  what
was going on, not knowing what was going on. Because this process has
also, the actual investigation is also, came up when it started in 2020. Has
also stopped me from reenlisting in the [USAR]. (Tr. 49-50.)
Applicant testified at his hearing that he never tried to hide his DUIs from anybody
and that he “clearly and openly” talked to his bosses and co-workers as a group. He also
testified  that  he  made  his  motor  sergeant,  platoon  sergeant,  first  sergeant,  and
commander in the USAR aware of his DUIs because he knew they could affect his career.
(Tr. 51.) He asserts that he was told by his co-workers to make sure he reported any DUIs
on  his  e-QIP.  (Tr.  52-53.)  As  for  his  alleged  concealment  of  the  marijuana  charge,
Applicant testified as follows:
And   [the   special  agent]   asked   me   several  times  about  the   marijuana.   I
honestly   didn’t  remember   that  charge.  Or  that  ticket.   Because   my
information was that it was a ticket so I could throw that out of  my memory.
The  thing  to  worry  about was the  DUI and  making  sure  that got  out  on  my
e-QIP. And  then  going  from my  DUIs,  making sure I don’t get another one.
(Tr. 53.)
When asked on cross-examination to explain why he did not tell the investigator
about  his  2018  DUIs  when  asked  about  any  additional  alcohol  offenses,  Applicant
responded that he did inform the investigator. As to why he had to be questioned so many
times,  Applicant  disputed  that  the  interview  went  as  the  investigator  reported  in  his
summary (GE 3) and testified. Applicant maintains he never denied any other arrests (Tr.
59), and provided the following account of the PSI:
I’m  saying  that’s not  what happened. The  way  he  was asking  the  questions
is not  the  way  that  that  is written  down. Because  the  way  he  was asking  me
the  questions  is, are you  sure, and  I  said,  I’m  sorry, let  me  correct that.  He
asked   me,  is   there  anything   else.   And   I   can   adamantly   say,  I  wasn’t
reluctant  but nervously saying  yes there is,  there was this, Okay, is there
anything  else.  Still  reluctantly  saying, yes. Because  I’m  nervous as hell. (Tr.
61.)
During his December 2019 PSI, Applicant expressed a belief that he does not have
an alcohol problem. He attributed his DUI arrests to bad luck. He initially described his
current  alcohol  consumption  as  four  to  five  12-ounce  beers  within  a  four  to  five-hour
period once weekly, usually on the weekends, and said that has been his drinking pattern
before and after his February 2014 DUI. Later during his PSI, Applicant reportedly said
that  he  was  drinking  four  to  five  beers  approximately  once  a  month.  (GE  3.)  Neither
Applicant nor the investigator was asked about the discrepancy. At his June 2022 hearing,
Applicant described his current consumption as “maybe one beer on a Friday.” (Tr. 68.)
He explained that he drank out of habit, and that once he resumed raising animals and
doing  his  community  service  and  other  activities  that  he  enjoys,  he  found  his  drinking
habit easy to break. (Tr. 71.)
The alcohol-education classes required for the October 2018 DUI were apparently
accepted in fulfillment of the alcohol-education required by the out-of-state court for his
September  2018  DUI.  (Tr.  72.)  Applicant  admitted  triggering  his  Interlock  device  in
December 2019, when he consumed some alcohol-laced egg nog. (Tr. 71-72.) He was
originally  ordered  to  have  an  Interlock  device  on  his  vehicle  for  two  years,  but  it  was
extended to five years  because he missed two calibrations, which each added a year,
and he  drove  a  vehicle  without  an Interlock device  in  July 2020,  which  added  another
year. (Tr. 74-75.)
In  October 2021, Applicant  was pulled  over while  driving  to  work in  a  new  car  for
him.  He did  not have  an  Interlock  device in  the  vehicle,  and  was charged  with  driving  on
a  suspended  license.  He testified  that he  thought he  was no  longer subject  to  the  Interlock
requirement based  on  paperwork that he  had  and  that he  did  not know  his license  had
been  suspended. He testified  there is  conflict  between  the  Interlock device provider and
the  state  as to  whether he  had  the  device removed. He paid a  fine  for  texting  while  driving
and   had   the   Interlock  device  installed   (Tr.  77-78),  but  he   is  having   problems  with   the
device.  He  has  been   reported   three   times,   most   recently   in  about   February   2022,   for
violating  the Interlock. He asserts it  is due  to faulty  installation  in that  if he  leaves the  car
with  the  lights on, the  Interlock is recorded  as  still  being  on  (“if  you  leave  the  lights on  and
walk away  the  machine  is still  going  and  it reported  him  as missing  a  breath.”). (Tr. 79-
80.) He explained  that he  has not had  the  wiring  of  the  device inspected  because  he  has
to take time  from work. (Tr. 80-81.) He does not want to be  accused  of tampering so  has
not tried  to  correct the issue. (Tr. 81.)  The driving  while license  suspended  charge  is still
pending, and he has appeared  four times in court on that charge. (Tr. 78.)
Applicant performed his community service for his October 2018 DUI by providing
assistance to a local Boy Scout troop starting in June 2020. He continued to volunteer
after completing his community service, and as of June 2022 he had provided over 250
hours. The scoutmaster attested to his completion of those hours. She has no knowledge
of  any  information  that  would  compromise  Applicant’s  status  with  the  scouting
organization. (AE B.) Applicant has been a registered den leader for a Cub Scout pack
for the past six months. (Tr. 54-55.)
Applicant denies any use of marijuana. He testified that he was subjected to drug
testing  by  urinalysis  primarily  once  a  month  during  his  13  years  in  the  USAR,  and  he
never  failed  a  drug  screen.  (Tr.  50-51.)  He  testified  to  recalling  that  the  police  found
marijuana  “hidden  underneath  the  passenger  seat”  of  his  vehicle.  (Tr.  64.)  When
confronted with the police report of marijuana being in a glass jar under the driver’s seat,
Applicant  responded,  “I  thought  it  was  under  the  passenger  seat,  but  it  was  not  my
marijuana.” As for the police finding glass pipes with burnt marijuana in the center console
of his vehicle, Applicant stated, “They weren’t mine, so they had to have been his.” (Tr.
65.) As for the grinder found in the pocket of the driver’s door, Applicant explained:
In the interview I stated that I gave [his former co-worker] a ride earlier and
dropped him off at a place called [pub name omitted] where he waited for a
ride. I waited with him, then I went home and played video games. I was
drinking at my house and then went to the [convenience store] to where i
got pulled over. (Tr. 65.)
Applicant maintains that he did not know any of the drug paraphernalia had been in his
car before he was provided a copy of the police report by DOHA Department Counsel as
he had only paid a $50 “ticket” in court. (Tr. 66.)
Character References
Applicant’s chief union steward authored a character reference letter for Applicant
(AE A) and also testified (Tr. 38-46.) The union steward has worked for their employer
since 1989 and has a secret clearance. He has been a union steward for 15 years, and
president  and  chief  steward  of  the  union  “going  on  seven  years  now.”  (Tr.  40-42.)  He
testified that he did not understand until a couple of months ago that employees have a
duty to self-report information that could affect security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 40.) The
chief steward previously understood that it is when individuals come up for the ten-year
review of their clearance that they are required to be forthcoming about everything that
has happened understood “within the first ten years and the second.” (Tr. 39.) The chief
steward recalled an issue involving an employee who had an incident  while intoxicated
that  the employee  reported  to  his supervisor  and not  the  FSO,  but he  could  not  recall
whether their employer took any steps to inform employees of a duty to self-report to the
FSO. (Tr. 43-44.) The chief steward believes that he is “probably not” required to report
a union member who informs him of a legal problem, but he would advise him or her to
inform  his or her  supervisor.  (Tr. 44-45.)  The  chief  steward  attests  that  Applicant  “has
been  a  model  employee  gaining  respect  of  management,  fellow  employees,  and  [his]
entire team of union officers.” (AE A.)
Applicant  provided  character  reference  letters  from  five  co-workers  (AEs  C-G),
who attest to it being common knowledge that Applicant was arrested for DUI while on a
road job for their employer in 2018. A co-worker who works with Applicant on a daily basis
recalled  hearing  in  2018  about  Applicant’s  arrest.  He  indicated  that  Applicant  was
forthright  about  the arrest  when  questioned  on  his  return,  and  that  Applicant  was  also
candid about his subsequent DUI. This co-worker stated that if it was common knowledge
to notify their FSO of arrests, he would have asked Applicant if he had self-reported and
encouraged  him  to do so.  He  asserts  that  Applicant has  taken  positive  steps  to  better
himself  in  the  last  five  years  and  requests  consideration  of  the  negative  impact  on
Applicant’s personal growth should he lose his clearance. (AE E.)
",False
"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 2.a. He admits and
denies portions of SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e and 2.b. He denies SOR ¶ 3.a. His admissions are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1999. He is not married
and has no children. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since
2021. From 2012 to 2021, he was employed by a different federal contractor. He has held
a security clearance at various times during the past 22 years and uninterrupted for the
past ten years. (Transcript (Tr.) 27-30, GE 1)
Applicant acknowledged that he is a recovering alcoholic.  He began consuming
alcohol around age 14 and continued to January 2019. (SOR  ¶ 2.a) He has never had
any alcohol-related incidents away from work or at work. He has never been arrested or
charged  with  an  alcohol-related  offense.  He  has  never  been  disciplined  for  anything
alcohol-related. In the past, he had issues with his ability to sleep and that caused him to
be late for work on occasion. He testified these were not alcohol-related. (Tr. 30-35)
Applicant acknowledged  that in 2012  he  was using  alcohol excessively. In  2013,
on his own accord, he  admitted  himself to a  5-day inpatient detoxification program  (SOR
¶  1.a). He explained  that at that time, he  loosely  had  a  plan  that he  would abstain  from
drinking  for a  while, but he  did  not  plan  to  stop  drinking  alcohol  forever.  When  he  was
discharged  from  inpatient treatment,  he  was  diagnosed  with  anxiety  and  not otherwise
specified   alcohol  dependence.  For  the   next  two   and   half   years,  he   did  not  consume
alcohol.  He  then  began  drinking  and  gradually  increased  his  consumption.  (Tr.  32-33,  42-
45, 76-78; GE 3)
In 2017, Applicant realized he was drinking too much and again admitted himself
to a 5-day inpatient detoxification program to get help.  He was diagnosed with  anxiety
disorder, mood disorder, and alcohol dependence (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c). He acknowledged
his consumption level was not normal and was harmful. He was referred to a therapist
and a psychiatrist, who prescribed medication to help with anxiety associated with alcohol
withdrawal.  He  was  told  to  abstain  from  alcohol  consumption.  He was  told  to  take  the
medication as needed. Lethargy was a side effect of one of the medications. He credibly
testified that he told his psychiatrist that his anxiety was better, and she agreed he could
cease taking the medication. He credibly testified that he has always followed his doctors’
orders regarding taking prescribed  medications.  He  did  not  stop  taking the  medication
contrary to medical advice. He was taking medication to relieve the anxiety associated
with  withdrawal  symptoms  and  believed  he  was  to  take  the  drugs  “as  needed.”  He
disputes  he  was  noncompliant.  He  saw the psychiatrist for two  visits  and  the therapist
twice a month for six months. He testified that the medication he was prescribed was to
temporarily  treat  his  acute  anxiety.  When  the  anxiety  ceased,  he  no  longer  took  the
medication. I found Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 45-49, 78-85, 105-108; GE 4)
Applicant abstained from consuming alcohol for about six months until 2018 when
he resumed. Then he felt he was consuming too much alcohol and it was not normal. He
again  referred himself  for treatment as  an inpatient  in  a detoxification  program for five
days. (SOR ¶ 1.d) He had two visits with a psychiatrist and he did not recall if he saw a
therapist.  After  completing  the  program  in  the  latter  part  of  2018,  he  began  attending
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). (Tr. 49-51, 85-90; GE 5)
Applicant acknowledged that he has been repeatedly told to abstain from alcohol
consumption.  He  testified  that  his  family  and  friends  recommended  he  attend  AA.  He
credibly testified that AA was more helpful than therapy, which was general and focused
on trying to find an event that triggered his alcohol consumption. He was open to talking
with a therapist, but it was the different approach that AA offered that made a difference.
Being  with  a  group  of  people  with  similar  issues  who  could  relate  and  understand  his
challenges  was  instrumental  to  his  commitment  to  sobriety.  They  offered  him  different
approaches  to  staying  sober.  He  stated  that  after  attending  AA,  he  started  to  see  a
different aspect to his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 51-54, 103)
Applicant acknowledged that when he began participating in AA, he was ready to
make a lifelong commitment to abstaining from alcohol consumption. His attitude shifted.
Before, his commitment was to be sober for a period-of-time, but not forever. Since he
began attending AA, his commitment  is for life.  He testified that  his  date  of  sobriety is
January 25, 2019. He credibly testified that he has not consumed any alcohol since then.
He provided photos of his sobriety chips, which included his three-year chip  and other
milestone chips. (Tr. 51-55, 59-60; AE D)
Applicant  attends  AA  meetings  weekly.  He  has  a  sponsor  with  whom he  meets
regularly and who guides him through the 12-step program and the “Big Book,” which is
the handbook for AA. His sponsor has moved and no longer attends the same meeting,
but  is  geographically close  so  Applicant  and he  meet  outside  of  the  AA  meetings  and
discuss  how to proceed  with  his sobriety.  Applicant provided  copies  of  the attendance
logs for his meetings since September 2020. He testified he attended weekly meetings
before then. Applicant has also taken on a leadership role in the meetings by being the
chairperson. He testified that the last three steps of the 12-step program are ones that
are worked on in perpetuity. He detailed each step. The last step is to spread the message
to others and be a sponsor. He has reached out to be a sponsor to a person and is waiting
for this person to respond. He goes to his AA meetings early to help setup and brings
refreshments. He also will mentor new participants to the group. (Tr.53-62; AE C)
Applicant testified that he no longer suffers from anxiety. His previous anxiety was
associated with his alcohol withdrawal. He does not take medication for anxiety and no
one has suggested he seek treatment for any disorder. He has adopted a healthy lifestyle
by going to the gym five days a week. He provided a copy of the attendance log from his
gym. (Tr. 40-41, 62-65 100-101; AE F)
Applicant acknowledged that in the past he was embarrassed about his alcohol
use. Now he does not have difficulty talking about it. Part of AA is to accept his condition
and freely discuss his experience and abuse of alcohol. (Tr. 65-66, 102-103)
In January 2021 Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist and
board certified neuropsychologist (LP), requested and approved by the government. She
administered psychological tests. She diagnosed him with alcohol abuse disorder, severe
in  current  remission  and  unspecified  anxiety  disorder.  She  opined  that  Applicant’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness could be compromised based on his conditions.
She  noted  that  Applicant  lacked  candor  during  his  interview,  which  suggested
guardedness  and  possibly  poor  insight  into  his  conditions.  She  opined  that  his
psychological profile suggested that he was not open to treatment, which increased the
likelihood of relapse. Therefore, her prognosis was guarded. (SOR ¶ 1.e). (GE 2)
Applicant provided context about his interview with LP. He explained that LP took
issue with the amount and frequency of his alcohol use. He explained to her it was difficult
to explain how much alcohol he consumed at different times because the amount and
frequency varied and it was difficult to quantify. He believed he was open and honest with
her. He believed that she thought he was being inconsistent because of his answer. He
also believed that he no longer suffered from an anxiety disorder, which was associated
with his alcohol abuse. (Tr. 66-67)
Applicant  was  evaluated  by  Dr.  W  who  has  a  Ph.D.  in  psychology  and  has
practiced in the field since 1976 and as a forensic and clinical psychologist since 1993.
He  is  a  Fellow  of  the  American  Psychological  Association.  He  is  licensed  in  several
jurisdictions and has been qualified as an expert witness in different disciplines. He has
an  extensive  curriculum  vitae,  which  includes  numerous  articles  he  authored  for
professional publications and presentations. He is an expert in his field. (Tr. 111; AE H)
Dr.  W.   evaluated   Applicant  in  November  2021   with   the   understanding   that   his
evaluation  would be objective. He noted  LP’s diagnosis  was that Applicant  was at  risk of
relapse   for  his   prior  alcohol  use   disorder,   especially   because   he   suffers  from   anxiety,
which LP  believed  could  lead  to  alcohol relapse. Dr. W.  diagnosed  Applicant  with  Alcohol
Use Disorder, severe, in sustained  remission. His prognosis was good. (Tr. 111-112; GE
2; AE G)
Dr. W reported that Applicant advised him that he occasionally experiences some
degree  of  anxiety,  but  he  does  not  think  of  alcohol  as  a  needed  solution.  Applicant
explained that alcohol was something he formerly used to help with insomnia, but he has
maintained a consistent sleep schedule for the past three years, which has eliminated his
insomnia  and  need  for  alcohol.  Dr.  W  conducted  psychological  tests,  which  were
significant in that they indicated that Applicant made no effort to minimize his mental or
emotional problems and that he completed the test honestly and accurately, which is an
indication of overall honesty on the part of Applicant. (AE G)
Dr.  W  reviewed  the  known  and  reported  history,  psychological  testing,  clinical
interview and mental status examination of Applicant. He determined that Applicant had
a  history  of  alcohol  abuse  and  dependence  and  that  he  had  to  undergo  detoxification
three times. Dr. W noted that “In Sustained Remission,” indicates that the individual has
not met the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder in at least 12 months. In Applicant’s case, he
reported that he has abstained for over three years. Dr. W noted:
Abstinence  is not required  for an  individual to  be  considered  In  Sustained
Remission.  All  that is  required  is for the  individual not  to  have  met  the  criteria
for the  Alcohol Use Disorder Diagnosis during  a  12-month  period. However,
for members of  [AA] to  be  considered  sober and  compliant with  the  program
of AA, they are required to  be continually abstinent. (AE G)
Dr. W  noted  inconsistencies in LP’s report. LP  first determined  that  Applicant did
not suffer from a  mood disorder, but then stated that he had “minimal effective treatment
for Alcohol Use Disorder nor his mood  disorder.”  (GE 2  at page  5). LP’s report references
no  mood  disorder other than  Bipolar Disorder,  which LP  indicated  Applicant did not suffer
from. Dr. W  noted  that  LP  concurrently  stated  that Applicant does and  does not suffer
from  a  mood  disorder. Dr. W  agreed  with  LP’s conclusion  that there  was no  evidence  of
Bipolar Disorder and  he  did  not  see  any  evidence  of any  other mood  disorder.  (Tr.  112-
115, 121-122; AE G)
Dr. W noted that LP asserted that Applicant had minimal effective treatment for his
alcohol use disorder. Dr. W emphatically disagreed with this, as Applicant has participated
in AA, which in his opinion is the “most effective and widespread treatment for [Alcohol
Use Disorder] in existence.” (Tr. 112-115; AE G)
Dr. W noted that LP opined that Applicant was not fully candid in his interview. Dr.
W found the opposite and noted that Applicant revealed information that was not flattering
and went far beyond the questions posed to him. He noted that LP’s administration of a
psychological test was valid and indicated that Applicant was honest, which implies that
he was inclined to be honest throughout his assessment with LP. (Tr. 115-118; AE G)
Dr. W’s conclusions are that Applicant has suffered from alcohol problems during
his adult life. He chose to discontinue alcohol use twice without obtaining the necessary
follow-up intervention for his addictive behavior. On this third attempt, he followed up with
the medical detoxification program with an acceptance of the AA program. Applicant has
fully accepted the full scope of the AA program. He does more than just document  his
attendance. He has a sponsor, has completed the 12-step program, and has volunteered
his service for the program. This indicates Applicant accepts his need for sobriety and is
not merely going through the motions to placate an outside authority. (Tr. 112-117; AE G)
Dr. W  noted  that   Applicant’s alcohol problem   is familiar in that many   individuals
with  alcohol problems repeatedly  deny  the  seriousness and  repeatedly  tell  themselves
they   can   manage   the   problem   on   their   own   without   a   treatment   program.   Applicant
believed  this  on  two  occasions following  his medical detoxification. He ultimately  arrived
at the  conclusion  that he  needed  help to  stay  sober,  and  he  could  not resolve  the  problem
on  his own  using  will  power  alone. Dr. W  noted  that in AA, the  final realization  that an
individual has an  alcohol problem  and  needs outside  help  occurs when  the  individual hits
“rock bottom.” In  Applicant’s case,  hitting  rock bottom  took the  form  of  his realization  that
he  was powerless over alcohol and  that every  medical detoxification  was just  going  to
lead to another medical detoxification  unless  he got help for his addiction. Dr. W  stated:
It  should be  noted  that  [Applicant]  has attained  his current stability  through
his  participation   in   AA.  Every   professional   alcohol  treatment  program,
whether residential or outpatient,  always concludes treatment with  a  referral
of  patients to  AA  for long  term, continuous follow  up. Although  [Applicant]
did not participate  in  a  residential  alcohol treatment program, his final step
towards recovery  by  attending  and  participating  in the  program  of  AA  fits
the  pattern of those  who  successfully  recover from  alcohol use  disorders.
(AE G)
Dr. W concluded in his report the following:
[Applicant]   is approaching   three   years of   sobriety   and   participation   in  the
program   of  AA.   To   a   great  degree   of  psychological  certainty,  I  consider
[Applicant]  to  be  fit to  continue  to  hold a  security  clearance  and  to  be  free
from  his former alcohol problem. (AE G)
Dr. W  testified  at Applicant’s hearing  and  reiterated  his prognosis and  conclusions.
He stated  that Applicant’s full  participation  in AA  is the  strongest predictor of  whether he
will  relapse. He noted  that LP  stated  that Applicant lacked  insight into  the  severity  of  his
condition. Dr. W  disagreed  stating,  if  that were  the  case, Applicant  would not be  attending
AA, have  a  sponsor, or continue  to  work the  12-step  program. LP  found  that  Applicant
had  an  unspecified  anxiety  disorder. Dr. W  found  that Applicant did  not have  an  anxiety
disorder;  rather his  past reflected  that  when he had  anxiety  he  turned to  alcohol. Anxiety
is a  contributing  factor with  anyone  who  abuses alcohol. People find  alcohol  diminishes
the   anxiety.  Applicant’s  participation   in AA   helps  him   handle  anxiety   and   gives  him   an
alternative approach. (Tr. 112-113, 121-128)
Applicant took two PETH tests to detect for alcohol consumption. Dr. W testified
that  PETH  is  a  test  that  is  required  by  many  professional  organizations  in  order  for  a
member to regain a professional license after having an alcohol-related incident. It is not
a conventional blood alcohol test, but one that looks for a metabolite for alcohol and it can
detect if a person had consumed any alcohol in the past month. Applicant took the tests
on September 2nd and 26th, 2022, and tested negative for alcohol on both. (Tr. 62-63;
118-121; AE E)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  falsified  material  facts  on  his  December  2017
security  clearance  application  (SCA).  Section  24  asked  if  he  sought  counseling  or
treatment  as  a  result  of  his  alcohol  use.  He  answered  “yes”  and  disclosed  his  2017
inpatient  treatment,  but  did  not  disclose  he  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  in  2013  for
complaints of anxiety and heavy drinking. (GE 1)
Applicant testified that he approached his 2013 detoxification as merely taking a
break from using alcohol. He explained that he rushed through the SCA and focused on
his  2017  treatment.  He  said  that  he  did  not  deliberately  attempt  to  deceive  the
government. Applicant said that in hindsight and now as a recovering alcohol, he would
consider his 2013 treatment as a significant event, but when he completed his 2017 SCA,
he did not focus on that event. He realized his error when it was brought to his attention
by the government investigator during a background interview in 2018. Applicant admitted
that his past alcohol abuse embarrassed him. Now that he has been an active member
in AA, he is no longer feels inhibited about discussing his past issues with alcohol. (Tr.
67-75, 90-98)
Applicant’s  AA  sponsor  (TH)  provided  a  letter  on  his  behalf.  He  met  Applicant
almost four years ago when Applicant began attending weekly AA meetings. It became
clear to TH that Applicant was serious about his sobriety and learning the AA program.
TH offered to guide him through the steps and work the program with him. TH stated that
Applicant was willing to do the work. They worked together after weekly meetings and
weekend  mornings.  They  completed  the  action  steps  of  the  program,  and  Applicant
continues  to  work the steps  that  require  ongoing efforts (Step 10  through  12). He  and
Applicant communicate regularly. TH stated: “Due to [Applicant’s] step work, consistent
meeting  attendance,  willingness,  and  honesty,  I  believe  [Applicant]  is  recovered  as
defined by the Big Book.” (AE I)
Applicant provided a character letter from JA. They have been friends for 35 years.
Applicant and JA were college roommates, and Applicant was in his wedding. JA is aware
of Applicant’s past struggles with alcohol and the SOR allegations. JA lived with Applicant
from  December  2020  to  March  2021.  He  stated  that  Applicant  did  not  consume  any
alcohol when they lived together. He described Applicant as a caring, giving, and honest
person.  Applicant  sticks  to  his  schedule  and  leads  a  healthy  lifestyle.  JA  believes
Applicant  did  the  right  thing  by  seeking  help  when  he  needed  it  and  noted  he  was
successful, which is the goal of treatment. He believes Applicant has overcome his past
issues. He described Applicant has an amazing man, friend, and a patriot. (AE A)
Applicant provided a character letter from JH, who has known him for 19 years. JH
has been Applicant’s direct and indirect supervisor, and they have shared an office. He
considers Applicant a responsible, honest, and reliable person. He is a professional and
works well with his customers. He completes his assignments in a timely manner. When
Applicant recognized he had a problem with alcohol, he sought help and there were never
any negative implications regarding his work. JH noted that Applicant has demonstrated
a  commitment  to  his  recovery  and  remaining  sober.  Applicant  reached  out  to  his
supervisors candidly explaining his struggles. JH believes Applicant can be trusted to hold
a security clearance. (Tr. 37-39; AE B)
Applicant provided a copy of his current performance evaluation from his employer.
He received marks of “meets expectations” and “exceeds expectations.” (Tr. 39-40; AE
J)

Applicant’s admissions and the record evidence support the SOR allegations.
In  Applicant’s  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  by  a  Government  investigator  in
September 2020, he stated that his financial difficulties arose while he was traveling for
his employer and he turned over his finances to a live-in girlfriend suffering from bipolar
disorder. He claimed that once he discovered the delinquent accounts, he terminated his
relationship and began making payments on his past-due accounts. Applicant stated his
intent to resolve all of his debts. He has not sought financial counseling.
In Applicant’s SCA, he noted that his financial problems began in January 2018.
He was warned by his company in April 2020 that he had unresolved debts. He stated
that  he  “did  some  research  and  figured  these  charges  were  due  to  my  ex.”  (SCA)  He
completed a financial interrogatory in June 2021 wherein he responded to each debt listed
in the SOR. (GE 6) With one exception, he admitted that each account was unpaid, with
no payment arrangements or payments applied. He did not attach any documents related
to the accounts except one. The exception was an account with a collection agent (SOR
¶ 1.d) that he noted was a duplicate of an account listed by the original creditor, but not
alleged  in  the  SOR.  As explained  below, the  collection  account  remains  unresolved.  He
also provided  a  portion  of a  checking  account  summary  in which he  claimed  that  he  had
cashier’s  checks   issued   to   unlisted   creditors   totaling   over  $10,000,  and   employer  pay
stubs   showing   regular  pay   in   February   2021,  and   overtime   wages  in  May   2021.  The
summary  is of  little value  as it does not list the  creditors to  whom  payments were made.
Finally,  he   provided  a  personal financial  statement  showing   no   payments  toward  SOR
debts, no  bank savings, $5,000  in investments,  and  a  car.  He has $300  in net  monthly
remainder after paying  monthly  expenses.  He  noted  that  he  is  working  overtime  in order
to pay a lump sum on the collection  account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, as noted  below.
In response to the FORM, Applicant supplied a document from the creditor that
appears  to  correspond  to  SOR  ¶  1.a,  a  credit-card  company  debt  for  $22,005.  The
document shows the account is cancelled with an outstanding balance of $21,443, with
partial payments  of  varying  amounts made  from  March  to  July  2022.  Applicant’s  2020
credit bureau report (CBR) shows the account was charged off in July 2020 and closed
by the credit grantor. (GE 4) Applicant’s March 2021 CBR shows the last activity on the
account in April 2018.
Applicant  also  supplied  a  document from  a  creditor that  appears to  correspond  to
SOR ¶  1.b,  a  charged-off  credit-card account  for approximately  $16,746.  The  document
is an  account statement from  June  2021  for an  account by  the  same  creditor but with  a
partial account number that does not match  the  account in SOR ¶  1.b, as supported  by
CBRs in the  record. Applicant’s March  2021  CBR shows the  last  activity  on  the  account
was in April  2018. The  statement shows a  zero  balance  on  a  closed  account with  the  last
payment  of $1,766.93  in June  2020.  Applicant  partially  redacted  the full  account  number
on the  document  he  submitted,  and  it does  little to mitigate SOR ¶  1.b  as  it is  impossible
to  determine, without more information, whether it is the  same  account as alleged  in the
SOR.
SOR ¶ 1.d – Collection account for approximately $10,502. In Applicant’s response
to financial interrogatories,  he noted that he had a payment plan for this account. The
document he sent to support the payment plan was an offer to repay the account to the
collection agent in two separate payment plans. He noted on the document that he has
saved $2,500 so far, and intends to save $6,000 to apply to one of the offered options;
however, no documentation of payment was offered. The account is not resolved.
No  other documents  were  submitted  regarding  efforts to  resolve  the  SOR  debts,
payment plans, or financial counseling. Applicant stated  in  his  response  to  interrogatories
that  his  debts arose  from  his former  girlfriend  not  paying  bills and  maximizing  charges on
his credit  cards  while  he  was traveling  for ten  months  for his company  (he  did not  disclose
the  dates of travel). He noted  that  he  was previously  debt free  with  a  good  credit score.
He reiterated  that  he  has paid  over $10,000  toward debts,  but  did not disclose  to  whom
the   payments   were  made.   He   takes  responsibility   for  the   debts   and   is   determined   to
resolve  them,  but 2021  was a difficult  year because  of his  mother’s relocation  to another
state.
Applicant  was  arrested,  charged,  and  convicted  of  DUI  in  2010  and  2018.  He
disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  he  was  found  guilty  of  misdemeanor  DUI  in  2010,  and  was
sentenced  to  three-years’  probation,  fined,  and  required  to  attend  three  months  of
classes.  He  noted  “everything  has  been  taken  care  of  and  resolved,”  and  that  he
completed alcohol classes in January 2011. (SCA, GE 8) In his PSI, he stated that the
2018 incident resulted from him driving after “drinking some beers.” He did not recall the
results of his blood alcohol test. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor (second degree) DUI,
and was sentenced to one-year probation, fined, and was to complete three months of
alcohol-abuse classes. He said he  completed  all  of  the  court’s requirements, including
completing the alcohol classes in January 2019. (SCA, GEs 7 and 8) He did not provide
documentary  information  on  the  status  of  his  probation,  the  type  or  frequency  of  the
alcohol  classes  he  attended  or  certifications  of  their  completion,  or  evidence  showing
completion of individual alcohol-related counseling or treatment program. Since 2018, he
continues to drink socially, about two drinks every two weeks.

"Applicant admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.b,  1.d,  2.a-2.g, and  the  cross-allegation  SOR ¶
3.a  with   some   explanations,   and   he   denied   SOR  ¶   1.c.  with   an   explanation.  His
admissions  and   other   comments  are  incorporated   into   the   findings  of   fact.   After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of the  pleadings and  exhibits submitted,  I make  the  following
additional findings of  fact.
Applicant  is  31  years  old.  He  has  been  working  full  time  as  an  independent
contractor for a federal contractor since March 2020. He is attending college part time.
He  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  2010  to  2018,  and  was  discharged  honorably  as  a
sergeant.  He  joined  the  Army  National  Guard  in  2018  and  received  a  General  Under
Honorable  Conditions  discharge  in  2019.  (Item  3  at  25.)  He  held  a  security  clearance
while on active duty. Applicant married in 2014 and separated in 2016. The child from the
marriage resides with his spouse. He is in the process of obtaining a divorce. (Item 3 at
28-29.)
The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent  debts  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  October
2020  (Item  4)  and  December  2021  (Item  5).  The  evidence  concerning  these  debts  is
summarized below.
Guideline F
SOR  ¶  1.a:  a  mortgage  that  is  past  due  for  $33,516.  The  mortgage  is  in  a
foreclosure status with a total loan balance of $179,566. Applicant disclosed the debt on
his SCA. In his answer to the SOR he cited his marital situation for why he could not make
the payments. He is attempting to sell the property to get it removed from his credit history.
(Item 4 at 1 and Item 5 at 6.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: a delinquent auto loan with a balance of $8,617. Applicant disclosed
the  debt  on  his  SCA.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  explained  the  car  started  having
problems, and when he and his spouse separated, he did not have the money to get it
fixed. The vehicle was repossessed. He states he intends to resolve the debt by the end
of the year. (Item 4 at 7, Item 5 at 2, and Item 10 at 7.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: account placed for collection of $448. Applicant denies this debt,
stating it was paid off when he left the military. His dispute is noted in his credit reports.
(Item 4 at 8 and Item 5 at 7.)
SOR ¶ 1.d: account charged off in the amount of $4,796. Applicant admits the
debt. He could not make the payments after he and his spouse separated. He states he
settled with the debt collections company. Applicant’s 2021  credit bureau  report shows
he settled the debt for a lesser amount. (Item 4 at 8 and Item 5 at 5.)
Applicant provided no documents regarding any payments towards or the current
status of  any of  his SOR  debts  with  his answer.  He  provided  no details  or documents
about his current financial situation.

Alcohol Consumption  and Criminal Conduct
The record contains evidence that from December 1999 to November 2016, the
police  arrested  Applicant  for  seven  DUIs,  two  alcohol-related  non-driving  criminal
offenses,  and  an  alcohol-related  probation  violation.  There  is  also  evidence  of  his
attendance  at  alcohol-related  classes,  counseling,  therapy,  and  a  12-step  treatment
program.
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in about December 1999, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He
pleaded guilty to DUI, and the court ordered him to pay a fine and court costs. (GE 2 at
34-35)
Applicant’s October 5, 2018 SCA indicates the police arrested him for DUI in about
August 2000. (GE 2 at 35-36) He pleaded guilty to DUI, and the court ordered him to pay
a fine and court costs. (GE 2 at 35-36) This DUI was not alleged in the SOR and will not
be considered for disqualification purposes.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges in about August 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with
DUI and fleeing or evading the police. He pleaded guilty to DUI, and the court ordered
him to pay a fine and court costs. (GE 2 at 36-37) The court placed him on probation for

SOR ¶ 1.e alleges in about September 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged
with DUI. He pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of failing to use due care when passing
a  stationary  emergency  vehicle.  (GE  2  at  28;  March  22,  2019  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) at 3, GE 3) The court sentenced

drove  away  from  the  boating  area, and  he  struck a  pole with  his vehicle.  (Tr. 53) This was
the  only  occasion  where his  DUI involved  his vehicle  being damaged  in  an  accident.  (Tr.
53) He did not remember his  breathalyzer test result. (March 22, 2019  OPM  PSI at 4, GE
3) He pleaded  guilty  to  a  lesser offense  of  operating  a  vehicle  while  visibly  impaired  (OWI),
and  the court sentenced him to  pay a  fine  and costs. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges in about November 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  Breaking  and  Entering,  Illegal  Entry,  and  Larceny.  Alcohol  was  a  factor  in  this
incident. (March 22, 2019 OPM PSI at 5, GE 3) He went to his girlfriend’s house, and a
window was open. (Tr. 39) He entered her house when she was not home, and he took
some gifts he made to her because he was upset that she was “cheating on him.” (Tr. 39)
He pleaded guilty to  Breaking  and  Entering  (illegal entry  without the  owner’s consent).
(GE 2 at 30) The court dismissed the larceny charge. (Id.) The court sentenced him to 24
months of probation, participation in a substance abuse program, 10 days of community

refused to leave; the hotel called the police; and the police arrested him. (Id.; GE 2 at 41)
Alcohol was a factor in this incident. He pleaded guilty to criminal trespass. (Id. at 32) The
court  sentenced  him  to  pay  a  fine  and  to  90  days  of  probation.  (Id.)  The  charge  was
dismissed after he completed probation. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges in about November 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  DUI.  Applicant’s  only  listed  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  result  of  .17  was  from  a
blood test for this DUI. (March 22, 2019 OPM PSI at 6; GE 3) His highest blood-alcohol
content in relation to his DUIs that he could remember was .17. (Tr. 52) He pleaded guilty
to misdemeanor OWI II. (GE 2 at 33) The court sentenced him to pay a fine, to 24 months
of  probation,  to  participation  in  a  substance  abuse  program,  and  to  random  alcohol
testing. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges in about October 2018, Applicant discontinued alcohol treatment
against  advice.  Applicant  attended  a  behavioral  health  outpatient  alcohol  treatment
program (BHOATP) for nine months. (GE 4 at 1) The SOR does not allege; however, that
the February 13, 2018 intake assessment form for the BHOATP says, “Client reports long
Hx  of  alcohol  dependence.  Reports  recent  alcohol  bender  over  the  weekend,  LDU
2/11/18.” (GE 4 at 2) The BHOATP intake form indicates he “lacks insight into problem”
and has low impulse control. (Id.) The BHOATP discharged him with a diagnosis of Axis
I  Alcohol  Dependence.  (Id.)  He  made  “fair  progress”  while  in  the  BHOATP.  (Id.)  The
clinical  recommendation  was  for  him  “to  consistently  attend  Outpatient  Treatment
(individual and group) for relapse prevention purposes and to continue to build a sober
support system.” (Id. at 8) Applicant believed he had received all of the value that he was
going to receive from BHOATP. (Tr. 41) He concluded his 12-step program was better
than BHOATP at meeting his needs. (Tr. 41) He said he attended the 12-step program
twice a week from 2018 to present. (Tr. 46)
SOR  ¶  2.a  cross-alleges  the  information  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and 1.c  under  the
criminal conduct guideline, and SOR ¶ 2.c cross alleges the information in SOR ¶¶ 1.e
through 1.j under the criminal conduct guideline.
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges in about November 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged
with Domestic Violence. Alcohol was not involved in the incident. (Tr. 29) Applicant and
his spouse had a verbal argument. (March 22, 2019 OPM PSI at 2; GE 3) She wanted to
call the police, and he would not let her use the phone. (Id.) He did not touch her or injure
her.  (Id.)  He  pleaded  guilty,  and  the  court  ordered  him  to  attend  anger  management
classes. (Id.) After completion of all sentencing requirements, the record was sealed and
expunged. (Tr. 29)
To summarize, from 1999 to November 2003, Applicant was arrested for four DUIs.
He consumed excessive amounts of alcohol for several years during this period because
of the stress and shock related to the end of his nine-year marriage in 1998. (Tr. 20, 30)
He did not have any problems with alcohol for eight years (2003-2011). He was always
alone in his vehicle when the police stopped him for DUIs. (Tr. 53)
Applicant  relapsed   in   2011   when   his  father  passed   away   and   due   to   a   toxic
romantic relationship.  (Tr. 20, 37) From  2011  to  2016, he  had  five  alcohol-related  arrests
and   an   alcohol-related   probation   violation.  (Tr.  38)  After  his  most  recent  DUI   arrest  in
2016, he  attended  several outpatient alcohol counseling  and  treatment programs. (Tr. 44-
45)  He   ended   the   toxic  relationship,   and   he   does  not   associate   with   the   people  who
consumed  alcohol with  him  during  the  2011  to  2016  time  period. (Tr. 20) The  police  have
not  arrested   him   since   2016.  (Tr.  20)  He  attends  faith-based   meetings  in  a   12-step
program,   which  is  similar  to   the   12-step   program   in  the   Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
program. (Tr. 21, 46-48) He accepted  that he is an alcoholic. (Tr. 21) He does not intend
to   consume   alcohol  in   the   future.  (Tr.  22)  He   denied   that  he   was  impaired   at  work  by
alcohol consumption. (Tr. 31, 53)
Applicant does not believe future incidents involving the police and courts will occur
because he admitted his problem with alcohol, and he took action to address it. (Tr. 23)
In 2003, and June 2007, he completed the ASAP training courses. (AE E) In April 2018,
he  successfully  completed  an  intensive  outpatient  treatment  program.  (GE  4  at  7)  He
denied any alcohol consumption after November of 2016. (Tr. 41; GE 2 at 42) He has a
healthier lifestyle. (Tr. 51) He watches what he eats and exercises. (Tr. 51) He promised
not to operate a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol. (Tr. 24; AE B) If he chooses to
consume alcohol in the future, he promised to consume alcohol in a responsible manner.
(AE B) He ended a stressful toxic romantic relationship, and he does not associate with
others who abuse alcohol. (Tr. 23) He has continued his sobriety, associates with others
who share his goal of sobriety, and he frequently attends his 12-step program. (Tr. 23;
GE 2 at 50; GE 3 at 2) He did not provide a statement from his sponsor or other attendees
of his 12-step program about his commitment to sobriety and his efforts to maintain his
sobriety.

to have a handgun in one’s automobile. He was unfamiliar with the gun laws of his new
state of residence when the arrest occurred. (Tr. 15)
In  December  2015,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while
intoxicated  (DWI)  and  failure  to  stop/elude  the  police.  (Answer  at  1)  The  failure  to
stop/elude the police charge was nolle prossed. (GE 10 at 7) He was found guilty of the
DWI  charge,  given  a  30-day suspended  jail sentence,  and  placed  on  probation for 12
months. As part of probation, his license was suspended and he had to attend an alcohol
safety program. Also, the court ordered the installation of an ignition lock on Applicant’s car
for six months. (Answer at 1)
In January 2016, while on probation, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.
Subsequently, he was found guilty and given  a one-year suspended jail sentence, two
years supervised probation,  fined $1,500, and ordered to attend six months of alcohol
counseling. (Answer at 2; GE 2 at 6) Applicant completed the requirements of probation.
(GE 2 at 7) Per the lead counselor of the alcohol program, Applicant “was an attentive and
active participant, and contributed with good thoughts in group session,” and it appeared
“that he ha[d] gained knowledge on the consequences of alcohol . . . in his life.” (GE 7 at 2)
Applicant  stopped  drinking  alcohol  after  this  most  recent  DUI  arrest,  and  continues  to
remain  sober.  (Tr.  28)  He  included  his  DUI  charges  on  his  2018  security  clearance
application, as required. (GE 1 at 34-37)
In April 2017, Applicant was issued a citation for violating the terms of parole by
attempting to drive on a suspended license. (GE 8 at 7) Applicant denies this allegation,
contending that his license was not suspended; rather, it was turned in to the motor vehicle
administration when he moved to another state and applied for a new license.  (Tr. 26)
Applicant did not provide any documentation in support of this contention. He was found
guilty.
In August 2019, Applicant was charged with displaying a registered plate issued for
another vehicle. He was found guilty and fined $70. (GE 9 at 19)
Applicant  completed   a   security   clearance   application   in  February   2018.   He
answered “no” to a question requiring  applicants  to  disclose  any  debts  that  were  more  than
120  days past due, as of  the  execution  date  of  the  security  clearance  application.  (GE  1  at
41)  When  Applicant completed  the  application, he  was more than  120  days  delinquent on
mortgage  payments for a  rental property  that he  owned. (Tr. 30) Specifically, Applicant
purchased  the  property  in 2000. (GE 2  at 6)  After he  left the  Army  and  joined  the  Air  Force
in 2003, Applicant moved, but kept the  property  to  rent out. (Tr. 21) In  approximately  2012,
the  tenant moved  out,  at or about the  time  Applicant’s wife  lost  her job. (Tr. 21; GE  4  at 3)
Unable to  find  another tenant and  unable to  pay  the  mortgage  without  receiving  rent  money
to  offset it, the  mortgage  became  delinquent.  Applicant knew  that  he  and  his  wife  had  been
struggling  to  make  mortgage  payments,  but “didn’t know  the  exact extent of  it,” as his wife
was handling  the  payments and  the  property  was located  in another state. (Tr. 32  - 33) At
the  time  of  the  foreclosure, payments  had  been  delinquent  for  approximately  six  years.  (GE
4 at 3)
By November 2019, the mortgage loan had been foreclosed upon, and the home
was sold at auction. (GE 5 at 1) Applicant owed no deficiency after the sale. (Tr. 35; GE 5
at 3)
Applicant is indebted on an auto loan account that was charged off in the amount of
$3,837.  He incurred this debt in 2018 when he took his car to an auto shop for repairs and
could not afford the repair cost. (Tr. 22, 38) Applicant disputed the repair cost amount to
the shop owner, and “they basically ended up selling the car at an auction.” (Tr. 38) The
auto lender received the proceeds of the sale. (Tr. 22)
Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  collection  agent  for  a  delinquent  phone  bill,  totaling
$1,182. Applicant denies the debt. (Answer at 2) He is working to remove it from his credit
report  with  the  help  of  a  credit  repair  company.  (Tr.  22)  He  provided  no  evidence
substantiating the basis of his denial.
Applicant earns $85,000 annually. (Tr. 46) He has $2,000 in savings. Applicant’s
adult children and his grandchild live in his home. He helps his children pay their college
tuition. (Tr. 40-41) According to his wife, he is “a strong and stable, husband, father, friend,
and  provider  who  has  always  worked  hard  to  make  sure  that  [his]  family  always  had
everything  that  [they]  needed  and  many  of  the  things  that  [they]  wanted.”  (AE  A  at  1)
Moreover,  he  has  “learned  from  his  mistakes  .  .  .,”  and  has  become  “an  even  better
person,” over the years. (AE A at 2)

"In  answering  the  original  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.g.  He
admitted the cross-allegation at SOR ¶ 2.a, but denied SOR ¶¶ 2.b through 2.e, as well
as  the  cross-allegation  at  SOR  ¶  3.a.  Each  of  his  answers  included  explanations.
Applicant’s SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  36  years  old.  His  only  marriage  (2013-2019)  ended  in  divorce.  He
has no children. He lives with his long-term girlfriend. He served in the U.S. Army from
2006 to 2014. His duties included a 17-month combat tour in Iraq (2008-2009), a one-
year deployment to Qatar (April 2010 to April 2011), and several months in Afghanistan
(2013).  He  held  a  clearance  in  the  Army,  first  granted  in  2007  and  then  granted  on  a
conditional  basis  in  2012.  Applicant  earned  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2017,  graduating
cum laude, and he earned a master’s degree  in  business administration  (MBA) in May
2021, with a 3.73 GPA. He has worked for a defense contractor as a research analyst
for about two years. (Answer; GE 1, AE D, AE H, AE I; Tr. 10, 22-33)
In  the  Army,  Applicant  was  awarded  three  Army  Commendation  Medals,  five
Army Achievement Medals, campaign medals for service in Afghanistan (one campaign
star)  and  Iraq  (two  campaign  stars),  the  Combat  Action  Badge,  and  other  appropriate
service  medals,  ribbons,  and  badges.  (AE  D;  AE  E)  He  received  a  general  discharge
under honorable conditions, following his 2013 alcohol-related offense discussed below.
He  has  a  70%  service-connected  disability  rating  from  the  Department  of  Veterans
Affairs, due to PTSD. (AE B, AE C)
Guidelines G  and J:
Applicant  has  a  history  of  alcohol-related  offenses,  from  2004  to  August  2021.
(GE 4 – 8; SOR Ex. 2) They are detailed as follows:
(1) In  December 2004,  around  Christmas, Applicant was arrested  and  charged  in
his home  state  (State  1) with  driving  under the  influence  of alcohol  (DUI) and  underage
possession  of  alcohol. At the  time, he was grieving  the  recent death of  his grandmother.
In   April 2005,   he   was convicted   of  both   offenses, placed  on  probation, and   ordered   to
attend  an  alcohol safety  awareness program. (ASAP)  (SOR ¶  1.a) He  initially  failed  to
complete   the   ASAP   program,  as  alleged,  because   he   had   difficulty   attending   daytime
ASAP  classes  without  reliable transporation. The  judge  gave  him  another chance, and
he  completed  the  classes. (Answer; GE  6; Tr. 83, 87-88, 90) There  is no  indication  that
his  probation   was  “revoked”  as  alleged,  particularly   in  August  2006   (as  alleged),  a
month   before  he   enlisted   in  the   Army.  Applicant  also   disclosed   the   offense   on   his
September 2006 SCA, prepared at the time. (GE 2)
(2) In  early  December 2009, Applicant was arrested  in  State  2  and  charged  with
DUI.   In   March  2010,   he   pleaded   guilty   to   a   lesser   charge   of  first-degree   negligent
driving. He was fined  about  $1,260  and  sentenced  to  90  days in jail, of  which all  but  five
days  were  suspended.  (SOR  ¶   1.b)  Three   months  before  the   arrest,   he   had   returned
stateside  from  a  lengthy  combat  tour in Iraq  and  had  difficulty  readjusting  due  to  PTSD.
He   testified   that  he   was  with   friends  in  a   large,  nearby   city.  He  was  pulled   over  after
getting  lost  on  the  drive  back to  post. He  was taken  into  custody  by  local police. He  did
not serve  time  in jail, but instead  was in a  work release  or weekend  program, which he
fulfilled   in   September  2010   (when   he   was  in   the   U.S.  for  a   court  hearing   for  his   next
offense, discussed below). (Answer; Tr. 88-92)
(3)  A   few   weeks  after  Offense   #   2,  in  late   December  2009,  Applicant  was
arrested  on  his home  U.S. Army  post  in State  2, and  charged  with  DUI.  (SOR ¶  1.c) He
testified  that  he  drove  a  fellow  soldier to  the  airport and  returned  to   post  in  the  friend’s
car. He had  been  drinking  earlier in the  day, and  stumbled  when  he  got out of  the  car at
the  post  gate.  (Tr. 92-94; GE  8, GE 9 at 1-19)
In  April  2010,  while  Applicant’s  offense  was  pending  in  federal  court,  a  federal
magistrate  judge  allowed  him  to  deploy  for  a  year  with  his  Army  unit  to  Qatar.  Since
alcohol use was not permitted there, Applicant could deploy and fulfill his court-ordered
abstention  requirement.  While
in  court-ordered
counseling, though he said it was not specifically “alcohol counseling.” (Tr. 82-83) (See
discussion of SOR ¶ 2.c, below)
in  Qatar,  he  also  participated
Applicant was subsequently evaluated and found to be chemically dependent on
alcohol  and  amenable  to  treatment.  (GE  5  at  2)  (This  diagnosis  is  referenced  in  a
September 2010 court order but is not itself documented in the record here). Relying on
this diagnosis, the federal magistrate authorized  Applicant’s placement into  a  five-year
deferred  prosecution  program.  Applicant  was  also  ordered  to  attend  and  successfully
complete a  two-year alcohol treatment program.  (SOR ¶ 1.d) (Answer; SOR Ex. 3;  Tr.
65-70, 95-96; GE 5 at 7, GE 8)
As part of the deferred prosecution program, Applicant was, in part, required: a)
to abstain from alcohol consumption; b) to comply with the law and not to “commit any
alcohol/drug offenses or other criminal offenses during the period of deferral;” and c) to
notify  U.S.  Probation  “within  72  hours  of  being  arrested,  questioned,  or  cited  by  law
enforcement.”  Failure  to  comply  was  potential  grounds  for  removal  from  the  deferred
prosecution  program.  (GE  5  at  8,  10)  Applicant  signed  the  judge’s  order  and  also
acknowledged the requirements of his probation. (GE 5 at 9, 10; Tr. 68-69)
Applicant  said he fulfilled the requirements of  his counseling in Qatar before he
returned to the U.S. in April 2011. (Tr. 68) He said he did not have contact with his U.S.
probation officer when he returned to this country. (Tr. 100) It is not clear that he fulfilled
the requirements of the “two-year treatment program” after he returned from Qatar.
(4)  In  September  2011,  months   after  he   returned   from   Qatar,  Applicant   was
arrested   in   State   1,  where  he   was  then   serving   in  the   Army,   and   charged   with   driving
while   intoxicated   (DWI),  2nd   Offense   within  5-10   years,  and   with   refusing   a   blood   or
breath test. In  February  2012, he  was found not guilty  on  both  counts  after a bench  trial.
(SOR  ¶   1.e)  Applicant   explained   that  he   was  stopped   by   a   police   officer  after  a   gas
station   attendant  reported   seeing   multiple   highly   intoxicated   individuals  exiting   a   red
SUV.   Applicant  said   he   was  driving   a   red   SUV  but  was  alone,  in military   uniform,  and
not intoxicated.  (Answer; GE  7 at 1-3;  Tr. 70-71, 96-100)
Applicant  acknowledged  under questioning that  he  knew and  understood at  the
time  that  he  had  been  arrested,  taken  into  custody  by  the  police,  taken  to  jail,  and
charged with DWI, even though he was later found not guilty at trial. He did not recall if
he had been drinking at the time.  (Tr. 96-100) He said he disclosed the offense to his
chain of command, but acknowledged that he did not inform his federal probation officer
of this arrest, and, in hindsight, said that he should have done so. (Tr. 71, 100, 103)
(5)  In   December  2013,  Applicant  was  arrested   on   an   Army   post   in   State   3   and
charged   with   drunk  driving.  He  had   a   blood-alcohol  content  (BAC)   of   0.187.  He
appeared  at  an  Article 15  hearing  and  was found  guilty  under Article  111  of  the  Uniform
Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ) of  being  in “Physical Control of  a  Vehicle  while  Drunk.”
(SOR  ¶   1.f)  (GE  8,   GE   9   at   21-30)  Applicant  asserted   that   when   he   was  arrested,  he
had   not   been   driving,  but  was  sitting   in  his  car  listening   to   music  (with   the   key   in  the
ignition  but the  engine  off). The  day  before, he  had  returned  from  a  combat deployment
to  Afghanistan. He  chose  to  accept the   Article 15  findings rather than  request a  court-
martial,   since   he   was   soon   to   leave   the   Army   and   pursue   an   education.   (Answer)   He
received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable conditions, as noted  above. (Tr. 30;  AE
D)
Applicant acknowledged that he had been drinking prior to this arrest, and that, in
hindsight,  he  should  not  have  done  so  under  the  terms  of  his  federal  deferred
prosecution following offense # 3.  (Tr. 71-73;  GE  5 at 10)) However, he  also asserted
that he believed his chain of command and security officials were aware of the offense.
(Tr. 101-102)
In October 2015, the federal magistrate judge dismissed the deferred prosecution
of  Applicant’s  December  2009  DUI  (Offense  #  2),  on  the  grounds  that  he  had
successfully completed  the program. (GE 5) (There  is no  indication  that the  court was
aware of either Offense #4 or Offense # 5, above).
(6)  In   January   2020,  Applicant  was  arrested   in  State   1   and   charged   with   DUI,
refusing  a  breath  sample,  and  drinking  while  driving  with  an  open  container of alcohol.
In  October 2020, he  was found  guilty  of  DUI.  He received  a  90-day  suspended  jail term,
two  years  of probation  and  a  fine. The  remaining  charges were dismissed.  (SOR ¶  1.g)
(GE  7)  Applicant  said   in  his  answer  that   he   was  returning   home   from   a   family   social
event,   and   was  stopped   because   he   did   not  have   his  headlights   on.  He  had   an   open
container  of   alcohol  in   the   vehicle.  He   attended   a   court-ordered   alcohol   treatment
assessment   and   six   weeks  of  counseling.  He  also   attended   voluntary   behavioral
counseling.  (Answer;  Tr.  82)   His  probation   for  this  offense   was  scheduled   to   end   in
October 2022. (Tr. 55, 117)
(7)   During   his direct  testimony   at his   DOHA  hearing, Applicant disclosed   that  in
August  2021,  he  was  arrested   in  State   4,  where  he   now   lives,   and   charged   with   DUI.
(SOR  ¶   1.h)  Applicant   said  he   had   been   at  home   and   had   “a  couple  drinks.”  He  had
been  doing  yard work and  left  the  house  to  get a  massage  for his back. He was pulled
over  for   speeding.  In   April  2022,  he   pleaded   guilty   to   DUI  and   was  sentenced   to   one
year  of   probation.  He   was  referred   to   a   substance   abuse   counselor   for  a   12-hour
course.  At  the   time   of   his  DOHA  hearing   he   had   attended   four  or  the   required   nine
sessions.  He is  required  to  call  in  weekly  and  to  provide  urine  samples as  needed.  He
has passed  them  all and has paid  all fines and fees.  He is required  to  remain  “clean  and
sober” and to obey the law. He has a probation officer. He remains on probation for the
offense until April 2023. (Tr. 35-36, 47-51, 81-82, 121-122)
Applicant acknowledged in his testimony that he had yet to report his latest DUI
to  his  State  1 probation  officer.  He  was  unclear as  to  the  terms  of that  probation, and
was not sure he was required to report the arrest when it occurred. His most recent DUI
was adjudicated only two weeks before his DOHA hearing, and he intended to disclose
the matter to his State 1 probation officer as soon as his DOHA hearing was concluded.
(Tr. 55-57, 117-120)
Applicant  was  sober  for  about  six  years  while  attending  college  after  the  Army
and  afterwards.  He  did  well  in  schoo  and  was  happier.  He  later  resumed  drinking,
believing he was mature and responsible enough to do so. (Tr. 84-85)
Applicant said he does not believe he has ever been diagnosed with alcoholism
or  alcohol  dependence  by  a  professional  counselor,  assessor,  or
treatment
professional.  (Tr.  111-112)  However,  the  federal  magistrate’s  2010  order  placing  him
into  the  deferred  prosecution  program  addresses  the  fact  that  Applicant  was  found
chemically  dependent  on  alcohol  in  an  assessment.  (GE  5)  That  assessment  is  not
alleged in the SOR, so I will not consider it as disqualifying conduct.
When  he  was  married,  Applicant  attended  counseling  through  the  VA  at  the
urging of  his wife, in about 2014, after he was  discharged from  the  Army.  He solicited
the VA for an assessment of his PTSD and was referred to a counselor. He also saw a
counselor twice in the summer of 2018. He has not been in treatment or counseling for
his  PTSD  since  then.  Applicant  acknowledged  a  “linkage”  between  his  alcohol  issues
and  his  PTSD,  noting  that  his  December  2009  DUIs  and  his  2013  DUI  all  occurred
shortly after he returned from deployments. (Tr. 75-79)
Following  his  2020  DUI,  Applicant  attended  voluntary  substance  abuse
counseling  with  Ms.  W  between  about  January  and  March  2021.  He  successfully
completed the program, which included five behavioral health education and counseling
sessions over six weeks. Further treatment was not recommended. (Tr. 56-61; SOR Ex.
1; AE A) (Applicant’s most recent DUI occurred five months later).
Applicant said he attempted sobriety after his 2020 arrest, but it was not until his
most  recent  arrest  that  he  “really  sat  down  and  talked  with  my  family  and  became
honest  with myself.  Everything  states that  I  have  an  addiction” to  alcohol. He believes
that  without  alcohol, he  would  have  had more  success  in  the military.  He  gets  a  lot of
support from his family and his girlfriend. He said this latest incident led to an “epiphany”
and he realized that he is battling addiction and alcoholism.  He said he has not had a
drink  since  his  latest  DUI,  in  August  2021.  He  sought  out  on-line  AA  meetings  soon
thereafter, including some with military veterans. He attends AA meetings several times
a  week.  This  is  voluntary and  not  court  ordered.  He  has  deep  regrets  that  his  alcohol
issues ended his Army career. He described  alcohol as “my  Achilles heel.” (Tr. 34-41,
80-86, 120-121)
Applicant  acknowledged  his  history of  alcohol  use  but  asserted  that  it  does  not
define who he is. He has excelled at many things, including in the Army, in leadership
courses as a  distinguished  graduate,  and  in  earning  a  bachelor’s degree  and  an  MBA
with honors and excellent grades. He is a hardworking, trusted employee with excellent
references  and  evaluations.  He  loves  his  job  and  values  the  opportunity  to  serve  the
military. He is now more accepting of his alcohol issues and continues to deal with his
service-connected  PTSD.  He  does  not  believe  he  is  a  risk  and  wants  to  continue  to
serve. (Tr. 44-47)
Guideline E
In  2012,  following  Applicant’s  first  four  offenses  above,  the  Army  CAF  granted
him  a  conditional clearance. The  CAF noted that  “failure to  successfully complete  your
probation  requirements  or  other  subsequent  unfavorable  information  may  result  in  the
suspension  of  your  clearance.”  The  CAF  noted  that,  at  the  time,  Applicant  was  in  the
five-year deferred prosecution program, following his second December 2009 DUI, GE
4 at 32)
In  SOR  ¶  2.e,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant’s  December  2013  DUI
arrest (Offense # 5) constituted a violation of both his federal probation and the terms of
his conditional clearance. Applicant denied SOR ¶ 2.e and asserted that his conduct did
not  violate  any  probation  requirements.  (Answer)  He  also  testified  that  DOD  took  no
action to revoke or suspend his conditional clearance following his arrests in either 2011
or  2013.  (Tr.  102-104)  During  closing  argument,  Department  Counsel  conceded  that
there  was  no  documentary  evidence  to  support  a  finding  that  SOR  ¶  2.e  was
established. Specifically, there was no record evidence that the federal magistrate judge
had ruled that Applicant had violated his probation following his December 2009 arrest.
Nor  was  there  evidence  to  show  that  the  DOD  CAF  had  ever  acted  upon  Applicant’s
2013 DUI offense (at least as to his 2012 conditional clearance). (Tr. 151-152)
Applicant first submitted an SCA in 2006, when he joined the Army. He disclosed
his December 2004 DUI arrest in detail. (GE 2 at 19-23; Tr. 73-75)
When  Applicant  submitted  his  December  2019  SCA,  he  disclosed  some  of  his
DUI  arrests,  but  not  all  of  them.  He  disclosed  offense  #s  1,  2,  and  5,  above,  but  not
offense #s 3 or 4 (GE 1 at 32-36). The Government alleged that these omissions were
deliberate falsifications, an allegation he denied. (SOR ¶ 2.a)
As  to  SOR  ¶  2.b,  the  SCA  question  at  issue  asks,  “Have  you  EVER  been
charged  with  an  offense  involving  alcohol or  drugs?”  Applicant  asserted  in his Answer
that  he  interpreted  the  question  as  requiring  disclosure  of  offenses  of  which  he  had
been  “convicted” rather than  “charged.” (Answer)  He testified that he also did not have
the proper paperwork with him when he completed the SCA. He  said he was confused
about whether he should report the second December 2009 offense (Offense # 3), since
it led to a deferred prosecution. He also said he paid for an online criminal background
check and it was not listed. (Tr. 106) He said he did not intend to hide anything from the
Government,  and  acknowledged  that his various offenses “tend  to  blend  together.”  He
knew,  however,  that  he  had  been  arrested  in  December  2009  on  a  federal  military
installation and appeared in federal court.  As to Offense # 4, he also asserted that he
did  not  have  to  list  the  2011  DUI  charge  in  State  1  since  he  was  found  not  guilty.  He
also said he regarded Offense # 3 in a similar fashion since he was placed in a deferred
prosecution program, and the charge was later dismissed. (Tr. 41-43, 64-65, 105-09)
Applicant  also  allegedly  failed  to  disclose  on  his  SCA  both  that  he  had  been
ordered  to  seek  counseling  or  treatment  as a  result  of  his  use  of  alcohol,  and  that  he
had  received  such  counseling  or  treatment,  as  ordered  by  the  federal  magistrate  in
September 2010. (GE 1 at 37; SOR ¶ 2.c) Applicant denied the allegation of deliberate
falsification.  He  said  he  had  monthly  monitoring  sessions  while  he  was  in  Qatar  (an
alcohol-free  country)  but  did  not  consider  that  to  be  sufficiently  related  to  alcohol
“counseling”  or  “treatment”  to  be  considered  reportable  within  the  context  of  the
question on his SCA. (Answer; Tr. 83-84, 109-111)
Even  so,  the  federal  magistrate’s  September  2010  order  states  that  Applicant
“shall  enroll
treatment  program”
recommended by the behavioral treatment agency evaluators who diagnosed Applicant
as having a chemical dependency on alcohol. (GE 5 at 7)

the
In  his  February  2020  interview,  Applicant  discussed  his  2004  charges,  his  first
December 2009 DUI arrest, by civilian authorities in State 2, and his 2013 DUI arrest on
the  Army  post  in  State  3  at  length.  (GE  3)  At  the  start  of  his  March  2020  interview,
Applicant was confronted with evidence of his second December 2009 DUI in State 2,
as well as evidence of his January 2020 DUI in State 1, which he failed to mention in his
first interview, in February 2020. (GE 3) In November 2020, Applicant authenticated and
adopted the summaries of both interviews without comment. (GE 3 at 14)
SOR  ¶  2.d  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  withheld  information  from  the
interviewer,  in  both  interviews,  about  the  fact  of  his  second  December  2009  DUI.  As
above,  he  continued  to  assert  that  he  had  not  been  convicted  in  the  latter  incident.
(Answer)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  the  interviewing  agent  confronted  him  with
evidence of the December 2009 DUI before he disclosed it. (Tr. 113-116)
Applicant also  did  not disclose  in  those  background  interviews that  he  had  been
arrested   for   DUI in   January   2020,   only   weeks before.   He   asserted  that   he  “didn’t think
about it. I  was just  being  reactionary  with  her. She  asked  the  question,  I answered  the
question.” He acknowledged  that,   in hindsight,  he  should have  been  more candid. (Tr.
61-64,  116) Deliberate   lack of candor in  Applicant’s February   2020   interview   about   his
January 2020 DUI was not alleged as part of  SOR ¶ 2.d.
Applicant’s  girlfriend  is trained  as  a  nurse.  She  testified  that  she  is  aware  of  all
aspects of his alcohol issues. He has been “very open” with her about them. He has not
had  a  drink  since  his  most  recent  DUI,  in  August  2021.  She  was  disappointed  and
shocked after that incident. She believes he made a mistake. He attends AA regularly,
several times a week, often twice a day. He is passionate about the meetings and they
are helpful to him. She believes he will continue with his sobriety long term. She does
not drink and they have no alcohol in their home. She believes his most recent DUI was
“the last straw” and that he “has his life in a new direction.” (Tr. 124-131)
Applicant’s witness, Mr. W, retired from the Army in early 2019 as a colonel (O-6)
after  30  years  on  active  duty.  He  has  had  a  clearance  for  many  years.  He  first  met
Applicant in 2012, when Mr. W. was Applicant’s battalion commander. Applicant served
as  a  supply  sergeant  and  they  worked  together  for  two  years.  Mr.  W  wrote
recommendation letters for Applicant for graduate school and followed his career. Now
employed by a defense contractor, Mr. W  hired Applicant  for his current job two years
ago. Applicant interfaces with two-star commands and is trusted to do so. Applicant has
integrity, honesty, an excellent work ethic and is  “mission-focused.” Mr. W.  is aware of
the  SOR  allegations  in  the  case.  (Tr.  131-144;  SOR  Ex.  4)  Mr.  W’s  evidence
corroborates Applicant’s recent performance evaluations. (AE F, AE G)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through
1.f,  1.h,  2.a,  and  2.b.  (HE  3)  He  denied  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  3.a.  He  also
provided  mitigating  information.  His  admissions  are  accepted  as  findings  of  fact.
Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  senior  field  engineer  who  concentrates  on  test
engineering  and  systems  integration.  (Tr.  6,  9-10,  53)  He  has  worked  for  his  current
employer since November of 2018. (Tr. 10, 53) His resume and performance overview
for 2021 provide additional details about his background and professional experiences.
(SOR response, Exhibit (Ex.) B, Ex. D) In 1999, he graduated from high school, and in
2008,  he  received  a  certification  in  aviation  maintenance  which  is  equivalent  to  an
associate’s degree. (Tr. 6-7, 45-47; GE  1; SOR response) He said he  needs to  complete
one  course to  receive  a  bachelor’s degree  in  aeronautics. (Tr. 7) His  resume  erroneously
indicates  he has  a  bachelor’s degree;  however, he may  be  able  to get a  diploma  if some
administrative  details are resolved  at his  university. (Tr. 48-49) He has never married, and
he does not have any children. (Tr. 9; GE  1 at 29)
In 2003, Applicant joined the Marine Corps. (Tr. 7, 49) He completed five years of
active duty service in the Marine Corps in April 2008, followed by one year in the inactive
Reserve, and he was in the Marine Corps Active Reserve from April 2009 to April 2012.
(Tr. 7, 50; GE 1 at 26) He served in Iraq from March to November 2004, and from May to
October 2005. (Tr. 8; AE A at 43) His active duty Marine Corps specialty was helicopter
mechanic. (Tr. 9) His Marine Corps Reserve specialty was intelligence imagery analyst.
(Tr. 9) His Marine Corps evaluations in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 indicated “One of the
many highly qualified professionals who form the majority of this grade.” (AE A at 87, 92,
97, 102, 107) He was a sergeant when he was discharged, and he received an honorable
discharge. (AE A at 4, 43, 103)
Applicant  received  the  following  Marine  Corps  awards:  Military  Outstanding
Volunteer Service Medal; Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal; Sea Service Deployment
Ribbon  with  1  Bronze  Star;  Global  War  on  Terrorism  Service  Medal;  Global  War  on
Terrorism  Expeditionary  Medal;  National  Defense  Service  Medal;  Certificate  of
Commendation; Iraq Campaign Medal with 1 Bronze Star; three Certificates of Training;
and Armed Forces Reserve Medal. (Tr. 8; AE A at 43, 67, 80-82) In November 2020, he
received a certificate of achievement from his employer. (SOR response, Ex. C)
Alcohol Consumption,  Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to the point of intoxication,
from  about  1998  to  at  least  September  2020.  In  his  SOR  response,  he  admitted  this
allegation. His April 7, 2021, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject
interview (PSI) indicates that during the period from 2008 to 2015, he consumed alcohol
on a near daily basis, and he drank to intoxication three to four times a week. (GE 3 at 1)
When he drank to intoxication, he consumed four or more beers or a bottle and a half of
wine. (Id.)
In his SOR response, Applicant said he reduced his alcohol consumption in 2016.
At his hearing, he said he did not consume alcohol during the week. (Tr. 29) He generally
limited  his  alcohol  consumption  to  a  drink  or  two  with  dinner.  (Tr.  29)  He  has  not
excessively  consumed  alcohol  since  December  15,  2021.  (Tr.  30;  SOR  response)  He
consumed alcohol excessively as a coping mechanism. (Tr. 32)
SOR ¶ 1.b  alleges in about  March 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged  with
driving  while  alcohol impaired  (DWI) and  careless driving.  He admitted  this allegation. (Tr.
31)  He   said  his  blood   alcohol  content  (BAC)   was  close   to   .08;  however,  he   did  not
remember the  specific BAC. (Tr. 67, 93; AE  B  at 9) He pleaded  guilty  to  a  lesser charge
than  the  DWI, and  the  careless driving  charge  was dismissed. (Tr. 31) The  offense  in  the
docket  is “unclassified  misdemeanor,” and  it  may  not be  an  alcohol-related  offense.  (AE
B at 9) He was sentenced to 12 months of probation, 24 hours of community service, and
a fine. (Tr. 31) He was under the age of 21 at the time of this offense.
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges in about September 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged
with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant was sitting in his vehicle when
he was arrested for DUI. (Tr. 33; GE 2 at 4-5) His girlfriend called the police and accused
him of stalking her. (Tr. 69) Prior to his arrest, he was drinking excessively in the aftermath
of the break up with his girlfriend. (Tr. 33) The BAC related to this arrest is unknown. In
April 2015, he was convicted of DUI and sentenced to 36 months of probation, 48 hours
in jail, to pay a fine, and to attend a 40-hour alcohol-awareness class. (Tr. 34, 69-70; AE
B at 47) He completed his sentence to jail and the alcohol-awareness class, and he paid
his fine. (Tr. 70) One of the conditions of his probation was to not commit any criminal
offenses, and to not operate a motor vehicle with any intoxicant in his body. (Tr. 71; AE
B at 46)
In  November  2016,  the  court  was  informed  that  Applicant  violated  probation  by
driving with alcohol in his system as set forth in SOR ¶ 1.e, infra. (AE B at 44) In November
2016, he was arraigned on the probation violation, and he received a fine of $1,666. (AE
B  at  43)  In  January  2017,  Applicant  was  tried  for  a  probation  violation,  and  he  was
sentenced  to  six  days  in  jail.  (AE  B  at  42-43)  In  April  2018,  his  probation  expired  by
operation of law, and the court noted all fines and fees were paid. (AE B at 42) It is unclear
from the record whether probation violations are considered separate convictions under
state law.
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges in about February 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  public  intoxication.  (GE  2  at  20-11)  Applicant  admitted this allegation.  (Tr. 34) He
was walking from a bar back to his hotel, and he said he slipped on some ice and fell. (Tr.
34; GE 2 at 2) There was no breathalyzer test. (Tr. 94) He was unsure about whether his
conviction was for an alcohol-related offense. (Tr. 92) He received a small fine from the
court. (Tr. 34; GE 2 at 2).
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges and Applicant admitted that in about July 2016, he was arrested
and charged with DUI. (Tr. 36; GE 2 at 9-10; SOR response) He refused a breathalyzer
and  blood-alcohol  test.  (Tr.  94)  He  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI,  and  he  received  a  deferred
sentence. (Tr. 36; GE 2 at 10)
SOR ¶  1.f  alleges that  in  about January  2017,  Applicant was arrested  and  charged
with  three  counts of  DUI.  He denied  that he  was charged  with  three  counts of  DUI.  (Tr.
37) He admitted  that  he  violated  the  terms of  his three-year probation, which was based
on  his SOR ¶  1.c September 2014  DUI offense, and  his probation  was revoked. (Tr. 37,
74-75) He served six  days in jail, and  he paid his fine. (Tr. 76-77) His probation “expired”
on April 21, 2018. (Tr. 37) His probation violation is resolved. (Tr. 78)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges Applicant admitted that he drove under the influence of alcohol
about  30  times.  He  denied  this  allegation.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant’s  April  7,  2021  OPM  PSI
indicates  “From  2008  until 2015,  subject  speculated  that  he  drove  under the  influence
about 30 times.” (GE 3 at 1) Applicant said he told the OPM investigator that he drank a
beer and then drove on multiple occasions; however, he did not believe he was under the
influence of alcohol when he was driving. (Tr. 37, 78-80)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges that in 2015, Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of having
a blackout. Applicant admitted the allegation. (Tr. 38; SOR response) Applicant’s April 7,
2021  OPM  PSI  indicates  “he  has  blacked  out  on  a  few  occasions;  he  was  not  more
specific. Subject last consumed alcohol to the point of having a blackout . . . in 2016.” (GE
3 at 2) At his hearing, he said he had not had a blackout. (Tr. 80, 97-98)
Applicant has never been hospitalized for alcohol consumption. (Tr. 80) He has
not attended any Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (Tr. 86) He denied that he had
been  ordered  to  seek alcohol-related  counseling.  (GE  1  at  43) He did  not  receive  any
recommendations for additional alcohol treatment after he completed the court-ordered
alcohol awareness class. (Tr. 86) He promised not to drive after consuming any alcohol.
(Tr. 37, 43) He promised not to excessively consume alcohol. (Tr. 43; SOR response, Ex.
A)
In  sum,  Applicant  has  five  alcohol-related  arrests  or  charges  and  about  three
alcohol-related  convictions.  (Tr.  91-92)  His  2003  DUI  arrest  resulted  in  an  unspecified
misdemeanor conviction, and his February 2015, public intoxication arrest may not have
resulted in an alcohol-related conviction. His 2017 alcohol-related charge was a probation
violation for his 2016 DUI arrest. Applicant believes he has been responsibly consuming
alcohol for several years. His current alcohol consumption is an occasional glass of wine
with dinner. (Tr. 86) He most recently drank three or four beers during a single day about
six days before his hearing. (Tr. 99)
SOR ¶ 2.a cross alleges that the information in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e under the
criminal conduct guideline.
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges in June 2016, a protective order was filed against  Applicant,
and in December 2019, three counts of violation of the protection order were filed against
Applicant. Applicant’s live-in girlfriend filed a protective order; however, after she filed it,
she and her daughter sent Applicant messages over the Internet. (Tr. 38-39) Applicant
responded to their messages in violation of the protection order. (Tr. 39) In his December
16, 2020 SCA, Applicant said that he was aware of two warrants issued in 2016 and 2017.
(GE 1 at 40) He said the warrants were for emails he sent in violation of the protection
order. In the SCA, he described his plans for resolution of the warrant as follows:
I’ve  recently  found  out  that [she]  had  previously  complained  that I violated
the  protective   order and   there   are  court   proceedings  regarding   this issue
. . . I  have  an  attorney  and  plan  to  fight  the  allegations. We  are  waiting  for
the  window  of  opportunity  to  address these  issues. COVID-19  has been  a
major inhibitor in being  able to  address these  issues faster. I  plan  on  visiting
[the city where the court is located] after Christmas and New Year break to
address the issue. (GE 1 at 39)
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  said  he  learned  about  the  arrest  warrant  during  the
security clearance process. (Tr. 82) The three counts are unresolved; however, Applicant
has a counsel who is helping him get the charges resolved. (Tr. 40) The bond is $8,000,
and Applicant is saving money for the bond. (Tr. 40; AE B at 2) There is a possibility the
bond might be waived or reduced. (Tr. 81) He intends to travel to the court where he has
an open warrant for violations of a protection order “as soon as possible.” (Tr. 101)  On
September 19, 2022, he promised to report to the court to address the charges in the next
calendar year. (AE B at 11)
SOR ¶ 3.a cross alleges the information in SOR ¶¶ 1 and 2 under the personal
conduct guideline.
Applicant is actively involved in his community. (Tr. 43) He does charity bike rides
and teaches yoga classes. (Tr. 43) He loves his work and his coworkers. (Tr. 43)
Financial Considerations-Federal Income  Tax Returns
In Applicant’s December 16, 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had not filed
his tax returns for TYs 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. (GE 1 at 46-47) He did not owe any
taxes.  (Id.) He  made  arrangements  to  file  these  tax  returns,  and  he  was  “honestly  not
aware that not filing was adverse information  as [he] had been letting the Government
keep some of [his] money.” (Id.)
In 2021, Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2016, 2017,
2018, 2019, and 2020. (Tr. 62-63; AE B at 33-37) His TY 2016 federal income tax return
is  dated  April  6,  2021.  (AE  B  at  34)  Most  of  the  other tax  documents  he  provided  are
undated and unsigned. (AE B at 33, 35-37) He filed the overdue tax returns before he
received  the  SOR  in  November  2021.  (Tr.  96)  He  was  traveling  frequently  for  his
employment, and he said his failure to timely file his tax returns was “neglectful.” (Tr. 96)
He did not owe any taxes. (Tr. 62)
Credibility Issues
Applicant’s  resume  submitted  as  Exhibit  D  to  his  SOR  response  indicates  he
received a “BS” in aeronautical science in July 2014. In his December 16, 2020 SCA, he
indicated he attended a university from May 2011 to October 2014 (Estimated); however,
he did not receive a degree in aeronautical science. (GE 1 at 14) At his hearing, he said
he does not have a bachelor of science degree. (Tr. 48-49)
In Applicant’s December 2016 SCA,  Applicant said he had only two DUIs, which
were  in  September  2014  (Estimated)  and  July  2016  (Estimated).  (GE  1  at  43)  At  his
hearing,  he  said  he  failed  to  disclose  his  2003  DUI  on  his  December  16,  2020  SCA
because it was disclosed on previous SCAs. (Tr. 87) He said he unintentionally failed to
disclose his February 2015 public intoxication arrest. (Tr. 87-90)
",True
"Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d, 2.a, 2.b, and 3.a. He
denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 2.c through 2.e. His admissions are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old. He served on active duty in the Army from 2002 until he
was honorably discharged in 2009. He has served in the Army National Guard since 2010.
He married in 2016 and does not have children. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2020.
Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in April
2009. He pleaded guilty and was fined. He was ordered by his command to attend an
alcohol education class.
In  April  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  possession  of  alcohol  and  careless
driving. Apparently, he was arrested in a dry county and a bottle of whiskey was found
open  in  his  vehicle.  He  paid  a  fine  for  the  possession  charge,  pleaded  guilty  to  the
careless driving charge, and paid another fine. (Item 6)
In April 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence
of alcohol (DUI). He pleaded guilty and received a fine.
In  September 2019,  Applicant was arrested  and  charged  with  DUI.  He was given
a  breathalyzer and  recorded  a  .17% alcohol reading. He was represented  by  an  attorney
who   requested   a   continuance   for  his  trial  because   he   was  on   military   orders.  He  was
granted  the  continuance  until April 6, 2021. He failed  to  appear for  his trial on  that date.
He was found  guilty  in  absence, charged  with  contempt of  court for failing  to  appear for
trial, and  issued  a  bench  warrant.  As of  the  date  of  the  SOR, the  bench  warrant remained
active. In  his answer to  the  SOR, Applicant admitted  the  facts,  stated  he  had  a  lawyer
and  offered  no  other information.  In  his response  to  the  FORM, he  provided  a  receipt  to
show  he paid  a  fine  associated  with  a  sentence  for  the  offense  of DUI 2nd  offense  on  the
alleged  dated,  and  he  was participating  in  an  alcohol substance  course for the  next four
weeks. (Item  1)
In November 2020, Applicant completed a security clearance application  (SCA).
Section 22-Police Record of the SCA, asked Applicant if in the past seven years he had
been  issued  a  summons,  citation,  or  ticket  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal proceeding
against him; if in the last seven years if he had been arrested by any police officer, sheriff,
marshal or any other type of law enforcement official; in the last seven years if he had
been charged, convicted, or sentenced to a crime in any court; and in the last seven years
if  he  had  been  or  was  currently  on  probation  or  parole.  Applicant  answered  no  to  the
above  questions  and  did  not  disclose  his  April  2014  charge  for  careless  driving  and
possession of alcohol; his April 2015 arrest, charge, and conviction of DUI, to which he
pleaded  guilty;  and  his  September  2019  arrest  and  charge  for  DUI,  contempt  of  court
charge for failing to appear, and his bench warrant, which were pending at the time. (SOR
¶ 1.c)
Applicant’s SCA also asked under Section 22-Police Record, if other than offenses
already listed, if he EVER had been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs.
He  answered  no and failed  to disclose  those offenses  listed  above  and his April 2009
DWI conviction. (SOR ¶ 1.d)
In December 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He
was  asked  if  he  had  ever  been  arrested,  charged,  or  convicted  of  any  alcohol-related
offenses. He disclosed to the investigator that he had been arrested twice for DWI: 2009
and 2015. He disclosed to the investigator that he was arrested in April 2009 after drinking
at a pool hall. He was stopped by the police, failed a field sobriety test, and placed under
arrest for DWI. He was given a breathalyzer test and was over the legal limit. He plead
guilty to DWI in court and was ordered to pay a fine. (Item 3)
Applicant also disclosed to the investigator during his December 2020 interview
that  in  April  2015  he  was  driving  and  came  upon  a  DUI  checkpoint.  He  had  an  open
container of alcohol in his vehicle. Applicant said he passed both the field sobriety and
breathalyzer tests. He could not recall what he was initially charged with. He could not
recall going to court. He possibly recalled receiving a letter from the court ordering him to
pay a fine and attend an alcohol education class. Documents from the FBI database and
state court records reflect Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI in April 2015 and
was found guilty of DUI and fined. (Items 4-5)
Applicant’s  explanation  to  the  investigator  for  failing  to  disclose  the  required
information on his SCA that specifically asked about his past arrests and those for alcohol-
related incidents was that he misread the question regarding alcohol-related arrests and
thought the question was referring to felony offenses only. Applicant did not disclose to
the investigator during this interview that he had been arrested in April 2014 and charged
with  possession  of  alcohol and  careless  driving,  and  his most  recent  September 2019
arrest and charge for DUI. (Item 3)
In  February  2021,  Applicant  was  interviewed  a  second  time  by  a  government
investigator. He told the investigator that he failed to disclose his alcohol-related arrests
due  to  overlooking  the  alcohol-related  questions  on  his  SCA.  He  said  he  was  not
intentionally trying to conceal his alcohol-related arrests. No explanation was provided as
to  why  he  did  not  disclose  his  April  2014  and  September  2019  arrests  during  his  first
interview. He disclosed that he had obtained an attorney and pleaded not guilty to the
September 2019 charge and the case was pending. (Item 3)
In April 2019, Applicant was accused of shoplifting at a big box store. During the
February 2021 interview, he told the investigator that he was at a big box store and had
purchased  groceries  totaling  about  $200,  which  included  a  bag  of  shrimp  and  some
steaks. After paying for the groceries, he was stopped by the loss prevention employee
and asked to come to the office. Applicant said he was informed by the employee that he
had two steaks and a bag of shrimp that he did not register at the checkout. He questioned
the employee about why he would purchase $200 worth of groceries and not pay for the
steak and shrimp that cost about $20. He was released and informed his name would be
entered into the store’s database and if  a similar incident occurred again, he would be
arrested. (Item 3)
The SOR (¶ 2.c) alleged Applicant deliberately failed to disclose on his SCA his
April 2014, April 2015 and September 2019 arrests. In his answer to the SOR, he stated,
“I  deny.  I  did  not  fully  read  the  question,  upon  being  asked  I  answered  honestly  and
truthfully.”  (Item  1)  The  SOR  also  alleged  (¶  2.d)  that  in  his  SCA,  Applicant  was
specifically  asked  about  alcohol-related  offenses  and  he  denied  ever  having  been
arrested  or  charged  with  any.  Applicant  denied  this  allegation.  The  SOR  alleged  he
falsified  material  facts  when  he  was  questioned  by  the  government  investigator  in
December 2020 about alcohol-related offenses and failed to disclose his April 2014 and
September 2019 offenses (SOR ¶ 2.e). Applicant’s SOR answer stated: “I misunderstood
the question but when asked an answer was given.” (Item 2)
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he provided a receipt from July 2022 to show
he completed a payment towards a fine associated with his September 2019 DUI offense.
The receipt reflects that the DUI is a second offense. No other information was provided
regarding this charge, the sentence, and whether he is on probation. He stated that he
was “doing an alcohol substance” that required him to attend weekly for four weeks. He
also stated, “I admitted to what I have done but I did misread the questions.” (AE A)
I find Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on his SCA when he failed to
disclose any of his arrests. The SCA asked if he had any arrests in the past seven years.
He answered no. It asked if he had EVER had any alcohol-related arrests, charges, or
convictions. He answered no. In December 2020, he was questioned by a government
investigator, and when asked if he had any alcohol-related arrests, he disclosed two and
did not disclose his most recent DUI arrest of September 2019, which was pending, and
his 2014 arrest. He did not disclose these previously because he thought he only had to
disclose  felonies.  I  do  not  believe  he  misread  the  SCA  or  overlooked  the  questions
because  when  he  had an  opportunity to  disclose  all of  his past  alcohol-related  arrests
during his first interview, he failed to do so. At that point, he was on notice to report all
criminal and alcohol-related offenses and he did not. It was only after the investigator did
a second interview that he disclosed his 2014 and 2019 arrests. His explanations are not
believable. (Item 3)

"Due   to   extensive   changes   to   the   original  SOR,  I  had   Applicant  confirm   at  the
hearing   her  admission   or  denial   to   the   remaining   SOR  allegations   alleged   under
Guidelines  J, G, F, and  E. She  admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.d,  1.f,  1.g, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o,  1.t, 1.u,
1.y, 1.aa, 1.bb, 3.a  through  3.j, and  4.c.  She  denied   SOR ¶¶  1.l,  1.q, 1.v, 2.a, 3.k,  and
3.l. SOR ¶¶  1.b, 1.c,  1.e,  1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.p, 1.r, 1.s,  1.w, 1.x, 1.z, 4.a, and  4.b  were
withdrawn.  SOR  ¶¶   1.aa,  and   1.bb   were  added   to   the   SOR.   Having   thoroughly
considered   the   evidence   in  the   record,  including   Applicant's  admissions,  I  make   the
following findings of  fact:  (Tr. 7-8, 11-14)
Applicant is 40 years old. She recently married in September 2022, and she has
two  daughters,  ages  14  and  16,  from  a  previous  relationship.  She  receives  $200
monthly in child support. She earned an associate’s degree in 2006. She began working
for  her  current  employer  in  November  2018.  She  started  out  as  a  customer  service
representative, and in 2021, she was promoted to a clinical support coordinator position
with  a  pay  increase.  Her  employer  requires  her  to  be  cleared  for  a  position  of  trust  to
perform specific employment duties. (GE 1; Tr. 27-30, 69)
The  SOR  alleged  approximately  25  incidents  of  criminal  conduct  and  rule
violations under Guideline J, as follows:
During the hearing, SOR ¶ 1.a. was determined to be a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.aa.
It alleged an incorrect date of the same offense. (Tr. 30-33, 62-65; GE 1) The allegation
in SOR ¶ 1.a is mitigated.
Applicant was arrested in 2012 and again in 2017, for operating a motor vehicle
while under the influence of alcohol. (SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 1.u, and 1.aa.) She was found guilty
of both offenses, and she was required to go to an alcohol education class for the first
conviction,  and  a  multiple  offender  class  for  her  second  conviction.  Both  sentences
included a requirement that she install an interlock device on her car for one year, and
the court also restricted her driving privileges for one year. Applicant served five days in
jail for her second conviction. (Tr. 30-33, 51-58, 62-65; GE 2, GE 3, GE 8; AE A)
Applicant was arrested for disorderly conduct in 2013, 2014, 2015, and in 2018.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.m, and 1.y) She admitted these offenses and acknowledged she had
been drinking alcohol during some of these incidents, but she could not recall how much
alcohol. The SOR alleged two other incidents of  disorderly conduct in 2015 and 2017,
which  Applicant  denied,  and  she  provided  documentation  that  she  was  actually  the
“victim” in one of the disorderly conduct incidents. There was no evidence to support the
other denied allegation.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.v) She admitted  that most of her disorderly
conduct  issues  stemmed  from  domestic  disputes  and  her  involvement  in  arguments
inside various bars. (Tr. 33-40, 43-47, 58- GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, GE 6, GE 7; AE A)
Applicant  was  cited  in  2014  for  being  a  passenger  in  a  motor  vehicle  with  an
open container. She was cited in 2015 for violation of a recreational fire pit regulation. In
July 2015, a warrant for her arrest was issued due to an unpaid fine. (SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.n,
and  1.o)  Applicant  admitted  these  offenses.  She  explained  that  she  frequently  had
bonfires in her backyard. The police requested she put out the fire because she did not
have a fire permit. She used a garden hose to put out the fire. She was later cited by
police  because  the  fire  re-started.  She  also  explained  that  she  forgot  to  pay  a  fine.
When she found out that a warrant had been issued, she immediately paid the fine. She
denied  that  she  had  been  issued  a  citation  for  speeding  in  December  2015,  and  the
Government  was  unable  to  provide  evidence  to  support  the  SOR  allegation.  (SOR  ¶
1.q.) (Tr. 40-43, 47-51; GE 5; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.bb alleges that between March 2011 to September 2015, Applicant was
charged  on  13  occasions  with  operating  a  motor  vehicle  without  proof  of  insurance,
and/or operating a motor vehicle after license or registration was suspended or revoked.
Applicant admitted these allegations. She could not remember all of the details, but she
admitted  during  that  time  period,  she  could  not  afford  car  insurance,  and  she  was
immature and irresponsible. (Tr. 65-69; GE 9; AE A)
Paragraph  2  of  the  SOR  (Guideline  G  - Alcohol  Consumption)  cross-alleged
Applicant’s  2012  and  2017  arrests  for  operating  a  motor  vehicle  while  under  the
influence of alcohol. There is no new information cited under this Guideline. During the
hearing, Applicant stated she has taken steps to improve her quality of life. She moved
to  a  different  part  of  town,  and  no  longer  associates  with  her  old  friends.  She  rarely
drinks  alcohol  anymore,  and  her  spouse  does  not  drink  at  all.  At  the  most,  she  may
drink one or two beers twice a month. She rarely goes out and she is very busy with her
daughters’  after  school  activities.  Most  importantly,  she  has  matured  and  considers
herself a responsible adult. She has not been in any trouble since starting her job in late
2018. (Tr. 77-80, 82-84)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged 12 delinquent accounts totaling $42,268, as
follows:
SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.j  allege  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education in the amount of $40,443 for ten unpaid student loans that had been referred
for  collection.  She  admitted  these  debts.  She  obtained  these  student  loans  to  pay  for
her  college  education.  After  graduation,  her  loans  were  placed  in  forbearance.  Once
she  was  employed  in  November 2018,  she  called  the  student  loan  creditor to  arrange
payments  to  be  deducted  directly  from  her  paycheck.  She  provided  documentation
which showed that beginning in June 2019, she had approximately $150 deducted from
each  paycheck  to  pay  her  student  loans.  In  March  2020,  the  payroll  deductions
automatically stopped due to the COVID-19 emergency relief for federal student loans.
The  student  loan  payment  pause  was  extended  through  December  31,  2022.  It  is
Applicant’s intention  to  resume  her student loan  payments beginning in January 2023.
She also stated that she has never had a tax refund intercepted due to non-payment of
student loans, and she always files her income tax returns on a timely basis. (Tr. 69-71,
75; AE D, AE E)
SOR ¶ 3.k alleges that Applicant is indebted to a cellular phone service account
that  was  referred  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  about  $1,600.  She  disputed  this  debt
because it was an account that belonged to her ex-boyfriend. She believed this account
was  successfully  disputed  because  this  account  is  no  longer  on  her  credit  report.  (Tr.
72; GE 10, GE 11)
SOR  ¶  3.l  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  childcare  facility  account  that
was referred for collection in the amount of about $225. She disputed this debt because
at the time she was receiving support from the county to pay for her childcare expenses.
(Tr. 72; GE 10, GE 11)
Applicant  explained  that  she  developed  financial  issues  due  to  unemployment,
underemployment,  and  a  lack  of  maturity.  She  is  now  current  on  all  of  her  financial
accounts  and  denied  that  she  had  developed  any  new delinquent  debts.  She  has  two
more  car  loan  payments  before  her  car  loan  is  paid  in  full.  She  provided  a  personal
financial  statement  which  reflected  a  monthly  net  income  (including  the  $200  child
support) of approximately $2,700. She  is the only source of  income for the family. Her
spouse  was  employed  by  a  temp  agency,  but  his  work  assignment  was  recently
completed.  He  is  currently  unemployed,  and  he  is  not  receiving  any  unemployment
benefits while looking for another job. She is able to support the family with her income.
After  paying  their  monthly expenses,  she  has  a  net  remainder  of  approximately $800.
She  has  never  participated  in  a  consumer  counseling  program,  but  she  does  receive
assistance from her mom when she has any financial questions. (Tr. 72-74, 76, 85; AE
B, AE C)
Paragraph  4  of  the  SOR  (Guideline  E  –  Personal  Conduct)  cross-alleged
Applicant’s arrests and citations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). There is no new
information cited under this Guideline.
",True
"In  her  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  admitted  the  factual  allegations  in
Paragraphs  1.a.,  1.c.,  and  2.b.~2.d.  of  the  SOR,  with  explanations.  She  denied  the
factual  allegations  in  Paragraphs  1.b.  and  3.b.  Applicant failed  to either admit  or deny
Paragraphs  2.a.  and  3.a.  She  also  provided  additional  information  to  support  her
request for eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant  is  35  years  old,  unmarried,  and  has  a  14-year-old  child.  (Item  3  at
pages 7, and 26~27.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption, Guideline J: Criminal Conduct & Guideline E:
Personal Conduct
1.a.,   2.a.,   and   3.a.  In  October  of  2016,  Applicant  admits  that  she  was  charged
with,  and  subsequently  convicted  of,  Driving  While  Intoxicated  (DWI).  She  was
incarcerated  for  ten  days,  placed  on  probation  for  two  years,  and  her  license  was
restricted for 12 months. Her restriction, in part, required the use of an Ignition Interlock
System,  of  which  Applicant  claims  she  was  unaware.  This  restriction  is  evidenced  by
court records. (Item 4 at page 2.)
1.b.,   2.a.,   and   3.a.  About   11   months  later,   in   September  2017,  Applicant  was
charged   with   and   convicted   of:  Refusal  of  Breath   Test  –  2nd  Offense,  Operating   a
Vehicle   on   a   Suspended   or  Revoked   License,  and   Operating   a   Vehicle   Without  an
Ignition   Interlock   System.   (Item   4   at   pages  7~16.)   She   was  incarcerated   for  ten   days,
and placed on probation  for three years.
1.c., 2.a.,  and  3.a. About six months later, in March 2018, Applicant admits that
she  was  charged  with  and  convicted  of  Operating  a  Vehicle  on  a  Suspended  or

"In  Applicant’s  answers,  she  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  with  some
explanation.  The  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  57  years  old.  She  recently  married  in  March  2022,  for  the  second
time. She has three adult children from her first marriage. He has worked for her current
defense contractor-employer since 2011. She is a high school graduate. (Tr. 6, 23-27;
GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant was charged with driving  while intoxicated (DWI) on
three occasions: February 2018, February 2014, and December 2004. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c)
Her  DWI arrests  were  also alleged as  criminal conduct  under Guideline  J in the SOR.
(SOR ¶ 2.a)
Applicant completed her 2018 security clearance in January 2018. Her February
2018  DWI  charge  occurred  after  she  spent  the  evening  at  a  girlfriend’s  house  and
consumed  “quite  a  few”  glasses  of  wine.  Several  circumstances  were  going  on  in  her
life at the time that caused her emotional strain. He mother had recently passed away
and she and her then-boyfriend (current husband) were caring for his dementia-stricken
mother. She testified that she “just got drunk” that evening. She decided to drive home
from  the  friend’s  house  and  she  was  stopped  by  law  enforcement.  Court  records
indicate that her blood alcohol content (BAC) was .15, almost twice the legal limit of .08.
She  was arrested  and  spent the  night in jail. She  ultimately  pleaded  guilty  and  received
a   sentence   that  included   probation,  installation   of   an   interlock  device  on   her  car,  and
required  attendance  at  an  alcohol counseling  course.  The  course  required  three-times-
a-week  attendance,  but  she   could   not  recall   the   duration   of  it.   She   also  attended
Alcoholics Anonymous  (AA) during  this time. The  record is unclear if  her AA  attendance
was  mandated   by   the   court.  She   was  given   the   opportunity   post-hearing   to   provide
documentation   about  her  counseling,  which  she   claimed   to   have,  but  she   failed   to   do
so.  (Tr. 27-28, 30-36; GE 3, 5)
Applicant’s February 2014 DWI charge occurred after she spent the evening at a
friend’s house and claimed she drank two beers before driving home. She was stopped
by  law  enforcement  for  having  a  non-operable  license-plate  light.  She  performed  field
sobriety  tests  but  refused  breath  and  blood  testing.  She  was  charged  with  DWI.  The
final disposition was a reduction of the charge to obstruction of a highway. Her sentence
included 14 months of community service and a fine. (Tr. 43-45; GE 3-4)
Applicant’s July 2004  DWI  charge  occurred  when  she  decided  to  drive  from  her
home  to  get  some  food  after  she  had  been  drinking  alcohol.  It  was  raining  during  her
drive and she lost control of her car when rounding a corner. She was alone in the car.
Applicant does not recall the details of what happened next after the accident. She was
hospitalized and treated. Later, she became aware that she was charged with DWI. The
charge  was  ultimately dismissed,  but  the  record  does  not  explain  why.  In  her  security
clearance  applications,  she  indicated  she  sought  alcohol  treatment  or  counseling  for
one month in 2004. She provided no further details about this counseling. (GE 1-4)
Applicant  testified  that  she  continues  to  drink  alcohol  to  include  drinking  to
intoxication  four  to  six  times  a  month.  She  claimed  she  last  drank  to  intoxication  in
December 2021. She also claimed that she no longer drives after drinking alcohol and
she  has  not  done  so  since  her 2018  arrest.  She  believes  that  she  is an  alcoholic,  but
she also believes  she does not  have  a  current  alcohol problem.  She  last  attended AA
over  a  year  ago.  She  has  not  attended  any  other  alcohol  treatment  or  counseling
program  since  her  court-ordered  counseling  after  her  2018  arrest.  She  realizes  she
made mistakes and she is sorry for them. (Tr. 37-41, 47)

"As amended, the SOR alleges that: from 1988 to about March 2020, Applicant has
consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication (SOR ¶ 1.a); in about
October  2014,  he  was  charged  with  intoxicated  endangerment/unattended  child  under
eight  years  old  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  in  November  2018,  he  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol
dependency in partial remission (SOR ¶ 1.c); and in December 2018, he was diagnosed
with alcohol use disorder (SOR ¶ 2.d).
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  of  the  allegations,  corrected
some  timelines,  and  provided  information  in  explanation  and  mitigation.  I  have
incorporated his admissions into my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 52-year-old engineering technician employed by a federal contractor
and is seeking to retain his clearance eligibility. He graduated from high school in 1988,
and  completed  some  technical  courses.  He  has  a  36-year  career  supporting  the  U.S.
Navy in different capacities. After high school, he worked for a federal contractor for 15
years  and  he  has  held  a  position  of  trust  since  2002.  He  has  worked  for  his  current
employer and security clearance sponsor since 2004. (Tr. 15) He feels honored he was
granted clearance eligibility, would like to continue his career supporting the U.S. Navy,
and hopes to retire in the future.
Applicant married in 2010 and divorced in March 2017. He has an 11-year-old son
of  this  marriage.  He  remarried  in  November  2019.  He  and  his  second  wife  share  a
stepson, age, 9, and have a 2-year-old son together. His elder son lives with  the boy’s
mother. (Tr. 16 -17)
Concerning his alcohol consumption,  Applicant testified that from about 1988 to
about  1992,  he  consumed  alcohol,  at  times  in  excess  and  to  the  point  of  intoxication.
From  about  1993  to  about  2008,  he  rarely  consumed  alcohol  and  never  to  excess  or
intoxication.  From  about  2009  to  about  2013,  he  consumed  alcohol  socially,  with  few
times to excess or intoxication. During the period of 2014 to June 2017, Applicant went
through what he described was an extremely rough time in his prior marriage, including
a separation that culminated in divorce. During this period, he consumed alcohol at times
in excess and to the point of intoxication. (SOR answer)
Applicant attended Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) meetings with his first AA sponsor
periodically between 2014 and July 2020. He had some success with lengthy periods of
sustained sobriety. He believes he has learned from his mistakes and has not had any
alcohol since July 2020. (Tr. 18; AE A) He attributes his success abstaining from alcohol
to attending weekly AA meetings and starting his new AA Big Book Step Study  with a
new  sponsor.  His  new  sponsor  has  taken  him  through  the  12  Steps  of  Recovery.  He
considers  himself  a  recovered  alcoholic  and  has  no  intentions  of  consuming  alcohol
again.  He  is  committed  to  making  responsible  decisions  for  himself  and  his  family,
including refraining from the use of alcohol. He stated that he is attending AA meetings
every week.
In October 2014, during his first marriage and prior to his entry into AA, Applicant
attended a family function and had “a few” drinks of alcohol. On his way home, his child
fell sleep in the car and he stopped at a store allegedly to buy food, leaving the child alone
in the car. The police were called and Applicant was arrested and charged with intoxicated
endangerment/unattended child under eight years old. Applicant expressed remorse for
his poor judgment. After the arrest, he attended 12 weeks of alcohol counseling, which
included  weekly  breathalyzer  tests  and  random  urinalysis  screenings,  and  started
attending AA meetings. (Counselor’s letter of October 2014) The State’s Attorney’s Office
dismissed the charge and the state expunged the record. Applicant testified that this is
the only alcohol-related legal action that he has faced.
In November 2018, Applicant was diagnosed  with alcohol dependency in partial
remission, and in December 2018, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. Applicant
explained that in November 2018, he started to see a new physician who prescribed six
shots of an alcohol medication to help him maintain sobriety. The new medication was
helpful preventing the cravings or his desire to consume alcohol, but it was expensive at
about $2,900 per injection. Applicant explained the doctor changed the diagnosis so that
his  medical  insurance  would  pay  for  the  injections.  He  received  the  injections  from
December 2018 to June 2019.  (GE 3)
Applicant attributed his success  in abstaining  from  alcohol to  his wife’s support.
She has been proactive on working with him to learn what is going to keep him sober and
keep their relationship in a good spiritual base. He wants to be a good father and husband
for his family. (Tr. 21 – 22)
Applicant submitted an evaluation from his licensed counselor, dated October 7,
2021. Based on some tests she conducted and Applicant’s statement, she opined that it
does not appear that he currently has an alcohol problem. (AE A, attachment 6) He also
submitted eight reference letters from supervisors, friends, and fellow AA members. Their
consensus is that Applicant has demonstrated a desire to achieve sobriety. He regularly
attends  AA,  communicates  with  his sponsor frequently,  and is a  grateful contributor to
AA. He has been willing to incorporate the 12 steps of the AA program into his daily life.
He is considered to be a valued employee who does a great job as a coworker, husband,
father, and friend. He has made great strides over the past few years, and is in a good
place professionally and personally. (AE A, attachments 5a – 5h)

The SOR alleges that Applicant has been arrested and charged with driving under
the influence (DUI) five times, prior to December 2019, and one alcohol-related disorderly
conduct violation. All of his alcohol-related misconduct was cross-alleged under Guideline
J, and an additional 1998 charge of obtaining a hunting license under false pretenses was
also alleged. All of his alcohol-related and criminal conduct SOR allegations were cross-
alleged under Guideline E.
Applicant  admitted  the  December  2019  arrest,  in  which  he  was  charged  with
Extreme  DUI  and  had  a  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  above  .20%.  (SOR  ¶1.a)  He
admitted a June 2015 DUI charge with a BAC between .12 and .15%. (SOR ¶ 1.b) He
stated both of these incidents occurred after he had been golfing with friends and drinking
alcohol. He generally consumes between eight and twelve beers during each golf outing.
He pleaded guilty to the 2015 DUI, and he was ordered by the court to complete three
months  of  counseling,  fined  approximately  $2,000,  and  required  to  install  an  interlock
device  on  his vehicle  for  one  year. He  also pleaded  guilty  to  the December 2019  DUI
charge, and the court sentenced him to serve two days in jail, 22 days of work release,
and 96 hours of home detention. He completed alcohol screening, attended DUI classes,
and he paid a fine of approximately $3,700. (SOR Answer, GE 3, GE 4)
Applicant admitted the following alcohol-related offenses as follows:
(SOR ¶ 1.c)  March 1999  DUI;
(SOR  ¶   1.d)   February   1995   Disorderly   Intoxication,   Public  Place,   Cause
Disturbance;
(SOR ¶ 1.e)  July 1991  DUI;  and
(SOR ¶ 1.f)  December 1990 DUI.  (SOR Answer; GE  2-GE 13)
During  a  background  interview  in  July  2019,  Applicant  discussed  in  detail  his
alcohol-related charges with an authorized government investigator. He  also described
his general pattern of drinking as consuming four to eight beers at home on the weekends.
When questioned about the likelihood that he would consume alcohol to the point where
he once again faced  adverse  consequences,  Applicant’s  reply  was  that it  would never
happen. He stated that he made a conscious decision to not consume alcohol to excess
in the future. In the event he was out drinking socially, he would use the services of an
ride-share service to prevent another DUI. Five months after this interview, Applicant was
arrested in December 2019 for DUI with a blood alcohol content above .20%. (GE 4)
Applicant admitted that he had consumed alcohol, at times to excess, from about
December 1990 to at least December 2019. In April 2021, he was diagnosed by a treating

During  his  November 2020  background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  drinking
alcohol makes him happy. Since his last arrest for DUI in December 2019, he decided he
would  abstain  completely  from  using  alcohol.  In  November  2021,  he  certified  that  the

"Applicant is a 38-year-old single man. He finished college in 2006, double majoring
in finance and statistics, and in 2008, he earned a master’s degree in operations research.
He has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, since 2019, as a data
engineer. (Tr. 24)
Applicant is highly respected on the job. According to the director of the government
agency that Applicant serves, he is a man of character and integrity, and an impressive
worker. (AE B)
Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication,
since about 2014 to the present. (Tr. 28)  In April 2014, he was arrested and charged with
driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (Answer at 1) When the police stopped him, he
was on the way home from a pub where he had consumed a few beers. (Tr. 38) The police
officer administered a sobriety test, and Applicant’s blood/alcohol content registered .15
percent. (Tr. 41) Subsequently, Applicant was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail
with five months and 25 days suspended, ordered to pay a $2,500 fine, and  ordered to
attend  alcohol  education  classes.  (Tr.  43)  Moreover,  the  court  suspended  his  driver’s
license for a year. (Tr. 43)
In March 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI after an evening of
drinking  alcohol  and  bar  hopping.  (Tr.  50-52)  Subsequently,  he  was  convicted  and
sentenced to ten days in jail and 29 days of house arrest, fined $2,600, and placed on
probation  for 11  months  and  29  days.  (GE 8  at 6) Moreover, the court suspended his
license was for five years, ordered him to complete in-patient treatment and 50 hours of
community  service,  and  ordered  him  to  install  an  ignition  interlock  device  on  his
automobile. (Tr. 43-45, 60, GE 8 at 6; GE 4)
Applicant’s inpatient treatment program, lasting from June 28, 2019 to July 8, 2019,
consisted of a combination of individual and group counseling. (Tr. 45: GE 6 at 1) During
the program, Applicant admitted to drinking to intoxication three days per week. (GE 7 at 1)
Moreover,  he  disclosed  that  his  history  of  alcohol  abuse  caused  strife  in  his  personal
relationships. (GE 6 at 1; GE 7 at 9) He was diagnosed with “severe alcohol dependency.”
(GE 6 at 5)
Applicant successfully completed the treatment program, and was discharged after
14 days. (GE 6 at 5) The clinician who worked with him during the treatment program
recommended  that  he  work  with  a  12-step  support  program,  such  as  Alcoholics
Anonymous,  and  attend  follow-up  aftercare  appointments.  (GE  6  at  2,  5)  Applicant’s
counselor characterized his prognosis as fair to moderate “provided [he] adheres to the
recommendations of the treatment team and continues working a program of recovery and
abstain from mood altering chemicals, including alcohol.” (GE 6 at 2)
Applicant  remained  abstinent  from  alcohol  for  approximately  one  month  after
discharge from in-patient treatment in June 2019. (Tr. 75) He resumed drinking alcohol in
August 2019, then stopped in approximately February 2020. (GE 2 at 11 Some time later,
Applicant resumed alcohol consumption.  He currently drinks two to three alcoholic drinks
per week on weekends, and he is not enrolled in a 12-step support program. (Tr. 76)
In October 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While License
Revoked  with  Knowledge,  and  Operating  a  Motor  Vehicle  without  a  Required  Ignition
Interlock Device. (Answer at 1) In February 2020, he pleaded guilty in state court, and was
sentenced to 29 days of house arrest. (Tr. 80) In June 2020, Applicant was charged in
federal court for the same offense. (Tr. 80)
Applicant  characterizes  his  decision  to  drive  on  a  suspended  license  as  a
“desperate decision” after months of commuting 16 miles roundtrip to work by bicycle to a
base that did not consistently allow ride sharing or cab access. (Tr. 78) In addition, he
admits  that  he  had  not  installed  an  ignition  interlock  device  at  the  time  of  his  arrest,
explaining that he considered this requirement redundant, having already been prohibited
totally from driving. (Tr. 77)
In  January  2021,  Applicant  successfully  applied  to  the  state’s  motor  vehicle
administration for a reinstatement of his driver’s license on a restricted basis. (Answer at 2)
Under the reinstatement, he is allowed to commute to work, drive for educational purposes,
and drive to church. (Answer at 2) The state motor vehicle authority’s authorization  for
Applicant to drive under restricted conditions stated that he must obtain an ignition interlock
device before the restrictions were relaxed. (Answer at 2)
Applicant  contends  that  he  “does  not  have  an  Alcohol  Dependency  problem”
because he has none of the associated risk factors. (AE A) He provided no evidence from
either a physician, counselor, or certified alcohol clinician that his diagnosis is in remission.

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  2.b.  He
admitted SOR ¶ 2.a. He did not answer the cross-allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.a and 4.a. He
included  a  brief  narrative  statement  with  his  answer.  Applicant’s  admission
is
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years old. He was married from 1999 until August 2013, when he
and  his  wife  divorced.  They  have  four  children,  all  born  between  1999  and  2005.
Applicant  has been  employed  in the defense  industry since  about 2007,  in  the field  of
logistics. He has worked for his current employer since August 2018. (Item 3)
On his June 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed prior U.S. Government background
investigations in 2007 and 2012. He also disclosed that, in about January 2018, he had
a  security  clearance  eligibility  or  access  authorization  denied,  suspended,  or  revoked,
by an AGA. He reported that he had held a clearance without incident since 2007, but
that  the  AGA  had  revoked  his  access  to  a  particular  facility,  following  an  inconclusive
polygraph result. (Item 3 at 38-39)
Government  Item  4  is  a  Clearance  Decision  Statement  (CDS)  from  the  AGA,
dated  May  9,  2018.  The  CDS  notes  as  background  that  Applicant  had  held  access  to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) since March 2008 through AGA 1, and then
was  indoctrinated  for  SCI  access  with  AGA  2  in  September  2014,  pending  final
adjudication. (Item 4 at 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed   by   AGA   2   counterintelligence   representatives  in
September  2014   and   January   2015   without  incident.   (Item   4   at  1)  During   a   third
interview, in February 2015, he revealed  the  following  security-significant information:
   Applicant advised  that  he  solicited  and  paid  a  prostitute  for  oral sex  three
times, once  in the  early  2000s, once  in 2009  or 2010, and  once   in spring
2013.  On   each   occasion,  he   went  to   an  area   known   to  be  frequented  by
prostitutes. A female approached his car at  a stop  light and  he  allowed  her
to   get   in.   They   drove   to   an   alley   and   she   performed   oral   sex   on   him,   for
which he paid  $20. (Item 4 at 2)  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 3.a, 4.a)
   Applicant reported  a  history  of  excessive  alcohol consumption. His alcohol
consumption   was  moderate   until  2011   or  2012,  when   it  increased
significantly   after  he   learned   of  his  wife’s  infidelity.  He   would  become
intoxicated  twice weekly by  drinking  whiskey  and  vodka. On  one  instance
in winter 2012,  he passed out  on the  street in front  of his house. He  awoke
in bed after someone  helped him inside. (Item 4 at 2)  (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 4.a)
   Applicant  also   acknowledged   that   on  five   or six   occasions  between   1990
(when   he   was  underage)  and   2014,  he   operated   a   motor  vehicle   while
knowingly  intoxicated. On  two  occasions in December 2014, he  consumed
whiskey  while driving. (Item 4  at 2)  (SOR ¶¶  2.a, 3.a, 4.a)
Applicant  had  a  fourth  interview in  July  2015.  It  revealed  no  security  significant
information.  He  had  a  fifth  interview  in  December  2018  that  revealed  the  following
information:
   Applicant  reiterated   facts  about  his  prior  solicitations   of  prostitutes,   as
discussed   above,  and   added   that  he   had   consumed   alcohol  in  his  car,
while   driving,   prior  to   the   2013   solicitation.   He  also  disclosed   that  he
similarly  solicited  and  paid a  prostitute  for oral sex, once  in 2015,  twice in
May  or June  2017, and  once  in July  2017, under similar circumstances to
those   as   previously   described   during   his  third   interview.  (Item   4   at  3-4)
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 3.a, 4.a)
   Applicant  also   acknowledged   searching   for  prostitutes  on   the   internet  in
January,  August,   October,   and   November  2017.  On   one   occasion,   he
exchanged one text message  with someone, but had second thoughts and
did not  follow through. (Item  4 at 3-4)  (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 4.a)
   Applicant  said  he   had   not  consumed  alcohol to   intoxication   since  August
2013, and  had  not driven  while  impaired  by  alcohol since  December  2014,
when   he   drove   after  consuming   one   mixed   drink.  His  alcohol  use   since
August 2013 had remained consistent and “extremely light.” (Item  4  at 4)
AGA  1  subsequently  rescinded  Applicant’s  classified  access  and  he  was
debriefed in September 2017. (Item 4 at 1) A sixth interview, in February 2018, revealed
no information of significance. (Item 4 at 4)
As  part  of  an  interrogatory  from  DOHA,  Applicant  was  given  the  opportunity  to
review,  correct,  and  adopt  as  accurate  the  summaries  of  his  interviews  with  the  AGA
investigators,  discussed  above.  In  his  December  2021  response,  Applicant  affirmed
their accuracy without further comment. (Item 5)
Applicant  also  affirmed  the  accuracy  of  the  summary  of  a  security  clearance
background interview he had in September 2019  following his June 2019 SCA with an
agent  of  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  During  that  interview,  he
discussed  the  fact  that  he  was  subject  to  two  polygraph  interviews  with  the  AGA.  He
asserted  that  he  was  told  that  one  of  the  interviews  was  inconclusive,  and  that  he
passed  the  other  one.  He  acknowledged  that,  in  January  2018,  he  was  told  that  the
AGA had revoked his access.  Unlike in his interviews  with the AGA, in his September
2019 OPM interview, Applicant did not address his prior engagement with prostitutes or
his history of alcohol involvement. (Item 5 at 8)
In  his  December  2021  interrogatory  response,  Applicant  provided  updated
information about his alcohol consumption. He said he no longer consumed alcohol and
did not intend to do so in the future. He said the last time he drank to intoxication was
“years ago” after he  learned  of  his wife’s infidelity. He could  not recall  the  last  time  he
drove under the influence of  alcohol. He  denied having been charged with any DUI or
DWI offenses and none were revealed elsewhere in the record.  Applicant also said he
had not solicited or engaged in sexual acts with a prostitute since July 2017. (Item 5)
Under  Guideline  D,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a,  which  alleged  that  between
2010 and July 2017, he engaged in sexual activity with prostitutes while granted access
to classified information. He also denied SOR ¶ 1.b, which alleged that during 2017, he
searched internet personal ads for prostitutes on multiple occasions. (Item 2)
Under  Guideline  G,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  2.a,  which  alleged  that,  from
summer  2014  to  December  2014,  he  drove  on  multiple  occasions  while  under  the
influence of alcohol, and while consuming alcohol. He denied SOR ¶ 2.b, which alleged
that  from  late  2011  to  about  September  2013,  he  drank  alcohol  to  intoxication  about
twice a week, and that once in 2012, he was so intoxicated that he passed out on the
street  in  front  of  his  home.  (Item  2)  Applicant  did  not  answer  the  cross-allegations,
under Guidelines J and E. (Item 2)
Applicant  offered  no  explanation  or  specifics in  answering  the  SOR  allegations,
except the following statement:
This   was  coerced   by   the   polygrapher.  What   I  did  do   was  from   the   past
where  I  made   mistakes  like   any   human   being.  I  had   something   serious
the   gentleman   who   was  very
to
going   on,  which
I   explained
unprofessional.  I   DO   NOT  request   a   hearing.  (Item   2)  (Emphasis  in
original)
Applicant did not elaborate and did not respond  to  the  Government’s FORM, so
he provided no additional information in mitigation.
",True
"Applicant is 33 years old.  In 2012, he  earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in aerospace
engineering, and in 2016, he earned a master’s degree. He has never married and does
not  have  any  children.  Since  October  2021,  he  has  been  employed  for  a  government
contractor as a structural design engineer. His annual salary is approximately $93,500.
He does not possess a DOD security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 15-18, 22-23, 41)
Financial
The SOR alleges two delinquent accounts totaling $24,184, as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant is indebted to a bank for a credit card balance
charged off in the amount of $19,782. He obtained a credit card to build up his credit while
he  was  attending  college.  Over  the  years  he  overspent  and  was  unable  to  make
payments, especially after his arrest in 2019 for driving under the influence (DUI). In May
2021, he hired a consumer credit company and in September 2022, they were able to
settle the  debt  with  the  creditor for about $10,500. After the  settlement  was  approved,
Applicant made two payments of $349.48 to the consumer credit company for payment
to the creditor. He estimated that the settlement would be paid in full in about 30 months.
He did not provide any documentation. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 18-21, 42-44, 47-48,
60)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant is indebted to a bank for a credit card balance
charged off in the amount of $4,402. He testified that he had obtained a second credit
card to help him pay off his original credit card debt, as cited above. Again, he could not
make  payments  to  the  creditor  following  his  2019  DUI  arrest,  because  the  financial
consequences  of  his  arrest  depleted  his  savings.  He  was  also  unable  to  include  this
delinquent account with the consumer credit company for management. In August 2022,
he initiated contact with the creditor, but he has been unable to negotiate a settlement or
a  payment  plan.  Contrary  to  his  testimony,  Applicant  disclosed  in  his  February  2022
Answer that he had “accepted a settlement offer of the debt, to be paid over 10 months
at $316 per month.” This debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 21-22, 45-49; Answer)
Applicant testified that he is current with his mortgage payment and utilities. He
does not have a family to support and his car has been paid off. He reported that after
paying his monthly expenses, he has about a $1,000 monthly net remainder. He had to
pay attorney fees of approximately $5,000 following his two DUI arrests. He has about
$175,000 invested in his 401k, $5,000 invested in stocks, and approximately $2,000 in
savings. He has not participated in a financial counseling program.  After the hearing, I
requested Applicant complete a PFS so that I could have a better understanding of his
finances. He did not submit documentation, to include the PFS, while the record was held
open for two weeks. (Tr. 23-26, 44-45, 50)
Alcohol and Criminal Conduct
Applicant was arrested in September 2019 and charged with DUI. (SOR ¶ 2.a)  He
testified that he had been with friends drinking alcohol and watching football all day. He
estimated that he had about seven beers and a couple of shots of whiskey. He thought
he was fine to drive home, but he got a flat tire and pulled his car over to the side of the
road. The police arrived, smelled alcohol, and asked Applicant to perform a field sobriety
test. He failed the test and was arrested. While the court evaluated his case for placement
into a diversion program, he was arrested for a second DUI, as set forth below. The court
denied  his  diversion  and  merged  the  two  cases  together.  In  December  2020,  he  was
found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail, suspended, fined $1,551, and placed on
one year of probation. He was also ordered by the court to complete outpatient alcohol
treatment. (Tr. 27-29, 31, 33-34)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  March  2020  and  charged  with  DUI  and  driving  while
license suspended or revoked. (SOR ¶ 2.b)  Applicant went to a bar to celebrate a friend’s
birthday.  He  consumed  alcohol,  and  when  he  attempted  to  leave,  he  hit  another  car
parked on the street with the doors open. The police were called and he failed the field
sobriety test. He registered .138% blood alcohol content (BAC) on the breathalyzer. His
2020 case was merged with the 2019 case, as set forth above. (Tr. 50-51; GE 5)
Applicant  started  alcohol  treatment  in  about  May  2020.  He  testified  that  he
successfully completed the alcohol treatment in June 2022, but he had to be readmitted
into the program after several months had passed without treatment. He was diagnosed
with alcohol use disorder. Applicant continued to use alcohol against medical advice until
October  2020,  when  he  last  consumed  alcohol.  Since  that  time,  he  has  completely
abstained from using alcohol. He does not use the services of Alcoholics Anonymous or
any  other  alcohol  support  group  to  maintain  his  sobriety.  He  is  required  to  have  an
interlock device installed on his car until April 2023. (Tr. 35-40, 51-52, 56-58)
Applicant first started consuming alcohol at the age of 16. He started to regularly
consume alcohol, drinking several beers at one sitting, at the age of  22. He estimated
that he consumed about 20 beers per week. Following his first DUI arrest in 2019, he did
not stop consuming alcohol, as requested by his attorney, but he did moderate his alcohol
use. After his second DUI arrest in 2020, he continued drinking for about seven months
until October 2020, when he made a decision to completely abstain from using alcohol.
(Tr. 52-58)

"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h with explanations.
He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  55  years  old.  He  married  in  2003  and  has  one  child.  He  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in 1993. He has worked for federal contractors since May 2010, except
for  periods  of  unemployment  for  three  months  in  2013  and  from  November  2011  to
January 2013, when he worked for a commercial business. He has worked for his current
employer, a federal contractor, since August 2019. (Tr. 17)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d  alleged  alcohol-related  conduct  from  January  2007
through  October  2009,  which  Applicant  testified  about  during  his  2012  hearing.
Applicant’s Counsel stated he did not intend to rehash this information, standing on the
prior testimony and findings of fact. (Tr. 22) I have incorporated my findings of fact for
those allegations from my earlier decision as stated below. They are verbatim from my
decision. (GE 6) The SOR allegations in the earlier decision are as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a   alleged  that  in  about  January  2007,  Applicant  resigned  from
employment because he had used a company laptop to view pornography while he was
under the influence of alcohol and on temporary duty with his employment.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleged that after seven days of inpatient treatment for alcohol abuse in
about July 2007, Applicant declined to follow his treatment provider’s advice to enroll in
an intensive outpatient program (IOP). He did not attend the IOP until March 2008.
SOR  ¶   1.c  alleged  that  in  about  September  2009,  Applicant  received  inpatient
treatment for alcohol abuse for about 17 days.
SOR ¶  1.d alleged that in about October 2009, Applicant overindulged in alcohol
during a business trip to a foreign country and failed to attend any meetings during an
entire week. He was fired from his job soon thereafter.
The  following  findings  of  facts  below  relate  to  the  above  allegations  that  were
addressed during Applicant’s first hearing and are also alleged on his later SOR.
Applicant did not struggle with alcohol abuse until approximately 2006. Around that
time, his employer initiated an investigation into suspicious activity regarding Applicant’s
company’s  laptop  computer.  He  was  on  administrative  leave  for  six  weeks  until  the
investigation was completed. Specifically, the investigation involved Applicant allegedly
accessing pornography on the computer. He admitted to surfing the web and accessing
adult pornography. The investigation also revealed there were seven to eight personal
photos of a sexual nature on his computer.
Applicant  was  devastated.  While  he  was  at  home  on  administrative  leave,  he
worried and began to drink alcohol during the mornings and afternoons. He was permitted
to return to his work facility  but could not have access to the government network. He
became frustrated and continued to drink alcohol. In approximately December 2006, the
investigation was completed. In January 2007, the results of the investigation determined
that Applicant was surfing the internet for adult pornography on his company computer,
and there were some private personal photos also on the computer. His employer gave
him the option to resign or be terminated. He chose to resign. His wife was aware of his
inappropriate use of his computer.
Applicant  looked  for  a  new  job  and  continued  to  drink  alcohol.  He  was  hired  in
approximately  March  or  April  2007  and  worked  until  July  2007.  In  June  2007,  he  was
advised  that  his  security  clearance  was  reinstated.  During  this  period  of  time,  he
continued to drink alcohol, but stated his consumption was reduced.
Applicant was aware at this point that his drinking had become problematic. He
thought  he  needed  professional  help.  He  sought  help  from  the  county  mental-health
center for depression and alcohol consumption. He was diagnosed as an alcohol abuser.
He received some treatment but had to leave the facility because his health insurance
would not cover the cost of treatment.
Applicant stated he was aware that something in his life had to change, and in July
2007, he received inpatient treatment at an alcohol treatment center and was diagnosed
with  alcohol  withdrawal  and  dependence.  He  voluntarily  sought  this  treatment.  The
normal course of inpatient treatment is 14 to 28 days. Applicant’s health insurance would
only pay for eight to nine days. He was isolated from external factors while he was an
inpatient, so he progressed through treatment. He was discharged and went back to work
with  his former employer.  He  was  told  by  the  treatment  counselor to  participate  in  the
follow-up  outpatient  program.  He  attended  a  couple  of  Alcoholic  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings  and  some  of  the  program’s  aftercare  sessions,  but  he  did  not  participate
regularly or consistently in either. He casually began to resume drinking alcohol and did
not perceive he was having any problems. He stated he did not consume alcohol for two
and half weeks after his discharge.
From  January  2008  to  June  2009,  Applicant  received  treatment  from  the  state
psychiatric services for depression and alcohol dependence. The treatment consisted of
a  six-week  IOP,  follow-up  meetings  with  a  physician  and  weekly  aftercare  meetings.
Applicant  admitted  he  participated  only  intermittently  and  discontinued  at  some  point
because he was back at work.
In August 2009, Applicant’s consumption of alcohol began increasing. He had an
incident  at  work  where  he  failed  to  report  for  two  days  without  telling  his  customer  or
employer. He stayed out of work for a couple of more days while he arranged to go back
into treatment. His wife was unaware that he was staying home and not going to work. In
September 2009, he received inpatient treatment again and completed the full course of
treatment. He resumed drinking casually around October 2009 when he and his family
went  on  vacation.  In  November  2009,  Applicant  and  a  coworker  traveled  to  a  foreign
country to provide two weeks of training to that country’s military. Applicant participated
in  the  first  week  of  training.  He  began  drinking  alcohol  the  second  week  and  made
excuses to his coworker that he was not feeling well enough to work. He would stay at
the hotel during the day and continue to drink alcohol. His employer learned of his actions,
and he was terminated.
Applicant was depressed and drinking. In February 2010, Applicant stated he got
seriously involved in his recovery. He began looking for a job. He resumed his attendance
of AA meetings and was working with a sponsor a couple of times a week. He admitted
to himself he had a serious problem with alcohol dependence. Applicant stated he did not
drink any alcohol from February 2010 until May 2011.
In  late  April  2011,  Applicant’s  community  experienced  a  devastating  tornado.
Because  they  were  without  electricity,  they  cooked  on outdoor grills.  On  May 1,  2011,
they learned that the terrorist Osama Bin Laden had been killed. His neighbor brought out
a bottle of alcohol to pass around as a toast in celebration. Applicant stated he took a
swig from the bottle. He stated he did not really think about it. His old pattern of thought
came to  him,  and  he  thought  perhaps  it  was okay  to  have  a drink  now and  again.  He
wrestled with whether to tell his AA sponsor. He decided to tell his sponsor and recommit
to the AA program. He credibly testified at his first hearing that he had not consumed any
alcohol since May 1, 2011.
Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  stubborn  about  his  recovery.  He  finally  got  to  a
point where he got tired of his struggle with alcohol. He chose to live a life of principles
and  sobriety. He had the  support  of AA, his family, and his friends.  It  was an ongoing
process. Applicant stated at his first hearing that although he was not consuming alcohol,
he had to pay attention every day and be mindful of his recovery. He had accepted that
he is an alcoholic. He attended AA meetings a couple of times a week. He talked to his
sponsor. He helped organize and participated in meetings at the treatment center where
he attended. At that time, he attended at least two AA meetings a week sometimes he
attended three to five meetings, depending on his schedule. He completed the 12-step
program  of  AA  and  was  continuing to  work through  the  steps  again.  As  he  got  further
away from his last drink there was less of a daily struggle, but he continued to be vigilant.
He said he was committed to staying sober each day. Applicant stated:
I’d   like   to   give   you   100   percent  assurances  that  I  will   never  take   a   drink
again. And  I  feel the  chances are  very close  to  that  if  I continue  to  do  what
I’ve   become   comfortable  with   doing   on   a   daily  basis  and,   you   know,
practicing   these   principles.   And   I’ve   got  a   good   support  system   both   AA
based and family and friend based. And I  feel confident about that.
Applicant’s wife  became aware that his drinking was becoming problematic and
his consumption was increasing. She was supportive in his sobriety and attended a three-
day program for family members of alcoholics provided by his treatment center to educate
her on how to help him with his sobriety and recovery. She also attended Al-Anon when
she felt she needed the support. She believed Applicant had difficulties believing he was
a good husband and father, and so he would drink. She was convinced her husband was
committed to sobriety. He made a commitment to be employed and was fully vested in
his efforts to change his ways. She believed he now realized how much he lost and was
remorseful about his past actions. She believed because he knew how much he had to
lose, he would continue to remain sober. She noticed a significant change in him since
he acknowledged his problems and committed to sobriety. She and her husband  were
communicating  better. She  supported  him  when  he  wanted  to  go  to  AA  meetings  and
never questioned him in that regard. (GE 6)
The following facts are from Applicant’s recent hearing. In his March 2020 security
clearance  application  (SCA),  Applicant  disclosed  his  2007  seven-day  inpatient  alcohol
treatment and his 2008 six-week IOP follow-up for alcohol abuse. He further disclosed
his September 2009 inpatient alcohol treatment and counseling for 17 days. He disclosed
that in August 2019, he completed a 21-day inpatient alcohol and treatment counseling
program and a follow up IOP for 12 session, each lasting three to four hours. He reported
ongoing attendance at a follow-up continuing care meeting once a week for an hour and
that he is participating in a 12-step recovery program. (GE 1)
In May 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He said that
in 2014, his AA sponsor passed away and he did not obtain a new sponsor. In 2016, he
started  drinking  again.  From  spring  2016  to  October  2018,  his  alcohol  consumption
progressed to where he was drinking daily. He testified that he was drinking daily between
a ½ pint and a fifth of liquor. He testified that he struggles with his drinking when he has
challenges. He would occasionally drink in the morning but would then not go to work. He
would sometimes stay away from work for a couple of days. He would occasionally leave
work early so he could drink. He would not drink at home. He said things had gotten very
bad at work because his drinking was affecting his motivation. His wife was not aware of
his drinking. He would hide his liquor in the garage. (Tr. 25-27, 79-86; GE 3, 7)
In October 2018, he recognized he needed to get back on track with his sobriety.
He voluntarily enrolled in a four-day detoxification program. He told the investigator that
he was sober for about two months. He said he thought he just needed the detoxification
program and a new AA sponsor, and he would be back on track. Applicant admitted at
his hearing that he left the detoxification program early. Post-hearing, he later clarified
that it was because his insurance would only authorize payment  for four days. He was
encouraged by the staff to stay, but he left against their medical advice. The discharge
summary notes that he did not want to stay in the program beyond the four days. He said
he was leaving due to commitments to family, work, and his long-term AA program outside
of the medical facility. In December 2018, he went on a cruise and started drinking again.
He began increasing his alcohol consumption and frequency and by August 2019, he was
consuming alcohol daily. He continued to hide his drinking from his wife and lie to her. He
did not think there was any specific stressor going on in his life at the time that prompted
him to drink. (Tr. 27-31, 76-77, 88-95, 100-101; GE 3, 4, 7; AE K)
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  in  August  2019,  he  decided  the  four-day
detoxification program he participated in October 2018, did not work. Applicant voluntarily
enrolled in a 21-day inpatient alcohol treatment program. He told the investigator that he
successfully completed the program and a follow-on outpatient program, which involved
12 sessions, each lasting three to four hours. He also participated in continuing care once
a  week  and  AA  meetings  twice  a  week.  He  said  he  had  not  consumed  alcohol  since
August 2019. He said he felt like he was back where he needed to be and it was not a
struggle or an issue to remain sober. He had not participated in any additional alcohol-
related counseling or treatment at that time. (Tr. 32-33, 87; GE 7)
Applicant testified that after August 2019 he had an AA sponsor and stayed sober
until November 2020, when he was preparing a meal and one of the ingredients was red
wine. He took a gulp of the wine. He said within seven days he had progressed to daily
drinking. He estimated he was drinking between a pint and a fifth of bourbon  daily. He
was in a state of depression and despair. He had been participating in AA but started to
slack off. He entered alcohol treatment and was in a 21-day inpatient treatment program.
He did not contact his AA sponsor when he started to drink again but waited until he was
admitted into the inpatient program. (Tr. 34-39, 85-86)
Applicant testified that he has been sober since November 11, 2020. He testified
about what has changed. He said he is now plugged in with AA and is consistent with his
attendance. His 2020 treatment was organized differently, and he is now with a group of
men around his age. He felt there was a deeper sense of the spiritual side of recovery,
where  he  is  more  focused.  He  is  following  the  12-step  AA  program  and  is  being
responsible  as a trusted  servant. He  is  now more active  in the program  and  serves  in
different positions, including being a chairman for monthly business meetings. He said he
is also a sponsor for three others who reach out to him. He attends 3 to 5 meetings per
week and in the past attended 7 to 12 meetings a week. He provided attendance sheets
from  his  AA  meetings  to  corroborate  his  meeting  attendance  from  December  2020  to
January 2023. (Tr. 39-44, 99, 105; AE J)
Applicant acknowledged that he cannot give 100% assurance that he will not drink
in the future. He acknowledged he has a disease and that if he consumes one drink it will
set off a cycle of destructive behavior. He is not sure if he consumes alcohol again if he
will be able to recover and that scares him. He has a responsibility to his family and his
employer, which he takes seriously. He said he has the support of his family, friends, and
coworkers who know he is working on his sobriety. (Tr. 42-46, 56, 107-108)
Applicant testified that in 2005 he was prescribed Norco, a painkiller, by his family
doctor, due to a sciatic problem with his back. The prescription is to take one tablet twice
a day as needed for pain. In the last five years, he estimated he takes it about two to three
times a week on average and only if Ibuprofen does not work. He will usually take half a
tablet, but if the pain is severe, he will take the full tablet twice a day, as prescribed. He
credibly  testified  that  he  does  not  use  it  for  any  other  purposes.  He  knows  that  as  an
alcoholic it could be dangerous with his brain chemistry. He said that he has never felt a
compulsion to attempt to increase its effect. He stated that alcohol is one thing and opiates
are another. He disputed that when he was admitted for alcohol treatment in 2019 that he
said he took more Norco than was prescribed. He stated what he told the medical staff
was that he took more than he usually takes, but not more than was prescribed.  He is
aware drugs and alcohol do not mix and he does not use them beyond what is prescribed.
Applicant has not discussed his alcoholism with his family doctor. Applicant’s doctor who
prescribes  the  medication  provided  a  written  statement  regarding  Applicant’s  use.  He
confirmed Applicant has used it for many years, and he does not have any concern that
he  is  abusing  it.  I  found  Applicant’s  statement  credible  that  he  did  not  exceed  the
prescribed dosage. (Tr. 51-55, 59-74; AE D)
Applicant  participated  in  a  psychological  evaluation  by  a  government-employed
psychologist, Dr. F, in August 2021. The interview lasted approximately eight hours and
was  conducted  in  person.  Dr.  F  provided  a  detailed  narrative  that  for  the  most  part
coincides with the facts of Applicant’s past alcohol abuse. Dr. F diagnosed Applicant with
major depressive disorder, recurrent, exacerbated by grief/loss in sustained remission;
and alcohol use disorder, severe in sustained remission. He believed Applicant is more
committed to working his AA program this time around and to saving his family and career.
He  believes  he  has  a  much  better  support  groups  in  AA,  his  worksite  coworkers  plus
management,  and  his  family  and  friends.  Applicant  understands  the  triggers  to  his
relapse. His prognosis  is good,  and  Dr. F did  not find   Applicant’s alcohol abuse  would
have  a  negative  impact on  his reliability, stability, judgment,  or trustworthiness. (Tr. 47-
50; GE 3)
Applicant participated in a one-hour Zoom evaluation by a government-employed
psychologist,  Dr.  B,  in  February  2022.  Applicant  said  he  told  Dr.  B  that  he  had  been
evaluated in August 2021, and she told him that this evaluation must be a follow-up check-
in conversation. Dr. B described Applicant as evasive. He answered her questions and
was not sure how much detail she wanted because he was told it was a wellness check.
Dr. B indicated she gave Applicant the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) test and
the validity scales indicated he was consistent in his responding, and did not attempt to
over or under report symptoms or behaviors that individuals commnly admit to. However,
she found that certain aspects of the profile raise the possibility of denial problems with
drinking and drug abuse. Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, severe;
major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified severity; generalized anxiety disorder;
opioid disorder; tobacco use disorder; pornography addiction R/O, which means rule out.
She  did  not  find  Applicant  truthful  during  the  interview  She  derived  her  diagnostic
impressions primarily from her clinical judgment and medical record review. She found
Applicant may be unreliable or untrustworthy, impulsive, engage in dangerous activities,
or take unnecessary risks and his prognosis is poor. (Tr. 47-50; GE 2)
Applicant’s wife testified. She has tried to support her husband. She believes he
has been sober for more than two years and is actively participating in AA. His drinking
has been stressful on their marriage. In the past, she was confident that he would maintain
his sobriety, but believes this time he is dedicated and committed to it. She has never
observed  him abuse Norco  and does not  believe  he abuses  it. She believes he has a
disease that only he can control. He is a good man and wants to do the right thing. She
has known he is an alcoholic since about 2006. Most of the time he would not divulge to
her he was drinking. He would not tell her the truth about his drinking. She would bring
his drinking to his attention and remove the alcohol from the house, but she could not
stop him. (Tr. 110-122)
Applicant’s AA sponsor testified on his behalf. He has been his sponsor for about
three or four years. He said Applicant is doing great and attends a lot of meetings. They
get together about once or twice a month and see each other at meetings. He believes
Applicant’s sobriety is solid  and he  is a man  of integrity. Applicant has followed his AA
plan, but has stumbled when he relapsed in 2020. Since then, he has been in compliance.
Applicant has sought assistance from his sponsor. (Tr. 123-130)
A  character  witness  testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance for 25 years. He was Applicant’s supervisor who fired him in 2009 when he was
drinking  on  a  work  trip  in  a  foreign  country.  He  was  offered  an  opportunity  to  rehire
Applicant for a specific contract and chose not to because he wanted to see how he was
performing  elsewhere.  A  couple  of  years  later,  he  noted  a  change  in  Applicant  and
believed he was in a good spot and was low risk. He rehired him in July 2019. He is now
a level above Applicant’s supervisor. Applicant is doing well at his job, and he does not
have a concern about him having access to classified information. (Tr. 24, 131-141)
Applicant’s  facility  security  officer  testified  on  his  behalf.  They  have  worked
together since 1998. She is aware of the concerns about his issues with alcohol. He has
been upfront with her and self-reported his issues. When he went back into treatment in
November 2020, he talked to her about it. She believes he is a person of integrity. He is
professional  and  meticulous  in  his  work.  She  does  not  have  concerns  about  his
alcoholism. (143-148)
Character letters were provided from Applicant’s sister and longtime friend. He is
described as intelligent, reliable, dependable, and beloved. They believe that Applicant is
totally committed to his sobriety this time because he is immersed in AA and more active
and determined. (AE H, I)
Applicant  provided  his  employee  performance  evaluations  for  2020,  2021,  and
2022. He is consistently evaluated in the different performance categories as  excellent
and outstanding. (AE A, B, C)

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2000 and a master’s
degree in 2005. He has been employed by a federal contractor since November 2020.
He is also self-employed with his own business since August 2017. Except for a period
from May 2015 to August 2017, Applicant has worked for federal contractors since 2008.
He was married in 2004 and divorced in 2009. He does not have children. (Item 3)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2021. In it, he
disclosed he has held a top secret security clearance since 2008. (Item 3)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that in February 2012, Applicant was charged with operating a
vehicle while intoxicated and operating a vehicle with .10 blood alcohol content (BAC) in
State  A.  In  July  2021,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  He
disclosed that in 2012 he was stopped by police after he had drinks at a bar. He could
not recall how many. He was arrested and later went to court and pleaded guilty to the
offense. He said his driver’s license was suspended for some time, but could not recall
for how long. He was required to pay a fine and perform community service. (Items 2, 3,
10)
Applicant disclosed in his SCA that in November 2015 he was arrested for driving
under the influence (DUI) of alcohol in State B. He was at a bar with friends and consumed
between four to five alcoholic beverages. He felt fine to drive. He was stopped by police
and  failed  a  breathalyzer  test.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI.  He  told  the  government
investigator  that  he  was  ordered  to  pay  a  fine,  complete  community  service,  and  his
license  was  suspended for three months. He  admitted SOR  ¶ 1.b that alleged he  was
charged with DUI in November 2015, found guilty and sentenced to five days in jail and
36 months probation. (Items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10)
In February 2017, Applicant was charged with driving when privilege suspended
for prior DUI conviction in State B. In May 2017, a bench warrant was issued against him
for this offense. It remains active as of the close of the record. (Items 8, 9)
In March 2017, an arrest warrant was issued from  State B where Applicant was
convicted of DUI in 2015, for failing to comply with the probation conditions. The warrant
remains active as of the close of the record. (Items 8, 9)
In December 2017, Applicant was charged in State C with leaving the scene of a
crash and driving while license revoked due to DUI. It appears he had a plea agreement
and  pleaded  guilty  or  no  contest  to  the  revocation  offense  and  received  a  30-day  jail
sentence, which was suspended, and a fine. (Item 4)
Applicant told the government investigator that in April 2019 he was at a friend’s
house and consumed between four and five alcoholic beverages. He was driving home
when he was in a one-car accident. According to the police report, Applicant was trapped
in the vehicle and the roof had to be cut off by the fire department to extricate him from it.
He was observed by the fireman on scene to be highly intoxicated. A check by the police
revealed Applicant’s license had been revoked for a previous DUI. The effective dates of
the revocation was from July 2016 to July 2019. Applicant refused consent to submit to a
blood test. The police obtained  a search  warrant  for Applicant’s  blood test results.  His
blood  alcohol  level  at  the  time  of  the  accident  was  .204%.  The  court  records  reflect
Applicant was charged with DUI in State C, driving while license revoked, and failure to
have insurance. He was convicted of the offenses. He received 2 days’ home confinement
for the DUI (one day suspended), 30 days’ home confinement for driving with a revoked
license, and fines for all three offenses. (Items 5, 10)
Applicant  told  the  government  investigator  that  he  does  not  believe  he  has  a
problem with alcohol. For his 2015 and 2019 DUI convictions, he was required to attend
court-ordered alcohol awareness classes. He said he no longer drinks and drives. He is
a social drinker and goes out about once a month or two months. He will consume two to
three alcoholic beverages and will not drive. He has no intention of drinking and driving
in the future. He said he will not drive even if he consumes one drink. (Item 10)
Applicant  disclosed  in his  SCA  that  from  January 2017  to  March  2017  he  used
cocaine  three  or  four  times  while  at  parties.  He  was  not  working  as  a  government
contractor  at  the  time.  He  told  the  government  investigator  that  he  stopped  using  it
because he did not like it and he did not intend to use it or any other illegal drug in the
future. (Items 3, 10)
SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.j  alleged  delinquent  medical  accounts,  credit  cards,
communication  services,  utilities,  and  other  consumer  accounts  totaling  approximately
$35,249.  Applicant  admitted  them  all  in  his  SOR  answer.  He  told  the  government
investigator that he had some financial problems during the COVID pandemic when he
did not have enough work and fell behind on his bills. When the investigator confronted
him with his delinquent accounts he said he was unaware the accounts were delinquent,
and he would look into them and resolve them. These collection accounts are reported in
Applicant’s June 2021 and February 2022 credit bureau reports. Applicant did not provide
any  information  about  actions  he  may  have  taken  to  pay,  dispute,  or  resolve  these
accounts. (Items 2, 6, 7 10)

"In  his SOR  Response,  Applicant admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,  and  provided a
narrative statement. His SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  50  years old.  He  and  his  wife  have  been  married  for 23  years.  He
has  two  daughters  and  one  stepdaughter.  He  has  been  employed  with  a  defense
contractor since May 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 22)
Applicant testified that in December 2019, he was in a “dark place” after losing a
job  he  had  held  for  the  previous  19  years.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  began  soon
thereafter,  and  he  had  difficulty  finding  employment.  He  was  hired  by  his  current
employer  and  clearance  sponsor  in  May  2020  after  several  interviews.  He  has  never
held a clearance before. (Tr. 19-20; GE 1)
Applicant’s April 2020 arrest occurred before he was hired. He and his wife had
been arguing, and he decided to go for a ride. He went out and had “a couple of drinks.”
While  driving  home,  he  swerved  to  miss  a  deer,  went  off  the  road  and  hit  a  pole.
Paramedics  and  police  came  to  the  scene.  He  failed  a  field  sobriety  test  and  was
arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) first offense. (Tr. 20-21; GE 2, GE 3, GE 5)
(SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant  said he  curbed  his drinking  after that  for a  few months, but  in August
2020, after another argument with his wife, he left and drove to a nearby town and had
“a few beers here and there.” He said he swerved over the line and was arrested for a
second  offense.  (Tr.  21)  He  later  explained  that  it  was  a  Saturday,  and  he  started
drinking around noon, and had a few drinks. He “sat in the country a little bit. Decided I
would go get something to eat,  . . . and the next thing I know, I’m getting pulled over for
my  second  offense.”  (Tr.  34)  He  later  pleaded  guilty  to  another  charge  of  DWI  first
offense. (Tr. 35-36; GE 2, GE 4, GE 5) (SOR ¶ 1.b)
In   his  background   interview,  Applicant   gave   more   details.   He  said   he   started
drinking   around   noon.   He  went  to   a   local  convenience   store  and   purchased   two   20-
ounce   cans   of hard  lemonade,  and   “went  somewhere  and   sat.”   He   then   drove   around
for a   while  and   ended   up   at  a   sports bar. He   ordered   wings and  had  two   or three  20-
ounce  beers. A  friend  came  in and  Applicant  had  one  or two  more  20-ounce  beers.  He
was there  about two  or  three  hours and  went  home  around  8:30  or 9  pm. He was pulled
over  after  the   officer  observed   him   weaving.   Applicant   had   a   blood   alcohol  content  of
either .16  or .18 according  to the  roadside sobriety test. (GE 2)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  both  of  his  arrests  occurred  in  the  aftermath  of
arguments  with  his  wife.  They  have  not  participated  in  formal  marital  counseling,  but
they  have  met  with  some  family  friends  and  with  their  pastor  to  work  through  their
differences.  Things  have  improved  since  he  stopped  drinking  after  his  most  recent
offense, in August 2020. (Tr. 23)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.a,  the  April  2020  offense,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  DWI  first
offense  in  January  2021.  He  received  a  60-day  suspended  jail  sentence,  one  year  of
probation,  and  he  was  fined  $250.  He  was  ordered  to  participate  in  an  alcohol  safety
awareness  program  (ASAP)  and  was  ordered  to  have  an  ignition  interlock  device
installed on his car. He completed the classes and probation for that offense. (Tr. 31-33;
GE 2, GE 3)
As to SOR ¶ 1.b, the August 2020 offense, Applicant pleaded guilty in February
2021. He was sentenced to six months in jail, of which  five months and 10 days were
suspended.  (GE  4)  He  said  he  served  eight  days  in  jail  after  he  was  credited  with
previous time served. (GE 2) He was also ordered to participate in the ASAP program
and to have an ignition interlock device placed on his car. (GE 2, GE 4)
Applicant reported his April 2020 offense on his May 2020 SCA. (GE 1 at 29) He
discussed  both  offenses  and  the  resulting  sentences  in  his  March  2021  background
security interview, which, as he noted, occurred shortly before he was to report to jail to
serve his sentence. He voluntarily disclosed his August 2020 DWI during the interview.
(GE 2)
The  Government’s  documentation  about  the  two  offenses  indicates  that  the
ignition interlock device was to remain on Applicant’s car for one year after his February
2021 sentence. (GE 3, GE 4). However, Applicant testified in his October 2022 DOHA
hearing that the ignition interlock device “has to stay on my car for two  years after the
last conviction.” (Tr. 26) He noted in his Answer that the interlock device would remain
on  his  car  until  February  2023  (two  years  after  his  February  2021  sentence  date).
(Answer)  He  testified  that  he  believed  he  was  still  on  probation  and  under  ignition
interlock requirements until August 2023. (Tr. 26-27, 40) He testified that his license is
restricted in that he cannot drive a car that is not equipped with an ignition interlock. (Tr.
40-41)
Applicant  has  not  had  any
to  alcohol
ignition
consumption. He has completed the classroom portion of the ASAP program, but he is
still in the ASAP program due to the interlock requirement. (Tr. 26-29; AE A) He has had
no subsequent alcohol-related offenses. (Tr. 36)
interlock  violations  due
During  his  testimony,  Applicant  volunteered  that  he  had  a  prior  DUI  arrest  in
1999, an offense that he did not list on his SCA. (Tr. 42) He explained that he was taken
out drinking by friends for his bachelor party the weekend before his wedding. He said
he  was  allowed  to  drive  home  afterwards.  He  was  arrested  and  charged  with  first
offense DUI after he ran a stop sign. He later pled guilty, attended ASAP classes, and
had a restricted driver’s license for six months. He found new friends and priorities, and
later earned an engineering degree. He also stopped drinking for 12 years. (Tr. 52-54)
(SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant has “struggled a bit here and there,” but has tried to remain sober. He
is  not  proud  of  his  actions.  His  relationship  with  his  family,  friends,  and  children  has
improved.  (Tr.  21)  He  described  his  August  2020  as  a  life-changing  event.  He  spent
eight days in jail. He is grateful no one was injured, and he will not drink and drive again
and  hopes  never  to  drink  again.  He  has  been  sober  since  his  last  offense,  in  August
2020. (Tr. 29, 37)
Applicant has attended about half a dozen Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings
over the  last two  years,  most  recently  in July  2022.  He is  prompted  to  go to meetings
after a rough day at work or when  arguing over money or things at home. He goes to
AA  meetings  instead  of  going  for  a  drink.  He  does  not  have  a  sponsor  and  is  not
formally  in  the  AA  12-step  program.  (Tr.  24-25)  He  has  not  had  any  other  alcohol
counseling. (Tr. 42) Applicant believes he is an alcoholic. (Tr. 37)
Recent  evaluations  reflect  that  Applicant  is  regarded  as  a  highly  valued
employee.  He  exceeds  goals  and  expectations  for  his  role  and  he  demonstrates
leadership and effectiveness in managing complex tasks. He has “grown immensely” in
his time with the company and has been instrumental in accomplishing leadership roles
and assigned tasks. (Tr. 22; AE B, AE C)

"Applicant  is  62  years  old,  divorced,  and  has  three  adult  children.  He  earned  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  1989.  He  has  worked  as  an  engineer  for  his  security  clearance
sponsor  since  September 2020. Applicant has  held a  secret  clearance  for most  of  the
period  from  1992  to  the  present.  He  seeks  to  retain his security  clearance  eligibility  in
connection with his employment. (Tr. at 13-15; GE 1 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 17, 18, and
25, AE E.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption
The  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a  security  clearance
because he has a long history of excessive alcohol consumption and he failed to follow
treatment advice after he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (severe). In his Answer
Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d and 1.f and 1.g, and he admitted in part and
denied in part SOR ¶ 1.e. He provided additional information to clarify his admissions to
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g.
The  details  of  each  of  the  SOR  allegations  and  related  record  evidence  is  as
follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a   2007   arrest  and   charge   for  Driving   Under  the   Influence   -  Alcohol.
Applicant has little recollection of what happened the night of his arrest aside from waking
up  in  the  county  jail’s  “drunk  tank.”  In  an  interview  in  connection  with  a  prior  security
clearance investigation, he disclosed that he hit a pedestrian in an intersection. He told
the  investigator  that  there  were  no  injuries.  He  pled  no  contest  to  Driving  Under  the
Influence - Alcohol (DUI) and was sentenced to five years of probation. (Tr. at 15, 22-23;
GE 1, Sections 22, 24; GE 3 at 25; GE 4 at 1-2; GE 5 at 3.)
SOR ¶ 1.b  March  to  May 2010  outpatient counseling  for condition  diagnosed  as
alcohol dependence.  Applicant was terminated from a job in early 2010 for showing up
for  work  intoxicated.  He  voluntarily  admitted  himself  into  this  two-month  outpatient
program. He fully complied with the conditions of the program. Appellant started drinking
alcohol when he was in his forties. He started drinking more heavily in the 2007 to 2010
period. In the outpatient program, he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent (Tr. at 15-16,
28-29; GE 3 at 9, 25.)
SOR  ¶  1.c   September  to   October  2010   inpatient  treatment  for   a   condition
diagnosed  as  alcohol dependence. Applicant’s marriage “fell apart” in 2010 when he and
his wife separated, and the stress following the breakup caused Applicant to relapse and
start drinking excessively again. He voluntarily admitted himself into a 30-day inpatient
treatment program. (Tr. at 16-17, 29-33; GE 1, Section 24.)
SOR  ¶  1.d   Between   2010   and   June   2015,   multiple  periods  of  inpatient  and
outpatient  treatment  for  a   condition   diagnosed   as  alcohol   dependence.  Applicant  had
periods of sobriety after his 2010 inpatient treatment. The longest was about 18 months.
He  had  several  relapses.  Sometimes  he  voluntarily  entered  an  inpatient  treatment
program for about seven days, and on other occasions he decided to pursue outpatient
treatment. He stated that he was not taking his condition seriously and did not realize that
he had crossed the line between being a social drinker into being an alcoholic. He did not
appreciate the seriousness of the disease of alcoholism. Applicant and his wife divorced
in January 2014. (Tr. at 17; 32-33; GE 1, Sections 17, 24.)
SOR  ¶  1.e   May  2014   arrest  and   charges  with   DUI  and   Failure  to   Stop   after  an
Accident. Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and Failure to Stop, as alleged in
the SOR. He denied, however, the allegation that he was sentenced to four days in jail.
He testified that after his arrest he was put in the “drunk tank” overnight until he regained
his sobriety and then was released.  The  FBI report and  the  local sheriff’s report in  the
record support the allegation that he was sentenced to four days in jail. He described the
incident as a relapse and after drinking alcohol he drove to a store to buy groceries. He
had a minor accident and, due to the nature of the incident, he pulled his car into a parking
space to get his car off the road. The police treated his actions as a “hit and  run.” This
charge was eventually dropped. He testified that the accident was caused by the careless
driving of the other party involved, but Applicant took full responsibility for the accident
because  he  was  intoxicated.  His  BAC  was  0.19%.  He  plead  guilty  to  DUI  and  was
sentenced to five years of probation. He believes that the reference in his criminal record
to  five  days  in  jail  may  have  been  a  suspended  sentence.  He  was  also  sentenced  to
attend an 18-month alcohol education program. He fully complied with the terms of his
sentence. He voluntarily entered an outpatient treatment program, as described in SOR
¶ 1.d, above. (Tr. at 17-18, 23, 33-39; GE 1, Sections 22, 24; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 6, 24;
GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 5.)
SOR ¶ 1.f  August to  September 2017  inpatient treatment  for conditions  diagnosed
as Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe) and  Depression. Applicant testified that his depression
was not long-term, but rather was “incidental to  the  alcohol.” He was depressed  by  his
living conditions in a desert area that was not agreeable to him and his lingering negative
feelings following his divorce.  He was experiencing stress related to his job and family
situation. His abuse of alcohol also acted as a depressant. He voluntarily entered into a
30-day inpatient program. He testified that at this point, his longest period of sobriety was
sixteen months, starting in January 2016 and ending in May 2017. He was discharged
with  a  diagnosis  of  Substance  Abuse  Disorder  –  Alcohol,  Severe  with  a  co-occurring
mental  disorder  of  Depression.  He  was  given  a  guarded  prognosis.  After  he  left  the
treatment facility in September 2017, he relocated to another city and lived in a shared
community home that was dedicated to alcohol-free living. He did well there until 2019
when he had a relapse and lost his job due to his failure to contact his supervisor and to
show up for work. (Tr. at 18-19, 42-50; GE 1, Section 24; GE 2 at 2-3; GE 3 at 9; GE 7 at
7-8.)
SOR ¶ 1.g  January to  February 2021  inpatient treatment for conditions diagnosed
as Alcohol Use Disorder (Moderate  or Severe) and  Major Depressive  Disorder (Single
Episode,  Severe).  Applicant  had  a  “short  relapse”  in  January  2021.  He  voluntarily
checked himself into an inpatient program. He was intoxicated at the time, and his BAC
measured at 0.183%. He only intended to stay long enough to detox. The SOR allegation
stated  that  he  left  the  treatment  facility  before  completing  his  Continuing  Recovery
Discharge Plan. He explained that was true, but his early departure from the program was
the result of a misunderstanding. Due to his intoxicated condition at the time he entered
the program, he did not understand that he was expected to remain at the facility for 30
days. He could not stay there for more than a brief period because that would have kept
him away from his new job. He stayed for about five days; long enough, in his view, to
safely  detox  from  his  condition.  The  treatment  facility’s  discharge  summary  lists
Applicant’s  diagnosis  on  arrival  was  Alcohol  Intoxication  with  moderate  or  severe  use
disorder.  The  summary  reflects  that  he  made  no  progress  in  treatment  and  left  the
program before any planning could be done or any referrals provided. Applicant failed to
list this treatment in his February 5, 2021 e-QIP because he was tired of filling out the e-
QIP and he felt that the treatment was not significant, rather it was just a “quick detox.”
(Tr. at 19, 51-58, 66; GE 3 at 10; GE 6 at 1, 18.)
The last time Applicant drank alcohol was in July 2022. He purchased alcohol and
consumed it at his residence. He was not fully engaged in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) at
the time. He described his attendance at AA meetings prior to July 2022 as “spotty.”  As
a  result of  his relapse, he  was required  to renew his sobriety  date at  AA.  On  May  26,
2022, Applicant signed a statement “under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United
States that he intended to never drink alcohol again and never to drive after drinking. His
statement  also  expressed  his  understanding  that  “any  inappropriate  involvement  with
alcohol use may be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.” At the hearing
in  December  2022,  Applicant  strongly  emphasized  this  he  wants  “to  lick  this  thing,”
referring to his alcoholism, and to live an alcohol-free life. This is his top priority now. He
feels that his alcoholism is ruining his life, his health, and possibly his career. (Tr. at 53,
55-65; AE A.)
Paragraph 2, Guideline I, Psychological Conditions
The Government cross-alleged under Guideline I the SOR allegations set forth in
¶¶ 1.b through 1.d, 1.f and 1.g. Applicant did not separately respond to these allegations
in his Answer.
Mitigation
Applicant described  his  alcohol consumption,  until he  was  about  45,  as social.    He
blames the  beginning  of his excessive  drinking  on  his  “bad  marriage.” He  was  opposed
to  divorcing  for religious reasons. Instead,  he turned  to  alcohol.  Applicant acknowledged
that   he   is   an   alcoholic.  He   now   attends   meetings  of   Alcoholics  Anonymous   (AA)   most
mornings, and  he  intends to  continue  to  do  so. He has  a  sponsor. Applicant believes  that
alcohol is a  “tricky disease,” because  it misleads you  to  believing  that it is not a  disease
and  is not a  problem.  It has taken  him  a  long  time  to  realize  that he  is an  alcoholic and
that he  needs to  do  whatever the  AA  program  requires. He is actively involved  in the  AA
12-step  program. He  is  presently at Step  8. He  intends  to  actively participate  in  AA  for the
rest   of  his  life.  He  rents   a   room   from   an   individual  who   is  also  in  AA.  They  have   an
agreement that  there will  be  no  drinking  of alcohol in  the  residence. Applicant  explained
that he  has now fully accepted  his disease  of  alcoholism  and  treats his disease  with  AA
and by seriously practicing  his religious faith. He also receives counseling  from  the  pastor
at his church. He understands now that he can no longer turn to alcohol to help him  deal
with  stress in his life.  After his last  relapse  he  has a  new sponsor. He speaks  with  the
sponsor weekly.  His prior sponsor lived  too  far from  Applicant, and  he  recommended  to
Applicant that he  should find  a  sponsor who  lives near Applicant. (Tr. at 16-17, 19-24, 27,
60-61; AE  I.)
Applicant’s  AA  sponsor  wrote  in  a  character reference  letter  that  he  has  known
Applicant  for  about  six  years  through  their  attendance  at  AA  meetings.  He  praised
Applicant for “reworking” the 12 steps of AA. He commented that Applicant has held an
administrative  position  in  his church and now  has  a  similar position  with  a  social club.
Applicant  also  submitted  four  other  character  reference  letters.  His  former  sponsor,  a
former  neighbor,  a  former  supervisor,  and  his  church  pastor  all  praised  Applicant’s
character and his dedication to maintaining sobriety. (AE C; AE I.)

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e, 2.b-2.d, 3.a, and the cross-allegations at SOR
¶¶ 3.b-3.c. He denied SOR ¶ 2.a.  His admissions are incorporated into the findings of
fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old facilities and logistics support employee. He has been
employed  by  his  sponsor  since  July  2022.  (Item  3  at  13.)  He  earned  his  high  school
diploma in August 2010. He attended community college in 2012 and 2015 and has not
completed his associates degree. (Item 3 at 12.) He is single and resides with his girlfriend
and her two children. (Item 3 at 23 and Response.) He does not have any children of his
own. (Item 3 at 24.)
Item 8 is Applicant’s August 1, 2014 e-QIP.  He marks on his June 28, 2018 e-QIP
that he was granted a clearance. (Item 3 at 40.)
Guideline G  (cross-alleged under  Guideline J)
In December 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged  with Drunk in Public. In
February  2014,  he  was  found  guilty  in  abstentia.  (Item  5  at  1.)  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  3.b)  He
explained in his Answer he had gotten out of his friend’s car while his friend “was being
arrested for DUI” and the same officers arrested him as he walked to his friend’s house.
In June 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged. He pled guilty in September
2014 of Driving While Intoxicated. (Item 5 at 4-5.) (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 3.b) He was required to
attend counseling as part of his sentence. (Item 5 at 5.) The Government notes he violated
his probation. (Item 5 at 16.) Prior to his parole violation he was found to have failed to
comply  with  court  orders  on  multiple  occasions.  (Item  5  at  8-9,10-11,  and  14-15.)  He
offered that he attended and completed the two required court ordered programs. (Item
2 at 1.)
In February 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with Violation of Probation-
Failure  to  Comply  with  ASAP  (Alcohol  Safety  Action  Program).  He  pled  guilty  in  April
2017. (Item 5 at 16-17.) (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 3.b) He asserted that he was confused about the
scheduling and that he did not receive the notice for his first appointment because it was
sent to a prior address. He offered that he completed the required counseling program.
(Item 2 at 1.)
In  July  2015, Applicant  was arrested  and  charged  with  being  Drunk  in Public. He
pled  nolo contendere  in January 2016  of  being  Drunk in  Public or Profane. (Item 5 at 18-
19.)  (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 3.b)
In February 2019, Applicant was arrested  with being Drunk or profane in Public
and Disorderly Conduct. He pled nolo contendere to the charges in May 2019.  (SOR ¶¶
1.e, 3.b) He states there was an unrelated altercation taking place that evening. When
the police arrested him he told them he was reacting to the other person spitting on him.
(Item 2 at 1.)
Applicant  indicated  on  his 2018  e-QIP  that  he  had  sought treatment with  an  out-
of-state   care   provider  in  2015.   (Item   3   at  39.)  He  listed   completing   his  court   required
program   in  2017.  (Item   3   at  39.)   He  asserted   that   all   these   incidences  were   part   of  a
chapter   of  his  life   when   he   was  not  mature   enough   to   fully  understand   how  poor  his
behavior was.  He stated  he  is not a  bad  person  and  was just a  young  man  doing  what  he
thought  was  ""fun""  and  in  dealing  with  the  consequences  of  his  actions  he  has  “since
matured and [does] not plan to venture down that road again.” (Item 2 at 2.)
Guideline H (cross-alleged under  Guideline  J)
Applicant denies using marijuana from about July 2015 to about December 2015,
as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.a.  On  his  June  2018  SCA  he  marked  “no”  to  using  drugs  or
controlled  substances  in  the  last  seven  years.  (Item  3  at  37.)  He  told  the  investigator
during his enhanced subject interview (ESI) on September 6, 2018, that he stopped using
marijuana  in  December  2015.  (Item  4  at  10.)  He  authenticated  the ESI  on  August  24,
2020. (Item 4 at 3.)
Applicant admits that in May 2019, he tested positive for cocaine on a urinalysis
test administered while he was on probation. (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 3.c). He was on probation for
being drunk and disorderly, the offense at SOR ¶ 1.e.
On two sperate occasions, in July 2015 and May 2019, Applicant was arrested and
charged with possession of marijuana. He later pled nolo contendere and was found guilty
on  both  occasions.  (SOR  ¶¶  2.c,  2.d,  3.c)  In  his  Answer,  he  states  he  did  not  claim
ownership of the marijuana.
As  a  general  explanation  for  his  conduct,  Applicant  asserted  that,  as  with  his
alcohol-related offenses addressed above, these incidences were part of a chapter of his
life when he was not mature enough to fully understand how poor his behavior was. (Item
2 at 2.)
Guideline J
In December 2016 Applicant was charged and later found guilty in August 2017 of
pointing a laser at a police officer. (SOR ¶ 3.a) He states it was not his intention to do any
of  this.  He  believed  there  was  a  possible  break-in  because  when  he  saw  flashlights
shining up at the neighboring townhouse windows while he was sitting on his balcony. He
states in his Answer that he shined his laser pointer to deter the suspected thieves. He
was surprised to find out that it was law enforcement and apologized to them. (Item 2 at
2.)  The  reporting  police  officer reported  that he  saw  them  and  “he  thought  it  would  be
funny to mess with us.” Item 6 at 20.)
Applicant  offered  a  letter  with  his  Answer  and  Response  documenting  his
comprehensive  outpatient  addiction  and  treatment.  (AE  B).  The  treatment  started  in
December 2020. He attended three times a week for three hours a day and he completed
29  sessions.  He  attended  and  participated  in  all  aspects  of  the  treatment,  including
random  breathalyzer  (BAI)  testing  for  alcohol  use  and  urinalysis  testing  for  drugs.  He
tested negative for alcohol and all other substances tested. His program manager noted
he had made significant progress in the areas of recognizing and managing craving, the
ability to identify emotions, and gain insight to the motivations and reasons for his past
treatment-focused,  engaged,  well-respected  and
substance  use  and  was  very
participatory in group sessions. Applicant completed the program in February 2021. (AE1)
Applicant in his Response stated he “was honestly embarrassed to see how many
charges and mishaps”  he  had to admit to.  He offered that  his Answer was made  “in a
panic”  and  he  was  looking  for  “excuses  or  small  discrepancies  in  the  contents  of  the
package  to  try  and  lighten  things  up  a  bit,”  but  as  he  went  through  the  SOR  he
acknowledged  “there  was  a  whole  lot  of  truth  written  out”  for  him  “to  finally  own.”  He
acknowledged the reports describe him during a time in life where he was a “young adult
having trouble finding [his] way.” He states these actions do not define [him] accurately
as the man [he has] grown to be.” He offers that he has taken control his life is working
on a plan to obtain a double major in cybersecurity and cloud computing. He asserts in
his Response that he is using this experience to explain to the two children that depend
on him “that your actions can and will catch up to you if you let them.”

"Applicant  is  33  years  old  and  single.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  is
currently studying for his master’s. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor
as an engineer since September 2020 and seeks to obtain national security eligibility and
a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  current  employment.  He  had  worked  for
another defense  contractor from 2013  to  2020.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Sections  12,
13A, and 17.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about  a  person’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted both allegations under this
guideline.
1.a.  Applicant  was  arrested  on  December  28,  2016,  and  charged  with  Felony
Assault with a Deadly Weapon. Applicant stated that he was extremely intoxicated that
night and does not really remember the event. However, Applicant admitted he hit another
person in the head with a glass during a bar fight. The glass broke, the other person was
injured, and Applicant was arrested. Applicant subsequently pled guilty in May 2017 to
the Assault with a Deadly Weapon charge. He was sentenced to five years of supervised
probation,  two  days  in  jail,  and  30  days  community  labor.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Section 22, Exhibit 4 at pages 10-11.)
Applicant’s probation terms included the following, as described by Applicant:
Do  not  use  or  possess  any  narcotics,  dangerous  or  restricted  drugs  or
associated  paraphernalia,  except  with  a  valid  prescription  and  stay  away
from places where users or sellers congregate. Do not associate with drug
users or sellers unless attending a drug treatment program. . . Abstain from
the  use  of  alcoholic  beverages,  including  beer  and  wine,  and  stay  out  of
places  where  they  are  the  chief  items  of  sale.  .  .  You  [Applicant]  are
specifically ordered not to use or possess any quantity of marijuana, even
with  an  otherwise  valid  prescription  or  recommendation.  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 22.)
Applicant’s  probation  ended  in  May  2022.  (Tr.  49.)  He  repeatedly  violated  the
above terms of his probation as described below.
1.b.  Applicant used illegal drugs and alcohol on a frequent basis from May 2017
through June 2019 while he was on probation for the offense set forth in 1.a, above. He
knew his conduct was in violation of his probation. Applicant admitted that he did not tell
the probation department at any time that he was violating his probation. He stated that
he discussed telling the probation department about his drug and alcohol use once he
stopped using all drugs and alcohol after June 2019. He was advised by relatives that he
should not do so, since admitting to a probation violation may require him to go to jail or
prison.  Applicant  agreed  not  to  tell  probation  personnel  about  his  conduct.  Applicant
stated that his probation officer never asked Applicant if he used drugs or alcohol during
his mandatory monthly interviews. (Government Exhibit 4 at 24-25; Tr. 52-54.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  G, Alcohol Consumption)
The  Government alleges in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for  clearance
because  he  consumes  intoxicants to  excess.  Applicant admitted  both  allegations under
this guideline.
2.a. Refer to that information set forth under subparagraph 1.a, above.
2.b.  Applicant  used  alcohol  from  May  2017 through  December  2018.  He  stated
that from about the middle of 2018 until September 2018 he consumed alcohol frequently
and excessively. During that time, as set forth under paragraph 1, above, Applicant was
on probation and required to abstain from any use of alcohol. Applicant was interviewed
by a Government investigator on March 2, 2021. The investigator’s Report of Investigation
(ROI) stated, “He [Applicant] decided to keep drinking alcohol during the time he was on
probation  because  he  had  already  violated  his  probation  at  that  time.”  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 24; Exhibit 4 at pages 12, 22-23; Tr. 54-55.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
As a preliminary matter, Applicant held a security clearance from approximately
January 2015  through March  2017.  According  to  Applicant  his clearance  was  revoked
due  to  the  criminal charges  set  forth  in  paragraph  1,  above.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Section 25.)
3.a. Applicant used marijuana on various occasions from approximately February
2003 until July 2019. As stated, between January 2015 and March 2017 Applicant was
granted access to classified information. He used marijuana daily from June to December
2018. Applicant stopped use for several months until he last used marijuana with an ex-
girlfriend in July 2019. (Government Exhibit 4 at pages 8-19.)
3.b.  Applicant  used  cocaine  on  various  occasions  from  May  2010  to  December
2018. As stated, between January 2015 and March 2017 Applicant was granted access
to  classified  information.  He  used  cocaine  weekly  during  2017.  He  used  cocaine  daily
during 2018 until his last use around New Year’s 2018/19. (Government Exhibit 4 at pages
19-20.)
3.c.  Applicant  used  cocaine  at  work  while  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  in
2018. He stated in his Answer, “I used at an unclassified site with no classified information
present, nor any secure rooms or locations present at the facility.” (Government Exhibit 4
at pages 19-20.)
3.d. Applicant used Ecstasy one time in June 2010 and a second time in July 2018.
It is further alleged that Applicant’s 2018 use of Ecstasy occurred while he was granted
access  to  classified  information.  The  record  is  unclear  as  to  whether  he  actually  had
access in July 2018. He stated in his Answer that his clearance was under reinvestigation
at that time, and he may have had an interim clearance. However, Government Exhibit 5,
a  DISS/CATS  Incident  Report,  stated  Applicant’s  “Eligibility  Level”  was  “none.”  The
document also stated, under “Eligibility Determination,” “’No Determination Made’ made
on  2019-02-11  by  DoD  CAF.”  (Internal  punctuation  added  for  clarity.)  (Government
Exhibit 4 at pages 20, 24; Tr. 51-52.) Given the state of the evidence this allegation is
found for Applicant.
3.e. Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms one time in about November 2018.
It is further alleged that Applicant’s 2018 use of hallucinogenic mushrooms occurred while
he was granted access to classified information. The record is unclear as to whether he
actually had access in July 2018. He stated in his Answer that his clearance was under
reinvestigation  at  that  time,  and  he  may  have  had  an  interim  clearance.  However,
Government Exhibit 5, a DISS/CATS Incident Report, stated Applicant’s “Eligibility Level”
was  “none.”  The  document  also  stated,  under  “Eligibility  Determination,”  “’No
Determination Made’ made on 2019-02-11 by DoD CAF.” (Internal punctuation added for
clarity.)  (Government  Exhibit  4  at  pages  20-21,  24;  Tr.  51-52.)  Given  the  state  of  the
evidence this allegation is found for Applicant.
3.f.  Applicant  admitted
that  he  used  marijuana,  cocaine,  Ecstasy  and
Hallucinogenic Mushrooms between at least May 2017 and July 2019 as set forth above.
During that period, he was prohibited from using any illegal drugs under the terms of his
probation.  He  stated  in  his  Answer  that  his  use,  including  daily  use  of  cocaine  and
marijuana,  was  because,  “I  was  under  extreme  depression  and  anxiety  due  to  the
circumstances that arose from my arrest in December 2016 as stated in subparagraph
1.a.” (Answer; Government Exhibit 4 at pages 18-21; Tr. 49.)
With regard to his drug use, as well as his alcohol use, Applicant stated that he
made a conscious decision at the end of 2018 to stop using all the substances in order to
live a better, healthier life. He also stated that his decision was the result of a religious
awakening  in  his  life.  Applicant  testified  that  his  management  is  aware  of  his  past.
However,  no  additional  information  was  forwarded  by  Applicant  from  his  current
employers setting forth the extent of their knowledge. (Government Exhibit 4 at 18; Tr.
42-48, 54-55.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  falsified  material  facts  during  the  clearance  screening  process.  In
addition, it is alleged that Applicant engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations.
Applicant admitted both allegations under this paragraph with explanations.
4.a.  The Government alleges in this subparagraph that all of the information set
forth under paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, above, is also cognizable under this guideline.
4.b. Applicant submitted an e-QIP on January 11, 2018. (Government Exhibit 2.)
Section 23 concerned Illegal Use of Drugs and Drug Activity. Applicant was specifically
asked,  “In  the  last  (7)  seven  years,  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled
substances?” Applicant answered, “Yes.” He disclosed marijuana use between 2003 and
2013,  cocaine  use  in  2010,  and  Ecstasy  use  in  2010.  These  were  false  answers  to
relevant questions about Applicant’s drug involvement. In his Answer, Applicant explained
this conduct:
Note that while I falsified information at this time, I was using alcohol and
drugs and was not applying my best judgment. The substance abuse did
create my conduct to be questionable and this is what caused me to falsify
information. Another reason was my fear of admission of substance abuse
could be reported to my probation officer and this would cause me to serve
my suspended sentence.
Applicant was forthcoming on a 2020 questionnaire and in subsequent interviews
with Government investigators. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23; Government Exhibit
4 at pages 18-21, 25; Tr. 50.)
Mitigation
The  pastor of Applicant’s church testified  on   his behalf. The  witness has known
Applicant  for  three   years.  He  testified   at  length   about  what  the   witness  views  as
Applicant’s personal growth  in the  past three  years. The  witness had  knowledge  of  the
allegations  in  the   SOR.  He  stated   that  Applicant  has  been   open   with   him   about  his
conduct  and   about   his  battle   with   alcohol  and   drugs.   Applicant   provides   substantial
financial   support   to   the   church.   The   witness  believes  Applicant   to   be   trustworthy.
(Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 17-40.)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b.  He  denied  the  SOR
allegations  in ¶¶ 1.c, 2.a and 2.b.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into the findings of
fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old. He married in 2015 for the fourth time. He has one adult
child from his first marriage and two minor children from  his third marriage. He shares
parental custody with his ex-wife. He has been employed by a federal contractor since
April 2020. (Transcript (Tr.) 14-19, 60-62)
In  February  1995,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while  ability
impaired  with  a  blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  over  .05%  but  less  than  .08%  and
driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was found guilty of DUI. Applicant testified
that he was with friends watching a football game over three to four hours and consumed
some alcohol. He then drove and another car lost control and collided with Applicant head
on.  He  admitted  to  the  police  that  he  had  consumed  alcohol  and  a  breathalyzer  was
administered, which recorded his BAC. The actual BAC is unknown, but it was less than
.08%. Applicant has not had any other alcohol-related incidents. (Tr. 20-21)
Applicant saw his same family doctor from 2010 to 2020 until he moved to a new
state. In approximately 2014, Applicant began experiencing anxiety. He was in a stressful
job that required him to dismiss other employees. He said it was not the job he had agreed
to when he was hired. The stress of the job was affecting his health. He was treated by
his family doctor and diagnosed with general anxiety. He was prescribed medication in
2014, which helped relieve his symptoms. When the stressors diminished, he felt better.
Although he saw his family doctor on a regular basis, his appointments were not always
related to stress, but were also for other medical reasons. Applicant credibly testified that
he was not treated for anxiety from 2014 to 2019 as is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, but rather
acute situations periodically created stress and anxiety which were then treated. These
were not chronic conditions but more related to situational factors. When the stressors
decreased, his anxiety diminished. (Tr. 31-33)
In  May  2017,  Applicant  recognized  he  was  consuming  too  much  alcohol  and
voluntarily sought treatment. He attributed his consumption to a period when he and his
ex-wife were dealing with custody of their children. He shared custody of his children with
his ex-wife and had the children every other week. For a period, his older child lived with
him. His ex-wife’s husband was transferred to a new location and visitation became more
difficult for him. Applicant was close to his children and missed them. He credibly testified
that the family court ruled that both parents were fit to have legal custody of the children.
However,  due  to  his  ex-wife’s  geographical  move,  he  asked  his  children  where  they
wanted to live, and they chose to stay with their mother. Applicant continues to visit them
regularly, and they have a good relationship. (Tr. 22-25, 38; GE 4, 5)
Applicant voluntarily admitted himself into a five-day detoxification program in May
2017.  He  was  diagnosed  with  Alcohol  Dependence.  He  testified  that  he  started
consuming alcohol and he gradually increased the amount he was consuming up to a full
bottle of alcohol a day before he sought treatment. He admitted he was a heavy drinker
for about a year before admitting himself to the detoxification program. He testified that
he was physically dependent on alcohol when he entered the program.  He said that at
the recommendation of the treatment center, he participated in outpatient treatment for
six  months  until  the  program  was  completed.  He  participated  in  Alcoholic  Anonymous
(AA) as part of the after-care program. He went to two to three meetings a week at the
time. He has not participated in AA since then. He said it was not the right program for
him. He stated that as the physical dependence decreased, his depression improved, and
alcohol was no longer an issue. (Tr. 25-26, 38-44, 54-55; GE 4, 5)
Applicant testified that he abstained from alcohol consumption for about six months
after the detoxification program. He then occasionally had a drink if he was on vacation
or having a special dinner, but he was not consuming it daily. He no longer craved it. He
established a moderate drinking pattern. (Tr. 26)
Applicant was on medical leave from his job for anxiety prior to May 2016.When
his medical leave was terminated, he was unemployed until May 2017. He said he did not
drink  while  he  was  working.  He  was  terminated  from  his  job  because  he  was  taking
medical leave related to anxiety and the stressors associated with the expectations of the
job, which he could not perform. He admitted that when he was denied further medical
leave, it likely had an impact on his drinking. (Tr. 44-45)
In 2019, Applicant requested medical leave from his employer related to the stress
and anxiety  that he  was  experiencing due to  custody issues with his children.  He was
also moving to a new state for a position that was a significant distance from where his
children were living. He attempted to work remotely to be closer to his children, but his
request was denied. Applicant testified that in the past he has used alcohol to manage
depression,  anxiety,  stress,  and  physical  pain.  He  has  learned  from  his past  mistakes
when he tried to resolve his problems by himself. He now knows when he needs to reach
out for help. He recognizes the triggers that impact his decisions and he attended therapy
during his child custody case. He is presently not participating in treatment. (Tr. 30-31,
56-57)
In late 2021, Applicant was experiencing a serious physical medical condition and
he was using alcohol to relieve the pain for about two to three months in the evenings to
help him sleep. He admitted he was self-medicating. He said his doctor was aware that
he  was  consuming  alcohol.  His  doctor  did  not  believe  he  was  becoming  physically
dependent on alcohol but concurred the amount of alcohol he was consuming at the time
was excessive. (Tr. 47-50, 62-65; GE 3)
In  December  2021,  Applicant  had  surgery  for  his  medical  condition.  He  did  not
consume  alcohol  for  four  months  after  the  surgery.  Upon  a  follow-up  medical
appointment, he was told by his doctor that he could consume alcohol periodically, but
not on a regular basis because it would have a negative effect on his medical condition.
He  subsequently  consumed  alcohol  while  on  vacation.  He  testified  that  he  had  also
consumed one drink on a few other occasions, and it was a low alcohol-content beer. He
later  had  additional  medical  tests,  and  the  doctor  told  him  that  given  his  autoimmune
disorder, it would be better for his health to completely abstain from alcohol consumption.
Subsequently,  he  has  not  had  alcohol  since  May  2022.  His  wife  no  longer  consumes
alcohol. They do not have alcohol in the house. (Tr. 27-31, 50-52, 58-60; GE 3)
Applicant testified that he has found outlets to help him reduce stress. He now lives
in an area that is not as demanding. He and his wife have found a core group of friends
that are a support group, which he previously did not have. They are  also an important
social circle for him and his wife. He can talk to intimately to this group, which helps him
from internalizing issues. He has taken up woodworking and other hobbies which provide
significant help in reducing his stress. (Tr. 68-70)
Applicant testified that he does not believe he is an alcoholic, but admits he abused
alcohol in the past, and his excessive use was triggered by stressful events in his life, for
which he sought help. (Tr. 38-39)
In November 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist, Dr. B. She
indicated that based on her interview, available medical records, a security investigation
file, and psychological screening that Applicant met the criteria for alcohol use disorder,
mild; major depressive disorder; panic disorder; anxiety; and narcissistic personality. The
latter she noted likely contributed to work-related difficulties. She noted he had a history
of severe alcohol use disorder, continued to consume alcohol, and he was not currently
participating  in  treatment.  She  noted  that  Applicant’s  statements  suggested  he  was
unwilling  to  acknowledge  the  psychological  components  of  his  use  disorder,  despite
statements that it was a “coping mechanism.” She opined that Applicant was unlikely to
be able to safeguard sensitive information and his judgment was poor. She opined that
Applicant appeared deceptive and dishonest and his prognosis was poor. (GE 2)
Applicant credibly testified  that  Dr. B.’s medical evaluation  consisted  of a  60-to-90-
minute  ZOOM  conference  call  during  which  the  video  connection  was disrupted, jumpy
and  choppy,  and  would  break  up  several times.  The  audio  on  the  ZOOM  call  did  not work,
so  Dr. B  had  Applicant call  her on  the  telephone. Dr. B  made  no  mention  of the  intermittent
difficulties  with   the   video   or  audio   connection   during   the   evaluation   and   its  potential
negative impact on her personal observations  of Applicant.  (Tr. 34-35, 70-71)  Of interest
was Dr. B’s comment:
He was observed to take long pauses and reduce eye contact once he was
repeatedly asked to respond to the question at hand. He also chuckled at
nearly  all  questions  presented,  despite  the  fact  that  the  questions  were
direct  and  non-humorous.  His  presentation  was  consistent  with  that  of
patients  attempting  to  present  as  self-assured,  though  actually  quite
insecure and manipulative to those around him. (GE 2)
Applicant testified that due to the connectivity difficulty with the ZOOM evaluation
and being generally nervous about having a psychological evaluation that he likely was
not his normal self. (Tr. 35-37)
Dr. B had Applicant take the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). She stated
the following:
Validity scales indicated  that [Applicant]  was consistent and  honest  in his
response  style.  This indicated  that the  consequent profile is a   reasonable
depiction   of  the   applicant’s  self-appraisal.  There  were   no   indications  of
psychological impairment on  the  PAI clinical profile. His responses indicate
that  [Applicant’s] interests/motivation  for treatment is  comparable  to  that  of
adults who  are  not being  seen  in a  therapeutic setting.  Moreover, his level
of  treatment  motivation   is  somewhat  lower  than   is  typical  of  individuals
being  seen  in  treatment settings.  His responses suggest  that he  is satisfied
with himself as he is, that he is not experiencing marked distress, and that,
as a result, he sees little need  for changes in  his behavior.
Based on his responses, his interpersonal style seems best characterized
as  self-assured,  confident,  and  dominant.  Although  not  unfriendly,  he  is
likely  to  be  described  by  others  as  ambitious  and  having  a  “leader-like”
demeanor.  He  is  comfortable  in  social  settings,  but  is  not  likely  to  mix
indiscriminately, preferring to interact with others in situations over which he
can exercise some measure of control. (GE 2)
Dr.  B  noted  in  her  report  that  Applicant  was  not  able  to  obtain  custody  of  his
children. Her statement is inaccurate. Applicant has always had joint legal custody of his
children and continues to do so. He is involved in their lives and  participates with their
mother in decision-making for the children. (Tr. 35-36; GE 2).
Dr. B’s comments under her diagnostic impressions, note that Applicant met the
criteria for alcohol use disorder, mild, and commented “at the very least.” She noted that
it was based  on  Applicant’s self-assessment, but she found he lacked candor. He was
not  in  treatment  and  did  not  acknowledge  he  was  an  alcoholic.  She  believed  he  was
unwilling to acknowledge the components of his alcohol use disorder and his insight was
limited. She found he was “unlikely to be a reliable employee, as his work history shows.”
She determined his judgment was poor and he “appears deceptive and dishonest, putting
his trustworthiness in question” and his prognosis is “very poor.” (GE 2)
Applicant’s wife testified on his behalf. She has known Applicant since 2014. She
confirmed that Applicant does not have a current issue with alcohol. They have attempted
to reduce their stress and since moving to a new state they have been successful. She
confirmed  he  has  found  activities  to  help  him.  In  2017,  she  was  concerned  about  his
alcohol consumption, but was satisfied when he voluntarily went through detoxification.
She recognized that he had issues with anxiety, depression, and alcohol in the past, but
stated that he has addressed them. She has read the psychological report by Dr. B and
emphatically  disagrees  with  her  assessment,  especially  the  narcissism  diagnosis.  She
said the Applicant goes out of his way to be nice and puts her before himself. He strives
to do the right thing. They have a happy home and take care of each other. She and her
husband no longer consume alcohol and there is none in their home. (Tr. 74-85)
Applicant’s father testified. He acknowledged that Applicant addressed his issues
with  alcohol,  and  it  has  not  been  a  problem  in  the  past  couple  of  years.  He  believes
Applicant’s mental health  is good. He was aware  that Applicant went through a difficult
time when he was dealing with custody issues. (Tr. 87-90)
A  friend  of Applicant’s  testified  on  his behalf. They worked together at one time
and are good friends. He is aware that Applicant is applying for a security clearance. He
has no concerns about granting him access. (Tr. 91-95)
",True
"In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  some  of  the  Guideline  G  allegations  in  the
SOR  and  denied  others.  He  failed  to  either admit  or  deny  the  Guideline  J  allegations.
Since the underlying allegations are the same under both Guidelines, he is deemed to
have  admitted  and  denied  the  same  allegations  under  Guideline  J  as  he  did  for
Guideline G. He admitted the Guideline B allegation, with explanations. His admissions
are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  testimony,
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  63  years  old.  He  is  divorced  and  has  two  adult  children.  He  is
currently  employed  by  a  government  contractor.  He  has  worked  for  different
government  or  defense  contractors  as  a  power  plant  technician  on  various  contracts
over the years, dating back to 2010.  Many of these contracts required his presence in
combat  zones,  such  as  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  He  was  honorably  discharged  from  the
Marine  Corps  after  serving  from  1979  to  1985.  He  has  three  associate’s  degrees.  He
held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps and at various times  while serving
as a government-contractor employee. (Tr. 7, 32-34, 39, 41; GE 1; AE A)
The SOR alleged Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) on
eight  occasions:  May 1986;  January 1989; April 1990;  April 1993;  January  2000; April
2001;  February  2002;  and  November  2019.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.h)  Department  Counsel
moved to withdraw the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. That motion was granted
and  those  withdrawals  will  be  reflected  in  my  formal  findings.  This  conduct  was  also
alleged as criminal conduct under Guideline J in the SOR. (SOR ¶ 2.a) Finally, the SOR
alleged that Applicant had a girlfriend who is a resident and citizen of Ethiopia, and for
whom he provided financial support. (SOR ¶ 3.a)
Applicant began drinking alcohol approximately two  times a week when he was
18 or 19 years old after he joined the Marine Corps. In his early 20s to 30s, his alcohol
consumption  increased  to  about  three  to  four  times  a  week.  He  stated  that  during  the
last 10 to 15 years, his alcohol consumption has decreased. He admitted that he would
often drink and become  “buzzed.”  He would drive while  he was ‘buzzed.”  He admitted
driving while drunk more times than when he was arrested. He claimed that he did not
drink  to  intoxication  between  2002  and  2019.  He  also  claimed  the  last  time  he  drank
alcohol was when he was arrested for DWI in November 2019. (Tr. 43-50)
The details of his arrests follow:
May  1986  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.a)-Applicant  testified  that  he  and  friends  were  at  the
beach where he  had four to five beers. He  drove back home from the beach and was
stopped by law enforcement  for a traffic violation. He admitted this arrest  for DWI and
he  claimed  the  charge  was  later  reduced  to  reckless  driving.  He  was  drinking  alcohol
about four times a week at that time in his life. (Tr. 51-52; GE 3-4; SOR answer)
January  1989  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.b)-Applicant  testified  that  he  had  been  at  a party
until  about  4:00  am  and  then  drove  home.  He  was  stopped  by  law  enforcement  for
speeding  and  weaving.  He  was  administered  field  sobriety  tests,  which  he  failed.  He
was  arrested  for  DWI  and  refused  to  take  a  breath  test.  Applicant  admitted  pleading
guilty to a misdemeanor DWI and was sentenced to two years’ probation and fined. (Tr.
53-54; GE 3-5 (pp. 6-7); SOR answer)
April  1993  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.d)-Applicant  denied  this  arrest  in  his  answer  but
admitted  it  during  his  hearing  testimony.  Applicant  was  stopped  by  law  enforcement
after nearly colliding with a police vehicle when entering a service road. Applicant was
observed  by officers to  stagger,  lean on his  vehicle  for  support,  wobble  while  walking,
exhibit  slow  depressed  reflexes,  and  have  “thick”  speech.  Applicant  also  became
belligerent toward the responding officers, which resulted in him being handcuffed. After
transportation  to  the  station,  Applicant  was  administered  field  sobriety  tests.  He
admitted drinking two beers at home. A breath test determined his blood alcohol content
at 0.11, over the legal limit of 0.08. All Applicant’s actions at the police station related to
this arrest were videotaped. He was arrested for DWI. He pleaded not guilty in court but
was convicted of a DWI first offense in September 1993 and received a sentence of two
years’ probation and a fine. (Tr. 59-65; GE 5 (pp.- 1-3); SOR answer)
February 2002  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.g)-Applicant denied  this arrest  in his  answer  but
admitted it during his hearing testimony. He did not recall the details of this arrest. Court
documents reveal that he pleaded guilty and was convicted of DWI in September 2002.
(Tr. 71-72; GE 3 (pp. 10-11); SOR answer)
November  2019   DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.h)-Applicant   admitted   this  arrest  in   both  his
answer  and   his  hearing   testimony.  Applicant  testified   that  he   had   just   returned   from
Afghanistan   and   went   to   a   sports   bar  where   he   had   one   beer.  In   his  SOR  answer   he
admitted  drinking  two  beers. He  was arrested  and  changed  with  DWI-3rd, a  third  degree
felony.   No  police   reports  or  court   disposition   documents  are   in  the   record.  Applicant
claimed   he   pleaded   guilty  to   a   misdemeanor  DWI  charge   and   received   a   sentence   of
probation.  Applicant  presented   documentation   from   his  probation   officer  that  he
complied  with  all  the  conditions of his probation, had  no  probation  violations, and  paid
all   of  his  financial  obligations.  His  probation   terminated   with   him   in   good   standing   in
June  2022. (Tr.  72-76;  GE 3  (p 12); SOR Answer; AE B, E)
Applicant listed in his 2020 security clearance application (SCA) attending court-
ordered alcohol counseling in 1990 and 2001, but he did not supply any documentation
about  either  program  or  detail  what  was  involved  with  these  programs,  in  terms  of
diagnoses, prognoses, or treatment plans. (GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  he  does  not  consider  himself  an  alcoholic,  rather  he  is
“just a person that had bad luck.” He claims to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) about
once a month, but he admitted that he does not have sponsor, nor does he work the AA
12-step  program  recommended  for  recovering  alcoholics.  He  also  claims  he  has  no
further interest in consuming alcohol. As an example, he cited that he recently attended
a family gathering where alcohol was present, but he did not consume any. (Tr. 78-81,
90)
The Guideline B allegation concerns Applicant’s relationship with a woman who
is a citizen and resident of Ethiopia. He admitted having a relationship with this woman
and providing her financial support. He was in contact with her from approximately 2017
to  2019.  He  met  her  when  he  was  in  Ethiopia,  and  she  was  a  receptionist  at  a  hotel.
From 2017  to 2019, he  provided her with approximately $1,000 per month to help  her
and her family. During this time, he was in contact with her on a weekly basis. He visited
her in Ethiopia on several occasions. The last time he was in Ethiopia was in 2019. He
ended  his  relationship  with  this  woman  in  approximately  June  2019,  when  he  came
back to the United States after his job in  Southwest Asia ended. The last contact with
her  was  in  June 2019. The  last  financial support he provided  was  in  August  2019. He
has  no  intentions  of  contacting  her,  seeing  her,  or  providing  any  additional  financial
assistance to her in the future. (Tr. 81-88)
Applicant  presented  six  character  letters  from  friends  and  colleagues.  They
describe  Applicant  as  responsible  and  someone  who  is  dedicated,  hard-working,  and
who  has  high  character.  Several  recommend  continuation  of  his  security  clearance.
Applicant  also  presented  several  awards,  certificates,  and  pictures  demonstrating  his
service to the country over the years. (AE C-D)

"Applicant is 41 years old, divorced, and has one minor child. He graduated from
high school and attended some college classes. Since September 2019 he has worked
for a DoD contractor performing inventory duties. He is a first-time applicant for national
security  eligibility.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment. (Tr. at 7, 20-24.)
Paragraph 1 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations
is
financially  overextended  and
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
lists one medical debt and two tax debts, both for tax year (TY) 2017 (Federal and state).
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) and denied the two tax
debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c). (Answer at 1-2.)
Applicant  testified   about  his  income   and   expenses.  He  is  able   to   pay  all   of  his
monthly  expenses   and   child   support.  He   tries  to   save   about   $800   per  month.   He   has
about $3,000  in savings and  about $14,000  in his employer’s 401K  account.  (Tr. at 24-
28.)
The current status of the debts alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR is as follows:
1.a.   Medical   debt   in   collection   in   the   approximate   amount   of   $31,688.  This
debt arose  after Applicant was in  a  car accident in 2016. He was taken  by helicopter from
the   accident   scene   to   a   large   city  hospital  for   emergency  care.  The   cost  of  the
transportation  expense  was not covered  by his insurance. In  2020  Applicant  settled  the
debt for $6,000 and paid it with monthly payments.  In November 2020 he  made an initial
payment  of  $265.  Thereafter, he  made  weekly payments  of  $65. He  provided  a  record
from   the   creditor  evidencing   each   payment,   along   with   a   final  payment  of  $2,953   on
November 5,  2021.  He   made   the   final payment  with   funds   from   a  tax  refund.  His  total
payments  were  $6,338. He also  provided  a  letter from  the  creditor stating  that this debt
had  been  paid  in full  and  the  account was closed. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 29-34;  GE
3 at 4; GE 4 at 2; AE B; AE C.)
1.b.  Federal  tax  debt  for  TY  2017  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $4,961.
Applicant acknowledged that he owed the IRS additional taxes for TY 2017. He testified
that this debt was paid through his tax refunds in subsequent years. He provided letters
from his tax preparer bearing the date  of December 29, 2022, which was the date the
letters were reprinted for purposes of submission in this security clearance proceeding.
The annual letters summarize Applicant’s tax status and cover TYs 2014 through 2021.
The letters state that Applicant was due refunds from the IRS for every year except TY
2017,  when  he  owed  an  additional  tax  of  $4,637.  Applicant  volunteered  in  his  initial
security interview on March 21, 2019, that he owed the IRS about $4,000 for TY 2017.
Additional taxes were owed that year because he withdrew funds from his 401K due to
losing his job in 2017 and he was unemployed for a period. Applicant relied upon his 401k
trustee to withhold sufficient taxes at the time of the withdrawal and the  funds withheld
and paid to the IRS and the state proved to be insufficient. As of the date of his security
interview, Applicant had not paid the tax, but he subsequently learned that his tax refunds
for TYs 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, which totaled about $6,300, were applied to his TY
2017 tax debt rather than paid to him as refunds. Applicant believes that this tax debt has
been  fully  satisfied.  He  was  unable  to  provide  an  account  transcript  from  the  IRS  to
confirm  the  payment  of  this  tax  debt  because  he  does  not  possess  the  necessary
identifying information, such as a credit card or any other required document, to open an
online account with the IRS. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 34-42; GE 2 at 6; AE A at 2-6.)
1.c.   State  tax   debt   for  TY   2017   in  the   approximate  amount   of   $1,944.
Applicant’s  state  issued  a  garnishment  of  his  wages  in  August  2019  to  pay  this  debt.
Applicant decided  to  pay the  debt through  deductions from  his paycheck. The  debt was
initially  paid by wage  garnishments. At some  point, Applicant entered  into  a  payment plan
with  the  state  to  pay the  balance  of his tax debt.  He  paid  it off  before  2022. He  presented
a  copy of a  state  tax refund  check, dated  October 25, 2022, he  received  for TY 2021,
which  evidences that he  owed  no  additional taxes to  the  state  at that point. This debt is
resolved.  (Tr. at 41-43; GE 7; AE A at 1.)
Paragraph 2 - Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant has a history of excessive
alcohol consumption, which raises security concerns because his drinking can lead to the
exercise  of  questionable  judgment  or  the  failure  to  control  impulses.  The  Government
also alleged that Applicant’s alcohol consumption can raise questions about his reliability
and  trustworthiness.  Specifically,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  consumed
alcohol during a period he was also taking Hydrocodone, a pain killer, which was against
medical advice; that he was treated at a medical facility after a possible suicide attempt
that  involved  alcohol;  that  he  was  charged  with  Driving  Under  the  Influence  (DUI)  of
alcohol; and that he continued to drink alcohol to intoxication. In the Answer, Applicant
admitted the four allegations (SOR ¶¶ 2.a- 2.d) with two explanations.
Applicant  testified   that  he   stopped   drinking   alcohol  on   January  30,   2022,  He
stopped drinking “cold turkey” because  he felt that alcohol was toxic and  he did not want
to  consume  it any more. He also stopped  dating  a  woman  who  wanted  to  go  out  to  bars
and  drink alcohol. He is happier and  his child  is happier that  he  has stopped  drinking. He
has no intention of ever drinking  alcohol again. (Tr. at 43-44.)
2.a. Alcohol consumption with Hydrocodone. Applicant admitted in the Answer
that during the period from August 2012 to June 2015, he drank alcohol while taking the
prescription medication Hydrocodone even though that was against his doctor’s advice.
He explained that during that time period, he had two back surgeries and was suffering
from a lot of pain. He found that combining alcohol with this painkiller medication helped
reduce  his  pain  and  made  him  more  mobile.  In  or  about  late  2015  or  2016,  Applicant
stopped taking Hydrocodone. As discussed below, he was in a bad car accident in 2016
and he refused to take any pain killers. He testified that he presently only takes two Advil
capsules for pain. (Tr. at 44-45, 50.)
2.b.  Suicide   attempt  while   intoxicated.   In   August  2016,  Applicant   had   a   bad
evening  at home  due  to  being  upset  about  his recent divorce and  being  unhappy with  his
relationship  with  a  woman  he  was  dating.  Applicant’s brother came  to  check  on  him  and
found him intoxicated  and with  a knife in his hand. He had self-inflicted cuts on  his arms.
His brother called  the  police, and  Applicant testified  that he  agreed  to  go  with  them  to  a
stabilization  facility for  a  brief hold  to  make  sure he  would not  commit  any serious self
harm.  Applicant  does  not  believe   than   any  prescription   pain  pills  were   involved   in  this
incident, just  alcohol. Applicant has  subsequently committed  himself to  eliminating  toxicity
in his life  and  the  people  around  him  who  cause  it. He has had  no  suicidal ideations since
that evening  and has not engaged in any  further self harm.  (Tr. at 45-47, 50-51.)
2.c.  DUI  arrest  and  charges.  In  October  2016,  Applicant  was  arrested  and
charged with DUI. His girlfriend at that time was driving, and she had a bad accident. Her
driver’s license had been suspended, and she had been drinking. She told the police that
Applicant was driving. He was intoxicated at the time and went along with the girlfriend’s
story. He was actually in the passenger seat at the time of the accident and hit his head
the front windshield so hard, he lost consciousness. He was taken by helicopter to a large
city hospital where he regained consciousness. He hired a lawyer and a collision expert.
The expert convinced the prosecutor that Applicant was in the passenger seat at the time
of the accident. The charges were dropped. (Tr. at 47-50.)
2.d. Continued  excessive  alcohol consumption. The  Government alleged  that
Applicant continued  to  drink excessively until at least December 2020. Applicant admitted
in  the   Answer that   he  did  continue  to  drink,  but only “a   couple   of   beers”   at  a   time.   He
denied  any  excessive drinking  in  recent  years, and,  as  noted,  he  stopped  drinking  entirely
in January 2022. (Tr.at 48-49.)
Paragraph 3 – Guideline I, Psychological Conditions
3.a. Alcohol consumption with Hydrocodone. The Government cross-alleged
its allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a in SOR ¶ 3.a under Guideline I. Department Counsel was at a
loss to explain the Government’s theory of this allegation and did not ask any questions
or make any argument based upon the alleged facts under this guideline. (Tr. at 55, 65,
71.)
Paragraph 4 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct
In paragraph 4 of the SOR, the Government alleged numerous acts of misconduct
by Applicant, including four falsification allegations. In his Answer, Applicant denied the
falsification allegations with one exception. The Government also cross-alleged his debts
set forth in paragraph 1 and the alcohol consumption allegations in paragraph 2. (Answer
at 3.)
The details regarding each of the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 4 are as
follows:
4.a.  Falsification  of  e-QIP  question  in  Section  26  regarding  unpaid  taxes.
Applicant testified that to his knowledge, he was paying his Federal and state taxes and
the appropriate answer was to write “No,” he did not fail to pay his taxes. He thought he
was answering the question truthfully. During his security interview about one month after
he  submitted the e-QIP,  Applicant  “volunteered” that he  had  a  federal tax  bill of about
$4,000 and that he had plans to pay the past-due taxes. In a follow-up interview, he stated
that he had not failed to pay his taxes, he merely “short paid,” i.e., under withheld the full
amount of the taxes due. (Tr. at 54, 58-59; GE 2 at 6, 9.)
4.b.  Falsification  of  e-QIP  Question  regarding  financial  delinquencies.
Applicant admitted this allegation. He testified that when he prepared the e-QIP he was
told by others to only provide what he had to. The co-workers who gave him that advice
were older employees who had worked at this company for a long time and had retired.
Applicant was told that he was just an entry-level laborer, and he did not need to worry
about the details like listing his debts. He admitted he did not take the process seriously.
He  has   since   received   a   promotion   and   has  a   better  understanding   of  the   security
clearance  process  and  the  importance  of total honesty in preparing  a  security clearance
application.  He  learned  from  the  security interview process  that  the  advice  he  was  given
was wrong   and  that “even  if  you   are  at the  bottom  of the   food   chain,  it’s very serious.”
With  his promotion  and  his work  in the  inventory field,  he  understands the  sensitivity of
the   information   with   which  he   works.  He  said,  “I  100%  get   it.”  If   he   was  filling   out   the
application  for a  security clearance  today,  he  would provide  even  more information  than
what was asked. (Tr.at 54-57.)
In  his  initial  security  interview  about  one  month  after  he  submitted  his  e-QIP,
Applicant “volunteered” that he had two tax debts and a debt in collection for helicopter
transportation services following a serious accident in 2016. (GE 2 at 6-7.)
4.c.  Falsification of  e-QIP  Section 24  question regarding alcohol treatment or
counseling. Applicant was advised  by older workers that he  should  not disclose  his  brief
stay at the  stabilization  facility  in response  to  the  questions in Section  24  about alcohol
treatment.   He   did   not   want   to   disclose   that   experience,   but   he   also   did   not   view   the
services he  received  there as counseling  or treatment.  He  thought he  was  there to  “just
sleep  it off.” When  he  woke  up  there, he  thought the  facility was just  a  “drunk tank”  to  hold
people while they sober up.  He was only there  overnight and  was released  in  the  morning.
The  reason  Applicant was being  held  at  the   stabilization  facility was to  determine  if he
potentially posed  a  threat  to  himself.  If  he  was not a  threat,  the  facility had  to  release  him,
which   is  what  happened   the   next  morning.  He  did  not  understand   that  this  was  a
counseling  or treatment facility.  He  thought  his answer was  truthful.  (Tr. at  58-59,  61-62.)
4.d.  Deliberate Omission during March 21, 2019  security  interview regarding
treatment at  the  stabilization facility. In  his Answer  Applicant denied  the  allegation  and
wrote  I  “did  not deliberately omit  [this information],  I  wasn’t  aware  that I  had  to  [disclose
it.].”  The   information   he   failed   to   disclose   was  the   self-inflicted   cuts  and   his   suicidal
ideation  that  evening. At his security interview, he  came  to  realize  that his experience  at
the  stabilization  facility could be  viewed  as  a  hospitalization  for a  mental health  condition,
and  he  volunteered  information  to  the  investigator about what happened  to  him  that night
at  his   home   and   at   the   stabilization   facility.  Department  Counsel  conceded   that
Applicant’s  disclosures  were  significant  and  that  any  facts not  discussed  did  not  rise  to
the  level of  a  security-significant  omission  of  material facts  (Answer at 3; Tr.  at  59-66;  GE
2 at 3-4.)
.
4.e.  Cross-allegation  of  the  financial considerations  allegations in paragraph
1. Department  Counsel  did  not pursue  this allegation  at  the  hearing.  The  allegation  has
no   merit.   The   issues  relating   to   Applicant’s  financial  consideration   are  fully  addressed
under  Guideline   F  and   do   not  raise   separate   issues  of   misconduct  cognizable  under
Guideline E.  (Tr. at 61-65.)
4.f. Cross-allegation of  the  alcohol  consumption allegations in  paragraph 2.
Department Counsel  did not pursue  this allegation  at the  hearing. The  allegation  has no
merit.  The  issues  relating  to  Applicant’s  past  alcohol  consumption  are  fully  addressed
under  Guideline  G  and  do  not  raise  separate  issues  of  misconduct  cognizable  under
Guideline E. (Tr. at 61-65.)

"Applicant  is  a  25-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  June  2019.  He  received  a  high  school  diploma  in  2015.  He  has  never
been  married  and  has  no  children.  He  served  on  active  duty  with  the  Army  from  April
2016  until  May  2019  when  he  received  a  general  discharge  for  misconduct.  (Items  3,
10)
Within the last five years, Applicant began having issues with alcohol. When he
returned from Army deployments, he was finishing a bottle of tequila in one or two days
to deal with stress. In June or July 2018, after speaking about his alcohol use with his
non-commissioned  officer  (NCO),  he  enrolled  in  the  Army’s  Substance  Use  Disorder
Clinical Care (SUDCC). His NCO gave him the choice of self-enrolling in SUDCC, or his
NCO  would  refer  him.  While  he  was  enrolled  in  SUDCC,  he  was  required  to  abstain
from consuming alcohol. He met with his SUDCC counselor once every two weeks from
June  or  July  2018  until  he  stopped  his  SUDCC  treatment  in  May  2019  when  he  was
discharged  from  the  Army.  He  provided  no  evidence  that  he  has  undergone  any
alcohol-related  treatment  since  May  2019.  He  did  not  complete  the  SUDCC  treatment
program, but in October 2018, he completed a portion of that treatment called Prime for
Life. There is no evidence as to what treatment or counseling the Prime for Life portion
of the SUDCC entailed. (Items 2, 3, 6, 9, 10)
In  about  November  2018,  while  he  was  attending  SUDCC  treatment  and  was
required to abstain from alcohol, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under
the influence of alcohol (DUI) in State A. He had been consuming wine, tequila, and rum
at  a  social  gathering  until  he  blacked  out.  While  he  was  blacked  out  from  being
intoxicated, he drove his car and “wrecked the car between a tree and a boat dock near
a lake.”  Police gave him a breathalyzer test some hours after he had stopped drinking
and he had a .13 blood alcohol content (BAC) percentage. He spent two days in jail. As
part  of  a  plea  agreement,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  a  lesser  charge  of  reckless  driving.
Applicant  paid  fines  and  attended  a  court-ordered  Mothers  Against  Drunk  Driving
(MADD) meeting. He also received an official memorandum of reprimand from his Army
command.  He  continued  to  attend  treatment  with  SUDCC  after  his  November  2018
arrest, when he was again required to abstain from alcohol. (Items 2-6, 9, 10)
In  about  March  2019,  while  Applicant  was  undergoing  SUDCC  treatment  and
required to abstain from alcohol, he was arrested and charged with DUI in State B. He
had  been  drinking  alcohol  at  a  cookout  the  day  before  his  arrest.  He  claimed  that  he
initially did not know the punch he was drinking at the cookout was laced with alcohol,
but  he  acknowledged  that  he  realized  it  had  alcohol  in  it  that  night  when  he  became
intoxicated.  The  next morning,  he  drove  to work  on  base  and  was  stopped  by  military
police  for  swerving.  He  claimed  that  he  was  trying  to  avoid  potholes  because  he  was
driving a friend’s car. He failed field sobriety tests and was issued a breathalyzer test at
about 9:00 a.m., the results of which were a .13 BAC percentage. He pleaded guilty to
DUI. The court sentenced him to 12 months of probation, suspended his driver’s license
in State B, and ordered him to perform 24 hours of community service. Because he was
intoxicated while on duty, the Army charged him under Article 112 of the Uniform Code
of Military Justice (UCMJ). On April 9, 2019, he was found guilty of that UCMJ charge.
As  a  result  of  his  failure  to  follow  SUDCC  requirements,  his  DUIs,  and  his  UCMJ
charges, he was administratively separated from the Army in May 2019 for misconduct.
Despite being alleged in the SOR, there is no evidence that Applicant’s March 2019 DUI
involved personal injury. (Items 2, 3, 7-10)

from  his
In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  diagnosed  with
alcohol  use  disorder  (moderate)  and  that  the  treatment  providers  at  SUDCC  advised
him  to  abstain  from  alcohol.  In  February  2020,  he  stated  that  he  planned  to  remove
drinking

life.  Notwithstanding
recommendation,  and  his  earlier  plans  to  abstain  from  alcohol,  in  his  response  to  the
SOR, he stated that he believes that he can continue consuming alcohol in a modified
manner  because  quitting  “cold  turkey”  is  not  the  best  option  for  everyone.  Applicant
claimed  that  he  drinks  beer  about  two  to  three  times  per  month.  He  has  also  claimed
that he drinks about one or two beers two to three times every two weeks. He claimed
that he tries to stay away from liquor. He cites to his three years of not having alcohol-
related legal issues as evidence that his modified consumption plan is working. He also
claimed that he was named employee of the month at his job, he has been able to buy a
house, and he has no financial problems. (Items 2, 9, 10)

In  about  August  2018,  Applicant  was  charged  with  larceny  in  State  B  when  he
took an audio cable from a store without paying for it. He claimed he attached the cable
to see if it fit his phone while he was in the store, accidentally put the cable in his pocket
when he was done using it, forgot that the cable was in his pocket, and then walked out
of  the  store  without  paying  for  it.  The  charges  against  him  were  ultimately  dropped.

2007,  he  joined  the  Army  National  Guard,  and  he  continues  his military  service  to  the
present time. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2010. He married in March 2011 and his
divorce was finalized in August 2019. He has a daughter, age 12. Since October 2014,
he  has  been  employed  by  a  federal  contractor  as  a  systems  technician.  He  has
possessed a DOD security clearance since approximately 2014. (Item 3)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is indebted to 14 creditors for
delinquent  accounts  totaling  approximately  $64,400.  Applicant’s  admissions  and  the
credit bureau reports in evidence support the SOR Guideline F allegations.
Applicant  completed  his security  clearance application  (SCA) in  February 2020,
and he disclosed one delinquent personal loan in the amount of $5,000. During his April
2020  background  interview,  Applicant  told  the  authorized  DOD  investigator  that  his
security clearance was administratively suspended in February 2020 because he had not
turned  in  a  completed  SCA,  as  requested.  Once  he  turned  in  the  SCA,  his  security
clearance was reinstated in March 2020. He also told the investigator that his wages were
being garnished by another creditor in the amount of about $900 monthly. When asked
about  any  other  delinquent  accounts,  Applicant  stated  that  he  was  unable  to  collect
enough information on his delinquent debts due to the limited amount of time he had to
turn in his SCA. (Item 4)
The  investigator confronted  Applicant  with  several outstanding accounts  obtained
from  a  credit  report.  Applicant  stated  that  beginning  in  2015, he  traveled  frequently out-
of-state  to  care for his elderly parents.  The  traveling  and  medical expenses over the  years
contributed   to   his  financial  problems.  In   2018,  he   attempted   to   use   a   consumer  credit
counseling   service   to   consolidate   his   debts,  but  he   soon   learned   the   service   used
negotiated  settlements  to  resolve delinquent debts. He withdrew from  the  program,  and
he was unable to make payments on his delinquent accounts. He currently works full time
and has the financial means to make payments on these accounts.  (Items 3 and 4)
Based on the credit reports in evidence, Applicant has experienced financial issues
for at least two decades. In January 2005, the Army made a preliminary decision to deny
his security clearance. His security clearance was ultimately granted on appeal, and he
was  issued  a  warning  that  subsequent  unfavorable  information  may  result  in  the
suspension of his security clearance. (Items 3, 4, 10, 11 and 12)
Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct
Applicant has been arrested five times since 1998. At least three of these arrests
involved  alcohol.  In  November  1998,  he  was  arrested  for  Driving  Under  the  Influence
(DUI) after he drove his car into another vehicle. He entered into a diversion program with
conditions, to include alcohol education, 90-day license suspension, and a $1,029 fine.
(SOR ¶ 2.a.)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant was arrested for his second DUI in May 2005. He
admitted at the time of his arrest he had consumed about six or seven beers and failed a
sobriety test. His blood alcohol content tested three times over the legal limit. Applicant
pleaded guilty, and he was sentenced to three days in the workhouse, fined, and placed
on probation for one year.
In  June  2011,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  domestic  assault.  During  a  2014
interview, he admitted having grabbed his then-spouse during an argument. During his
current investigation, he denied any physical violence related to the incident. The charge
against  Applicant  was  dismissed  after  he  completed  an  anger  management  program.
(SOR ¶ 3.a.)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges that Applicant was arrested for his third DUI in June 2017. He
admitted drinking one shot of whiskey and four or five beers before driving home. This
arrest occurred despite Applicant’s previous declaration following his second DUI that he
would never drink and drive again.
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in the early morning hours of March
22, 2020, for fleeing the scene of an auto collision. He initially stated that he had struck
an  unknown  co-worker’s  car  while  leaving  the  office.  In  response  to  a  government
interrogatory, Applicant stated that he was following his friend “back from my house to my
girlfriend’s  house”  when  at  approximately  2:30  a.m.  he  struck  his  friend’s  car  while
attempting to pass him. Rather than speak to his friend about the accident at the scene,
he stated:
I  tried   to   call   [my   friend]  hoping   we  could   talk  on   the   phone   about  the
damages. I didn’t  receive  [an]  answer so  I  headed  home.  On  my way home
I received  a  call  from  the  [local] police  department saying  I fled  the  scene  of
an   accident.   I  explain[ed]   I  didn’t   [and]   I   would  give   my  statement   in  the
morning. I  kept driving  to  my house  under the  impression  everything  was
OK. When  I got to  [my] house  there were  two  sheriff’s deputies waiting  for
me  at  my house.  I  sat  in the  vehicle  for quite  some  time;  they  let  me  go  to
the  bathroom  in my house  and  I sat and  waited. Around  3:00  [a.m.]  the[y]
told me I was being arrested for leaving  the scene  of an  accident. (Item  4)

of   confinement   (all   suspended),   placed   him   on   probation   for  15   months,   and   ordered
him to  pay fines and costs.  He  did not undergo any alcohol counseling  or treatment  after
this  incident.   He  claimed   that  his  probation   officer  determined   that   he   did   not   need   to
take  any  alcohol counseling  after  going  over  his history with  alcohol.  (Tr.  25-32,  90-91;
Answer; GE  1-4; AE  B,  C)
In  May  2016,  police  in  State  A  arrested  Applicant  and  charged  him  with  DWI,
second and assault, causes bodily injury. He had been consuming beer all day, first on
a  boat,  and  later  with  his  stepbrother  at  the  house  where  his  stepbrother  lived.
Applicant’s  stepbrother  has  a  criminal  record  and,  at  the  time  of  the  hearing,  was  in
prison  for  selling  drugs.  At  some  point  during  the  evening,  he  and  his  stepbrother  got
into a verbal altercation that became physical. He and his stepbrother were intoxicated
when  they  fought.  It  is  unclear  from  the  record  whether  Applicant  or  his  stepbrother
started the physical portion of the fight. What is clear is that Applicant got the better of
the fight. As a result of the fight, Applicant drove his vehicle away from the house while
he was intoxicated, and his vehicle became stuck in the mud. He claimed that he drove
away  in  his  vehicle  because  his  stepbrother  would  not  stop  attacking  him.  Police
responded to his stepbrother’s house and to the location where Applicant’s vehicle was
stuck in the mud. (Tr. 32-67, 93-96, 102-104, 111-112; Answer; GE 1-3, 5; AE B, D, P)
Police  reported  that  while  they  were  investigating  the  incident,  they  had  to  tase
Applicant  multiple  times  because  he  was  combative  and  non-compliant.  Applicant
claimed that the police used unnecessary and excessive force. He refused a blood draw
and breathalyzer, but police obtained a warrant to draw his blood and test it for alcohol.
The  result of his blood test was that he had  a  .18% blood alcohol content (BAC).  The
prosecutor dropped the  assault charge. In October 2018,  Applicant pleaded guilty to a
lesser DWI charge. The court sentenced him to one day in jail and required him to pay a
$500 fine. He claimed that he has had no contact with his stepbrother in six years and
has  no  plans  to interact  with  him again.  (Tr. 32-67,  93-96, 102-104,  111-112;  Answer;

In June 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with a class c liquor violation.
He  had  been  drinking  alcohol  and  cooking  out  most  of  the  day  with  his  girlfriend.  By
about  11:00  p.m.,  he  had  consumed  about  nine  alcoholic  beverages  and  was
intoxicated. He claimed his girlfriend ordered food from a delivery service and then went
and sat in her car that was parked on the street outside his house. She was listening to
music at a high volume while she sat in the car. He claimed that he thought the music
was too loud, so he went to the car to ask her to turn it down. While he was in the public
street, he was met by the police, who had received a noise complaint. Applicant claimed
that  he  apologized  for  the  noise  and  said  that  he  told  the  police  that  he  was  heading
inside for the night. The police report indicated that Applicant initially told the police that
he had just gotten home after driving to a fast-food restaurant to get food. They claimed
that he later changed his story to having food delivered to his house after he admitted to
them that he had been drinking. The police asked him for his identification and gave him
and his girlfriend a field sobriety test, which they both failed. As they were intoxicated on
a public street, police arrested them. As a result of an error by his defense attorney, he
failed to appear at his arraignment and the court found him guilty for the liquor violation
in  his absence.  The  court fined  him,  and  he  paid  the  fine.  (Tr.  67-78,  97-98,  105-106,
116-117; Answer; GE 2, 3, 6; AE B, E)
In  March  2015,  Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  possession  of
marijuana after police found it in his car during a traffic stop.  He pleaded no contest to
the  charge  and  was  convicted.  He  paid  about  $900  in  court  costs  and  fines.  He  used
marijuana socially one to two times per week while he was in college from 2014 until his
March  2015  arrest.  He  stopped  using  marijuana  after  his  2015  arrest  because  he
realized  that  using  it  had  a  negative  impact  on  his  life.  He  has  not  used  illegal  drugs
since that arrest. He also transferred to a different college and stopped associating with
the  individuals  with  whom  he  used  marijuana.  The  Government  did  not  allege  this
marijuana possession arrest or use in the SOR. Any adverse information not alleged in
the SOR, such as his marijuana use or conviction for marijuana possession, will not be
considered for disqualification purposes; however, it may be considered in assessing an
applicant’s credibility; in evaluating an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or
changed  circumstances;  in  considering  whether  the  applicant  has  demonstrated
successful  rehabilitation;  and  in  applying  the  whole-person  concept.  (ISCR  Case  No.
15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (Tr. 90-93, 104; GE 1-3)
Applicant admitted that he has a problem with alcohol, and he believes that he is
an  alcoholic.  Between  the  time  he  turned  18  until  about  May  2022,  Applicant  would
consume about three to four pints of beer one to three times per week while watching
football  with  friends  at  a  friend’s  house  or  a  sports  bar.  He  claimed  that  he  rarely
became  intoxicated  after  these  three  to  four  pints  because  of  his  larger  size  and
because he was eating food. He claimed that after his alcohol-related incidents, he has
decided to change his drinking habits and abstain from alcohol. He is more focused on
his career and realizes that alcohol has negative effects on his life.  From August 2022
until  December  2022,  he  attended  and  completed  an  outpatient  alcohol  counseling
program.  He  attended  group  therapy  twice  per  week  and  individual  counseling  with  a
psychiatrist  once  per  month.  In  June  2022,  while  attending  this  treatment  program,  a
licensed  chemical  dependency  counselor  diagnosed  him  as  having  an  alcohol  use
disorder.  Beginning  in  July  2022,  he  has  also  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings.  He  attended  AA  meetings  daily  for  43  days  straight  and  then  has  attended
them  weekly.  He  has  an  AA  sponsor  with  whom  he  also  meets  weekly.  His  sponsor,
who  has  been  sober  for  22  years,  believes  that  Applicant  can  successfully  remain
sober. He has completed the AA 12-step program. He acknowledged that the possibility
of not being awarded a  security clearance motivated him to  seek help with his alcohol
issues.  However,  he  claimed  that  his  alcohol  consumption’s  impact  on  his  security
clearance was only one of several factors that led him to seek professional assistance
and abstain from  alcohol.  He has  not  consumed alcohol since  May  2022  and  plans to
remain abstinent indefinitely. (Tr. 21-25, 79-87, 98-102, 104-105, 112, 120-124; Answer;
AE B, F-J, O)
Applicant’s  father  and   his  AA   sponsor  testified   that  they  are  there   as  a   support
system  for him  should   he  ever  have  issues with  his sobriety.  They  also attested  to  his
good   character,  as  well   as  his   sincerity   and  commitment   to  his sobriety.   He  submitted
letters   attesting   to   his   good   character,  reliability,  and   dedication.  His  employment
performance   reviews   are   positive,   and   he   has  earned   several  monetary  awards,
certificates   of   appreciation,   and   a  training   certificate.   He   volunteers  weekly  at   a   food
pantry  and  attends church with  his grandparents every week.  (Tr. 88-89,  110-115, 122-

"Applicant admitted the two SOR allegations contained in SOR Paragraph 1, with
explanations; she denied the allegation contained in SOR Paragraph 2, with explanations;
and she admitted the SOR allegation contained in SOR Paragraph 3, with explanations.
(Item 2) Her admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. She was married in 2007, but is currently separated. She
has four children, ranging in age from 9 to 28 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree
in 2002, and has taken additional college credits. She has worked for federal contractors
since April 2015, with a brief period of unemployment in mid-2021. She started her current
position with a federal contractor in October 2021. (Item 3)
Applicant completed her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing
(e-QIP) on October 21, 2021. In response to questions in Section 22 inquiring about a
police record, she disclosed that  in July 2021,  she was charged with  driving under the
influence (DUI), a misdemeanor, and was awaiting a trial scheduled for November 2021.
In Section 24 inquiring about her use of alcohol, she explained that on July 22, 2021, she
had been consuming alcohol prior to work and was later terminated from her former job.
(Item 3)
According to a disciplinary report from her employer, Applicant was terminated on
July 27, 2021, for failing to uphold the company’s personal conduct and work performance
standards; engaging in conduct which could impair relationships between employees and
customers; reporting to work intoxicated; and engaging in physical behaviors that caused
disruptions and created unsafe work conditions. (Item 5)
In February 2022, Applicant  was interviewed by an  investigator for the Office of
Personnel Management  (OPM).  She  confirmed  that  she was  working the third  shift on
July 22, 2021, and came to work with alcohol on her breath. She stated that she had been
consuming alcohol with another colleague. She acknowledged that she was intoxicated.
She  explained  that  her  employer  did  not  object  to  employees  drinking  alcohol  prior  to
work, but they were not permitted to come to work intoxicated or smelling like alcohol.
(Item 4)
When Applicant arrived at work, she was displaying inebriated behaviors and was
offered a ride home by a coworker. Instead of taking that ride, she decided to drive home.
She was stopped by the police. She failed a sobriety test. She was taken to the police
station  and  failed  a  blood  test.  She  remained  at  the  police  station  overnight  and  was
charged with DUI. She was later terminated from her job. She told the investigator that
the  COVID-19  lockdown  contributed  to her  consumption of  alcohol as  she was  feeling
stressed and isolated during the pandemic. (Item 4)
On January 15, 2022, Applicant pleaded guilty to the DUI charge and was ordered
to pay a $1,200 fine. She was placed on probation for one year and required to undergo
alcohol/drug testing  twice  a month. She  was  also  required  to  attend  alcohol education
courses  and  participate  in  an  alcohol  evaluation.  In  her  October  11,  2022  answer  to
interrogatories, she disclosed that she attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) during the
weeks following her arrest, but was not attending  as of the date of the interrogatories.
She said her friends and family are aware of her DUI. (Item 4)
Applicant’s  interrogatories  also  inquired  about  her  history  of  alcohol  use  since
January 2010. She disclosed  that she drank “vodka/bourbon/whiskey many dates over
twelve and a half years.  . . 1-2 times a week and on holiday/1-6oz.” (Item 4) She drank
“wine  multiple  dates  over twelve  and  a  half years .  .  .  daily/glass.”  (Item  4)  She  drank

beer in the future for recreational purposes. (Item 4) She stated that she had not been
diagnosed with an alcohol-related disorder as of the date of these interrogatories. (Item
4)
In her Answer, Applicant acknowledged that she made a bad decision when she
decided to drink before going to work. She said this was an isolated incident, and in the
future, she would not consume alcohol and drive, or go to work after consuming alcohol.

"Consistent with his January 23, 2020 SCA, Applicant admitted all allegations. His
admissions in his Answer are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He is married to his third spouse and has two children
and three adult stepchildren. He has worked for his sponsor since 2007 as an inspector.
He earned an associate’s degree in 2007. He has never held a security clearance. (Item

Guideline I  –  Psychological Conditions
SOR ¶  1.a:  On  July  29,  2022,  at  the  request of  the  DoD,  Applicant underwent  a
psychological  evaluation.  The   DoD  psychologist  concurred   with   the   diagnosis  of  his
treating  physicians that  he  had  major depressive  disorder, recurrent, mild, and  an  alcohol
use  disorder.  (Item 4 at 6.)
SOR  ¶   1.e:   Applicant’s  history   of   suicidality   goes   back   to   1993,   when   he
His most recent
intentionally overdosed  on  Tylenol with  codeine. (Item  4  at 7.)  SOR ¶  1.c:
suicide  attempt  occurred  in the  summer of 2018, after a domestic disturbance, when  he
intentionally overdosed  on  a  prescription  muscle relaxer,  Baclofen.  (Item  3  at 35  and  Item
5  at 26.)  As a  result of the  overdose, he  was  placed  in a  medically induced  coma. SOR ¶
1.b:  After  the   2018   suicide   attempt,   he   underwent  psychiatric  treatment  and   was
diagnosed  with  major depression, recurrent,  severe, without psychosis, and  alcohol use
disorder,   severe.   (Item   5   at   4-5.)  SOR  ¶   1.f:  During   treatment   after  his   2018   suicide
attempt,  he   reported   five   suicide   attempts  since   the   age   of  16.   (Item   5   at  5.)   He
acknowledged   to   the  DoD  psychologist  to  planning   and  attempting   suicide   three   times
since  age  16. (Item  4  at 4.) SOR ¶  1.d:  In a domestic disturbance in 2005 he placed a
revolver to his head before ultimately discharging the weapon into the ceiling. (Item 4 at
4.)
Applicant  first  sought  treatment  for  depression  in  the  early  2000s,  after  his  first
divorce.  He  was  prescribed  a  series  of  medications,  which  in  short  term  use  proved
ineffective at reducing his symptoms. (Item 4 at 2.) He discontinued treatment within a
few months and did not resume treatment until 2012. He stopped the 2012 treatment after
two weeks. (Item 4 at 2.)
After his 2018 suicide attempt, he was prescribed Zoloft. The medication has been
effective in moderating his depression, and he continues taking it. Zoloft is his primary
means for treating his mental health issues. (Item 4 at 2 and Item 5 at 5.) However, the
DoD psychologist noted continued alcohol consumption negates the effectiveness of the
medications for his depression. (Item 4 at 6.) Applicant reports his use of medication at
approximately “one time a week” and described its use to address stress management,
procrastination, and to change his attitude. (Item 4 at 2-3.)
Guideline G – Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶¶  2.a  and 2.c: Applicant, even after the events alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and
1.d, admits in his Answer, and contrary to medical advice, his continued alcohol use. (Item
4 at 4.) He notes in his Answer his doctor is aware of his continued alcohol use.  In his
2020 security clearance interview he told the investigator as of July 2018 he no longer
used  alcohol.  (Item  7 at  8.)  During  his  July 2022  psychological  evaluation,  he  told  the
DoD  psychologist  he  consumed  “alcohol  approximately  four  times  weekly,  drinking
between two and five alcoholic beverages each setting, and only drinking more than six
alcoholic drinks approximately monthly.” (Item 4 at 7.)
SOR ¶¶ 2.d-2.f allege alcohol-related arrests. Applicant admits to each incident:
the  2015  incident  resulted  in  him  being  charged  with  fourth-degree  assault;  the  2009
incident  resulted  in  an  arrest  for  fourth-degree  assault  and  second-degree  disorderly
conduct; and the 2004 DUI arrest. (Item 3 at 29-32, Item 6, and Item 7 at 4-5.)
SOR ¶ 2.b states Applicant has experienced adverse personal, professional, and
financial consequences because of alcohol consumption since at least 2003. In addition
to the three alcohol-related arrests discussed in SOR ¶¶  2.d-2.f, the record shows several
other  professional  and  personal  consequences.  He  attributes alcohol  consumption  to
missing  work  due  to  being  hungover;  his  two  suicide  attempts  in  2005  and  2018;  his
second divorce; and his financial problems, including a  2014 foreclosure. (Item 4 at 3;
Item 2 at 2 and Item 5 at 4, 5; Item 3 at 18; and Item 3 at 36-37 Item 4 at 3.)
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 60 years old. She was married from 1988 to 1993. She remarried in
2020. She has an adult daughter. She has been employed by a federal contractor since
August 2019.
In approximately May 2016, Applicant recognized she had issues with alcohol and
began  attending  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA).  Between  May  2016  and  late  2017,  she
relapsed about once a quarter by drinking one to two bottles of wine on each occasion.
She then abstained from alcohol consumption between late 2017 and March 2019. (Item
6)
In March 2019, while working at a military retail facility on a military base, Applicant
consumed three small bottles of wine that she had brought to work with her in her purse.
She told the investigator that she had been under a lot of  stress due to her  upcoming
wedding and because she was offended that one of her co-workers wore his pants low,
and she was able to see his buttocks. She had previously registered a complaint with her
manager about how her coworkers dressed but was told there was nothing that could be
done about it. Applicant became intoxicated while at work. A coworker approached and
told her she was being relieved from her shift. Applicant went home because she was
intoxicated. She told the investigator that the next day she contacted her manager and
told him she was resigning from her position because she was a recovering alcoholic and
she had relapsed. She said she would not be returning to work because she needed to
focus on herself and her recovery. Her manager agreed with her, and she never returned
to work. She denied she was fired. (Item 6)
Applicant completed a security clearance application in August 2019. She did not
disclose that she left her position in May 2019 after being relieved from her shift for being
intoxicated, and then resigned. (Item 4)
In October 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. During
her interview, she disclosed that in 2013,  she had gastric-bypass surgery. Around that
time, she began consuming alcohol. She said she replaced her food addiction with alcohol
addiction. Her father passed away in 2013. Due to grief, loneliness, and stress, she began
consuming one to two bottles of wine a day and became intoxicated each time. She would
occasionally have hallucinations while intoxicated. (Items 6 and 7)
Applicant was asked by the government investigator why she failed to disclose that
she left her employment in March 2019 due to her alcohol incident and relapse, and she
said  she  was  embarrassed.  She  admitted  that  alcohol  had  a  negative  impact  on  her
professional  life  because  she  had  to  leave  her  position.  Her  alcohol  consumption
impacted  her  relationship  with  her  daughter  and  her  daughter’s  fiancé.  Her  daughter
bought breathalyzers to monitor Applicant’s consumption. She told the investigator that
she will always be a recovering alcoholic, and she will continue to attend AA meetings.
(Item 6)
There is no evidence that Applicant has participated in alcohol counseling, but she
reported to the investigator that she attended AA in May 2016 until August 2019 twice a
day, and she reported that she attended about three times a week from August 2019 to
October 2019. During her interview with the government investigator, she stated she had
been  sober  since  August  2019.  In  May  2022,  Applicant  completed  government
interrogatories and confirmed the accuracy of her statement to the investigator. She did
not provide any updated information about whether she continues to attend AA; whether
she has sought alcohol counseling; whether she has continually abstained from alcohol
consumption; and whether she has had any relapses. (Item 6)
In  October  2020,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  government-approved,  licensed
psychologist,  Dr.  L.  Applicant  disclosed  to  the  psychologist  that  she  had  a  history  of
depression and had attempted suicide twice in the past three years. Her first attempt in
2017 involved an overdose of pills, and she was taken to the hospital by ambulance. The
second attempt was after she lost her job in 2019 for drinking alcohol. She reported that
she  attempted  to  slice  her  wrists,  which  required  a  home  visit  from  a  mental  health
agency. The psychologist noted that Applicant reported that she had been diagnosed with
depression  in  the  past  and  was  presently  prescribed  psychotropic  medications.  She
receives medicine management through her general physician, though at the time of her
psychological evaluation, she had been referred to a psychiatrist, whom she had not yet
seen.  Applicant  also  reported  that  she  had  been  in  recovery  from  alcohol  use  for
approximately  18-19  months.  She  described  her  support  in  managing  her  alcohol
addiction was through AA and her husband and daughter. (Item 7)
Dr. L diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder (moderate) and alcohol
abuse  disorder,  in  remission.  Her  psychological  evaluation  noted  that  Applicant  had
persistent mental health issues and potential neurocognitive challenges that warranted
concern about her overall functioning. Dr. L noted  that Applicant’s issue  with  her mood
appears to be influenced by complicated and unprocessed grief surrounding her father’s
passing. In addition, Dr. L opined that while Applicant’s alcohol addiction is in sustained
remission,  Applicant  continued  to  demonstrate  limited  coping  capacity  to  manage
psychosocial  stressors.  As  such,  her  risk  for  relapse  and  emotional  dysregulation  in
response to situational stressors in her environment remained a concern. (Item 7)
Dr.  L  also  noted  that  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  her  mental  health  issues  and
addiction issues on her SCA. Applicant reported to the government investigator that she
was  embarrassed  about  her  alcohol  issues.  Dr.  L  opined  that  her  embarrassment  is
consistent with Applicant’s immense shame surrounding her mental health and recovery.
She stated that her level of shame and associated vulnerability warrant concern around
potential implications as it pertains to holding a security clearance, as Applicant’s lack of
candor and forthcomingness indicate unprocessed issues that may make her susceptible
to manipulation. (Item 7)
Dr.  L  opined  that  Applicant’s  current  level  of  functioning  may  interfere  with  her
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She also noted that Applicant’s alcohol abuse
was  being  managed  presently  with  a  prolonged  period  of  sobriety  and  consistent
engagement in AA. (Item 7)

Alcohol Consumption, Criminal Conduct, Drug Involvement, and Personal Conduct

frequency from August 1986 to at least August 2019. (Tr. 69-70, 109-111; GE 2 at 13) He

23) Applicant   said   he  was  in  a   car accident,   and   he   consented   to  a   blood-alcohol test
(BAT). (Tr. 35) His BAT was above  the  legal limit. (Tr. 35-36) He completed  the  alcohol
counseling classes, and his driver’s license was reinstated. (Tr. 36)
SOR  ¶   1.g   alleges  Applicant  was  arrested   on   August  22,  1998,   and   he   was
charged  with  obstruction  of justice/destruction  of  evidence  and  attempted  false  report  of
an   offense,  both   felonies.   He  was  convicted   of  these   offenses  and   sentenced   to   11
months of probation  and  assessed  fines and  court costs totaling  $250.  (GE 3  at24-26)
Applicant said  he  remembered  being  arrested  after he  swore  at a  police  officer; however,
he  claimed  he could not recall  ever going  to  court or being  charged  with  the  offenses. (Tr.
37)  Somehow  he   was   found   guilty  and   he   “never  knew  about   it  again  until   [he]  went
through  this investigation  process right here.”  (Tr. 37)  He said his mother checked  with
the  police  department  and  they did  not have  any record  of  the  arrests.  (Tr. 38)  He  did not
indicate she checked the court records for evidence of his conviction.
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges Applicant was arrested on March 29, 2003, and he was charged
with possession of marijuana (less than 2.5 grams) and possession of drug paraphernalia.
(GE 3 at 27-31) Applicant said a police officer was harassing him, and the police officer
found a bottle with a marijuana stem in it under his vehicle’s seat. (Tr. 38, 40) When he
arrived  at the  police  station, “the  chief  of police” pleaded  with  Applicant not to  make  a
complaint against the [arresting] officer because he was in the process of being dismissed
as  a  result  of  the  police  officer’s  disorderly  conduct.  (Tr.  39)  Applicant  was  charged;
however, the  charges  were  eventually  dismissed.  (Tr.  39;  GE  3  at  31-32)  He  said  the
marijuana was under the passenger’s seat, and it was not his marijuana. (Tr. 41)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  Applicant  was  arrested  on  January  29,  2011,  and  he  was
charged with possession of marijuana (less than 1 ounce). SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant
failed to appear for a court date on September 16, 2011, and a warrant was issued for his
arrest. (GE 3 at 5-10) Applicant said he was in a vehicle with five other individuals, and
the police found marijuana in one of their bags. (Tr. 43) He said it was not his marijuana.
(Tr. 43) On November 4, 2019, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator
interviewed Applicant about the warrant for his arrest, and Applicant said he did not intend
to resolve it until his child custody issues were resolved. (OPM Report of Investigation
(ROI) at 7) As of March 31, 2022, the charge was pending.
At Applicant‘s hearing,  he  said  he  recently paid $1,150 to  resolve the  charge. (Tr.
42) He said he  “called  and  over the  phone  paid with  [his] credit card  and  then  that was
pretty much  it, a  done  deal.” (Tr. 43-44) He said he  would  provide  documentation  after
the hearing showing the charge was resolved; however, he did not provide anything. (Tr.
43)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant was arrested on August 10, 2017, and he was charged
with domestic battery. The mother of his children obtained 11 orders of protection. (Tr.
45-48) She told the police he assaulted her. (Tr. 47) When he went to court, she withdrew
her allegations. (Tr. 47) He denied that he was violent towards her. (Tr. 49) He believed
it would be best if he moved to a different state to get away from her. (Tr. 50)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  Applicant  was  arrested  on  February  7,  2018,  and  he  was
charged with violation of a civil no contact order. (GE 3 at 33-34) Applicant said the charge
was dismissed because the civil no contact order did not exist. (Tr. 51-52)
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  2.a  allege  Applicant was  arrested  on  July 22,  2019, following  a
multi-vehicle  collision,  and he  was charged  with  aggravated  DUI resulting  in great bodily
harm.  Applicant  said the  accident was not  his fault.  (Tr. 71) The  accident was at  about
10:46  p.m. (GE  4  at 19)  He said  he  only had  one  drink, and  that was about  4:45  p.m.
when   he   was  at  dinner.  (Tr.  71)  The   accident  occurred   at  about   10   p.m.  (Tr.  71)   One
report said he  had  a  breathalyzer which  registered  .075  (no  time  specified  in the  report);
however, his breathalyzer at 12:14 am  said .054. (Tr. 74, 86-87; GE  4 at 2, 18-19)
Applicant  said  they  tested  urine  samples  in  the  jail,  and  they  found  cocaine
metabolites in his urinalysis sample; however, he disagreed with this finding. (Tr. 76, 101)
He  was  taking  Adderall  for  ADHD,  and  it  was  not  detected  in  the  test.  (Tr.  76-77)  He
believed they switched his urine sample with one of the other prisoners. (Tr. 101) Forty-
eight hours after he was arrested, he had a blood test, which was negative for the cocaine
metabolite. (Tr. 103, 106) I asked Applicant to provide a copy of the blood test results
after his hearing; however, he did not provide them. (Tr. 116)
Applicant was arrested for failure to appear on March 6, 2023, and he was released
on March 13, 2023. (Tr. 79-80, 96) Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI in order to get released
from  jail.  (Tr.  82)  He  was  placed  on  probation  for  18  months.  (Tr.  109)  He  intends  to
appeal his conviction. (Tr. 82) He was unaware of the status of the civil lawsuit the woman
seriously injured in the accident filed against him. (Tr. 83; GE 5)
Applicant told the police officer he drank a double vodka at about 5:00 p.m., and
he said he had not smoked marijuana in the previous three days. (Tr. 86; GE 4 at 19)
The  woman  who  was  seriously  injured  in  the  accident  on  July  22,  2019,  was
pregnant. In her lawsuit, she seeks damages from Applicant in the amount of $50,000.
(GE 4) The lawsuit states Applicant was under the influence of alcohol and/or marijuana
at the time of the accident.
Applicant was arrested or served with papers in the summer of 2022 for not paying
his child support. (Tr. 60, 68) He said, “they put me in jail twice to pay child support in a
total amount of $9,000 one time, and then $6,000 the next time. So, that’s $15,000. So,
how could I possibly owe them anything?” (Tr. 59) The hearing is supposed to clarify the
amount  of  his  child  support  payments,  and  possibly  designate  who  should  take  the
deductions  for  the  children  for  income  tax  purposes.  (Tr.  59-62)  He  had  a  hearing
scheduled the last week of March 2023 concerning child support payments. (Tr. 58-59)
He believes his child support is current. (Tr. 60)
Personal Conduct-Falsification of SCA
SOR ¶¶ 4.b, 4.c, and 4.d allege Applicant failed to disclose on his April 23, 2020
SCA the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 3.b in response to questions
about felony charges, charges involving alcohol and illegal drugs, and involvement with
marijuana in the previous seven years.
In his April 23, 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed: his 2017 or 2018 domestic violence
charges which was dismissed; his emergency order of protection in 2019 was denied; his
aggravated  DUI  charge  in  2019  was  pending;  and  he  was  accused  of  violation  of
parenting order or plan in 2020 (GE 1 at 32-39) He did not disclose any alcohol offenses
except  the  2019  DUI  or  any  drug  offenses  or  involvement  in  response  to  the  specific
questions about alcohol-related charges and drug involvement. (GE 1)
On November 4, 2019, Applicant confirmed to an OPM investigator that his only
arrest for or charge of DUI was in 2019, and he did not have any drug-related charges.
(OPM ROI at 6) He was confronted with and confirmed marijuana possession charges in
1995, 2003, and 2011. (Id. at 6-9; SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i) He confirmed: his 1997 DUI
arrest and conviction in 2000, and his arrest in 1998, for obstruction of justice/destruction
of evidence. (OPM ROI at 8; SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h) He indicated he used marijuana from
August 1986 to August 2019, and his average use was three or four times a month. (OPM
ROI at 9) He said he “has never tested  positive on  a  drug  test.”  (Id. at 10) He told the
OPM investigator that he believed he was only required to disclose marijuana offenses
and DUIs in the previous seven years. (Id. at 6-9) In his response to DOHA interrogatories
he  explained  the  urinalysis  test  result  showing  cocaine  metabolites  found  in  his  urine
sample  were  erroneous,  and  he  predicted  the  charges  would  be  removed  from  his
records. (GE 2 at 2)
At his hearing, Applicant said he  had  no  idea  he  was charged  with  the  felonies in
SOR ¶  1.g. (Tr. 89) He  misread  the  question  concerning  alcohol  and  drug  offenses.  (Tr.
90-91) He thought he  only had  to  disclose  the  offenses in the  last  seven  years. (Tr. 90-
91)

"Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2011. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has
held since about 2011. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2017 and a master’s degree in
2019. He married in 2022. He has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 36, 64-65; GE 1; AE
1, 9)
Applicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents and criminal conduct. He was
arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in December 2015 and June 2021. He was
arrested or cited for public intoxication in July 2018, November 2018, and October 2019.
He was hospitalized for alcohol intoxication and suicidal ideation in February 2019.
Applicant  had  about  seven  shots  of  alcohol  at  a  bar  in  December  2015.  He
attempted  to  drive  home,  but  was  found  by  the  police  in  a  nearby  parking  lot  asleep
behind  the driver’s  wheel.  He had  a blood alcohol  test, but  he  testified  that he  did not
remember what his blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was on the test. He was arrested
and charged with DWI. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 80 hours of community
service  and probation for 12  months.  He  was  required to  take  three  alcohol education
classes. (Tr. at 36-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4, 10)
Applicant  then  girlfriend  (not  his  wife)  broke  up  with  him  while  they  were  at  the
wedding of the girlfriend’s sister in July 2018. He drank at the reception and then at a
restaurant. He then drove  and parked by the side of a secluded road and drank  in his
truck. The police found him asleep in the back of his truck. He was  arrested for public
intoxication.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  paid  a  fine.  (Tr.  at  39-44;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 3, 10)
Applicant  was  drinking  at  a  bar  in  November  2018.  His  ex-girlfriend  contacted
him about getting back together. He drank too much  (about seven shots) and became
anxious  and  emotional,  and  he  started  crying.  The  police  took  him  to  the  hospital
because  they  had  concerns  that  he  was  having  an  anxiety  or  a  panic  attack.  The
hospital did not admit him, and he was arrested for public intoxication. He pleaded guilty
and  received  a  deferred  adjudication.  (Tr.  at  44-46;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;  GE
10)
Applicant  was  drinking  wine  by  himself  in  his  apartment  in  February  2019.  He
drank  at  least  one  bottle  of  wine.  He  cut  his  finger  on  a  broken  wine  bottle,  and  he
accidentally caused a crease in an extension faucet. The water leaked from the faucet,
with the overflow going into the apartment below him. His neighbor called maintenance
about the leak. When maintenance arrived at his apartment, they noticed the blood and
the water, and they contacted the police. The police also received calls, apparently from
his  friend,  indicating  that  Applicant  had  threatened  to  end  his  own  life,  had  suicidal
thoughts  (ideation),  and  had  threatened  to  kill  his  friend.  When  police  arrived,  they
found  multiple  empty  wine  bottles,  and  Applicant  was  described  as  belligerent  and
intoxicated. (Tr. at 20, 46-50; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 10)
A  detention  warrant  was  issued,  and  Applicant  was  taken  to  the  hospital  in  the
evening  of  February  15,  2019.  His  lacerated  finger  was  treated,  and  his  blood  was
collected at 11:30 p.m. His BAC was .376%. He received a psychological screening the
next  morning.  A  differential  diagnosis  considered  was  suicidal  ideation  (SI),  homicidal
ideation (HI), co-ingestion, and acute alcohol intoxication. The provisional diagnosis was
alcohol abuse.  He  was  assessed  with  alcohol-induced  mood  disorder and alcohol  use
disorder,  mild,  abuse.  An  alcohol  use  disorder  diagnosis  requires  the  presence  of  at
least 2 of the 11 criteria listed in the DSM-5. Applicant was deemed to be positive for 3
of the criteria. The DSM-5 indicates that if 2 to 3 of the criteria are met, the disorder is
specified as mild. (Tr. at 67-68; GE 2; HE III)
The   doctor discussed  alcohol use   disorder with   Applicant.  She   encouraged   him
to   track  his  alcohol   use   and   to   seek  counseling   or  outpatient  support  for  alcohol  use
cessation. Referrals for treatment and counseling were provided  to  him. He did not meet
the   criteria   for  inpatient  hospitalization,  and   he   was   discharged   to   his   home   at  about
11:09  a.m. on February 16, 2019.  (Tr. at 67-68; GE 2)
Applicant  was  drinking  at  a  bar  in  October  2019.  The  police  arrested  him  for
public  intoxication.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  paid  a  fine.  He  does  not  remember  exactly
what happened. (Tr. at 52-54; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 10)
Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI, second offense, in June 2021. He
was  at  a  baby  shower  with  his  girlfriend  (now  wife)  that  lasted  for  about  eight  to  nine
hours.  He  drank,  but  he  did  not  believe  he  was  intoxicated.  He  stated  that  he  was
driving  with  his  girlfriend,  and  they  had  an  argument.  He  was  using  his  cell  phone  for
navigation, when it fell. He swerved and hit the curb. They parked  in a parking lot, got
out of the truck, and continued  to argue. The police arrived and arrested him. A blood
test measured .18% and .14% BAC. Applicant believes the tests were inaccurate. The
case is still pending trial. (Tr. at 20-21, 54-57, 65-67, Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
5, 11)
The  DoD  Consolidated  Adjudications  Facility  (CAF)  requested  that  Applicant
undergo  a  psychological  evaluation  in  March  2021.  The  evaluation  was  voluntary,  but
the request had the following option:
I  will  not  participate  in  an  independent  psychological  evaluation  with  a
provider retained by the DoD CAF. By initialing here, I understand that my
refusal to participate in an independent psychological evaluation will result
in  the  denial  of  my  security  clearance  application  due  to  my  failure  to
cooperate. (GE 7)
Applicant  agreed  to  undergo  the  evaluation.  He  reported  to  the  evaluation  in
August  2021,  but  he  refused  to  talk  about  the  June  2021  DWI.  He  stated,  “I  want  to
postpone  any  discussion  about  that  charge  on  the  advice  of  my  attorney.”  He
elaborated,  “I  don’t  understand  what  happened.  I  was  not  in  a  vehicle  and  I  didn’t
overconsume. I will discuss it at some point in the future after my attorney and I figure
out exactly what happened.”  The psychologist was unable to render a diagnosis or an
opinion. (Tr. at 21, 57-58, 70; GE 7, 8)
Applicant  wrote  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  that  he  realized  that  refusing  to
discuss the DWI with the psychologist was not in his best interest. He wrote:
I  realize  now  that  my  attorney  is  not  well  versed  in  handling  cases  that
involve  clients  with  security  clearance  requirements.  If  I  had  that
opportunity again, I would handle the situation differently. I would be more
than happy to go through another evaluation. If there are questions asked
of  me  during  this  process  or  during  my  hearing,  I  will  absolutely  provide
full and detailed answers.
Applicant relied on the generic advice of his attorney to not discuss the case. He
did not request specific advice from his attorney about the evaluation.  He realizes now
that it was a mistake to not fully participate in the psychological evaluation. He remains
willing to undergo another evaluation. (Tr. at 70-72; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant admitted that 2018 to 2021 was “a dark time in [his] life,” which resulted
from  a  tumultuous  relationship  (previous  girlfriend,  not  wife).  He  denied  ever  having
plans to commit suicide. He had been sober for 718 days as of the date of the hearing.
He  has  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings  two  to  three  times  a  week  for
the  last  year.  He  also  saw  his  company’s  counselor  several  times.  His  marriage  is
happy, and his wife does not drink. He is more health conscious, with a better diet and
daily exercise. He does not believe that he is an alcoholic; but he is convinced that his
life is better without alcohol. (Tr. at 19, 23, 59-64, 68-70; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant had a psychological evaluation by a clinical psychologist in May 2023.
She  diagnosed  Applicant  with  alcohol  use  disorder,  mild,  in  sustained  remission.  The
prognosis for continued sobriety was good. (AE 1)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  has  received  regular  promotions  and
awards.  He  is  praised  for  his  trustworthiness,  mentorship,  work  ethic,  responsibility,
empathy,  loyalty,  compassion,  honesty,  dependability,  judgment,  dedication,  and
integrity. (Attachments to Applicant’s response to SOR; AE 2-10)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.  His testimony at the hearing regarding SOR ¶¶
1.e, 1.f,  and 2.b  indicated that he admitted that he  was  arrested but  did not admit  the
conduct alleged. I have treated his answer to these allegations as denials.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  communications  instructor  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  April  2020.  He  graduated  from  a  military  academy  in  May  2007  and
served on active duty until November 2012, when he received an honorable discharge.
He  held  a  security  clearance  while  on  active  duty.  He  married  in  October  2009  and
divorced in August 2013. He has a 13-year-old daughter, who lives with his ex-wife.
In  January  2003,  while  Applicant  was  attending  the  preparatory  school  for  a
military  academy,  he  drank  too  much  beer  at  an  off-base  location.  He  became  ill  and
began  to  vomit  as  he  and  his  friends  were  returning  to  the  base.  He  and  his  friends
were held by the gate guards until the command duty officer took custody of them and
returned them to their quarters. Even though Applicant was underage, he was not cited
by  civilian  authorities  for  underage  drinking.  His  military  superior  restricted  him  to  the
base for 45 days for underage drinking. (GX 2 at 4; Tr. 18-19) This incident was alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.a.
While  Applicant  was  on  active  duty,  he  was  deployed  for  about  two  years  and
became intoxicated between missions once or twice a month. He had no alcohol-related
disciplinary actions while on active duty. (Tr. 20)
In June 2012, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery on a family member
and violating protective orders. The incident occurred when his wife began screaming at
him and trying to hit him, and he tried to fend her off. He believes that his wife’s actions
were her reaction to his decision to file  for divorce. (Tr. 21) She called the police, who
required that one of them leave the house. Applicant volunteered to leave. His wife filed
charges of assault and battery and  obtained a protective order to keep him away from
the  family  home  where  she  was  living.  He  violated  the  order  when  he  went  into  the
garage at night to retrieve some of his possessions. His ex-wife called the police, who
arrested him. (GX 2 at 14) The charges of assault and violating a protective order were
dismissed. (GX 8 at 9) Alcohol was not involved in this domestic scuffle or the  alleged
violations of the protective order.  (Tr. 33) These incidents were alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.b
and 2.c.
In January 2013, Applicant was again charged with violating the protective order.
He asked a friend to go to the house and retrieve some of his belongings. His ex-wife
notified  the  police  that  Applicant  had  violated  the  protective  order.  When  Applicant
learned that his ex-wife had contacted the police, he turned himself in. (GX 2 at 14, GX
3 at 16-18) He was convicted and sentenced to 30 days in jail, with 28 days suspended.
(GX 8 at 10). This incident was alleged in SOR ¶ 2.d.
In  March  2013,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI),  first
offense.  He  was drinking  at a  bar with  several friends  and  had  parked  in  an  area  that
was  a  tow-away  zone  after a  certain  time. Even  though  he  realized  he  was  drunk,  he
tried  to drive  to another parking area.  He  was  arrested  and  registered  a blood-alcohol
level  of  .14  percent  on  a  breathalyzer.  (Tr.  28)  He  was  sentenced  to  confinement  for
one  year  (suspended)  and  unsupervised  probation  for  12  months.  His  driver’s  license
was  suspended  for  one  year.  He  was  required  to  install  an  ignition  interlock  on  his
vehicle and to attend alcohol safety action program (ASAP) classes. (GX 5; GX 6 at 1;
Tr. 27-29) This incident was alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b.
In  March  2014,  following  a  positive  reading  on  Applicant’s  ignition  interlock,  he
was  referred  for  substance  abuse  treatment  and  counseling,  and  the  breathalyzer
requirement  was  extended  for  one  or  two  months.  He  was  required  to  attend  weekly
group  therapy  and  attend  two  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings  per  month.  He
completed  the  program  in  June  2014.  He  attributed  the  positive  interlock  reading  to
using  mouthwash  at  work  before  driving  home  after  work.  (GX  7  at  3;  Tr.  30)  The
interlock violation was alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c.
In July 2015, Applicant was charged with being drunk in public.  He was walking
alone at night after spending the evening  drinking  with friends. Someone accused him
of trying to break into cars. The police saw Applicant arguing with a group of people and
arrested him. (GX 2 at 10) At the hearing, he testified that he had consumed about four
drinks  and  was  “slightly  buzzed”  at  the  time.  (Tr.  33)  He  was  found  not  guilty,  but  he
was  ordered  to  seek  counseling  and  treatment.  (GX  6  at  3)  He  attended  weekly
counseling  from  August  2015  to  August  2016  and  completed  the  treatment  program.

In  March  2017,  Applicant  was  riding  his  bicycle  in  a  park  with  friends  when  he
was  stopped  by  police  because  he  and  his  friends  were  being  loud.  (GX  2  at  20)  He
was charged with being drunk in public. He testified that he had consumed one or two
drinks.  (Tr.  37)  He  was  found  guilty  by  the  general  district  court.  (GX  6  at  5).  He
appealed to the circuit court, pleaded not guilty, and the charge was dismissed. (GX 6 at
7.) This incident was alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e.
In   November  2017,  Applicant  was  charged   with   DWI,   2nd   offense   within  five
years.  He  and  a  girlfriend  spent an  evening  drinking  wine  at  her apartment. He left  her
apartment  late  in  the  evening, decided  that he  was too  intoxicated  to  drive, and  went to
sleep  in his car. A  policeman  found  him  sleeping  in his car. (GX 2  at 10) He was found
not guilty. (GX 6  at 9)  This incident was alleged in  SOR ¶  1.f.
In March 2019, Applicant was charged with being drunk in public and fleeing from
law enforcement officers. He went to an after-hours bar with a group of friends who had
gone to the bar on their bicycles. As the group walked toward their bicycles, policemen
who were in the parking lot approached them, and they ran in different directions. The
record  does  not  reflect  why  the  police  approached  them  or  why  they  ran  away.
Applicant  ran  toward  his  bicycle  but  was  tackled  by  a  policeman.  (GX  2  at  11)  At  the
hearing,  he  testified  that  he  had  consumed  about  six  beers  but  was  not  “overly
intoxicated.” (Tr. 40) The drunk in public charge was dismissed, and he was found not
guilty  of  fleeing  from  law  enforcement  officials.  (GX  6  at  11-15)  This  incident  was
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g.
In   December  2019,  Applicant  was  charged   with   DWI,   2nd   offense   within  5-10
years,  and  refusing  a  breathalyzer. He  was stopped  by police  because  a  taillight  on  his
car was out.  The  police  conducted  a  field  sobriety test, but Applicant declined  to  take  a
breathalyzer test.  (GX  2  at 11) The  results  of the  field  sobriety test  are not reflected  in
the   record.   He  testified   that  he   had   consumed   three   drinks.   He   was   held  in   jail  for   a
week  and   then   released   on   bail.  While   he   was  awaiting   trial,  he   was  required   by  the
court to  abstain from  alcohol and  seek counseling. (Tr. 49) Both  charges were  disposed
of by nolle  prosequi.  (GX 4; GX  6 at 17-20)  This incident was alleged in  SOR ¶  1.h.
In  March  2020,  Applicant  was  charged  with  assault  and  battery  on  a  family
member. He was sitting in his car with his girlfriend, now his fiancée, who had found a
condom  in  his  car  and  suspected  him  of  cheating.  She  started  screaming  and  hitting
herself in the face. At the hearing, his fiancée testified that she suffers from anxiety and
depression, and when she becomes upset, she tends to hurt herself by hitting herself in
the  face,  scratching  her  face  and  pulling  out  her hair.  She  testified  that  Applicant  was
shouting  at  her  and  trying  to  stop  her  from  hurting  herself.  Witnesses  to  the  incident
heard the shouting, saw her bleeding, and concluded that Applicant had injured her. (Tr.
60-61) The charge was nolle prosequi in January 2021. (GX 3; GX 8 at 13) This incident
was alleged in SOR ¶ 2.e.
While  Applicant  was  awaiting  trial  for  the  incident  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.e,  he
attended  AA  meetings  in  2020  and  had  a  sponsor.  He  is  not  currently  receiving  any
counseling or treatment. (Tr. 52)
Applicant testified that he now works in the sensitive area of cybersecurity and no
longer associates with his bar-hopping former associates. He now focuses on studying,
cybersecurity,  working out, staying  in  shape, and adopting  healthier habits.  (Tr. 54.) A
former supervisor who has known him for 10 years and was his direct supervisor for a
year described him as “a fabulous worker.” (GX 7 at 4)
The  mother of Applicant’s  fiancée has been a practicing physician  for 30 years.
She is familiar with Applicant’s past problems with alcohol. She has known Applicant for
six years and they have become close during the last five years. He stays with them for
about  one  week  a  month  because  they  live  close  to  his  work  site.  He  joins  them  for
meals and  recreation  time,  works from  their home,  and goes on  trips  with  them.  Even
when  they  go  to  restaurants,  Applicant  does  not  drink.  She  regards  Applicant  as  a
talented and dedicated person who has turned his life around. (Tr. 64-65)
In  February  2022,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed  psychologist  in
accordance  with  a  CAS  request  for  a  psychological  evaluation.  The  DWI  and
breathalyzer-refusal  charges  were  pending  when  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  the
psychologist.  (Tr.  42-43)  The  psychologist  diagnosed  him  with  alcohol  use  disorder,
moderate.  The  psychologist’s  report  recites  the  numerous  specific  incidents  that  had
occurred  after  Applicant  had  been  drinking.  Applicant  admitted  during  the  evaluation
that  while  on  active  duty  he  would  consume  6-10  drinks  per  incident.  He  told  the
psychologist, “When I drink, I may drink a lot.” He also told the psychologist that he had
reduced  his  consumption  due  to  his  “legal  issues.”  The  psychologist  concluded  that
Applicant  had  not  been  able  to  abstain  from  alcohol  for  more  than  six  months  at  any
time  in  his  adult  life  despite  DWI  charges,  alcohol  education  courses,  treatment
programs, a requirement for monthly urinalysis tests, and a court order requiring him  to
abstain from alcohol until his court date for the charges of assaulting his girlfriend. (GX
7)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  disagreed  with  the  psychologist’s  statement  about  his
continued drinking. He testified that he stopped drinking in early 2020, but he admitted
drinking  a  champagne  toast  at  a  New  Year’s  Day  celebration,  but  he  did  not  specify
which  year  or  years  that  he  did  so.  He  believes  that  the  psychologist  interpreted  his
comment about drinking a toast on New Year’s Day  to mean that he continues to drink
regularly.  (Tr.  50)  The  psychologist’s  diagnosis  of  alcohol  use  disorder  is  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 1.i.
I have taken administrative notice that DSM 5 describes 11 diagnostic criteria for
alcohol use disorder. At least two of the diagnostic criteria must have occurred within a
12-month period to warrant a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. The DSM also provides
that  an  alcohol  use  disorder  is  considered  to  be  in  sustained  remission  if  none  of  the
criteria have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer, except for the
criterion  of a  “craving,  or a  strong  desire  or urge  to  use  alcohol.”  The psychologist did
not specifically identify which diagnostic criteria he relied on to make his diagnosis.
In  March  2023,  Applicant  was  offered  employment  by  a  defense  contractor,
contingent on verification of a security clearance. (AX A) The employment offer was still
open at the time of the hearing. (Tr. 67)

"Applicant  admitted  all  allegations,  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.f  and  SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.b.  His
admissions  and  statements  in  his  Answer  and  Response  are  incorporated  into  the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old. After serving honorably in the U.S. Navy from November
2004 to February 2020, he experienced approximately eight months of unemployment.
(Item 2 at 13-14 and 18.) He has worked for his security clearance sponsor as a trainer
since January 2021. (Item 2 at 11.)  He held a security clearance while on active duty.
(Item  2  at  36.)  He  divorced  his  first  spouse  in  early  December  2009  and  married  his
current spouse ten days later.  (Item 2 at 21-22.) He has three minor children and one
minor stepchild. He has a high school diploma. (Item 2 at 21-22.)
The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent debts  totaling  $26,514,  reflected  in  three  credit
reports from May 2020 (Item 5), March 2021 (Item 6), and April 2022 (Item 7). Applicant
was able to settle two delinquent debts totaling $1,669, which still had an active collection
on them. (Response, AE-A and AE-B.) He stated his intent to obtain a consolidation loan
to  satisfy  the  remaining  debts.  (Response.)  The  evidence  concerning  these  debts  is
summarized below.
Guideline F
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.b:  two  accounts  charged  off  in  the  amounts  of  $12,618  and
$9,650. Applicant admits the debts. In response to August 2021 interrogatories from DoD,
he admitted that he had not made any payments or made payment arrangements. (Item
3 at 3 and Item 7 at 2-3.) He states his plan is to let the debts he has recently resolved
“settle on” his credit report and then to get a consolidation loan to satisfy the remaining
debts. (Response.)
SOR ¶ 1.c:  account  placed for  collection of  $1,142.  Applicant admits the  debt.
At  the   time   of   the   August  2021   interrogatories,   he   admitted   that  he   had   not made  any
payments  or  payment  arrangements.  (Item  3  at 3  and  Item  5  at 24.)  He  was able  to  reach
a  settlement with  the  creditor. He paid $300  to  settle this account in late  March 2023. (AE-
A.)
SOR ¶ 1.d: account placed for collection of $527. Applicant admits the debt. At
the  time  of  the  August  2021  interrogatories,  he  admitted  that  he  had  not  made  any
payments or payment arrangements.  (Item 3 at 3 and Item 5 at 24.) On March 27, 2023,
he paid the debt in full. (AE-B.)
SOR ¶  1.e: account placed for collection of $1,988. Applicant admits the debt.
In response to August 2021 interrogatories from DoD, he admitted that he had not made
any payments  or payment  arrangements. (Item 3 at 3.) He  states his plan  is to  let  the
debts he has recently resolved “settle on” his credit report and then to get a consolidation
loan to satisfy the remaining debts. (Response.)
SOR  ¶   1.f:  account  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $589.  Applicant  admits  the
debt. In response to August 2021 interrogatories from DoD, he admitted he had not made
any payments or payment arrangements. (Item 3 at 3 and Item 5 at 24.) He states his
plan is to let the debts he has recently resolved “settle on” his credit report and then to
get a consolidation loan to satisfy the remaining debts. (Response.)
Applicant provided no documents regarding a budget. He provided no details or
documents about his current financial situation and how he would be able to resolve all
the  remaining  debts  “in  the  next  few  months.”  (Response.)  He  blamed  his  financial
situation on the transition from the military to a civilian job which resulted in a pay cut as
well as periods of unemployment in 2020. (Item 2 at 12, 14 and Item 4 at 7.)
Guideline G
SOR ¶ 2.a: Applicant admits he was arrested on December 8, 2006, and charged
with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. (Item 2 at 33.)
SOR ¶  2.b: Applicant admits he was arrested on February 2, 2019, and charged
with driving while impaired (DWI). (Item 2 at 31.)
Applicant maintains  he  has learned  from  his  mistakes. In  his SCA  he  states  he  had
completed  his 48  hours community service  and  will  pay his fines  at  his final hearing  in
February 2021. In  his Answer and  during  his security clearance  interview he  asserted  that
he   has  fulfilled   all   his legal  obligations  for  his  2019   DWI  conviction.   As  a   result  of  the
incident,   he   completed   the   military  substance   abuse   rehabilitation   program   (SARP)   in
December  2019.  (Item   2   at  36   and   Item   4   at  2.)  He  added   in  his  security  clearance
interview   “stuck  to”  his  after  care  plan,  but   this  is  uncorroborated.  After  his  personal
evaluation  concluded  alcohol would  create  trouble  for  him, he stated  that  he  now abstains
from  alcohol  use.  His December 2006  DUI charge  was reduced  to  reckless driving  and
his license  was suspended  for six months and  he  was fined. (Item  4  at 7  and  Item  8  at 1-
2.)  He argued  that these  lapses in judgment are not a  full  representation  of his character.
(Response.)

"In Applicant's answer to the SOR, he admitted all allegations. His admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 43-year-old customer service representative. He has worked for his
sponsor since August 2021. He is a high school graduate and holds a technical certificate.
He received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army for his service from 2009-2015,
which included a deployment to a combat zone. He previously held a clearance in 2009.
He was married from 2011-2017 and remarried in 2021. He has one child of his own and
two stepchildren. (Item 3 at 7, 12-13, 17, 21, 23-25, and 35; Item 4 at 5.)
SOR  ¶¶   1.a,   3.a   and  3.b:  Failed   to   disclose   the   information  set  forth  in
subparagraph 3.a  that he  had used marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from about
June 2016  to  about  November 2021  and purchased marijuana  during this  period.
Applicant answered “No” to Question 23 of his August 2021 SCA, which asked whether
he  had  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances.  (Item  3  at  33.)  He  was
interviewed multiple times during the investigative process. During the first interview in
September  2021,  he  discussed  alcohol  abuse  and  financial  matters,  along  with  other
areas. (Item 4 at 13-15.) He was provided additional time to provide documentation to
support his answers concerning financial matters and was asked to provide paperwork to
the  investigator  for  release  of  his  medical  records.  (Item  4  at  17.)  He  subsequently
provided consent paperwork for the release of his mental health and alcohol counseling
records. After receiving these records, the investigator asked if he had any involvement
with illegal drugs. He answered yes and told the investigator that he had used marijuana
on a daily basis by himself in his house. (Item 4 at 21.) He explained that the marijuana
helped  with  his  anxiety  and  back  pain  and  that  he  had  to  buy  the  marijuana  illegally
through a friend. He stated the reason he did not truthfully answer the SCA question about
his drug use was because he did not think the investigation would include obtaining his
medical records. (Item 4 at 21.) After going through “drug and alcohol rehab” in June 2021
he  stated  that  he  tried  marijuana  again  but  did  not  like  the  feeling.  (Item  4  at  6.)  His
treatment  included  receiving  shots  to  get  him  off  marijuana  and  patches.  His  monthly
shots started in August 2021, but he admitted that he continued to use marijuana and had
used marijuana as recently as November 23, 2021. He listed as references three friends
who also use marijuana. (Item 4 at 21 and Item 3 at 22-23.)
SOR ¶¶  1.b,  4.a and 4.b:  Failed to
disclose debts  set  forth in subparagraphs
4.a.   and   4.b,  accounts  charged  off  in  the   approximate   amounts   of   $21,054   and
$19,269.   Applicant  listed  one  debt  on  his  SCA.  When  asked  if  he  had  any  additional
qualifying debts by the investigator, he responded no. (Item 4 at 15.) When confronted by
the  investigator  with  two  charged-off  debts,  he  acknowledged  them  as  private  student
loans. (Item 4 at 15.) He took these loans out in approximately 1999 and they went into
collection in around 2006. He stated he did not disclose the delinquent student loans on
his SCA because he did not want to look bad.  He had utilized deferments while in the
military and later when he took classes between October 2015 and May 2018. He told the
investigator since May 2018 he has tried to forget about his student loans. (Item 4 at 15-
16 and Item 5 at 3, 8.)
SOR ¶¶  2.a  and 2.b:  Consumed alcohol, at times  in excess  and  to  the  point
of   intoxication,  from   about   June  2020   to   present   and  received  inpatient   alcohol
treatment from about June 2021 to about August 2021, with  a  diagnosis of alcohol
dependent.  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  received  inpatient  treatment  for  alcohol
dependency and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from June 2021 through August
2021. (Item 3 and Item 4 at 14.) He acknowledged consuming a bottle of tequila a day
from June 2020 until entering treatment in June 2021. In his September 2021 interview
with an investigator, he said that his alcohol use was “zero.” (Item 4 at 14.) He stated his
inpatient rehabilitation program had given him “the tools needed to abstain from alcohol.”
(Item 4 at 14.) In his November 2022 response to interrogatories, he acknowledged that
he continued to drink, but said that he had moderated his consumption and only drinks
one to two beers socially. He cited a recent Halloween party as an example. (Item 4 at
8.) He indicated he would be involved in an outpatient program. (Item 4 at 14.)
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentary evidence  and  did  not  respond  to  the
FORM.

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.d,  mostly  with
explanations. He admitted SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b, 3.a, 3.b, and 4.a-4.c, without comment. He
did not answer the cross-allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.c and 4.d. I construe those answers
as  denials.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  29  years  old.  He  has  never  married  and  he  has  no  children.  He
earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  2012  and  has  taken  some  college  courses.  He  has
been employed by a federal contractor as an information technology (IT) specialist since
August  2014.  He  testified  that  he  has  held  a  secret  or  interim  secret  clearance  since
2014, though he asserted  that he did not have  actual access to  classified  information.
He has held his current position as an IT team lead since May 2019. He has an annual
salary of about $96,000. He works on a military base. (GE 1; Tr. 12, 27-32, 61-65, 105)
In  March  2013,  Dr.  S  diagnosed  Applicant  with  major  depressive  disorder  and
atypical  depressive  disorder.  Dr.  S’s  notes  indicate  that  Applicant  “has  clinical
depression;  has  not  been  on  meds  for  several  months,  having  anxiety  attacks,  sleep
deprivation.”  He  was  brought  for  medical  attention  by  his  mother.  (GE  9)  He  did  not
seek medical approval before ceasing his medication at the time. (Tr. 68-70)
GE 8 is comprised of treatment records for Applicant from Dr. M and Dr. J from
September  2013  to  January  2019.  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  generalized  anxiety
disorder and atypical depressive disorder. He acknowledged experiencing symptoms of
depression and anxiety since age 12. (Tr. 65-67, 71-78, 80-81)
On or about September 27, 2017, Applicant then age 23, went to the emergency
room  (ER)  of  Hospital  C  complaining  of  depression  and  anxiety.  He  reported  drinking
alcohol and using cocaine as coping mechanisms, and that he had consumed a fifth of
alcohol and used cocaine the night before. He reported intermittent thoughts of suicide
(though  not  at  that  time)  but  has  never  had  a  plan.  (GE  5  at  1-2;  Tr.  83-85)  He  was
admitted to the hospital due to “suicidal ideation” (i.e., thoughts of suicide). (GE 2 at 13)
(SOR ¶ 1.a)
At  Hospital  C,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder,
recurrent,  moderate.  (GE  2  at  15)  He  was  discharged  from  Hospital  C  on  October  2,
2017 and referred to Treatment Center P for inpatient substance abuse treatment. (GE
2 at 15; Tr. 83-85) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 3.a) He was diagnosed at Treatment Center P with
alcohol  use  disorder,  severe;  cocaine  use  disorder,  severe;  cannabis  use  disorder,
severe, tobacco use disorder, mild; and major depressive disorder. (GE 6 at 2)
Treatment  Center  P  records  reflect  that  Applicant  reported  first using  alcohol  at
17. He was found to be severely dependent on alcohol, with daily reported use over the
previous three years. He reported drinking a fifth of alcohol 20 of the previous 30 days,
and  using  cocaine  five  of  the  previous  30  days,  before  his  ER  admission.  He  began
using marijuana at age 16 and used it for four years regularly. (GE 6 at 2; Tr. 79, 86-87)
(SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b)  During  his  testimony,  Applicant  asserted  that  the  frequency  of  his
cocaine  use,  as  reflected  in  GE  6,  is  inaccurate  as  he  only  recalled  or  acknowledged
using  cocaine  twice.  (Tr.  86-87)  He  denied  marijuana  use  within  30  days  of  entering
treatment. (Tr. 88; GE 6 at 2)
Applicant  did  not  complete  inpatient  treatment  at  Treatment  Center  P.  He  left
abruptly on October 14, 2017, reportedly because he did not want to be there anymore.
His  prognosis  was  poor  due  to  his  inability  to  successfully  complete  treatment.  It  was
noted that he  would benefit from readmission to residential treatment and involvement
in  a  12-step  program.  (GE  6  at  3;  Tr.  89)  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  It  was  recommended  that
Applicant  continue  to  abstain  from  alcohol  and  drugs;  that  he  consider  outpatient
psychiatric  treatment  and  behavioral  counseling;  attend  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA),
Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  or  other  meetings  daily;  and  submit  to  random  urinalysis
and  breath  analysis  as  directed.  (GE  6  at  1)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  not
done any of these things. (Tr. 90)
In December 2017, Applicant went to the ER at Hospital C due to insomnia and
acute anxiety after running out of his medication, Wellbutrin. He was not admitted. (GE
2 at 3. GE 7; Tr. 95-97) (SOR ¶ 3.b) Afterwards, his mother wrote a letter to his primary
care physician, Dr. J, about Applicant’s anxiety. (GE 8 at 8-9; Tr. 97)
Applicant  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  had  been  treated  for  depression  at
Hospital C in about September 2017 and needed to get on the right medication. (GE 1
at 24-25; Tr. 83) He reported being treated for alcohol use at Treatment Center P from
September to October 2017. (GE 1 at 27-28) He  did not report any  illegal drug use  in
the previous seven years; he reported no illegal drug involvement while in possession of
a clearance; and he reported no drug treatment. (GE 1 at 26-27) (SOR ¶¶ 4.a, 4.b) He
reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  had  been  previously  granted  a  clearance  by  DOD  but
provided no details. (GE 1 at 28-29)
Applicant  had  background  interviews  relating  to  his  SCA  in  September  2018,
May 2019, and July 2019. In his first interview, he verified his reported hospitalization at
Hospital C and said it was for depression. He also discussed his history of alcohol use.
He said he had not been diagnosed as abusing alcohol or being alcohol dependent. He
did not disclose any other issues of substance abuse. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 90)
In Applicant’s May 2019 interview, he said he was hospitalized at Hospital C for
one week for medication maintenance after his primary care physician, Dr. J, changed
his anti-depression medication. He said he was not hospitalized for any other condition.
He  discussed his substance abuse  counseling at Treatment Center  P, and his alcohol
involvement  and  history  at  the  time.  He  was  asked  if  he  had  used  illegal  drugs  in  the
past  seven  years,  to  include marijuana, and he  said  no.  (GE  2 at 8-10;  Tr.  83,  91-92)
(SOR ¶ 4.c) He acknowledged at his hearing that his time at Treatment Center P would
be considered drug counseling. (Tr. 92)
Applicant was interviewed a third time, in July 2019. He was confronted about his
prior marijuana and cocaine use. He said he had used cocaine once in 2017, then said
he used it once or twice between June 2011 and the present. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b) (Tr. 60)
He denied being a habitual user of cocaine and said his cocaine use was experimental.
He  said  he  used  marijuana  between  2008  and  late  2011  about  10  times  a  year,  with
varying frequency. He used it to help him sleep and to cope with depression. He said he
had  not used  marijuana  since  2011  and  had  not  used  cocaine  since  2017.  He  denied
intentionally omitting his illegal drug use from his SCA. Earlier in the interview, he said
he did not list his drug use because he believed it was not on record anywhere and was
not a problem. (GE 2 at 10-11; Tr. 92-93) (SOR ¶ 4.c)
Applicant also disclosed that the real reason for his hospitalization at Hospital C
in  2017  was  for  both  medication  maintenance  and  alcohol  treatment.  (GE  2  at  11-12)
He  authenticated  the  three  interview  summaries  as  accurate  in  a  signed  but  undated
interrogatory response. (GE 2)
In  November 2020,  Applicant participated  in a  psychological  evaluation  ordered
by  the  DOD  CAF  related  to  his  security  clearance  investigation.  The  evaluation  was
conducted  by  Dr.  B,  a  Ph.D.  licensed  clinical  psychologist.  She  reviewed  medical
records  provided  by  the  DOD  CAF,  as  well  as  his  SCA  and  background  interview
summaries.  She  also  conducted  a  clinical  interview,  testing  observations,  and  a
personality assessment inventory (PAI). (GE 3 at 1-2, GE 4) (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 3.c)
Applicant  told  Dr.  B  that  he  had  always  been  a  “casual”  drinker  and  had  never
engaged  in  binge  drinking.  He  drank  more  prior  to  his  2017  hospitalization  and  was
mixing  alcohol  with  his  prescribed  medications.  He  said  he  had  reduced  his  drinking
significantly since 2018, consuming a bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer a week. (GE 3
at 4) (SOR ¶ 1.d) He said he took Zoloft as needed and that he meets with his primary
care doctor every three months for refills. (GE  3 at 3, 4)
With respect to drug use, Applicant told Dr. B that he stopped smoking marijuana
at age 22. He acknowledged trying cocaine on “a couple of occasions in my past,” and
said he had only used cocaine twice in 2018. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b) He said his three-day
hospitalization in 2017 was due to switching medications and was “just to be safe.” He
did not disclose his 2017 substance abuse treatment at Center P or his subsequent ER
visit in 2017. It was noted that records from 2019 indicated that he has a history of not
being  fully  candid  about  his  cocaine  and  marijuana  use  during  interviews  and  in  his
case paperwork. (GE 3 at 4)
Dr.  B  found  that  Applicant  acknowledged  his  history  of  depression  and  anxiety
but tended to minimize  his symptoms. He “severely downplayed his history of alcohol,
cocaine,  and  marijuana  use  and  he  was  not  fully  candid  about  his  struggles  with
substances. His lack of candor “appears to be a pattern.” (GE 3 at 6)
Dr. B found Applicant’s lack of honesty regarding his history of substance abuse
“particularly concerning” since he failed to complete his residential treatment program in
2017;  he  was  given  a  poor  prognosis  by  counselors;  he  failed  to  follow  through  on
discharge  instructions;  had  not  received  mental  health  or  substance  abuse  treatment
since  2017  and  continued  to  consume  alcohol  at  a  fairly  high  level.  Dr.  B  found  that
Applicant’s  demonstrated  lack  of  honesty  impacted  the  credibility  of  his  self-reporting
about his prior drug use. His prognosis was “guarded, at best.” (GE 3 at 6)
Dr.  B.  diagnosed  Applicant  with  (1)  major  depressive  disorder  (moderate,
recurrent) (DSM 296.32); (2) alcohol use disorder, severe (DSM 303.90); (3) cannabis
disorder (severe) (DSM 304.30); and (4) stimulant use disorder (severe) (DSM 304.40).
(GE 3 at 6) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Dr.  B.  found  that  major  depressive  disorder  tends  to  be  a  chronic  and  highly
recurrent condition. Applicant has experienced symptoms since childhood. His tendency
to self-medicate, coupled with ongoing alcohol use, inadequate treatment and, “perhaps
most importantly, limited insight and transparency, point to a guarded prognosis. At this
time,  [Applicant’s]  diagnoses  could  pose  a  risk  to  his  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness concerning classified information.” (GE 3 at 6) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a,  because  he  said  he  never  had  or  expressed
thoughts  of  suicide.  (Tr.  33-34)  He  denied  SOR  ¶  1.b  because  he  said  he  abstained
from alcohol for a year, and sought therapy, but the doctor he consulted in late 2017 did
not  carry  his  insurance.  (Tr.  110)  He  did  not  pursue  mental  health  treatment  or
counseling after that or during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not done so since then.
(Tr. 110-111) He has consulted his primary care physician whom he has seen for many
years.  (Tr.  110-112)  He  is  currently  prescribed  propranolol  (anti-anxiety)  and  Zoloft
(anti-depressant).  (Answer;  Tr.  34-39)  He  said  he  continues  to  experience  “sundown
syndrome” (the worsening of his anxiety or depression at night). (Tr, 97-98; GE 8 at 8)
He denied mental health issues at work necessitating treatment. (Tr. 99)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  before  his  2017  treatment,  his  drinking  had
increased to four times a week, which he acknowledged was “binge drinking” and self-
medication, where “one day would lead to the next day.” (Tr. 42) He was consuming a
bottle of wine or a fifth of liquor per occasion. (Tr. 45-47, 78) He said it “took a while” to
realize what he was doing. He knows now that he cannot do that. This led him to self-
refer, with some family assistance, to Hospital C in 2017 for treatment and “so I can get
on the right medication.” (Tr. 43)
Applicant  said  he  left  Treatment  Center  P  because  of  anxiety  and  unfamiliarity
with  being  around  a  lot  of  people.  He  said  his  departure  did  not  relate  to  alcohol.  He
now  sees  that  he  should  have  completed  the  program.  He  recognizes  that  he  was  at
“rock-bottom” at the time and does not want to feel that way again. (Tr. 44-45)
Applicant said he resumed drinking socially after about a year of sobriety in about
2018  or  2019  but  consumed  less  alcohol.  (Tr.  39-41)  He  said  “I  knew  myself  enough
that, in a social capacity, I could be able to continue consuming alcohol.”  (Tr. 42) He did
so unilaterally, “coming [to] a personal moment, trying to, you know, see how I do.”  (Tr.
100)  He  acknowledged  that  this  was  “probably  not”   recommended.  He  found  it  a  “big
step”   that he could have one drink and then stop. (Tr. 101) Later, however, during the
COVID-19  pandemic,  when  he  was  at  home  teleworking  full  time,  he  on  occasion
consumed  a  whole  bottle  of  wine  or  a  12-pack  of  beer  at  home  at  one  sitting.  “Every
now and then throughout 2020 I did that,” he said. (Tr. 102)
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.c,  which  asserts  that  he  engages  in  ongoing  severe
substance  abuse.  (Answer;  Tr.  47-48)  He  testified  that  he  has  made  an  “agreement”
with himself to know his limits. He said he can go months without drinking. He continues
to have one or two drinks on dates or social occasions. He last had a drink three weeks
before the hearing, one or two drinks on a golf course, and then two months before that.
He said he had not been intoxicated in a year or more, when he had “a couple glasses
of mixed drinks” at his brother’s birthday party. (Tr. 49-51, 100)
Applicant  has  never  received  a  medical  opinion  that  he  could  drink  again.  (Tr.
102)  Since  2018,  he  has  sought  no  mental  health  counseling,  except  from  Dr.  J,  his
primary  care  physician.  He  sees  her  every  three  to  four  months  for  medication  refills
and for primary care treatment. He said he has “for the most part”  kept to his medication
regimen since his 2017 treatment, though he has continued drinking on days he took his
medication. He has not sought treatment in the ER since then. (Tr. 102-105)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  any  drug  or  alcohol  counseling  or  treatment
since  he  left  Treatment  Center  P.  He  has  not  participated  in  AA  meetings.  (Tr.  51-52,
112-113) He said he drinks alcohol less than once a week, and no longer consumes a
bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer at one sitting, as he did in 2020, at the time of  his
DOD evaluation by Dr. B. (Tr. 99-100)
Applicant said he had not used marijuana since 2011 and had not used cocaine
since  2017.  He  had  a  clearance  in  2017  when  he  used  cocaine.  He  used  it  twice,  in
social situations like at a bar. He acknowledged that cocaine and marijuana are illegal
under federal law and inconsistent with holding a clearance. He believes he is subject to
random drug testing at work. (Tr. 53-54, 88, 93-94, 105-107)
Applicant acknowledged that Dr. B’s report shows he used cocaine twice in 2018,
not  2017,  but  he  thinks  he  may  have  meant  2017.  (Tr.  107-108;  GE  3  at  4)  He  also
asserted that statements in Treatment Center P’s records that he used cocaine starting
at age 23 and used cocaine regularly for one year, including five of the past 3 days prior
to  September  26,  2017,  were  “not  accurate.”  Similarly,  he  denied  that  he  had  used
marijuana for four years regularly, asserting that he had not used marijuana since high
school.  (Tr.  108-109;  GE  6  at  2)  He  was  unable  to  explain  why  his  testimony
contradicted Dr. B’s records. (Tr. 109-110)
As to Guideline E, Applicant testified that he first applied for a clearance at age
20, and he was young and did not get good advice from his company on how to fill out
the SCA. He asserted that he did not disclose his 2011 marijuana use on his first SCA
(in 2014) due to naivety and because it occurred in high school, before he turned 18. He
graduated from high school in 2012. (Tr. 27-28, 55-59)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  did  not  disclose  his  2017  cocaine  use  or  his
2011 marijuana use on his 2018 SCA. (Tr. 54) He said he held a clearance at the time,
granted  sometime  after  2014.  (Tr.  57-58)  He  testified  that  he  did  not  input  any  new
information on his 2018 SCA. He was just told to “review this and just hit Okay.”  (Tr. 27-
28, 31) He did disclose  his treatments at Hospital C and Treatment  Center P  in 2017,
both  of  which  were  after  his  first  SCA.  (Tr.  32)  He  did  not  intend  to  mislead  the
government.  (Tr.  32)  He  said  he  came  clean  because  he  was  confronted  by  the
interviewer, who had evidence of his cocaine use in his medical records. (Tr. 56-57, 59-
60)
Applicant asserted that his future intention as to illegal drug use is “never to use.”
He  believes  he  is  “well  past  the  dependency  for  it  and  the  self-medication.”  He  will
continue drinking socially but will continue working on cutting back on his drinking. (Tr.
113-115) he said he always uses a ride-share service when he is out drinking and has
never had a DUI or been pulled over by the police. (Tr. 113-115)
Applicant has worked at his DOD job for his whole career. He cannot change the
past but can continue  to  work on  improving himself. He has had  no  criminal issues or
workplace issues. His personal issues have never affected his work life. (Tr. 28-30) He
closed his testimony by stating  that he has presented himself as best he can and has
come a long way in the last eight years. He feels blessed to be where he is today. He
loves his job and wants to continue his career. (Tr. 116-118)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  retained  counsel,  and  he  submitted  additional
exhibits.  In  a  post-hearing  Declaration,  he  said  he  wished  he  had  completed  the
program  at  Treatment  Center  P  in  2017,  but  still  learned  from  the  experience.  He
reaffirmed that he had not used cocaine or marijuana since leaving the facility. He said
that since his hearing, he has attended AA meetings. He did not see himself as “having
a problem” in the past but now acknowledges that “any use is [too] much.” He has dealt
with  clinical  depression  and  anxiety  for  most  of  his  adult  life  and  has  taken  them
seriously. He has begun vetting therapists so he can pursue regular care and continue
progressing. (AE C) Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent not to use illegal
drugs  in  the  future  and  acknowledged  that  any  violation  was  grounds  for  automatic
revocation of his clearance. (AE E)
Applicant  submitted  character  letters  from  two  longtime  friends  and  from  an
executive  with his employer.  They attest that  Applicant cares about  his job, his family,
his  friends,  and  his  career.  He  has  worked  hard  to  improve  himself.  He  is  very
trustworthy  personally  and  professionally.  He  is  more  mature  and  responsible  than  he
was earlier in his career. He is reliable, trustworthy, and emotionally stable. He should
retain his clearance. (AE D)
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard
",False
"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.d and 2.f. He partially admitted and
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 2.a
through 2.c, 2.e, 2.g, and 3.a. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees. He married
in  2004  and  divorced  in  2015.  He  has  a  15-year-old  child  from  the  marriage.  He  has
worked  for  federal  contractors  since  approximately  2007  and  for  the  same  federal
contractor since 2011. He has held a security clearance during this time without incident.
He was also employed part-time as an adjunct instructor for a college from 2006 to 2019.
(Tr. 41-43; GE 1)
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant started college when he was 18 years old, and he pledged a fraternity.
Alcohol use  was  part of  the  culture of  fraternity  membership  and  the  first  time  he  was
intoxicated was on pledge day in 1993. Before then he had experimented with alcohol
use infrequently but was never intoxicated. He lived in the fraternity house as a freshman
and every event at the fraternity house involved alcohol. He testified that while in college
he  regularly  used  alcohol  and  became  intoxicated.  He  said  that  while  he  was  married
from 2004 to 2015 he used alcohol on a limited basis but there were times he used it in
excess and to the point of intoxication. (Tr. 43-46)
In 1993, at the age of 18, Applicant was arrested and charged with consumption
of alcohol by a minor. He was a passenger in a car when it was pulled over by the police.
He was given a field sobriety test and failed. He pleaded no contest and was required to
attend a class for those charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and to
perform community service. He completed both requirements. (Tr. 46-47; GE 3)
In 1995, Applicant was driving from a club to his fraternity house. He was stopped
by  the  police,  given  a  field  sobriety  test,  and  failed.  A  blood  alcohol  test  was  not
administered. He was charged with DUI. He pleaded guilty, was required to attend DUI
school, perform community service, and was on probation. He completed the terms of the
sentence. (Tr. 47-48; GE 3)
In  1999,  Applicant  was  driving  to  his  fraternity  house  after  leaving  a  party.  He
completed a U-turn too fast and was stopped by police. He completed a field sobriety test
and was arrested because he was impaired. He was 24 years old at the time. He was
charged with DUI. He pleaded guilty. As part of his sentence, he was required to complete
a 12-week alcohol abuse treatment program, perform community service, and he was on
probation. Applicant credibly testified that since his 1999 DUI arrest and conviction, he
has had no additional police involvement regarding his alcohol use. He testified that he
was young and made some bad decisions. (Tr. 48-51; GE 3)
Applicant testified that to comply with his sentence, from April 2000 to September
2000, he attended the court-ordered group therapy as an outpatient. He said the therapy
was not specific to alcohol abuse. He successfully completed the program and did not
receive a diagnosis. There was no aftercare required. He testified that at that time he did
not feel like he needed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He said he tempered his
alcohol consumption but continued to drink. He finished college and moved on with his
life and left the fraternity scene. (Tr. 51-53, 130)
Applicant  testified  that  in  February  2019  he  changed  his  alcohol  consumption
because he thought he had a problem. He discussed it with his fiancée. He made the
decision  that  day  to  attend  an  alcohol  recovery  program  and  entered  the  program  the
same day. He said that he and his fiancée had arguments that were fueled by alcohol.
When they moved in together his alcohol consumption increased. She would drink two to
four  drinks  a  night  and  alcohol  was  part  of  their  relationship.  His  decision  to  attend
treatment ended their relationship. He said he did not think she wanted to live in a sober
house. He was in treatment for 30 days. During that time, she ended the relationship and
told him not to return to the house. They had been together for three years. He said the
break-up was emotionally crushing. (Tr. 55-58, 125-128)
After completion of the program, he was aware that he should not consume alcohol
and it was recommended he attend AA. He attended AA and leaned on the community
during his breakup and attended additional meetings. He said it was difficult to stay sober.
When he completed the rehabilitation program, he said he was never told of any type of
diagnosis. He attended AA for about a year until approximately March 2020 and stopped
because  he  was  not  comfortable  with  the  spiritual  aspect  of  AA.  Instead,  he  began  to
participate in Smart Recovery, which is an alternative to AA that has more of a cognitive
psychological  and scientific  approach  to  sobriety.  Participants  develop a  community of
people and meet regularly to analyze behavior and actions. He started by attending three
meetings a week, and since the spring of 2020, he attends weekly meetings. He finds it
is  easier  for  him  to  subscribe  to  their  program  than  to  AA.  He  did  not  receive  an
independent  evaluation  regarding  a  diagnosis  of  bipolar  disorder  while  in  treatment.
Applicant testified he told the treatment facility that he was being treated for the condition.
(Tr. 58-68, 139-144; AE E)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  April  2019.  He
questioned  some  of  the  information  the  investigator  included  in  the  summary  of  his
interview.  He  said  he  does  not  think  he  would  have  been  able  to  estimate  how  many
drinks he had per occasion while in college. He denied 6 to 12 beers every weekend. He
admitted that from December 2017 to February 2019 he was consuming alcohol three to
six times a week and towards the end of this period it was between 50-75 ml of vodka
each time. (Tr. 53-55, 132)
Applicant  admitted   he   relapsed   in  July  2021.  He  testified   that  he   had   not  really
accepted  that he  had  a  problem  or that he  was an  alcoholic. He was going  through  the
motions to  see  if he  could control himself. He started to  drink and  was unable to  stop for
several  days.  In   September  2021,  he   tried   to   drink  again  because   he   was  still   not
convinced that he did  not have control. He  binge  drank for several days.  (Tr. 68-72, 138-
139)
Applicant testified that on September 13, 2021, he had an epiphany and realized
he could not keep doing what he was doing. He committed to complete sobriety that day.
He acknowledged that he tested the waters before because he did not want to believe he
had no control over his alcohol consumption. He thought he could control it but could not.
He testified that he knows he can totally abstain, but if he has one drink, he cannot stop.
He  credibly  testified  that  he  will not  consume  alcohol  ever  again. He  accepts he  is an
alcoholic, and he will always be in recovery. He signed a letter of intent never to consume
alcohol  again.  He  admitted  that  in  the  past  he  may  have  said  he  would  not  consume
alcohol again and did, but when he made those statements, he had not accepted the fact
that he is not in control and is an alcoholic. He now has. (Tr. 68-76; AE K)
Psychological Conditions
From  about  August  2017  to  May  2018,  Applicant  received  treatment  from  a
counseling center. He was seen by Dr. T.S., a psychologist. He said he was in a new
relationship  and  was  having  anxiety.  Dr.  T.S.  diagnosed  him  with  adjustment  disorder
with  mixed  anxiety,  and  depressed  mood.  He  saw  her  minimally  once  a  month  and
sometimes twice a month. (Tr. 76-78, 82, 118-119; AE D)
Applicant testified that he received  treatment from J.A., a  nurse practitioner with  a
psychiatric  specialty,   from   about  April  2018   to   November  2020.  He  disputes  that  he
refused  medication  and  said  he  took all  prescribed  medication  as  required. He  said J.A.
diagnosed  him  with  bipolar disorder and  prescribed  him  between  10  and  15  medications.
He testified  that  some  of medications had  serious side  effects,  others  required  monitoring
through  blood  work; and  some  made  him  feel catatonic. His fiancée  at the  time  told him
he  needed  to  have  J.A. check his medications. J.A. conducted  her  work through  email
and changed  his medication  multiple times. He decided he could not accept her trial and
error approach. He and  J.A. frequently discussed  his medications and  dosages.  When
J.A. diagnosed  him  with  bipolar disorder,  he  said it was a  surprise  because  he  had  never
had   a   manic  episode.   He  researched   the   different  levels  of  bipolar   disorder,   and   he
believed   his  symptoms  could   be   attributed   to   other  psychological   disorders.  He   was
skeptical of  the  diagnosis but  agreed  to  continue  on  medication.  He testified  that J.A.  was
aware  that  he  consumed  alcohol but  not that  he  had  a  problem.  She  never mentioned
that a  potential alcohol  use  disorder could possibly mimic symptoms of bipolar disorder.
(Tr. 60, 78-83, 93, 119-125, 135-137; GE  4)
Applicant testified that he informed Dr. T.S. of J.A.’s diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
He  said  she  was  surprised  and  warned  him  to  be  cautious.  He  considered  getting  a
second opinion but thought he would give the medication a try. He testified  he always
followed J.A.’s directions when she changed his medications. He said he would continue
to  take  the  prescribed  medications  until  something  new  was  prescribed.  In  2020,  he
stopped seeing J.A. because she left the practice, and her new practice did not accept
his insurance. (Tr. 78-83)
In   December  2020,  Applicant  began   seeing   R.J.,   a   nurse  practitioner  with   a
psychiatric specialty. He  said she  did not believe  he  had  a  bipolar disorder,  and  she  did
not  treat   him   for  it.  Her  concern  was   his  insomnia.  She   prescribed   medication   for  his
insomnia.  He  testified  that  she  never diagnosed  him  with  bipolar disorder. He  informed
R.J. that he  had  gone  to  alcohol treatment  and  that he  had  an  alcohol use  disorder. He is
on  two  medications she  prescribed  that are not habit  forming  and  do  not interfere  with  his
commitment  to  sobriety. In  June  2021,  R.J.  left  the  practice  and  Applicant was transferred
as a  patient to M.B, a  nurse practitioner with  a psychiatric specialty.  (Tr. 83-89)
Applicant  continues   to   take   two   medications   prescribed   by  M.B.   and   she   has
changed   his  dosage   because   he   wants   to   take   as   little  medication   as   possible   and
minimize side effects.  He testified  that M.B. has not diagnosed him  with bipolar disorder.
She  is aware  of his past alcohol abuse.  A statement  was  provided  by M.B.  (March  18,
2022) verifying  that  Applicant  has  been  under her  care  since  June  2021  and  meets  with
her monthly. He has been  consistently compliant with  his treatment plan  and  reports long-
term   stability  at  current  medication   dosages.   He  has  diagnoses   of   sleep   disorder  and
generalized  anxiety disorder. She  described  him  as asymptomatic  for  several consecutive
months.  He is steadily cooperative, euthymic, clear, alert, insightful and  organized.  She
also noted  Applicant had  granted  permission  to release  his medical information,  and  she
was available to  provide  additional information. He plans to  continue  his treatment with
M.B. (Tr. 89-95, 148; AE C)
Applicant testified that when he was being treated by J.A. he felt terrible. He said
since being treated by M.B. he is able to function and feels balanced. He described his
functioning level as the difference between night and day, from when he was being treated
by J.A. He now has his issues under control with the treatment provided by M.B. He has
followed  her  treatment  plan  and  credibly  testified  that  he  would  not  discontinue  any
medication without consultation from a medical professional. (Tr. 89-95)
Since September 2022, Applicant also has been a patient of J.B, a licensed clinical
social worker. He meets with her at least monthly and sometimes twice a month. He sees
her about dealing with his sobriety and how to lead a sober life and potentially having a
romantic  relationship  in  the  future.  She  provided  a  letter  stating  Applicant  has  been
consistently compliant with his treatment plan and attendance. He is engaged in therapy
to better himself in both his personal and professional life and relationships. He continues
to exhibit long-term stability in his sobriety and medication compliance. (AE J)
Applicant testified that he is not afraid to seek help and has been proactive since
2017 with regards to his mental health. He is committed to maintaining his medication
and treatment. If he believed he was bipolar he would seek the necessary treatment and
follow prescribed protocol. (Tr. 108-110)
The  DOD requested  that Applicant participate  in a  psychological evaluation  by  a
government-approved  psychologist. In  June  2021,  he  was evaluated  by Dr.  B. Applicant
testified that he  had a  43-minute virtual meeting using  the Zoom  platform.  Dr. B  sent him
a   computer   link  to   complete   a   multiple   choice   test  that  took   approximately  an   hour  to
complete. He described  her as clinical and  not open. He did  not feel comfortable with  her
because  of her demeanor, so  he  was not comfortable discussing  private  matters in his
life  with  her. She  made  no  attempt to  make  him  feel comfortable.  Her questions were  not
open   ended,   but  rather  required   a   yes   or no   answer,   so   that   is  the   type   of   answer  he
provided. He  said  he  told Dr. B  that J.A.  had  diagnosed  him  with  bipolar disorder, but  later
R.J.  did   not  agree   with   the   diagnosis.   He  testified   that  Dr.   B   did   not  discuss  bipolar
disorder with  him.  He  said he  was honest,  but not  open  because  of the  way  she  conducted
the  interview. He answered the questions she asked. He disputed several of the facts as
inaccurate that Dr. B used in  her evaluation. (Tr. 95-104)
Dr. B noted that Applicant was cooperative but his answers were inconsistent with
medical documentation. She administered the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).
The  validity  scales  indicated  considerable  defensiveness.  She  said,  “[H]e  appears
motivated to portray himself as being exceptionally free of common shortcomings to which
most individuals will admit.” She believed due to this, his PAI clinical scale is unlikely to
be a valid reflection of his current level of functioning. She found his treatment motivation
is a great deal lower than of typical individuals being seen in treatment settings. (GE 5)
Dr. B diagnosed Applicant based on her interview, a review of available records
and an analysis of current psychological results as follows: bipolar disorder, unspecific;
generalized anxiety disorder; and alcohol use disorder, severe. She could not determine
if  he  had  type  I  or  type  II  bipolar  disorder. She  noted  he  had  been  noncompliant  with
treatment for both anxiety and bipolar disorder. She noted he was not forthcoming with
information about his alcohol use, which suggested he is unlikely to be fully in recovery.
She noted his lack of candor. She believed he was at high risk of relapse for his alcohol
use disorder, as well as manic and/or depressive episodes. She believed he has been
dishonest, making his trustworthiness questionable. She found he may not follow rules
and regulations and had multiple conditions that could impact his conduct. She found he
could display poor judgment and reliability and that he was at risk for impulsive behavior.
His  ability  to  safeguard  classified  information  is  likely  to  be  compromised  and  his
prognosis is poor. It does not appear she contacted Applicant’s treating therapist or nurse
practitioner or any of the others. (GE 5)
On February 10, 2023, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. C, a licensed psychologist.
She noted that she was privy to the SOR allegations and a reported diagnosis of bipolar
disorder, general anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder. She also noted that it was
alleged  that  Applicant  reportedly  had  been  dishonest  to  Dr.  B  about  his mental health
treatment  and  alcohol  use  that  called  into  question  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and
good  judgment.  Dr.  C conducted  her  examination  through  video-teleconference.  Dr.  C
asked Applicant his perspective about the allegations in the SOR, and he indicated that
it all started when he checked himself in for alcohol rehabilitation and it was required to
be reported to DOD. (Tr. 104; AE A)
Dr. C reviewed the SOR, documents from his counseling services, Dr. B’s report,
behavioral recovery certificate, and miscellaneous records and letters from his previous
treatment  providers.  She  also  conducted  a  semi-structured  clinical
interview,
observations, administration of objective personality measure, PAI, and subjective report
symptoms  via  the  Clinically  Useful  Depression  Outcome  scale,  Post-traumatic  Stress
Disorder checklist, drug abuse screening test, mood disorder questionnaire, and alcohol
use disorder identification kit, among other tests. (AE A)
Dr. C noted that J.A. diagnosed Applicant with bipolar disorder in April 2018 but
noted  that  diagnostically  it  was  unclear  from  the  medical  record  why  J.A.  believed
Applicant  met  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  bipolar  as  it  does  not  appear  he  specifically
endorsed  symptoms  of  mania  or  hypomania.  She  noted,  however,  that  Applicant  did
endorse excessive use of alcohol in June 2018 and that J.A. should have re-evaluated
her  diagnostic  impression.  Dr.  C  noted  that  Applicant  saw  J.A.  monthly  and  reported
concerns  of  depression  and  alcohol misuse  secondary  to  relationship  distress  until  he
self-referred to alcohol treatment in February 2019. (AE A)
Dr. C noted that Applicant reported he was coping with stress through alcohol and
he was becoming a person he did not want to be. He was drinking a fifth of vodka or more
daily. He reported his fiancée broke up with him during treatment and he also lost friends
who took her side. He said while participating in treatment he was diagnosed with bipolar
disorder II, generalized anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. Dr. C asked Applicant
why  he  believed  he  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  disorder,  and  he  indicated  “well  I  told
them I was diagnosed with it and they had to keep me on my medication because you
can’t just  go  off  that medication.” After he  completed treatment, he returned to therapy
with  J.A.  who  subsequently  left  the  practice.  Applicant  told  Dr.  C  after  he  completed
alcohol  treatment,  he  wondered  if  he  met  the  criteria  for  bipolar  disorder  and  said  he
asked  to  be  re-evaluated  because  he  had  discontinued  use  of  alcohol.  When  he  was
transferred to R.J. she re-evaluated him and diagnosed him with primary insomnia and
alcohol use disorder in remission until May 2021. (AE A)
Dr. C noted that in June 2021, Applicant began treatment with M.B., and continues
to  see  her  monthly  to  this  day.  She  has  never  diagnosed  him  with  mood  disorder  but
instead with generalized anxiety disorder and sleep disorder. He is prescribed medication
and has reportedly been compliant with all treatment sessions and medication. (AE A)
Dr. C also noted that Applicant sees J.B., a licensed clinical social worker. He has
seen her biweekly since approximately September 2022 with care focused predominately
on  increased  anxiety  in  social  interactions  since  COVID.  Applicant  reported  that  the
majority of his treatment is focused on what his social life will look like now that he is sober
and trying not to be a hermit. (Tr. 107; AE A)
Applicant disclosed to Dr. C that he has been sober since September 13, 2021,
and  that  he  relapsed  twice  when  he  tested  the  waters  to  see  if  he  could  control  his
drinking. (AE A)
Dr. C specifically and thoroughly focused her clinical interview and questions about
symptoms  of  bipolar  disorder.  She  stated:  “Upon  further  inquiry,  it  is  possible  that  his
previous  provider,  [J.A.]  misidentified  his  symptoms  of  substance  use  with  those  of
hypomania  and  failed  to  appropriately  reevaluate  his  symptom  presentation  upon  his
sobriety.” (AE A page 5)
Dr. C had Applicant complete several psychological screeners. The results of the
tests are as follows:
Clinically Useful Depressive Outcome Scale = 1, not suggestive of depression.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 = 0, not suggestive of anxiety.
PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 = 5, not suggestive of trauma disorder.
Alcohol  Use  Disorders  Identification   Test  =   2,  suggestive  of  low  risk  alcohol
consumption at this time.
Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 = 0, not suggestive of problematic drug use.
Mood Disorder Questionnaire  = not indicative of a mood disorder diagnosis.
Dr. C concluded:
Collectively,  [Applicant’s]   scores  on   these   screeners  reflect  an   individual
who  is not experiencing  significant symptoms of psychological distress at
this  time   but   has  had   difficulties   with   alcohol  misuse   in   the   distant  past.
Consistent  with   self-report,  [Applicant]   endorsed   a   pronounced   history  of
alcohol use  since  college  but not understanding  the  true  impact of alcohol
use on his functioning  until approximately 2018. (AE A)
Dr. C was asked whether she agreed or disagreed with Dr. B’s findings. She stated:
In   general,  as   an   objective   third   party  to   [Dr.  B’s]  report,  I   found   the
evaluation  to  be  lacking  in thoroughness  and  objectivity given  the  gravity of
the  circumstances for which  the  evaluation  was conducted.  This ultimately
casts doubt on  the  reliability and  validity of the  findings. [Dr.  B] repeatedly
relied   on   historical  data   without  providing   context  or  an   opportunity  for
[Applicant]  to  provide  insight into  the  factors that contributed  to  conflicting
information.  (AE  A)
Dr.  C  provided  specific  details  of  why  she  questioned  Dr.  B’s  findings.  She
specially  noted  that  Dr.  B’s  diagnoses  of  bipolar  disorder,  unspecified;  alcohol  use
disorder, severe were primarily based on historical data with limited current behavioral
examples  that  would  have  helped  to  understand  how  she  arrived  at  these  diagnostic
conclusions. Dr. C stated:
There  was  also  no   evidence   that  she   conducted   a   contemporaneous,
structured   or  semi-structured   review  of  bipolar  disorder  (to   include
hypomanic  or  manic)   symptoms   before  labeling   [Applicant]   with   this
condition  that he  denied  having  at the  time  of her evaluation. It  appears [Dr.
B] relied  heavily on  a  combination  of inaccurate  historical medical data  and
the   results  of  the   Personality  Assessment   Inventory  (PAI),  which   was
notably lacking in elevations and specificity. (AE A  page 7)
Dr.  C  concluded  that  in  her  opinion  Dr.  B’s  evaluation  lacks  rigor  and  specificity  and
should  not  be  used  as  a  primary  aid  in  making  decisions  about  [Applicant’s]  security
clearance eligibility. (AE A)
Dr. C diagnosed Applicant with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia Disorder,
and  Alcohol Use  Disorder, Moderate, in  Sustained  Remission.  She did not find  evidence
to  support a  diagnosis of  Bipolar Disorder II.  She  noted  that  Applicant has  a  history of
symptoms  that  could  be  misconstrued  as  hypomanic in  the  context of an  active  substance
use   disorder.  She   noted   his  previous  provider  failed   to   adequately  and   appropriately
reevaluate  his symptom  presentation  based  on  his subsequent sobriety.  She  also noted
that   Dr. B   continued   to  fail   to   adequately evaluate  [Applicant’s] presentation   during   her
evaluation,   instead   relying   on   erroneous  historical  data   and   PAI   results  that  failed   to
provide rationale for the diagnoses offered. (AE A)
Dr. C stated Applicant’s prognosis is good. She found Applicant presently met the
diagnostic  criteria  for  mental  health  conditions  that  are  well  controlled  or  currently  in
sustained remission. Although he meets the criteria for several mental health conditions,
he  is  receiving  appropriate  mental  health  care  for  these  conditions  and  is  actively
implement
engaged,  receptive
interventions offered by his treating providers. She found he does not currently have a
mental health condition that could cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment,
or ability to safeguard sensitive or classified information or that would impair his reliability,
trustworthiness or judgment in protecting sensitive or classified information. (AE A page

"Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since October 2020. He served on active duty in the U.S. military
from 2007 to 2011. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since he
was  in  the  military.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2019  and  a  master’s  degree  in
2022. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17, 49; GE 1, 9;
AE B, E, F)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  substance  abuse,  alcohol-related  incidents,  and
criminal conduct. On several occasions between about July 2010 and January 2011, he
used  synthetic  marijuana,  commonly  known  as  “spice.”  It  appears  that  the  substance
was not on the schedule of controlled substances at the time, but the military prohibited
the  use  of  any  substance,  other  than  alcohol  or  tobacco,  for  the  purpose  of  altering
mood  or  function.  He  received  nonjudicial  punishment  under  Article  15  of  the  Uniform
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in March 2011 for violating Article 92 of the UCMJ, in
that  he  was  “derelict  in  the  performance  of  [his]  duties  in  that  [he]  willfully  failed  to
refrain from using the substance commonly known as ‘spice.’” He was reduced one pay
grade, ordered to perform extra duty for 30 days, and forfeited $300. The forfeiture was
suspended.  In  May  2011,  he  was  discharged  for  misconduct  (drug  abuse)  with  a
general  under  honorable  conditions  discharge.  (Tr.  at  24-29,  49-50;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 8, 9; AE F)
Applicant  testified  that  he  consulted  with  an  attorney  before  his  Article  15
punishment and discharge. He  stated that he  “was under the impression that had  [he]
elected to talk to an attorney that it would have went down to a court. And [he] would not
have been able  to  get the general discharge.”  When he was  informed that  he initialed
the record of nonjudicial punishment proceedings indicating that he had consulted with
a lawyer, he stated that he did not recall seeing a judge advocate. (Tr. at 28-29; GE 8)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  State  A  in  December  2013  and  charged  with  driving
under  the  influence  (DUI).  The  police  report  indicates  that  Applicant  was  drinking  in  a
bar/restaurant,  when  he  was  refused  further  alcohol  service  because  he  was
intoxicated. The business called a taxi, but he did not accept the taxi. The manager told
Applicant  that  if  he  attempted  to  drive,  the  manager  would  call  the  police.  Applicant
drove away anyway and was stopped not long after when the police noticed his erratic
driving.  The  officer  noted  a  strong  odor  of  alcohol  and  other  indicators  that  Applicant
was  intoxicated.  He  stumbled  as  he  got  out  of  his  car,  and  his  zipper  was  down.  He
refused to participate in a field sobriety test, and he refused to provide a breath or blood
sample. (Tr. at 30-32, 51; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 7)
Applicant  pleaded   guilty   or  no   contest.   He  may   have   received   deferred
sentencing   in   which   he   paid  a   fine   and   court  costs,  and   he   was  on   unsupervised
probation  for a  year. He testified  that he  did  not have  a  good  memory of what led  to  his
arrest, and  he  did not  recall  if he  was intoxicated  when  he  left  the  bar. (Tr. at 30-33,  51-
53; Applicant’s  response to  SOR; GE  7, 9)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  March  2014  in  State  B  and  charged  with  public
drunkenness. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine of about $500. He does not remember
many details of what occurred other than it was outside his home. (Tr. at 33-36, 55-58;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6, 9)
Applicant  was  drinking  at  a  bar/restaurant  in  State  C  in  March  2016.  The  staff
offered him options for a safe ride home, but he refused. The staff called the police and
reported that Applicant left the establishment, was possibly intoxicated, and intended to
drive home. The police arrived, and the staff pointed out Applicant, who was not far from
his car. The police officer noted clear signs that Applicant was intoxicated, and he was
shoeless with mud around his legs up to his knees. There is a lake near the restaurant,
and  the  officer  deduced  that  Applicant  walked  into  the  lake  despite  the  temperature
being  about  44  degrees.  Applicant  told  the  officer  he  was  walking  home,  but  he  was
walking  in  the  wrong  direction.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  have  his  car  keys,  but  they
were found in his pocket. (Tr. at 37-40, 59-61; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5, 9)
Applicant  was  arrested  for  the  above  incident  and  charged  with  public
intoxication. He pleaded no contest or guilty to the charge and paid a fine of about $500.
(Tr. at 37-39, 59-61; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5, 9)
Applicant provided inconsistent testimony about the incident. He initially testified:
I  went to  another bar late  at  night  alone,  by  myself.  And  I drank  too  much,
to  excess. And  I didn’t want to  drive  home  because  I knew I had  too  much
to drink so I  attempted  to walk home.
This is when  the  officer, officer  stopped  me  when  I was  walking  home.  He
performed  a  field sobriety  test and  determined  I was intoxicated  in public.
(Tr. at 37)
Two questions later, he answered that he could not recall if he was intoxicated when he
left the restaurant. He also stated that he could not recall if he walked in the lake. (Tr. at
37, 60)
Applicant was drinking at a bar (not same bar as above 2016 incident) in State C
in January 2017. The waitress cut him off and tried to take his keys. At least one person
called  the  police  at  about  0210  and  reported  that  a  car  hit  a  curb,  and  the  driver
(Applicant)  was  standing  in  the  middle  of  the  street  and  appeared  to  be  intoxicated.
Applicant  was  extremely  intoxicated.  His  blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  was
measured at .279%. (Tr. at 40-41, 61-64; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 9)
Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI)  with  a
blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  of  .15%  or  greater.  In  February  2017,  he  pleaded
guilty to the lesser charge of DWI. He was sentenced to fines and court fees of $1,600,
confinement in the county jail for 180 days (suspended for 180 days), and probation for
one  year.  Applicant  stated  that  he  thought  it  was  a  deferred  adjudication,  but  there  is
nothing  in  the  court  records  to  corroborate  that  assertion.  (Tr.  at  40-41,  61-63;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4, 9)
In January 2020, police responded to a report that two individuals were fighting in
the  parking  lot  of  a  bar  in  State  C  at about 2346.  Applicant  was  found  on  the  ground.
The  other  individual  (described  by  Applicant  as  an  acquaintance)  forcibly  stopped
Applicant from driving home. Applicant admitted to the police officer that he had “a lot”
to drink, he was intoxicated, and he planned to drive home until he was stopped by the
other individual. Applicant admitted in his response to the SOR that he was drinking that
night,  but  he  “was  not  binge  drinking  or  drinking  to  excess.”  (Tr.  at  42-44,  65-67;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 9)
Applicant  was  arrested  for  the  above  incident  and  charged  with  public
intoxication. He pleaded no contest or guilty to the charge and paid a fine of about $350.
He has little memory of the incident. (Tr. at 42-44, 65-67; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 2, 9)
Applicant admitted that he had drinking issues, but he does not believe he is an
alcoholic, and he does not believe that he currently has a drinking problem.  He stated
that, except  for  his  use  of  spice  in the military,  he  has  never used illegal drugs.  In  his
response to the SOR, he indicated that “it was in his best interest to refrain from alcohol
consumption  entirely.”  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  in  August  2022  stating  that  he
discontinued drinking, and that he intended  “to abstain from alcohol use in the future.”
He has maintained his “sobriety,” which he described as not drinking to intoxication, for
more than a year. The last time he had anything to drink was in May 2023 when he had
three  beers  with  his  father  at  a  baseball game.  He  is  fitness  oriented  and  goes  to  the
gym  about  five  times  a  week.  He  is  attending  graduate  school  in  pursuit  of  another
master’s degree. (Tr. at 18-21, 27, 46-51, 69-73; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A, I,

I did not find Applicant credible. I find that the reports into his conduct are more
reliable than Applicant, and that he committed the conduct alleged in the reports.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.g,
2.a,  3.a,  3.b,  5.a,  and  5.b.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  4.a.  His

Applicant  is  a   38-year-old   systems   engineer  employed   by  defense   contractors
since  June  2012. He was unemployed  from  June  to  November 2014  when  he  left  a  job
by  mutual  agreement  after  he   was  accused   of  making   a   racial  comment  to   a   female
servicemember and  touching  her hair  without consent.  He served  on  active  duty  in the
U.S.  Navy  from   August  2004   to   May  2012   and   received   a   general  discharge   under
honorable conditions.
Applicant has never married. He  lived  with  a  cohabitant  from  November  2017  to
April 2020. Before they  separated, he  and  his cohabitant had  difficulties due  in part to
his sexually suggestive text message exchanges with five other women. (GX 12 at 2; Tr.
57) He has a  four-year-old son, and  he  shares custody of his son  with  his son’s mother,
his  former cohabitant. (Tr. 56)
Applicant received a security clearance in January 2006, while he was on active
duty in the Navy. His clearance was revalidated in 2013, while he was employed by a
defense contractor.
In  January  2002,  Applicant  was  charged  with  underage  possession  of  alcohol.
He  was  fined  and  his driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six  months.  (GX  1  at  43-44;
GX 13 at 2)
In  January  2003,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  reckless  driving  resulting  in  an
accident. (GX 11) The accident occurred when he drove too fast around a curve and hit
a  guardrail.  No  other  vehicles  were  involved.  He  had  not  been  consuming  alcohol
before driving. (Tr. 58)
In  August 2003, Applicant  was  convicted of  reckless  driving by  driving  92 miles
per  hour (mph)  in  a  55-mph  zone.  The  record  reflects  that  the  maximum  sentence  for
this offense was six months in jail, but it does not reflect the sentence that was imposed.
(GX 10)
In  December  2007,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  driving  under  the  influence  of
intoxicants  (DWI).  His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was  .24, well above the  legal limit.
He  was  fined  $350,  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six  months,  and  he  was
required to attend alcohol safety classes. (Tr. 59-60; GX 5 at 7-8)
In November 2009, Applicant was again convicted of DWI. He was sentenced to
jail  for  12  months  and  five  days,  all  of  which  was  suspended.  He  was  placed  on
unsupervised probation,  and his driver’s  license  was  suspended  for one  year. He  was
required to attend alcohol safety classes. (Tr. 60-61; GX 5 at 5)
In  October 2011, Applicant was charged  with  DWI,  2nd  offense  within five  years
and  refusal to  submit to  a breath  test.  He was convicted of DWI and  sentenced  to  jail for
12  months  and  five  days, with  11  months  and  15  days suspended.   His driver’s license
was suspended  for 36  months, and  he  was required  to  complete  alcohol safety classes.
(GX 5  at  5-6;  Tr. 62) Disposition  of  the  charge  of refusing  to  submit  to  a  breath  test  was
deferred and then dismissed in March 2013. (Tr. 66; GX 5  at 6)
While  Applicant  was  in  jail,  he  missed  the  sailing  of  his  ship,  and  he  received
nonjudicial  punishment  for  unauthorized  absence,  missing  movement,  and  violating  a
general  order  or  regulation.  (Tr.  64)  In  May  2012,  he  received  a  general  discharge
under honorable conditions, based on a pattern of misconduct. (GX 1 at 22)
While  Applicant  was  pending  discharge  from  the  Navy,  he  self-referred  to  the
Navy  Substance  Abuse  Rehabilitation  Program  (SARP)  and  completed  a  31-day
inpatient  rehabilitation  program.  His  alcohol  use  declined  after  he  completed  the
program. He stopped drinking between 2014 and 2016. (GX 3 at 4)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  job  for  making  a  racially
insensitive comment to a coworker, an enlisted woman in the Air Force. He considered
the coworker a good friend. While off-duty he offered his coworker a drink because he
had  two  drinks  in  front  of  him.  She  declined,  and  he  made  a  comment  that  she
interpreted  as  racial  profiling.  She  complained  to  their  supervisor,  and  he  was
terminated. Applicant disclosed this incident in his SCA as follows:
Formal  complaint  regarding  professionalism  was  submitted  by  Air  Force
member  against  me.  Terminated  by  company  without  being
fully
investigated. . . . Formal complaint stated I made racial comments towards
Air  Force  member  and  touched  her  hair  without  consent.  Air  Force
member  attempted  to  take  complaint  back  during  investigation  however
company found it easier to terminate than continue with investigation.
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  January  2021,  he
told the investigator that he offered his coworker a red fruit punch drink and, when she
declined,  he   told   her  that   everyone   loves  red   fruit  punch.   (GX  12   at  2).  He   told   the
investigator  that  he   was  called   into   his  manager’s  office  on   the   following   morning   and
told  that   he   was   terminated   effective   immediately.   He  told  the   investigator  that  his
employer  did   not  conduct  an   investigation   because   the   Air   Force   member  no   longer
worked   in  the   building.  However,  when   the   Air   Force  investigated   the   incident,   they
found   that  the   Air   Force   member’s  complaint  was  “incorrect.”  He   told  the   investigator
that  his   employer  later  determined   that  the   coworker’s  complaint   was  unfounded   and
offered   him   another  job   within  the   company,   but  he   no   longer  wanted   to   work  for  the
company.  (GX 12  at 2)  The  record  does not contain  any  documentation  of  the  complaint
against  Applicant,  the   investigation   of  that   complaint,  or   the   termination   of   Applicant’s
employment.
In August 2019, Applicant and his cohabitant hosted a joint birthday party for him
and  her  son,  which  was  attended  by  about  30  guests,  including  Applicant’s  neighbor
and his neighbor’s granddaughter. The party ended at about 2:00 am. Applicant testified
that  he  consumed  three  or  four  beers  during  the  day  but  did  not  believe  he  was
intoxicated. (Tr. 76)
Applicant  testified  that,  while  cleaning  up  after  the  party,  he  noticed  that  his
cohabitant’s son was not in his room, and he could not find him anywhere in the house.
He knew that some of the children who had attended the party were spending the night
in his neighbor’s house. He texted his neighbor, asking if his cohabitant’s son was at the
neighbor’s house. When the neighbor did not respond to the text, Applicant went to the
neighbor’s  house  and  knocked  on  the  door,  but  no  one  responded.  Applicant  then
entered the house through an unlocked back door and asked a friend of the cohabitant’s
son  if  he  was  in  the  house,  and  the  friend  stated  that  he  was  “in  the  back.”  Applicant
looked  in  one  bedroom,  but  the  cohabitant’s  son  was  not  there.  He  then  went  to  a
second bedroom and saw a person in bed who had blonde hair similar to the son’s hair.
He testified that he “just kind of peeked in,” “might have had one foot in the door to peek
around  the  door,”  and  softly  called  out  the  cohabitant’s  son’s  name.  The  neighbor’s
granddaughter, who was sleeping in the bed, was startled. He apologized and told the
granddaughter that he was looking for his cohabitant’s son, and she responded that the
son  was  “on  the  couch.”  (Tr.  42-43,  50)  He  found  his  cohabitant’s  son  under  some
blankets.  At  about  this  time,  the  neighbor  came  out  of  his  bedroom  and  confronted
Applicant. Applicant apologized, explained why he was there, and left.
The neighbor’s granddaughter called the police and told them that Applicant had
attempted  to  kiss her, caressed  her hips,  and  invited  her  to  “do  some  coke”  with  him.
The  granddaughter  also  told  the  police  that  Applicant  had  touched  her  breasts  during
the party on the previous day.
Applicant was charged with felony breaking and entering with intent to commit a
misdemeanor  and  sexual  battery.  He  was  represented  by  an  attorney  at  the  trial.
Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to trespassing and assault and battery,
both  misdemeanors.  He  was  sentenced  to  one  year  in  jail,  suspended  for  five  years,
conditioned on good behavior, completing a ten-week alcohol-abuse treatment program,
and having no contact with the victim or the victim’s family. He will be on probation until
November 2024. In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he admitted trespassing,
but he maintained that he was not guilty of the assault and battery and that he pleaded
guilty to avoid jail time.
Applicant’s neighbor testified  on  his behalf at the  hearing.  His neighbor testified
that  they  continued  to  have  casual  contact  with  each  other  after  the  August  2019
incident.  His  neighbor  also  testified  that  his  granddaughter  had  several  “traumatic
issues” in her life and that at the time of the incident, “she was seeking a lot of attention
and  known  to  tell  fibs.”  (Tr.  28)  He  stopped  short  of  testifying  that  his  granddaughter
was  lying,  but  said  that  he  was  skeptical  about  her  accusation  against  Applicant.  (Tr.
28-29, 33-34)
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  January  2021,  he
told  the  investigator  that  before  his  last  DUI,  he  drank  six  to  twelve  beers  about  four
times a  week,  but he stopped drinking for two  years beginning in 2014. At  the time of
the interview, he had resuming drinking. He told the investigator that he consumed two
or three beers about once a week, but that about once a year he drank about six beers
and became intoxicated. (GX 12 at 3)
In  November  2021,  Applicant  underwent  a  psychological  evaluation  at  the
request of the DOD CAF. The evaluation was conducted by video teleconference.  The
psychologist  noted  that  he  “presented  in  this  evaluation  with  a  moderately  antisocial
manner,” “appeared to minimize his responsibility in the problem situations described in
his  background  information,”  and  “blamed  others  in  instances  that  appeared  to  be
matters  of  his  own  lack  of  behavioral  control.”  The  psychologist  concluded  that
Applicant attempted to mislead him about the details of past events to cast himself in a
more positive light than may have been warranted by his actions.
Applicant  told  the  psychologist  that  he  suffered  an  estimated  20  instances  of
broken  bones  in  his  lifetime,  engaging  in  sky  diving,  riding  an  off-road  four-wheeler,
playing  basketball,  and  being  punched  in  the  face.  (GX  3  at  3)  At  the  hearing,  he
admitted that he has always been a high-energy, adventuresome person. (Tr. 51)
The  psychologist  found  that  if  Applicant  entered  his  neighbor’s  home  for  the
purpose  of  sexual  encounter  with  the  neighbor’s  granddaughter,  and  touched  her  and
confined  her  in  her  room  for  a  time,  particularly  if  he  was  intoxicated,  “then  this  act
would represent a nexus between his alcohol use problems, antisocial style, impulsivity,
and  stimulus  seeking  tendencies.”  He  diagnosed  Applicant  with  “alcohol-use  disorder,
severe,  in  sustained  remission  (by  subject  report).”  He  suggested  the  following  as
“diagnostic  possibilities,”  stopping  short  of  a
formal  diagnosis:  attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominately hyperactive/impulsive presentation;
and other specified personality disorder (with features of antisocial personality disorder).
The  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant’s  ADHD  symptoms  and  a  history  of
alcohol  use  did  not  present  a  significant  risk  to  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and
judgment,  but  that  “his  personality  condition  certainly  could  contribute  to  a  lack  of
trustworthiness
information.”  The  psychologist
concluded  that  Applicant’s  prognosis  “is  uncertain  given  that  he  did  not  seem  to  be
entirely forthright with [him].” (GX 3 at 9)
in  safeguarding  national  security
The  psychologist  listed  the  following  examples  of  inconsistencies  in  information
provided by Applicant that suggested a lack of candor:
•  Applicant told him that he could not remember when he last drank
more  than  three  beers,  but  he  told  an  investigator in  2021  that  he
drinks six or more beers and becomes intoxicated once a year.
•  Applicant used  the  term  “retired” to  describe  his departure from  the
Navy even though he  was discharged  for misconduct.
•  Applicant  said   that   he   “left”  a   job   in  2014   when   in  fact   he   was
terminated  because  of  a  racially related  comment, and  he  provided
an  exculpatory explanation  of the  event,  when  the  records reflected
that he “very likely” made racially offensive remarks.
•  Applicant pleaded guilty to a crime but told the psychologist that he
did not sexually assault the victim.
•  Applicant told him that he had consumed some alcohol but was not
intoxicated on the night of the alleged sexual assault in 2019.
The psychologist’s conclusion that Applicant was not “entirely forthright” appears
to  be  based  on  the  psychologist’s  conclusion  that  all  the  allegations  against  Applicant
probably  were  supported  by  the  evidence.  While  Applicant’s  guilty  pleas  at  his  trial
would justify a conclusion that he trespassed into his neighbor’s home and touched the
neighbor’s  granddaughter,  the  psychologist  apparently  believed  that  Applicant  groped
his neighbor’s granddaughter at the party, touched her inappropriately after he entered
his neighbor’s house, looking for his cohabitant’s son, and invited her to “do coke” with
him.  The  civil  authorities  did  not  charge  Applicant  with  groping  the  granddaughter  or
offering cocaine to her, and these acts were not alleged in the SOR.
The psychologist also appeared to believe that Applicant made an inappropriate
remark to a coworker that caused him to be fired.  The psychologist stated in his report
that  he  was  told  by  Applicant’s  mother  that  he  made  a  comment  such  as  “all  black
people like Kool-Aid.” (GX 3 at 3) There is no statement from Applicant’s mother in the
record.  There  is  no  record  of  the  investigation  of  the  complaint.  The  psychologist
determined  that  Applicant’s  description  of  what  he  said  to  a  coworker  was  untrue,
because  Applicant’s  mother  described  the  comment  differently.  It  is  not  clear  whether
the  psychologist  knew  that  the  complaint  was  investigated  and  determined  to  be
unfounded, or that he knew that Applicant’s employer offered to give him another job in
the company.
The  psychologist  also  concluded  that  Applicant  falsely  claimed  that  he  was  not
intoxicated on the night of the party, because Applicant admitted to his supervisor that
he  was  intoxicated.  The  psychologist’s  report  lists  a  document  from  Applicant’s
supervisor  as  one  of  the  documents  he  reviewed,  but  at  the  hearing,  Department
Counsel stated, “We weren’t able to  look at that report because  of our rules.” (Tr. 115)
The  security  investigator’s  report  does  not  include  a  statement  from  Applicant’s
employer.  There  is no documentary evidence  in  the  hearing  record  of  any  admissions
by  Applicant  to  his  supervisor  regarding  this  event,  and  no  evidence  from  other
witnesses that Applicant was intoxicated at the party.
Finally,  although  there  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  ever  was  involved  with
cocaine, the psychologist appears to have accepted the granddaughter’s assertions that
Applicant  touched  her inappropriately  and  offered  to  “do  some  coke”  with  her  as  true,
and  he  concluded  that  Applicant  was  not  being  truthful  with  him  when  he  denied  her
accusation.
Applicant  decided  to  stop  drinking  in  2022,  when  his  son  was  born.  His
cohabitant left him shortly after the birth, but they share custody of their son. (Tr. 56) He
testified that he last consumed alcohol on July 2, 2022. (Tr. 67) Applicant’s older brother
corroborated  his testimony about his decision  to  stop drinking and  the effect  it  had on
his behavior. (Tr. 98-100; 103-05)
Applicant is receiving counseling from a therapist once a week, and he receives
prescriptions from  a  nurse practitioner in the  counselor’s office.  (Tr. 72, 83) In a report
dated  August  8,  2022,  the  nurse  practitioner  stated  that  Applicant  had  abstained  from
alcohol  for  ten  weeks.  Applicant  receives  prescription  drugs  for  ADHD,  anxiety,
depressive  disorder,  and  panic  disorder.  (AX  J)  He  testified  that  he  stopped  taking
drugs  for  anxiety  and  panic  attacks  about  a  year  ago.  (Tr.  84)  Although  he  was
evaluated  for  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),  he  and  his  counselor  have
determined that he does not have PTSD. (Tr. 81, AX J
Applicant attends AA meetings once or twice a month, but he has not found the
“right group.” He testified that he has completed all of the 12-Step Program. (Tr. 74) He
sees a therapist regularly, and he realizes the negative effect of alcohol on his life. (Tr.
71-72)
Applicant  has  become  more  active  in  his  community  and  has  started  coaching
baseball. He testified, “I’m trying to be a person that I should have been a long time ago,
and it just took me way too long to get here.” (Tr. 72)
Applicant testified that he started having panic attacks in July 2022. He and his
cohabitant  had  started  seeing  each  other  again,  but  when  he  returned  from  a  30-day
deployment, he learned that she was seeing someone else and he was no longer part
of  her  life,  even  though  they  had  three  children  together. (Tr.  79)  He  admitted  that  he
still  suffers  from  panic  attacks  and  depression,  which  he  attributed  to  abstaining  from
alcohol.  He testified, “It's definitely a little harder when you have to face things  face to
face and not just hide them or drown them.” (Tr. 51)
A  friend  of  Applicant  who  has  known  him  for  ten  years  and  was  at  the  party  in
August  2019  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  good  character.  The  friend  also
stated that he did not observe any inappropriate interaction between Applicant and the
neighbor’s granddaughter. (AX G)
Applicant’s
father,  a  retired  Navy  petty  officer,
that  Applicant
meticulously  complied  with  the  revocation  of  his  driver’s  license.  Applicant’s  father,
mother, sister, and some friends drove him to and from work each day. (Tr. 91-92) His
father is proud of the progress he has made in turning his life around. (Tr. 89)
testified
A  Navy  commander  serving  as  the  combat  systems  officer  on  a  U.S.  Navy
combatant  ship,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  three  years  and  served  with  him  on
multiple  ships,  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  skill  as  a  fleet  systems  engineer
and his personal trustworthiness and integrity. She has observed Applicant’s change in
behavior during the past year. She states, “[Applicant’s] mindset has shifted away from
destructive  thought  and  behaviors  and  has  been  laser  focused  on  good  decisions,
personal growth, and impacting others by sharing wisdom he has gained on his journey
and providing motivation through all circumstances.” (AX I at 1)
A  retired  master  chief  petty  officer  who  has  known  and  served  with  Applicant
since  2020  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  technical  expertise,  dedication,
honesty, and integrity. (AX I at 2) An active-duty lieutenant commander who has known
Applicant since August 2022 describes him as a loving and doting father, who is full of
life,  energy,  and  positivity.  (AX  I  at  4)  An  active-duty  chief  petty  officer  has  watched
Applicant make  significant changes in his lifestyle and become a great father and  role
model  for  his  son  and  an  exceptionally  skilled  fleet  engineer.  (AX  I  at  3)  A  former
shipmate  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2006  believes  that  he  has  overcome  his
“personal  demons”  and  “found  love,  purpose,  and  a  peace  that  .  .  .  that  has  forever
changed  him.” He  states  that  Applicant  is  now “patient,  more  measured  when  speaks,
and  most importantly, he  thinks before [he] acts.” (AX  I at 5) A  neighbor for  two years
who has known Applicant for seven years describes him as “very dependable, selfless,
giving, trustworthy, and a joy to be around.” (AX I at 6)
The parents of Applicant’s former cohabitant are both retired sailors. Her mother
is  a  retired  Navy  limited-duty  lieutenant  with  20  years  of  service,  and  her  father  is  a
retired  senior  chief  petty  officer  with  26  years  of  service.  They  consider  Applicant  a
devoted  father  to  his  own  biological  child  as  well  as  two  of  his  former  cohabitant’s
children, treating them as his own. They have remained in contact with Applicant after
he  and  cohabitant  separated,  and  they  have  the  “utmost  respect”  for  him  and  are
confident that he has turned his life around. (AX I at 7)
",True
"Applicant admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a,  1.c, 2.a,  2.c, and  3.a. She  denied  SOR ¶¶  1.b  and
2.b.  After  a   thorough   and   careful  review   of  the   pleadings,  testimony,   and   exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. She earned some college credits but not a degree. She
married  in  2007  and  divorced  in  2010.  She  remarried  in  2012.  She  has  six  children
ranging from 20 years old to 5 years old. She has worked for a federal contractor since
2006 and has held a security clearance since then. (Tr. 33-37; GE 1)
Applicant testified that her family has a history of mental health issues. Due to the
stigma associated with mental illness in the past, she was raised by her family to deny
the issues if a problem existed because it was embarrassing and brought shame on the
family.  Applicant  testified  that  she  was  in  denial  for  years  about  her  mental  health
problems. (Tr. 38-39)
Applicant  testified  that  for  many  years  she  was  misdiagnosed  with  post-partum
depression.  She  believed  she  never was  properly  treated  for her more  serious mental
health issues because of the misdiagnosis and her state of denial. (Tr. 38-39)
Applicant  testified  that  she  began  consuming  alcohol  in  about  2002.  She  never
consumed alcohol while she was pregnant or breast feeding. In 2004, she was working
as  a  bartender  and  the  management  encouraged  the  bartenders to  let  customers buy
them drinks to increase business. She said she would often get drunk while working at
the bar. After she married in 2006, she moved to a new state with her husband, and she
did not consume alcohol because she was at home and did not socialize. Gradually she
made friends and became more social. She testified that she never felt like she needed
or craved alcohol but when she did drink,  she had no control and could not stop. She
found  her  body  reacted  differently  when  she  consumed  alcohol  than  it  does  for  other
people, in that instead of acting as a depressant, it energized her. (Tr. 45-49)
Applicant  testified  that  after  she  remarried,  she  and  her  husband  both  drank
alcohol, and it would fuel fights between them. In 2016, while talking on the phone with a
friend, she consumed a 750 ml bottle of rum. Her husband was in bed and got up and
confronted her. She was belligerent. She blacked out and does not recall what happened
but was told she was combatant with her husband and her father who had been contacted
and came to their house. (Tr. 39-41)
Applicant  was  taken  to  CC,  a  hospital,  and  was  admitted  to  the  behavioral  unit
where  she  stayed  for  three  days.  She  described  the  facility  as  horrible,  and  she  was
terrified while there. She was placed in a room with a woman who talked to herself and
was told that the woman was aggressive. Applicant testified she met with a psychiatrist
for five minutes. There was concern that because there were scratches on her wrists that
she had made a suicide attempt. The scratches were superficial. This was also fueled by
the  fact  that  her  husband  could  not  find  his  medication,  and  it  was  believed  she  had
consumed it. She denied she attempted to commit suicide. All of her toxicology tests were
negative,  and  her  husband  eventually  found  his  medication,  refuting  that  she  made  a
suicide attempt. (Tr. 39-41, 47; GE 3)
Applicant testified  that  her experience  with  the  medical personnel raised  concerns
about  the   quality  of  the   facility.  She   said   she   met  with   a  nurse  practitioner who   vaped
during  her  entire  interview. She  was  prescribed  Zoloft and  the  nurse  believed  because
Applicant had  a  busy  life  with  five  children  at  the  time  that  she  was  suffering  from  post-
partum   depression. Applicant   testified  that   she   believed   she   did   have   depression  after
her child  was  born,  but  it was  not  to  the  level of post-partum.  She also candidly  admitted
that she  was in denial on  acknowledging  she  had  other serious mental health  issues. She
met   with   a   psychiatrist  and   was  diagnosed   with   adjustment  disorder,  with   depressed
mood,  and  alcohol intoxication  delirium, with  mild  use  disorder. After  her release  from  the
unit,  she  felt good  but continued  to  consume  alcohol. She  did not believe  at that time  that
she  had  a  problem  with  alcohol. She  attributed  her diagnoses to  others who  believed  that
she   had   swallowed   pills,  despite   evidence   to   the   contrary. Applicant  continued   to   take
Zoloft which helped her.  (Tr 47-51)
Applicant became pregnant in 2017 and stopped drinking. She also discontinued
taking the Zoloft upon her obstetrician’s  recommendation. She did not consult with any
other doctors about the consequences of stopping Zoloft. Her son was born in July 2018
and Applicant nursed him until February 2019. She experienced stress due to the baby
having  some  special  medical  needs,  some  financial  issues,  and  she  was  not  on  any
medication. When she stopped breast-feeding, she started to drink alcohol again.  She
also explained after the lockdown due to the pandemic the children were all home, and it
was also more stressful. (Tr. 42-44, 57-60)
Applicant testified  that once  she  starts to  drink alcohol,  she  does not  have  control.
She   becomes  belligerent  and   argumentative.  From   February  2019   to   April  2020,   she
consumed  alcohol sporadically but when  she  did,  it was to  intoxication. Her husband  tried
to  limit her to  three  drinks,  but  she  said  she  threw the  restriction  back at  him because  he
consumed   alcohol  and   said  that  he   had   the   problem   with   alcohol  and   not  her.  She
admitted they were  both  in  denial regarding  their  problems  with  alcohol.  (Tr. 44-46, 60-
61)
In April 2020, Applicant and her family were celebrating her daughter’s  birthday.
Applicant was consuming alcohol. She was upset at her husband for spending money for
something  she  did  not  approve  of.  Later  in  the  evening,  she  and  her  husband  were
arguing. Applicant testified she blacked out and does not remember what happened. She
only knows what was told to her. She called the police and accused her husband of hitting
her  son,  which  was  not  true.  The  police  came,  and  her  husband  went  to  his mother’s
house. Her mother stayed with her and the children. Applicant went to take a shower and
her mother-in-law came over to the house to retrieve Applicant’s husband’s medication.
Because Applicant had been in the bathroom for a long time and was unresponsive, her
son  unlocked  the  door.  Applicant  was  on  the  floor  and  was  blue.  An  ambulance  was
called, and she was taken to the hospital and intubated. It was determined that she had
taken her husband’s entire prescription of Xanax and some hydrocodone that had been
prescribed to her after an operation. (Tr. 51, 61-64)
Applicant testified she woke up in the hospital a few days later unaware of what
had transpired or how long she had been in the hospital. She was then transferred to the
behavior wing at RL, a hospital. She met with a psychiatrist and a therapist for the three
days she was there. She discussed with the psychiatrist her family history and what had
happened. He explained to her that her condition was not temporary and would not go
away. He explained that they needed to fix her brain, and she would be on medication for
the rest of her life. He specifically said she was not suffering from post-partum depression.
Instead, he diagnosed her with Major Depressive Disorder. She was put back on Zoloft,
which has provided good results. She said she was sad and angry because she blamed
her family for teaching her to deny mental health issues and leave them untreated. She
explained that her grandmother had committed suicide and she later learned her aunt has
the same diagnoses as her. (Tr. 64-68, 89-90; GE 4; AE A, B, N)
Applicant recognizes that her use of alcohol exacerbated her other mental health
issues.  She  testified  that  her  current  diagnosis  is  Major  Depressive  Disorder  severe
without psychotic episodes and she is also being treated for Alcohol Use Disorder. The
psychiatrist at RL referred Applicant to her primary care doctor for medicine management
of her Zoloft dosage. Since April 2020, Applicant’s dosage has increased from 50mg to
100mg  and  in  late  2022  it  was  increased  again  to  150mg  when  Applicant  was
experiencing stress due to her security clearance being under review. The increases were
all under the care of her doctor. (Tr. 69-71, 91-92, 95-96; GE 4; AE B, N)
While at RL, Applicant also met with a psychologist and was to meet with her for a
year. She did not have a good rapport with her. She participated in talk therapy and initially
they met twice a week, then once a week, then bi-weekly. Applicant discontinued seeing
the psychologist because she did not find it helpful, and they would often sit together and
not talk. She stopped seeing the psychologist around June or July 2020. She continued
to take her medicine as prescribed. She admitted that she was not happy with the care
she  had  initially  received  at  CC  where  the  psychologist  was  affiliated  because  she
believed they mishandled her care. She tried to meet again with the psychiatrist from RL
who  diagnosed  her,  but  he  had  left  the  hospital’s  employment  and  she  was  unable  to
arrange an appointment. (Tr. 68-69, 71-74, 77, 92-94; GE 3, 4; AE A, B, N)
Before  being  discharged  from  RL,  Applicant  worked  on  a  recovery plan  with  the
psychiatrist and  his nurse.  Her family participated  in the  discussions regarding  support
through  a  virtual meeting  to  ensure everyone  was aware  of it. Almost immediately after
Applicant’s  discharge  from  RL, she  began  participating  in  “In  the  Room.” This is an  online
treatment program  that offers Alcoholics  Anonymous (AA) meetings  and  other activities
that  are always available. She  learned  about this group  while  at  RL.  Her recovery was
happening   during   the   pandemic,   so   the   use   of  online   groups  was   the   norm.  Also,   it
allowed  her flexibility to  seek a  meeting  when  it met her schedule as there are meetings
offered   every  two   hours.  The   AA   program   required   that  she   attend   meetings  for  90
consecutive   days.  AA   offered   meetings,   communicating   with   others,  reflections,   and
sponsors. There is also  a  subdivision  at  “In  the  Room”  that offers a  community for those
with  more than  one  diagnosis. The  group  is called  Dual Diagnoses. Applicant feels very
comfortable  participating  in  this community  because  it  is not just about  being addicted  to
alcohol   but also   addresses  other   mental health   diagnoses.   Applicant   works   on   the   12-
steps of AA  and  has a  sponsor. When  she  first started,  she  participated  more often  in the
group,  but the  frequency has been  reduced  now that her mental health  and  alcohol issues
are  under  control.  She   continues  to   participate   in   the   program.   She   continues  to   be
medication  compliant,  reads the  daily reflections from  the  group  and  posts her gratitudes
weekly. (Tr. 74-83, 94, 98; AE M)
Applicant  testified that she  has a robust support group. Her husband supports  her
sobriety.  After Applicant’s hospitalization, he  was in denial about his alcohol problem,  but
in about  June  2020,  he  recognized  that  he  too  is an  alcoholic. They support each  other.
There is no  alcohol in  the  house. Both  testified  that Applicant has  not consumed  alcohol
since   the   April 2020   incident  and  hospitalization.  Applicant’s  family  and   her   husband’s
family  live   close   by   and   are there   to   support   her. She   has   a   church   community and   is
involved  as a  girl scout  leader  with  her daughters. She  recognizes  triggers that  may raise
concerns  and  addresses them  immediately. Her husband  is  also  vigilant in  monitoring  her
moods and stresses. Although she is vigilant about taking her medication, he is mindful
of ensuring she does also. (Tr. 85-86)
Due to the stress associated with the retention of her security clearance, Applicant
went to see a therapist in August 2022 to help her. She participated in cognitive therapy
with him. He gave her the same diagnoses as noted above. He is a licensed clinical social
worker. She saw him until January 2023. (Tr. 84-85)
Applicant  reported  her  2016  hospitalization  incident  to  her  employer’s  facility
security  officer (FSO) but  was told  because it  was  due to post-partum depression  she
was not required to do so. She reported her April 2020 incident to her FSO. She admitted
that when she completed her security clearance application in March 2020, she did not
disclose alcohol or mental health issues because she was in denial. (Tr. 99-100; GE 2)
Applicant’s coworker for the past 13 years and friend testified on her behalf. She
is aware  of  Applicant’s mental health  hospitalizations and  addiction  to  alcohol. She  did
not  observe  Applicant  drink  alcohol  when  they  were  at  a  company  happy  hour.  She
described  Applicant  as  reliable,  trustworthy,  dependable,  always  willing  to  help,  and  a
vital member of the team. (Tr. 105-109)
Applicant’s  sister-in-law  testified.  She  was  aware  that  in  the  past  Applicant  was
diagnosed  with  post-partum  depression.  Since  April  2020  she  has  never  observed
Applicant consume alcohol. She is available, as is her whole family that lives very close,
to  provide  any  support  Applicant  may  need.  She  has  noticed  a  change  in  Applicant’s
behavior  since  she  has  abstained  from  alcohol  consumption.  Applicant  is  calm  and
organized.  She  describes  Applicant  as  a  loving  mother,  daughter,  and  aunt.  She  has
found new hobbies and is very involved in girl scouts with her daughters, is a homeroom
parent, gardens, and is enrolled in college. (Tr. 109-115)
Applicant’s  husband  testified  and  acknowledged  that  since  both  have  stopped
consuming  alcohol,  their  marriage  and  life  has  improved.  He  described  himself  as  a
recovering alcoholic. He is aware that his wife recognizes her triggers that may impact
her mental health. He believes the last alcohol episode in April 2020, where she almost
died, scared her about what could have happened. She is managing her mental health
through medication. She has constant family support, and they support each other. (Tr.
115-122)
Applicant provided her excellent performance evaluations and performance goals
from her employer. She is committed to her sobriety and mental health. She intends to
remain  vigilant  in  taking  her  prescribed  medication  and  recognizing  triggers  that  may
impact  her  mental  health.  She  admits  she  is  a  recovering  alcoholic.  She  has  not
consumed alcohol since April 2020 and does not intend to ever again. She understands
that she will remain on medication for her mental health for the rest of her life. (AE C, D,

"In  her  May  2022  SOR  Answer  (Answer  #2),  Applicant  denied  all  of  the  SOR
allegations, with explanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old. She is not married and has no children. She has been
steadily  employed  in  her  field  of  expertise  since  shortly  after  obtaining  her  bachelor’s
degree in 2008. She has held a security clearance since about 2010 and has worked for
her  current  employer  since  2015.  She  currently  works  as  a  business  analyst.  (GX  1;
GX 3; Tr. 19, 65)
In about 2014, Applicant began “binge drinking” alcohol due to stress and anxiety
from  an  emotionally  abusive  relationship  with  her  boyfriend.  At  his  urging,  she  sought
out  counseling  and  saw  Ms.  V.S.,  a  licensed  clinical  professional  counselor  (LCPC),
from about April 2014 through February 2015. (GX 3; GX 5)
In February 2015, Applicant changed medical providers and underwent an initial
evaluation  with  Dr.  J.R.,  a  psychiatrist.  She  was  diagnosed  with  generalized  anxiety
disorder,  major  depressive  disorder  and  alcohol  dependence.  A  diagnosis  of  bipolar
disorder was ruled out. Dr. J.R. noted that Applicant was also an addictive shopper and
was  struggling  with  impulse  buying.  Applicant  later  claimed  she  only  treated  with
Dr. J.R. for generalized anxiety disorder and denied receiving treatment for alcohol use.
(See discussion below). Applicant’s mental health-related diagnoses and treatment are
not alleged in the SOR. (GX 2; Tr. 17, 32)
In  early  March  2015, Applicant  was  prescribed  Celexa  and  Lamictal to  stabilize
her mood. Later that month, she was prescribed naltrexone to curb her alcohol cravings.
In  May  2015,  Dr.  J.R.  noted  that  Applicant  had  responded  well  to  medication  as  her
impulsive  behavior  decreased  and  she  was  drinking  less  alcohol.  Amongst  several
recommendations, she was to continue naltrexone for her alcohol dependency. (GX 2)
Dr.  J.R.  saw  Applicant  again  in  September  2015  and  noted  she  was  less
impulsive  and  was  drinking  moderately.  In  December  2015,  Applicant  saw  another
counselor  within  Dr.  J.R.’s  practice  and  talked  about  her  “struggles  with  compulsive
shopping  and  alcohol  abuse.”  The  counselor  recommended  that  she  continue  regular
therapy to focus on depression and anxiety management, improving her self-esteem as
well  as  managing  her alcohol  consumption  and  other  compulsive  behaviors.  Applicant
did not return for treatment. (GX 2)
In her July 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had received counseling and
mental health treatment with Ms. V.S. and Dr. J.R. However, she did not state that any
of  this treatment was alcohol related.  Further, under Section 24  –  Use  of Alcohol,  she
denied that she ever voluntarily sought counseling or treatment due to her alcohol use.
(GX 1)
During  her  interview  with  a  security  clearance  background  investigator  in
February  2018,  Applicant  described  her  earlier  psychological  counseling  but  “failed  to
note  that  this  counseling  was  due  to  [her]  voluntary  alcohol  treatment.”  Applicant
indicated she was “ashamed  to list her treatment for alcohol use.” She then described
her  period  of  “binge  drinking”  from  about  2014  through  2016.  She  claimed  she  had
successfully  completed  counseling  and  volunteered  that  she  continued  to  consume
alcohol. (GX 3)
Applicant  did  not  participate  in  any  mental  health  treatment  from  2016  through
2018. She separated from her boyfriend in 2017. However, in 2019 she wanted to return
to  dating  and  sought  out  additional  mental  health  treatment  to  address  her  anxiety
issues surrounding relationships. (Tr. 58-59)
In  June  2019,  Applicant  underwent  a  psychiatric  evaluation  with  Ms.  K.R.,  a
physician assistant, certified (PA-C). She described being in an abusive relationship in
2014 through 2015 and said she had only gone to therapy because of her ex-boyfriend.
She  stated  she  had  previously  been  diagnosed  with  acute  bipolar  disorder  and  had
been  prescribed  Lexapro  and  naltrexone  but  “rarely  took  them  and  did  not  take  them
seriously.”  She  reported  she  was  typically  drinking  one  alcoholic  beverage  a  day.
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  obsessive  compulsive  disorder,  major  depressive
disorder and an unspecified anxiety disorder. Diagnoses of alcohol abuse disorder and
bipolar disorder were ruled out and she was prescribed Prozac. (AX E)
In  September  2019,  Applicant  returned  to  Ms.  K.R.  with  complaints  of  high
anxiety  related  to  her  work  and  personal  issues.  There  was  no  indication  of  alcohol-
related issues or treatment from these records. Applicant was again prescribed Prozac
and a course of mental health treatment was established. She remained compliant with
her  provider’s  recommendations  and,  over  the  next  two  years,  her  anxiety  and
depression decreased. (AX C-E)
In  January  2020,  Applicant  responded  to  Government  interrogatories  and
confirmed  that  she  had  been  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependency  in  about  2015  and
had been prescribed medication to assist with her alcohol cravings. She also confirmed
she discontinued treatment in 2016 against the advice of her medical provider. (GX 3)
In  August  2021,  following  her  receipt  of  the  initial  SOR,  Applicant  informed
Ms. K.R.  that  her  security  application  had  been  revoked  because  she  had  previously
seen a psychiatrist in 2015 and been diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Applicant reported
that she was currently drinking one to two glasses of wine four to five nights per week
and  would  occasionally  drink  a  max  of  three  drinks  on  the  weekend  during  social
outings.  Ms.  K.R.’s  assessment  and  treatment  of  Applicant  remained  unchanged  and
unrelated to Applicant’s alcohol consumption. (AX C-E)
Also  in  August  2021,  at  the  direction  of  her  attorney,  Applicant  underwent  an
alcohol use evaluation with Ms. K.B., a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW). She took
several  tests  and  participated  in  an  interview  during  this  evaluation.  In  describing  her
treatment history to Ms. K.B., Applicant claimed she never sought services associated
with alcohol while treating with Dr. J.R. and was “adamant” that neither Dr. J.R. nor any
therapist in that office ever told her that she had a drinking problem or needed treatment
for alcohol. Applicant claimed in the evaluation that Dr. J.R.’s prescription for naltrexone
was to curb her desire to shop online and that she only took one or two pills but “did not
like the side effects and ceased taking them.” (AX F)
With  regard  to  her  alcohol  consumption  at  the  time  of  the  evaluation,  Applicant
informed Ms. K.B. that she never had any alcohol-related incidents within or outside of
work. She had reduced her alcohol consumption from two to four glasses of wine, four
to  five  times  per  week  to  one  to  two  glasses  of  wine,  two  to  three  times  per  week.
Ms. K.B.  concluded  that  Applicant  did  not  have  an  alcohol  use  disorder  and  that  no
alcohol treatment was warranted. (AX F)
Shortly after the evaluation,  Applicant submitted her August 2021 SOR Answer.
(Answer # 1) In discussing the SOR allegations, she acknowledged that she had been
diagnosed, in part, with alcohol dependency and alcohol use disorder, but claimed that
these  were  overdiagnoses,  as  she  was  only  seen  a  few  times  by  Dr.  J.R.  and  had
discontinued her treatment. Applicant claimed that she continued to consume alcohol at
a  level  that  her  psychiatrist  and  therapist  believed  did  not  meet  the  criteria  for alcohol
use disorder. (GX 4)
In December 2021, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation with Dr. C.B.,
Ph.D.,  at  the  request of  DOD.  During  that  evaluation,  Applicant  stated  that  she  began
drinking  excessively  in  2015  as  a  poor  mechanism  for  relationship  struggles  and  that
her  drinking  was  no  longer  excessive  after  she  separated  from  her boyfriend  in  2017.
(GX 5-6)
With  regard  to  her  alcohol  consumption  at  the  time  of  the  evaluation,  Applicant
informed  Dr.  C.B.  that  she  consumed  one  or  two  glasses  of  wine,  primarily  on  the
weekends. Dr. C.B.’s diagnostic impression was major depressive disorder, recurrent, in
remission;  generalized  anxiety  disorder;  alcohol  use  disorder,  in  remission;  and  a  rule
out of bipolar disorder. (GX 5-6)
In April 2022, Ms. K.R. issued a letter stating that Applicant continued to treat for
major  depressive  disorder,  anxiety  disorder  and  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  and
remained  compliant  with  her  treatment  plan.  In  May  2022,  Dr.  E.T.,  Ph.D.  within  Ms.
K.R.’s  office,  issued  a  similar  letter,  stating  that  Applicant  was  actively  participating  in
treatment,  had  made  significant  progress  in  managing  her  symptoms  and  exhibited
stable  mental  health.  Dr.  E.T.  opined  that  Applicant’s  symptoms  were  not  related  to  a
substance use disorder. (AX C-D)
In her May 2022 SOR Answer (Answer # 2), Applicant denied she ever received
treatment  for  a  condition  related  to  alcohol.  Instead,  she  claimed  to  have  treated  for
anxiety and depression. She further claimed she was unaware she had been diagnosed
with  alcohol  use  disorder  or  alcohol  dependency  “until  well  after  the  fact”  and  the
medication  she  had  been  prescribed  in  2015  was  to  curb  her  shopping  impulses.
Applicant stated that she consumed alcohol responsibly and would continue to discuss
her drinking habits with her  therapist and modify her consumption if needed. Applicant
also  denied  providing  false  information  during  her  alcohol  use  evaluation  in  August
2021.
In May 2023, Applicant was seen by Ms. J.M.R. (LCSW), a new counselor within
her current medical practice group. Ms. J.M.R. summarized that Applicant suffered from
generalized anxiety disorder  that was being managed by coping skills and medication.
Ms. J.M.R. opined that neither Applicant’s condition nor consumption of alcohol had any
impact on her judgment, stability, reliability or trustworthiness. (AX J)
At  her  DOHA  hearing,  Applicant  described  seeing  Dr.  J.R.  in  2015  for  therapy,
but denied being seen for alcohol-use problems. She further denied ever being treated
for  an  alcohol  use  disorder.  Applicant  again  claimed  that  the  medication  Dr.  J.R.
prescribed was to curb her shopping impulses and was unrelated to her use of alcohol.
She further  claimed  she  did  not  know that Dr.  J.R.  had  diagnosed  her with  an alcohol
use disorder until she received the initial SOR. (Tr. 16-18, 28-33, 54-56)
When  Applicant  was  confronted  with  her  January  2020  interrogatory  response
that  reflected  her  awareness  of  her  alcohol-dependency  diagnosis  and  treatment,  she
claimed not to recall filling  out  the questionnaire.  Applicant also  could  not recall  telling
Dr. C.B. about her history of seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. Instead, she stated “I
believe it is not who I am anymore, so I understand that the records say it, but it is not
really that prevalent in my memory right now.” (Tr. 29-32, 39-40)
Applicant described working with several counselors since first seeking treatment
with  her  current  medical  group  in  2019.  She  said  her  treatment  was  for  generalized
anxiety disorder, the management of underlying family and relationship issues, as well
as her overall wellness and mental health. She said her counselors were aware of her
alcohol  consumption,  but  it  was  not  a  concern  to  them  and  she  did  not  receive  any
treatment specific to alcohol use. (Tr. 23-24, 35-38, 61-64)
Applicant stated she has come a long way since the abusive relationship with her
ex-boyfriend  she  experienced  in  2015.  She  said  she  now  maintains  strong  work  and
personal  relationships  and  stated  that  she  does  not  have  an  alcohol-use  problem.
(Tr. 32, 72-74)
Applicant  submitted  multiple  character  letters  from  individuals,  some  of  whom
have  worked  with  her  since  at  least  2013.  They  all  describe  her  as  an  exemplary
employee who consistently exceeded expectations. They further note that she has held
a security clearance with access to classified materials without incident and maintains a
high  degree  of  professionalism,  integrity,  and  dedication.  A  recent  performance
appraisal stated that Applicant had either met or exceeded all expectations. (AX G-I)

"Applicant  is  41  years  old  and  married  with  two  children.  He  has  a  bachelor’s
degree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor (Company A) since March
2020 as a release engineer and is attempting to obtain a security clearance in relation to
his employment. (Tr. 35-36; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17; Applicant
Exhibit A.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he abuses intoxicants to excess. He denied both allegations in this paragraph
with explanations.
Applicant has worked consistently as a software engineer since graduating from
college in 2006. He worked for Company B, a major IT company, from February 2015 to
March  2020.  Up through  2017 his work was exemplary, and his evaluations  stated he
“meets  all  expectations.”  Beginning  in  2018,  however,  he  began  receiving  marginal
evaluations. He stated that at this point in time he began to use alcohol and marijuana to
cope  with  job  stress.  His  actions  did  not  relieve  the  job  stress.  By  early  2019  he  was
having  serious  emotional problems due to  job  and  home  stress, and  the  impact  of his
increased alcohol and marijuana use. This description of his use is attested to by both
Applicant and his wife. At this point he voluntarily took a 30-day leave of absence from
Company  B  to  attend  an  outpatient  treatment  program  for  a  stress-induced  mood
disorder, as well as alcohol and marijuana use. While worthwhile, he did not feel that he
had  received  sufficient  treatment  to  resolve  his  issues.  Accordingly,  he  received  an
additional 60 days of outpatient treatment. He feels that the treatment was successful.
(Tr. 16-18, 22. 28-30, 37, 61, 73-74; Applicant Exhibit D.)
Soon  after  returning  to  Company  B  after  his  three-month  leave  of  absence
Applicant  received  a  job  offer  from  Company  A.  As  stated,  he  began  working  there  in
early 2020. He testified that he enjoys the work and finds it very fulfilling. His evaluations
at this job have been outstanding, according to his current and former supervisors.  (Tr.
75-88; Applicant Exhibit F at 1-2, 6.)
The programs Applicant attended recommended that he not drink alcohol. He did
not drink alcohol for several months after finishing his program. He eventually began to
drink  again and  continued to drink  some amount of alcohol several times a week until
November 2022. At that point he made the decision to stop drinking altogether and began
attending  a  recovery  program.  He  testified  that  the  program  is  assisting  him  in  his
recovery. (Tr. 18-19, 42-46, 62, 68-70; Applicant Exhibits J and K.)
Applicant continues to experience stress, even in the new job. He began seeing a
psychiatric nurse practitioner (PNP) in January 2022 due to depression and anxiety.  In
May  2022  the  therapist  reported,  “Patient  [Applicant]  states  that  he  stayed  sober  for
several days, but then would binge drink on a bottle of whiskey or pack of beer at a sitting.
Patient continues to report cravings for alcohol.”  (Tr. 63-65; Government Exhibit 4 at 4;
Applicant Exhibit I at 2.)
Applicant Exhibit I has additional treatment notes from September 2022 at page 2.
The PNP stated:
Patient [Applicant] remained on  Pristiq, no longer taking  naltrexone. States
that  it worked  well at  first, then  it  seemed  to  stop  working  for etoh  [alcohol]
cravings. Has had  some  nights  where he  drank more than  he  desired, but
not getting  overly intoxicated.  Feeling  much  better with  mood, denies any
down  days  like   he   used   to   have.   [Reports]   working   full   time,  busy  with
family. Some  anxiety with life stress –  able to tolerate.
Applicant testified  that  he  does not feel he  currently has a  problem  with  alcohol.
He further testified  that  he  never told the  therapist that he  engaged  in  binge drinking. He
admitted  drinking  a  fifth  of whiskey  within  three  days.  He  did  make  an  arrangement  with
his wife  that she  would  tell  him  if she  felt that he  was drinking  too much. She  did tell  him
several times  about excessive drinking  last  year up  to  about  August  2022. (Tr. 23-26,  44-
45, 47-48, 66-68, 70-71.)
Applicant received  an  evaluation  from  a  DoD  psychological  consultant  (Dr. One).
His report is dated  July 6, 2022,  and  is Government Exhibit 3.  (Tr. 46-47.)  That report
stated the following:
DIAGNOSTIC  IMPRESSION:   The   Subject   [Applicant]   was  referred   for
evaluation  to  determine  if he  meets criteria  for any condition  which  would
jeopardize   his   judgment,   reliability,  or  trustworthiness.   Specifically,  his
history  of  marijuana   and   alcohol  use   was  of  concern.  Based   upon   the
increased  frequency and  amount used  prior to  his voluntary admission  to
treatment,  the  Subject likely met criteria  for an  alcohol use  disorder and  a
cannabis use  disorder.  He currently does  not appear to  meet criteria  for the
marijuana  use  disorder  since  his reported  abstinence  during  the  application
process  for  his  current  position   in  early  2020.  However,  according   to   his
current medical records, Subject  continues to  suffer from  alcohol cravings
and  engages in binge  drinking  to  cope  with  work stress despite  his stated
desire  to  be  sober. Personal restraint has not appeared  to  be sufficient to
curb  his  consumption   behaviors  and   he   was  most  recently  prescribed
Naltroxone  to  mitigate  cravings. As such, it appears that the  diagnosis of
alcohol use  disorder is  still  current and  applicable to  the  Subject’s profile.
The   diagnoses  below   attempt  to   capture  the   Subject’s  present  level  of
functioning.
DIAGNOSIS:
Alcohol use disorder, moderate
Unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress
Cannabis use disorder, moderate, in sustained remission
(F10.20)
(F32.9)
(F12.20)
PROGNOSIS: The Subject’s prior history of alcohol and marijuana use and
subsequent  treatment  raised  concerns  over  the  Subject’s  ability  to  have
good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Having an active diagnosis
of either would bring inherent risk to those factors. The evaluation did not
reveal that the Subject is suffering from any ongoing marijuana use. If his
reporting of abstinence is accurate, then it is not likely a risk factor and can
be dismissed as a matter of consideration. However, the information from
his  current  prescriber  indicated  that  he  still  struggles  with  binge  drinking,
cravings, and has difficulty staying sober. His consumption appears to be
for similar reasons now as it was when he submitted himself for voluntary
treatment  (ie.  [sic]  work  reviews).  This  information  indicates  that  the
Subject’s  alcohol  use  disorder  is  current,  without  a  sustained  period  of
abstinence,  and  therefore  represents  an  inherent  risk  to  his  judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness.
Applicant was  also  evaluated  by a  psychologist  (Dr. Two), who  was  retained  by
Applicant.  (Tr. 48-49.)  He  submitted  a  report dated  December 5, 2022. (Applicant Exhibit
E.)  That  report stated:
Conclusion:
[Applicant] has enjoyed mild to moderate drinking of beer and whiskey for
much of his adult life. It became a problem for him three years ago, when
his drinking increased, and combined with cannabis use, sleep deprivation
(due  to  his  youngest  child  having  sleep  problems  and  requiring  care  at
night)  and  stress  at  work,  he  developed  a  mood  disorder  for  which  he
sought  and  received  successful  treatment.  It  is  unlikely  that  this  mood
disorder (Substance Induced Mood Disorder) will reoccur. He sleeps well,
his  child  is  doing  well,  he  no  longer  smokes  marijuana,  and  his  work
situation has dramatically improved.
Treatment  three  years  ago  was  successful.  He  has  learned  to  maintain
regular mild to moderate use of alcohol. He currently drinks mildly, between
one and three times a week, on or two drinks on each occasion. To have a
diagnosed  alcohol  condition,  a  person  must  meet  at  last  two  of  eleven
criteria  over the  last twelve  months.  The  only sign  that  [Applicant] shows
are occasional cravings, his drinking has never affected any important life
functions,  and  he  has  never  developed  tolerance  or  suffered  withdrawal
symptoms.  Mild  to  moderate  alcohol  consumption,  without  any  other
challenges, is not an alcohol problem and does not cause other difficulties.
Dr. Two submitted an Addendum dated January 20, 2023. (Applicant Exhibit G.)
It states:
I would like to clarify that I reviewed that entire record, including notes from
[PNP]  [Applicant  Exhibit  I).  In  February 2022,  she  noted  that  alcohol use
was  not  affecting  any  significant  life  function.  In  May  2022,  she  noted
increased alcohol use, that again did not affect work or any other important
life functions. This does not qualify as a disorder. At this time, she also used
the term binge drink, which is incorrect, as [Applicant] emphatically states
that this was incorrect, that he would not drink an entire bottle in one sitting,
but over the course of several days. In September 2022, she also reported
some  alcohol  use,  again  not  affecting  work,  relationships  or  any  other
important  life  skill.  Throughout  her  record,  she  reports  that  medication
helped him maintain his mood. I stand by my impression that he has never
qualified  as  having  an  alcohol  disorder  based  on  the  DSM  5  definition.
Though he drinks sometimes to excess, this is at home, not at work, does
not  affect  his  relationships,  work  or  any  other  life  function,  he  is  not
dependent, has never developed withdrawal symptoms, has never missed
work due to alcohol use, does not currently experience cravings.
Paragraph 2 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions)
The DoD CAF alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is not eligible
for access because he has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair
his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. He denied SOR 2.a. He admitted in part and
denied in part SOR 2.b. He denied SOR 2.c.
SOR paragraph 2.a. references Applicant’s receiving mental health treatment as
part of the factual statement.  Paragraph 27 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which
sets forth the concern under this guideline, states in pertinent part, “No negative inference
concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental
health  counseling.”  In  addition,  the  Defense  Counterintelligence  and  Security  Agency
factsheet, “Mental Health and Security Clearances,” states in part, “Seeking mental health
services does not affect one’s ability to gain or hold security eligibility. Adjudicators regard
seeking necessary mental health treatment as a positive step in the security clearance
process.” (Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Mental Health and Security
Clearances, https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/91/Documents/  pv/DODCAF/resources/DCSA-
FactSheet  Mental-Health  SecurityClearances-Oct21.pdf
(accessed  September  5,
2023.)
2.a.  There  is  little  to  no  support  for  the  allegation  that  Applicant  has  been
diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The only evidence is an affirmative statement by him in
answer to Section 21 “Psychological and Emotional Health” on Government Exhibit 1 that
asked whether he had “EVER been diagnosed by a physician . . . with . . . bipolar mood
disorder.” He stated that he answered the question this way because of a statement made
to him by one of his therapists during his first 30-day outpatient treatment that some of
his conduct could indicate a bipolar disorder. However, there is no diagnosis of bipolar
disorder found anywhere in the available medical records. He testified that both Dr. One
and  Dr.  Two  stated  they  did  not  believe  Applicant  suffered  from  a  bipolar  disorder.
(Government Exhibit 1; Tr. 20, 49-52.)
2.b. Applicant admitted, and the available medical records confirm, that he suffers
from depression and anxiety. He is receiving therapy for it, and is also on medication. He
further stated that therapy and medication are helping control his depression and anxiety.
He  is  also  attempting to  obtain  additional  individual  therapy  with  a  psychologist.  He  is
currently on a waitlist for this provider. (Tr. 52-56; Government Exhibits 3 and 4; Applicant
Exhibits I and L.)
2.c. The Government alleged that Doctor One’s diagnosis of Applicant as currently
suffering from Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate, is cognizable under this guideline as well.
Applicant denied this allegation.
Mitigation
Applicant has been a successful employee at Company A. His current supervisor
testified  and  supplied  a  letter  on  his  behalf.  He  has  known  Applicant  since  2015  at
Company A and Company B, and has been his supervisor at both companies for more
than three years. He described Applicant as a “great” employee. He further testified that
he has not seen any evidence of alcohol or mental health issues with Applicant. He further
stated that he has entrusted Applicant with large projects and stated he trusts Applicant
not to reveal classified or proprietary data. (Tr. 77-88; Applicant Exhibit F at 6.)
Another supervisor of Applicant’s at both Company A and Company B submitted
a  very  laudatory  letter  on  his  behalf.  He  described  Applicant  as  having  “the  highest
integrity.” (Applicant Exhibit F at 1-2.)
Peer  feedback  from  fellow  employees  of  Company  A  in  2022  was  extremely
favorable. (Tr. 56-59; Applicant Exhibit B.)
",False
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted part of SOR ¶ 1.a; and he admitted SOR
¶¶ 2.b through 2.j and 3.a through 3.d. (HE 3) He denied part of SOR ¶ 1.a; and he denied
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 2.k. He did not admit or deny SOR ¶ 2.a. He also provided mitigating
information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.

(Tr. 8) There is no evidence of criminal offenses, drug abuse, or security violations.
Alcohol Consumption and Psychological Conditions
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  on  February  1,  2022,  a  psychologist,  Dr.  G,  interviewed
Applicant, reviewed his medical records, and diagnosed him with Alcohol Use Disorder,
Anxiety Disorder, unspecified, and Depressive Disorder, unspecified. He said Applicant
was defensive about his alcohol consumption, and he concluded Applicant exhibits issues
with  reliability  and  trustworthiness  which  may  impair  his  ability  to  protect  classified
information. Dr. G’s evaluation  referenced a March 2017 treatment note, which states,
“His history of drinking included one pint of vodka daily or more for nine years. He had a
history of blackouts. His longest period of sobriety was seven days in 2016 due to pain in
the  abdomen.”  (GE  2  at  4)  Dr.  G  concluded  that  his  mental-health  conditions  pose  a
significant risk to his judgment and stability in the future unless he obtains treatment and
maintains sobriety.
Applicant’s first panic attack occurred  around  2000  when  he  was about 22  years
old.   (Tr.  25)  He  has  received   medication   for  anxiety  since   2006.  (Tr.  26)  He  said  he
consistently takes his anxiety medication, and  it has helped  him  “tremendously.” (Tr. 26)
He disagreed with Dr. G’s diagnosis of Depressive Disorder. (Tr. 26) He described himself
as a “very happy go lucky person.” (Tr. 27)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  on  or  about  February  22,  2017,  Applicant  was  admitted  for
inpatient treatment after consuming about 200 tablets of the prescription drug Xanax and
one pint of vodka in an attempted suicide. In his SOR response, he denied SOR ¶ 1.b,
and he said he did not intend to commit suicide or take 200 Xanax tablets.
Applicant said  in February 2017, he  consumed  about a  pint of vodka, and  he  was
intoxicated.  (Tr. 30, 33)  He took  about  10,  .25  milligram  doses  of Xanax. (Tr. 30) Applicant
said he  did not remember why he  consumed  the  Xanax; however, he  was not attempting
suicide.  (Tr.  30)  He  said  an   emergency  room   (ER)   note   indicating   he   took  about  200
Xanax  tablets  is an exaggeration. (Tr. 31)  He  did not have  a  prescription for such  a large
amount of Xanax. (Tr. 31) He did not remember what he  said  in the  emergency room. (Tr.
31)  He  denied   that  he   would  have   knowingly  exaggerated   the   amount  of  Xanax  he
consumed, and  he  suggested  his former spouse  may have  told  someone  in  the  ER that
he  took 200  Xanax. (Tr. 32) He  denied  that he  ever experienced  suicidal ideations  or that
he   attempted   suicide.   (Tr.  32)  In   2017,  he   was  drinking   a   pint   of   vodka   about   twice   a
week.  (Tr.   33)   In   2017,   he   went   to   “rehab”  for   about  10   days,  and   to   Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) meetings for about a month.  (Tr. 40, 51, 52; GE  5 at 5)
SOR  ¶  2.a  cross  alleges  the  information  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  as  an  alcohol
consumption security concern. SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c allege, and Applicant admits that on
January 26, 2011, and on January 4, 2012, Dr. L diagnosed him with Alcohol Abuse, not
otherwise specified (NOS). (Tr. 35-36) When he first sought help, he was drinking four or
five days a week and about “a few glasses of wine [and] a half a pint of vodka.” (Tr. 36)
Applicant  said  on  January  4,  2012,  Dr.  L  advised  him  to  decrease  his  alcohol
consumption. (Tr. 37) She said he was supposed to “slow down at the very least” on his
alcohol consumption.  (Tr.  37)  Dr.  L  did  not  tell  him  to  abstain  completely from  alcohol
consumption. SOR ¶ 2.d alleges and Applicant admits that on August 28, 2012, he told
Dr.  L  that  he  continued  to  consume  alcohol,  and  Dr.  L  recommended  he  receive
substance abuse counseling. In August 2012, he was consuming a pint of alcohol four
times a week. (Tr. 38; GE 3 at 116) At his hearing, he said he did not remember that Dr.
L recommended that he obtain substance abuse counseling. (Tr. 37, 40) He was sober
for a while, and then he resumed his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 38) Sometimes he hid his
alcohol  consumption  from  his  spouse.  (Tr.  39-40;  GE  3  at  116)  He  did  not  remember
specific  information  about  his  level  of  alcohol  consumption  or  his  behavior  with  his
spouse. (Tr. 40) Dr. L. prescribed Campral for him; however, he did not continue taking it
because he was worried it would make him sick if he drank alcohol. (Tr. 41)
SOR ¶ 2.e alleges and Applicant admits that he received inpatient treatment from
October 14 to October 16, 2013, for renal colic and alcohol abuse. (SOR response) Upon
discharge  he  was  advised  to  cease  consuming  alcohol  due  to  potential  adverse
interactions with prescribed anxiety medication. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 2.f alleges and Applicant admits that on April 17, 2015, he told Dr. K that
he  had  alcoholism  for  10  years  and  experienced  marital  discord  due  to  alcohol
consumption.  (SOR  response)  Dr.  K  diagnosed  him  with  Alcohol  Abuse,  NOS,  and
encouraged him to join a substance abuse support group and advised to abstain from
further  alcohol  consumption.  (Id.)  At  his  hearing,  Applicant  said  he  did  not  remember
hiding his alcohol consumption from his spouse. (Tr. 42) He did not remember meeting
with Dr. K; however, he accepted that the meeting and diagnosis occurred because it is
in his medical record. (Tr. 42-43)
SOR ¶ 2.g alleges and Applicant admits that on March 31, 2016, he told Dr. F he
increased  his  alcohol  consumption.  (SOR  response)  He  drank  almost  every  day,  and
sometimes to intoxication. (Tr. 44) Dr. F diagnosed him with Alcohol Abuse, encouraged
him to join a substance abuse support group, and advised him to abstain from alcohol
consumption. (Tr. 44) He briefly stopped his alcohol consumption, and then, he resumed
his  alcohol  consumption.  (Tr.  44)  SOR  ¶  2.h  alleges  and  Applicant  admits  that  on
September  12,  2016,  Dr.  F  advised  him  to  abstain  from  alcohol  consumption.  (SOR
response) SOR ¶ 2.i alleges and Applicant admits that on September 19, 2017, he told
Dr. F he resumed his alcohol consumption after being hospitalized from October 14 to
October 16, 2013. (Id.) Dr. F diagnosed him with Alcohol Abuse, encouraged him to join
a substance abuse support group, and advised him to abstain from alcohol consumption.
(Tr. 45; SOR response)
SOR ¶ 2.j alleges and Applicant admits that on February 28, 2020, Dr. S diagnosed
him with Alcohol Abuse, Acute alcoholic gastritis without hemorrhage, and Hepatomegalia
(enlarged  liver),  likely  resulting  from  his  alcohol  consumption.  (Tr.  46;  SOR  response)
However,  at  his  hearing  Applicant  said  he  did  not  remember  the  Hepatomegalia
diagnosis, and recent tests showed his liver was normal. (Tr. 46) Dr. S encouraged him
to reduce his alcohol consumption and to join a substance abuse support group. He was
prescribed benzodiazepines to reduce withdrawal symptoms, until complete cessation.
At his hearing, he said he remembered being prescribed benzodiazepines; however, he
did not remember being advised to stop drinking alcohol. (Tr. 46)
In his SOR response, Applicant denied SOR ¶ 2.k, which alleges that he continued
to consume alcohol contrary to treatment recommendations described in SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.e,
2.f, 2.g, 2.h, 2.i, and 2.j, supra.  For SOR ¶ 2.c, Applicant said Dr. L recommended that
he reduce his alcohol consumption and not that he cease all alcohol consumption.  For
SOR ¶ 2.j he did not remember being advised to stop drinking alcohol.
From 1999 to about 2006, Applicant drank alcohol to help him cope with anxiety.
(Tr.  34)  He  received  medication  which  helped  with  his  anxiety.  (Tr.  34)  His  alcohol
consumption  gradually  increased,  and  it  peaked  around  2015  or  2016.  (Tr.  35)  He
stopped  drinking  alcohol  around  May  of  2021,  except  for  occasional  sips  from  other
people’s  drinks.  (Tr.  47,  49)  He  completely  stopped  drinking  alcohol  in  about  2021  or
2022.  (Tr.  49)  He  has  a  history  of  consumption  of  alcohol  contrary  to
the
recommendations  of  health  practitioners.  (Tr.  50)  He  does  not  attend  any  alcohol
counseling such as AA meetings. (Tr. 51) He relies on the support of family and friends.
(Tr. 51) He does not receive any mental-health counseling or treatment beyond renewal
of his prescriptions. (Tr. 54)
Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.d  allege  and  Applicant  admits  that  he  failed  to  disclose
information on his December 14, 2016 SCA about his mental-health and suggestions that
he receive alcohol counseling. The SCA asked him in the previous seven years: whether
he had consulted with a health-care professional regarding an emotional or mental-health
condition; and whether alcohol had a negative impact on his professional and personal
relationships. His SCA also asked whether he had: ever been ordered, advised, or asked
to seek counseling or treatment because of his use of alcohol; and ever sought counseling
and  treatment  because  of  his  use  of  alcohol.  Applicant  answered,  no,  to  these  four
questions.
Applicant understood  the  questions  on  his SCA.  (Tr. 59) He  did  not disclose  his
history of mental health  and  alcohol treatment on  his SCA because  he  did  not think  it was
an  issue  for him  or in  the  alternative, he  said  he  did  not remember why he  did not  disclose
the  requested  information. (Tr. 55) His alcohol consumption  did  not  affect his work and
did  not   involve   law   enforcement.  (Tr.  55)   He  admitted   his  alcohol   consumption   had   a
negative  impact  on  his  marriage.  (Tr. 56) He did not  remember  the wording  in  the  SCA’s
question  about being  advised  to  seek alcohol treatment, and  he  may  have  considered  the
question  to  be  asking  whether he  was ordered  to  seek alcohol treatment  as opposed  to
a  suggestion.  (Tr. 56) He answered,  no, to  the  question  about  mental-health  treatment
because  he  believed  his mental health  “was under control.” (Tr. 57)  He was unsure about
his state  of mind  at  the  time  he  answered  the  questions  on  his SCA. (Tr. 58) His best
recollection was that he answered  no because he “just didn’t think it was a  big deal.” (Tr.

",False
"The  SOR  alleged  security  concerns  about  Applicant’s  alcohol  use  and  alcohol-
related criminal activity that occurred between 1991 and 2017. In his Answer, Applicant
admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  but  he  denied  that  they  establish  a  basis  to  deny  him
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  Based  on  Applicant’s  admissions,  his
testimony, and the evidentiary record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant,   age   57,  is  unmarried   without  children.  He  has  been   in  a   relationship
analogous to  marriage  with  his girlfriend  for the  greater part of 20  years. He received  a
Bachelor of Science  degree  in  electrical engineering  in  1987. He  has been  employed  by
the same  defense contractor since 1987. He  worked in an electrical engineering position
for several years before transitioning  into  his  current systems engineer position. He  has
maintained  a  security clearance  since  about 1987.  (AE  B; GE  1; GE  2  at 7-8; Tr. at 9, 21-
22, 61-63)
1991 charge
In about August 1991, while alone at a nightclub, Applicant consumed beer in an
amount  he  could  not  recall.  He  denied  that  he  drank  to  the  point  of  intoxication  or
impairment. While driving home from the nightclub, a police officer stopped his vehicle for
a traffic infraction in a construction zone. He was arrested after failing a field sobriety test.
A preliminary breath test registered his blood alcohol content (BAC) as “something  like
0.05” percent. He refused to submit to a breathalyzer test. (GE 1; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 5 at
14; Tr. at 23-28, 74-78)
In November 1991, Applicant pled guilty and was convicted of operating a vehicle
while impaired. He was sentenced to 15 days in jail (all suspended), one year supervised
probation,  and  fined  $150.  He  was  also  ordered  to  complete  an  alcohol  education
program and to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (GE 1; GE 5 at 14; Tr. at
27-28, 54)
Applicant  found  that  the  alcohol  program  (consisting  of  “some  meetings”  and
education  on  the  “dangers  of  alcohol  and  stuff  like  that”)  and  the  AA  meetings  were
“useful.” He refused to submit to a breathalyzer test due to concerns that it could “possibly
hurt” him. He attributed the traffic infraction to his confusion about the cones and signage
in  the  construction  zone,  and  not  to  his  alcohol  use.  He  recalled,  “I  definitely  didn't
consider myself drunk or anything like that.” (Tr. at 25, 27, 75-77)
2005 charge
In about September 2005, while alone at home watching a football game, Applicant
consumed  beer in an amount  he  could not  recall.  He  estimated  that  he  drank  “a  few.”
After  the  game  ended,  about  midnight,  he  drove  to  buy  more  beer  so  that  he  could
continue drinking to celebrate his team’s “come-from-behind” win. An officer stopped his
vehicle after observing it swerve on the road. He was arrested after failing a field sobriety
test. He did not recall his BAC. (GE 1; GE 2 at 6; GE 5 at 15-16; Tr. at 28-34, 78-81)
In  February  2006,  Applicant  pled  guilty  and  was  convicted  of  driving  while
intoxicated.  He  was  sentenced  to  180  days  in  jail  (175  days  suspended),  one  year
supervised  probation,  and  fined  $1,100.  He  was  also  ordered  to  attend  an  alcohol
treatment program and a victim impact panel. (GE 1; GE 5 at 15-16; Tr. at 31-32, 81-82)
Applicant spent two weekends in jail. He attended the alcohol program for “several
weeks,” during  which  he  learned  about  the  “dangers of  alcohol both  to  your health, as
well as being . . . very dangerous when driving after drinking.”  The family members of
drunk-driving  accident  victims  comprised  the  panel  he  attended.  He  acknowledged,  “I
should have realized I was not okay to drive,” and stated, “I guess I was just too excited.
I mean, I wasn’t okay to drive.” (Tr. at 32, 34, 80)
2013 charge
In November 2013, while alone on a day-hike, Applicant consumed beer that he
carried in his backpack, in an amount he could not recall. He estimated that he drank “at
least three” during an eight-hour period. While driving home from the hike after sunset,
he crashed into a curb on the side of the road. A police officer arrived on the scene and
arrested him after he failed both a field sobriety test and a breathalyzer test. (GE 1; GE 2
at 6; Tr. at 34-39, 82-83)
In  February  2014,  Applicant  pled  guilty  and  was  convicted  of  driving  while
intoxicated with a BAC over 0.20 percent. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail (160 days
suspended), fined $500, and his driver’s license was suspended for 12 months. He was
also ordered to complete an alcohol safety action program (ASAP). (GE 1; GE 3 at 2; GE
5 at 12; Tr. at 36-38, 82-83)
Applicant  remembered  being  “surprised”  by  his  BAC.  He  stated,  “I  didn’t
understand  how  it  could  be  that  high.”  He  could  not  recall  his  specific  BAC,  but  he
estimated it “wasn’t way over” 0.20 percent. (Tr. at 38, 83)
Applicant spent 10 days in jail. He successfully completed ASAP, which consisted
of 26 weeks of “level 0.5 DUI education” and “group psychotherapy,” in June 2014. During
intake, he agreed to abstain from alcohol while in ASAP. The record did not address any
aftercare recommendations he may have received upon discharge. Although he could not
recall for sure,  he  conceded  that he  was “most likely”  advised to abstain from drinking
after discharge. (GE 2 at 9-10; Tr. at 51-54, 97)
2016 charge
In October 2016, Applicant was involved with law enforcement while out of state
on a hiking trip with his girlfriend. One evening, after a day of hiking, they “had a real big
argument” that carried over into the next morning, while in their hotel room. Because the
argument was “real loud,” a housekeeper or fellow guest called the police. The argument
ended  by  the  time  the  police  officer  arrived.  After  questioning  both  parties,  the  police
officer arrested Applicant. (AE B; GE 1; GE 2 at 6; Tr. at 39-46; Tr. at 84-86)
In August 2017, Applicant pled guilty to three misdemeanors: domestic violence
(DV) assault, intoxication, and DV unlawful detention. After holding his plea in abeyance
for an unspecified period, the court dismissed the charges. The terms of the abeyance
required him to undergo a DV assessment, complete any recommended DV treatment,
and pay a $780 fine. His assessment did not recommend any DV treatment. He was not
ordered to seek alcohol counseling. (GE 1; GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3-4; Tr. at 42-44)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  consumed  alcohol  (“a  few  beers  or  so”)  during  the
period leading up to his arrest. He recalled that he “probably drank”  in the park during
their hike; drank “a bit” that night because he was upset; and “did get a beer” the following
morning “just to start feeling better,” because he “wasn’t feeling very well.” However, he
denied  that  he  was  intoxicated  or  unlawfully  detained  his  girlfriend.  He  acknowledged
that,  while  arguing  that  morning,  he  may  have  grabbed  his  girlfriend’s  arms  to  defend
himself.  However,  he  denied  hitting  or  otherwise  assaulting  his  girlfriend  at  any  point,
either during the argument, or ever. He has remained in a long-term relationship with this
same girlfriend. In a post-hearing letter, his girlfriend corroborated that he has never been
violent towards her and referred the incident as “an unfortunate situation” that “incorrectly
assigned”  fault  to  him.  Applicant  and  his  girlfriend  asserted  that  he  was  wrongfully
arrested and attributed his arrest to the  state’s strict DV laws, and  to  the  police  officer
deeming Applicant a danger and threat due to his intoxicated appearance. (AE B; GE 2
at 6; Tr. at 40-44, 57, 84-86)
2017 charge
In  April  2017,  while  at  home  alone,  Applicant  consumed  beer  in  an  amount  he
could not recall. He estimated that he drank “somewhere around three” in the immediate
hour or two before he left home. While driving to his girlfriend’s home, his vehicle stopped
operating due to a mechanical failure. He believes someone may have called the police
due to his inebriated state. A police officer arrived on the scene and arrested him because
he  smelled  of  alcohol  and  failed  a  field  sobriety  test.  He  refused  to  submit  to  a
breathalyzer test. (GE 2 at 5-6, 7; GE 5 at 1-11; Tr. at 46-50, 87-89)
In August 2017, Applicant pled guilty and was convicted of driving while impaired
by alcohol. He was sentenced to 60 days in jail (all suspended), one year probation, and
fined $600. He  was  also  ordered to  attend  an  alcohol education  program  and a  victim
impact panel. Due to his refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test and to install an ignition
interlock device (IDD) on his vehicle, his driver’s license was suspended for nine months.
(GE 2 at 5-6, 7; GE 5 at 6-7; Tr. at 49-50)
Applicant completed the alcohol program on an expedited basis before sentencing
as a good-faith gesture, upon the advice of counsel. Between June and August 2017, he
completed 26 hours of comprehensive alcohol education and awareness programming.
Upon  intake,  he  was  characterized  as  a  “problem  drinker”  based  on  test  scores  that
“clearly  indicated  there  is  a  serious  alcohol  problem.”  During  intake,  he  was  strongly
advised  to  abstain  from  using  alcohol.  The  record  did  not  address  any  aftercare
recommendations he may have received upon discharge. Although he could not recall for
sure,  he  conceded  that  he  was  “most  likely”  advised  to  abstain  from  drinking  after
discharge. (GE 2 at 5-6, 11-18; Tr. at 54-56, 88, 97)
The alcohol program’s director opined that Applicant “benefited from programming
and organized and increased his understanding of the need to avoid alcohol and other
drugs, further studied their negative effects on driving, one’s self, one’s family and one’s
society.”  The  director  also  remarked  that  Applicant  took  the  program  “seriously”  and
“worked hard,” as evidenced by his “voluminous handwritten notes.” (GE 2 at 16-17)
Applicant maintained that he refused the IDD because he was not driving a vehicle
at  the  time.  He  travelled  to  work  via  public  transportation  because  his  vehicle  was
unrepairable after the mechanical failure. He recalled that he “felt good and everything”
and “didn’t feel impaired” when he left home to drive to his girlfriend’s home. However, he
acknowledged that he should not have driven after drinking. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. at 87-88)
Applicant has only undergone alcohol treatment when court ordered. Although he
never voluntarily sought out alcohol treatment, he recognized that it was important for him
“to reduce or quit [his] drinking.” He could not recall any voluntary cessation from alcohol
use,  between  1991  and  2017,  except  as  mandated  by  the  courts  during  his  probation
periods. However, he stated, “[t]here may have been.” He does not attend AA meetings
because  he  finds it “very uncomfortable” to speak in front of groups. Instead,  he  reads
books on how to overcome “drinking problems,” from which he has learned the dangers
of alcohol and its negative health effects. (Tr. at 54-58, 59, 73-74, 88-90, 95, 99-102)
Alcohol Use
Applicant  first described his history of alcohol use during his June 2018 subject
interview. He first consumed alcohol at the age of 17, while in college. During college, he
consumed about three to five beers at a time, in social settings, during weekends and on
special occasions. As he grew older and his tolerance for alcohol increased, the amount
he consumed increased, but he only drank on the weekends. He would sometimes drink
to  intoxication,  which  he  defined  as  six  beers.  He  described  his  behavior  under  the
influence of alcohol as uninhibited. He admitted that he had a problem with alcohol. He
acknowledged that his alcohol use negatively impacted his relationship with his girlfriend,
due  to  increased  arguing.  He  denied  that  his  alcohol  use  impacted  his  work,  but  he
expressed concerns about his ability to maintain his security clearance. He attributed his
criminal activity to his alcohol use, and he maintained that there was no possibility of a
recurrence because he stopped drinking in October 2017. He credited his court-ordered
alcohol classes with helping him to abstain. (GE 2 at 7)
At the hearing, Applicant attributed his cessation from drinking in October 2017 to
the negative impacts it had on his life, which he defined as the drunk-driving charges and
related loss of driving privileges. He could not recall the amount he was drinking prior to
October  2017,  but  he  acknowledged  that  it  was  “definitely  too  much.”  Applicant  was
unsure  for  how  long  he  maintained  his  sobriety  after  October  2017,  but  he  estimated
“several months.” At some point, he resumed  consuming alcohol on  the  weekends. He
could not recall what prompted him to resume consuming alcohol, but he stated, “I think
maybe I was at an event with alcohol and I probably . . . started slow . . .”  He thought it
was okay to drink again because he  was doing  well and  believed  that drinking  “a little”
would  not  cause  him  harm  or  any  issues.  He  never  drove  after  consuming  alcohol
following his 2017 charge. (Tr. at 54-59, 60, 90-95, 98, 101-102)
Applicant could not recall the amount that he “normally” drank when he consumed
alcohol, he estimated that it was “a few beers” at a time. On occasion, he consumed other
types of alcohol.  He  clarified  that,  when he described himself as  intoxicated,  which he
redefined as three beers, he did not mean “super drunk or anything like that,” just “high
enough blood levels to be intoxicated.” (Tr. at 28-29, 73-75, 78, 101)
Applicant stopped consuming alcohol as of January 2022, which was also the last
time he drank to the point of intoxication. He denied that his abstinence since January
2022  was  prompted by  concerns about  his security  clearance.  He  stated,  “I had  to  be
ready to do that. And, it wasn’t until January [2022] that I was ready.” He  attributed his
abstinence since January 2022 primarily to his past “negative experiences” and “all the
problems it’s caused” him, concerns about his health, and to his girlfriend not wanting him
to drink. (AE B; Tr. at 54-60, 90-95, 98, 101-102)
On the occasions when Applicant had been in environments where people were
consuming alcohol since January 2022, he was “okay just drinking soft drinks.” Although
he  did  not  “normally”  think  about  or  crave  alcohol,  those  environments  “sometimes”
caused him to do so. His girlfriend’s alcohol consumption “doesn’t really bother” him. He
does not “normally” have alcohol in his home, where his girlfriend resides with him part
time, except “maybe a special event for her.” Recognizing that stress was a contributing
factor  to  his  drinking,  he  has  learned  alternative  ways  to  manage  his  stress  without
consuming alcohol, including hiking and photography. (Tr. at 63, 103-104)
To  Applicant’s  knowledge,  he  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  an  alcohol  use
disorder. However, he described himself as an alcoholic, which he defined as “[b]asically
not having control over your whole life. I mean, there is . . .  alcohol is just causing . . .
issues in your life that you can't control.” He defined those issues as “all those arrests and
stuff.”  He  acknowledged, “once  you're  an  alcoholic,  you're  always  an  alcoholic.”  In
professing how his commitment to sobriety is different now than in 2017, he stated,
Well, my intention is not to start again because that's where . . . it gets . . .
once you start, then . . . you can't really control it. So the important thing is
not to restart. So I intend not to restart again.” (Tr. at 59, 95, 97, 99-100)
Whole Person
Applicant  expressed  pride  in  maintaining  a  high  level  of  work  performance
throughout his 35-year career. He asserted, “I never had any issue at work or anything
on  account  of  my  alcohol  use.”  His  employer  issued  a  special  recognition  to
commemorate his 35-year anniversary milestone. In congratulating him and lauding his
work ethic, his supervisor described him as a “dedicated, detail oriented employee with a
strong technical background.” (AE A; Tr. at 60)
Applicant acknowledged that he never reported any of his arrests to his  security
officer, knowing that he was required to do so. He was concerned that he would lose his
job if he reported them. He also never disclosed his arrests to his supervisor or anyone
else at work. His security officer only knew of the arrests in connection with his review of
Applicant’s SCA before it was submitted. His security officer filed an incident report about
his 2017 charge, based upon Applicant’s SCA disclosure, not because Applicant reported
it to him directly. (Tr. at 68-70)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant’s  long-time  girlfriend  submitted  a  letter  praising
Applicant’s character and work ethic. She opined that he is a “100% changed man.” She
corroborated that, as of May 2023, he had been “totally free from alcohol and drama for
more than a year.” She believed that he consumed alcohol “to relax and relieve the stress”
associated her medical diagnosis and several deaths in their families, including his father
in 2006; his mother, her father, and her nephew in 2020; and his nephew in 2021. (AE B)
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR. His admissions are incorporated
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony,
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He attended college at various times from 1990 to 2005
but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  married  in  2014  and  has  a  stepchild.  He  has  two  adult
children from previous relationships. He has worked for his present employer, a federal
contractor, since 2018. (Tr. 16-20)
Applicant was arrested in April 1992 and charged with robbery and conspiracy to
commit robbery, both felonies. He testified he was in college and he and a group of friends
decided to order a pizza and then steal the pizza from the delivery person and not pay.
He was with the group when two people stole the pizza and beverages and they all ran
away. Applicant ran and did not get caught but later turned himself in. He admitted it was
a dumb college stunt. He participated in a pretrial diversion program. He was required to
perform community service, pay a fine, and was on probation. He successfully completed
the  program  and  in  1996  the  charge  was  dismissed.  Applicant  did  not  disclose  these
felony charges on his January 2019 security clearance application (SCA) as was required.
He testified he was aware the charge was a felony and serious. His explanation for failing
to disclose it was he marked “no” in error. He did not know why he would mark “no” and
said he did not intentionally falsify his SCA. (Tr. 23-31; GE 1, 2, 14)
In  December  1993,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  simple  assault-physical  menace.
He pleaded not guilty and was found not guilty. He could not recall this arrest or any of
the facts. (Tr. 30-31; GE 5)
In  October  1994,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  obstructing  highways/other  public
passages. He explained that he grew up in a tough neighborhood and the police were
doing a lot of sweeps in the street. He explained that if you were outside, you would get
swept  up.  and  go  to  jail.  He  was  home  from  college  and  was  with  friends  and  was
arrested. A warrant was issued in 2007 for failing to appear for this charge. He testified
he  was  unaware  of  the  notice  to  appear  because  he  likely  went  back  to  school.  The
charge was dismissed in 2008 but Applicant does not recall the situation. (Tr. 31-34; GE
2, 6)
In July 1996, Applicant was arrested for alcohol in public, bad check, and failure to
appear.  During  his  background  investigation  he  told  the  investigator  he  had  written  a
check and intended to put money in his account to cover the amount, but he had a serious
motorcycle accident and spent three months in the hospital. When he was notified about
the bad check, he went and paid it. He said this was a separate incident from the alcohol
in public charge. He stated he was probably loitering when the police came, and he likely
had a bottle in his hand. He pleaded guilty to the alcohol in public charge. Regarding the
failure to appear charge, he said he likely did not show up in court for a previous charge.
(Tr. 35-39; GE 2, 7)
In May 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled
dangerous substance, less than 50 grams of marijuana, 5 grams of hashish. He explained
he was arrested the day after his birthday. A friend had given him some marijuana as a
present, and he was stopped by the police. He had been consuming alcohol but did not
recall how much. He was searched and forgot he had the marijuana in his pocket. When
he went to court, he said the judge was angry at the prosecutor because he or she had
made an error and did not have the required original documents to prosecute the case.
The judge dismissed the charge and told Applicant it was his lucky day, and he should
buy a lottery ticket. (Tr. 39-43; GE 8)
In  response  to  questions on  his SCA that asked  if Applicant  had  ever been  charged
with  an  offense  involving alcohol or  drugs, Applicant  responded  “no.” He testified  that  he
was  not  convicted   but   he   was   charged   so   did  not   disclose   it.   He   said   he   may   have
interpreted the  question incorrectly.  (Tr. 43-44; GE 1)
In  June  2007,  Applicant  was  charged  with  public  drinking  alcohol  prohibited.
Applicant  testified  that  this  arrest  occurred  during  one  of  the  police  sweeps  of  his
neighborhood. He and friends were drinking outside a house that was close to a liquor
store. He pleaded guilty to the offense. He believed he was required to pay a fine. (Tr.
44-46; GE 2, 9)
In   June   2012,   Applicant  was  charged   with   driving   on   a   suspended
license/registration  suspended/revoked. He testified  his license  was suspended  because
of unpaid parking  tickets.  He went to  pay the  tickets and  learned  the  tickets  belonged  to
his father who  had  a  vehicle  registered  in  Applicant’s name  and  did  not pay the  tickets.
His father had moved. Applicant paid the  tickets,  and his license  was reinstated. (Tr. 46-
47;  GE 12)
In  March  2013,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  on  a  suspected
license/registration  suspended/revoked.  Applicant  testified  he  pleaded  not  guilty  to  the
charge, and it was dismissed. He stated he did not recall if his license was suspended.
When completing his SCA, it asked if Applicant had been issued a summons, citation, or
ticket  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal  proceeding  against  him.  He  responded  “no.”  He
testified  that  he  did  not  know  why  he  responded  ‘no”  and  did  not  disclose  the  2013
suspended license ticket. (Tr. 47-48; GE 1, 10)
In December 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating under the
influence  of  liquor  or  drugs  and  operation  of  a  motor  vehicle  while  in  possession  of
narcotics. Applicant testified that he was intoxicated and was pulled over by the police for
failure to maintain his lane. The police searched him and found a bag of marijuana on
him.  He  was  found  guilty  of  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  or  drugs  (DUI).  His
driver’s license was suspended. He was required to attend a 20-hour alcohol information
course. This was the first time he attended an alcohol information course. (Tr. 48-52; GE
11)
In August 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and driving while
license suspended or revoked. Applicant testified that he was drinking alcohol with friends
at a bar. He and his friend left, and Applicant was following his friend in his car to another
location. He was stopped by the police. He said he was unaware that his driver’s license
was  suspended  when  he  was  stopped.  He  learned  he  had  not  completed  the
requirements for reinstatement of his suspended license that was issued by another state.
He  said  he  took  care  of  the  requirements.  He  spent  a  couple  of  days  in  jail.  He  was
convicted  of  DUI.  He  was  ordered  to  take  two  alcohol  courses  that  required  weekly
attendance.  He  testified  he  did  not  have  a  problem  with  alcohol,  but  rather  he  had  a
problem with driving after he had consumed alcohol. (Tr. 52-56 73-74; GE 2, 14)
In November 2019, Applicant was charged with simple assault-family violence. He
was  ordered  to  attend  a  24-week  anger management  course.  He  and  his wife  had  an
argument,  and  he  tossed  a  purse  across  the  room  and  the  strap  hit  her  leg.  She  felt
threatened, called the police, and then hung up. The police arrived and he was arrested.
He  admitted  he  had  consumed  a  couple  of  beers  at  the  time.  His  wife  contacted  the
prosecutor saying she regretted her actions. Applicant’s case was nolle prosequi under a
pretrial diversion program after he completed an anger management course. (Tr. 56-58;
GE 2, 4)
In  his  March  2019  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  He
confirmed the accuracy of a summary of his interview in September 2020. Applicant told
the government investigator that he drinks one beer a day and four on the weekends. He
said he does not drink and drive and instead uses an UBER for transportation. He also
said that there was a zero-chance alcohol would have a negative impact on his life in the
future. At his hearing, he said he obviously did not adhere to that promise. (Tr. 74-75; GE
2)
Applicant was asked by the government investigator about his criminal record and
if he was ever charged with a felony, been convicted of domestic violence, or charged
with an offense involving a firearm, alcohol, or drugs and he responded “no, only the DUI
charges.”  Only  upon  being  confronted  with  the  2007  criminal  charge  of  possession  of
marijuana did he admit the offense. He did not disclose the felony robbery arrest in 1992;
the  1993  simple  assault  arrest;  the  1994  obstructing  a  public  highway;  the  1996
possession of marijuana; the 2007 public consumption of alcohol; and the 2013 driving
with a suspended/revoked license arrest. These arrests were not disclosed or discussed
during his March 2019 interview. (GE 2)
In January 2020, Applicant was interviewed again by a government investigator.
He was asked if he had been arrested, charged with, convicted of, or sentenced for a
crime,  or  received  a  summons,  citation,  or  ticket  to  appear  in  court,  or  has  been  on
probation or parole. He said “yes” and said he had previously discussed all of his criminal
activity during his March 2019 interview.  That interview included his three DUI arrests,
and the 2007 criminal charge of possession of marijuana, but did not include disclosure
of the felony robbery arrest in 1992, the 1993 simple assault arrest; the 1994 obstructing
a  public  highway  arrest;  the  1996  possession  of  marijuana  arrest;  the  2007  public
consumption of alcohol; and the 2013 driving with a suspended/revoked license arrest.
When he was asked by the investigator if he had any additional criminal activity to report,
he said “no.” He did not disclose the above arrests. (GE 2)
In December 2021, Applicant was arrested for DUI, possession of an open alcohol
container and defective tires. He testified that he was going home, and his tire blew out.
He  pulled  over  and  put  on  his  emergency  flashers.  The  police  stopped  to  assist  and
smelled alcohol on his breath.  He  said he  had  consumed two  to  three  drinks.  He  was
arrested. He said the alcohol containers found in the trunk of his car were not from that
night and were trash. He was found guilty and sentenced in October 2022. He received
credit for the time he served in jail, which was about five days and a 90-day jail sentence
that was suspended. He was required to go to DUI school and be evaluated. He testified
he did not receive a diagnosis from the evaluation. He is also required to take another
course on drugs. He said he is currently registering for the course. He received a fine of
$2,600 that he pays in installments. He is required to complete 120 hours of community
service. He has completed about 28 hours. He was required to wear an ankle bracelet for
three months in 2022 that detects alcohol consumption. He is no longer required to wear
the bracelet. When he completes the drug course, he can have his license reinstated on
a restricted basis to drive to and from work. He is required to have an interlock installed
on his car. He is on probation until October 2024. He is to abstain from alcohol while on
probation.  He  meets  with  his  probation  officer  monthly.  He  is  required  to  abide  by  the
terms of his probation. He testified that he has not consumed alcohol while on probation.
(Tr. 59-72; GE 3, 13)
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  from  1990  to  2016  and
wrote, “recreational occasional 5.” He testified that he does not know what he meant by
“recreational occasional 5.” During his background interview he told the investigator that
he  used  marijuana  three  times  a  month.  At  his  hearing,  he  said  he  did  not  know  how
accurate that statement was. He admitted that he has used marijuana since completing
his January 2019 SCA. He was asked when his last use was, and he said he consumed
an edible marijuana in 2021 and another time in 2022. He also acknowledged he was on
probation when he consumed the edible marijuana in 2022. He consumed it while at a
family  reunion.  He  said  he  no  longer  smokes  marijuana.  It  is  unknown  if  his  use  of
marijuana is a violation of the terms of his probation. (Tr. 75-82; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  told  the  government  investigator  that  he  continued  to  associate  with
people who use illegal drugs. At his hearing, he testified that he now tries not to associate
with people who use drugs. (Tr. 80-82; GE 2)
Applicant  was  asked  at  his  hearing  why  he  failed  to  disclose  his  felony  arrest,
domestic  violence  arrest,  alcohol  arrests  and  drug  arrests.  He  denied  he  intentionally
falsified his SCA. He said he did not remember a lot of his past. He said he did not have
any  idea  why  he  did  not  disclose  them  on  his  SCA  or  when  he  was  questioned  by  a
government investigator. He said at the time he did not recall certain offenses. He said
he was not trying to hide anything from the government. (Tr. 82-84)
Applicant testified that he has regrets his past, and he wants to move on. He is
remorseful for his past conduct. He has had personal issues that he has taken care of.
He stated that if it is determined that he needs additional treatment he will follow through.
He believes the anger management class he completed has helped his marriage. (Tr. 21,
84-85)

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted all the allegations under Guidelines J, G, and
H,  in  the  SOR  with  some  explanation.  He  failed  to  address  the  allegations  under
Guideline  E,  which  are  cross  allegations  previously  alleged.  I  will  adopt  Applicant’s
admissions  to  the  cross-alleged  allegations  as  his  response  to  the  Guideline  E
allegations as well. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is   27   years  old.   He   is   married   for  the   second   time.  He   served   in   the
U.S.  Marine   Corps   from   approximately   2015   to   2019   when   he   was  administratively
separated   with   a   general  discharge   as  further  explained,   infra.  He   has  worked   for   a
defense  contractor  since  June  2020.  He  has two  biological children  and  a  stepchild.  He
is a high  school graduate  and has taken some college courses.  (Tr. 6, 25-27; GE  1)
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged in January 2021, with
illegal discharge of a firearm, intoxication, and with carrying a dangerous firearm under
the influence of alcohol. He entered a plea in abeyance agreement and was sentenced
to pay fines and fees, and a term of 12 months’ probation. He was required to abstain
from  alcohol  consumption  during  his  probation.  In  about  September  2018,  Applicant,
while  serving  in  the  Marine  Corps,  was  charged  with  wrongful  use  of  controlled
substances  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ).  As  a  result  of  this
investigation, he was administratively separated from the Marine Corps and received a
general discharge. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b)
Under Guideline G, the SOR alleged Applicant was required to attend an alcohol
education  class  in  March  2019.  It  also  cross-alleged  the  firearm-alcohol  arrest  from
January 2021. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.b)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  steroids  from  September
2016  to  April  2017,  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  It  also  cross-alleged  the
September 2018 UCMJ offense. (SOR ¶¶ 3.a-3.b)
Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the allegations from SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
and 3.a. (SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.c)
Criminal Conduct.
Applicant  testified that he was using steroids  while on active duty in  the Marine
Corps  for  about  six  weeks  in  2016-2017.  He  testified  that  he  had  access  to  classified
information  at  the  time  of  his  use.  He  admitted  in  his  August  2020  security  clearance
application  (SCA)  that  he  used  steroids  from  September  2016  to  April  2017.  He
obtained  the  steroids  from  another  Marine.  He  claimed  that  he  began  using  steroids
because  he  was  concerned  about  being  able  to  meet  the  required  physical  fitness
standards of the Marine Corps. He also received advice from former Marines whom he
considered mentors. They recommended using steroids. He stated that he has not used
steroids since this time frame. (Tr. 24-25, 31, 33-35, 40; GE 1)
While  Applicant  was  investigated  and  interviewed  by  the  Naval  Criminal
Investigative  Service  (NCIS)  for  his  steroid  involvement,  there  is  no  evidence  that  he
was charged under the UCMJ. He admitted receiving an administrative discharge with a
general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions  characterization  related  to  his  steroid
involvement. (Tr. 25; GE 1, 4)
Alcohol Consumption.
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  NCIS  regarding  his  steroid  abuse,  he  also
admitted  drinking  approximately  10  beers  the  previous  weekend  at  a  housewarming
party. This information was related to Applicant’s command who ordered him to attend
alcohol-education classes. Applicant attended the classes. (GE 2; Answer to SOR).
The  second  alcohol-related  allegation  involves  Applicant’s  criminal  arrest  in
January 2021. He stated that he and his family were at a friend’s apartment complex to
celebrate New Year’s Eve. The apartment complex was in a residential area. There was
a  vacant  field  close to the apartment  complex  that  Applicant described  as about  three
miles long. He and his friend had been drinking alcohol that evening. At approximately
midnight, Applicant and his friend fired a small caliber rifle into the air three to four times
to celebrate the new year. A neighbor called the police and Applicant was cited for gun
and alcohol violations, upon which he later entered a plea agreement, supra. (Tr. 36-37;
GE 1-3, 6-7)
Drug  Involvement and Substance Misuse.
As  stated  supra,  Applicant  admitted  illegal  steroid  use  sometime  between
September 2016 and April 2017. He was an active-duty Marine then and had access to
classified information. His use, while a Marine, resulted in his administrative discharge
with a general discharge. He stopped using steroids in 2017. (Tr. 24-25, 31, 33, 35; GE

Personal Conduct.
The  factual  background  for  the  personal  conduct  allegations  have  been
previously described and will not be repeated here.
Applicant’s Mitigation.
Applicant  presented  his  2021  year-end  performance  review  and  his  2022
midpoint review. He is described as an effective team player. He makes an outstanding
contribution to the team’s productivity. He documented that he complied with the terms
of his probation and his 2021 gun and alcohol charges were dismissed. He testified that
he has had no further involvement with law enforcement since his January 2021 arrest.
(Tr. 44; AE A-B)

"Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e and denied 2.a
through  2.e  and  3.a.  Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  44  years  old.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2004.  He  never
married. He has a seven-year-old daughter from a relationship. He has  worked for his
current employer, a federal contractor, since 2015. (Tr. 22-25)
In  May  2000,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol
(DUI).  It  occurred  in  a  state  where  Applicant  did  not  live.  In  September  2007,  he
completed a security clearance (SCA) application. Question 23 asked about Applicant’s
police  record.  It  specifically  asked  if  he  had  ever  been  charged  or  convicted  of  any
offenses  related  to  alcohol  or  drugs.  He  responded  “no.”  In  response  to  the  “other
offense” category it requested to provide a “date of offense.” He wrote “5/2000.” Under
the  question  on  the  form,  he  was  asked  to  check  if  the  offense  involved  a  felony,
firearms  or  explosives,  pending  criminal,  alcohol  or  drugs,  court  martial  or  other
disciplinary  proceeding,  and  any  offense  not  listed  in  the  above  categories.  Applicant
checked the last box as an offense not listed in the above categories. He did not check
the  alcohol  or  drugs  category  box.  He  provided  information  about  the  offense  and
stated:
In the year 2000, when I was 21 years of age I was in a situation where I
received  a  wreckless  [sic]  driving  charge.  That  matter  was  closed  out  in
2005 and I have not received anything more then a speeding ticket before
or after the situation. (GE 2)
Under the section “action taken” he wrote:
I went to court and paid a fine for the wreckless (sic) driving[.] I didn’t lose
my license or anything, and have not done anything larger or smaller then
a  speeding  ticket  before  or  after  that.  That  as  my  only  run  with  the  [l]aw
since I was born. (GE 2)
He also stated:
The  reason  why  this  matter  was  closed  out  in  2005  was  because  I  was
under  the  impression  that  the  matter  was  handled  and  later  I  found  out
that it was not totally settled, so as soon [as] I could I called the courts to
[find] out what I needed to do to settle this matter. Got on a[n] airplane the
next week and flew to [X] and took care of the matter in one day. And that
was the end of the situation. (GE 2)
Applicant testified that the reason he checked  “no”  regarding an offense related
to  alcohol,  and  the  reason  he  failed  to  disclose  his  arrest  and  charge  for  DUI  was
because  he  did  not  understand  the  question.  He  said  he  believed  the  charge  was
reduced  to  “wet  and  reckless”  and  he  paid  a  fine.  In  the  state  where  Applicant  was
arrested  the  term  “wet  reckless”  refers  to  a  DUI  charge  that  was  reduced  based  on  a
plea  agreement  and  the  offense  involved  alcohol.1  Applicant  stated  that  he  was
confused how to report his DUI offense. He did not think he had to report it because he
was not convicted. He said even though he marked “no” on his 2007 SCA regarding an
alcohol offense that he wrote a letter to the federal government before he submitted his
clearance  application,  and  he  made  the  government  aware  of  his  charge.  He  did  not
provide  a  copy  of  the  letter  or  other  corroborating  evidence.  He  said  that  part  of  the
contents  of  the  letter  are  included  in  his  comments  that  are  noted  above  and  were
included  in  the  SCA.  He  testified  that  he  was  not  trying  to  mislead  the  government.
Although  the  charge  of  DUI  may  have  been  reduced,  the  “wet  and  reckless”  charge
involved alcohol, which the SCA specifically asked, and he did not disclose. (Tr. 22-35,
53-64)
In  2013,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI.  He  did  not  report  his
arrest to his facility security officer (FSO) or employer. He said he was unaware that he
was required to report the arrest because he held a clearance and thought he only had
to  report  a  conviction.  When  arrested  he  refused  to  take  a  breathalyzer  because  his
attorney  had  previously  advised  him  not  to  because  the  machine  is  inaccurate.  This
case was eventually nolle prosed. He was unsure why the charge was not prosecuted.
He admitted he had consumed alcohol before the arrest. He failed the field sobriety test,
and he told the police officer that he had consumed two beers and two shots of alcohol
forty-five  minutes  before  his  arrest.  During  his  May  2019  background  interview,  he
denied he consumed any alcohol.  At his hearing, he said he likely had more than one
drink hours before his arrest. (Tr. 35-38, 49, 74-80; GE 3, 9; AE B, C)
In 2017, Applicant completed another SCA. Section 22 asked if in the last seven
years  he  had  been  arrested  by  a  police  officer,  sheriff,  marshal  of  any  other  law
enforcement  official.  He  responded  “no.”  It  also  asked  if  he  had  EVER  been  charged
with an offense involving alcohol or drugs. He responded  “no.”  He did not  disclose his
May 2000 DUI arrest or later reduced “wet and reckless” charge or his September 2013
DUI  arrest  and  charge.  He  again  testified  that  these  were  not  reported  as  required
because they had been dismissed and there was nothing to report, and he thought they
went away. (Tr. 35-38, 64-67; GE 1)
1 California Vehicle Code 23103.5
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.
Applicant  disputed  the  investigative  summary  and  stated  when  asked  if  he  had  been
charged  with an offense  involving alcohol, he  admitted the 2000 DUI  arrest and noted
that  he  was  never  convicted.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  did  not  report  his  prior
arrests  on  his  2017  SCA  due  to  an  oversight  and  because  all  of  this  information  had
been  previously  provided  over  the  years  and  was  provided  during  his  initial  security
investigation  and  10-year  renewal  process.  He  reiterated  this  explanation  in  his
interrogatories.  He  admitted  he  had  been  drinking  when  he  was  arrested  in  2000.
Applicant  testified  that  when  he  was  specifically  asked  about  his  previous  arrests,  he
disclosed  them  to  the  investigator.  He  did  not  otherwise  because  he  thought  he  only
had to disclose convictions. I did not find Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 68-73; GE
3)
In  February  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  DUI.  He  said  he  did  not  think  he
had to report it to his employer if it was dismissed. He testified that he reported this DUI
to his employer after it was dismissed. He said that at this point he learned that he was
required to report his arrests. He said he thought if the case went away, he would not
have to report it. (Tr. 80-86; GE 3, 4, 8)
The police report for his February 2019 arrest reflects Applicant’s car was parked
half on the pavement and half on a grassy area with its hazard lights on. Applicant was
slumped in the seat and the car was running. The police officer could not conduct a field
sobriety test because Applicant was too intoxicated. He testified he does not know what
he was doing at the time. He refused to take a breathalyzer. During a December 2021
interview with a government investigator, Applicant said he entered a pretrial diversion
(PTD)  program  and  over  a  seven-to-eight-month  period,  he  was  required  to  be  tested
for  alcohol  consumption.  He  was  also  required  to  attend  an  alcohol  awareness  class
through Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Applicant testified that after going through the PTD
program, this was the first time he thought he might have an alcohol problem. Applicant
continued to consume alcohol. (Tr. 80-87; GE 4, 8)
In May 2019, Applicant was interviewed again by a government investigator and
asked  he  if  had  ever  been  arrested  or  charged  with  an  alcohol-related  offense.  The
investigator indicated Applicant responded “no.” Applicant disputes that and said he told
the investigator he had been charged but not convicted. In this interview they discussed
his 2013 DUI arrest. He denied he had been drinking. This contradicts the police report
and  his  testimony.  He  disclosed  to  the  investigator  he  had  also  been  arrested  in
February 2019 and charged with DUI. At the time of the interview, the charges had not
been adjudicated. He admitted to the investigator that he had been  consuming alcohol
prior to his arrest. He said this type of incident  was unlikely to recur because he does
not drink and drive. (Tr. 88-90; GE 3)
Applicant did not disclose his May 2000 or September 2013 arrests and charges
for DUI or “wet reckless” or any alcohol related offenses in his 2007 or 2017 SCA. It is
unknown who he provided the information to over the years other than a letter he said
he  wrote  to  the  government.  No  evidence  was  admitted  showing  he  provided
information about his 2013 DUI arrest and charge.
In  June  2019,  Applicant  responded  to  government  interrogatories.  Question  2
asked: Have you consumed any alcohol since January 2019. He responded “no.” At his
hearing,  he  testified  that  he  did  consume  alcohol  after  that  date.  As  noted,  he  was
arrested in February 2019 and charged with DUI. (Tr. 87-90; GE 4)
In response to the June 2019 interrogatories, Applicant wrote:
I do not consider myself as a heavy drinker or an irresponsible drink[er]. I
am not an alcoholic, nor do I drink on a[n] everyday or every month basics
[sic].  I  have  never  been  convicted  of  DUI  or  for  having  a  drinking  issue.
(GE 4)
In   June   2020,   Applicant  was  arrested   and   charged   with   DUI.   He   was  found
passed  out at the  wheel of his car while sitting  at a  traffic light.  He  took a  breathalyzer
test  at  the   scene   and   recorded   a   .24%  BAC.  The   police   offered   to   take   him   to   the
hospital because  he  was so  intoxicated.  Applicant testified  he  was  not  feeling  well  and
had   taken   some   cold  medicine.  Once   at  the   police   station, he   refused   to  take   another
breathalyzer.   Applicant  was  convicted   of  DUI.   He  was   ordered   to   pay  a   fine   and
sentenced   to   365   days  in  jail,  suspended;  and   attend   a   highway  intoxication   seminar.
Applicant  admitted   he   was  driving   while   intoxicated.  According   to   the   employer’s
documents,   in   October 2020,  Applicant  informed   them   he   was  arrested   on   August  21,
2020,  for DUI.  Applicant testified  that his June  2000  conviction  was appealed  and  was
sent to the circuit court where he was approved to  participate in a  PTD program. (Tr. 90-
106; GE  5,  7, 11; AE E)
In January 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. It is unclear if he
was  still  participating  in  a  PTD  program  from  his  June  2020  DUI  charge.  He  told  the
police he had consumed two beers. He failed a field sobriety test and recorded a .11%
BAC. Applicant disputed the accuracy of the BAC saying it took numerous attempts to
complete  it.  The  police  officer  noted  that  Applicant  had  trouble  following  simple
instructions. Applicant does not believe he was intoxicated or impaired. He admitted he
had  a  few  beers.  His  case  was  adjudicated  in  a  PTD  program.  He  continued  to  drink
after his January 2021 arrest. He testified that he last  consumed alcohol in July 2021.
He said he realized he needed to stop drinking alcohol. (Tr. 106-118; GE 3, 6, 12; AE E,
G, I)
The requirements of this PTD program  were to complete a 12-week 36 session
alcohol rehabilitation class, be tested for alcohol consumption, and perform community
service. Applicant went to court ordered AA but did not resume when the PTD program
ended.  He  successfully  completed  the  alcohol  rehabilitation  class  and  found  it  very
helpful.  According  to  the  director who  testified  on  his behalf,  he  was  a model  student.
Since  completion  he  will  occasionally  stop  by  the  class  and  inspire  those  who  are
attending the class. He found the class very helpful. He testified that he no longer has a
desire to drink alcohol. (Tr. 112-127; AE E)
In Applicant’s government interrogatories from June 2022, he made a correction
to his summary of interview from November 2018. He stated he told the investigator that
he  had  been  charged  with  an  offense  involving  alcohol,  but  he  was  not  convicted.  He
stated:
The reason there was an oversight in the information is due to the fact that
all of this information has been provided over the years as it relates to my
security clearance and wasn’t hidden in any way, due to the fact that the
case was 22 years ago, but again, never hidden and provided  during my
initial  security  clearance  investigation  and  10  year  renewal  process.  (GE
3)
Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  report  the first  four  DUI  arrests  to  his employer  until
2020  when he became  aware of the  requirement  to  do  so  because  he  held a  security
clearance.  He  reported  his  2021  DUI.  He  explained  he  did  not  report  the  pre-2020
charges because he believed if the charge was dismissed  the case was resolved, and
he was not required to report it. (Tr. 53-58)
Applicant testified that he was a social drinker. He would not drink at home alone.
He did not realize for a period that he might have an alcohol problem. His mistake was
drinking and driving. He stated the alcohol class he was required to take as part of his
last PTD was very helpful. He took responsibility for his conduct. He believes he is not a
threat to national security and can be trusted. (Tr. 40-46)
Applicant  admitted  he  is  an  alcoholic.  He  testified  that  he  no  longer  consumes
alcohol. He does not have the urge to drink. He does not go to clubs. He used to drink
on the weekends and admitted he would occasionally drive after consuming alcohol. His
cousin  is  a  recovering  alcoholic  and  acted  as  his  sponsor  while  he  was  attending  the
court-ordered classes. He still has regular contact with his cousin. (Tr. 127-132)
The  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  of  the  rehabilitation  center  that  Applicant
attended  testified  on  his  behalf.  He  described  him  as  an  excellent  participant  who
helped  others  and  followed  all  of  the  rules.  He  never  missed  a  session.  He  believes
Applicant  is  in  recovery.  After  Applicant  completed  the  course,  he  would  return
periodically. The CEO explained that anyone in recovery can relapse, but Applicant has
been sober for about two years. (Tr. 136-139; AE A)
A substance abuse counselor employed where Applicant attended rehabilitation
testified  that  participants  are  welcomed  to  return  after  they  graduate.  She  has  been
employed  at  the  facility  for  a  month.  Applicant’s  counselor  during  his  rehabilitation
thought he  would benefit from an evaluation.  The  substance abuse  counselor was not
involved  in  his  treatment.  She  conducted  an  alcohol  substance  abuse  measurement
metric on Applicant as an evaluation. He was required to complete a questionnaire and
she  met  with  him  for  about  an  hour  and  conducted  an  objective  test.  Her  testing
revealed  he  had  a  very  low  score  indicating  he  was  likely  in  a  low-risk  category  for
relapse. She was not focused on his past alcohol-related incidents, as this is not part of
the testing process but is focused on his recovery. (Tr. 139-158)
Applicant  provided  a  letter  from  his  employer  that  noted  he  is  an  employee  in
good  standing.  His  performance  is  characterized  as  “successful”  based  on  his  last
performance  assessment.  He  was  recognized  in  November  2022  for  his  contributions
and received a special recognition bonus. He was counseled in November 2021 by the
FSO  and  provided  additional  training  regarding  appropriate  notifications  and  has
completed his annual security refresher training in 2021, 2022, and 2023. (AE J)

"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his answers to the SOR, except for
any references in the allegations to sections in the state code, which he denied. He is 34
years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was engaged to be married and he has two
minor children. He has owned his home since December 2018. (Answer; Answer 2; Tr.

Applicant obtained his high school diploma in 2007. He has also received several
professional certifications. He has worked in the security field since 2010. As of the date
of the hearing and since January 2021, he has worked as an industrial security specialist
for his employer, a DOD contractor. He also has worked as a part-time security officer for
an  agency  or  department  of  the  U.S.  government  since  January  2023.  He  was  first
granted a security clearance in approximately 2011. (Tr. at 5, 20-23, 79-80, 85-87, 91-93;

Applicant’s parents separated when he was four years old. He and his three older
brothers were raised by their mother. His father “was in and out of my life growing up so
that kind of took a toll on me, didn’t understand why he didn’t want to be, you know, part
of me and my brother’s lives.” He testified:
Just –  well, my mother was always working so I kind of  –  you know, kind of
just  grew up  watching  stuff  in  the  neighborhood, you  know,  really not any
type  of, like  real discipline. I felt like  that,  you  know, kind  of led  me  down a
path of wrong  decisions. (Tr. at 24-26)
Between  2009  and  2022,  Applicant  was  involved  in  seven  alcohol-related
incidents.  In  December  2009,  at  age  20,  he  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  public
swearing/intoxication, and he was found guilty in absentia. (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 2.h) He recalled
living with his mother and believed he had just been laid off from his job as an electrician.
He  acknowledged  consuming  alcohol  before  age  21,  but  he  could  not  recall  the
circumstances surrounding this incident. (Tr. at 27-28, 80; GE 5)
In November 2010, at age 21, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor Driving
While  Intoxicated  (DWI),  1st  offense.  He  pled  guilty  to  the  reduced  charge  of
misdemeanor  reckless  driving,  and  he  was  sentenced  to  90  days  in  jail,  suspended,
unsupervised probation for one year, his driver’s license was restricted for six months, he
was ordered to attend an alcohol safety action program (ASAP), and he was fined. (SOR
¶¶ 1.e, 2.h; Tr. at 28-31, 83-88; GE 4, 5)
This was Applicant’s first DWI. He consumed around three to four 12-ounce mixed
drinks while he was at a bar with a friend for a birthday party. It was raining as he drove
home,  and  he  lost  control  of  his  vehicle  and  hit  a  street  pole.  He  was  hospitalized  for
“breaks  in  my  pelvis,  fractures  in  my  spine,  and  a  laceration  in  my  hand,”  and  the
passenger had a ruptured spleen and possibly a broken rib. Applicant testified:
Well,  in   the   past,   I   blamed   [the   car  crash]  on   the   weather.  Always
considered  myself good  enough  to, you  know, drive  that day. And  looking
back now on  it, I believe  alcohol definitely played  a  factor in my decisions
that night. I made  a  poor decision  to  make  the  turn doing  40  miles an  hour
and   having   summer  tires  on   the   vehicle   and   losing   control.   I  definitely
shouldn’t have  been  driving  if I  wasn’t  able  to  make  the  correct decision  in
the weather.   (Tr. at 28-31, 83-88; GE  4, 5)
In  March  2013,  at  age  23,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DWI,  1st
offense,  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  greater  than  .20%,  and  carrying  a  concealed
weapon, both misdemeanors. He was convicted of the amended charge of misdemeanor
DWI, 1st offense, no BAC, and sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 88 days suspended, his
driver’s license was restricted for one year, he was ordered to have an ignition interlock
device installed on his car for six to 12 months and to attend an ASAP program, and he
was  fined  $500.  The  latter  charge  was  nolle  prossed.  He  attended  and  successfully
completed an ASAP program in August 2014. He did not believe he underwent an alcohol
evaluation  at  this  time.  His  driver’s  license  was  reinstated  after  one  year  without
restriction. (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.f, 2.h; Tr. at 31-38, 89-101, 148-149; GE 1, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant consumed around three to four, 12-ounce beers earlier that day while he
was replacing  a  broken  headlight  on  his brother’s car.  Later that evening, after he had
slept for around three to four hours, he drove his brother’s car to the home of his then-
girlfriend, now fiancée. A police officer pulled him over for disobeying a traffic signal. In
response to the officer’s questioning, he admitted to consuming alcohol earlier in the day.
The officer administered a breathalyzer and conducted a search of the car, and the officer
found a butter knife in the center console. Applicant was unaware there was a knife in the
car, and he believed it belonged to his brother who owned the car. He acknowledged that
he should not have consumed alcohol when he knew he had to later drive, but at the time
he stated that he did not think he was intoxicated because he had slept  after he drank
and before he drove. (Tr. at 31-38, 89-101; GE 1, 3, 4, 5)
In  August  2015,  at  age  26,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DWI,  2nd
offense  within  five  years,  and  refusal  of  blood  or  breath  test,  2nd  offense,  both
misdemeanors.  Both  charges  were  nolle  prossed.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  2.h)  He  denied
consuming alcohol before this incident. He stated that his day was an early and  a long
one, as he drove his mother two and a half hours to see his brother, and then he drove
her back to her home where he hung out with her before driving to visit a friend who lived
near his apartment. He testified that as he was driving home:
It  was pretty  late  at  night.  I  don’t remember the  exact time.  But I  was driving,
and I fell  asleep. And  when I woke up  –  like I dozed off for a second. When
I  woke   up,  I  was  doing   probably  like   45   miles  an   hour  on   [the   highway].
Woke  up, and  at the  last minute, tried  to  correct the  steering  wheel because
there   was  like   a   concrete   barrier  on   the   side.  They   were   doing,  like,
construction. And  so  when  I did that, the  car swerved  back and  forth  and  it
hit the  concrete  barrier. The  airbag deployed.  I hit my head on  the  steering
wheel. I wasn’t wearing  a  seatbelt at the time. So  when  the  officers arrived
on  the  scene,  I was, like, leaning  on  the  car,  you  know, still  in  a  daze  from
smacking   my  head   and   having   the   airbags  flow  in  my  face.  The   officers
never asked  me  did  I need  any aid or anything. It  was just  more  so, Have
you been drinking?  Like, no.  Okay.  Do you  mind  taking  a  sobriety test?  I’m
like, I’m   not   going  to   take  one   because   you  all   didn’t  offer me  any aid.  At
that point, I was . . . arrested  and  taken  to  jail. (Tr. at 38-41, 106-112; GE  3,

restricted  for six months, and  he  was  fined. The  latter charge  was nolle  prossed.  (SOR
¶¶  1.b, 2.h)  He consumed  around  four to  six  12-ounce  beers at a  party at a  friend’s house.
He decided  to  try to  “sleep  it off” in his car, which he  acknowledged  was “probably not the
best  idea,”   but  his  intention   was  to   leave   the   party,   otherwise  he   likely  would  have
continued   drinking.   He   left  his  keys  in  his  ignition   after   rolling   down   a   window,  but  his
engine  was  off.  He woke  up  when  a  police  officer tapped  on  his door  and  asked  if  he  had

drank around  three  to  four 12-ounce  beers at  home  and  was  smoking  cigarettes on  the
steps  in  front  of  his  home   when   police   officers,  who   were   walking   through   the
neighborhood,  approached   and   told   him   they  had   received   a   noise   disturbance.  The
officers, who  recognized  him  from  an  incident that  occurred  in  July 2019,  as  discussed
below, “made  a  comment about [the  July 2019  incident],  to  which  I got kind  of,  you  know,
mouthy  with  them  after  that.” The  officers then  “came  up  on  the  steps and  said  that  they
smelled   alcohol.”  After  he   told  the   officers,  “Hey,   you   know,  I’m   on   my  property,  not
bothering  anybody,  not  doing  anything;  you  all came  up  messing  with  me, pretty  much,”
the  officers arrested  him.  He  stated  that  the  police  officer  who  showed  up  to  court told
him that it would only be a civil penalty and not a criminal charge, so he did not fight it
and  paid  the  fine.  He  stated  that  he  should  not  have  listened  to  that  officer.  He
acknowledged that he should have been smart when the police officers approached him
that day and either gone into his house or listened to what they had to say and tried to
diffuse the situation. (Tr. at 43-47, 69-75, 137-141; GE 1, 6)
In February 2022, at age 32, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI, 2nd
offense within five to ten years, and DWI, refusal of breath test, 2nd offense within ten
years. (SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 2.h) In December 2022, he was convicted of the amended charge of
misdemeanor reckless driving and sentenced  to 30 days  in jail, suspended,  placed on
one year of unsupervised probation, his driver’s license was restricted for six months, he
was ordered to attend a week-long ASAP program and an outpatient program, and he
was fined $250. The latter charge was nolle prossed. (Tr.at 47-52, 141-162; GE 7, 8, 9)
Earlier  that  day,  Applicant  consumed  around  two  to  four  12-ounce  beers.  That
night, he moved his car within his neighborhood to a better parking spot, and when he
got out of his car to see how close he was to the curb, he did not notice that it was still in
reverse, and it rolled back and hit the car behind it. The owner of that car witnessed the
incident and contacted the police. The officer that arrived asked Applicant if he had been
drinking,  and  he  responded  affirmatively.  When  the  officer  asked  Applicant  to  do  a
sobriety  test,  he  refused  because  he  was  not  in  the  car  when  the  officer  arrived.  He
acknowledged at the hearing that he should not have operated his car after he had been
consuming  alcohol,  even  if  it  was  to  move  his  car  to  a  better  parking  spot  in  his
neighborhood. (Tr. at 47-52, 141-162)
Applicant stated that he last consumed alcohol in December 2022. Up until then,
he had been consuming approximately four 12-ounce beers once or twice weekly. As of
the date of the hearing and since December 2022, his driver’s license was still restricted,
he  was  still on probation,  and he  was  in a  19-week  outpatient  alcohol  program,  which
required  him  to  remain  sober  and  attend  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings  twice
weekly. He paid the court-ordered fine in March 2023, and at a date not in the record, he
completed the court-ordered ASAP program. He intended to successfully complete the
19-week outpatient program. He stated that he has not received any other alcohol-related
treatment and he has never received an alcohol-related diagnosis. Although he does not
believe he has an alcohol problem, he stated that  he intends to remain sober, and his
family and friends are supportive of his decision. When asked whether he was choosing
to abstain from alcohol because he wanted to do so or because the outpatient program
required it, he responded:
I’m  doing  it  for, I would  say, both. I kind  of want to, you  know, start  making
better decisions, you  know. I had  plenty of chances, you  know, but  I think
that,  you  know,  now that this  being  the fifth time,  you  know -- or I think that
I just, you  know, just  tired  of,  you  know, making  poor decisions. (Tr.  at 51-
58, 141-162)
In  addition  to  his  alcohol-related  incidents,  Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal
involvement.  In  May  2010,  he  was  charged  and  convicted  of  reckless  driving,
endangering life, limb, and property. He was fined. He was first at a traffic light with other
cars to the side of him, and he intentionally accelerated his car to burn the rubber on his
tires when the light turned green. The police officer who pulled Applicant over told him
that he could smell the rubber from his car tires, and the officer gave him a summons to
appear in court. (SOR ¶ 2.g; Tr. at 58-60, 81-83; GE 4, 5)
In  October  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  assault  on  a  family
member,  and  he  was  found  not  guilty  in  January  2015.  (SOR  ¶  2.e)  He  and  his  then-
girlfriend, now fiancée, got into an argument. As he tried to leave through the front door,
she stood in front of it and continued to yell at him. He asked her to move, she refused,
and he “pushed her out of the way.” He spent the night at his mother’s house. His then-
girlfriend,  now  fiancée,  contacted  the  police.  The  next  day,  he  turned  himself  into  the
police  after  learning  from  his  brother,  who  was  informed  by  his  then-girlfriend,  now
fiancée,  that  there  was  a  warrant  out  for  his  arrest.  He  was  released  on  his  own
recognizance on the condition that he appear at the court date, and a “no contact” order
was issued. She testified at court that she did not recall what happened that night. (Tr. at
60-64, 101-106; GE 3)
In  January  2019,  Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  assault  on  a  family
member, and the charge was nolle prossed. (SOR ¶ 2.d) He and his then-girlfriend, now
fiancée, got into another argument and “I got really mad and I punched the glass picture
frame that was on the wall and punched a hole in the wall.” He cut his hand as a result.
She  contacted  the  police,  he  was  arrested,  taken  to  jail,  released  on  his  own
recognizance,  and  a  no  contact  order  was  issued.  She  failed  to  appear  at  court.  He
understood that he dealt with his frustration and anger, in 2014 and 2019, inappropriately.
He attended and completed an anger management class in December 2021 and learned
methods  such  as  “try  not  to  argue  back,  don’t  take  an  aggressive  tone,  and  separate
myself from the situation,” that he intends to utilize in the future. (Tr. at 64-68, 115-120;
GE 3; AE B)
In  April  2019,  Applicant  was  charged  and  convicted  of  misdemeanor  reckless
speeding for driving 103 miles per hour (mph) in a 65-mph zone. He was sentenced to
180  days  in  jail,  with  176  days  suspended,  and  fined  $500.  He  spent  two  days  in  jail.
(SOR ¶ 2.c) He was driving home at night after spending the day with his brothers, and
he was speeding, because he was “just tired, just trying to get home.” He did not realize
how fast he was driving. The state trooper who pulled him over asked him if he had been
drinking, which he denied, and the trooper gave him a summons to appear in court. (Tr.
at 69-75, 120-124; GE 1, 4, 6)
In  July  2019,  Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  violation  of  a  fire
prevention code, and the charge was dismissed in March 2021. (SOR ¶ 2.b) He drank
around three beers and then began working on his car that had been giving him problems.
As  he  attempted  to  trigger  his  car’s  check  engine  light  to  determine  the  source  of  the
problem, he “revved the gas on the car continuously. And then eventually the car caught
on fire.” He did not realize the car was on fire until he saw smoke, and  when he got out
of the car to try to extinguish the fire, he sustained second-degree burns to two toes on
his right foot. A neighbor contacted the fire department when Applicant could not, because
his phone and personal belongings were still inside the car. The firefighters extinguished
the fire, he was transported to the hospital and released the same night, and a fire marshal
charged him with violation of a fire prevention code the next day. (Tr. at 72-75, 124-132;
GE 1, 3, 6)
In  August  2019,  Applicant  was charged  with  misdemeanor  reckless  speeding,  for
driving  101  mph  in a  70-mph  zone. In  November 2020, he  pled  nolo  contendere  and  he
was  sentenced   to  30  days  in  jail,  suspended,  his driver’s  license  was  restricted   for 30
days,  and   he   was  fined   $500.  (SOR  ¶   2.a)  He  lost   track  of  time   while  fishing   with   his
brother,  and  he  was speeding  to  pick up  his children  from  daycare before it closed. The
state  trooper who  pulled  him  over asked  him  if he  had  been  drinking, which  he  denied,
and  the  trooper gave  him  a  summons to  appear in court. He completed  a  mandated  driver
improvement  class,  and  he  understood  that  speed  limits  exist  to  protect him  and  others
on  the  road  and  he  does not intend  to  speed  in the  future.  (Tr. at  75-78,  132-137, 157-
158; GE  1, 6)
At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that “I made some poor decisions and put
myself in some bad situations.” He stated that he has matured and “I’m hoping to show
the court that I’ve learned and grown from my prior actions and prove that it won’t happen
again.”  He  completed  106  hours  of  community  service  in  November  2020.  He  did  not
begin to receive annual security training until he started working for his current employer
in  January  2021.  Since  receiving  such  training,  he  is  aware  that  holding  a  security
clearance  requires  him  to  abide  by  the  laws,  comply  with  rules  and  regulations,  and
exercise  good  judgment  in  his  decision-making.  He  is  also  aware  of  the  reporting
requirements for security clearance holders. Character references, to include from two of
his  brothers,  his  sister-in-law,  a  former  neighbor,  his  children’s  grandfather,  and  two
friends, attested to his integrity, trustworthiness, and reliability. (Tr. at 23-24, 78, 91-93,

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, with explanations. He denied
SOR  ¶¶  1.e-1.g.  His  admissions are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After a  thorough  and
careful review of the testimony, pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  33  years  old.  He  is  single,  never  married  and  has  one  minor  child,
who  lives  with  his  mother.  He  is  currently  employed  by  a  government  contractor,  for
whom  he  has  worked  since  November  2019.  He  is  a  network  engineer  who  has
numerous  information  technology  (IT)  certifications.  He  received  his  initial  IT  training
from the Army. He enlisted in the Army in 2013 and served until October 2019, when he
was  honorably  discharged.  He  is a  high  school  graduate  and  has taken  some  college
courses. (Tr. 19-20; GE 1-2)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant:  (a)  received  alcohol  treatment  in  2015,  from  the
Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP); (b) received nonjudicial punishment for
being drunk on duty (Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 112) in February
2019;  (c) received  inpatient alcohol treatment  from a civilian hospital  from  February to
March  2019,  where  he  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use  disorder  (severe,  continued,
with  withdrawal,  uncomplicated)  and  upon  discharge,  was  advised  to  abstain  from
alcohol  and  attend  outpatient  treatment;  (d)  received  outpatient  alcohol  treatment
through the Army’s Substance Use Disorder Clinical Care (SUDCC) from March 2019 to
October 2019, where he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (severe) and advised
to  remain  abstinent  from  alcohol  and  continue  attending  group  and  individual
counseling; (e) was treated in an emergency room in July 2019, after drinking two 750
ml. bottles of alcohol over the course of two days; (f) was discharged from the Army in
October  2019  for  failing  to  successfully  complete  the  SUDCC  program;  and  (g)
continues to consume alcohol against treatment advice and recommendations. (SOR ¶¶
1.a-1.g)
I will address each alleged alcohol incident below:
Alcohol Treatment through  ASAP  in 2015.
In December 2015, Applicant was in a physical confrontation with another soldier
who  Applicant  claims  was  drunk  at  the  time.  Applicant  admitted  consuming  alcohol
before the altercation, but claimed he was not intoxicated. The military police responded
and Applicant and the other soldier were taken to the station and wrote statements. His
command  became  involved  and  Applicant  claimed  that  in  order  to  avoid  discipline,  he
agreed  to  complete  ASAP,  which  was  a  one-year  course.  No  records  are  available
concerning  Applicant’s  participation  in  ASAP.  Applicant  testified  that  the  program
included  group  counseling  once  a  week,  individual  counseling,  regular  alcohol testing,
and  an  order  to  abstain  while  in  the  program.  He  claimed  he  was  not  aware  that  he
received a diagnosis regarding his alcohol use. He also stated that he felt like he was
just checking a box by participating in this program. (Tr. 24-29; SOR answer; GE 8, p. 3)
February  2019 Nonjudicial Punishment for Drunk on Duty (UCMJ Art. 112).
In February 2019, during a weekend before Applicant had duty, he drank enough
alcohol so that when he showed up for a Monday physical training session with his unit,
his first sergeant smelled alcohol on him. His first sergeant ordered Applicant to take a
breathalyzer  test,  which  showed  a  blood  alcohol  content  of  .08  ml.  Applicant  later
admitted to his treating doctor that he drank a gallon of rum, followed by another fifth of
a gallon of rum over the weekend before his Monday duty day. Based upon Applicant’s,
blood  alcohol content,  his  commander  punished  him  under Article  15  of  the  UCMJ  for
being  drunk  on  duty.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  restriction  and  extra
duties for 45 days and a reduction in grade from E-5 to E-4. He received his punishment
in July 2019 and was discharged from the Army in October 2019. (Tr. 30-31, 32; SOR
answer; GE 2, p. 11, GE 4, p.1, GE 14)
Civilian  Inpatient Alcohol Treatment From February  2019 to March 2019.
As a result of Applicant’s showing up for duty while intoxicated, described above,
he  was  also  sent  to  Behavioral  Health  where  he  was  enrolled  in  the  Army’s  SUDCC
program. In this case, he was sent to a civilian inpatient alcohol treatment program. The
program  lasted  28  days.  He  was  admitted  on  February  27,  2019.  He  underwent  an
intake assessment the following day. This is when he told the treating  physician about
the  amount  of  alcohol  he  consumed  the  prior  weekend.  The  initial  diagnosis  given
during  his  intake  assessment  was:  alcohol  use  disorder,  severe,  continuous,  with
withdrawal, uncomplicated. (Tr. 32; SOR answer; GE 4)
Applicant  completed  the  28-day  program  and  was  discharged  on  March  27,
2019. His discharge summary written by his treating physician noted:
Patient  participated   in   chemical   dependency   program   and   worked   on   his
12   steps.   Patient   completed   5   out  of  12   therapeutic   steps  and   a   relapse
prevention  plan  before discharge  from the hospital.
The summary further stated:
It  is worth  noting,  however, the  patient’s commitment  to  complete  sobriety
is  very  questionable.   Patient  told   [treating   physician]  that   he   is  not  sure
whether  he   would  stay  compliant  with   treatment   recommendations,
although  in the  short-term  he  does not want to  drink. . . He,  however, also
stated   that  this  is  just   a   blip   that   he   does  not  see   himself   sober  in  the
future. He thinks he would resume  drinking  at some point. (GE 5)
Applicant attended all his group sessions and did all his required homework. He
declined  an  offer  to  have  any  medications  prescribed  for  alcohol  management.  His
discharge  diagnosis  was:  alcohol  use  disorder,  severe,  continuous,  with  withdrawal,
uncomplicated. (GE 5)
Outpatient   Alcohol  Treatment  From  March   2019   to   October   2019   Through   the
Army’s SUDCC program.
Applicant was placed in the Army’s SUDCC outpatient program upon completion
of  his  inpatient  program.  He  began  this  program  in  March  or  April  2019.  Applicant
described the program as him attending  group counseling sessions two times a week,
alcohol testing once a week, and individual counseling once a month. He was required
to  abstain  from  alcohol  in  order  to  successfully  complete  the  program.  His  counselor
was  a  licensed  mental  health  counselor  (LMHC).  According  to  Applicant’s  treatment
records he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. The records also indicated
that  Applicant  admitted  using  alcohol  on  several  occasions  while  in  the  program.  He
used alcohol on  April 26,  2019.  He  admitted this use  in a  group  session.  He admitted
using  alcohol  again  on  June  8,  2019,  during  a  group  session.  In  approximately  July
2019,  Applicant  reported  to  his  dietician  that  he  was  consuming  a  pint  of  liquor  every
workday  and  even  more  on  the  weekends.  Records  also  show  that  he  reported
consuming alcohol in June and July 2019. (Tr. 35-37;GE 6-9, 12-13)
Medical  Treatment in   July   2019   in   a   Hospital  Emergency   Room   After  Drinking   at
Least Two 750  ml. bottles of alcohol over two days;  and
Discharge from the Army for Alcohol Rehabilitation Failure  in October 2019.
On    September  24,  2019,   Applicant’s  father   passed   away   due   to   complications
from  alcohol abuse. In  his SOR answer,  he  stated  that  the  day following  the  news about
his father,  he  had   less   than  one  drink   while  alone   in his barracks  room  on   an   off-duty
weekend.  In  his hearing  testimony, he  stated  he  bought  a  pint of  rum and  drank  about
half  of  it before  his first sergeant  showed  up   at  his room.  His  first   sergeant  suspected
that he  had  been  drinking  alcohol  and  took  him  to  the  hospital to  have  his blood  drawn.
Applicant  acknowledged   that  event,  but  denied   being   intoxicated   and  to   the   contrary
averred   that  his  first  sergeant  was   intoxicated.  There   is  no   information   in   the   record
concerning   the   result  of  this  blood   test   or  the   amount  of  alcohol  consumed.  Applicant
was discharged  from  the  Army  less  than  a  month  later.  The  basis  for  his discharge,  as
noted   on   his  discharge   certificate   (DD-214)   was  Army  Regulation   (AR)   635-200,
Chapter 9,  which  is titled  “Alcohol or Other Drug  Rehabilitation  Failure.”  (Tr. 37-39,  41-
42; SOR Answer, See  AE B; GE  2, pp. 6-7)
Applicant   Continues   to   Consume   Alcohol  Against  Treatment   Advice   and
Recommendations.
During Applicant’s background interview with an investigator, in November 2020,
he  stated  he  no  longer  drinks  alcohol.  In  his  answers  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  July
2021, he stated he drinks two beers weekly, with his last consumption being on July 16,
2021. He further stated he did not intend to continue that rate of consumption. He  also
indicated that he becomes intoxicated when drinking three beers. The last time he was
intoxicated was December 2019.  He also answered that he never  consumed alcoholic
beverages before going to work, failing to list the  February 2019 incident when he was
charged with being drunk on duty and which led to his inpatient alcohol treatment. (GE
2, p. 7; GE 3, pp. 3-4)
Before  Applicant  was  disqualified
it  was
recommended  that  he  continue  group  counseling  and  forego  use  of  any  alcohol
(substance).  His  discharge  treatment  plan  included  as  an  objective,  “abstain  from
alcohol.” (GE 8, p. 5; GE 11, p.5; GE 12, p.5)
the  SUDCC  program,
from
Applicant currently drinks alcohol on his nonwork days and he also abstains from
alcohol  the  day  before  his  first  work  day  of  the  week.  He  drinks  approximately four  to
five vodka drinks per occasion. He claims to only drink at home, never out in public. He
claims  he  does  not  drink  to  intoxication,  but  the  last  time  he  was  intoxicated  was  in
December 2022, when he was at a friend’s house celebrating their birthdays, which fall
on the same day. He claims he had no alcohol incidents before the Army and none after
his discharge from the Army. He claims that alcohol is not important to his life. He has
not seen a counselor about his alcohol use since he left the Army in October 2019. He
has  not  attended  any  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings  since  leaving  the  Army.
Applicant  stated  that  alcohol  has  no  meaning  in  his  life,  but  he  also  stated  that  he
enjoys drinking alcohol  because it takes the edge off of things. He submitted a written
letter of intent to “continue my modification of alcohol consumption.” He also stated that
if he chooses to drink alcohol, he  will do it in a responsible manner. He owns his own
home where he is the sole occupant. (Tr. 45, 47-49, 69, 71, 73-74; SOR answer, See
AE D)
After  considering  all  of  Applicant’s  prior  statements  during  his  inpatient  and
outpatient treatment, as well as his statement to his background investigator, there are
significant inconsistency between those statements and his hearing testimony. Overall, I
did not find his testimony credible.
Character  and Possible Mitigation Evidence.
Applicant  presented  eight   character   letters  from   supervisors,  colleagues   and
friends.  They describe   Applicant as  responsible   and   someone   who   is dedicated,  hard-
working,   trustworthy,   and   who   has high   character.  Several   recommend   continuation  of
his  security  clearance.  Applicant  also   presented   a   professional   certification,  his  2021
civilian  performance  appraisal with  an  overall rating  of  “regularly exceeds  expectations,”
and  his  2018  Army  fitness  evaluation,  indicating  his  overall  “qualified”  rating.  (SOR

"Applicant  admitted  all of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  His  admissions  have  been
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  37  years  old.  He  completed  training  as  an  emergency  medical
technician  in  2005  but  was  unable  to  find  a  job  in  his  field  because  he  did  not  have
experience.  He  was  married  from  2005  to  2006,  which  ended  in  divorce.  He  does  not
have children. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor. since January
2022. (Tr. 32-35; GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  in  about  2016,  after  his  father  passed  away,  he  began
consuming alcohol excessively. He would drink to intoxication regularly. He would go to
bars and have four to five drinks. He kept a bottle of liquor in his car in case he went out
and did not want to pay for expensive drinks at a bar. (Tr. 42-44, 59)
Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in March 2021.
He took a breathalyzer and recorded .216% and .221%. Applicant testified that he had
consumed liquor in his vehicle after a difficult day at work. He drank it in a parking lot.
While driving, there was a tire tread in the road, and he swerved and lost control of his
vehicle. He was told he hit a post but did not recall that he did. He was arrested a short
time later at a fast-food restaurant. He admitted he was intoxicated when he was arrested.
He also had in his possession some pills that were prescribed to him, but the prescription
was expired, and he had put them in a smaller container that was unmarked. (Tr. 44-48;
GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant  pled  guilty  to  the  DUI  offense,  and  the  charge  of  possession  of  an
unmarked expired prescription was withdrawn. He was given 18 months’ probation, a fine,
court-ordered alcohol and drug counseling, and he was required to have an interlock on
his vehicle for 12 months. He completed all the terms of the probation. (Tr. 48-49; GE 6;
AE B)
Applicant credibly testified that this was a wakeup call for him, and he never wanted
to spend another day in jail. He essentially stopped consuming alcohol after his arrest
and has only had three or four drinks since then at family gatherings. He no longer wants
to drink alcohol and has declined it numerous times when offered. He viewed his arrest
as a life-changing event. (Tr. 35-40)
Applicant participated and completed alcohol and drug counseling as  mandated
by the court. He was an outpatient and participated in group therapy. He found it very
helpful and was provided alternatives to handing stress. He does not crave alcohol. (Tr.
57-58; GE 5, 6)
Applicant  testified  that he  was  in a  toxic relationship  with  his fiancée  during  the
time he was drinking. His mother was ill and passed away in May 2022. He and his fiancée
broke up and that has had a positive effect on him. He is an only child, and he inherited
his mother’s  house.  He  spends his time  working  on  the  house.  He  also has been  in a
stable  relationship  for the  past  six months.  His  girlfriend  does  not  consume  alcohol  or
drugs.  Through  his  commitment  to  moderate  his  consumption  he  has  not  had  any
problems related to alcohol. He does not have any in his house, except some cooking
wine. He has had no other alcohol-related incidents and does not foresee any in his future
because of his abstinence. (Tr. 38-40, 49-52, 54)
In about June 2021, Applicant was prescribed medical marijuana, which is legal in
the state where he lives. He would purchase it about twice a month. When he completed
his security clearance application (SCA), he did not disclose his use because he viewed
it as a prescription drug, and it was not illegal in his state. When he was confronted by
the investigator, he readily admitted he used medical marijuana and was unaware that it
was illegal under federal law. He believed he was answering the drug questions on his
SCA  truthfully.  I  find  he  did  not  deliberately  fail  to  disclose  his  illegal  drug  use  under
federal law. (Tr. 40-42, 50-52; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  testified  that  he  had  been  using  medical  marijuana  regularly  for
relaxation, anxiety, to help him sleep, and pain management. He explained that at one
time he weighed more than 500 pounds and lost weight through surgery. He developed
back pain due to his weight and that was one of the reasons for his marijuana use. He
admitted he did not stop using it immediately after learning it was illegal because he was
weaning himself off it. During this March 2022 interview with a government investigator,
he said he would prefer not to relinquish his medical marijuana card, and he intended to
use marijuana in the future. He also said that he was willing to cease using it to keep his
job. At his hearing, he credibly stated that he will not use marijuana in the future and will
find  alternative means for controlling  his issues.  He  stopped using  it  about  six months
ago. He said he is willing to destroy his medical marijuana card and not renew it. He fully
understands the importance of remaining drug free.  Applicant credibly testified that his
life  has  turned  around,  and  he  is  ready  to  move  forward.  Post-hearing,  he  provided  a
shredded copy of his medical marijuana card to show in good faith he did not intend to
use marijuana again or renew his prescription. (Tr. 42, 50-51, 54-57; GE 2; AE C)
Two witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. Both have served extensively in law
enforcement  for  more  than  27  years  each,  including  as  detectives,  investigators,  and
police  officers.  Both  have  extensive  experience  in  investigating  narcotics  and  alcohol-
related offenses. One was his former supervisor before her retirement and the other is
the  current  supervisor  of  security  where  he  works.  They  were  both  aware  of  his  DUI
conviction. They describe Applicant as a model employee. He was never observed being
under  the  influence  of  drugs  or  alcohol.  He  is  a  punctual,  responsible,  reliable,
dependable, and trustworthy employee. They have seen his commitment to his lifestyle
change.  He  has  taken  full  responsibility  for his  conduct  and  has  learned  from  it.  They
believe that he made a mistake, and he is worthy of a second chance. (Tr. 17-30)
Applicant provided a letter from a coworker. She believes Applicant is professional,
reliable, punctual, honest, friendly, and trustworthy. He is serious and conscientious about
security and following the rules and policies of the employer. He willingly goes above and
beyond what is required in his duties. (AE A)

"Applicant denied all allegations contained in the SOR except SOR ¶ 1.d. (Answer)
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  amended  his  Answer  to  change  all  of  his  denials  to
admissions under Guidelines J, G and E. (Tr. 10) After a thorough and careful review of
the admissions, pleadings, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 54 years old. He earned an associate’s degree in 2004. He has never
been married, and he does not have any children. Since September 2017, he has been
employed by a federal contractor as a machinery maintenance mechanic.  He  is in the
process of applying for a DOD security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 29-30; AE K)
Criminal Conduct:
In order to keep the events in chronological order, I will reverse the order of the
SOR allegations.
Applicant was arrested in December 1990 and charged with disorderly conduct.
(SOR ¶ 1.k) He testified that he was staying in a dormitory when a fight occurred. The
police report in evidence showed that the victim specifically identified Applicant as being
one of the main assailants. The victim had seen Applicant holding a gun, thought to be a
BB-gun, behind his back. The police found five rounds of .38spl, two WCC round nose
lead rounds with brass cases, two federal round nose lead rounds with nickel cases, and
one Winchester .38+P jacketed hollow point round, in Applicant’s pants pocket. Applicant
admitted  that  the  police  did  find  his  bullets,  but  he  claimed  that  his  bullets  were  on  a
keychain that had been discovered in his dresser drawer. There was no mention in the
police report that these bullets were found on a keychain or recovered from his dresser.
Applicant admitted he had missed the original court date, and a bench warrant had been
issued  for  his  arrest.  He  was  found  guilty  of  an  ammunitions  violation  and  disorderly
conduct. He paid restitution and a fine. He denied he had a BB gun or a pellet pistol the
night of his arrest. (Tr. 77-82; GE 2, 6, 7)
In September 1992,  Applicant was  charged with open container in a vehicle. An
arrest warrant was outstanding for Applicant’s  contempt of court charge, as noted above,
and he was taken into custody. This offense was not alleged in the SOR. (GE 2, 6)
Applicant was arrested in November 1991 and charged with aggravated assault.
(SOR ¶ 1.j) He testified that his younger sister had been beat up by a group of girls and
returned home. The parents of the girls came to his house to confront his sister. One of
the parents pushed his sister, so he got in the middle and he may have pushed the parent
off of his younger sister. He believed a neighbor had called the police and he and one of
the  parents  were  arrested.  At  court  they  both  decided  that  they  did  not  want  to  press
charges and the case was dismissed. (Tr. 74-77; GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that on September 14, 1992 Applicant was arrested and charged
with disorderly conduct. Applicant testified that he was in a group of eight friends, and
they had just finished watching a movie. They were in a strip mall playing around, acting
immature,  and  pushing  each  other  when  the  police  arrived  and  arrested  them  for
disorderly conduct. He was 23 years old at the time. They all appeared before the judge
and were found not guilty. (Tr. 71-73; GE 2)
In  about  September  1996,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  disorderly
conduct.  (SOR  ¶  1.h)  Applicant  testified  that  some  of  his  family  members  were  in  the
courtroom because the defendant had killed his father after driving under the influence of
alcohol.  Some  of  the  defendant’s  family  members  were  also  in  the  courtroom,  and
Applicant had witnessed one member shove his mother. He got in between his mother
and the defendant’s family member and a big commotion broke out in the courtroom. The
bailiff  charged  all  of  the  family  members  with  disorderly  conduct.  The  charges  were
subsequently dismissed. (Tr. 70-71)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  in  April  2004  and  charged  with
aggravated  assault.  He  explained  that  his  second  oldest  sister  suffers  from  bipolar
disorder, and she  threatened their mother. Applicant and his brother told her to leave the
house.  His  sister  called  the  police  and  reported  false  accusations  about  him  and  his
brother. They were both arrested despite neither one of them had touched their sister.
The charges against them were eventually nolle prosequi. (Tr. 66-70)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  in  June  2007  for  soliciting
prostitution. He testified that an old female friend of his had asked him to meet with her
because she had just learned that Applicant’s mother had passed away in 2006. He did
not know that she was a prostitute. He met with her in his car in front of her grandmother’s
house. The police pulled up behind him, questioned them separately, and then informed
Applicant that he was being arrested for soliciting prostitution. He claimed they had been
talking in the car for approximately 30 minutes. Applicant presumed his female friend must
have said something incriminating to the police for them to arrest him, or speculated that
maybe the police assumed he had been doing something illegal because they were aware
this female was a prostitute. Applicant stated the judge dismissed the charge against him.
(Tr. 58-66)
In October 2010, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUIA). (SOR ¶ 1.e). He testified:
I fractured  of  a bone  in  my foot and  I had a  boot cast on. So  I was  going  to
CVS  pharmacy to  pick  up  a  prescription.  And  as  I  was  coming  out  of  the
pharmacy, it was,  a  commotion  was going  on. I was in Chicago  at the  time.
It   was  commotion   that  was  going   on   in  that  area.  I  don't  know  what
happened,  but it  was  a  commotion  that  was  going  on.  Before  I  even  got  to
the  car, the  police  had  pulled, had  stopped  me  before I got into  the  car. And
as I didn't even  get into  car to  drive  it, they  were  saying  that,  you  know, they
charged  me with  a DUI. (Tr. 52)
Applicant stated that he believed he was arrested due to racial profiling, and that
the police officer did not even offer him a field sobriety test. Although there was no arrest
record provided, a certified statement of disposition showed that Applicant was found not
guilty of the DUIA. This alcohol-related arrest was not listed on his February 2022 SCA.
(Tr. 54; AE E)
In June 2011, Applicant was arrested for driving on a revoked/suspended license.
(SOR ¶ 1.d). He testified that although he was found not guilty of DUIA in May 2011, he
was unaware that his driver’s license had been suspended following this arrest. He also
was  unaware  that  he  needed  to  pay  a  fee  to  have  his  driver’s  license  reinstated.  He
explained this to the judge and was sentenced to perform community service. The charge
was subsequently dismissed. (Tr. 56-58; GE 2)
In  February  2020,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  domestic
battey/physical contact (SOR 1.c.) that led to a protective order against Applicant, and his
August 2020 arrest for the violation of that protective order (SOR 1.b). Applicant testified
that in February 2020, he resided with his fiancée (F), his fiancée’s son (FS), the son’s
partner  (SP), and  the  son’s children. At the  time, SP was  prohibited  by Department of
Children and Family Services from supervising  the children. While F and FS were away,
Applicant became upset that SP was left to care for the children. FS returned home and
he and Applicant got into an argument. Eventually F arrived home, and she called the
police to report that Applicant had just pushed her. She made additional false allegations
against  Applicant  to  police.  He  was  arrested  and  charged  with  domestic  battery.  On
February  25,  2020,  F  filed  for  a  protective  order  against  Applicant.  While  an  interim
protective order was in effect, F claimed that Applicant circled her residence in his car;
however, Applicant countered that he no longer had the make and model of car F had
identified. (Tr. 35-52; AE C, D, V, X; GE  1, 2, 5)
Applicant submitted documentation that showed his newer car, a Honda CRV, was
purchased on May 6, 2020. He possessed his original car for over two months after the
interim protection order had been issued. On February 9, 2021, this arrest was alerted
through the DOD Continuous Evaluation Program because Applicant had failed to report
it to his employer, as required. In April 2021, over a year since his arrest and due to delays
from the pandemic, the judge found Applicant not guilty of the two charges. In September
2021, his ex-fiancee filed another protective order against him for allegedly making phone
calls. She failed to appear in court and the protective order was vacated in October 2021.
Applicant listed this arrest on his February 2022 SCA. (Tr. 35-52; AE C, D, V, X; GE 2, 5)
SOR  ¶   1.a   alleges   that  Applicant   was   arrested   in   November 2021   and   charged
with  DUIA–  2nd  offense,  improper traffic lane  usage, and  operating  an  uninsured  motor
vehicle. The  police  report disclosed  that Applicant had  reported  that  he  was  on  his way
home from his  sister’s birthday  party. Applicant at first d  enied  he  consumed  any  alcohol,
but he  later admitted  to  the  police  officer that  he  had  consumed  one  alcoholic beverage.
The  police  report  also  disclosed  that  Applicant had  participated  in  a  breathalyzer test  and
appeared  to  have  urinated  in his pants. He  was placed  under arrest after his  blood  alcohol
content (BAC)  was measured  0.245%.  Applicant’s car appeared  to  have  been  involved  in
a  hit and  run  accident since  there was significant damage  to  the  front of the  car, the  front
passenger tire was blown,  and  Applicant had  been  driving  on  the  rim. Applicant testified
that he   told   the   police   officer that   he   was not  feeling   well   and   that  he   needed  medical
treatment.  The police dropped him off at his home
Applicant  testified  that  he  had  been  to  the  dentist  to  have  a  tooth  removed  on
Thursday. He went home and was not feeling well, and he was not eating or taking his
type II diabetes medication. Around 4:00 AM on Sunday, he decided to drive himself to
the hospital. He was in a state of confusion and was pulled over by the police for driving
under 20 mph in a 45 mph zone. He did not have a sister who had a birthday during the
month  of  November,  and  he  admitted  he  was  very  confused  when  speaking  with  the
police  officer.  Applicant’s  counsel  asked  him  if  he  was  familiar  with  hyperglycemia.
Applicant  stated  that  this  condition  occurs  when  your  blood  sugar  is  not  properly
controlled with medication. The symptoms include confusion, loss of motor skills, and, if
left  untreated,  it  can  ultimately  lead  to  diabetic  stroke.  He  also  stated  that  he  takes
medication  for  type  II  diabetes,  but  he  had  not  personally  experienced  symptoms  of
hyperglycemia  because,  for  the  last  15  years,  he  had  always  taken  his  diabetic
medication  as  prescribed.  The  only  time  he  did  not  take  his  diabetic  medication  was
during this particular incident while he was suffering from extreme tooth pain. Applicant
testified that he had not consumed any alcohol that night or during the past 27 years after
his father was killed by a drunk driver in 1996. (Tr. 31-38; AE Q, R, S, U; GE 1, 2, 3, 4)
Applicant testified that after the police dropped him off at his home he called 911
to go to the hospital. A blood sample was taken that showed his blood sugar was high,
reportedly  126.  He  was  held  at  the  hospital  for  about  four  hours  and  released.  He
eventually hired an attorney who recommended that he plead guilty to the reduced charge
of reckless driving. In December 2022, Applicant pled guilty to reckless driving. He was
required to enroll in an alcohol program, use an alcohol-testing device for one year, attend
a victims-impact panel, and pay fines of $2,502.  His required use of the testing device
was later reduced to six months after he successfully passed all alcohol-breath tests. He
was also placed on probation for two years. (Tr. 38-43; AE A, B, D, F, T; GE 4)
At the time of the hearing, Applicant remained on probation, which was scheduled
to terminate on December 6, 2024. He disclosed this arrest on his February 2022 security
clearance  application  (SCA).  He  listed  that  the  DUIA  charge  was pending  and  that  he
“was on medication for tooth pain from the doctor.”  There is nothing in the police report
that indicated Applicant had told the police officer that he was not feeling well or that he
needed medical attention.  He had been taken to the police station following his arrest,
and he had refused to provide another breath sample or answer police questions. After
completing the booking process the police dropped him off at his home. Applicant testified
that he was very confused, feeling terrible, and he was likely suffering from hyperglycemia
at the time of his arrest. Since he had not consumed any alcohol, he assumed diabetic
ketoacidosis could have caused him to provide a false positive on the breathalyzer test,
based on the medical reports and studies in the record. (Tr. 38-43; AE A, B, D, F, T; GE
1, 4)
Applicant testified that he did not specifically request any alcohol test or toxicology
tests when he was hospitalized following his arrest. The hospital records reflected that
Applicant  had  apparently  complained  of  abdominal  pain  following  a  motor  vehicle
accident. There was no evidence that Applicant entered the hospital due to high blood
sugar, tooth pain, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. The medical records disclosed
that  Applicant  had  no  evidence  of  acute  abnormality  in  the  chest,  abdomen,  or  pelvis
following a CT scan. His lab results showed that he scored within the normal range, low
range,  as  well  as  in  the  high  range  in  several  test  areas.  There  is  no  documentary
evidence that Applicant experienced, tested, or was treated for high blood sugar levels,
hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. (Tr. 44; AE T, Y)
The  medical  information,  studies,  and  reports  in  the  record  noted  that
hyperglycemia  occurs  usually  when  a  person  with  diabetes  skips  insulin  or  other
medications prescribed to lower blood-sugar levels. It stated that “Hyperglycemia usually
doesn’t cause symptoms until blood sugar (glucose) levels are high – above 180 to 200
milligrams…”  (emphasis  added;  AE  P)  The  lab  result  of  Applicant’s  blood  sugar  level
following  his  DUIA  arrest  was  reported  at  126.  (AE  T)  In  addition,  the  Mayo  Clinic’s
medical report stated that symptoms of hyperglycemia develop slowly over several days
or  weeks.  (AE  P)  In  this  instance,  Applicant  had  a  tooth  pulled  on  Thursday  and  on
Sunday  morning  at  4:30  a.m.,  he  was  arrested  for  DUIA  and  claimed  he  was  likely
suffering from hyperglycemia. Based on this information it does not appear, nor is there
any evidence to support, that Applicant was suffering from hyperglycemia at the time of
his  second  DUIA  arrest.  Applicant’s  systoms  are  consistent  with  a  highly  intoxicated
individual whose BAC was measured at 0.245%. (GE 4)
Another  medical  article  described  diabetic  ketoacidosis  as  a  severe  medical
condition  that  is  life-threatening.  This  condition  develops  after  an  individual  suffers
uncontrolled  hyperglycemia.  (AE  AA)  Because  the  record  evidence  did  not  establish
Applicant  suffered  from  hyperglycemia,  Applicant  similarly  did  not  establish  that  he
suffered from diabetic ketoacidosis. Therefore, the discussion of this medical condition is
irrelevant and not entitled to much weight in my decision. (AE P, W, AA, BB)
Applicant  was  sentenced  to  enroll  in  the  Level  2  intensive  outpatient  program
(IOP). The one-page IOP summary from an addiction counselor stated that Applicant had
successfully completed the program on January 27, 2022:
[Applicant]  has been  encouraged  to  regularly engage  in community support
group  meetings (e.g.  12-step  groups),  get a  sponsor; engage  regularly in
mental  health   treatment  and   continue   to   actively  apply  what   had   been
learned in group.  (AE J, Z)
There was no diagnosis or prognosis given in the IOP summary, but based on the
comments  provided,  it appears that  Applicant  was  treated  for  some  type  of  substance
misuse.  The  addiction  counselor’s  recommendation  that  Applicant  participate  in  a
continuing support group and obtain a sponsor infers that Applicant had misused some
type of substance. Applicant  did not  disclose  this alcohol treatment,  which he had  just
completed, on his February 2022 SCA. He did not provide complete treatment records
except for the one-page summary. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant is
complying with the addiction counselor’s recommendations.  (Tr. 44; AE J, Z; GE 1)
Applicant has been employed by a federal contractor for six years. He stated that
he  just  recently  found  out  that  he  is  required  to  report  any  arrest  to  his  employer.  He
initially denied that the employer provided annual security briefings, but then he changed
his mind and admitted they do have annual security briefings. The reporting requirement,
however, had not been discussed during those earlier security briefings. He did not report
his February 2020 arrest for domestic assault/physical contact, his August 2020 arrest for
violation of a protection order, or his November 2021 arrest for DUIA to his employer, as
required. (Tr. 98-100)
Alcohol and Personal  Conduct:
Paragaph 2 of the SOR (Guideline G) cross-alleged the two DUIA arrests (SOR
¶¶ 1.a and 1.e), and Paragraph 3 of the SOR (Guideline E) cross-alleged all of the criminal
allegations cited under Paragraph 1.
Applicant submitted seven character-reference letters. Three letters were authored
by  former  or  current  co-workers,  two  letters were  provided  by  his sisters,  and  another
letter  was  provided  by  a  collegue.  A  one-page  summary  was  also  submitted  from  the
Level 2 IOP addiction counselor, as previously discussed. All six references agreed that
Applicant was honest, trustworthy, and possesses a great deal of integrity. (AE J, U, Z)
Applicant provided a 2018 and 2021 employee year-end performance reviews. He
was  rated  a  “successful  performer”  those  two  years.  I  did  not  see  his  year-end
performance  reviews  for  2019,  2020,  or  2022.  Applicant  also  submitted  several
certificates of achievement, recognition and awards from 2001 to 2006. (AE H, M)
",False
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e,
1.g, 2.a, 2.b, 3.a-3.c, and 4.a. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i,
and 4.b. He did not respond to the amendments to the SOR, and I have treated his lack
of  response  as  denials  of  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k.  His  admissions  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  senior  principal  software  development  analyst,
employed by a defense contractor since April 2020. He was employed by several private-
sector companies from May 2009 until April 2020. He was unemployed from June 2017
to January 2018, May to August 2019, and October 2019 to April 2020. His unemployment
from  June  2017  to  January  2018  occurred  after  he  was  laid  off  for  unsatisfactory
performance.
Applicant has never married and has no children. He has lived with a cohabitant
since  September  2019.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  science  in  June
2004.
The  SOR,  as  amended,  alleges  eleven  delinquent  debts,  which  are  reflected  in
credit reports from May 2023 (FORM Item 5), October 2022 (FORM Item 6), and January
2021 (FORM Item 7). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: credit-card account placed for collection of $15,703. The account
was  charged  off,  but  the  credit  report  from  May  2023  reflects  that  Applicant  made  a
payment in April 2023 and the balance has been reduced to $12,639. (FORM Item 5 at
6)
SOR  ¶   1.b:  credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $10,129.  Applicant
settled  this  account  for  less  than  the  full  balance.  The  credit  report  reflecting  this
information does not reflect when the account was settled, or the amount paid to settle it.
(FORM Item 5 at 8)
SOR  ¶   1.c:  account  placed  for  collection  of  $9,909.  Applicant  is  making
payments on this account under a partial payment agreement. The credit report reflecting
this payment agreement does not reflect when the agreement was made, the amount of
the payments, or the balance remaining on the debt. (FORM Item 6 at 2)
SOR ¶  1.d: unsecured personal loan placed for collection of $7,458. This loan
was charged off for $12,458. The May 2023 credit report reflects that Applicant made a
payment of $780 in March 2023. (FORM Item 5 at 6)
SOR ¶  1.e: credit-card account placed for collection of $3,089. This account
was charged off for $3,089 and closed by the lender. The last payment was in February
2022. (FORM Item 5 at 5)
SOR ¶  1.f:  credit-card account placed for collection of $2,368. This account
was settled for less than the full amount. The credit report reflecting the settlement does
not reflect when it was settled, or the amount paid to settle it. (FORM Item 5 at 7)
SOR ¶ 1.g: same debt as SOR ¶ 1.e.
SOR ¶  1.h: collection account for $1,919. Applicant denied this debt, claiming it
was paid in full. The May 2023 credit report reflects an unpaid balance of $1,382. (FORM
Item 5 at 3).
SOR ¶  1.i: collection account for $1,615. Applicant denied this debt, claiming it
was paid in full. The October 2022 credit report reflects it as unpaid. (FORM Item 6 at 3.)
SOR  ¶   1.j:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $2,277.  The  May  2023  credit
report reflects that this account was charged off and closed. It is not resolved.  (FORM
Item 5 at 5)
SOR ¶  1.k: credit-card account referred for collection of $814. The May 2023
credit report reflects that this account is past due. The last payment was in April 2023. It
is not resolved. (FORM Item 5 at 3.)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his three periods of unemployment in
2017-2020.  During  his unemployment  in  2017,  he  cashed  in  $14,000  in  bitcoin  to  pay
bills. In December 2020, his vehicle was repossessed, but he redeemed it and is current
on the payments. As of February 2021, he was earning about $140,000 per year. (FORM
Item 4, subject interview at 2-3)
Applicant’s  excessive  alcohol  consumption  is  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.a.  He  was
arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in July 2010. He pleaded guilty, his license
was suspended, and he completed a nine-month diversion program, followed by three
months of probation. (FORM Item 4, subject interview at 5-6). The DUI is also alleged as
criminal conduct in SOR ¶ 4.a.
Applicant consumed alcohol heavily from 2014 to 2018. He drank six beers every
weekday and 24 beers on weekends. In 2018, Applicant decided to reduce his drinking.
He did not seek or receive treatment.  In February 2021, he told a security investigator
that he was avoiding bars and limiting himself to one drink on one night per year. (FORM
Item 4, subject interview at 5)
Applicant  had  an  alcohol-related  altercation  with  a  then  cohabitant  in  2014  that
occurred when they were both drinking heavily. The only evidence of this altercation is
Applicant’s  explanation  during  the  subject  interview  in  February  2021.  According  to
Applicant, his cohabitant  initiated the  physical contact  by biting, hitting, and scratching
him  and  smashing  a  computer  monitor  on  his  head.  During  the  altercation,  they  each
threw the other’s cellphone into the street. He was charged with felony domestic violence
and damaging a communications device, but the charges were dismissed. (FORM Item
4, subject interview at 6)
Applicant’s drug involvement is alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c. In his SCA, he
stated that he no longer enjoys marijuana, that he stopped using cocaine because “it is
not worth the personal risk and attracts an unsavory crowd,” and he stopped using nitrous
oxide because “it negatively affects awareness while in use.” He disclosed that he used
nitrous oxide inhaled from whipped cream dispensers while unemployed from September
2017 to January 2018, and in December 2020, after being hired by his current employer.
(FORM Item 3 at 43, 44)
During  an  interview  with  a  security  investigator  in  February  2021,  Applicant
disclosed  that  he  smoked  marijuana  “a  few  times”  each  year  from  1994  to  November
2017. He disclosed that he used cocaine with friends five to seven times between July
2017 to 2018. He told the investigator that he used cocaine because a “romantic interest”
used it, but the “romantic interest” did not develop, and he stopped using it. (FORM Item
4, subject interview at 3-5)
In response to DOHA interrogatories in February 2023, Applicant stated that his
last drug involvement was a single cocaine purchase in July 2020. (Item 4 at 7) He stated
that he no longer associates with past friends who engage in drug use and heavy alcohol
use. He has not sought or received treatment or counseling for alcohol or drug use and
has  not  participated  in  any  alcohol  or  drug  rehabilitation  programs  such  as  Alcoholics
Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous. (FORM Item 4 at 8-9)

Paragraph 1  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted “with clarifications” each of the five allegations
under this guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to
the matters alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR:
1.a. March 2019  Arrest for Attempted  Assault, Resisting  Arrest,  Obstruction  of a
Police  Officer, and  Assault or Battery. Applicant engaged in a dispute with a driver from
a ride-share company (the Driver) after a night in a bar with friends. Applicant and his
friends were arguing with each other over where the Driver should go first.  The Driver
pulled over and asked the occupants to get out of his car. Applicant got out of the car and
proceeded to punch the Driver in his left cheek with a closed fist through the open window.
Applicant and his friends entered a nearby hotel. The Driver called the police, and upon
arrival  at  the  scene,  the  police  interviewed  the  Driver.  He  provided  the  police  with  a
description of Applicant’s assault and advised that Applicant and his friends had entered
a hotel across the street. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied that he punched the
Driver in the face. He also claimed it was the Driver who was being aggressive, and it
was Applicant who demanded the Driver to pull over and let the group leave the car so
they could find another ride to their homes. (Tr. at 15, 51; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 1-10.)
The police entered the hotel and identified Applicant by the Driver’s description of
him. The police attempted to question Applicant about the dispute. Applicant declined to
respond,  even  refusing  to  provide  his  name  and  identification  card.  He  testified  at  the
DOHA  hearing  that  he  was  unaware  that  he  was  required  to  provide  his  name  and
identification  to  the  police.  The  police  asked  Applicant  to  provide  his  side  of  the  story
regarding his interactions with the Driver. He refused to speak and told his friends to “shut
up.” The police further advised Applicant that he would not be allowed to leave without
properly identifying himself. He again refused. At the hearing, Applicant justified his lack
of cooperation with the police by testifying “there was a lot of racial things going on in the
nation,  and  I  didn’t  want  to  be  involved  or  be  one  of  them.”  He  also  claimed  he  was
unaware of the reason why the police were asking him questions. He was placed under
arrest for assaulting the Driver. He continued to refuse police orders and actively refused
to put his hands behind his back so that he could be handcuffed. He was so strong that
the police could not undo his grip on his hands in front of him. He continued to resist all
instructions from the police, even after being told he would be pepper sprayed in the face
if  he  did  not  cooperate.  He  was  then  pepper  sprayed  and  handcuffed  with  his  hands
behind his back. He refused to walk to the police vehicle, and due to his large size, four
police officers had to carry him to the vehicle. He further resisted the officers attempt to
have him sit in the vehicle. Instead, he laid on the back seat with his feet hanging outside
the door preventing it from closing. (Tr. at 14-17, 51-55; GE 2 at 8-9; GE 3 at 10-11; GE
4 at 1; GE 5 at 1-10.)
The  police  determined  that  based  upon  the  Driver’s  statement  regarding  the
incident that they had probable cause to arrest Applicant for assault. They also concluded
that they had probable cause to arrest him for resisting arrest/obstructing a police officer.
He was charged with those two misdemeanor offenses. Applicant’s version of the incident
with the Driver was unpersuasive, and his demeanor throughout his testimony regarding
his interaction with the police further undercut the credibility of his testimony. Moreover,
Applicant’s  behavior  was  totally  at  odds  with  his  stated  concern  about  the  police
overreacting and using excessive force against him. In reality, his behavior reflected his
abuse of alcohol that evening, which would explain why the criminal trial judge ordered
Applicant  to  abstain  from  consuming  alcohol  for  90  days  as  part  of  his  agreement  to
dismiss the charges. (Tr. at 14-17, 51-55; GE 2 at 8-9; GE 3 at 10-11; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at
1-10.)
1.b.  January 2013  Arrest for Abusive Sexual Conduct in  Violation  of the  Uniform
Code  of Military Justice  (UCMJ) Article 120. On or about May 14, 2011, Applicant, others
from the Academy, and a female civilian (the Civilian) were together drinking alcohol at a
night club. The group then went to a hotel room to continue drinking alcohol. The Civilian
was intoxicated and laid down on a bed in the room. She then fell asleep. When Applicant
and the Civilian were later alone in the room, Applicant laid down on the bed next to The
Civilian and touch her genitals through her underwear. The Civilian awoke and told him
to stop several times, which he did briefly. He continued to arouse himself against her
body and eventually ejaculated. The next day the Civilian filed a sexual assault complaint
with the local police, though she did not know Applicant’s identity. She received medical
attention, and it was noted that there were bruises on her thigh. Also, Applicant’s DNA
was found on her back. She subsequently identified Applicant when she saw his picture
on  a  television  show  in  connection  with  other  sexual  assaults.  The  local  police  ceded
primary  jurisdiction  over  the  investigation  and  charges  to  the  Academy.  Applicant  was
charged with violating Article 120 of the UCMJ. At the June 2012 courts-martial described
in SOR ¶ 1.c, Applicant was found not guilty of this charge. (Tr. at 17, 46-48; GE 6 at 2,
4; GE 10 at 1-2.)
1.c.  June  2012  Court-Martial Trial and  Conviction  for Violations of UCMJ Articles
80,  120,  and  128.  In June 2012, Applicant was court-martialed for the conduct set forth in
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d and 1.e. He was charged with violating Articles 80, 120, and 128 of the
UCMJ, and he was convicted on the specifications relating to the incidents alleged in SOR
¶¶  1.d  and  1.e.  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  dismissal  from  the  service,  six  months  of
confinement, and forfeiture  of all pay and allowances.  A punitive dismissal  is the legal
term for the dishonorable discharge of an officer or academy cadet. He appealed and his
conviction was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeals for his branch of the military. He
was dismissed from the Academy. (Tr. at 21-22, 44; GE 6 at 1-2; GE 7; GE 8; GE 12.)
1.d.   December  2011   Arrest  for  Wrongful  Sexual   Contact   in  violation   of   UCMJ
Article 120. In November 2011, Applicant was investigated for a sexual assault involving
a  female  classmate  (the  Classmate)  that  occurred  in  about  March  2011  in  Applicant’s
dorm room at the Academy. He, two male classmates, and the Classmate spent several
hours drinking alcohol and playing cards late at night. He met the Classmate for the first
time that evening. The Classmate  became intoxicated and vomited. She fell asleep on
the  bed  of  Applicant’s  roommate.  The  male  classmates  left  the  room  to  return  to  their
rooms, leaving Applicant alone with the Classmate, who was asleep. Applicant was highly
intoxicated. Applicant pulled his pants and underwear down to midthigh. The Classmate
felt Applicant entering the bed in which she was sleeping and lie behind her, pressing his
body against hers. He then took her hand and rubbed it against his genitals. After a few
seconds, she was coherent enough to realize what Applicant was doing and pulled her
hand away. She then vomited again. He claimed at the DOHA hearing that he stopped
his sexual actions when she told him to stop. Applicant testified at the DOHA hearing that
he was wrong to make the Classmate feel “uncomfortable.” Applicant was charged and
convicted  of  Wrongful  Sexual  Conduct  in  violation  of  Article  120  of  the  UCMJ.  His
conviction was upheld on appeal.  Applicant did not acknowledge that his conduct was
criminal. (Tr. at 22-24, 45-46, 50-51; GE 7 at 3; GE 9 at 2, 8.)
1.e. November 2011  Arrest for Assault by Battery and  Attempted  Sexual Contact
in violation  of  Articles  128  and  120,  respectively, of the  UCMJ. After a night of drinking
alcohol  at  a  bar  in  November  2011,  Applicant  returned  to  the  Academy  campus  with
friends from the Academy, including a former classmate (FC) who had passed out in the
bathroom  of  the  bar.  FC  had  no  memory  of  what  happened  after  she  passed  out.
Applicant and his friends carried FC to a dormitory room. The classmates left Applicant
and  FC  alone  in  the  room,  and  he  locked  the  door.  The  classmates  returned  and
demanded  that Applicant open  the  door. An  altercation  ensued  between  the  classmates
and  Applicant when  the  classmates found  the  lights were  off  in the  room. The  classmates
found   FC   unresponsive  with   her jeans   unbuttoned   unzipped   and  her shirt  pulled   up   to
chest  level.  An  ambulance  was  called,  and  FC  was taken  to  a  hospital. In  the  investigation
of the  incident, Applicant denied  that he  touched  FC, but claimed he was too  intoxicated
to   be   certain.  He   admitted   that  he   kissed   her  earlier  in  the   evening   while   she   was
incoherent.  His overall  version  of the  events  that  evening  developed  in  the  investigation
significantly   differed   in   critical  details  from   the   appellate   court’s  recitation   of  the   facts
developed  at the  court-martial. At one  point, Applicant  provided  a  statement in which  he
acknowledged   getting   into   bed   with   FC,   who   was   passed   out.   He   commented   that   “I
strongly  believe   its   possible”  that  he   unbuttoned   FC’s  jeans,  “but  I   am   not  100%  sure
because I cannot recall those events.” At the  DOHA hearing, Applicant denied he kissed
FC   and   he   otherwise  did  not  recall   what  he   did  with   FC   that  evening.   Applicant  was
charged  and  convicted  of  punching  both  classmates and  choking  one of them.  Applicant
was  also   charged   with   and   convicted   of   unwanted   sexual   conduct  with   FC,  including
kissing  her when  she  was incoherent. His convictions under  UCMJ Articles 80  and  128
were  upheld  on  appeal. See  SOR ¶ 1.c,  infra. (Tr. at 17-20, 41-45,  50-51;  GE  6  at  1-2;
GE 7  at 2; GE 8  at 2, 3.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline  D, Sexual Behavior)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the two allegations under this
guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to the matters
alleged in paragraph 2 of the SOR:
2.a.  The  SOR  cross  alleges  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.e  under  Guideline  D  in  this
subparagraph.
2.b.  Current  registration  as  a  Sex  Offender in  State  1.  Applicant was required to
register as a Sex Offender as a result of his court-martial convictions. He registered in
State 1 on June 22, 2012, and his registration requirement expires on June 22, 2027. He
claimed at the hearing that, due to a change in the laws of State 1, he was eligible to have
his name removed from the registration list at that time.  (Tr. at 25, 57; GE 3 at 7.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the two allegations under this
guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to the matters
alleged in paragraph 3 of the SOR:
3.a. Alcohol Consumption during  the  period  October 2011 to at least March 2019.
All of Applicant’s criminal conduct alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR was preceded by
his  significant  use  of  alcohol  resulting  in  his  intoxication.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant
admitted that he, at times, consumed alcohol in excess during the period alleged, but not
during the entire period. (Tr. at 25-26, 50.)
3.b. April 2019  Alcohol  Counseling. Applicant testified that he was ordered, by the
court  in  the  criminal  case  arising  from  his  March  2019  arrest,  to  abstain  from  drinking
alcohol for 90 days. He stated that he complied with this court order. Applicant claimed
that  his  participation  in  the  counseling  class  was  voluntary  and  that  he  completed  the
counseling. In a letter addressed to Applicant’s criminal defense attorney, dated April 29,
2019, the alcohol counselor wrote that Applicant “appeared to accept responsibility for his
behavior [on the day of his March 2019 arrest.]” The counselor noted that Applicant had
decided  to  abstain  from  any  further  use  of  alcohol  effective  the  night  of  his  arrest.
Applicant attended four individual counseling sessions. This letter was submitted to the
court.  At  the  DOHA  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  no  longer drinks  alcohol to  the
extent he used to drink before his 2019 arrest. He refined his comment about his drinking
habits to say that he only consumes alcohol on rare occasions, such as at a wedding.
(Answer at 6; Tr. at 26-27, 33-34, 56; AE A.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the single allegation under this
guideline.  The  SOR  cross  alleges  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.e  under  Guideline  E  in  this
paragraph.
Mitigation and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant provided extensive evidence in mitigation and in support of a favorable
whole-person  assessment.  I  have  carefully  reviewed  all  of  the  evidence  and  note  the
following specific items:
Applicant provided a written statement of his intent to  modify his drinking habits
and attend counseling.  He also  wrote that he  understood  that any inappropriate future
involvement  with  alcohol  may  be  grounds  for  the  revocation  of  his  national  security
eligibility, if granted to him. Applicant provided no evidence of any alcohol counseling or
treatment subsequent to the four sessions in March and April 2019.
In addition, Applicant provided six character-reference letters. A former classmate
at  the  Academy  wrote  a  letter  prior  to  Applicant’s  2019  arrest  praising  Applicant’s
“determination and perseverance  to  reach  his  goal of  becoming  an  engineer.”  He also
wrote that he has been impressed by Applicant’s “unwavering devotion to overcoming his
past.” In an undated letter, Applicant’s former girlfriend praised his character and “ability
to be respectful.” She commented that Applicant “did not allow his past to determine who
he is, and it is not an accurate reflection of what he will be in life.” A friend of ten years
wrote that Applicant is passionate and determined to reach his goals. Applicant’s fiancée
wrote  two  letters  that  were  submitted  into  the  record.  In  her  most  recent  letter,  she
commented that the couple recently purchased a home.  She wrote  that Applicant  was
completely  transparent  before  they  began  their  dating  relationship  about  his  past
problems that are the subject of the SOR allegations. She also confirmed that Applicant
no  longer  abuses  alcohol.  She  describes  Applicant  as  “a  respected  member  of  his
community,  both  personally  and  professionally.”  A  longtime  close  friend  also  praised
Applicant’s  outgoing  personality  and  willingness  to  help  others.  This  friend  also
commented on Applicant’s perseverance.  (AE F at 3-5; AE S; AE BB at 1-3.)
Applicant also submitted a lengthy letter from a licensed clinical social worker (the
LCSW), who described the incidents leading up to Applicant’s court-martial and provided
her  analysis  of  Applicant’s  qualifications  under  the  adjudicative  guidelines  for  Alcohol
Consumption  and  Sexual Behavior.  Her recitation of  the  facts  was sometimes  at odds
with the facts set forth in the official records submitted by the Government. Her version of
the  facts  was generally  quite  favorable  to  Applicant,  minimizing  the  seriousness of  his
actions.  Applicant  specifically  denied  to  the  LCSW  that  he  had  ever  “engaged  in  any
sexual assault.” Also, he only reported to the LCSW one incident at the Academy and
advised her that he had  “blacked  out” after excessive alcohol consumption and did not
recall the details of the incident, which occurred in November 2011 and is the basis for
the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.e. The LCSW wrote in her letter that despite his court-martial
conviction and the adverse decision on appeal, Applicant still maintains that he is innocent
of all of the charges. She wrote that the accusations against him were “unfounded.” She
explained in another part of her letter that Applicant believes he was set up by a classmate
who was acting as a confidential informant. The LCSW concluded that despite Applicant’s
history,  he  has  “no  probability  of  sexual  addiction”  or  “alcohol  use  disorder.”  He  also
denied to the LCSW that he assaulted the Driver in 2019. (AE P at 3-8.)
The LCSW also reported that according to Applicant he has never engaged in any
habitual or binge consumption of alcohol. He advised the LCSW that, as of the date of his
November 2021 interview with her, he drinks alcohol two to four times a month and drinks
three to four drinks when he does consume alcohol. (AE P at 5, 8.)
Applicant also submitted evidence of his community involvement, specifically with
an orphanage founded by his parents in the country of his birth.  He is a member of the
Board and assists with fundraising, among other activities. (AE H, AE Y, AE Z.)
",True
"Applicant  admitted   all   allegations  contained   in   the   SOR.   (¶¶   1.a,  1.b,  and   2.a.)
Applicant’s admissions  are accepted  as findings of  fact.  Additional findings  follow.  (SOR
response)
Applicant is 27 years old. He earned a high school equivalency diploma in 2014.
He never married, and he has one six-year-old son. In February 2022, he was hired by a
DOD contractor as a security officer. In September 2023, he left that employment to work
as  a  security  officer  for  another  DOD  contractor.  He  is  required  to  possess  a  security
clearance to perform specific job duties for his employer. (Tr. 17-18; GE 1)
Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct:
In  December  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while
intoxicated (DWI). He pled guilty to driving while ability impaired by alcohol (DWAI), and
he was sentenced to complete an alcohol education program, was fined, and his driver’s
license was suspended for 90 days. (SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant explained that on that occasion
he had consumed about five mixed drinks. He was driven to a friend’s house  where he
stayed overnight and slept on the couch. The next morning, he was driving home when
he hit a patch of ice and the car slid into the front yard of a residence. The homeowners
called  the  police.  The  police  gave  him  a  breathalyzer  test  and  his  results  registered
0.14%, which was above the legal limit, and he was arrested. (Tr. 19-21, 29-30; GE 1,
GE 2, GE 4)
In December 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony DWI, driving
on shoulder, lane violation, unlicensed driver, aggravated unlicensed operator, and failure
to keep right. All charges were dismissed except for the DWI charge. He pled guilty to a
misdemeanor  charge  of  DWI,  and  he  was  required  to  undergo  a  substance  abuse
evaluation,  perform  60  hours  of  community  service,  and  pay  a  fine.  He  was  also
sentenced to three years of probation that will end in September 2025. (SOR ¶ 1.b) Both
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were cross-alleged under Guideline J. (SOR ¶ 2.a) (Tr. 21-27; GE 1,
GE 2, GE 3)
Regarding the December 2021 incident, Applicant testified that he had consumed
approximately four glasses of wine and believed he was fully capable of driving himself
home. He was crossing over the lanes on the two-lane road and was pulled over by police.
His breathalyzer test registered 0.12%. He was not required to participate in an alcohol
treatment program, but he does have to submit to alcohol screenings when he reports to
his  probation  officer,  and  he  could  get  a  random  alcohol  screen  test  at  his  home.  His
driver’s  license  was  revoked  for  18  months.  He  has  complied  with  his  sentence
requirements, and he expects that he may be released early from probation in April 2025.
His attendance for reporting to his probation officer is perfect, and his alcohol screenings
have all been negative. He is required to remain abstinent from alcohol while serving on
probation. Applicant stated he would be willing to submit supporting documentation while
the record was held open, but he did not do so. (Tr. 21-27, 32)
Applicant testified that he has not consumed any alcohol for approximately the last
year-and-a-half.  He  stays  focused  on  work  and  stays  busy.  During  his  April  2022
background interview, he told the authorized DOD investigator that it would take four or
five  mixed  drinks  to  get  intoxicated,  and  he  would  get  intoxicated  one  or  two  times  a
month. After his second alcohol-related arrest, he changed his drinking pattern. He was
currently  drinking  once  a  month  at  home,  and  he  would  only  drink  two  alcoholic
beverages.  During  the  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  he  would  only  drink  alcohol  for
special  occasions  during  the  time  following  his  arrest  and  court  disposition,  such  as
holidays  and  birthdays.  After  he  was  placed  on  probation  in  September  2022,  he  has
maintained full sobriety. (Tr. 25-27; 31-34)

In  about  May  2004,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence  of  alcohol  (DUI)  in  State  A  after drinking  at  a  friend’s  house  and  deciding  to
drive  home.  He  was  arrested  at  about  3:00  a.m.  after  police  pulled  him  over  for
speeding. He was convicted of DUI. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, which were all
suspended. His driver’s license was suspended for a year. He claimed that, at that time,
he  associated  with  a  group  of  sailors  who  drank  a  lot  and  enjoyed  going  to  bars  and
clubs.  He  claimed  that  he  no  longer  associates  with  that  group  of  people.  He  was

a.m.  He had too  much  to drink after going to several bars over the course of an evening,
yet he  decided  to drive  home.  Police  administered  him  a  breathalyzer test  and  the  result
indicated that he  had a  0.17  percent  blood  alcohol  content (BAC).  He  pleaded  guilty to  a
lesser  DUI  offense   and   served   10   days   in  jail.   He  was  placed   on   probation   until 2013
and   his  license   was   suspended   for  a   year.   His  command   gave   him   a   Captain’s   Mast

completed an outpatient substance abuse program from September 2009 until January
2010 and attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings intermittently from September
2009  until  September  2012.  While  he  claimed  that  he  was  never  told  to  abstain  from

In  about 2014, Applicant began  consuming  alcohol again.  He claimed  he  would
have  a  drink or two  at lunch  or  dinner. He  claimed  he  drank  about  six  to  eight beers per
month.   During   an   August  2015   interview  with   a   DOD  investigator,  Applicant  told  the
investigator that he  had  modified  his drinking  habits  by no  longer drinking  to  the  point of
intoxication,  and  he  no  longer associated  with  the  same  crowd  who  liked  to  go  out and
party.   He   also   told  the   investigator  that   he   did   not   foresee   having   additional  DUIs.
However,  in  June  2021, he  was arrested  in State  B  and  charged  with  DUI,  .16  (percent)
or higher.  Earlier that night,  after working  late,  he  had  about five  drinks over three-and-
a-half hours with  dinner. Afterwards,  he  drove  to  a  karaoke  bar and  drank  more  there.
Despite  drinking  too  much, he  left  the  karaoke  bar at about 3:30  a.m. to  drive  home, but
police  pulled  him  over  for  driving  erratically,  speeding,  and  failing  to  use  his  turn  signal.
He failed  a  field sobriety test  and  was given  a  breathalyzer. His breathalyzer test result
indicated  that he  had  a  0.16  percent  BAC. The  DUI charges  were  ultimately dismissed
for  an   alleged   lack  of   evidence,   but  he   pleaded   guilty  to   a   lesser  charge   of   careless
driving.  He was required  to  pay a $400 fine.  (Tr. 32-35, 61-65;  Answer;  GE  3-6)
Applicant  claimed  that  after  his  June  2021  arrest,  he  had  a  “reset,”  but  he  still
consumes  alcohol  and  has  a  drink  or  two  with  dinner.  He  testified  that  he  still  drives
after consuming alcohol,  but he does not drive  if he has had more than  one drink.  He
claimed that  if he  has had more  than  one drink,  his wife  drives  home from dinner.  He
testified that he has not driven while intoxicated since June 2021 and that was the only
time  he  did  so  in  the  last  10  years.  He  claimed  that  his  social  circle  now  consists  of
mostly  extended  family  who  are  not  big  drinkers  or bargoers.  He  also  claimed  that  he
drinks  less  because  he  has  health  issues  that  are  exacerbated  by  drinking  too  much
alcohol, he wants to keep his job, and he wants to have a healthy retirement. (Tr. 32-36,
38-40, 66-69; Answer; GE 6)
Applicant  claimed  he  has  not  been  diagnosed  as  alcohol  dependent  or  as  an
alcoholic.  Applicant  claimed  that  no  alcohol  counselor  or  medical  professional  has
advised him to stop drinking. On October 24, 2023, Applicant had a consultation with a
counselor  who  holds  a  master’s  degree  in  counseling  education  and  is  a  licensed
professional  counselor.  After  this  consultation,  the  counselor  diagnosed  Applicant  with
Alcohol Use, Mild, in sustained remission. He then underwent at least one other session
with the same counselor. The counselor made no recommendation regarding Applicant
abstaining from alcohol. (Tr. 31, 75-76; AE C)
While  he  was  in  the  Navy,  Applicant  earned  the  Meritorious  Service  Award,
which he claimed is not normally awarded to an enlisted servicemember. He deployed
to a combat zone for about ten months beginning in October 2007. He retired from the
Navy  as  an  E-8,  which  is  the  second  highest  enlisted  pay  grade  available.  He  has
received  praise  from  his  supervisors  and  customers  regarding  his  work  performance.
His  colleagues,  friends,  and  family  have  written  character-reference  letters  advocating
that  he  be  awarded  a  security  clearance  and  attesting  to  his  good  character,
trustworthiness, reliability, and patriotism. His spouse also wrote that she does not think
he has a problem with alcohol and that he is merely a social drinker. In contravention of
Applicant’s  testimony,  she  claimed  that  he  does  not  drive  after  he  has  been  drinking.
(Tr. 24-25, 36-37; Answer; AE A, B)
",False
"In   Applicant’s  answers   to   the   SOR  and   the   amended   SOR,  he   admitted   all   the
allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March
1996  to  April  2019  when  he  was  involuntarily  retired  with  a  general  discharge  under
honorable conditions. He was a senior chief petty officer (pay grade E-8) when he retired.
He held a security clearance during his military service.
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  April  to  August  2019.  He  worked  for  federal
contractors from August 2019 to July 2023. The record does not reflect the circumstances
of his termination from employment in July 2023. At the time of the hearing, he had been
offered a job by another defense contractor, contingent on favorable adjudication of his
application to continue his security clearance. (Tr. 18)
Applicant married in April 2000 and has two daughters, ages 22 and 18. He and
his wife have lived separately since December 2021, but they are not legally separated.
(Tr. 14-15) He attended college from July to September 2008 but did not receive a degree.
(GX 1 at 10-11; Tr. 15-16)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to
the point of intoxication, from about May 2017 to at least January 2022. Applicant admitted
this allegation in his answer to the SOR. At the hearing, he testified that he was drinking
every night during this period and that he was “getting close” to drinking every night to the
point of intoxication. (Tr. 25).
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of
an  incident  that  led  to  nonjudicial  punishment  for  sexual  assault  in  February  2018,  an
incident leading to a charge of assault and battery on a family member in August 2020,
and an incident leading to a charge of assault and battery on a family member in October
2021. These allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions in his answer to the
SOR.
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  for  abusive  sexual  contact  in
October  2017  and  that  the  arrest  occurred  in  the  United  States.  Although  Applicant
admitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR, I doubt that he fully understood what
he was admitting, because when he was asked at the hearing to describe what happened,
he described the sexual assault alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b, which occurred in May 2017, while
he was assigned overseas. (Tr. 19) The FBI arrest record reflects an arrest that occurred
in the United States in October 2017, but it does not list the offense that was the basis for
the arrest. (GX 3) There is no documentary evidence in the record reflecting the basis for
this arrest. I conclude that the part of SOR ¶ 2.a that alleges an arrest is established, but
the part alleging that the arrest was for abusive sexual contact is not established by his
admissions in his answer to the SOR or any evidence in the record.
SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  that  Applicant  received  nonjudicial  punishment  in  February
2018 for sexual assault in violation of Article 120, Uniform Code of Military Justice. The
assault occurred in May 2017. Applicant and group of fellow sailors were at a party, and
Applicant was intoxicated. He came up from behind a female sailor, hugged her, touched
her breast, and asked her if she would go to bed with him. Applicant appeared before his
commanding  officer,  was  found  guilty  of  a  sexual  assault,  and  received  nonjudicial
punishment  of  a  forfeiture  of  $2,618  of  his pay.  In  March  2018,  he  was  referred  to  an
administrative separation board, which determined that he should be retained in the Navy.
Shortly after Applicant was punished, he was transferred to another command. In
March 2019, he was notified that he was required to retire. He retired in April 2019 and
received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  (AX  A)  The  Certificate  of
Release  or  Discharge  from  Active  Duty  (DD  Form  214)  recites  that  the  reason  for
separation was “sufficient service for retirement.” (AX A) The DD Form 214 reflects that
during  his  military  service,  he  received  the  Good  Conduct  Medal  (six  awards),
Outstanding Military Volunteer Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal
(three  awards),  the  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  Commendation  Medal,  two  letters  of
appreciation  and  commendation,  and  various  service  medals  and  qualification  badges
and ribbons.
Applicant testified that his marital problems began after his retirement. While on
active duty, he was deployed frequently, and it was not until he was at home for a while
that he realized that his wife and a neighbor were drinking heavily and using drugs during
the  day.  He  believed  that  they  had  been  drinking  and  using  drugs  for  a  couple  years
before his retirement. (Tr. 40)
Applicant  attributed   all  the   domestic  violence   incidents   to   his  heavy  drinking,
followed  by  arguments  with  his wife.  He  testified  that  the  incident alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.c
occurred  in  August 2020, when  he  was working  nights and   came  home  at  about  11:30
pm. He  testified  that his wife  and  her friend  had  been  “getting  wasted  all  day.” He started
drinking  and  began  arguing  with  his wife. His wife  claimed  that  he  pushed  her, and  he
claimed  that he  pushed  her away when  she  was screaming  “in  his face.” His wife  called
the police, and  they  told  him, “they got to  take  somebody,” and  he  was arrested. (Tr. 26-
27)
The domestic incident in October 2021, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, was another instance
of heavy drinking, arguing, and fighting. Applicant’s wife accused him of throwing a beer
can at her. Applicant’s daughter called the police, and they arrested Applicant for assault
and  battery on  a  family  member. (Tr.  29) At  a  court hearing  a  couple  of  months  later,
adjudication was deferred, conditioned on good behavior for two years. (Tr. 30)
Applicant testified that he stopped drinking heavily after he and his wife separated.
He testified that he now limits himself to a couple beers while watching football and no
longer drinks hard liquor. He has not received any formal counseling or treatment for his
alcohol consumption. He is not involved with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or any similar
organization. (Tr. 33-34, 42)

From 2009 to 2011, Applicant was deployed to Iraq. (Tr1. 41; GE 1 at 15) He was
responsible for training Iraqis on traffic control points. (Tr1. 42-43) He was traumatized by
the effects of his order to shoot at a vehicle, which caused the death of a girl’s father and
two other men. (Tr1. 45; GE 5 at 11) The vehicle contained firearms; however, the girl
inside the vehicle witnessed the death of her father. (Tr1. 45) The girl was distraught but
not physically harmed. (Tr1. 45) After the incident, he was transferred to Baghdad where
he worked in resource management. (Tr1. 46)
Applicant went to Tajikistan to assist the Tajiks with drug interdiction. (Tr1. 46-47)
He was robbed, beaten, and left unconscious in the woods. (Tr1. 47) He woke up after
about  seven hours  in the  woods, and he walked back to his hotel. (Tr1.  48) He had a

Psychological Conditions  and Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that  in about November 2006, Applicant was diagnosed with
PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and Alcohol Dependence. He received alcohol detoxification
from a clinic. In 2002, he drank excessively when his first marriage ended. (Tr1. 105, 108;
GE 5 at 11) He was feeling nervous and anxious after his deployment to Egypt, and he
decided to discuss it with a mental-health counselor. (Tr1. 64-65, 103) He was diagnosed
with PTSD. (Tr1. 63) He was prescribed Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, Decampere, anti-
alcohol, and Trazodone to help him sleep. (Tr1. 65-66) He also received psychotherapy
for  three  to  ten  days.  (Tr1.  66)  He  frequently  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings in  the 2004 to  2006 timeframe. (Tr1.  67, 105,  109) Both of  his parents  were
alcoholics, and he indicated he may have a genetic predisposition towards alcoholism.
(Tr1. 104) After each alcohol treatment, he was “pretty much [told] don’t drink alcohol, go
to [AA] meetings.” (Tr1. 109)
SOR  ¶   1.b   alleges  that  in  about  2012,  Applicant  completed   alcohol-related
treatment,  and  in  2013, he  relapsed. He  attended  some  group  meetings at  a  clinic and
some  AA  meetings. (Tr1.  68) He believed  the  treatment he  was receiving  was ineffective
and  a  waste  of time. (Tr1.  69, 118) His marriage  fell  apart, and  he  lost  his job. (Tr1.  69-
70,  119)  These   factors  contributed   to   his  relapse.  (Tr1.   69)  He  used   alcohol  to   self-
medicate. (Tr1.  70)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that in about October 2013, Applicant received alcohol-related
treatment and completed detoxification at a clinic. The alcohol-related treatment was on
an outpatient basis, and he went every couple of weeks. (Tr1. 71, 120) He went to the
treatment primarily for medication management. (Tr1. 71) An April 23, 2014 VA progress
note  states  that  Appellant  said  he  had  a  relapse  in  October  2013.  (GE  5  at  11)  “The
incident  led  his  employer  to  require  him  to  complete  an  alcohol  rehabilitation  program
prior to returning to work. He completed [a program] and is currently active in Alcoholics
Anonymous.”  (Id.)  The  note  does  not  describe  “the  incident.”  The  April  23,  2014  VA
progress  note  states  Applicant  had  consumed  alcohol  before  his  VA  appointment  and
Applicant believed it was unsafe for him to drive home in his vehicle. (Id. at 16) The VA
called a cab, which took him from the VA to his residence. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that from November 20 to 25, 2013, Applicant received alcohol-
related inpatient treatment from a clinic, and he was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder
(moderate,  in  early  remission),  Major  Depressive  Disorder,  and  Cluster  B  personality
traits. Applicant agreed with the summary in SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr1. 73, 121; SOR response)
The  therapy  at  the  clinic  entailed  attending  classes  and  AA  meetings.  (Tr1.  74)  He
indicated  that  he  was sober for two  years in November 2013.  (Tr1.  121;  AE  M (check
cite)) A VA progress note states that Applicant had a significant relapse in October 2013,
and  “The  incident led  his employer to  require  him  to  complete  an  alcohol rehabilitation
program  prior to  returning  to  work.” (AE  H at 3  (VA  page  22)) The VA record said that
Applicant said:
He was required  to  go  to  alcohol rehabilitation  in October 2013, in  order to
keep  his job, and  he  returned  [to  work]  in January 2014. .  . .  The  veteran
denied  any legal problems or significant behavioral disturbances  other than
his excessive  drinking  that  led  his employer  to  require  that  he  complete  an
alcohol rehabilitation  program in October 2013  in order to  keep  his job. (AE
H at 2-3 (VA pages  21-22))
Applicant  denied  that  his employer required  him  to  attend  alcohol rehabilitation  to  retain
his employment. (Tr1. 147-148) After he was confronted  with  the  progress note, he said,
“Yes, and I  don’t, I  don't know where  that’s coming  from. It says [he] had  to go to alcohol
rehab  in order to  keep  his job. I don’t  recall  that.  I don’t  know where that's from.” (Tr1.
150) He denied  that he  ever lost his job  due  to  drinking.  (Tr1. 122) He said,  “I didn’t lose
my job. I never,  I never lost  my job.” (Tr. 122-123) He said  he  lost  his job  because  the
contract ended and was not rebid. (Tr1. 123)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  from  November  25,  2013,  to  about  January  1,  2014,
Applicant received 37 days of residential treatment for Anxiety, PTSD, and Depression at
a clinic. Applicant agreed with the summary in SOR ¶ 1.e. (Tr1. 74; SOR response) He
successfully completed the treatment program. (Tr1. 123)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that from about January 10, 2014, to about January 14, 2014,
Applicant  received  Alcohol  Detox  treatment  at  a  VA  medical  center.  He  did  not  recall
whether he had a relapse after leaving the clinic on January 1, 2014. (Tr1. 75) He did not
remember whether there was a triggering event for his relapse. (Tr1. 123) The treatment
in January 2014 may have been for aftercare rather than detox. (Tr1. 75)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that from about March 3, 2014, to about May 2014, Applicant
received treatment at a VA hospital for PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder (Recurring with
Moderate  Severity),  Alcohol  Use  Disorder  (Severe),  and  Mild  Neurocognitive  Disorder
related to TBI. Applicant sought treatment at the VA hospital because “everything kind of
started  falling  apart.”  (Tr1.  76)  He  remembered  being  at  the  VA  hospital;  however, he
could not remember too much about what occurred there. (Tr1. 77) VA treatment records
for May 2014 indicate he was drinking 12-18 beers a day. (GE 5 at 15-16; AE P at 7) He
had attended rehabilitation for alcohol on five previous occasions. (AE P at 7) Before his
11 am appointment on May 8, 2014, he had consumed three beers. (GE 5 at 16; AE P at
12)
On  August  23,  2014,  Applicant’s  insurance  company  called  the  police  and
informed  them  that  Applicant  was  at  his  residence;  he  was  suffering  from  alcohol
poisoning; and the caller requested a welfare check. (GE 3 at 31-32) The police entered
his  residence  and  observed  garbage,  beer  cans,  and  fecal  matter  strewn  about  his
residence. (Id.) Applicant was transported to a VA medical center. (Id.) This incident is
not listed in the SOR, and it will not be considered for disqualification purposes.
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges that from about December 16, 2014, to about December 24,
2017, Applicant received treatment from the VA for Alcohol Use Disorder, and he received
alcohol detoxification. He failed to follow treatment advice to refrain from alcohol use.
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that from about  February 2017 to about May 2017, Applicant
received  inpatient  hospitalization  at  a  VA  hospital  for  PTSD.  Applicant  believed  the
treatment he  received  in  2017  was  the  most  effective.  (Tr1.  77-78)  The  facility focused  on
PTSD and  mindfulness. (Tr1.  78) He  also  received  medication  management.  (Tr1.  78)  He
attended  AA  meetings at night.  (Tr1.  78) He finally accepted  that he  was an  alcoholic and
he  needed  to  take  sobriety one  day at a  time.  (Tr1.  79, 98) A  March  29, 2017, VA  Disability
Benefits  Questionnaire   states,  “Alcohol  is  drug   of  choice.   Became   a   problem   in  2005
when   he   returned   from   Egypt.   Has  had   periods  of   abstinence   over  the   years: one   [to]
three  years but a  lot  of roller coaster. Currently has been  abstinent since  2  January 2017.”
(AE Q at 98)
SOR ¶  1.j  alleges that on  March  18, 2021,  a  licensed  psychologist,  Dr. B,  evaluated
Applicant’s mental health  at   the  request of   security officials. Dr. B   diagnosed  Applicant
with   PTSD,  Major  Depressive  Disorder  (Moderate,  Recurrent),  Generalized   Anxiety
Disorder, and  Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe).  (GE 4 at 7) Dr. B is a  clinical psychologist.
(GE  4   at   7)   Applicant   said   he   remembered   taking   a   test   on-line;   however,   he   did  not
remember Dr. B’s interview of him.  (Tr1.  80-81)  He said  he  was “a  little guarded” during
the  interview because  he  “didn’t know what  this was about” and,  he  “didn’t know that [he]
had  to  fight to keep [his] clearance  again.” (Tr1.  81) He denied that he lied to Dr. B. (Tr1.
82) Dr. B  noted  that Applicant told another evaluator that in  2016  his last  drink was in
2016; however,  he  told  Dr. B  that  his last drink was in  2014.  (Tr1.  82) Applicant said he
did not “recall  that.” (Tr1.  82)  He was  upset when  he  read  Dr. B’s report because  of  the
comments about his lack of candor. (Tr1. 153-154)
Dr.  B  noted  that  Applicant  “maintained  the  belief  that  he  had  a  brief  bout  of
substance  abuse  treatment at the  VA  in 2014  and that he has been  sober ever since.”
(GE  4  at  6)  He  relapsed  after  2014.  (Id.)  He  omitted  disclosure  of  alcohol-related
treatment from February to May 2017 at a VA facility. (Id. at 4, 6) She indicated Applicant
“has  a  history  of  underreporting  and  withholding  information.  His  tendency  to  omit
pertinent  details  of  his  behavioral  health  history  may  have  [led]  previous  evaluators  to
formulate  inaccurate  conclusions.”  (Id.)  Dr.  B  concluded  that  it  would  be  imprudent  to
grant Applicant access to classified information, and stated:
[Applicant]  is clearly  a  troubled  man  who  has been  using  alcohol  to  cope
with  severe mental  health  symptoms  for many years. While  his history of
inpatient  care  and  multiple responses is  problematic,  his  poor insight and
candor  issues  are  of  greatest  concern.   The   degree   to   which   he   withheld
information  throughout  the  security vetting  process (2016  to  present) was
indicative  of  intentional  concealment, which  brings his  overall  credibility into
question. (GE 4  at  7)
At his hearing, Applicant said his last drink of alcohol was on November 3, 2017,
and  he  has  been  sober  for  almost  six  years.  (Tr1.  82,  89)  He  remembered  the  date
because he had completed Step Four with his sponsor. (Tr1. 79, 83) He listed the dates,
times, and group names for his attendance at AA meetings in June and July 2021. (GE 2
at 74) He speaks to his AA sponsor about every day. (Tr1. 83) His sponsor did not want
to be involved in Applicant’s security clearance hearing because he had some issues with
law enforcement, and AA is anonymous. (Tr1. 83)
Applicant attends AA meetings three or four days a week. (Tr1. 90) He contacts
his sponsor if he has a craving for alcohol. (Tr1. 91) He has a stable home life, and he is
more mature. (Tr1. 90) He joined a church a few months before his hearing. (Tr1. 93) His
PTSD is less significant in his life now that he has retired from the Army. (Tr1. 93) He
regularly  sees  a  VA  counselor,  and  he  plans  to  call  the  VA  crisis  line  if  his  PTSD  is
becoming difficult for him to control. (Tr1. 94) He has the tools to maintain his sobriety.
(Tr1. 90)
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges from about 2002 to at least 2017, Applicant consumed alcohol
to excess and to the point of intoxication. Applicant said he began drinking heavily in 2003
or 2004. (Tr1. 50) Before he deployed, he drank as “a way to cope.” (Tr1. 51) After his
deployment, he drank as a way to self-medicate. (Tr1. 51) Alcohol helped him to relax.
(Tr1.  51)  After  he  returned  from  Egypt,  his  drinking  increased.  (Tr1.  52)  He  said  he
stopped drinking alcohol in 2017. (Tr1. 53) He received assistance from AA. (Tr1. 53-54)
Between  2014  and  2017,  he  did  “not  consciously”  consume  excessive  amounts  of
alcohol. (Tr1. 132) After 2017, he went to AA meetings. (Tr1. 133)
SOR  ¶   2.b   alleges  in   about   September  30,   2014,   Applicant  was   arrested   and
charged   with   driving   under  the   influence   of  alcohol  (DUI).  Applicant  bumped   a   parked
vehicle  when  he  was  parking  his vehicle. (Tr1.  56,  127-130; GE  3  at  23) The  damage  to
the   other  vehicle   was  not  extensive,   and   no   one   was  injured.  (Tr1.   58-59)  The   police
arrived,  and   Applicant   failed   a   field  sobriety  test.   (Tr1.   56;  GE   3   at   27)  Applicant’s
breathalyzer  result  was  .085.   (Tr1.   57,   128;   GE   3   at  28)  He   was   arrested   for  reckless
driving  and  Operating  Motor Vehicle  Under the  Influence  (DUI). (GE  3  at 26, 28) At his
security clearance  hearing  he  said unaware  when  he  was charged  that he  was charged
with  DUI.  (Tr1. 130) He pleaded  guilty to,  and  he  was convicted  of,  reckless driving. (Tr1.
58) He was not prosecuted for DUI. (Tr1.  59)
SOR  ¶  2.c  alleges  in  about  October  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged
with DUI. Applicant hit the back corner of an unoccupied vehicle, which was parked near
his residence. (Tr1. 59, 62; GE 3 at 8) Applicant drove a short distance away and parked
his  vehicle  at  his  residence.  (Id.)  The  same  police  officer  who  was  involved  in  his
September 2014 DUI arrest arrived and assumed he had been drinking. (Tr1. 60; GE 3
at 14) Applicant had not consumed any alcohol prior to the accident. (Tr1. 62) The police
searched his vehicle and found a BB or pellet imitation firearm in the back of his vehicle.
(Tr1. 60, 131; GE 3 at 11, 12) His breathalyzer result was 0.00. (Tr1. 62; GE 3 at 14) He
also provided a urine sample for testing. (GE 3 at 12, 15, 17) Applicant denied that he
was  aware that he  was  being arrested for DUI.  (Tr1.  131)  Applicant  was charged with
Unlawful  Possession  of  an  Imitation  Firearm,  Leaving  the  Scene  of  an  Accident,
Operating a Motor Vehicle Under the Influence; and Operating an Unregistered Vehicle.
(GE 3 at 11) He believed he was arrested for possession of an illegal firearm. (Tr1. 131)
He  found  out  he  was charged  with  DUI  and  possession  of  an  illegal  firearm  when  the
charges were sent. (Tr1. 62, 132) He was convicted of reckless driving, and he received
a $158 fine. (Tr1. 60)
SOR ¶ 2.d cross alleges under the alcohol consumption guideline, the information
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j, which are alleged under the psychological conditions guideline.
Applicant  denied that he had  ever been terminated from his employment because
of  drinking.  (Tr1.  139)  However,  a   May  8,  2014   progress  note   states  “Veteran   called
directly [his]  case  manager reporting  to  have  recently been  fired  from  his job  and  abuses
alcohol drinking  12-18  beers a day.”  (Tr1. 140; GE 5 at 16)  At his hearing, he said he  did
not  “recall  ever saying” that he  had  been  fired. (Tr1.  141) He  suggested  his  memory in
2014  may have  been  affected  by his alcohol  consumption  and  TBI.  (Tr1. 142) However,
he did not believe  his TBI affected his ability to perform  his job today. (Tr1.  142)
Dr. G’s  Evaluation
Dr. G is a VA clinical psychologist. On July 27, 2021, Dr. G said Applicant has been
receiving VA treatment at his location since 2019. (GE 2 at 72) Dr. G diagnosed Applicant
with PTSD and Alcohol Abuse in Sustained Remission. (GE 2 at 72) Dr. G summarized
his current treatment and prognosis as follows:
He . .  . engaged  in  individual therapy from  July 2019  to  November  2020.
Individual therapy was  discontinued  because  he  had  successfully met all  of
his individual therapy treatment goals and  had  successfully developed  an
ongoing   recovery  plan.  He  currently  continues  to   be   seen   for medication
management,  through   our  clinic.  He  has  been   an   active   participant  in
treatment and  compliant with  treatment recommendations. In  regards to  his
treatment goals,  he  has made  significant progress in obtaining  his goals and
is currently maintaining those gains. (GE 2  at  72)
Dr. W’s Evaluation
On  July 20, 2023, Dr. W  provided  an  evaluation  of Applicant’s mental health. (AE
TT)  Dr. W  is a  clinical psychologist  who  focuses on  treatment of PTSD. (Tr1. 156, 163)
She  did  not review  Applicant’s medical  records because  she  did not  have  time. (Tr1.  164)
She  reviewed  Dr. B’s  report,  and  she  discussed  Dr.  B’s report with  Applicant.  (Tr1.  164-
165)  Applicant   had   26   sessions   with   Dr.  W   over  the   previous   5   ½   months.   (Id.)  She
diagnosed  him  with  PTSD. (Tr1. 157-158; AE  TT) She  said he  is dedicated  to  attendance
at AA  meetings. (Tr1. 159)  She  does not believe  Applicant has consumed  alcohol in the
last  six months.  (Tr1.  159) She  concurred  with   Dr. G, that   Applicant’s “alcoholism   is in
remission  and that he  has met all [of] his treatment goals and objectives.” (AE TT)
Dr. W  opined  that Applicant was  being  honest with  her about  his symptoms  and
mental-health  history. (Tr1. 160) Applicant has memory issues from  his PTSD. (Tr1. 166)
His  prognosis
is  good.  (Tr1.   160)  In   response   to   Applicant’s  question   about
recommendations to  ensure he  does not relapse  or his PTSD manifest does not itself in
a  negative  way,  Dr. W  said he  should receive psychotherapy  to  help with  the  traumatic
events he  experienced  in childhood  and  during  his military service. (Tr1. 161) In  her report
Dr. W said:
The  prognosis for [Applicant]  is very good,  given  his  willingness and  ability
to   comply   with   continued   aftercare.   Recovery  of  symptoms  is  possible.
Outcomes  for him  are  improved  with  continued  coping  skills and  symptom
awareness and  management.
[Applicant]   does  not  have   any  condition   that  calls  his  trustworthiness,
judgment,  or  reliability into  question. I believe  [Applicant]  has been  honest
with  me  about his  issues. We  discussed  in detail  his past alcohol abuse. He
appears  to   be   a   stable   and   well-adjusted   individual,   given   the   PTSD,
Anxiety, and  Depression  that he  has  suffered  in  the  past.  Other than  PTSD,
he does not exhibit other symptoms. (AE TT at 3)
Mr. B’s Comments
Mr. B is a VA outpatient clinical psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. (AE
VV) On July 5, 2023, Mr. B said, “To date, [Applicant] has been actively engaged in his
outlined treatment plan. He [is] compliant with medications and with all requests outlined
by this provider.” (AE VV) Mr. B did not provide a diagnosis or a prognosis.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c allege Applicant falsified material facts on his June 20,
questions.
“No,”
answered,
following
2016  SCA  when
the
he
to
(1) “Section  24-Use  of Alcohol Sought  Counseling  or Treatment Have  you  EVER
voluntarily sought counseling  or treatment as a  result of your use  of alcohol?” He  failed
to   disclose   the   information   in  SOR  ¶¶   1.a   through   1.h.   (GE  1   at  35)  In   the   Optional
Comment section  he  said,  “I attend  AA  meetings regularly. Spoke  with  a  VA  psychiatrist
in 2011 regarding alcohol use related to PTSD  issues.” (Tr1. 136; GE 1 at 35)
(2) and  (3) “Section  22-Police  Record-Summary In  the  past seven  (7) years have
you been charged, convicted, or sentenced  of a crime in any court?” Applicant disclosed
the  October 2014  vehicle accident and  arrest  for possession of an  imitation  firearm. (GE
1  at 31) He  said  the  offense  was downgraded  to  “Petty Disorderly Persons Offense,” and
he received  a $158 fine. (GE 1 at 31-32) He  did not disclose the DUI charges.
Applicant’s 2016  SCA  also asked,  “In  the  last seven  years  has  your use  of alcohol
had  a  negative  impact  on  your  work performance.  . . or resulted  in  intervention  by  law
enforcement/public  safety personnel?”  He   said, “No.”  (GE   1   at   35)  It asked,   “Have   you
EVER received  counseling  or treatment  as a  result of your use  of alcohol  in addition  to
what  you   have   already  listed   on   this  form?”  Applicant   said,  “No,”   and   in   the   Optional
Comment section said, “I attend AA  meetings regularly.” (GE 1 at 35)
Applicant  had previously completed  SCAs  during  his Army  career. (Tr1.  86) He
said when he was completing his 2016 SCA he did not remember all of the places he
attended for alcohol treatment or when he received treatment at the facilities. (Tr1. 84)
He said no because he did not want to provide the additional specific information which
would have been required to complete the SCA. (Tr1. 135-136) He expected he would be
meeting  with  an  investigator  in  about  30  days,  and  he  planned  to  disclose  his alcohol
treatment to the investigator. (Tr1. 84, 144) No one ever told him that it was okay to omit
information on the SCA and provide the information later to an investigator. (Tr1. 145)
Applicant believed when he was completing the SCA, if he answered, yes, then he
would not be able to proceed on the form without providing specific information. (Tr1. 85)
Also,  the  form  cannot  be  saved,  and  an  applicant  must  restart  the  form  if  it  is  not
completed. (Tr1. 85) However, he repeatedly indicated on his SCA “estimated” for dates,
(GE 1 at 9-13, 17-18, 21-26), and in other locations, he utilized the “Optional Comment”
function  to  indicate  “I  do  not  have  this  information”  or  “I  do  not  know  place  of  birth
information.” (GE 1 at 22)
Applicant denied that he was trying to hide or deceive security. (Tr1. 85, 87) He
signed a consent form or waiver to allow the investigator to obtain his treatment records.
(Tr1. 87) He said he disclosed the information missing from his SCA to the investigator.
(Tr1. 85) He said he thought he wrote on the form that he had alcohol issues, and he
would explain it to the investigator later. (Tr1. 145-146) He did not have any draft SCA
forms. (Tr1. 146) He did not remember ever being referred for alcohol counseling. (Tr1.
146-147) However, a treatment note indicates he was referred for alcohol treatment or
counseling. (Tr1. 147; AE H at 21) He said the treatment note was accurate except for
the part about having to go to alcohol treatment to keep his job. (Tr1. 150)
According to Applicant’s August 8, 2016 OPM personal subject interview (PSI), he
initially told the investigator that he stopped consuming alcohol in late 2014; however, he
said he most recently drank a beer in June 2016. (GE 2 at 18) He was asked three times
to  disclose  additional  alcohol-related  treatments,  and  he  denied  additional  treatments.
(Tr1. 137-138; GE 2 at 18) Then the investigator would name a particular treatment entity,
and Applicant would admit receiving alcohol-related treatment at that facility. (Tr1. 138;
GE  2  at  18)  He  attributed  his  failure  to  disclose  the  treatments  until  the  investigator
confronted  him  with  the  facts  to  his  lack  of  recollection  or  inability  to  remember  or
alternatively to oversight and not having the details available to him at the time he was
completing his SCA. (Tr1. 139; GE 2 at 18, 21)
Applicant  did  not  disclose  his  DUI  offense  because  he  was  only  convicted  of
reckless driving. (Tr1. 87) He  said, “Maybe  I  read  the  question  wrong  and  just  thought
charge meant the same thing as conviction. Are you a lawyer? No, I’m not.” (Tr1. 88) He
is aware that there would be police reports and court records, and those records would
be available to investigators. (Tr1. 89)
In his August 17, 2016 OPM PSI, Applicant disclosed the details of his two arrests
in September to October 2014 without being confronted with the facts. (GE 2 at 17) He
said he did not list the September 2014 arrest and the DUI component of the October
2014 arrest on his SCA due to oversight. (GE 2 at 17)
10
Applicant told Dr. B or the OPM investigator or both that he was sober from 2006
to 2011. (Tr1. 113; GE 2 at 17; GE 4 at 4) In March 2011, he returned from Iraq, locked
himself into a hotel room and drank 12 six packs of beer over several days. (Tr1. 114; GE
2 at 17-18; GE 5 at 11) He described himself as “a chronic relapse” from 2004 to 2011.
(Tr1. 115) He did not actually get sober until 2017. (Tr1. 117)
Applicant said  he  could  not afford  to  pay his mortgage  in  2014. (Tr1.  125) Applicant
said his mortgage  company foreclosed  on  his residence. (Tr1. 125) Department Counsel
raised  the  issue  of Applicant’s failure  to  disclose  the  foreclosure  of  his residence  on  his
2016  SCA.  (Tr1. 126) Applicant responded  that the  foreclosure was not in 2016; however,
he  did not remember when  it  occurred. (Tr1.  127) A  December 16,  2014  progress  note
states  that  Applicant  is  unable  to  pay  his mortgage  and  his house  is  in foreclosure.  (GE
6  at  12, 23) In  Section  26-Financial  Record  of his SCA,  Applicant disclosed  his delinquent
child  support debt,  and  in the  Optional  Comment section  he  said,  “My wife  and  I separated
in  2011.  Our divorce   was  final  in   2014.  In   2014,   I   faced   numerous   financial  difficulties
resulting  from  loss of income. I am  currently rectifying  many of those  issues.” (GE 1  at
39)  Applicant disclosed  sufficient information  on  his SCA about “financial difficulties” to
mitigate  concerns about his foreclosure not being  listed  on his SCA.  The  foreclosure will
not be further discussed in this decision.
In the additional comments at the end of his SCA, Applicant said:
Regarding  Alcohol Treatment:  In  2004,  I entered  Alcoholics Anonymous for
the  first time,  and  have  been  going  to  these  meeting  ever since. Please  note
that  I  have   never  been   reprimanded,  nor  fired   from   any  employment
regarding  my previous alcohol use. I am  currently a  lieutenant colonel in the
United  States Army Reserve and  have  never received  any sort of punitive
action   during   my
I  violated   my
responsibilities  in  maintaining   my  security  clearance-now  over  25   years
holding  a  security clearance. I am  a  trustworthy and  reliable candidate. (GE

Applicant provided a heartfelt and sincere closing statement:
Alcohol,   and   my  recovery  from   it,  has  been   brought  up   and   it’s  probably
going to be further brought up. You know, unfortunately for me, the  subject
of alcoholism and  my past issues [were] not high points in my life.
The toughest issue I  had to  experience was acceptance. And just basically
being  able to  finally admit to  myself and  say in an  AA  meeting. Hello  my
name is [Applicant]  and I’m  an  alcoholic.
I’ve  since  retired  from  military service, but I  continue  to  support the  Army in
my current employment.  I’m  very proud  of my  military service. But I‘m  also
very proud  of  the  work that I’m  currently doing  as a  Government  employee.
I am a devoted  patriot.  I’ve  spent my entire  life  working  and  supporting  this
country. And  I do  love  this country deeply. I am  very hopeful, I’m  hopeful for
a  future where I can  continue  to  contribute  and  continue  to  work in  a  role
that  I love.  I hope  that  you  will  take  that  in  consideration. Thank  you.   (Tr1.

"The SOR alleges Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUI) in May 2014 and arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in February 2020, and
that he pled guilty to both offenses. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) His DUI and DWI were cross-alleged
as criminal conduct under Guideline J. (SOR ¶ 2.a) In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he
admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b,  but  did  not  specifically  admit  or  deny  the
allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. During the hearing, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. (Answer; Tr. 7-8)
Applicant  is  a  42-year-old  aircraft  mechanic  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since May 2019. He was employed by a different defense contractor from October 2017
to  May 2019.  He  served  in the  United  States  Air Force  from October 2002 to October
2017 and was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant (E-5). He has served in the Air
Force Reserve or Air Guard since October 2017 and was promoted to master sergeant
(E-7) in July 2022. He has been awarded numerous awards and decorations including
the Air Force Achievement Medal (three oak leaf clusters) and Air Force Good Conduct
Medal (three oak leaf clusters). He successfully completed extensive military training and
education  and  has  made  multiple  overseas  deployments.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since 2003. (GE 1; AE A-B; Tr. 23-27, 48-52, 54-56)
Applicant received  an  associate  degree  in November 2012. He  has  taken  college
courses  since   September   2018   and   is  pursuing   a   degree   in  aviation   science
management.  He  was married  from  October 2002  to  May 2006, and  has one  child, age
20. (GE 1; AE  B: Tr. 25-26, 52-54)
In May 2014, Applicant was stopped by a local police officer after he was observed
erratically operating a vehicle. He failed a field sobriety test, and a breathalyzer registered
a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.152. He was arrested for DUI. He pled guilty in a state
court  and  was  placed  on  probation  for  six  months,  fined,  had  his  driver’s  license
suspended for 90 days, and had an ignition interlock device installed in his vehicle for six
months. He was required to complete an Air Force alcohol, drugs, and abuse prevention
treatment course, and received a letter of reprimand from his commander. (Answer; GE
1-2; AE B; Tr. 20-21, 28-38, 56-57)
Before his 2014 arrest, Applicant had consumed an unrecalled quantity of alcohol
in a bar. He was heartbroken after learning his prospective fiancé had been unfaithful to
him. He took a taxi home from the bar, but after arriving at his residence realized he had
lost his cellphone. He then made the admittedly poor decision to get into his truck and go
to look for his cellphone. He pulled onto a road in front of a police car and proceeded to
the left turn lane. When the left turn light turned green, he remained stationary for about
five seconds, and the police officer pulled him over. (Tr. 20-21, 28-38, 56-57; AE B)
In  February  2020,  Applicant  was  stopped  by  a  local  police  officer  after  he  was
observed driving the wrong way on an access road. He told the police officer that he was
not familiar with the area, had three or four drinks that night, and that he had stopped
drinking  60-90  minutes  before  being  pulled  over.  The  police  officer  attempted  to
administer  a  field  sobriety  test,  but  Applicant  disputed  some  procedures  and  did  not
perform parts of the test, so the officer interpreted his actions as a refusal. Applicant was
arrested for DWI. He was administered two breathalyzers and registered a blood-alcohol
content (BAC) of 0.147 and 0.150. In March 2021, a deferred adjudication was entered,
and the charges were dismissed pursuant to the deferred adjudication in May 2022. He
was fined $500 and had an ignition interlock device placed on his vehicle. He completed
a DWI driver education program in May 2020, a state-mandated online alcohol education
program in October 2020, and a 16-hour program in May 2022 that included counselling.
(Answer; GE 3-4; Tr. 21, 38-44, 58-59)
Applicant said he went out with friends for a few drinks and to reflect on his father’s
death. His friends wanted to go to a bar, and Applicant drove them. He consumed several
drinks over six or seven hours and said his last drink, a mixed drink, was stronger than
he had anticipated. After his DWI arrest, he refocused his life, disassociated himself from
friends who drank excessively and “party mode” environments. (Tr. 61) He abstained from
the  use  of  alcohol  from  February  2020  until  June  2022.  Since  June  2022  he  has
occasionally consumed one to three beers or seltzers at social events, said that he has
not been intoxicated, and no longer drinks hard liquor. He said he has not  driven after
consuming alcoholic beverages since February 2020 and has never been intoxicated at
work. (AE B; Tr. 21, 38-47, 58-62)
Character  letters  from  two  of  Applicant’s  former  supervisors  and  long-term
colleagues praised his work ethic, expertise, positive attitude, trustworthiness, honesty,
integrity, loyalty, judgment, character, and favorable security clearance history. (AE A at
3-5) A character letter from one former supervisor, an Air Force Major, noted his two DWIs
were out of character, that he was ashamed of his behavior, has owned up to his mistakes
and  worked  to  bounce  back.  (AE  A  at  3-4)  Character  letters  from  four  of  Applicant’s
colleagues  and  long-term  friends  commented  favorably  on  his  work  ethic,  leadership,
expertise,  loyalty,  trustworthiness,  compassion  for  others,  commitment  to  mission  and
country, suitability for a security clearance, remorse for his alcohol-related incidents, and
his  commitment  to  sobriety.  (AE  A  at  6-9)  Applicant’s  girlfriend  of  about  18  months,  a
government employee and former spouse of an alcoholic, wrote that he disclosed his two
DUIs  on  their  first  date  and  is  remorseful  for  his  actions,  does  not  consume  alcohol  if
driving, and consumes no more than two drinks during occasional social interactions. She
said he is responsible, has earned her trust, and always tries to take care of others. (AE

I  found  Applicant's  responses  and  demeanor  at  the  hearing  to  be  credible  and
consistent  with  someone  who  was  reliably  telling  the  truth.  After  reviewing  the  entire
record,  I  find  that  his  hearing  testimony  is  corroborated  by  documentary  evidence
submitted by the government and his own exhibits. He credibly responded to all questions
and  was  keenly  aware  of  the  significance  of  additional  alcohol-related  incidents  or
misconduct.

"Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about October 2016. His employer has promoted him twice.

In  about  March  2004,  when  Applicant  was  20  years  old,  he  was  arrested  and
charged  with  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI)  in  State  A  after  drinking  too  much  at  a
friend’s  house  and  deciding  to  drive  back  to  his  father’s  house.  He  was  arrested  after
police pulled him over for weaving and crossing the center line on the road. He failed a
field  sobriety  test.  He  also  had  a  warrant  for  his  arrest  for  not  having  a  valid  vehicle
inspection.  Police  took  him  to  a  detention  center  where  they  administered  him  a
breathalyzer  test  and  the  result  indicated  that  he  had  a  0.108  percent  blood  alcohol
content  (BAC).  He  pleaded  nolo  contendere  to  the  charge.  He  was  sentenced  to  18
months of community supervision, had to attend an alcohol awareness course, and his
license  was  suspended  for  a  year.  He  reported  this  arrest  on  his  2021  Electronic
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (SF 86). (Tr. 17-18, 21-28; Answer; GE 1,

After his 2004 DWI arrest, Applicant contacted the DMV in State A to  determine
the  requirements  to  have  the  restrictions  removed  from  his  driver’s  license.  His
understanding  of  the  information  that  the  DMV  provided  him  was  that  he  had  to  pay
fees. After he paid those fees, he thought he was permitted to drive. However, in 2005,
police pulled him over for driving with an invalid license. He had only removed two of the
three suspensions that had been placed on his driver’s license. As a result, he spent a
day  in  jail  and  had  his  period  of  community  service  extended.  However,  he  soon
thereafter completed  all the  requirements of  the  sentence  from his 2004  DUI  and  was
able to have his driver’s license fully reinstated. (Tr. 25-28; Answer; GE 1, 2, 4)
From 2005 until April 2021, Applicant did not engage in any disqualifying conduct
with  alcohol,  nor  did  he  engage  in  criminal  conduct.  However,  in  April  2021,  he  was
arrested in State A and charged with DWI, second offense, after he was involved in a
minor, single-vehicle accident. He had five beers at a golf driving range and decided to
try  to  drive  home  despite  having  had  too  much  to  drink.  While  testifying,  he  clarified
without being asked that the beers he drank were not normal size beers but were “large”
beers.  While  driving,  he  took  his  eyes  off  the  road  to  check  driving  directions  on  his
phone,  hit  a  curb,  and  hit  his  head  against  the  steering  wheel,  dazing  himself.  Police
arrived at the scene and took him to the hospital where he consented to a blood draw.
He does not recall his BAC percentage, but knows it was over the .08 legal limit.  After
treatment at the hospital, he spent a night in jail. (Tr. 17-18, 28, 33-36; Answer; GE 1-3;

While Applicant was awaiting trial, at his attorney’s suggestion, he attended and
completed  a  32-hour  alcohol  repeat-offender  program  and  a  Mother’s  Against  Drunk
Driving (MADD) victim-impact panel. As he had completed these courses, and given the
17-year  period  between  his  alcohol-related  charges,  the  judge  convicted  him  of  the
reduced  charge  of  first-offender  DWI.  He  was  placed  on  probation  until  August  2024

his employer and FSO about it. (Tr. 35-37, 47-48; Answer; GE 1-3; AE A)

reached the age where Applicant began suffering said trauma, he began to experience
renewed  mental  anguish  from  it.  He  did  not  know  how  to  deal  with  his  feelings  and
internalized them. He and his wife began having marital problems, and he engaged in
the conduct that resulted  in his  April 2021 arrest  during this time. He  claimed that this
arrest  was  a  wakeup  call  to  get  help  for  himself  and  his  marriage.  In  May  2021,  he
began psychotherapy that he has continued up to the date of the hearing. His counselor
holds  a  master’s  degree  in  counseling  education  and  is  a  licensed  professional

childhood trauma with his wife, but he has since. He has discussed it with her and with
his  family.  He  feels much  better  after  attending  psychotherapy  and  has  learned  better
coping  mechanisms.  He  also  attends  church-organized  group  self-improvement
sessions for his betterment three times per week. While he has not been diagnosed with
a substance-use disorder, he has abstained from alcohol since the day of his April 2021

"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He married in 2011 and divorced in 2014. He remarried
in 2016. He has two children from this marriage, ages seven and five. He  completed a
security clearance application in March 2019. In it, he disclosed that he enlisted in the
military in 2000 and he was currently on active duty. The FORM does not list a date of
discharge.  The  evidence  provided  shows  that  he  was  administratively  processed  for
separation in August 2017. Based on information in the FORM, it appears he was still on
active duty in 2019. It is likely he was retained in the military and permitted to retire when
he  became  eligible.  He  is  being  sponsored  for  a  security  clearance  by  his  current
employer, a government contractor.
The SOR alleged and Applicant admitted the following:
1.a: Arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol
in October 2009.
1.b:  Received  treatment  at  a  Substance  Abuse  Rehabilitation  Program
(SARP) from May 2014 to June 2014 and was diagnosed with alcohol use
disorder, severe.
1.c: Arrested and charged with DUI in January 2017.
1.d: Received treatment at SARP from March 2017 to April 2017 and was
diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe.
1.e: Charged with violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)
Articles 86, 107, and 134 for providing a false official statement and failing
to report to place of duty due to excessive alcohol consumption in July 2017.
1.f: Received treatment at behavioral health clinic from April 2019 to May
2019 and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe.
1.g: Received treatment at [X] Hospital from September 2019 to December
2019 and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe.
1.h:  Continued  to  consume  alcohol  excessively  and  to  the  point  of
intoxication until July 2022, notwithstanding being diagnosed with alcohol
use disorder, severe on several occasions.
Applicant  completed  government  interrogatories  in  June  2023  and  affirmed
statements he made to a government investigator in May 2019. He acknowledged he had
been arrested in 2009 for DUI. He said he had been drinking at a bar with friends and
when he was driving home, he was stopped by the police. He was charged with DUI. He
was convicted and received a fine and his license was suspended. He completed a first
offender program and was on probation for three years. He did not have to report to a
probation officer. He completed his probation. (Items 3, 5)
Applicant told the government investigator that in about 2012 he began consuming
alcohol almost daily and then started to binge drink three to five days a month. He said
that alcohol began impacting his life negatively in about 2014. He would consume it alone
at home and would drink 10 or more glasses of whiskey. He attributed his alcohol issues
to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He told the investigator that he was unaware at
the time that alcohol was impacting his life. He disclosed that he participated in alcohol
counseling and treatment and was professionally diagnosed as an alcohol abuser and
alcohol dependent. (Item 3)
Applicant said that in May 2014, he voluntarily sought alcohol treatment because
he was drinking almost daily for about a year and a half to deal with his PTSD. He went
to  the  substance  abuse  office,  and  he  was  screened  and  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use
disorder,  severe  and  was  referred  to  a  rehabilitation  program  The  qualification  of  the
person who diagnosed him is unknown. He participated in the rehabilitation program for
35 days and then was transferred on orders to a new duty station. (Item 3)
Applicant disclosed that he was arrested for DUI in January 2017 after he had been
consuming alcohol in the barracks and left to get some food. He fell asleep in the drive-
thru of a restaurant.  Military police responded  and his breathalyzer results were .24%.
Applicant was attending a military training course at the time and was told he would fail it
due to the incident. He went back to his barracks and continued to consume alcohol. He
failed to report to his assigned duty the next day and his command took him to the hospital
where he was placed in the detoxication unit for five days. He was then screened and
diagnosed with alcohol use disorder-severe and was an inpatient at the Substance Abuse
Rehabilitation Program for 35 days. The qualifications of the person who diagnosed him
are unknown. He completed the program and returned to his unit. His DUI was dismissed
in court. (Items 3, 5, 6)
Applicant  disclosed  that  in  July  or  August  2017,  he  went  to  UCMJ  Article  15
nonjudicial  punishment  (NJP)  for  failing  to  report  to  duty,  providing  a  false  official
statement, and because he was too drunk to go to work (Articles 86, 107 and 134). He
explained that he was drinking into the early morning hours and was drunk when he woke
up. He called his command and told them he was having car troubles. He was staying at
a hotel at the time because he was transferring duty stations. He was supposed to check
out of the hotel the next day. When he failed to do so, the hotel owner contacted his unit.
Military personnel arrived to do a wellness check. They learned Applicant had lied to the
command. Applicant provided a letter to his command to be considered at his NJP. In it,
he  said  he  had  to  do  better,  and  that  he  had  completely  abstained  from  alcohol
consumption and was attending AA at least five days a week. He was working the 12-
step AA program and had a sponsor. He was also seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist.
At  NJP,  Applicant  received  restriction  and  forfeitures,  both  of  which  were  suspended.
(Items 3, 5)
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  in  April  2019  he  voluntarily  sought  alcohol
treatment because he continued to consume alcohol. He said since 2017 he had been
binge drinking three to five days a month. He saw a military mental health professional
who diagnosed him with alcohol disorder-severe with PTSD symptoms. He was referred
to a civilian mental health clinic. He said he saw a doctor there and completed treatment
in  May  2019.  He  told the  investigator that  it  was  unlikely  that  he  would  ever consume
alcohol again because of its negative impact on his life. He said he had gone to counseling
and rehabilitation, and he and his wife no longer purchase alcohol. (Item 3)
Applicant  completed  another  set  of  interrogatories  in  March  2023.  In  them,  he
disclosed that he does not currently consume alcohol and his last consumption was the
week  of  July  25-29,  2022.  He  said  he  had  five  drinks.  He  said  he  no  longer  enjoys
consuming alcohol in any setting and does not enjoy the taste or its effects. He disclosed
he  was  taking  medication  to  help  him  abstain  from  alcohol  consumption.  He  did  not
provide any specific information about the type of medication, who prescribed it, and how
long  he  has  been  taking  it.  He  did  not  intend  to  consume  alcohol  in  the  future.  He
disclosed his last blackout was in August 2021. He disclosed his 2014 and 2017 inpatient
treatments  for alcohol use  disorder and  was  advised  as  part of  his aftercare  to  attend
Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  and  check  in  with  the  substance  abuse  counselor once a
week for a year. He further disclosed that from September 2019 to December 2019, he
received treatment and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder-severe. He was advised
to attend AA and check-in with his substance abuse counselor once a week for a year.
He said he complied with the requirements. He did not provide any documents to support
his statements.
Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM or any corroborating documents
from mental health professionals about his diagnoses of alcohol use disorder. He did not
provide information about whether he currently attends AA and if he has a sponsor. He
did not provide an update about his sobriety.

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted some of the SOR Guideline J allegations, with
explanations, (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.f) and denied others (SOR ¶ 1.d). He admitted the
Guideline  G  allegations,  with  explanations,  consistent  with  his  Guideline  J  answers
(SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.c). His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful review of the testimony, pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He married in 2021, after a 15-year courtship. He has
no children. He is currently employed by a government contractor, where he has worked
for approximately two years. He holds two associate degrees and a bachelor’s degree.
This is his first application for a security clearance. (Tr. 6, 20, 28; GE 1; AE K-L)
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged with alcohol-related
criminal offenses  on  six  occasions:  (1) in  November 2003,  he  was charged,  convicted
and  sentenced  for  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI);  (2)  in  March  2011,  he
was charged with DUI and refusal to take a chemical test for alcohol, for which he was
convicted and sentenced; (3) in August 2011, he was charged with DUI, which charge
was  dismissed;  (4)  In  December  2013,  he  was  charged  with  intoxication  and  criminal
trespass,  for  which  he  was  convicted  on  the  intoxication  charge  and  sentenced;  (5)  in
September 2017, he was charged with public intoxication, which charge was dismissed;
and (6)  in  June  2020, he  was  charged with  intoxication, which  charge  was reduced to
disorderly conduct as part of a plea in abeyance. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f)
Under Guideline  G, the SOR:  (1) cross-alleged  the  Guideline J allegations above;
(2) alleged that Applicant consumed  alcohol to  the  point  of intoxication,  at  various  times,
from   2003   to   September  2022;  and   (3)  alleged   that  he   was  court-ordered   to   attend
substance-abuse   outpatient  counseling   from   August   2011   to   about  February  2012.
(SOR ¶¶  2.a-2.c)
Applicant began drinking alcohol when he was 18 or 19 years old, in about 2001
to 2002. He did this to socialize with friends. Starting in about 2010, he would consume
about a six-pack of beer or a few shots at social gatherings. During this time, he would
typically  drink  to  intoxication.  He  would  become  intoxicated  after  drinking  four  to  six
beers,  or  three  glasses  of  wine.  He  became  louder  and  less  inhibited  when  he  was
intoxicated.  During  the  end  of  his  college  days  in  2015,  he  was  drinking  8-12  beers a
day, four to five days a week. In 2022, he was consuming one to  two glasses of wine
one to two times a week, and one to two bottles of wine over the weekend with his wife.
He testified that his current consumption of alcohol is “a few beers, here and there on
weekends with my wife.” (Tr. 20; GE 2)
The details of his arrests and alcohol consumption of concern follow:
June 2020  Intoxication Charge  (SOR ¶ 1.a)-Applicant had an argument with his
fiancée  (now  wife)  and  left  his  home  to  go  drink  at  a  bar.  During  his  statement  to  an
investigator,  he  claimed  he  drank  three  beers  and  two  shots  in  a  three-hour  period.
During his hearing testimony, he stated he drank five to six beers on that occasion. He
became loud and disruptive and the police were  called. He was arrested and taken to
jail,  where  he  was  released  the  next  day.  A  plea  agreement  was  reached  and  the
intoxication  charge  was  dismissed  and  he  pleaded  to  a  disorderly  conduct  charge,
which  was  held  in  abeyance  for  a  year.  He  completed  the  year  without  any  violations
and the disorderly charge was dismissed. (Tr. 33-34; GE 1-2; SOR answer; AE I)
September  2017   Intoxication  Charge   (SOR  ¶  1.b)-During  his  background
investigation,  Applicant  admitted  being  at  a  bar  from  about  10  pm  to  11  pm.  He
consumed  two  to  three  pitchers  of  beer.  He  left  the  bar  and  someone  from  the  bar
called the police registering a noise complaint. The police arrived and gave him a ride to
his  home.  He  was  later  cited  for  intoxication.  The  citation  was  dismissed  for  lack  of
evidence. (GE 2; SOR answer)
December   2013   Intoxication   and  Criminal  Trespass   (SOR   ¶  1.c)-During  his
background investigation, Applicant admitted that he had been drinking 8 to 10 beers at
his home when he decided to walk to a local store to purchase more beer. At the store,
he encountered people outside who he believed were selling drugs. He confronted the
people and eventually the police were called. When the police arrived, he was arrested
for being intoxicated. He pleaded no contest to the intoxication charge and the criminal
trespass  was  dismissed.  He  was  also  ordered  to  undergo  an  alcohol  evaluation.  He
participated in an evaluation in April 2014, and no program referral was recommended.
(GE 2; SOR answer; AE H)
August  2011   DUI   (SOR  ¶   1.d)-Applicant  denied  this  arrest  in  his  answer  and
there  is  no  discussion  of  this  incident  during  his  background  interview.  An  FBI  report
supports that this incident related back to his March 2011 arrest, infra, and was not an
independent charge. I find for Applicant on this allegation. (GE 2-3; SOR answer)
March 2011  DUI  and Refusal  of Chemical Testing  (SOR ¶ 1.e)-Applicant and a
friend went to a club in March 2011. Applicant drank several beers and had some shots
before  leaving  the  club.  Applicant  was  driving  and  was  stopped  immediately  upon
leaving  the parking  lot by  law  enforcement. Applicant  was  told  the reason for  the  stop
was because he spun his tires coming out of the parling lot. He refused a breathalyzer
test at the scene and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of DUI. Blood was later
drawn from him. The results of the blood test are not in the record. He was charged with
DUI and pleaded guilty to the charge  in July 2011. His other charges were dismissed.
The court treated this conviction as a second  DUI for sentencing purposes because of
his November 2003 DUI,  described  infra. He  was  sentenced to  180 days  jail  time, but
170 days were suspended. He was also sentenced to one year of probation, fined, and
ordered  to  attend  alcohol  counseling.  He  participated  in  a  group  alcohol  counseling
program from August 2011 to February 2012. No treatment records were made apart of
this hearing record. He provided two negative urinalysis tests that he took as part of the
counseling  program.  Applicant claims he  was  not  diagnosed  while in  the  program and
that no recommendations were made about his future alcohol consumption. (Tr. 23-24;
GE 2; SOR answer; AE E-G)
November  2003  DUI  (SOR ¶ 1.f)-At 1:30 am, Applicant was driving home from a
friend’s house where he had been drinking alcohol. He was under the legal age to drink
alcohol at  the  time.  His  car  was  stopped  by law  enforcement  for  a  traffic violation.  He
was  given  a  breathalyzer  test,  which  produced  a  result  of  .16  percent  blood  alcohol
content  which  is  over  the  legal  limit.  As  a  minor,  no  amount  of  alcohol  in  his  blood
system  is  permitted.  He  admitted  drinking  approximately  32  ounces  of  beer  at  the
gathering.  He  was  charged  with  DUI  and  pleaded  guilty  in  January  2004.  He  was
sentenced  to  30  days  jail  time,  suspended;  probation  for  one  year;  and  fined.  (GE  2;
SOR answer; AE D)
Applicant also testified that he has not attended any additional alcohol treatment
programs  other  than  described  supra.  He  also  claimed  that  he  abstains  from  drinking
alcohol  periodically  for  about  60  to  90  days  at  a  time,  but  no  specific  dates  were
provided. He did not provide any corroboration for these claimed periods of abstinence.
His  wife  provided  a  written  statement  and  claimed  that  he  “rarely  indulges  in  alcohol,
especially not to excess. . . .” He admitted that he last drank alcohol three weeks before
his  hearing  and  that  he  was  last  intoxicated  from  alcohol  between  one  and  two  years
ago  when  he  drank  a  few  beers  and  had  a  few  shots  of  whiskey.  His  background
investigator  noted  that  when  he  contacted  Applicant  in  early  2022  to  set  up  the
interview, Applicant told the investigator that he was finishing up his workday and was
working  on  his  second  bottle  of  wine.  He  was  working  from  home  that  day.  The
investigator noted the call was at 3:30 pm. At his hearing, Applicant testified that the call
was after his work hours, but he admitted drinking that much wine that day. He was not
disciplined for the incident by his employer. (Tr. 21, 26-28, 31, 36, 39-40, 47; GE 2; AE
V2-V3, V4)
Applicant  does  not  attend  Alcoholics  Anonymous  meetings  (AA).  He  does  not
believe that the AA program is a good fit for him. He relies on support from friends and
family to  refrain  from  making  alcohol-related  mistakes.  He  drinks alcohol less frequently
because   he   is  trying   to   live  a  healthier   lifestyle.   His  wife   “keeps   him   in  check.”   In
September through  October  2023, he  attended  six  counseling  sessions with  a  licensed
clinical social worker  (therapist). This counseling  was provided  through  his employment.
He admitted  the  sole  reason  he  sought this  counseling  was  due  to  having  this hearing.
The   therapist   provided   a   letter  stating   that   Applicant   is  doing   well  in   therapy.   He  also
stated  that he  was pleased  Applicant  made  the  decision  to  remain alcohol free. (Tr. 20-
21-22, 24-25, 37; AE  W)
Applicant presented six character letters from family, friends, a former coworker,
and his current team supervisor. They describe Applicant as intelligent, responsible, and
someone who is dedicated, hard-working, and trustworthy. Several commented how he
has  improved  himself  over  the  years.  His  current  supervisor  recommends  that  he  be
considered  for  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  also  provided  two  certificates  he  was
awarded. (AE M-N, P-S, U-V2-V3)

"Applicant  admitted  the  five  allegations  in  the  SOR  (¶¶  1.a-1.e),  with  a  narrative
statement. I have incorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. He and his wife have been married since 2015. They
have three young children. Applicant has a bachelor’s degree and has additional credits
towards  a  master’s  degree.  He  has  been  employed  with  the  same  large  defense

Applicant first consumed alcohol at age 14 or 15. His drinking increased in his 20’s,
and occurred mostly on weekends with friends. He drank to excess at times during this
period, but he did not believe he had a drinking problem. On two occasions in fall 2005,
Applicant  was arrested  and charged with driving under the influence. Both occurred in
State  1,  where  he  lived  at  the  time,  and  occurred  shortly  after  the  end  of  a  long-term
relationship. (AE A; Tr. 114-116, 148-149)
In September 2005, Applicant went out with work friends. He had a few beers at
someone’s home. He left his car there while they all went out to bars in a nearby city. At
the end of the evening, Applicant retrieved his car and began to drive home, believing he
was sober enough to do so. However, on the way home, he also stopped for coffee so he
could sober up. He sat in his car in the coffee shop parking lot for 45 minutes. A nearby
security guard thought he was acting suspiciously and called police. The officer saw him
move his car out of a “no parking” fire zone. Applicant told the officer he had been drinking.
He was arrested and charged with DUI after failing roadside sobriety tests. Breathalyzers
at  the  police  station  revealed  a  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  of  0.17%.  He  was  jailed
overnight. He reported the incident to his employer’s security office days later and kept
them informed. (AE A) (SOR ¶ 1.d)
A  month  later,  in  October  2005,  Applicant  attended  a  concert  in  another  city  in
State 1, where he lived. He then went to a bar and consumed four alcoholic beverages in
four hours. He again attempted to drive home, and soon realized it was unsafe to do so,
in part because it was rainy. He pulled over on the highway and was walking to a nearby
convenience store to call a taxi when police arrived, having seen his parked car on the
roadside. He acknowledged he had been driving the car, failed the sobriety tests, blew a
0.15% BAC on the breathalyzer, and was arrested for DUI. (AE A) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Both of Applicant’s 2005 DUIs were adjudicated together and he was found guilty
on both charges, in about September 2006. His license was suspended for two years, he
was ordered to attend 48 hours of alcohol education classes and to perform 30 hours of
community service. He was also fined and ordered to pay court costs. He attended one
required Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) class. He completed all requirements. He reported
both arrests to security. (AE A, Att. 6-7; Tr. 114-117, 124)
Applicant had no other alcohol-related incidents or offenses for the next 10 years.
During this period, He admitted that he drank too much on weekends, but he denied any
driving after consuming alcohol. During this period, he met and began dating his wife. (AE
A; Tr. 117)
In April 2015, Applicant and his wife, then his fiancée, were living and working in
State 2. He went to a neighborhood bar with friends. He consumed three or four beers
during the evening. While paying his bar tab at the end of the evening, he was approached
by  another  bar  patron,  who  confronted  him  and  demanded  that  he  leave  the  bar
immediately. After paying his tab. Applicant left the bar and saw the other patron talking
to  a  uniformed  police  officer.  Applicant  was  then  arrested  and  taken  to  a  local  police
station. He spent the night in jail. He only learned later that he was charged with public
intoxication. When he went court two months later, the arresting officer failed to appear,
and the charge was dismissed. He reported the offense on his next SCA, completed in
July 2018. He testified that he was embarrassed and regretful about the incident and he
was not proud of it, particularly because it occurred a month  before his wedding. (GE 1;
AE A; Tr. 118-119, 124-125) (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant and his wife moved to State 3 for work in 2016. (GE 1) Between 2015
and  2020,  as  they  began  to  raise  a  family,  Applicant  drank  at  happy  hours  and  on
weekend nights. (AE A) He stopped drinking hard alcohol and would mostly drink wine
with  his  wife.  He  acknowledged  uncomfortable  conversations  with  his  wife  about  his
drinking, including whether he should stop. As his wife testified, he acknowledged drinking
wine after she went to bed -- “one or two at least.” He acknowledged drinking a bottle of
wine on the weekends. (Tr. 119-121, 150-151)
On Friday, March 13, 2020, Applicant went to a happy hour with co-workers after
work.  He  had  not  eaten  lunch.  He  consumed  several glasses  of wine,  without  food  or
water,  between  about  3  PM  and  8  PM.  He  was  pulled  over  for  speeding.  He  failed
roadside sobriety tests and a breathalyzer registered a 0.238% BAC. He was arrested
and charged with DUI. (GE 1. GE 2, GE 3, GE 4; AE A; Att. 8; Tr. 121, 152-153) (SOR ¶
1.a)
Applicant promptly disclosed the matter to his supervisor (Ms. F, discussed below)
and reported it to security. (Tr. 125) With the strong urging of his wife and family over the
next several days, he also decided to seek treatment. (Tr. 126)
On or about March 18, 2020, only days after his arrest, Applicant entered treatment
at Treatment Center B. He was diagnosed with severe alcohol use disorder. (GE 4 at 10)
He remained in inpatient treatment for 37 days, and continued with outpatient treatment
until May 26, 2020, when he was discharged successfully. (GE 4 at 17-18; AE A, Att. 11,
Att. 12; Tr. 127) (SOR ¶ 1.e)
Documentation   reflects  that,   on   intake   at  Treatment  Center  B,  Applicant  was
regarded   as  cooperative   and   well-spoken   but  he   also  minimized   and   disregarded   the
consequences   of   his  drinking   and   appeared   to   justify   his  conduct.   He   presented   for
treatment after his third  DUI and  recognized  the  consequences facing  him  (losing  his job,
losing   his  license,  and   going   to   jail).  (GE  4   at  1)  He  reported   that  he   drove   while
intoxicated,  cared   for his children   while under the   influence, and  had  driven   with   them
while  under  the   influence.  In   his  hearing   testimony,  he   acknowledged   that   there  were
probably other times when  he  drove  while   “over the  limit” but denied  driving   under the
influence   with   his  children.   (Tr.  128-129,154,  173-174)  He  reported   blackouts,   loss  of
recollection,  missing  work, and  showing  up  to  work hung  over.  He explained  in  testimony
that he  was  sometimes  late  to  work because  he  did not have  a  driver’s license  but denied
any other alcohol-related work issues.  He denied blackouts. (Tr. 127-128, 149-150, 155)
He noted  a  family history of alcohol abuse  and  recognized  his disregard for his own well-
being  and  the  damage  alcohol was  doing  to  his health.  (GE 4  at 5) He  reported  beginning
drinking  in  his teens with  no  significant  periods of  sobriety.  He  reported  consuming  two
bottles   of  wine   over the   previous   19   days.   (GE 4   at 6,   13)   He  reported   struggling   with
cravings and  an  inability to  stop  drinking. (GE  4  at 12) He presented  with  at least mild
signs and  symptoms of withdrawal or imminent withdrawal. (GE 4  at 9) He testified  that
he   was  placed   on   withdrawal  medication   on   intake   but  said  this   was  required   as  a
standard precaution. (Tr. 129-131, 174)
Applicant  was  discharged  from  inpatient  treatment  in  mid-April  2020  and  was
discharged from the outpatient program on May 26, 2020. He was regarded as compliant
and cooperative throughout the process. He learned coping skills, the disease model of
addiction, a 12-step recovery program, and family systems. He was in a 12-step program
and private therapy and would continue both. “His prognosis at this time is positive and
good. He has support outlets and is honest with his family and friends.” (GE 4 at 19) He
was  advised  to  pursue  individual  therapy  and  to  return  to  Treatment  Center  B  should
relapse occur. He reported being committed to his recovery. (GE 4 at 19) (Tr. 131-133,
135-137)
In July 2020, Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI for his March 2020 offense. He was
sentenced  to  one  year  of  supervised  probation.  He  was  also  ordered  to  complete
community  service,  attend  a  DUI  education  class,  substance  abuse  treatment,  and  a
victim awareness course. He was fined and ordered to pay court costs. His probation was
terminated several months early (and successfully), in July 2021. He also said he was not
allowed to drive. By then, his office was working remotely due to the pandemic.  (GE 1,
GE 2, GE 3; AE A, Att. 9, Att. 10; Tr. 167-168, 172-173)
As  recommended,  Applicant  continued   meeting   with   the   Treatment  Center  B’s
“alumni”  group,  both  locally and  virtually, from  about April 2020  to  April 2021. (Tr. 162-
164)  He   also  immediately  joined   Alcoholics  Anonymous   (AA).   He  attended   90   AA
sessions in 90  days.  He then  attended  three  to  five  meetings  a  week for the  next 18-24
months  (either in-person  or online, due  to  COVID pandemic restrictions). He has had  an
AA  sponsor ever since,  including  his current  sponsor, Mr. X  (discussed  below), and  others
before  him.  He  now  attends  between   one   and   three   AA   meetings  a   week.  He  gets
significant  value  from  the  experiences  of  his  sponsors. (AE  A,  Att.  13; Tr.  133-135, 137-
143, 164-166) He acknowledged  that his daily AA  meetings often  put  a  strain on  his wife,
since  the  meetings were often  in  the evenings, as  she  was  coming home from work.  (Tr.
156-157)
Applicant has not consumed any alcohol since March 14, 2020, more than three
years and seven months before his October 2023 DOHA hearing. (AE A; Tr. 127) He has
had  no  further  arrests.  (Tr.  159)  He  has  also  pursued  a  healthier  lifestyle,  including
exercise, gardening, outdoor nature hobbies, and spending time with his wife and young
sons.  (Tr.  143-145)  He  acknowledged  that  he  came  to  the  realization  that  he  had  to
change his life. “Being an alcoholic, alcohol was like a second job;” hiding how much he
drank and arguing with his wife or family about his drinking. He does not do that anymore.
He prefers to spend time with his family. (Tr. 158-159) Applicant is very confident about
his  ability  to  maintain  sobriety  going  forward.  He  loves  his  job  and  the  role  he  plays
supporting national defense. (Tr. 146-147)
At  the  time  of  his  hearing,  Applicant  had  not  had  a  subsequent  or  updated
assessment  or  diagnoses  since  his  diagnosis  of  severe  alcohol  abuse  disorder  at
Treatment Center B in 2020. (Tr. 160) (See AE B, below) Applicant said he intended to
continue working through the steps of AA, and ultimately to sponsor new members. It has
made   him   “a  better  person,  a   better  father,   a   better  husband,”  and   better  at  work.  He
believes  AA  saved  his life. He  has been  humbled  by  the experience  of  the  DUI  and  the
clearance  hearing process. He loves his job  and  hopes  for the opportunity to  continue  in
his career as  a  cleared  employee. (Tr. 171-172) He is not currently in  other counseling  or
therapy. He has had a  driver’s license without restrictions for about two years. (Tr. 166)
Applicant’s  wife  is  an  18-year  cleared  employee  at  Company  A.  She  holds  a
bachelor’s  degree  and  dual  master’s  degrees.  They  met  through  work  in  about  2008,
began dating in 2011, moved to State 2 together for work in 2013, and married in 2015.
They have three boys all under age six, including a toddler. (Tr. 42-46, 87-88)
Applicant’s  wife   is not  a   big  drinker.   He drank  but not  more   than   others  did. He
became  more  family oriented  after the  birth  of their  first child. Beginning  in about 2017-
2018,  she   became   more  concerned   about  his  drinking.   This  was   a   hard  time   in   their
marriage. She  loves  him  and  does not  want him  to  hurt  himself but  he  said  at the  time
that  he  did not  want  to  be  controlled. Incidents where  he  drank  too  much  were  sporadic
and  often  months apart. They had  conversations about his drinking  level but little changed
during this period. (Tr. 42-52)
After their children were born (2017-2018), Applicant’s drinking pattern would be
to drink at home, since they did not go out much. She believes he would drink after she
went to bed. He would drink wine with dinner and would drink on weekends. She is not
aware that he ever went to work late or missed work. He never drove with their children
after consuming alcohol. Drinking was social and to relieve stress. (Tr. 72-82)
After Applicant was arrested in March 2020, his wife was upset. His parents and
her  mother  came  immediately  to  help.  The  family  talked  and  decided  that  Applicant
needed to get help. They researched rehabilitation facilities and he left for inpatient rehab
almost immediately. Previously, Applicant had resisted seeking treatment and was initially
resistant again due to his family and work responsibilities but agreed to enter treatment
voluntarily. His manager was very supportive. (Tr. 52-60 and 77-78)
Applicant’s wife said the family had little contact with him while he was in inpatient
treatment, only a few calls.  When he came home, he  had changed and become more
reserved,  rather than  being  “happy-go-lucky”  as  before.  After several more months  he
began to see life without drinking. It took a year for his wife to feel comfortable having a
drink with dinner. She wanted to be supportive of his sobriety. She now feels they have
developed confidence and trust that he will not drink and she does not think about him
“falling off the wagon.” She said he treated his sobriety as his number one priority because
“if I don’t do this, everything falls apart.” They did couples counseling as part of Applicant’s
after-care  program,  for  six  to  nine  months  as  recommended  and  some  individual
counseling. He has been actively involved in AA and is working with his sponsor. He now
has new hobbies and pastimes, like gardening. He has maintained sobriety since March
2020. They do not keep hard alcohol or beer in the house and she tracks the limited wine
that they have. They socialize as a family and Applicant will separate himself from work
social events where alcohol is present. (Tr. 61-69, 78-81)
Applicant’s  wife  said  he  prioritizes  his  sobriety  now  but  it  is  less  of  a  delicate
balance with family needs (compared with the immediate aftermath of treatment, due to
his daily AA meetings). He is a very good father and husband. He is actively involved with
their children. Their marriage and children mean a lot to him. He has tried “really, really,
hard” working on rehabilitation and sobriety. He is proud of his work and his support of
the country. (Tr. 83-87) Applicant’s parents also provided strong recommendation letters
for their son, which I read and closely considered. (AE A, Att. 17, 18)
Mr. X, Applicant’s AA sponsor is also a cleared employee in the field of aviation.
He has been a member of AA for almost 40 years. They met through AA about two years
ago and he agreed to become his sponsor a few months later. They see each other at
weekly AA meetings, speak by phone between meetings about once a week, and meet
occasionally for lunch. Mr. X attested that Applicant is doing well in AA, and that his AA
participation  and  efforts  at  rehabilitation  are  “on  par”  with  someone  maintaining
continuous  sobriety:  “If  he  keeps  doing  what  he’s  doing,  he’ll  keep  getting  what  he’s
getting.” Mr. X has seen no  concerning behavior suggesting  relapse. Applicant has not
expressed any urges to drink, and Mr. X has not known him to have done so. Applicant
is  on  Step  8  of  the  12  AA  recovery  steps  (willingness  to  make  amends).  (Tr.  24-40)
Several  other  participants  from  AA  and  Treatment  Center  B  provided  similar,  strong
recommendation letters, which I read and closely reviewed. (AE A, Att. 14, 15, 16, 19)
Applicant’s character witness, Ms.  F, is a  veteran and longtime employee of the
aerospace  and  defense  industry.  She  graduated  from  a  service  academy,  was
commissioned as an active-duty military intelligence officer for several years, earned a
master’s  degree,  and  joined  the  defense  industry  in  2001.  She  is  currently  a  vice
president. She has held a clearance for many years. (Tr. (91-93)
Ms. F. was Applicant’s  supervisor for about three  and  a  half  years,  from  2019  to
mid-2023   when   she   left  the   company.  They  generally  had   very  close   and   continuing
professional  contact,  though   it  diminished   during   the   COVID  pandemic  due   to   remote
working  (which,  by coincidence, began  right after Applicant’s March 2020  DUI). (Tr. 93-
94, 97-98, 101-104)  She testified that Applicant was an  extremely reliable employee and
a creative and strategic thinker, a leader and  a subject matter expert. (Tr. 93-95)
Applicant informed Ms. F of his 2020 DUI within days afterward and that he was
entering  alcohol  rehabilitation.  Before  then,  she  had  no  concerns  about  his  work
performance, judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, or clearance eligibility and she has no
such concerns now. (Tr. 95-96, 99-104) She credits him with disclosing the matter, taking
it seriously, and taking concrete steps to change his behavior. (Tr. 99-100)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  participated  in  an  updated  substance  abuse
evaluation, conducted by a licensed mental health counselor (LMHC), Mr. M. The report
was  based  on  a  two-hour  evaluation  and  interview  of  Applicant.  Mr.  M  assessed  that
Applicant  met  the  full  criteria  for  a  provisional  diagnosis  of  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,  in
Sustained  Remission,  code  F10.21  of  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental
Disorders  5  –  Text  Revision  (DSM-5-TR).  He  was  given  a  fair  prognosis,  given  his
“extensive history with alcohol” and current ability to provide adequate evidence of how
he is maintaining and managing his substance abuse. This included “collateral” evidence
such  as  professional  recommendations  by  peers  and  supervisors,  evaluation  of  job
performance,  evaluation  of  his  support  system,  12-step  program  attendance,
accountability check-ins with a sponsor and other factors. A higher level of care was not
recommended.  “It  is  highly  recommended  that  the  client  continue  to  utilize  support
systems and protective measures set in place that may influence his ability to maintain
sobriety.” Mr. M did not see a concern about alcohol impacting Applicant’s work or limiting
his workplace abilities. (AE B)

"After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  the  Government’s
exhibits,  I make  the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old, earned an Associate’s degree  in June 2014, and has
taken courses beyond that from August 2014 to July 2015. He has never married and has
a three-year-old daughter. Since April 2022, he has worked for a defense contractor. (Item

Under Guideline G, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) was arrested in June 2022
and charged with Driving Under the Influence; (2) entered a plea of nolo contendere to
Reckless Driving Involving Alcohol or Controlled Substance; (3) was sentenced  to one
day in jail; (4) to one year of probation (5) to complete DUI School and a Victim Awareness
Program, and (6) to perform 50 hours of community service. He was placed on probation
until December 2023. Those allegations were cross-pleaded under Guideline J. (Item 1.)
The charge was a misdemeanor and was his first offense. (Items 4 and 5.) He answered,
admitted all SOR allegations, and attached three supporting documents that are identified

The  salient  portions  of  Applicant’s  August  17,  2023  Response  are  summarized
below:
On  June  18, 2022, I was unfortunately charged  with  a  DUI offense.
While  I deeply regret  this lapse  in  judgment,  I took full  responsibility for  my
time  of my situation  by  entering  a  plea. At the  time  of arrest,  I decided  not
to   partake   in   the   breath   test.   Years ago,  in   a   conversation   with   a   trusted
friend  of mine, who  is in local law enforcement,  advised  me  to  never do  the
Breathalyzer.  He  advised   if  I  were   ever  to   get   arrested   to   decline   the
breathalyzer and  all  field sobriety  test  [sic]. I  took that information  to  heart
and  remembered  it  at  the  time  of  my arrest. Declining  these  tests may  not
have  been  the  right decision, looking  back at my situation, but it was the
decision  made  with  the  information  I had  at  the  time.  I want to  assure  all
involved   that  this  is   an   isolated   incident   and   is   not  a   reflection   of   my
character, values, or commitment  to my responsibilities. I acknowledge  my
situation  and  charge  of  reckless  driving  with  alcohol.  It  was  not my  intention
to  mischaracterize  or mislead   about  my  charge.  Throughout  the   process,
my case  was referred  in  the  short phrase  of reckless driving. At no  time  do
I  downplay   my  case,
for  my  actions   while
acknowledging the seriousness of the offense.

implications of  my actions and am determined  to prove that I can  meet and

Applicant’s  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  was  conducted  on  September  20,
2022. The highlights are summarized below:
Applicant was driving  home  from  a  friend’s  house,  after having  one
beer. The  police  pulled  him  over  for  a  missing  license  plate  light. He was
asked  to  complete  an  in-field breathalyzer  test due  to  the  smell  of  alcohol,
which  he  declined.  He  was transported  to  the  sheriff’s office  and  held  for 12
hours.  He was  released  on  his  own  recognizance.  He  has  not received  a
court date  but was told  that  he  would  be  appearing  due  to  the  charge  of a
DUI.   He  believes  that   the   charge   for  DUI  is  a   misdemeanor.  He   has  not
been  given  any charge  information.  He  has  not been  to  court  yet.  This has
only happened once.  (Item 5.)
Law and Policies
It is well established that no one  has a right to a  security clearance. As the
Supreme Court has noted, “the clearly consistent standard indicates that security
determinations should  err, if they must,  on  the side of denials.”  Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
When   evaluating   an   applicant’s   suitability  for   a   security  clearance,   the
administrative judge  must consider the  adjudicative  guidelines. These  guidelines, which
are flexible  rules of law, apply together with  common  sense  and  the  general factors of the
whole-person  concept.  The  administrative  judge  must consider all  available and  reliable
information  about  the  person,  past and  present,  favorable and  unfavorable, in making  a
decision.  The   protection   of   the   national  security  is  the   paramount   consideration.   AG  ¶
2(b)  requires  that   “[a]ny  doubt  concerning   personnel  being   considered   for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under Directive ¶  E3.1.14, the  Government must present evidence  to  establish
controverted   facts   alleged   in   the   SOR.   Under  Directive   ¶   E3.1.15,   the   applicant   is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel. . .  .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.

"Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer or a predecessor thereof since about January 2011. He earned a
high school diploma in 2004 and has taken some college courses but has not earned a
degree.  In  2004,  after  high  school,  he  enlisted  with  the  Navy  and  was  on  active  duty
until  2008,  when  he  was  discharged  for  failing  to  report  for  duty  because  he  had
“alcohol on his breath.” He was “forced out of the Navy” for alcohol-related reasons. He
claimed  he  received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  He  has  been

in excess and drove while intoxicated. During this timeframe, he normally drank two to
three times per week and again on the weekend. He estimated that he often drank 10 to
15  beers  over  a  two-hour  timespan  and  then  drove  home.  He  has  been  arrested  and
charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) four times between May 2007
and  March  2020.  Police  arrested  him  and  charged  him  with  DUI  in  May  2007,  April
2014,  July  2016,  and  March  2020.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  was  convicted  of  the  2007
DUI,  pleaded  guilty  and  received  a  deferred  adjudication  of  the  2014  DUI  charge,
pleaded nolo contendere  to the 2020 DUI charge, and the disposition of his 2016 DUI
charge  is  unclear.  Regardless  of  the  outcome  of  the  charges,  he  was  driving  while
intoxicated on all four occasions he was charged with DUI. He was involved in vehicular
accidents on two of these occasions, in which he collided with a parked car (2014 DUI)
and  a  pole  (2007  DUI).  With  respect  to  the  2014  DUI,  he  claimed  that  he  had  being
drinking heavily, passed out at a friend’s house, and then “woke up” while driving his car
right before getting into an accident. (Tr. 22-25, 37-73; Answer; GE 1-3)
After  his 2020  DUI,  Applicant  knew he  had  to  address  his  alcohol consumption
issues. About a month after his 2020 DUI arrest, Applicant sought and received mental-
health  and  alcohol-related  counseling  from  a  neural  therapist  until  about  December
2021.  He  stopped  attending  this  counseling  because  he  could  not  afford  it.  He
contemplated  attending  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings  but  has  not  done  so
the  aforementioned  mental-health  and  alcohol-related
because  he  considered
counseling  to  be  sufficient.  He  has  access  to  alcohol-related  treatment  that  he  can
afford  through  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  but  he  does  not  know  how  to  begin  the  process
and  has  not  looked  into  it.  After  his  2007  DUI,  the  Navy  required  him  to  attend  a
Substance   Abuse   Rehabilitation   Program   (SARP),  and   an   Alcohol  Dependency
Program  (ADAPT). He  completed  both  of these  requirements.  (Tr. 34-35,  47-50, 63, 70-
71, 75-78; Answer; GE 1-3)
Applicant also has been attending marital counseling for an unspecified period of
time. While he claimed that he was never told to abstain from alcohol or that he suffered
from an alcohol use disorder, he did abstain from alcohol for about six months after his
2016  DUI,  and  from  March  2020  until  December  2023.  During  his  personal  subject
interviews in late 2021 and early 2022, Applicant told a DOD investigator that he vowed
to stop drinking and had no desire to start drinking again. However, in December 2023,
he had a glass of wine with his wife to celebrate his wedding anniversary. He also had a
glass  of  wine  on  New  Year’s  Eve  2023.  He  acknowledged  that  he  should  not  be
consuming  alcohol  but,  paradoxically,  is  not  sure  whether  he  will  abstain  in  the  future
because he  does not have an urge to drink and thinks he  is in control. He claims that
counseling  has  taught  him  to  use  more  healthy  coping  mechanisms.  He  also  claimed
that  he  has  not driven  after  consuming  alcohol  since  his  2020  DUI.  (Tr.  29-31,  49-62,
73-82; Answer; GE 1-3)
Applicant acknowledged that he has made poor choices involving alcohol in the
past, but he believes that he has remedied the underlying issues that caused them. He
claimed that he had undiagnosed and untreated mental health issues that contributed to
his  overdrinking.  Sadly,  within  a  six-month  period  prior  to  his  2016  DUI,  his  sister,
grandmother, and best friend passed away. He claimed that these losses contributed to
his mental-health issues, which resulted in him drinking more. He claimed that he does
well at work, has never shown up to work intoxicated, and has been entrusted to be a
union representative for about 700 people over the last eight years. (Tr. 22-25, 29, 35,

Alcohol Consumption  and Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  under  Guideline  G  that  in  about  July  2022,  Applicant  was
arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). He pleaded guilty,
and in March 2023, he was sentenced to three years of probation and to attend six months
of first offender alcohol program. SOR ¶ 2.a cross-alleged the conduct in SOR ¶ 1.a under
Guideline J.
Applicant does not have any other arrests or convictions. (Tr. 25, 27) No friends or
family have expressed a concern to him about his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 29) He rarely
consumed alcohol because his employer required him to work in a country that does not
permit alcohol use. (Tr. 30) When he consumed alcohol in July 2022, he had not had any
alcohol to drink for six months. (Tr. 31) He claimed he drank one beer and two hard drinks
in a bar. (Tr. 31, 36) His ticket for the DUI offense states he weighs 235 pounds; and he
said at the hearing he weighed about 300 pounds in July 2022. (Tr. 32; AE B)
Applicant left the bar about midnight, and he believed it was safe for him to drive.
(Tr. 32) He said he did not feel any effects from his previous alcohol consumption at the
time he left the bar. (Tr. 33) His hotel was about 15 miles from the bar. (Tr. 33) After about
five minutes, he felt ill, and he pulled over onto the side of the road. (Tr. 34) Applicant’s
vehicle was at an off ramp where truckers park, and the vehicle may have been slightly
over  the  line.  (Tr.  40)  He  felt  like  he  had  been  drugged  or  was  suffering  from  food
poisoning. (Tr. 34, 37) He felt it was unsafe to drive, and he fell asleep at about 1:00 a.m.
(Tr. 34, 41) He did not remember if he turned off the ignition of his vehicle. (Tr. 39-40) At
about 3:00 or 4:00 a.m., the police woke him. (Tr. 34, 41) He had a breath-alcohol test
(BAT) at the site of his arrest, and the officer said it showed he was over the legal limit;
however, he said he did not remember the BAT result. (Tr. 42) He received another BAT
at the police station, and the result was over the limit. He said he did not remember the
result of the second BAT.
Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he did
not receive a blood-alcohol test, and he could not remember the alcohol content for his
breathalyzer tests. (GE 2) Two weeks after his arrest, he returned to the foreign country
where he is employed. (Tr. 48) He returns to the United States about every six months to
be with his family.
Applicant  pleaded   guilty  to   DUI.   (Tr.  44)  He  received   three   years  of  informal
probation. (AE  D)  His probation  permits  him  to  drink alcohol.  (Id.) He was sentenced  to
pay fines  and  court costs of $1,545, and  to  attend  a  six-month  alcohol program. (Id.) The
six-month   alcohol  program   is  required   when   a   driver’s  blood-alcohol  content  (BAC)   is
“between  0.15% and  0.19%.” (HE  5) Applicant  believes he  can  successfully complete  the
three-year probation period, and the DUI conviction will be removed from his record. (Tr.
25) He is not permitted  to  drive  in the  state  where he  was arrested  for  DUI for three  years.
(Tr. 46) He  does not  have  a  probation  officer.  (Tr. 46)  He  acknowledged  that driving  after
drinking alcohol was “extremely stupid.” (Tr. 49)
Applicant provided court documents after his hearing which indicated his BAC was
.16 percent. (AE C at 5) He acknowledged it was not possible for a person who weighs
300  pounds  to  drink  three  drinks,  stop  drinking  about  1:00  a.m.,  and  provide  a  breath
sample several hours later to test above the legal limit. (Tr. 54-55) He stood by his claim
of only consuming three drinks. (Tr. 56)
On  June  27,  2023,  Appellant  completed  the  six-month  First  Offender  Alcohol
Program. (SOR response) He paid the fines and costs and completed all requirements of
his sentence except for the three years of informal probation.
In  response  to  a  question  on  January  23,  2024,  about  when  he  most  recently
consumed alcohol, he said:
Honestly,  I  do   not  remember  the   exact  date,  but  I   believe   it  was   holiday
season  of 2022  going  into  2023.  And  even  then  it was  only wine/champagne
to  celebrate  the  season. Since  the  event that had  happened  to  me  it has
been  a  real  eye  opener &  rude  awakening. I  have  since  refrained  &  been
trying  to  get healthier &  lose  weight.  Both  for my career &  for my children.
Being   overweight &   having   sleep   apnea   is bad   enough. You  add   alcohol
into the  mix it only heightens the risk for medical issues.  (AE  G)
Applicant’s  manager  served   with   him   in  Europe   when   they  were   both   on   active
duty and  supervises him in his current overseas employment. He  described  Applicant  as

"Applicant admitted all of the allegations contained in the SOR. (¶¶ 1.a -1.c, 2.a,
and 2.b.) (Answer) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I
make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 32 years old, married with two sons, ages 8 and 9, and a baby due in
March 2024. In April 2022, he began working for a government  contractor as a research
lab mechanic. This is Applicant’s first application  for a DOD security clearance. In April
2022, he submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In
January  2023,  he  answered  interrogatory  questions  developed  after  his  August  2022
background interview with an investigator.  (Tr. 15-17, 35; GE 1, 2 and 4)
Alcohol consumption and criminal conduct
I listed Applicant’s conduct in chronological order as follows:
SOR  ¶ 1.c  (cross-alleged under ¶ 2.a): Applicant  was  charged  in October 2011
with an underaged drinking of alcohol. He stated that he was at a bar drinking alcohol at
the age of 20. After he and his friend left left the bar, they were pulled over by a police
officer and charged with consuming alcohol underage. (Tr. 49; GE 3)
SOR  ¶  2.b:  Applicant  was  charged  in  November  2011  with  drug  abuse  and
possession of paraphernalia. He had people at his apartment and the police were called
due to a noise complaint. When the police looked into his apartment, they saw a pipe for
smoking marijuana and a bag of marijuana sitting on his table. He was charged for the
offenses listed above. Applicant testified that he could not recall the last time he had used
an illegal substance since it was so long ago. (Tr. 49-50)
SOR ¶ 1.b (cross-alleged under ¶ 2.a): Applicant was charged in September 2016
with operating vehicle while intxicated (OVI). He stated that during this time he worked
for a small family-owned heating and air conditioning company. One day the employees
did not have any scheduled work to perform, and the owner of the company offered to
pay his employees to come to his house and plant trees. It was hot that day and his boss
provided beer for the workers. After the work was finished, the employees continued to
stay at the home drinking beer and talking. Without any advance warning, his boss had
to  take  his  wife  somewhere,  and  the  employees  were  expected  to  leave  immediately.
Applicant stated, “I was coming down the road and then forgot about this hill, because I
was intoxicated, and I rolled my car and ended up in a ditch that night and then went to
the hospital.” His blood- alcohol level was twice the legal limit, around .16% or .17%. He
was found guilty of OVI, his driver’s license  was suspended, he  was ordered  to  attend
Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) alcohol education meetings for a weekend, and
he was assessed fines and costs. (Tr. 29-33; GE 1 and 4)
Applicant told  the  investigator  during  his August 2022  background  interview  that
he  had  consumed  approximately six  beers before his 2016  OVI arrest.  He also told the
investigator that he  crashed  his car after he  tried  avoiding  a  deer in the  road. When  asked
about this discrepancy  during  the  hearing, Applicant stated  he  could  not recall  if he  told
the  investigator there was a  deer, and  he  said  that  he  was unable to  recall  if he  even  saw
a  deer  in the  road  before  he  crashed  his car because  he  was intoxicated.  (GE  4;  Tr. 30-
31)
SOR ¶ 1.a (cross-alleged under ¶ 2.a): Applicant was  arrested in January 2022
and  charged  with  OVI,  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  greater  than  0.08%  but  less  than
0.17% (Applicant registered 0.139%) and speeding. He was convicted of physical control-
reckless driving and the court ordered him to complete a substance abuse assessment,
pay a fine of $250 plus court costs, his driver’s license was suspended until January 2023,
and he was placed on one year of probation, which he successfully completed about a
week before his December 12, 2023 hearing. He stated that he drove his wife’s car and
went to  a friend’s house  to  watch a  playoff football game. Another friend  in attendance
was supposed to drive him home, but his friend drank too much alcohol and got sick. He
estimated  that  he  may  have  consumed  more  than  six  beers  during  the  game.  After
Applicant  waited an hour-and-a-half  to two hours at his friend’s house  to  sober up, he
drove that night and was pulled over for speeding near his home. He was arrested for the
offenses  listed  above.  His  attorney  noted  that  some  of  the  field  sobriety  tests  were
improperly  conducted  by  the  police  officer,  so  Applicant  was  able  to  plead  to  a  lesser
offense of physical control-reckless driving. Applicant stated he voluntarily attended 10
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings on his own because he “felt like it was time to start
shaping  [his] life  up  and  getting  [his] life  together and  quit  drinking.”  He initially denied
that he was ordered by the court to attend AA meetings, but later during the hearing he
admitted he was court-orderd to attend 10 AA meetings. (Tr. 17-23, 27-29, 46; GE 1, 2
and 4)
The January 2022 police report reflected that Applicant had stated  to the police
officer  that  he  had  last  consumed  alcohol  20  minutes  before  he  was  pulled  over.  The
passenger  in  Applicant’s  car  tested  below  the  legal  limit  and  was  permitted  to  drive
Applicant’s  car  from  the  scene.  (GE  2)  When  asked  about  this  information  during  the
hearing, Applicant stated that since his friend had gotten sick, he must have eliminated
the alcohol from his system which may be the reason why his friend registered below the
legal  limit.  Applicant  could  not  explain  why  he  told  the  officer  he  had  last  consumed
alcohol 20 minutes before he was pulled over as compared to his testimony that he waited
an hour-and-a-half to two hours at his friend’s house before driving so that he could sober
up. (Tr. 20-21, 44-45; GE 2)
During  his  August  2022  background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  he  had
consumed  ten  beers  before  his  January  2022  arrest.  He  stopped  drinking  alcohol
altogether in January 2022 following his arrest. He told the investigator that he intends to
continue his abstention of alcohol in the future. He is content with his life without alcohol
and planned to abstain from drinking alcohol.
Applicant first began consuming alcohol at the age of 17. He testified that he drank
beer on  Fridays  and  Saturdays,  and  he  would  consume  anywhere  from  6  to  12  beers
each evening before he had his OVI [should be defined above] arrest in September 2016
(age 25). After that arrest, he did not drink and drive for about the first six months, but he
slowly  slipped  back  into  his  old  drinking  habits.  He  would  drive  under  the  influence  of
alcohol about once every month or two until his second OVI arrest in January 2022. Since
that incident, he has made positive lifestyle changes and no longer drinks and drives. He
has  continued  to  drink  alcohol  to  the  present  time,  but  only  on  holdays  and  family
gatherings. His last use of alcohol occurred on Thanksgiving Day 2023. He stated that he
now consumes alcohol infrequently and in moderation. (GE 4; Tr. 39-42)
During  his  August  2022  background  interview,  Applicant  provided  information
about his use of alcohol. He stated that between the age of 21 to January 2022 (age of
30), he would consume a single six-pack of beer over the course of the weekend. He did
not  get  intoxicated  from  this  level  of  alcohol  use.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  got
intoxicated one or two times a year with his friends. He stated it took 12 beers for him to
become  intoxicated.  He  is  content  with  his  life  without  alcohol.  This  information  was
inconsistent with his testimony. (GE 4)
During  the  December  2023  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  he  has  consumed
alcohol on a few occasions since  he had his August 2022 interview,  but he has never
drank to excess. During the hearing he admitted that he violated the terms of his probation
that  required  total  abstinence  from  alcohol  while  serving  probation  through  early
December 2023. He also stated that during his probation he had to undergo about five or
six urinalysis tests, and he always tested negative for alcohol and drugs. He stated that
the alcohol he consumed only stayed in his system a day or two, and that is why it was
not detected during his tests. He has control of his drinking and no longer gets intoxicated.
The last time he was intoxicated was in January 2022, the night of his arrest. (Tr. 24-25,
28-29; GE 4)
Applicant testified that the last AA meeting he attended was in October 2023. He
stated  he  intends  to  continue  his  AA  meetings  because  “it's  made  [him]  realize  if  [he]
continue[s] down that path then it's not a good life to be going through after hearing all
these  stories  of  what  everyone  goes  through.  And  it's  not  the  life  that  [he]  want[s]  to
live….” He also admitted he received a court-ordered substance abuse assessment, but
he did not know any of the details of his evaluation. He stated he would try to obtain a
copy of the substance abuse assessment as well as substantiating documentation that
he successfully completed his probation in early December 2023. He would submit these
documents while the record was held open. However, no documentation was received
while the record was held open. (Tr. 25, 36-39)
Applicant admitted during the hearing that he continued to consume alcohol which
was in violation of his probation:
JUDGE: Okay. So your probation, did your probation require you to abstain from using
alcohol?
APPLICANT: Yes.
JUDGE: So you did not abstain using alcohol during your period of probation. You violated
your probation, isn't that correct?
APPLICANT: Yes.
JUDGE: Okay. And you said you would drink alcohol like on holidays or whatever. Why
would you do that if you knew that violated your probation?
APPLICANT:  I  don't  know.  Just  poor  -- I  don't  know.  I  just  did.  I  mean,  it  was  poor
judgment on my part. (Tr. 45)

"Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a  though  1.f  and  denied  the
allegations in ¶¶ 1.g through 1.j. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old. He married in 1991 and divorced in 2003. He remarried
in 2004. He has four children ranging in ages from 32 to 16. He has worked for his present
employer,  a  federal  contractor,  since  February  2022.  He  worked  for  other  federal
contractors from 2010, except for a short period of unemployment in December 2021, to
February 2022. (Item 3)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in February 2009. In May
2023,  as  part  of  government  interrogatories,  he  authenticated  the  accuracy  of  the
summary of his February 2009 interview. During his interview, he reported he had been
arrested five times for DUI in the past and that he had a drinking problem for the past 25
years. At the time, he said he was attempting to reduce his alcohol consumption, and he
had reduced it since his 2006 DUI arrest when he consumed four or five beers prior to
riding his motorcycle before he was arrested. The DUI charge was reduced to reckless
driving after he completed the terms of his sentence. (Items 4, 7, 10)
Applicant  disclosed  to  the  investigator  a  2001  DUI  arrest.  He  said  he  had
consumed alcohol to excess and was involved in an accident. He was uncertain as to
how much he had consumed, but he believed it was between six and nine beers over a
two-to-three-hour period. He told the investigator the charges were dismissed due to a
technicality. (Items 4, 10)
Applicant  discussed  with  the  investigator  a  1993  or  1994  DUI  arrest  after
consuming alcohol to excess, when he was stopped by police for speeding. He paid a
fine and performed community service. He further disclosed he was arrested for DUI in
1989 after he consumed alcohol to excess and had used marijuana. He was sentenced
to 30 days in jail. He also disclosed he was arrested for DUI in 1986 but could not recall
the details. (Item 4, Item 10 page 3)
Applicant told the investigator said he had consumed six to nine beers on average
three to four times a week prior to 2006 when he was last arrested for DUI. Since then,
he consumed two to three beers two to three times a week. He uses alcohol to relax and
enjoys drinking beer after work. He considered himself an alcoholic in the past but did not
at the time of his 2009 security interview. He said he has worked on his own to reduce
his alcohol consumption. He said because he was newly married with children he can not
be intoxicated when he cares for his children. His intention at that time was to continue to
consume alcohol socially. (Item 10 page 4)
On  August  18,  2021,  Applicant  voluntarily  sought  alcohol  treatment  and
participated in an inpatient program until September 9, 2021. A response for his medical
records is dated September 2022. The treating physician stated at the time of discharge
from treatment in September 2021, that Applicant was “in remission of his symptoms at
discharge.  Conditions of  symptoms are unknown  to  us  since  then.”  His  prognosis  was
positive.  (Item  9  page  18)  Applicant  provided  a  statement  with  his  August  2022
interrogatories. He said, “I do not drink alcohol. I got carried away with my drinking during
the COVID lock down and working from home. I have corrected that now.” The statement
is undated. (Item 9)
Applicant’s inpatient treatment records show he was diagnosed with Alcohol Use
Disorder by a qualified medical professional. He disclosed to the doctor that he was self-
referring  for  treatment  after  years  of  heavy  alcohol  consumption  and  unsuccessful
attempts to quit. He provided a history of his past alcohol abuse which began with heavy
drinking in 2012. He consumed a six-pack of beer (12 ounces) together with a half bottle
of hard liquor daily. This pattern continued for seven years uninterrupted. In 2019, he tried
to  quit  alcohol  consumption  on  and  off  unsuccessfully.  In  2020,  he  was  able  to  stop
alcohol consumption for six months. He told the doctor that he attended AA for six to eight
weeks, but he did not benefit from it. He started consuming alcohol again after six months
of sobriety. His consumption gradually and then drastically increased. Upon admission
into the treatment program, he was consuming a six-pack of beer plus a half bottle of hard
liquor each day during the weekend and a reduced amount two to three days during the
week. He reported his drinking was causing significant problems with his family and work
with  the  potential  of  separation/divorce  from  his  wife  and  unemployment.  Prior  to
admission, Applicant reported he had been drinking heavily for four days straight. (Items
9, 10)
Applicant  was  in  a  locked  unit  for assessment,  detoxification,  and monitoring  of
withdrawal  symptoms.  He  was  provided  medication  to  help  him  with  his  withdrawal
symptoms.  After  he  was  medically  stable  and  his  withdrawal  symptoms  improved,  the
medication was discontinued, and he was transferred to an open unit to “start a rigorous
substance  use  treatment.” The  report of treatment stated  that he  was integrated  into  a
multimodal  treatment  program  which  included  intensive  psychotherapy,  occupational
therapy, art therapy, and physiotherapy, as well as medical optimization, daily visits by
the  psychiatry  team,  and  a  through  medical  evaluation  to  rule  out  medical  diagnoses.
(Items 9, 10)
The  treatment report  stated  that  Applicant’s  intervention  followed  a  substance  use
specific  protocol,  which  targeted   cessation,  maintenance   of  abstinence,   and   relapse
prevent.  (emphasis added) Acamprosate  was  added  to  his medication  regime  to  aid with
reported cravings. The treatment report further stated:
Upon  discharge, [Applicant]  denies cravings and  urges  to  drink, as well as
withdrawal symptoms.  He expressed  confidence  in his ability to  maintain
abstinence  and  use  relapse  prevention  strategies.   We  recommend that
he   continue   taking  Acamprosate   to   help   with   cravings   and  use   the
skills   that  he   learned  during  admission   to   maintain  abstinence.   We
recommend  he  follows-up  with  outpatient psychotherapy as needed  and/or
at  least  once   every   three   months   to   aid   in  his   recovery.   (emphasis
added) (Item  10  page  28)
Additional  notes   from   the   treatment  report   for  Applicant’s  inpatient  treatment
stated:
We  discharged  [Applicant]  to  his home  on  02.09.2021  without any indication
of  acute   danger   to   himself  or  others  and   free   of  suicidal  tendencies.   We
recommend  the  continuation of  the  medication with  regular  checks  of
the  associated laboratory  parameters  and  the  ECG in the  context of
regular check-ups by  general practitioners  and neurologist.  (emphasis
added) (Item  10  page  30)
In August 2022, Applicant completed government interrogatories. He was asked if
he currently consumed any alcohol and he responded “no.” (Item 9 page 2) He was asked
why he stopped drinking and he stated:
I started  to  drink more often  and  a  little more than  I should  have  during  the
COVID 19  lock down.  I stopped  because  I love  my family and  wife. I decided
to  take  alcohol out of the  equation  and  stop  drinking  for a  healthier  family
lifestyle. (Item  9 page  2)
Applicant  further  disclosed  he  was  taking  medication  to  help  him  abstain  from
drinking  on  an  as  needed  basis.  When  asked  if  he  intended  to  consume  alcoholic
beverages  in  the  future,  he  responded  “no.”  He  disclosed  he  had  inpatient  alcohol
treatment from August 2021 to September 2021 and his aftercare was “as needed” and
there  was  no  follow-up  required.  He  reported  his  last  consumption  of  alcohol  was  in
November or December 2021. This consumption was after his inpatient treatment. (Item
9)
Applicant  completed  government  interrogatories  on  May  7,  2023.  In  them,
Applicant  responded  “yes”  to  the  question  that  asked  if  he  currently  consumed  any
alcoholic beverage. He disclosed he drank one to two Saturdays a month and would have
one  to  two  beers  or  wine  each  time.  He  stated  he  last  consumed  alcohol on  April  29,
2023. He was asked if he had consumed alcohol to intoxication since November 2021
and he said “no.” (Item 10 page 12)
The  SOR  alleged  and  Applicant  admitted  in  his  SOR  answer  and  during  his
background investigation the following:
1.a: In or around January 1983, you were arrested and charged with public intoxication
after the police found alcohol in your vehicle, which you totaled after falling asleep while
driving. (Items 4, 10)
1.b:  In  about  October  1986,  you  were  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI). (Items 2, 3, 10)
1.c: In about October 1989, you were arrested and charged with (1) DUI of liquor or drugs,
and (2) controlled substance, possession prohibited. (Items 5, 9, 10)
1.d: In or about January 1993, you were arrested and charged with DUI. (Item 10)
1.e: In or around October 2001, you were arrested and charged with DUI. (Item 10)
1.f: In or around April 2006, you were arrested and charged with DUI. (Items 7, 10)
Applicant denied SOR ¶ 1.g which alleged that around May 2008, he was arrested
and charged with domestic battery-violence following an altercation with his spouse. Prior
to  the  altercation,  it  is  alleged  he  consumed  approximately  four  to  five  beers  over  the
course  of  a  couple  hours.  He  explained  in  his  SOR  answer  that  the  district  attorney
declined  to  file  charges  or  to  prosecute  because  there  was  insufficient  evidence.  He
admitted he had a marital dispute and the police arrived and it was clear someone was
going to jail, which was him. The police report shows his wife called the police because
she was scared. She later refused to cooperate and testify so the case was dismissed. In
his 2009 background interview, he admitted to consuming four to five beers before the
incident. (Items 4, 10 at page 6)
Applicant denied  in his August 2023 answer to the SOR, the allegation in  ¶ 1.h
which alleged that he received inpatient treatment from about August 2021 to September
2021  for  a  condition  diagnosed  as  Alcohol  Use  Disorder.  Upon  discharge  it  was
recommended that he continue to take prescribed medication to help cravings of alcohol
and  to  abstain  from  consuming  alcohol.  In  his  SOR  answer,  he  admitted  he  received
inpatient treatment in 2021. He said at discharge he was advised to take his medication
for  a  period  of  time  after  discharge,  but  not  to  take  it  indefinitely.  He  explained  the
medication prescribed, Acamprosate, is not for long term use. He was advised to take it
as needed to curb his alcohol cravings. He further stated:  “The issue was stopping the
drinking,  and  that  happened.  More  importantly,  I  have  continued  to  attend  A[lcoholics]
A[nonymous] meetings online  and  have  used  Celebrate  Recovery study aids.”  (Item 2)
The treatment report as noted above states he was to abstain from alcohol consumption
and follow-up as needed or at least every three months. (Item 2)
Applicant  denied  in  his  SOR  answer  ¶  1.i  which  alleged  in  approximately
December  2021  he  resigned  in  lieu  of  being  terminated  from  employment  after  his
supervisor  allegedly  smelled  alcohol  on  his  breath  when  he  reported  to  work.  He
explained in his SOR answer that he was forced to resign because his supervisor made
false  allegations  against  him, and  he  did not want  the allegations  to  negatively impact
him. He adamantly denied the allegation. He told his supervisor that he did not drink on
the day in question and the person he was with that day provided a statement confirming
that  while  in  his  presence,  he  did  not  observe  Applicant  consuming  alcohol.  Applicant
stated he was not afforded the opportunity to defend himself or take a blood test to prove
his innocence, which he believed would have exonerated him. He believes his supervisor
was looking for an excuse to fire him because his employer had tried to reduce his wages
when he was in a contract for a specific wage. There is insufficient evidence to conclude
that Applicant consumed alcohol that day. I find in his favor on this allegation. (Item 2)
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  part  of  1.h  that  alleged  that  he  continues  to
consume alcohol, and that he has failed to take his prescribed medication to help alcohol
cravings and abstention in accordance with his treatment advice and recommendations.
(Item 2)
Applicant stated in his August 2023 SOR answer, “I will admit that [I] struggled in
the past and currently struggle with alcohol, I am an alcoholic and I must work every day
to keep my sobriety. I drink occasionally if we have an event to attend, I will have a beer
or glass of wine.” In addition, he stated: “I am doing what I was taught and keeping myself
sober from excessive alcohol use.” “I will admit it is a daily struggle, but it is one that I am
winning and will continue to win.” He further stated:
I attended  inpatient treatment,  I have  followed  that up  with  continued  after
care  treatment  including   AA   meetings  and   the   Celebrate   Recovery
program.  I  made   the   requisite   changes  and   have   not  had   any   other  law
enforcement  involvement.  This  is a  clear change  from  the  previous  pattern
of DUIs.  (Item  2)
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  supporting  evidence  that  he  is  abstaining  from
alcohol, attends AA, or is in a recovery program. His attorney provided a brief in response
to  the FORM.  It  is dated  November 17, 2023.  Included and attached to the brief  is an
affidavit from Applicant dated November 17, 2022. I believe this is a typographical error
and the affidavit is from 2023. In the affidavit, Applicant
states the following:
I am  in compliance  with  the  treatment that has been  recommended  to  me
by medical professionals for my  previously-diagnosed  alcohol use  disorder.
I have  been  given  permission  to  drink alcohol in reasonable  amounts from
my  medical  providers,  based   on   the   success  of  my  treatment  for alcohol
use disorder.
I no longer have cravings for alcohol.
I am currently abstaining from  using alcohol, and  I am willing  to continue to
do  so  if the  Administrative Judge  believes  it is the  best  way to  minimize  any
security risks I may pose. (AE  A)
Applicant did not provide any supporting documents from a medical professional
telling  him  he  had  permission  to  drink  alcohol  in  reasonable  amounts  based  on  the
success  of  his  treatment.  He  did  not  provide  any  corroborating  evidence  that  he  is  in
compliance  with  his  treatment  plan  for  alcohol  use  disorder.  He  did  not  provide  any
corroborating documentation showing a treatment plan by a medical professional for his
previously diagnosed alcohol use disorder  and that it permits him to consume alcohol.
The only treatment plan submitted was that from his 2021 in-patient treatment.

"Applicant  is  48  years  old.  She  was  previously  married  from  2001  to  2011.  She
married a second time in 2014, and she does not have any children. In 2012, she earned
an associate degree in medical administrative duties and a technical degree in medical
coding. Since January 2020, she has worked for a federal government contractor as a
provider certification analyst. (GE 1)
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant started consuming alcohol around the age of 13. When she was 14 years
old, she was involved in an alcohol-related incident at high school. She and another friend
skipped school that day to drink alcohol. During lunch period, they returned to school and
were caught by a security guard. She was found to be intoxicated. In January 1989, she
was sent to an inpatient adolescent treatment center for approximately six weeks due to
her underage consumption of alcohol. (SOR ¶ 1.e) She resumed drinking alcohol after
treatment, but she also had periods of time she did not use any alcohol at all. (Tr. 19-24)
Applicant  was  arrested   in  November  2005   and   charged   with   operating   while
intoxicated  (OWI). (SOR ¶  1.d)  She  stated  that she  was  drunk and  was driving  fast to  get
home. She was pulled  over by the police for speeding. She  was found  guilty of speeding
and  OWI, was fined, was ordered  to  attend  an  educational substance  abuse  class, and
was  required  to  participate  in an  alcohol and  drug  assessment.  Applicant admitted  that
she  was  drinking alcohol regularly because  she  worked  as a bartender. She  worked  in a
bar seven  days  a  week, and  about half of those  workdays  she  would  drink shots.  (Tr. 27-
31)
Applicant  was arrested  in September 2022 and charged with OWI.  (SOR  ¶ 1.c)
She  was  found  guilty  of  operating  with  a  prohibited  alcohol  concentration.  She  was
ordered  to  complete  a  substance  abuse  assessment,  was  sent  to  an  educational
substance abuse  class,  fined,  and her driver’s  license  was  revoked  for seven  months.
Applicant had been playing darts that night, and she had consumed five or six alcoholic
beverages and some shots. She and her husband got into an argument, and she left the
bar and went to a park. The police stopped her because she was driving in a park that
was closed, and the officers soon realized she was under the influence of alcohol. About
three hours after her arrest, Applicant had a blood test which showed her alcohol tested
at .168%, well above the legal limit. (Tr. 34-41; GE 2)
The SOR alleged that Applicant currently consumes alcohol in excess and to the
point of intoxication, since at least November 2005 until at least May 2023. (SOR ¶ 1.a)
She  admitted  this  in  her  Answer,  however  she  denied  that  she  currently  consumed
alcohol to the point of intoxication three or four times a week. (SOR ¶ 1.b) She listed that
she currently consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication once or twice a week. During
the hearing, Applicant stated that she generally drinks three or four times per week and
that she has between five or six drinks per occasion. She admitted that she consumes
sufficient alcohol to be over the legal limit to operate a vehicle  a couple times a week.
She used to drink vodka, but that made her mean, so she switched to drinking beer. She
has never been referred for treatment following her alcohol assessment, and she does
not  drink  and  drive.  She  does  not  believe  she  has  a  problem  with  her  current  use  of
alcohol. (SOR Answer; GE 2; Tr. 31, 33, 41-44)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant first used marijuana at the age of 12. When she was 16 years old, she
was using marijuana multiple times each day. After her possession of marijuana arrest in
1995 as set forth below, she stopped using marijuana for approximately 10 years. She
resumed  her  use  of  marijuana  again  in  2005  due  to  back  pain.  In  about  2018,  she
switched  from  using  marijuana  to  using  “Delta-8,”  which  she  purchased  from  a  gas
station.  The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  H
that  Applicant  had  used
marijuana/tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) with varying frequency from about August 1987
until at least March 2023. (SOR ¶ 2.a) She denied this allegation in her SOR Answer. She
currently has several health issues involving pain, so she intended to use Delta-8 to help
her sleep in the future. She believed the use of Delta-8 was lawful, and her continued use
does  not  adversely  impact  her  trustworthiness  or  ability  to  perform  her  employment
duties.  (Tr. 45-46, 49-53, 55)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in January 1995 and charged with
felony  possession  with  intent  to  deliver/manufacture  a  controlled  substance,  maintain
premises/vehicle for a controlled substance, and dealer possess a controlled substance.
In March 1995, she was found guilty of a misdemeanor charge and sentenced to a week
of  detention.  Applicant  stated  during  the  hearing  that  the  circumstances  of  the  arrest
occurred  unexpectedly  after  she  returned  to  the  apartment  from  work,  and  the  police
busted  down  the  door.  They  conducted  a  search  and  found  a  little  over  a  pound  of
marijuana in the apartment. She was unaware of the marijuana, and her then husband
explained to Applicant the guy from the apartment below was in trouble and had asked
the husband to hold the marijuana. She denied they were dealers or selling marijuana.
(Tr. 45-49)
SOR  ¶  2.c  alleges  that  Applicant  listed  in  her  January  2023  position  of  trust
application that she intended to continue using marijuana/THC in the future. She admitted
this allegation in her Answer.
After  the   hearing,   Applicant  provided   her  employer’s  “Drug-Free   Workplace
Policy.”  Her  employer’s  policy  prohibits  the   “use   of  any  Controlled   Substance   or  other
illegal  drugs,  including   marijuana   regardless   of  legal  status  under  state   law”  while  the
employee is working for the  employer.  “This Policy does not prohibit employees from the
lawful and  appropriate  use  or possession  of prescribed  medications.  However, because
marijuana  remains an  illegal drug under federal law, its use or possession  is prohibited.”
(AE C)
Character  Evidence
Applicant provided letters from her supervisor and the director of operations. Both
references described Applicant as professional, productive, and a valuable asset to the
team.  Both  references  recommended  Applicant  be  granted  CAC  access  to  continue
supporting the team and contributing to its overall success. (AE A, B)
Administrative Notice
Department Counsel submitted documentation (AN 1) from the U.S. Department
of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), dated February 13, 2023, concerning
the chemical structures of Delta-9 and Delta-8, and the application of federal law. I hereby
take Administrative Notice of the DEA’s findings, as set forth below:
The   Controlled   Substances  Act  (CSA)  classifies  tetrahydrocannabinols
(THC) as controlled  in schedule I.  21  U.S.C. Section  812, Schedule I(c)(17);
21  CFR 1308.11(d)(31). Subject  to  limited  exceptions, for the  purposes of
the   CSA,  the   term   ‘tetrahydrocannabinols’   means  only  those   naturally
contained  in  a  plant of  the  genus cannabis plant…  Delta-9  and  Delta-8 do
not   occur  naturally  in   the   cannabis   plant   and   can   only   be   obtained
synthetically, and  therefore do  not fall  under the  definition  of hemp.  Delta-9
and   Delta-8   are   tetrahydrocannabinols   having   similar chemical  structures
and   pharmacological  activities  to   those   contained   in  the   cannabis   plant.
Thus, Delta-9  and  Delta-8  meet the  definition  of tetrahydrocannabinols, and
they   (and   products   containing   Delta-9   and   Delta-8)   are   controlled   in
schedule  I by  21   U.S.C.  Section   812(c)   Schedule I;   and  21   CFR Section
1308.11(d).

"Applicant,  age  32,  is  divorced  with  one  minor  child.  He  received  a  high  school
diploma  in  2006.  He  has  been  employed  as  an  avionics  technician  by  a  defense
contractor since May 2018. Applicant previously held a security clearance while serving
on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps from October 2007 until September 2017, when
he was discharged under other than honorable conditions. (Item 2)
In 2012, Applicant drove to a friend’s house after a 24-hour work shift to help his
friend with yard work. After completing the yard work, Applicant watched television for a
time and then left to go home. During his drive home, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit
a neighbor’s truck. He  attributed the incident to his lack of  sleep. He  was charged with
reckless driving – wanton disregard. A court found him guilty of the charge. (Item 1; Item
3 at 7).
In 2014, Applicant  consumed four mixed drinks over four and one-half hours while
at  a  restaurant  with  coworkers.  He   then  drove  back  to  base.  Because  he  smelled  of
alcohol  when  he  presented  his  identification  at  the  gate,  he  was  administered  a  field
sobriety test,  which  he failed. He  was also administered a breathalyzer, which registered
a  .14  blood  alcohol   count   (BAC).  He   attributed  the   incident  to   poor  judgment  and
intoxication.  He   received   a  Non-Judicial  Punishment   (NJP)  for  Drunken  or  Reckless
Operation of Vehicle  (Article  111)  under Article  15  of the  Uniform  Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ). The  NJP  resulted in  a reduction in  rank, forfeiture of $2,426,  45 days of restriction
and  extra duty. Applicant’s driver’s license was suspended  for  six  months, and  he was
ordered to take alcohol-education courses.  (Item 1; Item 2 at 21-22, 33-34; Item  3 at 5-6,
8)
In  2017,  Applicant  consumed  six  beers  while  at  a  few  bars  by  himself.  While
walking  outside  one  of  the  bars,  two  men  unknown  to  Applicant  approached  him  and
asked if he wanted to go to a party. Applicant agreed and entered their car, which was
parked in the parking lot outside of the bar. The men offered Applicant cocaine, which he
accepted.  He  felt  sick  after  consuming  the  cocaine  and  immediately  exited  the  car  to
vomit. He then walked back to his car, which had been parked in the same parking lot.
He decided to sleep in his car until morning, and then he drove home for the weekend.
When  he  returned  to  work  the  following  Monday,  he  was  subjected  to  a  random  drug
screening. He tested positive for cocaine. He attributed the incident to being intoxicated.
He  received  an  NJP  for  Wrongful  Use  of  a  Controlled  Substance  (Article  112a)  under
Article 15 of the UCMJ. The NJP resulted in a reduction in rank, forfeiture of $2,534, and
45  days  of  restriction  and  extra  duty.  He  was  subsequently  discharged  from  the  U.S.
Marine Corps under other than honorable conditions for this misconduct. (Item 1; Item 2
at 22, 34-36; Item 3 at 4-6; Item 4)
In  December  2018,  Applicant  consumed  four  mixed  drinks  and  two  to  three  tall
beers while at a bar by himself. He went outside of the bar to retrieve a pack of cigarettes
from his car and decided to leave to go home. While driving home, an officer stopped him
for failure to maintain his lane. After refusing to take a field sobriety test, he was arrested
and  transported  to  the  police  station.  While  at  the  station,  he  was  administered  a
breathalyzer, which registered a .17 BAC. He was then charged with Driving Under the
Influence (DUI) and spent two days in jail. He self-reported the incident to his employer
the day following his release from jail. The charge was scheduled for disposition in April
2019, which was not pronounced in the record.  (Item 1; Item 3 at 12)
There is no mention in  the record of the specific day that Applicant’s December
2018 DUI occurred. Applicant was interviewed on December 4, 2018 (Interview #1) and
December 12, 2018 (Interview #2) in connection with the background investigation of his
security  clearance  application.  He  did  not  discuss  his  December  2018  DUI  during
Interviews  #1  and  #2.  In  April  2019,  he  was  interviewed  specifically  to  discuss  the
December 2018 DUI. There is neither an indication in the record nor any allegation that
he intentionally omitted the December 2018 DUI during Interviews #1 and #2. (Item 3)
Applicant first consumed alcohol in 2008 at age 20. Because it made him sick the
first time, he did not consume it again until his 21st birthday. From ages 21 through 25,
he consumed approximately six beers once per week. From age 25 through September
2017, he consumed approximately 12 beers two times per week. From September 2017
through at least December 2018, he consumed six beers two times per week. Applicant
admitted that he consumed alcohol to intoxication twice per month between age 21 and
December 2018. He defined intoxication as slurred speech and stumbling. He estimated
that it takes approximately eight beers for him to become intoxicated. Applicant does not
feel  that  he  has  a  problem  with  alcohol.  He  has  not  had  any  alcohol  counseling  or
treatment. He has no intent to drive under the influence in the future. (Item 3 at 8, 12)
Applicant acknowledged that his 2017 cocaine use was “wrong and stupid” and
vowed never to use it or any other illegal drugs again. He asserted that he used cocaine
only once, but admitted that he used marijuana two times in 2006. He has no intent to
use any  illegal  drugs  in the  future because of the  negative effect it  had on his  military
career, his life, and prospective employment opportunities. (Item 2 at 35-36; Item 3 at 8)
