"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  (Answer),  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations
except SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.a, and 2.b, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact. He is 29 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was engaged to
be  married  to  his  girlfriend  of  11  years,  who  is  the  mother of  their  two  minor  children.
(Answer; Tr. at 11-14, 47-48, 77, 91-97, 115, 124-125, 135-140, 144-146; GE 1)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2008. He earned an associate’s degree
in 2016 and a bachelor’s degree in 2018. As of the date of the hearing, he has worked
as  an  information  technology  help  desk  analyst  for  his  current  employer,  a  DOD
contractor,  since  November  2017.  He  also  worked  as  a  part-time  children’s  football
official since 2008. He has never held a security clearance. (Tr. at 9-10, 15, 47, 89-91,
96-97, 135-138; GE 1; AE A)
In  approximately  May  2009,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving
under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs, first offense, and purchase or possession
of  alcohol.  He  was  18  years  old.  This  was  his  first  criminal-related  offense.  He  was
driving  a  friend  to  7-11  when  the  police  pulled  him  over  for  a  broken  tail  light.  He
testified  that  he  had  previously  been  at  a  party  where  he  had  taken  a  sip  of  a  drink
thinking it was juice, but when he realized it contained alcohol he “tried to quickly spit it
out.” His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .002%. The charges were nolle prossed. He
testified that his attorney told him and his father that they did not have to worry  as the
case was closed. (SOR ¶ 1.a; Tr. at 48-52, 56-57, 97-106; GE 1-4)
In approximately May 2010, when Applicant was 19 years old, the charge of DUI
of  alcohol  or  drugs,  as  set  forth  above,  was  reinstated,  to  his  surprise.  He  was
represented  by  an  attorney,  and  this  case  was  consolidated  with  his  December  2010
charge  of  marijuana  possession  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  2.b),  as  discussed  below.  Applicant
testified  that  his  attorney  advised  him  to  plead  guilty,  because  he  could  not  afford  to
fight the charge and he did not want to delay his efforts at the time to enlist in the U.S.
military. He pled guilty to DUI of alcohol or drugs in February 2011, and was sentenced
to 60 days in jail, suspended, fined $500, and his driver’s license was suspended for 12
months. (SOR ¶ 1.a; Tr. at 48-52, 56-57, 97-110; GE 1-4)
In  approximately  December  2010,  at  age  20,  Applicant  was  charged  with
marijuana  possession.  He  testified  that  at  his  sister’s  request,  he  drove  to  a  fast  food
restaurant to buy her food, using her car as he did not own a car at the time, when he
was pulled over by the police for failure to yield. The police officer found an empty bag
in the car and claimed it was an “empty marijuana pack.” Applicant testified that though
he was aware that his sister smoked marijuana on occasion, he was unaware that she
had any marijuana-related paraphernalia in the car. He was given a ticket to show up to
court. He was represented by an attorney, and this case was consolidated with his May
2010 charge of DUI alcohol or drugs (SOR ¶ 1.a), as set forth above. He testified that
his attorney told him he was just getting a ticket. In February 2011, he also pled guilty to
the amended charged of paraphernalia possession. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail
with 85 days suspended, placed on unsupervised probation for 3 years, and fined $416.
He spent about a weekend in jail. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.b; Tr. at 52-60, 103-110; GE 1, 5)
In  approximately  May  2011,  at  age  20,  Applicant  was  charged  with  marijuana
possession,  driving  with  a  suspended  or  revoked  license,  and  driving  with  a  defective
brake light, all of which occurred on a military base. He testified that he was pulled over
on the base in which he worked while smoking a Black & Mild cigar. He testified that the
cigar did not contain marijuana, and he believed the police pulled him over because of
racial  profiling,  as  he  is  an  African  American  man.  He  testified  that  the  car  he  was
driving was a relative’s car, as he still did not own a car at the time, and the police found
marijuana in the car. Applicant denied that the marijuana belonged to him and testified
that he was unaware of any marijuana present in the car. He was given a ticket to show
up  to  court.  He  was  represented  by  a  court-appointed  attorney.  He  testified  that  he
underwent random pre-trial drug testing for five to six months, and approximated that he
was  drug  tested  five  to  ten  times  during  this  period.  He  pled  guilty  in  a  federal  district
court  to  the  infraction of  driving  without a  valid  operator’s  license and  was  fined  $100;
the remaining charges were dismissed. (SOR ¶ 1.c; Tr. at 58-63, 110-116; GE 6-7)
Applicant attributed his criminal involvement from 2009 to 2011 to not fulfilling his
father’s expectations after he graduated from high school. He described his father, who
is honorably retired from the U.S. military, as an “accomplished” man, and he felt like he
was  a  disappointment.  He  “got  depressed.”  He  testified  that  he  was  young,  he  made
mistakes trying to find himself, and he associated with the wrong crowd. (Tr. at 46-48,
77, 91-97, 115, 135-140, 144-146; AE A)
In approximately December 2014, at age 24, Applicant was charged with stealing
from a military  exchange  an  iPhone  USB  charging  cable  and a  pair  of  gloves,  with  an
aggregate value of less than $1,000, and assaulting an employee of the exchange.  He
was at the commissary visiting his mother, who worked there. He testified that he was
hurriedly shopping, without a cart and while on his phone, when he accidentally walked
out of  the exchange  with  a $10  cellular phone  charger  before  paying  for it, as  he  was
rushing  to  get  home  to  his  pregnant  fiancée.  When  he  then  attempted  to  pay  for  the
charger,  he  was  not  permitted  to  do  so.  He  denied  assaulting  any  employee  of  the
exchange. He was handcuffed and then released and given a ticket to show up to court.
He  testified  that  he  consulted  with  a  private  attorney,  but  elected  to  accept  a  court-
appointed  attorney  instead.  In  March  2015,  he  pled  guilty  in  a  federal  district  court  to
theft of government property and was sentenced to six months of supervised probation
and fined $150.  He  testified  that  he  chose  to  plead  guilty  because  “there  really  wasn’t
nothing I could really do to get around it.” He continued, “I just wanted to move forward.
I accepted it.” (SOR ¶ 1.d; Tr. at 42, 63-67, 115-124; GE 1, 8-9)
In  approximately  August  2015,  at  age  24,  Applicant  was  charged  with  felony
possession with intent to distribute five+ pounds of marijuana, felony transporting five+
pounds of marijuana, and resisting arrest. As of the date of the hearing, this was his last
criminal  offense.  He  stated  the  following  in  his  2017  security  clearance  application
(SCA):
An  unknown  package  arrived  at  my  parents[’]  home.  I  wrote  [“]wrong
address[”] on the package without opening the package. At this point I am
completely unaware of what the package contained. I put the package in
my  car  with  intentions  to  return  it  to  the  post  office.  I  am  unaware  that
there  were  unmarked  police  cars  parked  around  my  neighborhood
watching me. By the time I drove to the end of my street, I was pulled over
by  several  police  officers.  I  was  taken  to  the  police  station  and  was
informed  the  package  contained  marijuana.  I  cooperated  with  the  police
hoping  to  find  [anyone]  who  could  have  used  my  address  without  my
knowledge or consent. I was the one who suffered being charged for this
offense I had no intentions of committing.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-78, 124-135, 140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A)
Applicant reiterated the same narrative at hearing. He testified that this incident
occurred  in  April  2015.  At  the  the  time,  he,  his fiancée,  and  his  children  lived  with  his
parents in their home. He testified that when the police took him to his parents’ home,
where he was observed to have received the package and after they stopped him as he
was  en  route  to  the  post  office,  they  entered  the  home  aggressively  to  search  it.  He
testified that the police assumed he would be resistant because of his size, and things
got  “crazy”  because  everyone  in  the  home  at  the  time,  to  include  his  mother  and
fiancée, demanded that the police show them their search warrant. He testified that the
police  did  not  find  anything  in  the  home.  He  stated  in  his  SCA  and  testified  that  the
federal  authorities  told  him  they  did  not  believe  he  was  involved  with  the  marijuana
package  and did not pursue  criminal charges  against him,  but  county  authorities  were
looking for a conviction and he fit the bill.  He testified that the county had a conviction
rate  of  approximately  97%,  and  he  believed  his  ethnicity  factored  into  their  pursuit  of
criminal  charges  against  him,  which  did  not  occur until  approximately  six  months  after
the  incident,  in  August  2015;  Applicant’s  father  echoed  the  same  sentiment  in  the
reference letter he wrote for Applicant. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-78, 124-135,
140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A)
Applicant  was  represented  by  an  attorney.  He  pled  guilty  to  possession  with
intent to distribute five+ pounds of marijuana. He testified that he did so because he was
scared and  he  did not  believe  he  had another choice,  as  his attorney  told  him  that  he
was facing five to ten years in jail, his attorney’s fees were $25,000, and he had to think
about  his  young  family.  He  testified  that  his  attorney  advised  him  to  plead  guilty
because “it’s about the jury and the area you’re living in and the county of how you look,
you fit the profile.” He testified that his attorney told him that “if you plead guilty, you can
start fresh  and  you  can  start  your  life  over.”  He  also  testified  that  he  believed  he  was
pleading  guilty  to  a  misdemeanor,  because  he  was  told  such  by  his  attorney.  The
charge of “resisting arrest” was dropped because he was compliant. He was sentenced
to  10  years  in  jail,  with  9  years  and  1  month  suspended,  his  driver’s  license  was
suspended  for  six  months,  and  he  was  fined  $628;  the  remaining  charges  were  nolle
prossed. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-87, 124-135, 140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A)
Applicant served 10 months in jail, from May 2016 to March 2017. He was  then
placed  on  work  release  and  required  to  report  in  person  to  his  probation  officer  once
monthly.  After  several  months,  his  in-person  probation  requirement  was  switched  to
once every three months; it was then lifted and he was required to simply  call into his
probation officer once monthly. He testified that he was drug tested during the period in
which  he  was  on  probation,  initially  once  every  three  months  and  then  randomly.  He
completed  probation  in  August  2018.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  2.b;  Tr.  at  38-46,  67-87,  124-135,
140-141; GE 1, 10-11)
In approximately March 2017, at age 26, Applicant was found by a federal district
court to have violated his federal probation from his March 2015 conviction for theft of
government  property  (SOR  ¶  1.d),  as  a  result  of  his  August  2015  felony  charges,  as
discussed  above  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  2.b).  His  federal  probation  was  revoked  and  he  was
sentenced  to  15  days  in  jail,  with  credit  for  time  served.  He  served  this  time  in
conjunction with the 10 months that he served from 2016 to 2017. (SOR ¶ 1.f; Tr. at 78-
79, 134-135, 140-141; GE 12-14)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  unaware  at  the  time  that  his  guilty  pleas  to  the
charges  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  to  1.e  equated  to  admissions  of  guilt.  He  testified  that  he  was
also unaware that he was developing a criminal record as a result of his guilty pleas. He
testified  that  he  only  began  to  understand  the  meaning  of  his  guilty  pleas  when  he
started  the  security  clearance  process  in  approximately  2017.  He testified  that  had  he
truly understood, he would have taken a “different approach” and he “would have fought
for more than just always pleading, pleading, pleading.” (Tr. at 108-110, 144-146)
Applicant used marijuana at least two to three times in approximately April 2014.
He testified that this was the first time he used marijuana, and  he experimented with it
socially with friends. He stated in his SCA that he did not intend to use marijuana in the
future  because  he  has  two  children  to  support,  he  planned  on  marrying,  and  he
intended  to  continue  his  career  in  information  technology.  He  denied  using  marijuana
after  April  2014,  and  denied  using  it  in  April  2017.  He  testified  that  he  could  not  have
used marijuana in 2017 because he was being drug tested as part of his probation for
his felony conviction (SOR ¶ 1.e), as discussed above. He testified that he had not been
drug tested since he completed probation in August 2018, and he had not yet been drug
tested  by  his  current  employer  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  He  testified  that  he  no
longer socialized with the individuals with whom he used marijuana in 2014. He testified
that if he were ever to find himself in a situation where illegal drugs were being used, or
legal drugs were being misused, he would leave. (SOR ¶ 2.a; Tr. at 79-89, 93-94, 107-
108, 141-142; GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  a  “different  person.”  He  acknowledged  the
mistakes he made in his past, but stressed that “I wake up and do everything differently.
I  got  kids  that  look  up  to  me.”  He  stated  that  he  took  “full  responsibility  and
accountability [for] each of these situations and encounters I have ever had with the law
enforcement.”  Since  he  began  working  for  his  employer  in  November  2017,  he  has
received two pay increases and earned $40,000 annually as of the date of the hearing.
He testified that he has not had  any unfavorable issues at work and his employer was
aware  of  his  criminal history.  He  was  rated  favorably  in  his  2018  performance  review.
He earned a grade point average of 3.8 with his bachelor’s degree. He moved out of his
parents’ home in 2018 and has since rented a home for himself, his fiancée, and their
children. He testified that he is a family man, and he spends time with  them during his
free time. (Tr. at 77, 91-97, 115, 135-140, 144-146; AE A)
Applicant’s father described him as a “good man who has gone through the many
challenges that many of America’s young black men  [go] through . . . .” Having held a
security  clearance  and  worked  as  a  security  manager  during  his  military  career,  his
father stated that Applicant’s character was evidenced by the trust he has earned from
the  various  individuals  who  provided  references  on  his  behalf.  His  coworker  of  two
years  attested  to  his  work  ethic,  professionalism,  timeliness,  and  positivity.  His  former
high-school basketball coach described him as a dedicated family man of strong moral
character. Several other individuals who have known Applicant for a number of years, to
include one who has known him since 1998 and another who has been a fellow referee
since  2014,  reiterated  that  Applicant  possessed  the  character  and  trustworthiness  to
hold a security clearance. (AE A).
",True
"Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations.  She  is  a  34-year-old  senior  software
engineer employed by a defense contractor since December 2012. She seeks to retain
the clearance she was first issued in April 2009 (GE 1).
Applicant used several illegal drugs from about April 2004 to at least March 2015,
a fact she disclosed on her June 2016 clearance application (SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.c.) (GE 1).
At  the  time,  she  stated  that  she  used  cocaine  or  crack  cocaine  and  stimulants3  about
twice a year between October 2008 and March 2015, when she got together with a long-
distance friend, who provided the drugs; she also stated that she used marijuana about
eight times per year with a long-distance friend who provided it, or with a sibling. Applicant
stated that her marijuana use during this period was with her sisters when she was home
on family visits. She used the marijuana to be sociable
During  an  October  2017  interview  with  a  Government  investigator  (GE  2),  she
clarified that her cocaine and ecstasy use occurred at social gatherings, clubs, or raves.
While she named the individual who provided the drugs, she also made it clear that the
drug use was with a larger circle of friends. She stated that she used the drugs out of
social pressure, but stopped because she realized that she was risking her job and her
clearance. She acknowledged using these drugs at two different employers, while cleared
(SOR 1.e.), and knew that there was a no-tolerance drug policy at one of them. Applicant
also  disclosed  that  she  was  arrested  in  June  2010  and  charged  with  marijuana
possession (SOR 1.d.), but was tried and acquitted in January 2011 (AE F).
However,  Applicant  was  also  interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in
February 2009, as part of an earlier background investigation (GE 2). She described using
ecstasy  once  in  April  2004,  using  cocaine  twiceConce  in  April  2007  and  once  in  May
2008,  using  psychedelic  mushrooms  once  in  July  2007,  and  using  cannabis  about  88
times  between  June  2004  and  June  2008.  She  used  cannabis  with  her  siblings  and
others. She stated that she bought cannabis about one-third of the times she used, and
sometimes  gave  away  or  sold  the  drug  to  friends.  She  stated  that  she  would  not  use
cannabis again because of the risks to her job and clearance.
Applicant  executed  a  statement  of  intent  regarding  future  drug  use  as
contemplated by the Directive (Answer, AE F). She underwent a drug screen in March
2019 that tested negative for six categories of illegal drugs (AE F).
Applicant acknowledged that her poor decisions reflect adversely on her judgment,
but  attributes  them  to  her  youth,  some  traumatic  life  experiences,  and  peer  pressure.
3Amphetamines, speed, crystal meth-amphetamines, ecstasy, etc.
However, she notes that she no longer associates with the friend who previously supplied
the drugs when they got together, and she has sharply reduced the number of times per
year that she returns home for family events. And she absents herself from the gathering
if any of her siblings produce marijuana.
Applicant=s character referencesCa coworker and social acquaintance, her uncle,
a long-time friend and former coworker, and an intermittent boyfriend (AE G)Cconsider
her honest and trustworthy, and recommend her for her security clearance. None of them
has seen any indication of illegal drug use, although they have seen the SOR allegations.

"Applicant  is  28  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school,  has  various
certifications, and works as a security technician. He attended some college classes on
a part-time basis. He has been employed  with various companies since approximately
2010.  He  is  in  the  Army  National  Guard.  Applicant  completed  his  latest  security
clearance application (SCA) on January 10, 2017. (GX 1)
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying
frequency,  from  approximately  2009  to  May  2018,  after  being  granted  access  to
classified information in approximately September 2011 (1.a). The SOR further alleges
falsification  in  his  2011  security  clearance  application  (2.a)  and  falsification  about  the
use  of  marijuana  on  his  2016  security  clearance  application  (2.b)  under  Guideline  E.
Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  under  the  guidelines  but  provided  detailed
explanations.  At  the  hearing,  the  Government  moved  to  withdraw  SOR  allegation  2.b
and the motion was granted.
Applicant  testified  that  he  experimented  with  marijuana  in  2009  while  in  high
school. He and a friend smoked marijuana in the custodian’s lounge. He was aware that
smoking  marijuana  was  illegal.  (GX  3)  Applicant  and  his  friend  were  found  by  the
principal and a drug test was administered. Applicant failed the drug test. (Tr. 19) When
Applicant spoke to an army recruiter in 2011, he told him about the marijuana use and
was told to not worry  about it. (AX A, Tr. 13) He does not recall completing a security
clearance application in 2011. He does not recall filling out or submitting any forms that
asked about prior drug use. (Applicant’s Answer to SOR, file)
Applicant recalls that his last drug use was at his  bachelor’s party in May 2018.
(AX B) However, he admitted that he smoked marijuana due to peer pressure perhaps
once  a  week  before  that  time.  He  never bought  the drug  or grew  the product.  (Tr.  21)
He  used  marijuana  in  the  fields  or  woods  with  kids  living  in  his  neighborhood.    He
recalls in 2016, that after he was deployed, he used marijuana with a friend who he still
sees occasionally. He does not feel dependent on the drug. He did not test positive after
that use. (GX 3) He did not take drug education classes. He held a security clearance at
the time of his 2018 marijuana use. (GX 3) He has no future intent to use marijuana.  He
stated that it was a weak moment on his part and bad judgement. His family is aware of
his illegal use of marijuana.
Applicant  completed  another  security  clearance  application  in  August  2016.  He
answered  “No”  to  Section  23  -  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity  Illegal  Use  of
Controlled  substances  in  the  last  seven  (7)  years.  (SOR  2.b)  Have  you  ever  illegally
used a controlled substance while possessing a security clearance.? He did not list the
marijuana use as alleged and admitted in SOR 1.a.
Applicant  stated  that  when  he  was  investigated  he  spoke  to  the  investigator
about  the  marijuana  use.  He  realizes  that  the  use  of  marijuana  would  reduce  his
employment  opportunities  and  present  hardship  to  his  family.  (Tr.  46)  He  did  not
intentionally  try  to mislead  the  Government. He  apologizes for the situation and  states
that since 2009, he was up-front with the Army recruiter about the 2009 marijuana use.
He also told an investigator about the incident in 2016. In 2018, he reached out to the
investigator  and  told  him  of  his  use  of  marijuana  at  his  bachelor  party  in  2018.  He
realized  that  it  was  a  selfish  mistake  to  accept  the  marijuana  at  the  party.  He  was
credible in his testimony. He has not had any drug counseling.
Applicant submitted three character references from military personnel who have
worked with him. Each attests to his polite and respectful manner, strong character and
judgment. (AX C) Applicant has worked for the Government in a military and contracting
capacity and has shown great pride in his work and an ability to lead.

"Applicant is almost 34, single, and has no children. He was the valedictorian of his
high school class. In 2008, he received a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and aerospace
engineering. In 2010, he received a master’s degree in aerospace engineering. Applicant
received prestigious grants to attend both universities, which are among the best in the
United  States.  Since  December  2015,  he  has  worked  as  a  research  engineer  for  a
defense  contractor  at  a  research  facility.  He  applied  for  his  first  security  clearance  in
March 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 14-23)
Applicant admitted, with explanation, all of the SOR allegations, including: using
and  purchasing  3,4-methylenedioxy-mehtaphetamine  (MDMA)  between  January  and
August 2017; selling one MDMA pill in May 2017; and using marijuana in 2011, 2012, and
2016. He also admitted to falsifying his March 2017 SCA and making false statements
during his October 2017 personal subject interview (PSI).
On March 1, 2017, Applicant submitted his SCA, and he disclosed no involvement
with illegal drugs. When he completed the SCA, he understood that it was important to
tell  the  truth.  He  did  not  disclose  his  drug  use  because  he  was  concerned  that  any
disclosure  of  drug  use  would  prevent  him  from  obtaining  government  employment,  in
particular because he is a minority. He also felt pressure to complete the SCA quickly.
(Answer; GE 1 at 39-40; Tr. 26-28, 45-48, 51-52)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  October  2017,
November  2017,  and  May  2018.  During  his  first  PSI  on  October  20,  2017,  Applicant
affirmatively denied any drug use. In doing so, he failed again to disclose his illegal drug
involvement, and he also provided false information to the investigator. (GE 1 at 39-40;
GE 2 at 2-3, 9)
Applicant testified that he did not appreciate or understand the seriousness of the
security clearance process until his initial interview in October 2017. He explained that
after  the  initial  interview,  he  conducted  research  regarding  lying  in  a  SCA  and  during
government interviews. He then realized that drug use and lying in SCAs is a “big deal.”
(Tr. 28-31)
On November 15, 2017, Applicant called the investigator and requested that the
investigator  not  contact  his former  girlfriend. She  was  a  listed  contact  in  his SCA, and
they  had  recently  ended  their  relationship.  Applicant  was  concerned  about  what  she
would say about him and how it could hurt his chances of obtaining a security clearance.
The investigator told Applicant that because his girlfriend was listed as a source in his
SCA, interviewing her was not optional. (GE 2 at 11-12, Tr. 53-57, 76)
Two days after his request to the investigator, Applicant called the investigator and
confessed to using drugs, failing to disclose his drug use, and asked for a subsequent
interview. Several days later, on November 21, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed by the
investigator.  He  disclosed  that  he  used  marijuana  once  in 2011 and  once  in  2012.  He
also consumed edible marijuana in the spring of 2016. All of his marijuana use occurred
at parties. He also disclosed that in early 2017, he purchased MDMA pills from a website
because he was interested in neuroscience and the affect MDMA has on the brain. He
used  MDMA  5  to  10  times,  and  sold  an  MDMA  pill  one  time  at  a  party  in  May  2017.
Applicant told the investigator that his drug use was not habitual or detrimental to his life,
and that he did not think he had to disclose it.  During a subsequent PSI in May 2018,
Applicant disclosed that he used MDMA from early 2017 until the summer of 2017. (GE
2 at 13-14, 17-18; Tr. 33-35, 53-57, 68)
In October 2018, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories regarding his drug
use. He certified the accuracy (with one minor change) of all three of his PSIs. He also
completed a worksheet, in which he claimed that he used marijuana only one time, and
affirmed that he used MDMA 5 to 10 times in 2017. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 58)
At the hearing, Applicant initially acknowledged that he used marijuana only one
time in 2012, and that he used MDMA only 3 to 4 times in 2017. Additionally, for the first
time, he claimed that all of his MDMA use occurred after he completed his SCA in March
2017, and therefore, he did not fail to disclose his MDMA use in his SCA. Upon further
questioning, he admitted purchasing 10 MDMA pills, using MDMA 4 times with his former
girlfriend  and  once  by  himself  at  a  party,  and  using  marijuana  a  total  of  three  times.
Applicant claimed the discrepancy regarding his marijuana use was due to forgetfulness
and was unintentional. He asserted that he decided to experiment with MDMA due to his
educational background in neuroscience and philosophy. (Tr. 32-36, 49-51, 58, 66)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  maintained  that  he  continued  to  use  MDMA  after  he
completed his SCA, because he wanted to try it, and “it was gone from his mind” that drug
use was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. However, he also acknowledged
that at the same time he was concerned that if his employer learned he had used drugs
his employment would be in jeopardy. As of the hearing, Applicant had not reported his
2016  marijuana  use  and  2017  MDMA  use  to  his  FSO  or  supervisor,  because  he  was
afraid it would negatively impact his ability to get a clearance, maintain his employment,
and damage his reputation. Applicant has not been subjected to any urinalyses through
his current employment, but his employer does have a policy prohibiting the use of illegal
drugs. (Tr. 44, 66-69, 76)
Applicant’s  supervisor,  who  submitted  a  letter  of  recommendation,  has  known
Applicant for four years in a professional capacity. His letter indicated he is aware that
Applicant used drugs approximately when he was in his early teens, but he is unaware
that Applicant used drugs since he has known him. Applicant’s supervisor recommended
him for a clearance. Additionally, Applicant submitted a letter of recommendation from a
friend. Both letters of recommendation described Applicant as responsible, reliable, and
trustworthy. (AE A; AE B; Tr. 23, 69)
Applicant testified that he has not used MDMA since the summer of 2017, because
his curiosity was satisfied, and he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He
has friends that continue to use marijuana, but he avoids being around them when they
use  drugs.  While  in  college,  Applicant  volunteered  as  a  tutor.  Applicant  is  currently
applying to become an Air Force Reserve Officer. (GE 2 at 15, 18; Tr. 38, 41-43)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  the  marijuana  use  allegations  (SOR  1.a-1.b  and  2.a),  but
denied  the  falsification  allegations  (SOR  2.b-2.c).  He  is  a  46-year-old  software
engineering manager employed by a defense contractor since August 2003; he has been
employed in related positions since 1996. He married in August 1995, and he and his wife
have a son, born June 2010; they have since separated. Applicant seeks to retain the
clearance he was first issued in May 1996.
In July 2012, after completing a marathon, Applicant used marijuana with a friend
he had met at their running club. At the time, he held a clearance and was aware that any
illegal drug use was inconsistent with holding a clearance. He later used marijuana with
his wife=s family members after a brewery tour around Thanksgiving 2015. He reported
these two instances of marijuana use on his March 2017 clearance application (GE 2).
However,  he  placed  his  first  use  of  marijuana  in  July  2008,  a  date  he  later  confirmed
during  a  May  2018  interview  with  a  Government  investigator  (GE  3).  Based  on  this
evidence,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  falsified  his  March  2012  clearance
application (GE 1).
Nevertheless,  Applicant  testified  (Tr.  27-29;  37-40)  that  he  had  used  marijuana
after the marathon in July 2012, not in July 2008, when he did not run that marathon. The
friend with whom he used the marijuana provided the particulars of that use, including the
fact  that  it  occurred  in  July  2012,  not  July  2008  (AE  B).  She  was  the  only  witness  to
Applicant=s marijuana use on that occasion. She reports having been interviewed as part
of Applicant=s 2018 background investigation.
Applicant=s Answer to the SOR acknowledges the poor judgment demonstrated by
his past illegal marijuana use but provides substantial documentation that this illegal drug
use was an aberration in his life. He has an excellent work history (Answer, Exhibit B, C),
and has received significant financial recognition from his employer (Answer, Exhibit A).
His  coworkers  consider  him  honest  and  trustworthy  and  recommend  him  for  his
clearance. They are aware of the SOR allegations (Answer, Exhibit D). Another long-time
friend from his running club similarly recommends him for his clearance (AE A). He has
executed a statement providing for immediate revocation of his clearance for future drug
use, as contemplated by the Directive (Answer, Exhibit E; AE C). In February 2019, he
had a favorable drug screening by a certified substance abuse counselor, albeit by live
video feed (Answer, Exhibit F). He is a fitness devotee (Answer, Exhibit G).
Applicant acknowledged that his poor decisions reflect adversely on his judgment,
but  attributes  them  to  spur-of-the-moment  decisions  made  in  one  instance  after  a
strenuous  physical  accomplishment,  and  in  the  other  after  a  family  outing  involving
alcohol. He notes that continued drug use is inconsistent with his fitness lifestyle, and he
will have little contact with his soon-to-be-ex-wife=s family.

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 2.a,
and 2.b. (HE 3) He denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating and
mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  avionics  equipment  specialist  working  for  a  defense
contractor for the past two years. (Tr. 7, 9; GE 1) In 2003, he graduated from high school,
and he completed three years of college. (Tr. 7-8) He served in the Air Force from 2004
to 2008. (Tr. 8) When he was discharged from the Air Force, he was a senior airman, and
he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 8) His Air Force specialty was nuclear cruise
missile maintenance technician. (Tr. 9) For most of his Air Force service, he had a top
secret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI). (Tr. 9) He
was married from 2006 to 2012, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 8)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that from about 2003 until at least October 2014, Applicant used
marijuana with varying frequency. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that from about March 2005 until
June  2008,  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  while  holding  a  security
clearance. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that from about  March 2012 until at least October 2014,
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency while employed in a position of public
trust.  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c  explaining  that  his  marijuana  use  was
limited to June and July 2014. (HE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that from about June 2014 to July 2014, Applicant purchased
marijuana with varying frequency. SOR ¶ 1.e alleges that in about May 2014, Applicant
was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  and  possession  of
marijuana while operating a motor vehicle. (GE 8 at 1) In May 2014, Applicant had a drink
of alcohol before he started driving home. (Tr. 24) A police officer said he crossed the
center line. (Tr. 24) He also had an open container of alcohol in his vehicle. (Tr. 24) The
police officer searched Applicant and found marijuana in his possession. (Tr. 24; GE 1 at
33) He also had a small glass marijuana pipe in his vehicle. (Tr. 25) He was not charged
with an alcohol offense. When he went to court, he received deferred adjudication for one
year,  and  his  record  was  expunged  after  one  year.  (GE  1)  Applicant  said  he  used
marijuana  three  or four  times  in  May  2014.  (Tr.  23,  25-26)  He  insisted  he  did  not  use
marijuana before May 2014. (Tr. 26) He clarified that he used marijuana 10 to 15 times
or  once  or  twice  a  week  from  May  through  July  2014.  (Tr.  35)  He  held  a  public  trust
position when he possessed marijuana. (GE 1 at 33)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  that  in  about  October  2014,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  by  a
licensed addiction  counselor (LAC)  with  a  condition  called  Cannabis  Abuse. The  court
adjudicating  Applicant’s  July  2014  arrest  required  him  to  undergo  a  substance-abuse
evaluation. (Tr. 30) On October 9, 2014, an LAC interviewed Applicant. (Tr. 30) According
to the LAC’s report (also dated October 9, 2014), Applicant told the evaluator:
[Applicant] reports first drinking at age 17 and smoked pot for the first time
at age 18. States he got intoxicated for the first time at age 17 and has been
a regular user since age 18. States he drank three times and smoked pot
once in the last 30 days. States pot is his drug of choice, a bowl once or
twice a day . . . . States the last time he drank was 10-04-14, last time he
smoked pot was about a week and a half ago . . . . States he spends $50.00
to $100.00 a month on using . . . . States . . . pot relaxes him. Denies being
preoccupied  with  the  thought  of using.  [Applicant]  states  his using isn’t  a
problem . . . . States he has four close friends and they all use . . . . States
his mother and father are chemically dependent, they live in [a state where
marijuana] is legal. (GE 5)
The  LAC  indicated  in  Axis  I:  305.20  (Cannabis  Abuse);  and  305.00  (Alcohol
Abuse). (GE 5) The LAC concluded Applicant was “not chemically dependent,” and he
should receive a 16-hour education program. (GE 5)
Applicant  strenuously  disputes  the  LAC’s  description  of  his  marijuana  use;
however, he did not give a reason the evaluator would intentionally lie about the duration
and frequency of Applicant’s marijuana use. (Tr. 33) Applicant suggested the evaluator
“got [his] notes mixed up.” (Tr. 33) He said the LAC may have confused his description of
his alcohol use with his description of his marijuana use. (Tr. 37) Applicant called the LAC
and confronted him with his concerns about the accuracy of his notes. (Tr. 33) Applicant
said  the  LAC  mentioned  his  inability  to  remember  what  Applicant  said  during  the
interview;  however,  the  LAC  refused  to  disavow  the  accuracy  of  his  notes.  (Tr.  33)
Applicant provided a letter from the LAC dated March 28, 2019, which states as follows:
[Applicant]  called  me  on  03-19-19,  concerning  the  alcohol  and  drug
evaluation I did on him on 10-09-14. He was questioning the information in
the evaluation of when he first used marijuana. At the time of the evaluation
he reported first using at age 18. He went on stating in the report that he
used pot in the thirty days prior to 10-09-14, but during the call he assured
me that he didn’t use before 2014. When talking to [Applicant] on 03-19-19,
he  said  he  didn’t  know  if  he  reported  that  information  inaccurately  or  if  I
made a mistake in my documentation. I have no way of knowing if this is
accurate other than looking at the information I received at the time of the
evaluation. If he feels this is inaccurate, I have no other recommendation
for him other than to get another evaluation. (AE C)
Applicant said that he could not have used marijuana when he was on active duty
in the Air Force and held a TS/SCI-level clearance because of the frequency of the Air
Force’s urinalysis testing of those holding TS/SCI-level clearances with access to nuclear
materials. (Tr. 40) He insisted the LAC’s notes were not accurate. (Tr. 40-41)
There is no evidence Applicant tested positive on a urinalysis test for use of illegal
drugs. Applicant denied that he currently possesses any marijuana or drug paraphernalia.
(Tr. 38) He has friends  that  use marijuana; however, they  do  not use marijuana  in  his
presence. (Tr. 39)
Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in  about July 2014, and charged
with  operating  a  vehicle  while  intoxicated.  Applicant  was  sad  or  depressed  about  his
situation after his marijuana-related arrest in May 2014, and he made a bad decision to
drink excessive amounts of alcohol. (Tr. 26-27) In July 2014, he drank eight or nine beers
over a six-hour period. (Tr. 39) The police stopped Applicant’s vehicle for improper lane
change and asked him if he drank any alcohol that day. (Tr. 26, 39; GE 3; GE 6) Applicant
denied that he drank any alcohol to the police officer because he did not want to go to
jail. (Tr. 39; GE 6) Applicant subsequently told the police officer that he only had two or
three drinks. (Tr. 39; GE 6) The preliminary blood alcohol test indicated .129 BAC. (GE 6
at 2) A police officer found an open container of beer in Applicant’s vehicle. (GE 6 at 1)
Upon arrival at jail, the police found marijuana on Applicant’s person. (GE 6 at 1-2) Two
breath tests were administered at the jail with results of .10 and .11 BACs. (GE 6 at 2)
Applicant was not charged with possession of the marijuana found on his person
in July 2014. (GE 3) Applicant pleaded guilty to operating while impaired (OWI), and he
was  sentenced  to  six  months  of  probation,  to  pay  a  fine,  to  have  a  substance-abuse
assessment, and to complete a 16-hour alcohol-treatment class. (GE 1 at 34; GE 6; GE
7) Applicant did not inform his supervisor or security officer of his arrests in May and July
2014. (Tr. 28) He said he did not inform the government of his arrests because of “fear of
losing  my  job.”  (GE  4  at  18)  About  a  year  after  his  second  arrest,  the  government
conducted a  background  check of  contractor  employees  because of  a  security  breach
unrelated to Applicant’s conduct, and his employer discovered his two arrests in 2014.
(Tr. 29) Applicant’s contractor employer fired him. (Tr. 29)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant was diagnosed by an LAC with a condition called
Alcohol Abuse. Applicant consumed alcohol since the age of 17. (Tr. 36) In 2014, he was
drinking alcohol four or five times a week. (Tr. 36)
In Applicant’s September 17, 2018 response to DOHA interrogatories, he said he
consumed two to three drinks, two to three times a month. (GE 4 at 19) The most recent
time he was intoxicated was on September 15, 2018. (GE 4 at 20) Applicant stated at his
hearing that he has dramatically reduced his alcohol consumption to about once every
two months. (Tr. 37) There is no evidence of alcohol-related incidents involving the police
or the courts after July 2014.
Personal Conduct
The  SOR  cross-alleges  in  ¶  3.a  the  same  conduct  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through 1.e above. The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts as follows:
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges Applicant stated that on or about July 5, 2016, he completed an
SCA which asked in Section 23 about whether he used any controlled substance in the
previous seven years. Applicant responded, yes, and said “I had never smoked marijuana
before June 2014. I was introduced to it during a rough period in my life. I only smoked it
a handful of times, and stopped all together in July of 2014.” (GE 1 at 32) He said he
“[e]xperimented  with  it,  only  smoked  10-15  times  between the  beginning  of  June  2014
and the end of July 2014.” (Id.) After his arrests for possession of marijuana and OWI, he
said he “decided it was time to get my life back on track. I was forced to resign my position
due to the charge. My experimental use of marijuana did damage to my life as a whole,
and I will never use it again.” (Id.)
SOR ¶ 3.c alleges Applicant stated that on or about October 19, 2017, during an
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  personal  subject  interview  (PSI),  he  used
marijuana 10 to 15 times between June and July 2014. (GE 3 at 4) He specifically denied
any marijuana use prior to June 2014. (GE 3 at 4) He said he purchased marijuana once,
and the other times he received marijuana without purchasing it. (GE 3 at 4-5)
SOR  ¶  3.d  alleges  Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  on  or  about
September 17, 2018, and he denied that he used marijuana except for 10 to 15 times
between June and July 2014. (GE 4) He said in his DOHA interrogatories that from April
2014 to July 2014, he used marijuana two to four times a week. (GE 4 at 9) He also said
he “bought small amounts of marijuana for personal use from April 2014  – July 2014.”
(GE 4 at 9) He concluded, “I only started smoking marijuana well after I was divorced. I
smoked a handful of times over a few month period in 2014. I stopped because marijuana
was not the way to deal with my problems.” (GE 4 at 11)
Applicant failed to disclose or admit the full duration and frequency of his marijuana
use  as  indicated  in  the  October  9,  2014  substance-abuse  evaluation  in  the  drug
involvement and substance misuse section of this decision, supra. Applicant told the LAC
on October 9, 2014, he used marijuana “once in the last 30 days” or about 10 days before
his interview. (GE 5)
Character Evidence
Six coworkers, colleagues, and/or friends as well as his former spouse provided
character  statements  supporting  reinstatement  of  Applicant’s  access  to  classified
information. (AE B; AE D-I) His character evidence includes statements from persons who
are  honorably  retired  after  many  years  of  military  service,  senior  noncommissioned
officers on active duty, and highly trained technicians and managers. The general sense
of  their  statements  is  that  Applicant  is  diligent,  knowledgeable,  intelligent,  meticulous,
professional, generous, loyal, honest, a good leader, and trustworthy. (AE B; AE D-I) His
hard  work  and  professionalism  made  substantial  contributions
to  mission
accomplishment. (AE B; AE D-I) None of his character statements described any abuse
of  alcohol  or use  of  illegal  drugs  by  Applicant.  (AE  B-AE  D-I)  There  is  no  evidence  of
security  violations,  improper  disclosure  of  classified  information,  or  that  Applicant
compromised national security.

"Applicant is 41 years old, has never married, and has no children. He earned a
bachelor’s degree in 2000, and held a Top Secret clearance during 2001 and 2002 while
working  for  a  defense  contractor.  He  applied  for  a  trustworthiness  determination  after
starting  his  current  position  with  a  major  technology  company  in  March  2015.  He  has
never served in the military or worked in the Federal civil service. (GE 1; Tr. 6, 8, 29.)
Applicant first used marijuana while  attending college. In October 1998, he was
arrested by a local police department there for possession of marijuana. He successfully
completed a yearlong period of probation and community service, after which the charge
was dismissed. (GE 2; Tr. 29-30.)
Applicant did not use marijuana between 1998 and 2009. From June 2009 to April
2016, as it became decriminalized and ultimately legalized under the laws of his current
state of residence, he recreationally smoked marijuana with a frequency that varied from
monthly  to  daily,  but  also  included  many  months  with  no  use.  Before  sales  in  state-
licensed  stores  began,  he  purchased  small  amounts  for  personal  use  from  various
friends. He ceased use in April 2016 when informed that he would need to submit an e-
QIP for national security eligibility, but he resumed smoking marijuana once or twice a
month  after hearing  nothing  from  the  Office  of  Personnel Management  (OPM)  or DoD
CAF for over two years. He acknowledged that this was a bad choice on his part, and he
voluntarily stopped all marijuana use after having smoked it twice during July 2018. (GE
1; GE 2; Tr. 30-40.)
When  finally  interviewed  by  an  OPM  investigator  on  September  14,  2018,
Applicant said that he continued to associate with people who legally, under state law,
use  marijuana  on  occasion.  He  said  that  his  infrequent  use  in  2018  had  taken  place
because  he  did  not  consider its  possible adverse  impact on his employment eligibility,
and involved using small amounts at home for relaxation and enjoyment. Contrary to the
implication of the sentence from the OPM investigator’s summary that was paraphrased
in the SOR, a comprehensive reading of the report confirms Applicant’s hearing testimony
that he stopped marijuana use after July 2018 with the  still-continuing intent to remain
abstinent.  He  did  not  say  that  he  intended  to  continue  marijuana  use.  He  frankly
acknowledged  that  numerous  friends  and  family  members  continue  to  recreationally
smoke marijuana on occasion, but they no longer do so in his presence because they
respect his choice to avoid further involvement with the drug. (GE 2; Tr. 17-18, 27-28, 30-
39.)
Appellant  submitted  five-panel  drug  screen  test  results  for  hair  samples  he
submitted to cover the period from May to September 2019, all of which were negative.
He also submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and
substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for
revocation  of  national  security  eligibility.  He  underwent  a  complete  alcohol  and  drug
evaluation at an established state-licensed treatment and recovery center on September
4,  2019.  The  facility’s  administrator  submitted  a  letter  on  September  17,  2019,
documenting that the evidence from that evaluation did not support a diagnosis of any
substance abuse disorder. (AE A; AE B; AE D.)
A coworker and friend of Applicant’s who has known him for eight years, wrote a
letter  describing  his  excellent  professional  performance  and  personal  character.  The
writer never observed any indication of drug abuse or addiction, and described Applicant
as a reliable, consistent, trusted advisor who performs well in high-pressure situations.
(AE C.) Applicant’s hearing testimony was honest and straightforward. (Tr. 27-42.)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  admitted  the  factual  allegation  in
Subparagraph  1.a.,  but  denied  Subparagraph  1.b.  of  the  SOR,  with  explanations.  He
also  provided  additional  information  to  support  his  request  for  eligibility  for  a  security
clearance.
Applicant is 33 years old, is “single,” works for a defense contractor, and has held
a security clearance “since 2009.” (TR at page 18 line 17 to page 20 line 17.)
Guideline H – Drug Involvement
1.a. Applicant admits he used marijuana in about July of 2017, after having been
granted  a  security  clearance.  (TR  at  page  33  line  16  to  page  34  line  1,  and  GX  2  at
page 6.) This usage was not intentional. (TR at page 22 line 22 to page 32 line 17.) At
the  time  of  the  incident,  Applicant  was  a  heavy  cigarette  smoker.  He  had  run  out  of
cigarettes,  and  took  one  puff  from  a  co-workers  “vape  pen,”  not  knowing  it  contained
marijuana.  Applicant  only  discovered  that  the  vape  pen  contained  marijuana  when  “a
few minutes” later he “felt light-headed.” Only then did the owner of the pen disclose its
contents.  (Id.)    Applicant  self-reported  this  unintentional  usage.  (TR  at  page  39  lines
20~23, and at page 40 line 21 to page 41 line 18.) Applicant’s credibility in this regard is
attested  to  by  former and  present  colleagues  at  work.  (AppX  D.) Furthermore,  he  has
provided  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and
substance misuse in the future. (TR at page 20 line 18 to page 21 line 4, and AppX D.)
This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.b.  Although  Applicant  does  not  remember  the  alleged  usage  more  than  18
years  ago,  I  find  that  he  used  marijuana  twice  in  August  of  2001,  as  disclosed  in  his
February 2007 e-QIP. (TR at page 21 line 5 to page 22 line 21, at page 36 line 20, and
GX 3 at page 23.) This allegation is also found for Applicant.

"Applicant is a 54-year-old single man. He is a veteran of the U.S. Army, serving on
active duty from 1987 to 1990, and in the National Guard from 1990 to 1995. (GE 9; AE I)
While on active duty, he earned an associate’s degree. (Tr. 54) After leaving active duty,
having been discharged honorably, Applicant enrolled in college, completing a bachelor’s
degree  in  1996  and  a  master’s  degree  in  computer science  in  1999.  He  is a software
developer who has been subcontracting with various federal government contractors since
1996. (Tr. 55; GE 1 at 11) Throughout his career, Applicant has been in positions that have
required either a security clearance or public trust eligibility. (Tr. 61)
Applicant is highly respected among his professional peers. According to his current
project supervisor, he has a stellar work ethic, logging long hours to get the job done under
highly stressful situations. (AE H) A project manager for another contractor with whom he
works, characterizes him as an outstanding software developer who “continues to impress
the customer with the quality of his work, his integrity, and his can-do attitude.” (AE H at 3)
Applicant has been using marijuana intermittently since 1982. Although the majority
of his use occurred before 1997, some of his marijuana use since then occurred while he
possessed  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  58)  According  to  Applicant,  he  has  only  used
marijuana twice since 2014.   (Tr. 57)
Since 1996, Applicant has completed three security clearance applications and one
application  for public trust  eligibility. Each application contained a  question concerning
illegal  drug  use  within  the  seven  years  preceding  the  completion  of  the  respective
application.  Applicant  answered  “no”  on  each  application.  (GE  1  –  3;  GE  5)  After
completing the 1996 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed his omission to an
agent before being confronted, explaining that he overlooked the section of the security
clearance application that required the application to be answered with complete honesty.
(GE  9  at  5)  Specifically,  he  told  the  agent  that  when  he  completed  an  application  for
acceptance into the Army in the late 80s, the recruiter told him not to admit past drug use
because  it  could  have  a  detrimental effect  on  his career. (GE 9 at 5) He followed this
advice when he completed the 1996 clearance application.
Between 2007 and 2014, Applicant submitted two security clearance applications
and  an  application  for  a  position  of  trust.  He  omitted  the  marijuana  use  from  each
application, explaining  that the legality of marijuana in several states since the completion
of  the  1996  security  clearance  application  rendered  the  question  of  “illegal”  use  of
marijuana ambiguous. (GE 8 at 2) Marijuana was not legal, nor has it ever been legal in the
state where Applicant used it. (Tr. 59-60)
Applicant continued to use marijuana over the years despite promising during the
course  of  each  previous  investigation  that  he  would  quit.  (Tr. 61-62)  In  January  2020,
Applicant executed an affidavit swearing to abstain from all drug involvement in the future.
(AE J)
As of July 2017, Applicant owed approximately $38,000 in unpaid federal income
taxes. (AE D) Applicant attributes his tax debt to financial problems that began in 2006,
when he overextended himself financially by purchasing a home using a non-traditional
mortgage loan product that he could not afford. (Tr. 15)  The house was underwater for all
11 years that he owned it. (Answer at 6) Furthermore, Applicant testified that his financial
problems stemming from the home were exacerbated in 2008 when the market crashed,
additionally decreasing the home’s value. (Tr. 15)
In 2013, Applicant experienced a brief period of unemployment, which coincided
with the acceleration of the mortgage payments. (GE 6 at 7) Consequently, by the end of
April 2013 Applicant had exhausted his savings, and he was unable to pay his federal
income taxes for 2012. (Tr. 16, 68)  By November 2013, the tax year 2012 income tax debt
had  grown  to  $18,875.  (GE  B)  That  month,  Applicant  began  making  $5,000  monthly
payments through an installment agreement that he negotiated with the IRS. (AE B) By
November 2014, he had satisfied the income tax debt for tax year 2012. (Tr. 70; AE C at
13) Although he had satisfied the 2012 tax delinquency, he had incurred a tax debt for tax
year 2013, which totaled $10,570. (AE C at 14) Per the installment agreement, Applicant’s
2013 income tax debt rolled over automatically to tax year 2014, and has continued to roll
over to successive years after each preceding year’s tax debt is satisfied. (AE C at 14)
Applicant  continues  to  make  payments  on  his  income  tax  debt  through  his
installment agreement. Once he satisfies the tax debt for one year, the IRS then applies
the payments to the successive tax year. (Tr. 71) Applicant’s tax debt spiked in 2017, the
year he short sold his home. (AE C at 14) Since then, he has been paying $1,000 monthly.
Currently, the balance of his tax debt is approximately $16,000. (Tr. 17)
Applicant earns $111,000 annually. (Tr. 73) He anticipates receiving a raise. He will
apply the additional funds to the tax debt.
Applicant is a successful gambler. (Tr. 76) He has mastered the laws of probability
governing table games, minimizing the “house advantage.” (Tr. 76) In 2008, Applicant won
$100,000 through casino gambling. (Tr. 75) In 2012, he won $15,000. (Tr. 76) When asked
on cross-examination about additional gambling winnings, Applicant acknowledged more
winnings, but could not specifically recall the corresponding years, explaining that at “times
[he]  win[s]  $10,000,  there’s  times  [he]  win[s]  $20,000,  [and]  there’s  times  [he]  win[s]
$100,000.” (Tr. 76)
SOR subparagraph 2.e alleges that Applicant falsified his response to Section 26 of
the June 2014 security clearance application when he failed to disclose the outstanding tax
debt from tax years 2012 and 2013. Applicant did not file his 2012  tax return on time.
However,  he  applied  for  an  extension,  negotiated  a  payment  plan,  and  had  begun
executing it in November 2013, six months before he completed the security clearance
application. (AE B)

"Applicant, age 41, has never married nor had children. She has cohabited with her
boyfriend since 2016. She earned a high school diploma in 1996, a bachelor’s degree in
2001, and a master’s degree in 2014. She has been employed as a finance director by a
defense contractor since July 2010. She maintained a DOD security clearance from about
2007 or 2008 until she was laid off by her previous employer in May 2010. (GE 3)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  “purchased  and  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency from approximately January 1998 through at least April 2017.” (SOR ¶ 1.a). It
also alleged that her purchase and use continued to occur after she had been granted a
security clearance in approximately 2008. (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a,
but clarified that she has not purchased marijuana since 2001, only used marijuana twice
after 2003, and has not used marijuana since April 2017. She denied SOR ¶ 1.b on the
basis that she never used marijuana while having an active security clearance. (GE 2)
Applicant began experimenting with marijuana and other illegal drugs during high
school and college. She continued to use marijuana for several years after college. She
estimated  her frequency  of  use  as follows:  cocaine,  10  times  between  June  1995 and
July 2000; marijuana, 30 times between January 1998 and January 2003; and ecstasy,
two times between January 1999 and December 1999. She used them in social settings,
and  received  them  gratis  from  people  with  whom  she  was  socializing.  She  purchased
marijuana only on a “few” occasions, and never in mass quantities or for the purpose of
redistributing it. She stopped using marijuana in 2003 because she matured and decided
that it did not benefit her in anyway. After she stopped using marijuana, she intentionally
avoided situations where marijuana was present. She had no intent to use marijuana or
other illegal drugs in the future. (GE 5 at 35-36; GE 6)
Applicant used marijuana on two occasions after 2003, once while on vacation on
an  unspecified  date  in  2014  and  once  at  music  festival  in  April  2017  (for  reasons  not
explained in the record). While she was not in possession of an active security clearance
on either occasion, she was employed by a defense contractor. The record did not specify
whether she was subjected to any type of drug-use policy by her employer. She has not
used marijuana or other illegal drugs since April 2017. (FORM response; GE 2; GE 3 at
33-34)
Applicant first applied for a DOD security clearance in 2005. During that process,
she self-reported the history of her marijuana and other illegal drug use on her 2005 SCA
and  during  her  2007  security  clearance  interview.  She  was  granted  a  clearance  which
she maintained until she was laid off in 2010. That clearance did not transfer to her current
employer because she did not have a need for a security clearance. She now has a need
for a security clearance so her current employer is sponsoring the pending application,
which was initiated in October 2017. She self-reported the history of her marijuana use
within the last seven years on her 2017 SCA and candidly discussed it in her SOR answer
and FORM response. Her 2014 and 2017 marijuana use occurred prior to her submission
of the 2017 SCA. (FORM response; GE 2, 3, 5, 6)
In her subscribed and sworn SOR answer, Applicant reiterated her commitment to
remain abstinent from marijuana and other illegal drugs. She provided a signed statement
of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that
any  future  involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  her  security  clearance
eligibility. She understands the seriousness of illegal drug use and that it is incompatible
with the maintenance of a security clearance. She has never used illegal drugs while in
possession of an active security clearance, and would never do so. She considers herself
a steward of the U.S. government and would never do anything to jeopardize proprietary,
sensitive, or classified information. (GE 2; FORM response)

"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in her response to the SOR (Answer). She
is 28 years old, single, and does not have any children. (Answer; GE 1; AE B)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2010. She obtained a bachelor’s and a
master’s degree in chemical engineering in 2015 and 2019, respectively. She worked as
a college intern for a DOD contractor during the summers of 2013 and 2014. She obtained
full-time  employment  as  an  engineer for  the  same  DOD  contractor  in  June  2015.  She
initially worked in one division until January 2017, then transferred to the division in which
she worked as of the date of the hearing. She was granted a DOD security clearance in
2013. (Tr. at 6, 15-16, 19-20, 24, 27, 29-30, 32-33, 54-55; GE 1, 4; AE C, D)
Applicant used marijuana from approximately January 2008 to June 2015 (SOR ¶
1.a).  She  first  used  marijuana,  on  one  occasion,  in  high  school.  The  majority  of  her
marijuana  use  occurred  in  college,  with  her  then  long-term  college  boyfriend.  She
acknowledged there were a few occasions when she used marijuana on her own, to relax
while studying or going to sleep. She estimated that she used marijuana “once or twice a
month with long periods where I actually just didn’t do it.” The individuals with whom she
used  marijuana  provided  it,  but  there  were  occasions  in  which  she  contributed  money
towards its purchase. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-39, 46-47, 50-52; GE 1-4; AE C, D)
Applicant stopped using marijuana by the time she completed her June 2013 SCA,
which  was  during  “finals week” of  her third  year in  college.  She did  not  use marijuana
during  the  duration  of  her  summer  internships  in  2013  and  2014.  She  resumed  using
marijuana when she returned to college after completing both internships, and she also
used  marijuana  once  or  twice  after  her  March  2015  graduation.  She  held  a  clearance
during this period, having been granted one in 2013 (SOR ¶1.d). She testified that she
regretted doing so, but she was not thinking long-term. She has not used marijuana since
she began working full time in June 2015. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 46-47, 50-56; GE
1- 4; AE C, D)
Applicant used ecstasy and cocaine from approximately April 2011 to  July 2016
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c). She first used ecstasy during her first year in college, while at a concert
with her college roommate. All of her ecstasy use occurred while attending concerts. She
also first used cocaine during her first year in college, while at a fraternity party with her
college  roommate.  She  used  cocaine  occasionally  throughout  college,  while  attending
concerts with friends. The individuals with whom she used ecstasy and cocaine provided
them, and there were occasions in which she contributed money towards their purchase.
She  used  both  ecstasy  and  cocaine  twice  after  graduation;  she  last  used  ecstasy  in
January 2016; and she last used cocaine in July 2016. She held a clearance during this
period (SOR ¶1.d). She decided in 2016 that she never wanted to use ecstasy or cocaine
again. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 46-47, 50-56; GE 1-4; AE C, D)
Applicant reiterated that she regretted using marijuana, ecstasy, and cocaine after
her college graduation. She testified that though she was working full time,  she did not
contemplate the long-term implications of using drugs while working for her employer and
holding  a  security  clearance.  She  first  came  to  understand  such  implications  in  2017,
when she transferred to the division in which she worked as of the date of the hearing
and underwent the security clearance process again for continued access to classified
information, as further discussed below. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 46-47, 50-56; GE 1-

Applicant misused the prescription medication Adderall, not prescribed to her, after
she  purchased  it  from  friends  between  April  and  October  2011;  and  she  misused  her
prescribed  Adderall  when  she  gifted  or  sold  it  to friends  between December 2011 and
June 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f). She first used Adderall in April 2011, prior to receiving  a
prescription for it. She was struggling in school and a friend who was prescribed it offered
it to her as a study aid. She found that it helped her study so she used it several more
times. She also purchased it for her personal use two to three times between the spring
and fall of 2011. (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 57-58; GE 1-4; AE C)
In  the  fall  of  2011,  Applicant  sought  counseling  to  explore  the  possibility  of
receiving her own Adderall prescription; she received such a prescription when she was
diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. She used her prescribed Adderall
throughout college. She also gifted and sold some of her Adderall pills to several friends
during the week of college exams. She stated in her 2017 security clearance application
(SCA)  and  during  her  2018  background  interview  that  she  had  no  intent  to  sell  her
prescription  Adderall  again  in  the  future.  She  briefly  stopped  usage  of  her  prescribed
Adderall after graduation, and she resumed usage from 2016 to June 2019 while pursuing
her master’s degree. Though it helped with her learning disability, she testified that she
had no intention of taking it again because she did not want to have to take a drug “for
the rest of my life.” (Tr. at 18-26, 28-31, 33-40, 57-58; GE 1-4; AE C, D)
Applicant  was  aware  of  her  employer’s  policy  against  illegal  drug  use.  She
successfully completed drug tests in conjunction with her internships in the summers of
2013 and 2014, her full-time employment in 2015, and her 2017 transfer to the division in
which she worked as of the date of the hearing. She was subject to random drug testing,
but she had not been drug tested since 2016. In June 2019, she signed a statement of
intent not to illegally use any drugs in the future and that any violation constituted grounds
for revocation of her clearance. In April 2019, she was assessed by a psychiatrist and
determined to not be drug dependent. (Tr. at 18-33, 38-46, 50-55, 57, 59; AE C, D, E)
Applicant  testified  that  she  has  matured  and  her  priorities  have  changed.  She
testified that she socializes primarily with her coworkers “because of our similar values.”
She no longer associated with the individuals with whom she had previously used drugs,
to include her college roommate as well as  her then long-term boyfriend. She testified
that she terminated her relationship with her boyfriend in April 2019 because he continued
to behave like an “adolescent teenager and I wanted to be an adult, and he wasn’t getting
there with me.” Since 2016, she has been in several situations where drugs were being
used, and she chose to leave and go home. She was remorseful about her past drug use.
She  testified  that  she  understood  the  severity  of  her  actions,  she  had  no  intention  of
repeating the mistakes of her adolescence, and she did not intend to jeopardize her job
by using illegal drugs or misusing legal drugs. (Tr. at 18-33, 38-46, 50-57, 59-60; AE C,

Applicant  first  completed  an  SCA  in  June  2013.  She  marked  “No”  and  failed  to
disclose information regarding her drug use, as discussed above in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.f, in
response to section 23. Section 23 inquired whether she had, in the past seven years: (1)
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances,  or  (2)  intentionally  engaged  in  the
misuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not the drugs were prescribed to
her or someone else (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b). Applicant testified that when she completed her
2013 SCA during “finals week” of her third year in college, she was “really stressed out.”
She had not yet begun her summer internship. She testified that the SCA was included
with her onboarding paperwork, and she did not truly understand the nature of the SCA
or  the  security  clearance  process.  She  testified  that  she  confused  the  SCA  with  her
onboarding paperwork, stating:
I  didn’t  really  honestly  know  the  difference  between  my  onboarding
paperwork and the [SCA]. It kind of seemed like all one bundle of things that
I had to do just to get an internship. So, I did receive [the SCA] at that time
back in June or late May of 2013. But I can’t really say that I recognized [the
onboarding paperwork and the SCA] were two separate entities.
(Tr. at 26-28, 31-33, 35, 37, 47-50, 55-56, 61; GE 2; AE C).
Applicant could not recall meeting with a facility security officer (FSO), but rather
worked  on  the  SCA  through  an  individual  from  human  resources  (HR)  “who,  frankly,
rushed  me  through  the  process.”  She  recalled  this  individual  warning  her  that  her
internship would be jeopardized if she did not promptly complete the SCA. She testified
that she thought that she would not get the internship if she answered “Yes” to the relevant
drug questions, and she did not understand that her ability to obtain a security clearance
would be impacted. She testified that she lacked the resources to better understand that
she  would  not  be  punished  if  she  told  the  truth.  She  also  sought  the  guidance  of  her
father, an attorney, and followed his advice to mark “No” in response to section 23. She
ultimately chose to not jeopardize her internship. (Tr. at 26-28, 31-33, 35, 37, 47-50, 55-
56, 61; GE 2; AE C, D)
Applicant self-reported information about her past drug use to her FSO in January
2017,  when  she  transferred  to  the  division  in  which  she  worked  as  of  the  date  of  the
hearing. In turn, her FSO completed an incident history report, as required, on the Joint
Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) database. Applicant also disclosed her past drug
use information on her March 2017 SCA. She also disclosed her past drug use to her
managers and coworkers. She testified that she made a mistake in not disclosing such
information on her 2013 SCA, and she was “trying to own up to it and trying to correct it.”
She acknowledged that fear kept her from disclosing her drug use sooner. As previously
discussed, she reiterated that when she underwent the security clearance process again
in  2017  for  continued  access  to  classified  information,  she  truly  understood  the
implications of her past drug use and her failure to disclose such drug use on her 2013
SCA. It was then, that she “knew exactly what it was that . . . was a potential for somebody
to blackmail me . . . .” She was remorseful about her failure to disclose her drug use on
her 2013 SCA. (Tr. at 16-18, 21, 55-56, 59; GE 1, 4; AE C).
Applicant  testified  that  she  loves  her  job  and  “really  just  dove  in  into  my  career
since college.” Her employer rated her performance as “exceeded” expectations in 2015
and “significantly exceeded” expectations from 2016 to 2018. She is involved with various
professional societies devoted to promoting careers in science, technology, engineering,
and math among young adults. She also enjoys spending time outdoors, exercising, and
cooking.  Numerous  character  references,  to  include  her  manager  from  2018  to  2019,
coworkers, and friends, describe her as a responsible, honest, and trustworthy individual.

There is no evidence that Applicant used illegal drugs before or after June 2017.
In  June 2017,  he  accepted  an offer from  a friend  to  smoke marijuana and  use  MDMA
(3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine),  a  controlled  substance  commonly  known  as
ecstasy.1  Applicant  decided  that  he  liked  marijuana,  and  he  purchased  about  three
ounces  of  marijuana  from  his  friend.  His  friend  also  gave  him  another  MDMA  pill.
Applicant stated in his October 2018 affidavit that he paid “approximately $300” for the
marijuana.  He  testified  he  paid  “about  $500.”  He  stated  that  the  marijuana  was  for his
personal use.  He  used  marijuana on a few  more occasions  in  June  2017.  Because of
police  intervention,  Applicant  never  had  the  opportunity  to  take  the  MDMA  pill  or  the
remainder of his marijuana. (Tr. at 52-55, 64, 82-84; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE

In  June  2017,  Applicant  and  his  friends  were  driving  to  a  music  festival.  They
were  stopped  by  the  police  a  few  blocks  from  his  apartment.  Applicant  believes  a
confidential  informant  provided  the  information  to  the  police,  because  the  police  knew
who they were, where they were going, and that they had drugs in their possession that
they intended to use at the festival. The police searched the car and seized about five
grams  of marijuana  that  belonged  to  Applicant  and additional  marijuana  that belonged
to  the  other  passengers.  The  police  searched  Applicant’s  apartment  and  seized  the
MDMA pill that Applicant received from his friend and about three ounces of marijuana,
half of which belonged to Applicant’s roommate. (Tr. at 55-60, 84-84; GE 1, 4; AE 1, 4)
Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana with intent to
distribute and possession of a controlled substance. In June 2018, he pleaded guilty to
possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  and  the  other  charge  was  nolle  prosequi
(dismissed).  Imposition  of  sentence  was  suspended  for  one  year  conditioned  upon
Applicant’s good behavior through 12 months of probation. His probation included drug
testing and 100 hours of community service. (Tr. at 59-67, 87; Applicant’s response to

Applicant’s  employer  had  an  anti-drug  policy  that  prohibited  illegal  drug
possession  and  use.  His  supervisor  testified  that  Applicant  had  access  to  sensitive

he  applied  for a  security  clearance,  but  he  was  never  informed  that  he  had  a  security
clearance, and he never knew that he had a security clearance. (Tr. at 24-28, 49-52, 78,

Applicant wrote that he was investigated for a secret clearance with the date of action of
“04/2014.” He added: “Date of Action is when the investigation was initiated, not when
the  clearance  was  granted.  But  I  do  have  an  active  secret  clearance.”  Additionally,  in

Clearance with DOD Suitability.”2 (GE 2, 6)
Applicant  completed  all  the  terms  of  his  probation,  including  counseling.  His
therapist  did  “not  see  him  as  a  risk  for  future  court  involvement.”  The  charge  was
dismissed,  and  he  was  released  from  probation  in  June  2019.  He  stated  that  he  is

Guideline G – Alcohol Consumption
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has  engaged  in  excessive  alcohol
consumption that often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to
control  impulses,  and  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.

arrest for DUI occurred in January 2008.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  Two years later, he
was arrested a fourth time for DUI.  This occurred on November 2010.   (Government
Exhibits 1 and 2.)    Applicant pled guilty to the lesser offense of Reckless Driving.
recent  arrest
Applicant’s  most
for  DUI  occurred
in  September  2017.
(Government Exhibit 4.)  He pled guilty to this offense.  Applicant explained that on this
occasion he went out with a friend to a bar and had some beers.  When he left, it was
raining and traffic was heavy; and as he was driving onto the freeway on ramp, the cars
in front of him stopped and he tried to stop, but was unable to before hitting the car in
front of him.  Applicant’s license was suspended, he was fined $2,500 and was required
to have a two-year ignition-interlock system installed.  He was confined for 120 hours,
received  60  days  house  arrest  requiring  him  to  wear  an  ankle  bracelet,  and  then
community  service.    He  was  also  required  to  complete  an  18  DUI  program.    He  was
sentenced  to  five  years  of  informal  probation,  which  will  end  in  December  2022.    His
driver’s license remains restricted as he is only allowed to drive as long as the interlock
is on.  (Applicant’s Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 7, and Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)
Applicant  has  never  formally  been  diagnosed  as  an  alcoholic.    He  has  never
attended  an  inpatient  alcohol treatment  program.    Following  his  most  recent  arrest  for
DUI,  Applicant  has  been  sober for  the  longest  period  that  he  can  remember,  which  is
about  30  months.    He  then  returned  to  consuming  alcohol  on  April  2018.    Applicant
states that he last consumed alcohol on Thanksgiving when he had a couple of beers.
(Tr.  p.  50.)    He  states  that  he  continues  to  drink,  but  has  reduced  his  alcohol
consumption.    He  further  states  that  he  has  also  found  Alcoholic  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings  to  be  helpful.    He  has  never  worked  the  steps  of  AA,  nor  does  he  have  a
sponsor, but realizes that it could be helpful to him in the future.   At this time, he does
not feel that he is ready to start “sharing” at this point.  (Tr. p. 50.)
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations  under  this  guideline.    He  has  used
marijuana  from  2008  to  at  least  2017.    In  August  2005,  Applicant  was  charged  with
possession of methamphetamine, a controlled substance.  Applicant explained that he
was in his car with his friend when he was pulled over by the police for no reason.  They
searched Applicant’s car and found methamphetamine underneath the passenger’s side
seat.    Applicant  states  that  the  methamphetamine  was  not  his,  but  his  friend’s.
Applicant was arrested and spent the night in jail.  The next day, he was administered a
drug test and it came back clean.  Applicant then went to court and believes the matter
was dropped.  (Government Exhibits 1, 2, and 3.)
Guideline J – Criminal Conduct
The  Government alleges  that Applicant has engaged  in  criminal  conduct,  which
raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive information.
Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.   In 2011,
Applicant was arrested for driving an unregistered vehicle and on a suspended driver’s
license  as  a  result  of  a  prior  DUI  conviction.    (Government  Exhibit  8.)    He  was  found
guilty of driving without a valid driver’s license.  He is currently on probation until 2022.
Applicant states that since he has been working for his current employer, he has
worked his way up the ladder at the company.  His performance reviews started at “high
meets”  and  as  time  passed,  he  was  promoted  and  they  now  reflect  that  he  “exceeds”
his job requirements in every aspect.  (Tr. p. 63.)
Applicant believes that his current wife has  been a contributing factor in  helping
him become more mature and responsible.  He is now trying to buy a house.
",False
"Applicant  is  42,  married,  and  has  two  young  children.  In  2001,  he  received  a
bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and in 2008, he received a master’s degree
in business administration. He previously held a security clearance from approximately
2003 until 2011. He has worked for a defense contractor (DC 1) as a program manager
since February 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 9-12)
Applicant started experimenting with drugs while he was in college. He continued
to use drugs after he graduated in 2001. The majority of his drug use occurred  before
2001, but he continued to use drugs occasionally until 2006. (GE 1 at 52-53; GE 2 at 7;
GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 54-55)
Applicant used Ketamine two to three times between 1997 and 1998. He used and
purchased  LSD  approximately  five  times  in  1997  and  1998.  He  used  psychedelic
mushrooms once in 1998, and once in 2010 at his bachelor party. Applicant used Ecstasy
10 to 15 times between 2001 and 2003, prior to obtaining a security clearance. He used
and purchased cocaine 10 to 20 times between 2004 and 2006, while holding a security
clearance.  Applicant’s drug  use  primarily  took  place  on the  weekends  while  he  was  at
parties with his friends. (GE 1 at 52-53; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 30-31, 41-44)
Applicant purchased marijuana and used it approximately 15 to 25 times between
1999 and 2006.  He used marijuana again approximately three to five times between July
and November 2016. At that time, he lived in a state in which recreational marijuana use
is legal, and he was employed as the vice president of product development for a small
start-up company. He was not considering seeking further government employment. (GE
1 at 50-51; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 29-30, 34, 40, 47-51, 53-54)
Applicant  stopped using  marijuana  in  late  2016,  because  he  decided  it  was  not
conducive to his family life. He has not used any  illegal drugs since late 2016, and he
stopped using them prior to applying for and accepting a position with DC 1 in early 2017.
(GE 1 at 50-51; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 29-30, 34, 40, 49-51)
Applicant worked for DC 1 from March 2001 until October 2002, when his position
was downsized. He applied for a security clearance during this employment, but was laid
off before the clearance investigation was completed. At the hearing, Applicant admitted
that he probably did not disclose his drug use between 1999 and 2001 when he completed
this SCA. (GE 1; Tr. 31-33, 37-39)
Applicant was rehired by DC 1 in March 2003, and he almost immediately received
a security clearance based upon his initial application. According to Applicant, the security
clearance process “didn’t really sink in,” and he “continued a pattern of behavior that [he
now realizes] is not becoming of individuals” who hold a security clearance. He was aware
that drug use was inconsistent with his employment at DC 1 and inconsistent with holding
a security clearance. (AE A; Tr. 31-32, 39-40, 47-48)
In late 2010, DC 1 sponsored Applicant for a top secret clearance with sensitive
compartmented information access (TS/SCI). In 2011, during an interview, he disclosed
all  of  his  drug  use,  including  his  drug  use  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  He  also
indicated that he intended to abstain from drug use in the future. Applicant left DC 1  in
late December 2011, prior to the adjudication of this upgrade. Applicant worked for non-
government-related companies from December 2011 until February 2017, when he was
rehired by DC 1. (GE 1 at 55; Tr. 40, 45-47)
Applicant was drug tested by DC 1 in 2001, 2003, 2007, and in 2017. He did not
test positive for any drugs on any of these tests. He was drug tested by a non-government
employer in 2011 or 2012. (Tr. 29, 45)
Applicant’s supervisor (Supervisor) from 2017 until early 2019 testified that he had
daily contact with Applicant. He reviewed Applicant’s SOR two weeks before the hearing.
Supervisor currently holds a TS/SCI security clearance. He has held a security clearance
since  2002  as  a  military  service  member,  government  service  employee,  and  defense
contractor. He has no concerns with Applicant’s behavior at work, and he has only seen
“nothing but reasonable, honorable behavior in the years” that he has known him. (Tr. 20-
28)
Applicant no longer associates with individuals who use drugs. (AE A; Tr. 31, 33,
52-53) He accepts full responsibility and the consequences for his prior actions, which
reflect “very poor judgment and a lack of understanding and respect [for] the severity of
holding a [security] clearance.” Applicant signed a statement acknowledging that future
drug use would subject his security clearance to revocation. He does not intend to use
drugs in the future. (GE 3 at 2; AE A; Tr. 29, 31, 33, 52-53)
Applicant currently volunteers at a bicycle co-op providing teaching and mentoring
for an under-privileged local community. He volunteered from 2006 to 2013 in another
state  with  the  Park  Rangers  at  a  National  Monument.  He  went  through  a  background
investigation  and  a  drug  test  for  this  work.  Since  August  2019,  Applicant  has  sought
weekly mental-health treatment to address stress, personal insight, and communication
skills. (AE A; AE B; Tr. 17-18, 35-36)

"Applicant, age 26, has never married nor had children. He earned his high school
diploma in 2011. He is one course shy of earning a degree from the university he attended
between August 2011 and May 2016. He has been employed as an engineer by a defense
contractor since May 2016. (Items 3, 4; Item 5 at 4)
The  SOR  alleged  Guideline  H  and  E  concerns  involving  Applicant’s  use  of
marijuana, including after having been granted access to classified information (SOR ¶¶
1.a, 1.b, and 2.a). It also alleged Guideline E concerns  involving Applicant’s deliberate
falsifications of SCA1 and SCA2 (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.c, 2.e), 2017 driving under the influence
(DUI) arrest (SOR ¶ 2.d), and 2012 open container citation (SOR ¶ 2.f). He admitted each
of the SOR allegations and proffered facts in support of mitigation. Although he answered
“I admit” to the allegations set forth in SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.c, and 2.e, given his accompanying
explanations, I conclude that he denied deliberately falsifying SCA1 and SCA2. (Item 2)
Applicant  underwent  his  first  background  investigation  for  a  DOD  clearance,
apparently in connection with an engineering internship he had with a department of the
U.S. Navy. The record did not explain the reason for the delay between his submission
of  SCA1  in  2012  and  the  internship  that  occurred  in  2015.  The  current  background
investigation was initiated by SCA2, which Applicant submitted in April 2018. The record
did  not  address  the  status  of  any  interim  or  final  clearances  that  he  may  have  been
granted in connection with the first investigation. There is also no information in the record
as  to  whether  Applicant  was  granted  an  interim  clearance  pending  adjudication  of  the
current  investigation.  The  Government  did  not  otherwise  establish  that  Applicant  was
granted access to classified information as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Item 2 at 35; Item 3 at
38-39; Item 4 at 34; Item 5 at 6-7; Items 6 and 7)
Applicant did not report any illegal drug use on either SCA1 or SCA2. In June 2018,
he was interviewed twice in connection with SCA2. During the first interview, he initially
reported  that  he  used  marijuana  only  about  three  times  during  his  sophomore  year  of
college between 2011 and 2012. He described his use as “experimental” and “isolated.”
(Item 3 at 23-24; Item 4 at 30-31; Item 5 at 5-6, 10)
Throughout  the  course  of  the  second  interview,  he  reported  three  additional
instances of marijuana use, about which he claimed his memory had been refreshed after
the first interview. As to each instance, he denied “knowingly” using marijuana. The first
instance occurred in about December 2017, when Applicant asserted that he “may have”
consumed a food product infused with marijuana while at a party. He did not know the
food product “possibly” contained marijuana until three days after the party when a friend
told him that he heard that there were marijuana-infused food products at the party. (Item
5 at 7)
The second instance occurred during a camping trip in April 2018. He was offered
a cigar by individuals previously unknown to him  whom he had befriended. It was only
after he took one puff of the cigar that he realized it contained marijuana, whereupon he
immediately stopped smoking it because he knew that the federal government does not
allow marijuana use. He described that use as “accidental.” The third instance occurred
a few days after the first interview, when he tested positive for marijuana on a drug test
he was administered in connection with his DUI treatment program. However, he denied
that he smoked any marijuana after April 2018. At the conclusion of the second interview,
he stated that there were “no further issues” with marijuana that “he could recall.” (Item 5
at 6-7)
Applicant reported two alcohol-related offenses on his SCAs, although he reported
his DUI as nolle prosequi. He was fined for an open container violation in March 2012.
He was arrested and charged with DUI of alcohol in October 2017. In January 2018, he
pled  guilty  and  received  probation  before  judgment,  the  terms  of  which  included
unsupervised probation (of an unspecified duration) and installation of an interlock device
on  his  vehicle  for  six  months.  Upon  the  advice  of  counsel,  he  voluntarily  underwent
alcohol treatment to assist with his court case. He asserted that the DUI was an “isolated
incident.”  He  abstained  from  alcohol  for  an  unspecified  period  following  his  arrest.
Thereafter, he maintained  that  he  no  longer  intended  to  drive  after consuming  alcohol
and planned to consume alcohol “more responsibly.” As of June 2018, his consumption
usually consisted of approximately two beers, but he admitted to having consumed beer
to intoxication (approximately six beers) on two occasions in the prior six months. (Item 3
at 22; Item 4 at 28-29; Item 5 at 4-5, 8; Item 6 at 3-4, 14)
After being diagnosed with “alcohol abuse, uncomplicated” during his initial intake
in December 2017, Applicant was admitted to a 12-week outpatient DUI program to begin
in January 2018. His discharge date was projected to be in April 2018. His treatment plan
included weekly group sessions, monthly individual sessions, and weekly urinalyses and
breathalyzer testing. His discharge was delayed due, in part, to his work schedule, and,
in part, because of testing positive for marijuana on his urinalyses. He tested positive on
each  of  the  11  urinalyses  administered  from  December  2017  through  July  2018.  His
counselor noted that the final three urinalysis results indicated that Applicant was recently
abstinent  from  marijuana,  which  was  a  requirement  for  his  discharge.  Applicant  was
discharged in July 2018, at which time it was noted that his “condition” had improved and
that his prognosis was “fair.” (Item 5 at 6, 7; Item 6 at 11, 12, 13, 14, 16)
In his August 2019 SOR answer, Applicant denied any “conscious” marijuana use
after college. He stated that “all conscious use of marijuana was strictly in the years and
environment of college attendance,” and that “the two instances of post-college marijuana
consumption was unknowing.” He  declared his intent not to use any illegal substances
for  the  “duration  of  [his]  clearance,”  knowing  that  it  would  “jeopardize”  his  ability  to
maintain a security clearance. He also stated that he “would be willing to provide annual,
semi-annual, or monthly drug screenings to prove . . . [his] determination and willingness
to abide by the regulations of [his] clearance.” (Item 2)
As  of  June  2018,  Applicant  asserted  that  he  no  longer associated with  persons
who  use  illegal  substances  or  frequented  places  where  illegal  substances  were  being
used.  As  of  May  2019,  he  averred  that  he  was  focusing  more  on  work  and  his  health
rather  than  social  events,  and  avoiding  situations  where  he  was  not  in  control  of  his
environment.  He  had  recently  completed  a  half  marathon  and  was  coaching  a  youth
soccer team. (Item 2, Item 5 at 7, 10, 11)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the two SOR allegations. (HE 3) He also
provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings
of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  software  engineer,  and  a  defense  contractor  has
employed him since 2017. (Tr. 22-23; AE C) In 2008, he graduated from high school, and
in 2011, he received a bachelor’s degree in applied mathematics and statistics. (Tr. 24-
25, 29; AE E) He has never married, and he does not have children. (Tr. 22; GE 1)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
In 2008, Applicant began using marijuana when he was a freshman in college and
living in the college dormitories. (Tr. 25, 45) In college, he used marijuana with varying
degrees of frequency about every three months. (Tr. 27, 48) He received marijuana from
friends, and he did not purchase the marijuana that he used. (Tr. 27-28) He knew it was
against the college’s rules to use marijuana. (Tr. 28-29)
From 2012 to 2017, Applicant used marijuana two or three times a year. (Tr. 29)
He  used  marijuana  in  his  residence  with  his  girlfriend  in  2017,  and  his  marijuana  use
occurred in a state where marijuana possession is illegal. (Tr. 43-44, 47) She procured
the marijuana and brought it into his residence. (Tr. 43) Their live-in relationship ended in
November  2018.  (Tr.  43)  He  probably  had  marijuana  in  his  residence  as  recently  as
November 2018. (Tr. 57) Applicant’s most recent use of marijuana was in July 2018. (Tr.
29)  Applicant  used  marijuana  once  in  2018.  (Tr.  31)  In  July  2018,  Applicant’s  sister
provided  edible  marijuana  to  him  in  a  state  where  possession  of  small  amounts  of
marijuana  does  not  violate  state  law.  (Tr.  30,  48-49;  AE  G)  Applicant  did  not  consider
whether he was in violation of any laws or whether marijuana possession and use would
have an adverse effect on his employment when he used marijuana. (Tr. 31-33) He knew
it violated federal law for him to use marijuana. (Tr. 32, 51) He did not think he would be
caught and punished if he used marijuana. (Tr. 32)
When  he  completed  his  SF  86,  Applicant  admitted  marijuana  use,  and  he  was
aware that using marijuana was significant to the process of approval for a public trust
position. (Tr. 33, 50; GE 1) He indicated on his SF 86 that he intended to continue to use
marijuana. (Tr. 35; GE 1) He used marijuana after completing his SF 86 because he was
in a state where possession of small amounts of marijuana is legal, and he was in the
presence of his siblings, “and they were all using.” (Tr. 33)
Recently,  Applicant  informed  his  siblings  that  they  were  not  supposed  to  use
marijuana in his presence in the future, and if they chose to do so, he would leave and it
would adversely affect his relationship with them. (Tr. 38-39; AE D) Some of his friends
used marijuana in his presence in 2017 and 2018, and Applicant did not want to sever his
relationships with them. (Tr. 40, 52) Less than two months before his hearing, Applicant
was at a party where marijuana was being used, and he did not leave the party. (Tr. 53)
He subsequently asked some of his friends not to use marijuana in his presence, and he
promised to leave their presence if they started using marijuana. (Tr. 24, 40-41, 54, 58) If
someone  started  to  use  marijuana  in  his  presence,  Applicant  would  leave.  (Tr.  25)
Applicant said his employer’s policy was to preclude use of marijuana at work, but he was
unaware  of  any  policy  precluding  marijuana  use  during  off-duty  time.  (Tr.  54-55)  His
employer conducts drug testing. (Tr. 55-56) Applicant has never tested positive for the
presence of an illegal drug in his body. (Tr. 56)
After his April 20, 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject
interview (PSI) Applicant decided that he would not use marijuana in the future because
he  realized  it  would  have  a  serious  negative  effect  on  his  employment  and  access  to
sensitive  or  classified  information.  (Tr.  36-37,  41,  63)  On  October  31,  2019,  Applicant
received  a  substance abuse  evaluation from  a person  who  is  a  licensed  clinical  social
worker (LCSW), certified substance abuse counselor (CSAC), master addiction counselor
(MAC), and substance abuse professional (SAP). (AE B) Appellant advised the evaluator
that  he  “sometimes”  used  marijuana  with  his  girlfriend,  and  his  use  was  limited  to  “‘a
couple  of  hits’  every  six  to  nine  months.”  (AE  B1  at  2)  He  indicated  his  most  recent
marijuana use was in July 2018. (AE B1 at 2) The evaluator concluded Applicant has “a
low probability of an alcohol/substance use disorder” and he “is not at risk of relapse or
return  to  his  previous  behavior.”  (AE  B1  at  4)  She  did  not  diagnose  Applicant  with  a
substance use disorder, and she concluded no treatment was warranted. (AE B1 at 4)
She believes Applicant “is fully capable of safeguarding classified information,” and she
said he is “fit for duty in a position affecting national security.” (AE B1 at 4)
Applicant has increased his physical exercises for better health and wellbeing. (AE
F) Applicant does not believe that marijuana use is important to him, and he does not
intend to use it in the future. (Tr. 37; AE A) Applicant agreed “to random drug testing and
to  immediate  and  unqualified  revocation  of  [his]  security  clearance  in  the  event  of  any
future positive drug test.” (AE A)
Character Evidence
Applicant received excellent performance reviews. (AE C)  The general sense of
Applicant’s eight written character statements is that Applicant is honest, loyal, reliable,
trustworthy, and sober. (AE D) He has ended his marijuana use and has made it clear
that he will not remain in the vicinity when marijuana is being used by others. (AE D)

"In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.a and
denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  2.b.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  66-year-old  software  developer  employed  by  a  federal  contractor
since August 2011. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1975. He worked for other federal
contractors from February to October 2001, July 2006 to February 2008, and from March
2011  until  he  began  his  current  job.  According  to  his  SCA,  he  has  held  a  security
clearance since about 2004. (FORM Item 4 at 48.)
Applicant  married  in  January  1981,  divorced  in  February  2012,  and  married  in
December 2017. He has two sons from his first marriage, ages 32 and 29.
When Applicant submitted his SCA in January 2018, he did not disclose any use
of illegal substances. In an affidavit provided to a security investigator in May 2018, he
disclosed that he used a substance he believed was marijuana as well as liquid forms of
tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC)  and  cannabidiol  (CBD)  from  February  2015  to  November
2017. At the time, he lived in a state where the substances were legal. He stopped using
them when he moved to another state were the substances were illegal. Both THC and
CBD  are  extracts  of  marijuana  and  are  prohibited  substances  under  the  Controlled
Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.
Applicant  used  the  illegal  substances  every  one  or  two  weeks.  He  used  the
substances for pain relief, because he was grossly overweight but was unable to exercise
due  to  severe  knee  pain.  He  told  the  security  investigator  that  he  used  the  illegal
substances because he felt that his health was more important than the rules for holding
a security clearance. He also told the investigator that he did not intend to continue to use
the illegal substances because they were illegal in his state of residence and he no longer
suffered from knee pain.
Applicant told the security investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use
in  his  SCA,  because  he  was  worried  that  it  might  jeopardize  his  security  clearance.
(FORM Item 5 at 2.) His failure to disclose his drug involvement in his SCA is not alleged
in the SOR.

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e,  2.a,  3.a,  3.b,  and  3.d-3.g,  although  he  said
that SOR ¶¶ 3.e and 3.f were the same offense. He denied SOR ¶ 3.c. His admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  never
married. He has an adult son who lives in another state, an 18-year-old daughter, a 15-
year-old  daughter,  and  a  14-year-old  daughter.  His  three  daughters  live  with  their
mothers. Two of them live in other states. Applicant lives with his girlfriend and her 10-
year-old  son.  (GE  1;  Tr.  25)  Applicant  earned  a  certification  in  1997,  an  associate’s
degree in 2012, and a bachelor’s degree in 2015. (GE 1) He testified that he also has a
master’s degree. (Tr. 25, 58)
Applicant  was  employed  by  an  electronics  company  from  December  2005  to
January  2008.  He  left  the  job  to  take  a  position  in  another  state,  but  the  job  did  not
materialize.  He  was  then  unemployed  for  most  of  the  next  four  and  a  half  years.  He
spent much of this time improving his education. (GE 1; Tr. 67-69) He was employed at
a  computer  company  from  May  to  September  2013,  but  was  terminated  after  a
confrontation  with  a  coworker.  (GE  1;  Tr.  68-70  He  was  then  unemployed  again  until
May 2014, when he briefly took a job caring for seniors. He left the position because he
did not believe the employer was following regulations appropriately. (GE 1; Tr. 71-72)
Since  2017,  Applicant  has  worked  in  information  technology  for  his  current
employer and clearance sponsor. (GE 1, Tr. 72-76) On occasion, he was unemployed
between contracts. (GE 1; Tr. 61-65) He has never held a clearance. (Tr. 13) Applicant
testified that in 2019, he earned between $35,000 and $40,000. He works full time. (Tr.
65-67, 90-93)
In April 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony injury to a child. He
was  convicted  and  served  five  years  in  jail.  (SOR  ¶  3.g)(GE  1  at  43-44)  Applicant
testified that the injuries to the child included bruises and a burn mark. (Tr. 34-35)
In  September  2001,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  third-degree
larceny. (SOR ¶ 3.f) He explained that he was arrested after he attempted to steal some
items of clothing from a department store. He received a period of probation, but failed
to pay the related fine. In March 2003, he was in an auto accident. In the aftermath, he
gave a false name to the police. He was arrested for making a false report and for the
larceny  charge,  due  to  the  unpaid  fine.  He  said  that  his  probation  was  extended  as  a
result. (GE 1 at 44-45; GE 5 at 11; Tr. 26-28, 35-37) (SOR ¶ 3.e)
In 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol (DUI) and driving with a suspended license. He was convicted and sentenced to
one  day  in  jail,  12  months  of  probation,  fined,  ordered  to  perform  community  service,
and attend DUI education. (SOR ¶ 3.d) (GE 1 at 45-46; GE 5 at 8-9)
In  January  2012,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  felony  child  abuse.
(SOR ¶ 3.c) (GE 5 at 12; GE 1 at 38) He denied SOR ¶ 3.c. Applicant testified that the
girlfriend  of  his  daughter’s  maternal  grandfather  filed  a  child-abuse  complaint  against
Applicant.  The  complainant,  he  asserted,  was  herself  wanted  for  murder  at  the  time.
Applicant  was  arrested,  as  was  his  daughter’s  mother.  Applicant  denied  that  he
committed the offense. (Tr. 28-31, 37) He participated in parenting classes. (Tr. 34, 81-
83)  He  reported  the  arrest  on  his  SCA  and  noted  that  the  charge  was  dismissed  in
September  2014.  (GE  1  at  38-39)  The  arrest  is  documented  in  Applicant’s  criminal
record, but disposition of the charge is not. (GE 5)
In about June 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication
and  resisting  arrest,  and  cited  for  speeding  and  improper  lane  usage.  (SOR  ¶  3.b)  In
October 2013, he pleaded guilty to speeding and public intoxication and was fined. The
resisting  arrest  charge  and  the  citation  for  improper  lane  usage  were  dismissed.
Applicant testified that he was on his way home and a police car going in the opposite
direction  turned  and  followed  him.  He  pulled  into  his  apartment  complex.  When  the
police asked him to exit the vehicle, he tripped over a curb and fell down because the
parking lot was not well lit. (Tr. 37-38) (Answer to SOR; GE 1 at 39-40; Tr. 31-32) The
charges are not detailed on the exhibit documenting Applicant’s criminal record. (GE 5)
In December 2014, Applicant was charged with DUI and also cited for speeding
and improper lane usage. (SOR ¶ 3.a) Applicant admitted the fact that he was charged
but denied the conduct. He testified that he was pulled over because the police officer
observed him swerving between the lanes and smelled liquor on him during the traffic
stop.  Applicant  denied  that  he  consumed  alcohol  that  night.  He  said  had  just  left  the
house,  and  was  “sleepy”  but  not  drunk.  (Tr.  83-85)  In  October  2016,  the  DUI  charge
was nolle prossed after Applicant attended a nine-month DUI class through a diversion
program. (GE 5 at 12; GE 1 at 41-42; Tr. 31-32, 39-40, 76-80, 94) He has not had any
subsequent arrests. (Tr. 40)
Applicant  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  weekly,  at  times  daily,
between  May  2003  and  July  2016.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  His  most  recent  use  was  after  the
sudden  death  of  a  close  friend.  He  said  this  was  shortly  before  he  participated  in  the
DUI  diversion  program.  The  timing  of  his  last  marijuana  use  is  unclear.  Applicant  said
he  had  not  used  marijuana  since  July  2016.  (Tr.  43,  44)  He  later  said  this  was  some
time in 2017. (Tr. 44, 46-47) He denied using marijuana after submitting his May 2017
SCA. (Tr. 46) He acknowledged knowing that marijuana use is against state and federal
law.  He  has  attended  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  a  few  times  in  the  last  three  years.
(Tr. 40-47, 94-98)
Applicant’s background investigation also included credit reports from July 2017,
May 2018, and March 2019. Applicant had five delinquent accounts, the largest by far
being  SOR  ¶  1.a,  concerning  a  $121,692  child  support  arrearage.  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a
charged-off student loan account for $8,293. SOR ¶ 1.c is another charged-off account
for  $1,755.  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  ($250)  and  1.e  ($76)  are  two  past-due  medical  accounts.
Applicant disclosed his debts on his SCA. (GE 1)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.a,  Applicant  testified  that  he  fell  behind  on  his  child-support
payments  during  his  periods  of  unemployment.  This  began  with  a  layoff  in  2009.  He
also acknowledged working odd jobs, but said that none of that income went to arrears
or child support. (Tr. 85-90) Applicant testified that his child support went into arrears in
about 2012. (Tr. 100)
Applicant testified that he is currently paying on his child support and has money
taken out of his paycheck regularly. He said the arrearage amount was incurred during
his  various  periods  of  unemployment.  The  child  support  concerns  his  two  younger
children,  one  of  whom  lives  in  his  home  state  and  one  of  whom  is  in  another  state.
Applicant  said  he  is  paying  between  $500  and  $600  in  child  support  monthly  for  one
child,  and  about  $425  for  another  child.  Applicant  does  not  believe  that  his  monthly
payments  address  the  amount  in  arrears.  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  of
the current status of his child-support payments. (Tr. 47-54, 99-104)
Applicant asserted that his student loan (SOR ¶ 1.b) is in deferment. He said he
has  other  student  loans,  which  are  also  deferred.  (Tr.  54-55,  58-61)  Applicant  did  not
provide documentation of the current status of his past-due student loan. The past-due
debt at SOR ¶ 1.c is also unresolved. (Tr. 105)
Applicant asserted that the two medical debts alleged (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e) are
co-payments from medical procedures. He believes they should have been covered by
insurance. (Tr. 55-56) They remain unresolved.
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  has  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard  indicates  that  security

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  admitted  the  factual  allegation  in
Subparagraph  1.a.  of  the  SOR,  with  explanations.  He  also  provided  additional
information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant is 37 years old, is married, and works for a defense contractor. (TR at
page 15 line 18 to page 20 line 13.) It is unclear when Applicant was granted a security
clearance,  as  he  appears  to  deny  ever  having  one  in  his  e-QIP  (GX  1  at  page  35).
However,  he  admits  the  allegation  that  he  used  marijuana  “while  granted  access  to
classified  information.”  Furthermore,  in  his  e-QIP  Applicant  avers  he  has  worked  for
“Federal Contractor(s)” since April of 2011. (GX 1 at pages 12~15.)
Guideline H – Drug Involvement
1.a.  Applicant  admits  he  used  marijuana  about  20~25  times  from  about  May
2012 to about November of 2017, while granted access to classified information. (TR at
page 16 lines 1~5, at page 20 line 14 to page 24 line 7, at page 29 line 3 to page 36 line
20, and at page 37 line 1 to page 38 line 9.) Applicant has provided a signed statement
of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse in the future. (AppX
E.) This allegation is found against Applicant.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a,  2.a,  2.b,  and  3.a,  with
explanations. He failed to respond to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e, which
will  be  considered  denials.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is 44 years  old.  He  was  born in Afghanistan.  He married in  2005  and
moved to the United States in 2007 on a spousal visa. His wife is a naturalized citizen of
the United States. He became a naturalized citizen in 2011. He has two children born in
the United States, ages nine and five years old. He resides in a home he owns. He has
worked for a federal contractor as a linguist assigned to Afghanistan from July 2018 to
at  least  the  date  of  his  answer  to  the  SOR.  He  also  previously  worked  for  a  federal
contractor  as  a  linguist  from  April  2010  to  February  2013,  assigned  to  Afghanistan.
Applicant was self-employed during other periods. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  brother,  sister,  half-brother,  and  two  half-sisters  are  citizens  and
residents of Afghanistan. His brother is 65 years old and retired from the Afghan Army
in 1988. Applicant stated in his SOR Answer that his brother quit the Army due to unfair
circumstances. He stated his brother receives a partial mental disability pension. He has
quarterly telephonic or electronic contact with him. Applicant did not disclose his sister’s
employment or means of support. He has monthly telephonic contact with her. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  half-brother  is  a  university  student  in  Afghanistan.  Applicant  has
monthly telephonic and electronic contact with him. Both of Applicant’s half-sisters are
teachers  employed  by  the  Ministry  of  Education.  Applicant  has  quarterly  telephonic  or
electronic contact with them. (Item 3)
During Applicant’s October 30, 2018 interview with a government investigator, he
disclosed  he  visited  his  family  in  Afghanistan  in  2013,  2014,  2015,  2016,  and  from
December  2017  to  January  2018.  This  information  was  not  included  in  his  October  5,
2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  He  also  disclosed  that  he  sends  money
quarterly  to  his  half-brother  in  Afghanistan.  In  the  past,  Applicant  provided  financial
support to his brother, sister, and half-brother in Afghanistan. (Items 4, 7)
In the past, Applicant provided about $15,000 in financial support to his nephew,
who  is  a  dual  citizenship  of  Afghanistan  and  the  United  Kingdom  (UK),  and  currently
lives in the UK. (Item 3)
During  Applicant’s  October  2018  Counterintelligence  Focused  Security
Screening  Questionnaire  (CIFSSQ),  he  was  asked  if  there  is  any  country  he  had
allegiance to over the United States. He responded that the United States is his country,
but  he  is  also  loyal  to  the  UK  because  he  has  family  there,  and  he  is  also  loyal  to
Afghanistan.  He  would  like  to  live  in  Europe  and  have  his  children  grow  up  with  his
family’s children, because they are lonely in the United  States, but believes that is not
possible. He confirmed that he is more loyal to the United States. (Item 4)
In April 2010, Applicant completed a CIFSSQ. In it he disclosed that in 2004 he
used marijuana two to three times while living in the UK, but had not used it since that
time. (Item 6)
In Applicant’s April 2012 CIFSSQ, he disclosed that he used marijuana once per
week when he lived in the UK and his last use was in 2005. (Item 5)
In Applicant’s August 2018 CIFSSQ, he disclosed he had used marijuana about
twice a week from 2016 to 2018 while living in the United States. He used it because it
was fun and stopped using it because he did not want his use to affect his employment
with U.S. Forces. He stated he never thought about the illegality of his use.
On  his  October  5,  2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  Applicant
answered  “no”  in  response  to  the  question  if  he  had  in  the  last  seven  years  illegally
used drugs. (Item 3)
In his October 2018 interview with a government investigator, Applicant said he
used marijuana a total of five to six times with his nephew in the U.S. from 2017 to the
present.  Whenever  his  nephew  obtained  marijuana,  they  smoked  it  to  relax.  Applicant
was attempting to quit smoking and used marijuana in its place. He told the investigator
that he did not disclose his drug use on his SCA because he believed his use was now
legal,  and  he  had  no  intention  to  use  it  in  the  future  due  to  its  potential  impact  on  his
eligibility  to  hold  a  job  with  U.S.  Forces.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  used
marijuana from 2004 to 2008 once or twice a month with a nephew while he was in the
UK. (Items 4, 7)
In Applicant’s SOR Answer he stated:
It was a big mistake made by me and that happened due to ignorance and
lack of knowledge about the drug classifications. Honestly speaking one of
my friends mentioned to me that marijuana is legally allowed in [State A],
so while living in [State A] it was revolving in my mind that once it is legally
allowed it might not be counted [as] illegal drugs, so due to the ignorance
the word “no” uttered from my mouth on (e-QIP). (Item 2)
",True
"Applicant admitted  the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. She denied the SOR
allegation  in  ¶  2.a.  Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old. She married in 1993. She has four children, ages 30,
27,  24,  and  20.  She  has  been  employed  since  March  2014.  Before  then  she  was
unemployed for three months. (Item 3)
Applicant  completed  a  questionnaire  for  national  security  positions  (SF  86)  in
December  2017.  Section  23  asked  whether  in  the  last  seven  years  Applicant  illegally
used any drugs or controlled substances. She responded, “No.” (Item 3)
In December 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. She
told  the  investigator  that  personal  recreational  use  of  marijuana  is  legal  where  she
resides,  and  she  did  not  feel  her  use  was  illegal.  She  has  not  used  any  other  illegal
drugs. (Item 4)
Applicant was interviewed a second time by a government investigator in March
2019.  During  this interview,  she  stated  that from  March 2005  to  September 2005,  she
smoked marijuana one to two times a month with a friend, who supplied the drug. She
has not had contact with this friend for many years. Applicant told the investigator that
she  had  not  used  marijuana  from  September  2005  to  January  2014.  She  did  not  use
drugs during this period because the job she held had random drug testing. When she
became  unemployed  in  January  2014,  she  used  marijuana  once  or  twice  with  her
hairdresser.  She  then  disclosed  she  used  marijuana  in  an  edible  form  in  August  2018
and again in December 2018. She purchased the edible marijuana in a location where it
is not illegal under the laws of that jurisdiction. (Item 4)
Applicant  was  asked during  her March 2019  interview  why  she  did  not  disclose
her past drug use on her SF 86. She told the investigator that she did not believe she
had to report her 2005 use. She also said she thought her  more recent marijuana use
was  legal,  and  she  did  not  believe  she  was  required  to  disclose  it.  She  was  then
informed  by  the  investigator  that  marijuana  use  is  illegal  under  Federal  law.  Applicant
indicated to the investigator that she did not know that when she completed her SF 86.
Her 2018 marijuana uses were after she completed the SF 86. (Item 4)
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  she  did  not  use  marijuana  while  employed
where drug testing was conducted because she did not want any problems or violations
associated  with  its  use.  She  used  it  to  relax  and  for  stress.  She  stated  she  no  longer
uses marijuana. She has found other outlets for stress relief. She does not intend to use
marijuana in the future. She no longer associates with those in her past  that she used
marijuana  with.  She  has  never  had  a  positive  drug  screening  from  her  past
employments. (Item 4)
",True
"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old, has never married, and has no children. He earned his
bachelor’s  degree  in  mathematics  in  September  2010,  and  his  master’s  degree  in
computational  science,  engineering,  and  mathematics  in  August  2012.  He  took  some
courses online from January 2014 to January 2017, and earned a graduate certificate. He
has worked for the same defense contractor since  August 2012, after interning for the
company in the summer of 2011, and he is currently a senior research associate. Applicant
indicated on a July 2014 security clearance application that he  was granted an interim
secret-level clearance in July 2014, although he has not worked on any classified projects.
(GEs 1-2, AE A; Tr. 24.)
Psychological Conditions
Applicant first sought mental health treatment in 2000, when he was 13 years old.
He was struggling with depression, had low self-esteem, and lacked motivation. He was
prescribed a mood-stabilizer medication at that time because of his family history of bipolar
disorder,  and  he  has  been  voluntarily  receiving  outpatient  psychiatric  treatment  and
counseling since then. (GEs 3-4.)
At age 17, in December 2003, Applicant had a manic episode after he ran out of his
Lamictal medication while on a family vacation. Over the course of two weeks, he became
extremely talkative with rapid speech, grandiose ideas, insomnia, and held a delusional
belief. His mother took him to an emergency room, and he was admitted to a hospital for
two weeks in January 2004 and treated for diagnosed depression. (GE 4; Tr. 25.) On his
discharge from the inpatient psychiatric treatment, Applicant was prescribed Lithium, and
he resumed his mental health treatment under the care of a psychiatrist and psychologist
for diagnosed bipolar I disorder. (GE 4; Tr. 26-27.)
Clinical  notes  from  his  then  treating  psychiatrist  in  August  2010  indicate  that
Applicant’s bipolar I symptoms were under good control on the antidepressants Zoloft and
Sertraline,  and  the  mood-stabilizers  Lamictal  and  Lamotrigine.  During  a  psychiatric
evaluation at the university health services for a transfer of providers when he moved for
graduate  school in  September 2010,  Applicant  related that he was consuming alcohol
three nights a week, three to four drinks per occasion, and six drinks on the weekend days.
He stated he was not using any illegal drugs. He reported feeling “definitely depressed,”
and worrying excessively. Applicant reported some improvement in functioning over the
previous  two  years.  He  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  I  disorder,  most  recent  episode
depressed, moderate. Applicant was started on Abilify medication, and he began weekly
therapy with a psychologist in the community while continuing to meet with a psychiatrist at
the  university’s  health  services  department.  Applicant  continued  to  struggle  with
depression, with some exacerbation of symptoms around academic examinations. (GE 4.)
During a session with his university health services’ psychiatrist on March 2, 2011,
Applicant  reported  a  significant  improvement  in  mood  since  his  previous  session  in
December  2010.  He  was  taking  Lamictal  and  Zoloft  medication  with  good  effect,
experiencing  no  mood  swings,  and  continuing  in  therapy  with  a  psychologist  in  the
community. During his next session, which occurred in May 2011, Applicant reported no
mania or severe depression, although he had downward turns of mood lasting several
hours or days and moderate generalized anxiety. He had a pattern of relying on alcohol to
medicate for his anxiety. He was advised to obtain care from a psychiatrist in the local
community. (GE 4.)
In September 2011, Applicant had a final session at university health services. He
advised that he had not found a new psychiatrist and was running low on his medications.
He  was  given  a  14-day  supply  of  Zoloft  and  contact  information  for  some  local
psychiatrists. His mental health was assessed as fairly stable. (GE 4.) The psychologist
who treated Applicant on a regular basis from September 2010 to December 2011 for
diagnosed bipolar disorder indicates that their sessions focused primarily on managing
Applicant’s depression and related issues. Applicant exhibited no serious problems with
judgment or impulse control, and no serious behavioral or psychiatric issues. (GE 5.)
After earning his master’s degree in August 2012, Applicant began working for his
current employer. (GE 1.) Life stress led Applicant to retreat into a very depressive episode
in late 2013. He missed approximately one month of work because of his depression and
checked himself into a three-week partial hospitalization program. The treatment consisted
primarily of talk therapy, medication adjustments as needed, and support to regain his
stability after the depressive episode. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 29-30.)
Over the years, Applicant’s medication dosages have been adjusted to address his
mental health issues. He continues to experience depression and intense anxiety, but he
has  not  had  any  symptoms  of  mania  since  2003.  (Tr.  25-26.)  He  currently  takes
Lamotrigine  (a  mood-stabilizer),  Lexapro,  Ativan,  and  Wellbutrin  for  his  mental  health
issues.  (Tr.  27-28.)  He  sees  his  psychiatrist  once  every  two  months  for  medication
management and his psychologist every two weeks for counseling. (GEs 6-7; Tr. 29.)
Applicant began a therapeutic relationship with his current psychiatrist in April 2013
(GE  6)  and  with  his  psychologist  in  March  2015.  (GEs  2,  7.)  Applicant’s  psychiatrist
diagnosed  him  with  bipolar  I  disorder  (single  manic  episode,  most  recent  episode
depressed); social anxiety disorder; and generalized anxiety disorder. Between April 2013
and March 2016, Applicant experienced four episodes of depression but no hypomania or
mania. Applicant took his medications as prescribed and had extended psychotherapy.
(GE 6.) During his intake with his current psychologist, Applicant presented with episodic
depression and problems with social anxiety. The psychologist diagnosed him with major
depressive disorder, moderate, recurrent, and with social anxiety disorder. As of March
2016, Applicant had attended 41 sessions with his psychologist. He was actively committed
to working on ways to manage his symptoms and keep them from interfering with his life.
His treating psychologist indicated that Applicant was particularly responsive to cognitive-
behavioral interventions  to  decrease  problematic  thoughts,  and  he made considerable
progress in the area of being more active in pursuing social interactions and confronting his
anxieties. His mood was stable and bright for several months as of March 2016. (GE 7.)
On October 6, 2018, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation by a clinical
psychologist  at  the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF.  Applicant  reported  that  he  continues  to
experience  approximately  four  depressive  episodes  of  varying  intensity  per  year.  He
reported  experiencing  symptoms  of  anxiety,  especially  in  social  settings,  although  he
exhibited  no  observable  signs  of  anxiety.  He  expressed  an  understanding  of  the
seriousness of his condition and of the importance of taking his psychiatric medications as
prescribed. The psychologist assessed Applicant’s judgment as good and his insight as
intact. Clinical testing revealed no marked elevations indicative of psychopathology, but
some potential problems with regard to his anxiety, albeit still within the normal range. The
psychologist  noted  that  Applicant’s  single  manic  episode  at  age  17  could  have  been
triggered by the anti-depressant medication he was taking at the time, and she gave him a
good prognosis as to the risk of another manic episode. Depression was more prominent,
but the psychologist noted that his depressive symptoms had not negatively interfered with
his work environment since 2014. Applicant showed that he is able to identify triggers for a
depressive  episode  (i.e.,  that  they  are  more  likely  to  occur  in  the  winter,  after  the
dissolution of a romantic relationship, or when he is overwhelmed at work), but this insight
was considered to be a strength in that it allows him to be proactive in utilizing his coping
skills,  and  taking  measures  to  minimize  the  impact  of  his  symptoms.  The  clinical
psychologist assessed his prognosis for future depressive episodes as poor in that they are
likely to occur throughout his life, but the chronicity of his depression has a fairly predicable
pattern  that  makes  his  condition  “quite  stable.”  Applicant’s  ongoing  anxiety  could
exacerbate or serve as a trigger for his depressive episodes, although it could serve as “a
protective  factor when  it  comes  to  judgment  and  impulsivity.” The  clinical  psychologist
concluded about his mental health conditions as follows:
[Applicant] does have chronic mental health conditions, including Bipolar I
Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder, that are being appropriately managed
and treated, and they are currently stable. Even when symptomatic, it is not
believed  that  these  conditions  pose  any  significant  risks  to his judgment,
reliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified information. Additionally,
the risk to judgment and reliability of any future mental health problems is
low.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant used marijuana regularly in high school, initially once or twice a month
starting at age 16 in approximately 2002. After his hospitalization for his manic episode in
2003,  Applicant  began  to  consider  ceasing  his marijuana  use.  He  understood  that  his
marijuana use contributed to his lack of motivation and caused him intense anxiety. Yet, by
age 18, he was using marijuana daily and sometimes multiple times per day. His marijuana
use was social with friends, and he used marijuana because his friends were using it. (GEs
2-3;  Tr.  30-31.)  Applicant  reported  to  a  psychiatrist  in  September  2010  that  he  was
“consistently high” from smoking marijuana between the ages of 18 and 20 (between 2004
and 2006). (GE 4.)
Initially, Applicant used marijuana shared by his friends, occasionally contributing
money  for marijuana  or splitting  the  cost  of  marijuana  with  others. By age 18, he was
purchasing marijuana once or twice a week at a cost of $40 each time. Approximately once
every couple of months, Applicant sold some of his marijuana to friends, but not for profit.
(GE 2.)
Applicant decided to reduce his marijuana use because it made him feel paranoid
and interfered with his productivity. He no longer purchased marijuana after 2005, but he
continued to use marijuana once a year to once every couple of years to at least 2016.
(GEs 2, 4; Tr. 31.) During a session with his then treating psychiatrist in late May 2011,
Applicant reported that he was using marijuana rarely, less than once a month. (GE 4.)
During  his personal subject  interview  with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
investigator on May 3, 2017, Applicant indicated that he used marijuana once every couple
of  years.  (GE  2.)  At  his  March  2020  hearing,  he  described  his  marijuana  use  since
approximately 2005 as “once a year tops.” (Tr. 32.)
On  July  24,  2014,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86.) In response to an inquiry concerning
any illegal drug use in the last seven years, Applicant responded that he used marijuana
between  September  2002  and  November  2011,  stating,  “In  high  school  I  smoked
marijuana recreationally with some periods of heavy use. In college, I used it on the rare
occasion.” Applicant responded “No” to whether he intended to use marijuana in the future
and explained that he used the drug as a teenager and was no longer interested in using it.
Applicant answered “No” to a question concerning any illegal drug purchase in the last
seven years. He responded “Yes” to an inquiry into whether he had intentionally misused a
prescription  drug  in  the  last  seven  years,  and  disclosed  that  he  had  used  “Concerta”
between January 2007 and January 2008 “as a stimulant for pulling all night study sessions
in college.” (GE 1.)
Applicant used marijuana after he completed his SF 86. He used marijuana while
vacationing with college friends in June 2015, and another time in 2016. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 31-
32.) About his use in June 2015, he told the OPM investigator in May 2017 that he wanted
to confirm that he no longer liked the drug, and that after taking two hits of marijuana from
a bowl, he felt uncomfortable and stoned. (GE 2.) Applicant held a “misguided notion” that
his  drug  involvement  would  not  be  disqualifying  because  he  was  truthful  about  his
marijuana use, did not have a serious addiction problem, and his use was restricted to
“lighter substances such as marijuana or Adderall.” (Tr. 35-36, 44.) Applicant states that he
would not have used marijuana if he understood it was a problem for his security clearance
eligibility. (Tr. 44.)
As  of  March  2016,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  by  his  treating  psychiatrist  with
cannabis  use  disorder, severe,  but  in  remission.  (GE  6.)  During  his May  2017  subject
interview, Applicant admitted that he has friends who currently use marijuana, and that his
roommates use marijuana in their home, but not in his presence. He indicated that he
made a personal choice to stop using marijuana, but when asked about his future intent,
he expressed “a reasonable expectation” that he may smoke marijuana in the future, once
every few years, depending on the situation. (GE 2.) During his psychological evaluation for
the DOD in October 2018, Applicant admitted to the evaluating psychologist that he used
marijuana as recently as 2016 and would be open to using marijuana again. He also stated
that, although his friends use marijuana, he has been able to refrain from using it. (GE 3.)
Applicant knew that marijuana use remains illegal under federal law, notwithstanding the
state’s decriminalization of recreational use of marijuana. (Tr. 46.)
At his hearing in March 2020, Applicant expressed a willingness to abstain from
marijuana  use  if  he  is  granted  a  clearance.  (Tr.  34,  44.)  He  testified  that  he  would
“potentially” use marijuana in the future if he does not have a clearance. (Tr. 34.) Applicant
lived with persons who used marijuana from September 2016 to September 2018. Within a
few  months  of  his  March  2020  security  clearance  hearing,  he  was  at  a  small  social
gathering  with  persons  who  smoked  marijuana  in  his  presence.  He  did  not  use  any
marijuana at that time because he had no desire to use it, as he “generally” does not enjoy
it at this point in his life. (Tr. 45-46.) As to why then he would then consider the possibility
of future marijuana use, especially given its illegality under federal law, Applicant testified:
That’s a legitimate question. Part of it is just out of curiosity, just to see if [it]
still affects me in the way that it does right now, in the way that provokes just
anxiety. (Tr. 46.)
Applicant used Adderall without a prescription about once every two to three months
from 2002 to 2005. He obtained the drug from friends. (GE 2.) While he was in college,
Applicant used Adderall or Concerta “a handful of times” from January 2007 to January
2008 as a study aid. The drugs were not prescribed for him. (GEs 1-2.) During his May
2017 subject interview with the OPM investigator, he denied any intention to misuse either
Adderall or Concerta in the future. (GE 2.) Yet, he used Adderall recreationally at a party in
July 2018 while socializing with some friends from college. The drug was given to him by a
friend who had a prescription. (GE 3; Tr. 35.) Applicant did not think his substance misuse
was a problem for his clearance eligibility because he did not have a serious drug problem
and his use was of a “lighter substance.” In hindsight, he would not have used it had he
realized it posed a problem for his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 35-36.) Applicant knew that
taking a drug not legally prescribed for him was against the law, but he did not think much
of it because “[it] was in a controlled environment, private environment. And there was no
potential of harm to [himself] or others at the time.” (Tr. 53.)
The licensed clinical psychologist, who evaluated Applicant for the DOD in October
2018, expressed her belief that his marijuana use poses no significant risk to his judgment,
reliability, or trustworthiness, given he had not used the drug with any regularity since 2005.
His use of Adderall in July 2018 was “a moment of poor judgment, especially considering
his mental health conditions and the fact that he is in the process of undergoing a security
clearance determination. The psychologist opined that Applicant’s drug use did not meet a
clinical level of pathology, and that more often than not, Applicant is able to make good
decisions. However, she deferred to the adjudicators as to whether his recent misuse of a
stimulant in July 2018 is relevant to his security worthiness. (GE 3.)
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant drank alcohol a few times in high school, but he did not enjoy it. After two
years at a community college, he transferred to a four-year university in January 2007. He
was pulled over in 2009 and failed a field sobriety test, but he was not charged with an
alcohol offense. (GE 3.) While at the university, Applicant began drinking six or more beers
on the weekends at bars to be social. In September 2010, he started graduate school. He
socialized  with  others  who  drank  alcohol,  and  over  the  next  two  years,  his  drinking
increased to five to seven days per week, three to four beers on weeknights and five to six
beers on the weekends. As of March 2011, Applicant reported drinking alcohol two days
during the work week, up to three drinks per day, and six drinks on both weekend nights.
(GE 4.) In February 2011, Applicant had been advised by his psychologist that his drinking
was likely exacerbating his depression. Applicant was reportedly mildly defensive with his
psychologist about his drinking, and expressed that it was the only really bright spot in his
week in that alcohol helped him feel less anxious. Despite being advised of the risk that
alcohol posed for his bipolar disorder, Applicant did not plan to quit drinking, although he
told his psychologist he would consider reducing his weekday consumption. (GE 5.)  In late
May  2011,  Applicant  admitted  to  his  then  treating  psychiatrist  that  he  was  consuming
seven to eight drinks on Friday and Saturday nights regularly to get drunk, and three to four
drinks two other nights of the week. (GE 4.)
In October 2011, Applicant acknowledged to his mental health providers that he was
drinking too much. He was drinking daily up to five beers at a sitting during the week and
more on the weekends. Applicant expressed no interest in ceasing his alcohol use. (GE 5.)
In March 2016, Applicant’s current psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use
disorder, moderate. Applicant regularly engaged in binge drinking (in excess of six drinks in
an evening) since he began treatment with the psychiatrist in 2013. (GE 6.) However, the
psychiatrist told the DOD-contracted clinical psychologist in October 2018 that Applicant
has shown an ability to control his alcohol use, as demonstrated by periods of voluntary
sobriety for a couple of months at a time, and that he had never recommended to Applicant
that he refrain from all alcohol use. Given Applicant uses alcohol to alleviate his anxiety in
social situations, his treatment with his psychiatrist has focused on strengthening other
coping skills. (GE 3.)
The clinical psychologist, who evaluated Applicant for the DOD in October 2018,
indicated that Applicant’s use of alcohol is of concern because it exceeds general medical
recommendations for the use of alcohol per the National Institute of Health’s guidelines,
and he may be self-medicating his anxiety with alcohol instead of relying on psychological
or pharmacological methods. She diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, mild, but
expressed  her  opinion  that  Applicant’s  alcohol  use  did  not  present  an  acute  security
concern because the amount Applicant consumes is “mediated by age-normative social
experiences in which alcohol is commonly seen as a social lubricant;” his alcohol use has
not impaired his work; and it is not contrary to his treating psychiatrist’s recommendations.
The psychologist found that Applicant did not minimize his alcohol use and concluded that
his use of alcohol did not rise to the point of impaired judgment. (GE 3.)
Applicant testified that his treating psychiatrist has recommended that he consume
less alcohol. (Tr. 41.) About 90% of Applicant’s drinking has been social, but he also drinks
alcohol to relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression. Since at least May 2017, Applicant
has played trivia at a bar on Tuesday nights with friends. (GE 2.) As of October 2018,
Applicant reported that he was drinking alcohol (usually beer) five to seven days per week,
in  quantities  of  three  to  five  beers  on  weeknights  and  six  beers  at  a  sitting  on  the
weekends. He had hangovers a few times per month. He expressed his belief that he
drinks too much, but it helps him to feel more confident and less anxious. (GE 3; Tr. 41.)
As of March 2020, Applicant was playing “bar trivia” and billiards at a bar. He started doing
trivia as an undergraduate in college and has been playing in a pool league for about a
year. (GE 2; Tr. 37-38, 47-48.) He had a “dry January” in 2020 where he abstained from
alcohol  for  one  month.  He  had  no  intention  to  maintain  abstinence  from  alcohol  and
resumed drinking (usually beer) in his previous pattern of two or three drinks almost every
night  and  five  to  six  drinks  on  the  weekends  over  a  course  of  about  five  hours  while
socializing  with  friends,  frequently  at  his  apartment.  (Tr.  50-52.)  As  of  March  2020,
Applicant was drinking to intoxication “not each night of the week, but more so than not
probably.” (Tr. 39-40.) Applicant now believes his alcohol use is having a negative health
effect in terms of long-term disadvantages should he continue to use alcohol to alleviate
symptoms  of  depression  and  anxiety.  (Tr.  41-42.)  He  has  been  trying  to  reduce  his
consumption for years, but the motivation to change is “not super strong.” (Tr. 49.) He
considers his alcohol use a “personal concern” that does not impact his professionalism or
ability to handle classified information. (Tr. 44.)
Work Reference
Applicant enjoys his job. He has missed work at times due to his depression, but his
supervisor is supportive.  (GE 3.) Applicant has had the same supervisor since August
2012.  Applicant’s  supervisor  described  Applicant  as  “a  dependable  and  dedicated
coworker with keen insights, great analytic skills, and a terrific knack for working in a team.”
Applicant is willing to assist his coworkers, and is a mentor to junior staff. He has good time
management skills, is diligent about his work, and takes project objectives seriously, often
working beyond regular hours to meet tight deadlines. Applicant always represents their
employer well when interacting with clients. His supervisor expressed complete confidence
in Applicant and his character.

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted the allegations in the SOR. He also provided
some  explanation  for  his  conduct,  as  well  as  a  statement  of  intent  not  to  use  illegal
drugs  in  the  future.  I  adopt  his  admissions  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact. (Item 2)
Applicant  is  32  years  old.  He  is  single  with  no  children.  He  has  worked  as  an
engineer for his current employer, a federal contractor, since October 2014. He holds a
bachelor’s degree. He has never held a security clearance. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency  from
approximately January 2006 to December 2018 (I find that the underlying facts alleged
in  SOR  ¶  1.b  are  consumed  within  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  without  adding  any
additional  disqualifying  conduct.  I  therefore  find  in  favor  of  Applicant  regarding  SOR  ¶
1.b). Applicant listed his use of marijuana from January 2006 to September 2017, in his
security  clearance  application  (SCA)  completed  in  March  2018.  He  described  the
frequency  of  this  use  as:  from  2006-2009,  approximately  three  times  a  week;  from
2009-2014, approximately less than one time a week; from 2014-2017, approximately 5-
10 times a year. He stated in his SCA, in response to a question about his future intent
to use controlled substances, that he “do[es] not intend to use due to health purposes
(asthma  and  respiratory  issues)  and  per  requirements  of  maintaining  a  security
clearance.” (Items 1, 3)
In  March  2019,  Applicant  admitted  to  a  defense  investigator  that  he  used
marijuana  one  additional  time  in  December  2018,  which  post-dated  the  completion  of
his  SCA.  He  explained  that  he  used  marijuana  in  December  2018  with  a  friend  who
supplied  it.  At  the  time,  he  had  not  heard  the  results  of  his  security  clearance
investigation and because several colleagues who applied at the time he did had been
granted  their  clearances,  he  assumed  his  clearance  was  denied  and  he  was  not
jeopardizing anything by using marijuana. He used while on vacation and when he had
no professional responsibilities. (Items 2, 4)
Applicant is aware that his company has a drug-free policy,  which is outlined in
its  employee  handbook.  His  company  is  unaware  of  his  past  marijuana  use.  He  has
never  received  drug  counseling  or  treatment.  He  continues  to  associate  with  friends
who  use  marijuana.  As  noted  above,  he  provided  a  written  statement  expressing  his
future intent not to use illegal controlled substances, noncompliance of which would be
grounds for revoking his security clearance. Since Applicant submitted this case for an
administrative determination, I was  unable to judge his credibility  based on demeanor.

"I  have  incorporated  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  responses  to  all  of  the  SOR
allegations  in  my  findings  of  fact  and  have  noted  his  corrections  to  the  relevant  time
periods referred to in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. Applicant’s personal information is
extracted from GE 3, his SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to
the  record.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  the  Government’s
FORM, Applicant’s response to the FORM, and the documentary evidence in the record,
I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant, 32, is unmarried and has no children. He has lived with his partner since
approximately  2006.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  2005  and  has  taken  some
college courses. He has worked for a defense contractor as a functions specialist since
2008. He was granted eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI)
in 2009.
In April 2016, Applicant self-reported to his security officer a one-time experience
he had with an illegal drug, ecstasy, in November 2013. He was working as a contractor
at a DOD agency with eligibility for access to SCI at that time. He wrote to his security
officer that his guilt over the use of the drug causes him “massive anxieties” and that he
is  not  a  “risk  of  ever  again  partaking  in  such  drug  use.”  He  expressed  his  regret  in
reporting  this incident in  an untimely  manner  because  it has been “an  embarrassment
and  tax  on my  conscience.” After self-reporting  this drug  use,  Applicant  disclosed  in  a
July 24, 2017 interview that he had also illegally used an inhalant commonly known as
whip-its  on  one  occasion  in  January  or  February  2017.  He  reported  that  on  that  one
occasion  he  used  20  or  more  canisters  of  nitrous  oxide  along  with  a  whipped  cream
dispenser to get high. In his Answer, he corrected the approximate date of this drug use
as November 2016. He also reported in his July 2017 interview using a different inhalant,
alkyl  nitrates,  three  weeks  before  the  interview.  The  common  name  of  this  inhalant  is
poppers, and it is used as a sexual aid. In his Answer, he corrected the date of his use of
poppers to have been in about March 2017. He wrote that he does not intend to use whip-
its or poppers again. In each of the three instances of illegal drug use, the drugs were
given to Applicant without any payment by him for the drug or inhalants. (GE 9 at 1-2; GE
8 at 5-6; Answer.)
Applicant has consistently maintained that his use of alcohol was a contributing
factor in each of his three uses of illegal drugs. He has reported that his use of alcohol
affected his judgment on each occasion. He has a long history of abusing alcohol. He has
blacked out from excessive alcohol consumption on at least two occasions, first in August
2011 and a second time in about June 2017. In the past, he has been cautioned by friends
and a family member about his excessive drinking. Due to his alcohol consumption, he
has  nearly  lost  his  relationships  with  close  friends,  including  his  long-time  partner.  He
stopped drinking for a brief period in 2017 and then resumed. In June 2018, he made a
commitment to sobriety. He claims in his FORM response that he is seeking treatment
for depression, which he believes is the underlying cause of his alcohol abuse. While I
accept  Applicant’s  statement  that  he  is  receiving  treatment  for  depression,  the  record
contains  no  evidence  regarding  any  treatment  by  an  alcohol-abuse  specialist,  with  an
exception of a one-time session with a counselor. There is no evidence in the record that
he has been diagnosed as having an alcohol-abuse disorder. (FORM response; GE 8 at
3-GE 4 at 2-4; GE 9 at 1.)
In his FORM response, Applicant asserted that he has discontinued contact with
the individuals with whom he has used the illegal drug and inhalants in the past. Since
choosing to remain sober, he has changed his social group to avoid persons who drink
alcohol  and  use  drugs.  He  expressed  a  desire  “to  self-correct  and  heal”  from  his
depression and past abuse of alcohol, and writes that “at current it is my intent to continue
to focus on self-care and repair.” (FORM response.)
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the five allegations in the SOR under Guideline
E, four of which allege falsifications. Two of these subparagraphs (SOR ¶¶ 3.a and 3.c)
allege  that  he  falsely  denied  any  illegal  drug  use  in  his  December  30,  2013  security
clearance application and falsely omitted his March 2017 use of poppers in his February
2018  SCA. The other two  falsification  allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  3.b  and  3.d)  assert  that he
falsely  denied  in  the  2013  application  and again  in  the SCA  that  he  used  illegal drugs
while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  The  earlier  application  is  not  included  in  the
Government  Exhibits  attached  to  the  FORM,  but  the  record  evidence  refers  to  that
application and to Applicant’s false denial in the application of any prior drug use, when
in fact, he used ecstasy one month before he signed the application and while he already
possessed a clearance. (GE 5 at 8.)
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  falsely  answered  a  question  in  his
February  2018  SCA  that  asked  if  he  had  “illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled
substances” in the past seven years or while possessing a security clearance, by failing
to disclose his use of poppers in 2017. In his SCA, Applicant disclosed his past use of
ecstasy  and  whip-its,  but  failed  to  disclose  his  use  of  poppers.  In  his  March  2018
background  interview  for  his  pending  collateral  clearance,  he  made  the  same  two
disclosures and omitted his use of poppers. By admitting the falsification allegations in
SOR ¶¶ 3.c and 3.d, Applicant has conceded that the use of the inhalant alkyl nitrates, or
poppers, constitutes substance misuse for purposes of a security clearance adjudication
just as the use of whip-its is a substance misuse, and his use of poppers should have
been disclosed in his SCA. (GE 11 at 3-4.)
The fifth admitted Guideline E allegation cross alleges the security concerns raised
in the first two paragraphs of the SOR, which set forth the allegations under Guidelines H
and G. Applicant is not disputing any of the facts in the SOR, except that he corrected the
approximate dates of his use of the two inhalants in his Answer.
As a result of a security investigation by another government agency, Applicant’s
eligibility for SCI access was suspended in July 2017 and then revoked on November 30,
2017. The revocation decision of the other government agency was finalized on January
30, 2018. (GE 5, 11 at 3.)

internship with a defense contractor. After his college graduation in 2015, he has been
employed full time by this defense contractor as an electrical design engineer. He does
not currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 25-28; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency,  from
approximately October 2009 to January 2019. He disclosed his history of marijuana use
on his SCA he completed in January 2019, and he admitted this allegation in his SOR
response. (Tr. 30, 32-33; GE 1)
In October 2009, Applicant first started using marijuana during his senior year of
high school. He used it with friends on three or four occasions. He did not use marijuana
during his college years as he was heavily involved in the university’s Christian student
fellowship ministry. He resumed his use of marijuana in August 2016 and in July 2017,
during vacations he took by himself to State A. He met different individuals from different
countries  at  the  hostels  he  stayed  in  during  these  trips.  The  use  and  purchase  of
marijuana  was  legal  in  State  A.  On  both  occasions  he  purchased  marijuana  from  a
dispensary, and he smoked approximately three joints with individuals he met over the
course of each vacation. In July 2018, Applicant and his girlfriend vacationed in State A.
They  purchased  edible  marijuana  and  a  couple  of  joints  at  the  dispensary,  and  they
shared their marijuana with other people they met at the hostels. (Tr. 30, 32-38, 45, 51;
GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant  was  aware  that  although  marijuana  was  legal  in  State  A,  it  remained
illegal under Federal law. He returned to his state of residence where marijuana use is
legally prohibited. In about November 2018, he smoked marijuana recreationally with his
friend. His last use of marijuana occurred in January 2019, when he smoked a joint with
his friend again at his friend’s house. Applicant felt that the use of marijuana added no
value to his life. He finally reached a point where he wanted to make positive changes
and move forward with his life and career, and he made a decision to never use marijuana
again. Shortly after he made that decision, he was notified by his supervisor that he was
one of two employees selected out of 12 individuals who would be sponsored for a DOD
security clearance. (Tr. 31-32, 39-43, 45-48)
Applicant’s employer required him to take a drug test in about February 2019, and
he tested negative for all controlled substances. Applicant has used only marijuana and
not any other illegal drug, to include the misuse of prescription medication. He has never
been arrested or received treatment for his use of marijuana. He no longer associates
with people who use marijuana. He signed a statement of intent to never use marijuana
again, and his co-habitant and friends are very supportive of his commitment. He further
acknowledged any personal involvement with marijuana would be acceptable grounds for
immediate  revocation  of  his  DOD  security  clearance.  His  supervisor  is  aware  of  the
security concern addressed in his SOR, and he is fully supportive of Applicant. Other co-
workers,  supervisors,  and  friends  who  provided  character  reference  letters  were  also
aware  of  his  past  use  of  marijuana.  In  2018  Applicant  received  a job  promotion and  a
prestigious award from his employer. He recently purchased a house. Applicant feels he’s
matured greatly these last few years. (Tr. 29-31, 44-46, 49-50, 52-58, 61)

Applicant  disclosed  on  his  e-QIP
that  he  had  occasionally  used
tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC),  by  smoking  marijuana  or eating  ingestible  THC  products,
with his wife at home or with friends in a social environment. He did this about four times
a year between August 2008 and December 2016. At that point he stopped because he
had  agreed  to  apply  for  a  security  clearance.  He  knew  then,  and  fully  believes,  that
substance misuse is inconsistent with national security eligibility. His wife agrees with and
shares in his abstinence from use of THC. During most of the time he used THC, it was
legal to do so under the law of his state of residence. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 34-39, 43-44.)
Applicant and a group of friends have attended a regional rock music concert held
during  August  each  year.  Marijuana  was  sometimes  offered  and  shared  among  the
friends. During the 2017 concert, Applicant declined to share in the friends’ marijuana use
because he had applied for a security clearance and wanted to comply with the eligibility
standards. By August 2018, however, he had heard nothing from the Office of Personnel
Management  (OPM),  or  any  other  government  entity,  concerning  his  January  2017
clearance application, and assumed that it had been denied. At the concert in 2018, with
marijuana  use  having  become  legal  in  the  state  and  assuming  there  was  no  further
Federal interest in his conduct, he shared in using a marijuana cigarette being smoked
by the group. Several days later, he was contacted by an OPM investigator to schedule
his  unsworn  subject  interview  and  realized  that  he  was  still  under  consideration  for  a
clearance. He has not used any THC since then, including when he attended the concert
event in August 2019. (Answer; GE 2; Tr. 28-30, 41-43.)
The  veracity  of  Applicant’s  frank  prehearing  disclosures,  about  his  otherwise-
unknowable  minor  THC  use,  was  enhanced  by  his  forthright,  consistent,  and
uncontroverted hearing testimony.  He rejected the advice of  an attorney he consulted,
who  suggested  that  he  attempt  to  portray  his  August  2018  use  of  marijuana  as  a
temporary lapse in judgment that he did not even think about before participating when
someone passed it around. He described his rejection of this advice as follows:
To  me,  an  excuse  such  as  that  shows  someone  who's  prone  to  making
mistakes, bad decisions, or can be swayed to make a poor choice, which is
a serious character flaw I would expect you all to consider. In truth, I made
a calculated decision. I was well aware of my security clearance process,
but I had not received a statement regarding an interim clearance or any
intent of the process moving forward. As this is the only time I have been –
this  is  the  only  time  I've  been  through  this  process,  I  acted  on  my  own
assumption that I would not be hearing from the government regarding my
clearance and that I must have been denied. After making that assumption,
I  made  the  decision  to  enjoy  myself  at  a  concert  with  friends,  where  we
ultimately shared a joint attending the event -- before attending the event.
Days  after  the  event,  I  received  notification  from  an  investigator  about
scheduling an interview for my security clearance. It was at that time when
I felt immediate regret in my recent decision. (Tr. 29-30.)
Applicant  then  expressed  his complete  acceptance  of  the  policy  that  substance
misuse is inconsistent with national security eligibility, and his sincere reasons for wanting
to  abide  by  such  limitations  in  order  to  fulfill  his  desire  to  contribute  to  Federal  cloud
computing and network information security efforts. (Tr. 26-29, 44-46.) After the hearing,
he submitted a signed and sworn declaration  of his intent to permanently abstain from
drug involvement and substance misuse, and his agreement to the immediate revocation
of his security clearance should he be involved with or misuse drugs in the future. He has
kept appropriate peers and supervisors within his company informed concerning his past
use of THC and his progress through the security clearance process. (AE B.)
Applicant’s supervisory senior vice president, and two longtime friends who hold
responsible leadership positions in other fields, wrote letters describing their admiration
for  his  character,  integrity,  and  trustworthiness.  Each  has  known  him  in  different
capacities, but they uniformly praised his responsibility, dedication, and honesty. His vice
president  noted  that  he  has  developed  a  reputation  as,  “a  stickler,”  with  respect  to
observing and expecting strict compliance with applicable rules and procedures. (AE C.)
Applicant’s two  most  recent performance  evaluations describe  his professionalism
in meeting  customer requirements,  growing  natural leadership  role  within the  company,
and  successful assumption  of increased  responsibility  as a  senior consultant.  He  fully  met
all   standards,   and   exceeded   expectations  for  the   majority   of   them   during   the   periods
involved. (AE D.)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.
(HE 3) He denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating and mitigating
information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old senior technical consultant in information technology or
senior network administrator. (Tr. 25, 27; HE 3 at 1; GE 1; AE A) In 2009, he received a
high school diploma. (GE 1) In 2016, he received an associate’s degree. (Tr. 26; GE 1)
He needs one credit to receive a bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 26-27) He is scheduled to receive
a bachelor’s degree in early 2020 in network and cyber security. (Tr. 27; AE A; AE D) He
completed  numerous  information  technology  certification  courses  and  endeavored  to
enhance  his  technical  expertise  and  value  to  his  employers.  (HE  3;  AE  B;  AE  C)  He
served in the Army National Guard from 2012 through 2018. (HE 3 at 2) When he was
honorably discharged, he was a specialist (E-4). (AE E) He is not married, and he does
not have any children. (Tr. 26; GE 1) He has been dating his fiancée for about two years.
(Tr.  26)  She  and  her  family  are  very  supportive  of  Applicant.  (Tr.  47)  His  current
employment is in jeopardy if his security clearance is not reinstated or continued. (Tr. 28)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying degrees of frequency
in the spring and early summer of 2014. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant tested positive for
the  presence  of  the  marijuana  metabolite  in  his  urine  in  approximately  June  2014.
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. (HE 3)
In Applicant’s December 13, 2012 SCA, he disclosed marijuana use in 2006. (Tr.
49) He said he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 49)
On  October  25,  2014,  Applicant  submitted  a  request  for  a  suspended  general
discharge from the Army National Guard. (GE 3) He said he used marijuana to help him
cope with diagnosed depression. (GE 3) He used marijuana in lieu of prescription drugs
he was authorized to take. (GE 3) He did not reveal how many times he used marijuana
or  how  long  he  used  marijuana  before  it  was  detected  through  a  urinalysis  test.  He
successfully  completed the  Army  National  Guard  probation period.  (Tr.  33-34)  In  June
2017, Applicant responded to an SOR based on a positive urinalysis test showing use of
marijuana in July 2014. (Tr. 35; AE J; AE K; AE L) On June 30, 2017, his security manager
advised Applicant “your Secret clearance was adjudicated on 28 June 17[, and] the SOR
was sent out in error.” (Tr. 40; AE L)
In his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant said he used marijuana from
June  1,  2014,  to  August  10,  2014,  on  a  weekly  basis.  (GE  3  at  4)  A  close  friend  of
Applicant’s said Applicant told him that he used marijuana on a weekly basis for about
five months until he was caught on the urinalysis test in 2014. (Tr. 76) In 2014, Applicant’s
friend  advised  Applicant  to  stop  using  marijuana;  however,  Applicant  continued  to  use
marijuana. (Tr. 77) Applicant said he stopped using marijuana because of “fear of losing
my military career and all civilian side consequences.” (GE 3 at 6) He received substance
abuse counseling in June 2016. (GE 3 at 8)
At his hearing, Applicant said he used marijuana once in 2007 when he was about
16 years old, and then resumed his marijuana use in 2014. (Tr. 29) He used marijuana
on  a  weekly  basis  in  2014,  and  he  purchased  the  marijuana  from  a  friend  he  knew  in
college. (Tr. 31) In 2014, he used marijuana because of stress in his relationship with his
parents. (Tr. 30) His mother was ill. (Tr. 30) His father was an alcoholic, and his father
was “combative and aggressive.” (Tr. 30; HE 3 at 2-3) He does not associate with the
person who provided marijuana to him or anyone else involved in marijuana distribution.
(Tr. 32, 48)
Applicant suffered from depression in 2014. He sought and received treatment for
his depression, and he moved out of his home. (HE 3 at 2) His mother remarried, and
Applicant is close to his mother. (Tr. 46; HE 3 at 2)
Applicant changed after the positive urinalysis test in 2014 showing marijuana use,
and he stopped using marijuana. (Tr. 32) He exercises and has healthy eating habits. (HE
3 at 4) He stays away from drug users, and he strives to spend time with his family. (HE
3  at  4)  He  did  not  test  positive  for  use  of  any  illegal  drugs  after  2014.  (HE  3  at  5)  He
expressed his remorse for his illegal drug use. (HE 3 at 5)
Applicant promised not to use illegal drugs in the future. (HE 3 at 5) He provided
“a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse,
acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national
security eligibility.” (HE 3 at 5 (citing AE H); see AG ¶ 26(b)(3))
Possession of small amounts of marijuana has been increasingly decriminalized
in various states and the District of Columbia. (AE I) No evidence was presented of repeal
of  the  federal  statute  prohibiting  possession  of  marijuana  or  revocation  of  the  policy
prohibition against use of marijuana by security clearance holders.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant responded, “No,” to a question in Section 23 of
his April 23, 2018 SCA about whether he used any controlled substance in the previous
seven years. (Tr. 43-44) At the time he completed his April 23, 2018 SCA, he was serving
in  the  Army  National  Guard.  As  indicated  in  the  previous  section,  Applicant  used
marijuana for several months in 2014 while serving in the Army National Guard.
At his hearing, Applicant said the reason he answered, “No,” about his marijuana
use in the previous seven years was because he believed the question sought information
not previously disclosed. (Tr. 44) He did not intend to conceal his marijuana use. (Tr. 44-
45) The Army National Guard already had the information about his positive urinalysis
test for marijuana, and DOD CAF had the information as indicated in his SOR response.
(Tr. 45) In his SCA, he indicated his security worthiness had previously been investigated.
(Tr. 45)
Applicant responded, “No,” to two additional questions in Section 23 of his April
23,  2018  SCA  that  asked  about  whether  he  was  ordered,  asked,  or  advised  to  seek
counseling  or  treatment  as  a  result  of  his  use  of  illegal  drugs  and  whether  he  ever
voluntarily sought counseling or treatment as a result of his use of a controlled substance.
(Tr.  54;  GE  1)  Applicant  was  supposed  to  attend  an  Army  Alcohol  Substance  Abuse
Program (ASAP); however, he did not actually attend ASAP. (Tr. 62; OPM ROI at 21) In
June 2016, he attended 16 hours in a substance abuse education seminar provided by a
civilian  entity.  (GE  3)  He  successfully  completed  the  course.  (GE  3)  Applicant  said  he
answered, “No,” because he thought the SCA was seeking new information about drug
abuse counseling. (Tr. 54)
Applicant responded, “No,” to a question in Section 21 of his April 23, 2018 SCA
that asked about whether he had “EVER been diagnosed by a physician or other health
professional . . . with [a] psychotic disorder, . . . [or] bipolar mood disorder . . . ?” (GE 1)
In  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  said  he  was  met  with  a  psychiatrist  in
2015 and 2017, and he received Lexapro, Lamictal and Zoloft. (GE 3 at 4, 7) Lexapro or
“Escitalopram is used to treat depression and anxiety.” (www.webmd.com) “Lamictal is
also  used  to  delay  mood  episodes  in  adults  with  bipolar  disorder  (manic  depression).”
www.drugs.com.  “Zoloft  (sertraline)  is  used  to  treat  depression,  obsessive-compulsive
disorder and panic and anxiety disorders.” (Id.) In response to a DOHA interrogatory, he
wrote  that  the  reason  the  medication  was  prescribed  was  “bipolar  depression”  and  he
provided the name of the physician that prescribed the prescription drugs. (GE 3 at 4)
Applicant  admitted  he  received  treatment  for  depression  while  he  was  in  the  Army
National  Guard.  (Tr.  60)  He  did  not  disclose  his  treatment  for  depression  on  his  SCA
because he “viewed it as a stigma.” He “didn’t want people to know he had it.” (Tr. 61) He
did reveal the treatment to his team leader, but he was worried about the “stigma” and
being “portrayed as weak.” (Tr. 65)
Applicant responded, “No,” to a question in Section 13A of his April 23, 2018 SCA
that asked Applicant whether in the previous seven years he “received a written warning,
been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace,
such as a violation of security policy.” (Tr. 50-51; GE 1) He did not disclose any adverse
actions he received from the Army National Guard for using marijuana. Applicant received
a written warning and reprimand for using marijuana in the Army National Guard after his
2014 positive urinalysis test. (Tr. 51-52) Applicant said he should have indicated, “Yes,”
in response to the question. (Tr. 52) He explained that he answered, “No,” because he
did not receive any adverse action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and he was
not discharged from the Army National Guard for marijuana use. (Tr. 52)
SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  that  Applicant  stated  during  an  August  2,  2018  Office  of
Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) that he has not used any
drugs in the previous seven years. (Tr. 55)
The  August  2,  2018  OPM  PSI  is  a  summary  non-verbatim  description  of  what
Applicant told an OPM investigator. His OPM PSI states that Applicant “confirmed that he
has not used any drugs in the last seven years.” (OPM Report of Investigation (ROI) at
11) Applicant “was given every opportunity to provide clarification or additional information
in regards to any disciplinary actions taken against him during his time in the military, but
[he] did not provide anything and had to be confronted.” (OPM ROI at 12) Applicant was
then confronted with documentation from the Army National Guard showing he was given
a suspended discharge in 2014 because of his use of marijuana discovered through the
positive urinalysis discussed previously. (Id.) He was on probation for 12 months. (Id. at
13)  Applicant  said  he  did  not  remember  how  many  times  he  used  marijuana.  (Id.)
Applicant said he used marijuana to help him cope with his depression. (Id. at 12-13) The
Army suggested that Applicant receive treatment for his depression and drug use. (Id. at
13)
Applicant’s  August  2,  2018  OPM  PSI  states  that  Applicant  did  not  provide
information about his marijuana use because “the issue was never filed under UCMJ and
there  were  no  punishments  that  affect  [Applicant’s]  job.”  (OPM  ROI  at  13)  Applicant’s
October 30, 2018 OPM PSI states that Applicant did not provide information about his
marijuana use in 2014 for the following reason:
[T]his was only an issue within his unit. It was kept between his team leader,
himself, and the captain who wrote the memorandum [about his suspended
discharge].  This  was  not  common  knowledge  within  the  unit.  Because  of
that  and  the  fact  that  it  did  not  fall  under  the  UCMJ,  [Applicant]  did  not
believe that the information has to be listed. (Tr. 62-63; OPM ROI at 17)
In response to a request for an explanation for why he gave a different answer to
the OPM investigator about his rational for not disclosing his history of marijuana use in
2014 than at his hearing, Applicant said he suspected he did not disclose his marijuana
use on his SCA due to being “ashamed.” (Tr. 63) He also thought, “hey, it’s already been
noted.  It’s  already  in  the  records.  You  can  let  it  slide  essentially.”  (Tr.  64)  He
acknowledged that he “lied,” and there was a strong probability that the government would
discover the truth. (Tr. 66)
In his SOR response, Applicant said he did not intentionally lie to security officials
because he believed security officials would examine his record and discover his previous
positive urinalysis test showing his marijuana use. (HE 3 at 6) He assumed the previous
security-related adjudication of his marijuana use in 2017 would be part of the record. (HE
3 at 6) He said, “[h]e had no new information to report-no recent use-and as such, did not
report  anything.  He  regrets  now  that  he  did  not  re-report  his  previously  reported  2014
issues, and he will not make this mistake again.” (Tr. 55; HE 3 at 7)
Applicant promised to be honest in future security matters. (Tr. 65-66) He faced
adversity  and  acknowledged  his  mistakes.  (Tr.  67,  78-79)  He  promised  to  strive  to
improve. (Tr. 67) He intends to establish his integrity and trustworthiness. (Tr. 67)
Character Evidence
Nine supervisors, coworkers, colleagues, or friends or both as well as his fiancée
provided  character  statements  supporting  reinstatement  or  continuation  of  Applicant’s
access  to  classified  information.  (Tr.  70-91;  AE  B;  AE  F)  The  general  sense  of  their
statements  is  that  Applicant  is  exceptionally  diligent,  knowledgeable,  intelligent,
meticulous, professional, generous, honest, reliable, and trustworthy. His hard work and
professionalism  made  substantial  contributions  to  mission  accomplishment.  He  learns
from his mistakes and does not repeat them. None of his character statements described
any  use  of  illegal  drugs  after  2014.  He  completed  several  military  courses,  and  he
achieved good to outstanding course evaluations. (AE E) In one course, he was selected
as the distinguished honor graduate. (AE E) There is no evidence of adverse employment
actions, security violations, improper disclosure of classified information, or that Applicant
otherwise compromised national security. (Tr. 28)

"After considering the FORM, which includes an October 25, 2014 pronouncement
from the then Director of National Intelligence that marijuana use remains unlawful under
federal law, and that changes to state laws regarding the use of marijuana do not alter
existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Item 9), I make the following findings of
fact:
Applicant is 29 years old and divorced after a marriage of less than six months. A
high school graduate, Applicant attended college for two semesters before dropping out in
November 2009. Applicant then worked at a nursing home, initially as a dishwasher and
then as a certified nursing assistant until August 2012, when she enlisted in the United
States military. Applicant injured herself and could not complete basic training. She was
discharged for medical reasons in October 2012. (Items 3-4.)
Applicant worked as a certified nursing assistant at a different nursing facility from
October  2012  to  July  2014  when  she  was  fired  over  a  disagreement  with  the  center’s
director, apparently involving the use of bedding supplies on the midnight shift. For the next
two years, she was employed in customer service for a hotel. From July 2016 to March
2018, Applicant was an assistant manager at a pizza restaurant. After a short stint as a
hotel  housekeeper,  Applicant  started  working  in  June  2018  as  a  unit  coordinator  for  a
defense contractor providing services for the Defense Health Agency. (Item 3.)
On  October  18,  2018,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) for eligibility for a public trust position.
Applicant responded affirmatively to a police record inquiry concerning whether she had
ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs. She disclosed that she had
been charged with misdemeanor possession of cannabis (2.5 to 10 grams) in December
2015, and fined for the offense in approximately October 2016. (Item 3.)
In response to an inquiry on her October 2018 SF 86 concerning whether she had
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances  in  the  last  seven  years,  Applicant
indicated that she used “THC” (tetrahydrocannabinol) from October 2012 to October 2018
and stated, “I have a medical cannabis card.” She answered “Yes” to whether she intends
to use THC in the future and explained, “I have [an] eligible medical condition that allows
me.” (Item 3.) Applicant obtained a medical marijuana card in October 2016 that legally
authorized her to use and possess up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis until October 2019. (Items
4-5.)
On  January  16,  2019,  Applicant  was  interviewed  under  oath  by  an  authorized
investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant disclosed that she
first tried marijuana when she was discharged from the military for medical reasons. She
stated  that  disillusionment  from  being  denied  a  military  career,  and  because  of  peer
pressure, she accepted an offer of a “joint” from a friend while they were out walking in
October 2012. She admitted that she used marijuana recreationally approximately 20 times
with her now former spouse between 2012 and 2016. The marijuana was obtained from a
dealer, whose name Applicant could not recall. Applicant stated that after obtaining her
medical marijuana card in October 2016, she acquired her marijuana at a dispensary. She
described her current use as approximately half of a marijuana cigarette every evening
before bed. She denied any intention to use marijuana or other drug recreationally in the
future, but expressed that she would continued to use marijuana as long as she has a valid
marijuana  card.  Applicant  explained  that  if  her  marijuana  card  is  not  renewed  on  its
expiration in October 2019, she would pursue conventional methods to treat her medical
conditions. About her December 2015 arrest, Applicant reportedly recollected that she had
smoked a marijuana cigarette about two hours before being stopped for a license plate
violation;  that  she  was  charged  with  cannabis  possession  and  drug  paraphernalia
possession; that the paraphernalia possession charge was dismissed; and that she was
placed on 12 months of supervision and paid fine and court costs of between $750 and
$1,500 for the drug possession. (Item 4.)
On July 10, 2019, Applicant responded to interrogatories from DOHA. In response to
a drug-use inquiry, Applicant indicated that she used marijuana between October 2012 and
July  9,  2019,  that  she  uses  it  “everyday,”  and  that  she  intends  to  continue  to  use  it
“medically.”  She  denied  any  association  with  persons  who  use  illegal  drugs,  any
involvement in illegal purchase or sale of drugs, and any counseling or treatment to abstain
from the use of drugs. She denied making any lifestyle changes conducive to abstinence
and explained, “I currently have a medical cannabis card, no changes as far as continued
use  for  medical  purposes.”  Applicant  again  expressed  an  intention  to  continue  to  use
marijuana as long as she has a medical marijuana card. (Item 4.)
With the interrogatories, Applicant was provided for her review a summary of her
January 2019 interview with the OPM investigator. Applicant indicated the summary was
inaccurate in some aspects. She denied any report or inference that she had purchased
marijuana  illegally  and,  about  her  arrest,  she  stated  that  she  was  “charged  with
paraphernalia,” and that the possession charge was dismissed. She added the following:
I was charged before I had my medical card, but was using marijuana for
medical purposes before any charge. I currently still have my medical card
and plan to renew it as of October 2019. (Item 4.)
With her receipt of the FORM on November 13, 2019, Applicant was informed of the
DOD’s policies and Department of Justice (DOJ)’s prosecutorial guidance regarding the
use of marijuana for recreational or medicinal purposes, including the following:
  While some states have decriminalized or legalized limited recreational use or have
authorized  the  use  of  marijuana  for  specific  medical  conditions,  marijuana  is  a
Schedule I controlled drug under federal law (no accepted medical use) and remains
illegal.
  Executive  Order  12564  mandates  a  drug-free  workplace  and  drug-free  federal
workforce.
  An individual’s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of
marijuana  remains  relevant  in  adjudicating  his  or  her  eligibility  for  occupying  a
sensitive  national  security  position,  notwithstanding  DOJ  guidance  that  it  is  an
inefficient use of limited federal resources to prosecute individuals who comply with
existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana.
  Federal  agencies  are  statutorily  prohibited  from  granting  or  renewing  national
security eligibility for any covered individual who is an unlawful user of a controlled
substance or is an addict. (Items 6-9.)
Applicant did not submit any information in response to the FORM. Based on her
stated intention to continue to use marijuana while she had a medical marijuana card, it is
likely  (although  not  conclusively  established)  that  she  continued  to  use  and  purchase
marijuana  to  at  least  October  2019.  The  record  before  me  is  silent  as  to  whether  she
renewed her medical marijuana card in October 2019.

"Applicant is a 52-year-old executive of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her  current  employer  or  a  predecessor  company  since  1985.  She  is  applying  for  a
security  clearance  for  the  first  time.  She  earned  a  General  Educational  Development
(GED) high school equivalency degree in 1984. She earned  associate, bachelor’s, and
master’s degrees in 2002, 2004, and 2008. She is married with two adult children and
two grandchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 18, 28-31, 34, 44; GE 1)
Applicant smoked marijuana when she was a teenager and young adult. In 1983,
when  she  was  15  years  old,  she  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of  drug
paraphernalia.  The  charge  was  dismissed.  She  used  cocaine  on  about  two  or  three
occasions in 1985 or 1986. She did not particularly care for it, and never used it again.
(Tr. at 36-38, 44; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A)
Applicant did not  use any  illegal drugs  between  about  1986 and  2015.  In about
2015, she resumed smoking marijuana on an irregular basis after it was offered to her
by a friend. Applicant does not live in a state that has legalized possession of marijuana.
She  used  it  a  “handful”  of  times  with  her  friend  who  provided  the  marijuana.  Her
company  has  a  policy  against  using  illegal  drugs  or  being  under  the  influence  during
working hours, but it does not have a policy against all drug use. (Tr. at 38-39, 40-44;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, F)
Applicant  reported  all  her  illegal  drug  use  on  the  Questionnaire  for  National
Security Positions (SF 86) she submitted in August 2017. She noted that she intended
to  use  marijuana  in  the  future  with  the  following  caveat:  “On  special  occasion  only  –
unless the security clearance prohibits it then I won’t.”
During her background interview in September 2018, she discussed her drug use
and admitted that she smoked marijuana in August 2018. She indicated that she did not
think that marijuana use was a “big deal.” She explained that marijuana use was legal in
many  states  and  that  there  was  less  of  a  stigma  attached  to  using  marijuana.  She
indicated  that  she  intended  to  continue  to  smoke  marijuana,  but  that  she  would  be
willing to stop if required by her employer. (Tr. at 52-53; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  realized  after  the  interview  that  her  answers  were  worrisome  to  the
investigator.  She  indicated  in  her  response  to  the  SOR  that  “self-reflection  made  [her]
realize  that  this  very  rare  occasion  of  self-gratification  is  not  worth  losing  [her]  job  or
being viewed as someone that can’t be trusted.” She has not used any illegal drug since
before  her  interview.  She  wrote  that  receiving  the  SOR  “was  both  embarrassing  and

I will never regret my  being honest during this process; it is one-hundred
percent  who  I  am  as  a  person.  I  do,  however,  regret  that  the  choices  I
have  made  as  an  adult  have  put  me  in  this  embarrassing  situation  in

Applicant credibly testified that she did not intend to use marijuana or any other
illegal  drug  in  the  future.  She  still  sees  the  friend  she  smoked  marijuana  with,  but
Applicant  told  her  that  she  no  longer  uses  marijuana.  She  does  not  know  if  the  friend
still  smokes  marijuana,  as  the  friend  does  not  do  so  in  her  presence.  Applicant
completed  a  16-hour  drug  and  alcohol  awareness  class  in  November  2019.  She  now
completely realizes that marijuana use is against the law, not responsible conduct, and
that it is a “big deal.” She provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal
drug use with the acknowledgment that any future involvement with illegal drugs would
be grounds for revocation of her security clearance. (Tr. at 41-42, 46-48, 53; Applicant’s
response to SOR; AE A-C)
Applicant  informed  her  family  and  management  in  her company  about her drug
use. She started in her original company in 1985 when she was 18.  Her husband has
worked for the company almost as long.  She rose through the company and earned a
management  position  in  about  1995.  She  became  better  educated,  continued  to  grow
into  a  senior-level  manager,  and  became  a  director  in  2013.  She  volunteers  in  her
community  and  is  well  respected  by  other  senior  management  in  her  company,  as
reflected  by  the  testimony  of  another  executive,  multiple  character  letters,  and  other
documents.  She  is  praised  for  her  excellent  job  performance,  strong  moral  character,
loyalty,  professionalism,
judgment,  work  ethic,  dedication,  reliability,

"Applicant  is  39  years  old.    He  is  married  and  has  two  children.    He  has  a
bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor
as  an  Engineer.    He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment.
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes the use of marijuana from
about  January  2016  to  January  2019,  while  granted  a  security  clearance.    Applicant
admits  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR,  except  allegation  1.c.    He  began
working  for  his  current  employer  in  2004.    He  obtained  a  security  clearance  in  2009.
Applicant is an engineering supervisor who oversees nine or ten employees.  He states
that  he  is up  to  date  on  all  security  training.  With  the  exception  of  one minor  security
infraction  where  he  committed  a  confidential  level  spill,  his  security  record  is
unblemished.
Applicant married  in 2003.    He  explained that his wife  had a medical  marijuana
card and purchased marijuana at a dispensary to help her sleep.  Applicant tried it and
found  it  helpful  in  improving  his  sleep.    Applicant  understood  at  the  time  he  used  the
marijuana that even though it became legal in the state, it was still against Federal law
and clearly prohibited by the DoD.  Applicant testified that he has undergone numerous
DoD security briefings and mandatory training offered by his employer.  He decided to
reveal his marijuana use to the Government when marijuana became legal under state
law, which he believed to be in January 2016.  At that time, his security officer reminded
him  that  marijuana  was  still  against  Federal  law.    Applicant  chose  to  continue  to  use
marijuana regardless of the Federal law.  He states that he  thought it would only be a
small  blemish  on  his  record.    He  stated  that  he  did  not  understand  the  serious
ramifications, and did not realize that he could lose his security clearance because of it.
Applicant stated that the last time he used marijuana was the night before his hearing.
(Tr. p. 34.)
Applicant  explained  that  he  and  his  wife  continue  to  use  marijuana.    Even  his
children know that  he uses marijuana.  Applicant states that he is willing to stop using
marijuana if he has to, but his preference would be to continue using it if he could.  (Tr.
p. 35.)  He states that he is also willing to subject himself to random drug testing.  (Tr. p.
36.)
Applicant further explained that he does not and has never used marijuana while
at work.  He states that at work, he is always clear-headed and his use of marijuana on
his  personal  time  has  not  negatively  impact  his  work  product  in  any  way.    Applicant
states that he is an advid runner, who participates in numerous running events around
the country.  He is committed to training, eating, and sleeping correctly.  (Tr. p. 39.)  He
testified that he ran the Boston Marathon in April, all while smoking marijuana.  (Tr. p.
40.)  He states that he was not “high” during the run, but he did smoke marijuana.  He
believes  that  marijuana  is  a  performance  enhancer  for  him,  and  he  has  had  a  faster
recovery time when he smokes marijuana.
Applicant  testified  that  he  believes  he  is  an  excellent  candidate  for  a  security
clearance.  He is educated, financially responsible, a native-born American citizen, has
no foreign contacts, has never been arrested, is athletic and healthy, and comes from a
long  line  of  military  veterans,  as  both  his  father  and  step-father  are  Navy  and  Army
veterans respectively.  (Applicant’s Exhibit C.)
Performance  reviews  of  the  Applicant  for  the  periods  from  2006  through  the
present reflect that he either “highly meets” or “exceeds” his job requirements in every
category.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, all with explanations. He denied SOR ¶ 2.a,
but  only  as  to  the  date  of  the  arrest.  His  admissions  and  statements  are  incorporated
into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old. He and his wife have been married for about three and
a half years. They have two young children. Applicant earned his bachelor’s degree in
2004,  his  master’s  degree  in  2007,  and  his  Ph.D.  in  2013.  He  then  spent  about  two
years  in  a  post-doctorate  fellowship  in  Europe,  until  December  2015.  He  was
unemployed for most of 2016, until beginning his current job with a defense contractor
in the United States, in October 2016. He has a $135,000 annual salary. (Tr. 29-33, 44-
46; GE 1; GE 2)
During his years in school, Applicant was in a band. During the summer of 2007,
the  band  was  on  tour  in  a  large  U.S.  city  several  hundred  miles  from  his  home.  One
night,  before  a  performance,  Applicant  was  sitting  in  the  back  of  the  band’s  van,
reading. Two others got into the front seats and began to smoke marijuana.  This drew
the attention of a nearby police officer, and all of the occupants of the van were pulled
out and arrested. (Tr. 34-35, 56-58; GE 2 at 5)
Applicant spent about 20 hours in jail and was arraigned in court the next day on
a charge of possession of marijuana. He said he was advised by legal counsel to plead
no contest so he would not have to return to court, in a city far from his home, to dispute
the charge. He was placed on unsupervised probation for a year, after which the charge
would  be  dismissed.  (Tr.  33-37;  Answer;  GE  2)  Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  use
marijuana during his period of probation. (Tr. 79)
Applicant reported the arrest on his SCA, giving an estimated date of July 2007
(as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a). (GE 1 at 68) In his Answer and at hearing, he gave the date
as June 2007. (Tr. 34) He has had no subsequent arrests or offenses. (Tr. 73-74)
Applicant  denied  using  marijuana  on  that  particular  occasion.  (Tr.  35)  He
provided a character letter from a friend of his who was there that night. In the letter, the
friend  also  provided factual details  that  largely  comport with  Applicant’s  explanation  of
what  happened.  (AE  C)  The  record  does  not  include  police  or  court  documents  about
the offense. In the letter, the friend also vouches for Applicant’s character.
Applicant  began  using  marijuana  in  1997,  when  he  was  in  high  school.  He
reported  his  marijuana  use  on  his  October  2016  SCA.  He  reported  daily  use  of
marijuana  from  1997  to  2000.  He  also  said,  “I  smoke  marijuana  on  occasion”  with  a
frequency of “monthly or less.” (GE 1 at 70) (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant  also  used  marijuana  while  he  was  living  in  Europe.  He  knew  it  was
illegal to possess marijuana in the country where he lived. (Tr. 59-61, 69) He also knew
that his use and possession of marijuana was illegal in the U.S. under federal law. (Tr.
70-71)
Applicant  testified  that  he  used  marijuana  about  three  times  after  filling  out  his
SCA.  His  use  was  confined  to  his  home.  (Tr.  71)  His  last  use  of  marijuana  was  in
December  2017.  (Tr.  76-77,  80)  He  acknowledged  that  engaging  in  illegal  activity  (by
continuing  to  use  marijuana)  while  applying  for  a  clearance  was  “a  bit  of  a
contradiction.”  (Tr.  73)  Applicant  testified  that  it  became  clear  to  him  during  his
background  interview  (May  2018)  that  his  marijuana  use  might  negatively  impact  his
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  (Tr.  80-81)  He  testified, however, that  he
thought he might not be granted a clearance, not because of the drug use, but because
of his foreign ties. (Tr. 39, 61-62)
Applicant  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  from  January  1999  to  May  2014,
about 10 times. (SOR ¶ 1.d)(Tr. 50-51) He used the prescription medication oxycodone,
without a prescription, a few times between May 2005 and May 2014. (SOR ¶ 1.c) (Tr.
52-54,  66-67)  Applicant  disclosed  his  use  of  these  substances  on  his  SCA,  and
discussed his use in his background interview. (GE 1; GE 2) Applicant testified that if he
were offered such substances again, he would not accept them.
Applicant also disclosed on his SCA that he used poppy tea, from January 2007
to May 2013, about 50 times. (GE 1)(SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant’s practice was to  purchase
the  poppy  seeds  legally  from  a  flower  store,  and  then  grind  the  seeds  up  and  steep
them in tea. The physiological effect upon consuming the tea was like a sedative or an
opiate. (Tr. 54-55, 68-69)
In mitigation, Applicant testified that he is older and now has a family, as well as
a job he enjoys. He recognizes that holding a clearance is important to him. His current
circumstances are “incompatible with any drug use.” He said his desire to use marijuana
has disappeared. He has found the effects of the drug to be physically taxing, and  “not
compatible with [the] responsibilities I have as a parent or as an employee.” (Tr. 43-44,
69-70) He cited having children as the biggest change in his lifestyle. (Tr. 77-78)
Applicant  testified  that  he  no  longer  attends  parties  or  associates  with  people
who use marijuana. His last use, in December 2017, was with a friend who now lives in
another  part of  the  state.  They  are  no  longer  in  regular  contact.  Applicant’s  wife  does
not  use  marijuana,  though  she  did  rarely  use  it  in  the  past.  (Tr.  48-49,  65,  75-77)
Applicant  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  a  substance  abuse  disorder.  He  has  never
participated in drug treatment or counseling. (Tr. 80-81)
Applicant provided a statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and
substance  misuse.  He  acknowledged  that  any  future  such  involvement  would  be
grounds  for  revocation  of  his  national  security  eligibility.  (AE  A)  He  intends  to  abstain
from illegal drugs entirely. (Tr. 87)
Applicant’s  supervisor  wrote  a  cover  letter  to  convey  his  “absolute  trust”  in
Applicant’s  character  and  judgment.  He  has  known  Applicant  for  many  years.  He
regards Applicant as trustworthy and reliable, and an excellent performer and a leader
at work. Applicant is responsible and credible, and is well qualified to hold a clearance.

"Applicant, age 62, has been married to his second wife since 1991. He has one
minor child and four adult children. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1979, a master’s
degree in 1982, and a doctorate degree in 1986. He has been employed by a defense
contractor as a chief scientist since March 2016. (Item 2)
Applicant  was  previously  granted  a  DOD  security  clearance  in  1987,  when  he
worked as a civilian employee of the U.S. military. He maintained that clearance until he
separated  from  that  employment  in  1988.  He  submitted  a  SCA  in  December  2016,
sponsored by his current employer. The DOD CAF granted Applicant an interim security
clearance in April 2017, pending its adjudication of the matter. That interim clearance was
suspended in November 2019, on the same day the SOR was issued, because the DOD
CAF  was  unable  to  find  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant
Applicant’s  security  clearance  and  recommended  that  the  matter  be  submitted  to  an
administrative judge for final adjudication. (Item 2 at 51; Item 4)
The  SOR  alleged  Guideline  H  concerns  involving  Applicant’s  use  of  marijuana,
including while he was in possession of the interim clearance granted in April 2017. It also
alleged  Guideline  E  concerns  involving  Applicant’s  deliberate  failure  to  disclose  his
marijuana use on his 2016 SCA and during a 2018 security clearance interview. Applicant
admitted  three  of  the  four  Guideline  H  allegations  and  denied  both  Guideline  E
allegations. (Item 1)
Applicant  began  using  marijuana  in  1973  when  he  was  in  high  school.  He
continued to use it until he was granted a security clearance in 1987. He resumed using
marijuana in 1988 once he separated from the employment that required him to maintain
that clearance. He continued to use it until February 2019. (Item 1; Item 3 at 4-8)
Applicant asserted that he stopped using marijuana in February 2019 because he
applied for a security clearance. He understands that marijuana use is incompatible with
maintaining  a  security  clearance.  He  denied  using  marijuana  at  any  time  that  he
“knowingly” possessed a security clearance. He maintained that he has neither held an
active  security  clearance  nor  been  in  a  position  where  his  “participation  required  any
clearance” since 1988. Although he admitted that he “may” have used marijuana while
his interim clearance was active, he could not recall any specific occurrence. He claimed
that  he  did  not  know  that  he  had  been  granted  an  interim  clearance  because  he  was
never  formally  advised  of  such. However,  he  acknowledged  that  his  supervisor  “once”
informally advised him in an “off-hand telephone comment” that an interim clearance had
been conveyed to him. The timing of that phone call was not specified in the record. (Item
1; Item 3 at 4-8; FORM response)
On  his  December  2016  SCA,  Applicant  answered  “No”  to  each  question  about
illegal drug use, and did not otherwise report any illegal drug use therein. He certified that
the  statements  made  in  his  SCA  were  “true,  complete,  and  correct  to  the  best  of  [his]
knowledge  and  belief  and  [were]  made  in  good  faith.”  He  was  interviewed  twice  in
connection  with  his  SCA  –  in  October  2018  and  February  2019.  The  investigator  who
interviewed him summarized the statements that Applicant made during those interviews.
In September 2019, Applicant affirmed the accuracy of the facts about his marijuana use
in those summaries. (Items 2, 3)
During  the  first  interview,  Applicant  volunteered  that  he  had  unsuccessfully
attempted to grow three marijuana plants in his home in March 2017. He stated that this
activity was legal in his home state. He advised that he did not intend to grow marijuana
in  the  future.  During  the  interview,  he  neither  admitted  to  nor  disclosed  any  marijuana
use. (Item 2 at 49-50; Item 3 at 14)
During  the  second  interview,  Applicant  admitted  to  using  marijuana  from  1973
through February 2019 (one week prior to the second interview). He maintained that he
had never used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. He claimed that he did
not list his marijuana use on his SCA “due to his mistake.” There was no explanation as
to why he did not disclose his marijuana use during the first interview. He revealed that
his wife uses marijuana. He admitted his intent to use marijuana in the future because it
is “enjoyable,” but maintained that he would never use it while he was in possession of a
security  clearance.  During  the  interview,  he  acknowledged  that  marijuana  use  was
considered illegal under federal laws. (Item 3 at 18-19)
At  various  times  during  the  security  clearance  investigative  process,  Applicant
proffered inconsistent statements about the frequency of his marijuana use. During the
second interview, he stated that he used marijuana at home “about one time per week.”
In his SOR answer, he stated that he used it “not more than one to two times per month”
from 1973 through 1987, and “not more than one to three times a year” from 1988 through
2019. In his FORM response, he denied that he ever used marijuana once a week and
asserted  that  any  statement  he  made  to  the  contrary  resulted  from  him  inaccurately
estimating his use due to the vagueness of the questions he was asked. He averred that
between 1973 and February 2019, he used marijuana “less than once every two months.”
He acknowledged that his marijuana use was most frequent during his college years, but
asserted that he has “seldom” used it in the years since 1988, to the point where he was
“hard-pressed” to recall any specific instances. He also maintained that there have been
“decades” between 1973 and 2019 when he “neither encountered nor used marijuana.”
(Item 1; Item 3 at 18; FORM response)
Applicant readdressed his intent to use marijuana in the future in both his  SOR
answer and FORM response. In his SOR answer, he stated the following: “I have stated
neither the intent nor the preclusion. I do not intend, though it may occur. It certainly will
not occur if I am carrying a clearance.” In his FORM response, he denied expressing any
intent to use marijuana in the future. He acknowledged: “I may use marijuana in the future,
just as I may eat catfish, sometime in the future,” which he argued does not constitute an
intent to use marijuana in the future.
In his SOR answer, with respect to why he failed to report his marijuana use on his
SCA, Applicant asserted: “Because private marijuana use was legalized [in the state in
which he resided] in December 2016, I believed my response to the question was correct,
and  not  ‘falsified.’  Furthermore,  I  cannot  identify  a  specific  date  or  event  in  the  seven
years prior to [the date that he certified his SCA] that I used an illegal drug or controlled
substance.” He denied that he lied during his first interview. He asserted: “I have been
honest  in  my  written  statements,  and  I  have  been  honest  and  transparent  with  the
investigator. The admission that I planted three seeds illustrates that fact.”
At the conclusion of his SOR answer, he stated the following:
I am disappointed and humbled that my access to classified information has
not been found to be consistent with the national interest. I believe that my
10  years  of  service  to  the  federal  government  strongly  demonstrates  the
converse. Nevertheless I accept the finding, but wish the associated record
to be accurate. Were I granted a clearance, there would be no marijuana
use.

"In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  the  Guideline  H  allegations,  with  some
explanation.  I  adopt  his  admissions  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  35  years  old.  He  is  single  and  has  no  children.  He  has  been  in  a
relationship with his girlfriend for approximately five years. They bought a home and car
together  and  reside  together.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor, as a systems analyst since January 2011. He holds a bachelor’s degree. He
has  held  a  security  clearance  since  2008,  when  he  was  affiliated  with  the  U.S.  Navy.
(Tr. at 28-30, 34-36; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from  about
2012 to at least January 2019, while being granted access to classified information; and
that he intended to use marijuana in the future.
Applicant described his marijuana use as beginning in approximately 2010 when
he  smoked  it  in  a  jurisdiction  where  it  was  illegal.  He  lives  in  a  jurisdiction  which  has
made  marijuana  use  legal.  He  continued  to  use  marijuana  through  approximately
January 2019, after he completed his most recent security clearance application (SCA).
Before 2012, he used marijuana more than twice a week. From 2012 until his claimed
abstinence in January 2019, he used marijuana about two times a week. He generally
acquired  the  marijuana  through  friends  either  by  purchase  or  gift.  He  typically  used
marijuana  in  his  home  with  his  girlfriend,  or  with  his  friends,  some  of  which  are  his
neighbors, at their homes. (Tr. at 38-42, 45-47; AE A)
Applicant  was  aware  that  his  company  had  a  drug  policy,  but  he  did  not  know
what the policy was. His supervisor testified that the company policy is that drug use is
prohibited by all employees. She also stated that all employees are made aware of the
drug policy. The company does not require drug-testing. Applicant stated in his SCA, his
January 2019 background investigation interview, and his SOR answer that he intended
to continue to use marijuana, unless it affected his security clearance. He is aware that
marijuana use is incompatible with holding a security clearance. He testified that he now
understands that drug use is a significant issue with the DOD and stated that he does
not intend to use in the future. He did not provide a written statement  confirming such
intent.  He  did  not  provide  any  documented  drug  counseling  or  treatment  records.  He
provided a drug test result from December 31, 2019, which showed a negative result for
the presence of marijuana.  His girlfriend continues to use marijuana at least two times
weekly. He claims she leaves the house to use marijuana so that he is not around when
she uses marijuana. He still associates with friends, including neighbors, who continue
to use marijuana. (Tr. at 42-43, 48-53, 57-58; AE D)
Applicant’s direct supervisor testified and provided a written letter supporting him.
Another  coworker  also  provided  a  letter  of  support.  Both  opine  that  Applicant  is
trustworthy and reliable. Applicant also provided a letter from a community member who
related Applicant’s volunteer work for his community. The author described Applicant as
“a kind, responsible person.” (Tr. 56-58; AE A-C)

Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 1996 and a doctorate degree in 2010. As
of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  worked  as  a  lead  scientist  for  his  employer,  a  DOD
contractor, since September 2018. He has never held a security clearance. (Answer; Tr.

Applicant used marijuana from approximately  1991 to March 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a).
He purchased marijuana for personal use from friends and his brother between 1991 and
2012. After marijuana was legalized in his home state in 2012, he purchased ingestible
marijuana  from  state  dispensaries  between  2014  and  2018.  He  disclosed  his  use  and
purchase  of  marijuana  on  his  2018  SCA.  He  has  always  known  that  marijuana  use  is
illegal.  He  first  used  marijuana  during  his  first  year  of  college  in  1991.  He  used  it
recreationally and approximately once a week throughout college. His marijuana use was
primarily  with  college friends, but  he acknowledged  that  he used  it  alone on  occasion.
(Answer; Tr. at 26-84; GE 1)
Applicant continued to use marijuana after graduating from college while working
in the private sector. He underwent and passed pre-employment drug testing with various
employers, but he was not subsequently subject to drug testing. He was unaware  that
any  of  his  employers  prohibited  illegal  drug  use.  He  did  not  use  marijuana  at  work  or
report  to  work  under  the  influence  of  marijuana.  He  used  it  recreationally  and
approximately twice monthly from around 1996 to 2000. He then used it approximately
once every three weeks from around 2000 to 2003, and then once monthly from around
2003 to February 2018. He used marijuana to relax, primarily when he was alone at home
and during the weekends. He stated that it was “my equivalent of having a glass of wine
after a long day or a long couple of weeks.” He used marijuana with his brother, his wife’s
cousin, and friends; and he used marijuana with his spouse once, in around 2002. His
marijuana use did not adversely affect his job performance and he was favorable rated
by his employers during this period. (Answer; Tr. at 26-94; GE 1)
Applicant abstained from marijuana use four times: (1) in 2006 for three months;
(2) from 2008 to 2009; (3) from 2010 to early 2012; and (4) from 2014 to 2015. The first
two  periods  of  abstention  occurred  during  two  major  examinations  for  his  doctoral
program;  the  third  occurred  during  the  year  that  he  worked  overseas,  where  the
consequences of illegal drug use were severe, and for five months after his return to the
United States; and the fourth occurred because he had no need to use it. (Answer; Tr. at
26-94; GE 1)
Applicant  decided  to  permanently  stop  using  marijuana  in  March  2018.  The
impetus for his decision was his recruitment by his current employer. He testified:
[My employer] described the position to me and we had a very frank and
open  discussion  about  my  marijuana  use  and  my  history.  The  exact
conversation we’ve had here, I had with [my employer]. And [my employer]
made it very clear to me that marijuana use was strictly prohibited and was
not  conducive  with  the  position  that  I  was  looking  at  taking.  And  I
immediately  stopped.  I  realized  that  this  position  was  the  --  so  at  first,  I
hadn’t  really  looked  very  closely  at  positions  in  government,  advising  the
government on tactical matters. That was not a job that I had really looked
at  closely.  I  was  approached  by  [my  employer].  We  had  this  frank
discussion. I went out through my network and spoke with other people that
had similar positions, and I became very attracted to the idea of coming out
here. So I immediately stopped my marijuana use and signed an agreement
with [my employer] . . . .

Applicant  testified  that  it  was  not  difficult  for  him  to  decide  to  never  again  use
marijuana, and he would leave if he were to find himself in a situation where illegal drugs
were  being  used.  He  adopted  a  new  and  active  lifestyle  in  2018.  An  August  2019
evaluation by a licensed clinical social worker determined that Applicant did not have a
substance use disorder. He also signed a letter of intent to not use illegal drugs or misuse
legal  drugs  in  the  future  in  August  2019.  He  declared  such  an  intention  despite  his
employer’s lack of a drug testing program. His spouse was aware of and supported his
commitment to abstain from marijuana use. He disassociated from most of the individuals
with whom he previously used marijuana, except for his brother, his wife’s cousin, and his
two friends. He notified these four individuals in March 2018 about his decision to abstain
from marijuana and his intent to disassociate from anyone who used it in his presence,
and they were supportive of his decision. (Answer; Tr. at 18-94; AE I, J, K, L)
The two founding partners of the company for whom Applicant worked testified.
Both  were  aware  of  Applicant’s  illegal  drug  use  and  were  confident  in  his  decision  to
abstain  from  such  use.  They  described  Applicant  as  an  outstanding  employee  and  a
trustworthy, honest, and reliable individual. Several former co-workers who were aware
of  Applicant’s  marijuana  use  also  attested  to  Applicant’s  reliability,  honesty,  and
trustworthiness.  His  performance  for  the  period  of  September  to  December  2018  was
rated favorably by his employer. His previous employer also rated him favorably for the
years in which he worked there, from 2011 to 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 94-122; AE I, J, K, L)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations in whole or in
part. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are
accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 28-year-old analyst employed by a federal government  contractor
for the previous three years. (Tr. 16; GE 1; AE A; AE F) In 2011, he received a high school

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying degrees of frequency
from about June 2011 to about July 2014. Applicant said he used marijuana on about five
to ten occasions during this time period. (Tr. 25-26; AE F at 1) In his September 11, 2014
SCA Applicant disclosed his marijuana use; he said he used marijuana less than 10 times;
and he said he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 26; GE 3) In Applicant’s
February 11, 2015, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview
(PSI), he said he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 27)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant used marijuana in December 2016, while granted
access to classified information. On New Year’s Eve in 2016, Applicant was intoxicated
by alcohol consumption, and he took two puffs on a marijuana cigarette. (AE D) He held
a security clearance; however,  at that time he did not have actual access to classified
information. (Tr. 26-27; AE D)
In his October 18, 2017 SCA Applicant disclosed his marijuana use in 2016, and
he said he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 27-28; GE 1) He explained,
“I would like  to  not compromise my clearance.” (GE 1) His follow-up OPM PSI was on
August 5, 2019. (GE 2)
SOR  ¶¶   1.c  and   1.d   allege   that  Applicant   used   marijuana   in  April  2018,   after
completing   his  SCA  on   October  18,  2017,  and   while   granted   access  to   classified
information.  On April 20, 2018, Applicant was intoxicated  from alcohol consumption. (AE
D)   He  was  with   his friends  when   he   consumed  a   cookie  containing   marijuana.  (AE   D)
Applicant  admitted   he   used   marijuana   on   April  20,   2018   at   a   small   gathering   for   the
unofficial  National  Marijuana   Holiday.  (Tr.  28-31)   He  admitted   he   held  a   security
clearance when he used  marijuana. (AE D)
Applicant said that after his marijuana use in April 2018, he improved his ability to
manage stress. (Tr. 18) He was intoxicated and under stress the two most recent times
he used marijuana. (Tr. 18) He started an exercise program one to three days a week to
manage stress, and he has “strictly limited contact with [his] family” which is usually the
source of his stress. (Tr. 19) He has not consumed alcohol in months. (Tr. 32) On October
4, 2019, and July 10, 2020, Applicant provided a hair sample, which tested negative for
the presence of a panel of illegal drugs, including marijuana. (AE F; AE G)
On  October  18,  2019,  a  substance-abuse  therapist  assessed  Applicant’s
propensity for future illegal drug use, and she  concluded he was at a  “very  low risk”  to
abuse illegal drugs because of his “history of sporadic, recreational use and the gravity
of the consequences of his use outweighing its value to the client. The detrimental impact
on his security clearance and the risk of losing his job far exceed [marijuana’s] usefulness
to [Applicant].” (Tr. 19; AE D at 2; AE F at 1, 4) Applicant does not associate with anyone
involved in the 2016 marijuana use. (Tr. 20) He ended his association “with the majority
of people” who used marijuana with him in the past. (Tr. 20)
Applicant  received  counseling about  how to abstain from  illegal drug use  in  the
future,  and  he  promised  not  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  (Tr.  20-21)  He  provided  a
signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse,
acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national
security eligibility. (Tr. 20-21; AE F; see AG ¶ 26(b)(3)) He promised not to use marijuana
in  the  future  because  he  has  a  better  understanding  on  the  adverse  effect  of  using
marijuana on his access to classified information. (Tr. 33)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant showed poor judgment when he engaged in the
conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.d. Appellant was honest about his marijuana
use on his September 11, 2014, and October 18, 2017, SCAs and in the follow-up OPM
PSIs. He advised his employer of his marijuana use. (AE D)
Character Evidence
Five  roommates,  friends,  and/or  coworkers  provided  character  statements
supporting reinstatement or continuation of  Applicant’s access to classified information.
(AE E) The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is friendly, conscientious,
honest,  reliable,  professional,  stable,  calm, empathetic,  and  trustworthy.  He  consumes
alcohol in moderation (one or two drinks). His character witnesses are familiar with his
marijuana  use  as  indicated  in  the  SOR.  None  of  his  character  statements  said  they
observed him using illegal drugs.
There  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  received  any  adverse  employment  actions,
violated security rules, or otherwise compromised national security. Appellant described
himself as being passionate about the protection of national security, and he indicated he
is  an  excellent  analyst  who  can  contribute  to  national  defense.  (Tr.  21)  A  security
clearance  will  enable  him  to  make  greater  contributions  to  national  security  and  the
protection of the United States. (Tr. 21)

"Applicant is a 43-year-old, married woman with two children, ages six and four.  She
earned an associate’s degree in 1998 and a bachelor’s degree in 2003. Since 2017, she
has been working for a defense contractor. (Tr. 17)
Applicant is highly respected on the job. Her current supervisor characterized her as
extremely trustworthy and honest. (AE C at 1) A previous supervisor characterized her as
“hardworking, flexible, and adaptive.” (AE B at 3) In 2019, she received a certificate for
exceptional performance. (AE G) Applicant is active in her community, volunteering for an
organization that helps disabled people. (AE C)
Applicant used cocaine approximately three to four times while in college. (Tr.19; GE
D at 2) She stopped using cocaine during her senior year in 2003. After graduating from
college, she returned home and reconnected with some high school friends. She resumed
her  cocaine  use  while  socializing  with  them,  using  approximately  two  or  three  times
between  2003  and  2008.  (Answer  at  3;  Tr.  22)  One  of  her  episodes  of  cocaine  use
occurred  after  she  had  been  granted  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  45)  She  has  not  used
cocaine since 2008.
Applicant no longer socializes with the people with whom she used cocaine after
graduating from college. (Tr. 26) She is the primary income earner in her family and is
dedicated  to  living  a  responsible,  healthy  lifestyle,  and  setting  a  good  example  for  her
children.  (Tr.  32;  AE  D  at  2)  On  October  24,  2019,  Applicant  executed  an  affidavit
memorializing her intention not to resume cocaine use in the future. (AE F)
On  October  28,  2019,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  certified  substance  abuse
counselor. (AE D) The counselor characterized Applicant’s cocaine use as “short-term” and
“non-patterned,”  falling  well  below  the  threshold  for  misuse  or  abuse.  (AE  D  at  3-4)
Considering the sporadic nature of the cocaine use and length of time that has elapsed
since  Applicant  last  used  cocaine,  the  counselor  concluded  that  it  no  longer  posed  a
potential security concern. (AE D at 5-6)
Applicant  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  her  cocaine  use  when  disclosure  was
required  on  a  security  clearance  application  completed  in  2004.  She  omitted  this
information because she “was just too ashamed to admit that [she] had ever done anything
like that.” (Tr. 27)
In 2016, Applicant completed another security clearance application. She “doubled
down” and again deliberately omitted her past cocaine use. (Tr. 27) When she completed
the application, she was eight months pregnant, and did not want “to let [her] family down.”
Applicant  was  haunted  by  her  falsifications.  This  prompted  her  to  disclose  them  on  a
security clearance application completed in 2018. (GE 1 at 33)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with
explanations.  I  have  incorporated  those  admissions  into  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  29  years  old.  He  is  married  with  two  children.  He  has  a  bachelor’s
degree. He is an engineer. He has worked for a defense contractor since October 2018.
He has never held a security clearance. He completed his security clearance application
(SCA) in September 2018. (Tr. 6, 17; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant:  used  and  purchased  marijuana,  with  varying
frequency,  from  October  2007  to  April  2018;  used  hallucinogenic  (not  alleged,  but
implied) mushrooms on two occasions in or around April 2012 and November 2017; and
stated to a defense investigator during his background interview that if he were offered
marijuana in the future, he might use it. (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.c.)
Applicant  disclosed  the  full  scope  of  his  illicit  drug  use  when  he  completed  his
September 2018 SCA. His marijuana use started while in high school in about 2008. He
used marijuana approximately twice then. His marijuana use continued into his college
years  where  he  used  it  approximately  two  to  three  times  a  week.  The  marijuana  was
either  provided  by  a  roommate  or  Applicant  purchased  it  himself.  He  stopped  using
marijuana  in  2014  because  he  applied  for  a  position  which  required  pre-employment
drug  testing.  He  was  hired  for  the  position.  He  was  aware  that  his  new  employer
maintained  a  zero-tolerance  drug  policy.  He  abstained  from  marijuana  use  for  about
four  months,  then  began  using  it  recreationally  again  about  once  to  twice  a  year.  His
last  use  of  marijuana  was  in  April  2018,  before  he  began  his  current  position.  He
experimented by using hallucinogenic mushrooms on two occasions in 2012 and 2017.
He has not used them since that time. He met his wife while they both attended college.
She used marijuana at that time, but she no longer uses it. (Tr. 18-23; GE 1-2; AE A)
Applicant credibly testified that he stopped using all illegal controlled substances
because  of  his  current  employment  position  and  the  realization  that  his  past  use  was
foolish and  irresponsible.  He  no  longer  associates  with his  friends who continue using
marijuana. He passed his employer’s drug-screening test. He has no future intent to use
illegal  drugs  and  documented  such  intent  in  a  written  statement.  He  also  clarified  his
previous  statement  to  a  defense  investigator  where  he  indicated  he  might  use  illegal
drugs in the future. He just meant that if marijuana was legalized under federal law and
if its use was not prohibited under security clearance regulations, he might then use it in
the future. He further acknowledged that those conditions do not currently exist and he
has  no  intention  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  has  not  participated  in  any  drug
counseling or treatment programs. (Tr. 23-24, 26, 29; GE 2; AE A-B)

Applicant as a trustworthy employee and highly dependable. He recommends granting
Applicant’s security clearance. (AE C)

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  28  years  old.  He  is  not  married  and  has  no  children.  He  attended
college, but did not earn a degree. He later earned a technical certificate. Applicant has
worked with his current employer, a federal contractor, since August 2017. (Item 3)
In  November  2011,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana, first offense in State A. This charge was dismissed following completion of a
drug education class, mandatory drug testing, and a probationary period. (Items 2, 3, 4,
5, 6)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  September  2018  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana,  a  first  offense  misdemeanor  in  State  B.  Applicant  disputed  the  September
2018 date and said it occurred in October 2018. Court documents confirm the September
2018  date.  His  charge  was  deferred,  pending  the  completion  of  a  drug-screen
assessment to determine if he needed drug counseling and the completion of three drug
tests a month apart. He was also required to complete 100 hours of community service.
He began drug testing in January 2019, completed the terms of the deferment in June
2019, and the charge was dismissed. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on  December  20,
2018. In it, he disclosed that he used marijuana once every few days from August 2010
until October 2018, the month he said he was arrested for marijuana possession. He also
disclosed that he intended to continue using marijuana as a sleep aid and because it was
legal in the jurisdiction where he lived. (Item 3)
In March 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. During
his interview, he told the investigator that he intends to continue to use marijuana when
he goes out, but had not used it since January 2019, because, at that time, he had to
pass the three drug tests that were part of the diversion program for his 2018 marijuana
possession  arrest.  He  stated  he  would  probably  use  marijuana  after  his  probationary
period ends in June 2019, but could stop if he needed to. He stated that his family and
friends use marijuana. He said that his marijuana use has decreased over the years, and
he probably only used it three or four times during the past year. Applicant stated that he
usually  obtains  marijuana  from  individuals  in  social  settings,  typically  from  a  friend  or
cousin. (Item 6)
Applicant  answered  government  interrogatories  on  September  12,  2019.  He
disclosed  that  his  last  marijuana  use  was  December  12,  2018.  He  was  “gifted”  the
marijuana from his cousin. He indicated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future.

"Applicant  admitted  the  sole  SOR  allegation  - that  he  illegally  used  marijuana
between  February  2015  and  March  2017,  while  possessing  access  to  classified
information.  (¶  1.a)  His  SOR  admission  and  those  at  his  hearing  are  incorporated  as
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He attended college
between  September  2000  and  April  2002,  but  did  not  complete  a  degree.  He  then
attended  a  trade-technical  school  (apprenticeship)  between  August  2003  and  January
2007,  and  qualified  as  a  journeyman  electrician.  He  married  in  May  2009,  and  has  a
daughter,  age  9  and  a  son,  age  7.  Applicant  has  been  working  for  federal  contractors
since about 2004, and has possessed a security clearance since at least 2007. He has
been working for his current employer and clearance sponsor since January 2007.
Applicant submitted his most recent SCA on August 3, 2017. In his responses to
Question 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed
that  he  illegally  used  marijuana  between  February  2015  and  March  2017.  He  also
disclosed that he purchased marijuana twice, once in July 2016, and once in December
2016. Applicant described his marijuana use and purchases as recreational. At the time
he  used  and  purchased  the  marijuana,  Applicant  possessed  a  security  clearance.  He
indicated that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because it was “not worth
being in trouble/illegal and family more important.” (GE 1)
On June 20, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a background investigator from
the  Office  of  Personal  Management  (OPM).  He  confirmed  to  the  interviewer  his  illegal
use  and  purchases  of  marijuana  between  February  2015  and  March  2017,  while
possessing a clearance. He told the investigator that he smoked marijuana two to three
times per month by himself. He stated that he did not use marijuana with anyone else
and that he purchased the marijuana through random people (unknown names). (GE 2)
At  hearing,  Applicant  described  his  marijuana  use  as  a  mistake  - he  was  going
through a phase - and now hopes that his mistake will not be taken against him. When
asked how he obtained the marijuana, Applicant explained that between February 2015
(when  he  claimed  he  started  using  marijuana)  and  July  2016  (when  he  claimed  he
purchased marijuana for the first time) he “bought the marijuana through the friend of a
friend.” (Tr. 18)
When confronted with the discrepancy about how he acquired the marijuana, that
he was using before he started purchasing it, Applicant testified:
A: I apologize. I don't want to get anybody else in trouble. I did use
marijuana with a friend of mine. We both played guitar, I did do that a few
times, and that was it. So I was able to get it through him.
Q:
Okay.  So you used it with your friend?
A:
A couple of times, yes, when we worked together.
Q:
All right, but most of the time you were alone?
A:
Most of the time I was alone. (Tr. 18)
When asked to  explain what  he  meant  by “going through a phase”  and  why  he
suddenly  started  to  use  marijuana  in  February  2015,  after  claiming  he  never  used  it
before, Applicant testified:
When I was introduced to it, I do play guitar and it enhanced the effect of
me  playing  the  guitar.  So  just  like  any  drug,  I  guess  once  you  try
something  you  can  sort  of  become  addicted  to  it.  Can  I  guess  become
addicted to it. So I did use it to enhance  the  effects  of  me  playing  the
guitar or the piano anything like that. (Tr. 20)
Applicant  further  explained  that  he  used  to  play  in  a  band.  And,  they  went  to
shows  and  made  money  playing  as  a  side-business.  Because  Applicant  now  has
children, playing is more of a hobby for him. (Tr. 20) He used to smoke marijuana in his
home and at his parent’s home.
Applicant acknowledged that he has possessed a clearance since at least 2007,
and  that  he  was  aware  that  the  Government  has  a  policy  against  people  holding  a
clearance  and  using  illegal  drugs.  He  testified  that  he  stopped  smoking  marijuana  in
March 2017, because he knew it was wrong, and he also believed that using marijuana
was beginning to adversely affect his memory. Applicant is still in contact with the friend
with whom he shared (smoked) and provided him with marijuana. (Tr. 22) He presented
no evidence to show that he sought or received any medical or psychological treatment
or counseling for substance abuse.

"The amended SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana from
approximately  2004  to  approximately  September  2019,  including  after  being  granted
access to classified information in April 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that during a December 4,
2018  interview  with  an  authorized  investigator  for  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD),
Applicant expressed his intent to continue to use marijuana, despite knowing it is illegal
under  federal  law  and  prohibited  by  his  employer  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  Under  Guideline  E,
Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his February 12, 2018 e-QIP by denying
that he had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years, and
by  denying  that  he  had  ever  illegally  used  or  been  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled
substance while possessing a security clearance (SOR ¶ 2.a). Additionally under Guideline
E, Applicant is alleged to have also falsified his February 15, 2008 e-QIP by denying any
illegal drug use in the last seven years (SOR ¶ 2.b). Applicant answered the SOR before
the amendment to correct the date of the e-QIP in SOR ¶ 2.b from February 15, 2018, to
February  15,  2008.  He  admitted  the  allegations  without  comment.  (Answer.)  After
considering the pleading, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 36 years old and unmarried. Shortly after graduating from high school he
took a three-month class in web design. He was employed outside the defense industry as
a machinist from August 2003 until February 2008, when he began working for his defense-
contractor employer as an assembler. (GEs 1-2.)
On  February  15,  2008,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) incorporated within an e-QIP. He
responded negatively to an inquiry concerning any illegal use of a controlled substance,
including marijuana, within the preceding seven years. (GE 1.)  He disclosed no issues of
potential security concern and was granted a DOD secret clearance in approximately April
2008. (Answer; GE 2.)
Applicant  began  using  marijuana  in  2004.  He  passed  a  pre-employment  drug
screen, and abstained from using marijuana for about seven to eight months after he was
hired by his current employer because he knew marijuana was illegal both under federal
and  his  state’s  laws  (Tr.  43),  and  he  should  not  use  it.  He  resumed  using  marijuana
recreationally, despite holding a DOD secret clearance. (GEs 1-3.)
On February 12, 2018, Applicant completed an e-QIP for a periodic reinvestigation
for his security clearance eligibility. He responded negatively to SF 86 inquiries concerning
whether he had illegally used any drug or controlled substance in the last seven years, and
whether  he  had  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been  illegally  involved  with  a  drug  or
controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. (GE 2.)
On December 4, 2018, Applicant was interviewed for his background reinvestigation
by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked
if  he  had  ever  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances,  Applicant  initially
responded negatively before admitting that he had smoked marijuana by choice on and off
since  the  age  of  18  with  family  and  friends.  He  described  the  current  frequency of  his
marijuana use as a couple of times per week “in a responsible manner” because he enjoys
it. He denied ever being impaired by marijuana while driving or working. He expressed no
plan to cease his marijuana use, while asserting that he would be able to stop, adding that
he  would  do  what  he  needed  to  do  to  pass  a  drug  test,  but  then  would  resume  using
marijuana.  He  had  never  failed  a  drug  screen  and  had  never  had  any  counseling  or
treatment for his drug use. Applicant admitted that he purchased his marijuana from a
friend, spending up to $100 or $200 per month on occasion. Applicant initially explained
that he had not disclosed his marijuana use on his security clearance application because
he knew that marijuana use is illegal under federal law. After the state in which he works
but not resides decriminalized recreational use of marijuana, his employer posted on its
website  that  marijuana  remains  illegal  under  federal  law.  When  asked  whether  he
intentionally  concealed  his  drug  use,  Applicant  responded  that  he  would  not  say  that.
However,  he  later  acknowledged  that  he  did  not  disclose  his  drug  involvement  on  his
clearance application because of fear of losing his job and being regarded as a criminal or
as someone who is always high. (GE 3.)
At  DOHA’s  request,  Applicant  reviewed  a  copy  of  the  summary  report  of  his
interview with the OPM investigator. On September 18, 2019, Applicant attested that the
summary was accurate, but he also stated:
Re-evaluated from previous answer. I would stop and not start again. My job
is more important. Usage has also changed primarily too [sic] a sleep aid at
this point. Usage around others even less than before. Quantity consumed
down greatly. (GE 3.)
In response to an interrogatory asking him to report his drug use, Applicant indicated
that  he  used  marijuana  between  2004  and  September  5,  2019.  As  to  its  frequency,
Applicant responded that he previously used marijuana several times a week, but “stopped
on reception of this.” He denied any intention to use marijuana in the future. (GE 3.)
At his March 2020 hearing, Applicant admitted that he had intentionally failed to
disclose his marijuana use when he completed his February 2008 e-QIP because he knew
of several people who had passed drug screens for employment with his employer but then
were not hired for failure to receive a clearance because of self-reported cannabis use.  (Tr.
17-18, 36.) Applicant also admitted that he had falsified his February 2018 e-QIP because
he wanted to retain his job. (Tr. 36.) Applicant expressed regret for failing to disclose his
drug use, adding that the possibility of him having to answer for it has been at the back of
his  mind  for  the  past  12  years  of  his  employment.  Applicant  testified  that  he  made  a
“conscious effort to disclose” his marijuana use during his December 2018 personal subject
interview because he never wanted to hide the information. He felt guilty about hiding it and
wanted to “remedy that and not hide something that [he] should never have hidden to begin
with.” Applicant expressed his agreement with those states in the United States who have
legalized  or  decriminalized  some  form  of  marijuana  use,  and  described  the  federal
government’s prohibition as “a bit wonky.” Applicant acknowledged his “really poor decision
in an attempt to try and keep [his] clearance.” (Tr. 17-21.)
Applicant refrained from marijuana use for a month or two after he told DOHA in
September  2019  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  Suffering  from
insomnia  to  where  his  lack  of  sleep  and  exhaustion  was  beginning  to  affect  his  job
performance, Applicant resumed using marijuana as a sleep-aid. He smoked “joints” or
through a pipe, and purchased his marijuana from the same friend who has supplied him
for the last 10 to 12 years. (Tr. 40-41.) Applicant tried a couple of different drugs, including
Ambien and melatonin, four to six years ago, but cannabis relaxed his mind without the
negative effects he felt from other drugs. (Tr. 25-28.) Applicant used marijuana as a sleep
aid when needed, sometimes two or three times a week. (Tr. 29.) He used marijuana as a
sleep aid as recently as March 2, 2020. (Tr. 24.) He used marijuana recreationally with his
girlfriend within a few weeks of March 2020. Applicant described his recreational use as
“pretty minimal at this point,” and limited to his girlfriend’s apartment.  He testified that he
“never touches the stuff” before work or driving a vehicle. Half of his job is spent on lifts and
using a crane, so he has to ensure that he can operate safely. (Tr. 31-32.) Applicant now
maintains that he would be willing to cease using marijuana to keep his clearance so that
he can retain his job. He testified it would make things difficult for him as far as his sleep
issues, but he is willing to go back to doctors or try additional homeopathic remedies. (Tr.
37-38.)
Applicant likes his job and states that he has excelled at every task. (Tr. 36-37.) He
worked his way up to the top of the labor grade in his union before recently being laid off
from that position and returned to his previous job in the middle of the labor grades. (Tr. 18-
19, 22.) His current job as an assembler requires clearance eligibility at the secret level.
(Tr. 22.) Applicant understands that should he lose his clearance, he could possible be
transferred to another department where a clearance is not required. He enjoys his present
work and would like to stay in his department. (Tr. 23.)

"The SOR alleged that between October 2017 and at least April  2019, Applicant
used CBD with varying frequency (SOR 1.a); that he purchased and used marijuana in
October 2017 (SOR 1.b); and that he illegally purchased and used both substances while
holding a security clearance (SOR 1.c). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all
three SOR allegations. He also stated that he chose to use CBD and marijuana as natural
alternatives to chemical medications prescribed by his doctors. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In
addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked as a technical support specialist since October 2008. He served on active duty in
the United States Air Force from May 2005 until he was honorably discharged for medical
reasons in November 2007. Applicant first received a security clearance when he entered
on active duty in the Air Force. Since  October 2011, he has held an industrial security
clearance as part of his current defense contractor employment, and he is now applying
to renew his clearance eligibility. (FORM, Items 3 and 5)
Applicant was born and raised in State A. After leaving the military, he returned to
live  and  work  there  in  July  2008.  He  has  been  married  since  April  2018.  A  previous
marriage began in April 2011 and ended by divorce in February 2018. While he and his
ex-wife  were  separated  and  going  through  his  divorce  in  2017,  Applicant  lived  with  a
girlfriend in State A, where marijuana is illegal, but CBD containing less than 0.3 percent
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the federally-controlled substance in marijuana, is legal. On
October  13,    2017,    police  responded    to    a    domestic  disturbance    at  Applicant’s  house
involving his girlfriend and his estranged wife. During that incident, police found a small
amount of  marijuana. Applicant  was  not  present  when  the police arrived,  but  when  he
arrived  at  the  house,  Applicant  told  police  the  marijuana  was  his.  He  subsequently
disclosed this incident to his facility security officer (FSO) at work and stated the drugs
actually belonged to his girlfriend, but that he had lied to the police so his girlfriend would
not get in trouble. (FORM, Items 3 –   6)
Applicant started using marijuana and CBD to relieve stress from his divorce and
to help him deal with seizures he experienced after suffering a stroke in June 2017. He
believes  the  stroke  was  brought  on  by  the  stress  of  work  and  his  pending  divorce.
Applicant started using marijuana while visiting his brother in State B, where marijuana
and CBD use are legal. He purchased the marijuana and CBD at a dispensary licensed
by State B. As part of his background  investigation,  Applicant  was interviewed  in  April
2019 by a government investigator. In discussing the October 2017 domestic incident and
his  use  of  marijuana,  Applicant  stated  that  he  would  continue  to  use  CBD  in  State  A,
where it is legal as long as it contains less than 0.3 percent THC, the active ingredient in
marijuana that makes marijuana a controlled substance. Applicant further stated his intent
to resume using marijuana in State A if that state makes it legal. (FORM, Items 3 – 6)
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  information  presented  by  the  Government  in
Items  7  –  9  to  find  that  marijuana  is  a  Schedule  I  controlled  substance,  the  use  and
possession  of  which  is  a  criminal  violation  of  federal  law.  Those  exhibits,  along  with
guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in February
2013, make clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states,
territories,  and  the  District  of  Columbia  do  not  alter  the  existing  National  Security
Adjudicative  Guidelines.  Because  federal  law  supersedes  state  laws  on  this  issue,
Applicant’s  purchase  and  use  of  marijuana,  regardless  of  location,  is  illegal.  Further,
illegal drug use is prohibited in all federal workplaces and on all military installations by
civilian federal employees and by persons employed for work on federal contracts.
Because the Government did not specifically address in the FORM the allegation
of CBD use, I note sua sponte that CBD is not uniformly regulated in the United States
and many CBD products contain more than 0.3 percent THC. Accordingly, just as with
marijuana, use of CBD is prohibited throughout the federal workplace and in the military.
The only exceptions to this ban are for rare instances involving medical prescriptions. In
his April 2019 interview, Applicant stated that he does not use products containing THC;
however, in response to the SOR and the FORM, he has not produced any information
to  show  what  he  has  been  using  does  not  contain  THC,  or  that  establishes  he  has  a
medical exemption from the DOD ban on CBD use. (FORM, Item 4)

"In her Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.f and denied
SOR ¶¶ 1.g to 1.i. I construe her lack of a specific admission or denial to SOR ¶ 2.a as
a denial. (Answer)
Applicant is 27 years old. As of her Answer, she was single and did not have any
children. She graduated from high school in June 2011 and earned a bachelor’s degree
in  May  2018.  She  has  worked  as  a  systems  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor  since
August 2018. She has never held a security clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant  recreationally  used:  (1)  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from  June
2008  to  October  2018;  (2)  ecstasy,  10  to  20  times,  from  June  2011  to  July  2018;  (3)
cocaine,  with  varying  frequency,  from  January  2014  to  July  2018;  and  (4)  LSD  in
November  2017.  She first used marijuana  in  high school,  at  age  15.  She continued  to
use marijuana in high school, from ages 15 to 18, approximately four times monthly with
friends. In college, from ages 18 to 22, she used marijuana daily to four times a week, at
parties  or  friends’  homes.  During  her  latter  years  in  college,  from  ages  22  to  25,  she
used  marijuana  between  10  to  48  times  a  year.  In  2018,  at  age  25,  she  smoked
marijuana approximately 20 times. She used marijuana in October 2018 while attending
a college homecoming game. She approximated in her August 2018 security clearance
application  (SCA)  that  she smoked marijuana “well over  1000”  times  in  total.  Between
October 2012 and July 2015, she purchased marijuana from a friend “pretty frequently,”
approximately 30 times, for her personal use. (GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s first use of ecstasy in 2011, at age 18, was at her high-school prom.
She  subsequently  used  ecstasy  during  the  weekends  from  2011  to  2018  at  friends’
homes,  music  festivals,  or  during  trips  to  state  A.  She  used  ecstasy  in  July  2018  at  a
music festival. (GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s first use of cocaine in 2014, at age 21, was with a friend at a college
party. From 2014 to 2015, she used cocaine four times monthly during the weekends at
college  parties  or  concerts.  From  2015  to  2018,  she  used  cocaine  two  to  three  times
yearly at music festivals. She used cocaine in July 2018 during a weekend trip to state
A. Between April 2016 and May 2018, she purchased cocaine twice for a music festival
and a few other times while consuming alcohol. She attributed her purchase of cocaine
to being “young and dumb.” She stated in her SCA and during her background interview
that she did not intend to use cocaine again because she did not like the next-day side
effects  and  she  did  not  want  to  risk  her  job.  Applicant’s  one-time  use  of  LSD  in  2017
was at a concert with a friend.   (GE 1, 2)
Applicant  stated  in  her  SCA  that  she  intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future
because  “[i]t’s  not  illegal  in  [state  B--the  state  in  which  her  family  resides]  and  I  enjoy
the effects of THC.” She also stated that she would “most likely use [ecstasy] again if I
go to another music festival” and she “might take LSD at a music festival.” She stated
during her January 2019 background interview, however, that she no longer wanted to
use illegal drugs. She also stated that she had no future intent to purchase marijuana or
cocaine. She stated that her motivation to stop using and purchasing illegal drugs was
her  employment.  She acknowledged  during  her  interview  that  she  still  associated  with
the individuals with whom she previously used illegal drugs. In January 2020, Applicant
signed a statement of intent to not use any illegal drugs or abuse any prescription drugs
in the future. (Answer; GE 1, 2)

"In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d,
and 1.e, and denies all remaining SOR allegations.
Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  who  seeks  a  security
clearance. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He has been employed
with  his  current employer  since March 2020.  He  has a  high school diploma and some
technical school credits. He lives with his girlfriend and has an eight-year-old daughter
from a prior relationship. He has never been married. (Tr.9; Gov 1) (Note: The facts in
this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or locations
in  order  to  protect  Applicant  and  his  family’s  privacy.  The  cited  sources  contain  more
specific information.)
Guideline H – Drug Involvement
Under the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana
with  varying  frequency  from  January  2014  to  July  2016.  (SOR  ¶  1.a:  Gov  1  at  43-44;
Gov  2  at  8)  He  is  alleged  to  have  purchased  and  distributed  marijuana  between
January 2014 and July 2018. (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 2 at 8)  It is alleged that Applicant told
the  investigator  conducting his  background  investigation that  he intends to continue to
purchase  and  distribute  marijuana.  (SOR  ¶  1.c:  Gov  2 at  8)  Applicant  was  arrested  in
October 2014 and charged with possession of marijuana. (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 1 at 40-41;
Gov  2  at  7;  Gov  3; Gov  5).  Finally,  Applicant  was  arrested  in  July  2016  and  charged
with  possession  of  marijuana.  (Gov  1  at  41-42;  Gov  2  at  7;  Gov  4;  Gov  5).  Applicant
pled  guilty  to  both  offenses.  Applicant  was  issued  a  citation  for  possession  of
marijuana, a misdemeanor offense, during both incidents. He was not arrested.
The  police  officer  involved  in  the  October  31,  2014,  incident  summarized  the
events leading to Applicant’s citation for possession of marijuana in  a police report. He
stopped a car driven by Applicant’s girlfriend for speeding. Applicant was a passenger in
the car. Once the window was rolled down, the police officer noticed a strong smell of
fresh  marijuana  coming  within  the  vehicle.  He  told  Applicant  and  his  girlfriend  that  he
was going to search the car for marijuana and asked them to step out of the car.  Fresh
marijuana  wrapped  in  white  paper  was  discovered  in  an  open  compartment  by  the
dashboard. Five partially smoked marijuana cigarettes were found inside the ash tray by
the  dashboard.  Applicant  and  his  girlfriend  were  separately  read  their  Miranda  rights.
Applicant’s  girlfriend  said  that  she  does  not  smoke  marijuana  but  Applicant  does  and
smokes in the car with his friends. She said all of the marijuana in the car belonged to
Applicant. After being read his rights, Applicant admitted that all of the marijuana in the
car belonged to him. He was issued a summons for possession of marijuana. (Gov 3 at
7)
The  police  report  for  the  July  7,  2016,  indicated  that  this  incident  began  when
Applicant  pulled  into  a  convenience  store.  When  he  walked  into  the  store,  a  police
officer  who  was  outside  the  convenience  store  near  Applicant’s  car  smelled  a  strong
odor  of  marijuana  coming  from  Applicant’s  car.  When  Applicant  exited  the  store,  the
officers  asked  Applicant  if  the  car  belonged  to  him.  They  told  him  that  they  smelled  a
strong smell of marijuana coming from his car. They told him they were going to search
his  car  based  on  probable  cause.  Applicant  became  upset  and  told  them  they  did  not
have  probable  cause  to  search  the  car.  The  car  was  searched  and  a  plastic  bag  of
green  leafy  plant  material  was  found  in  the  center  console.  The  green  leafy  plant
material tested positive as marijuana. The marijuana was confiscated and Applicant was
issued a summons for possession of marijuana. (Gov 4 at 6-7)
In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d
and 1.e. He clarifies his answer to SOR ¶ 1.a by indicating he used marijuana off and
on between 2014 and 2015. He denies the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c because
he  claims  he  never  distributed  marijuana  and  “would  never  say  a  statement  like  that.”
(Response to SOR, dated January 7, 2020)
Personal Conduct
Under  the  Personal  Conduct  Concern,  the  SOR  cross  alleges  the  allegations
listed under the Guideline H, Drug Involvement Concern.  In addition, the SOR alleges
under  the  Personal  Conduct  Concern  that  Applicant  falsified  material  facts  during  his
background investigation interview on July 18, 2018; by stating:
(SOR ¶ 2.b)  that he used marijuana from January 2014 to February 2014,
when he used marijuana at least from January 2014 to July 2016;
(SOR ¶ 2.c) that he was not using marijuana when he was cited for
possession of marijuana in October 2014; and
(SOR ¶ 2.d) that he was not using marijuana when he was cited for
possession of marijuana in July 2016.
for
On  April  30,  2018,  Applicant  submitted  an  electronic  questionnaire
investigations  processing  (e-QIP)  also  known  as  a  security  clearance  application.  In
response to questions in Section 22, Applicant listed his two citations for possession of
marijuana  in  2014  and  2016.  In  response  to  questions  in  Section  23  –  Illegal  Use  of
Drugs  or  Drug  Activity,  Applicant  estimated  that  he  used  marijuana  between  January
2014 and July 2016, in the amount of “7-10 times total.” (Gov 1, sections 22 and 23, at
40-44)
On  July  18,  2018,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  who  was
investigator
conducting  his  security  clearance  background
subsequently  prepared  an  unsworn  summary  of  the  interview.  Regarding  his  October
2014 arrest for possession of marijuana, Applicant told the investigator that he claimed
the  marijuana  in  the  car  was  his  to  protect  his  girlfriend.  Applicant  also  said  the
marijuana  joints  were  left  behind  in  the  car  by  someone  else.  During  his  July  2016
investigation.  The
citation  for  misdemeanor  possession  of  marijuana,  Applicant  again  claimed  the
marijuana  found  in  his  car  did  not  belong  to  him.  He  purchased  the  marijuana  for  a
family member. (Tr. 41-42Gov 2 at 6-7)
Applicant told the investigator that he smoked marijuana between January 2014
and February 2014, on average of one to two times per week. He does not know why
he  listed  the  last  date  of  marijuana  use  on  paperwork  as  July  2016.  He  told  the
investigator  that  he  occasionally  purchased  marijuana  for  friends  and  family  members
when requested. He is aware that it is illegal to purchase and possess marijuana in the
state where he resides. He told the investigator that he intends to continue to purchase
marijuana for family and friends when requested.  (Gov 2 at 8)
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Department Counsel sent Applicant
a set of interrogatories. The interrogatories attached a summary of Applicant’s July 18,
2018, interview with the investigator conducting his background investigation. Applicant
was told to read the summary of the interview. He was given an opportunity to point out
any  inaccuracies  in  the  summary  of  the  interview.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  the
summary  of  the  interview  was  accurate.  He  swore  (or  affirmed)  that  he  read  the
enclosed  report  of  his  July  18,  2018  interview  and  that  he  found  the  report  to  be
accurate  or  that  he  amended  the  report  to  make  it  accurate.  He  signed  the  document
before a notary on October 2, 2019. (Gov 2)
During  the   hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  never  distributed   marijuana.  He
said   he used marijuana “on and off” from 2014   to 2015.  He   again stated that when he
was charged with possession of  marijuana  in  2016,  the marijuana was not his. He  was
charged  because   it  was  found   in   his  car.   (Tr.   19)   Applicant   also  admitted  during  the
hearing  that  he  used  marijuana  during  the  2014  arrest  for  marijuana   possession.  He
admitted that marijuana was his and not his girlfriend’s.  (Tr. 44-46)
Regarding his July 2016 arrest for marijuana possession, Applicant testified that
he  did  not  use  marijuana  in  2016.  He  claims  he  was  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana  because  no  one  else  admitted  ownership  of  the  marijuana.  He  has
occasionally  purchased  a  small  amount  of  marijuana  for  a  family  member.  He  did  not
believe  that  purchasing  marijuana  for  a  family  member  was  considered  marijuana
distribution. At the hearing, Applicant claimed the only time he purchased marijuana for
a family member was in July 2016. He purchased about $20 worth for his cousin. (Tr.
45-49, 52)
Later  in  the  hearing,  Applicant  claimed  that  he  did  not  use  marijuana  in  2015.
Applicant testified that his last day of marijuana use was in October 2014. He has not
associated  with  people  using  marijuana  for  several  years.  His  marijuana  use  was
recreational. He does not have a drug problem. (Tr. 51-54)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  irresponsibility.  The
SOR  alleged  11  delinquent  accounts  that  were  placed  for  collection,  an  approximate
total balance of $13,149. This was, in large part, the result of low-paying jobs. The SOR
alleged 11 delinquent accounts to include:  a $950 cable television account placed for
collection  (SOR  ¶  1.a:  Gov  2  at  9;  Gov  7  at  1);  a  $682  medical  account  placed  for
collection  (SOR  ¶  1.b:  Gov  2 at  9;  Gov  6  at  4;  Gov  7  at  2);  a  $542  satellite  television
account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 7 at 2); a $429 medical account placed
for collection (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 7 at 2); a $729 student loan account that was placed for
collection  (SOR  ¶  1.e:  Gov  7  at  2);  and  a  $6,166  debt  owed  after  an  automobile
repossession (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 6 at 2-3).
Additional  delinquent  debts  include:  a  $293  cell  phone  account  placed  for
collection (SOR ¶ 1.g: Gov 1 at 51; Gov 2 at 9; Gov 6 at 5; Gov 7 at 4); a $1,023 cable
television  account  placed  for  collection  (SOR  ¶  1.h:  Gov  6  at  4);  a  $1,159  cell  phone
account  placed  for  collection  (SOR  ¶  1.i:  Gov  2  at  9;  Gov  6  at  4);  a  $617  satellite
television account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 6 at 4); and a $550 debt placed
for collection (SOR ¶ 1.k: Gov 1 at 51-52; Gov 2 at 9; Gov 6 at 5).
Applicant  obtained  good  employment  in  2018.  From  2018  to  early  2020,  he
earned about $41,000 a year. His current annual income is $44,000. (Tr. 22, 27) In early
2018,  Applicant  began  working  with  a  credit  counseling  group  to  help  him  repair  his
credit  and  to  settle  accounts.  He  stopped  working  with  them  a  few  months  before  the
hearing because he felt they were working too slowly. He decided to pay off the debts
on his own. (Tr. 27-29; Gov 2 at 8). Applicant said all of his debts were paid off.  The
record was held open after the hearing to provide Applicant the opportunity to provide a
copy of his agreement with the credit repair firm; a copy of his budget, a copy of receipts
or  other  documentation  which  proved  the  debts  were  paid,  and  a  copy  of  his  most
recent credit report. (Tr. 17-18, 55-57)
The status of the debts alleged in the SOR are as follows:
SOR ¶ 3.a: $950 cable television account placed for collection: Applicant denies
this debt. He claims  it  has been paid.  He was  going  to  provide proof  of  payment  after
the hearing. He did not provide proof of payment.  (Tr. 30)
SOR  ¶  3.b:  $682  medical  debt  placed  for  collection:  Applicant  denies  this  debt.
He claims it was paid. The October 2019 credit report indicated that the debt was being
disputed.  Applicant  did  not  provide  further  evidence  indicating  that  the  debt  was
resolved. (Tr. 30; Gov 7 at 2)
SOR  ¶  3.c:   $542  satellite  television  account  placed  for  collection:  Applicant
denies  this  debt.  He  claims  it  was  removed  from  his  credit  report.  The  company
claimed  he  had  equipment  which  belonged  to  them.  He  claims  he  returned  the

"Applicant,  age  42,  divorced  his  wife  of  five  years  in  2010.  He  has  two  children,
ages 15 and 20. He earned a bachelor’s degree in  2001. He has been employed by a
defense  contractor  as  an  engineer  since  2010.  This  is  his  first  application  for  a  DOD
security clearance. (Item 3)
Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 1994 through June 2017.
He purchased marijuana for his use two times per year from 1996 through January 2016.
He  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  on  five  to  ten  occasions  between  1997  and  June
2016. He used a topical ointment containing CBD derived from hemp on one occasion in
May  2019.  The  record  did  not  specify  the  THC  content,  if  any,  of  the  CBD  ointment.
Because  this  CBD  use  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  I  will  consider  it  only  to  evaluate
mitigation and the whole person concept. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5; FORM response)
Applicant  did not  report  any  CBD  use in his  November  2017 SCA  or  during  his
November 2018 security clearance interview (SI). The first time he mentioned it was in
his November 2019 response to interrogatories (ROI). In reply to a question about using
marijuana in  the  future,  he responded “No”  with  the  following explanation:  “CBD  helps
anxiety, relaxation. If THC is legal [with respect to a DOD clearance] I would in the future.
I  don’t  use  enough  or  depend  on  it  that  I  need  it.  I  don’t  miss  it.”  The  Government
apparently  construed  this  explanation  as  an  “express  intent  to  use  CBD  products,”  as
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. In response to the alleged intent to use CBD in the future, Applicant
wrote  “I  admit  ignorance”  and  explained:  “I  was  unaware  that  CBD  from  Hemp  is  still
considered  a controlled substance. I did use this on one occasion and did not like the
sleepiness  and  have  not  used  this  since  May  2019.”  In  his  FORM  response  (FR),  he
asserted that in the ROI he meant to say: “I would not use [CBD] in the future unless it
was made legal with respect to DOD’s clearance  protocol.”  He maintained in his  SOR
answer (SA) and FR that he has only used CBD one time. Given the concerns about CBD
use expressed by the Government in the SOR and FORM, Applicant considers CBD use
to be incompatible with maintaining a security clearance. (Items 2, 4; FR)
Applicant described the circumstances of his drug use and his intent about using
drugs in the future at various stages throughout the security clearance process: on his
November 2017 SCA; during his November 2018 SI; in his November 2019 ROI; in his
March  2020  SA;  and  in  his  August  2020  FR.  His  descriptions  varied  as  noted  in  the
bulleted paragraphs below. In his FR, he affirmed generally: “I have not and will not use
these illegal substances ever again.” (Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant described the circumstances of his marijuana use as follows:
“pain relief, socially/recreationally used 1-5x month”  (SCA)

   used one  to three times per month  by himself and  one  to three times per
month at  parties or social gatherings;  used for relaxation and  to socialize
better with others  (SI)
“by myself, with friends or acquaintances, small groups, 1-2 inhales” (ROI)
“I  have   used  marijuana  for   pain  relief  and  stress  reduction  when  I  was
younger. This was for  sports injuries and  stress. My doctors have  pointed


to  the   medicinal  and   therapeutic   value.  While  using  this  drug,  I  used  it
sparingly, understood its effects, and only did it under safe circumstances.”
(FR).
Applicant described his intent about using marijuana in the future as follows:
   checked   “no” in   reply to question  of whether intends to use in   future and
explained:  “not addicted, don’t need it” (SCA)
   does not need to use marijuana  because his career is more important to
him and  has given him the motivation to stop  using it; plans  to use it in  the
future if it becomes a legal substance  (SI)
   checked   “no”  in   reply  to  question  about   whether  he  intended  to  use
marijuana  in   the   future  and   explained:   “CBD   helps  anxiety,   relaxation.  If
THC is legal  [with respect to  a  DOD clearance] I  would in the future. I don’t
use enough or depend on it that I need it. I don’t miss it.”  (ROI)
“I understand  the consequences  and  I understood  them when I signed  the
[SCA]. I have not used [marijuana] recently and will not use again.” (FR)

Applicant described the circumstances of his marijuana purchases as follows:
“mental health, relaxation, social use”  (SCA)

   usually purchased  while  attending  music festivals and  shows, purchased for
his own personal use to help with relaxation (SI)
Applicant described his intent about purchasing marijuana in the future as follows:
   checked  “no” in  reply to question of  whether intends to purchase in  future
(SCA)
   no intent to purchase in the future because his job responsibilities are more
important to him;  he simply does not need it (SI)
Applicant described the circumstances of his mushrooms use as follows:
“social group use, 5-10x lifetime” (SCA)

   used at parties during college the first four or five times; could not recall
the details of the other times that he used them, except that his last use
occurred while attending a concert  (SI)
   used to enhance his perception at a party or concert (SI) (in his FR, he
denied ever stating this and said that the statement was not true)
“5x-10x lifetime, mostly college, small trusted groups . . . with
acquaintances . . . no visuals/psychoactive experience;”  amount taken
during June 2016 concert: “a minimal amount;” “1 stem, 1 cap” (ROI)

Applicant described his intent about using mushrooms in the future as follows:
   checked   “no” in   reply to question  of whether intends to use in   future  and
explained:  “not  addicted,  don’t  need  to  do  it,  clearance  depends   upon  it”
(SCA)
   does  not plan to use in  the future  as his career is more important  and  he  is
capable of staying away from it (SI)
   answered “no” to  question about using  mushrooms in  the future; “I meditate
and  use other forms of natural mindfulness for connecting with my beliefs
and relating to others.” (ROI)
Applicant described the circumstances of his CBD use as follows:


“I did use [CBD] on one occasion and did not like the sleepiness” (SA)
“CBD helps anxiety, relaxation.” (ROI)
“legal substance used for medicinal purposes”  (FR)
Applicant described his intent about using CBD in the future as follows:
   used one time; has  not used since May 2019 (no specific statement about
intent  for future use)  (SA)
referenced prior statement (presumably clarifying  his 2019  ROI) that he
would not use CBD “in  the future unless it was made legal with respect to
DOD’s protocol” (FR)
“I will not use CBD again.”  (FR)

Applicant was required to list three people “who know [him] well” on his 2017 SCA.
He described one such individual as a friend and work associate (Friend X). From March
2016  through  November  2018,  Applicant  worked  part-time  for  a  company  owned  by
Friend X. Applicant  and Friend X  used marijuana  together  on at least  one occasion in
June 2017, which was Applicant’s last use. He and Friend X used mushrooms together
on at least one occasion. (Item 3 at 15; Items 4, 5)
During  his  2018  SI,  Applicant  declared  that  nearly  all  of  his  close  friends  and
associates, including Friend X, used marijuana. In reply to a question  in his 2019 ROI
about  whether  he  continued  to  associate  with  individuals  who  use  any  illegal  drugs,
Applicant checked “yes” and did not elaborate any further. In his 2020 SA, he stated “I do
not regard my friends as bad influences as they have been understanding and supportive
of my desires to obtain [sic] clearance.” In his 2020 FR, Applicant asserted that he does
not associate “with individuals who use marijuana regularly” or “with anyone who has a
drug use problem.” He further stated that:
The  people  I  associate  with  have  children,  pay  taxes,  [sic]  never  been
arrested, and vote and participate in their communities. As an adult, I have
changed  aspects  of  my  life  with  respect  to  my  selection  of  events  I
participate in and whom I go to places with, but I will never be ashamed of
the people I associate with . . . I do not and will not be around people or
events where substance abuse occurs.
Applicant presented reference letters from four individuals who praised his  work
performance,  character,  and  trustworthiness.  Of  the  four,  one  is  a  family  friend  who
serves as a U.S. court of appeals judge; two serve as local county commissioners (one
is also a work colleague, and the other knows him through his volunteer work); and one
is the director of the government agency whose contract Applicant supports (who is also
a  friend).  None  of  these  letters  indicated  that  the  individuals  were  aware  of  either
Applicant’s drug use or the SOR allegations. (AE A through C).
Applicant  is  active  in  his  community.  He  organizes  and  supports  United  Way
fundraisers and runs an adult basketball league. He holds his own  youth charity event
every  summer.  He  is  an  active  volunteer  with  his  local  rotary  club.  He  helps  with  the
rotary’s various events, including those supporting veterans and its annual charity regatta.
Applicant asserted that he has the “utmost love and respect for our Nation and its secrets.”

"The SOR alleges under Guideline H (SOR ¶ 1.a), and cross-alleges under Guideline
E (SOR ¶ 2.a), that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about January
1972  to  at  least  February  2019,  including  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  When
Applicant responded to the allegations, he admitted the use of marijuana, but clarified that
most  of  his  marijuana  use  occurred  during  his  20s  and  30s;  that  he  used  marijuana
occasionally, perhaps once every six months, during his 40s and 50s; and that he “only
started  using  marijuana  in  the  last  few  years right  before  bed  to  help  [him]  sleep.”  He
admitted that he held a security clearance but claimed that he never worked on sensitive
information. He asserted that he stopped using marijuana with no intention of future use
and is willing to undergo drug testing to prove his abstention. Applicant denied the personal
conduct security concerns, indicating that he did not attempt to conceal his marijuana use
in any way and that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (GE 1.)
After  considering  the  FORM,  which  includes  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR
allegations (GE 1), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 66-year-old information technology specialist, who has worked for his
current employer, a defense contractor, since August 2018. He earned a bachelor’s degree
in June 1995 and a master’s degree in June 2002. He has been married to his current wife
since May 1993, and they have a son age 25 and a daughter age 22. Applicant also has a
42-year-old  son  from  his  first  marriage  and  a  30-year-old  daughter  from  another
relationship that did not result in marriage. As of December 2018, Applicant and his current
spouse’s two children were still living at home. (GE 2.)
Applicant  worked  as  an  information  technology  specialist  for  a  large  defense
contractor  from  January  1974  to  April 2014.  He  held  a  DOD security  clearance  at  the
secret level from about January 1976 while in that job. (GE 2.) Applicant, who had begun
using marijuana in January 1972, continued to use the drug at a frequency not specifically
delineated in the evidentiary record other than that most of his marijuana use occurred
during his 20s and 30s. He naively believed that marijuana was harmless and did not affect
anyone else. (GEs 2-3; AE A.) Applicant asserts that the sensitive work for which he held a
security clearance “never materialized.” (GE 1.) During his 40s and 50s (from about late
1993 through 2013), Applicant asserts that he used marijuana occasionally, “maybe once
every 6 months,” at times with a friend. (GE 3; AE A.)
When  medical  marijuana  became  available  in  his  state,  Applicant  “deemed  it
acceptable to use [marijuana] to relax before sleep,” and he began using marijuana on
occasion  for  that  purpose.  (AE  A.)  A  review  of  pertinent  state  law  shows  that  medical
marijuana use was decriminalized in 1996.  See California’s Health and Safety Code §
11362.5. With the passage of Proposition 64 at the November 8, 2016 statewide general
election, adults age 21 and over could legally consume and possess up to one ounce (28.5
grams)  of  marijuana  for  recreational  purposes.  See  California’s  Civil  Code  §  1550.5.
Applicant did not provide a specific date for when he began using marijuana as a sleep aid.
He indicated in response to the SOR that he “only started using marijuana in the last few
years  right  before  bed  to  help  [him]  sleep.”  There  is  no  evidence  that  he  ever  held  a
medical marijuana card.
Applicant worked as an information technology manager for a satellite television
company  from  September 2014  to  March 2016; was unemployed from  March 2016 to
February  2017;  and  worked  as  a  systems  and  programming  manager  for  a  candy
manufacturer from February 2017 to February 2018, when he was fired for work-related
issues. (GE 2.)
Applicant asserts, albeit without corroboration, that he had stopped using marijuana
after he left his job of 40 years in 2014, but resumed his occasional use after he was hired
by his current employer in August 2018. During the job application process, Applicant was
informed that he would need a security clearance for the position and asked whether that
would be a problem for him. Applicant asked his future managers what type of behavior
could pose a problem and was given no guidance. His employer did not require that he
take a drug test, which he thought was “very odd” since drug tests were required for other
jobs that did not require a security clearance. He “wrongly thought that marijuana usage
was not a concern, and felt comfortable with resuming [his] occasional marijuana use.”
(AE A.)
On  December  6,  2018,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). Applicant disclosed on his SF 86
that he had used marijuana in the last seven years; that he first used it in approximately
January  1972  and  most  recently  in  November  2018.  As  to  the  nature,  frequency,  and
extent of his marijuana use, Applicant stated, “I use it socially and as a sleep aid. I used it
on and off and most recently 2 or 3 times a week.” Applicant responded affirmatively to
whether he used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. He answered “Yes” to
whether he intends to use the drug in the future and explained, “A proper night’s sleep is
very important to [his] health.” (GE 2.)
On February 20, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant explained that he was currently
using marijuana by pipe a couple of times per week on average to help him sleep and that
he purchases marijuana legally from a dispensary, spending less than $100 per quarter for
the  drug.  He  added  that  since  the  1970s,  he  has  used  marijuana  once  every  couple
months to every few months socially with a friend. Applicant denied any use of marijuana
before work or during the daytime, any dependency on the drug, and ever testing positive
for the drug. Applicant expressed his intention to continue to use marijuana, but also his
willingness to stop “if asked by federal law in order to maintain a security clearance.” He
indicated that he would resume using marijuana after he retires. (GE 3.)
On January 31, 2020, the DCSA issued an SOR to Applicant because of his history
of  marijuana  use,  including  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  explained  in
response that most of his marijuana use occurred some 35 to 45 years ago and was “at
best occasional (maybe once every 6 months) in [his] 40’s and 50’s; that he only started
using marijuana in the last few years before bed to help him sleep; that while he held a
clearance many years ago, he never worked on any project that required a clearance; and
that he had ceased using marijuana and had no plan to use the drug in the future. He
indicated  that  he  was  using  over-the-counter  medications  to  regulate  his  sleep  and
expressed  willingness  to  undergo  drug  testing  to  prove  his  abstention.  In  response  to
personal conduct security concerns raised by his use of marijuana, Applicant admitted that
he knew his marijuana use might cause a problem, but he did not conceal his involvement.
(GE 1.)
Applicant denies that he was ever a habitual user of marijuana. He asserts that he
stopped using marijuana more than six months ago and plans not to use marijuana in the
future. (AE A.)

"Applicant  is  66 and  married  to  his second  wife.  Applicant  was  employed  by  the
Defense  Department  from  1971  until  2010,  when  he  retired.  Since  that  time  he  has
been  employed  by  the  Defense  Department  as  a  contractor.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance  almost  continuously  since  1971,  and  seeks  to  retain  national  security
eligibility for access to classified information in connection with his employment. (Item 3
at Sections 13A and 25, Item 4.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance because he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted both allegations under
this paragraph.
1.a.  Applicant used marijuana  at  least ten  times from  January  1975 to  January
1982. During all that time Applicant held a security clearance. (Item 2, Item 3 at Section
23, Item 5; Applicant Exhibit A.)
1.b.  Applicant  again  used  marijuana  from  approximately  December  2016  to
December  2019.  He  smoked  marijuana  approximately  60  times  during  that  period.
Applicant held a security clearance for the entire period. (Item 2, Item 3 at Section 23,
Item 4, Item 5; Applicant Exhibit A.)
Applicant self-reported his drug use during an interview with an investigator from
the  Office  of  Personnel Management  (OPM)  on  December 29,  2017.  According  to  the
investigator, “He [Applicant] decided to answer positively during the interview since he
regretted not disclosing it on the case papers.” (Item 4.)
In  response  to  a  set  of  interrogatories,  Applicant  admitted  to  continuing  to  use
marijuana  until  December  2019.  This  means  he  continued  to  use  marijuana  for  two
years  after  admitting  his  use  to  the  OPM  investigator.  He  also  admitted  to  purchasing
marijuana (Item 4.)
In  his  Answer  (Item  2),  Applicant  stated,  “I  know  that  I  did  not  have  a  medical
prescription for it [marijuana use] and that it was not the right thing to do, but because I
could not drink any alcohol, I used marijuana on occasion to help me relax.”
Paragraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance because he has engaged in conduct that shows questionable judgment, lack
of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  an  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations.
Applicant admitted both allegations under this paragraph.
Applicant  filled  out  an  e-QIP  on  October  20,  2017.  (Item  3.)  Section  26  of  that
questionnaire concerned Applicant’s drug use history. Specifically, Applicant was asked
if  he  had  used  any  illegal  drugs,  including  marijuana,  within  the  last  seven  years.
Applicant was also asked if he had “EVER” illegally used drugs while holding a security
clearance.  [Emphasis  in  original.]  He  answered  both  of  these  questions,  “No.”  These
were false answers to relevant questions concerning his drug abuse history.
Other  than  his  own  general  description,  Applicant  did  not  submit  any  evidence
concerning the quality of his job performance. He submitted no character references or
other evidence tending to establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was
unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to
have his case decided without a hearing.

her current employer since December 2015. She attended college for a period without
earning a degree. She is married for the third time, but she and her husband have been
separated for more than ten years. She has two adult children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 30-
32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant has a history of criminal behavior, primarily related to substance abuse.
She  started  smoking  marijuana  in  about  1978  while  in  high  school.  She  continued
periodically  using  marijuana  until  about  2014.  She  told  a  background  investigator  in
September 2016 that she smoked marijuana on a weekly basis, off and on, from 1978
until she stopped smoking marijuana in 2014. She was interviewed again in May 2017,
and  provided  similar  information.  She  stated  that  she  did  not  use  marijuana  at  all
between  1992  and  1995,  and  then  smoked  marijuana,  with  some  breaks  of  weeks  or
months,  until  2014.  In  her  response  to  the  SOR,  she  wrote  that  she  stopped  using
marijuana  in  1984,  and  then  resumed  after  decades  of  abstinence  “for  medicinal
purposes  only”  for  her  bad  back.  She  testified  that  she  only  smoked  marijuana
occasionally, maybe once every year or two with her friends, with her most recent use in
about 2012. She later testified that her marijuana use varied from about once a month
to about once every two to three months, with a period of abstinence of about eight to
nine years. (Tr. at 25-28, 51-57; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  1990  and  charged  with  possession  of  a  controlled
substance. The controlled substances were marijuana and methamphetamine. She was
convicted  of  the  charge  and  sentenced  to  30  days  in  jail,  which  was  suspended,  and
probation for 24 months. (Tr. at 23-24, 34-38; GE 2, 3)

Attorney’s Office declined to prosecute. (Tr. at 23, 38-40; GE 3)
Applicant was arrested in 2004 and charged with criminal mischief and disorderly
conduct. She testified that she had been drinking, and she set her ex-husband’s clothes
on  fire  on  the  lawn.  She  thought  the  charges  were  dismissed.  However,  the  FBI
identification  record  indicates  that  she  was  convicted  of  the  offenses.  She  was
sentenced  to  six  months  in  jail  (suspended)  and  a  $500  fine  for  the  criminal  mischief
offense; and ten days in jail and a $100 fine ($50 suspended) for the disorderly conduct
offense. (Tr. at 23, 40-41; GE 3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2006  for  injury  to  property.  She  stated  that  she

with 178 days suspended; probation for 12 months; 48 hours of community service; and
a  fine.  Applicant  does  not  believe  she  was  too  drunk  to  drive.  She  asserted  that  she
only had one beer. She admitted it was a large beer of about 32 ounces. She stated that
her blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .04%. (Tr. at 20-22, 43-47; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  June  2015  and  charged  with  disorderly  conduct  and
trespassing  on  private  property.  She  paid  a  fine,  and  was  ordered  to  complete
community service. The charges were then nolle prosequi (dismissed). She stated that
she and a friend were in a bar in a resort town. Her friend became extremely intoxicated
and was yelling and screaming. The hotel they were staying at  attempted to kick them
out. They were subsequently arrested. (Tr. at 20, 47-49; GE 2, 3)
Alcohol  played  a  significant  role  in  Applicant’s  criminal  record.  She  stated  that
she rarely drinks anymore, and then only in moderation. She has not been arrested or
charged  with  anything  since  the  June  2015  arrest.  Applicant  moved  to  her  current
location  in  2014  to  live  with  her  son  who  is  in  the  military.  He  has  been  a  positive
influence  on  her,  and  she  no  longer  associates  with  a  bad  crowd.  He  has  noticed  a
change  in  her  and  believes  that  she  is  honest,  loyal,  and  not  a  threat  to  national
security. (Tr. at 28-29, 49, 58-62; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
April  2016.  She  reported  her  2011  DUI  and  her  2015  arrest  for  disturbing  the  peace
(disorderly  conduct).  She  denied  any  involvement  with  illegal  drugs  in  the  previous
seven  years.  Applicant  told  the  background  investigator  that  it  was  unintentional,  and
she  must  have  misread  the  question.  She  testified  that  she  did  not  list  her  marijuana
use because she “wasn’t a big-time marijuana smoker. It was an occasional thing, and
[she]  didn’t  think  it  would  be a big  deal.” She  also  indicated  that  she  is  “not  good  with
words . . . . [She] didn’t leave it out on purpose. [She] just didn’t know how to word it.”
(Tr. at 25-27; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  two  defaulted  student  loans  and  a  $370  delinquent  medical
debt. Applicant rehabilitated the student loans, and they are in good standing. She was
jointly responsible for her ex-husband’s medical debt. He was supposed to pay it. It is
not reflected on the two most recent credit reports in evidence. (Tr. at 33-34; GE 4-6)

"Applicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
previously  granted  to  him  by  the  Defense  Department  in  2006.  He  has  worked  as  an
engineer technician for a company in the defense industry since about 2005. His formal
education  includes  some  college  in  2008.  His  employment  history  does  not  include
military  service.  His  first  marriage  ended  in  divorce  in  2006.  He  married  his  current
spouse in 2010. He has an adult child from a previous relationship,  a minor child from
his first marriage, and two minor stepchildren from his current marriage. The three minor
children live  with Applicant and his spouse. His spouse is employed outside the home
as a human-resources manager for a private company.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  involvement  with  marijuana  going  back  to  the  early
1990s,  which  he  does  not  dispute.  The  SOR  is  concerned  about  three  particular
incidents in 1992, 1995, and 2017. Each is discussed below.
Applicant was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, a marijuana pipe or
bong,  in  March  1992.  The  arrest  stemmed  from  a  police  investigation  of  a  domestic
disturbance  at  the  home  where  Applicant  was  living  at  the  time.  The  county  attorney
declined  to  prosecute  the  case  due  to  possible  problems  with  the  search,  resulting  in
insufficient evidence to ensure a reasonable likelihood of conviction.2
Applicant was arrested about three years later in June 1995 for the misdemeanor
offenses of possession of marijuana and  driving on a suspended license.3 At the time,
2 Exhibit A.
3 Exhibit B.
he was using marijuana once or twice a week.4 His arrest stemmed from a traffic stop
due  to  an  expired  registration.  The  vehicle  was  searched  and  a  small  amount  of
marijuana in a container was discovered. He subsequently pleaded guilty and the court
imposed  a  fine,  which  he  was  supposed  to  pay  over  time.  He  failed  to  make  timely
payment and ended up serving about 40 days in jail in lieu of the fine.5
The third incident occurred on January 1, 2017, when he smoke marijuana (three
to four puffs off a joint) while attending a New Year’s Day party unaccompanied by his
spouse.6 He tested positive for marijuana on a random drug screening test on January
26,  2017.  His  employer  was  notified  of  the  positive  test  on  January  31,  2017,  and  he
was suspended without pay. He had not reported the marijuana use before the positive
drug  test  result.  Subsequently,  his  employer  decided  that  his  continued  employment
was  contingent  upon successful completion  of  an approved  substance-abuse program
and a negative drug test result. He completed the approved substance-abuse program
with  no  further  services  recommended  on  March  23,  2017.  He  had  drug  testing  on
March  27,  2017,  which  produced  a  negative  test  result,  and  he  returned  to  work  the
following day under a last-chance agreement with his employer.7
At the hearing, Applicant attributed his January 2017 marijuana use to a lapse in
good judgment.8 He described the incident as “a weak, stupid moment,” “a stupid move
on [his] part,” and he deeply regrets it.9 He stated that he had not used marijuana since
his arrest in 1995.10 He has no intention of using marijuana or any other illegal drug in
the future. He submitted a signed statement of intent setting forth his intention to abstain
from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.11
In  addition  to  the  signed  statement  of  intent,  Applicant  submitted  a  number  of
documents  in  support of  his  case.12  The  documents  include  highly  favorable  letters  of
recommendation  from  two  co-workers  as  well  as  a  letter  of  reference  from  the  senior
minister  of  his  church.13  He  submitted  proof  of  his  attendance  at  multiple  sessions  of

Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.14
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.15  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”16  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.17 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.18
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a  security  clearance  for  access  to  confidential,  secret,  or  top-secret  information.19  An
unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any  existing
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.20
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.21  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.22  An

Discussion
Under  Guideline  H  for  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,  the  concern  is
that:
[t]he  illegal  use  of  controlled  substances,  to  include  the  misuse  of
prescriptions and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances
that  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  use  in  a  manner
inconsistent  with  their  intended  purpose,  can  raise  questions  about  an
individual’s  reliability  and  trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior
may  lead  to  physical  or  psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,
and regulations. . . .25
In addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence
(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws
prohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state
can authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances
Act,  which  identifies  marijuana  as  a  Schedule  I  controlled  drug.  Second,  changes  to
state  laws  (and  the  laws  of  the  District  of  Columbia)  concerning  marijuana  use  do  not
alter  the  national  security  adjudicative  guidelines.  And  third,  a  person’s  disregard  of
federal  law  concerning  the  use,  sale,  or  manufacture  of  marijuana  remains  relevant
when making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions:
AG ¶ 25(a) any substance abuse;
AG ¶ 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug;
AG  ¶  25(c)  illegal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  including
cultivation,  processing,  manufacture,  purchase,  sale,  or  distribution;  or
possession of drug paraphernalia;
AG  ¶  25(f)  any  illegal  drug  use  while  granted  access  to  classified
information or holding a sensitive position;
23 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
24 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
25 AG ¶ 24.
AG  ¶  26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment; and
AG  ¶  26(b) the  individual acknowledges  his or her drug  involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including  but  not
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)
changing  or  avoiding  the  environment  where  drugs  were  used;  and  (3)
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility.
I  have  considered  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  involvement  with  marijuana,  which
includes two arrests, one conviction resulting in some jail time, and the recent January
2017  marijuana  use  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  Indeed,  his  January  2017
marijuana  use  was  about  six  months  after  he  submitted  his  June  2016  security
clearance  application.  Any  illegal  drug  use  is  relevant  in  the  context  of  evaluating  a
person’s  security  worthiness,  but  it  is  particularly  egregious  if  it  occurs  while  granted
access to classified information. Applicant’s involvement with marijuana during the early
1990s is easily mitigated as youthful indiscretions that are common among some people
in their early 20s. The fact that he was granted a security clearance in 2006 bears this
point out. The same cannot be said for his marijuana use in January 2017 as a working
engineer technician for a company in the defense industry. More is expected given his
age  and  maturity  in  January  2017.  And  Applicant  should  have  known  better  in  light  of
his decade of employment with a defense contractor while holding a security clearance
and being subject to random drug tests.
Applicant presented a good case in  reform and rehabilitation. It is apparent that
he now understands the seriousness of his January 2017 marijuana use while holding a
security clearance. Nonetheless, I am not persuaded that he is an acceptable security
risk.  I  reached  that  conclusion  for  a  couple  of  reasons.  First,  his  January  2017
marijuana  use  was  clearly  forbidden  conduct  that  he  chose  to  engage  in  despite
knowing  the  potential  negative  consequences.  In  addition  to  being  a  serious  lapse  in
good  judgment,  his  marijuana  use  demonstrated  a  willingness  to  engage  in  high-risk
behavior, which does not make him a good candidate for a security clearance. Second,
I  doubt  Applicant’s  January  2017  marijuana  use  would  have  come  to  light  but  for  the
random  drug  test.  He  did  not  report  his  January  2017  marijuana  use  to  his  employer,
but instead hoped to avoid detection by having the substance pass through his system
before the next random drug test. His reluctance to voluntarily self-report such adverse
information further undermines his suitability for a security clearance.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence  or  vice  versa.  In  particular,  I  considered  the  fact  that  Applicant’s  employer
elected  to  continue  his  employment  after  his  January  2017  marijuana  use.  I  also
considered  the  whole-person  concept.  I  conclude  that  he  has  not  met  his  ultimate
burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.

"Applicant is 25 and single. He has a bachelor’s degree and has been employed
by a defense contractor since 2015. This is his first application for a security clearance.
He  seeks  to  obtain  national  security  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  in
connection with his employment. (Item 3 at Sections 12, 13A, and 25.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance  because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations
under this paragraph.
1.a.  Applicant  began  using  marijuana  as  a  sophomore  in  college  in  November
2012. He used it at least monthly until March 2017, two years after he began working for
a defense contractor. Applicant purchased marijuana during the period he was using it.
Applicant stated in his Answer and in Applicant Exhibit A that he last used marijuana in
March 2017. (See Item 3 at Section 23.)
Applicant stated in Applicant Exhibit A that he has remained friends with people
he used marijuana with in the past. He stated, “I believe I can still see these guys on an
occasional basis and not use drugs again.”
1.b. Applicant admitted using cocaine twice in his life. The first time was in 2012,
and the second time was in 2015 about a month before he graduated from college. He
1 Department Counsel submitted four Items in support of the SOR allegations. Item 4 is inadmissible. It is
the  summary  of  an  unsworn  interview  of  Applicant  conducted  by  an  interviewer  from  the  Office  of
Personnel Management on March 24, 2017. Applicant did not adopt the summary as his own statement,
or  otherwise  certify  it  to  be  accurate.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.20,  this  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI)
summary is inadmissible in the Government’s case in chief in the absence of an authenticating witness.
(See Executive Order 10865 § 5.) In light of Applicant’s admissions, Item 4 is also cumulative. Applicant
is  not  legally  trained  and  might  not  have  understood  Department  Counsel’s  FORM  footnote  1,  which
described  the  potential  admissibility  of  Item  4.  I  therefor  reviewed  Item  4  for  any  potentially  mitigating
information that Applicant might have thought would be considered.  Any such mitigating information will
be discussed later in this decision.
stated that he has not used cocaine since 2015, and does not intend to use cocaine in
the future. (Answer; Item 3 at Section 23.)
1.c.  Applicant  admitted  using  hallucinogenic  acid  on  a  single  occasion  in
approximately  June  2016.  This  was  about  a  year  into  his  employment  in  the  defense
industry. He stated that he was offered some acid at a music festival and used it on an
experimental  basis.  He  does  not  intend  to  use  acid  in  the  future.  (Answer;  Item  3  at
Section 23.)
1.d. Applicant stated in Item 3 at Section 23 that he intended to continue to use
marijuana into the future. He also stated:
I  never  had  any  intention  of  using  marijuana  after  graduating  college
because of my career goals. For about the first year of being employed I
didn’t  use  any  drugs.2  Now  that  attitudes  in  the  nation  are  changing
towards  marijuana  use  I  haven’t  really  seen  an  issue  in  continuing
smoking  weed.  If  having  a  security  clearance  would  require  me  to  stop
then I definitely would.
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  making  this  statement.  He  further  stated,
“However, since  March  of 2017,  I have not  used  marijuana and  I do not  intend  to use
marijuana while under consideration for and if granted a security clearance.”
Finally, in Applicant Exhibit A Applicant wrote, “I would like to formally state that I
do not intend to use illegal drugs while under consideration for and in possession of a
security clearance.”
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  evidence  concerning  the  quality  of  his  job
performance.  He  submitted  no  character  references  or  other  evidence  tending  to
establish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or  reliability.  I  was  unable  to  evaluate  his
credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided
without a hearing.

"Applicant is a 31-year-old electronics technician currently employed by a defense
contractor since February 2016. He received his general equivalency degree in 2005. He
served on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 2008 until April 2013, when he received
a general discharge. He was granted a secret security clearance while on active duty.
(GX 1; Tr. 18-19.)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges that in November 2012, while on active duty,
Applicant tested positive for cocaine. He received an Article 15 and was fined, sentenced
to  extra  duty,  placed  on  restriction  for  45  days,  and  reduced  in  rank.  He  was  later
separated from the Army with a general discharge. Applicant tested positive for opiates
in 20141 while enrolled in a Veterans court deferred program after having been arrested
and charged for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Under Guideline F,
the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  and/or  pay  state  taxes  for  tax  year  2010.
Finally,  the  SOR  cross-alleges  the  Guidelines  H  and  F  allegations  under  Guideline  E.
Applicant admits the cocaine-related allegation, and that he tested positive for opiates,
however, he denies having ever used opiates. He admits that he did not timely file or pay
his 2010 taxes, but states that he has since resolved all his tax obligations. Applicant’s
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
In November 2012, Applicant was 24 years old and on active duty in another state.
He was living in an off-base apartment complex where other soldiers who he worked with
also lived. Applicant was at a party that was attended by soldiers and civilians who lived
in the apartment complex. Applicant was drinking alcohol. One of the civilians, with whom
Applicant  was  previously  acquainted,  offered  Applicant  cocaine.  He  made  a  “poor
decision” and tried the cocaine. Later that month, Applicant tested positive for cocaine in
a random urinalysis. He was ultimately separated from the Army with a general discharge.
(GX 2; Tr. 38-40.) Although unalleged, Applicant held a security clearance at the time he
tried cocaine, and his clearance was revoked when he was separated. (GX 2.) He regrets
his behavior and considers it to be a serious mistake. Applicant has not used any illegal
drugs  or  misused  prescription  drugs  on  any  other  occasion.  (Tr.  41-49.)  Applicant
provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance
misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation
of  his  security  clearance.  (AX  F.)  He  moved  back  to  his  home  state  and  does  not
associate with any of the people who were at the party or anyone else who uses illegal
drugs. (Tr. 41.)
1 Applicant's positive urinalysis was actually on July 6, 2014, not in November 2014,as alleged in the SOR. AX H.
In July 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with suspicion of driving under
the influence of alcohol (DUI). The previous night, Applicant met up with a friend in the
friend’s hometown and they took a cab to a bar. Applicant had left his vehicle at his friend’s
apartment complex. His friend left the bar before Applicant, who later took a cab back to
his friend’s apartment. Applicant’s friend was not home, so Applicant slept in his vehicle.
When he awoke, his cell phone battery was dead. Applicant was attempting to drive home
when he was pulled over for speeding. The officers smelled alcohol on Applicant, had him
perform field a sobriety test, and asked him to take a breathalyzer. Applicant refused the
breathalyzer and was arrested for suspicion of DUI. (Tr. 41-43.)
The  DUI  charge  was  referred  to  the  veterans  court  where  Applicant’s  case  was
placed in a deferral program. Applicant was required to pay approximately $1,200 in fines
and court costs. The program required that Applicant call in every day for one year to find
out whether or not he was scheduled for urinalysis on that day. In July 2014, Applicant
tested  positive  for  opiates,  specifically  morphine,  on  a  random  urinalysis.  Applicant
adamantly denies any use of any type of opiate ever, and does not have an explanation
for the positive test result. His drug screenings from the day before and five days after the
positive  result  were  both  negative.  (Tr.  45-49;  Tr.  56-61.)  Applicant’s  39  other  random
drug screenings were negative. (AX H.) Protocol for testing positive for drug use was 48
hours in jail and an additional 6 months in the program. Applicant spent 48 hours in jail,
but  was  not  given  any  additional  time.  Applicant  successfully  completed  the  deferral
program  in  November  2014.  (AX  I.)  He  has  not  had  any  subsequent  alcohol-related
events. (Tr. 70.) His voluntary June 2018 drug screening was negative. (AX J.)
While  in  the  Army,  Applicant  was  deployed  overseas  for  just  under  one  year  in
2010 and 2011. He did not file his state tax return or pay his state taxes owed for tax year
2010  because  he  mistakenly  thought  he  was  exempt  due  to  his  deployment.  When
preparing his 2011 tax returns, Applicant realized he was required to file his 2010 state
tax return and filed it with his 2011 return. However, Applicant did not pay the 2010 taxes
owed at that time. Between 2011 and 2016, the state retained Applicant’s refunds to offset
the balance owed by Applicant, which was approximately $250. Applicant fully paid the
balance  owed  for  his  taxes  before  September  2017.  Applicant  timely  filed  and  paid
Federal and state taxes for all other tax years including 2018. (GX 2; Tr. 72-77; AX G; Tr.

Applicant’s  supervisor,  site  lead,  and  operations  lead  testified  that  they  have
known Applicant since February 2016 and are aware of the SOR allegations. Collectively
they consider Applicant to be trustworthy, reliable, and a person of strong moral character.
They do not think that Applicant’s past mistakes are reflective of the person his is today.
(AX A; Tr. 14-33.) Applicant’s field support lead, site supervisor, and assistant program
manager have also worked with Applicant since February 2016 and consider his honesty
and  integrity  to  be  unquestionable.  (AX  A.)  Each  of  Applicant’s  character  references
highly recommend Applicant for a security clearance. (AX A; Tr. 14-33.) Applicant was
sincere, candid, and humble while testifying.

to be a nurse’s aide in late 2013 and an automotive technician in July 2016.  He is not
married  but  is  in  a  cohabitant  relationship  with  his  fiancée.  They  have  a  two-year-old
daughter. (GEs 1-2; AE A; Tr. 20, 26-27, 32.) Applicant is employed in automobile sales,
but  he  has  an  offer  of  defense-contractor  employment  contingent  on  him  obtaining  a
security clearance. (Tr. 27-28.)
Applicant began using mood-altering substances as a teenager. He was influenced
by friends in his environment and used marijuana on a daily basis with two friends from
June 2010 to June 2014. He purchased the drug from those friends, and he sold marijuana
to his friends. The date when he started drinking alcohol is not in the record, although he
volunteered that he drank alcohol in quantity of five drinks or more to intoxication until early
2015, when he then moderated his consumption. (GE 4; Tr. 30, 70.)
Applicant also began committing crimes as a teenager. At age 15 in July 2009,
Applicant broke into some vehicles with a friend and stole loose change and a GPS unit.
He  was  charged  with  felony  burglary  and  placed  on  two  years  of  probation.  In
approximately July 2011, Applicant was loitering at a local baseball field with three friends
when the police arrived. Intoxicated from drinking at a party earlier that night, Applicant ran
into a pharmacy and stole five packs of cigarettes. He was given accelerated rehabilitation
for the theft. (GEs 1, 4.)
The month following his high school graduation, Applicant started the nurse’s aide
program at a local community college in July 2011. That September, he began working a
part-time retail job. (GEs 1, 4.)
On March 20, 2012, Applicant was arrested for sale of a controlled substance, a
felony.1 He was a passenger in a vehicle with some friends when they were pulled over by
the state police for a brake light issue. The police smelled marijuana because Applicant
and his friends had been smoking the drug in the backseat, and Applicant had multiple
bags of marijuana in his jacket. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 52-53.) Applicant completed court-ordered
treatment for his marijuana use from September 2012 to November 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 37.)
1 During his subject interview, Applicant recalled the offense as occurring in May 2012, and that he was at a
carnival with three bags of marijuana to sell and to smoke. He indicates that an unknown individual walked up
to him and gave him a cell phone for the marijuana. Applicant was then arrested in a vehicle in the parking lot.
(GE 4.) An FBI record shows that he was arrested in March 2012 for sale of a controlled substance. (GE 3.)
The statute Applicant violated, Section 21a-277(b) provides in part:
(b) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds,
transports with intent to sell or dispense, possesses with intent to sell or dispense, offers,
gives  or  administers  to  another  person  any  controlled  substance,  except  a  narcotic
substance, or a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, except as authorized in this
chapter, may, for the first offense, be fined not more than twenty-five thousand dollars or be
imprisoned  not  more  than  seven  years  or  be  both  fined  and  imprisoned;  and,  for  each
subsequent  offense,  may  be  fined  not  more  than  one  hundred  thousand  dollars  or  be
imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or be both fined and imprisoned.
The FBI record does not indicate that he was arrested for possession with intent to sell as alleged in the SOR,
although intent to sell would violate the same statute.
Applicant sold marijuana with some regularity, including at times once or twice a
week, from 2012 to September 2014. He sold the drug usually to friends and “here and
there” to friends of his friends. His profit from the marijuana sales was usually enough for
him to purchase more for his personal consumption. (Tr. 35-37, 45.)
On  April 7, 2012, Applicant was stopped for OUI and reckless driving, although
formal charges were not filed against him until December 2012. Applicant had consumed
alcohol at a party when his companion suggested that he drive because he appeared to be
more sober. He drove her to another party, where Applicant became “totally drunk.” He
then  drove  three  friends  to  a  store,  but  on  returning  to  the  party  with  his  friends,  he
“blacked out” and crashed his vehicle into a house. Applicant was unconscious, and broke
his neck and back in the accident. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 56-61.) He was ordered into alcohol
counseling following his arrest in December 2012, which he completed. (Tr. 38-39.)
Applicant was terminated from his part-time retail job in July 2012 after he failed to
report for work. He failed to keep track of his work schedule and was often tardy. Applicant
also  speculates  that  his  co-workers  may  have  told  his  supervisor  that  he  smelled  of
marijuana. He had rolled a “blunt” in the bathroom the day before his termination, although
he claims it was for future use. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 43-44.)
Applicant was unemployed from July 2012 to June 2013. He supported himself by
selling marijuana. He also spent his time partying. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 44.) On June 17, 2013,
Applicant was sitting on his porch when a minor age 15 or 16 spat at him. It escalated into
a physical altercation. A few weeks later, the police charged Applicant with risk of injury, a
felony, and with assault, 3rd degree, and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. (GEs 1,
3-4;  Tr.  62-64.)  Applicant  now  asserts  that  he  “just  basically  restrained”  the  minor  by
putting him in a headlock to calm him down.2 He denies that he injured the youth in any
way and attributes his arrest to the youth’s brother, who disliked Applicant. (Tr. 64.)
Applicant worked as a part-time cashier at a doughnut shop from June 2013 to
August 2013. He was late for work several times because he was out too late partying and
did not report for his 5:00 a.m. shift. He was issued written warnings three or four times
before being fired for tardiness. Applicant was unemployed for the next year. He supported
himself by selling marijuana. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 45.)
On March 1, 2014, Applicant was arrested for felony sale of a controlled substance
and for misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Applicant was stopped by the police in
2 Applicant testified about the July 2013 assault of a minor, as follows:
They said that [the minor] was bleeding. And they said that he was hurt. But the only thing I
did to him was I put him in a headlock and I had to calm him down. He kept trying to swing at
me. But I already knew that he was young and underage. So I just basically restrained him.
And even after the fact that he spit on me even after everything got broken up and all that
stuff. (Tr. 64.)
route to a party after he threw something from his vehicle. He had three bags of marijuana
on him to sell at a party, and he smelled of marijuana.3 (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 65-66.)
On June 26, 2014, Applicant was arrested for felony possession of marijuana, felony
sale of a controlled substance, felony conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to sell,
and  felony  conspiracy  to  sell  a  controlled  substance.  A  friend  contacted  him  about
purchasing some marijuana from him in a local parking lot. When Applicant arrived, the
police  arrested  him  for  selling  marijuana  for  financial  profit.  He  had  four  ounces  of
marijuana in his possession. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 66-67.) Applicant asserts that he ceased his
marijuana use in June 2014 because it made him feel “demotivated.” (GE 4.) He continued
to  sell  marijuana  until  September  2014  to  pay  for  his  lawyer.  He  possessed  some
marijuana after his arrest and he “wasn’t going to give it away.” (Tr. 45-46.)
With the aforesaid criminal charges still pending against him for offenses committed
since March 2012, Applicant began working part time as a cashier at a sporting goods
store  in  September  2014.  He  was  terminated  in  November  2014  after  he  was  caught
stealing. He is ineligible for rehire. Applicant attempted to steal some food from the store
because he did not have enough money to pay for lunch. He was making “wrong decision
after wrong decision.” (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 46-47.) Applicant lived at home with his mother, and
she supported him financially when he was unemployed from November 2014 to January
2015. (GE 4.)
In January 2015, Applicant began working as a part-time cook at a pizza restaurant.
He left the job in March 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 46.) According to the employer, he is not eligible
for rehire because he was slow and did not follow instructions. Applicant held a second
part-time job at a fast-food establishment from February 2015 to February or March 2016,
when he resigned to spend time with  his child and focus on his training to become an
automotive technician, which he had started in July 2015. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 50.)
Pursuant to a plea deal, on March 9, 2015, Applicant pleaded guilty to the March
2012 felony sale of a controlled substance and the April 2012 misdemeanor OUI (arrested
in December 2012). In exchange, the prosecutor entered nolle prosequi dispositions for the
April 2012 reckless driving infraction and all of the criminal charges filed against him since
July 2013.4 Applicant was sentenced for OUI to six months in jail (suspended); 18 months
of supervised probation, to be served concurrent with his probation for the felony drug
charge;  a  fine  of  $500;  and  100  hours  of  community  service.  For  the  felony  sale  of  a
controlled substance, he was sentenced to five years in jail, suspended; three years of
supervised  probation;  and  50  hours  of  community  service.  (GEs  1,  3-4;  Tr.  67-70.)  In
approximately May 2015, Applicant cut his ties with those friends involved with marijuana.
(Tr. 33.)
3 During his subject interview in March 2017, Applicant inaccurately recalled the possession and drug sale
charges as occurring in September 2013. (GE 4.)
4 A nolle prosequi (shortened as “nolle” in the FBI record) is a formal entry on the record by a prosecutor by
which he or she declares that there will be no further prosecution.
Applicant was drug tested during his probation on a regular basis, and all of the
tests  were  negative.  (Tr.  70.)  He  was  also  required  to  complete  counseling  for  his
marijuana use and to complete an Ignition Interlock Device (IID) Program. Applicant had
substance abuse counseling from  April 2015 to July 2015, which he asserts “definitely
started to drive [him], wake [him] up a little bit in the right direction.” (Tr. 40-41.) On his
completion of the IID program on September 26, 2016, the interlock device was removed
from his vehicle. He successfully completed his probations for the OUI on September 9,
2016, and for the felony sale of a controlled substance on March 9, 2018. (GEs 1, 3-4; AEs
B-C.)
As part of his employment application to work for his defense-contractor employer,
Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) on October 29, 2015. He disclosed his arrest record; his use of marijuana
(“Smoked a blunt once a day”) from June 2010 to June 2014; his sales of marijuana to his
friends once or twice a week from May 2012 to June 2014 “due to the surroundings in
which  the  substance  brought  upon  [him];”  and  his  completion  of  counseling  for  his
marijuana use in 2012 and 2015. He denied any intention to use marijuana in the future for
the following reason:
Marijuana has changed my life in a very negative way. Bad characteristics
had been introduced and held onto, through this substance. Through me
quitting this substance I’m more motivated and ready to pursue my career
and maintain a happy standard of living. (GE 1.)
In July 2016, Applicant earned his automotive technician certificate. (GE 4; Tr. 20.)
He has since worked in the automotive industry, primarily in sales, without any adverse
incidents. (GEs 1, 4.)
On March 2, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant discussed his criminal charges, his
marijuana use, his alcohol use, and his involuntary termination from some previous jobs.
He indicated that the date of his last use of marijuana was accurately reported on his SF
86 and that he was no longer associating with any known illegal drug users. About his
alcohol use, he indicated that his drinking had decreased since early 2015 to once a month
and not to intoxication. He admitted that he drank to intoxication once a week until early
2015. He denied any intention to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. He
did not expect his drinking habit to change in the future. (GE 4.)
On September 20, 2017, Applicant responded to interrogatories from the DOD CAF
concerning his illegal drug use. He indicated that he had used cannabis a total of 20 times
in 2011, 2012, and 2014. He responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he
had ever purchased, sold, transported, or manufactured the drug. He also listed a one-time
use of Xanax in 2015, which was apparently obtained from his mother-in-law who has a
prescription. He was working and going to school and used it as a sleep aid. (Tr. 41-42.)
He denied any use of marijuana since his arrest in March 2014.5 Applicant indicated that
5 Applicant disclosed discrepantly on his SF 86 that he used marijuana (“smoked a blunt once a day”) to June
he did not have any illegal drugs or paraphernalia in his possession and that he had no
current association with any illegal drug users.  He also responded “Yes” to whether he had
ever participated in any drug or alcohol rehabilitation program and disclosed that he had
inpatient therapeutic meetings from March 2015 to June 2015. (GE 2.)
At his hearing, Applicant testified that he has put his past behind him and wanted
the opportunity to work for the defense contractor that is sponsoring him for a clearance.
(Tr. 24-25.) He denies any marijuana use since June 2014 and any current association with
illegal drug users. He spends his time outside of work with his fiancée and their daughter.
He and his fiancée began dating around the time of his last arrest in 2014, and they are
currently cohabitants. (Tr. 32, 73.) His fiancée works as a dental assistant. (Tr. 32-33.) He
attributes his turnaround to his probation officer, who became a mentor to him. (Tr. 72.)
",True
"The SOR alleges under Guideline H and cross-alleges under Guideline J (SOR ¶
2.a) that Applicant used marijuana from approximately 2008 through 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.a),
and that he was arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia in January
2016 (SOR ¶ 1.b) and possession of marijuana in August 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant was
also  alleged  under  Guideline  J  to  have  been  arrested  and  charged  with  evading
responsibility with damage or injury in March 2017 (SOR ¶ 2.b). When Applicant answered
the SOR, he admitted that he had used marijuana as a teenager “at a few parties from
peer pressure.” He denied that he was arrested in 2016, and explained that he was issued
citations  in  each  instance.  He  pleaded  not  guilty  because  the  drug  paraphernalia  and
marijuana did not belong to him. He admitted that he had been arrested and charged with
evading responsibility in March 2017 “because of a hostile girlfriend and [him] trying to
leave the situation before things escalated.” He indicated that he had paid restitution and
was in counseling. (Answer.)
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 22-year-old high school graduate with technical school training in auto
body work, collision, and repair obtained from August 2013 to December 2015. He has yet
to earn a certificate or degree. He needs to complete one credit to raise his grade point
average to the 2.0 needed to graduate. (Tr. 49.) He is unmarried but has a two-year-old
daughter, for whom he pays child support of $119 a week. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 23.) He has never
held a security clearance. He has been offered employment by a defense contractor that is
contingent on him being granted a security clearance. (Tr. 51.)
While attending technical school, Applicant worked part time in retail and then for a
movie theater. He worked at a restaurant from July 2015 until January 2016, when he
resigned for a full-time auto body technician position. He left that job in June 2016 because
he did not think he was treated fairly, and he returned to work for the restaurant. (GE 1.)
As part of his application to work for a defense contractor, Applicant completed and
certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on July
8,  2016.  He  disclosed  that  he  had  been  arrested  in  January  2016  for  having  drug
paraphernalia in his vehicle, but that the charge was dismissed in April 2016. He listed no
other arrests and responded negatively to the illegal drug inquiries including the following:
In the last seven (7) years, have you been involved in the illegal purchase,
manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving,
handling or sale of any drug or controlled substance? (GE 1.)
On July 13, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). About his January 2016 arrest, Applicant stated
that he was in route home from work when he was stopped for a headlight violation. The
officer  conducted  a  search  of  his  vehicle  and  found  a  marijuana  grinder  and  bowl.
Applicant  denied  that  the  paraphernalia  belonged  to  him,  but  the  police  issued  him  a
citation  for  $100  with  an  option  to  appear  in  court.1  In  February  2016,  Applicant  was
advised that the charge would be dropped if he completed 20 hours of community service,
which he finished in April 2016. He expressed his belief that the charge was dismissed
1  Under  Section  21a-267(d)  of  his  state’s  general  laws,  use  or  possession  of  less  than  a  half-ounce  of
marijuana is an infraction:
(d)  No  person  shall  (1)  use  or  possess  with  intent  to  use  drug  paraphernalia  to  plant,
propagate,  cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process,
prepare,  test,  analyze,  pack,  repack,  store,  contain  or  conceal,  or  to  ingest,  inhale  or
otherwise  introduce  into  the  human  body,  less  than  one-half  ounce  of  a  cannabis-type
substance, or (2) deliver, possess with intent to deliver or manufacture with intent to deliver
drug paraphernalia knowing, or under circumstances where one reasonably should know,
that it will be used to plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound,
convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain or conceal, or
to ingest, inhale or otherwise introduce into the human body, less than one-half ounce of a
cannabis-type substance. Any person who violates any provision of this subsection shall have
committed an infraction.
when  he  provided  proof  to  the  court  of  the  community  service.  He  stated  that  the
paraphernalia had been left in his vehicle by a friend. Applicant then disclosed that he was
ticketed in August 2016 for possession of marijuana and a seatbelt violation. He explained
that  he  was  stopped  in  route  home  from  work,  and  the  police  found  a  small  bag  of
marijuana in his vehicle. Applicant believed that a friend left the drug in his car, and he told
the officer that the drug did not belong to him. He was issued a citation with a $175 fine for
marijuana possession and $65 for seatbelt violation. He requested a court appearance,
and indicates that, in October 2016, he was told that the charge would be dropped on
payment of a $100 “charitable contribution.” He expressed his belief that the charges were
dropped after he paid the $100.2 (GE 2.)
Applicant then revealed that, in February 2017, he was arrested for misdemeanor
evading responsibility.3 He was leaving a friend’s home when his girlfriend pulled up beside
him in her vehicle. He had called her names on the telephone earlier, and she challenged
him to a fight. Applicant refused to exit his vehicle and, while leaving, he “accidently swiped
the side of [his girlfriend’s] car.” He did not stop, and later that evening, the police arrested
him  for evading  responsibility.  At  a  court appearance on July 11, 2017, Applicant was
advised  that  a  nolle  prosequi  would  be  entered  in  a  year  if  he  completed  an  anger
management  class.4  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  yet  to  look  into  acceptable  anger
management classes, but he expressed his intention to attend the classes within the year.
He denied any intention to engage in criminal behavior in the future because he wanted to
get a good job and be a good role model for his daughter. (GE 2.)
Applicant also acknowledged to the OPM investigator that he should have answered
“yes” on his SF 86 to the inquiry concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years. He
then detailed that he used marijuana from 2008 to 2014 about once every three weeks with
his then friends. He took a few puffs off joints passed to him and did not purchase the drug.
Applicant used the marijuana to fit in with his friends. He never purchased the drug himself.
Applicant denied that his marijuana use ever caused him a problem because the 2016
citations occurred after he had ceased using marijuana. Applicant added that after he was
cited for marijuana possession in August 2016, he stopped associating with the friends
involved in his drug use. Applicant stated that he had no intention of using marijuana in the
future. He explained that he failed to report his marijuana use on his SF 86 because he did
not think that marijuana was still illegal.5 (GE 2.)
2 No citations or court records for either incidents were made available for my review.
3 The March 2017 date alleged in the SOR was the date of his first court appearance.
4 A nolle prosequi or nolle is a formal entry on the record by a prosecutor by which he or she declares that
there will be no further prosecution.
5 Effective July 1, 2011, the state changed the penalty for possessing less than one-half ounce of marijuana
from a potential term of imprisonment and large fine to a fine for a first and subsequent offense. See § 21a-
279a, which provides the penalty for illegal possession of small amounts of a cannabis-type substance:
(a)  Any  person  who  possesses  or  has  under  his  control  less  than  one-half  ounce  of  a
cannabis-type substance, as defined in section 21a-240, except as authorized in this chapter,
Available  information  about  the  February  2017  evading  responsibility  charge
indicates  that  Applicant  was  granted  accelerated  rehabilitation  in  June  2017  with  an
evaluation  for  anger  management  and  substance  abuse.  He  had  “just  made”  an
appointment  for  his  accelerated  rehabilitation  program  and  was  planning  to  make  an
appointment for his anger management and substance abuse counseling as of September
11, 2017. (GE 3.)
DOHA gave Applicant an opportunity to review and make any corrections to the
OPM investigator’s summary report of his July 13, 2017 interview. On November 8, 2017,
Applicant adopted the investigator’s report as accurate with one addition. He indicated that
he had started his anger management classes and counseling “in the past months.” (GE 2.
Applicant attended substance abuse counseling through the defense contractor’s
Employee  Assistance  Program  (EAP)  on  September  14,  2017,  September  22,  2017,
October 5, 2017, and March 29, 2017. His next session was scheduled for April 12, 2018.
(AE E.) He had no explanation for why the judge ordered him to complete substance abuse
counseling, but he suspected it was for alcohol. He testified that he was in a “downward
spiral with [his] relationship, so [he] would just drink.” (Tr. 78.) He also participated in group
sessions of a men’s anger management program focusing on defining and understanding
domestic violence and abusive versus respectful communication. He started on September
30, 2017, three weeks into a nine-week program, and attended five sessions before it
ended on November 11, 2017. (AE D; Tr. 82.) While the EAP counselor and the program
coordinator for the anger management program confirmed his attendance, neither provider
commented about his progress.
Applicant continues to deny that the drug paraphernalia and marijuana found in his
vehicle in January 2016 and August 2016 belonged to him. He was not arrested but rather
was ticketed. He paid his fine and completed his community service. He testified that he
completed  the  anger  management  program  required  for  evading  responsibility,  even
though he attended only five of the nine sessions. He testified that there was no required
number of substance abuse counseling sessions, but that he had attended six sessions.
(Tr. 45-47.) When asked about a previous admission during his OPM interview that he had
used marijuana from 2008 to 2014 about every three weeks, Applicant indicated that he
“just  gave  an  average time” for the dates. He expressed disbelief that he had told the
investigator he used marijuana about every three weeks, and that there must have been
some miscommunication. When asked for his present recollection about the frequency of
shall  (1)  for  a  first  offense,  be  fined  one  hundred  fifty  dollars,  and  (2)  for  a  subsequent
offense, be fined not less than two hundred dollars or more than five hundred dollars.
(b) The law enforcement officer issuing a complaint for a violation of subsection (a) of this
section shall seize the cannabis-type substance and cause such substance to be destroyed
as contraband in accordance with law.
(c) Any person who, at separate times, has twice entered a plea of nolo contendere to, or
been  found  guilty  after  trial  of,  a  violation  of  subsection  (a)  of  this  section  shall,  upon  a
subsequent plea of nolo contendere to, or finding of guilty of, a violation of said subsection,
be referred for participation in a drug education program at such person's own expense.
his marijuana use, Applicant responded, “I’ve tried it. I went to a few parties, tried it, and
that was it.” When asked for the number of times that he had used it, Applicant stated that
he  used  it  twice  between  2008  and  2014  at  a  party.  (Tr.  51-54.)  About  the  glaring
discrepancy  between  his  present  account  of  two-time  marijuana  use  and  the  adopted
report of interview (GE 2) containing his admission to using marijuana once every three
weeks, Applicant again asserted that it was a miscommunication between him and the
investigator.  (Tr.  55.)  Applicant  stated  that  he  last  associated  with  persons  that  use
marijuana “about a year ago.” He denied any intention of using marijuana in the future.
Applicant apparently passed a drug screen by hair analysis in 2017 for the job offer with
the defense contractor. (Tr. 56-58.)
About his possession of drug paraphernalia in January 2016, Applicant testified that
the police officer found the drug paraphernalia in the right cup holder between the driver’s
and passenger’s seats. Despite its obvious location, Applicant asserts he did not notice it in
his vehicle. Applicant’s explanation was that it must have been placed there by a friend
who had been in his car previously. He testified that he made no inquiries of his friends to
determine to whom it may have belonged because he did not want to argue “over a group
of friends.” He also stated that only two people could have left the paraphernalia in his
vehicle, and he told neither of them about it. Applicant indicated that the friends had been
in his vehicle probably a week before the incident. (Tr. 59-64.)
Regarding the August 2016 citation for possession of marijuana, Applicant could not
explain what prompted the officer to search his vehicle. When asked whether the officer
smelled  marijuana  or  suspected  that  he  was  using  it,  Applicant  answered,  “Not  to  my
knowledge, no. They didn’t say that.”  About where the officer found the marijuana, he
responded, “I believe it was on me, in my pocket.” He saw the marijuana on his passenger
seat, and when he got pulled over, he just put it in his pocket. He recalled that he had his
friends in his car the day before he was pulled over by the police. He again did not confront
those friends about the marijuana because he is “not a confrontational person.” (Tr. 65-71.)
As to why he continued to associate with known marijuana users after his daughter was
born and after he completed his SF 86, Applicant indicated that it took him some time to
realize that his friends were not there for him as he was for them. He would have done
anything for his friends, no matter what. (Tr. 72-73.)
Concerning  his  arrest  for  evading  responsibility,  Applicant  admits  that  he  had
tweeted things he should not have said to his girlfriend. He called her names and hit her
car, but she did try to cause a fight. He denies that he caused any damage to her vehicle.
(Tr. 74-76.)
Applicant had been employed as a painter for about a month as of his hearing. He
enjoys the work, but it is “iffy” with the hours. (Tr. 50-51.) He is struggling to pay his bills.
(Tr. 84.) He expressed regret for everything that he had done in the past. (Tr. 84.)

Applicant’s girlfriend testified that he has become more responsible over the three
years of their relationship. She has seen “a lot of improvement in his behavior” over the
past year. Over time, he changed his friends and become “a way better father.” She has
custody of their daughter, but Applicant keeps their daughter overnight for her so that she
can  work. She  told  Applicant  that she would not allow their daughter to be around his
friends who were a negative influence on him. She and Applicant are currently working on
their relationship and spend weekends together. Regarding the 2017 incident, they were
not seeing each other at that time (had broken off their relationship) and were being “very,
very mean to each other.” She was angry after arguing with him earlier in the day, and she
blocked his car. He tried to avoid the situation and hit her vehicle. Because he left the
scene, she called the police. (Tr. 20-26.)
Applicant’s father has almost 30 years of employment with  a clearance with the
defense  contractor  that  is  sponsoring  Applicant’s  application  for  a  security  clearance.
Applicant’s father testified that there were some trying times when Applicant’s girlfriend
was pregnant in that Applicant was “kind of flop-flopping around.” (Tr. 30.) Applicant has
become more responsible. Regarding his son’s arrest for evading responsibility, Applicant’s
father testified that it was wrong for Applicant to leave the scene, but he understands that
Applicant  was  trying  to  get  away  for  his  safety.  He  described  Applicant  as  more  of  a
follower than a leader. (Tr. 28-35.)
Applicant’s aunt, who has been a nurse in the mental health and substance abuse
field for ten years, attested to Applicant’s desire to work for the defense contractor. She is
aware that, “a few years back [Applicant] was hanging around with the wrong kids trying to
find his way in life.” She was surprised to learn that Applicant “tried marijuana, got ticketed,
and his girlfriend had him arrested for hitting her car when she completely blocked him in.”
However, Applicant realized that he had much to lose if he continued down that path, and
he changed his friends. She has noticed a maturity in Applicant since the incident involving
his girlfriend and does not consider him to be a threat to national security. (AE A.)
The mother of Applicant’s girlfriend testified that Applicant had her daughter did not
have a good relationship in the beginning, but that Applicant has come to be “a great dad
and  a  good  boyfriend.”  She  blames  her  daughter  for  the  2017  incident  that  led  to
Applicant’s  arrest.  Regarding  Applicant’s  drug  charges,  she  had  heard  there  was  one
arrest, but she found it hard to believe of him. She never saw Applicant using illegal drugs,
but when she first met him, he associated with “known potheads.”  She has not seen any of
those individuals in over a year. (Tr. 38-41.)
The grandmother of Applicant’s girlfriend has known Applicant for the past three
years and sees him when he visits his daughter and girlfriend, who live on the floor above
her.  (AE  B;  Tr.  41.)  Applicant  immediately  took  parental  responsibility  without  any
resentment and has been “an excellent and loving father.” To her knowledge, Applicant has
a good work ethic. She has not seen him smoke marijuana and asks that he be given the
chance  to  move  forward  by  obtaining  the  job  with  a  defense  contractor,  which  would
eventually provide him the income needed to marry his girlfriend and support a family. (AE

"Applicant is a 45-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
last granted to him by the Defense Department in 2007. He is employed by a company
working in the defense industry as a subject-matter expert in technologies and systems
based on Microsoft products. He has been so employed since 2012. His annual salary
is about $133,000, and he described his employment record as “excellent.” (Tr. 39) His
educational  background  includes  an  associate’s  degree  awarded  in  2000,  and  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  information  systems  awarded  in  2007.  His employment
history  includes  honorable  military  service  in  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  during  1994-1999.
He  served  as  an  aviation  electronics  technician.  He  was  granted  a  security  clearance
for the first time in about 1997 while in the Coast Guard.
Applicant  is  twice  married  and  divorced.  He  married  the  first  time  in  1994  and
divorced  in  2003.  He  married  the  second  time  in  2007,  separated  in  June  2014,  and
divorced in 2015. He shares two minor children with his second wife. His marijuana use,
which  began  in  2009  and  ended  in  about  mid-2014  or  so,  occurred  during  his  second
marriage,  as  he  smoked  it  with  his  spouse  and  another  woman.  Before  that,  he  had
never used marijuana. He indicated that his then spouse introduced marijuana into their
marriage.  (Tr.  36-37)  He  estimated  the  frequency  of  his  marijuana  use  as  four  to  five
times per year, at the most. (Tr. 38) He understands or believes that his marijuana use
was contrary to his employer’s policy. (Tr. 33)
Applicant  deliberately  omitted  his  marijuana  use  during  2009-2014  when  he
completed  his  February  2015  security  clearance  application.  In  particular,  he  did  not
disclose it in response to two questions.  First, he denied the use of any illegal drug or
controlled substance in the last seven years.  Second, he denied ever illegally using or
otherwise  being  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a
security  clearance.  At  the  hearing,  he  explained  that  he  omitted  his  marijuana  use
because he was concerned his employer would discover it. (Tr. 32) In addition, he failed
to  disclose  his  marijuana  use  when  asked  about  it  during  a  2017  background
investigation. (Tr. 33; Exhibit 2) He admitted his marijuana use after he was confronted
with it during the background investigation.  He considered marijuana to be  in his past,
and disclosure might negatively affect his chances of retaining a security clearance. (Tr.
33)1
At  present,  Applicant  has  no  intention  to  resume  using  marijuana  or  any  other
controlled substance or drug. (Tr. 33-34) To that end, in his written answer to the SOR,
he  stated  that  he  does  not  intend  to  illegally  use  any  drugs  in  the  future,  and  he  fully
understands  that  any  future  illegal  use  of  any  drugs  may  result  in  revocation  of  a
security clearance.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.2  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”3  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.4 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.5
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.6  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish

Discussion
Under  Guideline  H  for  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,  the  concern  is
set forth in AG ¶ 24 as follows:
[t]he  illegal  use  of  controlled  substances,  to  include  the  misuse  of
prescription  and non-prescription drugs,  and the  use  of  other  substances
that  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner
inconsistent  with  their  intended  purpose,  can  raise  questions  about  an
individual’s  reliability  and  trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior
may  lead  to  physical  or  psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,
and regulations. . .
In addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence
(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws
prohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state
can authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances
Act,  which  identifies  marijuana  as  a  Schedule  I  controlled  drug.  Second,  changes  to
state  laws  (and  the  laws  of  the  District  of  Columbia)  concerning  marijuana  use  do  not
alter  the  national  security  adjudicative  guidelines.  And  third,  a  person’s  disregard  of
federal  law  concerning  the  use,  sale,  or  manufacture  of  marijuana  remains  relevant
when making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions:
AG ¶ 25(a) any substance misuse;
AG  ¶  25(f)  any  illegal  drug  use  while  granted  access  to  classified
information or holding a sensitive position;
AG  ¶  26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment; and
AG  ¶  26(b) the  individual acknowledges  his or her drug  involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including  but  not
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)
7 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E.3.1.15.
changing  or  avoiding  the  environment  where  drugs  were  used;  and  (3)
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility.
I  have  considered  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  involvement  with  marijuana,  which
began  in  about  2009  and  ended  about  five  years  later  in  about  mid-2014  or  so.  The
entirety  of  his  marijuana  use  occurred  while  he  was  granted  access  to  classified
information and held a security clearance. Any illegal drug use is relevant in the context
of  evaluating  a  person’s  security  worthiness,  but  it  is particularly  egregious  if  it  occurs
while  granted  access  to  classified  information.  As  a  longtime  clearance  holder,
Applicant  knew  such  conduct  was  off  limits  and  forbidden,  but  engaged  in  it  just  the
same  on  an  on-again,  off-again  basis.  It  was  not  a  mere  lapse  in  judgment  or  an
isolated incident, as shown by the frequency of his use (about four times yearly) and the
duration  of  his  use  (over  a  five-year  period).  More  is  expected  of  Applicant  given  his
age,  experience,  and  maturity  during  2009-2014.  With  that  said,  his  last  use  of
marijuana  occurred  about  four  years  ago,  and  he  was  credible  in  stating  that  he  does
not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  Nevertheless,  the  seriousness  of  his
misconduct, illegal drug use while holding a security clearance, outweighs his evidence
in mitigation.
Under  Guideline  E,  personal  conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of
candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise
questions about a person’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or
sensitive information. The concern is stated fully in AG ¶ 15.
In analyzing the facts of this case, the following disqualifying condition applies:
AG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant
from  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history
facts
statement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine
employment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  national
security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.
As set forth in the findings of fact, Applicant made deliberately false statements when he
omitted his past use of marijuana in a February 2015 security clearance application. He
did  so  out  of  concern  that  his  employer  would  discover  his  illegal  drug  use.  He
acknowledged  his  marijuana  use  after  he  was  confronted  with  it  during  the  2017
background investigation.
I  have  considered  the  mitigating  conditions  under  AG  ¶  17,  and  none  apply  in
Applicant’s  favor.  Making  deliberately  false  statements  during  the  security  clearance
process  is  serious  misconduct,  and  it  is  not  easily  explained  away,  excused,  or
otherwise mitigated. Based on the record before me, Applicant’s misconduct in falsifying
his 2015 security clearance application is far too serious to be mitigated.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he
has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the substance of the sole Guideline
H allegation – that he illegally used marijuana between June 2002 and February 2017.
In his Answer, he disputed the frequency of his use, the period during which he used it
most  frequently,  and  his  recent  diminishing  use  of  marijuana.  His  admissions  in  his
Answer to the SOR and at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
thorough review of the record evidence, Applicant’s demeanor while testifying, and his
testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high  school  in  2003,  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2007,  and  completed  a  master’s
degree in 2014. He married in 2012, and has two sons, born in 2016, and 2017. This is
his first application for a clearance, but he had previously applied for and was granted
eligibility for a position of trust in 2013.
Applicant  started  illegally  using  marijuana  during  his  last  year  of  high  school
(2002).  He  continued  using  marijuana  while  in  college,  and  after  graduate  school.  He
testified that his use was with a close group of friends at intimate party gatherings. (Tr.
40) He averred that he never sought out marijuana, never purchased it, and that he no
longer  socializes  with  his  marijuana-using  friends.  He  estimated  he  used  marijuana  a
couple  of  times  a  year.  (Tr.  42)  Applicant  testified  he  tapered  off  his  illegal  use  of
marijuana  around  early  2009,  when  he  was  offered  a  job.  He  continued  to  use
marijuana, but in an annual or semiannual basis.
Applicant used marijuana once or twice a year until about 2016, when he started
to cut down on his use. He claimed that he did not use marijuana during the two periods
of nine months in 2013 and 2015, when  he held positions of trust. A corporation hired
Applicant for an internship position while he was a graduate student in about June 2013.
He submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF85P Format) in September
2013.  (GE  1)  In  his  response  to  Section 21 (Illegal  Drugs)  he  denied  using  any  illegal
drugs, including marijuana, during the last year. In his response to Section 23 (Your Use
of Illegal Drugs or Drug Activity), Applicant disclosed that: in the last seven years he had
illegally used marijuana “a couple of times” and further qualified his use as “a few times
while a student in college,” between August 2003 and May 2007.
In August 2015, Applicant, while working for his current employer, was assigned
to a position of trust with a federal agency. (Tr. 37) He was required to participate in a
drug-screening test when he in-processed for his 2015 position. Applicant claimed that
he did not use marijuana while working on the two positions of trust, because he did not
want  to  use  it  while  working  in  a  privileged  position,  and  he  had  a  very  busy  school
schedule, was married, and was working.
After his assignment to the position of trust ended in 2016, Applicant claimed he
illegally used marijuana only twice. Once in July 2016 during a summer barbecue party
with family and friends, an “old family friend” offered him marijuana and he accepted it.
He explained that had had a few beers, was not driving, had no other obligations, felt in
control of himself, and took “a hit of the joint.” (Tr. 48)
Applicant claimed that he regretted the incident immediately and began a period
of  reconsidering  his  behavior.  He  averred  he  did  not  feel  great  and  the  incident
provoked  him  anxiety.  His  father  learned  about  his  illegal  use  of  marijuana  and  asked
him, “Is that really something you want to be doing at this point in your life?” His father
suggested  Applicant  put  his  priorities  in  order  and  advised  he  did  not  use  marijuana
again. (Tr. 80)
In  February  2017,  Applicant’s  soon-to-be  brother-in-law  was  having  a  three-day
bachelor’s  party  in  another  state  with  friends  and  family.  Applicant  stated  that  he  was
encouraged by his friends to illegally use marijuana and he did. Applicant claimed that
he  no  longer  enjoys  using  marijuana  and  that  he  immediately  regretted  his  illegal
marijuana  use.  Applicant  claimed  he  has  no  knowledge  about  his  brother-in-law  using
marijuana again since the bachelor’s party.
Applicant’s  current  employer,  a  federal  contractor,  hired  him  in  August  2015.
Applicant  submitted  an  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations  Processing  (SF86
Format) in March 2017. (SCA, GE 1) In his response to Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs
or  Drug  Activity),  Applicant  described  his  illegal  use  of  marijuana  as  “used  very
sporadically  .  .  .  very  infrequent  use,  roughly  once  a  year,”  between  June  2002  and
February 2017. He claimed that he did not intend to use drugs of any sort once granted
a security clearance.
Applicant has done well in his analyst position, and was promoted to consultant.
He  is  currently  pending  further  promotion  to  senior  consultant.  Both  Applicant’s  co-
worker and his counselor consider him to be honest, reliable, and an invaluable asset to
his  employer.  He  continuously  receives  outstanding  feedback  from  clients,  coworkers,
and supervisors. He always conducts himself in a professional manner, works well with
others, and frequently takes the initiative in complicated issues. Both references believe
Applicant  is  genuinely  embarrassed  and  remorseful  about  his  past  use of drugs.  They
strongly  recommended  his  eligibility  for  a  clearance.  I  note  that  Applicant’s  counselor
did not seem to know the extent of his illegal marijuana use. She referred to his 17-year
period  of  illegal  marijuana  use  as  “his  mistake  two  years  ago,”  and  “his  brief  lapse  in
judgment.”
Applicant submitted a statement of intent promising never to use any illegal drugs
again, and agreeing to the immediate termination of his clearance for any violation. He
stated  that  in  2016,  he  started  thinking  about  the  choices  he  was  making  and  before
going to the bachelor’s party, he had decided to forego marijuana. He explained that the
use of marijuana did not represent the person he wants to be or the lifestyle he wants to
live. He noted that the demands on his life have increased as he got older. He now has
two children, recently purchased a home, and has been promoted to a more demanding
position.
Applicant  noted  that  he  has  been  honest  and  forthcoming  during  the  clearance
process,  disclosing  his  marijuana  use  in  the  2013  application  for  eligibility  for  a  trust
position  and  in  his  2017  SCA.  Applicant  claimed  he  was  not  aware  whether  his
employer  has  a  policy  against  the  illegal  use  of  drugs.  However,  he  was  aware  that
possession  of  marijuana  is  illegal  under  federal  law.  He  claimed  that  the  first  instance
he realized his illegal marijuana use could be a problem for his clearance was when he
received the SOR. Applicant loves his work and the career opportunities it provides. He
believes that he has been working hard to get to this point in his career. He would like to
be trusted with a clearance and to continue his career progression.

"In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all the SOR allegations, some with
explanations.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  senior  systems  analyst  for  a  DOD  contractor
(Contractor 1) who seeks a security clearance. She has been employed with Contractor
1  since  February  2018.    She  previously  worked  for  Contractor  1  from  May  2015  to
March  2017.  Between  March  2017  and  February  2018,  she  worked  for  another  DOD
contractor (Contractor 2). She was granted an interim security clearance in September
2015. She has a bachelor’s degree. She is married, has a four-year-old daughter, and is
expecting another child. She is the primary breadwinner. Her husband stays at home to
care for the children.  (Tr. 22, 43-44, 53; Gov 1) (Note: The facts in this decision do not
specifically  describe  employment,  names  of  witnesses,  or  locations  in  order  to  protect
Applicant and her family’s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.)
Under the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana
from  2015  to  November  2017,  after  she  was  granted  access  to  classified  information
(SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 2 at 3, 8); received treatment from Dr. R. from May 2012 to November
2013 for Drug Dependence (SOR ¶ 1.b Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 2); received treatment at a
substance  abuse  institute  from  April  2007  to  May  2011  for  Drug  Dependence  (SOR ¶
1.c:  Gov  2  at  7;  Gov  3  at  2,4);  and  received  treatment  at  a  county  health  substance
abuse center from August 2000 to April 2001 (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 2 at 11).
Additional  allegations  include:    use  of  cocaine  with  varying  frequency  from
January  2007  to  April 2010  (SOR  ¶  1.e:  Gov  2  at  9);  use  of  the  following  prescription
medications  without  a  prescription:  OxyContin,  Oxycodone,  Heroin,  and  Methadone
between December 2003 and October 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 2 at 8-9); used marijuana
with  varying  frequency  between  1996  and  November  2017  (SOR  ¶  1.g:  Gov  2  at  11;
Gov  3  at  3);  misuse  of  prescription  opiates  from  December  2003  to  December  2008
(SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 3 at 3); purchase of crack cocaine for personal use from January 2005
to  January  2010  (SOR  ¶  1.i:  Gov  3  at  3);  illegally  purchased  opiates  for  personal  use
between May 2003 and December 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 3 at 3); and a July 2001 arrest
for Possession of Marijuana and Drug Paraphernalia (SOR ¶ 1.k: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 4;
Gov 5).
The same conduct is cross-alleged under the personal conduct concern. (SOR
¶ 2.a) In her response to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations, but explains some
of her illegal drug use was more intermittent and sporadic than the language of the SOR
implies. (Response to SOR, dated May 19, 2018)
Applicant began drinking alcohol and using marijuana at age 12. Her alcohol use
varied  from  daily,  when  she  was  younger,  to  once  every  few  months,  to  once  a  week
during  the  past  few  years  before  she  quit  drinking  in  November  2017.  Her  marijuana
use  was  daily  when  she  was  younger.  She  stopped  using  for  several  years  and  her
most recent use occurred once or twice a year. She stopped using marijuana after her
November  2017  use.  Applicant  first  used  cocaine  when  she  was  16.  Her  cocaine  use
was  sporadic  from  age  16  to  22.    From  age  22  to  27,  she  used  cocaine  on  varying
occasions from several times a week to once a month. (Gov 3 at 3)
Applicant  first  used  opiates  around  2001,  when  she  was  19.  She  became
addicted to opiates when she was 22. She would use any form of opiate she could find
in order to keep from going into withdrawal. She eventually used heroin because it was
cheaper. From 2007 to 2011, Applicant was prescribed and administered Methadone to
combat  her  opioid  addiction.  In  2012,  she  began  seeing  a  psychiatrist,  Dr.  R.,  who
prescribed her the drug suboxone to help her become free of opiates and to help treat
her underlying psychological issues. She was able to ween herself off the suboxone by
November  2013  (age  32).  She  has  not  abused  opiates  since  that  time.  In  November
2015,  she  was  prescribed  Percocet  after  she  gave  birth  to  her  daughter.  She  has  not
used opiates of any sort since her daughter’s birth. (Gov 3 at 3)
Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant sporadically used LSD (twice a year
to every other year) from 1998 to 2004 (age 14 – 21); psilocybin (mushrooms) on three
occasions  between  1999  to  2004  (age  17  –  21);  and  crystal  methamphetamine  a  few
times in 2006 (age 23). (Gov 3 at 3) Because the use of these drugs was not alleged in
the SOR, I will not consider the use under the disqualifying conditions. However, I  will
consider them under the  extenuation and  mitigating  circumstances.  In ISCR  Case  No.
03-20327  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Oct.  26,  2006)  the  Appeal  Board  listed  five  circumstances  in
which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:
(a)  to  assess  an  applicant’s  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s
evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines
is  applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for whole-person  analysis  under
Directive Section 6.3.
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-
0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).
In July 2001, Applicant had one drug-related arrest for Possession of Marijuana
and  Drug  Paraphernalia.    After her arrest,  she  was  ordered  to  attend  treatment  at  the
county substance abuse center. SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant received a diagnosis
of drug dependence during this treatment.  The records from this treatment program are
not  in  the  record,  so  the  diagnosis  of  drug  dependence  during  this  treatment  is  not
confirmed. (Gov 4; Gov 5)
Applicant  voluntarily  attended  drug  treatment  at  an  institute  that  prescribed  her
methadone from April 2007 to May 2011. Applicant realized that if she continued using
heroin  it  would  be  a  death  sentence.  The  methadone  replaced  her  heroin  cravings.
However,  during  this  time  frame,  Applicant  was  offered  and  used  crack  cocaine  on
various  occasions.  Her  explanation  at  hearing  was  that  the  methadone  clinic  was  in  a
bad  area  and  it  was  common for other drugs  to  be  available.  (Tr. 57-58;  Gov  1  at  41-
153; Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 2,4)
After several years of using methadone, Applicant felt that she was replacing one
addictive  substance  for  another.  In  2012,  she  sought  the  assistance  of  Dr.  R.,  a
psychiatrist, who treated her for drug dependence as well as her issues with depression
and  anxiety.  Dr.  R.  prescribed  Applicant  suboxone.  If  applied  properly,  suboxone  is
helpful  for  heroin  users  to  ween  off  heroin  and  methadone.  Applicant  wanted  to  be
completely clean from both narcotics. She was able to be completely free of opiates by
November  2013.  (Tr.  25-27,  51-53;  Gov  1  at  46;  Gov  2  at  7;  Gov  3  at  2-4)  Applicant
continues to take medication to deal with her depression and anxiety. (Gov 3 at 4-7)
When Applicant completed her security clearance application on June 13, 2015,
she fully disclosed her history of illegal drug use. When commenting on the extent of her
drug use in Section 23 – Illegal Use of Controlled Substances, Applicant stated several
times:
I last smoked marijuana about 2 ½ years ago. I have been clean from all
illegal substances for about 4 years. I was once addicted to opiates, but I
have  undergone  extensive  treatment  for  the  disease  of  addiction  and  for
the underlying medical conditions for which I was self medicating. I am a
different person now than I was back then. I have married, started a family
and  earned  my  bachelor’s  degree  (graduating  with  honors).  I  do  not
associate with those who use illegal drugs, nor do I have any desire to use
again.
I am a proud mother to a beautiful 7 month old baby girl. I want to be there
for her in every way I can, and I want to set a good example for her (and
for  my  future  children).  I  want  to  continue  to  be  a  productive  and  law-
abiding  member  of  society.  I  intend  to  improve  upon  myself  and  build  a
good life for myself and my family. (Gov 1 at 40-43)
Despite her good intentions, Applicant used marijuana on two occasions in 2017.
On  the  first  occasion,  she  used  marijuana  in  April  2017  when  her  cousin  died
unexpectedly. She was at a post-funeral gathering, was drinking alcohol, and admits to
being intoxicated. Her cousin lit up a marijuana joint and Applicant smoked the joint with
her cousin. The last time she used marijuana was in November 2017. Applicant was on
a  business  trip.    The  hotel  where  she  stayed  had  free  happy  hour.  Applicant  drank
several  alcoholic  drinks  during  happy  hour.    She  stepped  outside  and  a  stranger  was
outside  smoking  a  marijuana  joint.  The  stranger  offered  the  joint  to  Applicant  and  she
used the marijuana joint with the stranger. At the time of use, Applicant was aware that
marijuana use is illegal under federal law and is against DOD policy. (Tr. 24, 46-51, 59-
63)
In response to interrogatories sworn by Applicant on February 9, 2018, Applicant
clarified  some  inaccuracies  in  the  sworn  statement  she  provided  during  a  background
investigation  interview  on  June  6,  2017.    In  response  to  Item:  014  of  her  Personal
Subject Interview, Applicant commented:
Investigator states “Subject’s last use of marijuana was on 01/2017” – this
is  incorrect,  last  use  at  the  time  was  4/2017.    Investigator  also  stated
“subject smoked by herself” – this is incorrect; I was at a family gathering
after a funeral service and smoked with a cousin. Investigator also stated:
“Subject states she smokes about one  a year, but stopped after 01/2017
due  to  having  a  new  baby  and  a new  job.”   -  This is incorrect;  I  stopped
smoking marijuana around 2007 and did not smoke again until 2015 (I had
my daughter 11/2014). Use has been very infrequent since 2015. (Gov 2
at 3)
Applicant  testified  she  had  been  drinking  alcohol  on  both  occasions  when  she
used marijuana in 2017.  Drinking alcohol made her uninhibited. She claims that she did
not abuse alcohol. She never got into trouble. Eventually, she realized the connection of
her alcohol use and her decision to use marijuana. Applicant claims she would not have
used  marijuana  if  she  had  not  been  drinking.  Applicant  sought  help  by  attending
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and developed a support system around her. She attends
AA meetings. She has a sponsor and attends a home group. She claims AA helped her
look  at  her  life  defects  and  helped  her  to  become  a  better  person.  Her  life  is  now
different and she has a strong network of friends. (Tr. 28-29)
Applicant attends two AA meetings each week. During the Sunday meeting, she
makes  coffee  and  helps  out  in  a  service  position.  She  also  attends  a  program  called
Celebrate  Recovery  which  is  a  church-based  12  step  program  that  she  attends  on
Friday night with her daughter.  Applicant explained the 12 steps as well as the books
that she uses in the program. She recently received her one-year chip celebrating her
sobriety. She has abstained from alcohol for a year. She abstained from marijuana for 1
½ years. Her last use of illegal opiates was over 10 years ago. Applicant’s definition of
sobriety is abstinence from all mind-altering substances. Her goal is to continue to work
the program and help others with sobriety. (Tr. 29-36)
Applicant  admits  that  she  did  not  dedicate  herself  to  her  previous  treatment
programs.  She  claims  the  difference  is  now  she  is  actually  working  the  program.
Attending AA has been a blessing for Applicant. Attending meetings helps her maintain
sobriety.  She  is  happier  when  she  is  helping  other  people  and  working  on  herself.
Applicant testified that her sober life is too important to give up. (Tr. 37-40, 68)
Ms. S., Applicant’s AA Sponsor, testified during the hearing.  She is retired and
has  never  held  a  security  clearance.  She  met  Applicant  over  a  year  ago  at  an  AA
meeting.    After  the  meeting,  Applicant  approached  her  and  asked  if  she  would  be  her
sponsor. As a sponsor, she provides support and helps Applicant work through the 12
steps. She  says  Applicant  has  worked  hard  at  her steps and has an  understanding  of
what  happened  in  her  life  and  how  her  life  is  now  different.  She  has  seen  a  lot  of
changes in Applicant over the past year.   Applicant now has a fine appreciation of the
gifts  that  she  has  in  her  life.  She  also  understands  that  she  cannot  use  any  kind  of
substance  that  is  considered  a  drug.  Ms.  S.  testified,  “A  drug  is  a  drug  is  a  drug.
Whether it be a legal drug, illegal drug, or alcohol. It is a mind-altering substance.” (Tr.
79-83)
Ms.  S.  testified  that  Applicant  not  only  attends  meetings,  but  is  a  home  group
member. She took a service position and developed close friendships with people who
are living sober lives and getting their lives on track. (Tr. 81)  Applicant understands that
when she drinks alcohol, she is at risk of using drugs. Ms. S. said that Applicant went to
great lengths to become clean and sober. She meets with Applicant every Sunday and
talks  to  her  several  times  during  the  week.  Applicant  has  reading  assignments.  The
assignments  are  used  to  gain  a  clear  understanding  of  what  recovery  means.  (Tr.  81,
83-84)
Over  the  past  year,  Applicant  has  become  more  self-aware.  She  is  honest  and
open.  She  is  working  on  making  amends  to  her  family  and  other  people.  She  is
accountable for her actions. She is aware of the damage she caused and the underlying
circumstances.  Applicant  has  a  good  grasp  on  recovery.  She  sometimes  needs
encouragement,  but  understands  that  this  is  “a  life  and  death  business.”  She  is  very
proud  that  Applicant  recently  received  her  one  year  chip.  Applicant  has  worked  very
hard  in  achieving  and  maintaining  sobriety.  She  believes  that  Applicant  will  maintain
sobriety indefinitely. (Tr. 85-91)
Applicant provided a formal statement indicating that she has no future intent to
use  any  illegal  controlled  substances  or  abuse  prescription  drugs.  She  is  willing  to
undergo  random  drug  testing  and  agrees  to  be  subject  to  revocation  of  her  security
clearance in the event of any future positive drug test.  (AE A Tab 13, Exhibit G)
Whole-Person Factors
Ms. B., Applicant’s current supervisor, testified on her behalf. She currently holds
a secret clearance and has an interim top secret clearance. She met Applicant in the fall
2015. They  were  co-workers  at  Contractor 1. They  became friends  outside  of  work as
well. Applicant left to work for  Contractor 2 for about a year. She returned in February
2018.  Ms.  B.  became  her  supervisor  when  she  returned.  Ms.  B.  describes  Applicant’s
duty performance as excellent. (Tr. 71-72)
Ms.  B.  is  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.  She  is  aware  that  Applicant  used
marijuana while holding an interim security clearance. During the year Applicant worked
Contractor  2,  Applicant  told  Ms.  B.  that  while  she  was  on  official  travel  she  got  drunk
and smoked marijuana. Applicant told Ms. B. that she needed help because her drinking
was  impairing  her  decision  making.  Applicant  then  began  to  attend  AA  and  another
church-based recovery program. (Tr. 72-74)
Ms. B. would not recommend someone for a security clearance who is currently
using illegal drugs. She states that Applicant is a sober person who is taking measures
to stay sober. She is dedicated to her recovery program. She is aware Applicant attends
AA meetings as well as another church-based recovery program. Applicant has a strong
will  to  stay  sober.  Applicant’s  husband,  family,  and  co-workers  support  her  efforts  to
stay sober. Ms. B. is confident Applicant will remain sober and has no reservations with
Applicant  holding  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  73-76)  Ms.  B.  also  wrote  a  letter  of
recommendation on Applicant’s behalf saying similar things. (AE A, Tab 11)
Mr.  T.,  the  director of  IT,  Client  Solutions,  for  Applicant’s  current  employer, has
known Applicant for three years. He worked with her on daily basis between May 2015
and March 2017. They have also become friends and occasionally socialize outside of
work. He has reviewed the SOR and is aware of the nature of the government’s security
concerns.  He  does  not  believe  the  allegations  are  reflective  of  Applicant’s  character,
patriotism, or willingness or ability to protect classified information. He says Applicant is
one  of  the  most  genuine  people  he  knows  and  possesses  a  high  degree  of  integrity,
responsibility,  and  honesty.  He  recommends  her  for  a  security  clearance.  (AE,  Tab  8,
Ex F1)
Mr.  Y.,  Applicant’s  program  manager  at  Contractor  2,  provided  a  statement
indicating Applicant was highly recommended candidate for a job as program manager.
She interviewed well and was hired. She worked for Contractor 2 from 31 March 2017
to  7  February  2018.  She  left  Contractor  2  because  of  some  funding-related  work
stoppages  in  her  division.  During  her  time  in  Contractor  2’s  employ,  Mr.  Y.  found
Applicant performed at a high level. She was highly dependable and responsible.  He is
familiar with the allegations in the SOR, but claims the allegations bear no resemblance
to  the  person  who  he  worked  with  over  the  past  year.  They  interacted  many  times
during  the  day  when  she  worked  at  Contractor  2.  She  had  no  appearance  of  being
under the influence or inebriated. She is a self-sufficient and responsible mother. Based
on  his interaction  with  Applicant,  he  believes  the  U.S.  Government  would  benefit from
Applicant being granted a security clearance. He believes the issues alleged in the SOR
have  been  resolved.  She  sought  help,  got  clean,  and  turned  her  life  around.  Mr.  Y.
states,  “Based  on  my  time  working  with  [Applicant]  she  is  concentrating  her  time  and
efforts  on  expanding  her  professional  skill  set,  maintaining  a  great  work  ethic,  raising
her family, and moving on from her past indiscretions. I feel that if allowed to continue
working  as  a  cleared  employee  she  would  continue  down  this  path.”  (AE  A,  Tab  10,

One Applicant’s co-workers and her former boyfriend’s sister provided favorable
reference  letters  on  her  behalf.  (AE  A,  Tab  9  ,  Ex  F2  and  Tab  12,  EX  F5)    Applicant
provided copies of her 2015, 2016, and 2017 Performance Reviews. All were favorable.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations. His admissions in
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old information technology specialist employed by a federal
contractor since February 2016. He graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree in
May 2011. He was unemployed after graduation until he was hired in March 2012 as an
administrative  assistant  at  a  small  marketing  company.  He  moved  to  another  area  in
September  2012  and  worked  for  six  months  as  an  administrative  assistant  at  a  small
software company. He moved again and worked as a day laborer at his father’s roofing
company.  He  was  unemployed  from  January  to  April  2013,  and  then  worked  as  a
landscaper  from  April  2013  to  January  2014.  He  was  unemployed  from  January  2014
until  he  was  hired  by  a  medical  marijuana  propagator  in  January  2015,  for  whom  he
worked until he was hired for his current job.
Applicant is unmarried, lives with a cohabitant, and has no children. (FORM Item
5 at 4.) He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant started using marijuana in May 2007 and used it every week or two with
friends  while  he  was  in  college.  After  he  graduated  from  college,  he  continued  to  use
marijuana every month or two with friends. He stopped using it in October 2012 because
it gave him anxiety. He resumed his marijuana use in October 2013, using it every month
or two with friends. He purchased it from various local drug dealers until January 2013,
when he moved to a state where marijuana was legal and obtained a marijuana card. He
told  a  security  investigator  that  he  obtained  a  prescription  for  marijuana  to  relieve
depression, and he obtained a marijuana card that allowed him to grow a limited number
of  marijuana  plants  and  to  purchase  marijuana  from  a  legal  marijuana  dispensary.  He

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
stopped growing, purchasing, and using it in October 2015. His marijuana card expired in
October 2016. (FORM Item 5 at 6.)
Applicant told a security investigator that he stopped using marijuana because he
was bored with using it, that he no longer associates with marijuana users, and that he
does  not  intend  to  grow  or  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  does  not  consider  himself
addicted  to  marijuana.  (FORM  Item  5  at  7.)  In  his  SCA,  he  stated  that  he  used  it
infrequently for nine years, “around once every month to two months on average,” but
that he would “sometimes go a year without using.” (FORM Item 4 at 40.)
When Applicant answered the SOR, he submitted a statement of intent to abstain
from all illegal drug involvement and substance abuse. He acknowledged that any future
drug  involvement  or  substance  misuse  would  constitute  grounds  for  revocation  of  a
security clearance. (FORM Item 3.)
Applicant did not submit any character references or job-performance evaluations.
Although he told a security investigator that he obtained medical marijuana to treat his
depression,  he  provided  no  evidence  indicating  whether  he  continues  to  suffer  from
depression and, if so, whether he found a legal substitute to treat it.

"Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor involved in technical
sales. He is married with two children, and has a Master’s degree. He has worked for his
employer since 1999, and  is seeking to obtain national security eligibility for a security
clearance in connection with his work with the DoD.
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted allegations 1.a and 1.b under this
paragraph. He denied allegation 1.c.
1.a and 1.b. Applicant used marijuana once or twice a month from approximately
1990,  when  he  was  in  high  school,  until  December  2017,  after  Applicant  received  the
SOR. During that entire period he would purchase marijuana once or twice a year, ending
in  June  or  July  2017.  He  bought  it  from  friends,  and  eventually  from  a  marijuana
dispensary once marijuana purchase and use was made legal in his state. The longest
period Applicant had gone without using marijuana  was six months during the time he
was  in  graduate  school from  1994  to  1996.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  23,  and
Exhibit 2; Tr. 19-25, 30, 36.)
1.c. Applicant denied that he stated in an interview in April 2017 that he intended
to  continue  to  use  marijuana.  Applicant  stated  that  he  would  not  use  marijuana  in  the
future if he received national security eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant testified
that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  after  he  received  the  SOR  in  December  2017,
approximately  five  months  before  the  hearing.  However,  he  indicated  that  he  would
continue marijuana use if he was turned down for national security eligibility, since he saw
nothing wrong with marijuana use. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 31-35, 38.)
Applicant  testified  that  his  employer  has  a  zero-tolerance  policy  for  drug  use,
including  marijuana.  That  policy  has  been  in  effect  the  entire  time  he  worked  there.
Despite his failure to follow his company’s drug use policy, Applicant stated that he was
otherwise  trustworthy  and followed  his  company’s policies  and procedures.  (Tr.  28-29,
36-37, 39-45.)

"Applicant’s admissions to the alcohol, opiate, and mental health-related diagnoses
and  to  his various  treatments  are  accepted  and  incorporated  as  factual findings.  After
considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make additional findings of fact as
follows.
Applicant is a 63-year-old research and development mechanic who has worked for
his defense-contractor employer since January 2003. He has held a secret clearance since
April 2003. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 33.)
Applicant  and  his  spouse  met  in  AA  in  1985  and  married  in  1987.  They  were
separated in 1994 but reconciled in 2004. They have been legally separated since April
2016 because of his drinking. They have a 29-year-old son who lives with Applicant and
has a ten-year-old son of his own. Applicant’s spouse has two grown daughters from a
previous relationship whom Applicant adopted and raised as his own children. (GE 1; Tr.
33-37.)
Applicant began consuming alcohol at age 14. From 1969 until he turned of legal
age to drink in 1973, he drank two beers or a half-bottle of wine monthly with friends. Over
the next decade, he drank 6 to 12 beers twice weekly. In 1984, he began drinking daily,
consuming six beers at a sitting in his home or at bars with friends. In 1985, Applicant
recognized that he was drinking too much. Following completion of an alcohol-rehabilitation
program, he attended AA meetings until 2001 or 2002. He eventually drifted away from AA,
but stayed abstinent from alcohol for some 20 years until 2005. (GE 10; AE A.) He started
drinking periodically on business trips with his co-workers. Before long, he was consuming
alcohol on weekends in quantity of two to three beers or shots of liquor with dinner. He
concealed his drinking from his spouse because  he knew she would disapprove of his
drinking. (GE 2.)
In  2006  or  2007,  Applicant  was  prescribed  a  narcotic  for  pain  from  a  local
orthopedist for a condition misdiagnosed as sciatica. Applicant has variously reported that,
after two to three months of taking his pain medication as prescribed, he began illegally
obtaining  and  using  narcotics  and  OxyContin.  He  reported  illegally  using  Vicodin  on  a
weekly basis for five to six months and OxyContin daily for four months, which he obtained
from friends and associates. (GE 10; AE A.) Medical records from 2009 indicate more
extensive  abuse  of  narcotics  and  opiates.  (GEs  3-4.)  Applicant  acknowledged  at  his
hearing that he abused prescription pain medications (Vicodin and OxyContin) from 2007
to  May  2009  (Tr.  48-49) and  that  he  also  used  heroin  a  few  times  when  he  could  not
illegally obtain OxyContin. (Tr. 51.) Most of the time, he obtained the prescription painkillers
from friends and did not have to pay for the drugs. However, he also testified that he spent
$5,000 to $6,000 for the drugs over the two years he abused them. (Tr. 56-57.)
Applicant  missed  a  couple  of  days  of  work  in  May  2009  because  of  his
polysubstance abuse. On May 18, 2009, Applicant’s spouse brought him to the emergency
department of a local hospital seeking help for his alcohol problem. His blood-alcohol level
tested at .285%. He told medical staff that he had resumed alcohol consumption about five
years ago; that his drinking had gotten out of control in the past few months; and that in the
last three weeks, he had consumed a pint of schnapps per day. He also admitted that he
had  been  abusing  opiates.  Medical  records  indicate  that  he  reported  abusing  opiates
(OxyContin, Fentanyl patches,1 and some heroin) for the past three years to self-medicate
for pain, with his most recent use being on the weekend preceding his presentation in the
emergency department. Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, opioid abuse,
and  alcohol  intoxication,  and  referred  to  a  hospital  specializing  in  mental  health  and
addictions treatment (hospital X) for alcohol-detoxification treatment. (GEs 3-4.)
Applicant  received  voluntary  alcohol-detoxification  and  opioid-detoxification
treatment at hospital X from May 19, 2009, to May 26, 2009. He reported to clinicians that
he began taking prescribed Percocet for pain about two years prior, and that when his
prescription ran out three weeks later, he began obtaining pain medications from friends
1 Applicant asserts that he used a Fentanyl patch only one time. (Tr. 51, 54.) He admitted that he used heroin
when he could not obtain OxyContin and used heroin twice in May 2009. (Tr. 51-52.) Applicant acknowledged
that he had a DOD clearance when he engaged in illegal drug use. (Tr. 55.)
and acquaintances. He reported illegally taking 60 mg. of OxyContin per day since then
with some increase to 80 mg. daily in the last year. Applicant stated that, at times, he used
“half a bundle of heroin per day.”2  He reported using heroin twice, and OxyContin and a
Fentanyl patch once during the May 15-17, 2009 time frame. He stated that he had also
been consuming 1.5 pints of vodka per day for the last two years. Applicant expressed
concern about the possible loss of his job if he continued to drink. Diagnoses on admission
were alcohol withdrawal, alcohol dependence, opioid withdrawal, and opioid dependence.
He appeared motivated to cease his alcohol and opioid abuse, and was safely detoxified
from both substances. He transitioned to the facility’s partial hospitalization program (PHP)
on Suboxone3 and Trazodone with a fair prognosis if he became engaged in outpatient
treatment. (GE 4.)
While at hospital X, Applicant began a therapeutic relationship with a psychiatrist.
She placed Applicant on Suboxone for his opiate abuse, and she had individual counseling
with Applicant weekly to twice weekly in 2009 and then monthly until August 2016, when
she terminated their relationship after finding out that he had been drinking alcohol while
taking  Suboxone.  Applicant  knew  he  was  required  to  abstain  from  alcohol  while  on
Suboxone. (GEs 1, 4, 10; Tr. 59.)
On January 6, 2015, Applicant went to his local emergency department complaining
of leg atrophy and weakness. He acknowledged that he was drinking approximately ten
shots of alcohol per day while taking prescribed Suboxone, but expressed no interest in
alcohol detoxification unless it would help his leg. He was diagnosed with alcohol abuse
and discharged in stable condition, but advised to decrease his alcohol intake. (GE 3.)
On June 11, 2015, Applicant presented at the emergency department with moderate
alcohol abuse. He reported that he had been binge drinking for the past week and wanted
alcohol-detoxification  treatment  at  hospital X.  He  was  discharged  from  the  emergency
department in stable condition. (GE 3.)
Applicant had alcohol-detoxification treatment at hospital X from June 11, 2015, to
June 15, 2015. On admission, he admitted he had been drinking four to nine “nips”4 on the
weekends with an increase over the past week to at least six or more drinks (“shots of
bourbon” and “nips”) per day to intoxication while taking Suboxone. Applicant reported
missing several days of work recently because of his alcohol use, although he had the
leave  to  cover  his  lost  time  and  was  not  reprimanded.  (Tr.  73.)  He  exhibited  some
2 Applicant testified that he was never addicted to heroin. He knew that heroin and OxyContin were both
opiates and he told clinicians that he was buying a bundle of heroin per day because it was a way for him to
get accepted into the Suboxone program. (Tr. 50.)
3 Suboxone is a combination of two narcotics, buprenorphine and naloxone, both partial opiate agonists. It was
approved for the treatment of opioid dependence by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002. According to
studies from the National Institute of Health, people addicted to prescription painkillers reduced their opioid
abuse  when  given  sustained  treatment  with  Suboxone,  which  reduces  withdrawal  symptoms.  See
www.nih.gov.
4 Applicant testified that he drank as many as ten shots per day. Applicant’s “nips” were the small bottles of
liquor containing 1.5 ounces. (Tr. 74-75.)
symptoms  of  alcohol  withdrawal,  including  tremors.  He  reported  that  he  was  actively
involved in AA “as a sponsor,” and he expressed a desire to attend AA meetings on his
discharge. He was discharged in stable condition to continue to take Suboxone and follow
up with his psychiatrist. Diagnoses at discharge included alcohol dependence, continuous,
and opioid dependence, in remission. (GE 4.)
In 2015, Applicant’s psychiatrist closed her private practice for a clinic affiliation.
Applicant began outpatient counseling with a therapist at the clinic in September 2015 for
his diagnosed opioid use disorder, severe, in sustained remission; depressive disorder;
and  alcohol  dependence.  Applicant  reported  abstinence  from  alcohol  and  some
improvement in his depression after being placed on mood stabilizers.  His psychiatrist
continued  to  prescribe  Suboxone  for  his  opioid  use  disorder  and  pain  relief,  and  she
prescribed Campral medication for alcohol cravings. In early January 2016, Applicant told
his psychiatrist that he had thought about drinking a few times, but that he had maintained
sobriety.  Applicant  was  advised  to  attend  AA.  Applicant  reported  during  counseling
sessions in late February 2016 and early May 2016 that he was still not drinking, although
he now acknowledges that he continued to drink alcohol on weekends and hide his alcohol
use from his psychiatrist. (Tr. 64.) His mood was noted as stable on Cymbalta, although he
was stressed about a new home purchase. During a session at the clinic in mid-June 2016,
Applicant reported that he had stopped taking Campral and that family stress had led him
to drink alcohol. He was advised to take Campral, engage in counseling, and attend AA.
His opioid dependence was in remission. (GE 7.)
On July 4, 2016, Applicant began drinking heavily due to chronic pain. Three days
later, Applicant was transported by ambulance to his local emergency room because of
alcohol intoxication. He smelled of alcohol and his speech was slurred. He chose to leave
the hospital against medical advice, and he was discharged to his wife’s custody. (GE 3.)
Applicant was unable to work because of his pain, and he went on short-term disability,
which lasted nine months. (GEs 3, 9; Tr. 47.)
On July 16, 2016, Applicant called his counselor at the outpatient clinic. He was
intoxicated and was told he needed a higher level of care than the clinic could provide. He
was discharged from his outpatient therapy at the clinic on July 20, 2016, but allowed to
remain in medication management with his psychiatrist as long as he sought a higher level
of care. Diagnoses at the time of his discharge from the clinic were opioid dependence, on
antagonist therapy, and alcohol abuse. (GE 7.)
On July 20, 2016, Applicant was transported by his daughter to his local hospital.
He  was  diagnosed  in  the  emergency  department  with  acute  alcohol  intoxication  and
alcoholism. He reported two weeks of heavy drinking and steady drinking of approximately
a liter of vodka per day for the past five days. Urine screens were negative for opiates, but
his blood-alcohol levels were critically high. He had withdrawal symptoms from alcohol,
including  anxiety  and  tremors.  Applicant  was  transferred  to  hospital  X  for  alcohol-
detoxification treatment on July 21, 2016. (GE 3; Tr. 75.)
Applicant  told  staff  at  hospital  X  that  he  had  been  consuming  two  pints  of
peppermint  schnapps  per  day  and  that  his  increased  drinking  was  precipitated  by  an
argument with his wife and their subsequent marital separation. Applicant was diagnosed
with alcohol use disorder, severe. Treatment was attempted with benzodiazepines for a
few hours, but he was tremulous, agitated, and hallucinating. He was transported back to
his local hospital for medical treatment of suspected delirium tremens. (GEs 3-4.)
On July 22, 2016, Applicant was readmitted to hospital X for alcohol-detoxification
treatment. Notes of an attending psychiatrist indicate that Applicant was involved in AA and
was  an  AA  sponsor.  He  was  successfully  detoxified  from  alcohol  using  the  hospital’s
standard protocol. At discharge on July 28, 2016, Applicant was prescribed Suboxone and
urged  to  maintain  sobriety.  Aftercare  plans  included  continuing  with  his  outpatient
counseling at the clinic and medication management with his psychiatrist. (GE 4.) Applicant
stayed sober for ten days only to again relapse into drinking alcohol. (GE 6.)
During a medication-management session with his psychiatrist on August 2, 2016,
Applicant  exhibited  moderate  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depression.  The  psychiatrist
assessed his progress in treatment as minimal, given he had relapsed with alcohol. She
advised  him  to  contact  hospital  X  as  soon  as  possible  about  its  intensive  outpatient
program (IOP). She noted his need for Suboxone to prevent withdrawal and relapse into
opioid dependence, recommended counseling for diagnosed major depressive disorder,
and ended her treatment with him. (GE 7.)
During  the  morning  of  September  6,  2016,  Applicant  was  brought  to  his  local
hospital by his son. Applicant was intoxicated at the time. He reported consuming ten or
more alcohol drinks per day and also feeling that his life was out of control. (Tr. 75.) He
attributed  his  relapse  to  being  discharged  from  his  Suboxone  protocol.  He  went  into
withdrawals that triggered his relapse. He was seen as ambivalent about his sobriety and
lacking insight into his situation. He was transferred to hospital X for alcohol-detoxification
treatment. (GEs 3, 6.)
Applicant was treated at hospital X from September 6, 2016, through September 12,
2016. He reported symptoms of helplessness. His treatment plan addressed symptoms of
anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. On September 13, 2016, he was transferred to
the hospital’s IOP consisting of clinical group therapy five days per week with the goal of
relapse prevention. On admission to the IOP, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder,
severe; unspecified anxiety disorder; and unspecified depressive disorder. While in the
IOP, Applicant was engaged in clinical group therapy, and he admitted that he had stopped
attending AA, which led to his relapse. He expressed a willingness to return to AA and a
desire to remain sober. Over the next few days, he reported no substance use, but he was
considered to be at risk for relapse. On September 15, 2016, Applicant was evaluated by a
physician  for medication  management.  Applicant  denied  any  suicidal ideation, and his
judgment and insight were assessed as fair. He met diagnostic criteria for severe alcohol
use disorder and severe opioid use disorder. The physician recommended that he continue
with the IOP and regular AA meetings. Applicant continued to attend his IOP group-therapy
sessions, showing receptivity to treatment interventions, but also some depression and
anxiety.  He  reported  attending  AA  meetings  and  contacting  his sponsor. He remained
concerned about being at home alone, which was a trigger for his abuse. As of September
29, 2016, he reported attending at least four AA meetings a week. (GE 6.) Despite his
involvement in AA, he was unable to stop drinking. (Tr. 64.)
On October 5, 2016, Applicant was transported by ambulance to his local hospital
for suicidal thoughts and alcohol intoxication. He had been drinking “as much as he could”
over the previous five to six days after his son was involved in a car accident. Applicant
was diagnosed with alcohol abuse and depression. Applicant initially denied he had been
drinking and was belligerent with staff. He was medically cleared for discharge to home
that evening with the recommendation that he continue in his IOP at hospital X. As soon as
Applicant arrived home, he drank alcohol. (GE 3.)
On October 6, 2016, Applicant went to his IOP and reported that he wanted to kill
himself.  He  went  to  his  local  hospital’s  emergency  department  for  a  mental-health
evaluation, which was not conducted at that time because he was not sober. (GE 3; Tr.
62.) Available medical records indicate that Applicant was then treated at hospital X until
October 10, 2016. (GE 6.)
Applicant  resumed  his  participation  in  his  IOP  on  October  11,  2016.  He  was
remorseful about his latest relapse and indicated that he was actively returning to AA. He
was motivated to stay sober but admitted that he struggled on the weekends when alone at
home.  Applicant  reported  significant  issues  with  irritability  and  depression  and  being
overwhelmed by health and financial concerns. (GE 6.)
After drinking heavily for three days, on October 18, 2016, Applicant went to his
local hospital requesting a placement for alcohol detoxification. He did not exhibit any signs
or symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal and was referred to his IOP. (GE 3.) At the
referral of his therapist, Applicant received alcohol-detoxification treatment at a different
hospital from October 19, 2016, to October 25, 2016. He admitted that he drank alcohol on
most Saturdays and exhibited blunted affect with depressed and anxious mood, but he
also appeared committed to sobriety. His judgment and insight were assessed as impaired.
Following  an  uncomplicated  inpatient  detoxification,  he  was  discharged  in  improved
condition with a primary diagnosis of alcohol use disorder with uncomplicated withdrawal;
depressive  disorder,  unspecified;  and  obsessive  compulsive  disorder  trait.  He  was
prescribed  an  anti-depressant,  advised  to  follow-up  in  his  IOP  program,  and  given  a
referral to an inpatient 28-day alcohol-rehabilitation program. (GE 9.)
Instead, Applicant resumed his participation in his IOP. He appeared frustrated by
his  recent  detoxification  stay  and  indicated  that  he  had  declined  the  referral  to  the
rehabilitation facility because of the cost. Applicant testified that he had no guarantee of a
bed. (Tr. 79.) In the IOP, Applicant struggled to accept responsibility for his sobriety. (GE
6.)
On October 31, 2016, Applicant was transported by the local fire department to his
local  hospital’s  emergency  department  for  a  mental  health  evaluation.  Applicant  was
diagnosed with alcohol intoxication, depression, and suicidal ideation. He possessed a gun
and expressed fear that he might kill himself.5 Applicant told medical personnel that he had
been drinking seven to nine alcohol drinks on a daily basis for the last five days. He had a
mental-health assessment on November 1, 2016, and was considered stable for discharge.
He was given a referral to a 28-day inpatient alcohol-rehabilitation program in a distant
state with treatment to be at no cost to him. (GE 3.)
Applicant declined the referral and resumed his participation in hospital X’s IOP on
November 3, 2016. He advised his therapist that he declined residential treatment because
it was too far away, he had bills to pay, and he had to care for his son. Applicant was
depressed, but he had no suicidal thoughts. He expressed an intention to attend an AA
meeting  daily  and  several  AA  meetings  on  the  weekends  to  offset  triggers.  He  was
persuaded to attend a PHP more tailored to substance abuse. (GE 6.)
Applicant reported to the PHP on November 4, 2016, as “clean and safe and sober.”
Similar to his IOP, his treatment plan included attending at least 20 support meetings per
week for treatment of alcohol use disorder, severe, to work on identifying triggers for his
substance  abuse  and  to  learn  coping  skills.  In  addition,  he  received  psychological
education and had psychiatrist appointments as needed with a focus on alcohol recovery,
and  depression  and  anxiety  management.  His  anxiety  was  high  at  times  because  of
external stressors, including a lack of funds. His short-term disability income was less than
his  regular  income,  and  he  was  not  able  to  work  because  of  chronic  knee  pain.  He
appeared motivated for sobriety and remained alcohol and drug-free. All toxicology screens
were negative. He attended AA daily and had a sponsor in AA and was receptive during his
group therapy sessions. Applicant was transferred back to the IOP on November 9, 2016.
On November 23, 2016, he was successfully discharged from the IOP with diagnoses of
alcohol use disorder, severe; unspecified anxiety disorder; and unspecified depressive
disorder (provisional). He reported no longer experiencing anxiety or depression. In the
opinion of his primary therapist, Applicant had demonstrated the ability to use several new
coping  skills.  His  therapist also noted that Applicant’s main source of sobriety was his
“strong connection” with AA. Applicant was discharged with a good prognosis to continue in
aftercare consisting of individual therapy and medications for his anxiety. (GE 5.)
Applicant had an intake session for counseling with an addiction-recovery service on
December  1,  2016,  Applicant  reported  a  history  of  abusing  alcohol  and  prescription
medications;  sobriety  for  20  years  with  the  help  of  AA  after  completing  an  inpatient
program at age 29; but then drinking on and off after going on a “road job” for his employer.
He attributed an increase in his drinking after he was cut off from Suboxone six months
ago. At its worst, he drank 13 to 15 nips every night, but he reported no drinking for the
past 36 days. He admitted that he had spent “thousands” on opiates in the past. He denied
significant  symptoms  of  depression  or  anxiety.  He  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use
disorder,  severe,  and  with  opioid  use  disorder,  severe,  in  early  remission.  Applicant
participated  in  two  individual  therapy  sessions  and  two  group  therapy  sessions  in
5 Applicant now maintains that it was a BB gun. (Tr. 62.) He believes his depression and suicidal ideation were
a product of his heavy drinking. (Tr. 65.) Applicant testified that when he was not working, “there was no
reason not to drink during the day.” (Tr. 76.)
December 2016. Available medical records from the provider reflect that his treatment was
expected to end in June 2017. (GE 8; Tr. 75.)  The last available progress note from the
facility is January 4, 2017. (GE 8.) Applicant testified that he completed the counseling in
June  2017  (Tr. 80),  but  he  also  told  a  clinical  psychologist  during  an  October 8,  2017
evaluation for the DOD that he stopped treatment because his insurance would no longer
pay for his sessions. (GE 2.)
On January 5, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant asserted that he abstained completely
from alcohol from 1985 until 2005, but from 2005 to March 2016, he drank two or three
beers or shots of liquor on the weekends. He hid his alcohol consumption from his wife,
whom he met in AA, and also from his treating psychiatrist because he knew that she
would discontinue his Suboxone medication if he was drinking. He stated that he drank two
to three nips of liquor three times a week after work from March 2016 to April 2016, when
his spouse left him because of his drinking. He then drank daily, although only one to two
nips per day until July 2016 when his drinking increased to six to eight shots of liquor on
the weekends. He claimed he stopped drinking in September 2016 because he started
attending AA, and he denied any intention to drink alcohol in the future. He acknowledged
that he had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent, but also stated that he did not consider
himself to be alcohol dependent. Applicant discussed his recent treatments for his alcohol
use. With regard to the concerns that he was suicidal in October 2016, Applicant denied
that he was suicidal and explained that he had been discouraged because he could not
stop drinking. He was in addictions counseling, and had been going to AA once or twice a
day  since  October  2016.  He  reported  an  intention  to  continue  with  his  addictions
counseling and with AA. (GE 10.)
Regarding his misuse of opiates, Applicant acknowledged that he had illegally used
Vicodin  and  OxyContin,  although  he  indicated that his abuse was limited to five or six
months  for  Vicodin  and  four  months  for  OxyContin  starting  in  2008.  After  receiving
detoxification treatment for five days for diagnosed addiction to opiates, Applicant was
prescribed Suboxone, which he took for the next eight years. Applicant acknowledged that
alcohol was contraindicated with Suboxone, and that after he tested positive for alcohol in
a urine screen in July 2016, his psychiatrist terminated the Suboxone. (GE 10.)
On January 12, 2017, Applicant met with the OPM investigator to provide further
information about his alcohol treatments. He explained that his therapist wanted him to
attend a long-term recovery program, but he chose to be treated at a more local hospital
for detoxification in October 2016. As for his previous claim that he had stopped drinking in
September 2016, he stated that his therapist told him that he had to drink in order to be
admitted, and so he consumed six nips before his admission for treatment in mid-October
2016. (GEs 9-10.)
Applicant remained abstinent from alcohol while attending about nine AA meetings a
week. He had surgery in January 2017, which proved effective in alleviating his chronic
pain. He took prescribed painkillers after his surgery with no misuse of prescription drugs.
(Tr. 47.) He returned to work from disability in April 2017 (AE A; Tr. 46), but mounting
10
financial issues,6 including federal and state tax delinquencies (Tr. 81), and problems with
his son led Applicant to feel depressed and overwhelmed. His son was abusing illegal
drugs  (including  crack  cocaine  and  heroin),  taking  his  money,  and  intimidating  him.
Applicant turned to alcohol to cope in June 2017. He consumed four to five nips of whiskey
the first day followed by daily drinking of as much as a pint of liquor. After three weeks of
heavy drinking, he called his spouse in early July 2017, and she took him to the hospital.
He was transferred to hospital X where he received inpatient treatment from July 7, 2017,
to July 14, 2017, for major depressive disorder, alcohol withdrawal, alcohol dependence,
and  suicidal  ideation.7  He  was  on  suicide  watch  briefly,  but  he  asserts  that  he  only
expressed suicidal ideation at his spouse’s suggestion to ensure that he would be admitted
for alcohol treatment. (GE 2; Tr. 81-83.) Applicant now believes that his depression and
suicidal ideation were a product of his heavy drinking. (Tr. 65.) Applicant was discharged to
the  hospital’s  IOP  where  he  attended  counseling  three  nights  per  week  for  about  five
weeks. (GE 2.)
During Applicant’s inpatient stay at hospital X, his counselor filed a report of elder
abuse about his son’s behavior. The state’s child protective services became involved
because Applicant’s son has physical custody of his ten-year-old child four days a week. It
motivated Applicant’s son to become involved in treatment himself. As of November 2018,
Applicant’s son was attending an IOP, reportedly no longer abusing drugs, and employed
at a donut shop. (Tr. 38-43.)
On  September  9,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire  for National Security Positions (SF 86). Applicant disclosed that he had
received mental-health treatment for an estimated eight months in 2008. In response to an
inquiry concerning whether he had ever been hospitalized for a mental-health condition,
Applicant reported that he had undergone voluntary treatment for five days in July 2016 for
alcohol  detoxification  and  for  seven  days  in  July  2017  for  alcohol  detoxification  and
depression at hospital X. He also responded affirmatively to whether he had misused any
prescription drug in the last seven years, but then disclosed that he misused OxyContin
and  Vicodin  from  January  2008  to  May  2008,  more  than  seven  years  ago.  Applicant
answered “Yes” to an inquiry concerning whether his use of alcohol has had a negative
impact on his work performance, professional or personal relationships, or finances in the
last seven years. He reported that his drinking between March 2015 and May 2015 led him
to miss work. He listed three alcohol-related treatments: his outpatient therapy at the clinic
in 2015 and voluntary alcohol treatments at hospital X in May 2015 and July 2017. (GE 1.)
At the request of the DOD, Applicant was evaluated on October 8, 2017, by a duly-
qualified licensed psychologist. Applicant indicated that he was again living with his son
and grandson, who was no longer using drugs and was employed. Applicant discussed
6 Applicant’s disability benefit ran out after six months (Tr. 47), and he began to rely on credit cards to pay bills.
He resolved most of his financial stress by a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge granted in October 2017. (AE A;
Tr. 89.)
7 The medical records from this admission were not presented in evidence. Applicant provided a copy of the
records to the psychologist, who evaluated him for the DOD in October 2017.
11
with the psychologist his misuse of opiates obtained from friends and associates in the
past to self-medicate for pain. He denied ever using heroin, although he indicated that he
voluntarily sought Suboxone treatment because he was concerned that his opiate use
would progress to heroin. He reported taking Suboxone for about six years before being
discharged for using alcohol. He denied any misuse of opiate pain medication since 2005.
Applicant reported experiencing depression and suicide ideation in the past, but only when
he was drinking alcohol and facing a number of stressors. He reported that he was taking
medications for depression and sleep prescribed during his recent hospitalization in July
2017, but also that he did not see any benefit to  the medications and planned to stop
taking them. Applicant denied any consumption of alcohol since July 6, 2017, and  any
desire to drink alcohol. He was attending seven AA meetings per week, working the steps
with his sponsor, and felt that AA had saved his life. Applicant expressed confidence that, if
he continued working with AA, he would be fine. (GE 2.)
The  clinical  psychologist  assessed  Applicant’s  optimism  about  his  sobriety  as
“somewhat excessive at this point considering his relapses despite being involved in AA in
the past and his relatively short period of sobriety.” He diagnosed Applicant with alcohol
use disorder, severe, in early remission, and with a history of adjustment disorder with
depressed  mood.  Symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depression  were  only  present  within  the
context of Applicant’s excessive alcohol use or in the face of significant life stressors. The
psychologist considered alcohol abuse a significant concern due to Applicant’s long period
of difficulties and his repeated relapses. He opined that Applicant’s alcohol use disorder,
severe, is a condition that would negatively impact his reliability, judgment, stability, and
trustworthiness.  He  noted  that  Applicant  had  an  appointment  to  restart  addictions
counseling, but that Applicant appeared ambivalent about restarting psychotherapy. While
Applicant appeared strongly invested in AA, the psychologist recommended that Applicant
also have treatment and monitoring by professionals, such as in outpatient psychotherapy.
The psychologist gave Applicant a guarded prognosis due to his brief period of sobriety
(since July 6, 2017), his repeated relapses in the past, and his lack of recent consistent
engagement in treatment. In Applicant’s favor, the psychologist cited his lengthy sobriety of
some 20 years in the past; his AA involvement with a supportive sponsor; his resolution of
a number of stressors by recently filing for bankruptcy and filing a complaint of elder abuse
against his son; and his recent outreach for help when needed. The psychologist did not
consider Applicant’s drug abuse to be a recent or current problem, given that drug screens
during recent hospitalizations have been consistently negative. (GE 2.)
Applicant stopped taking his prescribed anti-depressant and sleep medications a
couple  of  months  after  he  regained  his  sobriety  and  resumed  his  affiliation  with  AA
following his July 2017 treatment. He did not feel that he needed them. (Tr. 67.) He also
did not keep the appointment for addictions counseling. (Tr. 84.)
Applicant does not allow alcohol or illegal drugs in his home. (Tr. 64, 89.) He has not
consumed  any  alcohol  since  July  2017  (Tr.  71),  and  he  does  not  believe  that  he  will
relapse if his son relapses. (Tr. 78.) He denies ever reporting to work drunk or ever drinking
at work. (Tr. 74.) Available medical records show that he may have been hungover at work
in the past (GE 2), but he was never reprimanded. (Tr.73.)
Applicant describes himself as “a recovering—recovered alcoholic.” He attributes his
past substance abuse to an incorrect diagnosis of a physical condition which resulted in
chronic pain that undermined his attempts at sobriety. As of November 2018, Applicant
was still attending seven AA meetings a week. Applicant has been an AA sponsor for about
ten months as of November 2018. He sponsors four AA attendees in his home group. In
March 2018, he started a Saturday night “Big Book” meeting. He supports alcoholics in
local sober-house programs by driving several men to area AA meetings multiple times per
week.  Applicant  has  attended  two  weekend  retreats  and  is  involved  in  a  group  that
emphasizes the 12-step recovery program. He has worked all 12 steps of the AA program.
He has had his current sponsor since August or September 2017. His sponsor has 12
years of sobriety. (AE A; Tr. 85-99.)
Applicant  was  not  currently  in  any  formal  counseling  or  psychotherapy  as  of
November 2018. (Tr. 88.) He does not believe that he currently needs any psychotherapy
and  explained  that  it  never  worked  for  him.  (Tr.  93.)  When  asked  to  explain  why  he
believes AA is now sufficient to guarantee against relapse given his relapse history, which
includes  relapse  after  20  years  of  sobriety  with  AA  involvement  for  most  of  that  time,
Applicant  responded  that  he  was  working  the  steps,  sponsoring  people,  attending
meetings, and “doing the work that [he] wasn’t doing at the end of that last 20 years.” In the
past, he got caught up with work and did not think that he needed AA anymore. (Tr. 101-
102.)
Applicant’s AA sponsor provided a character reference letter attesting to Applicant’s
initial struggles in recovery from his alcohol problem. He agreed to become Applicant’s
sponsor without reservations because Applicant demonstrated to him willingness to change
his  life.  He  corroborates  that  Applicant  has  been  very  active  in  his  local  recovery
community  by  sponsoring  others  struggling  with  addiction  and  by  starting  a  Saturday
evening AA meeting attended by 30 to 40 people. In the sponsor’s opinion, Applicant has
“always been a person with integrity, honesty, and morals as a driving force in his life.” The
sponsor has “the highest respect” for Applicant. (AE B.)

"Applicant  is  33  years  old,  unmarried,  and  has  no  children.  He  received  a  high
school diploma in 2004 in Iraq. From 2005 until October 2009, Applicant worked for the
U.S. military in Iraq as a security guard and as a local interpreter on U.S. military missions.
He immigrated to the United States in November 2009 on a special immigrant visa (SVI),
and he was naturalized in November 2015. He is attempting to get a job as a linguist for
a defense contractor. This is his first security clearance application. He has worked as a

Guideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant disclosed in his 2017 SCA that he used marijuana between August 2012
and  February  2016.  In  June  2012,  while  living  in  a  state  in  which  it  was  legal  to  use
medical  marijuana,  Applicant  broke  his  leg.  Two  months  later,  he  obtained  a  medical
marijuana card and started using marijuana as pain relief for the broken leg. He did not
renew the card when it expired in August 2013, but continued to use marijuana once a
month or every other month with friends and by himself for medical and personal reasons.
In his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana only three to five times after his
leg healed. He told the government investigator during his May 1, 2017 interview that he
used marijuana one to two times a week for three months in 2012 to help him sleep. (GE
1 at 59; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; Tr. 22-23, 25-26, 30-33)
In  2014,  Applicant  obtained  a  commercial  driver’s  license  (CDL)  from  the
Department of Transportation (DOT) to be a commercial truck driver. Applicant started
working for Company A as a commercial truck driver in August 2014. This company drug
screened  their  drivers  and  marijuana  use  was  not  permitted.  Applicant  had  a  pre-
employment urinalysis and one random urinalysis before he left Company A in May 2015.
Applicant continued working as a commercial driver for two other companies. For these
employments, he had pre-employment urinalyses tests.
In  February  2016,  Applicant  was  working  as  a  truck  driver  for  a  company  that
prohibited the use of drugs. He acknowledged that he was aware of his employer’s policy
that  employees  remain  drug-free,  and  he  was  subject  to  random  urinalysis  tests.
However, Applicant thought the policy only applied to when he was working, not during
off hours or “private time.” That month, Applicant took a random-work-related urinalysis,
which was positive for marijuana. At the hearing, Applicant testified that the last time he
used marijuana was approximately one week before this positive urinalysis. (GE 1 at 61;
Tr. 23-27)
Later during his testimony, Applicant claimed the positive urinalysis was the result
of exposure to second-hand smoke at a concert or from innocent ingestion. (Tr. 24, 26)
He also made this claim in his Answer to the SOR and in his May 1, 2017 background
interview. He also testified that he did not knowingly use marijuana after he received  a
CDL in 2014, because he knew it was forbidden by the DOT to use drugs and hold a CDL.
(Answer; GE 2 at 5; Tr. 26-29, 33-35)
The following colloquy occurred during the hearing:
Mr. Nagel: And you violated that rule?
Applicant: Well, not – I didn’t use marijuana on the job.
Mr. Nagel: Right.
Applicant: I used it as like, in my time off. But, I didn’t know that it stays in
the body for that long. And in that case – and that won’t actually – I didn’t
even use it. I think I had a second-hand smoke. I’m not sure about it, but….
(Tr. 24)
As a result of the positive urinalysis, Applicant was sent to drug treatment, but he
was ultimately released  by the employer. (GE 2 at 2-4; GE 3 at 1-2; AE B; Tr. 25, 35)
According to Applicant, February 2016 was the last time he was around people who were
using  marijuana.  (Tr.  23-25,  38)  His  last  drug  test  was  in  January  2018,  and  it  was
negative. (Tr. 37)
Guideline D: Sexual Behavior
In September 2011 Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with  forcible
rape in the second degree, a felony. He was handcuffed and taken to the police station,
fingerprinted,  and  photographed.  He  spent  four  days  in  jail;  met  the  $75,000  bail;  and
then consulted with an attorney. At the hearing, Applicant claimed the attorney told him
he  did  not  need  to  hire  anyone  to  represent  him.  He  testified  that  he  knew  he  was
arrested,  but  he  thought  he  was  just  accused,  not  charged,  which  is  why  he  did  not
disclose  the  arrest  in his SCA.  The  case  was  closed,  and  the  charges  were  ultimately
dismissed. (GE 1 at 58-59; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 1-2; AE A; Tr. 44-50)
In  August  2011  Applicant  had  sex  with  a  women  he  met  through  a  dating
application. She told the police that their first interaction began as consensual; however,
she  requested that  Applicant  wear a  condom, he  refused  her request, their  interaction
then  became  non-consensual,  and  he  forcibly  had  vaginal/penile  intercourse  with  her.
Applicant told the police interviewer in September 2011 that the woman asked him to use
a condom, and he complied with her request. At the hearing, Applicant claimed he asked
the woman for a condom, which was inconsistent with his earlier version of events. (GE
2 at 7; GE 4; GE 5 at 12; Tr. at 40-45)
Applicant testified that they had sex one time, and it was consensual. The woman
told the police and gave a detailed description of how Applicant raped her a second time,
in late August 2011. Applicant forced his way into her apartment and then forced himself
on her again. The next day, she reported the rapes to the police. (GE 4; Tr. 45-46)
Applicant obtained copies of all of the police paperwork in 2014 before he applied
for his U.S. citizenship. In his Answer to the SOR, he denied that this was a felony charge,
but the documentary evidence reflects that he was charged with a felony. (Answer; GE 5;
AE A; Tr. 44, 50-51)
Guideline E: Personal Conduct
Despite obtaining a copy of the arrest record, as stated above, Applicant claimed
at the hearing and in his Answer that he was unaware that he was charged with felony-
level  rape.  In  his  April  2017  SCA,  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  that  he  was  arrested  in
September 2011, and charged with forcible rape, a felony. He did disclose that he used
marijuana  between  August  2012  and  February  2016  due  to  a  broken  leg.  Applicant
understood that when he signed the SCA, he certified that the information he provided
was correct. (Answer; GE 1 at 59-61; Tr. 53)
At the hearing, Applicant claimed he did not know he was actually charged with a
crime. When  he  was  questioned  as to  why  he  did  not  list  the  arrest  as  required  in  his
SCA, he claimed he disclosed the arrest in an earlier SCA. At the hearing, he provided a
February  28,  2017  “review  copy” of an SCA,  which  was  unsigned. In  the  review  copy,
Applicant  disclosed  the  rape  arrest  and  derogatory  gambling  information.  He  did  not
disclose the  gambling information  and  rape arrest  in  the  April 2017  SCA.1  There  is no
evidence that Applicant provided the review copy SCA to his employer or facility security
officer. (GE 1; AE D at 36, 39; Tr. 47-50, 54-63, 69-70)
Applicant also asserted at the hearing that an employee of his sponsor may have
modified his SCA before it was submitted to the government. Finally, Applicant admitted
that he was concerned that if he disclosed the rape arrest in his SCA, it might prohibit him
from being hired as an interpreter. (AE D; Tr. at 54-63, 69-70)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator on May 1, 2017 and by a
U.S. Army investigator in late May 2017. He disclosed the arrest in both interviews. (GE
2 at 4-5; GE 3 at 1-2; Tr. 56) During his second interview, Applicant stated that he thought
he disclosed the rape arrest in his SCA. (GE 3 at 10; Tr. 55-57, 64)
Applicant applied for a security clearance because he loved working with the U.S.
Army in Iraq. (Tr. 52, 67) He provided several documents relating to his valued work with
the U.S. Army in Iraq. (AE C)
1 Applicant disclosed in the February 2017 review copy of a SCA that from November 2015 to present he
had incurred $17,000 in gambling losses. “As of now I have close to 35000 [sic] in debt , [sic] but its [sic]
not  all  because  of  gambling.  I  still  make  payments  on  time  each  month  ,  [sic]  and  I  100%  on  [sic]  time
payments. But if i [sic] did not gamble , [sic] I could have paid all my debt long time ago. I have take  [sic]
action to stop gambling such as not keeping cash with me all of the time ,  [sic] and I have told some friends
about my gambling problem so they can keep me going on the right path of not gambling. And for now I  do
not gamble as much as before ,  [sic] and one of the reasons that I’m seeking overseas job is because I
want to stay as far as I can from any gambling.” (AE D at 39)

"Applicant’s  admissions  are  included  in  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough
review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings
of  fact.  Applicant  is  59  years  old.  She  graduated  from  high  school.  She  received  an
associate’s  degree  in  May  1982.  She  has  taken  some  college  courses  but  has  not
received  a  degree.  She  has  received  computer-based  certifications.  Applicant  first
married  in  December  1978  and  divorced  in  June  1981.  She  married  a  second  time  in
June 1981 and divorced in June 1989. She married a third time in September 1990 and
divorced in June 2005. She has one child from her third marriage. Applicant has worked
supporting  various  companies  and  defense  contractors  as  a  project  manager  or
director. Her hobby is to do bead work on dresses. (Tr. 16-22; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated

dated  March  23,  2018;  AE  A,  Resume,  undated;  AE  B,  Transcript,  dated  August  24,
2015)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from
about 1980 through at least September 2017 (SOR 1.a); and used marijuana after being
granted a DOD security clearance in June 2014 (SOR 1.b).
Applicant  received  her  first  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  while
supporting  a  United  States  Army  command  in  2009.  Her  clearance  was  renewed  in
June 2014. (Tr. 27-30)
Applicant  first  used  marijuana  in  1982  when  she  was  23  years  old.  She  was
dating  her future  second  husband  who  was  a  marijuana user.  He asked her  to  try  the
drug  and  she  did.  There  was  occasional  use,  about  once  or  twice  a  year,  in  the
following  eight  or  nine  years  she  was  married  to  her  second  husband.  After  they
divorced in 1989, she did not use marijuana again until 2014. She characterized her use
as infrequent. (Tr. 30-33; 43-44)
Applicant did not use marijuana when married to her third husband from 1990 to
2005. Applicant had a significant other living with her from 2009 until 2014. During this
time,  she  used  marijuana  once  or  twice.  Her  significant  other,  who  was  a  heavy
marijuana  user,  smoked  the  drug  in  her  presence.  While  she  used  marijuana  only
infrequently, she believes she inhaled marijuana from the second-hand smoke from her
significant other. (Tr. 33-34, 44, 53-55)
In  2014,  Applicant  had  a  friend  visiting  her  who  had  not  previously  used
marijuana. She suggested to the visiting friend that they use the marijuana left over from
her significant other. Applicant and her friend smoked the marijuana once using a pipe.
She used the drug voluntarily. She told her security office about this use of marijuana a
few months later when she had a periodic review for her security clearance. (Tr. 33-37,
44-45)
On Labor Day weekend in 2017, Applicant was visiting a friend in a state where
marijuana is legal. She attended a party with her friend and tried a piece of candy laced
with  marijuana.  A  significant  number  of  people  attending  the  party  were  using  the
candy. Applicant’s friend did not force her to use the marijuana candy, and Applicant did
not buy the marijuana candy. The individual is still Applicant’s friend, but Applicant now
stays  with  her  brother  and  his  family  when  she  visits  the  state.  Her  brother  is  not  a
marijuana user. (Tr. 37-38)
Applicant  knew  the  candy  had  marijuana  in  it,  She  knew  she  had  a  security
clearance  at  the  time.  From  2009,  she  knew  that  the  use  of  marijuana  was  against
security rules and regulations. She characterized her use of the marijuana candy as bad
judgment  on  her  part.  She  used  the  marijuana  candy  because  she  was  in  an
environment  where  the  rules  were  different  and  marijuana  was  legal.  The  people  she
knew  at  the  party  were  using  marijuana  because  it  was  legal.  She  did  it  as  an
experiment  to  gain  knowledge  of  the  effects  of  the  marijuana  candy.  Her  security
clearance was an issue and she knew she had to report her use to her security officer
when she returned. (Tr. 38-40; 45-47. 49-50)
Applicant reported her use of the marijuana candy to her security  officer on her
return from  the  trip. She has  never  taken  a drug  test  with  her  company. Her  company
was in the middle of a review of security clearances for their employees. If the company
had not been involved in the review process, Applicant would have reported her use of
marijuana  candy  at  her  next  security  review.  The  security  personnel  would  not  have
known about her use of marijuana if she did not report it herself. (Tr. 40-43, 50-53)
Applicant  presented  four  affidavits  of  recommendation  for  granting  her  eligibility
for  access  to  classified  information  from  friends,  fellow  workers,  and  her  security
manager. The writers attest to her dedication, work ethic, knowledge and excellent work
performance. They did not believe the allegations reflect Applicant’s character, respect
for law and rules, or willingness and ability to protect classified information. They found
Applicant to be responsible and trustworthy. (AE C)
Applicant also submitted her statement of intent not to use illegal substances or
abuse prescription drugs in the future. She agrees to be randomly drug tested. If a drug
test  is  positive,  she  agrees  to  immediate  and  unqualified  revocation  of  her  security
clearance. (AE D)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  limited  comments  all  of  the
factual  allegations  pertaining  to  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse  of  the  SOR
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.i.); and alcohol consumption of the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 2.a. through
2.c.), but his comments related to the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct
(SOR  ¶¶  3.a.  through  3.c.)  were  not  responsive,  for  he  failed  to  specifically  “admit”  or
“deny”  those  allegations.  Instead,  he  admitted  the  general  conclusory  introduction  to
those  allegations.  Accordingly,  due  to  the  uncertainty  of  Applicant’s  intentions  with
respect to the personal conduct allegations, and the Government’s failure to follow up on
them, I have registered a denial to the three factual allegations. Applicant’s admissions
and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  welder  with  his  current  employer  since  May  2015.  A  2010  high  school  graduate,
Applicant received college credits over a four-year period, but did not earn a degree. He
has never served with the U.S. military. He was granted a security clearance in January
2016. Applicant has never been married, and he has no children.
Drug  Involvement  and  Substance  Misuse,  Alcohol  Consumption,  and  Personal
Conduct
Applicant was a substance abuser whose substances of choice were marijuana,
Adderall®,1  Suboxone,2  and  alcohol.  A  prescription  is  required  for  both  Adderall®  and
Suboxone.
Applicant started smoking marijuana (3-4 puffs of a marijuana joint) and drinking
beer (6-8 Miller Light) on a daily basis after he broke his ankle while skateboarding when
he  was  14-years  old,  for  they  helped  him  with  the  pain.  After  his  ankle  healed,  he
continued his daily use of those two substances, essentially to relax. During an interview
with  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  October
2017, Applicant denied that he had a problem with either substance. He said that he did
not plan on stopping his usage as he had already scaled back his use of marijuana to 2-
3  times  per  month  (actually  transitioning  from  using  marijuana  joints  to  vaping  with
marijuana oil in June 2017), and his beer consumption to one six-pack every 1-2 weeks,
although  he  acknowledged  that  he  consumes  alcohol  to  the  point  of  intoxication
approximately  three  times  per  year  at  family  and  social  gatherings.  Furthermore,  he
claimed  he  shows  up  to  work  on  time,  and  it  does  not  affect  his  various  family
responsibilities.3
The  marijuana  leaf  for  the  joints  that  Applicant  initially  obtained  was  purchased
from someone who would meet him at Applicant’s home. The cost was not revealed. The
marijuana oil that Applicant now uses costs about $40 per vial, and he purchases it at
various outlets and through a cell phone app.4
Applicant  denied  that  his  use  of  marijuana  or  alcohol  have  contributed  to  any
financial,  criminal,  employment,  or security  problems.5  Applicant’s denial  is inaccurate,
and not based on fact.
Applicant was employed as a welder by one federal contractor from October 2010
until May 2015, during which time he was still using marijuana on a daily basis with work
colleagues  in  the  parking  lot,  and  consuming  beer  before  going  to  work  on  various
occasions. On February 27, 2015, Applicant was administered a random urinalysis and
breathalyzer test for alcohol and drugs. He tested positive for marijuana and failed the

breathalyzer  test  for  alcohol.6  He  was  immediately  suspended  under  the  collective
bargaining  agreement,  and  referred  to  the  company’s  Employee  Assistance  Program
(EAP). While in the EAP, he again tested positive for marijuana and failed a breathalyzer
test. As a direct result of his substance abuse under the collective bargaining agreement,
on  April  14,  2015,  Applicant’s  employment  was  terminated.7  In  his  e-QIP,  Applicant
reported that he had left voluntarily by mutual agreement after failing his urinalysis and
breathalyzer tests.8
On May 29, 2016, Applicant exited a parking lot without slowing down or stopping
at the stop sign. A police traffic stop was made and the officer smelled alcohol coming
from  the  vehicle.  There  was  an  open  cold  case  of  beer  observed.  After  questioning
Applicant and determining that he had consumed “a couple at lunch,” and that there were
illegal drugs in the vehicle, the officer conducted a search of the vehicle. The officer found
an open cold can of beer, two glass marijuana smoking devices with marijuana residue,
a plastic container with two grams of marijuana in it, and two prescription bottles without
the proper markings containing Adderall® and Suboxone. Applicant falsely stated to the
officer that he had prescriptions for both medications,9 and in his March 5, 2018 response
to  the  interrogatories,  he  acknowledged  that  in  the  last  three  years  before  the
interrogatories, he had never been prescribed any opioid or Adderall®.10 He was charged
with  possession  of  marijuana,  1st  offense;  possession  of  paraphenalia  –  not  syringes;
prescription violation; and open container.11 On August 12, 2016, the prosecutor moved
for  “nolle  prosequi”  on  the  open  container  and  marijuana  charges.12  The  result  of  the
remaining charges was not reported.
Although Applicant initially told the OPM investigator in October 2017 that he did
not plan on stopping his usage of marijuana as he had already scaled back such use, in
his November 2018 Answer to the SOR, he altered his response to say that he “will not
use  marijuana  anymore.”13  Applicant  admitted  that  his  most  recent  use  of  marijuana
occurred during the first week of October 2017, when he used a marijuana vaping device

his October 2017 interview, when he consumed two beers.15
Although  Applicant  reported  in  his  e-QIP  that  he  had  attended  EAP-referred
“treatment” with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for one month in 2015,16 Applicant told the
OPM investigator that he has never sought counseling or treatment as a result of his use
of alcohol or any other substance, and he has never been professionally diagnosed as
abusing alcohol, being alcohol dependent, abusing drugs, or being drug dependent.17 His
participation in the EAP program was a failure because of his positive urinalysis and his
failed breathalyzer test.
Personal Conduct
On  May  28,  2015,  when  Applicant  completed  his  e-QIP,  he  responded  to  a
question pertaining to the illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23: if, in the
last seven years, he had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances by injecting,
snorting,  inhaling,  swallowing,  experimenting  with  or otherwise  consuming  any  drug  or
controlled substance? Applicant responded that he had tried marijuana in high school and
then again one night in March 2015, while partying with friends. He added that he was
now more responsible and needed to be gainfully employed. Applicant certified that his
response was “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief.18 In
fact, his answer was deliberately false and incomplete, because he concealed both his
true history of marijuana abuse and his declared future intentions, all as set forth above.
Based on his response, a security clearance was given to him in January 2016.
When he was questioned by the OPM investigator in in October 2017, Applicant
candidly admitted that he did not disclose his full history of marijuana use because he did
not want to lose his job, and he also admitted that he was not candid during an earlier
OPM interview – an unalleged act of conduct in the SOR – because he was scared and
did not want to lose his security clearance because he would also lose his job.19

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e.
He denied the allegation in ¶ 1.f. His admissions are incorporated into these findings.
Applicant is 27 years old and recently engaged. After graduating from high school
in 2009, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served on active duty for four years and in the
Army Reserve for one year, until 2014, when he was honorably discharged as an E-4.
While serving, he deployed to the Middle East from July 2012 to April 2013. He received
a Purple Heart, a Good Conduct Medal, and an Army Commendation Medal during his
service. He was granted a Top Secret security clearance in 2009 after entering the Army.
After leaving the Army, he attended college fulltime from 2013 to 2014. (Tr. 15-18, 21, 23)
After  college,  Applicant  worked  in  private  industry.  In  May  2015,  he  started  his
current position with a defense contractor. His performance evaluations have been good
and  resulted  in  merit  pay  increases.  His  fiancé  is  aware  of  this  proceeding  and  the
underlying security concerns. (Tr. 18-20)
In April 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). In it, he
disclosed  that  he  had  used  marijuana  and  cocaine.  (GE  2)  During  an  investigative
interview in October 2016, he discussed more fully his illegal drug use. While testifying
he stated that he used marijuana less than five times prior to joining the Army in 2009.
While on active duty, he used marijuana once in September 2012 after he was injured
and lost two friends in combat. (Tr. 21-23; GE 4)
After  leaving  military  service,  Applicant  started  working  as  an  electrician  for  a
private company for about 18 months. Between November 2014 and January 2015, he
used marijuana about 15 times and then stopped. (Tr. 22)
Applicant used cocaine for the first time in May 2012 while he was in Italy and prior
to deployment. He was with other soldiers at the time. He then used cocaine between five
and ten times while deployed to the Middle East. He was a machine gunner and ingested
it to stay awake during long combat missions. He obtained the drugs from a local citizen.
(Tr. 25-26)
While in the Middle East, Applicant also purchased and used anabolic steroids for
one month.  He  has not  used  any  other  illegal  substances and has  no  intention  to use
them in the future. (Tr. 30, 43)
Applicant  denied  that  he  used  cocaine  after  submitting  his  April  2015  SCA,
although he stated that he had during his interview. He said that he was confused about
dates of his usage, but was certain that he did not use illegal substances months before
starting his current job in April 2015. (Tr. 29-29)
Applicant has changed his life since leaving military service. He is engaged and
purchased a home. He no longer associates with people who use drugs. He spends time
with  his  family  and  is  involved  in  community  outreach  programs.  He  has  never  tested
positive for drugs. (Tr. 30-31)
Applicant explained that he also used cocaine to help medicate his post-traumatic
stress  disorder  (PTSD)  that  he  began  suffering  during  service.  After  returning  to  the
United States from his deployment, he saw a therapist once in 2013. In 2014, he started
attending a group for veterans who have PTSD that met on his college campus. He went
to the group weekly for two months. He stopped when he left college. In February 2016,
he started seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed an antidepressant for PTSD. He took the
medication for about eight months and then stopped. In October 2017, he saw his primary
care  physician  who  recommended  that  he  resume  taking  an  antidepressant,  which  he
has  been  doing.  He  also  stays  in  contact  with  a  person  he  met  at  the  group  therapy
meetings for support. (Tr. 32-40)

The arresting officers noted that they saw a passenger in Applicant’s car pass him
a joint of marijuana, and Applicant admitted that he used marijuana while operating his
vehicle. They detected a strong odor of marijuana when they approached Applicant’s car.
The  officers  found  several  discarded  marijuana  roaches,  a  burning  marijuana  joint,
multiple  baggies  of  marijuana,  and  other  drug-related  paraphernalia  in  Applicant’s  car.
The two other individuals in the car were also arrested, and one admitted to the arresting
officers that he had recently been arrested for selling marijuana. (Item 6)
In his PSI, Applicant claimed two individuals paid him to give them a ride in his car.
When the police searched his car they found a bag of marijuana, it did not belong to him,
but he was aware it was in his vehicle. The charges against Applicant were dropped after
the presiding judge determined that the search and seizure during the arrest was illegal.
(Item 4 at 15-16)
Applicant did not disclose his history of using and purchasing marijuana in his June
2016 SCA. (Item 3 at 35) During his September 2017 PSI, Applicant told the government
investigator that he purchased and smoked three to five joints of marijuana a week from
September 2010 until May 2016. He did not list this information on his SCA, because he
was concerned he would lose his job. Additionally, he told the investigator that he does
not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Item 4 at 16-17)

"Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
defense  contractors  since  2010.  She  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance,  which  she
has held since 2011. She has a bachelor’s degree, which was awarded in 2014, and a
master’s degree, which was awarded in 2009. She is married with an infant child.1
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  about  five  to  seven  times  from  2001  to  2008.  She
was in college and graduate school at the time. She reported her marijuana use on the
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) she submitted in September 2010.
During  her  background  interview  in  October  2010,  she  stated  that  she  regretted  using
marijuana  and  she  did  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  or  any  other  illegal  drug  in  the
future.2
Applicant had surgery in 2013. She was in considerable pain and was prescribed
narcotic  painkillers.  She  had  side  effects  from  the  narcotics,  including  constipation,
headaches,  vomiting,  and  a  “fuzzy”  head.  She  had  another  surgery  in  October  2015.
She  was  again  prescribed  opioid  painkillers.  She  completed  the  course  of  narcotics
prescribed  to  her,  but  she  was  still  in  a  great  deal  of  pain.  A  friend  offered  her  some
marijuana  for  her  pain.  Applicant  lives  in  a  jurisdiction  that  permitted  medical  and
recreational marijuana use. She chose to accept the marijuana from the friend because
she  received  it  immediately  without  having  to  wait  for  it  to  be  prescribed  by  a  doctor.
Applicant used the marijuana over the course of a few weeks to alleviate her pain.3
Applicant  knew  that  her  marijuana  use  was  against  federal  law  and  contrary  to
her company’s and DOD’s policies, even though it was not illegal in her jurisdiction and
even  if  it  had  been  prescribed  by  a  doctor.  However,  she  did  not  realize  the  full
ramifications of her actions.4
Applicant  reported  her  marijuana  use  on  the  SF  86  she  submitted  in  February
2016 and during her background interview in September 2017. She provided a signed
statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug use with the acknowledgment that any
future  involvement  with  illegal  drugs  would  be  grounds  for  revocation  of  her  security
clearance.  She  credibly  testified  that  she  will  not  use  any  illegal  drugs,  including
marijuana for pain management, in the future.5

reports no children and no military service. Applicant has not previously held a security
clearance. (Tr. 43)
On May 5, 2017, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), and
in section 23 (illegal use of drugs or drug activity) he responded “yes” to questions about
illegal  drug  use  and/or  misuse  of  prescription  drugs  within  the  last  seven  years.  He
estimated his use of marijuana MJ was from 2001 with varying frequency and his last use
was  in  2017.2  He  also  disclosed  that  he  used  LSD  once  in  2016,  and  hallucinogenic
mushrooms twice, in 2010 and 2015.3 He indicated that his spiritual and soul-searching
experiences  are  over  and  he  does  not  intend  to  use  any  controlled  substances  in  the
future. He also signed a statement promising to abstain from future use of illegal drugs
and medicinal MJ and acknowledging any future use would be grounds for revocation of
his national security eligibility. (AE A, attachment 1; Tr. 15)
Applicant  was  forced  to  take  medical  leave  from  college  in  2010  due  to  a
devastating disease diagnosis. (Tr. 22) He required extensive surgery, removal of a large

Applicant described himself as a socially awkward youth. He smoked marijuana
socially every couple of weeks during high school (HS) due to peer pressure. However,

he stopped using it early in HS when his mother caught him in 2003. He resumed using
MJ in college, but never purchased MJ or sold it. (Tr. 31-32) He used MJ once every two
or three months in college. (Tr. 57) He stopped using MJ socially once he started working
full time after college as it no longer fit his lifestyle and he no longer associated with the
same friends. (Tr. 31)
The first time Applicant took hallucinogenic mushrooms was in 2010 after his initial
diagnosis. (Tr. 32) They were a gift. (Tr. 52) A friend suspected Applicant was depressed
and offered the mushroom suggesting it would help. The second time was when Applicant
and his wife took mushrooms that were given to them as a proposed bonding experience.
(Tr. 33) Neither one liked the effects nor will they ever use mushrooms again. (Tr. 33)
Applicant also admitted to experimenting with LSD one time in 2016. (Answer, Tr. 33) It
was offered to him in a social setting at a Spring festival. (Tr. 34) He did not enjoy it and
will never try it, or any other illegal drug, again. He no longer associates with the festival
attendees. (Tr. 34)
Most  of  the  pain  management  surrounding  Applicant’s  multiple  surgeries  was
opiate based. (Tr. 35) He was prescribed medicinal MJ by a physician in April 2017 to
help  with  stress  and  aid  recovery.  MJ  was  legalized  in  his  state  in  2008.  (Tr.  60)  He
received  a  medical  marijuana  card.  (AE  A,  attachment  5,  Tr.  35)  Applicant  testified
credibly that the medical MJ helped with his unique medical conditions. (Tr. 36) He last
used MJ recreationally before he left college in 2014. He believed that his medical MJ
use starting in 2017 was legal in his state, and he never shared it with anybody. Now,
since receiving the SOR, he understands that the Federal Government considers all MJ
use  to  be  illegal.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant  attributes  his  past  drug  use  to  untreated  or  poorly
managed medical conditions. (Tr. 40) He is taking different medications now.
Applicant testified credibly that he informed his current employer about his medical
MJ use. (Tr. 39) He was hired by a college friend who responded that it was fine so long
as Applicant had the medical MJ certification. (Tr. 39) He concedes that his MJ use before
2014 was illegal. (Tr. 52) Applicant stopped using medical MJ in December 2018 after
enduring two more surgeries in 2017. (Tr. 66) That was about nine months after the SOR
issued.  (Tr.  65)  He  did  not  stop  using  sooner  due  to  confusion  about  the  interplay  of
options and laws surrounding MJ use. (Tr. 66)
Applicant has never been diagnosed as having a substance-abuse disorder and
he  did  not  seek  treatment.  He  has  now  disassociated  from  friends  who  use  MJ
recreationally. He last used MJ recreationally in 2014, and subsequent use was under
physician’s care and for medicinal purposes only.

"In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations.
Applicant is a 49-year-old senior-level employee for a DOD contractor who seeks
a security clearance. He has been employed with the DOD contractor since June 2013.
He  has  held  a  top  secret  security  clearance  since  2008.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree
and  has  also  attended  executive-education  courses.  He  is  married  and  has  three
children. Two are in college and the youngest is in high school.  (Tr.17-22, 34, 53; Gov
1) (Note: The facts  in this decision do  not  specifically  describe  employment,  names  of
witnesses, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family’s privacy. The cited
sources contain more specific information.)
Under the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana
in February 2014 and in January 2016 after being granted a security clearance in 2008.
The  same  conduct  is  cross-alleged  under  the  personal  conduct  concern.  In  his
response to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations, but states he did not believe he
was  committing  a  crime  because  marijuana  use  occurred  in  a  state  where  marijuana
use is legal. (Response to SOR, dated April 3, 2018)
On  September  25,  2014,  Applicant  submitted  an  electronic  questionnaire  for
investigations processing (e-QIP) for a periodic reinvestigation.  In response to Section
23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, Applicant listed that he used marijuana once
on  vacation.  He  believed  marijuana  was  legal  in  the  state  where  he  used  it.  Applicant
indicated on his e-QIP application that “It was legal in [state redacted], or so I thought at
the time.” (Gov 2, section 23)
On August 29, 2014, Applicant submitted a Standard Form 86 (SF 86), seeking
to  upgrade  his  security  clearance  for  access  to  sensitive  compartmented  information
(SCI). His sponsor was another government agency who sponsored him for his work as
a  contractor  with  the  agency.  In  response  to  questions  regarding  illegal  drug  use,  he
listed  marijuana  use  in  January  2013  in  a  state  where  marijuana  use  was  legal  and
marijuana use in June 2014 with his former college roommate. The location as to where
the use occurred in June 2014 was cut off on the SF 86. (Item 5 b) The January 2013
and  June  2014  marijuana  usage  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.    As  such,  it  will  not  be
considered under the disqualifying factors, but will be considered when applying matters
of extenuation and mitigation.
As  part  of  processing  for  SCI  access,  the  other  government  agency  had
Applicant  execute  a  Personnel  Security  Policy  Advisory  on  August  29,  2014,  which
states:
As  a  condition  of  receiving  or  retaining  security  clearance  with  [other
government  agency],  you  are  required  to  adhere  to  various  personnel
security policies. These policies are in effect to provide NSA affiliates from
being targets of espionage and other hostile activities carried out by or on

employees,  military
contractors,
representatives,
consultants,  and  experts)  and  applicants  is  strictly  prohibited.  Improper

While  the  actual  statement  signed  by  Applicant  is  not  in  the  record,  the
Clearance Decision statement of the other government agency indicates he signed the
statement on August 29, 2014.  (Gov 5a)
Applicant  was
interviewed  by  an
investigator  conducting  a  background
investigation on June 12, 2015. I considered the summary of the interview, but gave it
less  weight  because  it  is  unsworn  and  unauthenticated.  (See  Directive,  enclosure  3,
para  1.20)  Applicant’s  2014  marijuana  use  was  discussed  during  the  interview.    The
investigator’s  summary  of  the  interview  states  that  Applicant  had  no  desire  to  try
marijuana  again  because  he  now  realizes  marijuana  use  remains  illegal  under federal
law. (Gov 4)  Applicant did not recall this interview or making the above statement. He
conceded  under  cross-examination  that  if  it  was  in  the  statement  he  probably  said  it.
(Tr. 59)
On  January  11,  2016,  Applicant  underwent  a  counterintelligence  polygraph.
During  the  pre-polygraph  interview,  Applicant  told  the  polygrapher  that  he  used
marijuana in 2014 and 2016 while on vacation in a state where marijuana use was legal.
His most recent use of marijuana occurred about two  weeks before the polygraph. He
believed  that  it  was  okay  to  use  marijuana because  it  was  legal in  the  state  where he
used  it.  The  polygrapher  told  him  that  the  use  of  marijuana  was  not  okay  because
marijuana  use  was  still  illegal  under  federal  law.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  was  not
aware  of  this  until  he  was  so  advised  by  the  polygrapher.  Applicant  testified  the
polygrapher  told  him  something  to  the  effect  that  they  would  not  be  having  this
conversation  a  year  from  now,  implying  that  marijuana  may  become  legal  nationwide.
(Tr. 35-36; Gov 3 at 9-10 )
The  polygrapher  asked  Applicant  if  he  intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.
Applicant  responded,  “I  don’t  know  that  I’d  never  use  it  again.”  Applicant  testified  he
intended  to  be  honest  and  meant  that  he  might  possibly  use  marijuana  again  if  it
became legal under federal law or if he retired and traveled to a place where marijuana
is  legal.  He  stressed  that  he  had  no  intentions  of  using  marijuana  while  possessing  a
security  clearance  and  while  working  for  the  U.S.  government.  He  believes  the
polygrapher mischaracterized his answer. (Tr. 38-39, 60-61; Gov 3 at 10)
The polygrapher summarized the interview as follows:
[Applicant]  reported  that  from  approximately  January  2013  to  January
2016, he smoked marijuana approximately twice a year. In each instance,
he was given marijuana free of charge from a friend. He reported that the
last  time  he  smoked  marijuana  was  “this  past  Thursday,”  which  was  7
January 2016. He reported that he had an active security clearance at the
time. [Applicant] initially reported that he is likely to smoke marijuana again
in  the  future;  however,  when  asked  if  he  would  cease  smoking  the
substance as a condition of employment, he stated, “yes.”  (Gov 5a at 2)
Applicant  disputed
that  he  used  marijuana
the  polygrapher’s  assertion
approximately twice a year from 2013 to January 2014.  Applicant testified there were a
number of statements reflected in the report that  were not factual or were taken out of
context.  (Tr.  59-61)  On  October  17,  2016,  the  other  government  agency  denied
Applicant access to SCI. (Gov 5a)
On  February  23,  2017,  Applicant  submitted  an  e-QIP.  He  listed  that  he  used
marijuana on two occasions in February 2014 and January 2016. On both occasions, he
was on vacation with friends. Marijuana use was legal in the state where he vacationed
with friends. Applicant later indicated in response to the question regarding future use “I
now understand that was in violation of a federal statute by doing so.”  (Gov 1, section
23)
In response to Section 25 – Investigations and Clearance Record on the same e-
QIP  application,  Applicant  answered  “Yes”  in  response  to  “Have  you  EVER  had  a
security clearance eligibility/access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked?”  He
explained:
I  smoked  marijuana  in  a  state  where  it  was  considered  legal,  while  not
realizing  that  I  was  violating  the  terms  of  my  clearance  given  the  federal
nature  of  the  action.  I  made  it  clear  that  if  my  employment  status  was
contingent  upon  not  smoking  marijuana  I  would  refrain.  I  have  also
completely refrained (January 2016) since I became aware that I violated
the terms of my clearance.
(Gov 1, section 25)
Applicant has not used marijuana since January 2016.  He is not a habitual user.
He  claims  all  marijuana  use  occurred  with  friends  while  on  vacation  in  a  state  where
marijuana  was  legalized  in  2013.  He  provided  a  statement  on  October  25,  2018,
indicating that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future and is aware that any
future  involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  national  security  eligibility.
(Tr. 39; AE A, exhibit 3)
Applicant  no  longer  attends  his  friends’  annual  vacation.  He  avoids  situations
where  friends  may  use  marijuana.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  not  addicted  to
marijuana.  His marijuana  usage  never  created  problems  in  his life.  He  believed  it  was
legal  to  use  marijuana  in  the  state  where  he  was  on  holiday  and  only  partook  in  the
marijuana  that  was  being  passed  around  at  the  house  where  he  and  his friends  were
staying before they went out to dinner. If he was informed that marijuana use remained
illegal under federal law, he would not have used it.  (Tr. 36-37, 42-45, 71 )
When  asked  why  he  was  surprised  to  learn  that  marijuana  was  illegal  under
federal law in his 2017 background investigation, Applicant testified:
There are - - you hear constant stories in the media about what is and is
not  legal,  factual.  There  is  so  much  conflicting  information.  And  by  the
way,  as  my  OPM  investigator  said  to  me,  there  is  so  much  conflicting
information  out  there  that  there  is  not  a  clear  story  as  to  what’s  legal,
what’s  not,  and  as  with  any  element  of  life,  things  constantly  evolve  and
change. And, as I understood, that is the case.  (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant  is  remorseful  about  his  marijuana  use.  He  would  never  have  used
marijuana had he known the seriousness of his actions. He does not believe any of his
friends  would  pressure  him  to  use  marijuana  again.  His  family,  several  of  his  closest
friends,  and  some  of  his  colleagues  at  work  are  aware  of  his  past  marijuana  use.  His
marijuana use cannot be used to blackmail him. (Tr. 36, 49-50; AE 3 at 10)
The  Facility  Security  Officer  (FSO)  of  Applicant’s  employer  (FSO  A)  testified
during the hearing. He is a vice-president of administration and also serves as the FSO
as  an  additional  duty.  The  company  has  21  people  who  have  or  need  security
clearances.  In  2015,  he  trained  to  be  an  FSO  by  taking  online  training  offered  by  the
Center  for  Defense  Security  Excellence.  During  the  online  self-paced  training,  FSO  A
claims there was no discussion about the use of marijuana and the impact on security
clearances.  He  never  told  Applicant  about  the  adverse  consequences  of  using
marijuana while possessing a security clearance. (Tr. 72-77)
FSO A claimed he only learned there was an issue about using marijuana while
possessing  a  security  clearance  after  Applicant  told  him  about  it  after  his  background
investigation interview. The Defense Security Service (DSS) sends out monthly e-mails
about high-level facility security updates and changes in policy. FSO A cannot recall any
of  the  e-mails  containing  information  about  the  use  of  marijuana  while  possessing  a
security clearance. (Tr. 73-77)
FSO  A  is  familiar  with  the  SF  86.    He  is  aware  that  the  questionnaire  contains
questions regarding illegal drug use. If an employee came to him and told him of their
marijuana use, he would file an incident report. He testified he is required to report the
use because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. He is aware of that the policy
regarding marijuana use has not changed. He never told Applicant or employees of the
company that it was okay to use marijuana. He is aware of the statutory law on a federal
drug-free  workplace.  He  is  aware  that  employees  are  subject  to  urinalysis.  Applicant
never came to him to inquire about the use of marijuana, how it relates to federal law, or
the affect it would have on his security clearance. He does not recall if he received any
updates on DoD policy regarding the state legalizations of marijuana and how it affects
federal law.  (Tr. 78-86)

On  May  26,  2015,  the  Director  of  the  United  States  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  issued  a  memorandum  titled,  “Federal  Laws  and  Policies
Prohibiting  Marijuana  Use.”  The  Director  of  OPM  acknowledged
that  several
jurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for
medicinal  purposes  and/or  for  limited  recreational  use  but  states  that  Federal  law  on
marijuana  remains  unchanged.  Marijuana  is  categorized  as  a  controlled  substance
under  Schedule  I  of  the  Controlled  Substances  Act.  Thus  knowing  or  intentional
marijuana  possession  is  illegal,  even  if  the  individual  has  no  intent  to  manufacture,

"In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the two allegations made under Guideline
H and set forth in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  25  years  old  and  is  unmarried.  He  graduated  from  college  with  a
bachelor’s degree in January 2016. He began his first full-time job in June 2016 working
for a government contractor.
On August 30, 2016, he submitted a security clearance application (SCA). In the
SCA,  he  disclosed  that  he  used  marijuana  during  the  period  2012  to  April  2016.  He
disclosed that he had used the drug infrequently, and that he had used it less than 50
times. He also disclosed that he had used cocaine twice, both times in the months after
college and before he began his job. He reported that he had no intent to ever use cocaine
again.
In his November 9, 2017 background interview, he confirmed his marijuana use
while in college and admitted that his last use of the drug was in the preceding month,
October 2017, over one year after he submitted his SCA. He acknowledged that he knew
that the use of marijuana was illegal and stated that he plans to continue using the drug
on  weekends. After the  investigator advised  him that  persons  with  security  clearances

2016 (FORM Item 5), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
are not permitted to use illegal drugs, Applicant told the investigator that he would stop
using the drug if he was granted a security clearance. (Item 6 at 7.)
In  September  2018,  Applicant  responded  to  Department  Counsel’s  FORM  by
stating at length his changed view on his use of marijuana. He wrote that following his
November 2017 background interview, he had reconsidered his priorities and decided to
no longer use any marijuana. His last use was, as stated to the investigator, in October
2017.  He  elaborated  that  he  had  decided  that  his  old  views  on  using  marijuana  were
immature and inconsistent with his career plans. He explained that he has cut ties with
friends  who  he  had  smoked  marijuana  with  and  kept  his  distance  from  anyone  using
marijuana. He also emphasized that in September 2017 he had entered into a serious
relationship with a woman who does not tolerate any drug use. She also has encouraged
him  to  work  hard  to  meet  his  goals,  which  includes  abstaining  from  any  drug  use.  As
noted, he also signed a written statement that he has no future intent to use illegal drugs
in the future. (FORM Response; AE A.)

"After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  49  years  old.  He  has  been  employed  by  his  present  employer,  a
federal  contractor,  since  2005.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  of  science  in  business
management in October 2004. He has been married since 2000 and has two children,
ages  18  and  15.  He  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  in  March  1988.  In  June  1991,  he
received a general discharge due to his marijuana use while in the military. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant was interviewed in September 2017 by an authorized DOD investigator
for  his  background  security  clearance  investigation.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he
began  using  marijuana  in  1986  while  he  was  in  high  school.  He  admitted  using
marijuana  on  approximately  three  occasions  while  he  was  in  the  military.  Since  his
discharge from the military in 1991, he admitted that he continued to smoke marijuana
on a monthly basis to the present time. Prior to October 2015, Applicant would purchase
marijuana  from  an  individual’s  home.  Since  October  2015,  he  obtained  a  medical
marijuana card and now purchases his marijuana from the dispensary, since it is legal
to  do  so  in  his  state.  Applicant  admitted  he  falsified  his  drug  answers  on  the  SCA
because  he  was  afraid  the  information  would  have  an  adverse  impact  on  his  security
clearance.  Applicant  stated  that  he  no  longer  plans  to  use  marijuana  because  he now
has no desire to use it. (Item 9)
On  the  2005  SCA,  Applicant  only  disclosed  marijuana  use  in  March  1990.  He
intentionally failed to disclose his current use of marijuana, and that he used cocaine in
at least 2000. Applicant voluntarily entered treatment in 2000 due to his use of cocaine,
but  he  did  not  disclose  that  information  either.  On  the  2016  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed
that he used marijuana in the military, and he disclosed his voluntary treatment in 2000
for  his  use  of  cocaine.  Applicant  intentionally  failed  to  disclose  his  current  use  of
marijuana, to include after he was granted a DOD security clearance in January 2007.
(Items 4, 5)
The  DOD  investigator  also  questioned  Applicant  about  the  delinquent  accounts
he listed on his 2016 SCA. Applicant stated that beginning in about December 2010, he
could  no  longer  afford  to make  regular payments  on  these financial  accounts  after  his
spouse had her hours reduced by her employer. Applicant admitted that he has not paid
any  of  his  delinquent  creditors.  He  was  currently  doing  research  into  the  possibility  of
consolidating his delinquent debt, but he had not yet taken any action to do so. (Item 9)
Drug Involvement
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that while Applicant was on active duty in the U.S. Air Force,
and after being granted a DOD security clearance, he used marijuana between August
1990 and June 1991. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. (Items 1,
3)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  Applicant  tested  positive  for  marijuana  while  on  active
duty  in  April  1991.  He  received  non-judicial  punishment  and  the  U.S.  Air  Force  gave
Applicant a general, under honorable conditions discharge (misconduct – drug use), in
June 1991. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. (Items 1, 3)
The  third  SOR  allegation  (¶  1.c)  alleges  that  Applicant  continued  to  use  and
purchase marijuana from June 1991 to at least September 2017, to include after he had
been  granted  a  DOD  security  clearance  in  January  2007.  Applicant  admitted  this
allegation in his SOR response. (Items 1, 3)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his 2016 SCA by intentionally failing to
disclose  that  he  had  used  marijuana  within  the  last  seven  years,  and  he  deliberately
failed to divulge he had continued to use marijuana after he had been granted a DOD
security  clearance  in  January  2007.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his  SOR
response. (Items 1, 3)
The  second  SOR  allegation  (¶  2.b)  alleges  that  Applicant  deliberately  failed  to
disclose on his 2005 SCA that he had used marijuana within the last seven years, and
that he had also used cocaine in at least 2000. Applicant admitted this allegation in his
SOR response. (Items 1, 3)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  on  six  delinquent  accounts  in  the
total approximate amount of $24,292. (Items 1, 6-8)
SOR  ¶  3.a  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  on  a  credit  card  account  that  has
been placed for collection in the approximate amount of $8,708.00. As of January 2018,
the  account  remained  delinquent.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his  SOR
response. (Items 1, 3)
SOR  ¶  3.b  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  on  a  credit  card  account  that  has
been  charged  off  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $4,898.00.  As  of  January  2018,  the
account  remained  delinquent.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his  SOR  response.
(Items 1, 3)
SOR  ¶  3.c  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  on  a  credit  card  account  that  has
been placed for collection in the approximate amount of $4,283.00. As of January 2018,
the  account  remained  delinquent.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his  SOR
response. (Items 1, 3)
SOR  ¶  3.d  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  on  a  credit  card  account  that  has
been placed for collection in the approximate amount of $4,172.00. As of January 2018,
the  account  remained  delinquent.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his  SOR
response. (Items 1, 3)
SOR  ¶  3.e  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  on  a  credit  card  account  that  has
been  charged  off  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $2,041.00.  As  of  January  2018,  the
account  remained  delinquent.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his  SOR  response.
(Items 1, 3)
SOR ¶ 3.f alleges that Applicant is indebted for a utility service account that has
been placed for collection in the approximate amount of $190.00. As of January 2018,
the  account  remained  delinquent.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his  SOR
response. (Items 1, 3)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted misuse of prescription drugs as
alleged under ¶ 1.a.
Applicant is 38 years old. She married in May 2015 and gave birth to a daughter
on  August  26,  2017.  She  has  owned  her  home  since  March  2011.  In  May  2003,
Applicant  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  history;  in  August  2004,  she  earned  a
master’s degree in cultural studies; and in May 2009, she was awarded a law degree.
From 2009 to September 2010, she clerked for a federal district court judge. She was a
law  firm  associate for three  years before  landing  her current  job  in  2014  where  she  is
presently a senior contract attorney. She is a member of two state bars. Applicant has
never  been  investigated  or  held  a  security  clearance.  She  has  no  criminal  record  and
the only drug she has used in her life is Adderall. (GE 1 at 9-14, 22, 69, 72; GE 2 at 16;
AE B; AE C; AE F; AE G; AE N at 2-3; AE O)
In her October 2016 PSI, Applicant indicated she used Adderall about two times
a  month  beginning  in  January  2016,  when  she  was  34  years  old.  The  controlled
substance  was  prescribed  to  her  brother  for  his  attention  deficit  disorder.  She  began
taking the drug to curb her appetite. She indicated that the drug never had an adverse
effect  on  her  judgment,  her  work,  or  her  finances.  She  informed  the  OPM  investigator
that she intended to continue using the drug unless required to stop to obtain a security
clearance. (GE 2 at 16)
In her interrogatory answers dated and notarized on February 9, 2018, Applicant
noted  several  minor  changes  in  her  October  2016  PSI.  She  then  disclosed  that  her
daughter was born in August 2017. She also indicated that she used Adderall about 30
times from January 2016 to February 9, 2018. (GE 2 at 1-5, 16)
Though  not  mentioned  in  her  October  2016  PSI  or  her  February  2018
interrogatory  answers,  she  informed  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker  (LCSW)  in  April
2019  that  during  her  pregnancy  and  nursing  of  her  daughter  from  December  2016  to
approximately February 2018, she used no Adderall. (AE N at 2-3)
The LCSW conducted a full evaluation of Applicant in April 2019. For part of the
evaluation, she administered the drug assessment screening test (DAST) to Applicant.
She  conducted an  examination using  the  11-point  screening  criteria  of  Diagnostic  and
Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). She  conducted  a  mental status  exam
followed  by  a  clinical  interview.  After  referencing  the  AGs  for  security  clearance
eligibility  and  reviewing  the  pertinent  sections  of  the  DSM-5,  the  LCSW  diagnosed
Applicant as having no substance abuse disorder. (AE N at 1-4)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  that  her obesity  was  the  reason  she  started
using Adderall in January 2016. Over the next several months, she lost 70 pounds and
became pregnant in December 2016. She indicated that she did not use Adderall during
her  pregnancy  (December  2016  to  August  2017)  and  while  she  was  nursing  her
daughter for the next four months. Applicant resumed her Adderall use in January 2018
because she wanted to lose weight again, a decision she regrets. She discontinued use
in  February  2018  “because  that’s  when  I  received  the  Government’s  Statement  of
Reasons.”  (Tr. 33) (She  is mistaken as  the SOR  was  not  issued until March 1, 2018.)
Applicant did not know the drug was a controlled substance until a later date. (SOR; Tr.
22-28; 33)
The circumstances in Applicant’s life have changed since the birth and nursing of
her daughter. She is no longer trying to lose weight to achieve pregnancy. She pledged
not to use Adderall or another person’s prescription drugs in the future. Applicant’s six
drug  tests  from  October  2018  through  March  2019  registered  negative  results.  On
December 11, 2018, she signed a statement of intent to abstain from future misuse of
prescription drugs, realizing that future misuse of prescription medication is grounds for
revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr. 22-28; AE L; AE M)
In November 2018, Applicant’s treating psychiatrist recalled that that she told him
in August 2016 she was using Adderall though he was unable to conclude “during that
time”  or  “since  that  time”  that  she  was  addicted  to  the  drug.  Applicant’s  weight  loss
doctor, who she has been consulting occasionally for four years,  discouraged her from
using Adderall. She has never tried to obtain a prescription for the drug from a medical
professional.  She  has  had  some  success  with  other  prescribed  weight-loss  drugs,  but
stopped using one of those drugs because of the risk of birth defects. (Tr. 31-33, 35-38;
AE K)
Applicant selected Adderall to control her appetite because somehow she knew
the  drug  could  subdue  hunger  desires  and  she  was  aware  her  brother  had  a
prescription for the drug. She did not know if the drug had any side effects or a negative
influence on her fertility. (Tr. 36-37, 42-43)
Applicant’s  fear  of  not  being  granted  a  security  clearance  was  one  reason  she
stopped  using  Adderall.  However,  when  she  received  the  SOR  labeling  her a  national
security concern, she knew she had to strengthen her resolve for continued abstinence
from Adderall misuse or misuse of another’s prescription drugs. (Tr. 37)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s colleague (Mr. R3) at her current employer testified that he has been
working with Applicant for three years. In his daily contact with her, he has found her to
be very professional and a trustworthy attorney. Applicant expressed her remorse to Mr.
R3 for having used Adderall that was prescribed to her brother. She was trying to lose
weight so that she could become pregnant. (Tr. 11-19)
Applicant submitted nine character references. A program manager (Mr. R1) has
known Applicant since 2011 because they worked together on government contracts at
a  law  firm  until she  accepted  her present  job  in  2014.  Applicant’s professionalism and
trustworthiness  is  based  on  Mr.  R1’s  regular  interaction  with  her.  Mr.  R2  has  known
Applicant  for  nine  years  and  believes  that  she  is  a  diligent  worker.  Mr.  R3,  corporate
counsel  who  testified  at  the  hearing,  indicated  that  Applicant  is  involved  in  a
neighborhood  charity  that  provides  scholarships  to  worthy  candidates  from  the  area.
(AE H; AE J)
Mr.  R4,  a  contractor,  has  known  Applicant  professionally  and  socially  for  four
years.  He  believes  she  is  a  knowledgeable  member  of  the  government  contractor
community. Ms. R5 has known Applicant since they were in law school in 2006. Ms. R5
and  Applicant  have  maintained  friendship  over  the  years.  Mr.  R6,  an  associate  law
school  professor,  was  a  law  clerk  with  Applicant  in  2009.  They  have  remained  friends
with Mr. R6 and Applicant socializing often. (AE H)
Mr. R7, who has known Applicant for five years, worked with her for a period of
time at her current employer. He found her to be honest, dedicated, and a team player.
Mr.  R8,  currently  a  police  officer,  worked  with  Applicant  at  her  employer’s  industrial
security office. He personally observed her trustworthiness and high caliber of her work
product. (AE H)
Mrs. R9, a lawyer, has known Applicant since 2012, when Mrs. R9 was hired at a
contracts law firm, and Applicant was assigned to be her adviser. Applicant’s mentoring
helped Mrs. R9 manage her time  more  effectively  and  stimulate  her  professional
development.  Applicant  is an  honest  person,  a  responsible  wife,  and  attentive  mother.
(AE H) None of the nine glowing character endorsements, not even the reference from
Mr. R3, make any reference to Applicant’s misuse of prescription drugs.

"Applicant is 38 years old. He graduated from high school in 1999 and obtained his
bachelor’s  degree  in  2003.  He  obtained  a  master’s  degree  in  2008.  He  has  been
employed  as  an  architect  for  a  federal  contractor  since  2004.  He  was  promoted  to
principal  and  partner  in  an  architectural  firm  engaged  as  a  federal  contractor  in  2018.
Applicant reports no military service, and he has never married. Applicant previously held
a security clearance since 2007, without incident.
On May 12, 2017, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA),
and in section 23 (illegal use of drugs or drug activity) he responded “yes” to questions
about illegal drug use and/or misuse of prescription drugs within the last seven years. He
estimated his first use of marijuana was in January 2002, and he used marijuana (MJ)
“once or  twice  a  year, for fun,  with friends.”2 He  also  stated  that he  used  MJ  while  he
possessed a security clearance and he did not intend to use any controlled substances
in the future. In an earlier SCA signed by Applicant on December 21, 2006, he responded
“yes” to similar questions about any illegal use of drugs or controlled substance in section
24 (Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity).3 He indicated that he used MJ about 10-15
times between September 1999 and February 2002. He was granted a security clearance
in 2007.
In his Answer to the SOR in April 2018, Applicant stated that his most recent use
of MJ in 2017, was due to a misinterpretation of the change in the law effectively legalizing
MJ in Washington, D.C. He used the drug only recreationally at social settings where it
was provided by friends and he never cultivated, sold, or purchased MJ. Since the District
is a federalized city, he wrongly assumed that the legalization of MJ applied across the
federal  government.  Although,  he  self-reported  his  use  of  MJ  occurring  between
September 1999 and May 2017, Applicant stated that there was a long lapse of several
years before he re-offended in 2017. He does not know which years he used MJ, or the
exact  number  of  usages.  He  provided  a  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement or substance misuse subject to revocation of his national security eligibility.

Clearance Application (SCA) (Item 3) and his SCA dated December 21, 2006 (item 4).

3 Item 4, p. 29.
Applicant has never been diagnosed as having a substance-abuse disorder and
he did not seek treatment. He has now disassociated from friends who use MJ. Applicant
also attached his resume, detailing his significant experience and accomplishments in his
profession, several letters of appreciation, and two performance appraisals showing that
he was rated excellent or outstanding in all categories. He has experience working on
high  visibility,  secure,  projects.  He  received  year-end  bonuses  each  year  from  2014 –
2017. He also provided four positive character reference letters at Tab E attached to his
Answer  to  the  SOR,  including  one  from  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO).  All  attest  to
Applicant’s integrity, trustworthiness, and reliability.

"The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  employment  with  a
federal contractor for gross negligence in September 2016, after his employer’s internal
investigation  determined  that  he  intentionally  and  knowingly  manipulated  program
performance test data. Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his employment
for  gross  negligence,  but  denied  any  misconduct  or  that  he  intentionally  or  knowingly
manipulated the data.
After a  thorough  review  of the  record  evidence,  I make  the following findings of
fact:
Applicant  is  a  62-year-old  design  engineer  working  for  a  federal  contractor.  He
became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983. He earned a master’s degree in 1985, and
received a doctorate degree (Ph.D.) in 2017, both from U.S. universities. He married in
1982, and has two adult children.
Between 2000 and 2010, Applicant worked for federal contractor “1.” He worked
for federal contractor “2” from 2010 until he was terminated in September 2016 for gross
negligence  and  intentionally  and  knowingly  manipulating  program  performance  test
data.  An  adverse  incident  report  was  submitted  by  contractor  “2”  to  the  Defense
Industrial  Security  Clearance  Office  shortly  after  Applicant’s  termination  in  September
2016. He has held a clearance since about 2007.
Applicant was unemployed between September 2016 and January 2017. He was
hired  and  has  been  working  for  his  current  employer  and  security  sponsor,  federal
contractor “3,” since January 2017.
In his response to Section 13A (Employment Activities) of his March 2017 SCA,
Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  terminated by  contractor  “2”  after  some  data anomaly
was discovered accidentally in September 2016 and he was blamed for it. He stated he
did not remember exactly  what happened three years ago, but that he was terminated
for gross negligence.
Applicant  admitted  to  committing  gross  negligence  in  an  email  to  a  supervisor
and others, dated May 5, 2016. (Applicant’s Memo 1-1) In that same email, he explains
how data could have been deleted and the wrong data overwritten. He stated:
I  usually  create  working  directory,  and  copy  the  results  to  the  main
directory, but in this case, it looks like the working directory I processed . .
.  . has  been  deleted  . .  . .  so  it  is possible that this working  directory  got
deleted inadvertently . . . . before data had been captured . . . . I think it is
a  strong  possibility  that  I  must  have  entered  the  wrong  numbers  to
produce wrong results . . . . But, I tried to reproduce the results I got from
the scratch since I could not find the control files . . . . I think it is a strong
possibility that I must have entered the wrong numbers to produce wrong
results . . . . I feel immense shame that this represents a gross negligence
on record keeping on my part.
Applicant also admitted to his program manager that he intentionally substituted
data  from  another  test  into  his  test  data.  To  substitute  the  data,  Applicant  had  to
manually overwrite the test data results. A folder with data was erased from contractor’s
“2”  network.  The  overwriting  and  erasing  of  the  data  was  established  through  the
computer  logs.  When  questioned  by  a  second  coworker  about  the  data  substitution,
Applicant stated that he wanted to “come clean” and asked the coworker to pray for him.
In  his  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  stated  that  he  had  no  recollection  of
knowingly and intentionally manipulating the test data. He also did not remember using
the words “come clean,” but stated that if he used them, it must have been in reference
to different data or in a different context.
Concerning  his  admission  of  gross  negligence  in  his  email  to  his  supervisor
(Memo 1-1), Applicant believes that his statement was misunderstood by contractor “2”
as  an  admission  of  wrongdoing  and  gross  negligence.  He  stated  that  the  gross
negligence  he  expressed  was  a  reference  to  his  own  standard  of  not  keeping  the
personal  record,  but  avers  that  the  personal  record  keeping  was  not  a  contractual
requirement.
Applicant also noted that there were at least three engineers with access to the
same computer and data, and any of the three could have done what he was accused
of doing. He believes that he was singled out by contractor “2” as a scapegoat for the
contractor’s negligence in up keeping and maintaining its test equipment.
The  Department  of  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Special  Investigations  submitted  a
report  of  investigation  (ROI)  in  September  2017.  The  report  titled  Applicant  for  fraud
offenses (false pretenses/swindle/confidence game).
During  his  September  2017  background
interview  with  a  government
investigator, Applicant stated that he had not disclosed his termination to any member
of his family or friends. He lied to his spouse about his termination and told her that he
had retired early. When asked why, he stated that his native country’s culture does not
allow for the head of a household to be disgraced in the eyes of his family. He reiterated
that if this become an issue he would retire.
Applicant did not disclose his termination to his current employer, contractor “3.”
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  this  was  a  big  trauma  in  his  life.  He  is  very
embarrassed and has a difficult time talking about his termination. Applicant stated that
the  incident  cannot  be  used  to  blackmail  him.  He  further  stated  that  if  his  current
employer (contractor “3”) discovered the termination and fired him, he would retire.
In  his  answer  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  adopted  the  summary  of  his
three  2017  interviews.  In  his  response,  he  indicated  that  when  he  was  terminated,  he
hired  an  attorney  to  contest  his  termination  and  requested  an  administrative  officer
review  to  be  performed  by  contactor  “2.”  He  did  not  follow  up  on  the  appeal  of  his
termination because the legal fees were too expensive and he had moved out of state
to take the job with contractor “3”.” He also stated that after his interviews in 2017, he
had a chat with his wife about his termination and she was now aware of it.
Applicant  noted  in  his  answer  to  the  FORM  that  he  had  not  disclosed  his
termination for gross negligence to his current employer, contractor “3.” He explained it
was  very  difficult  to  for  him  to  voluntarily  disclose  his  termination  after  contractor  “3”
identified him as a valuable asset and had spent more than $50,000 for his relocation.

"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  27-year-old  high  school  graduate  with  some  community  college
credits. He was married from January 2013 to March 2016, and has a five-year-old son for
whom he pays $650 per month in child support. His ex-wife has primary physical custody of
their son. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 24-26.) He has worked for his current defense contractor employer
as a test mechanic since July 2017 and needs to retain his security clearance to maintain
his employment. (Tr. 25.)
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. military with a Secret security clearance
from July 2011 to March 2017. (GE 1.) After completing boot camp and military schooling,
Applicant reported to a command in January 2012. He initially showed little appreciation for
military  decorum  or  rank  and  challenged  his  superiors  about  military  practices  and
regulations. He was also late to watch on occasion. He was issued well over 20 corrective
action memoranda or written reprimands during his first two years in the service. In 2014,
he achieved the rank of petty officer third class. After being counseled about his lack of
military professionalism and insubordinate attitude, he began to conform his behavior to
that expected of his rank and military service. (GE 2; Tr. 54-55, 62-67.) His Evaluation
Report and Counseling Record for his duty performance from June 2015 to June 2016
indicates that he exceeded standards in areas of military bearing/character, personal job
accomplishments,  and  teamwork.  Applicant’s  rating  superior  noted  that  Applicant  had
shown improvement over the reporting period and was now operating at the level expected
in  his  division.  He  was  described  as  knowledgeable,  a  team  player,  and  driven  and
recommended for advancement with a rating of must promote. (AE A.)
Counseling incidents declined significantly, although by the time of his discharge,
Applicant estimated that he had received approximately 40 written chits or reprimands at
the  command.  (GE  2.)  Applicant  was  administered  non-judicial  punishment  once,  in
December 2016, when he and three others violated liberty restrictions by staying out past
curfew. Applicant was punished with a reduction in rank from E-4 to E-3 (suspended), 60
days restriction (suspended), and loss of half pay for two months (enforced) for failure to
obey an order and conduct that could bring discredit on the armed forces. Applicant was
warned that the reduction in rank and restriction punishments would be enforced if he
should receive any additional written counseling chits or reprimands. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 57, 67.)
Within a month of his non-judicial proceeding, Applicant had an argument with an
information  technology  systems  technician  in  his division.  A  week  later, the technician
blamed Applicant for cutting an Internet cable.1 Applicant was issued a written counseling
1 Applicant indicated during a December 2017 subject interview that he argued with the information technology
systems technician because the technician was not permitted to be present during weapons handling, and he
refused to leave until a superior intervened. (GE 2.) Applicant now asserts that he argued with the technician
because his son had just been diagnosed with autism, and the technician had blocked his emails so he could
not receive updates about his son. (Tr. 63-63.)
chit, even though he denied cutting the cable and never signed the chit. As a result of the
reprimand, the suspended terms of his non-judicial punishment were imposed. Applicant
contested  the reprimand to no avail. According to Applicant, when he asked a military
superior for assistance, this superior told him that he had to worry about his own career.
(Tr. 62.) Because of his length of service, Applicant could not continue in the military at the
rank of E-3 per regulation. In March 2017, he was honorably discharged against his desire
to stay in the military. (GE 2; Tr. 24, 58-64.)
Applicant’s direct superior at the time of Applicant’s non-judicial punishment and
discharge had served with Applicant from January 2013. He attests that early on, Applicant
frequently disappeared and was delinquent in his qualifications. However, once Applicant
decided to commit to his duty, his performance improved markedly, and he took immense
pride in his work.  Applicant proved to be a great asset to him with training junior personnel
and could be counted on to give his very best until the job was done. (AE B.)
Two or three weeks after his discharge from the military, Applicant applied to work
for his current employer. (Tr. 28.) As of May 2017, he had received no response to his job
application.  (Tr.  21,  29.)  He  had  trouble  sleeping,  and  expressed  his  concerns  to  a
counselor who was seeing a friend. The counselor suggested that he see a local physician
for medical marijuana. Applicant had used marijuana twice that he can recall and perhaps
three to four times while in high school “to party,” but he did not engage in any illegal drug
use while in the military. (Tr. 26-27, 50-51.)The physician prescribed medical marijuana for
Applicant for post-traumatic stress related to his military service.2 (GE 2; Tr. 35, 40-41, 47.)
On May 25, 2017, Applicant was certified for medical marijuana by the state for one year.
He  was  authorized  to  purchase  2.5  ounces  from  a  medical  marijuana  dispensary.  He
received his card (AE D) in the mail a few weeks later, and he purchased 3.5 grams of
marijuana from a dispensary at a cost of $35. (GE 2; Tr. 41-42.) Applicant used marijuana
approximately five times over the course of two or three days in his home in June 2017.
(GEs 1-2; Tr. 42-43.) He did not share any of the marijuana because it would be a criminal
offense. (Tr. 42.) Applicant did not then consider the implications of his medical marijuana
use because it was legal under state law. (Tr. 23, 45.)
Shortly after he used marijuana, Applicant was offered a position with his employer.
He realized that his use of marijuana could have negative implications. He discarded his
medical marijuana card and removed himself from the medical marijuana program.3 (Tr.
32-33.) He was called in to the worksite by his employer in July 2017 and administered a
2 Under pertinent state law, a patient may only register for a medical marijuana certificate if he or she is a state
resident being treated for a debilitating medical condition by a state-licensed physician. Post-traumatic stress
disorder is one of the specific debilitating conditions that qualifies for medical marijuana under state law.
3 Applicant told the OPM investigator that he stopped using marijuana immediately when he received his job
offer. (GE 2.) Applicant was asked on cross-examination about when he stopped using marijuana. He testified
that he was “already done and out,” when he was called by his employer. When asked when he first suspected
that his marijuana use could be a problem, he responded that his mind set was that marijuana was legal in the
state and he “didn’t make the correlation between state and federal.” He acknowledged that he realized it
could be problematic. (Tr.  44-45.) Applicant testified that he destroyed his medical marijuana card to “take
away all temptation,” and so there would be no doubt that he could use marijuana again. (Tr. 32.)
pre-employment drug screen by hair sample. (GE 3; Tr. 29-30.) Suspecting that he would
test  positive  for  tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC),  Applicant  notified  the  person  taking  his
sample that he had a medical marijuana card, and he provided proof to the yard hospital by
email link that he had been issued a state medical marijuana certificate. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 31-
33.) On July 19, 2017, Applicant’s employer filed an incident report with the DOD indicating
that Applicant had tested positive for THC in his pre-employment hair drug screen, and that
he had provided proof of a state medical marijuana certificate to the yard hospital. (GE 3.)
Despite failing the pre-employment drug screen, Applicant was hired by the defense
contractor because his marijuana use was legal under state law. Applicant was told that he
could no longer use any marijuana legally or illegally because it was a federal contractor
job and marijuana is illegal under federal law. (Tr. 22, 35.)
On  July  27,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to inquiries concerning
the illegal use of drugs or controlled substances, Applicant indicated that he used medical
marijuana with a medical marijuana card one day throughout the day in June 2017. He
denied any intention to use marijuana in the future and explained:
I had a [state] Medical Marijuana card. Legal by state ILLEGAL by federal
law. Since working at [company] I have stopped use and have also destroyed
the card and taken measures to remove myself from the program. (GE 1.)
In early December 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He volunteered that, when he was in the
military,  he  had  been  disciplined  an  estimated  40  times  for  misconduct  related  to
disrespecting rank and military decorum (such as asking a superior not to walk on the deck
that he had just cleaned; requesting gloves before he would clean latrines; and asking a
superior not to stick his finger in his face). He often challenged his superiors, for which he
received counseling chits for insubordination. He was also written up multiple times for
being late to watch and once for breaking a window in a guard shack. He explained that he
often  spoke  up  when  he  felt  something  was  not  right  or  he  felt  a  superior  was  being
demeaning  toward  him.  Applicant  addressed  his  non-judicial  punishment  and  the
subsequent incident involving the Internet cable that led to his discharge. He denied that he
cut the cable and indicated that the technician who issued the chit admitted to an officer
that  he  wrote  the  chit  out  of  anger  following  his  argument  with  Applicant.  Applicant
acknowledged that he had created a bad reputation among his superiors at the command,
but his performance evaluations were generally good, even with all the written counseling
memoranda. About his marijuana use, Applicant explained that he purchased 3.5 grams of
marijuana  with  a  medical  marijuana  card  in  June 2017 and used it “no more than five
times.” Later that month, he received a job offer from his defense-contractor employer, and
he immediately resolved to abstain from any marijuana use in the future. He added that he
failed his initial drug screen administered by the company and notified company personnel
about his medical marijuana use. He indicated that, because he had a medical marijuana
card,  he  could  work for the  company  but  would  have  to  update  his security  clearance
paperwork  and  abstain  from  marijuana  going  forward.  Applicant  denied  any  use  of
marijuana  since  then  and  added  that  he  had  destroyed  his  medical  marijuana  card.
Applicant  explained  that  he  would  not  compromise  his  employment  eligibility  by  using
marijuana in the future. He agreed to submit to random drug screening by his employer.
(GE 2.)
In September or October 2017, Applicant volunteered for a drug screen at work that
was  negative  for  all  substances  tested,  including  marijuana.  (Tr.  35-36.)  Applicant
understands  that  his  employer  has  a  drug-free  policy  (Tr.  28,  36),  and  that  marijuana
remains illegal under federal law. (Tr. 52.) He signed an agreement with his employer to
refrain from engaging in any prohibited drug use while employed by the company. He has
been tasked by his employer with talking to new hires now and then about the fact that
employees have to abide by the federal prohibition of any marijuana involvement. (Tr. 53-
54.)  Applicant  does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  (Tr.  35.)  He  now  takes
melatonin to help with his sleep issues. (Tr. 39.)
Applicant has not had any incidents of misconduct or insubordination in his current
job.  (Tr.  72.)  He  was  promoted  after  six  months  on  the  job  and  has  applied  for  a
supervisory position. (Tr. 68.)  He only recently regained his driving privileges, which had
been suspended when he was in the military because his ex-wife failed to pay a speeding
ticket for him that he incurred just prior to a deployment. He had to take Uber to work at
$36 a day that he paid for by working overtime. (Tr. 69-71.)  Applicant’s current supervisor
asks that Applicant be given special consideration by the DOD with respect to keeping his
clearance. Applicant has become a valuable asset to their department. He qualified to hold
two positions centered on the safety and well-being of workers and needs no guidance. His
supervisor  considers  Applicant  to  be  an  “extremely  efficient,  driven,  competent  and
qualified individual.” (AE C.)

"Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance  for  the  first  time.  He  is  employed  as  a  software  engineer  by  a  company
working  in  the  defense  industry.  He  has  been  so  employed  since  February  2017.  He
has  a  good  employment  record  with  his  current  employer  and  is  held  in  high  regard
according  to  letters  of  recommendation  from  a  supervisor  and  co-worker.  (Exhibits  C
and  D)  His  educational  background  includes  an  associate’s  degree  in  applied  science
awarded  in  2004,  and  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  science,  magna  cum  laude,
awarded in 2007. He has had full-time employment as a software engineer since 2007.
He  has  no  military  service.  He  has  been  a  homeowner  since  2009.  He  has  never
married and has no children.
The  SOR  alleges  and  Applicant  admits  a  history  of  drug  involvement  and
substance  misuse  from  about  August  2009  to  about  July  2016.  He  disclosed  these
matters  in  his  February  2017  security  clearance  application,  which  forms  the  basis for
the SOR allegations. He had a five-year relationship with a woman whom he thought he
would marry, and most of his drug use occurred with her. He has since severed his ties
to  her,  separating  in  March  2017.  (Tr.  2017)  He  did  not  list  her  as  a  cohabitant  in  his
February 2017 security clearance application.
Applicant’s drug involvement and substance misuse consist of the following:
  He used marijuana with varying frequency, about once every six months,
during the 2009-2016 period. He used occasionally when friends offered it
to him. He did not purchase or seek out marijuana for his use. He has not
used marijuana since late 2016 (New Year’s Eve). He typically used it on
occasions  such  as  camping  or  climbing  trips.  He  has  no  intention  to  use
marijuana again.
  He  used  cocaine  twice  with  his  former  girlfriend  during  the  April  2013  to
February  2016  period.  He  never  purchased  cocaine  or  sought  it  out.  He
was wary of it due to its addictive qualities. He was interested in cocaine
for  experimental  use  and  had  no  intention  to  use  it  regularly.  He  has  no
intention to use cocaine again.
  He  provided  the  prescription  medication  Xanax  to  a  friend  on  multiple
occasions  during  2013-2016.  His  friend  suffered  from  stress  and  anxiety
on occasion, and he provided small amounts of Xanax about once a year
during this period. He has no intention of engaging in similar behavior.
  He used a prescription muscle relaxer, not prescribed to him, with varying
frequency during 2013-2016. He has a chronic back problem that causes
him pain periodically. He mentioned his back problem to a friend and the
friend  offered  the  muscle  relaxer  to  him.  He  later  consulted  a  physician
who  prescribed  the  same  medication  for  him.  He  has  no  intention  of
engaging in similar behavior.
Applicant knows that his employer has a drug-free workplace policy, and he was
required to pass a pre-employment drug test as a condition of employment. (Tr. 52) He
also  knows  that  any  substance  misuse,  including  marijuana  use,  is  off  limits  as  a
cleared  employee  regardless  of  the  laws  of  any  state.  (Tr.  49-55)  He  reaffirmed  his
intention to abstain from all illegal drug involvement and substance misuse in his post-
hearing signed statement of intent. (Exhibit G). He also acknowledged that any further
drug  involvement  or  substance  misuse  may  be  grounds  for  revocation  of  national
security eligibility. (Exhibit G)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
1  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under  Guideline  H  for  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,  the  concern  is
set forth in AG ¶ 24 as follows:
[t]he  illegal  use  of  controlled  substances,  to  include  the  misuse  of
prescription  and non-prescription drugs,  and the  use  of  other  substances
that  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner
inconsistent  with  their  intended  purpose,  can  raise  questions  about  an
individual’s  reliability  and  trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior
may  lead  to  physical  or  psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,
and  regulations.  Controlled  substance  means  any  “controlled  substance”
as  defined  in  21  U.S.C.  802.  Substance  misuse  is  the  generic  term
adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.
In addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence
(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws
prohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state
can authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances
Act,  which  identifies  marijuana  as  a  Schedule  I  controlled  drug.  Second,  changes  to
state  laws  (and  the  laws  of  the  District  of  Columbia)  concerning  marijuana  use  do  not
alter  the  national  security  adjudicative  guidelines.  And  third,  a  person’s  disregard  of

federal  law  concerning  the  use,  sale,  or  manufacture  of  marijuana  remains  relevant
when making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions:
AG ¶ 25(a) any substance misuse;
AG  ¶  25(c)  illegal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  including
cultivation,  processing,  manufacture,  purchase,  sale,  or  distribution;  or
possession of drug paraphernalia;
AG  ¶  26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment; and
AG  ¶  26(b) the  individual acknowledges  his or her drug  involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including  but  not
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)
changing  or  avoiding  the  environment  where  drugs  were  used;  and  (3)
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility.
I  have  considered  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  drug  involvement  and  substance
misuse,  which  began  in  2009  and  ended  several  years  later  in  late  2016.  Most  of  his
marijuana  use  and  his  twice-use  of  cocaine  occurred  during  a  long-term  relationship
with  a  former  girlfriend,  which  ended  in  separation  in  about  March  2017.  His
involvement with Xanax and the muscle relaxer, as described in the findings of fact, was
not trivial,  but  I  view  his marijuana and  cocaine  use  as  the more  serious matters.  Any
illegal drug  use  is relevant  in  the  context  of evaluating  a  person’s security  worthiness.
His use of marijuana, in particular, is significant because it occurred on a periodic basis
over a period of years. It was not a mere lapse in judgment or an isolated incident, as
shown by the frequency and duration of his use. Moreover, Applicant was not a youthful
college-aged student, as all of his substance misuse occurred when he was working as
a software engineer. These matters militate against a favorable clearance decision.
Nevertheless,  I  am  persuaded  that  Applicant’s drug  involvement  and  substance
misuse  is  now  safely  in  the  past.  It  ended  in  late  2016,  when  he  used  marijuana  at  a
New  Year’s  Eve  party,  which  is  nearly  two  years  before  the  record  closed  here  in
September  2018.  In  other  words,  his  drug  misconduct  is  not  recent.  He  voluntarily
reported the derogatory information about his drug involvement and substance misuse,
and  he  was  truthful  and  complete  in  responding  to  questions  during  the  security
clearance process. He has had no illegal drug involvement or substance misuse during
his  employment  in  the  defense  industry.  He  has  a  good  employment  record  in  the
defense  industry,  and  he  desires  to  continue  that  employment.  I  am  satisfied  that
Applicant  will  continue  to  adhere  to  his employer’s  drug-free  workplace  policy,  that  he
will  adhere  to federal law  concerning  marijuana use,  and  that  he  will abstain from any
further illegal drug involvement or substance misuse.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  or
concerns  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to
protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable  evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.  I
conclude  that  he  met  his  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly
consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  him  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2015. He married in
2011, and has a seven-year-old daughter. He has worked for his current employer since
April 2016. Before then he worked in the restaurant business for 15 years.2
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  June  2016.  He
disclosed  the  following  information.  In  2002,  he  was  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana during a traffic stop. He pleaded not guilty, and was found guilty and convicted
of the charge in 2003. He was sentenced to a year of probation, fines, drug classes, and
community service. He completed the probation attendance requirements, passed all of
the  drug  tests,  attended  the  drug  awareness  classes,  but  failed  to  complete  the
community  service  and  pay  the  fines.  His  probation  was  revoked.  He  completed  the
community service, paid the fines, and was ordered to serve 12 days in the county jail for
the probation violation. He served six days and the remainder was commuted for good
behavior.3
In 2011, Applicant failed a drug test at work while employed at a hotel resort. He
had  been  injured  on  the  job  and  sought  medical  treatment  where  they  administered  a
urinalysis. He tested positive for marijuana.4
In October 2015, Applicant began working as an undergraduate research assistant
for a research laboratory. In April 2016, he was offered a full-time job with the company
and has been employed there since. Two months later in June 2016, he completed his
security clearance application (SCA).5

correspondence. HE II is an excerpt from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th
Edition (DSM-V). Department Counsel requested I take administrative notice of the sections provided. The
request was granted.

In Applicant’s SCA, he disclosed that he was a regular user of marijuana while in
high school and during his restaurant career from June 1999 to January 2016. He also
purchased marijuana during this time. He disclosed the following:
The frequency varied between 1-7 times per week until 2015 when I was
finishing  college.  At  this  time,  I  reduced  my  use  to  1-2  times  per  month,
knowing that drug use would bar me from employment in my field of study.
In 2016, I used once in January in celebration of my graduation and another
use during my employment at the University Coop Bookstore working as an
attendant.6
Section 23 of the SCA asked if he intended to use this drug or controlled substance in the
future and he replied “no.” He provided the following explanation:
I  am  concerned  that  further  use  will  directly  conflict  with  my  employment
with a federal contractor. For this, I will avoid further use. Also, I now wish
to be a better role model for my daughter who is coming to an age where
she is very aware and deserves to see that her parents are willing to live
well in the face of temptation.7
Applicant testified that at the time he made the statement on his SCA, his intention
was not to use marijuana, and he made the statement in good-faith.8
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  June  2017.  He
disclosed  that  since  he  completed  his  SCA  in  June  2016,  he  had  used  marijuana
approximately 20 times. He used it with family and friends. In 2016, he used it on July 4th,
Halloween, Christmas, New Year’s Eve, and at a friend’s party. He said the reason for his
use was because he enjoys it recreationally and as an alternative to alcohol, which upsets
his stomach. It relaxes and makes him comfortable. He told the investigator that he would
prefer to continue using marijuana because he enjoys it and many of his family and friends
use  it.  He  continues  to  associate  with  them  and  uses  it  at  their  homes.  He  had  not
purchased  marijuana  after  January  2016,  but  uses  it  when  provided  by  his family  and
friends.  He  did  not  intend  to  purchase  it  in  the  future.  He  did  not  feel  dependent  on
marijuana.  He  stated  that  his  marijuana  uses  has  not  had  any  impact  on  his  work,
finances,  school,  home,  family  or  friends,  all  of  whom  are  aware  of  his  use.  He  said
marijuana  use  has  had  no  impact  on  his  personality,  judgment,  reliability,  or  ability  to
maintain a confidence.9

Applicant testified that when he was interviewed by the investigator he said he had
used marijuana 20 times since completing his SCA. He stated that his use was between
10 and 20 times. He confirmed he told the investigator that he preferred to continue using
marijuana because he enjoyed using it recreationally, but this was a preference and not
an intention. He confirmed that at the time he completed his SCA, he told the investigator
that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because he was concerned it would
impact federal employment. He testified that he had a few  “slips” since completing the
SCA, and he will avoid future use.10
Applicant  testified  that  after  he  was  interviewed  in  June  2017,  he  received
government  interrogatories  and  was  asked  to  review  the  statement  he  made  to  the
investigator. He confirmed the accuracy of his statement and signed the interrogatories
in March 2018. Applicant did not disclose in the interrogatory that he continued to use
marijuana after his June 2017 interview until November 2017. He explained his use in
November 2017 was in a social setting with old friends. He said it seemed harmless at
the time. He said he has disassociated himself from these friends and others friends who
use marijuana. The family members with whom Applicant has used marijuana in the past
were his mother and sister. He still associates with them. His wife does not use marijuana.
He  stated  he  has  not used marijuana  since November  2017 because  he  realized  how
serious his conduct was.11
In May 2018, Applicant signed a statement of intent to never use illegal drugs again
and  to  refrain  from  associating  with  drug  using  individuals  and  to  avoid  environments
where drug use is prevalent. He provided negative drug test results from May, August,
October, November 2018,  and  January  and  March  2019.  Applicant  paid for these  and
decided when to take the tests. The tests were not random and Applicant decided when
he would take them. In April 2018, at his request, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed
professional  counselor  for  his  marijuana  use.  She  diagnosed  him  under  DSM-V  with
cannabis  abuse,  in  remission.  He  explained  that  he  requested  the  psychological
evaluation because he thought it would be valuable to show he was of sound mind and
capable of making well thought out decisions. In May 2018, he completed an eight hour
online  marijuana  education  program  that  provided  techniques  on  how  to  refrain  from
marijuana use.12
In Applicant’s May 2018 answer to the SOR, he admitted he used and purchased
marijuana  from  June  1999  to  June  2017.  He  explained  that  when  he  began  using
marijuana he did not know that he would be seeking a security clearance later in his life.
He stated that he made the poor decision that the consequences of marijuana use were
worth the risk. He has now educated himself about marijuana use. He explained that his
marijuana use after completing his SCA was a severe lapse in judgment. He believed he

was strong enough at the time to abstain but did not make the necessary life changes to
remain drug free. In times of weakness, he believed that not purchasing marijuana was
sufficient but then found he used it when it was provided to him by others. He said he did
not realize the severe effect his use could have, but he has since realized what is at stake,
and he will no longer use it. He said that previously he had not taken the necessary steps,
but now he has, and there is no likelihood of future drug use. His perception has changed,
as he has become aware of the costs associated with his drug use and the impact it could
have on his family’s finances, especially if he went to jail.13
Applicant was asked if he had attempted to stop using marijuana in the past. He
stated that he took breaks in his use when he had upcoming job interviews and after his
daughter was born. He admitted that the reason he stopped using marijuana before a job
interview was because he might have to take a drug test. He said in the past, he had to
take  pre-employment  drug  tests  and  wanted  to  be  clean.  He  then  went  back  to  using
marijuana after the test. He also tried to stop after he completed his SCA, but admitted
he failed. When asked what has changed, he said  the consequence for using it are so
great as well as the loss of his integrity at work. He is aware that possession and use of
marijuana is illegal in his state. He used marijuana while working for a defense contractor.
He did not know if his supervisor at the time was aware of his drug use. He said that his
perception of illegal drug use has changed now that he has abstained for a period.14
A coworker who has worked with Applicant for two years testified on his behalf. He
considered Applicant a reliable coworker who has a good reputation and is an important
member of their team. Applicant follows all of the required security protocols. They have
participated in activities outside of work that were family oriented. He considers Applicant
honest. He believed Applicant was involved in an isolated incident of marijuana use. They
have never discussed Applicant’s prior drug use.15
A  senior-level  employee  testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  He  has  worked  for  their
employer for 15 years, and he is a project manager. He has worked with Applicant for the
past  three  years.  They  worked  on  the  same  project  for  a  year  and  half  and  had  daily
contact.  They  work  on  different  projects  now  and  see  each  other  about  three  times  a
week. He considers Applicant extremely reliable and motivated. He noted that Applicant
played an important role on a project. He said that the team was involved in all types of
security and protocols, and Applicant was serious about security. The witness testified
that  he  was  aware  Applicant had  some  involvement  with  illegal drugs  when  he  was  in
high school in that he was caught with marijuana. The witness was unaware of Applicant’s
other drug use or while serving on the team. He confirmed that their employer has a drug
policy and all employees are made aware of it when they are processed for employment.16

Applicant provided a character letter from his supervisor. Applicant had worked for
him  when  he  was  part  of  a  research  project  during  his  senior  year  of  college.  His
supervisor  noted  that  Applicant’s  skillset,  trustworthiness  and  outstanding  character
spurred  him  to  hire  him  full  time  after  graduation.  He  was  deemed  a  hard  worker,
completing tasks outside of work hours to meet deadlines. Applicant was self-motivated
and  focused,  which  lead  to  the  success  of  the  project.  He  was  professional,  attentive,
punctual, knowledgeable, honest, and reliable. The supervisor was aware of Applicant’s
“past  marijuana  use.”  He  noted  it  did  not  have  an  effect  on  Applicant’s  ability  to  think
clearly,  make  professional  decisions,  and  there  were  no  deficiencies  in  Applicant’s
character and honesty.17
Applicant  provided  other  character  letters  that  state  he  is  reliable,  honest,

performance typically exceeded expectations. He earned his Eagle Scout award in 200118

"The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant purchased and used marijuana
with varying frequency from approximately January 2014 through May 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.a)
and that Applicant continued to use and purchase marijuana after she had been granted a
DOD interim secret clearance in October 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.b). (Item 1.) In her Answer to the
SOR, Applicant admitted that she purchased and used marijuana between the dates of
January 2014 and May 2017, but only during two discrete periods: in January 2014, when
she experimented with the drug occasionally after it became legal in her state, and in May
2017 to cope with several life stressors, including the breakup with her then fiancé, the
flooding  of  her  apartment,  and  an  impending  layoff.  Applicant  admitted  to  a  lapse  of
judgment in using marijuana while she held an interim clearance, but asked that the fact
that she self-reported the information be considered in mitigation.
After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 3),
I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 34 years old and unmarried. She has an associate’s degree in criminal
justice awarded in May 2009 and additional college credits earned between January 2011
and August 2012. She has been employed as a security analyst with a defense contractor
since  June  2016,  and  in  October  2016,  she  was  granted  an  interim  Secret  security
clearance. (Items 3-5.)
Applicant worked as a fraud agent in the online payment sector from February 2008
to September 2013. She left the job voluntarily to move to her current state of residence.
From  November  2013  to  April  2015,  she  worked  as  a  project  manager  for  a  start-up
company involved in service delivery management. After recreational use of marijuana
became  legal  in  the  state,1  Applicant  purchased  marijuana  from  a  state-licensed
dispensary, and she used the drug “through the month” of January 2014 into February
2014. (Items 3-5.) Her stated reason for using the drug was that it became legal to do so.
(Item 4.)
From April 2015 to June 2016, Applicant was employed as an investigator for a
financial  investment  company.  She  left  for  a  higher-paying  position  with  her  current
employer in June 2016. On August 23, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the
accuracy  of  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions2  (SF  86)  on  which  she
responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether she had illegally used any drugs
or controlled substances in the last seven years. She disclosed that she purchased and
smoked marijuana from January 2014 to February 2014 after marijuana use became legal
in her state. She responded “No” to whether she intended to use marijuana in the future,
and stated, “I do not intend to use this drug in the future as the decision to purchase and
smoke marijuana was only related to the passing of the law making it legal.” (Item 4.)
1 Effective December 2012, the state legalized the recreational use of marijuana for persons 21 years or older.
Possession, using, displaying, purchasing, or transporting marijuana accessories or one ounce or less of
marijuana is not considered unlawful. Retail establishments for the sale of marijuana have been operating
since January 2014. Selling, distributing, or transferring marijuana to individuals under age 21, and driving
under  the  influence of marijuana remain illegal.  Under Section 18-18-406 of the pertinent state statutes,
possession of more than 12 ounces of marijuana or more than three ounces of marijuana concentrate is a
level 4 drug felony. Possession of more than six ounces but less than 12 ounces of marijuana or not more
than three ounces of marijuana concentrate is a level 1 drug misdemeanor. Possession of more than two
ounces but not more than six ounces of marijuana is a level 2 drug misdemeanor. Possession of not more
than two ounces of marijuana is a drug petty offense punishable by a fine of not more than $100. Open and
public display, consumption, or use of two ounces or less of marijuana is a drug petty offense punishable by a
fine of up to $100 and up to 24 hours of community service. There is an exception from criminal prosecution
under § 18-1-711 for any person who suffers or reports an emergency drug overdose event. Transferring or
dispensing  not  more  than  two  ounces  of  marijuana  from  one  person  to  another  for  no  consideration  is
considered a drug petty offense and not a sale. However, it is unlawful (a level 1 drug misdemeanor) for a
person to transfer marijuana at no cost if the transfer is related in any way to remuneration for a product or
service.
2 The SF 86 in the FORM (Item 4) is missing pages 30 and 31 involving section 22 inquiries concerning police
record information. There are no SOR allegations pertaining to a police record.
Applicant turned to marijuana in 2017, perhaps as early as January 2017,3 to cope
with anxiety and depression after breaking up with her fiancé. She purchased marijuana
from a legal dispensary and used the drug approximately twice a week for about five weeks
from April 2017 to May 2017. (Items 3, 5.)
On September 22, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Regarding any illegal use of drugs in the last
seven years, Applicant reportedly disclosed that she used marijuana throughout the month
of January 2014; randomly since then; and about twice a week between April 2017 and
May 2017. She attributed her 2014 use of marijuana to its legalization and her recent use
to  coping  with  anxiety  after  breaking  up  with  her  now  former  fiancé.  She  bought  the
marijuana  for  her  personal  use  from  a  dispensary  and  smoked  it  alone  at  home.  She
expressed her belief that she had matured since then. She denied any intention to use
marijuana again because she has acquired better coping skills like yoga and meditation
and  because  she  did  not  want  to  jeopardize  her  current  employment  with  a  defense
contractor. (Item 5.)
On  March  26,  2018,  DOHA  sent  interrogatories  to  Applicant.  She  indicated  in
response on May 5, 2018, that she was in the process of being weaned from an anti-
depressant medication under the care of her physician. Asked to list any involvement with
non-prescribed drugs since January 1, 2014, Applicant reported that she used marijuana
about ten times from April 2017 to May 2017 and that she had purchased the marijuana
from a licensed dispensary. Applicant indicated that she had stopped using illegal drugs in
May 2017; that she has no unused drugs or paraphernalia in her possession; and that she
does not associate with any persons who use illegal drugs or frequent places where she
has reason to believe drugs are being used or are used in her presence. Applicant was
provided a copy of the report of her interview with the OPM investigator. She made no
corrections to the information reported about her marijuana use and purchases. (Item 5.)
On  June  20,  2018,  the  DOD  CAF  issued  an  SOR  to  Applicant  because  of  her
marijuana use and purchases, including after she had been granted an interim Secret
clearance in October 2016. In response to the SOR, Applicant indicated on July 6, 2018,
that she had purchased and used marijuana, but only during two discrete periods, those
being  during  the  month  of  January  2014  when  she  experimented  with  the  drug
occasionally,  and  then  in  May  2017  after  she  had  been  granted  an  interim  clearance.
About her more recent involvement, she stated in part:
There were a number of life events leading up to May 2017 including the loss
of my fiancé, an apartment flood that ruined the majority of my belongings,
and an impending layoff at my job due to an acquisition.4 My mental health
3 After discussing the reason for Applicant’s use in 2017, the OPM investigator reported, “Subject started using
marijuana in this case from 01/2017 to 04/2017.” Applicant was given an opportunity to review the summary of
her interview, and she did not address that statement. (Item 5.)
4 Regarding any acquisition, it is noted that Applicant submitted a handwritten response on stationery of a
security company other than that named on her SF 86, although DOHA sent the SOR to her through the
company named on her SF 86.
took a hit during this time and I became very depressed. I was having trouble
functioning during the day and was unable to sleep at night. I purchased and
used marijuana at this time (approximately 10 times).
She attributed her 2017 use of marijuana to “an unfortunate lapse in judgment and
an attempt to sleep after having not properly done so for some time. She asked that her full
disclosure of her marijuana use on her SF 86 and during her OPM interview be considered
as evidence of her good character. She also added that she also self-reported that the
OPM investigator has used the information from her SF 86 to contact her and ask her out,
and she complied with all inquiries in that regard. (Answer.)
The guidance provided by various U.S. government entities makes it clear that no
state can authorize violations of federal law, existing suitability criteria, or Executive Branch
policies. Federal agencies are prohibited from granting or renewing a security clearance to
an unlawful user of a controlled substance or an addict. Executive Order 12564 mandates
a  drug-free  federal  workplace.  An  individual’s  disregard  of  federal  law  pertaining  to
marijuana remains relevant to the suitability determination. From a prosecutorial standpoint
priorities of the Department of Justice are to prevent the following: distribution of marijuana
to minors; revenue from marijuana sales from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and
cartels; diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states;
use of state-authorized marijuana as a cover for trafficking of other illegal drugs; use of
firearms and other violence in cultivation and distribution of marijuana; drugged-driving
associated with marijuana use; growth of marijuana on public lands; and possession or use
of  marijuana  on  federal  property.  Jurisdictions  that  had  implemented  regulations  for
marijuana activity are expected to provide the resources and demonstrate the willingness
to  enforce  their  laws  and  regulations  in  a  manner  that  does  not  undermine  federal
enforcement priorities. (Items 6-11.)

with his employment.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.    Applicant  has  a  history  of  illegal  drug  use  that  includes  his  use  of
marijuana from about July 2000 to at least October 2017; including from about 2010 to
October 2017, while holding a security clearance.
Applicant attended college from 2005 to 2010.   He stated that during college he
used  marijuana  one  time.    After  graduating,  in  February  2010,  he  was  hired  by  his
current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  and  applied for a  security  clearance  which  he
was  granted.    Applicant  testified  that  when  he  completed  the  security  clearance
questionnaire in 2010, he did not intend on ever using marijuana again.  (Tr. p. 20.)
From 2010 to 2017, while holding a security clearance, Applicant used marijuana
on  at  least  four  separate  occasions.      He  stated  that  he  used  it  with  friends  at  social
events.  On at least two occasions, he stated to the investigator that he used marijuana
due  to  peer  pressure.    (Government  Exhibit  2.)    Throughout  this  period,  Applicant
received annual security briefings at work, and was aware of DoD policy as well as his
company  policy  prohibiting  the  use  of  illegal  drugs  while  holding  a  security  clearance.
(Tr. pp. 37 - 38.)
In  June  2017,  Applicant  completed  another  security  clearance  application,  and
was  later  interviewed  by  an  investigator  on  August  15,  2017.    On  the  application  and
during the interview, Applicant expressed his intent to continue to use marijuana in the
future.     At the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that he no  longer intends  to  use marijuana.
He states that he now realizes his poor choices in the past concerning his illegal drug
use.  To try and be a better person he voluntarily enrolled in a 16-hour, two-day course,
called  “Primed  for  Life”  sponsored  by  the  Marine  Corps.    (Applicant’s  Exhibit  E.)    He
states that it was an eye-opener for him.  (Tr. p. 23.)
Applicant submitted a Statement of Intent dated December 3, 2018, swearing to
never  use  marijuana  or  any  other  illegal  substance  again.    He  stated  that  he  now
understands the seriousness of his illegal drug use while holding a security clearance.
He states that he no longer associates with anyone who uses illegal drugs, or anyone
who places him in situations where marijuana is freely available, except his brother.  He
further  states  that  any  future  misuse  of  any  illegal  drug  will  be  grounds  for  immediate
revocation of his national security eligibility.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)
A  letter  from  the  Applicant’s  lead  engineer  dated  November  1,  2018,  indicates
that Applicant exhibits good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  He is described
as  a  great  asset  to  the  team.      He  is  recommended  for  a  security  clearance.
(Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
A  letter  from  a  coworker  dated  November  6,  2018,  who  has  worked  with  the
Applicant  since  2011,  reflects  that  Applicant  is  considered  to  be  an  excellent,
dependable,  honest,  and  responsible  employee.    Applicant  is  known  to  always  follow
proper  procedures  in  protecting  classified  information.    He  still  works  in  the  classified
area on a weekly basis.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Performance  reviews  of  the  Applicant  for  the  period  from  January  1,  2015,

"Applicant is a 36-year-old computer programmer for a defense contractor, employed
since 2017. He was fired from a previous position in 2016 due to “drug issues,” although
Applicant denied using drugs while with that employer, and denied that he departed for
that  reason.  He  received  a  general  education  degree  (GED)  in  lieu  of  a  high  school
diploma. He is unmarried, but has lived with his fiancée since 2012. He has never held a
DOD security clearance.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  H  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency from October 2001 to at least February 2017. The SOR also alleged an arrest in
2002 for possession of marijuana and driving under the influence of drugs; a 2003 arrest
for possession of narcotic equipment and possession of marijuana with intent to sell; a 2007
arrest for unlawful distribution of a controlled substance and possession of one ounce of
marijuana;  a  2015  arrest  for  interference  with  the  arresting  officer,  use  or  possession  of
drug  paraphernalia,  and  possession  of  a  controlled  substance  (marijuana/spice);  and  a
2017  arrest  for  speeding,  possession  of  controlled  substance  (marijuana/spice)  and  two
counts of use or possession of drug paraphernalia.
Applicant admitted the allegations, but denied using marijuana after about October
2015. He noted some charges from the 2003 arrest were dismissed, and all of the charges
from the 2015 and 2017 arrests were dismissed. Applicant provided a document from the
relevant court with his Answer to the SOR, showing that he entered guilty pleas to the 2017
charges  of  possession  of  controlled  substance,  and  use  or  possession  of  drug
paraphernalia.
Applicant discussed his history of marijuana purchases, possession, and use during
his personal subject interview (PSI) by a Government investigator. He stated that he began
experimenting with marijuana in about 2001, and continued to purchase and use it about
150 times between 2001 and 2015. He noted that while using marijuana, it would affect his
ability to hold confidences and that it caused him to often call in sick to work. He has never
received drug treatment and his fiancée is aware of his drug-use history.
In 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana, which
was dismissed while the driving under the influence of drugs charge resulted in a conviction.
He was unable to recall the circumstances because of the time elapsed since the incident.
In  2003,  Applicant’s  car  was  searched  incident  to  a  traffic  stop  after  the  officer  smelled
marijuana. Applicant and the driver were arrested for possession of marijuana with intent
to sell and possession of drug paraphernalia. He was convicted and sentenced to serve
365 days in jail (all but 60 days suspended), fined, and three years’ probation.
In 2007, Applicant was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia and unlawful
distribution of a controlled substance. He was convicted  of possession of marijuana and
unlawful  distribution.  He  was  sentenced  to  180  days  confinement  and  fined.  In  2015,
Applicant  was  again  involved  in  a  traffic  stop  when  the  officer  searched  his  vehicle  and
found marijuana. Applicant claimed it was for his personal use. The charges of obstruction
of justice and possession of marijuana were dismissed because the officer failed to obtain
a  search  warrant.  In  2017,  an  officer  smelled  marijuana  incident  to  a  traffic  stop,  and
discovered  marijuana  in  a backpack  in  Applicant’s  car.  Applicant  claimed  that  someone,
whom  he  refused  to  name,  used  his  car  and  left  the  backpack  in  it.  Despite  his  claim,
Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  charges  of  possession  of  a  controlled  substance  and  use  or
possession of drug paraphernalia; however, the plea was held in abeyance for six months
and dismissed if Applicant refrained from similar offenses and paid a fine. Applicant asked
the  court  to  terminate  his  “plea  in  abeyance”  early  because  of  his  pending  security
clearance investigation.
Applicant  noted  that  his  career,  fiancée,  and  intent  to  start  a  family  were  more
important than using marijuana. He thought the medical aspects of marijuana would help
him with anxiety, but it had the opposite effect of making him paranoid and more anxious.
Since Applicant elected to have this case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing,
I was unable to further inquire into these allegations or evaluate his demeanor or credibility
in  response  to  questions.  He  did  not  submit  documentary  evidence  of  drug  abuse
counseling, changes in lifestyle, or a signed statement of intent to abstain from further drug
involvement.
Law and Policies
The  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (DNI)  issued  revised  adjudicative  guidelines
(AG) in a Security Executive Agent Directive, effective on June 8, 2017. These AGs are
applicable to this decision.
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to “control
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President has
authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access
to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained  in  the adjudicative  guidelines. These  guidelines are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The  Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  persons  with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures  throughout  off-duty  hours.  Decisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified
information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in no
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has
not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established
for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from being
eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  “Substantial evidence”  is
“more  than  a  scintilla  but  less  than  a  preponderance.”  See  v.  Washington  Metro.  Area
Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or rational
connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed  therein  and  an
applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20,
2015).
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence,
the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive
¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of
disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App.

Guideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
",False
"Applicant  is  alleged  under  Guideline  H  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  cross-alleged  under
Guideline  E  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  to  have  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
approximately  November  2012  to  at  least  December  2017,  and  to  have  purchased
marijuana with varying frequency from approximately November 2012 to at least December
2017 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.a). When he answered the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted that
he had used marijuana as alleged and that he had purchased marijuana, but that his last
purchase  was  in  2016  or  perhaps  January  or  February  2017.  After  considering  his
response to the SOR, the exhibits, and the hearing transcript, I make the following findings
of fact:
Applicant  is  a  25-year-old  systems  engineer.  He  has  Bachelor’s  and  Master’s
degrees in mechanical engineering, and has been employed by a defense contractor since
June 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 21-22.) He has never held a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 25.)
Applicant  started  college  in  September  2012.  He  began  using  marijuana  in
November 2012 because he wanted to try it. He performed well on his mid-terms, and so
he decided to continue to use a drug that he enjoyed, even though he knew that it was
illegal.  He  used  marijuana  throughout  college  until  January  2017,  at  a  frequency  that
“varied quite a bit.” At one point during his freshman year, he may have used marijuana
“five times a week.” Other times, he went five to six months without using marijuana. He
used marijuana primarily while socializing with close friends, and the marijuana was usually
provided to him at no cost. He used marijuana in all kinds of forms—joints, bongs, pipes,
and  edibles—depending  on  what  his  friends  had.  He  purchased  marijuana  in  small
quantities at a cost of less than $50 on a handful of occasions, about once a year, to at
least  September  2016.  Applicant  purchased  the  marijuana  from  friends  of  friends.  He
estimates that he spent $200 to $300 for marijuana over five years. He shared with friends
some of the marijuana he purchased. He drove a vehicle after smoking marijuana only
once, which was either during his junior or senior year of college. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 26-33, 45.)
After earning his Master’s degree in May 2017, Applicant began working for his
current employer. He passed a pre-employment drug screen, and received training about
his employer’s policies, including that illegal drug use is prohibited. (Tr. 23.) On July 12,
2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National
Security  Positions  (SF  86)  on  which  he  disclosed  that  he  had  used  and  purchased
marijuana. He indicated that he was an “infrequent user” of marijuana between November
2012 and January 2017, but he had stopped using the drug. He denied any intention to use
marijuana in the future but then explained:
The state of [name omitted] has made it legal despite it currently being illegal
under federal law. I do not have any plans to smoke in the near future. I,
however, might if it is made legal under federal law.
Applicant also responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning any illegal purchase
of a drug or controlled substance in the last seven years. He indicated that he bought
marijuana between February 2013 and September 2016 in small amounts, “less than $50
worth, on a handful of occasions throughout college.” He denied any intention to purchase
marijuana in the future. (GE 1; Tr. 26.) Applicant understood that his use of marijuana
could be an issue for his security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 26.)
On January 30, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), primarily to discuss his marijuana use and
purchase. Applicant explained that he smoked marijuana in college with friends, but he
also experimented with edibles. Most of the time, he obtained his marijuana free of charge
from friends who had it, but that once a year, he purchased marijuana from friends of
friends. Applicant stated that he stopped using marijuana because he got bored of it, but
he  also  volunteered  that  he  used  marijuana  at  the  party  hosted  by  four  of  his  former
roommates on December 31, 2017. He took some puffs from a marijuana joint passed to
him by friends of friends.1  Applicant acknowledged that he knew using marijuana was
illegal  under  federal  law  and  that  his  employer  had  a  policy  prohibiting  illegal  drug
involvement.  However,  he  expressed  his  belief  that  marijuana  should  be  legalized.
Reminded  by  the  investigator  that  drug  use  violates  not  only  federal  law  but  also  his
employer’s policy, he expressed a belief that his employer should not be able to infringe on
his personal use. Applicant stated that he has no current intentions of using marijuana but
he may in the future. He reportedly acknowledged that he still associated with persons
involved  with  marijuana  and  named  nine  individuals,  including  one  of  the  character
references he named on his SF 86 and a friend from college  (friend X) with whom he
smoked marijuana in the past. Applicant explained that his friends knew of his marijuana
1 At his hearing, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana at the party but not with his former roommates. He
denied ever using marijuana with the friends who hosted the party. (Tr. 35-36.)
use but his family did not. Applicant admitted that he had not notified security officials at
work about his recent marijuana use. (GE 2.)
DOHA sent interrogatories to Applicant in March 2018 about his drug use. Asked to
detail his use of marijuana from November 2012 to date, Applicant responded that he used
cannabis from November 2012 to December 2017. He denied ever purchasing marijuana.
Regarding his future intentions, Applicant stated, “Not interested in smoking. Does not
provide me any benefits. My friends don’t smoke. Impacts my workouts. Waste of money.”
Applicant was given the summary of the OPM investigator’s report of his January 2018
interview and was advised he could make corrections to the report. With regard to his
reported continued association with drug users, Applicant indicated on March 21, 2018,2
that the names listed “do not reflect people involved in drug activity.” Instead, he named
those persons with whom he socializes on a regular basis and he added, “All of them
currently have no drug activity to the best of my knowledge. Some have never taken a drug
illegally.” In a separate handwritten statement, he listed eight of the nine persons identified
in the interview summary (including the four former roommates that hosted the December
2017 party at which he used marijuana but not college friend X) and expressed his belief
that they would all pass a drug test today. Applicant explained that he omitted friend X
because he lives outside the area, and indicated that he was unaware about  friend X’s
current relationship with marijuana. Applicant added, “I have not smoked marijuana since
the year 2017. I do not intend to [use marijuana] in the future.” (GE 2.)
Applicant has not told security officials at work about his marijuana use. He testified
that the OPM interviewer told him security would be notified through the security process.
(Tr. 24, 40-41.) Applicant briefly discussed with his co-workers and managers the issue of
his drug use “but not in maybe a full disclosure kind of sense.” He is not currently required
to possess a security clearance to maintain his employment. (Tr. 23-24.)
Applicant last used marijuana at the party held on December 31, 2017, perhaps
during the early hours of January 1, 2018. (Tr. 27.) To his recollection, he last purchased
marijuana in September 2016. (Tr. 28.) As to why he used marijuana at the New Year’s
Eve party, Applicant testified that he was frustrated that he had not heard back about his
clearance eligibility, particularly where he knew of some co-workers who had either lied on
their clearance forms or continued to smoke marijuana while employed, and he had been
“honest and upfront” about his marijuana use. Also he was considering leaving his job with
the  defense  contractor  because  he  did  not  have  very  interesting  work,  and  he  had  “a
carefree attitude” in that he “felt as though it would not matter and it wouldn’t come back to
bite [him].” (Tr. 33-34.) Applicant disagrees with his employer’s prohibition against illegal
drug use by its employees, but he has followed it since his last use at the New Year’s Eve
party. (Tr. 38.)
Applicant  has  friends  who  smoke  marijuana.  In  the  six  months  preceding  his
February 2018 hearing, Applicant has been in the presence of others using marijuana
approximately six times to as recently as late 2018 or early 2019. Some of the friends who
2 Applicant’s response was returned to him on April 4, 2018, to obtain a notarized signature. Applicant signed
the document before a notary on May 3, 2018. (GE 2.)
used marijuana in his presence were named in his March 2018 response to interrogatories
as persons who he claimed would pass a drug screen because they were not then using
marijuana.  When asked to explain the discrepancy, Applicant indicated that those friends
had not used marijuana in several months as of March 2018, but that he knows them to
have used marijuana since then. He then indicated that it was “probably not accurate” for
him to have stated in March 2018 that he was not associating with any known drug users.
He meant to state that the friends with whom he spent most of his time were not using
drugs. He denied knowing whether they currently use marijuana but acknowledged that the
friends have used marijuana in his presence in the last six months; that he continues to
socialize with them; and that they have offered him some marijuana, including after he had
told them that he cannot smoke marijuana because of his job. He indicated that he has
made it clear to them that he is “not looking to smoke.” (Tr. 41-45, 48-49.) When asked
why he continued to associate with known drug users while a hearing was pending for his
clearance eligibility, Applicant responded:
So oftentimes, I do leave the room, if there’s a specific room. I would say I
now have family members that grow marijuana, a cousin of mine,3 you know,
that they’ve been—I would say, they’re—it’s—if I had to disassociate myself
entirely, where there was any possibility that someone smoked weed, I would
have to have significant social change. (Tr. 48.)

"The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  G,  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
alcohol consumption, including after treatment. Applicant was also charged with alcohol-
related offenses including: two charges in 1997 for underage possession of alcohol, and
driving while intoxicated (DWI) with a minor under 15 years old. The SOR cross-alleged
the DWI arrest under Guideline J, criminal conduct. Additionally, the SOR alleges under
Guideline  H  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  from  1993  to  at  least  2015,  including  while
holding  a  security  clearance  in  2015,  and  misused  two  prescription  medications  from
September to October 2011, while holding a security clearance.  In Applicant’s answer,
she admitted all of the allegations with explanations, except she denied the extent of her
alcohol use after treatment, and denied use of marijuana after 2000, except for one time
in  May  2015.  The  record  evidence  substantially  supports  the  SOR  allegations.  After a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 40-year-old software engineer, employed by a defense contractor
since 2001. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2001. She married in 2005 and divorced
in 2013. She has two children, ages 12 and 17. She has held a security clearance since
2003.
Applicant was twice cited for underage possession of alcohol in 1997, while a 19-
year-old  college  student,  and  also  used  marijuana  on  occasion  until  2000.  Applicant
began working for her current employer after graduating from college in 2001. She was
married  in  2005  to  a  recovering  alcoholic.  Applicant  struggled  with  her  weight,  and  in
2010, she had gastric bypass surgery and was getting knee injections for arthritis. She
was prescribed pain medications because she could no longer use over-the-counter pain
medication  after  surgery.  At  times,  she  used  the  medications  even  after  the  pain
subsided, so it was not in compliance with the prescription directions.
Applicant  considered  herself  a  social  drinker,  but  her  beer  and  wine  use  also
increased  after  bypass  surgery  as  a  substitute  for  food.  She  stopped  drinking  in
September 2011, but had increased anxiety and depression. She was having difficulty in
her marriage and her children had behavioral issues. She stopped drinking in September
2011,  sought  counseling  in  October  2011  for  anxiety  and  depression,  and  was
recommended  to  include  treatment  for  alcohol  abuse.  She  was  tapered  off  the
prescription  medications  as  they  were  not  permitted  during  treatment,  and  began
treatment  for  alcohol  abuse,  anxiety,  and  depression.  She  denied  ever  receiving  a
diagnosis.  She  reported  her  treatment  to  her  employer,  continued  with  Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA), and successfully abstained from her self-imposed alcohol use until she
relapsed in 2015.
In 2013, Applicant and her spouse divorced, and, at the same time, her employer
transferred her job to another state. She moved as a single mother of two children, with
no friends, family, or other support. In 2015, Applicant’s parents were visiting and helped
her move from a rental property. After the move was completed, her father offered her
alcohol. She had two mixed drinks, and, without feeling any effects, drove to a drug store
for bath products when she suddenly felt the effects of the alcohol. Her nine-year-old son
met her outside and insisted on riding to the store with her. She ran a red light, and was
struck by another car. She was cited for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and was convicted
of misdemeanor DWI, fined, ordered to complete community  service, probation for two
years, and required to use an ignition interlock device. One month later, after returning
from work, Applicant stopped at a friend’s house, drank, and used marijuana offered by
the friend. This was her first and only use of marijuana since 2000, and was related to her
drinking on that day.
On advice of her friend, Applicant checked herself into a hospital outpatient eight-
week alcohol treatment program with a psychiatrist, and reported that she was suffering
from anxiety, stress, and being counseled at work for taking too many sick days. In 2015,
Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent but met criteria for early partial remission.
She  was  advised  to  stop  drinking,  and  was  prescribed  Antabuse  to  assist  her  with
cravings.  She  stopped  using  alcohol,  has  successfully  continued  Antabuse  without
incident, successfully completed the two-year ignition interlock program without incident,
and regularly attends AA and counseling with a therapist. Her psychiatrist and therapist
provided  positive  letters  of  support,  indicating  that  she  has  been  compliant  with  her
medications, attendance at AA and church. She has an AA sponsor and she is making
improvements in her mental health. Her AA sponsor wrote of her daily work with Applicant
since  2015,  and  despite  a  one-day  relapse  at  a  cookout  in  July  2017,  Applicant
reestablished sobriety immediately and reported her relapse in her AA meeting and to her
counselor.
Applicant’s friend testified on her behalf, was aware of her history and relapses,
and noted her efforts at sobriety as discussed above. Her friend, was very supportive of
her recovery. Her psychiatrist noted Applicant has developed better insight and is using
good  judgment.  With  continued  compliance  with  recommended  treatment,  Applicant’s
prognosis is “very good.”
Applicant  was  straightforward,  open  and  honest
testimony.  She
acknowledged her struggle with alcohol, but was encouraged by her efforts at sobriety,
abstinence, and treatment. She has made friends, and now has personal support that has
substantially  reduced  her  stress  and  anxiety.  Applicant’s  ex-spouse,  neighbor, friends,
in  her
church members, and employment team leader strongly support her, noting Applicant’s
friendship, love for her children, loyalty, and honesty.
Since 2017, Applicant noted that she has performed well at work, winning several
awards,  including  a  prestigious,  global company-wide  award  from  the  company’s chief
executive officer. This award noted Applicant’s energy, ingenuity, and integrity. She has
exceeded performance standards, and has a history of receiving monetary awards. She
believes her home-life is stable, understands how to deal with stress, regularly uses her
Antabuse medication and meets with her counselor and sponsor, and vowed to continue
to abstain from any further alcohol or drug use.

"In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  the  allegation  in  the  SOR.  I  adopt  his
admission as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  40  years  old.  He  is  married  with  one  child.  He  has  worked  for  his
current  employer,  a  federal  contractor,  since  April  2007.  He  attended  college  for
approximately three years, but did not receive a degree.1
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency  from
approximately  June  1998  to  April  2017.  In  October  2017,  he  admitted  to  a  defense
investigator that he used marijuana about once every three months from June 1998 to
January  2017  (which  post-dated  the  completion  of  his  SCA).  He  further  described  his
use  of  marijuana  as  using  it  with  friends  or  family  in  their  homes.  He  claims  to  have
stopped his use when his wife became pregnant (no date in the record for this event).
He  further  claims  he  will  not  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  In  April  2018,  when  he
completed interrogatories sent to him concerning this case, he was unable to recall the
dates of his use of marijuana. His employer has a workplace drug policy that comports
with  the  “Drug-Free  Work  Force  rules  issued  by  the  DOD.”  Since  Applicant  submitted
this  case  for  an  administrative  determination,  I  was  not  able  to  judge  his  credibility
based on demeanor.2
",False
"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted,  with  explanation,  that  he  used
marijuana with varying frequency from about April 2012 to at least July 2017. He denied
the  three  collection  accounts:  SOR  1.a  ($9,521),  SOR  1.b  ($1,259),  and  SOR  1.c
($1,016), which totaled approximately $11,800. After a thorough review of the pleadings
and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old manager of concessions at a stadium, but has accepted
a position as a technical office manager for a defense contractor if he obtains a security
clearance. (Item 3) He is married and has a daughter age 3 and a son age 8. From April
1999 to August 2003 he honorably served in the U.S. Marine Corps. Applicant receives
disability payments from the U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA). He is 100 percent
disabled due to his service-connected disabilities. (Item 2, Tab F) He is considered totally
and  permanently  disabled.  The  record  is  silent  as  to  the  amount  of  disability  pay  he
receives.
In 2002, while in the Marine Corps, Applicant was a Marine military police officer
and sustained a back injury while extracting an inmate from a cell. (Item 4) He had also
sustained a knee injury while on active duty. He suffers from degenerative disk disease
and has chronic back pain. (Item 2) In April 2012, the VA determined he is 100 percent
disabled.  (Item  2,  Tab  F)  The  VA  had  directed  that  Applicant  obtain  counseling  for
depression  and  anxiety  associated  with  his  back  injury.  (Item  4)  The  VA  prescribed
Vicodin to manage his pain, but the medication lessened his ability to focus on work and
class  assignments.  In  May  2017,  he  obtained  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  business
administration. (Item 3, Item 2) The VA was unable to prescribe any alternate medication.
In March 2012, Applicant stopped using Vicodin because he believed he was becoming
addicted to Vicodin.
Applicant is now on a regimen of pain medication he receives through the VA. He
was working with his doctor to control the pain. He had used marijuana when trying to
find an alternative to the Vicodin and other pain medication prescribed by the VA.
On  Applicant’s  November  2017  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing (e-QIP) he listed he had smoked marijuana from April 2012 through July 2017.
He stated,
I would use it when pain was too severe to sleep or function throughout
the  day,  and  when  my  prescribed  medication  would  not  work.  Never  at
work or outside of my residence. It was not often . . . I have been in chronic
pain for the last 12 years and tried to manage the pain with marijuana, but
it did not help as I had hoped it would. So now I am on a regimen[] of pills
issued by the Veterans Administration and am working with my Doctor to
maintain manageable pain levels, physical therapy, diet and it is working
. . .I have never had a problem with this drug and it is not addictive. I don’t
see why I would need it or want it in the future. (Item 3)
In 2012, Applicant started using marijuana at night to help him sleep and when the
pain was severe. (Item 2, Item 4) He asserts when Applicant moved to his current state,
which  was  August  2012,  he  stopped  using  marijuana  and  the  VA  prescribed  him
Gabapentin, Ibuprofen, and Acetaminophen to address his back pain. (Item 3 and 4) The
drugs controlled the pain unless the pain became severe. He asserted that in the spring
of 2017, he stopped using marijuana to manage his pain. (Item 2) In July 2017, he again
stopped using marijuana. He asserts his use had no negative impacts on his life and it
allowed him to sleep better and concentrate better on his work and school assignments.
(Item 4) He said he was willing to sign a statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug
involvement and substance misuse. (Item 2)
Applicant did not list any financial problems or delinquencies on his e-QIP. (Item
3) In August 2017, he switched to part-time employment due to his back pain. (Item 4) In
August 2017, he started working 10 to 15 hours per week. From March 2017 to May 2017,
in addition to his full-time job and school attendance, he also worked a second job three
or four days a week. He ended his second job because the commute from his home state
to the job site in another state made his back pain more severe. (Item 4)
From October 2013 to February 2014, Applicant was a full-time student financially
supported by his military disability pay and vocational rehabilitation payments. (Item 4)
His GI Bill benefits and disability pay also financially supported him when he was a student
at other colleges and universities. (Item 4) From January 2009 through July 2010, he was
unemployed due to a lack of work at his company caused by the recession. He was also
unemployed from March 2012 until February 2013. (Items 3 and 4) From February 2013
to  September  2013,  he  was  a  stadium  operations  manager.  (Item  2)  From  April  2015
through  October 2017,  he  was  a  stadium  operations  center supervisor.  (Item  2) Since
March 2017, he has also worked as a baseball video scout.
The $9,521 collection account (SOR 2.a) resulted from the purchase of a bed in
August 2007. His December 2017 credit report, lists the account which required monthly
payments of $25 with a high credit of $2,985. (Item 5) The credit report listed a balance
on the account of $9,521 with $2,363 past due. (Item 5) He made timely payments on the
account  until 2009,  when  he  was  unemployed.  He  stopped  payments  when  other bills
such as food and basic necessities took precedence. (Item 4) He anticipated becoming
current  on  this  account  once  he  became  employed  full  time.  However,  he  could  not
anticipate when the account would be satisfied. (Item 4)
Applicant has employed a company to assist in resolving his debts and to improve
his  overall  financial  health.  (Item  2,  Tab  F)  The  company  was  attempting  to  negotiate
settlement of the debt. The letter from the company states, “Resolution Dept: Erroneous:
Correction date: ‘Resolution Expected no later than 5-1-2019.” (Item 2, Tab H) Applicant
had been told by his financial assistance company that the debt was uncollectable. He
provided  no  documentation  supporting  this  assertion.  (Item  2)  The  account  remains
delinquent as of the date of his SOR Response. In his SOR response he indicated the
debt was being actively  worked and he would make all payments as directed. (Item 2,
Tab F)
Applicant had  a  $1,259  collection  account  (SOR  2.b) related  to a VISA  account
opened in 2015. The account has been paid.  During his December 2017 interview, he
acknowledged the debt and said it became delinquent when other bills such as food and
basic necessities took precedence. (Item 4) A letter from the current creditor indicates the
account has been settled in full and zero is owed on the account. (Item 2, Tab H)
In September 2016, Applicant had taken his daughter to the emergency room due
to an allergic reaction to a flu shot. In his SOR Response, he asserted he was working
hard to correct the misunderstanding concerning the $1,016 medical collection account
(SOR  2.c).  (Item  2)  When  he  learned  of  the  delinquent  obligation,  he  contacted  the
hospital and learned the claim for treatment had been sent to the VA for payment. When
he contacted his insurance company, he was told no claim had been submitted. (Item 4)
The claim was denied by his insurance company when the hospital used the wrong social
security  number.  (Item  4)  During  his  December  2017  interview,  he  acknowledged  the
debt, but could not say when it would be satisfied. The delinquent account is reflected in
his December 2017 credit report. (Item 5) In his response to the SOR, Applicant claims
the creditor told him the debt was erroneous, but the creditor would not provide him with
documentation supporting this assertion. (Item 2)

"Applicant  is  25  years  old.    He  is  not  married  and  has  no  children.    He  has  a
Bachelor’s of Science degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Software
Developer.    He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes the use of cocaine, twice
from  about  January  2012  to  May  2017;  the  use  of  marijuana,  at  least  ten  times  from
October 2012  to  May  2014, and  the use of Vyvance,  on two  occasions,  a  prescription
drug  not  prescribed  to  him.    Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in
February  2017,  a  job  with  a  DoD  contractor  that  he  cherished  and  hoped  to  have
someday.    This  defense  contractor,  like  all  defense  contractors,  has  a  zero  tolerance
drug policy.
Applicant stated that he  used cocaine on two occasions, once in January 2012,
and again in May 2017.  The first time was New Years Eve, 2012.  He explained that he
was  in  his  second  year  at  college,  and  at  a  night  club  consuming  alcohol  with  his
siblings and friends.  Unbeknownst to him, one of his five siblings came up behind him
and stuck something in his nose, and pulled it out without his consent.  Applicant stated
that  his  nose  started  bleeding.    He  states  that  he  later  learned  that  it  was  cocaine.
Applicant’s  second  time  using  cocaine  occurred  in  May  2017.    (Tr.  p.  18.)    On  this
occasion, he was in a Las Vegas hotel with some friends.  Applicant was getting ready
to  go  out  to  a  club  and  used  cocaine.    On  this  occasion,  Applicant  was  working  for  a
defense contractor and was aware of the company’s zero drug tolerance policy.
Applicant also used marijuana while in college from about October 2012 to about
May  2014,  about  ten  times.    He  stated  that  he  no  longer  uses  marijuana  because  he
does not like the smell of it.  He also stated that he no longer  associates with anyone
who  uses  illegal drugs.    He  states that  he has  no  desire  to use any  illegal drug  in  the
future.
Applicant  admitted  to  using  the  prescription  drug.    Vuvance  “a  stimulant,”  that
was not prescribed to him, from about June 2016 to December 2016.  He stated that he
used  it  twice.    Applicant  explained  that  without  asking,  he  took  the  drug,  without
permission,  from  his  roommate  who  had  the  prescription.    It  was  during  final
examinations  when  Applicant  was  sick  and  behind  on  his  studies.    He  knew  that  the
drug would help him focus.  Applicant’s roommate asked Applicant if he had taken his
drug, and Applicant acknowledged that he had.  (Tr. p. 27.)  Applicant testified that the
first time he took it, the drug did not help him.  The second time he took it, in December
2016, Applicant was given permission by his roommate to use it.  This time,  Applicant
found it helpful. He ultimately passed his final exams.  (Tr. p. 28.)
There is a question as to whether Applicant’s first use of cocaine in January 2012
when his siblings stuck it up his nose without his consent can really be counted as  his
first  use  of  cocaine.   If  that first  experience with  cocaine  was  not bad  enough,  what  is
clear  is  the  fact  that  he  chose  to  use  it  in  May  2017,  while  working  for  a  defense
contractor,  and  after  being  made  aware  of  the  company’s  no  drug  tolerance  policy.
Applicant testified that he has since grown up and matured from using illegal drugs.  He
stated  that  he  now  understands  the  responsibilities  that  come  with  working  for  a
defense  contractor  and  holding  a  security  clearance.    He  submitted  a  notarized
Statement of Intent dated November 1, 2018, swearing to never use illegal drugs again.
He  also  understands  that  any  future  involvement  with  illegal  drugs  is  grounds  for
immediate revocation of his national security eligibility.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
A  letter  from  a  post-doctoral  researcher,  who  was  Applicant’s  direct  supervisor
from April 2014 to June 2016, before Applicant started working for his current employer,
indicates  that  Applicant  is  considered  to  be  diligent  and  hard-working.    The  writer
considers  Applicant  to  be  responsible  and  trustworthy,  and  is  recommended  for  a
security clearance.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
A letter from a software engineer and friend, who has known the Applicant since
March 2017, and has worked closely with him on several software projects, finds him to
be trustworthy and reliable.  Applicant is intelligent, and his work product is held to the
highest  standard.    Applicant  is  recommended  for  a  security  clearance.    (Applicant’s
Exhibit A.)
A letter from his college advisor and supervisor during Applicant’s undergraduate
career at college from 2011 to 2013 indicates that she has watched him grow up from a
quiet  and  shy  student,  to  a  well-rounded  and  dedicated  scholar  and  leader.    He  is
described as an honest individual, and a person of high integrity.  He is recommended
for a security clearance.  (Applicant Exhibit A.)
Two letters, one from a systems administrator, who is also a coworker, and one
from a high school friend, attest to Applicant’s honesty, hard-work ethic, and dedication
to seeing the task through completion.   Applicant is also described as kind, responsible,
smart,  ridiculously  driven,  and  one  of  the  most  capable  individuals  they  have
encountered.  Applicant is recommended for a security clearance.   (Applicant’s Exhibit
A.)
Unrelated  to  his  employment,  Applicant  voluntarily  underwent  a  drug  test  on
October 25, 2018, which was negative for illegal drugs.  (Applicant’s Exhibit C.)

"Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since March 2017. He has a bachelor’s degree, awarded in 2006,
and a master’s degree, awarded in 2007. He is single without children.1
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  when  he  was  in  college  and  graduate  school  and
less frequently after he graduated. He held a security clearance when he worked for a
defense  contractor  from  2007  to  2011.  He  reported  on  a  Questionnaire  for  National
Security Positions (SF 86) in April 2017 that he used marijuana on about 60 occasions
between 2002 and 2016, including while holding a security clearance. He stated that he
did not intend to use marijuana in the future:
My use has always been casual, and only when it was offered to me. I’ve
in
generally  been  unemployed  or  self-employed,  and  usually
states/countries where it’s already been legalized. I don’t have any desire
to use it when it would directly affect my livelihood.2
In response to DOHA interrogatories in April 2018, Applicant admitted that he ate
cookies  baked  with  marijuana  in  July  2017,  and  that  on  October  31,  2017,  a  friend
offered  him  a  “vaporizer-pen  with  some  marijuana  in  its  contents.”  Applicant  “took  a
single  pull  and  barely  felt  any  effects.”  He  again  stated  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use
marijuana in the future:
Though I have admitted that I am not against Marijuana, I also use it very
infrequently. Since the experience on October 31st, I haven’t used it since.
I have never purchased it, nor any related paraphernalia. Upon conducting
the  clearance  interview  [in  December  2017],  I  realized  that  I  would  not
want to jeopardize my employment for its occasional use.3
In  his  June  2018  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  he  was  an
infrequent marijuana user, and that he “clearly underestimated the gravity and severity
of  choosing  to  use  marijuana  during  this  specific  period  [2009-2011]  under  which  [he]
held a clearance.” His marijuana use never adversely affected his job performance, and
he  volunteered  to  work  in  Iraq.  He  now  fully  understands  that  marijuana  use  is
inconsistent with holding a security clearance. He moved to a different city, away from
the  people  with  whom  he  used  marijuana.  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to  abstain
from all drug involvement and substance misuse.4

Applicant  is  57  years  old.  He  is  divorced  twice  and  has  two  adult  children.  He
served in the Army from 1980 to 2004, and received an honorable discharge. He held a
security clearance while in the Army. He has worked for federal contractors since 2004.
In 2014, he was granted an interim security clearance. (Item 4)
In his August 2017 SCA, Applicant stated that in June 2017 he used marijuana for
the first time  to  alleviate  arthritic  pain.  He  said  his physician  was  going  to  issue  him  a
medical certificate  to use  it,  so  he  decided to  try  it  before  that.  On  June 30, 2017,  his
employer notified him that he tested positive for marijuana on his recent drug urinalysis
and was required to enroll in a mandatory Employee Assistance Program (EAP) starting
July 6, 2017. He was placed on a leave of absence from July 3, to August 2, 2017, and
required  to  complete  some  form  of  treatment.2  He  stated  that  he  is  now  required  to
participate  in  a  five-year  drug  treatment  program,  beginning  on  July  27,  2017,  and
continuing to July 27, 2022. He explained that his employer requires him to be drug free
during those years. (Items 4, 5, 6)
During a December 2017 interview, Applicant told an investigator that on June 23,
2017, he used marijuana to relieve arthritic pain in his back. He said his doctor had offered
to  prescribe  him  a  medical  marijuana  card,  but  Applicant  refused  because  it  was
prohibited under federal law and his employer’s policies. He stated that on June 26, 2017,
he was randomly selected for a drug urinalysis. On June 30, 2017, his employer notified
him that he tested positive for marijuana and was ordered not to return to work, beginning
on July 3, 2017. He was off work for 30 days and had to take another drug urinalysis on
July 24, 2017. Those results were negative and he returned to work on August 2, 2017.
(Item 6)
1 Applicant denied that he tested positive for marijuana on June 28, 2017, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d.
He admitted that it was July 5, 2017, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. He asserted he only tested positive once
during the June to July 2017 timeframe. There is confusion in this record as to the correct date of his positive
urinalysis in 2017. I find that the date of the positive drug screen was in June 2017, which is consistent with
the preponderance of the evidence, including his SCA, interview, and interrogatories. (Item 6)
2 There is no information describing the components of this mandatory treatment program.
On May 10, 2018, a government investigator obtained Applicant’s medical records.
The  records  documented  that  Applicant  had been  using marijuana from approximately
October 2015 until July 2017, during which time he held a security clearance. According
to the medical records, Applicant’s physician prescribed him Tramadol, and required him
to refrain from alcohol or marijuana use while using this drug. On October 14, 2015, he
tested positive for marijuana. Subsequently, Applicant acknowledged to his physician in
writing  that  he  would not  use  alcohol or marijuana  and  agreed  to random  drug  testing
ordered by his physician to confirm abstinence. Despite his promise, he tested positive
for  both  marijuana  and  alcohol  on  January  22,  2016,  and  March  22,  2016.  He  later
reported  to his physician that he  discontinued marijuana  use, but  his  subsequent drug
test in June 2017 again tested positive for marijuana. (Items 3, 7)
On June 12, 2018, Applicant completed a set of  government interrogatories. He
reported that he had used marijuana only once, on June 26, 2017. He admitted that he
failed a drug test, but stated he had no intention of using marijuana again. He submitted
a  Certificate  of  Completion  of  an  eight-hour  drug  and  alcohol  awareness  class  in  July
2017, while on his leave of absence. He wrote that he had recently taken cortisone shots
for his arthritic pain and participated in physical therapy, both of which were alleviating
his pain. (Item 6)

"Applicant is 39 years old. He graduated from high school in 1998, and has been
employed  as  a  systems  administrator  by  a  federal  contractor  since  January  2016.
Applicant reports no military service and he has never married. Applicant reports previous
employment in the information technology field and in the oil fields. He was terminated
from a job in May 2015 for supposedly poor performance. He reports no previous security
clearance.
In January 2016, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA),2 and
in section 22 (Police Record), he disclosed a May 2013 arrest for driving while intoxicated
(DWI). However, he did not disclose any previous involvement with, or use of illegal drugs
in section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity). In his July 2017 clearance interview,
he volunteered his repeated use of various illegal drugs, to the investigator.3 Applicant
stated  that  he  had  extensive  use  of  various  illegal  controlled  substances  including
cocaine,  mushrooms,  ecstasy,  marijuana,  Ritalin,  Vicodin,  and  various  pain  pills.  He
started  using  cocaine  as  a  senior  in  high  school  in  1998,  and  he  continued  to  use  it
recreationally about once every six months, until 2002.
In  2002,  Applicant  moved  in  with  his  girlfriend  and  his  drug  use  intensified.
Together, they used a panoply of illegal drugs every weekend for three years, until they
broke up in 2005. Then, Applicant’s illegal drug use slowed down again to once every six
months or so.4 He stated that he last used marijuana two years ago, and he last used un-
prescribed pain killers in 2005. Applicant never purchased or sold illegal drugs. They were
usually provided to him by friends in social settings. He stated he last used cocaine in
April 2017. He estimated he has driven under the influence of cocaine 12 to 16 times.

In  his  June  2018  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations
including his illegal use of various drugs (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.f) and testing positive on a drug
test administered by his employer in May 2015. (SOR ¶ 1.g) He clarified his admission to
the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.h since he has started a new job in the oil fields that requires
random  drug  testing  and  he  quit  using  recreational  drugs.  In  SOR  ¶  2.a,  Applicant
admitted to falsifying his responses in section 23 of his SCA, and termination from his
employment after testing positive on the May 2015 random drug test (SOR ¶ 2.b) He also
admitted to three DWI arrests in 2000, 2006, and 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 2.c – 2.e). The 2000
case was dismissed, and the 2006 DWI was reduced to a lesser offense.
Applicant was evaluated for alcohol and other substance use/abuse on October
18,  2018.  The  evaluating  doctor  found  no  evidence  of  any  Diagnostic  and  Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM 5) alcohol or substance use disorder. He did not find
that  Applicant  manifests  features  of  either  addiction or  dependence. Applicant  told  the
evaluator  that  he  last  used  cocaine  in  February  2017.  (AE  A)    Applicant  provided  no
evidence of character references or performance evaluations from his employer. He did
provide a statement of his unequivocal intent to not use illegal drugs after being granted
a security clearance and agreeing to automatic revocation of his security clearance if he
does.  (attachment  D  to  Answer)  He  also  provided  time  card  and  earnings  documents
reflecting that he earned approximately $21 per hour, and $31.50 per hour for overtime,
in 2018. He routinely worked six or seven days a week on 12 hour shifts.

"The  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  H  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  in  March
2014 while holding a security clearance since May 2010. (SOR 1.a) Under Guideline E,
it alleged that Applicant falsified his 2015 SCA when he failed to disclose his illegal use
of  marijuana  while  holding  a  clearance  (SOR  2.a  and  2.b);  and  that  he  made  false
statements  to  a  government  investigator  when  he  denied  his  marijuana  use  while
holding a clearance (SOR 2.c and 2.d). Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations.
After a  thorough  review  of the  record  evidence,  I make  the following findings of
fact:
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high  school  in  2001,  and  received  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2015.  He  married  in  2004
and divorced in 2018. He remarried in 2019, and his wife is expecting a child. He has
three children from his prior marriage, ages 14, 12, and 7.
Applicant  enlisted  in  April  2003  and  honorably  served  on  active  duty  until
November  2012  when  he  was  discharged  as  a  staff  sergeant  (E-6).  Applicant  held  a
clearance  during  most  of  his  service.  He  volunteered  for  an  eight-month  overseas
deployment  to  a  dangerous  area  where  he  performed  a  sensitive  mission.  When  he
returned to the United States, he was recognized and awarded with an assignment to a
leadership position normally reserved for individuals above his pay grade.
While  in  the  service,  Applicant  was  detailed  to  work  for  a  government  agency
(Agency).  After  his  discharge,  he  was  immediately  hired  as  an  analyst  by  a  federal
contractor  and  assigned  to  work  for  the  Agency.  Upon  his  employment,  the  Agency
required Applicant to read and sign a personnel security policy advisory in March 2013
(GE  4). The document  specifically  warned  Applicant that  the  illegal use  of  drugs  (use,
possession,  transfer,  sale,  and  purchase)  was  strictly  prohibited  by  the  Agency  and
violation of the policy was grounds for disqualification for access eligibility.
In March 2014, Applicant’s employer sponsored his (and other co-workers) trip to
another  country  to  attend  a  security  conference.  During  a  post-conference  party  at  a
nightclub, Applicant went outside to get some fresh air. He observed an unknown man,
who  was  also  at  the  conference,  smoking  a  marijuana  cigarette.  While  they  were
talking, the man offered Applicant the marijuana cigarette. Applicant took the marijuana
cigarette,  smoked  two  puffs  from  it,  returned  it  to  the  man,  and  then  went  back  inside
the club.
interviews
Applicant  participated
in  August  2005,
in  polygraph-assisted
September 2010, September 2014, April 2015, August 2015, and July 2016. During his
August 2015 interview, Applicant  was apparently having trouble passing the polygraph
examination and reported smoking two puffs from a marijuana cigarette in March 2014.
He  explained  to  the  interviewer  that  his  intention  at  the  time  was  to  fit  in.  Applicant
denied  any  other  personal  involvement  with  illegal  drugs  in  the  last  seven  years.
Applicant also disclosed that his best friend, a cleared contractor, smoked marijuana in
front  of  him  all  the  time,  including  during  the  four  days  before  his  friend’s  successful
polygraph examination.
When  Applicant  smoked  the  marijuana,  he  had  a  top-secret  clearance  with
access  to  sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI),  and  he  was  aware  of  the
Agency’s  policy  prohibiting  personnel  involvement  with  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  did  not
disclose  his  illegal  marijuana  use  during  his  September  2014  polygraph  examination
because  he  was  afraid  he  would  lose  his  clearance  and  then  be  fired  from  his  job.
Applicant stated he did not intend to have personal involvement with illegal drugs in the
future. (GE 5)
The  Agency  revoked  Applicant’s  SCI  access  in  2015-2016.  He  appealed  the
revocation in March 2017 (GE 6), and the Agency affirmed the denial of SCI eligibility in
June 2017 (GE 7).
Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of Applicant’s 2015 SCA asked
him  to  disclose  whether:  (1)  in  the  last  seven  years  he  had  illegally  used  (including
inhaling,  swallowing,  experimenting  with,  or  otherwise  consuming)  any  drugs  or
controlled  substances;  and  (2)  he  had  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been  involved
with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  Applicant
answered  “No”  to  both  questions  and  failed  to  disclose  his  illegal  use  of  marijuana  in
March 2014.
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2016. During the
course  of  the  interview  he  denied  any  violation  of  security  policies.  He  stated  that  he
was removed from his work building with the Agency because his conditional certificate
of  authority  was  removed  after  three  inconclusive  polygraph  examinations  in  2013,
2014, and 2015. Applicant told the interviewer that he did not know why the tests were
inconclusive and claimed he had done nothing wrong. (GE 8)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  another  government  investigator  on  January  29,
2018. He was asked whether he had used illegal drugs in the  last year, during the last
seven years, and while possessing a clearance. Applicant adamantly denied any and all
use  of  illegal  substances  or  drugs.  The  investigator  confronted  Applicant  with  his
previous  admission  to  marijuana  use  in  2014  while  possessing  a  clearance  with  SCI
access. Applicant admitted to the investigator that he took possession of the marijuana
cigarette and placed it in his lips, but he claimed for the first time that he did not inhale.
(GE 8)
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  not  reported  the  2014  marijuana
incident  to  his  security  office  because  he  did  believe  that  he  actually  used  marijuana.
Applicant stated to the interviewer that he omitted the 2014 marijuana incident from his
2015  SCA  because  he  did  not  inhale,  and  thus,  he  does  not  believe  that  he  illegally
used marijuana. (GE 8)
During his hearing testimony, Applicant admitted that he took possession of the
marijuana cigarette, took two puffs from it, and marijuana cigarette smoke came out of
his  mouth.  (Tr.  36)  Applicant  explained  the  he  answered  “No”  to  both  questions  in
Section  23  (Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity)  of  his  2015  SCA,  and  denied  any
illegal drug use to the interviewer in January 2018, because he did not inhale and does
not believe that he illegally used marijuana. (Tr. 37-40)
Although  denying  that  he  illegally  used  marijuana,  Applicant  acknowledged  that
“puffing” the marijuana cigarette in March 2014 was unacceptable behavior. He believes
that this was an isolated incident, over five years ago, and should be mitigated with the
passage  of  time.  He  highlighted  his  good  service  record,  that  he  volunteered  for  a
sensitive dangerous mission, and his good performance working for federal contractors.
He  also  noted  that  he  is  actively  involved  in  his  community  where  he  volunteers
organizing  activities  and  coaching  children.  Applicant  noted  that  he  disclosed  that  his
best friend was a frequent marijuana user, and that he no longer associated with him or
other  people  who  use  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  also  noted  his  changed  circumstances
including  receiving  his  bachelor’s  degree,  getting  married  in  2019,  and  his  wife
expecting a child in the near future.
Applicant testified that his criminal misconduct continues to weigh on him since it
happened. He does not intend on using any illegal drugs or controlled substances in the
future because he does not want to jeopardize his and his family’s livelihood. Applicant
has never sought or received any medical or psychological treatment or counseling for
his substance abuse.

was marijuana and there were stretches of years (including my first marriage) when I did
not do it out of respect for those around me who do not smoke.” (Item 4.) She estimated
the dates of use to be June 1991 through April 2016. She further checked the box that

varying  frequencies  since 1991.  At the  time of  the  interview,  she  used  marijuana on a
weekly  basis.  She  used  marijuana  with  her  husband  and  friends.  She  disclosed  that
between 1991 and 1994 she used cocaine once, LSD three times, and amphetamines at
varying frequencies. (Item 5.)
Applicant  completed  Public  Trust  Position  Applications  in  July  2003  and  March
2005.  Questions 21(a)  and  21(b)  on  those forms asked  Applicant if  she  had used  any
controlled substance within the last year and whether in the past seven years she had
been involved in the illegal purchase of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen,
or cannabis. She answered all of these questions no. She claimed in her answer to the
SOR that between March 1994 and May 2008, she did not use or purchase any controlled
substance to include marijuana. Her claim is credible, as she consistently indicated that
she did not use marijuana during the course of her first marriage, which corresponds with
the dates of her Public Trust Position Applications. (Items 2-5.)
Applicant  was  also  alleged  to  be  indebted  on  19  delinquent  accounts  totaling
$34,656, and to have discharged debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2004. These
debts and the bankruptcy filing were established in the bankruptcy petition and the credit
reports dated May 6, 2005, June 9, 2016, and July 16, 2018. (Items 7-10.) She attributed
her debts to her divorce, the need for emergency medical care, and underemployment.
(Item 5.)
In Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, filed in March 2004, she listed assets
totaling  $16,053  and  liabilities  of  $64,500.  All  of  her  liabilities  were  unsecured  claims.
They were discharged in June 2004. (Item 10.)
Of her alleged delinquent debts, a total of $10,102 related to unresolved medical
accounts,  as  stated  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d,  1.g  through  1.o,  1.q,  and  1.s.  In  her
answer, she indicated, “I admit  that  I have many medical bills and am actively making
payments every month to pay them off. I do not know which of these debts is legitimate
and/or still outstanding.” She provided nothing further in this regard. Her July 2018 credit
report listed four delinquent medical accounts, which correspond  with  SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l,
1.m,  and  1.n.  It  is  unclear  if  the  other  medical  debts  alleged  were  resolved  through
payment or if they are no longer reported on the credit report due to their age. SOR ¶¶
1.a through 1.d, 1.g through 1.o, 1.q, and 1.s are unresolved. (Items 8, 9.)
Applicant also had four non-medical debts identified on the SOR. She was alleged
to be delinquent in the amount of $3,707 for a judgment against her by a bank, as stated
in SOR ¶ 1.e. She satisfied this judgment in January 2013, as reflected on her July 2016
credit  report.  She  was  also  alleged  to  be  indebted  on  a  judgment  obtained  by  a  utility
company in the amount of $658 as stated in  SOR ¶ 1.f. She satisfied this judgment in
February  2011,  as  reflected  on  her  July  2016  credit  report.  These  debts  are  resolved.
(Item 8.)
SOR  ¶  1.p  alleged Applicant  was  indebted  on  a  repossessed  automobile  in  the
amount of $16,873. This debt became delinquent in January 2010. Applicant denied this
debt. She indicated that this debt was incurred by her ex-husband without her knowledge
or permission. “As soon as [she] discovered the purchase had been made, [she] left him.
In  [their]  divorce  papers,  this  is  the  date  of  [their]  separation.”  Applicant  presented  no
evidence  establishing  that  she  contested  this  debt  with  the  creditor  or  credit  reporting
agency. This debt is unresolved. (Item 8.)
SOR ¶ 1.r alleged Applicant was indebted to a bank in the amount of $3,316. The
debt was reported as delinquent in October 2014. She admitted this debt and claimed to
have set up a payment agreement with this creditor. She provided no documentation of
that agreement or of any payments made to this creditor. This debt is unresolved. (Items
5, 8.)

"Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.h.  He  denied  the
allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  2.b,  and  2.c.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  these
findings of fact. He did not fully answer the allegations in SOR ¶ 2.a, which re-alleged the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h; however, he reiterated his denial to SOR ¶ 1.a.
Applicant is 38 years old and unmarried. He graduated from high school and has
taken a couple college courses. He has a 12-year-old child and 10-year old child with a
former girlfriend (GF 1). He has a 9-year-old child and a 1-year-old child with his current
girlfriend (GF 2). He financially supports all of the children. He shares physical custody of
the older two children with GF 1. (Tr. 23-25)
Applicant is unemployed while awaiting the outcome of this proceeding. He had
worked about six months for the defense contractor that is sponsoring him for a security
clearance.  Prior  to  that  position,  he had  been  a  manager  for  retail  stores for  about  13
years. (Tr. 25-27)
(SOR ¶ 1.h) In October 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with disorderly
conduct and breach of peace. The charge was dismissed. (Answer) He denied that he
engaged in unlawful conduct before the arrest. (Tr. 29)
(SOR ¶ 1.g) In November 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery-
cause bodily harm, and theft-property, exerts unauthorized control. (Answer) At the time
of the arrest, Applicant stated he became involved in a physical fight with his girlfriend’s

community service. The theft charge was dismissed. (Tr. 31-33)
(SOR  ¶  1.f)  In  September  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  on  a
suspended  driver’s  license  and  driving  26-30  miles  over  the  speed  limit.  (Answer)
Applicant’s license was suspended at the time because he had numerous unpaid parking
tickets  that he  could not  afford to pay.  (Tr. 33-34) The  court’s disposition  is not  in  this
record.
(SOR ¶ 1.e) In February 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with having an
expired  driver’s  license  for  more  than  a  year,  and  failure  to  reduce  speed.  (Answer)
Applicant stated he did not know his license was expired when he was stopped by the
police. He was speeding because he was late for work. He said the case was dismissed
after he provided the court with evidence that his license was updated. (Tr. 34-36) This
allegation is found in his favor.
(SOR ¶ 1.d) In February 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic
battery-bodily harm. (Answer) His neighbors called the police because he and GF 1 were
in a heated verbal argument that became physical. He said he does not recall hitting or
grabbing GF 1. They were living together at the time. The case was dismissed because
GF 1 refused to testify. (Tr. 36-39)
(SOR ¶ 1.c) In December 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving
without a license, disregarding a stop sign, operating a car without insurance, and having
an unregistered or expired registration. (Answer) He said that this incident occurred while
he was driving a friend’s car, and he did not have his driver’s license with him. All charges
were  dismissed  when  Applicant  went  to  court  and  produced  evidence  of  his  license,
insurance, and registration. (Tr. 41-42) This allegation is found in his favor.
In February 2014, Applicant was in an automobile accident after he had a seizure
while driving. He stopped driving later that year, as a consequence. He has epilepsy and
is not allowed to drive. He has seizures once or twice a month. His last seizure was a
month ago. He takes medication for the illness. (Tr. 42-44, 59-61)
(SOR ¶ 1.b) In February 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic
battery-bodily harm. (Answer) Applicant was at GF 1’s house at the time of the incident
and became embroiled in an argument with her. He said GF 1 struck him, and he hit her
in the face. He denied that he punched her in the face. He then took her phone, broke it,
and smashed her windshield with a garbage can. The case was dismissed because GF
1 refused to testify. (Tr. 44-47)
(SOR ¶ 1.a) In July 2017, GF 1 called the police after she and Applicant got into
an argument when he returned their two children to her home. She told the police that he
spit at her during the conflict. The police filed an incident report regarding her complaint.
(GE 5) GF 1 never signed a complaint, and the matter was dropped. Applicant said that
the incident never happened in July 2017. (Tr. 47-49)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  treatment  for  domestic  violence  or  anger
management. (Tr. 54) He said after the February 2017 incident, he began talking to his
pastor about his anger problems. He has counseled with him about 13 times. Applicant
now tries to walk away from situations that upset him. (Tr. 54-58)
In August 2017, Applicant submitted his first security clearance application (SCA).
In response to Section 22, inquiring about his police record, he disclosed the February
2014  car  accident  arrest,  which  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  also  disclosed  the
February 2017 incident (SOR ¶ 1.b), stating that he had a “disagreement” with GF 1. (GE
1) He did not disclose that he struck her which he admitted during his testimony. (Tr. 44)
Applicant did not disclose the July 2017 incident in Section 22, alleged in SOR ¶
1.a, because he denied any incident occurred in July 2017. (Tr. 47) Applicant denied that
he intentionally withheld information from the Government regarding the December 2012
arrests for driving violations, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. He said he did not disclose that incident
because he thought the word charged meant convicted, and he was not convicted. (Tr.

"Applicant  is  alleged  under  Guideline  H  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  cross-alleged  under
Guideline  E  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  to  have  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
approximately June 2002 to August 2017, to include a period while holding a DOD security
clearance granted to him on May 13, 2009. Applicant is also alleged under Guideline H
(SOR ¶ 1.b) to have failed to commit to discontinue his use of marijuana despite stating on
April 29, 2009, and on January 24, 2017, that he did not intend to use marijuana in the
future. After considering his response to the SOR (AE I), other exhibits, and the hearing
transcript, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old principle systems engineer. He has a bachelor’s degree in
aeronautical engineering awarded in May 2009. He has been married since February 2016,
and purchased his current residence in approximately March 2014. Applicant holds a DOD
secret  security  clearance,  which  was  granted  to  him  in  May  2009 for his duties with a
previous  defense-contractor  employer  (company  X).  He  has  worked  for  his  current
defense-contractor employer since August 2016. (GE 2.)
Applicant began using marijuana as a sophomore in high school because of peer
pressure  in  approximately  June  2002.  He  continued  to  use  marijuana  with  varying
frequency, on average three times a month in high school and then in college from August
2005 to January 2009. His use peaked between August 2006 and May 2008 during his
sophomore and junior years of college. (GE 1.) During the summer of 2008, Applicant had
an  internship  with  company  X.  During  his  last  semester  of  college,  he  was  offered
permanent  employment  with  the  defense  contractor.  On  March  24,  2009,  Applicant
completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions
(SF 86) for that employment. In response to an inquiry concerning any illegal use of a
controlled  substance  in  the  last  seven  years,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  used
marijuana several times a month between June 2002 and January 2009. He estimated that
he used marijuana 234 times total during that period and indicated that he ceased his use
of  marijuana  when  he  began  his  search  for  post-college  employment.  Applicant  also
disclosed that he had used approximately two grams of a hallucinogen before a concert in
July 2007 and that he had tried cocaine twice over the course of one weekend in January
2004. (GE 3.)
On April 21, 2009, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  about  his  drug  use.  He  explained  that  his
marijuana  use  peaked  in  college  because  he  wanted  to  impress  upper  classmen.  He
indicated that he smoked marijuana from a glass pipe passed around with three former
friends from his fraternity, who had since graduated and moved away. He named the three
friends.1 Applicant indicated that he purchased marijuana on occasion and sold marijuana
to friends in his fraternity if he had some available. His drug involvement did not adversely
affect  his  academic  studies,  as  he  maintained  a  grade  point average of 3.4 or higher.
Applicant stated that he did not use marijuana during his final examinations or during his
summer  internship  with  company  X.  He  had  passed  a  drug  screen  for that  internship.
Applicant  denied  any  future  intention  of  using  marijuana  because  he  did  not  want
marijuana to interfere with his career ambitions. As for his use of a hallucinogen in July
2007, Applicant obtained hallucinogenic mushrooms from a friend prior to a concert. He
experienced effects of nausea, disorientation, and edginess. About his disclosed cocaine
use, Applicant explained that he tried cocaine two times with friends on December 31,
2003, when the drug was offered to him. He disliked the effects of both the hallucinogen
and cocaine and expressed no intention to use either drug in the future. (GE 1.) Applicant
was granted a DOD secret clearance in May 2009. (GE 2.)
Applicant graduated from college in May 2009, and he started working for company
X in July 2009. In December 2009, he resumed using marijuana on an infrequent basis,
approximately  three  to  four  times  a  year,  at  social  gatherings  with  two  close  fraternity
brothers  from  college  (friends  #1  and #2). (GE 2.) He described his lifestyle as “work-
centric.” He had relocated to a new state for work where he did not know anyone, but when
he  had  the  opportunity  to  return  home  or  see  friends,  “these  get-togethers  had  a
celebratory,  cut  loose  type  of  nature.”  (Tr. 42.)  Applicant  moved  to  his current  area  in
March 2014 and worked remotely for company X through July 2016, when he left the job
for his current employment. (GE 2.) Applicant used marijuana in March 2016 with friend #2,
who then resided in a distant state and had flown in to serve as his best man. Applicant
believed  it  would  be  some  time  before  he  would  see  friend  #2  again,  and  it  felt  like  a
special occasion. (Tr. 43.)
On January 24, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a SF 86
to renew his security clearance eligibility. In response to an inquiry concerning any illegal
use of drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years, Applicant disclosed that he
had used marijuana recreationally during social gatherings, approximately three to four
times  per  year  from  December  2009  to  March  2016.  He  admitted  that  he  had  used
marijuana  while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  He  responded  “No”  to  whether  he
intended to use the drug in the future and stated:
1 Applicant discrepantly testified that two other friends (friends #1 and #2) were the persons with whom he
primarily used marijuana in college. (Tr. 73.)
My  use  of  marijuana  during  the  past  7  years was  an  extension  of  habits
developed  during  college,  and  occurred  with  college  acquaintances.  I
consider it a “phase” from which I have grown out of. My last use was almost
1 year ago, and I have no intentions of revisiting this behavior. (GE 2.)
After abstaining from marijuana since March 2016, Applicant used the drug with
friends #1 and #2 in August 2017. Applicant, his wife, and friend #1 traveled to see friend
#2, who lived at that time in a state in the path of a solar eclipse. Applicant and friends #1
and #2 were in a mood to celebrate, which apparently “led to a momentary dropping of
[Applicant’s] guard.” (Tr. 43-44.) Applicant spent about $40 for the marijuana that he used.
(GE 1; Tr. 74.)
On February 28, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator. About his
marijuana use three to four times yearly from December 2009 to March 2016, he admitted
that he used the drug with friends #1 and #2 while possessing a security clearance and
knowing that his employer at the time (company X) had policies prohibiting illegal drug use.
He  was  aware  that  if  he  had  been  caught,  he  would  have  been  subject  to  possible
disciplinary action. He indicated that his friends provided him the drug, and that he typically
used three or four joints at a time on the weekends with them. While he did not always use
marijuana when associating with them, marijuana use was a common activity with them.
Applicant volunteered that he used marijuana after March 2016 on one occasion. In August
2017,  he  and  friends  #1  and  #2  shared  two  or  three  grams  of  marijuana,  which  he
indicated was purchased legally by his friends, but then transported across state lines and
used  illegally.2  Applicant  acknowledged  the  conflict  between  using  an  illegal  drug  and
holding a security clearance. He expressed some concern should his current employer find
out about his use of marijuana, but he indicated that he would inform his employer about
his drug use if someone threatened blackmail. When asked about his future intentions,
Applicant responded that he could not say that he would not use marijuana again because
smoking the drug with these two friends is something they do together and have done so
for a decade. (GE 1.)
On March 2, 2018, Applicant was re-contacted by the investigator about why he had
indicated on his SF 86 that he had no intention to use marijuana again, given he had used
marijuana approximately seven months later and was unable to commit to no future use as
of his February 2018 interview. Applicant explained that he had no plan to use marijuana
again  as  of  his  January  2017  SF  86  and  that  marijuana  was  not  an  active  part  of  his
lifestyle.  He  acknowledged  that  he  might  use  marijuana  in  the  future,  but  he  had  no
concrete plan to use marijuana again. (GE 1.) At his hearing, he clarified that he did not
2  Applicant  admitted  at  his  hearing  that  he  purchased  some  marijuana  on  that  occasion  as  well  and
transported it across state lines for use in a state where marijuana is illegal. As to why he would take the risk,
Applicant  indicated  that  he  was  curious  about  the  experience  of  legally  purchasing  marijuana.  He
acknowledged knowing that it was a crime to bring a controlled substance across state lines, but added:
I can’t defend the action. I can only state at the time it did not trip a mental threshold for me.
And I attribute that in part to the quantity that we had. Again, it was very minimal in nature. I
guess  I  would  describe  it  as  a  minor  offense  that  I  did  not  necessarily—that  did  not
necessarily influence me against participating in the experience. (Tr. 74-76.)
mean to suggest that he would use marijuana. Rather, he “conservatively postulate[d] that
a hypothetical scenario could exist.” (Tr. 70.)
Applicant listed his college friends #1 and #2 as references on his January 2017 SF
86. (GE 1.) An OPM investigator interviewed Applicant’s college friend #2 on March 22,
2018,  as part of Applicant’s background investigation. Friend #2 indicated that he and
Applicant engaged in recreational use of marijuana together in college from 2006 to 2009.
After graduation, they had in-person contact annually and smoked a joint together on those
occasions.  Friend  #2  indicated  that  Applicant  was  aware  that  using  marijuana  had
ramifications for his job and security clearance, but that Applicant was not going to use
marijuana in the future. Friend #2 added that they were both growing older and the desire
to smoke marijuana did not exist. (AE J.) Applicant recalls telling his friends in September
2017 that he did not intend to use any marijuana in the future. (Tr. 79.)
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  executed  a  statement  on  June  14,  2018,
affirming his commitment to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse in the
future with an acknowledgement that any future drug involvement or misuse would be
grounds  for immediate revocation of his security clearance eligibility.  Citing his candor
about his illegal drug involvement, he indicated that he has “come to better appreciate the
perceptions and expectations of others as [he has] matured.” He added that his interest in
marijuana  and  the  frequency  of  his  use  has  diminished  over  time,  and  he  expressed
confidence in his ability to refrain from any future illegal drug use. Concerning his previous
reluctance to commit to discontinuing future drug use, Applicant explained that it “was
grounded in [his] desire to be truthful and open about a hypothetical future that could put
[him] in a position where [he] may be perceived as dishonest.” He added that he had no
reservations about his ability to abstain from using marijuana. (AE I.)
At his hearing, Applicant reiterated that he had no intention of using marijuana in the
future and that he was confident in his ability to adhere to this commitment. (Tr. 33.) He
acknowledged  that  he  had  “not  expertly  executed  prior  commitments”  to  abstain  from
marijuana, but that his signed statement agreeing to revocation of his security clearance for
any future drug use is something that he takes very seriously. (Tr. 69.) He expressed a
willingness  to  submit  to  random  drug  screening.  (Tr.  35.)  Regarding  actions  taken  to
change or avoid environments conducive to drug use, Applicant asserted that his use since
college  “has  been  restricted  to  close  friends  and  family  members  whom  [he]  trust[s]
explicitly.”  (Tr.  40.)  He  testified  that  it  would  be  “extremely  difficult”  for  him  to  fully
disassociate himself from friends #1 and #2, but they no longer use marijuana together.
(Tr. 51-53.)
Applicant’s spouse does not use marijuana. Applicant has known of her disapproval
of his marijuana use, which he submits has been another motivating factor in his decision
to stop using the drug. (Tr. 78.)
Applicant is active in some community activities. He served as a robot design judge
in his state’s high school championship held in December 2017. (AE D.) In July 2018, he
was selected for and participated in a 5K race to benefit a charitable cause that benefits
veterans, military service members, and their families. (AE E; Tr. 60.)
Applicant’s  close  fraternity  friends  #1  and  #2  from  college  provided  character
references for him. Friend #1 owns a small electric contracting and consulting business.
They lived together in college from spring 2007 to spring 2009 and remained close after
college. They have telephone contact once a month and take backpacking trips or other
outings  together  at  least  twice  a  year.  Friend  #1  holds  Applicant  in  high  esteem  and
“considers his words to have great value.” Applicant can be counted on to provide well
thought-out advice. In his experience, Applicant is a person who does what he says he will
do.  Applicant  informed  friend  #1  that  it  is  inappropriate  for  him  to  continue  to  use
marijuana,  and  friend  #1  indicates  that  he  is fully  supportive  of  him  in  that  regard.  He
believes Applicant is an asset to national security, dedicated to his work, and “a man of
honor and trustworthiness.” (AE H.)
Friend #2 has known Applicant since the fall of 2006 in college and considers him to
be one of his closest and most trusted friends. They have kept in regular contact since
college, approximately twice monthly by telephone and almost weekly by text messaging.
Applicant and friend #2 now live in relatively close proximity, and they engage in outdoor
recreational  activities  or  home-improvement  projects  together  several  times  a  year.
Applicant has always been honest with friend #2, who has grown to appreciate Applicant’s
“sage feedback.” Friend #2 would trust Applicant with his daughter’s well-being. Applicant
has displayed passion about his work for a defense contractor and has informed friend # 2
about his intention to abstain from recreational marijuana use. Friend #2 is supportive of
the decision and is confident Applicant will adhere to his convictions. He regards Applicant
as an asset to national security because of the values, ethics, and passion Applicant has
exhibited over the course of their 12-year friendship. (AE G.)
Applicant is passionate about his work. Four months into his current job, Applicant’s
job performance was rated as high in some aspects, good in others, and exceptional in
providing support. Regarding the company’s code of conduct and compliance with ethical
principles, Applicant had demonstrated to his rating manager that he could be “trusted to
do what is right.” (AE C.)  He had a very successful first year with his current employer. He
was  singled  out  for  his  “great  performance  so  far”  and  his  outstanding  support.  His
manager and others recognized him as someone with “great growth potential as both an
individual contributor and as a leader.” Applicant’s efforts in completing qualification testing
led to his employer receiving several million dollars in progress payments during the 2017
calendar year. He consistently displayed company-ethics principles in all of his interactions
with co-workers and was accountable for his actions at work. (AE B.)
Applicant’s work supervisor since April 2018 first became acquainted with him in
December 2016. They have worked on the same project since January 2018. One of his
many tasks requires a high level of attention to detail, and he is able to convey information
clearly and concisely. She considers Applicant to be one of her highest performers and an
asset to national security. He is sought after by multiple teams because of his ability to
work well with any group. He completes his work on time and has been willing to work
extended hours to solve complex problems. (AE F.) At his mid-year performance review in
August  2018,  she  described  Applicant  as  an  “excellent  example  of  a  model  systems
engineering employee.” (AE A.)
Applicant asserts that he told his current supervisor that he was being investigated
for marijuana use. (Tr. 49.) No other co-workers are aware of his drug use, although he
now indicates that he would acknowledge his drug use if asked. He does not intend to
volunteer the information unless the circumstances warrant it. He is not ashamed of his
marijuana  involvement,  but  “there  are  obvious  professional  consequences  of  that
reputation growing beyond what is necessary.” (Tr. 62.) Applicant did not inform his facility
security officer (FSO) about his drug use while holding a security clearance because it has
not impacted his ability to serve in his professional capacity. He used marijuana only one
time during his present employment. (Tr. 63.) When asked whether he felt that his breach
of his employer’s drug policy should have been disclosed to his FSO at his previous and
current defense-contractor employments, Applicant responded that he had never denied
his use and would have informed his security officer  in the case of an arrest. (Tr. 64.)
Applicant acknowledged that he had received training at work about substance abuse, but
he did not consider his behavior as abuse. Marijuana never served as a crutch for him, and
he was not dependent on the drug. (Tr. 80.)
",False
"In his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Paragraph
1 of the SOR, with explanations He also provided additional information to support his
request for eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant is 50 years old, divorced, but remarried. (TR at page 17 line 6 to page
18 line 16, at page 34 line 10 to page 35 line 4, and GX 1 at page 5.) He works for a
defense contractor, but does not currently have a security clearance. (Id.)
Guideline H – Drug Involvement
1.a. Applicant began using marijuana, at the age of 18, in about 1987; and used
the illegal substance for about ten years, “mostly on weekends,” until about 1996. (TR at
page 18 line 17 to page 29 line 4.) He resumed his marijuana use in about 2010 “when .
. . [his] divorce was in full swing and . . . [Applicant] felt sad . . . [and] alone.” (Id.) He
used  marijuana,  “two  or  three  times  a  week,”  until  his  last  usage  in  June  of  2017,  to
treat  his  “anxiety.”  (TR  at  page  18  line  17  to  page  29  line  4,  and  at  page  36  lines
11~17.)
1.b.  During  a  June  2017  interview  with  an  investigator  for  DOD,  Applicant
averred  that  he  would  continue  to  use  marijuana  until  his  self-diagnosed  anxiety,  and
related  stress,  subsided.  (TR  at  page  29  line  9  to  page  31  line  6.)  At  his  hearing,
Applicant recanted this averment. (TR at page 31 line 7 to page 34 line 9.)
Subsequent to his hearing, Applicant offered a letter of recommendation from a
“close friend” of “over 30 years.” (AppX C.)

"Under  Guideline  H,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  between
August 2009 and  August 2016,  while holding  a  security  clearance  he  received  in  April
2009. (SOR 1.a). The same conduct was cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR 2.a). In
response,  Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  and  provided  extensive  explanatory
remarks, as well as numerous documents attesting to his character, reliability, lifestyle
and  accomplishments.  (Answer)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old and works as an engineer for a defense contractor. After
graduating from college with a degree in electrical engineering in 2008, he was hired in
February 2009 by a large defense contractor. He worked there until February 2017, when
that company lost the contract on which he was working. Applicant then was hired by the
company  that took  over  the  contract,  working  there  until  February  2018,  when  he  was
hired for the position he now occupies. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; Tr. 38)
After  Applicant  was  hired  for  his  first  defense  contractor  job,  he  submitted  an
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on February 12, 2009. In
April 2009, he was granted a security clearance, which he has held ever since. Applicant
first  tried  marijuana  in  August  2009  and  continued  to  use  marijuana  sporadically  until
August 2016. He disclosed his drug use when he submitted his most recent e-QIP for
purposes of obtaining eligibility for top secret access with eligibility for access to sensitive
compartmented  information.  He  also  discussed  his  drug  use  with  a  government
investigator  in  August 2017. Applicant  has  never  failed  a  workplace  urinalysis  or  other
drug screening test. There have been no breaks in the employment for which he requires
1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.
2 The adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016,
to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017.
to  have  access  to  classified  information.  Applicant  never  bought,  sold,  or  possessed
marijuana.  Rather,  he  used  it  when  it  was  offered  to  him  in  social  settings,  such  as
camping trips, concerts, and house parties. In 2014 and 2015, Applicant had a girlfriend
who frequently used marijuana for pain management, and Applicant used it a few times
with  her.  Applicant  is  an  avid  outdoorsman  and  engages  in  a  variety  of  sports  and
endurance  events each  year.  He  averred  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana in  2016 for
health reasons, particularly because he was diagnosed with asthma. He was given that
diagnosis in 2012, but smoked marijuana on occasion thereafter. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; Tr.
29 – 36, 40 – 42)
Applicant also claimed that he was not aware of any specific proscription against
using marijuana as part of his employers’ drug policies; however, before he was hired for
his jobs in 2009 and 2018, he had to pass a pre-employment drug screening. He also
was aware that he could be fired if he tested positive for marijuana through workplace
screening. Applicant never used marijuana at work or with any coworkers; nor did he ever
use marijuana while traveling for work assignments. While he acknowledged that he did
not consider the work or security ramifications of his marijuana use when it was offered
to  him,  he  has  accepted  full  responsibility  for  his  actions  and  has  been  candid  and
forthcoming to the best of his abilities about his misconduct. (Tr. 23 – 28, 37)
Applicant has an outstanding reputation among his current and past co-workers
and supervisors, and others with whom he associates away from work. He submitted over
20  letters  of  recommendation.  Most  of his  character  references  were  informed that  he
had used marijuana, yet still vouched for his character and reliability. Applicant no longer
associates with anyone who uses illegal drugs, and he has a new girlfriend with whom he
is in a committed relationship. She does not use drugs nor condone such conduct. Finally,
Applicant has submitted a notarized statement of intent to abstain from illegal drug use in
the future. (Answer; AX A)
",True
"Applicant  admitted  the  sole  SOR  allegation  under  Guideline  H.  In  his  SOR
answer he noted that he disclosed his marijuana use in his 2017 SCA, and that his use
of  marijuana  was  legal  in  his  state  of  residence.  He  promised  to  discontinue  using
marijuana if required for his job or clearance eligibility. His admission is incorporated as
a  finding  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high  school  in  2006,  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2010,  and  received  a  doctorate
degree (Ph.D.) from a prestigious U.S. university in 2017. He is engaged to be married.
He has no children.
Between  2010  and  2016,  Applicant  worked  as  a  research  assistant  at  the
university  where  he  earned  his  doctorate  degree.  His  current  employer  and  clearance
sponsor, a federal contactor, hired him in 2016, and he has worked there ever since. In
his response to Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his May 2017 SCA,
Applicant disclosed that he illegally used marijuana between June 2005 and April 2017.
He stated that had not participated in substance-abuse counseling.
During his December 2017 background interview with a government investigator,
Applicant  confirmed  that  he  illegally  used  marijuana  about  weekly  during  social
occasions,  and  for  pain  management  for  sports-related  injuries,  between  2005  and
December  2017.  He  noted  that  his  fiancée,  siblings,  and  friends  were  aware  of  his
marijuana  use.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  was  not  marijuana  dependent.  He
promised  to  stop  using  marijuana  if  required  for  his  job  or  clearance  eligibility.  In  his
response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  stated  that  his  most  recent  use  of
marijuana occurred on May 26, 2018.

"In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a and 3.b. He denied the
remaining SOR allegations.  Applicant  is 63 years old.  He married in  1978,  divorced  in
2006, remarried in 2010, and divorced in 2012. He has three adult children. Two serve
in the U.S. military and the third is a state trooper. (Response to the SOR; Tr. at 8, 49-
51, 57, 63, 67, 83-85, 158-160; GE 1, 2, 3, 4).
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  the  U.S.  Military  Academy  at  West
Point  (West  Point)  in  1978  and  two  master’s  degrees,  in  1985  and  1991.  He  was
commissioned  as  an  infantry  officer  and  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1978  to  1985,
when he was honorably discharged. He has since worked for various DOD contractors.
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  worked  as  a  consultant  for  a  DOD  contractor  since
October 2018. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 1974. (Tr. at 5-6, 51-
57, 158-160; GE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A).
In  1998,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence
(DUI)  (SOR  1.a,  3.a).  This  was  his  first  and  only  alcohol-related  incident.  He  was
separated from his first wife. He was at a restaurant with coworkers and he consumed
six  12-  to  16-ounce  beers  over  the  course  of  approximately  four  hours.  He  felt
intoxicated.  He  wrecked  his  car  as  he  drove  home,  after  overcorrecting  in  an  effort  to
avoid a deer. The police took him into custody and cited him for DUI. He was sentenced
to probation before judgment; his driver’s license was suspended for approximately 90
days; he was fined; and he was ordered to make a donation to Mothers Against Drunk
Driving. (Tr. at 62-66; GE 2, 3; AE D).
Applicant  has  not  had  any  subsequent  alcohol-related  arrests  or  charges.  He
denied consuming alcohol to the point of intoxication and driving under the influence of
alcohol  and  while  intoxicated  on  numerous  occasions  between  2005  and  2015  (SOR
1.b,  1.c,  3.a).  He  denied  the  following  information  reflected  in  a  May  2015  report  of
polygraph  examination  that:  (1)  he  stopped  consuming  alcohol  after  his  2010  heart
attack;  (2)  from  November  2013  to  November  2014,  he  consumed  four  vodka  tonics,
totaling one pint of vodka, over the course of an evening four to five nights weekly, and
he drank until he felt intoxicated and then fell asleep three to four nights weekly; (3) he
had most recently  operated a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in February 2014,
after attending a poker game with friends and consuming three to four two-ounce shots
of bourbon over a four-hour period, and he would have likely been cited with DUI if he
had  been  stopped  by  police  on  this  occasion;  (4)  his  girlfriend  in  November  2014
expressed concern about the amount of his alcohol consumption; and (5) in his lifetime,
he had driven “a few dozen times” while feeling intoxicated but was undetected. (Tr. at
66-70, 112-124, 160; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant testified that he was either misinterpreted or he misspoke in May 2015.
He testified that he continued to consume red wine in moderation after his heart attack.
He acknowledged potentially consuming a pint of vodka over the course of a week from
November 2013 to November 2014; he could not explain how he may have misspoken
about  drinking  until  he  felt  intoxicated  then  falling  asleep  three  to  four  nights  weekly
during that period. He testified that his reference to the February 2014 occurrence was
to a friend in the poker group who had consumed bourbon and “was slurring his words”
when  the  friend  telephoned  him  to  notify  him  of  a  roadside  sobriety  checkpoint.  He
testified that he meant to state that he typically consumed a few drinks of red wine over
the course of approximately six hours at periodic poker games with friends. He testified
that his girlfriend did not express concern over the amount of his alcohol consumption in
November 2014. (Tr. at 66-70, 112-124, 160; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant acknowledged that as a single man, from approximately 2006 to 2010
and since 2012, he has belonged to a social activities group for adults whose principal
event  consisted  of  weekly  beach  volleyball,  where  he  would  consume  a  beer  or  two
over  the  course  of  a  three-  to  four-hour  evening  game  before  driving  home.  From
January to June 2015, he testified that he consumed around three to four vodka tonics
or  red  wine  nightly  to  treat  his  hip  pain,  as  further  discussed  below,  but  he  did  not
consider himself intoxicated on these occasions. Since his hip surgery in June 2015, he
testified  that  he  consumes  two  drinks  a  night,  two  nights  a  week.  From  mid-2015  to
February  2017,  he  testified  that  he  consumed  a  drink  or  two  socially  with  friends.  He
testified  that  he  was  careful  not  to  consume  alcohol  when  he  took  Oxycodone,  as
further discussed below, because doing so “is an instant prescription for falling asleep”
and “you’re a danger to everybody” if you drink, take Oxycodone, and drive. (Tr. at 66-
70, 112-124, 135-140, 160; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant denied that he knowingly circumvented appropriate methods to obtain
his  prescription  heart  medication,  Crestor,  twice--in  2013  and  in  2014  (SOR  3.c).
Though he had health insurance, his deductible was $700, which he could not afford on
his limited income as a consultant at the time. He testified that he informed his doctor of
such  to  no  avail.  He  testified  that  he  discussed  his  situation  with  his  sister  and  she
offered to send him her Crestor pills. On both occasions, she sent him a 30-day supply.
He believed she had a prescription for Crestor, but he could not recall whether she, in
fact,  did  or  if  she  obtained  a  prescription  for  him.  He  testified  that  she  paid  a  nominal
amount, sent him her medication, and he sent her a check for $65 to $75. He testified
that he did not think it was a big deal at the time. He does not anticipate this becoming a
problem in the future since the generic Crestor is now more affordable and he would be
eligible  to  qualify  for  Medicare.  He  also  testified  that  he  would  utilize  other
methodologies, such as declare himself indigent, go to the emergency room, or obtain
doctor  samples,  if  necessary.  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to  not  use  any  illegal
substance or abuse prescription drugs in the future, and that violation would result in the
revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 85-90, 143-147, 174-175; GE 2; AE E).
Applicant  denied  using  marijuana  in  December  2014,  and  he  denied  that  this
alleged  use  of  marijuana  occurred  after  he  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in
September  2005  (SOR  2.a,  2.d,  3.a).  A  December  2015  report  of  polygraph
examination reflects:
During pretest interview, [Applicant] reported that in December 2014, while
tailgating  at  the  Army  vs.  Navy  football  game  at  M&T  Bank  Stadium  in
Baltimore, MD, [Applicant] smoked marijuana. [Applicant] took a “hit” off of
a  marijuana  joint  that  [Applicant’s]  friend  passed  around.  [Applicant]  did
not purchase the marijuana or contribute money towards the purchase of
the marijuana. [Applicant] was aware of the policy regarding no illegal drug
involvement while holding a security clearance, but at the time, [Applicant]
thought “why not?” [Applicant] initially did not report this incident during his
previous  polygraph  on  06  May  2015  because  he  was  embarrassed  and
believed it was a one[-]time event.
Applicant  denied  that  the  marijuana  was  passed  around,  testifying  that  it  was  just
passed to him from his friend. He testified that he could not recall using the word “hit,”
but  stated  “I  think  I  used  the  word  drag.  .  .  .”  (Tr.  at  70-73,  81-83,  109-110,  125-132,
147-155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant also denied saying that he did not report his December 2014 marijuana
use during his May 2015 interview with the AGA (SOR 3.f) due to “embarrassment.” He
testified, “I can’t imagine that because I’m sure it came up . . . .” Rather, he testified that
he did not disclose it in May 2015 because he did not consider it a “use” of marijuana,
and he chose to volunteer the incident in December 2015. He continued:
Certainly  not  because  of any  embarrassment,  although  I  will freely  admit
that it was not my finest hour. But I do believe that it was, in fact, a one-
time event – and it was actually a one-time non-event.
He  denied  saying  that  he  chose  to  disregard  the  policy  against  illegal  drug  use  while
holding a clearance. He testified, “I would never say something like ‘why not.’ That’s just
not  in  my  DNA  to  even  respond  to  him.”  (Tr.  at  70-73,  81-83,  109-110,  125-132,  147-
155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant described the December 2014 marijuana incident as follows: he and a
group  of  40  other  individuals,  to  include  some  of  his  West  Point  classmates,  took  a
three- to four-hour bus ride to a football game. His hips “stiffened up quite dramatically”
during the ride, but they were not “horrible, they were just stiff and very uncomfortable.”
While tailgating, his friend, who had a medical marijuana card, offered him marijuana to
provide relief for his hips. He “stupidly . . . went to try it” and concurrently with doing so,
thought it was a bad idea. He testified:
I  pulled  the  smoke  into  my  mouth  and  .  .  .  it  was  just  so  incredibly
disgusting that I spit it out and had to rinse my mouth out, it was absolutely
off-the-chart disgusting . . . .
He  acknowledged  that  he  took  a  “puff”  of  the  marijuana  cigarette,  but  insisted  that  he
did not inhale or ingest it, he did not experience any effect from it, and he did not believe
it  rose  to  the  level  of  “use.”  He  testified  that  he  “ran  up  to  the  line  and  leaned  over  it,
perhaps, but . . . I do not think I crossed that line.” He signed a statement of intent to not
use  any  illegal  substance  or  abuse  prescription  drugs  in  the  future,  and  that  violation
would result in the revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132,
147-155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 2; AE D, E).
Applicant  denied misusing  the  prescription medication  Xanax  in  February  2015.
He  also  denied  misusing  the  prescription  medication  Xanax  after  he  was  granted  a
security  clearance  in  September  2005  (SOR  2.b,  2.d,  3.a).  He  testified  that  he  went
through  a  “manic  depressive”  period  during  the  military  deployments  of  two  of  his
children, the first deployment of which occurred in 2004. He described himself as:
I couldn’t relax. I . . . would stand up and then just start pacing. And, or I
was just like, I wouldn’t say lethargic, but . . . I found just found it hard to
care about things. . . . I was crazed. . . . I was freaked out.
He testified that in February 2015, his then live-in girlfriend suggested that he take one
of her prescription Xanax. He testified that he used one quarter of one pill. Within three
or  four  days,  he  testified  that  he  had  an  appointment  with  his  primary  care  physician,
who  prescribed  him  Xanax.  Though  he  felt  the  angst  related  to  his  children’s
deployments for a number of years prior to 2015, he had not previously been prescribed
Xanax. He used his prescribed Xanax for approximately three weeks and “it settled me.”
(Tr. at 51, 73-77, 79-83, 110-111, 132-135, 147-155, 162-171; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant testified that he did not believe he misused his then girlfriend’s Xanax
because he “used it in the manner that it was supposed to be used,” and he obtained a
prescription of his own shortly after. He testified that it did not occur to him that such use
was  illegal,  though  in  hindsight  he  saw  that  it  was.  He  testified  that  in  the  future,  he
would  go  to  the  emergency  room  rather  than  use  another  individual’s  prescription.  He
signed a statement of intent to not use any illegal substance or abuse prescription drugs
in the future, and that violation would result in the revocation of his clearance. (Tr. at 51,
73-77, 79-83, 110-111, 132-135, 147-155, 162-171; AE E).
Applicant  denied  misusing  the  prescription  medication  Oxycodone  in  December
2015.  He  also  denied  misusing  the  prescription  medication  Oxycodone  after  he  was
granted  a  security  clearance  in  September  2005  (SOR  2.c,  2.d,  3.a).  He  cited  to  a
series of health problems that started when he experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in
June  2010.  In  December  2010,  he  then  had  a  quintuple  bypass  surgery,  and  his
recovery period lasted for approximately one year. In January 2015, he was diagnosed
with  degenerative  problems  in  both  of  his  hips,  requiring  bilateral  hip  replacement
surgery.  He  underwent  the  first  of  two  surgeries  in  June  2015,  and  the  second  in  late
2015. He required an assistive walker, crutches, or a cane to walk, through March 2017.
(Tr. at 57-62, 77-83, 110-111, 135-142, 162-167; GE 2; AE D).
Applicant was first prescribed Oxycodone by his doctor after his first hip surgery
in  June  2015.  He  took  Oxycodone  daily,  as  prescribed,  from  June  2015  through
February  2017.  As  discussed  above,  though  he  consumed  an  alcoholic  drink  socially
from mid-2015 to February 2017, he testified that he did not do so on the days he took
Oxycodone. He testified, “[y]ou’d have good days and you’d have bad days . . . the pain
was, sometimes, absolutely extraordinary and, sometimes, it was not bad.”  He testified
that his prescription for Oxycodone varied:
Sometimes they would be for . . . ten 325s, sometimes for 20 325s. And,
and  when  I  say  20,  it’s  20  milligrams  of  oxycodone,  combined  with  325
milligrams of Motrin. Or, sometimes, 2,500 of Motrin and, sometimes, just
like 20 milligrams of oxycodone with no Motrin. So it was all, it was, kind
of, a mixed bag and it, you know, it was, you never knew what you were
going to get.
He never had more than a month’s supply at a given time, so he had to obtain a refill at
least  monthly.  To  do  so,  he  had  to  go  through  his  doctor’s  assistant,  a  nurse
practitioner,  to  obtain  a  signed  prescription.  (Tr.  at  57-62,  77-83,  110-111,  135-142,
162-167; GE 2; AE D).
In December 2015, Applicant was in severe pain. He testified that he was unable
to  obtain  a  refill  for  his  then  existing  Oxycodone  prescription  because  the  nurse
practitioner  was  on  vacation,  and  neither  his  doctor  nor any  of  the  administrative  staff
returned his calls. His sister, who resided in a different state, offered to overnight him a
bottle  of  her prescription  Oxycodone,  consisting  of  “twenty  pills  of  each  pill having  ten
milligrams of oxycodone and 325 milligrams of Motrin . . . .” He testified that “it got me
over the hump. It was a gap fill, until such time, as I could get another . . . refill,” which
occurred  approximately  less  than  a  week  later.  (Tr.  at  77-83,  110-111,  123-125,  135-
142, 144, 162-167; GE 2; AE D).
As with Applicant’s use of his then girlfriend’s Xanax in 2015, he testified that he
did  not  believe  his  use  of  his  sister’s  prescription  Oxycodone  constituted  misuse.  He
stated:
[Y]ou  could  say  that  my  .  .  .  method  of  acquisition  might  not  have  been
exactly  right,  and  I,  probably  could’ve  done  that  better,  but  in  the  grand
scheme of things, I was using it for the purpose that it was intended.
(Tr. at 77-83, 110-111, 123-125, 135-142, 144, 162-167; AE D, E).
Applicant testified that he did not realize then that he was doing anything wrong.
He  testified  that  he  has  since  learned  that  he  is  not  to  use  another  individual’s
prescription, and that in the future, he would go to the emergency room to obtain a new
prescription. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant testified that  the only medications
he  was  taking  were  for  blood  pressure,  cholesterol,  and  blood  thinner.  He  signed  a
statement  of  intent  to not  use  any  illegal substance  or abuse prescription  drugs  in  the
future,  and  that  violation  would  result  in  the  revocation  of  his  clearance.  (Tr.  at  77-83,
110-111, 123-125, 135-142, 144, 162-167; AE D, E).
Applicant  maintained  that  at  the  time  of  the  marijuana  incident  in  December
2014, his use of his then girlfriend’s Xanax in February 2015, and his use of his sister’s
Oxycodone in December 2015, he was eligible for a security clearance but he did not, in
fact, have one. He testified that he understood that his clearance was inactive because
he had been previously read off all classified programs and was not read back on until
around  2016.  When  confronted  with  the  AGA’s  October  2016  clearance  decision
statement,  which  reflects  that  he  had  “been  in  SCI  access”  with  the  AGA  since
September 2005, and he was granted eligibility for access to SCI by the U.S. military in
December 2010, he responded that any information reflecting that he was in continuous
access  was  “news  to  me.”  He  also  testified  that  his  interviews  became  “somewhat
contentious,”  and  he  did  not  have  an  opportunity  to  appeal  the  eventual  unfavorable
2016 AGA decision because he did not receive the appeal documents in the mail before
the  appeal  period  lapsed.  (Tr.  at  70-73,  81-83,  109-110,  125-132,  147-155,  160-162,
167-177; GE 1, 2).
Two of Applicant’s character witnesses, as further discussed below, testified that
they believed Applicant had a security clearance in December 2014. One witness was
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  October  2018  to  the  date  of  the  hearing.  This  witness
testified that he assisted Applicant with obtaining employment in October 2014 with the
DOD  contractor  for  whom  Applicant  worked  until  October  2018,  and  he  believed
Applicant’s work there required a clearance from its inception. A second witness worked
for  the  same  employer  as  Applicant  in  2014,  but  in  a  different  sector.  This  witness
testified  that  he  was  told  that  Applicant  had  “a  Top  Secret  SCI  clearance  and  he  was
over  in  the  cyber-division  for  two  years  --  2014  and  2015  --  as  a  senior  capture
manager.” (Tr. at 178-204; AE A, C).
Since Applicant did not believe he used marijuana in 2014 or misused Xanax in
2015,  he  testified  that  he  did  not  falsify  his  responses  to  sections  23a  and  23b  of  his
March  2015  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  or  section  23  of  his November 2015
SCA (SOR 3.d, 3.e, 3.g, 3.h, 3.i). He testified that he did not falsify information during a
May  2015  interview  with  the  AGA,  when  he  failed  to  disclose  his  2014  marijuana  use
(SOR  3.f).  He  also  testified  that  he  did  not  falsify  his  response  to  section  23  of  his
August  2017  SCA  since  he  did  not  believe  his  misused  either  Xanax  or  Oxycodone
(SOR 3.k). Sections 23a and 23b of his March 2015 SCA  inquired, respectively, about
the illegal use of controlled substances, to include prescription drugs, in the seven years
prior  to  the  date  of  the  SCA,  and  any  illegal  use  of  a  controlled  substance  while
possessing a security clearance. Section 23 of his November 2015 SCA inquired about
illegal drug use or drug activity, to include the intentional misuse of prescription drugs, in
the seven years prior to the date of the SCA, and any illegal use or other involvement
with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. Section 23 of
his August 2017 SCA inquired about the intentional misuse of prescription drugs in the
seven  years prior to  the  date  of  the SCA.     (Tr. at  90-99, 108-111,  147-155.  167-171;
GE 1, 2, 3).
Applicant,  however,  listed  his  December  2014  marijuana  use  in  response  to
section 23 of his August 2017 SCA, which inquired whether he had illegally used a drug
or  controlled  substance  in  the  seven  years  prior  to  the  date  of  the  SCA.  He  marked
“Yes,” listed “THC (Such as marijuana, weed, pot, hashish, etc.)” and explained:
I was at a tailgate for the Army-Navy Game on Dec 13th, 2014 and with a
bunch  of  friends  in  the  parking  lot;  a  friend  was  smoking  a  joint  and
passed it to me. I took one puff. This was the only instance. . . . One puff,
one time. I am completely at a loss to explain why.
When asked whether he intended or not to use marijuana in the future, he noted, “No,
this  was  a  stupid,  mindless  aberration.”  He  provided  no  commentary  that  he  did  not
inhale or ingest the marijuana, that he did not experience any effect from it, or that he
did not believe it rose to the level of “use.” (Tr. at 70-73, 81-83, 109-110, 125-132, 147-
155, 160-162, 167-177; GE 1, 2).
Applicant  denied  that  he  stated  during  an  interview  with  the  AGA  in  December
2015  that  he  intended  to  violate  a  state’s handgun  registration  laws  by  not  registering
his handguns, as required. He testified that he intended to state that he simply had not
gotten around to doing so. He testified that he prioritized his work and health issues at
the time, but he had no intent to keep unregistered guns. He testified that he complied
with the registration laws in November 2016 and registered his one handgun, as he had
given his second one to his son who is a state trooper. (SOR 3.j). (Tr. at 101-108, 155-
158; GE 2)
In August 2009, Applicant paid a prostitute for sex. He testified that this was the
only  instance  he  did  so.  He  was  single.  His  friend  suggested  it  after  Applicant  was
lamenting  about  his  dating  life.  He  testified  that  he  was  stupid  and  unaware  of  the
ramifications  of  his actions,  though  he  knew  his  conduct  was  illegal.  He  has  no  future
intentions of repeating such conduct. (SOR 3.b). (Tr. at 83-85, 142-143; GE 2).
Applicant’s witnesses described him as generous, trustworthy, reliable, and loyal.
They each testified that they reviewed the SOR. Two witnesses referred to Applicant as
a lifelong friend, having known him since their simultaneous attendance at West Point in
the 1970s. Both indicated that they have seen Applicant at least once monthly over the
past  10  years.  One  indicated  that  he  was  surprised  about  the  accuracy  of  the  SOR,
given  his  interactions  with  Applicant.  The  other  indicated  that  he  had  never  observed
Applicant consume alcohol to excess, use marijuana, or misuse prescription drugs. This
witness  testified  that  he  was  unaware  of  Applicant’s  1998  DUI  and  alleged  2014
marijuana use until he saw the SOR, and that he organized the group of 40 to 50 people
that  attended  the  football  game  in  December  2014,  where  Applicant  allegedly  used
marijuana.  This  witness  testified  that  he  held  a  security  clearance  his  entire  adult  life,
and  he  knew  that  illegal  drug  use  and  the  misuse  of  prescription  drugs  was  not
permitted while holding a clearance. If the SOR allegations were proven to be accurate,
he believed they were situational and not reflective of Applicant’s overall character. (Tr.
at 25-48, 178-204; AE B, C).
The  third  witness,  as  previously  discussed,  consisted  of  the  individual who  was
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  October  2018  to  the  date  of  the  hearing.  The  witness
referred to Applicant as his best friend, having known him since 1996. Applicant has, at
various  times  since  2006,  worked  for  this  witness.  In  addition  to  testifying  that
Applicant’s position with the employer for whom Applicant worked from October 2014 to
October  2018  required  a  clearance  from  its  inception,  the  witness  also  testified  that
Applicant’s  position  in  2013  when  Applicant  worked  for  the  witness  as  a  consultant
required  a  clearance.  He  described  Applicant’s  work  performance  as  impeccable.  He
testified that he socialized with Applicant at monthly poker games,  where he observed
Applicant consume alcohol responsibly. He indicated that he did not observe Applicant
misuse prescription drugs or use illegal substances. (Tr. at 178-193; AE A, C).
The fourth witness also referred to Applicant as a lifelong friend, having first met
him  when  they  were  coworkers  from  1997  through  2006.  From  2006  to  2014,  the
witness and Applicant kept in touch through an occasional email. In 2014, as previously
discussed, when Applicant and the witness once again worked for the same employer
but  in  different  sectors,  the  witness  testified  that  he  was  told  that  Applicant  had  a
clearance  in  2014  and  2015.  The  witness  then  served  as  Applicant’s  supervisor  from
2016  to  2018.  He  stated  that  Applicant’s  performance  was  exceptional.  He  described
Applicant as a responsible drinker. He indicated that he was unaware that Applicant had
allegedly  used  any  illegal  substance  until  he  reviewed  the  SOR.  He  testified  that
Applicant told him that he took “a puff of marijuana, but was sickened by it immediately,
and blew it out” in December 2014 at a football game. (Tr. at 193-204; AE C).
",True
"The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency (SOR ¶ 1.a) and purchased marijuana (SOR ¶ 1.b) from January 2010 to at
least  March  2018,  and  that  during  a  March  6,  2018  interview  with  a  DOD  authorized
investigator he  stated  an  intention  to  continue  using  marijuana (SOR ¶ 1.c). When he
responded  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  without  comment.  After
considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 57-year-old mechanical designer with post-high school certifications in
mechanical drafting technology and computer-aided drafting. His first marriage ended after
only  two  years.  He  was  married  to  his  second  wife  from  July  1989  to  February  2008.
Applicant has a 27-year-old son and a 23-year-old daughter. An innovative mechanical
designer, Applicant spent much of his career in the medical device industry, and he holds
patents involving medical methods and devices. Applicant has worked for his defense-
contractor employer in  computer-aided  design  since  March  2015.  He  seeks  a security
clearance for his position, although he understands that he can continue to work for his
employer without a clearance. (GEs 1-2; AEs B, E-F; Tr. 26-29.)
In 2007, Applicant was diagnosed with a degenerative eye disease. (AE C; Tr. 36.)
At the suggestion of his godson, Applicant began using marijuana in January 2010, initially
for degenerative discs and to relieve pressure in his eyes. (GE 1; Tr. 25-26, 55.) Applicant
continued to use marijuana approximately twice weekly as needed for pain or to sleep to at
least November 2018. He traveled to Asia for his then employer for seven weeks in April
2012.  He  did  not  use  any  marijuana  during  that  trip.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr.  35,  64.)  Applicant
purchased marijuana from his friends until July 2018. (GE 2; AE D.)
In January 2015, Applicant began outpatient psychotherapy with a licensed clinical
social worker for diagnosed depression and anxiety. He was honest with his therapist about
his use of marijuana. He advised her that he used marijuana at times when experiencing
heightened  anxiety  or  depression  not  adequately  addressed  by  his  psychiatric
medications.1 (AE A.)
Applicant took a pre-employment drug screen to work for his employer in early 2015.
He refrained from using marijuana before the test because he knew he would be  drug
tested,  and  “because  every  now  and  then,  it’s  nice  to  give  [himself]  a  little  break.” He
passed the drug screen. (Tr. 30-31.) Applicant understands that his employer has a policy
prohibiting illegal drug use by its employees, although the company has publicized that
medical marijuana use would be handled akin to alcohol abuse. (Tr. 30-32.)
Two years into his job with his current employer, Applicant completed and certified
to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on November 8,
2017. He responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he had illegally used
any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years, and disclosed that marijuana
“was and is sometime used” to control pain and stomach issues and relieve pressure in his
eyes. He gave estimated dates of January 2010 for his first use and September 2017 for
his most recent use. He answered “No” to whether he intended to use marijuana in the
future, but then stated “depends on the level of pain and discomfort I experience. I always
use this as a last resort because I cannot take vicoden [sic] for pain or discomfort because
it tears my stomach apart.” Applicant responded negatively to an inquiry into whether he
had been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production,
transfer, shipping, receiving, handling or sale of any drug or controlled substance in the last
seven years. (GE 1; Tr. 33.)
On March 6, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  He  admitted  that  he  used  marijuana  since
January  2010  for  pain  related  to  his  medical  issues  and  for  a  sleep  aid  because  his
stomach does not tolerate prescription medications. He expressed an intention to continue
to use marijuana for pain, and a high likelihood that he would use marijuana in the future
due to the pain associated with his medical conditions. He disclosed that he obtained his
marijuana  illegally  through  friends  who  legally  cultivate  marijuana.  He  obtained  a  half
ounce  of  marijuana  every  other  month  at  a  cost  of  $70  each  time.  Applicant  denied
socializing with any individuals who use drugs illegally. (GE 2.)
Applicant now acknowledges that he used marijuana probably a couple of times a
week since 2010. (Tr. 47.) He attempted to reduce or cease his marijuana use over the
past year, but he continued to use the drug to at least November 14, 2018. (Tr. 34-35.) On
July 20, 2018, he obtained a state-issued medical marijuana card authorizing him to use
marijuana legally in the state for the next year under its medical marijuana program.2  (AE
1 Applicant’s medications are currently being monitored by a psychiatry practice. He has been in treatment with
that provider since May 2016. (AE B.)
2 The state’s medical marijuana act was passed in 2005. Section 21.-28.6-4 of state law provides in part:
(a) A qualifying patient cardholder who has in his or her possession a registry identification
card shall not be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty in any manner, or denied any right
or privilege, including, but not limited to, civil penalty or disciplinary action by a business or
D.) Since obtaining his medical marijuana card, Applicant has purchased his marijuana
from  an  authorized  dispensary.  (Tr.  42.)  He  acknowledged  that  he  had  previously
purchased the drug illegally in half-ounce quantities every two months for $70 from friends
that grow marijuana for “compassion science.” (Tr. 48.) Applicant obtained his medical
marijuana card because after he applied for a security clearance, he wanted “to try to do
everything as legally as [he] can.” (Tr. 46.)  As to why he waited to late July 2018 to obtain
a medical marijuana card given he applied for a clearance in November 2017, Applicant
responded:
Because it wasn’t—I think the dispensaries may have just came around at
that point. I probably didn’t have the extra $300. And it really wasn’t an issue.
I  was  so  low-keyed  and  I  try  to  keep  everything  under wraps  that—I  just
didn’t  see  a  need  for  it.  But  now  that  I’m  here  and  everything,  I  want
everything to be—lay it out—I want to be honest. I want to be as legal as I
can. And that’s part of my problem is I’m way too honest. (Tr. 46-47.)
Applicant understands that marijuana use is still illegal under Federal law, and that
he had used marijuana illegally. The state in which he lived from December 2004 to May
2017  did  not  legalize  recreational  use  of  marijuana  until  December  2016.3  Applicant’s
current state of residency has not legalized recreational use of marijuana. Applicant looked
into the laws governing marijuana, but he did not see the illegality as an issue because he
was using marijuana for medical reasons in his home “to control things that [he has] no
control over.” (Tr. 52-53.) Applicant intends to continue to use marijuana, but not at great
frequency. He has never used marijuana at work. (Tr. 59-60.)
Applicant has not advised anyone at work about his marijuana use (“It’s used for
medical  purposes.  I  don’t  tell  them  all  my  medicines  I  take.”).  (Tr.  32-33.)  Applicant
continues to take medications for his eyes, but they create a burning sensation. (AE C; Tr.
occupational or professional licensing board or bureau, for the medical use of marijuana;
provided, that the qualifying patient cardholder possesses an amount of marijuana that does
not  exceed  twelve  (12)  mature  marijuana  plants  that  are  accompanied  by  valid  medical

and an amount of wet marijuana to be set by regulations promulgated by the departments of
health and business regulation. Said plants shall be stored in an indoor facility.
(b) An authorized purchaser who has in his or her possession a registry identification card

marijuana was purchased legally from a compassion center for the use of their designated
qualifying patient.
3  Effective  January  2,  2009,  that  state  decriminalized  possession  of  an  ounce  or  less  of  marijuana  and
imposed a civil penalty of $100 and forfeiture of the marijuana. Effective January 1, 2013, the state established
a medical marijuana program. Applicant’s eye disease is one of the covered conditions under the program.
The state legalized possession of one ounce of marijuana for recreational use by persons age 21 and older
effective December 15, 2016, but .
38.)  He  shared  with  his  optometrist  during  an  appointment  one  Saturday  that  he  had
smoked marijuana three hours before his appointment. She advised him that the relief in
eye  pressure  from  marijuana  was  only  temporary.  His  optometrist  is  not  licensed  to
prescribe  medical  marijuana.  (Tr. 39-40.) She corroborates his eye condition, which is
stable and currently being managed with topical medications. (AE C.)
Applicant’s outpatient psychotherapist indicated that, to her knowledge, Applicant’s
use of marijuana, “about once a week,” has not interfered with his work performance. She
has not seen any behavior by Applicant that makes her concerned. He has always been
trustworthy,  stable,  and  responsible,  and  she  has  not  identified  anything  about  his
marijuana use that, in her opinion, contributes to any security concerns. (AE A.)
Applicant’s psychiatric provider also attested to Applicant primarily using marijuana
for relief of pain and pressure related to his eye disease, and she added that the medical
literature supports use of marijuana for the condition. She also noted that Applicant finds
marijuana helpful with anxiety but that it was not the primary reason why Applicant uses
marijuana. She considers Applicant’s mood to be stable and his psychiatric symptoms well
managed. (AE B.)
",False
"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with some comments, nearly all of
the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.g.), drug
involvement and substance misuse (SOR ¶¶ 2.a., 2.b., and 2.d.); and personal conduct
(SOR ¶¶ 3.b. and 3.c.). He either denied or failed to address the remaining allegations.
Applicant’s admissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein as findings
of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
in  an  unspecified  position  with  his  current  employer  since  August  2015.  A  2013  high
school graduate, he earned some college credits, but no degree. He has never served
with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant has never been
married, and he has no children.
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant commenced drinking alcohol out of curiosity in 2006, when he was about
12 years old, and he continued doing so until 2008.  He generally stole a beer from his
father’s refrigerator two to three times per year. Starting in 2008, his consumption steadily
increased,  and  he  went  from  two  beers  every  three  months,  to  five  of  six  beers  every
three  months,  to  eight  to  ten  beers  every  two  weeks.  By  August  2013,  Applicant  was
consuming 15 to 30 beers on weekends at college. From May 2014 until January 2016,
he  drank  10  to  20  beers on  weekends.  In  January  2016,  he  was  drinking  on  a  nightly
basis, and on least one occasion, he consumed a 30-pack of beer over a two-day period.
(Item 4, at 123) His early curiosity about alcohol transitioned into believing that drinking
was “cool” and fun. He also enjoyed being “buzzed” or drunk. On at least six or seven
occasions, Applicant’s drinking resulted in his intoxication, and caused him to black out.
(Item 3, at 12-13) Applicant acknowledged that he would “get the shakes [and] need a
drink.” (Item 4, at 8)
On October 20, 2016, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant acknowledged that his use of alcohol
occurred only on the weekends. Because he became calm when intoxicated, he drank
seven to eight beers to intoxication about once every month. He denied having a problem
with drinking, and he expressed an intention not to stop doing so. (Item 3, at 6)
Applicant’s  relationship  with  alcohol  has  resulted  in  several  incidents  involving
either injury to himself or being charged with various violations. In January 2015, he was
observed  by  the  police  holding  a  beer  in  the  back  seat  of  a  vehicle.  He  was  issued  a
summons for possession of alcohol by minor. After pleading guilty to the charge, Applicant
was ordered to attend an eight-hour alcohol class sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk
Driving  (MADD).  Less  than  five  months  later,  he  was  again  issued  a  summons  for
possession of alcohol by minor when he was observed walking on a college campus with
a beer in his hand. After pleading guilty to the charge, he was ordered to complete eight
hours  of  community  service.  (Item  3,  at  5-6)  In  the  spring  of  2015  or  2016,  while  at  a
casino, Applicant became intoxicated, blacked out, got thrown over a blackjack table, and
he was transported to the hospital emergency room. (Item 4, at 7, 11, 53; Item 1)
In January 2016, Applicant consumed 10 to 12 beers and 3 to 4 shots of liquor
within a two-to-five-hour period at a house party. The following morning, he consumed
additional liquor. He then drove his vehicle, not caring that he was under the influence of
alcohol. He either ran a stop-sign and struck a moving vehicle, or he rear-ended a stopped
vehicle, depending on which version of the incident Applicant reported. When the police
arrived, they administered Applicant a field sobriety test, which he failed. He was arrested
and charged with driving under the influence (DUI). He was administered two breathalyzer
tests, both of which registered high percentages: 0.17 percent and 0.21 percent. (Item 3,
at 6, 12) He entered a plea of guilty to the DUI. Applicant was ordered to attend another
MADD program; directed to obtain alcohol treatment; required to have an ignition interlock
device installed on his vehicle for six months; and his operator’s license was suspended
for 60 or 90 days. (Item 3, at 6, 12)
Applicant acknowledged that his 2016 DUI was the result of an “irresponsible and
reckless mistake.” In his Answer to the SOR, He added: “I regard the situation though
unfortunate, as a catalyst to the curbing of my behavior in a much more responsible light.”
(Item 1)
Nevertheless, between July 2016 and October 2016, Applicant operated a vehicle
on five or ten occasions while he was under the influence of alcohol. He did so because
he thought he could manage driving, he was not traveling too far, or he did not care that
he  was  under  the  influence.  (Item  3,  at  13)  In  July  or  August  2016,  while  under  the
influence of alcohol, Applicant fell off a roof, and he was hospitalized for stitches on his
face and hand. (Item 4, at 7, 11; Item 1) On at least one occasion, after drinking in the
morning, he waited until the afternoon before trying to drive. That effort resulted in the
ignition interlock device recognizing that Applicant had consumed alcohol, and he failed
to unlock it. (Item 4, at 123; Item 1)
On October 14, 2016, Applicant enrolled in the intensive outpatient program of a
substance  abuse  treatment  program.  During  his  intake  assessment,  he  acknowledged
that his initial use of alcohol occurred when he was 10 years old, that regular use occurred
at the age of 19, and that over the six-month period preceding the assessment, he had
been drinking up to two beers per day, with binge drinking on the weekends. (Item 4, at
5)  He  underwent  individual  and  group  therapy.  During  the  program,  Applicant  was
diagnosed  under  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fifth  Ed.
(DSM-V), with Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe. (Item 4, at 19, 123)
Despite his participation in the program, Applicant admitted continuing his reduced
consumption of alcohol on several occasions in October and December 2016. (Item 4, at
49-50, 55) On December 19, 2016, the intensive outpatient treatment program ceased,
and Applicant was recommended to continue his goal of reduced alcohol intake, and to
continue ongoing substance abuse treatment on a weekly basis for individual therapy and
group therapy for additional support. He was prescribed naltrexone – a medication used
to  treat  alcoholism  by  reducing  the  urge  to  drink  alcohol  –  as  needed.  (Item  4,  at  46)
Applicant denied the SOR allegation and he contends that he completed the program to
its completion, and the Government offered no evidence that Applicant had failed to follow
treatment  advice.  As  recently  as  June  2018,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  continued  to
consume two to four drinks per weekend or less. (Item 3, at 16)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant was also a recreational substance abuser whose primary substances of
choice were marijuana, cocaine, and amphetamines. In addition, although not alleged in
the SOR, Applicant admitted that he was a frequent user of unspecified hallucinogens.
(Item 4, at 6, 41) As noted above, on October 14, 2016, Applicant enrolled in the intensive
outpatient program. During his intake assessment, in addition to the information furnished
regarding  alcohol,  he  acknowledged
in
approximately  2004,  when  he  was  15  years  old,  and  continued  his  regular  use  of
marijuana until September 2016. He used cocaine on various occasions from at least an
unspecified date in 2015 until at least October 2016. (Item 4, at 5-6; Item 1)
that  he  commenced  using  marijuana
Despite  his  participation  in  the  program,  Applicant’s  urine  toxicology  screens
tested positive for cocaine on several occasions: October 24, 2016; October 25, 2016;
October 28, 2016; October 31, 2016; and November 1, 2016, and he admitted continuing
his use of cocaine. (Item 4, at 55, 142-146) In addition, Applicant’s urine toxicology screen
tested positive for amphetamines on December 16, 2016. (Item 4, at 127; Item 1)
In his response to the interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged the use of Adderall
–  a  combination  medication  containing  four  salts  of  amphetamine  –  which  was  also  a
prescribed medication for someone other than himself, in February 2017. (Item 3, at 17)
That  acknowledgement  was  apparently  the  basis  of  the  SOR  allegation  that  he  had
misused Adderall. However, in his Answer to the SOR, Applicant clarified his response
and claimed that he had made a mistake because of confusion on his part. He contended
that the Adderall misuse was actually the same December 2016 incident reported as a
result of his positive urine toxicology screen tested positive for amphetamines. During the
program,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  under  the  DSM-V  with  Cocaine  Use  Disorder,  a
diagnosis  he  denied  being  aware  of.  (Item  4,  at  120,  123;  Item  1)  Starting  in  January
2019, and continuing until March 2019, Applicant underwent drug screens ordered by a
physician. All of the toxicology screens were negative. (Item 1 attachments)
Personal Conduct
On April 22, 2015, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to certain
questions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23 – Illegal
Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. The most significant question, and the one alleged in the
SOR, was essentially as follows: In the last seven (7) years: “have you illegally used any
drugs or controlled substances?” Applicant answered “no” to the question. (Item 2, at 24)
He omitted and concealed his subsequently admitted use of marijuana. He certified that
his  response  to  that  question  was  “true,  complete,  and  correct”  to  the  best  of  his
knowledge and belief, but, because of his omission and concealment, the response to
that question was, in fact, false. Applicant admitted the allegation. (Item 1) With respect
to the cocaine aspect of the question, the Government failed to prove that Applicant had
used cocaine at any time before he submitted the SF 86 in April 2015, and Applicant only
admitted that he had used it in 2015 and 2016.
On June 20, 2018, when Applicant completed his responses to the interrogatories,
he responded to a question pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in
Question 1 – Drug Use. He was asked to provide a complete history of his use of any
illegal narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), Cannabis
(marijuana or Hashish), prescription drug without a valid prescription, and any misuse of
a drug prescribed to you (e.g., taking more than the required dosage, etc.). Although he
acknowledged  his  misuse  of  Adderall,  he  omitted  and  concealed  his  subsequently
admitted use of marijuana and cocaine. He swore that his response to those that question
was  “true  and  correct”  to  the  best  of  his  knowledge  and  belief,  but,  because  of  his
omissions and concealments, the response to that question was, in fact, false. Applicant
admitted the allegation, and added that “the deliberate withholding of information I now
realize  was  unbecoming  and  illustrates  untrustworthiness.  I  believe  at  the  time  I  was
nervous  and  admittedly  frightened  of  the  consequences  for  disclosing  that  type  of
information.” (Item 1)
",True
"In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations.  He is 33 years
old.  He  is  divorced  and  has  four  children.  Applicant  completed  his  security  clearance
application in June 2016. He has not previously held a security clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  2004  and  attended  a  technical  school,
earning  a  degree  in  aviation  in  2011.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  as  an
electronic technician for eight years. He was unemployed for a period of six months in
2009. (GE 1)
Financial
The  SOR  ¶¶1.a-1.i  allege  two  child  support  collection  accounts;  four  collection
accounts;  one  charged-off  medical  account,  and  an  amended  state  tax  debt  for  about
$1,600. Applicant claimed that he has been paying his child support (deduction from his
pay check) and several other accounts. He stated that all his financial documents were
lost in a car accident in the spring. (Tr. 12)
Applicant  attributes  the  debts  to  his  overextending  himself  while  trying  to  take
care of his family. He explained that he decided to put off some creditors to pay others.
He  realizes  that  a  better approach  would  have  been  to  contact  the  creditors and  work
out  an  agreement.  (GE)  2  He  stated  that  he  has  reduced  his  spending  habits  and
concentrates  on  his  expenses.  Applicant  now  earns  about  $65,000  a  year,  which
depends  on  overtime.  He  is  paid  hourly.  (Tr.  38)  He  has  no  savings  and  little  in  his
checking account. He lives with his mother, and pays $100 a month in rent. (Tr. 39) He
uses his girlfriend’s car and pays the car insurance. (Tr. 71) He has not obtained credit
counseling. (Tr.57) He does not follow a budget.
As  to  SOR  1.a  ($13,000)  and  1.b  ($2,677),  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was
delinquent in child support, but explained that $432 is automatically deducted from his
pay  each  month.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not  pay  attention  and
money  was  not  deducted  for  child  support  in  2004  to  2008.  (Tr.  29-33)  He  does  not
know what the correct balances on his child support cases are at this time. (Tr. 36)
SOR  1.c  is  a  wireless  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,213.  Applicant
stated  that  he  is  now  making  payments  in  the  amount  of  $50  a  month.  (GE  2)  He
submitted one document that showed $50 was debited from his bank account on June
18, 2019. He stated at the hearing that he has a $400 balance, and he claims that he
started paying in 2016. (Tr. 21, 43)
As  to  SOR  1.d,  a  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $1,742,  for  a  security
system, Applicant intends to pay the amount due on the account, but he has not had the
money to do so yet. (Tr. 22)
SOR  1.e  is  a  medical  account  in  collection  for  $828.  He  has  not  made  any
payments on the account. He believes that the bill was for hospital visits.
SOR 1.f is a charged-off account in the amount of $455. He stated at the hearing
that he is paying $50 a month. (Tr. 23) He submitted no documentation. During his 2017
OPM interview, he stated that he would contact the creditor and make arrangements to
pay the account in full. (GE 2)
SOR 1.g is a collection account for the same debt that is listed in 1.d. However,
the  amount  is  $296.  He  stated  that  he  would  pay  when  he  was  able.  (Tr.  23)  He
believes they were two separate accounts. (GE 2)
As to SOR 1. h, a collection account for $600, Applicant stated that it has been
paid.  (Tr.  24)  He  submitted  documentation  that  reflected  a  payment  of  $25  that  was
made on October 6, 2018, showing a balance of $149.32. During his 2017 investigative
interview, he noted that there were two different accounts and that he cannot remember
which one he has paid in full.
The amended SOR 1.i represents a paper that Applicant brought to the hearing.
It is a letter dated November 21, 2018, showing a payment agreement for state taxes.
The payment plan was established for a period of 16 months paying $105.63 a month.
(GE  6)  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  that  he  has  been  paying  every  month.  (Tr.
53) He had no documentation to support his claim.
Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
The SOR alleges under AG ¶¶ 2.a-2.b that Applicant purchased marijuana on or
about October 2017, and information set below under criminal conduct.
SOR  2.a  alleges  and  Applicant  admits  that  he  purchased  marijuana  in  October
2017.  He  explained  that  he  was  buying  the  marijuana  for  his  girlfriend.  He  was
instructed to stop at a rest stop off a major highway, where he purchased the marijuana
($60) for his friend. (Tr. 58) As he was driving home, he was stopped by a police officer
for tinted windows. (GE 2, Tr. 62) The officer searched the car and found the marijuana
in the glove compartment. Applicant stated that he does not use marijuana or any illegal
drugs. (Tr. 62) Applicant received a criminal citation and made a plea agreement. (GE
5)  He  spent  a  night  in  jail.  He  has  had  this  expunged  from  his  record.  He  no  longer
associates with that friend. He understands that this was a “dumb mistake.”  He did not
report this incident to his FSO for fear of losing his job. (Tr. 64)
SOR 2.b alleges the criminal information in AG 3.a, that Applicant was charged
with  possession  of marijuana  in  October 2017. This  is the  same  incident  as  described
above under Guideline H.
Criminal Conduct
SOR AG 3.a alleges that Applicant was charged in October 2017 for possession
of marijuana. This has been discussed as cross-alleged under the above guideline.
SOR AG 3.b alleges the information as set forth in subparagraph 2.a. Again, this
is the same incident in October 2017 to which Applicant admitted.
Personal Conduct
SOR AG 4.a cross alleges the information as set forth under paragraph 2.a and
3.a  (drug  involvement  and  criminal  conduct)  as  adverse  personal  conduct  under  this
guideline. This is the same information that has been addressed above.
",False
"Applicant  is  alleged  under  Guideline  H  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  cross-alleged  under
Guideline E (SOR ¶ 2.a) to have used marijuana in at least November 2017 after he had
been granted a DOD secret security clearance in July 2006. Applicant is alleged under
Guideline H (SOR ¶ 1.b) and cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR ¶ 2.a) and Guideline J
(SOR ¶ 3.a) to have been arrested in November 2017 and charged with simple possession
of marijuana, driving under the influence (DUI), and possession of drug paraphernalia on a
U.S. military base. Also under Guideline E, Applicant allegedly “failed to outline the full
extent” of his November 2017 criminal conduct when he was interviewed by an authorized
investigator on February 21, 2018, and March 28, 2018 (SOR ¶ 2.b).
When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted the illegal drug use as
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and the arrest and charges as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, but he denied
that the conduct raised personal conduct and criminal conduct security concerns. He also
denied  that  he  intentionally  misrepresented  his  criminal  conduct  during  his  subject
interviews on February 21, 2018, and March 28, 2018.
After considering his response to the SOR, the exhibits, and the hearing transcript, I
make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  high  school  graduate.  He  and  his  spouse  began
cohabiting in July 2014 and married in May 2017. Applicant has a 15-year-old son from a
previous relationship. Applicant has worked for a defense contractor since July 2006 and
has held a secret clearance throughout his employment. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 26.)
To renew his security clearance eligibility, Applicant completed and certified to the
accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on May 2, 2016. Then
an operations supervisor with his employer, Applicant disclosed a trip to the Caribbean in
February 2016, but no issues of any significant security concern. (GE 1.)
In  January  2017,  Applicant  began  experiencing  physical  symptoms  that  were
medically attributed to excessive anxiety. He was prescribed an anti-anxiety medication,
but he did not like its affects so he stopped using it. He continued to experience anxiety,
and his father suggested that he try marijuana. Applicant accepted an offer of marijuana
“against better judgment.” (Tr. 43.) His father gave him some marijuana, a grinder, and a
glass pipe.1 Applicant used the marijuana on at least one occasion, which he indicates
occurred in early November 2017. He smoked it alone in his yard at home. He claims he
did  not  like  the  way  marijuana  made  him  feel,  but  he  did  not  discard  the  drug  or
paraphernalia. He stored the marijuana and paraphernalia in  the center console of his
truck. (Tr. 23-24, 28-31.) Applicant denies any other use of marijuana beyond that single
occasion, and any intention to use marijuana in the future. (GE 3; Tr. 29, 31-32.) Applicant
understood at the time that any marijuana involvement is illegal under federal law. (Tr. 32,
43.)
On November 17, 2017, Applicant drank excessively while socializing with friends
after  work.  His  route  home  passed  a  military  base,  and  he  “unwittingly,  unknowingly”
followed the vehicle in front of him onto the military base. He had a pass that allowed him
access for his work, but he had no reason to access the base at that time. Gate personnel
suspected that he had been drinking and asked him to pull over. He apparently failed a
field sobriety test and his blood alcohol level tested at .168% and .163%. Applicant was
arrested for DUI and his vehicle was searched. Marijuana and a glass pipe with marijuana
were found in his vehicle. (GE 3; Tr. 24.) He was released to his spouse’s custody, and
claims to have known only about a DUI charge at the time. (Tr. 33-34.) He was issued a
violation statement that he asserts “looked like a speeding ticket and it was barely legible.”
(Tr.  34.)  Applicant  was  charged  with  violating  state  and  federal  laws  for  DUI  and
possession of drug paraphernalia (glass pipe and marijuana grinder), and violating federal
law for simple possession of marijuana. (GE 3.) In late February 2018 or early March 2018,
Applicant was notified of a court date, which is when he submits he learned about the
marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia charges. (Tr. 34-35.) On March 27, 2018,
prosecution in U.S. District Court was deferred pending the establishment of a satisfactory
pretrial  diversion  program  for  Applicant.  Should  no  pretrial  program  be  devised,  or
Applicant reject the program or fail to comply with the program, the prosecution would
pursue the charges against him in court. The prosecution agreed to move for a dismissal of
the pending charges should Applicant successfully complete the program devised with no
admission  of  guilt  by  Applicant.  (GEs  2-3.)  As  of  April  2019,  Applicant  had  been
interviewed by a probation officer, and his house had been inspected, but he had yet to be
offered a diversion program. (Tr. 25, 36-37, 44-45.)
On February 21, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  When  asked  whether he  had  ever been
charged  with  an  alcohol-related  offense,  Applicant  responded  negatively.  After  being
confronted about an underage drinking incident in March 2000, Applicant admitted the
incident and that he was placed on six months of probation and ordered to attend alcohol

knowing before his father provided him the drug that his father had any marijuana in his possession. (Tr. 42-
43.)
education  classes.  Applicant  then  volunteered  that  he  had  been  cited  for  DUI  by  the
military police in November 2017. He stated that he had two beers while out drinking with
friends, and that in route home, he entered the base erroneously due to road construction.
Military  police  had  him  pull  over  because  he  did  not  have  his  identification  ready.  He
recalled  performing  field  sobriety  tests  but  claimed  to  have  no  recall  how  well  he  did.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  had  taken  a  breathalyzer  test  at  the  police  station,
although he denied any recall of the results. He admitted receiving a citation for DUI, which
he  now  asserts  was  “barely  legible”  (Tr.  21),  and  that  he  had  received  notification  in
December 2017 that his driving privileges on the base were suspended. He indicated that
he made a mistake and that he no longer went out drinking with friends. (GE 2.)
On March 28, 2018, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator to follow-
up  about  developed  information  that  he  had  been  arrested  for  simple  possession  of
marijuana, which he had not previously disclosed. When read the police record inquiry
concerning whether he had been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in
a criminal proceeding against him in the last seven years, Applicant volunteered that he
had disclosed during his previous subject interview that he had been arrested for DUI.
Then asked whether there were any other charges, Applicant volunteered that he had been
charged with simple possession of marijuana. Concerning why this charge had not been
previously disclosed, Applicant explained that he did not remember the charge  until he
received a notice to appear in court and that notice was received after his first interview.
When asked for an explanation of the circumstances of his arrest, Applicant asserted that
his attorney advised him not to discuss the case while disposition is pending. (GE 2.)
The  DOD  CAF  sent  Applicant  drug  interrogatories  on  April  26,  2018,  and  he
responded on May 25, 2018. In response to the final disposition of the charges, Applicant
provided the court records showing that he had agreed to a deferral of prosecution and
participation in a pre-trial diversion program. Upon completion, the charges against him will
be dismissed. In answer to whether he had ever illegally used any controlled substance,
Applicant stated, “I am embarrassed and ashamed to admit to the use of marijuana. I only
used once on or around the first week in November 2017.” Applicant denied that he was
currently using any controlled substance or that he associates with persons who use illegal
substances or frequent places were marijuana is being used. He took the opportunity to
add the following information:
When  I  initially  filed  my  10  year  red  badge  paperwork  in  2016  all  of  my
answers were truthful. However I was to [sic] embarrassed to admit the truth
when asked these questions by inspector [name omitted]. I made a mistake
that will never happen again. I love my Country and my job and hope the
mistakes that I’ve made will not jeopardize my ability to hold a clearance.
(GE 3.)
Applicant testified that in February 2018 that he and the investigator went through
his answers to the questions on the SF 86, and that he answered “to the best of [his]
knowledge.” (Tr. 21.) He later admitted  there were some discrepancies in some of the
statements that he had made because he was embarrassed. (Tr. 24.) He maintained that
he did not know about the drug charges before his February 27, 2018 interview, however.
(Tr. 33-34, 39.) He knew about the drug charges when he retained legal counsel on March
23, 2018. (Tr. 41.) When asked about his statement during his February interview that he
had consumed two beers before his arrest, Applicant responded, “I thought when I made
that  statement  that  that  was  accurate  when  I said it.” As to his current understanding,
Applicant expressed uncertainty as to its accuracy based on his blood alcohol content. He
admitted that he could have “potentially” had more to drink. (Tr. 27-28.) He acknowledged
that he had not told the OPM investigator that he had used marijuana because he was
embarrassed. (Tr. 40.) Applicant admitted that he still battles with anxiety. (Tr. 23.) He
provided no information about whether he had found a viable alternative to marijuana to
address his condition.
A co-worker of Applicant’s for the past 15 years has interacted with Applicant both in
subordinate and supervisory roles. For the past six months, Applicant has worked for him
in managing training for their department. Applicant has been innovative and current on
ways  to  develop  and  educate  employees.  He  has  proven  himself  to  be  “professional,
helpful, dedicated, extremely experienced, and a key resource” to their department and
employer. (AE A.)
",False
"The SOR alleges under Guideline  H that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency from July 2000 to at least February 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that he indicated
during a December 20, 2017 interview with an authorized investigator for the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) that there was a likelihood that his illegal drug use would
reoccur (SOR ¶ 1.b). (Item 1.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had
used marijuana from 2000 to 2018, but he had “no intent to repeat [his] transgressions.” He
explained that his marijuana use ceased in February 2018, and that he wants to be a good
role model for his son born in August 2018. Applicant also admitted that he had indicated in
December 2017 that his drug use was likely to reoccur, but he reiterated that he would not
use any illegal drugs. (Item 2.)
After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 2),
I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 32-year-old high school graduate with two semesters of college. He
attended college from  September 2005 to January 2006 and from September 2008 to
January 2009. He has yet to earn a degree. He has worked for his defense-contractor
employer since September 2008. In April 2014, Applicant began cohabiting with his spouse
in her home. They married in June 2015, and they had a son in August 2018. (Items 2-3.)
On  August  9,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86.) In response to an inquiry concerning
the illegal use of a drug or controlled substance in the last seven years, Applicant indicated
that  he  used  marijuana  for  the  first  time  in  college  in  September  2005.  He  gave  an
estimated date of July 2017 for his most recent use and explained that he had attended a
comedy show with his family and his cousin gave him “infused drinks.” Applicant denied
any intention of future illegal drug use, and added, “I plan on starting a family with my wife.
My kid needs the best of me.” Applicant denied any involvement in other illegal drug activity
in the last seven years, including any purchase. (Item 3.)
On December 20, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator, in part
about his drug use. He described himself as a social smoker. He reportedly indicated that
he first used marijuana at age “10” and most recently in July 2017 at the comedy show,
when he had drinks infused with marijuana. He explained that he used marijuana once to
twice  year  except  when  he  was  in  college,  when  he  used  marijuana  twice  a  month  at
fraternity  events.  He  denied  ever purchasing  marijuana.  He  admitted  that  there  was  a
likelihood that he would use marijuana in the future. Applicant volunteered that he had
received an email two months before his interview in which he was informed of declination
of an interim clearance for him. He indicated that he was given a list of possible reasons for
the denial but not a specific reason. (Item 4.)
Applicant was interviewed by another OPM investigator on February 14, 2018. He
indicated that he was a former marijuana smoker. He denied any use of marijuana since
May or June 2017 and any chance of future use. (Item 4.)
DOHA sent Applicant interrogatories concerning his illegal drug use. In his response
dated July 24, 2018, Applicant indicated that he used cannabis from July 2000 to February
2018 once a year. He admitted that he had used marijuana after applying for a security
clearance and stated, “The last big party before I have my son, wanted to go out for my last
hooray before parenthood.” He cited the upcoming birth of his son in August 2018 as the
precipitant in his decision to stop using marijuana because he needs to set an example for
his son. Applicant explained that his wife could verify his abstention. In the interrogatories,
Applicant  was  given  an  opportunity  to  review  the  summary  of  his December 20,  2017
interview. He adopted it without any changes. (Item 4.) It is unclear whether his use of
marijuana in February 2018 occurred before his February 14, 2018 interview.
When he responded to the SOR on September 26, 2018, Applicant indicated that
his son was born in mid-August 2018. He denied any use of marijuana since February
2018 and asserted that raising his son has become his “number one goal.” (Item 2.)

"Applicant is 50 years old. He earned some college credits, but not enough for a
college degree. He has been married and divorced three times.  He has two adult children
from his first marriage. He currently lives with a co-habitant, and also his mother, and his
younger  brother  recently  moved  into  his  home.  Since  November  2017,  Applicant  has
been employed full time by a defense contractor as a senior quality inspector. He does
not currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 12-13, 17; GE 1)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from
approximately 1990 to June 2017. He disclosed his history of marijuana use on his  SCA,
and he admitted this allegation in his SOR response.  (Tr. 17; GE 1)
Applicant  first  started  using  marijuana  at  the  age  of  21.  He  continued  to  use
marijuana until June 2017, when he decided to quit using it altogether. His heaviest use
of marijuana occurred during his early-to-mid 30s, when he used marijuana two to three
times per day. He used marijuana because he enjoyed it. He purchased small amounts
of marijuana over the years from his friends. Applicant no longer associates with these
friends. (Tr. 14-16; GE 1)
Applicant considered quitting his use of marijuana prior to June 2017. For the past
few years he had tapered off using marijuana. He realized that he no longer enjoyed using
it,  and  he did  not  like how  marijuana  affected  him mentally.  He finally  reached a  point
where he wanted to make positive changes and move forward with his life. He quit  all
marijuana use in June 2017. In November 2017, he was hired by his current employer.
(Tr. 16-18, 23)
Applicant’s employer required him to take a drug test prior to making him an offer
of employment. Three months after he was hired, Applicant was required to take another
drug test. He has never tested positive for any type of illegal drug. Other than marijuana,
he has not used any other illegal drug. He has never been cited for any offense related
to illegal drugs. He has never felt addicted to marijuana, and he denied any cravings for
marijuana since he stopped using it in June 2017. His co-habitant does not use marijuana.
Applicant  understands  marijuana  use  is  against  Federal  law,  and  is  unacceptable  for
individuals possessing DOD security clearances. In early 2018, Applicant signed a letter
of  intent  declaring  that  that  he  had  no  intent  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future,  and
acknowledging that any future illegal drug use would be grounds for automatic revocation
of his clearance. (Tr. 18-21, 23-25; AE A)
Applicant’s  work  record  is  excellent.  Within  15  months  of  being  hired,  he  was
promoted to a supervisor position. He takes a great deal of pride in his work for the DOD.
He wanted to be completely candid about his past drug use when he completed the SCA
in December 2017. He is steadfast in remaining drug-free and his co-habitant and family
are very supportive of his commitment. (Tr. 20-21, 24)

thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 14 lines
6~24,  and  GX 1 at page  7.)  He  has been employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since
October of 2016.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse & Guideline E - Personal
Conduct
1.a.  and  2.a.  Applicant  used  marijuana  “zero  to  three,  four  times  a  year,”  from
about January of 2013 until about February of 2017, about two years ago. (TR at page
15  line  16  to  page  16  line  21,  and  at  page  18  line  11  to  page  20  line  13.)  He  still

Applicant admitted that he used marijuana in late April 2017, and denied that he
held  a  security  clearance  at  the  time,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  According  to  his

Applicant admitted that on May 23, 2017, he tested positive for marijuana while
employed by a defense contractor (employer), as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. (Item 1)
Applicant admitted that he failed to disclose in his October 2017 SCA that he left
his employer in May 2017, subsequent to testing positive for marijuana, and he denied
that he left as the result of that incident, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. In his Answer, he said
that  he  left  for  a  different  reason,  (seemingly  to  start  another  position  with  a  private
company. 2) During an April 2018 interview with a government investigator, Applicant said
he did not disclose information about his marijuana use because he forgot about it. He
stated that after the May 23, 2017 test, his employer told him he would be suspended for
a week or two, but Applicant left before that occurred, as he claimed he had previously
intended to do. He did not disclose on his SCA that his employer told him he was to be
suspended for one to two weeks for the incident. (Items 2, 4)
Applicant admitted that he failed to disclose in his October 2017 SCA that he used
marijuana in April 2017, and tested positive in May 2017 while employed, as alleged in
SOR ¶ 2.b. He denied that he held a security clearance at the time or was terminated as
a  result  of  using  marijuana.  He  stated  that  he  left,  as  previously  planned,  to  assume

"Applicant  is  27  years  old.    He  is  not  married  and  has  no  children.    He  has  a
Bachelor’s of  Science degree  in  Electrical Engineering.    He  is employed  by  a  defense
contractor  as  an  Electrical  Engineer.    He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in
connection with his employment.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes his use of marijuana from
about July 2006 to at least June 2017; cocaine use from about July 2010 to July 2017;
and ecstasy use from about July 2010 to July 2012.  He has also purchased marijuana
in June 2017.
Applicant  attended  college  from  2009  to  2016,  when  he  graduated.    During
college he states that he used marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy at varying frequencies
for recreational purposes.  As a rough estimate, he believes he used marijuana in high
school from eight to ten times and in college probably five to eight times. After college,
he  used  marijuana  three  times  while  working  for  a  defense  contractor.  (Tr.  p.  29.)    In
regard to cocaine, he believes he used it five to ten times in high school and the same
frequency in college.  He used ecstasy two or three times at events in high school and
about the same frequency in college.  (Tr. p. 31.)  Applicant also purchased marijuana
on  two  occasions,  once  in  college,  and  once  in  June  2017.    He  states  that  he  also
purchased cocaine in 2011.
After  graduating  from  college,  Applicant  went  straight  to  his  position  with  his
current  employer  which  started  in  August  2016.    Applicant  knew  at  that  time  that  he
would be required to apply for a security clearance at some point as it was mandatory
for all employees.  He also knew that his company had a zero tolerance policy regarding
the use of illegal drugs.  (Tr. pp. 20 - 21.)  After being hired by the company, and after
working  there  over a  year, Applicant used marijuana  in  June 2017 on three  occasions
with the same person.  He also used cocaine with his cousin in July 2017.  (Tr. p. 28.)
Applicant states that he last used ecstasy in July 2012, and has not used ecstasy since
college.
Applicant  submitted  a  letter  of  intent  dated  December  7,  2018,  to  declare  his
abstinence  from  the  use,  purchase,  possession,  manufacturing  and  distribution  of  any
illegal substance.  The letter further states that any future misuse of any illegal drug will
be  grounds  for  immediate  revocation  of  his  national  security  eligibility.    (Applicant’s
Post-Hearing Exhibit C.)
A  letter from  the  Applicant’s  supervisor dated  December 5,  2018,  indicates  that
he  hired  the  Applicant  and  that  since  then  Applicant  has  been  an  excellent  electrical
engineer.  He is described as talented and hard-working and can always be counted on
to get to the work done.  He is said to be professional and respectful of his colleagues.
His  supervisor  recommends  him  for  a  security  clearance.    (Applicant’s  Post-Hearing

"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old senior software engineer, who has been employed by a
defense contractor since January 1, 2015.1 He previously worked as a subcontractor for the
company.  Applicant  began  cohabiting  with  his spouse  in  approximately October 2013.
They married in October 2017. In May 2011, Applicant was awarded a bachelor’s degree in
computational  mathematics  and  an  “All  but  Thesis”  master’s  degree  in  applied
mathematics. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 20-21.)
Applicant began suffering from depression as a teenager. He attempted suicide in
2006. (Tr. 22-23.) At age 18, he had suicidal thoughts that led to some psychotherapy and
medication management. He found the psychotherapy unhelpful and did not continue after
some initial contacts. (GE 2.)
1 Applicant testified that he worked as a subcontractor for his employer “right out of college in 2011 or 2012.”
(Tr. 20.) He provided dates for that employment on his SF 86 of February 2012 to December 2013, and
indicated that he started at another company (company X) in January 2014. At his hearing, he testified that he
worked for company X for about a year before becoming a direct hire of his current employer on January 1,
2014. The dates on his SF 86 would indicate a start date instead of January 2015 for his current employment.
The SF 86 of record was signed on January 6, 2015. (GE 1.)
While  in  college  from  August  2007  to  August  2011,  Applicant  experienced
depression that went untreated. In 2010, he attempted suicide while stressed because of
school demands. He did not pursue mental health treatment at that time. It was a wake-up
call for him. He left college in August 2011 before finishing his thesis, and he voluntarily
sought psychiatric treatment from December 2011 to March 2012. He took medication for
his depression for about six months with some improvement in his condition. Apparently in
consultation with his then treating psychiatrist, Applicant stopped taking the medication with
no apparent adverse impacts on his mental health for the next two years. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 22-
23.)
Applicant worked as an online sales manager for a computer hardware reseller and
then as an associate software developer, where he was placed as a subcontractor with his
current employer starting in February 2012. (GE 2.) In approximately 2014, Applicant was
diagnosed  with  a  medical  condition  that  can  cause  chronic  pain.  In  May  2014,  he
purchased his current residence. Stressed financially, often in a great deal of pain, and
very  depressed,  Applicant  had  impaired  functionality  and  was  unable  to  work  for
approximately one year. (Tr. 24.) He was not yet on appropriate medications. (Tr. 19, 25.)
He attempted suicide one time in 2014, but he has not had any suicide attempts since
then. (Tr. 29.) Applicant attributes his poor mental health at that time to his physical illness.
(Tr. 25.) His spouse held the household together while he spent much of the year in bed.
She had a small business. She paid the bills, purchased the groceries, and took care of
him. (GE 2.)
In mid-May 2014, Applicant began treatment from his primary care physician for
diagnosed depression and for some medical conditions, including a longstanding seizure
disorder, well controlled with medication. Applicant was placed on Zoloft to be reevaluated
in one month. He experienced moderate improvement in his depression by mid-June 2014,
and reported no substance abuse or suicidal ideation, but he continued to lack energy and
enthusiasm. He complained of some fatigue over the summer, and recurrent seizures led
to changes in his anti-depressant medication. By late August 2014, his depression had
increased to where he had some passive suicidal thoughts. Several medication changes
led to some improvement in his mood, but he continued to experience fatigue and pain. As
of late September 2014, his anxiety was interfering with his concentration, and he had
moderate depression but no substance abuse or suicidal ideation. By November 2014, he
was able to work from home. His depression was stable, and he had moderate control of
his medical condition that causes him chronic pain. (GE 3.)
Applicant experienced increased anxiety in late 2014 and early 2015 related to his
return to work. (Tr. 26.) From December 3, 2014, through March 24, 2015, Applicant had
nine counseling sessions with a licensed psychologist for treatment of diagnosed moderate
depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Applicant presented as moderately
to  severely  depressed,  chronic  and  recurrent,  and  he  described  overwhelming  panic
attacks that became debilitating and compromised his functionality. In the opinion of the
psychologist, Applicant’s symptoms were serious and interfered with his productivity at
work and home. His concentration and decision-making ability were impaired, and he was
at ongoing risk of suicide. Throughout their sessions, Applicant’s progress and prognosis
were assessed as poor. (GE 4.)
On  December  22,  2014,  Applicant  completed  and  electronically  certified  to  the
accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions that he signed on January 6,
2015. He disclosed that he had mental health counseling from December 2011 to March
2012  and  was  currently  in  treatment  with  his  primary  care  physician  and  the  licensed
psychologist. (GE 1.)
During an office visit with his primary care physician in mid-March 2015, Applicant
reported less pain on his medication regimen. His fatigue issues were in moderate control,
but  his  depression  was  in  poor  control.  He  was  placed  on  Cymbalta  to  address  his
depression primarily with a hoped for positive effect on his chronic pain and fatigue. As of
June 2015, the Cymbalta was no longer effective in controlling Applicant’s depression. He
complained  of  more  fatigue  and  worsening  musculoskeletal  pain  with  no  relief  from
narcotics. His primary care physician referred him to a psychiatrist. (GE 3.) Applicant began
seeing a psychiatrist monthly, although he did not follow through on her recommendation
that he obtain psychotherapy because he did not have the time, money, or energy. (GE 2.)
At the recommendation of a friend, Applicant began smoking marijuana in 2015 to
treat his chronic pain. Over the next three years, he smoked a bowl of marijuana twice
weekly. He found marijuana to be an effective pain medication, and he continued to use it,
knowing that it was illegal. After six months of using the drug illegally, he informed his
primary care physician about his marijuana use. His physician provided him information
about how to obtain medical marijuana in the state. Applicant did not apply for a medical
marijuana  card  at  that  time  because  it  was  cost  prohibitive  for  him.  He  continued  to
purchase marijuana illegally from an acquaintance. Applicant did not use any marijuana at
work. (GE 2; Tr. 17-18, 32-33.)
In early 2016, Applicant experienced debilitating pain from his medical condition. At
the suggestion of his psychiatrist, Applicant received treatment at a psychiatric hospital
from February 24, 2016, through March 18, 2016, for diagnosed major depressive disorder,
recurrent; generalized anxiety disorder; and unspecified cannabis-related disorder. He was
treated initially in a partial hospitalization program and then at the intensive outpatient level
of care. At discharge, he was referred to a psychiatric practice and prescribed medications,
including Lithium for suicidal thoughts, Nortriptyline for his depression, and Buspar and
Xanax (as needed) for anxiety. Nortriptyline improved his depression and pain sufficiently
so that he could return to work. (GE 2; Tr. 26-27.)
Applicant began psychotherapy for “severe depression and severe anxiety” with a
licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) in December 2017 after his psychiatrist told him that
he had to participate in psychotherapy if he wanted to continue in treatment with her. For
financial reasons, Applicant took a break from his psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW
from January 2018 until late February 2018. (GE 2.)
Applicant was denied interim security-clearance eligibility in February 2018. It had
no impact on his present duties. He discussed the declination of his interim clearance with
his  current  supervisors,  and  they  want  to  retain  him  if  he  is  denied  security-clearance
eligibility, but it could have future impacts as to project assignments. (Tr. 21-22.) Applicant
did not indicate to what extent, if any, he discussed the issues  that generated security
concern with his supervisors.
At the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant had a psychological evaluation by a
licensed psychologist on March 4, 2018.  Applicant’s diagnosis was complicated by his
medical problems and multiple medications, but his depression and anxiety appeared to be
prominent issues. Applicant disclosed his illegal marijuana use for pain, and he expressed
a plan to continue his marijuana use. He expressed uncertainty about whether he would
stop  using  marijuana,  even  if  required  for  his  security  clearance.  The  psychologist
diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe; generalized anxiety
disorder; and cannabis use disorder, mild, and concluded that Applicant has a condition
that could negatively impact his judgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness. In his
clinical  opinion,  Applicant’s  condition  is being  partially  treated,  but  Applicant’s “chronic
suicidal thoughts and recent ultimatum from his prescriber about starting psychotherapy
are concerns.” (GE 2.) He gave Applicant a guarded prognosis, despite finding it likely that
Applicant would continue in treatment with his present providers. The psychologist opined
that should Applicant discontinue mental health treatment, his reliability, judgment, and
stability would be negatively impacted. (GE 2.) Applicant had suicidal thoughts in 2018
because of financial issues, which have since been resolved with some financial help from
family members. (Tr. 19, 28, 47.)
In  May  2018,  Applicant  and  his  spouse  obtained  medical  marijuana  cards
authorizing them to use marijuana legally in their state.2 (Tr. 17-18, 40.) The drug alleviates
Applicant’s  insomnia  and  acute  anxiety  attacks.  (Tr.  31.)  Since  obtaining  his  medical
marijuana card, Applicant has used marijuana “pretty much on a daily basis,” although not
before reporting to work or before driving a vehicle.  (Tr. 33, 41.) He used marijuana the
night before his security clearance hearing, knowing that marijuana is illegal under federal
law. Before obtaining their medical marijuana cards, Applicant and his spouse discussed
the  possible  impact  on  his job.  Applicant  suspected,  but  did  not  know  for certain,  that
medical marijuana use is against DOD policy. Applicant admitted at his hearing that he is
‘probably not” willing to stop using marijuana to obtain a security clearance. Applicant has
tried  alternative  therapies  to  marijuana,  including  dietary  changes,  legal  medications,
tobacco, exercise, and cannabidiol, but they have not been as effective as marijuana in
addressing  his  pain  or  his  anxiety.  (Tr.  34-36,  45-46.)  Since  acquiring  their  medical
2 On October 1, 2012, Applicant’s state passed an act concerning the palliative use of marijuana, allowing a
licensed  physician  to  certify  an  adult  patient’s  use  of  marijuana  after  determining  that  the  patient  has  a
debilitating medical condition as defined by the act or subsequently approved by the state’s Department of
Consumer Protection and that the potential benefits of the palliative use of marijuana would likely outweigh its
health risk. Patients are required to have a written certification by a physician, which is valid for one year, and
are required to obtain their marijuana from a state-licensed dispensary. A qualifying patient who has a valid
registration certificate from the state’s Department of Consumer Protection is not authorized to possess an
amount  of  usable  marijuana  in  quantity  exceeding  that  reasonably  necessary  to  ensure  uninterrupted
availability for one month.
marijuana cards, Applicant and his spouse have obtained their marijuana solely from state-
licensed dispensaries. (Tr. 41.)
Applicant did not have any suicidal thoughts in the six months preceding his April
2019 hearing, but suicidal thoughts have been a recurring issue for him his entire adult life.
(Tr.  30.)  He  has  been  taking  a  new  medication  in  the  past  few  months  that  has  been
helpful. (Tr. 28.) Applicant has been under the care of his current psychotherapist since
January 2019. (Tr. 31.)
Applicant’s spouse testified that she has seen a marked improvement in Applicant’s
mental health in the last year. (Tr. 38.) In her opinion, his depression has lessened as he
has been able to get his physical pain under control. (Tr. 39.)
Applicant showed his spouse his latest work performance evaluation, which was
very positive. He obtained a raise and a promotion in January 2019 to senior software
engineer. (Tr. 42-43.)

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant did not timely disclose his marijuana use because he did not think about
his duty to disclose that information to his security officer. (Tr. 25) In Appellant’s October
2, 2017 SCA, he admitted use of marijuana on two occasions on float trips2 in August
2015 and August 2017. (GE 1) He said he took one “hit” from a marijuana cigarette on
both  occasions,  and  he  did  not  enjoy  his  marijuana  use.  (GE  1)  Applicant’s  statement
during  his  Office  of  Personnel  Management  personal  subject  interview,  in  his  SOR
response, and at his hearing were all consistent with his disclosure of marijuana use in
his October 2, 2017 SCA. (SOR response, GE 1, GE 2)

with users of illegal drugs. (Tr. 26; SOR response ¶ 2.2.1.) He met with a counselor on

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  two  of  the  factual  allegations
pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse of the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.);
and two of the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR ¶¶ 2.d. and 2.f.).
He  denied  the  remaining  allegations  as  well  as  the  principal  allegation  pertaining  to
personal  conduct  (SOR  ¶  3.b.).  Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  mechanic  with  his  current  employer  since  February  2014.  A  2000  high  school
graduate, Applicant attended a technical institute and received a heating, ventilation, and
air conditioning (HVAC) certification in 2001. He has never served with the U.S. military.
He  was  granted  an  interim  security  clearance  at  some  unspecified  point  between
September 2016 and February 2018.1 Applicant has never been married, but he has six
children, born in 2002, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2016.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
(SOR  ¶  1.a.):  Applicant  was  a  substance  abuser  whose  primary  substance  of
choice was marijuana. He started using and purchasing marijuana in 1997, when he was
approximately  15  years  old.  He  started  smoking  marijuana  at  least  weekly,  and  that
1 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February 19, 2018), at 8.
frequency continued until approximately 2012 or 2013. Thereafter, until December 2017,
he  purportedly  reduced  his  marijuana  use  to  one  or  two  times  per  year.  During  his
interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in
February 19, 2018, Applicant admitted that his most recent use of marijuana occurred two
weeks before he was interviewed.2 However, he changed his story in his response to the
interrogatories when he stated that his last and most recent use of marijuana occurred in
December 2017.3 Regardless of the most recent date, Applicant’s last use was well after
he  submitted  his  2016  e-QIP.  Applicant  indicated  that  marijuana  made  him  calm  and
enabled him to relax. While he did not consider himself to be dependent upon marijuana,
as  of  his  OPM  interview,  he  was  unable  to  quit  altogether.  Applicant  never  grew
marijuana, and he generally purchased it “off the streets,” as he does not have a supplier.
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): In November 2015, while in a foreign country, Applicant was arrested
by the local police for suspected violations of the Cannabis Control Act and the nation’s
customs law. A female friend whom Applicant had met during a temporary assignment in
the  United  States  shipped  him  a  package  containing  marijuana  cookies.  Applicant
claimed that he was unaware that the package had been shipped to him, that he never
expected  it,  and  that  he  never  received  it.  The  package  was  intercepted  by  customs
authorities. On November 23, 2015, pursuant to a search warrant, the police searched
his  hotel  room  and  seized  a  glass  pipe  containing  traces  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was
arrested and taken to the local precinct where he was held for 21 days, after which the
local prosecutor declined to prosecute Applicant. He was released.4
Applicant  stated  that  he  decided  to  stop  using  marijuana  due  to  new  religious
beliefs; that he no longer associates with persons using illegal substances; and that he
no  longer  frequents  locations  where  drugs  are  being  used.  In  his  responses  to  the
interrogatories,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  had  never  participated  in  a  drug  or
alcohol  treatment  rehabilitation  program,  or  received  any  counseling.  Instead,  he
practices self-control and prays. However, in his response to the FORM, he stated that
he planned to attend his first Narcotics Anonymous meeting on April 1, 2019.5
In  addition  to  marijuana,  Applicant  also  had  a  relationship  with  cocaine,  not  by
using it, but rather by selling it as a sideline activity to raise extra cash. He contended that
he last did so about seven years before his 2018 OPM interview, which would make his
most recent sale as taking place in approximately 2011.
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): On or about July 2, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with
possession of a firearm while in possession of drugs, a felony; and manufacturing, sales,
and possession of a controlled substance, also a felony. The controlled substance was

approximately one gram of cocaine. The charges were dismissed in September 2003.6
Applicant contended that the charges were dismissed because the search of his vehicle
was “illegal.”7
Criminal Conduct
In  addition  to  the  criminal conduct  associated  with  Applicant’s  drug  involvement
and substance misuse, described above, Applicant has a history of arrests and charges
for a variety of activities:
(SOR ¶ 2.b.): On May 24, 2010, he was charged with contempt of court for failure
to appear, a misdemeanor. On December 9, 2011, he was found guilty of the charge, and
he was ordered to pay restitution;8
(SOR ¶ 2.c.): On November 24, 2010, he was charged with contempt of court. No
disposition was recorded;9
(SOR ¶ 2.d.): On October 28, 2011, after being in a bar fight protecting the mother
of  one  of  his  children  from  an  assault,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  malicious
wounding, a felony. He and the other individual involved remained in jail overnight. At the

(SOR ¶ 2.f.): On June 24, 2016, he was arrested and charged with assault and
battery on a family member, a misdemeanor, after he slapped his daughter in the face,
busting her lip. The child’s mother called the police. Applicant appeared in the juvenile
and domestic relations court in July 2017, and the court ordered a two-year deferment
(under  advisement)  with  eventual  and  dismissal,  providing  Applicant  completes  a
parenting class and an anger management course.12 Thus, he remains in this status until
July  2019.  As  of  February  19,  2018,  Applicant  claimed  that  he  had  completed  the

acknowledged  that  he  had  not  yet  taken  the  anger  management  course,  and  such  a
course  was  not  yet  scheduled.13  As  of  the  closing  of  the  record,  Applicant  had  not
submitted any evidence that he had completed the anger management course, that the
charges had been dismissed, or that he remains “under advisement.”
Personal Conduct
(SOR ¶ 3.a.): This allegation cross-references the SOR allegations associated
with Applicant’s drug involvement and substance misuse, and criminal conduct.
(SOR ¶ 3.b.):  On September 9, 2016, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he
responded to certain questions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found
in  Section  23.  The  most  significant  question,  and  the  one  alleged  in  the  SOR,  was
essentially  as follows: In the  last  seven  (7) years have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance includes injecting, snorting,
inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming any drug or controlled
substance. Two other questions, while not alleged in the SOR,14 were also asked: In the
last  seven  (7)  years  have  you  been  involved  in  the  illegal  purchase,  manufacture,
cultivation,  trafficking,  production,  transfer,  shipping,  receiving,  handling  or  sale  of  any
drug  or  controlled  substance?;  and  Have  you  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been
involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other
than previously listed? Applicant answered “no” to the combined questions.15 He omitted
the  November  2015  violation  of  the foreign Cannabis Control Act and  customs  law for
which he was in jail for 21 days; his admitted use of marijuana that continued until after
the e-QIP was completed; his purchases of marijuana; and the fact that he held an interim
security clearance at some unspecified point between September 2016 (when he was still
using marijuana) and February 2018. He certified that his responses to those questions
were “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, because
of his omissions, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.
Other than simply denying that he had deliberately falsified material facts in his e-
QIP, Applicant has not offered any explanations for the omissions. He did not claim, for
13 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 6.
14 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No.

"Applicant is 27 years old and unmarried. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2014.
(GE 1) In April 2017, he began a position with a Federal contractor. Prior to this job, he
worked for a private company. (GE 1)
Applicant disclosed a history of illegal drug abuse in his May 2017 SCA. He was
arrested for possessing marijuana in July 2010 and July 2016. (GE 1) The 2010 charge
was expunged. Applicant was fined $300 for the 2016 charge. (Tr. 21; GE 1, GE 2, GE
3) Applicant disclosed that he first used marijuana in April 2010, and claimed that his last
use was in July 2014. He noted that he used it five to ten times, purchased marijuana five
times while in college and high school, and used LSD twice while in college. (GE 1)
On April 20, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM). He told the investigator that he used marijuana beyond
the  July  2014  date  he  disclosed  in his  May 2017  SCA.  He  stated he  continued to  use
marijuana infrequently after July 2014. He stated he did not feel dependent on the drug.
(GE 2)
Applicant  intends  to  continue  possessing  and  using  marijuana  because  he
believes that it does not affect his ability to perform his job. He used it twice in the week
before his hearing, including the day before. He uses it socially, generally about twice a
week. He does not have a recognized medical reason for using it.1 He is aware that his
recreational  use  is  illegal  under  both  his  state’s  and  Federal  law.  He  used  it  after  he
completed his May 2017 SCA. (Tr. 18-19, 28) He has never been given a drug screening
by his current employer. He does not know if his current employer has a zero-tolerance
policy related to using illegal drugs. (Tr. 28-29)
Applicant  submitted  four  letters  of  recommendation  from  members  of  his
employer’s  supervisory  staff.  All  of  them  compliment  Applicant  for  his  high  level  of
performance and reliability. (AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D) Applicant said these people are
aware of his marijuana use, although they did not comment on it. (Tr. 25)
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old. He married in 1984 and has three grown children. He
earned a bachelor’s degree and a doctorate degree from a prestigious university. He is a
renowned expert in his field. He started his own company in 1992, which has received
defense  contracts  throughout  the  years.  Applicant  has  held  a  security  clearance  since
approximately 1988, at various levels, including secret, top secret, and access to sensitive
compartment information.1
Applicant admitted that from about 1977 to about August 2017, he used marijuana
with varying frequency. He used marijuana while holding a security clearance from about
December 1998 to August 2017.2 He admitted that he purchased marijuana from about
October 2016 to August 2017, while granted access to classified information.3
Applicant completed security clearance applications (SCA) in November 2006 and
June  2012.  He  admitted  he  deliberately  falsified  material  facts  in  both  SCAs  by  not
disclosing his previous marijuana use, and his use while holding a security clearance.4
In November 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He
told  the  investigator  that  he  had  been  told  over  the  years,  dating  back  to  when  he
completed his first SCA, that he should answer “no” to the questions on the SCA related
to drugs. He declined to disclose to the investigator who told him to answer untruthfully.
1 Item 4.
2 Items 2, 3. The SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana from December 1998 to about August 2017, while
holding a security clearance. The evidence included in the FORM shows Applicant held a clearance from
1988 to August 2017, and during that time he used marijuana. I will only consider the time period alleged
in  the  SOR  for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  consider  the  total  period  when  making  a  credibility
determination, in mitigation, and in my whole-person analysis.
3 Items 2, 3, 7; AE A.
4 Items 5, 6.
He stated that there was never an issue in his mind that his marijuana use was impacting
national security.5 In his answer to the SOR, he stated:
In 1986, at the age of 26 and just coming out of college and applying for my
first clearance, it was recommended to me by a superior that I disavow any
marijuana use. I did just that, and that lie carried forward through the years
and subsequent security clearance applications. I note that I have held a
security  clearance  since  1986 and  there  has  been  no other  drug use,  no
other lies, and no other violations.6
Applicant  stated  in his  answer  and  FORM  responses  that  he used marijuana  at
social gatherings beginning in 1977. He said his use was more sporadic and not monthly.
This was a correction from what he told the investigator regarding monthly use.7
In 2015 and 2016, Applicant was working a full time job, which was stressful, and
he also founded a non-profit foundation to purchase a recreational area he felt passionate
about. The stress of dealing with both affected his health. He indicated that for a variety
of medical reasons, including stress and anxiety, two health care providers recommended
that he obtain a medical marijuana card, which allowed him to purchase marijuana under
the  state  law  where  he  was  living.  He  admitted  these  health  care  professionals  were
unaware that Applicant held a security clearance. He obtained the medical marijuana card
in October 2016. At that point his family and friends became aware of his use.8
After  receiving  the  medical  marijuana  card,  he  purchased  marijuana  from
dispensaries. He began to use marijuana daily and multiple times a day using a vape pen.
He also smoked it from a pipe and consumed it through edibles. He indicated it lowered
his anxiety, and he continued his pattern of use until approximately April 2017, when the
effect  of  the  drug  began  having  a  negative  impact  on  him.  It  made  him  paranoid  and
nervous. He continued to use marijuana daily despite the negative effects until June 2017,
when  he  decided  to  stop  using  it.  Applicant  went  through  three  days  of  withdrawal
symptoms,  and  then  felt  better.  Since  ceasing  daily  use  of  marijuana  in  June  2017,
Applicant has used marijuana on two other occasions. He indicated that he inhaled it once
on two separate occasions. His explanation for using it two more times was to confirm
that marijuana still had an undesirable and unpleasant effect on him. Applicant told the
government investigator that he does not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug
in the future.9
5 Item 7.
6 Item 2. Presumably, Applicant is referring to no other drug use other than marijuana.
7 Items 2, 3, 7; AE A.
8 Items 2, 3, 7; AE A.
9 Items 2, 7; AE A.
Applicant sought legal advice about the status of his company and the effect his
disclosure about using marijuana while holding a security clearance would have on it. He
was advised to step aside from his company until his drug use issue was resolved, which
he did. He then reported his marijuana use to his facilities security officer and the chief
executive officer.10
In Applicant’s response to the FORM he stated:
I have used marijuana more or less most of my life, in a manner similar to
alcohol, and I did not disclose it on my security clearance applications. In
my view of previous settled cases, I can truthfully think of no basis and no
argument  that  would  allow,  under  current  law,  for  me  to  hold  a  security
clearance.11
Applicant indicated in his answer to the SOR that his expertise in his field warrants
reinstating his security clearance. In his FORM response, he indicated that he genuinely
believes he is a good and honest person except for this one serious indiscretion. He has
unique experience and capabilities that could benefit the safety of our country. Applicant
apologized  for  his  actions  and  accepts  that  he  let  his  colleagues,  family,  and  country
down.12

"Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  purchased  and  used
methamphetamine with varying frequency from April 1995 through at least March 2015,
and that he manufactured methamphetamine from approximately March 2012 through at
least July 2012. The SOR further alleges that in July 2012, Applicant was arrested and
charged with unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance, he later pled guilty and was
sentenced to three years’ probation and fined. Applicant violated his probation, and it was
revoked.
Under  Guideline  J,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  in  2002  and
charged  with  receiving  stolen  property,  and  was  arrested  in  2007  and  charged  with
receiving stolen property and flight to avoid in-state detainer. The SOR cross-alleges the
July 2012 arrest, conviction, and sentence. It further alleges that in March 2015, Applicant
was arrested and charged with burglary, he pled guilty and was sentenced to 12 months
imprisonment to be served concurrently with the 22 months of probation that had been
revoked  from  the  July  2012  arrest  and  conviction.  Applicant  admits  each  of  the
allegations,  offers  brief  explanations,  and  states  that  since  he  was  released  from
incarceration, he has paid his fines and is no longer on probation. Applicant’s admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  janitor  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  April
2017. Applicant has two minor children. (GX 3.) Applicant first use methamphetamine in
April 1995 while at a party with a friend. He states that he became immediately addicted.
He began to use methamphetamine, which he purchased on the street, daily. Over time,
Applicant turned to theft to support his addiction, which resulted in the 2002 and 2007
arrests. (GX 3; GX 4; GX 5.)
In  2012,  Applicant’s  addiction  escalated  and  he  began
to  manufacture
methamphetamine at home. His mother reported his activity to the police and Applicant
was arrested and charged with manufacturing a controlled substance. He served 17 days
in jail, and was sentenced to three years’ probation. Despite being on probation, Applicant
continued  to  use  methamphetamine.  In  March  2015,  he  broke  into  a  residence
presumably  to  steal  items,  but  did  not  take  anything.  Applicant  was  alarmed  by  his
behavior and, recognizing that he needed help with his addiction, sought out local law
enforcement and turned himself in for arrest. (GX 3.) He was arrested and charged with
burglary and his probation was revoked. Applicant pled guilty and was incarcerated from
March 2015 until January 2017. (GX 3; GX 4.)
Applicant successfully completed a drug treatment program and was accepted for
work  release  in  approximately  September  2016.  He  was  released  from  prison  and
successfully  completed  his  probation  in  January  2017.  He  has  been  working  for  his
current employer since April 2017, where he has been a crew leader for more than one
year.  He  has  fully  paid  his  fines.  (Response;  Answer.)  Applicant’s  employer  is  an
employment rehabilitation and placement program familiar with Applicant’s background.
As  a  condition  of  employment,  Applicant  was  required  to  undergo  a  background
investigation and submit to a drug screening.
Applicant fully disclosed his prior drug use and related arrests on his e-QIP and
openly  discussed  them  during  his  personal  subject  interview.  He  is  remorseful  for  the
harm  he  caused  his  family  and  himself,  including  the  financial  strain  he  placed  on  his
family  because  he  was  unable  to  maintain  steady  employment  during  his  addiction.
Applicant  has  not  used  methamphetamine  or  any  other  illegal  substance  since  March
2015. He has no intention of using drugs or participating in criminal conduct in the future.
His professional and personal lives are stable and he is supporting himself financially. He
stated that “everyone” is aware of his past drug addiction and related criminal conduct.
(GX  4.)  Applicant  stated  his  intention  to  never  used  drugs  in  the  future  on  his  signed,
sworn e-QIP.

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  2.a-2.c,  and  2.e-2.h,  all  with  explanations.
He  denied  SOR  ¶  2.d,  also  with  an  explanation.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years old. He and his wife have been married for five years. He
has  three  children,  ages  27,  21,  and  16,  from  prior  relationships,  and  a  16-year-old
stepson.  Applicant  joined  the  Navy  after  high  school,  and  served  for  20  years,  from
1989  to  2009.  He  retired  as  a  petty  officer  second  class  (E-5).  He  held  a  clearance
during  his  entire  Navy  career.  (Tr.  43-47,  52-54,  74,  76,  147-148;  GE  1;  GE  3;
Attachments (Att.) B & H to GE 9)
After  retiring  from  the  Navy,  Applicant  was  a  full-time  student  at  a  community
college for about a year (2009-2010). During that time, he was unemployed. He worked
at a computer help desk for two defense contractors in 2010 and 2011. He spent much
of  the  next  two  years  (2011-2013)  working  in  Afghanistan  supporting  U.S.  military
forces. (GE 1; Att. B to GE 9)
Applicant  returned  from  Afghanistan  in  December  2013,  when  his  employer’s
contract ended. He was then unemployed from about January to March 2014. He was
briefly  employed  from  March  to  June  2014,  and  was  then  unemployed  again  until
October  2014.  Since  then,  he  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  in  the  field  of
information technology. (GE 1) He does not currently hold a clearance. (Tr. 159-160) He
earns $45,000 annually, and gets $1,200 a month in retirement pay. (Tr. 46-49, 51-52,
144-145; GE 1; Attachment (Att.) B to GE 9)
After he left the Navy, Applicant used marijuana on social occasions with friends
about seven times between November 2009 and November 2014. (Tr. 93-94, 114-115;
GE 1; Answer). He used marijuana twice in late 2009, while in school after leaving the
Navy;  several  times  between  January  and  May  2014,  and  once  at  a  wedding  in
November 2014. He also purchased marijuana on one occasion, in mid-2014. (GE 10-
11, 16)  (SOR  ¶  1.a) His  marijuana  use  occurred  after he had  been  granted  a  security
clearance. (SOR ¶ 1.b)
In connection with his employment, Applicant submitted an SCA for a high-level
clearance  with  another  government  agency  (AGA)  in  August  2014.  (GE  5)  He  did  not
disclose  his  marijuana  use  or  the  one-time  marijuana  purchase,  all  of  which  occurred
within the previous seven years, the timeframe of the questions at issue. (GE 5 at Q. 23;
Tr. 100-106) (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.c)
At  the  same  time,  Applicant  signed  an  acknowledgement  concerning  his
understanding of AGA policy that drug use was illegal. (GE 6) He last used marijuana in
November 2014, at a wedding. (GE 3 at 10-11) (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant submitted another SCA, in October 2014 for a job with another defense
contractor. (GE 2). He again failed to disclose his usage and purchase of marijuana, in
answering questions that called for disclosure of that information. (GE 2 at 33; Tr. 100-
106). (SOR ¶¶ 2.e. 2.f)
SOR ¶ 1.b, which Applicant admitted, alleges that Applicant used marijuana after
he had been granted a security clearance. He had a clearance in the Navy, and all of
his marijuana use came afterwards. SOR ¶¶ 2.c and 2.g, which Applicant also admitted,
concern  his  alleged  failure  to  disclose,  on  both  of  his  SCAs  in  2014,  that  he  used
marijuana while possessing a security clearance. (GE 2 at 33; GE 5 at Q. 23b)
Department  Counsel represented  on  the  record  that the  DOD’s  Joint  Personnel
Adjudication System (JPAS) indicated that Applicant’s clearance was “denied” on June
29,  2015.  (Tr.  74,  146)  (See  discussion  below).  However,  there  is  no  official
documentation in the record, either from JPAS or otherwise, about whether Applicant in
fact held a clearance, or was working in a cleared position, when he used marijuana at
any time.
On December 2, 2014, Applicant had a background interview for the clearance
with  the  AGA.  He  initially  denied  any  involvement  with  illegal  drugs.  After  further
questioning,  he  admitted  using  marijuana  at  social  gatherings  twice  in  2009  (after
leaving the Navy) three or four times between January 2014 and May 2014, and once in
November 2014. He also disclosed his one-time purchase of marijuana, in March 2014.
(GE 4 at 2; GE 7 at 6; Tr. 100, 121-122)
Four days later, on December 6, 2014, Applicant had another interview with an
AGA  representative.  In  that  interview,  he  disclosed  only  two  uses  of  marijuana:  once
each in 2009 and 2014. He denied any further involvement with illegal drugs. (GE 4 at
2; GE 8 at 2; Tr. 121-122) His failure to disclose the full extent of his illegal drug use in
the December 6 interview is alleged as SOR ¶ 2.h.
As a result of Applicant’s illegal use of marijuana and related false statements on
his  August  2014  SCA  and  during  subsequent  background  interviews,  the  AGA  denied
Applicant  eligibility  for  access  in  a  June  2015  clearance  decision  statement  (CDS).
Under  the  drug  involvement  guideline,  the  AGA  applied  the  drug  involvement
disqualifying  condition  for  “any  drug  abuse.”  The  AGA’s  decision  did  not  address
whether  Applicant’s  drug  use,  either  in  2009  or  2014,  had  occurred  while  he  held  a
clearance. (GE 4) Applicant appealed the denial and had a hearing. (Tr. 73-74; GE 9)
The AGA upheld the denial on appeal in September 2015. (GE 10)
Applicant submitted his most recent SCA in July 2016. He disclosed that he used
marijuana about  seven  times  on  social  occasions  between  2009  and  November 2014.
He  also  disclosed  his  one-time  purchase  of  marijuana,  in  2014.  He  disclosed  that  his
clearance had been revoked in June 2015 for failing to disclose his  drug use. He also
disavowed any future drug use because he said he did not want to put his clearance in
jeopardy or put his livelihood at risk. He acknowledged that his prior drug use had been
a  mistake  (GE  1)  He  discussed  his  drug  use  in  background  interviews  in  September
2016 and January 2017. (GE 3 at 10-11, 16) He testified that his intentions in disclosing
his drug use was to be “one hundred percent honest” going forward, and to “come clean
about everything.” (Tr. 112, 136)
Concerning  the  single  drug  purchase,  Applicant  purchased  a  $10  bag  of
marijuana  on  one  occasion  in  either  March  2014  (GE  1  at  37;  GE  3  at  17)  or  a  few
months later. (Tr. 97; GE 3 at 11) He kept the bag of marijuana in his garage. He initially
testified  that  he  had  the  bag  “maybe  a  month.”  (Tr.  98).  He  also  testified  “once  my
clearance got revoked, and I found out what I got revoked for, I got rid of it.” (Tr. 96-98)
Once it was pointed out to Applicant at hearing  that his clearance was revoked in late
June  2015,  he  admitted  keeping  the  marijuana  in  his  garage  for  about  15  months,
instead of only one. (Tr. 122-129)
Applicant  said  in  his  September  2016  background  interview  that  he  did  not
disclose  his  marijuana  use  on  his  earlier  applications  out  of  fear  that  doing  so  would
impact  his  eligibility  for  a  clearance.  He  decided  later  to  admit  to  his  use  since  lying
about it was too much of a burden and that he wanted to do the right thing. (GE 3 at 10)
In 2013, while working in Afghanistan, Applicant sent an unsolicited personal e-
mail  to  a  female  Marine  he  worked  with.  The  e-mail  was  not  well  received,  and  she
complained  to  his  supervisor.  (Tr.  49-51,  89-93;  GE  7  at  3)  In  SOR  ¶  2.d,  the
Government  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  on  his  October  2014
SCA that he had been reprimanded or disciplined as a result of this incident. (GE 2 at
12-13; GE 3 at 9, 15; Tr. 117-120) Appellant denied SOR ¶ 2.d, on the grounds that he
had not been given a written reprimand or otherwise disciplined as a result of the e-mail.
He acknowledged being told by his supervisor not to contact the woman again, and he
complied.  (Tr.  113)  He  denied  being  given  a  reprimand,  written  or  otherwise.  There  is
no written reprimand in the record.
Applicant disclosed this incident on his most recent SCA, in 2016. (GE 1 at 16)
He  said  he  did  so  to  clear  his  conscience,  and  out  of  the  abundance  of  caution.  (Tr.
120)
In 2007, Applicant was a petty officer first class (E-6) and a leading petty officer
(LPO) in charge of about 17 other sailors on his ship.  In applying for chief petty officer
(E-7),  Applicant  submitted  documentation  falsely  representing  that  he  had  obtained
certain  qualifications  necessary  for  promotion.  On  the  documentation,  he  forged  or
falsified his senior chief petty officer’s signature. He submitted the documentation to the
very senior chief whose signature he had forged, and she noticed the discrepancy right
away.  Applicant  was  charged  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ)  with
making a false statement. He received non-judicial punishment (NJP) and was reduced
in rank to E-5. He was allowed to remain in the Navy so he could retire after 20 years.
(Tr. 78-88, 141-144; GE 8 at 3) This incident is not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant disclosed his NJP on his July 2016 SCA. He did so despite the fact that
it occurred in 2007, and, thus, need not have been disclosed, since it was beyond the
seven-year time frame of the employment questions on the form. (GE 1 at 20-21)
In  late  August  2018,  following  a  recommendation  from  his  doctor,  Applicant
began  attending  counseling  with  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker  (LSCW).  (AE  A)  He
attends counseling and has his medication evaluated every three months. (Tr. 132-135)
Applicant  testified  that  he  accepts  full  responsibility  for  his  actions  and  is  very
remorseful. His counselor noted this as well. (AE A) He sought counseling so as to put
things behind him and “get my life back together.” (Tr. 71-72, 158; Answer) He accepted
full responsibility for his actions and said he has learned his lesson. (Tr. 158; AE A)
In 2015, when he appealed the denial of his clearance application with the AGA,
Applicant  submitted  a statement of  intent  not  to use  illegal drugs  in  the future,  and  he
consented  to  automatic  revocation  of  his  clearance  should  he  do  so.  (Att.  E  to  GE  9)
Applicant reaffirmed that statement during his testimony. (Tr. 135)
A former co-worker of Applicant’s testified as a character witness. They worked
together  from  October  2017  at  October  2018  and  had  daily  professional  contact.  She
attested  to  Applicant’s  honesty  and  integrity.  She  trusts  Applicant  implicitly,  which  she
rarely does with others. If she owned her own business, she would hire him. (Tr. 51-69)
Two  senior  executives  at  Applicant’s  employer  praised  his  work  ethic  and
professional expertise. They regard Applicant as motivated, responsible, and a devoted
employee.  They  stated  that  he  has  a  high  degree  of  integrity.  They  are  aware  of
Applicant’s  misconduct,  and  noted  that  he  is  remorseful  and  regretful.  They  believe
Applicant  made  a  mistake  and  has  faced  up  to  it.  They  recommend  Applicant  for  a
clearance.  (AE  B;  AE  C)  Applicant’s  security  manager  provided  a  similar  strong
endorsement, as did a longtime friend and fellow sailor. (AE D; AE E)1

"Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegation.  He  is  a  24-year-old  systems  engineer
employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  August  2016.  This  is  his  first  real  job  after
graduating college in May 2016. He has not previously held a clearance.
During a May 2018 interview with a Government investigator (Item 3), Applicant
disclosed that he had used marijuana in October 2016 (vaporizer), August 2017 (pipe),
November  2017  (bong),  and  January  2018  (pipe)  each  time  in  social  settings  with
friends. He admitted to succumbing to peer pressure on each occasion, but stated that
marijuana  use  actually  makes  him  sick.  Moreover,  He  does  not  normally  smoke
because his grandparents died from lung cancer and he was training for a marathon. He
was  aware  that  marijuana  use  is  illegal,  and  is  also  inconsistent  with  holding  a
clearance. He stated that continuing to use marijuana was not worth risking his job, and
he had no intent to use marijuana in the future.
Applicant  disclosed  his  then-current  marijuana  use  on  his  September  2017
clearance  application  (Item  2).  At  the  time,  he  was  unwilling  to  commit  to  not  using
marijuana in the future. He disclosed his additional marijuana uses during his May 2018
interview.
In  his  November  2018  Answer  (Item  1),  Applicant  admitted  his  marijuana  use,
and  stated  that  he  no  longer  experiences  any  social  pressure  to  use  marijuana.  He
signed a statement of intent as contemplated by the AG.
Applicant submitted no work or character references, and provided no evidence
of any community involvement.

"Applicant is 46 years old, not married and has no children.  She has two Master’s
degrees,  one  in  business  administration,  and  the  other  in  project  management.
(Applicant’s Exhibits C and D.)  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Project
Manager.    She  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  her
employment.
Guideline G – Alcohol Consumption
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has  engaged  in  excessive  alcohol
consumption that often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to
control  impulses,  and  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Guideline E – Personal Conduct
The Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in conduct  which shows a
lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  that
raise  questions  about  her  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  or
sensitive information.
Applicant  has  worked  for  her  current  employer  since  June  2009,  almost  ten
years.    She  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in  2007.    In  May  2010,  Applicant  was
arrested  and  charged  with  Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol  (DUI)  with  blood
alcohol  level  of  .08  or  higher.    She  explained  that  she  and  a  work  colleague  were
celebrating  a  milestone  and  went  out  to  a  restaurant  for  dinner  and  then  to  a  bar  for
drinks.    Applicant  consumed  three  glasses  of  wine  with  dinner  and  five  vodka  drinks
while  at  the  bar.    She  admits  that  after  consuming  this  amount  of  alcohol  she  was
intoxicated.    Applicant  was  pulled  over  while  driving  her  car  and  given  a  field  sobriety
test, which she failed.  Her blood alcohol level was .19%.  In about July 2010, she pled
guilty to misdemeanor DUI and was required to pay a fine, attend alcohol abuse training
and serve three years of probation.  She completed these court conditions.  She states
that she also learned not to drink and drive in the future.  She no longer goes out to bars
just to drink alcohol.  (Tr. pp. 49-51.)  Following this DUI, she abstained from drinking for
a while.  Applicant states that she now consumes alcohol about once or twice a month,
and when she drinks she has about two drinks each time, usually beer.  (Tr. p. 73.)
Although  not  alleged,  when  confronted  by  Department  Counsel  as  to  whether
she  has  a  previous  DUI  in  1996,  Applicant  admitted  that  she  had.    At  that  time,
Applicant’s blood alcohol level was a .13%.  As a result of that DUI, she was required to
attend  three  months  of  MADD  classes,  AA  meetings,  pay  a  fine  and  placed  on
probation.    Her  driver’s  license  was  suspended  and  restricted  to  allow  her  to  drive  to
work only.  (Tr. p. 69.)  Applicant complied with all of these conditions.  Applicant states
that following this DUI, she did abstain from drinking for a while.
Applicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes her use of marijuana from
about  January  1996  to  about  June  2004;  cocaine  use  from  about  June  1995  to  about
December  2002,  and  in  October  2015;  and  ecstasy  in  January  2016,  while  holding  a
security clearance.
Applicant  used  marijuana  from  January  1996  to  about  June  2004.    At  the
beginning, she used it about once a day.  It tapered off as her group of friends changed.
She  stopped  using  it  in  2004,  because  she  was  going  to  school  to  get  her  Master’s
degree.    She  last  used  marijuana  in  2004  while  she  was  in  Amsterdam.    She  did  not
hold a security clearance at the time.  She use it with a group of friends.  She no longer
uses marijuana because it stopped being desirable to her.  (Tr. p. 63.)
She  also  used  cocaine  from  June  1995  to  about  December  2002.    She  states
that she used it during this period about five times.  From 2002 to 2015, Applicant states
that  she  did  not  use  cocaine  because  she  lost  interest  in  it  and  no  longer  associated
with her friends that used it.  (Tr. p. 54.)  Applicant use cocaine again in October 2015.
She explained that she was at a party at a friend’s house.  Some people were going into
the  garage  randomly  and  she  wandered  in  to  see  what  was  going  on.    A  friend  of  a
friend,  who  Applicant  does  not  know,  had  some  cocaine  and  Applicant  used  some.
Applicant  states that  it  never occurred  to  her that  she  held a  security  clearance  at  the
time and should not be using illegal drugs.  She states that she has never worked in a
classified  area  and  never  used  her  clearance.    She  did  not  enjoy  the  experience  and
regretted using it.  She no longer puts herself in those environments.
In  January  2016,  while  holding  a  security  clearance,  Applicant  used  ecstasy  on
one  occasion.    She  was  in  Las  Vegas  with  a  friend  of  hers,  and  his  group  of  friends
were all using ecstasy.  They were getting ready to go out for the evening to a concert
and  Applicant  was  offered  some.    She  did  not  feel  pressured  to  use  it,  and  again  her
security clearance was not in the forefront of her mind at the time.  She states that she
has no intention of ever using ecstasy again.
Applicant  executed  two  sworn  statements  of  intent  promising  never  to  abuse
alcohol  or  any  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.    In  the  event  that  she  does,  her  security
clearance is subject to immediate revocation.  (Applicant’s Exhibits E and F.)
Applicant  states  that  she  now  realizes  the  seriousness  involved  in  holding  a
security clearance.  Although she possessed a security clearance at the time she used
cocaine  and  ecstasy  in  the  past,  she  did  not  use  her  clearance  to  access  classified
information, and so she did not take the matter seriously.  Applicant states that she now
understands  the  responsibilities  and  obligations  that  come  with  holding  a  security
clearance.  This situation has been an eye-opener for her and she believes that she is
“scared  straight.”    (Tr.  p.  68.)    Applicant  does  not  believe  that  her  employer  has  a
separate (company) drug policy that prevents the use of illegal drugs.
Two witnesses testified on Applicant’s behalf.  A principal systems engineer who
works  with  the  Navy  met  Applicant  while  taking  a  Master’s  course  class  before  2007.
He interacts with her once a month and talks with her once every two weeks.  He states
that  she  is  responsible  and  reliable  and  he  has  no  reservations  about  her  holding  a
security clearance.  They started hanging out socially in 2007 when he moved back to
the city.  She educated him on “good beer” in the city at the time.  (Tr.pp.  21 - 33.)
The  other  witness,  a  senior  project  engineer,  stated  that  she  has  known  the
Applicant for several years, they interact daily, and they are friends.  She described the
Applicant  as  a  motivated  employee  who  goes  above  and  beyond  her  job  to  complete
her  responsibilities.    She  is  considered  to  be  a  caring,  trustworthy,  honest,  and
dedicated  employee.    The  writer  does  not  believe  the  Applicant’s  past  actions  are  a
threat  to  the  national  security  of  the  United  States,  and  she  recommends  Applicant’s
retention of her security clearance.  (Tr. pp. 45 - 68)
Performance evaluations of the Applicant for the periods from 2013 through 2018
all  are  favorable  and  indicate  that  she  either  “meets”  her  job  requirements,  or  “highly”
meets her job requirements in every instance.  (Applicant’s Exhibit G.)
Letters  of  recommendation  from  previous  coworkers,  friends,  and  professional
colleagues of the Applicant attest to her integrity, honesty and trustworthiness.  She is
described as intelligent, loyal and responsible.   One letter also indicates that Applicant,
in  execution  of  her  duties,  has  been  exposed  to  sensitive  information.    (Applicant’s
Exhibits I and M.)
A  Substance  Abuse  evaluation  of  the  Applicant  prepared  by  a  certified  alcohol
and  drug  counselor dated  November 28,  2018,  indicates  that  Applicant does not meet
the criteria of substance abuse at that time, although her past consumption resulted in
serious  legal  consequences.    Her  current  consumption  of  alcohol  at  that  time  was  in
normal limits, however she is encouraged to self-monitor her consumption bi-annually.
The report also indicates that Applicant’s alcohol-abuse history involves being drunk to
intoxication  about  50  times  in  her  lifetime.  She has  blacked out from  drinking  at  least
four times in her life.  She reported vomiting from drinking two times in her life and her
pattern of consumption was bi-weekly and she would consume four drinks.  (Applicant’s
Exhibit L.)

November 30, 2018.  (Applicant’s Exhibit J.)

"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, except the allegation in ¶ 1.a,
which she partially denied due to the dates alleged. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 43 years old. She graduated from college in 1998. She married in 2005
and divorced  in  2007.  She  remarried  in 2010.  She  has two  children  ages four and  six
years old. She has worked for her present employer, a federal contractor, since October
2016. Before then, from 2000 to 2016, she worked in different departments at a university.
(Tr. 23-26; GE 1; AE B)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  December  2016.
She  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  January  2018,  and  completed
government interrogatories in August 2018. She disclosed and admitted all of her past
illegal drug use and activity as follows:
Marijuana  use  with  varying  frequency  from  January  1992  to  September
2013.
Nitrous Oxide use on various occasions from February 1992 to June 2016.
Sold Nitrous Oxide in 2007 on at least two occasions.
Mushrooms  use  with  varying  frequency  from  about  August  2001  to  May
2013.
Ecstasy use approximately six times from August 2002 to May 2009.
LSD use on various occasions from August 2003 to May 2011.
2C-B, a hallucinogenic, used two times from 2003 to 2004.
2C-I, a hallucinogenic used in July 2003.
Peyote, used in 2004.
Foxy, a hallucinogenic, used in July 2007.
DMT, a hallucinogenic, used in 2008.
Poppers, an inhalant, used in 2009.
Applicant  disputed  the  date  alleged  regarding  her  use  of  hallucinogenic
mushrooms. She admitted she knowingly used mushrooms from 2001 to 2013. In June
2017, she attended a memorial service for a friend. She had previously used mushrooms
with some of the people who were also in attendance, but she had not seen them for a
while.  There  was  a  spiritual  ceremony  that  included  the  leader  dabbing  oil  on  each
attendee’s forehead and saying a blessing. The oil had mushroom extract in it. Because
of  the  nature  of  the  ceremony,  she  did  not  decline  the  blessing.  She  disclosed  this
information in her background interview. She testified that at the time, she did not consider
the potential implications or effects the mushrooms might have on her. She stated after
receiving the oil dab she did not feel any dramatic effect from the oil, but became aware
of a very slight altered feeling similar to consuming half of a can of beer. She testified that
she felt a duty to report this incident during her background interview even though it was
not an intentional choice at the time to abuse drugs. (Tr. 38-40, 44-50; GE 2, 3)
Applicant started using marijuana in high school. She estimated that from 1997 to
2007,  she  used  it  about  six  times  a  year.  She  estimated  she  used  marijuana  with  her
friends and her spouse from 2008 to 2013, about eight times a year. She used it socially
and  to  relax.  She  estimated  she  used  LSD  about  eight  times  from  2003  to  2011.  She
estimated she used Ecstasy about six times from 2002 to 2009. She used Poppers, DMT,
Foxy, and 2C-B once. She used 2C-I twice. She said that except for her marijuana and
LSD use, her use of other illegal drugs was before her second marriage. (Tr. 54, 61-75)
Applicant testified that a defining time in her life was when she became a mother
and it profoundly changed her lifestyle and social community. She does not want anything
to prevent her from giving her children the best opportunities that she can. Because any
illegal drug use would prevent her from doing so, she said she stopped using illegal drugs
in 2013. Becoming a mother also led her to improve her professional life. Since she began
working for her current employer she has been promoted. (Tr. 27-29, 33, 77-79; GE 1)
Applicant admitted she used Nitrous Oxide until June 2016, a period of time after
she stopped using other drugs. Because it was legal to obtain, she was unaware it was
illegal to inhale. It is commonly used in dental and medical procedures and its effect wear
off safely and quickly. She purchased it twice in 2007 and sold some to friends at parties
as a convenience. She admitted in her SCA that in hindsight she realized it was probably
illegal to inhale it. She did not sell it to make a profit, but did make a small one. Her use
of Nitrous Oxide after having children was to help her relax. She has not used it since
2016. (Tr. 33-38, 50-54, 66-68, 77-79, 82-83; AE D)
Applicant testified that she does not believe her husband still uses marijuana, but
has not asked him. He has not used it in their home and they have not used it together
since  2013.  She  credibly  testified  that  since  becoming  a  mother  her  priorities  have
changed,  and  she  is  focused  on  raising  her  family.  She  admitted  that  before  having
children, she exhibited behavior where she sought to find different types of “highs.” (Tr.
60-61, 66-67, 79-80)
Applicant testified and provided a written statement that she does not intend to use
illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  Since  becoming  a  mother  she  has  taken  management  and
technical  courses  to  improve  herself.  She  is  focused  on  self-development  through
exercise and martial arts. She testified that she has disassociated herself from her friends
who use drugs. She avoids places where there may be illegal drugs. Her social activity is
focused on her two young children and husband. (Tr. 40-41, 71, 77-79; AE E)
Applicant testified that she has never tested positive for illegal drug use and has
not  been  evaluated  or  diagnosed  with  a  substance  abuse  disorder.  She  voluntarily
disclosed all of her drug use. (Tr. 74-75).
Applicant’s  supervisor testified  on her  behalf.  He has  observed  her  daily for  the
past two and a half years. She is a valued employee and exhibits exceptional talent in her
field. She shared with him her past drug use. He has not witnessed any indication that
she continues to use drugs. He trusts her and believes she has exercised good judgment.
(Tr. 86-91)
Applicant provided character letters from her manager, a former supervisor for four
years, and a friend. She is described as honest, knowledgeable, trustworthy, dependable,
thoughtful,  deliberate,  and  stable.  She  exhibits  a  commitment  to  hard  work;  exercises
sound judgment; and since becoming a parent is steadfast in ensuring she is a positive
role model for her children. (Tr. 31; AE C)

SOR ¶ 1.a is incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 26-year-old analyst employed by a federal contractor since August
2015.  He  attended  college  from  August  2010  to  May  2015,  received  a  bachelor’s
degree,  and  was  hired  by  his  current  employer  shortly  thereafter.  He  has  no  military
service.  He  has  never  married  and  has  no  children.  He  has  never  held  a  security
clearance.
When Applicant submitted his SCA, he answered “no” to a question asking if he
had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years. When he
was interviewed by a security investigator in August 2017, he told the investigator that
he wanted to change his answer to the question to “yes.” He told the investigator that he
used marijuana once or twice a week during college, that he contributed money to buy
marijuana, and that he purchased it himself at least once. He told the investigator that
he  stopped  using  marijuana  in  2015,  while  looking  for  employment,  and  abstained  for
four  to  six  months  after  being  hired  by  his  current  employer.  After  he  became
comfortable in his job, he resumed his use of marijuana, smoking it once a month until
July 2017, with a period of abstinence for four to six months in 2016. He admitted using
marijuana within 30 days of the interview.
When  asked  about  his  future  intentions,  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he
had  no  immediate  plans  to  stop  using  marijuana  and  that  he  intended  to  move  to  a
jurisdiction where marijuana was legal. After being advised that marijuana use violates
federal law even when it is legal under local law, he told the investigator that he would
stop  using  marijuana  if  he  had  to  choose  between  using  marijuana  and  holding  a
security  clearance.  Finally,  he  told  the  investigator  that  he  answered  “no”  to  the  drug-
related questions in the SCA because he was trying to hide his marijuana use. (FORM

new  network  of  work-related  colleagues  and  acquaintances,  including  an  employee
sports  group.  He  stated  that  his  social  circle  now  consists  of  other  professionals
including doctors and lawyers. He submitted a statement of intent to refrain from illegal
drug involvement and acknowledged that any future drug involvement would be grounds
for revoking a security clearance. He attached documentation of a urinalysis conducted

defense  contractor  since  August  2017.  He  received  an  interim  security  clearance  in
October 2017. (Items 1, 2)
In August 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-86). In it
he disclosed the following information related to past illegal drug use: he illegally used
with varying frequency marijuana between June 2012 and January 2018; he purchased
marijuana from September 2013 to April 2016; he used cocaine once in 2014; and he
misused  two  prescriptions,  Adderall  and  Vyvanse,  from  November  2013  to  December
2014, while in college. During a background interview in March 2018, Applicant admitted
that he illegally used marijuana in early January 2018, after having received an interim
security clearance in October 2017. He said he used marijuana for social reasons and
took the prescription drugs to help him study while in college. He used marijuana with
friends. (Item 3)
During the March 2018 interview, Applicant stated he does not intend to use illegal
drugs or marijuana in the future. (Item 3) There is no information indicating that Applicant

"Applicant  is  a  26-year-old  single  man.  He  works  for  a  defense  contractor  as  a
shipping  and  receiving  clerk.  (Tr.  14)  After  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school,  he
enrolled in college. His parents agreed to help him finance the first three years of college,
and he was to be solely responsible for the remainder. He attended college, but did not
graduate. Working a minimum wage job, he was unable to keep up with his student loans.
By March 2018, Applicant was delinquent on five student-loan accounts totaling
approximately  $40,000,  as  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraphs  1.a  through  1.e.  (GE  3)
Additionally, he had incurred two delinquent credit card debts totaling approximately $3,500
(SOR subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g),  and a delinquent $50 medical bill (SOR subparagraph
1.g).
Applicant began his current job in November 2017. He continued working at his part-
time  job.  Working  both  jobs  enabled  him  to  begin  resolving  his  delinquent  debts.  He
consolidated all of the student-loan debts in May 2018. One month later, he began making
monthly $138 payments. (AE A) He has been consistently making payments since then,
and the student loan debts, as consolidated, are no longer in delinquent status.
As for the credit card debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f, Applicant has made 11

Applicant smoked marijuana with varying degrees of frequency from 2011 to 2017.
His use from 2011 to 2015 occurred while he was in college. He stopped using marijuana
for approximately nine months in November 2016 before using it once more on his birthday
in September 2017. He has not used marijuana since then.
Applicant now devotes his time to working and satisfying his debt. Typically, after
one job ends at 4:00 pm, he goes “straight to the next job at 5:30 [pm].” (Tr. 42) Consumed
with working multiple jobs, he has no time to socialize with friends with whom he used
marijuana in the past. He has no intention of using marijuana in the future because “it’s not
. . . conducive to the career that [he is] trying to have.” (Tr. 17)

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old. He is married and has no children. He has worked for
his  current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  May  2010.  He  first  worked  for  a
federal  contractor  in  2008,  which  is  when  he  obtained  a  security  clearance.  He  has  a
master’s degree. (Tr. at18, 20, 26-27; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from March
2005 to July 2017; that he used marijuana while holding a security clearance; and that
in April 2018, when he completed his security clearance application (SCA), he stated he
intended to use marijuana in the future.
Applicant  admitted  using  marijuana a few  times  in  2005.  He  discontinued  using
marijuana because he did not find it interesting and he was concerned such use would
hamper  his  ability  to  obtain  a  job.  He  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in  2008  after
filling  out an  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  which  asked him  about  recent  drug
use.  He  resumed  using  marijuana  in  approximately  December  2017,  in  an  attempt  to
relieve his headaches and as a way to relax. He held a security clearance at the time
and  knew  use  of  marijuana  was  against  federal  law  and  the  law  of  his  state  of
residence.  He  continued  to  use marijuana approximately  20 times  through  June  2018.
He filled out another SCA in April 2018, admitting his use of marijuana and stating that
he intended to continue to use marijuana in the future.  He continued to use marijuana
until June 2018. He was interviewed by a defense investigator in July 2018. He told the
investigator  that  he  did  not  intend  to  continue  using  marijuana  because  he  no  longer
found  it  interesting  and  it  was  “hit  or miss”  with  providing  headache  relief.  Upon  cross
examination  at  hearing,  he  admitted  that  one  reason  he  changed  his  view  of  future
marijuana  use  was  because  he  discovered  the  impact  such  use  had  on  his  security
clearance and possibly his job. (Tr. at 29-30, 32, 34-36; GE 1-4)
When  Applicant  was  using  marijuana  he  used  it  with  his  wife,  his  sister,  and
some friends. He used by smoking the marijuana. He claims that both his sister and his
wife  have  stopped  using  marijuana  (wife  provided  a  negative  drug  test  from  March
2019),  and  that  his  friends  either  no  longer  use  marijuana  or  they  do  not  use  in  his
presence. He sought treatment for substance-induced anxiety disorder in July 2018 and
successfully  completed  counseling  later  that  month.  Other  than  a  letter  describing  his
successful completion  of  counseling,  no  specific treatment  plan, or prognosis,  was  set
out. In May 2019, he signed a written statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the
future. He also provided two drugs tests from March 2019 and May 2019 showing that
he  tested  negative  for  marijuana  on  both  occasions.  Applicant  indicated  that  he  now
uses meditation as a substitute for marijuana to deal with his anxiety. (Tr. at 38, 41-43;
Tab C, E; AE F)
Applicant  presented  seven  declarations  from  friends  and  a  former  coworker.
They  described  Applicant  as  truthful,  trustworthy,  responsible,  and  possessing  good
judgment.  They  all  believe  he  will  not  use  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  His  2018  job
performance appraisal gave him an overall evaluation of “substantial impact,” which was
the highest rating for his employee category. (Tabs C-D)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  limited  comments  all  of  the
factual  allegations  pertaining  to  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse  of  the  SOR
(SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.h.).  Applicant’s  admissions  and  comments  are  incorporated
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in  the
record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of
fact:
Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a high energy laser program analyst with his current employer since May 2016. A 2008
high school graduate, Applicant attended several colleges and received college credits
over a multi-year period, but did not earn a degree. He has never served with the U.S.
military.  He  has  never  been  granted  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  has  never  been
married, but he apparently has a one-year-old daughter.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant was a substance abuser whose substances of choice were marijuana;
unspecified  opioids;1  hallucinogens,2  including  lysergic  acid  diethylamide  (LSD)  and
1 Opioids are a class of drugs that include the illegal drug heroin, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl,
and  pain  relievers  available  legally  by  prescription,  such  as  oxycodone  (OxyContin®),  hydrocodone
(Vicodin®), codeine, morphine, and many others. See https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids
2  Hallucinogens  are  a  diverse  group  of  drugs  that  alter  perception  (awareness  of  surrounding
objects and conditions), thoughts, and feelings. They cause hallucinations, or sensations and images that
seem real though they are not. See https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/hallucinogens
psilocybin  mushrooms;  stimulants,  including  cocaine,  Adderall®,3  3,4-Methyl-enedioxy-
methamphetamine  (MDMA),4  a  synthetic  drug  commonly  known  as  Ecstasy;  Xanax,  a
brand name for the drug alprazolam, used to treat anxiety and panic disorders; Klonopin,
a sedative used to treat seizures, panic disorder, and anxiety; and codeine cough syrup.5
Some of those substances are illegal, while others require prescriptions.
Applicant  has  been  smoking  or  eating  marijuana  on  numerous  occasions  since
July 2006, throughout high school and college, and he continued to do so at least until
February  2016.  He  purchased  marijuana  from  his  unnamed  associates  and  unnamed
friends. He used marijuana with multiple individuals, in a variety of locations, including his
friends’ apartments, and his car. His use increased over time from one time per month to
up to two  marijuana  joints  per day.  Marijuana made him feel hungry  and  unmotivated,
and it helped him forget about issues in his life. Applicant described his attachment to
marijuana as an emotional attachment. During his interview with an investigator from the
U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on May 10, 2018, Applicant stated that he
did not intend to use marijuana in the future, claiming that his motivation was driven by
his family, his daughter, and his maturity level.6
Applicant began snorting cocaine out of curiosity in March 2008 when he was in
high  school,  and  he  continued  doing  so  periodically,  characterized  by  him  as  “only  a
handful of times,” sometimes after lengthy periods of abstinence, until at least July 2014.
He was generally by himself when he used cocaine. He purchased the cocaine that he
used. Cocaine made his heart race, and it made him sweaty and paranoid. Because he
saw no benefit in the continued use of cocaine, he decided to stop using it. During his
OPM interview, Applicant made the same statement regarding future intent, motivation,
and maturity level.7
Applicant  started using  LSD and  psilocybin mushrooms,  also  out of  curiosity,  in
September  2008,  and  he  continued  using  the  substances  until  at  least  January  2012,
claiming that there were sometimes periods of up to six months when he did not use them.
He obtained the LSD from friends, or he would harvest the mushrooms from cow feces in

the pasture. During his period of use, he estimated that he used LSD on two occasions
and  the mushrooms  about  “a handful of  times” or ten  times.  LSD and  the mushrooms
made him feel artistic and  creative,  seeing  lots  of  colors,  they  slurred  his speech,  and
they made him feel as if he was dreaming while he was actually awake. During his OPM
interview,  Applicant  made  the  same  statement  regarding  future  intent,  motivation,  and
maturity level.8
Applicant started using Adderall® in September 2008, and he continued using it
“a  few  times”  until  March  2015.  It  helped  him  focus  for  tests.  The  Adderall®  was  not
prescribed for him, and a study partner provided it to him. The substance made him feel
uncomfortable,  sweaty,  and  anxious.  He  was  given  MDMA/Ecstacy  by  an  unidentified
acquaintance, and Applicant used it two times at parties during a one to two week period
while he was at a particular university between August and December 2008. During his
OPM interview, Applicant made the same statement regarding future intent, motivation,
and maturity level.9
Applicant started using Xanax recreationally in October 2009, and he continued
doing  so  until  at  least  January  2016,  claiming  that  there  were  sometimes  multi-year
periods when he did not use it. Although  he claimed it was at one point  prescribed for
him,  he  would  usually  purchase  it  off  the  street  and  would  use  one  pill  per  day.  He
estimated that he used it “only a handful of times.” Xanax made him feel less anxious,
and it enabled him to forget about his problems.  Applicant acknowledged that the drug
created  relationship  problems  with  his  girlfriend.  During  his  OPM  interview,  Applicant
made the same statement regarding future intent, motivation, and maturity level.10
Applicant initially admitted that he had experimented with both Xanax and Klonopin
on  various  occasions,  described  as  “a  handful  of  times,”  between  October  2009  and
March  2015.  He  later  amended  that  period  and  said  it  continued  until  January  2016.
Klonopin,  like  Xanax,  is  a  type  of  anti-anxiety  medication  that  is  classified  as  a
benzodiazepine, used to treat panic attacks and anxiety. Applicant stated during the OPM
interview  that  he  was  currently  prescribed  Klonopin,  and  that  he  was  taking  it  as
prescribed.11
Applicant sustained a football injury in November 2004, and as a result, he had
surgery,  and  his spleen  was  removed.  He  was  prescribed hydrocodone12  and  codeine
cough syrup. Eventually, that period of prescribed use of such substances transitioned
into  recreational use. He  purchased and  used  various  opioids,  including  Oxycodone,13

recreationally from November 2007, and continued doing so until at least January 2016.
He used two 30 milligram Oxycodone pills on a daily basis by snorting the drug either in
his room or in his car. The daily use continued because efforts to stop taking the drug
resulted in his becoming violently sick from withdrawal. Opioids resulted in affecting his
speech and causing his pupils to become dilated. Applicant’s opioid use initially gave him
a feeling of euphoria, but eventually it simply helped him to feel normal.14
In July 2015, Applicant woke up in the hospital from an overdose of opioids.  During
his treatment, he was diagnosed with Opioid Use – Severe.15 He left treatment after nine
days without any prescribed medications and against medical advice because he felt as
though  he  was  not  being  treated  properly.16  Applicant  claimed  he  sought  alternate
resource support with Narcotics Anonymous (NA) for an unspecified period, as well as
Suboxone treatment from a physician.17
In December 2018, one month after the SOR was issued, Applicant started seeing
a licensed clinical psychologist as part of an addiction program. In addition to the program,
Applicant sees the psychologist in his private practice. Applicant has been participating
in  both  group  and  individual  therapy.  Through  the  first  three  months  of  the  program,
Applicant has met all requirements with self-direction and without prompting from clinic
staff.  He  has  successfully  passed  all  drug  screens,  but  does  continue  to  have  some
chronic anxiety. Applicant has consistently been forthright and honest in treatment and in
reporting previous drug use, “which demonstrates a good treatment prognosis. He has
been counseled about alcohol use and has decreased frequency and amount. Also per
his report, [Applicant] has completely discontinued marijuana use as well.”18
In his e-QIP, Applicant acknowledged his lengthy period of drug involvement and
substance misuse:19

"The  SOR  alleges  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse  security  concerns
based upon Applicant’s purchase and use of marijuana between  May 2003 and March
2018 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.) and his expressed intent to continue to use marijuana (SOR
¶  1.c.).  In his response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  1.b., and he
denied SOR ¶ 1.c. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I
make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  28  years  old.  In  December  2014,  he  earned  a  bachelor’s  and  a
master’s  degree  in  computer  science.  Since  April  2015,  he  has  been  employed  as  a
software engineer with a DOD contractor. He is not married, and he does not have any
children. (GE 1; Tr. 24)
On his April 2018 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant reported that he
used marijuana “[e]very couple of months on average socially” between May 2003 and
March 2018. He also admitted that he had purchased marijuana on multiple occasions
between May 2005 and September 2017. Section 23 further queried, “Do you intend to
use  this  drug  or  controlled  substance  in  the  future?,”  he  answered  “Yes.”  He  also
responded, “I will almost certainly purchase some [marijuana] at some future point in my
life.” (GE 1; Tr. 28)
During his July 2018 security interview, Applicant confirmed his illegal drug history
as delineated in his SCA. From May 2003 to September 2009, he used marijuana about
two  to  three  times  a  year.  From  about  September  2009  to  September  2010,  he  used
marijuana approximately four times a year. From September 2010 to May 2011, he did
not use marijuana. From about 2012 to December 2014, he used marijuana about every
weekend. From December 2014 to March 2018, he used marijuana about two to three
times a year. He typically used marijuana with his former roommate or his brother. He
sometimes  purchased  marijuana  from  friends  or  family  members,  and  at  times  others
shared marijuana with him. (GE 1; Tr. 24)
During his security interview, Applicant acknowledged that his marijuana use likely
violated  his  employer’s  policies.  He  further  stated  that  he  would  likely  continue  to  use
marijuana even if inconsistent with his possession of a DOD security clearance.  At the
time of his security interview, Applicant continued to possess marijuana he had purchased
in September 2017, and he expressed his intent to use and purchase marijuana in the
future. As of July 2018, he continued to associate with his former roommate, his brother,
and others with whom he had previously used marijuana. (GE 2)
Between  his  July  2018  security  interview  and  his  December  2018  Answer,
Applicant  experienced  a  change  in  perspective  about  his  future  marijuana  use  and
purchase. He testified that his mindset began to evolve after his security interview. In his
Answer,  he  explained  that  his  previously  viewpoint  mirrored  his  understanding  of
nationwide  trends  towards  the  legalization  of  recreation  marijuana,  but  he  now
understood  the  gravity  of  substance  misuse  in  the  context  of  his  security  clearance
eligibility. (Answer; AE A; Tr. 12, 51-52)
At hearing, Applicant confirmed his marijuana use from May 2003 to March 2018
and his marijuana purchase from May 2005 to September 2017. He testified that he no
longer associates with most of the individuals with whom he previously used marijuana.
Applicant continues to associate with his brother and his former roommate, both of whom
used marijuana with Applicant in the past. In May 2019, he attended a social gathering at
his brother’s house where individuals used marijuana outside the house while Applicant
remained  inside.  Applicant  had  previously  used  marijuana  at  social  gatherings  at  his
brother’s house on multiple occasions in the past. (Tr. 25-26, 42)
In  addition  to  reducing  his  contacts  with  individuals  with  whom  he  had  used
marijuana, Applicant has experienced several other changes in his life in recent years.
He moved in mid-2018, so he no longer lives with the roommate with whom he had used
marijuana. His job responsibilities have dramatically expanded in the last year, and he
has been more focused on his career. During the past year, he has been studying for a
technical certification to increase his career opportunities, and he has undertaken new
hobbies  and  activities.  In  a  post-hearing  statement,  Applicant  explained  that  he  had
“evolved substantially as a person” in recent years. (Tr. 21-25, 41-43; AE D)
Applicant  explained  that  when  he  completed  his  SCA,  he  wanted  to  honestly
answer the questions about his drug involvement; however, the questions did not cause
him to reconsider his future use and purchase of marijuana. Applicant testified that when
he completed his SCA and during his security interview, he sought to answer honestly
about the possibility he may use marijuana during the rest of his life, though he did not
have any immediate plans to do so. He further admitted he was aware that his marijuana
was  illegal  and  in  violation  of  his  employer’s  policies  at  the  time  of  his  use.  Applicant
clarified the frequency of his marijuana use between 2012 and December 2014, testifying
that  he  used  marijuana  approximately  15  times  during  this  span  instead  of  every
weekend, as  reported in  the  security  interview.  He  also explained  that  there had  been
periods between May 2003 and March 2018 when he did not use marijuana for a year or
two. He admitted that he did not realize until the DOHA hearing that even being around
other individuals using marijuana was a security concern. I found Applicant’s testimony
credible and sincere. (Tr. 28-31, 45-46, 53-55)
Applicant  has  received  several  awards  and  high  praise  during  his  annual
performance reviews for 2017 and 2018. His work performance, work ethic, and subject-
matter  expertise  are  well  regarded  by  his  supervisors.  His  salary  has  dramatically
increased since he began his employment with the DOD contractor, and he was recently
promoted. There is no evidence that any of Applicant’s character references are aware
of Applicant’s illegal drug use and purchases. Applicant testified that he has not informed
his supervisors or his facility security officer because, in part, he was concerned about
the potential negative impact to his employment. (AE A-F; Tr. 33-37)

"Applicant  is  37  years  old,  and  divorced  with  two  children.    He  attended  a
vocational  college  and  received  a  machinist  certification.    Applicant  is  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  as  a  tool  maker.    He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in
connection with his employment.
Guideline J – Criminal Conduct
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has  engaged  in  criminal  activity  that
creates doubt about a  person’s judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  and  calls  into
question a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Guideline E – Personal Conduct
The Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in conduct which shows a
lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  that
raise  questions  about  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  or
sensitive information.
At the young age of 13, Applicant started using illegal drugs recreationally like his
friends.    It  began  with  marijuana  and  alcohol.    As  time  passed,  his  drug  use  got
progressively  worse,  and  escalated  to  crack  cocaine  and  speed.    He  later  turned  to
methamphetamine and heroin.
Applicant grew up in downtown Los Angeles with the gangs and drugs and was a
by-product of the environment.  He states that he is also a by-product of rape.  He had
no father ever involved in his life.  His mother was simply trying to survive.  Each of his
siblings  have  different  fathers.    Between  December  1997  and  June  1999,  Applicant
committed various criminal offenses.  In December 1997, he was arrested and charged
with  robbery.    In  March  1998,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  grand  theft  auto.    In
May 1998, he was arrested again for grand theft auto.  In June 1999, he was arrested
and charged with vehicle theft.  At the age of 15 was the first time he went to Juvenile
Hall.    Applicant  spent  at  least  three  years  total  in  Juvenile  Hall  for  the  previously
mentioned offenses.
After getting out of juvenile hall, Applicant was homeless.  He ran away from the
youth authority program because he was raped by another inmate.  He admits to having
a  hard  time  adjusting  to  the  outside  world.    To  maintain  his  drug  habit,  Applicant
continued  to  commit  crimes.    In  February  2003  he  was  charged  with  burglary  and
disorderly conduct.  He was convicted and spent eight months in prison.  In December
2003 he was charged with burglary and vehicle theft.  He was convicted and spent 16
months  in  prison.    He  was  incarcerated  from  September  2004  to  October  2005.    In
October  2005,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  while  license  suspended.    He  was
convicted  and  sentenced  to  2  years  of  probation.      In  January  2006,  Applicant  was
charged  with  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  crack  cocaine.    He  was  convicted
and  sentenced  to  3  years  of  probation.    In  June  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with
possession of a controlled substance.  He was convicted and sentenced to three years
of  probation.    In  August  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with  vandalism.    Applicant  was
convicted and sentenced to two years of probation.
In  August  2007  Applicant  was  charged  with  burglary  in  the  first  degree  and
attempted burglary of a house. He was convicted and sentenced to nine years and four
months  in prison.   Applicant  was  incarcerated from  August  2007 to  October 2016  and
remains on parole until October 2019.
Applicant did nine years and four months in prison.  The skills he has that he put
on his current job application, he acquired on his own while he was in prison.  He was
never  able  to  put  those  skills  to  use  until  now.    To  survive  the  nine  years  and  four
months in prison, Applicant, who had great artistic talent, became a very famous tattoo
artist.  His artwork was well respected and he could get anything he wanted at any time
while in prison.   Thus, illegal drugs were always available to him.  When he got out of
prison, he worked at Home Boy Industries and went to school for thermals and designs
and  was  sponsored  by  them.    Applicant  excelled.    He  then  started  applying  for  other
jobs and was hired and worked for another aerospace company for about four months
before he was contacted by his current employer and eventually hired.
While in prison, Applicant applied for a job with his current employer.  About eight
months  or  so  after  he  applied,  he  was  contacted.    By  this  time,  Applicant  had  been
released from prison.  Applicant was interviewed in April 2017 and at that time he told
them everything about his past criminal record, drug history, and time in prison.  When
Applicant applied for the job, he was not aware that he needed a security clearance.  He
initially  applied  for  a  tool  and  die  maker.    During  his  interview  with  the  defense
contractor, who obviously saw potential in the Applicant, he was told that at some point
he may need a security clearance.  The defense contractor also told the Applicant that
they  would  help  him  fill  out  the  security  clearance  application  if  he  needed  help.
Applicant  was  surprised  to  learn  that  he  got  the  job  and  would  be  starting  his
employment  in  August  2017.    His  employer  conducted  an  investigation  into  his
background,  and  so  when  he  began his employment  in August 2017 he  was  given  an
interim clearance.
After getting out of prison, in October 2016, Applicant continued to use marijuana
and  alcohol.    He  started  using  it  a  couple  times  a  week,  and  as  time  passed,  his  use
increased.    He  stated  that  he  last  used  marijuana  about  a  month  before  the  hearing.
(Tr. p. 44.)  Applicant also started using methamphetamine and heroin again.  In August
2018 Applicant desperately wanted help from his employer for his addiction.  Applicant
went  to  the  person  who  hired  him  and  showed  him  the  tracks  on  his  arm.    Applicant
admits that he has overdosed twice, once in prison, and once when he got out.  He also
admits  that  he  has  been  diagnosed  with  Meth-related  Psychosis  and  Post  Traumatic
Stress  Disorder.   With  the help of  his employer,  Applicant  entered  a full  time-recovery
program.  This was the first time in his life that Applicant felt that he has ever received
real help for his addiction.  This inpatient treatment program began on August 27, 2018,
and  Applicant  successfully  completed  all  levels  of  the  treatment  on  January  25,  2019.
(Applicant’s Exhibit A.)  Applicant provided psychiatric progress notes dated January 2,
2019,  and  January  23,  2019,  indicating  that  Applicant  was  prescribed  several
medications  as  well  as  daily  group  and  individual  psychotherapy  and  support  or
ancillary  service  in  order  for  the  psychiatric  care  to  have  maximum  benefit  for  his
recovery.  (Applicant’s Exhibits B and C.)  Applicant testified that he found the program
to be extremely helpful and life changing.  Robert Downey Jr. walked up to him at the
recovery center and told him that they share the same story.  Applicant was accepted
for who he was, was weaning himself from his addiction, and working hard to improve
his life.  (Tr. p. 51.)
From 1998 to December 2017, Applicant used a number of illegal drugs to either
escape his reality or because he was addicted and could not control the urge.  He also
purchased  illegal  drugs  during  this  period.    After  he  started  working  for  his  current
employer, and after being granted an interim security clearance in July 2017, Applicant
continued  to  use  illegal  drugs.    After  successfully  completing  the  treatment  program,
Applicant relapsed and used marijuana and alcohol.  After receiving the SOR from the
government  concerning  his  security  clearance,  Applicant  made  the  decision  to  stop
using alcohol and illegal drugs altogether.  Applicant currently attends NA/AA meetings
on a weekly basis and he has an AA sponsor.  He is currently working the twelve steps
of AA and is on Step 2.  Applicant admits that over the years he has tried to stop using
alcohol and drugs on his own, but was never able to conquer it by himself.  He now has
help and is doing much better than ever before.  Applicant states that his supervisor and
co-workers know all about his past criminal and illegal drug history.
On March 29, 2017, Applicant completed a security clearance application (EQIP).
Section 22- Police Record, asked the Applicant if any of the following have happened?
In  the  past  seven  years  has  the  Applicant  been  or  is  he  currently  on  probation  or
parole?  Applicant answered, “NO”.  This was a false answer.  He failed to disclose that
he was on parole, which started in October 2016 and ended in October 2019.
On the same application, under Section 22 – “Police Record, the Applicant was
asked a series of questions, Other than those offenses already listed, has the Applicant
ever had the following happen to  him?. . . Has he ever been convicted in any court of
the United States of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year for
that crime, and incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than 1 year? . . .
Has he ever been charged with any felony offense?. . . Has he ever been charged with
an offense involving alcohol or drugs?”  Applicant answered, “NO,” to these questions.
These were false answers.  Applicant failed to disclose the conviction set forth above.
On the same application, under Section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity,
the question asked, In the last seven years, has  the Applicant illegally used any drugs
or  controlled  substances?    Applicant  answered,  “NO.”    This  was  a  false  answer.
Applicant failed to list his history of illegal drug use including marijuana, crack cocaine,
methamphetamine and heroin.
On the same application, under Section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity,
the question asked, In the last seven years has the Applicant been involved in the illegal
purchase, manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving,
handling or sale of any drug or controlled substance?  The Applicant answered, “NO.”
This  was  a  false  answer.    He  failed  to  list  the  illegal  drugs  he  purchased  for  his  use
discussed above.
Applicant does not understand why he answered, “NO” to these questions and is
not  certain  if  he  actually  did.    In  any  case,  he  testified  that  he  was  afraid  that  if  he
disclosed  the  information  on  the  application,  he  would  not  get  his  security  clearance.
He also swore under oath that the information he provided  was true and honest to the
best of his ability.  (Tr. p. 66.)
",False
"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 56-year-old senior designer, who has been employed by a defense
contractor since August 1990. He was granted a confidential-level security clearance in
July 1991, and he has held a secret-level clearance since September 1996. His clearance
was renewed most recently in August 2008. (GE 2; Tr. 44-45.)
Applicant has had several ex-wives and girlfriends. He and his fourth wife remarried
in August 2019. (Tr. 79.) Applicant has an adult daughter from his first marriage and two
adopted adult children from his second marriage. (GEs 2-3, 15-16, 19.)
Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in June 1981 (SOR ¶
2.a). He had consumed 12 beers while driving around. He was fined $50 and ordered to
attend a DWI school. In August 1982, he was charged with public intoxication after sharing
24 beers with a friend (SOR ¶ 2.b). He forfeited a $35 bond for being drunk in public. (GEs
6, 20- 21.)
In April 1988, Applicant and his first wife divorced after three years of marriage,
partially because of his drinking. On May 15, 1988, his ex-wife complained to the police
that he had assaulted her (pushed her, struck her across the face, knocked her to the
ground, and threatened to kill her). The police noticed scratches on her neck and other
signs that she had been assaulted. Two days later, Applicant was arrested and booked into
the county jail on a peace bond complaint of intent to murder his ex-wife (SOR ¶ 2.c). In
the jail, he exhibited signs of polysubstance abuse, and he admitted he had consumed 24
beers before his arrest (SOR ¶ 4.a). He posted a bond of $2,000 on May 23, 1988, and
was released from custody. On June 8, 1988, he pled guilty to assault by contact on his ex-
wife and was fined $200 plus costs. (GEs 6, 21.) Applicant testified at his hearing that his
ex-wife “broke into the house.” (Tr. 62.)
In September 1988, Applicant married his second wife, and one month later, he
enlisted in the U.S. military. On April 22, 1989, he was arrested for breach of peace and
third degree assault after he started a fight with another person at a local motel (SOR ¶
2.d). Applicant was intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol when he was arrested. (GE
7.) During a subject interview with a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) special agent in
May  1989,  Applicant  volunteered  that  he  had  consumed  eight  to  ten  mixed  drinks
containing vodka before the incident and that he was fined $35. He also reported an arrest
in May 1989 for malicious damage (SOR ¶ 2.e). After consuming a gallon of vodka at a
concert,  he  started  an  argument  and  dented  the  hood  of  the  victim’s  vehicle.  He  was
required to pay $200 in restitution and $43 in court fees. (GE 21.)
At  the  request  of  his  military  command,  Applicant  was  evaluated  at  his  base’s
counseling and assistance center on May 22, 1989. He acknowledged responsibility for two
pre-service alcohol-related incidents for which he had a pre-service waiver. He indicated
that he had been drinking regularly since age 16, and that his drinking had doubled while in
the military. He expressed a desire to abstain from alcohol, and reported drinking more
than intended, loss of control, increasing tolerance, and some withdrawal symptoms. The
screener opined that Applicant was “psychologically dependent” on alcohol and that he
was likely to continue to abuse alcohol unless he completed Level III inpatient treatment. It
was  recommended  that  he  attend  a  minimum  of  three  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings  per  week  and  be  placed  on  a  supervised  Antabuse  program  in  the  interim.
Applicant satisfactorily completed a 36-hour alcohol and drug education course on June
23,  1989.  On  June  29,  1989,  he  was  processed  for  disqualification  from  his  military
program because of his alcohol problem and was advised that failure to complete the Level
III drug and alcohol abuse program would be grounds for his separation from the military.
(GE 5.)
On his admission to the Level III program in July 1989, Applicant was diagnosed
with substance abuse disorder (SOR ¶ 4.b). He reported a significant increase in tolerance
since January 1989. He was admitted to a structured program of group therapy, individual
counseling, and education with a strong AA component. He was cautious at first but was
later able to identify factors impacting his alcohol use and to initiate actions to address his
problem. He was active in developing his aftercare plan, which included meeting with his
command’s drug and alcohol program advisor on a weekly basis for one year; participating
in a 12-step program; submitting to urinalysis screening at least four times per month for
one year; and attending a formal aftercare group two hours a week for 12 weeks. He was
returned to active duty in August 1989 with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. (GE 5.)
Applicant and his second wife divorced in early November 1989. (GEs 1-2.) On
November 9, 1989, Applicant was evaluated by a military clinical psychologist because of
suicidal ideation. He reported abstinence from alcohol since August 1989 with the help of
nightly AA meetings, but admitted that he had started thinking about suicide about two
months prior. He exhibited a depressed mood with a constricted affect. He was diagnosed
with alcohol dependence (alcoholism) in remission, and avoidant personality traits, but
found fit for full duty. He was advised to obtain an AA sponsor and to receive group and
individual  therapy  through  the  command’s  psychiatry  department.  In  December  1989,
Applicant  was  dis-enrolled  from  his  weekly  aftercare  group  for  failing  to  show  for  a
scheduled session for the second time. (GE 5.) Applicant was discharged from his military
service obligation in March 1990. (GE 1.)
Applicant was married to his third wife from June 1992 to October 1995. (GEs 1-2.)
There is no evidence that he had any legal or substance abuse problems during that time.
In December 1995, Applicant was arrested for threatening, breach of peace, bigotry, and
assault  on  a  police  officer  (SOR  ¶  2.f).  (GE  8.)  No  details  are  in  evidence  about  the
offense.
Applicant  and  his  fourth  wife  married  in  June  1997,  but  they  separated  around
October 2000 or 2001 and were divorced in approximately 2006. (GEs 1, 22.) In February
2005,  he  was  arrested  for  his  own  safety  following  an  incident  involving  a  girlfriend.
Applicant appeared to be suicidal. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital (SOR ¶ 1.b),
where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He indicated during a June 2006 interview
with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he spent four days in the
hospital (GE 22), although he reported to a clinical provider in 2012 that he was in the
hospitalized for two weeks in 2005. (GE 17.) Applicant was charged with possession of a
loaded handgun and domestic violence for the incident involving his girlfriend (SOR ¶ 2.g),
but the charges were nolle prossed in March 2005. (GEs 3, 22.)
While on a temporary work assignment for his current employer in approximately
July 2005, a co-worker told Applicant that he should try marijuana to relax.  Applicant took
one or two puffs from a marijuana cigarette offered him by the co-worker. From November
2005 to 2006, Applicant used marijuana with the son of his current spouse. Applicant liked
the effect, but did not use any marijuana for the next three years. (GE 22.)
To renew his security clearance, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National
Security Positions (SF 86) on December 5, 2005. He indicated that he had consulted with a
mental  health  professional  from  February  2005  to  June  2005,  and  that  he  had  been
arrested in February 2005 for possession of a loaded handgun and domestic violence for
which  he  had  to  complete  violence  education  classes.  He  responded  negatively  to  an
inquiry concerning whether he had illegally used any controlled substance in the last seven
years (SOR ¶ 5.b). (GE 1.) When he answered the SOR, Applicant denied falsifying his SF
86, stating that he had not used marijuana in the seven years preceding the application.
After it was pointed out to Applicant at his hearing that his reported use of marijuana in July
2005 predated his December 2005 SF 86, Applicant explained that he “was thinking it was
backwards,” i.e., that his drug use occurred after he completed his SF 86. (Tr. 70.)
From 2009 to the spring of 2015, Applicant used marijuana with acquaintances he
met  while  playing  disc  golf.  Between  the  spring  of  2015  and  February  2016,  he  used
marijuana  with  his  wife’s  son  on  four  occasions.  Applicant  was  usually  provided  the
marijuana that he used, but a few times he contributed money towards its cost. (GE 22.)
In January 2012, Applicant began taking several psychiatric medications prescribed
for him by his primary care physician. On October 19, 2012, Applicant sought treatment
from  a  behavioral  health  service,  complaining  of  anxiety  and  depression.  He  reported
sobriety from alcohol for the past 23 years. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and
referred for treatment at a psychiatric hospital. (GE 19; Tr. 50-51.)  Applicant was formally
discharged from the behavioral health service on January 3, 2013, for failure to attend any
sessions beyond the initial assessment. (GE 20.)
Applicant began treatment at the psychiatric hospital on November 12, 2012, four
days after the death of his sister (SOR ¶ 1.b). He reported a history of depression with
outbursts  of  anger  and  deterioration  of  his  condition  for  about  a  year.  He  denied  any
drinking  since  1989,  but  admitted  experiencing  suicidal  ideation  daily.  Applicant  was
treated for four days in the facility’s partial hospitalization program (PHP) and twelve days
in its intensive outpatient program (IOP). Random screens were negative for alcohol (he
reported attending AA) but positive for marijuana (SOR ¶ 3.b). After acknowledging that he
needed to stop seeing his friends who use marijuana, he reported a relapse of marijuana
use  on  December  19,  2012.  At  his  discharge  on  December  21,  2012,  Applicant  was
diagnosed on Axis I with bipolar I disorder – severe without psychotic feat – depressed;
PTSD;  cannabis  abuse  –  unspecified;  ADHD  not  otherwise  specified;  and  alcohol
dependence  in  sustained  full  remission.  He  was  diagnosed  on  Axis  II  with  antisocial
personality disorder. At discharge, Applicant was assessed at low risk for harm to self or
others.  Aftercare  plans  included  follow-up  with  the  behavioral  health  service  and
pharmacological management. (GE 17.) There is no evidence that he engaged in aftercare
treatment at that time other than medication management by his primary care doctor.
On  January  13,  2014,  Applicant  sought  treatment  in  a  hospital’s  emergency
department for depression and thoughts of suicide. He was discharged to follow up in the
hospital’s PHP, where he received treatment from January 16, 2014, to March 7, 2014, for
his diagnosed bipolar disorder I, PTSD, and attention deficit disorder (ADD). He reported
on admission to the PHP that he had been using marijuana for eight years, although not
within the past ten days. His attendance in the program was sporadic, but he reported no
use of marijuana while in the program. On his discharge, he was given a good prognosis
provided he followed up with recommended counseling. (GE 15.)
On March 20, 2014, he began psychotherapy three times a week with a licensed
clinical social worker (LCSW), who diagnosed him on Axis I with major depressive affective
disorder  –  recurrent  episode,  moderate  degree;  PTSD;  and  alcohol  dependence  in
remission. Applicant told the LCSW he was not using any marijuana and had abstained
from alcohol for the last 25 years. (GE 14.)
Applicant had developed a close relationship with a girlfriend’s grandson. After their
relationship ended, his ex-girlfriend threatened to prevent him from seeing her grandson.
Applicant  reacted  by  attempting  suicide,  overdosing on his prescription Xanax and his
insulin drug on April 1, 2014. (Tr. 52-53.) He was administered Narcan at the emergency
room of a local hospital, where he became very agitated, tried to hit emergency room staff
and hospital security, and threatened to kill one of the security officers. (GEs 3, 10, 13, 22.)
He tested positive for benzodiazepine, amphetamines, cannabis, and opiates, and was
admitted to the intensive care unit, where he continued to express threats toward his ex-
girlfriend. He was diagnosed with multiple drug overdose, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, and
transferred on April 3, 2014, to the hospital’s inpatient psychiatric unit on an involuntary
legal status (SOR ¶ 1.b). He had good behavioral control on the unit and explained that he
overdosed as a test of his ex-girlfriend’s love, i.e., would she obtain medical attention for
him.  On  April 7,  2014,  Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  hospital with  a  diagnosis of
bipolar disorder – recurrent, severe, mixed with psychosis, to follow up with his outpatient
counseling and medication management. (GE 13.)
While Applicant was in the hospital, his ex-girlfriend served him with a restraining
order. After his discharge, Applicant relapsed on alcohol and marijuana for a couple of
days because he was depressed. He started texting and leaving voice messages on his ex-
girlfriend’s cellular phone and drove by her house. On April 12, 2014, he was arrested for
violating the protective order. (GEs 9, 12, 14, 22.) On April 15, 2014, Applicant was treated
in a hospital emergency room after state police, in responding to a welfare check, found
Applicant in an agitated and belligerent state. He had called his supervisor and expressed
a  threat  of  suicide.  A  urine  screen  was  positive  for  cannabinoids.    Applicant  was
discharged  from  the  emergency  room  after  declining  treatment,  but  he  continued  his
outpatient counseling with the LCSW. (GEs 14-15, 22.)
On May 2, 2014, Applicant had an argument with his current spouse (then fourth ex-
wife) over Applicant’s ex-girlfriend taking “his grandson” from him. Applicant’s spouse told
the police Applicant had pulled her hair, but he had not assaulted her. A witness stated that
Applicant had pinned his spouse to the ground. Applicant was arrested and charged with
disorderly conduct (SOR ¶ 2.j). (GEs 11-12, 22.) On February 10, 2015, the disorderly
conduct  charge  was  nolle  prossed.  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  violating  a  condition  of  his
release  for  violating  the  protective  order  obtained  by  his  ex-girlfriend,  and  he  was
sentenced to one year in jail (execution suspended), and two years of probation. (GE 12.)
He was also required to attend 26 weeks of anger management classes, which he began in
June 2015. (GE 18.)
An  arrest  warrant  was  issued for Applicant for breach of peace because of his
combative and threatening behavior in the hospital emergency room on April 1, 2014 (SOR
¶ 2.h). Applicant turned himself in to the police when he learned of the warrant on May 8,
2014. He was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail, execution suspended, and
placed on probation for two years. (GEs 10-12.)
The incidents of April and May 2014 occurred despite counseling and medication
management.  (GEs  14, 22.) On July 3, 2014, Applicant entered a PHP where he was
treated for bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation. He expressed on admission that he had
some auditory hallucinations. His anti-depressant medication was adjusted with positive
effect, and he was “stepped down” to the hospital’s intensive outpatient program on July
21, 2014. He was discharged on August 6, 2014, to aftercare counseling with his therapist
three  times  per  week,  and  medication  management  by  his  physician.  Applicant  was
clinically stable, and his prognosis was assessed as good as he was able to recognize his
triggers and his unhealthy behaviors. (GE 15.)
Applicant resumed his psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW on August 8, 2014.
His mood remained stable for the most part, although he was tearful over the loss of his
relationship  with  his ex-girlfriend’s grandson.  As  of  November 26,  2014,  he  was  using
marijuana occasionally as a sleep aid against the clinical advice of his therapist. (GE 14.)
Applicant reported his recent psychiatric treatment and his psychotherapy with the
LCSW on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) completed on February
13,  2015.  He  also  indicated  that  he  was  on  probation  for  two  years  for  violating  the
conditions of his release and for breach of peace. He falsely responded “No” to whether he
had used any illegal drug in the last seven years. He admits that he lied on his SF 86. (GE
1; Tr. 70.)
As of March 2015, Applicant was attending psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW
once a week. He had demonstrated increased insight and ability to make decisions in his
best interest. Inconsistent compliance with his medications and distress over being denied
a  promotion  at  work  led  to  an  increase  in  his  depression  in  July  2015,  although  his
condition improved once he took his medications as prescribed. Applicant married his fifth
wife  in  September  2015,  but  she  left  him  in  October  2015.  Applicant’s  mental  health
deteriorated after the breakup, and he missed two weeks of work because of his mental
state. He presented for a session with his treating LCSW in a decompensated state in late
October 2015. At the LCSW’s recommendation, Applicant was taken by his son to a local
hospital. (GEs 14, 22.)
Applicant received treatment the hospital from October 26 – 27, 2015, for diagnosed
bipolar disorder – most recent episode depressed; cannabis use disorder – moderate; and
alcohol use disorder in full remission. He tested positive for amphetamines and cannabis,
and admitted that he had used cannabis on 15 out of the last 30 days. He was transferred
from the emergency room to a psychiatric unit, where he was discharged at his request, to
obtain treatment elsewhere. He was advised to avoid alcohol and illegal drugs. (GEs 16,
22.)
On November 4, 2015, Applicant was assessed for treatment by a behavioral health
service. He had experienced multiple losses over the previous two years, to include the
suicide of a nephew. Applicant reported no current suicidal ideation, and no alcohol use for
the past 25 years. He admitted that he had used marijuana on October 21, 2015, but none
otherwise in the last 30 days. Applicant was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder – current or
most recent episode depressed, severe; and with PTSD. On November 9, 2015, Applicant
was admitted to a PHP five days per week. He was reminded of the risks of using alcohol
or illegal drugs and the risk of combining alcohol or other substances with his prescription
medications.  He  was  an  active  participant  in  group  therapy,  and  reported  regular
attendance at AA with no drinking. He was discharged in January 2016, having completed
the PHP and an IOP, to follow up with his therapist. (GE 18.) The last available progress
note of his treatment with the LCSW is dated February 23, 2016, although that progress
note does not reflect that he was discharged. (GE 14.) Applicant recalls having sessions
with  the  LCSW  in  2017  and  in  2018.  (Tr.  55.)  Of  all  his  treatments,  he  considers  his
sessions with the LCSW to have been the most beneficial for him. (Tr. 66.)
Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) on February 22, 2016. He detailed his involvement with marijuana,
including  on  four  occasions  since  the  spring  of  2015.  He  admitted  knowing  that  using
marijuana was not allowed because of his security clearance. His recent drug involvement
had been with his current wife’s son, and he contributed funds to pay for the drug two or
three times. Applicant added that he would never use marijuana at work. He expressed an
intention to continue using marijuana on his personal time because it helps him to cope. He
claimed his co-workers, family, and friends know about his marijuana use and denied it
could be a source of blackmail. (GE 22.)
On September 11, 2016, Applicant was arrested for felony unlawful restraint in the
first degree following a domestic violence incident involving an ex-girlfriend. (GE 3.) His ex-
girlfriend, who wanted to get drunk with him, bought a bottle of whiskey. After getting “very
wasted” with her, he tried to choke her during an argument. (GE 4; Tr. 71-72.) The offense
was in violation of his probation for the April 2014 protective order violation. On November
1, 2017, he was sentenced  to three years in jail, execution suspended, and placed on
probation  for  three  years.  (GE  9.)  Applicant  was  also  required  to  attend  a  six-month
domestic  violence  program,  which  he  completed.  (Tr.  72-73.)  He  testified  that  his  ex-
girlfriend indicated that she would write a positive letter to the court to end his probation
early  in  2019.  (Tr.  73.)  He  presented  no  record  showing  that  his  probation  has  been
terminated.
At  the  request  of  the  DOD,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed  clinical
psychologist on May 6, 2018. He reported to the psychologist that he had been attending
anger management classes twice per week since January 2018. He explained that he had
stopped his psychotherapy with the LCSW at the latter’s request. He claimed without any
corroboration that the LCSW told him he was on the cusp of recovery and his coping skills
were good, although he then admitted that he got bored with the therapy and had no plans
to resume it. He was taking medications prescribed by his primary care physician, and he
expressed an intention to continue taking them for his mental stability. Applicant described
current symptoms of low esteem, sadness, attention and concentration issues, and missing
his ex-girlfriend’s grandson. He reported a supportive relationship with his fourth ex-wife
(spouse  as  of  August  2019).  He  denied  any  episodes  of  mania  since  2014.  When
discussing his past treatments, Applicant generally indicated that they were beneficial.
Regarding substance abuse, he stated that he had been abstinent from alcohol from May
1989  to  September  2016,  when  he  relapsed  for  one  day.  He  stated  that  he  was  not
currently using any illegal drugs, and while he had used marijuana occasionally to help him
calm down from approximately 2005 through 2014, he only used it with friends at parties.
He acknowledged knowing that he was not supposed to use marijuana while holding a
security clearance. Applicant also admitted that he was currently on probation after he
choked an ex-girlfriend. (GE 4.)
During the evaluation, Applicant appeared guarded when discussing clinical issues;
demonstrated loss associations; and needed repeated, direct, and specific questions to
disclose information that did not portray him in a positive manner. He was not involved in
any psychotherapy. In the opinion of the psychologist, Applicant’s judgment and reliability
appeared  poor,  and  his  insight  appeared  fair.  He  diagnosed  Applicant  with  bipolar  I
disorder  –  unspecified,  ADHD  –  combined  presentation;  and  borderline  personality
disorder.  Applicant  did  not  report  any  current  PTSD  symptoms  or  substance  abuse,
although the psychologist opined that Applicant likely met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis
as  well.  He  found  it  concerning  that  Applicant  had  used  marijuana  while  holding  a
clearance and indicated that he would be very concerned if Applicant resumed drinking. He
assessed  Applicant’s  prognosis as guarded and opined that  the bipolar I disorder and
10
borderline personality disorder are conditions that negatively impact Applicant’s reliability,
judgment,  stability,  and  trustworthiness.  If  Applicant  became  noncompliant  with  his
medications,  it  would  have a significant negative impact on his reliability, stability, and
judgment. The psychologist considered Applicant’s disengagement from his psychotherapy
to be ill-advised. Applicant’s longtime employment since 1990, his dedication to his job,
and  the  fact  that  Applicant  felt  much  better  than  in  the  past,  were  favorable  issues
warranting consideration in the opinion of the psychologist. (GE 4.)
Applicant testified that he obtained a medical marijuana card in January 2017. (Tr.
64.) He denies any use of marijuana since his last use sometime during the spring of 2019.
(Tr.  67.)  He  explained  that  he  had  used  marijuana  in  the  past  when  he  “was  in  total
breakdown.” (Tr. 63-64, 67-68.) He admitted that he lied on his February 2015 SF 86 form
by denying that he used any illegal drug in the last seven years. (Tr. 70.) He knew that
marijuana use was not allowed while he held a DOD clearance. (Tr. 67.) Applicant does not
currently attend AA. He denies any current consumption of alcohol and any intention to
drink in the future. (Tr. 73.) He realizes that drinking any alcohol will not help him because
he loses control when he drinks. (Tr. 74.)
Applicant is grateful to the DOD for granting him the privilege of having a clearance,
which has allowed him to continue his work over the years. He does not believe that he has
worked on any classified projects. Some of his co-workers do not have security clearances.
Applicant believes he has done his job well. He is passionate about his work and has had
no trouble focusing on his work. (Tr. 46-49.) He continues to struggle on a daily basis with
controlling  his  emotions.  (Tr.  54.)  He  is  currently  prescribed  Lamictal  (for  his  bipolar
disorder),  Adderall,  and  a  new  anti-depressant.  He  does  not  always  take  the  Adderall
because it impairs his ability to sleep, and he does not think the Lamictal is helping him.
(Tr. 56-57.) He sought counseling for anxiety and depression through his EAP in late spring
2019, and he was referred to a local psychiatric hospital where they wanted to admit him to
an inpatient substance abuse treatment program. He was using marijuana at that time,
although he denies he was drinking alcohol. He did not pursue treatment because he did
not want to take more time away from his work. (Tr. 58-59.) Applicant testified that he is
“holding  it  together,”  and  learning  to  not  allow  his  emotions  to  get  the  better  of  his
judgment. (Tr. 59-60.)
Applicant’s current spouse has known Applicant for over 25 years. She testified that
he has stopped drinking; that they have no alcohol in their house; and that they do not go
to bars or to alcohol stores. She has not seen him with any alcohol since September 2016.
(Tr. 76-78.) She is aware that he obtained a medical marijuana card in 2017 and that he
last used marijuana in the spring of 2019 when “he was having an episode.” (Tr. 81-82.) To
her knowledge, Applicant “only uses it when he has an issue.” She does not know how
Applicant obtained the marijuana that he used earlier this year. (Tr. 82.) In all the years that
she has known him, Applicant has not talked about his work with her. (Tr. 83-84.)
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  2004  to  August  2015  attests  that  Applicant
demonstrated a high level of proficiency working on very complex products. This former
supervisor never witnessed Applicant intoxicated or impaired at their workplace. Applicant
11
always put full effort into his duties and cared about his work. The supervisor knows of “no
professional reason” why Applicant should lose his security clearance. (AE A.)
A co-worker of Applicant’s for the last 15 years, who has become a close friend,
indicated that he understands the concerns, but he trusts Applicant with his life. In his
experience,  Applicant  has  been  committed  to  providing  a  quality  product  for  the  U.S.
military. As a friend, Applicant has been reliable, consistent, and trustworthy. (AE B.)
Applicant’s supervisor since 2014 has known Applicant since 2001. They graduated
from  apprenticeship  school  together  and  worked  on  the  same  crew  on  and  off.  This
supervisor indicated that he has not witnessed or suspected Applicant of coming to work
under the influence of any substance. He vouched for Applicant’s integrity as a trusted
employee and patriot. Applicant continues to be a “valuable and necessary asset to [his]
crew.” (AE C.)
",False
"Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  single  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  a
bachelor’s degree, and two master’s degrees. He is employed as a strategic planner, and
is  seeking  to  retain  a  security  clearance  previously  granted  in  connection  with  his
employment.  He  has  worked  for  his  employer  since  2004  and  received  a  security
clearance in approximately 2007. (Tr. 14-16; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A,
and 17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  the  single  allegation  under  this
paragraph.
Applicant  used  cocaine  a total of three  times  in  his life  – once  in 2012,  once  in
2013, and a final time in 2014. Each use coincided with parties or concerts that Applicant
was attending. Applicant never purchased any of the cocaine he used. Applicant admitted
that he got “caught up in the scene,” on the occasions when he used the drug. “I justified
that it was okay to do and then regretted it.” During the time he used cocaine Applicant
had a security clearance, but was not working on a classified program. (Tr. 25-30.)
Applicant has not used drugs since 2014, and has no desire to use illegal drugs in
the future. Applicant does not associate with anyone who uses illegal drugs. When he
found himself in about September 2018 at a party where other people in the group were
using  drugs,  he  removed  himself  from  that  vicinity.  Applicant  Exhibit  A  is  a  signed
statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement, acknowledging that any future
involvement is grounds for immediate revocation of national security eligibility. Applicant
took a drug test with negative results in April 2019.  (Tr. 33-34, 37-38, 40-41; Applicant
Exhibit F.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline E – Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  conduct  that  shows  poor  judgment,  untrustworthiness  or
unreliability.  Applicant  admitted  subparagraph  2.a,  which  alleged  that  his  drug  use
described under Paragraph 1, above, was cognizable under this guideline as well.
Mitigation
Applicant submitted evidence showing that he is a highly respected and successful
person  and  employee.  He  has  a  demanding  job,  and  does  it  well.  He  submitted
evaluations from 2013 through 2019 showing that he is consistently recognized as a top
performer. Applicant’s current manager delegates authority to  Applicant because of his
“responsible character.” (Tr. 18-21, 49; Applicant Exhibits C, D, E, and G.)
Letters of recommendation were submitted for Applicant from people who know
him  personally  and  professionally.  Three  co-workers,  and  a  friend  who  has  a  very
responsible job in the financial industry, recommend him for a position of trust, and also
indicated their understanding of the allegations in the SOR. (Tr. 21-23; Applicant Exhibit
B.)
",True
"Applicant  is  a  23-year-old  man  who,  as  last  documented,  was  anticipating
graduation from undergraduate school in May 2018. (Form, Item 4) At the time he was
interviewed as part of this process, he was a part-time intramural sports supervisor. He
has also held other part-time jobs typical of a university student. He has been extended
an offer for a position by a defense contractor.
In about November 2010, during his freshman year in high school, Applicant first
tried marijuana after a friend brought it to his home. The marijuana plant “bud” provided
was sufficient to make one “blunt” suitable for smoking. (FORM, Item 4) Applicant knew
using the substance was illegal, but he had a “desire to try it.” (FORM, Item 4)  After an
unrecalled number of inhalations, he felt the drug’s effects. Applicant continued to use
the drug because he “enjoyed it.” (FORM, Item 4) He used the drug, on average, one or
two  times  a  week  until  at  least  December  2018.  (FORM,  Item  4)  No  information
regarding his drug use after that date was offered.
Before his December 2018 usage, Applicant first purchased about 3.5 ounces of
marijuana. While he knew the purchase was illegal, he did so because “he wanted to.”
(FORM,  Item  4)  Initially,  Applicant  noted  that  he  intended  to  use  marijuana  into  the
future if it was legalized, he then later stated he intended to quit using it in the future --
“after 5/2018 and college” -- to focus on work. (FORM, Item 4) At that point, he planned
to “kick his habit” of marijuana use. (FORM, Item 4) He noted that he had been unaware
that  federal  law  specifically  prohibits  the  use  of  illegal  drugs  by  employees  of  defense
contractors.  Applicant concedes  he  was  immature  when  he  began using  the  drug,  but
represents  himself  now  as  mature.  (FORM,  Item  4)  He  considers  his  drug  use  to  be
voluntary and not very serious because he believes he can cease his “habit” whenever
he needs to do so.
In his teens and early 20s, Applicant also tried illegal hallucinogenic mushrooms
in  June  2017.  He  used  Adderall  that  had  been  prescribed  to  another  individual  from
about February 2015 to about May 2017. He similarly used someone else’s prescription
Hydrocodone  on  multiple  occasions  in  about  November  2015.  About  twice,  he
recreationally  used  another  person’s  Xanax,  from  about  February  2012  to  about
October 2015. Throughout this time, he was aware it was illegal to use someone else’s
prescription  medication.  (FORM,  Item  4)  Applicant  socially  tried  the  hallucinogenic
compound known as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), in August 2015. Before going out
to  socialize  and  party  over  alcoholic  beverages  once  in  February  2015,  he  also  used
cocaine.

"Applicant  is  30  years  old.    She  is  unmarried  and  has  no  children.    She  has  a
Bachelor’s  degree.    She  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  an  Administrative
Professional  II.    She  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  her
employment.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  began  working  for  a  defense  contractor  in  October  2017.    She  has
never held a security clearance before.   From May 2005 to November 2017, Applicant
used  marijuana  on  a  daily  basis.    She  states  that  she  uses  marijuana  to  treat  her
anxiety and mental disorders.  She also states that she no longer smokes marijuana on
a daily basis. She further states that she intends to continue using it to treat her anxiety
and mental disorders if she is unable to get a prescribed medication that does not have
negative side effects.  She indicates that she will speak to her therapist about seeking
other solutions than marijuana.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
To  provide  some  background,  Applicant  suffers  from  manic  depression,  bipolar
mood  disorder,  and  panic  disorder.    She  self-treats  her  mental  health  disorders  with
marijuana one time to two times weekly at present.  At some point, she was prescribed
medication  by  her  therapist  but  that  made  her  feel  bad,  so  she  stopped  using  her
prescribed medication and went back to using marijuana.  Applicant indicates that she
smokes alone on the weekends when she does not have to drive.  She states that she
will only stop using marijuana if she is prescribed a medication that does not make her
feel  bad.    Applicant  has  never  incurred  any  financial  difficulties  as  a  result  of  her
marijuana use.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
",False
"Applicant, age 27, has been married since 2016. He has one minor child and an
adult stepson. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2014. He has been employed as an
engineer by the same federal contractor since 2011, initially as an intern and then full-
time status in 2015. He was granted a DOD security clearance in 2014.
The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guidelines  H  and  E,  Applicant’s  use  and  purchase  of
marijuana from about November 2016 through May 2017, which occurred while he held
a security clearance. It also alleged his May 2017 arrest for possession of marijuana and
paraphernalia. Under Guideline E,  it alleged that Applicant failed to immediately report
his May 2017 arrest, as required. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted to each of the
Guideline H and E allegations, without explanation.
In his September 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had been arrested in May
2017 and charged with two misdemeanors, “possession of marijuana” and “possession
of paraphernalia.” At that time, he was awaiting a trial, scheduled for November 2018. He
also  disclosed  the  following  facts  concerning  his  marijuana  use:  (1)  First  use:
approximately November 2016; (2) Most recent use: May 2017; (3) Frequency: “I would
smoke  mainly  on  weekends  and  during  stressful  times;”  (4)  Use  occurred  while
possessing a security clearance; and (5) No intent to use in the future, with the following
explanation: “Doing this has messed up my life, family and is affecting my job. This was
not worth losing any of these. I regret ever doing this.” He disclosed the following facts
concerning how he obtained marijuana: (1) “I would get marijuana from someone I knew
to smoke;” and (2) Frequency: “Once a month.” He disclosed the following facts about the
reasons he used and purchased marijuana: (1) “This time period was [sic] low period of
my life and [sic] was stressed out. During this time period I got married, had a baby, and
was moving to a new house;” (2) “I was stressed out dealing with my family and my life
changed drastically when I got married, had a baby and got a new house.” (Item 5 at 28-
29, 30-31).
In his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he “voluntarily sought counseling or treatment
as a result” of his marijuana use. He explained that he was “Going to a counselor to talk
about what has happened and dealing with my stress.” At the time he completed the SCA,
he had scheduled his first appointment, but had not yet begun the counseling. (Item 5 at
32-33). He also disclosed that his DOD security clearance had been “denied, suspended,
or revoked” in August 2017 because “I did not report an arrest immediately and I waited
approximately 40 days to self report.” (Item 5 at 35).
During his February 2018 SI, Applicant expounded on the facts and circumstances
underlying his marijuana use, purchase, and arrest; and his reporting of the arrest to his
employer.  He  reiterated  that  he  was  motivated  to  use  marijuana  due  to  various
contemporaneous  stressors,  including  a  new  marriage,  home,  and  baby;  and  issues
concerning  his  troubled  stepson,  who  then  resided  with  him  and  his  wife.  He  also
expressed his intent never to use marijuana again, citing his job and family as motivation.
He admitted that he lied when he told the investigator that he obtained marijuana from a
friend because he did not want to disclose the name of his drug dealer. He purchased
approximately 1/4 to 1/8 ounces of marijuana per month from the dealer. (Item 6 at 2-6).
Applicant’s May 2017 arrest occurred on a Monday between approximately 12:00
pm and 1:00 pm while he was driving from home to work. The officer initially pulled him
over  for  speeding,  but  asked  to  search  his  vehicle  because  he  smelled  marijuana.  He
consented to the search, during which the officer found a container filled with one to two
grams of marijuana and a pipe. He was arrested and brought to the police station, where
he spent approximately 20 minutes before he was released. Approximately three hours
from the time he was pulled over, he retrieved his car, which had been towed upon his
arrest, and then drove straight to work. When he arrived at his work location, he acted as
if nothing had happened and did not immediately report his arrest. Applicant’s criminal
charges  were  initially  adjudicated  in  July  2017.  His  case  was  diverted  to  a  pre-trial
program for first time offenders. Because he successfully completed the tasks required
of the program, including an eight hour course that specifically targeted marijuana use,
his case was dismissed in July 2018. (Item 4; Item 6 at 2-3 and 5-6).
Applicant admitted to the investigator during the SI, albeit after initially providing a
more benign reason, that he knew that he should have immediately reported his arrest to
his employer and failed to do so because he felt really bad about it and was fearful that
he was going to lose his job. He reported it approximately 40 days after his arrest, after
he  was  advised  by  his  employer  that  he  would  be  required  to  complete  a  security
questionnaire for a new job assignment. Before completing the questionnaire, which he
knew would require him to list his arrest, Applicant submitted an adverse report disclosing
the arrest to his security office. After receiving the adverse report, his employer revoked
his security clearance, relocated him, and disciplined him for the following reasons: (1)
failure to notify them about his arrest; (2) drug use; and (3) mischarging his time on the
day  of  his  arrest.  The  discipline  included  a  one-week  unpaid  suspension,  one  year  of
therapy, and a two-year probation which required “heightened drug tests.” At the time of
the SI, Applicant had not yet been subjected to any drug tests by his employer. (Item 6 at
3-4).
Applicant  engaged  the  services  of  a  therapist  through  an  employer-sponsored
program. He began therapy in late September or October 2017, initially weekly and then
once  every  other  week.  As  of  March  2018,  he  had  not  missed  any  sessions,  which
primarily involved helping him cope with his life stressors with specific emphasis on issues
related to his stepson. He described his stepson’s issues, which included mental health,
drug use, and police involvement, as “very stressful.” He did not provide any information
about sessions, if any, after March 2018. Without providing any records from his therapist
about his diagnosis or prognosis, he averred that he has not been diagnosed with any
substance use disorder. Through therapy, he learned alternative coping mechanisms to
deal with his stress. (Item 6 at 2, 4 and 5).
Applicant  began  using  marijuana  approximately  six  to  nine  months  before  his
arrest. He never previously used any illegal drug. He knew that he was prohibited from
using marijuana due to his employer’s drug-free workplace policy, and because he held
a security clearance. Thus, he intentionally separated his marijuana use from work, using
it only on Saturdays and Sundays. He consumed marijuana by smoking it either in his car
or in a closet in his home on each day of the weekend, which relaxed him and helped him
calm  down.  He  has  not  used  marijuana  since  the day  before his May  2017  arrest.  He
used marijuana with his wife, who has smoked marijuana daily since he met her in 2014,
purportedly for back pain. She does not have a prescription for medical marijuana, and
has no plans to discontinue her use, which has been a source of tension between them.
(Item 6 at 4-5).

"Unless  otherwise  indicated  by  citation  to  another  part  of  the  record,  I  have
extracted these findings of fact from Applicant’s SOR answer (Item 2) and his SCA (Item
3).
Applicant, age 36, is divorced and has no children. He was married from July 2015
through March 2017. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2010. He has been employed
as a project manager by a federal contractor since 2011. This is his first application for a
security clearance.
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  marijuana  use  “with  varying  frequency”  from
approximately  November  2003  through  April  2018,  and  his  subsequent  lack  of  candor
about  that  use  in  response  to  DOHA  Interrogatories.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant
admitted the alleged marijuana use but denied any intentional dishonesty about his use.
In  his February  2018 SCA,  Applicant  certified  the following  facts  concerning  his
marijuana use: (1) First use was approximately November 2003; (2) Most recent use was
March 2016; (3) As to the frequency of use, he stated “Honestly, not sure. I have tried it
maybe  5-10  times  in  about  15  years. Definitely  only  thrice  since  Fall  of  2006;”  and  (4)
Applicant declared that he had no intent to use in the future, with the following explanation:
“Too scared that I am still allergic to it and I do not enjoy the experience.” (Item 3 at 29-
31).
During a February 2018 subject interview (SI) with a DOD authorized investigator,
Applicant disclosed the following facts concerning his marijuana use: (1) Used one time
at a beach house with friends in April 2018 after completion of the SCA; (2) April 2018
use occurred because Applicant “was curious of the effects and wanted to see if it would
make [him] sick or not;” (3) Motivation of April 2018 use was “curiosity;” and (4) Applicant
socialized  or  associated  with  individuals  who  use  drugs  illegally  “two  or  three  times  a
year.” (Item 4 at 7-8).
The investigator’s written summary of the SI (SI Summary) does not explicitly state
that Applicant discussed any other marijuana use. Before the facts and circumstances of
the  April  2018  use,  the  SI  Summary’s  “Drug  Involvement”  section  opened  with  the
following sentence: “Subject has developed drug involvement with marijuana.” In the SI
Summary’s  “Additional  Information”  section  included  the  following  sentence:  “All  other
information discussed with  Subject,  to  include  coverage  of  the  adjudicative  guidelines,
was consistent with the security questionnaire.”
In February 2019, DOHA propounded upon Applicant questions (Interrogatories)
concerning his drug involvement that were prompted by information obtained by a DOD
authorized  investigator  during  the  investigations  process,  including  the  SI.  Applicant
certified the accuracy, without amendment, of that portion of the SI Summary concerning
his marijuana use. He answered “yes” to the question of whether he had “EVER used
illegally any drugs or controlled substances” and provided the following handwritten facts
about that use: (1) Used marijuana one time in March 2016 and one time in April 2018;
(2) April 2018 use was “as described” in the SI; (3) March 2016 use was during a bachelor
party where he “tried [it] once from a friend with no results;” and (4) Did not intend to use
marijuana in the future. (Item 4 at 4).
In his March 2019 SOR answer, Applicant stated the following: “I fear that it was
my drive to be as precise, accurate, and as literal as possible that has led us to this point.”
He asserted that he has not used marijuana since April 2018 and, since that time, has
“either  cut  back  completely  or  drastically  decreased”  his  interactions  with  individuals
involved with drug use. He also included a signed statement of intent to abstain from all
drug involvement and substance misuse, including an acknowledgment that “any future
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.”
With respect to the Interrogatory response at issue in the SOR, Applicant claimed
the following: (1) He tried to be “as accurate and literal as possible to avoid further SORs,
confusion,  and  issues;”  (2)  His  response  was  “accurate  per  [his]  interpretation  of  the
question;” (3) He interpreted the question to ask whether he was “breaking any U.S. laws;”
(4) He did not include the uses prior to April 2018 because they “had occurred overseas
and  not  on  U.S.  soil;”  (5)  He  was  not  “trying  to  be  dishonest  or  deceitful”  through  his
omission of uses prior to April 2018; (6) He knew that investigators had access to his SCA
which included the prior uses so it would make “no sense for [him] to contradict [himself]
intentionally or in a falsifying manner;” (7) His intent is “genuine and honest” and he  is
“not trying to hide anything;” and (8) This is “simply a case of a misunderstanding while
trying to provide the most accurate and literal responses that I can.”
In his SOR answer, Applicant described his importance to the project that requires
him  to  maintain  a  security  clearance.  He  stated  that  it  would  be  “a  great  honor  and
privilege” to be granted a security clearance so that he would be able to follow through
on his commitment to that project.

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted all the Guideline H allegations, but denied the
Guideline E allegations. I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 28 years old. He is engaged to be married and has no children. He
has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  major  defense  contractor,  since  July  2016.  He
holds bachelor degrees in computer science and mathematics. He has held a security
clearance since September 2016. (Tr. at 5-6, 19; GE 1-3)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from
January  2012  to  at  least  January  2019;  that  he  used  marijuana  while  being  granted
access  to  classified  information  in  September 2016;  and he  stated  he  intended  to  use
marijuana in the future. The SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified his answers when
completing his security clearance applications (SCA) in May and October 2016 when he
failed to disclose his marijuana use within the last seven years on both SCAs, and when
he failed to disclose his use of marijuana while having access to classified information
on his October 2016 SCA.
Applicant described his marijuana use as beginning in approximately 2012 when
a friend baked some marijuana-laced brownies that Applicant consumed. This use was
in a state that prohibited marijuana use for any purposes. Applicant was diagnosed with
throat  cancer  in  2011  and  received  radiation  treatment  for  over  six  months.  The
treatment  left  Applicant  with  regular  migraine  headaches.  Applicant  claims  his  primary
care doctor (unnamed) recommended that he use marijuana for the pain. The doctor did
not  provide  a  written  recommendation  or  prescription  for marijuana  use.  (Tr. at  20-22;
Answer; AE A, D)
In 2016, after getting the job with his employer, Applicant moved to a state where
marijuana  has  been  legalized  under  state  law.  He  then  began  using  marijuana  more
frequently. His frequency of use after he began working for his employer and completing
his first SCA was one to two times a month. He claimed he used marijuana only to deal
with  the  migraine  pain  at  night  so  he  could  sleep.  He  purchased  marijuana  from
dispensaries. He used marijuana after completing his SCA in May 2016, after receiving
a  security  clearance  in  September  2016,  after  completing  his  SCA  in  October  2016,
after  completing  his  background  interview  (BI)  with  a  defense  investigator  in  March
2018, and after answering interrogatories in February 2019. Applicant did not stop using
marijuana until after he received the SOR in March 2019. In both his BI in March 2018
and  in  his  answers  to  interrogatories  in  February  2019,  he  stated  that  he  intended  to
continue using marijuana in the future. (Tr. at 20-22, 24-27, 29; Answer; GE 1-3; AE A,
D)
Applicant  claims  he  was  unaware  that  marijuana  use  was  prohibited  under
federal  law  until  he  saw  a  “flyer”  posted  at  work  about  the  subject.  He  took  a  pre-
employment  drug  test,  but  does  not  recall  being  informed  about  the  company’s  drug
policies.  (Note:  the  Drug-Free  Workplace  Act  requires  Federal  contractors  with  a
contract over $100,000 to establish certain drug-free workplace policies. (See, 41 U.S.
Code § 8101-8106. See also, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 C.F.R § 52.223-6,
Drug-Free  Workplace))  He  admitted  that  he  failed  to  seek  out  more  information  after
noticing  the  flyer  and  continued  to  use  marijuana.  Once  he  received  the  SOR,  he
realized  that  his  marijuana  use  was  a  significant  issue  and  in  his  SOR  answer  he
claimed  he  would  cease  using  marijuana  immediately  and  try  to  find  another  type  of
pain  relief  for  his  migraines.  He  provided  drug  test  results  from  June  2019  showing  a
negative presence for marijuana (THC) or any other illegal drugs. He also volunteered
to take drug tests in the future to show his commitment to abstinence. (Tr. at 21, 24-25,
31-32; Answer; AE A)
Applicant  explained  the  reason  he  failed  to  list  his  drug  use  on  his  May  2016
SCA was because he was out of the country at the time his employer notified him that
he needed to complete the SCA immediately. He only had his cell phone and the SCA
format was not displaying well on his phone. As a result, he incorrectly answered no to
the  question  about  past  drug  use  within  seven  years.  He  claimed  this  was  a  mistake
and not intentional. He received his secret clearance in September 2016 and in October
2016  was  told  to  complete  another  SCA  to  request  a  top  secret  clearance.  He  again
failed to list his marijuana use within the last seven years and he also failed to list his
use while possessing a security clearance. Applicant explained his incorrect answers by
stating  that  since  this  SCA  was  prepopulated  with  the  information  he  provided  on  his
May 2016 SCA, he did not scrutinize his answers as closely as he should have to make
any  changes.  He  did update  one  area  of  this  October  2016  SCA  to  show  that  he now
possessed  a  secret  clearance.  When  Applicant  was  asked  during  his  BI  whether  his
answers  to  the  drug  questions  were  correct,  he  stated  no  and  described  his  previous
drug use. (Tr. at 22-23, 27, 31; Answer; GE 1-3)
Applicant presented an email from his employer indicating that he was selected
as  the  employee  of  the  month  for  April  2019.  This  award  was  given  to  him  for
demonstrating outstanding analytical and problem solving skills. (AE B)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  denied  the  Guideline  E  allegation  and
admitted the Guideline H allegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the evidence, I make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old. He is a native-born U.S. citizen. His father was a major
in  the  U.S.  Army.  He  is  the  owner  and  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  of  his  own
business.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  a  U.S.  university.  He  has  never  held  a
security clearance. He married for the second time in 2016. He was married to his first
wife from 1998 to 2009. He has three children, ages 19, 17, and 16.  His ex-wife, wife,
and children are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. 6, 39; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  ownership  and  control  over  an  information
systems  (IT)  company  located  in  India  create  a  conflict  of  interest  under  Guideline  B.
The SOR further alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency  from  October  1988  to  February  2017,  and  that  Applicant  stated,  in  August
2018, his intent to continue using marijuana in the future.
Foreign Influence
In  2009,  Applicant  became  the  sole  owner  of  his  U.S.-based  IT  company  (C1),
which  has  customers  throughout  the  world.  C1  was  built  to  implement  out-of-the-box
packaged  software,  such  as  Oracle,  to  help  companies  improve  the  way  they  do
business.  Applicant,  through  C1,  also owns  an IT  company established  and  located  in
India (C2). Applicant describes C2 as merely a “tool” for his overall business to use to
reduce costs. Many large multinational companies such as Accenture, Deloitte, and IBM
use  the  same  business  structure.  C2  performs  technical  information  tasks  that  their
global  clients  require.  C2  is  a  virtual  company  which  has  no  servers  of  its  own  and
therefore  does  not  store  any  customer  data  itself.  The  Indian  government  has  no
regulatory control over C2. Applicant estimated the 2018 revenues for C1 at $18 million
and for C2 at $1.9 million. Applicant has never been to India. Applicant credibly  stated
that if C1 were to win a U.S. government contract with security implications, C2 would
be  excluded  from  any  participation  in  the  administration  of  that  contract.  C1  currently
has  such  contracts  with  other  U.S.  government  agencies  and  C2  is  excluded  from
participation in those contracts. (Tr. 22, 24-32, 34-36; Ans.; GE 2-3)
India
India  is  a  sovereign,  socialist,  secular,  democratic  republic.  It  is  a  multiparty,
federal  parliamentary  democracy  with  a  bicameral  parliament  and  a  population  of
approximately 1.1 billion.
The  Indian  government  generally  respects  the  rights  of  its  citizens,  but  serious
problems  remain.  Police  and  security  forces  have  engaged  in  extrajudicial  killings  of
persons  in  custody,  disappearance,  torture,  and  rape.  The  lack  of  accountability
permeated the government and security forces, creating an atmosphere in which human
rights violations went unpunished. A number of violent attacks were committed in recent
years  by  separatist  and  terrorist  groups.  In  November  2008,  terrorists  coordinated  an
attack at a hotel in Mumbai, frequented by westerners.
The  United  States  recognizes  India  as  key  to  strategic  interests  and  has
sought  to  strengthen  its  relationship  with  it.  The  two  countries  are  the  world’s
freedom  protected  by
largest  democracies,  both  are  committed
representative  government,  and  share  common
free  flow  of
commerce,  in  fighting  terrorism, and  in  creating  a  strategically  stable  Asia.  However,
differences  over  India’s  nuclear  weapons  program  and  pace  of  economic  reform
exist.  There  are  also  concerns  about  India’s  relations  with  Iran,  including  their
increasing  cooperation  with the Iranian military.

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  admitted  to  using  marijuana  approximately  100  times  in  the  past  30
years. He testified that his latest use of marijuana was in July or August of 2019. Before
that  it  was  in  February  2019.  He  described  his  use  as  limited  social  use,  two  to  three
times  a  year,  such  as  when  he  went  to  a  concert.  Applicant  lives  in  a  state  where
marijuana is legal under state law. He purchased marijuana from legal dispensaries in

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 26 years old. He graduated from high school in 2011, and college in
2017, with a bachelor’s degree. He began working for a federal contactor in April 2017.
He has cohabitated since April 2017. (Item 3)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2017. In
it he disclosed illegal drug use. Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator
in May 2018 and provided additional information about his illegal drug use. (Items 3, 4, 5)
Applicant used marijuana from June 2011 to February 2017. He primarily used it in
his home, but also socially with college friends. It made him feel like he was having an
“out-of-body” experience. He used it about 1,000 times. (Items 3, 4, 5)
Applicant disclosed that he used Ecstasy from June 2012 to November 2015, on
about 19 occasions. He was introduced to it by a friend and felt peer pressure to try it. He
agreed to do so. He did not consider it a bad experience and continued to use it quarterly
at music festivals. Except for his first use, where his friend gave him the drug for free, he
reimbursed the people who sold him the drug.1 (Items 3, 4, 5)
Applicant  used  Psilocybin  Mushrooms  on  about  four  occasions  from  November
2011  to  March  2015.  Each  use  was  at  his  apartment  with  a  friend.  It  made  him  feel
introspective. He considered his use random and experimental. He never purchased it.
His friend would bring it to him. (Items 3, 4, 5)
Applicant used LSD once in March 2013, with a friend. His friend supplied the drug.
Applicant had minor hallucinations, and said his use was experimental. (Items 3, 4, 5)
Applicant  also  disclosed  that  from  December  2012  to  December  2016,  he
purchased marijuana, usually from a friend, on a monthly basis. He noted that this was
the only way for him to obtain the drug. (Items 3, 4, 5)

continuing to use illegal drugs and does not want to risk losing his job or being arrested.
He stated he has never been dependent on any illegal drugs. He has never tested positive
for illegal drugs. He did not indicate how many drug tests he may have taken and if they
were randomly given. Applicant also stated that he has never felt addicted to any illegal
drug and has never received any form of counseling or treatment for using illegal drugs.
(Items 3, 4, 5)
In his SCA, Applicant stated:
Marijuana was used voluntarily and with variable frequency over the time
period  listed  above.  At  some  periods,  marijuana  was  frequently  used,  at
other periods, only occasional use. Additionally there were many periods of
abstinence (ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months) during the time frame listed
above. These periods of abstinence were all voluntary and for the purpose
of not developing a habit of use (retaining control). At no point during the
time period listed, was any treatment advised or signs of addiction present.
Use  was  for  enjoyment  with  peers  (similar  to  the  widely  accepted  use  of
alcohol) and periods of abstinence were attained with ease. (Item 4)
He further stated in the SCA the following:
It  should  be  noted  that  all  of  the  above  use  was  voluntary,  purely  for
personal enjoyment, and never once were any addictive or withdrawal signs
present. Use was never under persuasion or coercion. Motivation for use
was to increase quality of life by attaining differing perspectives. It has been
stated,  for  each  substance,  the  intent  to  permanently  discontinue  use.
Additionally, use was during very experimental period in life (college) and
no  such  use  has  occurred  since  leaving  that  environment.  Also  that  no
problems (financial, legal, mental, health, etc.) has ever occurred during any
use nor did use interfere with any aspects of life (school, job, social, etc.).

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR, except SOR ¶
1.d, which alleged that Applicant intended “to continue using marijuana in the future.” I
adopt  his  admissions  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  32  years old.  He  is  single,  never  married,  with  no  children.  He  has
worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since May 2008. He received his
bachelor’s degree in 2008. (Item 2)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from
approximately  June  2002  to  July  2018;  that  he  purchased  marijuana  during  the  same
timeframe; that he used marijuana from July 2017 to July 2018, while granted access to
classified  information;  and  that  he  intended  to  continue  using  marijuana  in  the  future.
(SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d)  The  SOR  also  cross-alleged  the  same  conduct  under  Guideline  E,
personal conduct. (SOR ¶ 2.a)
Applicant  listed  his  marijuana  use  in  his  security  clearance  application  (SCA)
completed  in  March  2017.  He  described  this  use  from  June  2002  to  February  2015.
During college, he used approximately three to five times a week; from 2009 to 2013, he
used three to five times a month; in 2014, he used four to six times; and he claimed he
last  used  in  February  2015.  During  his  background  investigation  interview  in  August
2018,  he  described  two  uses  in  October  2017;  two  unspecified  times  of  use;  and  his
claimed  last  use  in  August  2018.  He  also  admitted  that  he  would  continue  using
marijuana  recreationally  unless  he  is  required  to  stop.  He  continues  to  associate  with
friends  who  use  marijuana.  He  purchased  marijuana  from  local  dispensaries.  He  has
not participated in drug treatment or counseling. (Items 2-3)
In  Applicant’s  SOR  answer,  he  admitted  using  marijuana  while  being  granted
access to classified information. He also modified his response regarding his future use
of marijuana. He further stated he will only use marijuana in the future when it becomes
legal under federal law and-or it becomes necessary and prescribed by a physician. He
then further qualified this answer by saying that he would abstain from marijuana use as
long  as  it  was  prohibited  under  the  Guidelines.  Responding  to  the  Guideline  E
allegation, Applicant admitted his questionable judgment by using marijuana, but stated
that  he  was  ignorant  about  the  difference  between  federal  law  and  state  law  (where
marijuana  use  is  legal).  He  also  pointed  out  that  he  was  candid  and  honest  about  his
marijuana use. (SOR answer)
",False
"Unless  otherwise  indicated  by  citation  to  another  part  of  the  record,  I  have
extracted these findings of fact from Applicant’s SOR answer (Item 2) and eQIP (Item 3).
Applicant,  age  39,  is  unmarried  without  children.  He  received  his  high  school
diploma  in  1998  and  bachelor’s  degree  in  2017.  He  has  been  employed  as  an
administrator by a medical benefits provider since 2014. This is his first application for a
position of trust.
The SOR alleged, under Guidelines H and E, Applicant’s use of marijuana from
May 2002 through present, and his intent to continue using it in the future. It also alleged
that  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while  intoxicated  and  possession  of
marijuana  in  November 2012.  Under Guideline E,  the SOR alleged  that  Applicant  was
arrested and charged with arson in May 2004. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted to
each of the Guideline H and E allegations.
Applicant has smoked marijuana daily since May 2002.  In one eQIP answer, he
acknowledged  that  his  use  was  recreational.  However,  in  another  eQIP  answer  and
throughout  the  rest  of  the  record,  he  maintained  that  his  use  was  medicinal  for  the
purpose of addressing sleep issues caused by another prescribed medication that he is
required  to  take for an  ongoing  medical condition.  He  obtained a state-issued medical
marijuana card in March 2017 for that purpose. The card expired in April 2019. A copy of
that card is not in record. Before being issued the card, Applicant purchased marijuana
illegally  from  an  associate.  He  has  friends  who  use  marijuana,  but  he  does  not  know
whether they also have state-issued cards. He intends to continue using marijuana. (AE
A; Item 2; Item 3 at 32; Item 4 at 9).
In  2012, Applicant  did  not feel impaired and  believed  that  he  was  okay  to  drive
after consuming  alcohol.  The facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  his consumption of
alcohol or whether he used marijuana prior to driving are not specified in the record. The
officer who pulled him over for a broken headlight noticed that Applicant’s eyes were red
and gave him a breathalyzer, which registered a blood alcohol content of .10%. The officer
also found marijuana in Applicant’s backpack, which was undisputed in the record.  He
was arrested and charged with driving under the influence and possession of marijuana.
In 2013, he pled guilty to one lesser charge of operating while impaired, and the two initial
charges were dismissed. He was sentenced to 93 days in jail (suspended), probation for
12  months,  and  fined  $1,945.  Applicant  completed  the  terms  of  his  sentence,  which
included  mental  health  counseling  and  50  hours  of  community  service.  Neither  a
diagnosis nor prognosis stemming from that counseling was specified in the record. (Item
2 at 27-29; Item 4 at 7-8; Item 5).
Applicant leased a vehicle in his name for the benefit of his then boyfriend. After
they broke up, Applicant no longer wanted the vehicle because it reminded him of his ex-
boyfriend.  In  late  2001,  he  conspired  with  another  friend’s  boyfriend  (X)  to  commit
insurance fraud.  X agreed to steal the  vehicle and set it on fire, while Applicant would
report  the  vehicle  stolen  and  file  an  insurance  claim.  Although  Applicant  regretted  his
actions and realized his “grave mistake” immediately upon receiving notice from the police
station of the theft and arson, he proceeded with the plan anyway because he was “scared
of  the  consequences.”  In  late  2003,  a  detective  contacted  Applicant  to  advise  him  to
obtain an attorney because X, who was in prison for another crime, had confessed to his
conspiracy with Applicant. Applicant was charged with felony insurance fraud, to which
he pled guilty. In mid-2004, the court placed him in a diversion program, consisting of 12
months of probation, five days of community service, and $16,000 restitution. Applicant
successfully completed the program. (Item 2; Item 3 at 30-31; Item 4 at 8-9).
Applicant’s marijuana use never negatively  impacted  his  work performance.  His
current employer promoted him three times. Applicant acknowledged the “grave error” of
his  decision  to  commit  insurance  fraud.  He  attributed  that  decision  to  being  “very
immature” and “very young and stupid.” He described his 2001-self as a “naïve” 22 year
old, who was “stuck” paying for a car that he could not afford after his then boyfriend had
“talked [him] into leasing it” for him. He understood then, and now, that what he did was
“terribly wrong” and was “happy to face the consequences so that [his] conscience would
be clear.” He is now a “grown man” who is “responsible” and has “built a career.” He has
no intention of participating in insurance fraud or any criminal activities in the future. (AE
A; Item 2; Item 4 at 5-6, and 9).
Applicant acknowledged that his marijuana use and insurance fraud “could make
one question [his] moral character,” but argued that a “whole-person assessment” would
reveal that those actions “have not determined the course of [his] life” and that he is “by-
and-large a law-abiding, upstanding citizen.” He also stated the following with regard to
his marijuana use: “I understand the denial of my application for [a position of trust] since
marijuana is still a federally illegally drug.” (AE A).

"Applicant is a 32-year-old aircraft electronics maintenance technician, employed
by a government contractor since April 2019. He graduated from high school in 2005, and
completed some college credits. He is unmarried, and has two children (ages three and
seven  years old),  one of  whom  lives  with  him. Applicant  stated  he  has held  a  security
clearance since 2007 while employed by other government contractors.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  H  that  in  October  2016,  Applicant  used  and
tested positive for methamphetamine while cleared for access to classified information.
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges a mortgage foreclosure in 2016; a state child support
arrearage of $14,651; and four other collection accounts totaling over $4,000. Applicant
admitted the SOR allegations.
In October 2016, Applicant resigned from a position as a government contractor,
stating in his SCA that “it got real political” and “I was unhappy, was time to find something
new.”  (GE  1)  In  his  personal  subject  interview,  Applicant  claimed  he  left  the  position
because the “contract changed three times in the six years he was there,” and he denied
that drug use while possessing a security clearance was the cause. (GE 2) However, in
testimony, Applicant admitted that he was going to be fired from his employment for failure
to take a random urinalysis test. He claimed that he could not provide a sufficient amount
of urine for the test, and it would be considered a failure to comply. He decided to resign
to avoid a “false positive” test and resulting termination. (Tr. 38-40) He claimed it would
be a “false positive,” because his inability to provide a sample would be considered the
same as a positive test. He remained unemployed from October 2016 to December 2016,
and lived using money withdrawn from a 401(k) retirement plan and help from his parents.
(GE 2)
Applicant claims that after he resigned from his job, he and his live-in girlfriend, the
mother of his second child, attended a party where he smoked crystal methamphetamine
with her. He stated in his personal subject interview (PSI)  that he used the illegal drug
because  he  was  “leaving”  his  job,  was  behind  on  his  mortgage  and  threatened  with
foreclosure, and was paying child support arranges. He rationalized his surrender to peer
pressure by declaring “why not, what else do I have to lose.” (GE 2) The following day,
Applicant argued with his girlfriend over finances. She reported his drug use the previous
evening to her ex-husband, who in turn reported it to the state Child Protective Services
(CPS). CPS investigators removed his child from the home, and requested Applicant and
his girlfriend submit to a drug test. Applicant refused, but his girlfriend tested positive for
methamphetamine. The following day, Applicant submitted a sample, which also tested
positive for methamphetamine. Of note, in response to the Government’s amended SOR
allegation  adding  Applicant’s  October  2016  positive  drug  test,  Applicant  admitted  the
allegation but inexplicably claimed in his Answer that there is “no evidence or proof of
this,” despite admitting to a positive drug test in his SCA. (Amended SOR Answer and
GE 1) Applicant admitted that he never weighed the risks of his one-time drug use, and
that  it  resulted  in unexpected  and disastrous  consequences.  He  vowed  to  refrain from
further illegal drug use.
Applicant  appeared  in  court  for  a  custody  hearing,  and  was  ordered  to  attend
counseling and submit to weekly drug tests for one year. (GE 1) Applicant continued to
cohabit with his girlfriend until at least May 2017 when he completed his SCA. (GE 1) He
completed a year of negative drug tests and family counseling, and was able to recover
custody of his child. He claimed that some of the counseling included drug abuse issues.
In  October 2016,  Applicant  was  cited  by  state  police for  misdemeanor failure to
register a vehicle. He was required to appear in court, but  he claimed that because he
received  notice  of  his child-support arrearage,  lost  his job,  his child,  and  was  about to
lose his home, he forgot about the citation. A warrant was issued for his arrest. A similar
incident occurred in December 2016, and a second warrant was issued. Applicant finally
registered his vehicle in February 2017, and in September 2017, borrowed money from
his parents to pay a $1,200 fine for the citations. These events were not alleged in the
SOR. (GE 2)
Applicant  claimed  that  his  mortgage  became  delinquent  after  he  left  his
employment in October 2016, however he testified that the mortgage account was current
to November 2016. Of note, his credit report shows the last activity on the account was
in  June  2016.  (GE3) He  noted  in  his  PSI  that  he  was  too  embarrassed  to  contact  the
creditor and did not have the funds to pay the mortgage and his child-support obligations,
so he allowed the mortgage to go into foreclosure. In testimony, he claimed that he tried
to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but he did not have the requisite income. He also claimed
that he tried to refinance the mortgage, but he did not qualify. There is no evidence of a
deficiency balance owed.
Applicant testified that his child-support obligation began with a judgment in June
2015, and continued unpaid until September 2016 when his pay was garnished and his
tax  refunds  were  seized.  Applicant  has  been  making  regular  monthly  payments  since
September 2016. As of August 2019, he was in arrears for child support totaling $11,804,
and owed a total of $13,213.
Applicant owes a debt to a phone company that has been placed in collection for
$1,412. (SOR ¶ 2.c) He testified that he disagreed with the amount of the debt and was
told by the company that it would be adjusted, but it was not. He eventually agreed with
the collection agent to pay, but he has not done so. The debt remains unpaid. Applicant
owes medical debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 2.d and 2.e. He testified that he has not investigated
the debts nor has he resolved them. Finally, Applicant owes a bank for overdraft charges
and  penalties  incurred  in  early  2017.  The  debt  has  been  placed  in  collection,  and
Applicant had not resolved it. He also testified that he is currently behind on his internet
service  account,  and  has  about  $200  to  $300  in  available  cash.  In  2016,  he  withdrew
about  $14,000  to  $15,000  from  his  401(k)  retirement  plan.  He  has  not  had  credit
counseling.
Applicant provided several character letters from his case worker, coworkers and
friends.  They  generally  attest  to  his  work  ethic,  honesty  and  trustworthiness.  His  case
worker  noted  Applicant’s  behavioral  changes  after  participating  in  services  and
completing a parenting course.

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  both  of  the  factual  allegations
pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse of the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.);
as well as the two factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR  ¶¶ 2.a. and
2.b.). Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,
I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 66-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a senior cyber security specialist with his current employer since February 2011. He
previously served as a software engineer with two different defense contractors from May
1993  until February  2002,  and from  November 2008  until January  2011.    A  1970  high
school  graduate,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1974,  and  although  he
subsequently earned additional college credits, he has not received any other advanced
degrees.  He  has  never  served  with  the  U.S.  military.  He  was  initially  granted  a  secret
clearance in August 1979, and that clearance was periodically renewed. Applicant was
married  in  1980  and  divorced  in  1984.  He  remarried  in  2001  and  divorced  in  2002  or
2003. He has been residing with a cohabitant in a “civil marriage, legally recognized civil
union, or legally recognized domestic partnership” since 2018. He has no children.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  was  a  recreational  substance abuser  whose  substance of  choice  was
marijuana. His initial period of such drug involvement and substance misuse commenced
in about June 1979 – a few months before he was granted a security clearance  – and
continued  until  about  June  1981,  well  into  the  period  in  which  he  held  the  security
clearance. He acknowledged that he smoked marijuana on approximately 25 occasions.
Although he was in his mid-to-late 20s at the time, Applicant referred to his behavior as
“youthful indiscretion” with “perhaps a little too much appetite for adventure.” The record
is silent regarding how he obtained the marijuana, or if he paid for it. Applicant does not
remember with whom he smoked the marijuana or where he smoked it. He acknowledged
that he never received drug counseling or treatment, and he denied that his marijuana
use  caused  him  any  financial,  criminal,  or  security  issues.  There  is  no  indication  that
Applicant ever informed his employer that he was using marijuana during the period of
his use, and he has acknowledged that no one was aware of it. (Item 3, at 5-6; Item 1)
In December 2017, Applicant attended a funeral for a “beloved old friend” with old
friends  that  he  had  known  since  college,  but  whose  names  he  could  not  reveal.  As  a
“special one-time event,” Applicant participated in what he referred to as a  “ceremonial
partaking,” during which he smoked marijuana. (Item 3, at 5; Item 1) He acknowledged
that he never received drug counseling or treatment, and he denied that his marijuana
use  caused him any  financial,  criminal, or security  issues.  Applicant  did not  inform  his
employer that he had used marijuana in December 2017.
Applicant  contended  that  he  outgrew  his  marijuana-using  behavior  “a  long  time
ago,” and  that,  with  the  exception  of  the  ceremonial partaking  in  2017,  he  has  had  no
desire or intention to use any controlled substance in the future. He is willing to submit to
testing to prove that he will no longer use any controlled substances. (AE 1)
Personal Conduct
On April 5, 2010, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he responded to certain
questions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23. The
most  significant  question,  and the one  alleged  in  the SOR,  was  essentially  as follows:
“Have  you  ever  illegally  used  a  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security
clearance. . . ?” Applicant answered “no” to the question. (Item 4, at 45) He omitted and
concealed his subsequently admitted use of marijuana that started before he received his
security clearance and continued until June 1981. He certified that his response to that
question was “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief, but,
because  of  his omission  and  concealment,  the  response  to  that  question  was,  in  fact,
false.
Applicant did not controvert the falsification allegation. In his Answer to the SOR,
Applicant submitted two responses to the allegation. He admitted deliberately failing to
disclose  his  illegal  drug  use  in  his  e-QIP.  In  another  section  of  his  Answer,  he
acknowledged that he answered the question untruthfully, and he could not understand
why he did so. His response “bothers [Applicant] personally and [he has] sincere regrets.”
(Item 1) He did not claim that he misinterpreted the question, or that he forgot his drug
involvement and substance misuse.
To his credit, when Applicant completed his most recent e-QIP in May 2018, he
acknowledged both his earlier marijuana use as well as his December 2017 marijuana
use. However, it appears that he sought to minimize both activities by claiming the initial
marijuana  use  occurred  many  decades  ago,  and  the  most  recent  use  was  merely  for
“ceremonial purposes.” (Item 2, at 47-48)
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 1997 and a master’s
degree in 2007. She married in 2014 and has no children. She has worked for a federal
contractor since 2004. She was granted a secret clearance in 2013, and access to special
programs from January 2016 to March 2016.
Applicant completed a security clearance application in September 2013. In it she
reported  that  in  the  past  seven  years she  had  not used any  illegal drugs  or controlled
substances. (Item 2)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she stated:
My personal conduct with being dishonest and falsifying information on my
Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  back  in
2013  is  unacceptable.  I  am  embarrassed  of  my  behavior  and  regret
continuing  to  misuse  illegal  drugs  especially  while  holding  a  security
clearance.  While  continuing  my  background  investigation  during  my
polygraph test, I felt a lot of guilt for falsifying information. I confessed to the
investigator  that  I  had  misused  illegal  drugs.  I  knew  that  my  dishonesty
would  likely  affect  my  clearance  investigation,  but  I  felt  relieved  the  truth
was out. I truly regret my attempts to conceal my past conduct as I noted
above I am very embarrassed and ashamed. (Item 1)
Applicant  disclosed  in  a  September  2017  SCA  that  she  used  marijuana  from
approximately 1993 to March 2016. She smoked it; ate it in brownies; and inhaled it as
second hand smoke when her husband was using it. She estimated from 1993 to 1997
she used it once biweekly; from 1998 to 2001, she used it about three times a week; from
2002 to 2005, she did not use marijuana; from 2006 to 2013, she did not use it more than
three times a week; and from 2013 to 2016, she used it not more than twice a week or
sometimes not at all. She did not use illegal drugs from 2002 to 2005, because she was
applying for jobs, like the one she currently has, with a defense contractor.
Applicant also disclosed that from 1999 to 2013 with varying frequency, she used
hallucinogenic mushrooms.  She  used  Ecstasy,  from  July  2001  to  February  2016,  with
varying frequency.
In her 2017 SCA, SOR answer, and response to the FORM, Applicant stated she
does not intend to use drugs in the future because they are illegal, and they could impact
her career and security clearance. (Items 1, 3, 4; AE A)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2018. She
told the investigator that she used marijuana by herself, with her husband in their home,
and occasionally with friends. The second hand marijuana smoke she inhaled was from
her  husband  smoking  marijuana  in  her  presence  in  their  home.  Her  husband  also
provided her drugs. She did not purchase illegal drugs. She told the investigator that she
did not disclose her drug use on her earlier SCA because she feared the repercussions
from her usage and that it would affect her reputation negatively. During an interview prior
to a polygraph, she said she felt guilty for providing false information and confessed to
her past illegal drug use (Items 1, 4).
Applicant told the government investigator that her spouse continues to use illegal
drugs, but has agreed to not use them in her presence or talk about illegal drugs with her.
She said her behavior is separate and independent of her husband’s conduct. She said
her drug use has had no negative physical effects on her and no effects on her personal
life or finances. It has had no negative effects on her ability to do her job or safeguard
information. She only used the drugs during personal time and not on the job. (Item 3)
In Applicant’s FORM response, she stated:
[M]any of the individuals that were around during the drug use, I no longer
associate with as there was a realization that these contacts were not going
to help improve my life or support my personal growth. It was better to avoid
them and focus on more important things in my life such as family and true
close friends. I fully understand that illegal drug use has only hindered me
and has affected my professional career by causing me to lose my security
clearance. The stress of this adjudication process has made me regret my
past  actions,  and  I  intend  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and
substance misuse. (AE A)
Applicant provided her performance ratings from 2008 to 2018. They are: meets
requirements;  exceeds  requirements;  highly  effective  contribution;  and  exceptional
contribution. (AE A)

"Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he works as a
director supervising 55 people. He is single, and has a Bachelor’s degree. He has worked
for  his  employer  since  2006,  and  is  seeking  to  retain  national  security  eligibility  for  a
security clearance in connection with his work with  the DoD. (Government Exhibit 1 at
Sections12 and 13A; Applicant Exhibits A and B; Tr. 39.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted allegations 1.a and 1.b under this
paragraph. He denied allegation 1.c.
1.a.  Applicant  used  marijuana  from  two  to  five  times  a  year  from  approximately
2000, when he was in college, until approximately April 2018. He used marijuana after
obtaining  a  security  clearance  in  2006.  He  stopped  using  marijuana  after  being
interviewed  about  his  drug  use  by  an  investigator  from  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM). Applicant stated that he used marijuana most recently in an attempt
to  relieve  work-related  stress.  He also admitted  that using  marijuana over such  a  long
period  while  being  employed  and  holding  a  security  clearance  was  a  poor  decision.
Applicant stated that his marijuana use was not at work, and that his use had no impact
on  his  work.  Finally,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  knew  his  use  of  marijuana  was  illegal
under Federal law during the entirety of his use, and under state law during most of his
use. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23, and Exhibit 2; Tr. 20-25, 28-30, 32.)
1.b.  Applicant  purchased  marijuana  from  a  dispensary  after  such  purchase
became  legal  in  his  state.  He  stated  that  he  was  confused  about  the  legality  of  such
purchase  under  Federal  law  at  the  time  he  made  it.  Applicant  testified  that  he  only
purchased marijuana this one time. This single purchase has no security significance. (Tr.
30-31.)
1.c. Applicant denied that he intended to continue to use marijuana in the future.
In  his  interview  with  an  OPM  investigator  on  April  30,  2018,  Applicant  stated  that  he
intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  In  his  signed  and  notarized  Answer  Applicant
stated,  “I  am  retracting  this  previous  response  and  formally  declaring  there  will  be  no
intended  illegal  use  of  a  controlled  substance  (including  marijuana)  in  the  future.”
(Answer; Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 31, 40-42.)
Applicant testified that nobody at his place of employment knew about his hearing.
He further testified that he did not tell them because he would have been embarrassed.
(Tr. 38-39.)
Applicant  further  testified  that  his  employer  has  a  drug-free  workplace  policy,
including  marijuana.  He  further  testified  that  as  a  manager  he  has  attended  briefings
about what to do if he suspects one of his subordinates is using drugs at the workplace.

"Applicant is 39 years old. He is an employee of a defense contractor. He is single
and has no children. He attended college for approximately three years but he has not
obtained  an  undergraduate  degree.  He  has  obtained  many  certifications  during  his  17
year career. (AE B, C) He has not served in the military. He has held a security clearance
since  September  2016.  (Tr.  26)  He  has  been  employed  with  his  current  employer  for
about three years. (Tr. 26) Applicant acknowledged that he was briefed regarding the use
of illegal drugs at his various employments. (Tr. 81)
Drug Involvement
Applicant admitted that he used marijuana infrequently over the course of August
2000 through July 2018 in his 2018 SCA (SOR 1.a) He obtained a public trust clearance
sometime in 2016. (GE 1) He was aware of the policy of zero tolerance for drug use.  He
testified that he used marijuana in college but he noted that it was infrequently. (Tr. 37)
He reports his last use was in July 2018 which was on his birthday. (GE 4) He described
the  circumstances  involving  the  use  of  marijuana.    He  was  at  a  party  and  a  joint  was
passed around and he took a “puff.” (Tr. 39) He has never tested positive for a drug test.
He signed a letter of intent not to use any illegal drug in the future on October 2, 2019.
(AE  F)  He  states  that he  does  not  associate  with  the people  with whom  he  previously
smoked marijuana.
However, in his answer to the SOR, he denied the use of marijuana in SOR 1.a
and  1.b.  He  stated  that  the  date  should  have  been  July  2016  not  July  2018,  in
contradiction to his disclosure in 2018 SCA. At the hearing, he states that it was 2018 for
his last use of marijuana. (Tr. 84) He admitted that his denial in his answer was incorrect.
(Tr. 86) He stated that he was just nervous. In his investigative interview he stated that
he could not remember the exact number of times he partook of marijuana while holding
a security clearance. (GE 4)
Applicant  admits  that  he  was  arrested  in  October  2012  for  possession  of
marijuana-misdemeanor (less than an ounce at a concert). (GE 1, 2) He reports that a
joint was passed to him and he took a puff. (Tr. 73) He did not purchase the marijuana.
This case was dismissed after completion of 40 hours of community service and is now
expunged. (SOR 1.c) Applicant testified at the hearing that his next use was in 2015, not
2016. (Tr. 83) He stated that he was in a music studio and an associate passed a joint to
him. (Tr.83) At that time, he was working for a contractor, he knew the use of marijuana
was  against  federal  law.  (Tr.  84,  92)  He  disclosed  the  October  2012  arrest  in  his  July
2018 SCA. (SOR 1.c) He admits that this was after his eligibility for a public trust position.
In June 2019, Applicant sought the guidance of a psychologist after receiving the
SOR.  A  report  reflects  that  Applicant  attends  bi-weekly  sessions.  The  report  does  not
note  any  assessments  that  were  given  other  than  stating  that  he  is  amicable  and  his
character is nothing short of a psychological profile that any institution would foster the
opportunity to hire. (AE D) The psychologist directed Applicant to take four drug tests,
which were negative. (AE E) Applicant stated that the doctor did not provide a diagnosis
or  provide  any  treatment  recommendations.  The  psychologist  did  not  give  any
assessments according to Applicant and did not review the SOR. (Tr.110)
Applicant  reports that he  is a mature man  and  accepts the  responsibility  for his
conduct,  and  is  remorseful.  He  explained  that  he  would  never  jeopardize  the  United
States regarding classified information. He just made a mistake. He also explained that
since the drug was being decriminalized in D.C, this may have influenced his last use.
Applicant  submitted  five  letters  of  recommendation.  Each  letter  attests  to  his
honesty  and  trustworthiness.  His  college  friend,  a  colleague  and  a  minister  praise
Applicant  for  his  professionalism,  work  ethic  and  good  judgment.  The  letters  describe
Applicant as a good worker and a good man. (AE J) He also submitted his performance
evaluations which laud his performance. None of the persons who wrote the character
letters appear to know about the marijuana use.

"Applicant,  age  26,  has  cohabited  with  her  fiancé  since  November  2013.  She
earned a bachelor’s degree in 2016. She has been employed by a defense contractor as
an  assistant  scientist  since  August  2018.  This  is  her  first  application  for  a  security
clearance.
Applicant used marijuana daily from December 2012 through August 2018.  She
either smoked it or consumed marijuana concentrates in her home. She described her
use  as  both  “medicinal  (not  prescribed)”  and  “recreational.”  She  maintained  that
marijuana  helped  her  with  “sleep,  appetite,  and  various  pains  such  as  headaches,
stomach aches, and muscle pains.” (Item 2 at 33-34; Item 3 at 8)
Applicant understands that marijuana use is not compatible with holding a security
clearance. However, her intent regarding future marijuana use changed during the course
of  the  security-clearance  investigations  process.  In  her  September  2018  SCA,  she
answered “Yes” to whether she intended to use marijuana in the future and explained:
“When I no longer have a job that requires a security clearance or a job that is involved
in  public  safety,  and  if  I  move  to  a  legalized  recreational  state,  I  will  probably  resume
usage.”  She  reiterated  that  response  during  her  November  2018  security-clearance
interview (SI). However, in her April 2019 response to Government-issued interrogatories
(Interrogatory Response), she “emphatically” asserted that she no longer intended to use
marijuana in the future due to the “many improvements” she experienced in her “quality
of life” during the seven months that she had then abstained from marijuana. She reported
“improved memory and concentration, improved coordination, more motivation, and more
willing [sic] to take on responsibility [sic] at work and in the home.” She stated that she
was “committed to taking any type of drug screening as often as needed.” The record did
not specify any drug-screening results. (Item 2 at 33-34; Item 3 at 4 and 5)
Applicant primarily obtained the marijuana that she used from her fiancé (also a
marijuana user), who bought it from his friends. Once she stopped using marijuana, her
fiancé continued to use marijuana, but agreed to cease using it in their home or in her
presence. In December 2018, her fiancé obtained a prescription for medical marijuana
use and a state-issued medical marijuana use registry identification card. Before that, his
marijuana use was not prescribed. (Item 3 at 4-5)
Applicant was required to list three people “who know [her] well” on her SCA. She
described one such individual as a friend and former work associate (Friend). During her
November 2018 SI, Applicant revealed that she sold her fiancé’s marijuana concentrate
to Friend three to five times in 2017. On these occasions, she gave her fiancé the money
she received from Friend, who then gave it to a third party. She agreed to sell to Friend
because he was “a friend who would provide her marijuana,” and was unable to acquire
any  on  his  own  at  the  time.  She  acknowledged  only  one  occasion  in  2017  when  she
bought marijuana from Friend. Applicant does not intend to either buy or sell marijuana in
the future. (Item 2 at 16 and 22; Item 3 at 4-6)
Applicant  identified  two  of  her  fiancé’s  friends  with  whom  she  had  previously
smoked marijuana. She did not specify whether these were the same friends from whom
her  fiancé  bought  marijuana.  As  of  November  2018,  she  had  stopped  socializing  “in
person” with them while they were using marijuana, but continued socializing “online” with
them for the purpose of playing video games. In April 2019, she maintained that she had
“cut all forms of contact/not met up with” them or Friend, except for an exchange she had
with Friend about a job opportunity. That exchange did not take place in person. (Item 3

by a defense contractor since 2014. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant was granted DOD security clearances in 1983 and 2016. He maintained
an interim clearance during the adjudication of the background investigation initiated by
SCA 1, which began in March 2016 and concluded in September 2016. In October 2016,
the  DOD  CAF  granted  him  a  final  clearance  after  concluding  that  he  mitigated  the
personal conduct, financial considerations, and criminal conduct concerns raised by SCA
1.  In  February  2017,  the  DOD  CAF  requested  that  Applicant  complete  SCA  2  in
connection  with  its  investigation  focused  on  the  concerns  raised  by  a  January  2017
incident report about an October 2016 driving under the influence (DUI) charge. Applicant
submitted SCA 2 in April 2017. That investigation, which concluded in December 2018,
resulted in the SOR, which was referred to this office for final adjudication. (Item 2 at 35;
Item 3 at 38-39; Item 5 at 6-7; Items 6 and 7)
The  SOR  alleged  Guideline  H  and  E  concerns  involving  Applicant’s  use  of
marijuana and other illegal drugs, including while he served in the Marine Corps and also
while he possessed a security clearance. It also alleged Guideline E concerns involving
Applicant’s  deliberate  SCA  falsifications,  excessive  alcohol  consumption,  and  a  2012
assault charge.
Applicant’s marijuana use began in 1974 at age 15. He used it three times during
high school. He began smoking marijuana on a daily basis when he joined the  Marine
Corps in 1977 at age 18. His marijuana use continued through at least February 24, 2017
at age 57 (except for one six-month period of abstinence noted below). The amount of
his daily marijuana consumption varied over those years, as follows: 1) five to six joints
(1977 through 1979); 2) a “couple of hits” (1979 through 1980), which was during a time
when his marijuana supply was limited while stationed overseas; 3) five to six joints (1980
through 1981); 4) three to four joints (1981 through 1995); 5) two joints (1995 through
2012);  and  5)  four  to  five  joints  (2012  through  February  2017).  Between  1977  and
February  2017,  he  had  abstained  from  his  daily  marijuana  use  only  one  time:  an
unspecified period of six months sometime during his marriage (between 1980 and 1987),
when  his  then  wife  dared  him  to  stop.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  purchased
marijuana from unspecified friends, but denied ever selling it. (Item 2 at 24; Item 4 at 5,
16, 18)
Applicant used other illegal drugs at various times. In 1978 at age 19, he consumed
amphetamines twice: by taking a methamphetamine (speed) pill once, and by smoking
crystal methamphetamine once. He consumed lysergic acid diethylamide (acid) on four
occasions in 1979 at age 20, and then one time in 1995 at age 36. Between 1979 (age
20) and 2006 (age 37), he used cocaine six times. In 2012 at age 53, he tried heroin on
one occasion to see what it was about since his girlfriend was abusing it at the time. (Item
4 at 16; Item 5 at 8)
In 2012, Applicant kneed his girlfriend in the back for which he was charged with
felony assault with a dangerous weapon. After he pled guilty to the reduced charge of
misdemeanor simple assault, he was sentenced to one year of probation and fined $600.
His girlfriend was also granted a one-year order of protection against him. He successfully
complied with the terms of his probation and the protective order. After the order expired,
he resumed the relationship with his girlfriend, which continued through at least August
2018. This is the same girlfriend from whom Applicant obtained heroin. (Item 2 at 30-32;
Item 3 at 30-32; Item 4 at 9, 16, 24, 25; Item 5 at 5)
In October 2016, Applicant drove under the influence of marijuana. After the police
officer  who  stopped  him  for  a  traffic  violation  smelled  marijuana  emanating  from
Applicant’s car, he was issued a field sobriety test, which he failed. The officer also found
the remains of four previously-smoked marijuana joints in the driver’s side door. Applicant
denied smoking marijuana while he was driving, but admitted that he had smoked it while
parked  in  his  car  three  hours  prior  to  driving.  His  blood  sample  tested  positive  for
marijuana.  He  was  arrested  and  spent  one  night  in  jail.  Applicant  pled  guilty  to
misdemeanor DUI of marijuana for which he was accepted into a first-time offenders pre-
trial intervention program, consisting of six months of probation and an $1,800 fine. His
driver’s license was suspended for two months. He was ordered to complete 24 hours of
community  service,  take  DUI  classes,  and  attend  drug  and  alcohol  treatment.  He
successfully  completed  the  program,  which  qualified  him  for  a  dismissal  of  the  DUI
charge. (Item 3 at 29, 32-33; Item 5 at 5-6)
Applicant’s  court-ordered  treatment  consisted  of  a  drug  and  alcohol  evaluation,
seven individual therapy sessions, and an unspecified number of group therapy sessions
that  he  attended  twice  per  week.  He  entered  the  program  on  March  3,  2017  with  a
diagnosis  of  cannabis  use  disorder,  severe  (based  on  DSM-5  criteria).  Applicant  was
discharged from treatment in October 2017, as planned, upon completion of his stated
goal: “I want to not use marijuana for at least the next 7 years until I retire.” His counselor
noted Applicant’s expressed intent to remain clean and sober and that, during the course
of  his  treatment,  he  was  an  active  participant  and  remained  highly  motivated.  The
treatment records reflected a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder, in early remission, at
discharge, but did not specify a prognosis from his counselor. Nor did they articulate a
specific aftercare plan beyond referring various resources for Applicant to use as needed.
(Item 4 at 1, 3, 4, 14, 20, 22, 29-44)
During his initial intake on March 3, 2017, Applicant tested positive for marijuana,
which Applicant acknowledged he had used seven days prior. He told his counselor that
he did not stop using marijuana after his DUI until the day he received an unspecified
letter  from  the  court  on  February  24,  2017,  because  he  really  enjoyed  marijuana.
According to treatment records,  Applicant reportedly abstained from drugs and alcohol
throughout the course of his treatment and passed each of the seven drug tests to which
he was subjected. However, beginning with his first treatment session on June 2, 2017
and  continuing  through  the  last  one  on  September  22,  2017,  he  reported  his  last
marijuana use as March 16, 2017, which together with other record evidence (discussed
below) reveals that he used marijuana at least once during the interim period between his
initial intake on March 3, 2017 and the day his treatment began on June 2, 2017. There
is no record evidence that Applicant was subjected to any drug testing during that interim
period or to explain the reason for the delay in him commencing treatment after intake.
(Item 4 at 13, 16, 29-44)
During his initial intake, Applicant revealed that he routinely smoked marijuana in
his car while  driving.  His  stated triggers for marijuana  use  relapse  included  stress, his
bandmates,  and  playing  gigs.  He  reported  that  he  regularly  drove  under  the  influence
after consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. He acknowledged that, on each occasion
that  he  chose  to  drive,  he  knew  he  should  not  have  been  driving  because  he  was
“hammered.” (Item 1 at 5, 8; Item 4 at 16-18)
Applicant  tested  positive  on  an  alcohol  screening  test  administered  during
treatment,  which  raised  concerns  about  his  alcohol  use.  However,  Applicant  declined
referral for an alcohol-use assessment. He was advised to abstain from drinking alcohol
and to undergo an alcohol screening test annually. His counselor reviewed the specific
health  issues  and  risks  that  underscored  the  abstention  recommendation.  Applicant
reportedly abstained from alcohol use during treatment. (Item 4 at 1, 43-44)
During
the  security  clearance
investigations  process,  Applicant  was  not
forthcoming about his marijuana and other drug use. He answered “no” to each of the
questions in section 23 about illegal use of drugs or drug activity on SCA 1, and otherwise
failed to disclose therein his reportable marijuana use or that he used marijuana and other
illegal drugs while in possession of his 1983 security clearance. On SCA 2, he reported
the following in response to questions in section 23 about his marijuana use: 1) that he
only  used  marijuana  between  October  2016  and  March  2017,  including  while  he
possessed his 2016 security clearance; 2) that he purchased marijuana every 2 weeks
during that period; and 3) that he only smoked about two joints per day (to relieve stress
and boredom). However, he otherwise failed to disclose on SCA 2 his other reportable
marijuana use. (Item 2 at 33-34; Item 3 at 34-35)
Applicant was interviewed in August 2018 about SCA 1. There is no information in
the record to explain why SCA 2 was not also discussed. During the interview, Applicant
admitted  using  marijuana  “on  and  off  over  the  decades”  beginning  in  the  1970s.  He
asserted that his most recent use occurred between September 2016 and March 2017,
during which time he smoked at least one joint a day (about 3 grams per day), while he
possessed a security clearance. He averred that he “began smoking [marijuana] again”
in September 2016 because his friends were doing so, and that he stopped smoking it
after  his  court  date  in  March  2017.  He  did  not  enumerate  the  specific  day  during  the
interview. However, he did report the date as March 28, 2017 in SCA 2. (Item 3 at 30, 32;
Item 5 at 6)
Applicant maintained that he did not intentionally falsify SCA 1 and claimed that he
did not list his marijuana and other drug use on SCA 1 because: 1) his recent marijuana
use occurred after he completed SCA 1, 2) he had forgotten about his heroin use, and 3)
his other drug use occurred more than seven years prior. In April 2019, Applicant verified
the accuracy of the facts and circumstances he reported about his marijuana use during
the interview. (Item 5 at 6, 9, 11, and 12)
Applicant attributed his marijuana use primarily to stress, boredom, and being a
member in a band; and his other drug use to experimentation. Applicant has played in a
rock band since at least 1992. On SCA 1 and SCA 2, he identified three of his bandmates
as people who knew him well in section 16 and used two of them as references in other
sections.  He  acknowledged  that  his  bandmates  used  marijuana,  but  denied  being
tempted to use it himself when he is around them. (Item 2 at 7, 10, 22-23; Item 3 at 9, 20-
22, 35; Item 4 at 12, 17, 39; Item 5 at 6, 8-9)
As of August 2018, Applicant continued to associate with unspecified individuals
who use marijuana (because everyone he knows  uses it), but not with individuals who
use other illegal drugs. His girlfriend had actively sought help with her drug addiction and
was committed to a sober lifestyle. Applicant was regularly exposed to marijuana use, but
insisted that he was also committed to a sober lifestyle and had no future intent to resume
using marijuana because he did not want to lose his job. (Item 5 at 6 and 9)
SOR  ¶  1.f.  alleged  “You  have  routinely  used  marijuana  while  driving,”  to  which
Applicant answered: “I admit . . . I have routinely used marijuana while driving.”  SOR ¶
2.d alleged “As of your 2017 treatment . . . you were admittedly binge drinking and driving
about twice a month,” to which Applicant answered “I deny . . . I drink twice a month, not
always binge drinking, usually about 2 or 3, occasionally more. I do not drive until 3 hours
after  drinking  .  .  .”  In  the  closing  paragraph  of  Applicant’s  SOR  answer,  he  stated  the
following: “I admit to liking smoking marijuana occasionally” and “I dislike all other drugs.”
He did not explicitly address therein whether he had maintained his marijuana sobriety
since March 2017. (Item 1 at 5, 8)

"Applicant  is  38  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school,  has  various
certifications,  and  works  as  an  asbestos  worker.  He  is  twice  divorced,  remarried,  and
has  two  children.  He  has  been  employed  with  various  companies  since  approximately
2016. Applicant completed his latest security clearance application (SCA) on September
20, 2018. (GX 1)
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying
frequency,  from  about  May  2001  to  at  least  August  2018  (1.a);  and  that  he  tested
positive  for  marijuana  on  an  employer’s  urinalysis  test  in  June  2017  and  August  2018
(1.b). The SOR further cross alleges under Guideline E the drug use (2.a) and also that
Applicant  falsified  his  February  26,  2018  SCA  when  he  answered  “No”  to  Section  14:
Illegal Drugs in the last year (2.b). Applicant admitted the allegations under 1.a and 1.b,
denied 2.a and admitted 2.b.
Applicant testified that to be social he smoked marijuana with his friends. He had
no  idea  about  its  correlation  with  a  security  clearance.  (Tr. 16)  He  usually  would  drink
and smoke at the same time. He admits smoking at rugby tournaments with his friends
and at social banquets. (Tr. 18) He stated that if someone offered him a joint he was not
going to say no. However, Applicant stated that it is not a habit. His employer wants to
send  him  abroad  to  clean  asbestos  in  American  embassies  and  he  needs  a  security
clearance. His employer advised him to not smoke marijuana.
Applicant began smoking marijuana in 2001, when he came to the United States
at the age of 21. (Tr. 21) He also noted that he smoked in his home country in 1997.  He
noted that it made him high and that he partakes of a joint when it is offered to him.  He
has not purchased marijuana or sold it. Applicant acknowledged that his employer has a
drug  policy.  He  knows  it  is  illegal  to  smoke  marijuana.    Although,  he  referred  to  its
legality  in  some  states,  as  an  excuse  for  thinking  it  would  be  okay  to  smoke.  The
company tested Applicant in June 2017 and he failed the drug test. (Tr. 29) Applicant’s
employer  warned  him  that  he  would  not  get  a  clearance  if  he  continued  to  smoke
marijuana. (Tr. 32)
Applicant  failed  a  second  drug  test  in  August  2018.  (GX  4)  He  stated  that  he
probably had smoked about a month before at a rugby tournament. He was told to take
a drug test because he had hit a car with his large company van in a parking lot and did
not  leave  a  note.  (GX  3)    He  was  given  a  warning  from  his  employer.  Applicant
explained that after the second test, he tried to modify his behavior by not going to the
rugby  games  or the  dinners with  his friends.  (Tr. 35) He  believes  that  he  had  smoked
about five times from June 17, 2019 until 2018. (Tr.36) Applicant resigned from that job
in September 2018. (GX 4) He had been given various warnings for security violations.
Applicant completed a SCA in February 2018. He stated that he has a problem
with  writing  and  spelling  and  reading.  (Tr.  40)  He  admitted  that  he  answered  “No”  to
Section 14: Use of Illegal Drugs. In his answer, he stated that was a mistake and that it
should  have  been  a  “Yes.”  At  the  hearing,  he  elaborated  that  he  probably  read  the
question  wrong.  He  noticed  all  the  other  drugs  listed,  such  as  codeine,  hashish,
narcotics and the marijuana was not in his head. (Tr. 42) Applicant also stated that he
told the investigator during his 2018 interview about the failed drug tests. (Tr. 43) In his
September 20, 2018 SCA, he indicated that he had used marijuana. (GX 1)
Applicant  was  adamant  that  he  no  longer  smokes  marijuana,  but  he  goes  out
with his friends and does not stay away from marijuana but does not smoke it. (Tr. 47)
He then stated that he has not gone to a rugby game or a banquet in a year. He stated
that he does not miss smoking marijuana. He has never obtained any drug counseling.

employed  as  a  developmental  operations  engineer  with  his  current  employer  since
2016. Applicant was granted a security clearance by DOD in  2016. (Item 2)  Applicant
completed his security clearance application (SCA) in April 2017. He reports no military
service.
The SOR alleges that Applicant used mushrooms in about February 2017, while
granted  access  to  classified  information.  (SOR  1.a) It  also  alleges  that  Applicant  used
marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from  about  September  2012  to  about  April  2014.
(SOR  1.b)  (Item  1)  Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  under  guideline  H,  drug
involvement.
Applicant disclosed the information about his marijuana use on his 2017 SCA. He
smoked  in  college  in a  social  setting  with  friends.  He believed  it  was  about four  to  six
times, separated by months apart.  (Item 2) In that SCA, he noted that he no longer had
any interest in marijuana, it was experimental, and he is focused on his career.
In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  stated  that  he  used  the  mushrooms  because  the
supplier of the substance gave it to him. Applicant stated that it was in a “safe setting.”
He stated that he ingested between two and three grams of the substance. He believes
that this did not affect his ability to guard classified information. He further explained that
he was depressed at the time due to his grandfather’s death a month earlier. He stated
that  he  was  having  difficulty  grieving.  He  noted  that  he  made  a  poor  choice  that  he
otherwise  would  not  have  made.  He  explained  it  was  a  one-time  event  and  he
understood the repercussions after the incident. (Item 1, attachment)
Applicant  noted  that  he  occasionally  sees  the  supplier  of  the  mushrooms
because  he  is  part  of  his  group  of  friends.  However,  he  would  refuse  any  future
invitations  to  use  any  illegal  substance.  He  has  never  tested  positive  for  any  illegal
substance and he avoids environments where an illegal drug might be used to the best
of his ability.
During  Applicant’s  2018  OPM  interview,  he  disclosed  the  information  about  the
use  of  marijuana.  He  noted  that  “pot”  was  regularly  available  during  parties.  He
reiterated that he had no future intent to use marijuana. (Item 3)
As to the use of mushrooms, Applicant again noted that he was with a friend who
offered it to him.  He claims he used it because he was in a low place and it was a poor
choice.  (Item  3) Applicant  stated  that  it  had  no  effect  on  his  work  or  relationships  and
that he did report the use.
Applicant stated that he intends to continue to abstain from all substance misuse.
He has no police record concerning the use of illegal drugs.

"Applicant admitted that he illegally used marijuana between 2012 and September
2018. (SOR paragraph 1.a) He denied that he intends to continue to use marijuana in
the future. His admission is incorporated as a findings of fact. After a thorough review of
the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  24-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  received  his
bachelor’s  degree  in  2017.  He  has  never  married,  and  has  no  children.  He  has  been
working for his employer and clearance sponsor since he was hired in June 2017.
On June 8, 2017, Applicant submitted his first SCA. In his responses to Question
23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he
illegally purchased and used marijuana for himself and friends between December 2012
and  March  2015.  He  explained  that  he  used  marijuana  casually  and  typically  socially.
He described his use of marijuana as follows:
Usually  about  once  a  month  during  this  period,  never  more  than  twice  a
week.  Didn’t  begin  using  with  any  real  regularity  until  May-June  of  2013.
Roughly  around  50  times  total.  Typically  in  social  situations,  though
around the time October to November of 2014, alone as well. (Item 2)
Concerning his purchase of marijuana, Applicant stated that he never purchased
more than a half dozen times. When asked whether he intended to continue using the
illegal drug in the future he stated:
As one gets older, the drug simultaneously becomes less interesting and
the risks of use gets higher. I realized the benefits of use did not outweigh
the  risk,  and  the  continued  use  would  both  negatively  impact  my  health
and  functioning  as  well  as  eliminate  various  opportunities.  Furthermore,
while  I  am  still  in  contact  with  some  of  the  people  [with  whom]  I  used  to
smoke marijuana with, I almost never see them, and even if they were to
offer  me  some,  I  wouldn’t  want  to.  Once  you  stop  for  [a]  long  enough
period  of  time,  you  don’t’  feel  the  desire  to  use  anymore,  and  the  drug
feels like opening up a can of risks and difficulties for a very little reward. It
makes sense to put all of it in the rear view  mirror. It is not necessary to
live a fulfilling life, and can open yourself up to myriad of other problems.
(Item 2)
Applicant  also  disclosed
illegally  used  psilocybin  mushrooms
(mushrooms) four  times  between  February  2014 and  January  2015.  He  stated  that  he
did not intend to use mushrooms again, and provided the following explanation:
that  he
Not only does psilocybin usage associate itself with the same risks as any
illegal  drug  (interactions  with  criminals,  as  well  as  a  potential  career  and
legal penalties) but is not even strictly speaking enjoyable . . . . I decided
that  hallucinogens  were  not  going  to  provide  me  with  anything  other
depression  and  dread.  I  instead  turned  my  focus  to  school,  friends,  and
career. As with my cessation of marijuana use, I allowed those productive
pursuits to grow in the space drugs once occupied.
On September 17, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a background investigator
from the Office of Personal Management (OPM). He told the interviewer that he illegally
purchased  and  used  marijuana  between  January  and  September 2018,  approximately
twice per week - about 50 times during the timeframe. Applicant further stated that he
intended to continue to purchase and use marijuana in the future because it helped him
with his depression and loneliness. Applicant was uncomfortable providing the names of
those individuals associated with his illegal marijuana use. However, he disclosed that
he  uses  marijuana  with  his  current  girlfriend  in  his  apartment  and  purchases  the
marijuana from a dispensary. He stated that his use of marijuana  has occurred due to
his frustration with work. (Item 3)
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  denied  that  he  intends  to  use  marijuana  in  the
future.  He  stated:  “I  was  in  a  dark  space  when  I  began  using  marijuana  that  I  have
moved out. These experiences of being interviewed have shown me what I did wrong.”
Applicant disclosed in his responses to Section 21 (Psychological and Emotional
Health)  of  his  2017  SCA  that  he  was  admitted  as  an  inpatient  for  treatment  between
June 2015 and May 2017, but he did not explain the cause of his treatment, He did not

"Under Guideline  H,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant used marijuana  with
varying frequency between 1975 and at least November 2016 (SOR 1.a); and that she
used marijuana while on active duty in the U.S. Air Force between 1980 and 2000, and
while holding security clearances during and after her military service (SOR 1.b).
Under  Guideline  E,  it  was  alleged  that  Applicant  intentionally  made  false
statements to the Government in her January 2017 e-QIP by answering “No” to the e-QIP
Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) question asking if she had ever used
illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, as alleged in SOR 1.b (SOR 2.a).
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  1.a  and  1.b,  but  denied,  with
explanation, SOR 2.a. (FORM, Item 1) In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  62-year-old  employee  of a defense  contractor,  for whom  she  has
worked since January 2017. She was married from October 1974 until divorcing in May
1984, and she had two children, now adults, from that marriage. After receiving her high
school graduate equivalency degree in December 1979, Applicant joined the Air Force in
January 1980, where she served until retiring in January 2000. (FORM, Item 2)
Applicant held a security clearance while in the Air Force. She also held a security
clearance while working for a federal agency between November 2003 and March 2004,
and while working as a defense contractor in Afghanistan between March 2005 and July
2006. (FORM, Item 2)

and  2016.  She  used  marijuana  while  serving  on  active  duty  in  the  military  and  while
possessing security clearances for both government and federal contractor employment.
In a security clearance application submitted in July 2001, she did not disclose any prior
use of marijuana; however, in an August 2001 subject interview, Applicant stated that she
had used marijuana starting in 1975 and while serving in the Air Force. Applicant also has
undergone  treatment  and  counseling  for  mental  health  problems.  Treatment  records
show that she used marijuana at least in March 2010, July 2011, and September 2014.
When  Applicant  submitted  her  e-QIP  in  January  2017,  she  stated  that  she  only  used
marijuana four to six times a year between April 2009 and November 2016, and that she
purchased small amounts of marijuana in 2016 to use marijuana as a way to deal with
personal stress. In the same e-QIP, she answered “No” to the e-QIP Section 23 question
that asked if she had ever used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. (FORM,

U.S.  military.  He  was  granted  a  secret  clearance  in  2016,  and  he  is  currently  being
sponsored for a top secret clearance. Applicant has never been married, and he has no
children.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant was a recreational substance abuser whose primary substance of choice
was  marijuana,  but  he  also  used  cocaine,  and  a  prescribed  anxiety  medication  (the
prescription was for someone other than himself). In addition, although not alleged in the
SOR,  Applicant  also  used  mushrooms  and  an  unspecified  prescription  painkiller.  He
commenced  what  he  called  “semi-regular  use”  of  marijuana  in  July  2011,  and  he
continued using it periodically (anywhere from once or twice a month to 10 to 15 times
per  month)  with  friends  in  the  evenings  after  school or  on  weekends  while  consuming
alcohol in a party setting, or simply hanging out with friends at their home. He generally
smoked  marijuana  from  a  bowl.  Applicant’s  motivation  for  using  marijuana  was  to  be
social  and  have fun,  to  relieve  stress, and  to  relax  himself,  but he  later  realized  that  it
reduced his motivation levels and affected his performance. He intentionally sought out
parties where marijuana was being used. When his friends did not have any marijuana
for him, Applicant purchased marijuana for his personal use every other month from about
September 2012 until about June 2015. Applicant contends that he reduced his use of
marijuana in December 2015, and he last used marijuana in April 2017. (Item 3, at 27-29;
Item 5, at 6-9) During a portion of the period of Applicant’s marijuana use, he held a secret
clearance (December 2016 – April 2017). (Item 1; Answer to the SOR)
In  March  2015,  while  at  a  college  fraternity  event,  Applicant  was  offered  some
cocaine by a friend, and while in the friend’s car, Applicant snorted the cocaine. Applicant
acknowledged that he attended the event intentionally with the knowledge that he would
experiment  with  cocaine.  In  March  2017,  before  attending  a  concert  with  friends,
Applicant  and  some  friends  were  in  his  home  consuming  alcohol  to  the  point  of
intoxication. In addition, Applicant and at least one of his friends used cocaine. Applicant
had not initially intended to use cocaine that evening, but because he had used drugs
with the same person previously, he knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conduct.
(Item 3, at 28; Item 5, at 8) The most recent use of cocaine occurred while Applicant held
a security clearance. (Item 1; Answer to the SOR)
In December 2016, prior to taking a flight, because he was experiencing anxiety
about  flying,  Applicant  knowingly  and  voluntarily  took  two  pills  of  the  prescription
medication  Klonopin  –  used  to  treat  seizures,  panic  disorder,  and  anxiety  –  that  he
received  from  his  girlfriend.  The  prescription  was  not  for  Applicant.  (Item  5  at  9)
Applicant’s use of Klonopin occurred while he held a security clearance. (Answer to the
SOR)
Applicant has never received counseling or treatment as a result of his illegal use
of drugs or controlled substances. (Item 3, at 31) He acknowledged that his wrongful use
of  the  above  described  substances  occurred  during  a  period  of  his  life  when  he  was
essentially immature and reckless. He claims he eventually matured and stopped using
any illegal substances after April 2017, and that he has avoided his former drug-using
friends. (Item 5; Answer to the SOR)
Personal Conduct
On  June  23,  2016,  when  Applicant  completed  his  first  e-QIP,  he  responded  to
certain questions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23
–  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity.  The  most  significant  questions,  and  the  ones
alleged in the SOR, were essentially as follows: In the last seven (7) years: “have you
illegally used any drugs or controlled substances?”; “have you been involved in the illegal
purchase, manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving,
handling  or  sale  of  any  drug  or  controlled  substance?”;  and  “have  you  intentionally
engaged in the misuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not the drugs were
prescribed for you or someone else?” Applicant answered “no” to each of the questions.
(Item 4, at 25) He omitted and concealed his subsequently admitted use of marijuana and
cocaine. He certified that his responses to those two questions were “true, complete, and
correct”  to  the  best  of  his  knowledge  and  belief,  but,  because  of  his  omission  and
concealment, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false. As for the response
to the prescription-related question, since the e-QIP was completed in June 2016, and
the  alleged  misuse  of  the  prescription  did  not  occur  until  December  2016,  the  e-QIP
response was not false, despite Applicant’s erroneous admission.
To his credit, when applying for a top secret clearance, Applicant completed his
most recent e-QIP in August 2017, and he acknowledged his past drug involvement and
substance misuse. (Item 3, at 27-30)
",False
"The SOR alleges under Guideline  H that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency from about June 2010 to at least November 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a); that he used LSD
and hallucinogenic mushrooms with varying frequency from about January 2014 to at least
March 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.b); and that he used the prescription medications Adderall, Ritalin,
and Modafinil, which had not been prescribed for him, from about January 2016 to at least
April 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.c). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted
that he used the drugs as alleged. He explained that he used marijuana for its medicinal
benefits, including to relieve his anxiety and pain. Applicant denied any use of LSD and
hallucinogenic mushrooms since March 2017 and any abuse of non-prescribed prescription
drugs  since  April  2017.  He  expressed  in  writing  an  intention  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement  and  substance  misuse  with  an  acknowledgement  that  any  future  drug
involvement be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. After considering the
pleadings, exhibits, and transcripts, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 25-year-old data scientist. He earned his bachelor’s degree in May
2016  and  his  master’s  degree  in  May  2017.  He  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since June 2017. (GE 1.) He has never held a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 17-
19.)  Applicant  understands  that  he  does  not  need  a  clearance  to  keep  his  job,  but  a
clearance would allow him to apply his skill-set to some classified programs at work. (Tr.
21-22.)
Applicant  began  using  marijuana  in  June  2010  after  his  freshman  year  of  high
school. He used marijuana approximately once every two months in high school and during
his first year of college. From the fall of 2013 to 2015, during his sophomore and junior
years of college, he used marijuana once a week. He used marijuana daily from sometime
in  2015  through  April  2017.  Applicant  used  marijuana  to  decompress  from  academic
stress. He used marijuana at parties, with friends, and with housemates. He also used the
drug by himself. Applicant purchased marijuana on occasion, no more frequently than once
a month, from 2014 to 2017. He bought marijuana from persons he did not know and also
from and through friends. (GEs 1-2.)
Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms approximately three times and LSD about
five times between January 2014 and March 2017. He also used, without a prescription,
Adderall or Ritalin no more than 20 times total and Modafinil one time between January
2016 and April 2017. He obtained the stimulants from friends. (GE 1.)
After  graduate  school,  Applicant  stopped  using  illegal  drugs,  as  it  turns  out
temporarily, thinking that it was time to be “clear headed” for employment. In June 2017, he
began working for his current employer. He completed and certified to the accuracy of a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on June 29, 2017. In response to an
inquiry into whether he had illegally used any drug or controlled substance in the last seven
years, Applicant reported that he engaged in recreational marijuana use with “scattered”
frequency from June 2010 to 2015 and then daily through April 2017. He also disclosed his
use  of  LSD  and  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  between  January  2014  and  March  2017
“[r]ecreationally, motivated by studying the brain and once going to a music festival, highly
irregular.” Applicant denied any intention to use marijuana in the future, stating, “I intend to
keep a clear head throughout my professional adult life.” He also denied any intention of
future involvement with LSD or hallucinogenic mushrooms, stating, “My reasons for use
carry no more weight moving forward, rendering these drugs irrelevant and undesirable in
my life moving forward.” In answer to an inquiry concerning any illegal drug purchases in
the last seven years, Applicant reported that he had bought marijuana no more than once a
month  between  January  2014  and  February  2017,  explaining  that  “recreational use  of
marijuana required occasional purchase.” In response to an SF 86 question about any
intentional misuse of a prescription drug in the last seven years, Applicant listed his use of
Adderall, Ritalin, and Modafinil, which he obtained from friends. (GE 1.)
On November 16, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  used
marijuana with current and previous college roommates. He volunteered that he had used
marijuana on average once a day from November 2017 to November 3, 2018, with his
latest use occurring at a party. He denied that he ever used marijuana at the workplace,
but admitted that he had used marijuana in December 2017 and again in September 2018
while teleworking, in order to alleviate pain so he could get his work done. (Tr. 24.) He
admitted that his current employer was not aware of his marijuana use. Applicant likened
his marijuana use to having a drink. He expressed no intention to seek out marijuana in the
future, but he could not rule out recurrence. He asserted that he would be prepared to
abstain from marijuana if necessary for his clearance. As for his attitude toward marijuana,
Applicant explained that he had always used it for social, creative, or calming purposes,
and he did not think it was a big deal. He considered himself a “casual user” of marijuana.
He denied any other illegal drug use since 2017 and any interest in using hallucinogens or
non-prescribed stimulants in the future. (GE 2.)
On June 26, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a SOR to Applicant because of his drug
involvement and substance misuse. When he responded to the SOR on July 12, 2019,
Applicant  explained  that  his  marijuana  use  was  for  its  medicinal  benefits,  primarily  to
relieve anxiety and pain. He considered his use of the drug “innocuous” but regretful in that
it cast doubt on his ability to perform his job and be trusted with classified information. He
expressed  in  writing  his  intention  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance
misuse in the future, acknowledging that any future involvement would be grounds for
revocation of national security eligibility.  He denied any use of hallucinogenic drugs or
misuse of prescription drugs since 2017.
At his September 26, 2019 hearing, Applicant  reiterated that there had been no
recurrence of involvement with LSD or hallucinogenic mushrooms since March 2017 or any
misuse of prescription stimulants since April 2017. He asserted that such abuse would not
recur.  (Tr.  16-17.)  He  volunteered  that,  believing  he  would  not  be  granted  a  security
clearance because of his marijuana use, he continued to use marijuana since November
2018 “every other day perhaps,” including two to three times per week since July 12, 2019.
(Tr. 18-19, 26-27.) Most of that use was self-initiated and purchased by him to relieve
medical issues. He also used marijuana recreationally with his friends five or six times. (Tr.
31-32.) His most recent use of marijuana occurred at a party in mid-September 2019. (Tr.
24-25.) When asked to explain why he used marijuana after he had expressed in writing
that he would not use marijuana in the future, he responded, “Like I said, use of marijuana
has never affected my ability to perform my job, and I know that from experience.” (Tr. 23.)
He cited the relief that marijuana brings him in terms of mitigating his anxiety, depression,
and pain; described himself as “a guy who occasionally likes to smoke marijuana with his
friends;” but he also asserted a willingness and ability to stop using marijuana if it would
prevent him from being granted a security clearance. (Tr. 18-20.) Applicant testified that he
would very much like to contribute to the classified components of some of the programs in
which he is involved (Tr. 22), and that he does not need marijuana in his life. He expressed
confidence that he would never use marijuana again “subject to the possibility of getting a
security clearance.” (Tr. 28.) He expressed a willingness to undergo drug tests to prove
abstention. (Tr. 29, 35.)
Applicant has not had any drug counseling nor has he sought any medical treatment
for those issues that he self-medicates with marijuana (Tr. 25), although he acknowledged
that he should seek treatment for his anxiety and depression. (Tr. 31.) He does not suffer
from chronic pain, but has occasional discomfort that he treats with marijuana rather than
over-the-counter analgesics because the relief is more effective and immediate. (Tr. 25-
26.) Recreational use of marijuana has been decriminalized in his state, and he testified
that his use of marijuana has been consistent with state law. (Tr. 18-19.) He is aware that
marijuana  remains  illegal  under  federal  law.  (Tr.  33-34.)  He  does  not  have  a  medical
marijuana card. (Tr. 26.) Applicant has three housemates who use marijuana. One of these
housemates is a college friend with whom Applicant has used marijuana. (GE 2; Tr. 30.)
There have been some occasions since July 2019 where Applicant was offered marijuana,
including by one of his housemates, and he declined. (Tr. 37.) No one at Applicant’s work
is aware of his marijuana use. (Tr. 36.)

"Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  circuit  design  engineer,  employed  by  a  government
contractor since March 2017. He previously worked for the same company from May 2013
to June 2015, but resigned to avoid being reassigned to another facility in another state.
He graduated from high school in 2008, and earned two bachelor’s degrees in 2012. He
is unmarried and does not have any children. Applicant has never held a DOD security
clearance.
The SOR alleges  under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
that  Applicant  used  marijuana  from  approximately  2005  to  present,  including  after
completing a DOD security clearance application (SCA); and that he intends to continue
using  marijuana  in  the  future.  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the
allegations, and explained that he intends to continue to use marijuana on a recreational
basis, outside of working hours, in accordance with state regulations.
Applicant  submitted  an  SCA  in  April  2017.  In  it,  he  disclosed  a  history  of  using
marijuana (THC) since January 2005. He also disclosed past use of 3,4-methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine (MDMA) (also known as ecstasy or molly), three times from October
2008 to February 2015. He stopped using MDMA because he was no longer interested
in it, and because it was illegal.
Applicant was first caught using marijuana while in high school. He completed a
drug  awareness  program  in  lieu  of  a  suspension.  More  recently,  he  typically  used
marijuana with his girlfriend, friend, and roommate, usually with a smoking device (bong)
or by consuming edibles. He purchased marijuana and MDMA illegally from friends until
December  2012,  when  recreational  use  of  marijuana  became  legal  in  his  state,  and  it
could be legally purchased under state law, at state-approved dispensaries.
Applicant was twice drug tested by his current employer; including when he was
first hired in 2013, and again when he was rehired in March 2017. He passed both tests.
Applicant stopped using marijuana prior to applying for jobs because he was concerned
that he would test positive. Despite his employer’s pre-employment drug tests, Applicant
claimed that he is unaware of his company’s illegal drug-use policy, and would stop if his
company  asks,  but  he  understands  use  of  marijuana  is  illegal  under federal  law.  After
Applicant  was  rehired  and  subsequently  completed  his  SCA,  he  resumed  using
marijuana.
Applicant stated that he does not believe marijuana use is a problem as long as
he does not use it on company time. He compared it to drinking beer. He stated he intends
to continue to use marijuana with his friends, who have used it with him in the past. He
enjoys the effects he gets from THC, and he believes it has not created any problems for
him.  He  stated  that  he  will  continue  to  use  marijuana  under  state  law,  despite  his
knowledge that it is illegal under federal law. He asserted that he has no ties to the U.S.
government, so he sees no reason to stop using marijuana.
",False
"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, both of the factual
allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.).
Applicant’s admissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein as findings
of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a project manager with his current employer since March 2011. A 2002 high school
graduate, Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in 2013. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy
in  July  2002,  and  served  on  active  duty  until  February  2008,  when  he  was  medically
discharged  under  honorable  conditions,  with  no  reserve  obligation.  He  was  granted  a
secret clearance in 2008, and that clearance has remained active. Applicant was married
in 2007, and he has two children, born in 2011 and 2013.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  was  a  recreational  substance abuser  whose  substance of  choice  was
marijuana.  He  commenced  what  he  called  a  “minor  level  of  participation”  as  well  as
“limited and infrequent” use of marijuana during the Christmas holiday in about December
2010, when he was 26 years old, and he continued his use until at least May 2016, when
he was 32 years old, at a bachelor party of a close friend. In each instance, his marijuana
use  occurred  during  a  vacation,  or  while  attending  a  social  gathering.  Applicant  never
purchased the marijuana or carried it anywhere, for it was always provided by someone
else  during  those  gatherings.  He  denied  ever  using  marijuana  while  carrying  out  his
professional  responsibilities;  that  he  ever  failed  a  random  drug  screening;  or  that  his
marijuana use ever resulted in any disciplinary action or criminal charges. (Item 1 (Answer
to the SOR), at 2; Item 2, at 33; Item 3, at 2)
Marijuana  made  Applicant  feel  relaxed.  Nevertheless,  at  some  point,  Applicant
claimed that he decided that he no longer had the time or the desire to continue using
marijuana, and continued use did not align with his career or developmental goals. (Item
2, at 34; Item 3, at 2; Item 1, at 2) Applicant voluntarily reported his marijuana use to his
facility security officer (FSO) when he was completing his 2017 e-QIP. (Item 3, at 2) When
Applicant  completed  his 2017  e-QIP,  he  acknowledged  his past  drug  involvement  and
substance misuse. (Item 2, at 33-34)
Applicant denied knowing the significance of using any illegal drug while granted
access to classified information, and he contends that his marijuana use while holding his
security  clearance  was  done  “in  ignorance.”  (Response  to  the  FORM)  Now  that  he  is
aware of that information, Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from
all drug involvement and substance misuse, and he has acknowledged that any future
involvement  or  misuse  will  result  in  the  automatic  revocation  of  his  security  clearance
eligibility. (Statement of Intent, attached to his Response to the FORM) Applicant claims
that he has been drug free since May 2016, and that he has ended his relationships with
his drug-using friends and relatives. There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant has
ever received counseling or treatment as a result of his illegal use of drugs or controlled
substances.

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  his  Answer  to  the  SOR.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 24 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned
a  bachelor’s  degree  in  May  2018.  He  has  been  employed  by  his  present  employer,  a
federal  contractor,  since  June  2018.  His  job  title  is  software  developer.  Applicant  was
granted an interim DOD security clearance on October 24, 2018, however, his security
clearance was discontinued after the SOR was issued in June 2019. (Tr. 7, 13-14; GE
1)
In  his  October  2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  previously  used
marijuana on three occasions during college. Between November 2016 and April 2017,
he consumed THC-infused cakes twice, and smoked marijuana once. He listed that his
experiences  (of  using  THC)  were  rather  “underwhelming,  especially  when  considering
the risks of using it.” Applicant admitted that his use of marijuana usually coincided with
drinking alcohol. He also acknowledged that marijuana use is illegal under Federal law
and illegal in the state in which he resides. (Tr. 14-16, 22; GE 1)
From December 2018 through January 2019,  Applicant traveled to Europe with
his  girlfriend.  Before  he  departed  for  his  trip,  he  had  received  an  e-mail  notifying  him
that  he  had  been  granted  an  interim  DOD  security  clearance.  Applicant  admitted
receiving  this  notice,  but  stated  he  was  uncertain  of  the  underlying  implications  and
responsibilities  of  being  granted  an  interim  security  clearance.  He  did  not  seek  before
his  trip.  In  January  2019,  Applicant  and  his  girlfriend  visited  the  city  of  Amsterdam
where  the  use  of  marijuana  is  legal.  They  visited  a  coffee  shop  and  purchased  two
marijuana  joints  and  two  THC  infused  pastries,  known  as  “space  cakes.”  They
consumed  all  of  their purchases  during  the course  of  one  evening.  Applicant  admitted
this was the first time he felt the effects of the THC, and he considered it disorienting.
(Tr. 17-22)
Since his visit to Amsterdam in January 2019, Applicant has not used marijuana,
and  he  stated  at  the  hearing  that  he  is  willing  to  sign  a  letter  of  intent  not  to  use
marijuana  in  the future.  Applicant’s  supervisor is  fully  aware  of  Applicant’s  past  use  of
marijuana.  His  girlfriend  has  not  used  marijuana  since  their  trip  to  Amsterdam.  He
knows  of  friends  that  occasionally  use  marijuana,  but  he  does  not  socialize  with  them
when they are using it. Applicant admitted that he experiences periods of anxiety, but he
has  never  used  marijuana  to  treat  his  anxiety.  He  denied  having  any  problems  with
marijuana,  and  he  does  not  need  any  type  of  substance  abuse  treatment.  Applicant
stated  that  he  has  been  completely  honest  and  forthright  by  disclosing  his  use  of
marijuana during the course of his DOD investigation. (Tr. 22-25)

"Applicant,  age  31, has  never married and does  not  have  children. He  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in 2011. He has been employed by a defense contractor as an engineer
since  July  2016.  He  previously  worked  for  this  same  employer  from  September  2011
through  August  2015.  He  was  granted  a  DOD  security  clearance  in  December  2012.
(Items 1, 2)
Applicant left his job in 2015 to relocate to a new city, and to explore “the world”
and employment opportunities outside of the defense sector. He remained unemployed
through July 2016. During this period of unemployment, he used illegal drugs, which is
the subject of the SOR allegations. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant’s illegal drug use consisted of: 1) consuming a food product infused with
marijuana  one  time  in  November  2015;  2)  using  cocaine  that  he  purchased  on  three
occasions between February and June 2016; and 3) using ecstasy twice between June
and  July  2016.  He  described  his  drug  use  as  “recreational”  and  “experimental.”  He
attributed his drug use to an exploration phase in his life and to living in a city where drug
use was prevalent and normalized. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  used  drugs  knowing  that  they  were  illegal.  He
admitted that his drug use was a “lapse in judgment.” He has abstained from any drug
use  since  resuming  his  defense-contractor  employment,  and  has  no  intent  to  use  any
illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  Applicant  reported  his  drug  use  on  his  SCA,  and  candidly
discussed it during his SI and in his SOR response. He relocated from the city in which
he used drugs. Despite the fact that Applicant lives in a state that allows recreational use
of marijuana, he understands that its use remains incompatible with the maintenance of
his defense-contractor position and access to classified information. (Items 1, 2, 3)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  not  only  used  illegal  drugs,  but  did  so  “while
granted access to classified information.” Although Applicant answered “I admit” to each
SOR allegation, in his accompanying explanations, he denied that he had any access to
classified  information  during  the  period  of  unemployment  when  he  used  drugs.  In  the
FORM, the Government argued that Applicant’s clearance should be denied on the basis
that  he  used  drugs  “while  holding  a  security  clearance.”  Applicant’s  assertion  that  his
access  to  classified  information  was  limited  to  the  duration  of  his  employment  was
unrebutted  by  the  Government.  The  record  did  not  otherwise  establish  the  status  of
Applicant’s security clearance during the period of his drug use. (Item 1)

"Applicant is a 42-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
previously  granted  to  him  by  the  Defense  Department.  (Tr.  5-6)  He  has  worked  as  a
project  manager  for  a  company  doing  business  in  the  defense  industry  since  October
2019.  He  was  recently  assigned  collateral  duties  as  acting  vice-president  of  a  sister

master’s degree awarded in 2008. He is married to an active duty servicemember, and
they have no children.
Applicant’s  employment  history  includes  honorable  active  duty  military  service
during 1999-2006. (Exhibit E - DD Form 214) His military service included performance
of hazardous duties. He left active military duty and worked for a federal contractor as a
senior  telecommunications  specialist  for  a  couple  of  years.  He  had  a  similar  job  with
another  federal  contractor  during  2008-2010.  He  then  worked  the  next  several  years,
2010-2017,  as  an  information  technology  (IT)  specialist  for  a  federal  criminal
investigative  organization.  His  pay  grade  was  GS  13.  He  resigned  from  federal
employment  in  early  May  2017.  Thereafter,  he  worked  as  a  self-employed  site-survey
specialist  for  a  company  doing  business  in  the  defense  industry.  The  job  required

Applicant used cocaine in  about March 2017 and  April  2017, when he was a  39-
year-old federal employee holding a top-secret security clearance  with SCI access.  He
did  so  on   both  occasions  at  a  nightclub  where  he  was  offered  cocaine  by  an
acquaintance  (“a  friend  of  a  friend”).  (Tr.  21,  29)  He  accepted  the  cocaine  on  both
occasions.  It  was  powder  cocaine.  He  used  it  by  snorting  it.  Subsequently,  he  was
selected for a random drug test by his federal employer on April 12, 2017, and he tested
positive for cocaine. (Exhibits 3 and 4) He was contacted by the medical review officer
and  informed  of  the  positive  test  result  on  April  26,  2017.  He  then  contacted  his
supervisor and reported that the medical review officer had notified him of the positive
drug  test.  He  “insisted”  to  his  supervisor  that  the  drug  test  was  wrong.  (Exhibit  4)  He
was less than candid with his supervisor about the positive drug test due to his shame
and embarrassment. He later admitted to his supervisor that the positive drug test was
correct  and  that  he  had  used  cocaine.  He  resigned  from  federal  employment  in  early
May  2017.  His  resignation  occurred  before  his  employer  initiated  any  form  of
disciplinary action.
Applicant  described  his  use  of  cocaine  as  “the  biggest  mistake  of  my  life.”
(Exhibit 1 at 35)  He  attributed his cocaine use to the underlying issue  of sleep apnea,
which  is long-standing and  often left  him “tired and  miserable.”  (Exhibits E and F; Tr.  21-
22) His chronic fatigue was such that he  found  it difficult to  wake up in  the morning and
was sometimes late  for work, leading him to  be counseled for occasional lateness by his
supervisor   during  his  federal  employment.   He   explained  that  he  used  the  cocaine
because “he just wanted to enjoy a life of energy like everyone else.” (Answer at 5) After
years  of  seeing  doctors,   he  was  recommended  for   corrective  surgery  to  address  the
problem  in  May 2017. (Exhibit 1 at 36) He  had  the surgery during the summer of 2019,
and  he reports that he is now able to better  tolerate the CPAP machine  and his sleep
has improved. His history of  sleep apnea, the sleep disruption  it caused, and  the post-
surgery improvement of his sleep was confirmed and  verified  by his spouse, who is well
aware of the matter. (Exhibit D)
Applicant stated that he has not used cocaine since 2017, and  there is no record
evidence to establish  cocaine usage  other than the two occasions in  2017. He  no longer
associates with the group  of people he was with when he used cocaine in  2017. (Tr. 37-
39) He  submitted a  signed  statement of  intent setting forth  his intention to abstain from
all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement
or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  (Exhibit C)
In  addition  to  the  signed  statement  of  intent,  Applicant  submitted  a  number  of
documents in support  of his case.  (Exhibits  A - G) Taken together, the documentation
shows  that  he  has  enjoyed  a  good  record  of  employment  over  the  years.  The
documents also include highly favorable recommendations from several people. Those
matters are summarized below.
Applicant’s former supervisor during his federal employment provided an affidavit
wherein  he  stated  the  following:  (1)  Applicant  had  a  solid  work  ethic  and  always
received  positive  annual  performance  reviews  resulting  in  further  recognition  and
bonuses; (2) the former supervisor is well aware of the facts and circumstances in the
SOR, and he believes Applicant’s use of cocaine was out of character and will not recur;
and  (3)  he  believes  Applicant  can  be  trusted  with  access  to  classified  information.
(Exhibit A1)
Applicant’s  former  chief  information  officer  provided  an  affidavit  wherein  he
stated  the  following:  (1)  Applicant  was  a  careful,  considerate,  efficient,  and  dedicated
employee  who  completed  all  assignments  ahead  of  schedule;  (2)  the  CIO  is  aware  of
the  facts  and  circumstances  in  the  SOR,  and  he  believes  Applicant’s  use  of  cocaine
was an unfortunate situation and probably one of a kind; and (3) he believes Applicant
can be trusted with access to classified information. (Exhibit A2)
Applicant’s  longtime  friend  and  fellow  IT  professional  provided  an  affidavit
wherein he stated the following: (1) he has known Applicant for more than 20 years as
they met through mutual friends in their hometown and they communicate almost daily
via text message and social media; (2) he is aware of the facts and circumstances in the
SOR, and  he believes Applicant’s cocaine use was “an extraordinary anomaly and  not
reflective  of  his  character”;  (3)  Applicant  confided  in  him  after  resigning  from  federal
employment  and  was  both  very  regretful  and  disappointed  in  himself;  and  (4)  he
believes Applicant should be granted a security clearance. (Exhibit A3)
Applicant’s  current  company  president  provided  an  affidavit  wherein  he  stated
the  following:  (1)  Applicant  has  proved  himself  to  be  a  trusted  and  reliable  employee
during his relatively short tenure with the company, which resulted in his assignment as
acting  vice-president  of  a  sister  company;  (2)  he  is  aware  of  the  facts  and
circumstances  in  the  SOR,  and  he  believes  those  matters  do  not  reflect  Applicant’s
character, current conduct, and willingness and ability to protest classified information,
and  that  the  cocaine  usage  was  an  aberration  that  will  not  recur;  and  (3)  he  believes
Applicant can be trusted with access to classified information. (Exhibit G)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
1   Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484   U.S.   518,  528  (1988)   (“it   should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security  clearance”); Duane v.  Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).

3 484 U.S. at 531.
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and   a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed   under  the
substantial-evidence  standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.6  An
Applicant  is  responsible  for  presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or
mitigate  facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.7  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8
Discussion
Under  Guideline H for  drug involvement  and substance misuse,  the concern as
set forth in AG ¶ 24 is that:
[t]he  illegal  use  of  controlled  substances,   to  include  the  misuse  of
prescriptions and  non-prescription  drugs, and  the use of other substances
that   cause   physical  or  mental   impairment  or   are   use  in   a  manner
inconsistent  with  their  intended  purpose,  can  raise  questions  about  an
individual’s   reliability  and   trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior
may  lead  to   physical  or  psychological  impairment  and   because   it  raises
questions about a person’s ability or  willingness to comply with laws, rules,
and regulations. . .  .
In addition to the above concern, I note that Applicant’s illegal drug use while a
to  Executive  Order  12564—Drug-Free  Federal
federal  employee  was  contrary
Workplace,  which  was  signed  by  President  Ronald  Reagan  on  September  15,  1986,
and  was  in  effect  when  Applicant  used  cocaine  in  2017.  The  main  points  of  the
Executive  Order  are:  (1)  federal  employees  are  required  to  refrain  from  using  illegal
drugs;  (2)  use  of  illegal  drugs  by  federal  employees,  on  or  off  duty,  is  contrary  to  the
efficiency  of  the  service;  and  (3)  persons  who  use  illegal  drugs  are  not  suitable  for
federal employment.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions:
AG ¶ 25(a) any substance abuse;
4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.14.
7 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
8 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
AG ¶ 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug;
AG  ¶  25(f)  any  illegal  drug  use  while  granted  access  to  classified
information or holding a sensitive position;
AG   ¶  26(a)  the   behavior  happened   so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,   or
happened under such  circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt   on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or   good
judgment; and
AG  ¶ 26(b)  the  individual acknowledges  his  or  her  drug involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including  but  not
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)
changing  or  avoiding  the  environment  where  drugs  were  used;  and  (3)
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility.
I have considered the totality of Applicant’s involvement with cocaine. It consisted
of the two admitted uses of cocaine in 2017. It was detected by a random drug test in
April  2017.  His  cocaine  use  occurred  during  his  employment  with  a  federal  criminal
investigative organization while he held a top-secret security clearance with SCI access.
Any  illegal  drug  use  is  relevant  in  the  context  of  evaluating  a  person’s  security
worthiness,  but  it  is  particularly  egregious  if  it  occurs  during  the  course  of  federal
employment  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.  More  was  expected  of
Applicant  given  his  age  (39),  educational  background,  and  maturity  in  2017.  He  also
should  have  known  better  in  light  of  his  previous  military  service  and  his  years  of
employment  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  His  cocaine  use  was  an  egregious
lapse of good judgment.
Applicant presented a good case in mitigation. It is apparent that he understands
the  seriousness  of  his  misconduct.  He  is  both  remorseful  and  regretful.  He  has
disassociated  himself  from  drug-using  associates  and  contacts.  He  is  career  focused,
has a good record of employment (including honorable military service), and has highly
favorable  recommendations  from  co-workers  and  friends.  His  cocaine  use  occurred
more than three years ago, there is no evidence of further illegal drug use, and he has
pledged to abstain from all illegal drug involvement and substance misuse. I have also
considered the underlying issue of Applicant’s long-standing medical condition of sleep
apnea. It played a role in his decision to use cocaine. And it is noteworthy that his sleep
apnea is now much improved due to the medical treatment he had in 2019.
Nonetheless,  I  am  not  persuaded  that  Applicant  is  an  acceptable  security  risk
within  the  meaning  of  ¶  2(a)  of  Appendix  A  of  Enclosure  2  to  the  Directive.  I  reached
this  conclusion  for  a  couple  of  reasons.  First,  his  2017  cocaine  use  was  clearly
forbidden  conduct  that  he  chose  to  engage  in  despite  knowing  the  potential  negative
consequences. In addition to being a serious lapse in good judgment, his  cocaine use
demonstrated a willingness to engage in high-risk behavior, which does not make him a
good candidate for a security clearance. Second, I doubt Applicant’s cocaine use would
have come to light but for the random drug test. Indeed, he did not report his  cocaine
use to his federal employer before the random drug test. Third, when confronted with a
positive result from the drug test, Applicant insisted to his then supervisor that the test
result was wrong. Taken together, the seriousness of his misconduct, his reluctance to
voluntarily  self-report  his  cocaine  use,  and  his  initial  lack  of  candor  undermine  his
security  suitability.  Finally,  I  note  that  the  ultimate  outcome  here  is  consistent  with
similar  cases  that  I  have  decided  involving  illegal  drug  use  while  holding  a  security
clearance. E.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 (May, 10, 2019), which was affirmed by the
DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 17-02225 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019).
Following Egan  and  the clearly consistent standard, I have  doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,   and   ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In   reaching  this  conclusion,   I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and   considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.   In  particular,  I
considered   Applicant’s  honorable  military  service and   his  sleep apnea.  I  conclude that
he  has  not   met   his  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show   that  it  is  clearly   consistent
with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.

Michael H. Leonard
Administrative Judge
9  The  SOR  cross-allegation  under  Guideline  E  for  personal  conduct  concerns  Applicant’s  questionable
judgment  in  light  of  his  cocaine  use.  After  considering  the  applicable  disqualifying  and  mitigating
conditions  under  Guideline  E,  the  matter  is  decided  against  Applicant  under  the  rationale  discussed
above under Guideline H. Further discussion under Guideline E is redundant.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f,
3.a, and 3.b. He denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. His admissions in his answer and at
the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 33-year-old vehicle refueler employed by a defense contractor since
October 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married, but
he  has  lived  with  a  cohabitant  since  October  2016.  He  and  his  cohabitant  have  a  16-
month-old daughter. (Tr. 19.)
Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in
2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014. He stopped
using it because his employer started random drug testing, and he realized that it could
jeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.) In his first SCA in February 2007, he answered “No” to the
question whether he had used a drug or controlled substance within the past seven years.
(GX  1  at  23.)  He  testified  that  he  could  not  remember  why  he  did  not  disclose  his
marijuana use. (Tr. 28.) He also testified that there was no reason why he continued to
use marijuana until 2014, except stupidity. (Tr. 30.)
Applicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with brandishing a firearm. His
arrest occurred after he was involved in a bar fight, and one of the participants told police
that  he  had  brandished  a  firearm.  The  police  stopped  him  as  he  drove  away  from  the
scene of the fight. He testified that he has never owned a firearm. The police searched
the  vehicle  and  did  not  find  a  firearm.  He  appeared  in  court  and  was  found  not  guilty
because the police were unable to find a firearm. (GX 4 at 3; Tr. 34-35.)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  February  2009  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana. After the police stopped him for speeding, they found marijuana in the center
console of his car. He appeared in court and adjudication was deferred. He was placed
on probation for one year, required to attend drug-education classes, and was subjected
to  random  urinalysis.  He  successfully  completed  his  probation  and  the  charges  were
dismissed. (GX 4 at 3; GX 5.) He did not disclose this arrest in his February 2017 SCA,
because he was told that his arrest record would be expunged. (Tr. 31.)
In  November  2010,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana and having defective equipment on his car. After Applicant completed a period
of probation and drug classes, the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 12.) Applicant
did  not  disclose  this  arrest  to  his  employer.  He  testified  that  he  was  unaware  of  any
requirement  to  disclose  arrests  to  his  employer.  He  did  not  disclose  this  arrest  or  his
continued use of marijuana in his February 2017 SCA, because he was afraid that it would
jeopardize his clearance and his job. (Tr. 32-33, 39.)
In  January  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  with  reckless  driving,  having  an  open
container  of  alcohol  in  his  car,  and  possession  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was  with  his
cousin, and he told the police that the marijuana was his, because he did not want his
cousin to get in trouble. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant was convicted of the open-container offense
and reckless driving, but the marijuana charge was dismissed. (GX 13.)
In November 2013, Applicant was arrested for maliciously causing bodily injury to
his  cohabitant.  He  testified  that  his  cohabitant  was  driving  home  after  they  had  been
drinking at a bar, they began arguing, his cohabitant began swerving, and he grabbed the
steering wheel to keep the car from striking a guardrail. The police officer who noticed the
swerving stopped them, noticed a cut on the cohabitant’s forehead, and concluded that
Applicant had hit her in the face. Applicant spent a week in jail after his arrest. (Tr. 53-
55.) The charge was later reduced to  assault and battery. In February 2014, the court
found “facts  sufficient  to  find guilt,”  but  deferred adjudication for  one  year.  The  charge
was dismissed in February 2015. (GX 7.)
Applicant  submitted  his  second  SCA  in  February  2017.  He  answered  “No”  to  a
question  whether,  during  the  last  seven  years,  he  had  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled substances. He also answered “No” to a question whether he had ever used
or  otherwise  been  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a
security clearance. (GX 2 at 26.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2018, he
told the investigator that he had never been charged with an offense related to alcohol or
drugs.  When  the  investigator  confronted  him  with  evidence  of  his  arrest  record,  which
included drug offenses, he disclosed his marijuana use, beginning in his teenage years
and ending in 2014. He told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use
while holding a security clearance because it did not matter, since he had stopped using
marijuana. He also told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use because
he misread the question. (GX 3 at 12-13.)
In July 2018, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on his cohabitant.
Applicant testified that he was driving home after work after a long work day and spending
some time at a friend’s house. He fell asleep and hit the rear of an 18-wheel truck. His
cohabitant  came  to  the  scene  and  was  taking  him  home  when  they  began  arguing,
because his cohabitant refused to take him to a hospital. Applicant became angry and
cracked the windshield of their car by punching it with his fist. His cohabitant called the
police,  who  concluded  that  they had been fighting. (Tr.  57-63.)  A protective order  was
issued, prohibiting Applicant from having any contact with his cohabitant for three days.
(GX 9.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  charged  and  the  protective  order  was  issued
because his cohabitant “got all hysterical” and told the police that he had smacked her.
He  admitted  that,  on  several  occasions,  he  grabbed  her  and  shook  her  after  she  said
things intended to provoke him. (Tr. 50-51.) In September 8, 2018, he appeared in court
and  pleaded  no  contest.  The  judge  found  “facts  sufficient  to  find  guilt”  and  deferred
adjudication  until  September  2020.  (GX  8.)  Applicant  completed  his  probation  and  the
charge was dismissed. (Tr. 63.) Applicant and his cohabitant stayed apart for about seven
or eight months after his arrest. (Tr. 64.) He testified that most of their arguments arose
from his cohabitant’s desire that he stay at home instead of socializing with friends away
from  home  and  her  practice  of  saying  things  that  she  knew  would  provoke  him.  He
testified that the arguments and physical violence stopped after their daughter was born.
(Tr. 51-52.)
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI). His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was 0.17. In the jurisdiction where he
was arrested, jail time is mandatory for a BAC at or above 0.15. In March 2019, Applicant
was convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 175 days suspended, and a $250
fine.  He  was  placed  on  unsupervised  probation  for  one  year.  His  driver’s  license  was
restricted for one year, and he was required to install an ignition interlock on his vehicle.
(GX 10.) He served his jail sentence on weekends. (Tr. 66.)
Applicant admitted that many of his arrests were related to alcohol, but he does
not believe he has an alcohol problem. He has reduced his drinking since the birth of his
daughter. He drinks mainly on weekends and limits himself to about two drinks  or two
beers. (Tr. 67.) He has never been diagnosed with an alcohol-abuse disorder or received
treatment for it.

"Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  single  man.  He  graduated  from  college  in  1993,  earning  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
business administration, and he earned a master’s degree in business administration in 2003.
Applicant  is  the  owner  and  chief  executive  officer  of  a  company  that  provides contract  services  to  federal
government  clients.  (Tr.  49;  AE  C)  When  he  started  the company in 2008, he was the only employee. By 2019,
the company employed 115 people. In 2020, the company’s annual gross revenue totaled approximately $19.7 million
dollars. (Tr. 49) According to the company’s chief operating officer, who has worked for Applicant for the last three
years  and  known  him  for  16  years,  Applicant  is  a  well-respected  individual  who  excels  in  his  work.  (Tr.  24)
Applicant  is  a  humanitarian  who  donates  significant company  resources  to  charities,  targeting  youth  who  are
either  underprivileged,  or underrepresented in certain professional fields, and families with food insecurity. (Tr. 78)
Applicant has held a security clearance since 2008.
Applicant used marijuana from 2016 to approximately June 2019. (Answer at 5) He consumed it in cookie or
brownie  form.  He  began  using  it  to  reassure  a  friend  who  had  been  prescribed  it  to  control  pain  related  to  multiple
sclerosis  and  was  hesitant  to  use  it.  In  an  effort  to  reassure  her,  Applicant  told  her  that  “[he  would]  try  it  with
[her].”  (Tr.  53) Subsequently, Applicant “used it to relax and get a good night’s sleep,” approximately once per  month
in  social  settings  and  on  vacations.  (GE  1  at  41;  GE  3  at  8;  Supplemental Answer at 4)
When  Applicant  disclosed  his  marijuana  use  on  his  2018  security  clearance application,  he  noted  that
he  “might”  use  it  again  in  the  future.  (GE  1  at  41)  As  time  elapsed,  his  intention  to  continue  using  marijuana
became more definitive. Specifically, in his  subject  interview  he  stated  that  he  was  likely  to  use  it  again,  and  in
response  to interrogatories, completed in June 2019, he answered “Y” in response to the question, “[d]o you intend to
use this drug in the future?.” (GE 2 at 3)
Applicant no longer uses marijuana. It is unclear from the record when Applicant stopped using marijuana. In
his  Supplemental  Answer  of  March  2020,  he  stated  that  he  had  not  consumed  marijuana  since  January  2019.
(Supplemental  Answer  at  15)  Earlier,  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  completed  in  June  2019,  he  noted  that  he
used marijuana on
“various dates throughout  the  year,” and  intended  to smoke it in the future. (GE 2 at 3),  Applicant  testified  that  he
“was  not  fully  as  present  as  [he]  should  have  been”  when disclosing the dates of his marijuana usage. (Tr. 88)
Applicant  executed  an  affidavit  in  November  2019  stating  his  intention  never  to  use  marijuana  again.
(Supplemental  Answer  at  39)  In  February  2021,  he  executed  an  affidavit  stating  that  he  had  complied  with  the
previous affidavit and reiterated his intent not to use marijuana in the future. (AE A)
Applicant  used marijuana  under  “the wrongful impression  that  [he] could use [it while] holding a clearance so
long  as  the  state  laws  provided  for  legal  use,  despite  the  fact  that  marijuana  usage  is  still  prohibited  under  federal
law.”  (Supplemental  Answer  at  17)  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  his  marijuana  use  stemmed  from
“ignorance  of  not understanding  the  gravity  of  holding  on  to  a  clearance  .  .  .  .”  (Tr.  52)  Currently,  he  is attending
education  programs,  and  disassociating  himself  from  social  events  where marijuana use occurs. (Supplemental

In  January  2014,  Applicant  was arrested and charged with driving/attempting to drive  under  the  influence  of
alcohol (DUI), after pulling over to the side of the road to go to sleep upon leaving a night club. (Answer, Enclosure 3
at 6 - 7) He was sentenced to one year of probation, a monetary fine, and 30 days of jail time, suspended.
Applicant  now  takes  a  cab  or  an  Uber  home  if  he  drinks  alcohol  during  social outings. (Tr. 68) He has had
no alcohol-related incidents since the 2014 arrest.
Applicant  failed  to  report  his  DUI  arrest  to  his  facility  security  office,  as  required  by  the  National  Industrial
Security  Program  Operating  Manual  (NISPOM),  Chapter  1,  Section  3,  paragraph  1-300.  Also,  he  did  not  report  his
marijuana use to his facility security office, as required. When Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, he was
serving as the facility security officer (FSO) of his company. Unaware of the process of reporting oneself on the JPAS
system,  he  decided  to  wait  until  the  next  Defense  Security  Services  audit  to  disclose  the  adverse  information.  (Tr.
62-64) There is no record evidence that he made such a disclosure. Moreover, contrary to Applicant’s testimony that
he disclosed  the 2014 DUI arrest on his 2018  security clearance  application,  he did not actually  disclose  it until  his
investigative interview in October 2018. (GE 1; GE 2 at 20)
As Applicant’s company continued to grow, he began to recognize how untenable it was for him to balance his
CEO  managerial  responsibilities  with  the  security  maintenance  and  oversight  responsibilities  of  an  FSO.
Consequently,  in  2020,  he  hired  an  FSO.  (Tr.  61;  AE  B)  The  FSO  developed  a  security  compliance  program  and
installed an intranet. Also, the  FSO  tracks  the  requisite  trainings  for  employees  to  complete,  and  he  publishes  a
monthly security newsletter for the company. (Tr. 62-64)
During the federal government sequestration of 2013, Applicant lost a government contract which represented
90  percent  of  his  business.  (Tr.  70;  Answer  at  41)  Absent  this  income,  the  business  began  to  struggle,  and
Applicant  could  not  afford  to  pay  his
expenses.  In  2014,  he  consulted  an  attorney  who  advised  him  to  restructure  his  debt  through  filing  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy  protection.  (Tr.  69)  Applicant  took  his  attorney’s  advice  and  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  protection  in
February 2014. (Tr. 69)
After Applicant reviewed the proposed plan, he was not confident that he had the income to successfully execute
it.  Upon  his  attorney’s  advice,  he  withdrew  the  petition  and  refiled  a  few  months  later  in  July  2014  after  he  had  been
awarded  more  contracts  and  was  in  a  stronger  position  to  comply  with  a  Chapter  13  debt  resolution  plan.  (Tr.  70)
Ultimately, Applicant paid 100 percent of his debt through the second bankruptcy plan, three years ahead of schedule.
(Tr. 72)
Currently, the only debt Applicant has is his home mortgage. (Tr. 76) His business has grown continuously since
2014, and grossed $19.7 million of revenue in 2020. (Tr. 74) Applicant  earned  a  salary  of  $161,544  in  2020  through  his
business,  and  a  salary  of approximately $114,000 through another business that he started in 2018. (HE I)

"Applicant is 36 years old.  He is married and has two children.  He has two years
of  community  college  and  four  years  of  trade  school.  He  is  employed  by  a  defense
contractor as a Quality Assurance Technician for Aircraft Production.  He is seeking to
obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  conduct,  drug  abuse,  and  dishonesty,
evidenced by numerous arrests and Felony convictions spanning most of his adult life.
(Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.)  He began working for his current employer in
October 2017.  (Government Exhibit 1).  He has never applied for a security clearance
before, and has no military service.  Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth
in the SOR.
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  2002.  He  went  on  to  school  for  auto
mechanics and briefly worked in the field.  He then went to work for a beer distribution
warehouse.  While  employed  there,  in  late  August  2006,  Applicant  was  involved  in  an
elaborate robbery scheme where he and his friends stole 1.25 million dollars.
Applicant  testified  that  he  and  four  friends  robbed  an  armored  truck.  Two  of
Applicant’s friends worked for the armored truck company.  Applicant explained that he
and his friends got uniforms from the friend who worked for the company.  Applicant’s
role in the heist was that of the get-a-way driver, so that he did not wear a uniform.  His
two friends went up to the armored truck, knocked on the door, and the doors opened.
They went into the vehicle, took a couple of bags of money, and came back to the car.
Applicant  then  drove  away.  Applicant  and  his  friends  were  said  to  have  stolen  1.25
million dollars from the heist.  After dividing the money between them, Applicant’s share
of the proceeds was about a quarter of a million dollars.  He bought clothes and a cell
phone.  Applicant was arrested when a private investigator who had been following two
of  his  friends  around,  who  worked  for  the  company,  traced  the  robbery  back  to  the
Applicant.  Applicant  was  charged  and  convicted  of  Grand  Theft:  Money,  Labor,
Property  over  $400,  a  Felony.  He  was  sentenced  to  two  years  in  state  prison.  He
actually served 13 months before being released in October 2007, as he was credited
for pretrial time served.  (Tr. pp.19 - 25.)
From  October  2007  to  June  2009,  Applicant  worked  as  a  Lube  Technician,
working  on  cars,  doing  oil  changes  and  the  like.  He  was  involved  in  a  motorcycle
accident  and  was  unemployed  until  November  2011.  During  this  idle  time,  Applicant
and his friends started using methamphetamines.  On at least two separate occasions,
Applicant was arrested for Possessions of a Controlled Substance, and Possession of
Drug  Paraphernalia.  On  both  occasions,  Applicant  was  arrested  with  friends  and
methamphetamine was confiscated.  Applicant was actually in the middle of the court
ordered  drug  program  for  his  first  offense,  when  he  was  arrested  for  possession  of
methamphetamines a second time.  (Tr. pp. 30-31.)  As a result of these convictions, in
September 2010, Applicant was placed on an 18-month Deferred Entry of Judgment for
Possession  of  a  Controlled  Substance  and  Possession  of  Drug  Paraphernalia.  On
about September 24, 2010, Applicant failed to appear for a Deferred Entry of Judgment,
and a Bench Warrant was issued.  On about December 1, 2010, he was sentenced to
one year of active formal probation, fined, and ordered to work with a probation officer in
a plan for substance abuse counseling and service.  Applicant claims that he has been
clean and sober since December 2010.  (Tr. pp. 25 - 32.)
In  November
2010,  Applicant  was
of
Possession/Manufacture/Sell of Dangerous Weapon, a Felony. Applicant explained that
he was with some friends when they were pulled over, and brass knuckles were found
in  the  Applicant’s  backpack.  He  was  sentenced  to  three  years  formal  probation,  and
one day in county jail.  (Tr. pp. 31 - 32.)
convicted
charged
and
A  few  months  later,  in  January  2011,  Applicant  was  charged   and  convicted  of
Forgery, a Felony.  Applicant  explained that he was cashing checks  that he knew  to be
fraudulent.  He  got the checks from  a friend of a friend.  Applicant  testified that he would
go to the banks and  cash them like they  were payments to  him for providing a service of
some  kind.     Applicant   did  this  at  least  three  times,  involving  three  fraudulent  checks.
Applicant  pled  nolo   contendere   to  Second  Degree  Commercial   Burglary  and   Grand
Theft  of Personal Property.   On or about February 9, 2011, Applicant was sentenced  to
two   years  confinement  in   state   prison   and  was  ordered  to  pay  restitution  of  $400.
Applicant  was  released  early  for   good  behavior,   and   was  given  six   weeks  credit  for
completing  school  and receiving  certificates in  various computer programs.   (Tr.  pp.  33-
35.)
Applicant was hired by his current employer in 2017.  On November 1, 2017, he
completed a security clearance application.  Section 23 of the application asked him, if
in the  last  seven years,  had  he  used any  illegal drugs  or  controlled  substances?  The
Applicant  answered,  “NO.”  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  his  use  of  methamphetamines
from January 2010 to December 2010.  (Government Exhibit 1.)
Section 23 of that same application asked the Applicant if in the last seven years,
had  he  been  involved  in  the  illegal  purchase,  manufacture,  cultivation,  trafficking,
production,  transfer,  shipping,  handling  or  sale  of  any  drug  or  controlled  substance?
Applicant answered, “NO.”  Applicant failed to disclose that he was arrested on at least
two  separate  occasions  for  Possession  of  Methamphetamines  in  2010.  (Government
Exhibit 1.)
Applicant was not truthful when he answered the questions in Section 23, and he
should have answered, “Yes,” to both questions on the application.  Although Applicant
acknowledged his drug use in the police record section of the application, he explained
that  the  reason  he  did  not  disclose  it  in  this  section  is  because  he  did  not  want  the
Government to think that he was still using drugs when he was not.  (Tr. pp. 40 and 42).
Applicant  was  not  truthful  here.  Applicant’s  deliberate  attempt  to  deceive  the
Government is unacceptable and shows immaturity and poor judgment.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with a defense contractor since 1989. He has held a security clearance since
1989. (TR at page 15 line 22 to page 17 line 18, and GX 2 at page 7.)  He is married,
and  has  two  adult  children.  (TR  at  page  15  line  22  to  page  17  line  18,  and  GX  2  at
pages 15, 17 and 18.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
Applicant  began  drinking  alcohol  at  about  15  years  of  age,  and   started  having
“drinking problems”  at the age  of 18. (TR at page 17 line 20 to page 18 line 13.)  His first
Driving Under the Influence  of Alcohol  (DUI)  incident occurred about 1988. This incident
was not alleged in  the  SOR. Applicant considers himself to be an alcoholic. (TR at page
17 line 20 to page 19 line 14.)
1.d.  Applicant’s  second  alcohol-related  incident  occurred  in  February  of  2008,
when he was charged with and pled guilty to DUI. (TR at page 19 line 15 to page 25 line
13.) He received treatment, was diagnosed as suffering from an Alcohol Use Disorder,
and attended Alcoholics Anonymous for two years. (Id., and TR at page 27 lines 3~8.)
1.a. After about eight years of sobriety, Applicant returned to the consumption of
alcohol;  and  as  a  result,  received  out-patient  treatment  for  his  Alcohol  Use  Disorder
from about February 2017 to about August 2017. (TR at page 25 line 20 to page 28 line
7, and at page 30 lines 2~8.)
1.b. After a “few months” of sobriety, Applicant again returned to the consumption
of  alcohol;  and  as  a  result,  received  in-patient  treatment  for  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,
Severe from about January of 2018 to about May 2018. (TR at page 28 line 10 to page
32 line 7.)
1.c.  Despite the above mentioned in-patient and out-patient treatments, Applicant
returned  to  the  consumption  of  alcohol.  (TR  at  page  32  line  8  to  page  35  line  5.)  He
avers  that  he  has  abstained  from  its  consumption  since  October  of  2018,  about  two
years prior to his hearing. (Id.)
Guideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
2.a.  and   2.b.  Applicant  used  marijuana  on  numerous  occasions  from  1981  until
about January of 2018. (TR at page 35 line 10 to page 36 line 14.) Most of his usage
was  prior  to  his  being  granted  a  security  clearance,  but  Applicant  did  use  the  illegal
substance “a couple of times”  while holding a security clearance. (TR at page 17 lines
9~14, at page 37 line 8 to page 38 line 18, and at page 42 lines 6~25.)
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
3.a.  and   3.b.  In  answer  to  Section  23  on  his  October  5,  2017,  SCA,  Applicant
failed  to  disclose  his  marijuana  usage.  During  his   subsequent  subject  interview
conducted   under  oath  on  January  17,  2019,  Applicant  continued  to  conceal  his
marijuana usage. (TR at  page 38 line 19 to page 39 line 11, and  GX 2 at  pages 29~30.)
This lack of candor constitutes willful falsifications.
",False
"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 25 years old. He worked for a defense contractor (DC) at various times
from  March  2018  to  March  2020,  either  in  an  internship  program  or  a  cooperative
program. He holds an associate’s degree and is working toward his bachelor’s degree.
He is single, never married, and has no children. (Tr. 6, 23-28; GE1)
The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana at various times from October 2018 to
August 2019; that he used marijuana after being granted an interim security clearance in
June  2018;  and  in  response  to  interrogatories,  in  August  2019,  he  admitted  that  he
intended to use marijuana in the future. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c) It also alleged that Applicant
consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication twice per month; and that he was arrested
in September 2018 and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. (SOR ¶¶
2.a-2.b) All these allegation were also cross-alleged as personal conduct concerns. (SOR
¶ 3.a)
Applicant admitted that his marijuana use began after he started working for DC in
March  2018.  Before  that,  he  had  never  tried  it.  By  the  time  of  his  first  use,  he  had
completed  filing  out  his  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  and  he  was  aware  that
marijuana use violated DC’s drug abstinence policy. He also knew that using marijuana
violated both federal and state law at the time. He associated with people at a commercial
job who had access to marijuana in vape form and that is the method he used to ingest
marijuana. He used marijuana approximately six times while holding a security clearance
with the last time being in August 2019. He also stated in interrogatory responses that
“my future drug use will remain sporadic and recreational.” In November 2020, marijuana
use became legal for recreational use under the state law of his residence. During his
hearing testimony he modified that position somewhat by claiming that he would only use
marijuana  in  the  future  if  it  was  legal  under  federal  law.  He  did  not  submit  a  signed
statement of intent not to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 26-27, 30, 37-39, 44-45, 51-52;
GE 3)
In  an  April 2019  statement  given  during  his  background  investigation,  Applicant
admitted to drinking to the point of intoxication twice a month. These were his drinking
habits in about August 2018. He would drink five or six beers, or two to four cocktails,
once  or  twice  a  week  with  friends.  In  his  SOR  answer  and  during  his  testimony,  he
modified  the  amount  of  alcohol  he  is  now  consuming.  He  claims  that  he  cut  back  his
alcohol  use  in  2019  to  about  one  to  two  beers  or  cocktails  per  month.  He  does  not
regularly become intoxicated anymore. The last time he was intoxicated was in October
2020 at his parents’ Halloween party. There is no evidence of his alcohol use causing a
legal or employment issue. He has not been diagnosed with an alcohol abuse disorder.
(Tr. 31, 45, 49-50; GE 3; Answer to SOR)
At  approximately  three  a.m.  on  October  15,  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  for
contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was 22 years old at the time and was with
two females,  ages 18 and 15. The  18-year-old  female was  driving Applicant’s car  in  a
residential neighborhood. The car was stopped by police and it was determined that the
18-year-old had a blood alcohol content of .06 percent, which is over the legal limit for
someone under age 21. Both Applicant and the 15-year-old had negative blood alcohol
test  results.  After  initially  denying  that  he  provided  the  alcohol  to  the  driver,  he  later
admitted  doing  so.  He  was  arrested  and  pleaded  guilty  through  a  pre-trial  diversion
program. He satisfied all the terms of his diversion and after six months, the charges were
dismissed. Applicant explained that he was associating with the wrong crowd at that time
and  he  stopped  doing  so.  He  has  not  associated  with  those  two  females  since  the
incident. (Tr. 32, GE 2; Answer to SOR)
Applicant admitted that he did not report the arrest to his security officer at DC or
to  his  parents.  He  claims  that  he  was  not  aware  of  his  duty  to  report  the  arrest  to  his
security officer. He admitted that his nondisclosure to his parents was partly based on
him wanting to handle the incident himself, and partly based on his desire to  keep the
information from them. (Tr. 42, 52-53)
Applicant presented two character letters from a coworker from DC and from his
general  manager  from  a  commercial  job  he  held.  Both  noted  that  he  is  reliable  and
competent at his job. Both felt that he is an excellent employee. An appraisal from DC for
his 2019 internship acknowledged that he fulfilled management’s expectations of him with
solid contributions to the team. Over the course of several internships in 2018 and 2019,
he was recognized with two “Spot Awards” and three “Achievement Awards.”

"Applicant’s  SOR response   admitted all of the SOR allegations, and  he provided
some  extenuating   and  mitigating  information.   His   admissions   are   accepted  as  factual
findings.
Background Information
Applicant is a 25-year-old electronics engineer, who has been employed full-time
by a defense contractor since October 2017. Before becoming a full-time employee, he
was  employed  as  a college  intern  by that defense contractor  in the summers  of 2015,
2016, and 2017. (Tr. 14-15, 57, 61-62; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  2013.  He  did  not  complete  his
college  requirements  until  October  2017,  and  was  awarded  a  bachelor  of  science
degree  in  physics  in  December  2017.  (Tr.  15-16;  GE  1)  Applicant  has  never  married
and has no dependents. (Tr. 16-17) He has held a Secret security clearance since July
2015,  and  has  a  pending  application  to  upgrade  his  clearance  to  Top  Secret.
Maintaining a clearance is a requirement of his continued employment. (Tr. 17-18, 56)
Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
In his June 15, 2015 SF-86, Applicant disclosed his marijuana use that spanned
a period of time from May 2010 to December 2013. He was introduced to marijuana as
a freshman on the high school baseball team, having smoked marijuana about 25 times
during  his  high  school  years,  and  “completely  stopped”  in  his  senior  year.  He  used
marijuana again as a freshman in college “about 3 times.” Applicant added in that same
SF-86:
I  have   not  done  any   drugs  since  my  first  semester,  freshman   year,  in
college.  .  .  .  I  have   done  an  incredible   amount  of  growing  since   then,  in
high school,  I stopped spending time with the crowd that I smoked with.  . .
.  the  “benefits”   of   doing  any  drug  is  in   no  way  even  close  to  the  level  of
satisfaction that I get from doing my job here at [defense contractor]  and
the  possible  benefits  that  would  come  later   with  a  security  clearance.  To
jeopardize  my  future  in   this  industry  (and  everything  that  I  have   worked
for) for  a couple  of hours of “being high is an idiotic choice that I will never
make. I will never use this drug,  nor any  other drug in the  future. (GE 2; Tr.
57-60, 74-76)
At  the  time  Applicant  completed  his  June  15,  2015  SF-86,  he  did  not  have  a
security  clearance.  However,  he  was  subsequently  granted  access  to  classified
information with a Secret security clearance in July 2015. (SOR; Tr. 60) Applicant took
and passed a drug test when he began working in June 2015. (Tr. 60)
In  his  June  11,  2018  SF-86,  which  Applicant  completed  when  he  sought  to
upgrade  his  clearance  from  Secret  to  Top  Secret,  he  disclosed  additional  drug  use.  It
was these disclosures that formed the basis for the majority of security concerns alleged
in  Applicant’s  SOR.  He  admitted  using marijuana  intermittently  from  May  2010 to  May
2018 “around a hundred” times, which included his admitted marijuana use in his June
15, 2015 SF-86. Additionally, he admitted using cocaine from April 2016 to March 2017
five  to  six  times;  using  MDMA  from  December  2016  to  April  2018  six  times;  using
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in August 2017 one time; using prescription medication
Hydrocodone  without  a  prescription  in  March  2017  three  times;  and  using  prescription
medication Adderall without a prescription from April 2017 to April 2018 four times. As
noted,  Applicant  previously  admitted  using  marijuana;  however,  he  continued  using
marijuana  after  being  granted  access  to  classified  information  in  July  2015  as  well
cocaine,  Ecstasy  or  MDMA,  LSD,  prescription  medication  Hydrocodone,  and
prescription medication Adderall. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.f; Tr. 69-70)
Applicant’s admitted drug use in his June 11, 2018 SF-86 is consistent with  his
previous  admitted  drug  use  in  his  June  15,  2015  SF-86,  and  subsequent  drug  use  he
described  in  his  March  12,  2019  Office  of  Personnel  Management  Personal  Subject
Interview (OPM PSI), his SOR Answer; and during his hearing testimony. (GE 2, GE 3;
SOR  Answer;  Tr.  24-48,  60-65,  67-68,  72-73)  Applicant  disclosed  his  drug  use  on  his
June 11, 2018 SF-86 to avoid being “vulnerable for blackmail.” (Tr. 72)
When  queried  by  Department  Counsel  why  he  did  not  cease  drug  use  after
becoming a full-time employee, Applicant stated:
I think I was still  immature. Coming out of college doesn’t just  –  there’s not
just a slick straight graduate and all of a sudden you’re a fully-developed
grown man. There are things that happen  along  the way that shape  your
character.  And unfortunately for  me,  I was somewhat sheltered, so I didn’t
get  to  experience  anything  –   any  real  negative  effects  until   later   on.  And
I’m sorry  that it happened too late,  but up until that point,  that’s –  that’s –  I
didn’t   get  any  experience.  That  was  –   I  formed  that  maturity   in   my  head
later. (Tr. 65-66, 76)
Applicant stated that he stopped using all drugs in May 2018. His marijuana use
up until that point was averaging, “. . . two to three times a week, so it wasn’t irregular
for  me to come home and  smoke on my balcony. And this day was similar  to what I’d
been doing the last year or so. I smoked. And then an hour or so later, I got a phone call
from my mom.  I decided  I didn’t want to talk to her ‘cause I was  high at the  time. And
just thought, you know, I’ll deal with it tomorrow.” (Tr. 29-31) Applicant’s mother left him
a voice mail telling him that his grandmother was hospitalized and she needed to talk to
him. He later realized other people were counting on him and that he needed to grow up
and  could  not  be  “an  irresponsible  college  kid  anymore.”  (Tr.  31-32,  34,  41,  68-71)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  his  drug  use  was  illegal  and  such  use  was  prohibited
under federal regulations. (Tr. 32-34, 71)
Applicant’s family and friends are aware of his past drug use and are supportive
of him remaining drug-free. He stated that he would remove himself from any situation
where drug use was present. (Tr. 34-35, 50-51) Applicant submitted a signed statement
of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that
any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.
(Tr.  48;  AE  A)  To  demonstrate  his  drug-free  status,  Applicant  submitted  two  negative
hair follicle drug tests dated January 24, 2020 and October 1, 2020, and stated that he
would  be  willing  to  take  random  drug  tests  in  the  future.  (Tr.  48-50;  AE  B,  AE  G)
Applicant has never been arrested, charged, or convicted for a drug-related offense. He
has  not  participated  in  any  voluntary  or  court-ordered  drug  rehabilitation  programs.
Applicant  accepted  responsibility  for  his  past  drug  abuse,  expressed  remorse,  and
stated that he has no desire or intention to use drugs in the future. (Tr. 49, 51-53)
Character Evidence
Applicant  submitted  five  reference  letters  from  a  cross  section  of  individuals  to
include  a  company  senior  manager,  a  company  staff  engineer,  a  coworker,  his  sister,
and  a  long-time  friend.  His  senior  manager  described  his  work  ethic,  integrity,
trustworthiness, and the significant contribution he makes towards the nation’s defense.
Applicant’s  coworker  provided  a  similar  favorable  endorsement.  Applicant’s  sister  and
long-time  friend  provided  favorable  character  assessments  supported  by  accounts  of
their  past  personal  interactions  with  him.  All  five  letters  are  supportive  of  granting
Applicant access to classified information. (AE C, AE H)
Applicant  also  provided  numerous  awards  that  he  received  from  2017  to  2020
and his performance appraisals for 2019, 2018, and 2016 as well as his current resume.
Applicant’s appraisals identify him as a top-shelf performer, who is a valued and trusted
company  employee.  (AE  D,  AE  E;  AE  F)  Applicant  discussed  his  accomplishments,
which  are  further  documented  in  his  performance  appraisals  and  awards.  (Tr.  19-24)
Apart  from  work,  which  lately  has  been  at  home,  he  spends  his  free  time  biking,  rock
climbing, watching sports, and playing video games. Applicant leads a healthy lifestyle
that is not consistent with drug use. (Tr. 54)

"Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency from about January 2006 until December 2018, and from about July 2016 until
December 2018 while holding a security clearance. The SOR further alleges that in March
2006,  August  2016,  and  November  2017  Applicant  was  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana. Applicant admits each of these allegations with explanations.
Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleges the marijuana-related allegations and
also alleges that Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI)
in May 2009. Applicant admits this allegation with an explanation. Applicant’s admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant, 34, is a contract specialist employed by a defense contractor since May
2009. He worked for the same defense contractor as a summer intern between May and
August 2008. He received his bachelor’s degree in 2009. He has held a security clearance
since August 2008. (GX 3; GX 4.)
Applicant  used  marijuana  recreationally  between  January  and  March  2006.  In
March  2006,  he  was  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana,  a  misdemeanor.  He
completed a drug education course and the charge was dismissed. (GX 3; Answer.)
In May 2009, Applicant was charged with DUI, a misdemeanor. He was admitted
into the state’s pre-trial alcohol education system and successfully completed a 10-class
alcohol intervention program. The DUI charge was dismissed in December 2009. (GX 3;
Answer.) Applicant asserted in his PSI that he never consumes alcohol before driving.
There is no record evidence of any additional alcohol-related charges or misconduct.
According  to  21  U.S.C.  §844,  simple  drug  possession,  to  include  marijuana,  is  a
misdemeanor under federal law. The amount required to constitute simple possession is
not delineated in the statute. A first-offender can be sentenced to a term of imprisonment
of not more than one year, a minimum of $1,000 fine, or both. However, if an offender is
convicted of simple possession after a prior drug-related offense has become final, the
offender can be charged with a felony simple possession offense.
In  2011,  the  state  where  Applicant  resides  decriminalized  marijuana.  While  still
technically illegal, possession of less than one half ounce of marijuana is treated as a civil
offense punishable by a fine. In 2012, the state enacted a law allowing certain individuals
legal  access  to  medical   marijuana.  According   to  the  state’s  Department  of  Consumer
Protection  (DCP)  website,  the  law  sets  forth  the  specific  medical   conditions   for  which
medical-marijuana use has been  approved. In order for a person to  legally use medical
marijuana, a physician  must  certify that the person has a medical  condition that qualifies
him or her for  a medical-marijuana registration certificate. The  person must  then make
application   to  the  DCP  for   a  medical-marijuana  certificate.  Without  such  a  certificate,
possession and use of marijuana remains illegal.
In July 2016, Applicant began smoking marijuana to help alleviate the pain from
flare-ups of a medical condition. The marijuana use also helped him reduce his prescribed
medications  which  have  serious  long-term-use  side  effects.  He  smoked  marijuana
approximately  20  times  between  July  2016  and  December  2018.  He  stopped  using
marijuana because he did not want to jeopardize his employment. Applicant has not made
application to the DCP for a medical-marijuana certificate. (GX 4.)
In  August  2016,  Applicant  and  his  friend  went  to  a  bar  in  a  neighboring  state.
Applicant’s friend drove, and was pulled over by the police after leaving a bar. The police
officer  asked Applicant  and his  friend if  there  is anything  in the  vehicle  that  the  officer
should know about. Applicant and his friend each surrendered approximately one gram
of marijuana. The officer gave them each a citation for $125 for possession of marijuana
and a summons to appear in court. Marijuana is decriminalized in this state. Applicant
hired an attorney who appeared on Applicant’s behalf.  The charge was deferred for 13
months  during  which  time  Applicant  was  required  not  to  be  cited  for  any  additional
misconduct. Applicant complied and the charge was dismissed. (GX 4.)
In November 2017, Applicant was pulled over in his state of residence for failure
to  maintain  his  lane.  According  to  Applicant,  the  officer  asked  Applicant  if  there  was
anything in the vehicle that the officer should know about, and Applicant surrendered a
bag  containing  approximately  one  or  two  grams  of  marijuana.  (GX  4.)  However,  the
officer’s  incident  report  states  that  the  officer’s  partner  approached  Applicant’s  vehicle
and observed “a few grams [of marijuana] in a jar on his backseat.” (GX 5.) The officer
issued  Applicant  a  summons  for  leaving  the  lane  of  travel  and  for  possession  of
marijuana,  one  ounce  or  less.  Applicant  appeared  in  court  and  the  two  charges  were
dismissed. (GX 4; GX 5.)
In December 2017, Applicant obtained a letter from his physician that stated that
the  physician  had  referred  Applicant  for  medical-marijuana  therapy  for  a  “recognized
medical condition.” The letter set forth Applicant’s diagnosed medical condition, however,
the  delineated  condition  is  not  included  in  the  list  of  medical  conditions  approved  for
medical-marijuana use. (GX 5.)
In his January 2019 personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant stated that he has
not used marijuana since December 2018, has no intention of future use of marijuana,
and  does  not  associate  with  anyone  who  uses  it.  In  his  November  2019  responses  to
interrogatories,  Applicant  stated  under  oath  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  illegal
substances in the future. (GX 4.)
However, Applicant did not make any assertions about his future intentions on the
use of marijuana in his answer to the SOR. Instead, Applicant referenced the December
2017  letter  from  his  physician  referring  Applicant  for  medical  marijuana  therapy.
Additionally, in his response to the FORM, Applicant discussed his medical condition and
set forth a list of side effects caused by his prescribed medications. He also attached two
photographs depicting the medical condition and a copy of the December 2017 letter from
his physician.
In his PSI, Applicant stated that he did not list his then ongoing marijuana use on
his June 2018 e-QIP because it was for “medical purposes” which was acceptable in his
state  of  residence.  In  response  to  Section  22  –  Police  Record  of  the  e-QIP,  Applicant
listed  his  August  2016  possession of  marijuana charge  by citation number  and docket
number and stated that the case was dismissed in December 2016. He checked that the
offense involved alcohol or drugs, but did not disclose the actual charge of possession of
marijuana.  He  listed  his  November  2017  possession  of  marijuana  charge  in  the  same
manner. There is no evidence that Applicant reported either the 2016 or 2017 possession
of marijuana charges to his facility security officer.

"Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since July 2017. He is applying for a security clearance for the first
time. He earned a bachelor’s degree in  2017, and  he has taken post-graduate classes
for a master’s degree. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at
16-17, 20-21, 26; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  was  raised  in  a  family  where  illegal  drug  use  was  commonplace.  His
grandfather  offered  him  marijuana  when  he  was  about  seven  years  old.  Applicant
declined  all  drug  use  until  2008  when  he  was  about  17  years  old  and  smoked
marijuana.  His  marijuana  use  slowly  increased  until  about  2012,  when  he  started
smoking  marijuana  almost  every  day.  He  used  illegal  drugs  with  various  family
members, including his father, brothers, and sister. Applicant realized that he would pay
less  for  the  marijuana  if  he  bought  larger  quantities.  He  bought  marijuana  from  his
uncle,  who  grew  marijuana.  Applicant  frequently  sold  the  excess  marijuana  to  friends
and  neighbors.  The  profit  from  selling  marijuana  helped  offset  his  costs  for  his  own
marijuana as well as some other living expenses. (Tr. at 12-21; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 1, 2)
In  about  2011,  Applicant  used  Adderall  without  a  prescription  to  help  him  focus
while he was writing a paper for school. From about 2011 through June 2015, he used
the  following  hallucinogenic  controlled  substances:  LSD  (lysergic  acid  diethylamide),
mushrooms,  and  DMT  (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine).  He  used  LSD  about  three  times,
mushrooms  twice,  and  DMT  about  eleven  times.  He  bought  the  LSD,  was  given  the
mushrooms, and manufactured the DMT.  (Tr. at 15; Applicant’s  response to SOR; GE
1, 2)
DMT is found in a number of plant materials and can be extracted or synthetically
produced in clandestine labs.1  Applicant and his brother shared an apartment from 2011
to 2012. In 2011, Applicant’s brother wanted to manufacture DMT using plant materials
and information obtained through the Internet. Applicant was worried his brother would
burn  the  apartment  down  or  poison  someone,  and  he  helped  his  brother  with  the
process. Applicant never manufactured or used DMT after 2011. (Tr. at 15; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  went  to  a  career  fair  in  about  March  2016.  Applicant  and  his  friend
talked with  a recruiting agent from a government agency. His friend told  him  that if he
wanted  to  work  for  the  government  agency,  Applicant  would  have  to  completely  stop
taking illegal drugs. Applicant realized that he would graduate in a year, and he needed
to make major changes in his life. He gave or threw away all of his drug paraphernalia.
He  gave  all  of  his  marijuana  to  his  father.  He  told  the  one  person  he  regularly  sold
marijuana  to  that  he  would  have  to  buy  his  marijuana  elsewhere.  He  told  all  of  his
friends  and  family  members  that  he  stopped  smoking  marijuana.  He  still  has  contact
with family members who use drugs, but if he sees any drug use, he leaves. Applicant
has not used any illegal drugs since about March 2016, and he does not intend to use
any in the future. (Tr. at 14-25, 27; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)

Applicant gave an extremely detailed accounting of his illegal drug activities in a
May  2017  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86).  He  also  provided
extensive information during his background interview, in his response to the SOR, and
during his hearing. I found him to be forthcoming and credible. (GE 1, 2)

"Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  used  heroin  with  varying
frequency from about December 2014 until about September 2018; amphetamines from
2015 until August 2018; benzodiazepines in August 2018; and marijuana from 2011 until
2018. The SOR also alleges that Applicant was arrested and charged with possession
and use of drug-related objects in December 2014 and that she tested positive for opiates
and  benzodiazepines  in  August  2018.  The  SOR  further  alleges  that  Applicant  was
required by her employer to receive treatment beginning in August 2018 for conditions
diagnosed as amphetamine and opioids use disorders, but after failing her urinalysis in
September 2018 by testing positive for opiates, she was terminated from her employment
and  she  discontinued  treatment.  Applicant  admits  each  of  these  allegations  with
explanations.
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified three of her responses
regarding illegal drug use on her 2019 e-QIP; that she was terminated by her employer
in September 2018 for violation of rules and is not eligible for rehire; that she falsified the
reason  for  leaving  this  employment  on  her  2019  e-QIP;  and  that  she  falsified  material
facts about her drug use and her reason for leaving her employment in 2018 during her
personal subject interview (PSI) in April 2019. Applicant admits each of these allegations.
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant, 27, is an associate technical professional in test engineering employed
by  a  defense  contractor  since  January  2019.  She  received  her  bachelor’s  degree  in
mechanical engineering in 2016. She and her husband married in 2016. This is her first
application for security clearance. (GX 2.)
The information in the record regarding Applicant’s drug abuse is derived from two
sources:  Applicant’s  treatment  records  wherein  she  provided  written  information
regarding her drug abuse, and the affirmed summary of the statements she made during
her PSI. The information regarding her 2014 drug-related arrest is derived from these two
sources and her FBI rap sheet. Applicant’s reporting of the length and frequency of her
use  of  marijuana,  opiates,  amphetamines/methamphetamine,  and  other  drugs  is
inconsistent within her two accounts. After considering the record to include Applicant’s
admissions to the SOR allegations, I make the following findings of fact:

Applicant was arrested in December 2014 while at a motel with her then-
boyfriend  now-husband  after  injecting  heroin.  She  was  charged  with
possession  and  use  of  drug-related  objects,  a  misdemeanor,  and
possession  of  a  Schedule  I  controlled  substance  (heroin),  a  felony.  The
felony  charge  was  not  prosecuted  and  the  misdemeanor  charge  was
dismissed;
Applicant
benzodiazepines with her boyfriend/husband;
first  used  heroin,  amphetamines/methamphetamine,  and
In August 2018, Applicant was late for work because she was passed out
in  her  car  in  the  parking  lot.  Applicant  had  been  injecting  heroin  and
methamphetamine  throughout  the  previous  night.  Applicant  told  her
supervisor that she had been injecting methamphetamine, her supervisor
called the paramedics, and Applicant was hospitalized;
After  this  incident,  as  a  condition  of  continued  employment,  Applicant’s
employer  required  her  to  complete  a  treatment  program.  Applicant
underwent  an  evaluation,  was  diagnosed  with  amphetamine  and  opioids
use disorders, and was prescribed outpatient treatment which she entered
on August 13, 2018;
While  in  treatment,  Applicant  tested  positive  for  opiates  during  a  random
drug screening conducted by her employer. She denied any illegal drug use,
stating that she did not understand how she could have tested positive, but
was terminated from her employment. She discontinued treatment;
Applicant  intentionally  failed  to  disclose  her  illegal  drug  use  and  her
treatment on her 2019 e-QIP and initially during her PSI;
Applicant intentionally failed to disclose her termination from employment
on her 2019 e-QIP and initially during her PSI;
Applicant has not participated in any additional drug treatment;
Applicant  repeatedly  lied  to  the  investigator  during  her  PSI  until  the
investigator confronted her with the information about her illegal drug use,
drug treatment, and termination from employment.
Applicant stated in  her PSI that she has not illegally used drugs since she entered
treatment in August 2018, reiterating that she did not understand  how  she tested positive
in   September  2018  while   in  treatment.   She  asserted  that  there  is  no  likelihood  of  any
recurrence  of illegal  drug use. She stated  that she no  longer uses any illegal drugs and
does not associate with anyone who does. She further stated that she and  her husband
have    agreed that they   “do not need to use drugs anymore and    they have    heard horror
stories about people who have used drugs.”
In  her  responses  to  DOHA’s  interrogatories,  Applicant  stated,  “While  I  have  not
completed  treatment,  I  have  not  returned  to  any  substance  abuse.  Moving  from  my
previous residence and contacts . . . helped the situation greatly.” Applicant also asserted
that she was “very forthcoming” during her PSI,  further stating that her illegal drug use
and  related  conduct  were  mistakes  that  she  has  moved  past  and  that  she  hopes  her
“honesty  and  good  behavior  since  are  taken  into  account”  in  her  security  clearance
determination.

"Applicant  admitted  the  three  SOR  allegations  contained  in  SOR  Paragraph  1,
without further elaboration or explanation. (Item 2) His admissions are incorporated into
these findings of fact.
Applicant  is  24  years  old.  He  is  unmarried  and  has  no  children.  He  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in May 2019. He has no military or federal civil service, and has never
held a security clearance. He began his current employment as an analyst with a defense
contractor in May 2019, and is seeking national security eligibility in connection with that
position. (Item 3.)
Applicant completed his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) on
May 9, 2019. In response to questions in Section 23 regarding illegal use of drugs or drug
activity, he disclosed that he had used THC/marijuana/cannabis three to four times per
week,  from  October  2013  to  May  2019,  for  medical  use  to  treat  insomnia  and  anxiety
instead of using a prescription drug, which had formerly given him unpleasant side effects.
He further declared that he intended to continue using the drug in the future because it
was legal in the local jurisdiction where he lived and it improves his health. (Item 3.)
On  July  1,  2019,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  for  the  Office  of
Personnel  Management  (OPM).  He  confirmed  the  accuracy  of  his  SF-86  statements
concerning  drug  use,  and  added  that  he  also  smoked  the  marijuana  because  he  had
depression and ADHD. He said that he had undergone counseling for three to four years
during high school for depression, anxiety, ADHD, and insomnia, and his counselor was
supportive  of  his  marijuana  use  for  these  medical  conditions.  He  did  not  report  any
counseling  after  his  2015  graduation  from  high  school.  He  said  he  had  purchased
marijuana from dispensaries, smoke shops, and a college friend. He also obtained it from
friends when they shared and smoked it together. (Item 4.)
Concerning his intention to continue using marijuana, as expressed in his SF-86,
Applicant confirmed that his prior statements were accurate, and that he continued to use
marijuana as described during May and June 2019. He told the investigator that he was
aware that it is illegal to use illegal drugs or controlled substances while employed with
the Federal government and that he respects the law. He stated that he would stop using
marijuana  if  he  needed  to  for  his  job  with  the  defense  contractor  or  to  get  a  security
clearance, and claimed that he could not be blackmailed or coerced due to his drug use.
(Item 4.)
The  record  contains  no  evidence  concerning  Applicant’s  job  performance,
trustworthiness,  character  in  a  professional  setting,  or  track  record  with  respect  to
handling sensitive information and observation of security procedures. I was unable to
evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since he elected to have his
case decided without a hearing.

"Applicant is a 36-year-old project manager who has served in the same capacity
since  2010.  She  enjoys  her  work  and  excels  in  performing  her  duties.  Applicant  was
raised in an area where she was surrounded by military and U.S. Department of Defense
(DOD) personnel her entire life. (FORM, Item 2 at 2) She has earned a bachelor’s and
master’s degree. Applicant lives with a cohabitant. She has no children.
In  September  2008  on  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (QNSP),
Applicant  disclosed  that  she  had  used  marijuana  from  June  2007  until  April  2008.
Subsequently, in about January 2009, she was granted access to classified information.
Over the years, Applicant received annual briefings and other security training reminders
of the requirements for maintaining a security clearance, including emails in November
2012 and January 2015, advising all employees that marijuana remained federally illegal,
despite  some  non-federal  jurisdictions  decriminalizing  the  drug.  Applicant  recently
claimed she quit using marijuana between the time she was granted such access in 2009
until marijuana was legalized in her state, about four years or less later. Her marijuana
abuse  then  continued  despite  federal  law  and  her  possession  of  a  federally-granted
security clearance. (FORM, Item 2 at 1)
In her December 2014 QNSP, Applicant disclosed that she used marijuana from
January 2009 through November 2018. In so doing, she noted that marijuana was legal
where  she  was  located.  (FORM,  Item  3)  She  also  disclosed  that  she  intended  to  use
marijuana  again  in  the  future.  Learning  of  her  federally  illegal  drug  use,  the  Facility
Security Officer (FSO) filed an incident report detailing these facts. The FSO noted that
prior to her QNSP submission, this information had not been previously reported.
In May 2019, Applicant was interviewed by investigators. She confirmed she had
used marijuana as recently as March 2019. Indeed, she stated that she used the federally
illegal substance about every other month, and intended to continue to do so in the future.
Shortly  after  the  interview,  Applicant  altered  her  earlier  stance,  stating  that  continued
marijuana use was “fairly likely” and “not out of the question,” and noting that she “fully
understands the significance and gravity of the position of trust the United States would
place on me by granting a security clearance, and pledge to abide by federal law and
DOD regulations.” (FORM, Item 7)
In the SOR, it was alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency
from  about  June  2007  and  at  least  March  2019,  an  allegation  she  admitted.  She  also
admitted that this marijuana use took place despite her having been granted access to
classified information in January 2009. These admitted facts were the basis for security
concerns under the guidelines for drug involvement and for personal conduct.
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  minimalized  her  past  marijuana  use,
characterizing it as “an ‘anomaly,’” “infrequent,” and “irregular.” (FORM, Item 2 at 1) She
stated that she now fully appreciates the significance and the gravity of the Government’s
prohibition of illegal drug use by those granted a security clearance. She vowed in that
April  2020   SOR  response  that  it  is  now   her  intent  to   abstain  from  all  illegal  use  of
substances  and   acknowledged  “that  any  future  involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for
revocation   of  my  national  security  eligibility.”   (FORM,   Item  2  at  1)  She  explained  that
because she considered her  marijuana use to  be as  minimal as her  handling of secure
documents,  she  “failed to  recall  the requirement to report” her  marijuana  use  despite her
company’s annual security briefings.  (FORM, Item 2 at 3)
As an employee, Applicant excels in her work. Over the past five years, her annual
performance  appraisals  have  been  positive,  describing  her  as  hard  working  and
dedicated.  (FORM,  Item  2  at  4)  In  2019,  her  strengths  were  described  as:  “Reliable,
efficient, and organized; Self-starting; Confident in technical abilities/knowledge; Thinks
outside the box and finds ways to get things done. . . . [She] is an asset to the [ -- ] team,
and her peers look up to her in every aspect of the job.” (FORM, Item 2 at 4) She does
not believe her federally illegal marijuana use defines her as a person. (Response to the

deliberately failed to disclose his use of marijuana in high school and from about 2016
to  about  November  2018.  Applicant  admitted  to  “unknowingly  answering  the  question
wrong.""  I  considered  Applicant’s  response  a  denial  of  SOR  ¶  2.a.  Applicant’s  SOR
admissions  and  those  at  his  hearing  are  incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high school in 2004, and received an associate’s degree in computer systems in 2008.
He  has  never  been  married.  He  has  a  four-year-old  daughter  and  he  shares  custody
with her mother. His grandmother also lives with him. (Tr. 37-38)
Applicant  has  been  working  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal  contractor  and
clearance sponsor, since October 2018. He submitted his first SCA in November 2018,
and was granted interim eligibility for access to top-secret information in January 2019.
In his responses to Question 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his 2018
SCA,  Applicant  denied  any  illegal  use,  purchase,  receiving,  or  handling  of  drugs  or
controlled  substances  in  the  last  seven  years.  (GE  1)  On  January  8,  2019,  Applicant
was interviewed by a background investigator from the Office of Personal Management
(OPM).  During  the  interview,  he  disclosed  having  financial  issues,  driving  under  the
influence  (DUI)  in  2011  and  2015,  and  that  he  was  terminated  from  a  job  in  August
2018. He deliberately failed to disclose his illegal use, purchase, receiving, or handling
of drugs or controlled substances (marijuana) in the last seven years. (GE 3)
On  April  8,  2019,  Applicant  was  re-interviewed  and  confronted  with  a  2016
positive  test  result  for  marijuana  use  while  he  was  attending  court-mandated  alcohol
treatment  following  his  2015  DUI  conviction.  Applicant  was  on  probation  between
January 2016 and January 2018, and he was required to attend alcohol treatment. (Tr.
46 -47) Applicant admitted his use of marijuana in 2016, and disclosed  that he started
using  marijuana  in  high  school.  He  initially  claimed  he  used  marijuana  only  about  six
times for experimental purposes.
During the April 9, 2019 interview, Applicant also disclosed that he began using
medical marijuana in 2017, when it became legal in his home state. (The state’s Medical
Cannabis  Commission  (SMCC)  became  operational  and  sales  began  in  December
2017). He claimed he has not used any illegal drugs in the last seven years because he
purchases the marijuana through a valid state prescription. (GE 3) Applicant submitted
a  certification  from  the  SMCC  indicating  that  he  is  a  qualified  patient  for  the  period  of
September 29, 2020, through September 29, 2021. (AE 2) Applicant explained that he
did not disclose his marijuana use in his 2018 SCA because he obtained the marijuana
legally.
Applicant  uses  marijuana  every  other  day,  as  needed,  to  help  him  sleep,  to
control  his  anxiety,  depression,  and  for  his  self-care  and  mental  health,  which  is
extremely  important  to  him.  He  obtained  and  used  marijuana  after  he  was  granted  an
interim top-secret clearance in January 2019. Applicant told the investigator that he was
aware that the use of marijuana is against federal law, but he believes that it does not
make any sense for him not to use marijuana if it’s allowed under state law. He told the
interviewer that his most recent use of medical marijuana was in April 2019. (GE 3)
Applicant  noted  that  he  has  been  using  marijuana  legally  and  sees  a  doctor  to
remain compliant with his state laws. He  claimed his “medicine” is only for use outside
of  work.  He  does  not  believe  the  Federal  government  should  exclude  people  who  are
getting treatment from being able to work for the Government. He stated that if he is to
be judged, his on-the-job performance should be what defines him. (Tr. 37)
Applicant believes that he is a good, caring person, and a loving father. He has
overcome  adversity  in  his  life  and,  like  many,  has  mental  health  struggles  that  should
not define him. He believes that there are a lot of people out there that need the same
treatment. He believes the Federal government is discriminating against him and others
because of his mental health issues.

Applicant  has  worked
Information  Technology  (IT)  or  on  computers
professionally for over 13 years. He had not been able to get a job in his geographical
area  because  he  did  not  possess  a  security  clearance.  In  October  2018,  his  dream
became a reality when he was hired for his current job, which is within four miles of his
home.  Before  that,  he  was  commuting  as  far  as  50  miles  each  way,  or  had  jobs  that
required him to travel. He loves his current job and his coworkers. He believes that he is
doing a great job for his employer and customers. He would like to continue working for
his employer.
At hearing, Applicant expanded on the statements he made to the investigator in
2019. He testified that he has been using marijuana on and off (or every once in a while
–  or  monthly)  with  friends  since  high  school  (2004),  to  present.  He  also  purchases  or
obtains marijuana from friends on a monthly basis. (Tr. 48 - 52) He has stopped using
marijuana a few times, but the only occasions he remembered doing so were both while
attending alcohol treatment classes after his 2011 and 2015 DUIs. He used marijuana
about seven times  in between the end of the alcohol  treatment classes and before he
received  his  state  MCC  certification  in  2017.  (Tr.  54  –  55)  He  admitted  that  he  used
marijuana during the seven-year period before he submitted his November 2018 SCA.
He told the Government interviewer that he intended to continue using marijuana in the
future.  At  hearing,  he  was  evasive  and  failed  to  clearly  and  convincingly  commit  to
discontinue using marijuana.
Applicant continued to use marijuana after he was granted an interim top-secret
clearance in January 2019. He believed it was okay for him to do so because it is legal
for  him  to  use  marijuana  under  state  law.  At  hearing  he  stated:  “If  I  can't  have  a
clearance  because  of  that,  then  I  will  take  my  mental  health”.  Applicant  presented  no
documentary evidence to show that he sought or received any medical or psychological
treatment  or  counseling  for  substance  abuse,  other  than  the  alcohol  treatment  he
received after his DUIs in 2011 and 2015. Applicant used marijuana the day before his
hearing. (Tr. 63 - 65)

"Applicant  admitted  the  sole  allegation  in  the  SOR  (¶  1.a).  Her  admission  is
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old. She and her husband have been married for 16 years,
though  a  divorce  is  pending.  They  have  three  children.  (Tr.  42-44)  Applicant  has  a
bachelor’s degree in biotechnology and has numerous professional certifications. (GE 1;
AE  C)  She  is  also  pursuing  a  master’s  degree  in  “medical  cannabis  science  and
therapeutics” at a school of pharmacy in her home state. (GE 1; AE C; Tr. 40-42)
Applicant  has  held  a  variety  of  government  contracting  positions  since  about
2006,  supporting  various  federal  agencies  and  departments,  including  DOD.  She  has
held a security clearance since 2007. Her employment history since 2006 is detailed in
her SCA. (GE 1 at 13-22; AE C; Tr. 26-29, 61).
Applicant  was  working  for  the  State  Department  when  she  took  a  job  with  a
cleared employer near her home in October 2016. After she was laid off from that job in
June  2017,  she  was  then  unemployed  until  March  2018,  when  she  began  working  for
her  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor,  a  defense  contractor.  (GE  1;  Tr.  26-29,
55-58)  She  currently  works  from  home  because  of  the  pandemic,  and  has  an  annual
salary of about $137,000. (Tr. 62-64)
In 2015, Applicant began experiencing immense joint pain and difficulty walking.
In December 2015, she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). She testified that
the condition was sufficiently painful and debilitating that she was unable to  work for a
period of time. She began pursuing treatment options, and was prescribed prednisone
and methotrexate, a cancer drug with significant side effects. (Tr. 35-37, 44, 49-51; GE
2; AE C)
Applicant  lives  in  a  state  that  has  a  medical  marijuana  program.  In  April  2017,
following consultation with her physicians, she applied for and received approval in her
home state to use medical marijuana. (Tr. 30-31, 44-45; AE C; AE E))
Applicant  provided  documentation  from  her  physician  confirming  her  condition
and the fact that it was “amenable to treatment with medical cannabis” under her home
state’s regulations. The documentation states, however, that “[t]his is not a prescription.”
(AE  F)  Applicant  also  provided  her  medical  marijuana  Patient  ID  card,  issued  by  her
state’s medical cannabis regulatory agency. (AE F)
Additional  documentation  from  Applicant’s  medical  cannabis  treatment  facility
noted  that  she  has  been  compliant  with  state  laws  regarding  the  use  of  medical
cannabis  for  her  condition.  The  letter  acknowledged,  however,  that  “[a]lthough  [State]
recognizes  the  recommendation  of  medical  cannabis  for  various  conditions,  our
company does understand that this is still not recognized by Federal agencies.” (AE E)
Applicant  began  using  marijuana  for   medical  purposes  in   December  2017.  By
that time, she was unemployed  and  was not actively sponsored for  a  clearance. (Tr.  55-
59,  61-62)  She  reported  her  medical  marijuana  use  (from  December  2017  to  March
2018) on her March 2018  SCA.  She noted that she  was an “approved medical  cannabis
user”  in   her  home  state.  She  said   she  used  marijuana   “as  needed   for   [a]   medical
condition:  oral  tincture  and   pills  mostly,  and/or   dried   flower.”  She  noted   that  she
intended to  use the drug in   the future,  and   explained   “I am currently  trying to wean off
prescription cancer medication and cannabis is helping  me do this.”  (GE  1 at 38; Tr.  45-
46)
At  the  time  of  her  August  2018  background  interview,  Applicant  typically  used
medical  marijuana  two  to  five  times  a  week,  always  after  work  or  on  weekends.  She
acknowledged using marijuana while possessing at least an interim security clearance.
(GE 2 at 2-3)
In  February  2020,  before  the  SOR  was  issued,  a  DOHA  Department  Counsel
(DC)  e-mailed  Applicant  about  her  case.  The  DC  noted
that  Applicant  had
acknowledged  in  her  interview  summary  that  she  used  marijuana  pursuant  to  a  valid
medical  prescription  in  her  home  state.  He  noted  further  that  “while  some  states  have
legalized marijuana, possessing marijuana remains illegal under Federal law. Thus, the
use  of  marijuana,  even  in  states  where  doing  to  [sic]  is  legal,  is  incompatible  with
holding a DOD clearance.” (GE 3 at 1-2).
The  DC  then  offered  Applicant  an  opportunity  to  declare  an  intention  to  forego
future  medical  marijuana  use,  and  noted  that  if  she  were  to  do  so,  “you  will  establish
eligibility for a clearance.” (GE 3 at 2) He then advised that if Applicant were to “declare
that  you  intend  to  continue  to  use  marijuana,  or  any  other  substance  whose  use  is
illegal under Federal law, you will not be granted a clearance at this juncture.” He wrote
that  if  she  chose  to  continue  her  use  of  marijuana,  her  case  would  then  proceed  to  a
hearing  before  a  DOHA  administrative  judge,  and  she  would  have  the  opportunity  to
appear and present evidence. (GE 3 at 2)
Applicant  responded  and  elected  the  latter  option,  though  her  response  was
silent as to her future intentions as to marijuana use. (GE 3 at 2) The SOR was issued
in April 2020. During her testimony, Applicant acknowledged the e-mail exchange, and
confirmed  her  response,  and  her  awareness  of  the  negative  impact  on  her  clearance
application. (Tr. 74)
At  her  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  she  now  uses  medical  marijuana  about
one to three times a week, typically on the weekends. She used medical marijuana as
the weekend before the hearing. She confirmed a future intention to continue doing so.
(Tr. 76-78) (“I will continue to use medical cannabis for medical purposes, and weaning
off of methotrexate,” while continuing to pursue other RA medications. (Tr. 64-68))
Applicant  has  not  used  marijuana  recreationally  or  for  any  other  purpose.  (She
tried marijuana in college about 30 years ago  and did not use it again until December
2017).  (Tr.  47-49)).  Applicant  typically  consumes  the  medical  marijuana  in  capsule  or
tincture form (dissolved in alcohol). (Tr. 52-53) She uses it only at home, and never at or
before work. (Tr. 54) She takes care not to drive under the influence of marijuana. (Tr.
34-35, 54, 60-61) She gets the marijuana from a legal dispensary, and does not grow or
distribute it herself. (Tr. 72, 78-79) She confirmed that she uses marijuana or cannabis,
beyond cannabidiol (CBD). (Tr. 75-76)
Applicant  testified  that  she  considers  treatment  options  for  her  RA  other  than
medical  marijuana  “all  the  time.”  (Tr.  59-60)  She  remains  under  the  care  of  her
physicians,  including  a  lead  physician  at  a  pain-management  practice,  and  a
rheumatologist. They are aware of her medical marijuana use, and see no evidence of
substance  abuse.  (AE  C;  AE  E)  Applicant  testified  that  she  uses  medical  marijuana
under  their  consultation.  (Tr.  32-33)  Applicant  testified  that  she  uses  the  medical
cannabis  “just  like  I  would  any  other  prescribed  medication,”  for  pain  relief.  (Tr.  31)
Applicant  testified  further  that  her  RA  is  chronic,  and  worsening.  She  remains  on
painkillers that allow her to walk and function. (Tr. 36-37)
Applicant  was  assessed  for  substance  abuse  by  a  drug  counseling  center,  and
did not fit the criteria for a diagnosis, though the center did recommend counseling. At
the time of the hearing, she had not pursued counseling, but would commit to it if it were
recommended in this forum. (Tr. 37-38, 69-72; AE E)
Applicant  has  not  been  charged  with  any  drug-related  criminal  offense.  (Tr.  79)
She  testified  that  she  is  aware  of  state  laws  in  her  home  state  and  does  not  violate
them.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  she  was  “very  well  versed”  with  the  fact  that
marijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance under Federal law. Recognizing
the  “contradictory  nature”  of  state  and  Federal  law,  Applicant  nevertheless  asserted  a
desire  to  “be  up  front  and  transparent  and  navigate  this  to  the  best  that  I  can  without
encroaching on my principles and how I want to manage my own health. And it is a very
difficult place for me to be in.” (Tr. 73; Tr. 76)
Applicant  testified  that  she  believes  she  is  regarded  at  work  as  reliable,
trustworthy,  experienced,  and  knowledgeable.  There  has  been  no  negative  impact  on
her work performance or quality, her integrity or her ethics. She believes  she provides
an important service to her government customer and the important work that they do.
She  understands  the  importance  of  confidentiality  and  integrity  and  is  proud  and
privileged to contribute to the defense community. (Tr. 32, 380-39; AE C)

has  known   Applicant  since  2007   when  they   worked  together  for   two  years  on  a  large
project.   He   also  served  as  a  career  mentor.   Mr.  N  attested  that  Applicant  made  a
significant  contribution  and   was  a  conscientious  and  talented  employee  who  he  could
count  on  to   perform.   He   attested  to  her   sound   judgment  and   attention  to   protecting
sensitive  government  information.  Mr.  N  is aware  of  Applicant’s  medical   condition  and
her legal use of medical   marijuana to treat it. She “remains as reliable and  trustworthy
as [he] knew her to be” when they worked together. (AE D)
Mr. W is a retired Army officer who currently works as a program manager for the

issues in the case. He was a supervisor and co-worker of Applicant’s from 2000 to 2006
at  a factory that manufactured frozen dairy  products. Applicant  was  involved  in quality
control, inventory, and shipping. Mr. W and his team “placed great trust in her ability to
document, maintain, and manage proprietary information.” She has excellent judgment,
trustworthiness, and  responsibility. Mr W is aware of Applicant’s medical  condition and
her  legal  use  of  medical  marijuana  to  treat it,  and he believes  her  worthy of  holding  a
clearance while under proper medical care. (AE D)
Mr. S and Ms. F are lifelong friends of Applicant’s. Their families know each other
well.  Both  are  familiar  with  the  SOR  and  the  issues  in  the  case.  Applicant  is  a  caring

She is focused and detail-oriented. She is trustworthy and “unimpeachably honest.” Her
integrity and honesty are “beyond reproach,” and they both highly recommends that she
be granted a clearance. (AE D)

"Applicant, age 40, has never married nor had children. He earned a high school
diploma in 1999, a bachelor’s degree in  2003, and  a master’s degree in  2005. He has
been employed as a software engineer by three different defense contractors from 2005
through present. He has worked for his current employer since September 2017. He has
maintained a DOD security clearance since 2006. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant used and purchased psilocybin mushrooms approximately two to three
times per year from May 2012 through late summer of 2017. He estimated that he used
them  no more than a  dozen times  during that  period.  His  use  occurred while  in social
settings, such as parties and music or other festivals. He usually purchased one bag of
mushrooms  during a festival that he attended from “various people” at the festival. He
spent approximately $30 per bag, which typically consisted of four “small” mushrooms.
He  generally  used  at  least  half  of  the  mushrooms  at  the  festival,  and  then  saved  any
leftover  mushrooms  for  use  at  a  later  time.  The  SOR  did  not  allege  facts  about  his
mushroom purchases so I will consider them only to evaluate mitigation and the whole
person concept. (SOR Answer; Item 2 at 24-25; Item 3 at 4, 11)
Applicant reported his mushroom use on his April 2017 SCA. He further discussed
it during his August 2018 security clearance interview (SI), in his March 2020 response
to interrogatories (ROI), and in his SOR answer. He attributed his first use of mushrooms
to being depressed over a breakup. He  continued  to use them because it was “kind of
fun.”  He  explained  that  he  never  “consciously  decided”  to  stop  using  mushrooms,  but
“they  just  hold  so  little  influence  in  my  life  I  don’t  actively  seek  them.”  When  using
mushrooms, he feels euphoric and sees colors and shapes differently. He has never been
diagnosed as drug dependent. (Item 3 at 5, 6, 11).
Applicant  gave  varied  responses  about  his  future  intent  with  respect  to  using
mushrooms. In his SCA, he stated that he had no intent to use them in the future because
“they are difficult for me to acquire.” During his SI, Applicant stated that it was “possible”
that  he  might  use  mushrooms  in  the  future.  He  described  his  mushroom  use  as
“manageable   and   controlled.” He   stated that he did not believe that his mushroom use
was a habit or “bad for  him.”  He  admitted that it  was “not good judgment”  to use illegal
drugs  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  However,   when   asked  if  a  person  that
demonstrates poor judgment should hold a security clearance, he responded that there
are “levels of poor judgment.” He  then explained  that he  used mushrooms in  a “controlled
environment”   without  harming  himself  or   negatively  impacting  anyone  else.   He   denied
having  knowledge   of  his  current  employer’s  drug-use  policy.  In  his  ROI,   Applicant
answered “No” to whether he had intentions of using mushrooms in the future. (Item 2 at
25; Item 3 at 8, 12)
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  denied  ever  having  stated  that  he  “intend[ed]  to
continue to use mushrooms in the future,” as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. However, he admitted
“I can’t promise I’ll never use [mushrooms] again.” He acknowledged that “ADDICTION
is  bad,  regardless  of  whether  the  addiction  is  something  legal  or  illegal.”  However,  he
denied having an “addiction problem” given that the frequency of his mushroom use was
“at the most frequent” only three times in a year. Applicant asserted that he has proven
himself “very trustworthy” and “loyal” to the defense of the United States because he was
so forthcoming about his mushroom use (which he referred to as an “indiscretion”). (Item

"Applicant  is  26  years  old.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  is  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  as  a  Project  Engineering  Specialist.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a
security clearance in connection with his employment.  Applicant has no military service.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has  used  controlled  substances  that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant admits each of the four allegations under this guideline.  He attended
college  from  August  2012  to  May  2018.  While  in  college,  Applicant’s  curiosity  and
desire  to  fit  in  socially  with  his  classmates  caused  him  to  use  illegal  drugs.  He
explained that his decision to use illegal drugs was not a spur of the moment decision,
but  rather  an  informed  decision  with  months  of  research  behind  it.  He  used  and
purchased  marijuana  with  varying  frequencies  from  approximately  January  2017  to
approximately July 2019.  He used cocaine on one occasion in about October 2017.  He
also used ecstasy from about March 2014 to August 2016.  Applicant was hired by his
current  employer  in  July  2019.  He  is  currently  awaiting  his  employment  start  date
contingent  on  the  outcome  of  his  security  clearance  application.  (Government  Exhibit
2.)
Applicant  used  marijuana  one  to  two  times  a  week  on  average  from  January
2014 through July 2018, by smoking it or edibles while with friends in college at his or at
their  apartments.  He  then  used  it  three  more  times,  the  last  use  occurred  in  March
2019.
In  total,  he  believes  he  has  used  marijuana  300  to  350  times.  From  January
2017  to  July  2019,  he  would  purchase  marijuana  at  times  every  month  or  two  from
dispensaries because it was legal in the state.  Applicant stated that he used marijuana
to decompress from a high academic workload or a long day at work.  He explained that
it was a replacement to consuming alcohol, as he is allergic to alcohol, and he does not
like the way it makes him feel.  (Government Exhibit 2.)
During his interview with the authorized DoD investigator on November 12, 2019,
Applicant stated that he last used marijuana in March 2019.  Applicant used marijuana
recreationally with friends.  He also remembers purchasing marijuana for his brother on
one  occasion  in  June  or  July  2019,  when  his  brother  did  not  have  his  debit  card.
Applicant  also  admitted  that  he  has  used  Adderall  without  a  prescription  on  one
occasion  in  2015  or   2016.    On  that  occasion,  a  college  friend  offered   it   to  him.
(Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant used ecstasy from March 2014 to about August 2016.  A college friend
introduced  him  to  it.  His  friend  would  acquire  it,  and  Applicant  normally  used  it  when
they attended music festivals.  Applicant was told by his friends that when attending a
music festival he should use ecstasy to  get the most out of the experience.  Applicant
last used ecstasy in August 2016.  (Government Exhibits 1 and 2.)
In  October  2017,  Applicant  used  cocaine  on  one  occasion  with  college  friends.
Applicant was drinking at a party, when cocaine was offered to him.  He stated that he
used it due to peer pressure from friends at the party where everyone else was using it.
(Government Exhibits 1 and 2.)
Applicant  states  that  he  no  longer  associates  with  any   of  his  college  friends  or
anyone who uses illegal drugs.  He does not intend to use any illegal drug in the future.
He  stated that the marijuana  was always a temporary activity that he only planned  to do
while  in  college.  (Government Exhibit 2.)   Since graduating from  college  in  May 2018,
however,  Applicant  continued  his  marijuana  on  at  least  three   more   occasions.    He
stated  that  he  used  it   while  visiting  with  friends  he  had  not   seen  in   a  long   time.     He
regrets this use.   (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
Applicant  argues  that  he  could  have  said  nothing  about  his  drug  use  on  his
security clearance application, and the DoD would only be aware of one transaction for
purchasing  marijuana  after  it  was  legalized  for  recreational  use.  Rather  than
deliberately lie on  his application, he chose to disclose his extensive drug use history.

attempting to obtain national security eligibility in connection with his employment in the
defense industry. (Item 3 at Sections 12, 13A, and 25.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance because he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted both allegations under
this paragraph.
1.a   and   1.b.  Applicant   used  marijuana  from  February  2017  through  at  least
January 2019. He  used marijuana after completing his e-QIP on September 8, 2018, to
obtain a security clearance with the Department of Defense. (Answer; Item 2  at Section
23.)
Applicant  stated  in   his  e-QIP  that  he  had   a  medical   condition  that  left   him  in
chronic  pain.  Eventually  he  had   been  prescribed   Oxycodone.  He  stated,   “The  opiates
bothered my stomach so based on my Dr.s comments I tried medical  marijuana for  the
pain as a way to get off  opiates.”  He  further stated,  “While it seems to help in  reducing
flair  ups,  I  really  want  to   work  in   the  position   I  have   been  offered  and   respect  the
Federal  Governments  position  on  Medical   Marijuana.  I  will  seek  the  advice  on
alternatives from my Dr. and the local pain management clinic.”  (Item 2 at Section 23.)
Applicant  submitted  a  copy  of  his  state  medical  marijuana  card.  It  is  noted  that
the card was issued on February 16, 2017, and expired on February 15, 2018. There is
no  evidence  that  Applicant  had  a  valid  card  at  the  time  he  filled  out  the  e-QIP,  or
admitted to last using marijuana, both of which events were in 2019. (Item 2 at Section
23; Answer, Attachment 6.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance  because  he  is  financially  overextended  and  therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
The SOR alleged that Applicant had one delinquent tax debt and fourteen past-
due  or  charged-off  commercial  debts,  totaling  approximately  $58,000.  Support  for  the
existence and amount of the indebtedness is found in credit reports of the Government
dated October 9, 2018; and November 19, 2020. (Items 4 and 5.)
Applicant  stated  on  his  e-QIP  that  his  debt  problems  occurred  due  to  a  loss  of
income. He further stated, “I have not had sufficient income to settle these debts yet but
I have settled others.” (Item 2 at Section 26.)
The current status of the allegations in the SOR is as follows:
2.a.   Applicant  admitted  owing  the  Federal  Government  for  delinquent  taxes  for
tax year 2006 in the amount of approximately $45,000. Applicant stated in his Answer
that  he  has  reduced  the  indebtedness  to  $15,786.  He  stated  in  his  Answer,  “When  I
started out as a contractor I found work only intermittently. I was not good at budgeting
for  months  out  of  work,  keeping  working  capital,  and  saving  for  taxes.  I  learned  to
budget for those things.” This debt is not resolved.
2.b.  Applicant admitted owing a creditor $2,677 for a collection account. He has
not  made  any  payments  on  this  account  and  it  remains  due  and  owing.  It  is  not
resolved.
2.c. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $1,582 for a past-due debt that has been
charged  off.  He  stated  in  his  Answer,  “This  debt  is  not  on  my  credit  report.  I  honestly
don’t remember if I paid it. I could not find a receipt.” While this debt is found in the 2019
credit  report  (Government  Exhibit  4),  it  is  not  found  in  the  2020  report  (Government
Exhibit 5). Based on the state of the record, I find the Government has not proved this is
a current debt of the Applicant.
2.d.  Applicant admitted owing a creditor for a charged-off debt in the amount of
$1,123.  Applicant  made  payment  arrangements  with  the  creditor’s  agent  and  paid  the
agreed amount in May 2019. This debt has been resolved. (Answer, Attachment 5.)
2.e.   Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  $995  for  a  charged-off  debt.  Applicant
stated in his Answer that he had paid this debt off. None of his attachments support this
statement. This debt is not resolved.
2.f.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  $788  for  a  past-due  debt  placed  in
collection.  He  has  not  made  any  payments  on  this  account  and  it  remains  due  and
owing. It is not resolved.
2.g.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  $780  for  a  past-due  debt  placed  in
collection.  He  has  not  made  any  payments  on  this  account  and  it  remains  due  and
owing. It is not resolved.
2.h.   Applicant   admitted  owing  a  creditor  for   a  past-due   debt  in  the  amount  of
$662. Applicant made payment arrangements with the creditor’s agent in  May 2019, as
shown by a settlement agreement. The  Applicant  did not provide a receipt showing  that
he had paid this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Answer, Attachment 2.)
2.i.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  for  a  past-due  debt  in  the  amount  of
$618. He has not made any payments on this account, and it remains due and owing. It
is not resolved.
2.j. Applicant admitted owing a past-due debt in the amount of $547. He has not
made any payments on this account, and it remains due and owing. It is not resolved.
2.k. Applicant denied owing a past-due debt in the amount of $122. He stated in
his Answer that he paid the debt and, “This does not show up when I look at my report
currently.”  Neither  of  the  credit  reports  in  the  record  shows  a  past-due  debt  to  this
creditor in this amount. This allegation is found for Applicant due to a lack of evidence.
2.l.  Applicant   admitted  owing  a  creditor   for  a   past-due   debt  in   the  amount  of
$176.  Applicant  made  payment  arrangements  with  the  creditor’s  agent  and   paid  the
agreed amount in April 2019. This debt has been resolved. (Answer, Attachment 1.)
2.m.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  for  a  past-due   debt  in   the  amount  of
$1,187.  Applicant   made  payment  arrangements  with  the  creditor’s  agent  and   paid  the
agreed amount in March 2019. This debt has been resolved. (Answer, Attachment 4.)
2.n.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  for  a  past-due  debt  in  the  amount  of
$981.  He  stated  in  his  Answer  that  he had paid  this  debt.  None of  the  attachments  to
the Answer support his statement. This debt is not resolved.
2.o.  Applicant   admitted  owing  a  creditor  for   a   past-due   debt  in  the  amount  of
$883.  Applicant  made  payment  arrangements  with  the  creditor’s  agent  and   paid  the
agreed amount in April 2019. This debt has been resolved. (Answer, Attachment 3.)

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e,  2.a,  3.a, 3.b,  and  3.d-3.g,  although  he  said
that SOR ¶¶ 3.e and 3.f were the same offense. He denied SOR ¶ 3.c. His admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee   of   a   defense   contractor.  He   has  never
married.  He  has  an  adult son  who  lives in another  state,  an  18-year-old daughter,  a  15-
year-old  daughter,  and   a   14-year-old  daughter.  His  three   daughters  live   with   their
mothers. Two  of  them  live  in other states. Applicant lives with  his girlfriend  and  her 10-
year-old  son.   (GE   1;   Tr.  25)   Applicant   earned   a   certification   in   1997,   an   associate’s
degree  in 2012,  and  a  bachelor’s degree  in 2015. (GE  1) He testified  that he  also has a
master’s degree. (Tr. 25, 58)
Applicant  was  employed  by  an  electronics  company  from  December  2005  to
January  2008.  He  left  the  job  to  take  a  position  in  another  state,  but  the  job  did  not
materialize.  He  was  then  unemployed  for  most  of  the  next  four  and  a  half  years.  He
spent much of this time improving his education. (GE 1; Tr. 67-69) He was employed at
a  computer  company  from  May  to  September  2013,  but  was  terminated  after  a
confrontation  with  a  coworker.  (GE  1;  Tr.  68-70  He  was  then  unemployed  again  until
May 2014, when he briefly took a job caring for seniors. He left the position because he
did not believe the employer was following regulations appropriately. (GE 1; Tr. 71-72)
Since  2017,  Applicant  has  worked  in  information  technology  for  his  current
employer and clearance sponsor. (GE 1, Tr. 72-76) On occasion, he was unemployed
between contracts. (GE 1; Tr. 61-65) He has never held a clearance. (Tr. 13) Applicant
testified that in 2019, he earned between $35,000 and $40,000. He works full time. (Tr.
65-67, 90-93)
In April 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony injury to a child. He
was  convicted  and  served  five  years  in  jail.  (SOR  ¶  3.g)(GE  1  at  43-44)  Applicant
testified that the injuries to the child included bruises and a burn mark. (Tr. 34-35)
In  September  2001,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  third-degree
larceny. (SOR ¶ 3.f) He explained that he was arrested after he attempted to steal some
items of clothing from a department store. He received a period of probation, but failed
to pay the related fine. In March 2003, he was in an auto accident. In the aftermath, he
gave a false name to the police. He was arrested for  making a false report and for the
larceny  charge,  due  to  the  unpaid  fine.  He  said  that  his  probation  was  extended  as  a
result. (GE 1 at 44-45; GE 5 at 11; Tr. 26-28, 35-37) (SOR ¶ 3.e)
In 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol (DUI) and driving with a suspended license. He was convicted and sentenced to
one  day  in  jail,  12  months  of  probation,  fined,  ordered  to  perform  community  service,
and attend DUI education. (SOR ¶ 3.d) (GE 1 at 45-46; GE 5 at 8-9)
In   January   2012,  Applicant   was  arrested   and   charged   with   felony   child   abuse.
(SOR  ¶  3.c) (GE 5  at  12; GE  1  at 38)  He denied  SOR ¶  3.c.  Applicant testified  that the
girlfriend   of  his  daughter’s  maternal  grandfather   filed   a   child-abuse   complaint  against
Applicant.   The   complainant,   he   asserted,  was  herself  wanted   for  murder  at  the   time.
Applicant  was  arrested,  as  was  his   daughter’s  mother.   Applicant  denied   that  he
committed  the  offense.  (Tr.  28-31,  37)  He  participated  in  parenting  classes. (Tr.  34, 81-
83)  He  reported   the   arrest  on   his  SCA  and   noted   that   the   charge   was  dismissed   in
September  2014.  (GE   1   at  38-39)   The   arrest  is  documented   in   Applicant’s  criminal
record, but disposition  of the charge is not. (GE 5)
In about June 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication
and  resisting  arrest,  and  cited  for  speeding  and  improper  lane  usage.  (SOR  ¶  3.b)  In
October 2013, he pleaded guilty to speeding and public intoxication and was fined. The
resisting  arrest  charge  and  the  citation  for  improper  lane  usage  were  dismissed.
Applicant testified that he was on his way home and a police car going in the opposite
direction  turned  and  followed  him.  He  pulled  into  his  apartment  complex.  When  the
police asked him to exit the vehicle, he tripped over a curb and fell down because the
parking lot was not well lit. (Tr. 37-38) (Answer to SOR; GE 1 at 39-40; Tr. 31-32) The
charges are not detailed on the exhibit documenting Applicant’s criminal record. (GE 5)
In December 2014, Applicant was charged with DUI and also cited for speeding
and improper lane usage. (SOR ¶ 3.a) Applicant admitted the fact that he was charged
but denied the conduct. He testified that he was pulled over because the police officer
observed him swerving between the lanes and  smelled  liquor  on him  during the  traffic
stop.  Applicant  denied  that  he  consumed  alcohol  that  night.  He  said  had  just  left  the
house,  and  was  “sleepy”  but  not  drunk.  (Tr.  83-85)  In  October  2016,  the  DUI  charge
was nolle prossed after Applicant attended a nine-month DUI class through a diversion
program. (GE 5 at 12; GE 1 at 41-42; Tr. 31-32, 39-40, 76-80, 94) He has not had any
subsequent arrests. (Tr. 40)
Applicant  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  weekly,  at  times  daily,
between  May  2003  and  July  2016.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  His  most  recent  use  was  after  the
sudden  death  of  a  close  friend.  He  said  this  was  shortly  before  he  participated  in  the
DUI  diversion  program.  The  timing  of  his  last  marijuana  use  is unclear.  Applicant  said
he  had  not  used  marijuana  since  July  2016.  (Tr.  43,  44)  He  later  said  this  was  some
time in 2017. (Tr. 44, 46-47) He denied using marijuana after submitting his May 2017
SCA. (Tr. 46) He acknowledged knowing that marijuana use is against state and federal
law.  He  has  attended  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  a  few  times  in  the  last  three  years.
(Tr. 40-47, 94-98)
Applicant’s background investigation also included credit reports from July 2017,
May 2018, and March 2019. Applicant had five delinquent accounts,  the largest by far
being  SOR  ¶  1.a,  concerning  a  $121,692  child  support  arrearage.  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a
charged-off student loan account for $8,293. SOR ¶ 1.c is another charged-off account
for  $1,755.  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  ($250)  and  1.e  ($76)  are  two  past-due  medical  accounts.
Applicant disclosed his debts on his SCA. (GE 1)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.a,  Applicant  testified  that  he  fell  behind  on  his  child-support
payments  during  his  periods  of  unemployment.  This  began  with  a  layoff  in  2009.  He
also acknowledged working odd jobs, but said that none of that income went to arrears
or child support. (Tr. 85-90) Applicant testified that his child support went into arrears in
about 2012. (Tr. 100)
Applicant testified that he is currently paying on his child support and has money
taken out of his paycheck regularly. He said the arrearage amount was incurred during
his  various  periods  of  unemployment.  The  child  support  concerns  his  two  younger
children,  one  of  whom  lives  in  his  home  state  and  one  of  whom  is  in  another  state.
Applicant  said  he  is  paying  between  $500  and  $600  in  child  support  monthly  for  one
child,  and  about  $425  for  another  child.  Applicant  does  not  believe  that  his  monthly
payments  address  the  amount  in  arrears.  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  of
the current status of his child-support payments. (Tr. 47-54, 99-104)
Applicant asserted that his student loan (SOR ¶ 1.b) is in deferment. He  said he
has  other  student  loans,  which  are  also  deferred.  (Tr.  54-55,  58-61)  Applicant  did  not
provide documentation of the current status of his past-due student loan. The past-due
debt at SOR ¶ 1.c is also unresolved. (Tr. 105)
Applicant asserted that the two medical debts alleged (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e) are
co-payments from medical procedures. He believes they should have been covered by
insurance. (Tr. 55-56) They remain unresolved.
",False
"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  30  years  old  and  was  recently  married.  He  has  no  children.  He
received his high school diploma in 2009. Shortly after receiving his bachelor’s degree in
engineering in May 2018, he began working for a DoD contractor. He works in a position
that  requires  a  top  secret  security  clearance.  He  submitted  his  SCA  in  April  2018  in
anticipation of commencing his new job three months after his graduation. (Tr. at 20-22.)
When Applicant was a young teen, he spent his free time with the “wrong crowd”
and became involved in smoking marijuana in 2004. His drug use was typically limited to
summers  and  holidays  when  he  visited  an  older  cousin  and  the  cousin’s  friends  in  a
distant state. Despite that, he earned the honor of being admitted to the U.S. Air Force
Academy Preparatory School (Prep School). The Prep School prepares athletes such as
Applicant and others to succeed at the Air Force Academy. Students at the Prep School
are treated as enlistees. He did not use any marijuana after he was accepted at the Prep
School  in  April  2009,  when  he  was  a  high  school  senior.  His  father  died  that  summer
before Applicant commenced his studies at the Prep School, which made his transition
away from home difficult. Nevertheless, he performed very well at the Prep School in both
his  studies  and  his  athletic  activities.  He  believed  he  had  a  promising  opportunity  and
future at the Air Force Academy and as a future Air Force Officer. As a member of the Air
Force, he was granted a security clearance. (Tr. at 23-27, 31, 39-40; 55; AE I; AE J.)
One day before leaving the Prep School for the Christmas 2009 holiday break, he
smoked marijuana with his roommate. His roommate was caught and informed the school
officials  of  Applicant’s  use  of  marijuana  with  him.  After  initially  denying  any  drug  use,
Applicant admitted his use and  tested positive for marijuana. He was 18 years old. He
was expelled from the Prep School and discharged from the Air Force the next day. His
DD 214 reflects that he received an “Uncharacterized” “Entry Level Separation.” It is not
a punitive discharge.  In his SCA, he mistakenly wrote that he received an Other Than
Honorable (OTH) discharge. Applicant was “very devastated” by the adverse impact his
poor judgment had on his future with the Air Force. (Tr. at 23-27, 50-51, 58-59; GE 1 at
27; AE G.)
Following his arrival at home in disgrace, Applicant tried to repent for his mistake
by working in his church community and performing services helping others. He attended
community college in the spring of 2010. He transferred to a four-year university in 2011
and waited on tables to pay for his living expenses. He transferred to a second university
closer to home in 2012. He also enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve in October 2012 to
fulfill his desire to serve in the military. He required a security clearance and was unaware
that  his  2009  eligibility  had  not  been  revoked.  He  mistakenly  understood  that  he  was
granted  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  Army  Reserve  duty.  He  accessed
classified  information  for  the  first  and  only  time  in  the  military  when  he  received  his
advanced  individual  training  during  the  period  February  to  April  2013.  After  his  basic
training and advanced training were completed, he returned home. (Tr. at 27-34, 40-42,
51-52, 58; AE H.)
Upon  his  return,  Applicant  used  marijuana  again  with  another  cousin  who  was
attending  college  in  Applicant’s  home  area.  In  July  2013,  Applicant  was  arrested  for
possession of marijuana while sitting in a car in front of his home. He was 22 years old.
He testified that this use of marijuana was one of the rare occasions he smoked marijuana
at that time in his life. He received deferred adjudication and was put on probation for six
months.  He  was  also  required  to  attend  drug-education  classes.  He  did  not  smoke
marijuana while on probation. (Tr. at 32-36, 45-47; GE 5 at 2.)
Applicant’s next use of marijuana was in the spring of 2015 when he was living on
campus  after  returning  to  his  first  university  and  living  with  roommates  who  used
marijuana. He used marijuana  occasionally until summer 2017. He would contribute to
the cost of marijuana when it was being used. (Tr. at 32-36, 45-47.)
Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a  clearance  had  not  changed  since  2009.  He  only
accessed classified information during a three-month training period in 2013 and never
functioned in a classified work environment with the Army Reserve. He did not understand
his responsibilities as someone eligible for a clearance with respect to drug use. In fact,
he did not even understand at the hearing that he remained eligible to hold a clearance
after he was discharged from the Air Force in 2009. In mid-2017, he made a decision to
stop  using  marijuana  completely  for  reasons  unrelated  to  his  clearance  status.  He
became  focused  on  finding  an  internship  and  planning  his  career  after  graduating  the
following year. At around the same time, he met his future wife, who disapproved of his
use  of  marijuana.  He  shifted  his friendships to  other  engineers  who  were  not  users of
marijuana.  In  the  fall  of  2017,  he  received  a  job  offer  from  his  current  employer  for  a
position  to  begin  after  he  graduated.  He  was  discharged  from  the  Army  Reserve  in
October 2018 with the rank of Sergeant (E-5) after starting his current position with the
defense contractor. (Tr. at 32-36, 45-47; AE F.)
SOR Allegations
Paragraph  1  of  the  SOR  sets  forth  four  allegations  under  Guideline  H.
Subparagraph  1.a,  as  amended,  alleges  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  “with  varying
frequency” from about June 2004 to about July 2017. The other allegations are that he
purchased marijuana with varying frequency from June 2006 to July 2017 (¶ 1.b); that he
used marijuana during the period of November 2009 to July 2017 while holding a security
clearance  (¶  1.c);  and  that  he  tested  positive  for  marijuana  usage  in  2009  (¶1.d).
Paragraph 2 of the SOR sets forth two allegations under Guideline J. Subparagraph 2.a
alleges that Applicant received an OTH discharge from the U.S. Air Force in 2009. The
second  allegation  states  that  Applicant  was  arrested  in  approximately  2013  for
possession of marijuana and received deferred adjudication (¶ 2.b).
In  his Answer, Applicant  admitted each  of  the  allegations  and provided detailed
background information. As discussed below, he incorrectly believed that his discharge
from the Air Force was characterized as under other than honorable conditions, and he
therefore admitted the allegations in SOR  ¶ 2.a. As noted, he received an Entry Level
Separation.
Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant  provided  substantial  evidence  regarding  his  character  and  his  current
views on using illegal drugs. One exhibit in the record is a Clinical Marijuana Assessment
prepared by a licensed social worker (LSW). The LSW concluded his assessment with
the  statement  that  Applicant  “appears  poised  to  continue  abstaining  from  cannabis
without any apparent difficulty.” The LSW also wrote that no treatment recommendations
were necessary. Exhibits from his employer, supervisor/mentor, co-workers, and family
members all praise Applicant’s skills, work ethic, trustworthiness, integrity, and maturity.
His supervisor wrote that he hired Applicant on the spot at a college job fair because he
was  so  impressed with  Applicant.  His family  members praised him for his seriousness
and  committed  religious  beliefs.  He  has  also  submitted  a  signed  statement  of  intent
affirming  his  intention  to  abstain  from  ever  using  marijuana  in  the  future  with  an
acknowledgement  that  any  future  involvement  or  misuse  of  illegal  drugs  would  be
grounds for the revocation of his national security eligibility. (AE A-L.)
",True
"Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR,  with  explanations,  except  for
SOR allegation ¶ 4.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a  Master’s
of  Science  degree, and  has been  employed with  the  defense contractor  since  June of
2010.  (TR  at  page  7  lines  9~25,  and  GX  1  at  pages  7  and  15.)  Applicant  has  held  a
security clearance since 2001, initially as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. (GX 1 at
pages 36~38.) His “less than a year and a half” marriage was annulled in 2014. (TR at
page 22 lines 5~23, and GX 1 at page 23.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations & Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
1.a. and 4.c. Applicant admits that he failed to file his Federal  and state income
tax  returns  for  tax  years  2014~2018  in  a  timely  fashion.  He  mistakenly  “believed”  that
Applicant did  not  have  “to  file  the  taxes unless .  . . [he] owed  money.” (TR at page  25
line 18 to page 26 line 13.) In 2019 and 2020, he has filed returns for those tax years as
evidenced by documentation from the taxing authorities. (TR at page 40 lines 19~23, at
page 51 lines 7~34, and AppX I.)
Guideline   H  -  Drug   Involvement   and Substance   Misuse   &   Guideline   E   -  Personal
Conduct
2.a.  and  4.c.  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency, from  about 2009
to   at  least  August   of   2018   (a   period   of  more   than   ten   years)   while   holding   a   security
clearance. (TR at page 30  line  22 to page 31 line 2, at page 34 line  8 to page 36 line  19,
at page  37  lines 1-~25, and  at page  40  line  24  to  page  41  line  23.) He avers that he  did
not  know  the  use  of marijuana  was illegal under Federal  law, as  it was legalized  under
state law. (Id.)
This averment is countered by the fact  Applicant used  both  his former spouse’s
and  current  girlfriend’s  marijuana  prescription  to  obtain  the  drug.  (TR at  page  65  lines
7~11, at page 67 line 5 to page 68 line 11, and at page 71 line 17 to page 75 line 1.)
Furthermore,  such  usage  is  clearly  contrary  to  his  employer’s  drug  policy  that  clearly
states:  “Even  though  marijuana  has  been  legalized  in  certain  US  states,  it  is  still
considered  illegal  under  federal  law.  Therefore,  our  company  prohibits  use  even  in
locations where it is not against  state  law.” (TR at page  83  line  1  to  page  84  line  5, at
page   85   line   17   to   page   88   line   1,  and   GX   3   at  page   2.)   Applicant  intends  no   future
illegal drug usage. (AppX J.)
2.b.  and   4.c.   Applicant  used   Hallucinogenic  Mushrooms  twice   in  2010   while
holding  a  security  clearance. Again,  he  avers he  did not  know  such  use  was illegal. (TR
at page  23  line  16  to  page  24  line  2.) This averment does not pass scrutiny, particularly
as his employer warns  against  the  use  of  drugs that may  impair  decision  making. (TR at
page   75   line   2   to   page   76   line   7,   and   GX   3   at   page   2.)   Although   it  appears  that   his
employer  alludes  to   on-the-job   conduct,   “loose   lips  can   sink   ships”  off-the-job,  where
judgment  is  impaired   by   hallucinogens.   Applicant  intends  no   future   illegal  drug   usage.

Guideline G  - Alcohol Consumption  & Guideline  E  - Personal Conduct
3.a.~3.d.  and  4.c.  Applicant  admits  that  between  2011  and  April  of  2020,  he
consumed  alcohol  at  times  in  excess  and  to  the  point  of  intoxication.  (TR  at  page  31
lines  3~25,  and  at  page  42  lines  2~11.)  Applicant  further  admits  that  alcohol  was
involved, in about 2013, when he threatened a university employee, who was “cheating”
with his then wife. (TR at page 46 line 4 to page 47 line 6.) He also admits that alcohol
was involved, in about 2013, when he physically assaulted his former spouse who was
“cheating”  on  Applicant.  (TR at  page  43  line  12  to  page  45  line  9.)  In  2018,  Applicant
missed  work,  pursuant  to  his  doctor’s  instruction,  to  address  his  alcohol  consumption.
(TR at page 42 lines 12~22.)
Applicant  now   attends   Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  on   a   regular  basis,  and   last
consumed  the  intoxicant in  April of  2020, about a  year prior to  his hearing. (TR at page
31   lines  3~25.)  In   February   of   2021,  Applicant  was  evaluated   by   a   Licensed   Clinical
Social Worker, who  diagnosed  Applicant as suffering  from  “Mild Alcohol Use  Disorder
–   In  Sustained  Remission.”  (AppX   K   at   page   9,  emphasis  in   original.)  She   further
opined:  “No   Treatment   Warranted.  Continued   participation   in   the   fellowship  of
Alcoholics Anonymous, regular meeting with his  sponsor, and working the steps.”  (Id.)
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
4.a.  Applicant  answer  “No”  to   Section   23   on   his  March  2018   SCA   as  to   “Illegal
Use  of  Drugs   .  .  .  in  the   last  (7)  seven   years  .  .   .  [and]  While   possessing   a   Security
Clearance.” (SCA  at pages 34~35.) This was a  willful falsification, as he  admits to  using
marijuana pursuant to the prescriptions of his former spouse and  his current girlfriend.
4.b. Applicant knowingly  provided  materially  false information  during  a  November
2018   interview   with   a   DoD  investigator  as  to   his  above-mentioned   illegal  drug   usage.
(TR at page  47 lines  14~21.)
4.c.  This allegation  has been discussed  at length, above.
",True
"Applicant  is a  38-year-old  married  man  with three pre-teen children. A previous
marriage ended in divorce in December 2011. (Item 7 at 26)  After finishing high school, he
earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  May  2007.  Currently,  he  is  working  towards  finishing
college.  (Item 1 at 19) He has been working in the security analysis profession since 2009
and has been working for his current employer since 2014. (Item 1 at 19)
Applicant  is  highly  respected  on  the  job  and  in  his  community.  According  to  a
coworker who has known him for five years, he “has shown time and time again” that he is
a dependable associate who “can effectively handle complex tasks with the highest level of
professional manner.”  (Item  1  at 22)  Applicant’s supervisor characterizes him  as a  key
member of the staff, who “goes out of his way” to accept undesirable work shifts, and to
help with tasks that are beyond the skill sets of other employees. (Item 1 at 23)  A neighbor
describes him as “a ‘class act’ who is involved in the community, and is frequently helpful
to his neighbors.” (Item 1 at 26)
Applicant smoked marijuana with various degrees of frequency between 2004 and
2018.  The most frequent use occurred between 2004 and 2007 when he used it six to ten
times, typically when visiting longtime friends from college. (Item 5 at 46-47: Item 7 at 4) He
disclosed this use to an investigator in 2010, and stated that he had no intention of using
marijuana in the future.  (Item 7 at 4)
Applicant used marijuana again in 2015, four years after being granted a security
clearance. (Item 6 at 7) After disclosing this use to an investigative agent as part of another
security  clearance  investigation,  Applicant  again  promised  to  quit  smoking  marijuana.
Applicant  used  marijuana  on  another  occasion  in  2018.  (Item  7  at  6)  In  March  2019,
Applicant  completed  an updated  security clearance application form. He disclosed the
2015 marijuana use, and stated that he had no intention of using it again in the future.
(Item  3  at  38)  He  did  not  disclose  the  2018  marijuana  use  on  his  updated  security
clearance application in March 2019.  In April 2019, an authorized investigator interviewed
Applicant. During the interview, Applicant, without confrontation, told the agent about the
2018 use of marijuana. (Item 6 at 7) In responses to interrogatories executed in January
2020, Applicant stated that he had not used any marijuana since 2018, and that he would
use “none, going forward.” (Item 6 at 13) In a statement of intent executed in September
2020, Applicant reiterated his intent not to use marijuana again. (Item 1 at 16)
Applicant’s security clearance application, completed in February 2013, contained
the following question:
Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity . . . In the last seven years,
have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances?
Applicant answered  “no,” failing  to  disclose  his marijuana  use  from  2004  to  2007.  (Item  1  at
3)  SOR subparagraph 2.a alleges that this omission constitutes a falsification.
During an interview with an investigative agent in April 2013, Applicant, when asked
if he had ever used marijuana in the past seven years, answered affirmatively, stating that
he used it in approximately fall 2006. (Item 6 at 9)  SOR subparagraph 2.b alleges that his
failure to disclose use in 2004, 2005, and 2007, constitutes a falsification.
Applicant contends that his 2013 security clearance omission and his underreporting
of  his  marijuana  use  in  the  mid-2000s  were  unintentional  oversights.  (Item  1  at  3)
Applicant  disclosed  his  marijuana  use  between  2004  and  2007  on  an  earlier  security
clearance application in 2010. (Item 5 at 46) He “was under the impression that already
reported uses did not need to be reported again.” (Reply at 1)
SOR  2.c,  as  amended,  alleges  that  Applicant  falsified  a  security  clearance
application completed in March 2019, when he disclosed marijuana use in February 2015,
but failed to disclose marijuana use in December 2018. Applicant admits that he did not
include the December 2018 use on the 2019 security clearance application, as alleged in
the SOR. (Item 1 at 33) According to the investigative agent who interviewed him in April
2019, Applicant disclosed this information without being asked about it.
Applicant  did  not  disclose  his  marijuana  use  between  2004  and  2007  when  he
interviewed with an agent in April 2019. (Item 6 at 5) SOR subparagraph 2.d alleges that
this  omission  constituted  a  falsification.  Applicant  admits  that  he  did  not  disclose  this
marijuana use during the 2019 interview; however, he explained that he believed that the
agent  was  only  asking  him  about  use  within  a  seven-year  scope  of  the  date  of  the
interview. (Item 1 at 4) Applicant had disclosed his marijuana use from 2004 to 2007 during
an investigative process in 2010. (Item 7 at 4)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  admitted  the  two  factual  allegations  of  the
SOR,  with  explanations  He  also  provided  additional information  to  support his request

Guideline H – Drug Involvement
1.a.  and  1.b.  When  Applicant  executed  his  first  e-QIP  in  June  of  2012,  he
admitted  using  marijuana  “about five  times” between  February  of  2008  and  January of
2009. (GX 1 at pages 30~31.) Subsequent to being granted a security clearance in July
of 2012, Applicant used marijuana on about four additional occasions, at least once with
his father.  (GX  2  at  pages  53~56,  and  GX 3  at  page  2,  and  TR at  page  32  line  20  to
page 35 line 12.) He refers to  this usage  as being  “stupid and  immature.” (TR at page
20  lines  10~13.)  On  October  21,  2020,  Applicant  signed  a  Statement  of  Intent
eschewing future illegal drug usage. (AppX A.)

"Applicant  is  a  61-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  eligibility  for  access  to
classified  information.  He  is employed  as  a  principal or  senior  software  engineer for a
large company doing business in the defense industry. He has had this job since August
2014.  He  was  previously  employed  by  the  same  company  (or  its  predecessor  in
interest)  during  2007-2012.  His  educational  background  includes  a  bachelor’s  degree
awarded in 1982. He married in 1981, and he and his spouse have two adult children.
Applicant  was  initially  granted  a  security  clearance  at  the  secret  level  in  2008.
(Exhibits 3, 4, and 5) He received a top-secret clearance in 2010. He underwent another
review  in  2014,  after  returning  to  his  current  job,  resulting  in  a  secret  level  security
clearance.
Applicant  denied  any  illegal  or  improper  drug  use  or  activity  in  his  November
2014 security clearance application. (Exhibit 3 at Section 23) He disclosed  “occasional
use  of  marijuana”  when  he  completed  his  April  2018  security  clearance  application.
(Exhibit  4  at  Section  23).  He  stated  that  his  occasional  use  occurred  with  marijuana
purchased  by  friends  in  states  where  marijuana  is  legalized.  He  estimated  using
marijuana about five times during May 2015 to October 2017. He acknowledged that his
use  of  marijuana  occurred  while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  He  also
acknowledged  that  he  intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  denied  any  other
involvement with illegal drugs.
Applicant  provided  additional  details  about  his  marijuana  use  during  his  2019
background investigation. (Exhibit 5) In an April 2019 interview, he stated that he began
using marijuana for recreational use sometime before August 2012.  He stated that he
continued  using  marijuana  after  obtaining  the  top  secret  clearance  in  2010.  He  again
stated  that  he  intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  In  a  July  2019  interview,  in
response  to  questions  to  clarify  his  history  of  marijuana  use,  he  admitted  first  using
marijuana in autumn 2016, and he last used marijuana in July 2018. He described his
usage  as  infrequent  and  occurring  only  when  he  visited  states  where  marijuana  had
been  decriminalized.  He  estimated  using  marijuana  about  two  to  three  times  while
holding a security clearance.
In his answer to the  SOR,  Applicant described his marijuana use as  infrequent,
occasional, and for recreational use only. Concerning the factual allegations in the SOR,
he admitted the following: (1) using marijuana from about April 2018 to July 2018 after
completing his April 2018 security clearance application; (2) purchasing marijuana after
completing  his  April  2018  security  clearance  application;  (3)  using  marijuana  with
varying  frequency,  occasionally,  from  about  May  2015  to  July  2018,  while  granted
access  to  classified  information;  (4)  purchasing  marijuana  while  granted  access  to
classified  information;  and  (5)  having  an  intention  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future,
meaning  in  the  future  he  may  continue  his  occasional  marijuana  usage.  He  further
admitted using marijuana once in 2019 and once in 2020.
In his reply to the FORM, Applicant did not dispute the facts, but he did dispute
that  those  facts  should  result  in  an  unfavorable  clearance  decision.  He  described  his
marijuana usage as occasional and responsible, not abusive or habitual, and equated it
to  having  a  couple  of  beers.  He  denied  any  potential  for  social  stigma  or  blackmail
because he has been candid about it with his friends and family. He also pointed to his
history  of  employment  in  the  defense  industry  without  any  security  infractions  or
violations as well as his contributions as a senior software engineer.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review

Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that

the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.6  An
Applicant  is  responsible  for  presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or
mitigate  facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.7  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8
Discussion
Under Guideline H for drug involvement  and substance misuse, the  concern as
set forth in AG ¶ 24 is that:
[t]he   illegal  use   of  controlled   substances,  to   include   the   misuse   of
prescriptions and  non-prescription  drugs, and  the  use  of  other substances
that   cause   physical  or  mental  impairment   or  are   use   in   a   manner
inconsistent  with   their   intended   purpose,  can   raise   questions  about  an
individual’s  reliability   and   trustworthiness,  both   because   such   behavior
may   lead   to   physical  or  psychological  impairment  and   because   it  raises
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply  with laws, rules,
and regulations. . .  .
In addition to the above matters, I note  that the Director of  National Intelligence
(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws
prohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state
can authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances
Act,  which  identifies  marijuana  as  a  Schedule  I  controlled  drug.  Second,  changes  to
state  laws  (and  the  laws  of  the  District  of  Columbia)  concerning marijuana  use  do  not
alter  the  national  security  adjudicative  guidelines.  And  third,  a  person’s  disregard  of
federal  law  concerning  the  use,  sale,  or  manufacture  of  marijuana  remains  relevant
when making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.

In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance abuse;
AG  ¶   25(f)  any  illegal  drug  use  while  granted  access  to  classified
information or holding a sensitive position;
AG ¶  25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance
misuse,  or failure  to  clearly  and  convincingly  commit  to  discontinue  such
misuse;
AG  ¶   26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment; and
AG  ¶   26(b) the  individual acknowledges  his or her drug involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including  but  not
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)
changing  or  avoiding  the  environment  where  drugs  were  used;  and  (3)
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility.
I  have  considered  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  involvement  with  marijuana  as
outlined in the findings of fact. It includes using marijuana after he initially went through
the security clearance process in 2008. It includes using marijuana after he returned to
employment in the defense industry in 2014. It further includes using marijuana in 2018,
2019,  and  2020.  Some  of  his  marijuana  use  occurred  during  his  employment  with  a
federal  contractor  and  while  he  held  a  security  clearance.  Any  illegal  drug  use  is
relevant in the context of evaluating a person’s security worthiness, but it is particularly
egregious  if  it  occurs  during  the  course  of  employment  while  granted  access  to
classified  information. Furthermore,  I  presume  his marijuana  usage  was  in  violation  of
his  employer’s  drug-free  workplace  policy.9  Simply  put,  a  man  of  Applicant’s  age,
educational  background,  and  work  experience  should  have  known  better  than  to  use
marijuana while employed for a company doing business in the defense industry.
Applicant’s case in mitigation is not very strong. The one item that stands out in
his  favor  is  his  candour  and  willingness  to  disclose  his  marijuana  usage  in  his  2018
security clearance application and during his 2019 background investigation. The credit
is limited, however, because he  continued  to use marijuana after completing the  2018
security clearance application.
9  ISCR Case No. 16-00578 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2017) at 2 (noting the Drug-Free Workplace Act requires
federal contractors with a contract over $100,000 to establish certain drug-free workplace policies).
I also considered the  two  mitigating  conditions noted  above, and  neither applies
in  Applicant’s  favor.  His  marijuana   use   may   be   irregular  or  occasional,   but  it  has
occurred over a  period  of  years. His usage  is recent too,  having  occurred  in 2018, 2019,
and  2020.  In addition,  he has  not clearly  and convincingly  persuaded me  that he  intends
to   discontinue   using   marijuana.  Indeed,  after  reading   his  answer  to   the   SOR   and   his
reply  to  the  FORM, I  was persuaded  of just  the  opposite.  His written  responses  largely
relied  on  state  law, which is interesting  but  not controlling  here,  and  are  otherwise  filled
with rationalizations or minimizations or both.
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he
has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:

security.
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a  security  clearance  for  access  to  confidential,  secret,  or  top-secret  information.  An

Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
Discussion
Under AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into
doubt because  drug  use  can both  impair  judgment and  raise  questions about a  person’s
ability  or willingness to  comply  with  laws, rules, and  regulations. AG ¶¶  24, 25  and  26
(setting  forth  the concern and the disqualifying and  mitigating conditions).
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription
and  non-prescription  drugs,  and  the  use  of  other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their
intended  purpose  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual's  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior  may  lead  to  physical  or
psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises  questions  about  a  person's
ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  Controlled
substance  means  any  ""controlled  substance""  as  defined  in  21  U.S.C.  802.
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions or factors:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);
AG  ¶   25(c)   illegal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  including
cultivation,  processing,  manufacture,  purchase,  sale,  or  distribution;  or
possession of drug
paraphernalia;
AG ¶  25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information
or holding a sensitive position;
AG  ¶   26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or

(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;(2)
changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and,
(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security
eligibility.
Applicant  admitted  using  marijuana  and  cocaine  with  varying  frequency  from
November  2004  to  February  2019  at  times  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  Facts
admitted by an applicant in an answer to a SOR or in an interview require no further proof
from  the  Government.  ISCR  Case  No.  94-1159  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  4,  1995)  (“any
admissions [applicant] made to the SOR allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of
its burden of proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (“[a]n
applicant’s admissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal basis for an
Administrative Judge’s findings”).
Marijuana  and  cocaine  are Schedule I controlled  substances, and  possession  of
them   is regulated   by   the  federal government   under the   Controlled  Substances   Act.   21
U.S.C. §  811  et seq.   The  knowing  or intentional possession  and  use  of  any  controlled
substance  is unlawful and  punishable by  imprisonment and  or a  fine.  21  U.S.C. §  844.  In
an  October 25, 2014  memorandum, the  Director of  National Intelligence  reaffirmed  that
the  use  of marijuana  is relevant to  national security  determinations, regardless of  changes
to   state   laws  concerning   marijuana   use.   James  R.  Clapper,  Director  of   National
Intelligence,   Memorandum:  Adherence   to   Federal  Laws  Prohibiting   Marijuana   Use
(October  25,  2014).  See   also  http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml.    AG  ¶¶   25(a),  (c),
and (f) apply. The  next inquiry is  whether any mitigating factors apply.
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(a). Applicant used illegal drugs with
varying frequency from November 2004 to February 2019 at times while holding a security
clearance. His behavior was neither infrequent, nor did it occur long ago, with his last use
being in February 2019, just over two years ago. I find that AG ¶ 26(a) does not apply.
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(b). There several elements to AG ¶
26(b).  First,  the  applicant  needs  to  have  acknowledged  his  drug  involvement  and
substance misuse. Second, applicant needs to have signed a written statement of intent
to abstain from all drug involvement in the future. Here, Applicant acknowledged his drug
involvement  and  his  intent  to  abstain  from  drug  involvement  in  the  future.  Those
acknowledgements were made in written statements by Applicant  in his Answer to the
SOR, his security clearance application, and during his Personal Subject Interview (PSI),
all  of  which  were  verified.  Third,  Applicant  needs  to  acknowledge  that  any future  drug
involvement is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  Applicant has stated
that  his  career  is  more  important  to  him  than  illegal  drug  use.  I  find  that  those  three
elements of AG ¶ 26(b) are satisfied.
There remains, however, two other elements of AG ¶ 26(b). Fourth, an applicant
must disassociate himself from drug-using associates. During his PSI Applicant admitted
that  he  remains  in  contact  with  the  two  friends  who  enabled  his  use  of  marijuana  and
cocaine. I find that this element is not satisfied. Fifth, an overarching element is that an
applicant has shown a pattern of abstinence. Applicant has been abstinent for just over
two years, after many years of illegal drug usage. I find that this is not a sufficient pattern
of abstinence.  AG ¶ 26(b) does not apply. Applicant is on the right track, and if he remains
abstinent, he could be a worthy candidate for reapplication.
The  record raises doubts about  Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment,
and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6).  Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not
meet  his  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph 1, Guideline H:
Against  Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant access to classified information.

"Applicant is 22 years old. In May 2020, she earned a bachelor’s of science degree
in aerospace engineering. She is currently engaged, and she does not have any children.
While  enrolled  in  college,  she  accepted  a  2019  summer  internship  with  a  defense
contractor. After the internship was completed, she was offered full-time employment by
the same defense contractor to begin the week following her college graduation. Her job
title is aerodynamics engineer. She learned that she had been  issued an  interim  DOD
security  clearance  when  she  started  her  full-time  employment  in  May  2020.  After  the
issuance  of  the  SOR  in  October  2020,  she  no  longer  possessed  a  DOD  security
clearance. (Tr. 14-17, 21; GE 1)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, starting in 2018
and that she intends to use marijuana in the future. (¶ 1.a) She admitted SOR allegation
(¶ 1.a) and listed that the total number of times she used marijuana was less than seven.
She did not respond to the concern that she intends to use marijuana in the future. She
denied  SOR  ¶  2.a,  which  alleged  that  she  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  her  use  of
marijuana  on  her  SCA.  Applicant  listed  in  her  SOR  response  that  she  did  not  fully
understand the question and answered it incorrectly with no intent to falsify.
Applicant first used marijuana in 2018 during her junior year of college by ingesting
a cookie that had marijuana. She also ingested marijuana a second time via a gummy
edible  that  same  year.  In  addition  to  the  edibles,  she  estimated  that  she  smoked
marijuana on approximately seven occasions with the last occurrence in 2019. She has
never purchased marijuana. (Tr. 17-20, 23-24, 30; GE 2)
Applicant  completed  her SCA  in  August  2019.  Under section  23  entitled  “Illegal
Use of Drugs or Drug Activity” she answered “No” to the question asking whether she had
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances  within  the  last  seven  years.  At  the
hearing Applicant testified that she read the question as pertaining to “hard” drugs only,
such as heroin, cocaine, etc. She was not aware that she was  required to disclose her
infrequent  use  of  marijuana  until  she  had  her  background  interview  about  two  months
after submitting the SCA. (Tr. 31-33; GE 1)
During  Applicant’s  October  2019  background  interview,  she  was  asked  by  an
investigator if she had used any illegal drugs, and she replied that she had not. Then the
investigator  stated;  “Including  marijuana?”  At  that  moment,  she  realized  that  the  SCA
question encompassed all drugs, including marijuana. In her state of residence, marijuana
use  is  legal  only  if  an  individual  is  prescribed  marijuana  to  treat  a  medical  condition.
Applicant acknowledged that recreational use of marijuana in her state is not legal and
that  all  of  her  possessions  of  marijuana  before  using  it  were  considered  illegal.  She
answered the investigator’s follow-up question by disclosing her use of marijuana on two
occasions. When asked about her future intentions of using illegal marijuana, Applicant
stated  that  if  her  employer  does  not  conduct  random  drug  tests,  she  might  smoke
marijuana in the future. However, if her employer does conduct random drug tests, then
she would not use marijuana in the future. During the hearing she also admitted that she
used marijuana once or twice in late 2019 after the background interview was conducted.
She now has no intention of using marijuana in the future. (Tr. 25-26, 31, 37-40; GE 2)
During  the  hearing  Applicant  admitted  that  her  fiancé  currently  uses  marijuana
approximately four times a year. He lives with Applicant and occasionally uses marijuana
in front of her. She also testified that some of her family members currently use marijuana.
She  stated  that  she  made  it  clear  to  everyone  that  she  has  no  interest  in  smoking  or
ingesting marijuana ever again, and they respect her wishes in this matter. (Tr. 41-43)
Applicant’s  current  manager  provided  a  character  reference  letter.  He  has
observed her work for just over a year and finds Applicant to be trustworthy, reliable, and
a talented employee. Another co-worker and Applicant’s fiancé also provided character
reference letters. Both of these individuals described Applicant as honest, accountable
and  morally  conscientious.  They  believe  she  should  be  granted  a  DOD  security
clearance.  The  last  document  submitted  by  Applicant  is  an  undated  employee  award
presented to her for her outstanding work contributions. (Tr. AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D)

"The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used THC extract oil (SOR ¶ 1.a)
and cannabis (SOR ¶ 1.b) approximately ten times a month each from June 2018 to about
December 2018 while  granted access to classified information, and that he was arrested in
December 2018 and charged with felony possession of a controlled substance (SOR ¶
1.c). Under Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in December 2018 and
charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) (SOR ¶ 2.a). When he responded to the SOR,
he admitted all of the allegations without comment. Applicant’s admissions are accepted
and incorporated as factual findings. After considering Exhibits 1 through 7 in the FORM, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 57 years old, married, and has a 20-year-old son and three daughters,
ages 23, 21, and 17. He earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and has
worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since September 1999. Applicant
reports  that  he  was  granted  a  DOD  secret  clearance  in  February  2005.  (Ex.  3.)
Government  records  show  he  was  granted  a  DOD  secret  clearance  most  recently  in
October 2009. (Ex. 6.)
Applicant consumed five to six glasses of wine at a concert on December 20, 2018.
In  route  home,  he  was  stopped  for  weaving.  He  failed  a  field  sobriety  test  and  also  a
breathalyzer test, which showed a blood-alcohol level of .12%. Applicant was arrested and
charged  with  DWI  and  with  possession  of  a  controlled  substance  after  an  electronic
cigarette containing THC extract was found in his vehicle. (Ex. 4.)
On  July  15,  2019,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He disclosed in response to police
record inquires his arrest in December 2018 on pending charges of misdemeanor DWI and
felony possession of a controlled substance (cannabis or THC extract). In response to an
inquiry  into  whether  he  had  illegally  used  any  drug  in  the  last  seven  years,  Applicant
reported that he used “cannabis or THC extract” by smoking vapor 20 times per month
between June 2018 and December 2018. He responded affirmatively to whether his use
occurred while possessing a security clearance but also indicated that he did not intend to
use cannabis or THC extract in the future “for family, health and legal reasons.” Applicant
disclosed  in  a  separate  entry  that  he  used  “THC  oil”  ten  times  from  June  2017  to
December 2018, while possessing a security clearance. (Ex. 3.) On August 8, 2019, a
grand jury indicted Applicant for felony possession of THC in amount of less than one gram
for the THC found in his vehicle on December 20, 2018. (Ex. 4)
On October 22, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He indicated that he had not yet appeared in
court for his December 2018 DWI. He described his then current consumption of alcohol
as two or three glasses of wine two or three times a week to relax or for social reasons. He
admitted that he had consumed more alcohol than he should have at the concert, but at
the time, he did not believe that his alcohol consumption was a problem. Applicant stated
that a friend, who lives in a state where recreational marijuana use is legal, had given him
the electronic cigarette containing THC extract which was found during the search of his
vehicle incident to his December 2018 DWI arrest. Applicant related that he used THC to
relax in his home, five to ten times a month from June 2018 to December 2018, while he
held a security clearance. He denied any use of THC since then and any intent to use the
drug in the future. (Ex. 4.)
Applicant  was  re-interviewed  by  the  OPM  investigator  on  January  8,  2020,  to
provide an update about the status of his pending misdemeanor DWI and felony drug
possession  offenses.  He  stated  that  he  had  rejected  the  first  plea  bargain  of  the
prosecution on the drug charge but did not elaborate as to its terms. He had yet to appear
in court on the DWI charge because the county wanted to close the felony drug case first.
Regarding his drinking, Applicant volunteered for the first time that his alcohol consumption
had a negative impact on him from January 2014 to December 2018. He did not give a
reason for his increased alcohol consumption during that time but admitted that it caused
him marital difficulties. He denied any consumption of alcohol since December 2018. (Ex.
4.)
On March 3, 2020, Applicant pled guilty to a negotiated charge of misdemeanor
possession  of  a  controlled  substance  —  THC  less  than  one  gram.  He  was  placed  on
deferred adjudication for 24 months with community supervision for two years, fined $1,500
plus costs for a total of $3,295, and ordered to submit to random hair follicle drug testing,
complete 40 hours of community service, and attend a drug offender education program.
(Ex.  4;  Ex.  5.)  As  of  May  20,  2020,  Applicant  had  yet  to  pay  $3,173  of  the  financial
assessment for the drug offense. (Ex. 5.) The state where Applicant was arrested allows
for community supervision by a court under a continuum of programs and sanctions with
conditions imposed for a specific period during which criminal proceedings are deferred
without  an  adjudication  of  guilt,  or where  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  or confinement,
imprisonment and fine, or confinement and fine, is probated and the imposition of sentence
is suspended in whole or in part. See Chapter 42A Tex. Code Crim. Proc.
In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated on August 19, 2020, that he
was currently on “probation with [a] community supervision officer” for the deferred Class A
misdemeanor drug possession charge, and was scheduled to plead in court for the DUI on
September 10, 2020.  Relevant court records confirm that court date. In response to a
DOHA interrogatory into whether he had ever used any narcotic, depressant, stimulant,
hallucinogen, or cannabis or misused any prescription medication, Applicant reported that
use  used  marijuana  and  THC  oil,  each  ten  times  per month,  between  June  2018  and
December 2018. He denied any intent to use either drug in the future, stating “No intention
to  use  illegal  drugs.  Avoid  people  or  places  where  that  takes  place.”  He  responded
negatively to a question concerning any participation in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation
support group but affirmatively to a question concerning current participation in a drug
testing program. Applicant explained that, as required by his community supervision officer,
he was subjected to quarterly hair follicle testing at the probation office. He responded
negatively to an inquiry concerning any current consumption of alcohol, stating that he last
used alcohol on the day of his December 2018 arrest for DWI, and he denied any intent to
consume  alcohol in  the  future.  As  to  the  next  step  in the judicial process for his DWI,
Applicant  responded,  “Plead  Guilty  in  Court  on  Sept.  10,  2020.”  He  denied  any  other
alcohol-related  incidents  (Ex.4),  and  there  is  no  evidence  to  the  contrary  shown  on
available criminal records, including from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). (Ex. 7.)

"In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a and
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 2.a. His admission is incorporated in my
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  employee  of  a  university  performing  research  as  a
federal contractor. He  graduated  from  high  school in  May  2008,  received  a  bachelor’s
degree  in May 2014, and  received  a master’s degree  in  August 2016. He has been an
employee of a federal contractor since November 2016. He has never married. He has
lived with a cohabitant since September 2013. He has no children.
In  Applicant’s 2016  SCA,  he  disclosed  that in August  2012, he was stopped for
speeding and had marijuana and paraphernalia in his car. He was not intoxicated and
was not arrested. He was given a ticket for speeding. He paid the fine for speeding. When
he  appeared  in  court  on  the  drug  charges,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  disorderly  conduct,
pursuant to a plea agreement. He paid $2,000 in fines and court fees and was placed on
unsupervised probation for one year. He completed his probation without incident and his
criminal record was expunged in March 2014. (FORM Item 6 at 10 and 13; FORM Item 7
at 31.)
In the 2016 SCA, Applicant also disclosed that he used marijuana several times a
month, off and on and mostly on weekends, between July 2008 and May 2016. He stated
that he did not intend to  use marijuana again “in  order to  pass drug tests and maintain
employment.” (FORM Item 7 at 33.) When he was interviewed by a security investigator
in March 2017, he stated that he did not associate with illegal drug users and that the
likelihood of  additional  drug  use  was  “zero” because  he did not  want to  jeopardize  his
career. (FORM Item 6 at 14.)
When Applicant submitted his April 2019 SCA, he repeated his earlier disclosures
of marijuana use and added a disclosure that he used it in September 2018. In both SCAs,
he admitted that he purchased marijuana for personal use.
When Applicant was interviewed in May 2019, he admitted that he continues to
associate with marijuana users and that he used it one time in September 2018 at a party.
He also stated that because marijuana is legal in the jurisdiction where he used it, he was
not aware that it was an issue for him to use it while holding a security clearance. (FORM
Item 6 at 10.) In response to interrogatories in June 2020, he stated that he used “a couple
puffs” of marijuana in September 2018 on weekends. (FORM Item 6 at 5.) In his answer
to  the  SOR,  he  denied  SOR  ¶  1.b,  alleging  use  of  marijuana  while  granted  access  to
classified information, asserting that he was not assigned to any classified programs and
has not had access to any classified information.

security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  employment.    Applicant  served  in  the  United
States Navy from February 2007 to October 2015, when he was honorably discharged.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  admits  two  of  the  three  allegations  set  forth  under  this  guideline.    He
admits that he has used Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, also known as marijuana) off and
on from approximately June 2016 to at least May 2020.  He also admitted to purchasing
THC during that same period.  He denies using THC while granted access to classified
information and while in the Navy.  Applicant states that the last time he had access to
classified information was when he separated from the Navy in October 2015.
Applicant explained that he has used THC to treat his migraine headaches.  He
has used it one to three times monthly from June 2016 through at least May 2020.  He
normally purchased a quarter of an ounce every six months from a friend to supply his
use.  Applicant understands that THC is illegal under Federal law.  He does not have a
medical  prescription  for  the  use  of  this  illegal  drug.    He  states  that  he  believes  a
prescription  is  difficult  to  acquire,  and  he  does  not  know  if  he  would  qualify  for  a
prescription for its medical use.
Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  December  2019.    He  has
never disclosed his use of THC to his employers.  Applicant states that he is not subject
to random drug tests or regular drug screening of any sort and so he has never tested
positive.  He does not use THC while at work, and only uses it at home for his migraine
headaches.  If he gets a migraine at work, he leaves work and goes home.  During his
security clearance background interview with the investigator, Applicant did not want to
identify  the  individual  who  supplies  Applicant’s  THC  for  the  protection  of  his  friend.

TCH he will do so.

unemployed  until  he  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  June  2014.  Applicant
has held a security clearance since 2009, and seeks to retain national security eligibility
for  access  to  classified  information  in  connection  with  his  employment.  (Item  3  at
Sections 13A and 25.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance  because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  three  allegations
under this paragraph.
1.a. Applicant used marijuana at least thirteen times from 2007 through at least
July  2019.  According  to  Applicant  in  his  Answer  he  used  marijuana  primarily  while  in
college  and  during  his  period  of  unemployment.  However,  Applicant  admitted  on  his
most recent e-QIP using marijuana twice while working for his current employer. (Item
2, Item 3 at Section 23, Item 4 at Section 23.)
1.b.  Applicant used ecstasy two times, once in December 2012 and the second
time  in  October  2014.  In  his  2019  e-QIP  Applicant  stated,  “Have  not  used  in  nearly  5
years and have no desire to use again, there is no added benefit. No longer associate
with environments prone to use.” (Item 2, Item 3 at Section 23.)
1.c.   Applicant  used  marijuana  twice  and  ecstasy  once  during  the  time  that  he
held  a  Department  of  Defense  security  clearance  during  his  current  employment.
Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management
on October 23, 2019. The Report of Investigation (ROI) reports Applicant admitted that
his employer had a drug use policy, but he did not know what it was. (Item 5.)
With regard to future use Applicant stated in his Answer:
I no longer associate with those that partake and avoid environments that
are  conducive  to  use.  I’ve  realized  the  importance  of  my  work  and  the
people that it impacts. I make my work a priority in my life as well as my
health  and  wellbeing.  With  these  factors  in  mind,  I  have  no  desire  to
continue  use.  I  believe  my  honesty  and  being  forthcoming  with  these
violations during my investigation also express how much I value my work,
my maturity, and my intentions to discontinue use.
Applicant’s statements to the OPM investigator were similar to those found in his
Answer. It is also noted that Applicant stated in his most recent e-QIP that he had, “No
desire  to  use  [marijuana]  in  future.  Primary focus  now is on  career  and  better  lifestyle
choices.  The  consequences outweigh  any  added  benefit  from  use.” (Item  3  at  Section
23, Item 5.)
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  evidence  concerning  the  quality  of  his  job
performance.  He  submitted  no  character  references  or  other  evidence  tending  to
establish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or  reliability.  I  was  unable  to  evaluate  his
credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided

"Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  eligibility  for  access  to
classified  information.  He  is  employed  as  a  control  center  specialist  for  a  security
monitoring company doing business in the defense industry. He has had this job since
November  2015.  His  educational  background  includes  attendance  at  two  community
colleges during 2008-2011. He was awarded an associate degree in applied sciences in
May  2011.  He  then  attended  a  state  university  during  2011-2014.  He  was  awarded  a
bachelor’s degree in science in May 2014. He has never married and has no children.
Applicant submitted a security clearance application for the first time in February
2017.  (Exhibit  3)  In  doing  so,  he  disclosed  a  history  of  illegal  drug  use  consisting  of
using marijuana. He reported smoking marijuana recreationally approximately 50 to 100
times while a college student during 2008-2014. He stated that he did not intend to use
marijuana or controlled substances in the future. He explained marijuana did little for his
enthusiasm for work and it limited his career potential.
About four months later in June 2017, Applicant was arrested for a drunk-driving
incident.  (Exhibit  5)  He  consumed  a  combination  of  8  to  9  beers  or  mixed  drinks  at
home and at a bar. He left the bar and attempted to drive home, but the police stopped
him  driving  the  wrong  way  on  an  Interstate  highway.  He  stopped  voluntarily,  but  then
fled the scene when the police approached his car. The police subsequently forced him
to stop by disabling his automobile with spike strips. A breathalyzer test administered at
the police station resulted in a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of .20%, which is well above
the  legal  limit.  The  police  charged  him  with  multiple  offenses,  including  aggravated
driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI)  and  resisting  arrest.  He  subsequently pleaded  guilty  to
the lesser included offense of driving while ability impaired and the other charges were
dismissed.
In May 2019, Applicant was granted eligibility for access to classified information,
commonly  referred  to  as  a  security  clearance.  A  few  months  later  in  July  2019,
Applicant  was  subject  to  a  random  drug  screen,  and  he  tested  positive  for  the  illegal
drug known as marijuana. (Exhibit 4)
Applicant did not provide any explanatory information in his Answer to the SOR,
and  he  did  not  reply  to  the  FORM,  but  he  offered  some  explanation  during  his
November 2019 background investigation. (Exhibit 5) He stated that he was traumatized
in  May  2017  when  he  was  confronted  outside  his  workplace  by  a  man  with  a  firearm
who threatened to shoot or kill him. The binge-drinking episode and the resulting drunk-
driving incident occurred the following month in June 2017.
Applicant’s  trauma   included   recurrent  nightmares.   He  had   not  used  any
marijuana   from   2014   to   2017,  but  resumed   using   it  after  the   May   2017   confrontation.
(Exhibit 5  at 4) He used  marijuana  about five  times per month  during  May-June  2017.
He  stopped   for   a   time   after  the   June   2017   drunk-driving   incident.  He  then   resumed
using  marijuana  as  a  means  to  deal with  stress after a  June  2018  breakup. (Exhibit 5  at
4)  He continued smoking marijuana until about July 2019 when he tested  positive during
the random  drug  test at work.
Applicant reported receiving counseling for his alcohol use and illegal drug use.
(Exhibit 5) He successfully completed alcohol counseling during October 2017-February
2018. He stated that he no longer drives after drinking. He also successfully completed
drug counseling during July 2019-October 2019. He has not used any illegal drug other
than marijuana. He denies any further illegal drug use after July 2019, when he tested
positive for marijuana.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
1   Department  of  the  Navy   v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be   obvious   that  no   one   has   a
‘right’  to a security  clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no
right to a security clearance).
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.6  An
Applicant  is  responsible  for  presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or
mitigate  facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.7  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8
Discussion
Under Guideline H for drug involvement  and substance misuse, the  concern as
set forth in AG ¶ 24 is that:
[t]he   illegal  use   of  controlled   substances,  to   include   the   misuse   of
prescriptions and  non-prescription  drugs, and  the  use  of  other substances
that   cause   physical  or  mental  impairment   or  are   use   in   a   manner
inconsistent  with   their   intended   purpose,  can   raise   questions  about  an
individual’s  reliability   and   trustworthiness,  both   because   such   behavior
may   lead   to   physical  or  psychological  impairment  and   because   it  raises
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply  with laws, rules,
and regulations. . .  .
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance abuse;
AG ¶  25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug;
2 484 U.S. at 531.
3  484 U.S. at 531.

5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.14.
7 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
8 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
AG  ¶   25(f)  any  illegal  drug  use  while  granted  access  to  classified
information or holding a sensitive position;
AG  ¶   26(a)  the   behavior  happened   so   long   ago,  was  so   infrequent,  or
happened  under such  circumstances that it is  unlikely  to  recur or does not
cast  doubt  on   the   individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or   good
judgment; and
AG  ¶   26(b) the  individual acknowledges  his or her drug involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including  but  not
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)
changing  or  avoiding  the  environment  where  drugs  were  used;  and  (3)
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility.
I  have   considered   the   totality   of  Applicant’s  involvement  with   marijuana.  It
consisted  of  his recreational use  of  marijuana  while  in college  during  2008-2014, which
was then  followed  by  periodic marijuana  use  in 2017, 2018, and  2019.  His most recent
marijuana  use  was detected  by  a  random  drug  test  in  July  2019. Some  of  his marijuana
use   occurred   during   his  employment  with   a   federal  contractor  and   while   he   held  a
security   clearance.  Any   illegal  drug   use   is  relevant   in  the   context  of   evaluating   a
person’s security  worthiness, but it is particularly  egregious if  it occurs during  the  course
of  employment while granted access to classified information.
Applicant’s case  in mitigation  is not  very  strong. The  one  item  that stands  out in
his  favor  is  the   May  2017   incident  when   he   was  confronted   by   a   stranger  who
threatened   him   with   a   firearm.  Acting   out   or   engaging   in  self-medicating   behavior with
marijuana or alcohol or both would not be unusual in such circumstances.
Nonetheless,   I  am   not  persuaded   that  Applicant  is  an   acceptable   security   risk
within  the   meaning   of   ¶   2(a)  of   Appendix   A   of   Enclosure  2   to   the   Directive.  I   reached
this conclusion  for a  couple of reasons. First, his most recent July  2019  marijuana  use
was clearly  forbidden  conduct that he  chose  to  engage  in  despite  knowing  the  potential
negative   consequences.  In   addition   to   being   a   serious  lapse   in  good   judgment,   his
marijuana  use  demonstrated  a  willingness to  engage  in  high-risk behavior, which does
not   make   him   a   good   candidate   for   a   security   clearance.   Second,   I   doubt   Applicant’s
most   recent  marijuana   use   would  have   come   to   light  but  for  the   random   drug   test.
Indeed, he  did not report his marijuana  use  during 2017-2019  to his employer  before the
random  drug  test.  Taken  together, the  seriousness of his  misconduct  and  his  failure  to
voluntarily  self-report his marijuana  use  undermine  his security  suitability. Finally, I note
that  the   ultimate   outcome   here   is  consistent  with   similar  cases  that  I  have   decided
involving   illegal  drug   use   while   holding   a   security   clearance.  E.g.,   ISCR   Case   No.   17-
02225  (May, 10, 2019), which was affirmed  by  the  DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR  Case
No. 17-02225 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019).
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent standard, I have  doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good   judgment,  and   ability   to   protect
classified   or  sensitive   information.   In   reaching   this  conclusion,  I  weighed   the   evidence
as  a   whole  and   considered   if   the   favorable  evidence   outweighed   the   unfavorable
evidence  or  vice versa. I also considered  the  whole-person  concept. I conclude  that he
has not  met his  ultimate  burden  of persuasion  to  show  that  it is clearly  consistent with
the  national interest  to  grant him  eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:

It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. Eligibility is denied.
Michael H. Leonard
Administrative Judge
9  The June 2017 drunk-driving incident in SOR ¶ 2.a is decided for Applicant. His questionable judgment
in  light  of  the  incident  is  mitigated  by  the  passage  of  time  without  recurrence,  his  participation  in  an
alcohol-counseling program, and his modified consumption of alcohol.
10  The cross-allegation in SOR ¶ 2.b concerns Applicant’s questionable judgment in light of his  marijuana
use. After considering the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E, the matter
is decided against Applicant under the rationale discussed above under Guideline H. Further discussion
under Guideline E is redundant.

"Applicant’s  personal  information   is  extracted   from   his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated  by  a  parenthetical citation  to  the  record. After a  thorough  and  careful review  of
the   pleadings,  Applicant’s  testimony,  the   testimony   of   his  wife,  and   the   documentary
evidence in the record, I make  the  following findings of  fact.
Applicant is 35 and was married in October 2019. He and his wife have no children,
but they hope to start a family in the near future. He earned a bachelor’s degree in May
2008. Since his graduation, he has worked at three major U.S. manufacturing companies
as  an  engineer.  He  began  working  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  in
August 2019 as a senior engineer. This company sponsored Applicant for his first security
clearance, and shortly after beginning this job, he submitted his SCA. (Tr. at 13-14, 30,
39-40.)
Drug Involvement
Applicant testified that he never used any illegal drugs or misused any prescription
medications  of  third  parties  during  his  high  school  or  college  years.  In  his  SCA,  he
disclosed multiple instances of illegal drug use commencing in December 2012 when he
was  27  years  old  and  ending  in  July 2019  when  he  was  34.  He  began  working  at  his
second post-college job  in August 2011. All of  his illegal drug use occurred during the
period  he  was  employed  by  this company.  His  employer  had  a  strict  policy  prohibiting
alcohol and illegal drugs in the workplace. It tests all prospective employees for drug use.
Under certain circumstances described in its policy, the employer tests its employees for
illegal drug use, including random drug use. (Tr. at 15, 20-21, 32-37, 39-40; GE 1 at 14,
54-57; GE 3 at 1-4.)
Notwithstanding his employer’s drug-free workplace policy, Applicant began using
cocaine in December 2012. He used cocaine on about 15 occasions in social settings
and  at  home  with  his  girlfriend,  who  is  now his  wife.  At  the  hearing,  he  described  the
frequency of his cocaine use as two times or less per year for eight years. His last use
was  July  2019,  about  one  month  before  he  began  working  for  his  security  clearance
sponsor. That use occurred at his bachelor’s party prior to his wedding in 2019. Before
that, he used cocaine once in September 2018 at a music festival. Most of his cocaine
use was during the period 2012 to 2016 in social settings. He testified that cocaine use
was common in his local social scene. (Tr. at 15, 20-21, 32-37, 39-40.)
In addition to cocaine, Applicant disclosed in his SCA and testified at the hearing
that he had used marijuana on three occasions during the period April 2014 to  April or
June 2017. He also disclosed and testified that he used ecstasy on four occasions during
the period April 2014 to September 2018. He explained in his SCA and at the hearing that
his  drug  use  was  largely  associated  with  attending  music  festivals  and  with  three
individuals. He no longer associates with those individuals. One was a former roommate
who has died. The second was a friend who moved to a different state far from Applicant’s
home. The third was a friend with whom Applicant no longer associates due to changes
Applicant has made in his lifestyle, particularly with respect to drug use. He also testified
that he is no longer involved in his local, drug-using social scene. (Tr. at 20-22; GE 1 at
55-56.
In  addition  to  Applicant’s  illegal  drug  use,  he  has  also  misused  prescription
Adderall belonging to a third party. He wrote in his SCA and testified at the hearing that
this illegal drug use occurred on two occasions, in April 2014 and April 2017. He has no
intention of ever misusing this prescription drug again. (Tr. at 20-21; GE 1 at 57.)
Applicant testified that he was aware that his illegal drug use was inconsistent with
the policies of his second employer where he worked from 2011 to 2019. He knew that
he was taking a risk that he might fail a random drug test required by the employer or if
he was arrested for possession of an illegal drug. (Tr. at 35-37.)
Since Applicant began his new job with his DoD contractor in August 2019, he has
committed to making changes and living a drug-free lifestyle. His employer drug-tested
him before he began his job. He has not used any illegal drugs since August 2019. He
offered into evidence three negative drug-test reports that were taken over the last four
months. In December 2020, Applicant also voluntarily attended an eight-hour drug and
alcohol awareness class. In his Answer, he provided a signed statement in which he wrote
that he had no intention to ever use illegal drugs again and acknowledged that any future
drug  use  would  be  grounds  for  the  automatic  revocation  of  his  security  clearance
eligibility.  He  married  his  long-time  girlfriend  in  October  2019  with  a  view  to  having
children with her. They plan to purchase a home in the near future. (Answer at 8; Tr. at
23, 39-40; AE K - N.)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s wife testified on his behalf as a  character witness and about his past
drug use. She said that she was aware of her husband’s drug use. She learned about this
behavior from Applicant after he spent time with his friends. She does not believe that her
husband’s past drug use ever affected his professional or personal  life in any way. She
admitted that the two of them have also used cocaine, ecstasy, and marijuana together
on rare occasions. The last time they used any illegal drugs was in 2017. She testified
that since Applicant began his current job, he has taken his career more seriously. Around
the same time, they also became engaged. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he works from
home and she sees first-hand how hard he works to perform well in his job. She views
Applicant as honest and trustworthy. She noted that she is presently a student and is not
employed. As a result, she is relying solely on her husband to support her financially. She
believes he is sincere about his decision to live a drug-free lifestyle and is firmly committed
to this change in his life. (Tr. at 13-19.)
Applicant also offered ten character reference letters. Six of the letters are personal
references from friends, including his wife, who are aware of Applicant’s past drug use.
The  other  four  letters  are  professional  references.  These  individuals  are  unaware  of
Applicant’s history of using illegal drugs. His friends describe him as honest, trustworthy,
reliable, loyal, and dependable. In his youth, he was an Eagle Boy Scout, evidencing his
character and dedication to hard work. They do not view his past drug use as a habit or
an  abuse.  His  professional  references  praise  Applicant’s  technical  skills,  dedication,
reliability, and trustworthiness. Significantly, Applicant made a full disclosure of his past
drug use in his SCA and during his background interview. (Tr. at 24; AE A-J.)

"Applicant  is  56  years  old.  He  has  a  Bachelor’s  degree.  He  is  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  as  a  Software  Engineer  IV.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance in connection with his employment.  Applicant has no military service.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant admits the single allegation under this guideline.  (Government Exhibit
1.)  He has used marijuana off and on from approximately 2014 to at least March 2020.
Applicant began using marijuana in his senior year of high school, and smoked it five or
six times total.  In college his use of marijuana increased to five times weekly.  In 1989,
he focused on family obligations and raising his children, and he did not use marijuana
again until 2014.  From 2014 to the present, Applicant has used marijuana weekly with
friends  at  their  homes,  social  events  or  gatherings.  He  has  also  used  it  at  his  own
residence on weekends.  Applicant continues to use marijuana.  He now uses marijuana
once  or  twice  a  week.  Applicant  stated  that  he  uses  marijuana  because  he  finds  it
relaxing and fun.  He obtains it by purchasing it.  Applicant claims that he has told his
supervisor that he uses marijuana and his supervisor did not comment.  Applicant does
not know if his employer has a drug policy.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  September  2014.  On
January 29, 2020, Applicant completed a security clearance application.  (Government
Exhibit 2.)  After completing this application, Applicant has continued to use marijuana.
(Government Exhibit 1.)  Applicant intends to continue smoking marijuana in the future.

Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.  He is employed by
a  defense  contractor  as  a  Software  Engineer.  He  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security
clearance in connection with his employment.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  sexual  misconduct  extending  over  a  period  of  twelve
years.  (Government Exhibits  3 and 4.)  He began  working for his current employer in
July 2002, and has held a security clearance since about 2003 or 2005.  (Government
Exhibit  1,  and  Tr.  p.  49.)  Applicant  admits  in  part  and  denies  in  part  the  sole  factual
allegation set forth in the SOR.  (Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.)
Applicant  was  born  in  Burma,  Myanmar.  He  came  to  the  United  States  at  the
age  of  four.  He  grew  up  in  the  United  States,  and  obtained  his  college  degree  here.
After graduating from college, he was hired by his current employer with whom he has
worked for the past nineteen years.  He possessed a security clearance for fifteen years
without  incident.  He  has  a  favorable  work  history.  Over  the  years,  he  has  received
salary increases and promotions for good performance.  (Tr. p. 23.)
In May 2017, during an interview with a polygraph examiner as part of a security
clearance background investigation  conducted  by  another agency,  Applicant  disclosed
that  he  paid  prostitutes  for  sexual  intercourse  and  other  sexual  services,  both  in  the
United States and overseas on at least 27 occasions between 2008 and 2016.  In 2017,
Applicant  was  denied  his  security  clearance  by  another  agency  as  a  result  of  the
investigation.  Following this denial, Applicant continued to engage in sexual misconduct
on at least three more occasions, the most recent time occurred in 2019.  He estimates
that over the years, he has spent approximately $6,500 for sexual services.  Applicant
states that he paid prostitutes for sex in the United States and in foreign countries while
on  vacation.  Applicant  further  stated  that  he  knew  soliciting  prostitution  was  illegal  in
the  United  States.  He  also  acknowledged  that  it  was  dangerous.  Despite  this,  he
stated  that  he  never  picked  up  a  random  prostitute.  He  figured  that  since  he  did  not
pick the girls up off of the street, but, instead went to a massage parlor  to obtain their
services,  in  a  country  where  he  believed  it  to  be  legal,  it  was  less  risky.  To  him,  it
appeared  to  be  like  official  business  in  those  places.  (Tr.  pp.  29-42.)  Applicant  has
never reported any of this sexual misconduct to his security officer or to anyone at his
company.  (Tr. p. 29.)
Applicant further explained that when he was in a foreign country and sought out
sexual  services  from a  prostitute,  he  did  not  know that  it  could  have  an  impact  on  his
security clearance.  He believed it to be legal in the foreign country he was visiting and
so he did not give it any further concern.  During his interview on May 2017, Applicant
stated that he did not see anything wrong with this type of behavior.  He adds that his
sexual  activities  have  always  been  private,  consensual  and  discreet.  He  has  never
sought treatment for sexual addiction nor does he believe he has a problem in this area.
Applicant has not hired a prostitute for sex since 2019.
Five performance evaluations of the Applicant for the periods from 2016 through
2020 are all favorable.  Applicant has been rated as either an “Excellent Performer” or a
“Top Performer” during these rating periods.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)

"I have incorporated Applicant’s admissions in his Answer in my findings of fact and
have noted therein his admissions and comments on his debts and his past drug use. I
note that Applicant failed to admit or deny in his Answer the falsification allegation in SOR
¶  3.a.  I  have  treated  that  allegation  as  denied.  Applicant’s  personal  information  is
extracted from GE 1, his 2017 SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation
to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony,
and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant, 34, is married and has two young children. He received a high school
diploma in 2004 and has taken some college courses, but he has not earned a degree.
In December 2008, he received a Correctional Academy Certificate. (Tr. at 17.)
Starting  in  2009  at  age  19,  Applicant  sought  a  position  in  law  enforcement,
specifically with CBP. At that time, it was important to him work in that field. In 2009, he
submitted  an  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigative  Processing  (e-QIP)  seeking
employment with CBP. After taking a polygraph examination in July 2013, he was advised
that he was not going to be considered. He testified that he never inquired why he was
disqualified. He testified that at the point, he had “already invested myself into the career
I am currently at now.” (Tr. at 17-20, 25, 58-61, 73.)
In November 2012, Applicant began his career working as a contractor for the U.S.
Navy performing ship repairs. In about February 2018, he started working for his current
employer  in  the  same  field.  Initially,  he  took  a  pay  cut  of  about  $10,000  because  he
believed that he would advance quickly and would ultimately earn a higher income. He
has  since  been  promoted  to  be  a  site  manager  and  a  level-one  supervisor  for  this
company,  a  Navy  contractor,  which  is  sponsoring  Applicant  to  apply  for  a  security
clearance. According to Applicant, he presently has an interim clearance. (Tr. at 18-20,
25, 58-61, 68.)
Financial Considerations
In  September  2012,  Applicant began  to  experience financial  difficulties  after  his
wife was laid off. She was pregnant at the time with their first child. She lost her annual
income of $40,000 to $50,000. As a result, Applicant and his family had to live solely on
his income, which was $70,000 to $75,000. In the following months, Applicant was unable
to pay his bills. On the advice of an attorney, he filed for bankruptcy on May 13, 2013,
under Chapter 7. (GE 2 at 3; GE 8 at 1-4; AE H; Tr. at 20-22.)
In addition to Applicant’s 2013 bankruptcy, the SOR alleges three delinquent debts
owed to a credit union, two credit-card accounts and one loan opened by Applicant to
consolidate his debts. He opened these accounts after his bankruptcy discharge, hoping
to  reestablish  his  prior  solid  credit.  The  Government’s  evidence  reflects  that  the  three
debts  became  delinquent  in  mid-2016.  Applicant  testified  that  at  that  time,  he  was  not
making enough money to pay his bills. He was earning about $75,000 per year. (GE 5 at
3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 4-5; GE 10 at 2; Tr. at 23, 31-33, 54.)
As described generally above and alleged in the SOR, Applicant has the following
three delinquent debts owed to a credit union:
SOR  ¶   1.a   -  Credit-Card   Account   in  the   amount   of   $20,304.   Applicant  opened  this
account in August 2013, the same month as his bankruptcy discharge. The credit limit on
the account was $19,300. He defaulted on this account in 2016. In late 2018, he received
a promotion and a pay raise. In February 2019, he entered into a payment plan with the
credit union to repay this debt at the monthly rate of $100. At the time, he was earning a
higher salary and could afford to begin paying his three debts owed to the credit union.
The  payment  plan  for  this  debt  is  scheduled  to  continue  for  202  months,  or  about  17
years. Applicant provided documentation from the creditor evidencing his compliance with
his payment plan. He intends to begin paying this debt off sooner with funds from a merit
pay raise he expects to receive soon and with excess money he will have once his other
debts to the credit union are paid off. This debt is being resolved. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at
2; GE 7 at 4-5; GE 10 at 2; AE E at 3; Tr. at 22-28.)
SOR  ¶   1.b   -  Debt-Consolidation Loan   Account   in  the   amount  of   $7,486.  Applicant
opened this account in October 2015. He defaulted on this account in May 2016, about
seven  months  later.  Again  in  February  2019,  he  entered  into  a  payment  plan  with  the
credit union to repay this debt at the monthly rate of $100 for  77 months. He provided
documentation  from  the  creditor evidencing his  compliance  with  his  payment  plan.  He
plans  to  increase  his  monthly  payments  with  his  next  pay  raise.  This  debt  is  being
resolved. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 5; GE 10 at 2; AE E at 1; Tr. at 27-28.)
SOR  ¶   1.c   -  Credit-Card  Account   in  the   amount   of   $3,319.   Applicant  opened  this
account in September 2015. He defaulted on the debt in May 2016. Since March 2019,
he has been paying the creditor $50 per month. He provided documentation reflecting his
payments  and  current  status  under  the  payment  plan.  He  intends  to  repay  the  entire
amount more quickly than the 68 months provided for under the plan. This debt is being
resolved. (GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 5; GE 10 at 2; AE E at 2; Tr. at 29.)
The fourth allegation under Guideline F in the SOR is the following:
SOR  ¶   1.d   -  2013   Chapter  7   Bankruptcy   Petition.  Applicant  filed  his petition  in  May
2013. He listed about $35,000 of unsecured debts and $39,000 of secured debts, which
were  debts  on  two  vehicles.  He  returned  the  two  vehicles  to  the  lenders,  and  his
unsecured debts and the balances of the auto loans were discharged in August 2013. As
explained above, he was unable to pay his debts in 2013 because his wife had lost her
job and he was unable to pay the family expenses without her income. (GE 8 at 1-2; AE
H; Tr. at 30-31, 46, 54-55, 80-81.)
Applicant considers himself financially stable, and he works hard to live within his
means. He has taken a financial-counseling class online that taught financial planning,
budgeting, and investments. As a result of his past financial problems, he has learned to
budget his expenses and avoid overspending. He uses a computerized bill-pay system
to plan and track his spending. Aside from the above three debts, he pays off his debts
every month and has zero balances. Applicant testified that his wife is now reemployed,
and she uses her income to pay some small bills. She has no separate debts and has
good  credit.  His  annual  income  has  increased  to  approximately  $91,000,  and  his  wife
earns another $55,000 to $60,000. He also has a retirement account with about $43,000
in assets. He maintains a savings account with about $3,500 to $4,000 for emergencies.
(AE D; AE F; Tr. at 23, 31-34, 49-54.)
Drug Involvement
Applicant testified that the last time he used any illegal drugs was in 2004. He was
a senior in high school at the time. His use of marijuana was experimental. He no longer
associates with his high school friends who used marijuana with him. He always avoids
environments where drug use might occur. In addition, he has signed a statement of intent
in  which  he  pledged  never  to  use  any  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  He  has  also  tested
negative for drug use for seven or eight months preceding the hearing.  In addition, he
completed an online, drug-counseling course. He has no intent to use illegal drugs in the
future because he does not approve of them, and with his two children, he wants to set
the right example for them. (AE J; AE K; AE L; Tr. at 35-38.)
As noted, Applicant aspired to work in law enforcement. He aggressively pursued
this career goal for three years. He applied for a position with the CBP in 2009. He testified
that the hiring process took an unusually long time, in part, due to a hiring freeze at CBP.
He also testified that he was randomly tested for illegal drug use and no longer used any
illegal  drugs  while  his  application  was  pending.  One  of  the  last  requirements  of  the
application process was a polygraph exam, which he took in July 2013. (GE 1 at 13; GE
2 at 2; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 37; Tr. at 40-44, 66, 69, 73, 75-78, 86-88.)
By that point, Applicant had settled in a new career as a Navy contractor beginning
in November 2012. He no longer dreamed of working in law enforcement after his son
was born in September 2012 and his wife was unemployed. Nevertheless, he took the
CBP polygraph in July 2013. As set forth in the examiner’s Polygraph Report, Applicant
admitted during the examination that he used marijuana approximately 20 times between
2000 and August 2012. Accordingly, his first use was while in high school and his last use
was about one year before the polygraph. (GE 1 at 13; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 37;
Tr. at 40-44, 66, 69, 73, 75-78, 86-88.)
Applicant  also  admitted  to  the  examiner  that  he  purchased  marijuana  on  about
three occasions. At the hearing, he provided no testimony disputing the accuracy of GE
3 with respect to this statement regarding purchasing marijuana. (GE 3 at 1.)
Applicant, however, disputes the accuracy of GE 3 on one critical point. He testified
that he told the examiner that he  only used marijuana during the period 2004 to 2005.
The examiner asked him to provide a range of the dates of use, and Applicant responded
with  this  range  just  so  that  he  would  “make  myself  look  better.  I  had  never  done  a
polygraph.” He testified that he subsequently received a letter from CBP stating that he
was “disqualified” for employment with that agency. While disappointed, he testified that
he was “in a better place” at the time he received the CBP letter. He had already started
working in his new career field. (GE 3 at 1; Tr. at 40-44, 60, 63-64, 66, 69, 75-79, 86-87.)
At  one  point  in  his  testimony,  described  above,  Applicant  said  that  he  never
inquired  about  the  CBP’s  reason  for  its  disqualification  decision.  (Tr.  at  60.)  He
subsequently testified that the disqualification letter advised him that  he was not being
considered  for  employment  at  CBP  because  he  did  not  initially  tell  the  truth  about  his
marijuana  use  on  his  2009  e-QIP.  (Tr.  at  76-77.)  The  letter  explained  further  that  he
admitted in his polygraph that his marijuana use was more extensive than three times in
2004,  which  is  what  he  disclosed  in  his  e-QIP.  In  his  testimony,  he  denied  that  the
disqualification letter referred to drug use as recent as 2012. Moreover, he denied ever
telling the examiner that his last use was in August 2012. He cannot explain why that date
appears in GE 3. The first time he saw GE 3 was after the issuance of the SOR when he
requested his investigative file. (GE 3 at 1; Tr. at 40-44, 60-64, 66, 68-69, 75-79, 86-87.)
Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately omitted information in his 2017 SCA
relating to his use of marijuana. He answered, “No,” to a question in Section 23 regarding
drug use in the past seven years. The SOR alleges that he intentionally provided a false
response  to  this  question.  As  noted,  GE  3  evidences  that  Applicant  did  indeed  use
marijuana  in  the  prior  seven-year  period,  which  dates  back  to  2010.  At  the  hearing,
Applicant  testified  that,  other than  the  admission  relating to  marijuana,  the  admissions
summarized  in GE 3 were  accurate.  Applicant denies, however,  that GE 3  is accurate
with respect to the period of  time he admitted to using marijuana,  i.e., 2000 to August
2012. He claimed he only admitted using marijuana in 2004 to 2005, which was outside
of the reportable, seven-year period in the SCA. (Tr. at 39-40, 44, 64-66.)
Character Evidence
Applicant offered 15 character reference letters, his two most recent performance
evaluations from his current employer, and nine certifications of his training and a history
of his post-high school coursework. One letter is from a long-time friend and the others
are  from  current  and  former  supervisors,  co-workers,  and  subordinates.  Each  person
praises Applicant enthusiastically as a dedicated, highly trained, and skilled worker. They
believe  him  to  be  honest  and  trustworthy  and  a  person  of  integrity  and  character.
Applicant testified that only one of his references is aware of the Government’s security
concerns raised in the SOR. That person is his current supervisor. The supervisor’s letter
is one of Applicant’s strongest letters of recommendation. (AE B; Tr. at 70, 72.)
Applicant’s two  job  performance  evaluations praise his leadership skills, discuss
his promotion, and compliment his mentorship and training efforts. Applicant’s work team
has an excellent safety record because of his leadership. He exceeded expectations and
his performance was rated as “STRONG/OUTSTANDING.”(AE G; AE I.)
The  certificates  Applicant  presented  evidence  the  significant  amount  of  time
Applicant  has  invested  in  his  training  and  his  expertise  in  his  field.  They  support  his
employer’s view expressed in its annual performance evaluations of Applicant that he is
well trained in all aspects of his job, particularly in the critical area of safety. (AE I.)

"Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where she works as
an associate software developer. She has a Bachelor’s degree. She is seeking to obtain
national security eligibility for a security clearance in connection with her employment in
the Defense industry. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections12 and 13A.)
Paragraph  1 (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
due  to  her  use  of  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  allegations  1.a  and  1.b  under  this
paragraph.
1.a.  Applicant  has  used  marijuana  on  a  daily  basis,  with  some  breaks,  since
approximately 2014.  Applicant  stated  that  she  used marijuana  in  an  attempt  to  relieve
work-related  stress.  She  stated  in  her  Answer,  “Marijuana  allows  me  to  manage  my
anxiety without hurting my ability to do good work.” (Item 3 at 4.)
1.b. Applicant stated that she intended to continue to use marijuana at the same
level.
Applicant stated that her marijuana use is responsible. She sees a therapist and
has a state-issued medical marijuana card. Applicant argued that the Federal proscription
on marijuana use is outdated. (Answer; Applicant Exhibit A.)
MITIGATION
Appellant submitted her resume and her most recent performance review. She is
a talented software developer. Her manager stated, “[Applicant] has proven herself to be
a  smart,  capable,  team  player  and  hard  worker.”  The  manager  further  stated  that
Applicant, “has exceeded expectations in tasks and deliverables she has worked on.”

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted both allegations in the SOR. He also provided
some  explanation  for  his  conduct.  I  adopt  his  admissions  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact. (Item 2)
Applicant is 52 years old. He is married with no children. He served in his state’s
Army  National  Guard  from  2004-2011  and  was  honorably discharged.  He  has  worked
as  a  federal  contractor  since  2011.  He  holds  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  has  held  a
security clearance since at least 2010. (Item 4)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  misused  prescription  medication  from  approximately
June 2017  to  August 2020.  The SOR also alleged he  misused this prescription  medicine
after  being   granted   a   security   clearance.   His  admissions  in  his   June   2020   security
clearance   application   (SCA),  in  his  November  2020   answers  to   interrogatories,  and   in
his answer to  the  SOR, provide  sufficient evidence  to  support the  allegations. (Items 3-
5)
Applicant  claims  he  abused  the  prescription  drug  Hydrocodone  from  2017  to
2020 because he suffers from a medical condition for which he was not receiving proper
medical  treatment.  At  the  time  of  his  drug  abuse,  he  held  a  security  clearance.  He
obtained the Hydrocodone from his wife, who has a legal prescription for it. He used the
drug  intermittently,  about  three  times  a  month,  to  manage  pain  because  over-the-
counter  pain  medicines  did  not  work  for  him.  At  the  time  Applicant  was  questioned
during  his  last  background  investigation  in  August  2020,  he  had  not  reported  this
prescription  drug  abuse  to  his  employer.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  was  thinking
about reporting the abuse, but had not yet made the decision to do so. He claims that
he stopped using the drug in August 2020. (Items 3-5; AE A)
Applicant  claims  that  he  started  seeing  a  local  physician  about  his  medical
condition  in  August  2020.  He  also  stated  that  he  was  in  the  process  of  contacting  a
rheumatologist to address his arthritic issues. He did not provide any medical records,
diagnoses,  or  prognoses  from  either  of  the  doctors.  He  also  stated  that  he  used  his
employer’s  anonymous  tip-line  to  inquire  about  how to  report his past  drug abuse.  He
also  volunteered  for  regular  drug  testing.  He  has  not  received  any  drug  counseling  or
treatment. He did not provide any information about whether his wife still has access to
Hydrocodone.  He  claimed  his  civilian  performance  reviews  were  good,  but  he  did  not
provide any supporting documentation. I was unable to determine Applicant’s credibility
based  on  demeanor,  because  he  chose  an  administrative  determination  rather  than  a
hearing. (Items 3, 5; AE A)

"Applicant  is  36  years  old.  He  has  never  been  married  and  has  no  children.  He
earned a bachelor’s degree in 2007 and his master’s degree in 2011. In 2007, he started
employment  with  a  federal  contactor,  and  in  2012,  he  was  granted  a  DOD  security
clearance.  His  current  job  title  is  advanced  lead  engineer  and  his  annual  salary  is
approximately $110,000. (Tr. 8, 26; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges Applicant failed to file his 2016, 2017, and 2018 Federal income
tax  returns.  He  also  failed  to  file  his  state  income  tax  returns  for  the  same  years.  He
admitted both SOR allegations (¶ 1.a and ¶ 1.b)
Applicant stated in his response to the SOR that the reason he fell behind on filing
his Federal and  state income  tax returns  was  due to  his taxes  becoming complicated.
This  stemmed,  in  part,  from  both  a  rental  property and  him  becoming  part  owner  of  a
family business. He expected tax refunds for all three years, and mistakenly believed that
he had three years to file the income tax returns in order to receive his Federal and state
tax refunds. In early 2020 he hired an accountant who was working on filing these specific
Federal and state income tax returns. (SOR Response; Tr. 41-42)
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  had  purchased  a  house  in  early
2008. Instead of selling the house when he moved out in 2013, he chose to turn it into a
rental property. There were years that he made about $12,000 - $14,000 in annual income
from  this  rental  property,  and  there  were  other  years  the  house  sat  vacant  while  he
remodeled the  bathroom and finished  other projects  on  the  home.  Overall,  he  has  not
made much money from the rental property, and as of the date of the hearing, he  was
planning  to  put  the  rental  property  up  for  sale  within  the  next  month  or  two.  When
preparing his Federal and state income tax returns for 2016, he  realized he had some
questions about properly reporting his rental income and expenses. He decided that he
needed the services of a tax professional. (Tr. 28-30)
The  other tax  complication   Applicant encountered  was related  to  being  gifted  in
2017  with  six  percent ownership  of a  family  business. His aunt  operated  two  ice cream
kiosks in a  large  out-of-state  mall. In  2017, he  received  quarterly   checks of  $6,000, or
$24,000  annual  revenue  for his six  percent  ownership. In  2018,  major renovations  were
made   on   the   kiosks,  which  impacted   his  earnings.  This  and   other   business  situations
affected  his Federal and  state  income  taxes.  He used  Turbo  Tax  software, but he  did not
feel comfortable  that he  had  prepared  his income  tax  returns  correctly. He realized  that
he again needed  professional tax  assistance  to  report his income  correctly  to  the  Federal
and state tax authorities. (Tr. 30-32, 37, 42)
In   early   2020,  Applicant  hired   an   accounting   service  to   prepare  his  delinquent
2016, 2017,  and  2018  state  and  Federal income  tax  returns, and  to  prepare his income
tax  returns  for  2019  as  well. According  to  the  Internal Revenue  Service (IRS)  transcripts
in the  record, in  June 2020,  Applicant’s 2019  and  2018  Federal income  tax  returns were
filed. Applicant’s 2016  Federal income  tax  return was filed  in  June  2021. Applicant stated
that he  made  a  tax  payment to  the  IRS  in June  2018  due  to  the  income  he  earned  from
the   family   business  in   2017.  There  was  confusion   about  the   tax   payment,   which  was
actually  recorded  as Applicant  filing  his 2017  Federal tax  return in June  2018, based  on
the   IRS   transcript   in   evidence.   The   accounting   service  saw   that   his  2017   Federal  tax
return was  listed as “filed”  in the IRS database. The  accounting service assumed  he had
filed   all   of  his income  tax   returns for  tax   year  2017,  so  they   did not  process  his   newly
prepared   state   income   tax   return  for  2017.   Applicant   was  not   aware  of  this   until  he
received notification  last year  from the state tax authority that his 2017 income tax return
had  never been  filed. (Tr. 44-52; AE C)
Applicant testified  that  he  initiated  contact with  a  professional tax  service before
he  received  the  SOR. He provided  documentation  which showed  the  accounting  service
had  prepared  the  2017  state  income  tax  return in May  2020.  In  June  2021,  he  received  a
2017  state  tax  refund  of $348.  The  accounting  service  also prepared  his 2016,  2018,  and
2019  state  income  tax  returns  in May  2020. Applicant  received  tax  refunds for all  of  these
tax  years. He also provided  documentation  from  the  accounting  service showing  that he
filed his 2020  Federal and state income tax returns in June  2021.  He intends to continue
using   the   tax   accounting   service  to   prepare  his  complicated   income   tax   returns  in  the
future.  He will receive  a  Federal tax  refund  of  $2,733  and  a  state  tax  refund  of  $941  for
tax  year 2020. All  unfiled  Federal and  state  income  tax  returns alleged  in the  SOR have
been   filed   and   fully   resolved.   Applicant   lives   within  his  means  and   does  not  have   any
other  financial delinquencies,  to  include  any  delinquent  state  or Federal  taxes.  (Tr.  36,
52, 76-80; AE B, AE C, AE E, AE F)
Personal Conduct
The  SOR  alleges  that  in  August  2013,  Applicant  received  a  complaint  from  a
former girlfriend that he was stalking her, harassing her, and ignoring her boundaries. The
court  issued  a  temporary  ex-parte  civil  order  of  protection.  At  a  later  hearing  where
Applicant personally appeared to address the complaint, the court extended the civil order
of protection until August 2018. (¶ 2.a; GE 2, GE 3; AE A)
Applicant  admitted   the   allegation   that  he   received   the   protective   order,  but  not
necessarily  the  alleged  inappropriate  or criminal conduct alleged  in  the  protective  order
in his response  to  the  SOR, and he  also provided  additional information  during  the  hearing
about  the   circumstances  of  this   toxic  relationship.   He   stated   that   his  former  girlfriend
threatened  to  kill herself repeatedly, harassed  him  with  constant  e-mails, phone  calls and
messages,   and   texts  from   unknown   phone   numbers.  He   denied   that  he   stalked   her,
harassed  her, or threatened  her with  violence. He showed  up  to  court to  respond  to  the
protection  order without any  evidence  of  her communications, since  she  had  deleted  most
of them  from  his phone,  and without the benefit of  a lawyer. Since  August 2013, the time
the  civil  protection  order was granted,  he  has had  no  contact with  his former girlfriend.
The  protective  order expired  in  August  2018.  He has  never had  any  other adverse issues
with law enforcement.  (SOR response, Tr. 52-74;  AE A)

"The  Government  alleges  under  Guideline  H  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a
clearance  because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  He  admitted  through  counsel  “with
clarifications”  the  two  allegations  in  the  SOR  under  this  paragraph.  (SOR  Answer)
Those admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Background Information
Applicant is a  46-year-old senior principal engineer,  who  has been  employed  by
a  defense  contractor since  January  2005. (GE  1;  Tr.  12-13) He  seeks a  secret  security
clearance  to  enhance  his employability  and  upward mobility  within his company. (GE 1;
Tr. 13-14, 25-26, 28-30)
Applicant  never  received   his   high   school  diploma.  He  “had   some   hardship
growing  up  with  a  single mother.”  He quit  high  school, left  home,  and  got  a  full-time  job
at a  grocery  store when  he  was “about 17  years old,” after his mother attempted  suicide
in 1992.  (SOR  Answer; Tr. 14-15, 23-24)  Applicant “tested”  into  a  prestigious university,
and   was  awarded   a   bachelor  of   science   degree   in  mechanical  engineering   in  June
2003. He was awarded  a  master’s degree  in mechanical aerospace  engineering  in June
2005. He  completed  one  year of  coursework towards his Ph.D.  in  engineering; however,
he withdrew from the program “due  to  family considerations.” (Tr. 15-18, 24-29)
Applicant  married  in  June  1998  and  divorced  in April 2017.  He remarried  his wife
in  2018,  month   not   recalled.  He   has  two   minor  sons.  At  the   time   of   the   hearing,
Applicant’s  wife   was   unemployed,   having   previously  worked   as  an   administrative
assistant   for  a   university.   (GE  1;  Tr.  19-22,  46)  Applicant’s  annual  income   averages
about $150,000. However, 2020  was an  exception,  and  his  annual income  in 2020  was
$207,000. (Tr. 22)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana on various occasions between
approximately 1993 and June 2017, and SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that he used marijuana on
various  occasions  between  approximately  January  2005  and  September  2008,  while
granted accessed to classified information. (SOR; SOR Answer)
This is not Applicant’s first DOHA hearing for drug-related security concerns. On
August 23, 2011,  DOHA issued  Applicant an SOR, followed by a hearing on February
15, 2012, discussed below. He explained that his failure to be “fully truthful about some
past drug use” led to the denial of his clearance after that 2012 hearing. However, since
that  experience,   he   has  been   “totally   truthful”  throughout  these   proceedings  since   his
reapplication  for a security clearance.  (Tr. 32-35)  Applicant’s marijuana use began when
he   was  17   or  18.  Before  his  mother’s  suicide   attempt,  he   was  a   good   student  and
athlete.  He  was  involved   in  the   community   with   tutoring   and   mentoring.   After  his
mother’s  suicide   attempt,  he   began   associating   with   individuals  who   used   marijuana.
(Tr. 35-36)
Applicant broke  down  his drug  use  into  two  timeframes,  from  1993  to  2005, and
from  2005 to  the  present.  Applicant stopped using  marijuana  in 2005  at age  30  when  he
started  his current job  and  was trying  to  be  responsible  in  the  workforce.  (Tr. 36-38) He
could  not  recall   during   direct  examination   the   precise   number   of   times  he   used
marijuana  during  college. His wife  does not drink, smoke, or use  any   illegal drugs. (Tr.
46-47) After beginning  his current job  in 2005, he   stated  that he  used  marijuana  three
times.   (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  38-39)   The   last   time   he   used   marijuana   was  in  2017   at  his
father-in-law’s  funeral.   His  family   was  in  a   circle  sharing   memories,  and   a   “joint   was
passed   around.”  Applicant  had   previously   held  a   clearance   from   January   2005   to
September 2008  and  had   used  marijuana   a   “few   times” during   that period.   (Tr. 39-40)
Applicant knew it was wrong to do that and self-reported his marijuana use. (Tr. 40)
Applicant has disassociated himself  “100  percent” from  the  individuals with  whom
he   smoked   marijuana.   He  submitted   a   signed   statement  of   intent   to   abstain  from   all
drug   involvement  and  substance   abuse,   acknowledging   that  any  future   involvement or
misuse   is  grounds  for   revocation   of   national  security   eligibility.  He   also  submitted   a
Certificate  of  Completion  for a  four-hour Drug  and  Alcohol Awareness Class  completed
on  September   18,   2017.  Applicant  stated   that  he   has no  desire  to  use  marijuana,   and
he   does  not   have   any   intent  to   use   marijuana   in   the   future.   He  took   a   privately
administered   drug   test  on   January   11,   2021,  the   day   before  his  hearing   that  was
negative. (Tr. 40-42, 57; SOR Answer (Exhibits 1 and  2); AE B)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  was  informed  of  his  company’s  zero  tolerance
drug-use  policy  when  he  was  hired  in  2005.  He  has  never  been  required  to  take  a
random drug test since he began his employment. (Tr. 47-49)
During   cross-examination,  Department  Counsel   elicited   further  details  from
Applicant regarding  his  past marijuana  use.  During  his first year of employment in  2005,
he   used   marijuana   “about  five   times  during   holidays  and   visits  with   friends.”  The   next
year  in  2006,   he   used   marijuana   “about  three   times  during   holidays  with   friends.”   In
addition,   in   2007,  he   used   marijuana   “a   couple  of  times  also   during   the   holidays.”  In
2008, he  used marijuana  “about one  time.” (GE  2; Tr. 49-50)  When  Applicant completed
an  SF-86  on February  8, 2005, he  denied  any  prior drug  use. He completed  an  SF-86
on  May  15, 2008,  and  again denied  any  prior drug  use.  However, during  an  August 3,
2009   Office   of  Personnel  Management   (OPM)  interview   preceding   a   polygraph,  he
disclosed  his prior marijuana use.  (GE  3, GE  6, GE 8; Tr. 50-51)
As  noted,  Applicant  appeared  at  a  DOHA  hearing  on  February  15,  2012.  His
SOR listed three allegations of drug use to which he admitted. The Administrative Judge
noted  in  his  findings  that  Applicant  had  used  illegal  drugs  from  about  1993  to
September 2008. His SOR also listed four allegations under personal conduct to which
he  admitted.  In particular,  he  denied  using marijuana  in  the  previous  seven  years and
using  any  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  had
been  granted  a  security  clearance  in  November  2005,  and  eligibility  for  access  to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in July 2008. His clearance and SCI access
were  revoked  in  January  2010  because  of  drug  involvement  and  personal  conduct
issues. Applicant stated at his 2010 hearing that he did not currently use drugs and had
no desire to use drugs in the future. (GE 8, Tr. 52)
After his polygraph interview, Applicant stated that he did not use marijuana until
November 2016 when his father-in-law was placed in hospice care, then again in April
2017 at the birthday party for his wife and father-in-law, and again in June 2017 when
the  family  spread  his  father-in-law’s  ashes.  Applicant  knew  at  the  time  that  using
marijuana could affect his security clearance. He added that he was “a bit ignorant and
naïve  .  .  .  believing  that  the  laws  had  changed,”  but  knew  it  was  wrong  because  his
employer had a zero tolerance drug policy.  (Tr. 53-56) Applicant stated that he did not
use marijuana in 2018, 2019, 2020, or 2021. (Tr. 57) He also stated that he  has been
truthful about all of his past marijuana use. (Tr. 57-58)
Character Evidence
Applicant is active in his community. He has always sought to find a family within
the community. To that end, he coaches legal robotics and soccer, and has done so in
underrepresented communities. He was the team manager for his son’s soccer team for
the past four years. He also mentors junior engineers at his job site. Applicant earns a
good income and enjoys his work, but his career “hit a plateau” because of his inability
to work on classified projects. He considers himself a talented engineer who helped win
a  “multi-billion-dollar program,”  a program that he worked on for six years. (Tr.  22, 32,
42-44)
Applicant  submitted  several  pre- and post-employment certificates,  awards, and
academic  scholarships.  (SOR  Answer,  Exhibits,  3-6,  9)  His  2017  and  2018  annual
evaluations
reflect  sustained  superior  performance  and  document  Applicant’s
contributions  as  a  trusted  and  valued  employee.  His  2018  evaluation  notes  that
Applicant’s  technical  skills  are  “top  notch”  and  that  “he  is  always  willing  to  help.”  The
same evaluation gave him an overall rating of “Exceptional Contribution.” Applicant also
submitted  nine  work-related  certificates  from  2006  to  2009  that  acknowledge  his
contributions  on  various  company  projects.  He  has  received  three  patents  and  one
innovation  award.  (SOR  Answer,  Exhibit  7;  Tr.  29-31)  Applicant  considers  his
accomplishment of consistently receiving Technical Honors Awards every four years, a
total  of  three,  as  his  most  distinguished  professional  recognition.  His  personnel  file
indicates that he has received 29 awards for various accomplishments from November
2016 to January 2020. (SOR Answer; Exhibit 8)

"Applicant,  age  37,  is  unmarried  without  children.  He  attended  high  school  from
1998 through 2002 but did not earn a diploma. He has been employed as a laser tracker
operator by a defense contractor since February 2015. He was previously employed as
both a fabricator and a welder. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Item
3)
In May 2005, Applicant was pulled over for having a headlight out. During a search
of his vehicle, the police officer discovered marijuana. Applicant was then arrested and
charged with one count of misdemeanor possession of dangerous drugs. A prosecutor
later  amended  the  charge  to  one  count  of  possession  of  marijuana.  In  October  2005,
Applicant  plead  guilty  to  the  amended  charge  and  was  sentenced  to  12  months  of
probation. Applicant described the marijuana found in his vehicle as a: marijuana “roach”
(in his SCA); and as “less than 1 gram” of marijuana (in his SOR answer). (Item 2; Item 3
at 29; Item 4 at 2-3)
In December 2005, Applicant hit a patch of ice and lost control while driving his
father’s  vehicle.  A  police  officer  stopped  to  assess  whether  Applicant  needed  medical
attention.  During a  search  of  his person,  the  police  officer found  that  Applicant  was  in
possession of Vicodin. Applicant told the police officer that it was a prescribed medication,
but he did not have either the prescription itself or the bottle with him. Applicant was then
arrested. Subsequent to his arrest, the vehicle was inventoried during which the police
officer found marijuana located in a cup holder. Because he could not afford bail and no
one  would  pay  for  him  to  be  released,  Applicant  spent  the  weekend  in  jail.  While  he
claimed that the marijuana belonged to his father, and that he did not know that it was in
the vehicle, he pled guilty to possession of marijuana for which the court sentenced him
to  one  year  of  probation  and  fined  him  $600.  The  record  does  not  indicate  whether
Applicant suffered any additional consequences for being arrested while on probation for
the May 2005 incident. Applicant described the marijuana found in the vehicle as: “.1g of
marijuana”  (in  his  SCA);  a  “testable  amount”  of  marijuana  (during  his  2019  security
clearance interview); and  “a small amount” of  marijuana  (in  his SOR answer).  (Item 2;
Item 3 at 28-29; Item 5 at 2)
The SOR alleged that the December 2005 incident occurred in December 2004,
apparently  based  on  the  dates  Applicant’s  self-reported  on  his  March  2019  SCA  and
during  his  June  2019  security  clearance  interview.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant
amended  the  date  to  December  2005,  stating  “I  am  now  sure  it  was  2005.”  The
Government did not proffer any rebuttal evidence to the 2005 date. (Item 3 at 28-29; Item
5 at 2)
On July 7, 2013, a fire started in the attached garage of a home in which Applicant
resided with his mother, sister, and niece. The fire resulted from an accidental electrical
short  with  a  lawn  mower.  While  searching  his  home  for  other  fire  damage,  the  public
safety officers (PSO) investigating the fire discovered a marijuana cultivation operation.
Additional marijuana was found by police officers called to the scene to further search the
home. (AE A)
Applicant asserted that he was operating a medical marijuana cultivation operation
in accordance with applicable laws. He provided the officers with the required proof that
he was licensed to grow medical marijuana for three duly registered persons, including
himself as a qualifying patient and two others (his mother and Person A) as  qualifying
patients for whom he was their primary caregiver. However, the officers determined that
he had more marijuana plants than was allowed and that persons residing in the home
had unauthorized access to the plants. Applicant told the officers that he did not realize
that he had too many plants and also advised that “some of the plants may die so [I grow]
more.”  He acknowledged that the plants  were  accessible to everyone  who  lived  in the
home. He believed that having the doors locked to his home sufficed to secure the plants,
and claimed not to know that they needed to be in a secured location within the home.
(AE A)
The PSOs confiscated all of the marijuana in the home and told Applicant that he
would be advised about future prosecution. The seized marijuana included nine branches
of marijuana “buds,” 53 rooted marijuana plants, and 149 grams of marijuana (consisting
of one foil pan containing 88 grams, and 61 grams divided among six mason jars). The
seized marijuana was found throughout the house, including the basement, adjacent to
an upstairs futon, an upstairs drawer, the stairway to an upstairs room, and the upstairs
attic bedroom. The Department of Public Safety (DPS) deemed that Applicant forfeited
the seized marijuana because he never contacted them to claim any of it. On or about
July  12,  2013,  Applicant  was  charged  with:  1)  felony  delivery  and  manufacturing  of
marijuana;  2)  misdemeanor  maintaining  a  drug  house;  and  3)  misdemeanor  use  of
marijuana. In November 2013, he pled guilty to charge #3 for which he was fined $225.
Charges #1 and #2 were dismissed. (AE A; Item 3 at 25-26; Item 5 at 2-3; Item 4 at 3-4)
According to the incident report issued by the DPS, for three individuals, Applicant
was  allowed  a  total  of  36  plants  (12  per  individual)  and  7.5  grams  (2.5  grams  per
individual).  DPS   apparently   confused   grams and  ounces,  which  likely   accounts for the
final disposition  of  the  charges. The  applicable  state  law  allows  a  total of  212.62  grams
or 7.5  ounces for three  duly  registered  individuals (70.87  grams or 2.5  ounces for  each
individual), which Applicant did not exceed.  He  argued  that a  “major portion” of  his excess
17  “rooted  plants” consisted  of  “small  cuttings [he]  had  just  made  and  were not in  the  soil
long.” He stated: “I made  more than  I was going  to  grow into  larger plants because  some
would take  badly  to  the  soil  and  some  would die as I told  the  officers in the  reports.” He
asserted   that  he   had   no   intent  to   grow   more  than   the   allowable  amount  of   plants.   He
acknowledged  that “it was a  mistake” not to  be  more strict with  his plant count.  He has
not  cultivated  any  medicinal marijuana  since  the  July  2013  incident  and  does not  have
any plans to do so.  (AE A; Item 2;  AX  I through IV)
Applicant began smoking marijuana recreationally in the form of a cigarette, pipe,
or bong at the age of 15, when he was in high school. From age 15 to about age 18, he
smoked marijuana only on the weekends with friends in social settings. From about age
18 to age 26, he smoked marijuana approximately three to four times per week, in both
social settings and by himself. During that period, sometimes he used more than that and
sometimes less. In about 2009, at age 26, Applicant discovered that marijuana could help
with  his  chronic  back  pain.  He  was  evaluated  by  a  doctor  and  received  a  medical
marijuana  license  from  his  state  “around  2010.”  The  record  does  not  indicate  the
circumstances or frequency of his medical marijuana use or the degree to which he may
have used marijuana recreationally after receiving his marijuana license. He described
the  form  of  medical  marijuana  he  used  as: a  vaporizer  (during  his  June  2019  security
clearance interview); and “mainly edibles” (in his SOR answer). (Item 2; Item 5 at 3)
Applicant’s chronic back pain resulted from a herniated disk injury he sustained in
2004  for  which  he  was  initially  prescribed  Vicodin  as  treatment.  He  used  Vicodin  as
prescribed  until  2005,  when  he  began  abusing  it.  The  record  does  not  indicate  the
circumstances or frequency of his Vicodin use. In April 2005, Applicant voluntarily sought
and  received  treatment  for  his  abuse  of  Vicodin.  He  completed  only  the  detoxification
portion of the program. After his father passed away in April 2006, he returned for the full
program in May 2006. In December 2008, he voluntarily sought and received treatment
again  because  he  had  become  dependent  on  Vicodin.  This  time,  he  attended  an
outpatient  suboxone  maintenance  program.  Suboxone  is  the  medication  that  he  was
prescribed to treat his opioid dependency. He maintained that he never abused Subxone
and  only  used  it  as  prescribed  by  his  doctor  until  February  2019,  when  he  had
successfully weaned off of the medication pursuant to a careful plan established by his
doctor. The record contained scant details about the nature of his treatment, such as his
treatment status (e.g. whether he successfully completed the programs he attended), the
aftercare requirements, his prognoses, or whether the period of his Suboxone use was
reasonable.  In  his  SCA,  Applicant  answered  “yes”  to  the  question  of  whether  he
successfully completed his 2006 and 2008 treatment programs. (Item 2; Item 3 at 31-32;
Item 5 at 3-4)
Applicant attributed his use of medical marijuana and his abuse of and dependency
on  Vicodin  to  his  2004  back  injury.  He  stated  that  his  father’s  death  exacerbated  his
Vicodin abuse. He also used marijuana to calm him. He has not used Vicodin or any other
opioids since he entered treatment in 2008. He stopped using marijuana “around the end
of 2017.” Since then, he has managed his back pain by working out and strengthening
the muscles in his lower back, yoga-type stretching, and inversion. He also uses over-
the-counter  pain  relievers,  as  needed.  These  efforts  have  helped  him  avoid  using
marijuana or prescribed pain medications. Nowhere in the record does Applicant explicitly
state his intent regarding his future use of marijuana or Vicodin. (Item 2; Item 5 at 3)
In his SOR answer, Applicant stated:
I  know  that  I  have  made  some  mistakes  in  the  past  and  I  take  full
responsibility for them. I have learned from my mistakes and believe I am a
better  person  for  it  today.  I  no  longer  associate  with  any  of  the  people  I
called friends that were in my life during the years I was having problems. I
realized that without changing my friends I would never be able to make any
serious changes in life for the better and I believe it was the right decision.

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  Guideline  H  allegation,  with
explanations.  I  adopt  his  admission  as  a  finding  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant is 58 years old. He is married and has two children, ages 8 and 11. He
has  worked  as  a  software  developer  for  his  own  independent-contractor  business  for
approximately  24  years.  He  holds  a  bachelor  degree  in  computer  science  and
mathematics. He is seeking a security clearance for the first time.  (Tr. at 6, 27-28, 35;
GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  purchased  and  used  marijuana,  with  varying
frequency,  since  January  1977,  and  that  he  intends  to  continue  to  purchase  and  use
marijuana.  The  allegation  is  established  by  his  security  application  admissions,  his
admissions  to  a  defense  investigator  during  his  background  investigation,  and  his
admissions in his SOR answer. (GE 1, 2; SOR answer)
Applicant  described  his  marijuana  use  as  beginning  in  approximately  1977.  He
has continued his use of marijuana as recently as two days before his hearing. He uses
marijuana casually and recreationally to relax. He does not use it during work hours or
to excess. He purchases his marijuana from a legal dispensary in  his state.  Marijuana
use  does  not  violate  state  law  where  he  resides.  He  compares  his  marijuana  use  to
someone’s recreational use of alcohol. His wife is aware of his marijuana use, and she
also occasionally uses marijuana. He intends to use marijuana in the future. He clarified
that he would stop using marijuana if he received a security clearance and his employer
or client required such abstinence. Applicant pointed out the national trend on the state
level toward legalization of marijuana. He also provided an article that compared alcohol
use  versus  marijuana  use  in  terms  of  short-term  effects,  and  long-term  effects,  and
potential for misuse. (Tr. at 29, 34-37; 39, 41-42; GE 1; AE A-B)
Applicant is very  active  in  his community. He volunteers at his children’s school
and  he  serves  as  a  commissioner  on  the  local  emergency  preparedness  commission.
He is recognized by others as an excellent parent and worker. He has a reputation for
truthfulness, trustworthiness, and reliability. (Tr. 23-24, 29-30, 35; AE C)

"Applicant  is  a  26-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance.  He  is  employed  as  a  solution  analyst  for  a  company  doing  business  in  the
defense industry. He has had this job since July 2018. His formal education includes an
associate degree awarded in May 2015 and a bachelor’s degree awarded in May 2018.
He  has  never  married  and  has  no  children.  This  case  is  the  first  time  the  U.S.
Government  has  investigated  Applicant’s  background,  and  he  has  not  been  granted
national security eligibility in the past. (Exhibit 4 at Section 25)
Applicant  disclosed  a  history  of  involvement  with  marijuana  in  his  March  2019
security  clearance  application.  (Exhibit  4  at  Section  23)  He  reported  using  marijuana
occasionally, for recreation and well-being, beginning in December 2010 to March 2019.
He  further  stated  that  he  intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future,  explaining  that
marijuana  had  been  decriminalized  where  he  lives  and  he  preferred  not  to  drink
alcohol.1
In addition to his marijuana usage, Applicant disclosed a police record involving
marijuana. (Exhibit 4 at Section 22) He was arrested for felony possession of cannabis
in  2013.  He  was  not  tried  or  convicted  because  the  charge  against  him  was  nolle
prossed after he completed a diversion program.
Applicant provided some additional detail about his marijuana involvement during
his background investigation. (Exhibit 5) Of note, in a May 2019 interview, he admitted
currently using marijuana for his well-being. He also stated that he intended to switch to
medical marijuana, again for his well-being.
1  Although there is local decriminalization in Applicant’s state of residence, under state law possession of
20  grams  or  less  is  a  misdemeanor  while  possession  of  more  than  20  grams  is  a  felony.  See
www.norml.org (summary of Florida drug laws and penalties).
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.2  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”3  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.4  The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.5
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.6  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.7  An
Applicant  is  responsible  for  presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or
mitigate  facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.8  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9

8 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
9 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
[t]he   illegal  use   of  controlled   substances,  to   include   the   misuse   of
prescriptions and  non-prescription  drugs, and  the  use  of  other substances
that   cause   physical  or  mental  impairment   or  are   used  in  a   manner
inconsistent  with   their   intended   purpose,  can   raise   questions  about  an
individual’s  reliability   and   trustworthiness,  both   because   such   behavior
may   lead   to   physical  or  psychological   impairment  and   because   it  raises
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply  with laws, rules,
and regulations. . .  .
In  addition  to  the  above  matters, I  note  that the  Director of  National  Intelligence
(DNI) issued  an  October 25, 2014  memorandum  concerning  adherence  to  federal laws
prohibiting  marijuana  use. In  doing  so, the  DNI emphasized  three  things. First, no  state
can  authorize  violations of  federal law, including  violations of  the  Controlled  Substances
Act,   which  identifies  marijuana   as  a   Schedule  I  controlled   drug.  Second,  changes  to
state   laws  (and   the   laws  of  the   District  of  Columbia)  concerning   marijuana   use   do   not
alter  the   national  security   adjudicative   guidelines.   And   third,   a   person’s  disregard  of
federal  law   concerning   the   use,  sale,  or  manufacture   of   marijuana   remains  relevant
when making eligibility  decisions for sensitive national security positions.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance abuse;
AG  ¶   25(c)  illegal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  including
cultivation,  processing,  manufacture,  purchase,  sale,  or  distribution;  or
possession of drug paraphernalia;
AG ¶  25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance
misuse,  or failure  to  clearly  and  convincingly  commit  to  discontinue  such
misuse;
AG  ¶   26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment; and
AG  ¶   26(b) the  individual acknowledges  his or her drug involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including  but  not
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)
changing  or  avoiding  the  environment  where  drugs  were  used;  and  (3)
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility.
The   three   SOR  allegations  are  established.  The   record  evidence   shows   the
following: (1) Applicant  began  using  marijuana  in 2010  (at about age  15), and  was still
using  marijuana  as  of his May  2019  background  investigation; (2) he  intends  to  continue
using   marijuana   in  the   future;   and   (3)  he   was  arrested   and   charged   with   felony
possession  of  cannabis in 2013  but not tried  or convicted. The  disqualifying  conditions
noted above apply.
I  have   considered   the   totality   of   Applicant’s  involvement  with   marijuana   as
outlined   in   the   findings  of  fact.  It  includes   using   marijuana   for  about   a   decade   and   as
recently   as  about  May   2019.  The   latter  fact  means   he   smoked   marijuana   during   his
employment  with  a  federal contractor  engaged  in the  defense  industry. Any  illegal drug
use   is  relevant   in  the   context  of   evaluating   a   person’s  security   worthiness,  but  it  is
particularly   egregious  if   it  occurs   during   the   course  of   employment  with   a   federal
contractor.  Furthermore,  I  presume   his  marijuana   use  in   2019   was  in  violation   of   his
employer’s drug-free workplace  policy.10
Applicant’s case  in mitigation  is not persuasive. The  one  item  that stands out in
his favor is his candor and  willingness to  disclose  his marijuana  involvement in his 2019
security   clearance   application   and   during   his  2019   background   investigation.   But   the
credit in mitigation  is limited  due  to  his marijuana  use  after completing  his 2019  security
clearance application.
I  also  considered  the  two  mitigating  conditions  noted  above.  Neither  applies  in
Applicant’s favor. His marijuana use occurred on a regular basis over a period of years
and  is  recent  enough  to  be  of  concern.  It  also  occurred  while  his  security  clearance
application  was  pending.  The  latter  circumstance  cannot  be  overlooked,  ignored,  or
explained away. Moreover, there is a reasonable likelihood that he has continued using
marijuana to the present day, given his expressed intent to continue doing so.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent standard, I have  doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good   judgment,  and   ability   to   protect
classified   or  sensitive   information.   In   reaching   this   conclusion,  I  weighed   the   evidence
as  a   whole  and   considered   if   the   favorable  evidence   outweighed   the   unfavorable
evidence  or vice versa. I also considered  the whole-person  concept.  In  particular, I gave
weight to  Applicant’s  relative  youth  and  inexperience  in  the  ways of the  world, but  those
matters  are  outweighed   by   his  marijuana   use   while   his  security   clearance   application
was pending.  I conclude  that he  has  not met  his ultimate  burden  of persuasion  to  show
that  it  is clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  him  eligibility  for  access  to
classified information.

"The SOR alleges under Guideline I (SOR ¶ 1.a) that Applicant received mental-
health treatment from approximately May 2017 to December 2018 for  diagnosed major
depressive  disorder-single  episode,  other specified  anxiety disorders, cannabis abuse,
and  alcohol  dependence  in  remission;  under  Guideline  G  that  Applicant  consumed
alcohol at times to excess and intoxication, from age 20 to at least February 2020 (SOR
¶  2.a)  and  that  a  licensed  psychologist  determined  in  February  2020  that  Applicant’s
current  and  continued  level  of  alcohol  use  could  impact  his  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness (SOR ¶ 2.b); under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana from age
18 to at least February 2020 (SOR ¶ 3.a) and that he abused non-prescribed Ativan in
January 2017 and was fired from his job after testing positive for the drug (SOR ¶ 3.b);
and under Guideline F that, as of the issuance of the SOR on October 27, 2020, Applicant
owed  charged-off  debt  totaling  $24,444  on  four  accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  4.a-4.d);  a  $406
collection debt (SOR ¶ 4.e); a mortgage debt of $152,484 in foreclosure and $25,239 past
due (SOR ¶ 4.f); and a $25 medical collection debt (SOR ¶ 4.g).
When Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations except
for the mortgage delinquency (SOR ¶ 4.f) and possibly the medical collection debt, which
he had been unable to confirm. He indicated that the mortgage loan was refinanced in
October  2020   and   is   no   longer  in  foreclosure  proceedings.  Regarding   the   Guideline   I
concern,   he   explained   that  he   was  currently   in  mental-health   treatment.   As  for   the
Guideline   G  concerns,  Applicant  stated   that  he   tries  to   drink  responsibly   when   he
consumes alcohol,  and  that if  he  had  continued  drinking  at the  same  level as February
2020,  it  “could  have   an   impact   on   [his]  judgment   and   reliability,  but  not  concerning
classified  information.”  He acknowledged  that he  has used  cannabis from  about age  18
to   the   present,   at  a   level  and   frequency   that  has   fluctuated   over   the   years,  but  he
explained   that  he   is  now   a   medical  marijuana   patient.   Applicant  admitted   that  he   had
taken  the  Ativan  to  relax  while  being  unaware  of the  possible  consequences for his non-
prescribed  use. About  his financial issues,  Applicant explained  that   he  and  his spouse
needed  to  settle  their  mortgage  foreclosure  situation  before  resolving  other debts and  that
they  are seeking  legal advice as to  the  best course of  action  to  settle  their  debts.  He cited
several  factors  (loss  of   employment,   an   unplanned   pregnancy,   a   knee   injury,  his
underemployment, his spouse’s car  accident  and  her drug  rehabilitation)  as  causes  of his
financial difficulties.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old, married, and the father of two sons, ages six and eight.
A high school graduate, he completed Class A commercial driver training in December
2014 and took a five-week design/drafting course in 2018. He was employed full time by
a defense contractor as a mechanical draftsman learner for about 11 days from April 2018
to May 2018, when he was laid off for lack of a security clearance while his application
for security clearance eligibility was pending. He indicates that he is subject to rehire if
his clearance eligibility is adjudicated favorably. (GE 1; Tr. 25.)
Substance Use  and Psychological Issues
Applicant started drinking alcohol in high school and using cannabis shortly after
graduating  from  high  school  at  age  18.  (Tr.  37.)  He  has  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency since then, including four times a week from ages 18 to 38. (GE 3.) However,
there were also times of abstention from marijuana for as long as three or four years. (Tr.
39.) Applicant purchased marijuana for his own consumption, at times on a weekly basis.
(Tr. 39.) He has continued to use marijuana, albeit now with a medical marijuana card,
and  to  use  alcohol.  He  engaged  in heavy drinking from ages  20 to  25, although  there
have been times when he has abstained, and also times of responsible consumption. (GE
3; Tr. 47.)
In June 1993, after Applicant consumed 12 beers to intoxication while socializing
with friends, he and his friends stole some items from unlocked vehicles and garages.
Felony  burglary  and  larceny  charges  were  filed  against  Applicant  but  eventually  not
prosecuted.  After  Applicant  consumed  ten  beers  at  a  bar  in  October  1997,  he  was
involved in an altercation with two men. He paid a fine for misdemeanor assault. In July
1999, Applicant was arrested for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin).
The drug had been left in his vehicle by a friend in May 1999. Applicant admitted illegal
possession, and  in December 1999, he  was sentenced  to  six  months in jail (deferred),
one   year  of  probation,  and   a   $500   fine.   (GEs  1-2,  6.)   Applicant   refrained   from   any
marijuana  use  while  he  was on  probation  because  he  was subject  to  random  urinalysis.
A  year or two  later, he  resumed  using  marijuana  with  a  new  roommate, whom  Applicant
indicates was “a regular smoker.” (Tr. 38.)
Applicant was employed as a dealer and table games supervisor at a casino from
October 1996 to March 2001 and again from September 2001 to March 2014 when he
was terminated following a few incidents involving co-workers or patrons. In September
2015,  Applicant  began  working  as  a  commercial  truck  driver.  Applicant  refrained  from
using any marijuana for close to three years while in training for, and then working as a
truck driver. (Tr. 41-42.) He was terminated from that job in January 2017 after he failed
a random urinalysis. He tested positive for taking Ativan that his spouse gave him from
her  prescription.  He  had  been  experiencing  considerable  anxiety  related  to  some
accidents on the job, and neither he nor his spouse realized it was a banned substance.
(GEs 1, 6.) He had used the Ativan as a sleep aid approximately three times in December
2016. (Tr. 46.)
Depressed and experiencing anxiety to the point where his spouse was concerned
about his mental health, Applicant voluntarily received outpatient mental-health treatment
from  late  May  2017  to  mid-December  2018  for  diagnosed  major  depressive  disorder-
single  episode,  other  specified  anxiety  disorders,  cannabis  abuse-uncomplicated,  and
alcohol dependence, in remission. He reported on intake that he drank about six beers
per week and was “self-medicating” with marijuana four times a week. (Tr. 40.) He was
prescribed  Zoloft  and  advised  to  cease  using  marijuana  and  to  continue  sobriety  with
respect to his alcohol use. The clinical records do not expressly indicate that he was told
to cease using alcohol. However, Applicant testified that the psychiatrist told him to stop
drinking.  (Tr.  60.)  During  a  session  on  June  7,  2017,  Applicant  complained  of  anger
management  issues  and  worry  about  finances.  He  reported  medical  marijuana  use  to
treat a physical condition and occasional alcohol use. At each session, the psychiatrist
advised him to decrease and stop using marijuana, and discussed “the risks of marijuana
with mood worsening [in the] long run.” With adjustments to his Zoloft and the additions
of Trazodone and Buspar to his medication regimen, Applicant’s mental health improved.
During a session on September 18, 2017, Applicant reported that he had decreased his
marijuana use in that he had smoked the drug only once in the last month. He declined
therapy beyond an initial session because of his finances. (GEs 2-3, 6.) Applicant asserts
that  he  reduced  his  consumption  of  alcohol  “quite  a  bit”  while  in  treatment  with  the
psychiatrist because he was taking psychiatric medications. (Tr. 35.)
Applicant refrained from marijuana use while looking for work and then in training
to work for a defense contractor because he did not want it to be held against him by a
future  employer.  He  passed  a  hair  follicle  test  administered  for  employment  with  the
defense contractor. (Tr. 43-44.) On March 29, 2018, Applicant completed a Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF 86) to work for a defense contractor. He disclosed that
he  had  been  in  treatment  since  approximately  June  2017  for  “borderline  personality
disorder”  and  that  he  had  been  arrested  in  1993,  1997,  and  1999.  In  response  to  an
inquiry concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years, Applicant reported that he
had failed a random drug test after taking some of his spouse’s anti-anxiety medication
three  or  four  times  in  a  week  in  December  2016  while  struggling  with  major  anxiety
because he had recently witnessed a suicide by a man stepping out in front of a truck
ahead of him, and, on another occasion, he had locked the brakes on his truck when cut
off by another vehicle on the highway. He denied any other illegal use of a drug in the
previous seven years. (GE 1.)
On June 12, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he had received medication
management  for  “borderline  personality  disorder”  with  symptoms  of  depression  and
anxiety  for  the  past  year,  and  that  he  had  attended  one  session  of  therapy  at  the
recommendation of his psychiatrist. (GE 6.) The session occurred on June 8, 2017. (GE
2.) There is no indication that  Applicant told the OPM investigator about his marijuana
use  or  that  he  was  asked  about  any  use  of  cannabis.  Applicant  explained  to  the
investigator  that  he  elected  not  to  pursue  therapy  because  he  felt  better  on  his
medications, and it was expensive. Applicant discussed his use of his spouse’s Ativan in
December  2016,  and  his  positive  drug  screen  that  led  to  the  loss  of  his  commercial
driver’s license and employment as a truck driver. (GE 6.)
Applicant stopped seeing the psychiatrist after December 2018. He elected instead
to  have  his  psychiatric  medications  prescribed  and  monitored  by  his  primary  care
physician.  His  primary  care  physician  suggested  that  he  apply  for  the  state’s  medical
marijuana program  to  address some physical  ailments. Applicant  obtained his medical
marijuana  card  in  August  2019,  which  allows  him  to  purchase  up  to  2½  ounces  of
marijuana  per  month  from  state-authorized  dispensaries.  (Tr.  35,  40,  66-67.)  His
physician  has  to  annually  recertify  his  need  for  marijuana.  (Tr.  40.)  Applicant  is  in  his
second year of the program. (Tr. 66.)
During the course of its background investigation, the OPM obtained the records
of  Applicant’s  treatment  with  his  former  psychiatrist.  In  early  2020,  the  DCSA  CAF
referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation to a licensed psychologist because of
his history of alcohol and cannabis use and his mental-health treatment reflected in the
psychiatrist’s records. During the February 29, 2020 psychological evaluation, Applicant
reported using both tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD for medical issues under his
state’s medical marijuana program, about three times a day, as prescribed by his primary
care  physician  “as  needed  for  any  symptoms  that  may  arise.”  (Tr.  43.)  Applicant’s
judgment  and  insight  were  assessed  as  adequate,  and  he  appeared  relaxed  for  his
interview. He reported no current issues with symptoms of depression, euphoria, mood
disturbance,  or  anxiety,  but  he  indicated  that  he  had  stress  because  of  some  life
circumstances, including involving his spouse, who, after totaling his car in an accident in
August  2019,  checked  herself  into  a  rehabilitation  program.  He  reported  that  he  was
working for his uncle at the time, but had to quit to care for his sons. (GE 2.)
During the evaluation, Applicant admitted that he had consumed alcohol on a daily
basis before his spouse went into rehabilitation. His uncle kept beer at work, and he would
sometimes drink with  his uncle at the  end  of the  work day. Applicant  would then  drink at
home  with  his wife, a  half  to  a  full  pint  of liquor per night.  Following  his spouse’s return
from   her  rehabilitation   program   in   mid-November  2019,  Applicant  limited   his  alcohol
consumption   to   once  every   two   weeks,  and   generally   beer rather than  hard  liquor. He
refrained  from  drinking  in his spouse’s presence, but a  friend  would share a  six-pack with
him  when  his spouse  was out of  the  house. Applicant reported  having  consumed  three
beers  and  two  nips  of liquor with  his brother the  night  before  his  February  2020  evaluation,
but no  drinking  for 1½  weeks before that. He stated  that had  abstained  for two  or three
weeks before  his use  1½  weeks prior to his evaluation.  He explained  that  he  did  not find
it  difficult   to   maintain  that   level  of  consumption.  As  for  his  use   of  medical  marijuana,
Applicant  indicated   he   generally   smoked   or  vaped   three   times  a   day:  first  thing   in   the
morning,  after  work,  and   before  going   to   sleep   at  night.   The   psychologist  opined   that
Applicant did  not currently  meet  the  diagnostic criteria  for a  diagnosable mental-health
condition  and  that  the symptoms  that led  him  to  seek psychiatric treatment in  2017  were
sufficiently   managed   with   medication.  The   alcohol  dependence   diagnosis  of   2017
appeared   to   be  based   on   Applicant’s previous heavy  drinking   when  he  was in his 20s.
The   psychologist  nonetheless  expressed   some   concern   about  Applicant’s  recent  daily
drinking.  Although   noting   the   absence   of   any   alcohol-related   consequences   and   the
reduction  in  Applicant’s drinking  since  November  2019,  the  psychologist opined  that  “his
continued  use  of alcohol does not reflect good  judgment  in light of his history  of  alcohol
dependence, and  this could be  detrimental to  his judgment,  reliability  or trustworthiness
concerning   classified   information.”  As  for  Applicant’s  use   of   medical  marijuana,  “while
permitted  under the laws of his state, [it] is exclusionary for granting a security clearance
under federal guidelines.” (GE 2.)
In May 2020, Applicant’s brother passed away. Applicant “got into a bad habit of
drinking.” (Tr. 61-62.) After drinking heavily that summer, including up to 12 to 15 drinks
of beer and a few nips over the course of a day while on vacation, he realized that he had
to  get  his drinking under control.  (Tr.  62-63.) Applicant  began  weekly treatment with  a
licensed professional mental-health counselor in November 2020. (AE D; tr. 37.) In May
2021, the counselor opined that Applicant had not previously truly addressed his trauma
and mood-related history before now, and that his reported “co-existing issues such as
alcohol  use,  excessive  spending  of  money,  etc.  are  all  symptoms  of  this.”  She
acknowledged  the  DOD’s  concerns  “regarding  the  issues  outlined  that  could  impact
[Applicant’s]  judgment,
truthfulness  regarding  classified
information,” and  indicated  that  he  has  started  the  process,  “with  a  genuine  intent,”  to
work  on  improving  his  situation.  She  noted  that  some  of  the  DOD’s  concerns  had
improved, although she did not elaborate in that regard about which issues. She did not
provide a diagnosis but addressed his current need for time in therapy and medication
management to address his issues, including his substance-use issues. (AE D.)
impulses,  reliability,  and
As  of  his  May  2021  hearing,  Applicant’s  psychiatric  medications  were  being
monitored by a nurse practitioner. (Tr. 33-34.) Applicant testified that he has worked on
his drinking, and that he does not consume as much alcohol as he had in the past. (Tr.
31.) About his current consumption, Applicant testified:
I might have  about five  drinks a  week. My  wife  doesn’t allow  me  to  have
drinks at the  house  here very much. But every once  in awhile, I’ll  meet a
friend out and we’ll have a beer or two. Maybe a beer and a nip – fishing or
something. (Tr. 48.)
As  to   why  he   continues  to   consume   alcohol  despite   his  previous  diagnosis  of
alcohol dependence  –  in remission  and  being  advised  to  stop  drinking  by  a  psychiatrist,
Applicant responded,  “Don’t know. I’ve  always drank just casually. I’ve  never seen  it as
being  a  problem  if  I only  have  two  or three  drinks. It’s when  I get carried  away.” (Tr. 60-
61.)  Sometime  in  April 2021, Applicant  consumed  nine  or ten  beers  while  socializing  with
friends in his own  home. He admits that he  “definitely  was over the  legal limit at some
point during the day.” (Tr. 64-65.) Applicant believes that he can control his drinking. (Tr.
65.)
Applicant  continues  to  consume  cannabis  three  times  a  day  as  a  medical
marijuana card holder in his state. (Tr. 31, 42-43.) He knows that the defense contractor
has a drug policy. However, he also testified that he knows that there are people working
for  the  defense  contractor  with  their  medical  marijuana  certifications.  (Tr.  44-45.)  He
believes that “there’s a strong possibility” that he can work for the defense contractor and
still use marijuana as long as he has a medical marijuana card. (Tr. 44.) However, he also
testified that if it is not possible to use marijuana and work for a defense contractor, he
could stop using and attempt to find alternative treatment for his medical conditions. (Tr.
44.) He would like to continue his medical marijuana use. (Tr. 45.)
Finances
Applicant opened some credit card accounts early on in his marriage to establish
credit so that he and his spouse could buy a house. (Tr. 49.) He and his spouse did not
always spend wisely, and she did not return to work immediately after the birth of their
first child in March 2013 due to postpartum depression. (Tr. 49.) After losing his job at the
casino in March 2014, Applicant was unemployed until September 2015. He spent the
time caring for his then infant son, and he collected unemployment compensation during
that  time.  (GE  6.)  From  October  2014  until  December  2014,  Applicant  attended  and
completed a commercial driver training course. (GEs 1-2, 6.) For about 12 to 18 months,
he and his spouse were “treading water,” but it got to the point where they relied on credit
to pay their utility bills and purchase groceries. (Tr. 49.) His spouse spent irresponsibly,
and their financial situation “got out of control.” (Tr. 50.)
After testing  positive  for Ativan  in December 2016, Applicant lost  his commercial
driver’s  license.  He  struggled   to   find   suitable   employment,   and   was  unemployed   from
January   2017   to   May   2017.  During   that  time,  he   attended   school  for  bartending.  His
spouse  took  $20,000  from  her  retirement funds to  support  their  family. (GE 6.)  Applicant
worked  as a  traffic controller for a  security  company  from  May  2017  to  July  2017,  when
he   was  laid   off   for  lack  of   work.   In   August  2017,  Applicant  began   working   at  a   pizza
restaurant.  After only  three  or four days on  the  job, he  injured  his knee. He filed  a  worker’s
compensation claim, and he elected not to return to that job. (GEs 1, 6.) He received a
settlement of $9,500 for his injury. (GE 6.)
Applicant was unemployed from August 2017 to January 2018. He held temporary
employment  for  a  short  time  in  January  2018,  but  he  was  terminated  when  he  was
observed wearing a knee brace to work. Through his state, he enrolled in a manufacturing
pipeline  design  program  at  a  community  college  in  March  2018.  Two  weeks  into  his
training, he received a conditional offer of employment from a defense contractor, pending
his successful completion of the training, which ended on March 28, 2018. (GEs 1, 6.)
At  the  end  of  his  training,  Applicant  completed  his  March  29,  2018  SF  86.  He
reported some financial difficulties involving routine accounts: $1,500 in hospital bills in
collection;  unresolved  credit-card  delinquencies  of  $9,946  (SOR  ¶  4.a).  $2,731  (not
alleged), $3,526 (SOR ¶ 4.d), $4,690 (SOR ¶ 4.c), and $5,815 (SOR ¶ 4.b); his mortgage
that was past due for $4,016 (allegation withdrawn); and an $876 energy bill (not alleged).
Applicant explained that he fell behind on the accounts because he was injured at work
in August 2017, lost his job, and was unable to get new work. He was appealing denial of
a worker’s compensation claim. He added that he was working with his mortgage lender
to remodify his loan and arrange a payment plan to bring his loan current, and that he
was in a program with the energy company to spread out his debt so that he could bring
his account up to date. He explained that he was presently unable to make any payments
on the credit-card delinquencies. (GE 1.)
Applicant started working for the  defense contractor as a mechanical draftsman
learner  in  April  2018.  He  was  laid  off  only  weeks  later  because  of  a  lack  of  security
clearance. He understands he would return to work for the employer if his clearance is
adjudicated favorably. (GE 6.) Applicant went to work for a family member. (Tr. 50.)
As of May 2018, Applicant’s credit report showed that he owed credit-card charged
off balance of $9,945, $4,689, $6,284, and $3,536, and a medical collection debt of $25.
(GE 4.) When asked about his finances during his June 12, 2018 interview with the OPM
investigator,  Applicant  stated  that  he  had used  credit  cards  to  support himself  and his
family,  and  he  stopped  making  even  the  monthly  minimum  payments  on  some  of  the
accounts (a $1,500 hospital debt and those accounts in SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.e). He explained
that he tried to establish repayment plans with the creditors in November 2017 but none
would agree on a payment that he could afford. He volunteered that the creditor in SOR
¶ 4.a had filed for judgment in February 2018, and that he had yet to receive a court date.
Additionally, he and his spouse had consulted with a bankruptcy attorney in January 2018
to resolve their debt. They had not filed a bankruptcy petition because he did not want a
bankruptcy to negatively impact his chance of being rehired by the defense contractor.
He expressed an intention is to file after he is rehired. He added that he had rectified his
mortgage  issues  and  was  making  timely  payments  following  a  loan  modification.
Applicant  did  not  recognize  the  $25  medical  collection  debt  (SOR  ¶  4.g)  on  his  credit
record. He stated that he had taken an online credit-counseling course and attended a
mortgage crisis job training program to improve his financial situation. (GE 6.)
In October 2019, Applicant lost his job with his uncle because he had to stay at
home to care for his two young children. His spouse gave him two days notice before she
left for a rehabilitation program located out of state. Applicant was unemployed until late
January 2020, when he began working for a manufacturing machine company. (Tr. 50,
56.)  He  left  that  job  in  May  2020,  when  his  brother  died.  Applicant  was  emotionally
distraught and unable to work without compromising his and others’ safety. (Tr. 57.)  As
of May 2020, the credit bureaus were reporting no progress on Applicant resolving the
credit-card delinquencies in SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.d. Additionally, a $406 satellite television debt
was in collection (SOR ¶ 4.e), and his mortgage loan was in foreclosure. (GE 5.) Applicant
and his spouse were approved for a mortgage loan modification in October 2020, which
lowered  their  monthly  payment  from  $985  to  $886.  (GE  4.)  They  have  made  timely
mortgage  payments  since  then.  (AEs  A-C,  E.) However,  as  of  May 2021,  the  debts  in
SOR ¶¶ 4.a and 4.c-4.e were still on his credit record as unpaid. (AEs A-C.) The creditor
for the debt in SOR ¶ 4.a had offered to settle Applicant’s balance for $2,000. Applicant
has not been able to reach the creditor about the proposed settlement. (Tr. 26.) There is
no evidence of record showing that the debt in SOR ¶ 4.b has been resolved, although it
is no longer listed on his credit report.
Applicant has been unemployed for a year as of his May 2021 hearing.  (Tr. 26,
51.) He has been collecting unemployment compensation for the last year. It is currently
the minimum of $200 per week plus the $300 stimulus. (Tr. 57-58.) His spouse has been
employed as a dealer at a casino since 2006, with the exception of a brief furlough and
time  off  after the  birth  of  their  children.  (Tr. 57.)  She  works  four  days  a  week  and  her
earnings fluctuate depending on tips. She  averages about $25 to $35 per hour in tips,
and brings home about $850 per week. (Tr. 51, 59.) He and his spouse have “just under
$10,000 in [their] savings account.” (Tr. 26, 52.) Applicant has had some credit counseling
because he and his spouse are contemplating filing for bankruptcy.  He would like to gain
stable employment so he can negotiate with his creditors and bring his accounts current.
His spouse is looking into a loan from her 401(k) to address some of the debts. (Tr. 55.)

"Applicant is a 32-year-old senior consultant, employed by a government contractor
since October 2014. He previously worked for another government contractor from July
2011 to September 2014. Applicant was born in 1989 in China, and entered the United
States in 1992. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002.  He graduated from high
school in 2007 and attended university from September 2007 to May 2011, when he was
awarded  a  bachelor’s  degree.  Applicant  is  unmarried.  He  was  previously  denied  a
security clearance in 2010 by the U.S. Department of State based on drug involvement,
however  he  was  granted  a  DOD  security  clearance  and  sensitive  compartmented
information (SCI) eligibility in 2011 while working for a defense contractor. He was denied
SCI  eligibility  by  another  government  agency  in  2017 for  illegal  drug  use,  involvement
with prostitution, and falsifying a SCA.
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant purchased and used marijuana
from June 2008 to June 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and from October 2015 to December 2015
(SOR ¶ 1.b); that he attempted to grow marijuana in 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.c); used cocaine from
October 2015 to December 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.d); and  Applicant’s  2015 drug involvement
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b – 1.d) occurred after being granted a DOD security clearance in 2011 (SOR
¶ 1.e).
The SOR also alleges under Guideline E that Applicant falsified his 2011 SCA by
failing to report his purchases and use of marijuana as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, above. (SOR
¶¶ 2.a and 2.b) SOR ¶ 2.c alleges Applicant twice engaged with a prostitute in November
2015.  SOR  ¶¶  2.d,  2.e,  and  2.f  allege  Applicant’s  failure  to  disclose  his  drug  use,
purchases, attempt to grow marijuana, and use while holding a security clearance in his
May 2016 SCA. SOR ¶¶ 2.g, 2.h, and 2.i allege Applicant failed to disclose his drug use,
including while holding a clearance, his purchases, and attempts to grow marijuana on
his August 2016 SCA. Finally, SOR ¶ 2.j alleges that Applicant failed to disclose drug use,
other  than  while  in  college  in  2009  (under  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.d),  in  his  personal
subject interview with a DOD investigator on May 14, 2018. Applicant admitted all of the
SOR allegations with explanations.
Applicant admitted that he used marijuana from June 2008 to June 2010 while in
college, and from October 2015 to December 2015. He admitted to purchasing marijuana,
and using marijuana and cocaine at various times from October 2015 to December 2015,
and attempted to grow marijuana in 2015. He also admitted to twice engaging a prostitute
in Hong Kong while visiting in 2015. (Ans., Items 7, 8, and 9) Applicant stated that he first
applied for a civilian position with the U.S. Navy in 2010 and completed an SCA in May
2010, but he did not get the job. He noted in his 2010 SCA that he used and purchased
marijuana from June 2008 to May 2020, and that he used Concerta and Ritalin without a
prescription in 2008.
He again completed an SCA in February 2011. In his 2011 SCA, Applicant noted
that he was investigated in 2010 for a secret security clearance, but was denied by the
Department of State because they were “unhappy with my use of marijuana and did not
believe I have stopped for good. I have learned my lesson from this experience and regret
ever  using  marijuana.  I  have  not  smoked  for  over  half  a  year  now  and  don’t  plan  on
smoking again.” (Item 4) Despite the disclosure in his 2011 SCA about being denied a
security clearance due to drug involvement, he denied any involvement with illegal drugs
in the preceding seven years, including while holding a security clearance.
From July 2011 to September 2014, Applicant worked for a company he listed in
his 2016 SCA as a government contractor (Item 5) Applicant asserted that he first learned
in 2013 that he was previously granted a security clearance in 2011. A Joint Personnel
Adjudication System (JPAS) entry for Applicant shows that the Department of Navy CAF
granted Applicant eligibility for access to SCI in May 2011.  (Item 10) In October 2014,
Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor.  (Item  5)  In
March 2015, Applicant signed a Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement. (Item
11)
Applicant  completed   two   additional  SCAs  in   May   and   August  2016.  In   both,   he
denied   previous  involvement  with   illegal  drugs,  including   while   holding   a   security
clearance, but he  did  note  that he  was denied  a  clearance  in  2011  “due  to  experimental
marijuana  use  in college.” (Items 5, 6)  In  October 2016, Applicant was interviewed  for a
polygraph  examination  by  another government agency. During  the  pre-test interview, he
admitted  his past drug  use  and  involvement with  prostitution  as alleged  in the  SOR.  (Item
7) In January 2017, that agency  denied  him  eligibility for access  to  SCI.
On  May 14, 2018, Applicant  was  interviewed  by a  Government  investigator. He
failed at that time to fully disclose his drug use history, other than while in college. In July
2019,  Applicant  was  again  interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in  an  enhanced
subject interview. In this interview, he disclosed his use of marijuana in 2014 to 2015 in
social settings with friends. He stated that he believed at the time, that his clearance was
“not active” since he was not working on government projects that required a clearance.
He also stated that smoking marijuana was not illegal, as it is legal in the city in which he
lived at the time, and where he currently lives. He also acknowledged using cocaine two
to  three  times  from  2014  to  2015,  but  admitted  after  being  confronted,  that  he  used
cocaine three-to-four times. He also acknowledged using marijuana from 2007 to 2010,
and purchasing it from 2009 to 2010. Applicant claimed that he did not report his drug
involvement in three SCAs due to being influenced by a Navy job recruiter not to admit to
drug use because it is viewed unfavorably. He followed that advice during subsequent
security applications.
In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  noted,  “[p]lease  accept  this  letter  as  my
signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement, substance misuse, illegal
sexual behavior,  and any other personal conduct involving questionable  judgment and
dishonesty”  with  the  understanding  that  future  infractions  would  serve  as  grounds  for
revocation of his clearance. (Ans.) He stated that events in 2015 occurred while he was
in  his  20s,  and  single,  and  did  he  “did  not  have  the  slightest  clue  how  important  a
government clearance really was.” He regrets the events that occurred in 2015, including
his use of marijuana, cocaine, and procurement of prostitution, and has since married,
bought a house, and lives responsibly. When he went to the 2016 interview, he says that
he  was  already  a  “changed  man.”  He  considers  his  activities  in  2015  to  be  “isolated
events” that will not be repeated. (Ans.)

"Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  architect.  She  has  worked  since  2014  for  an
architectural  company  that  has  defense  contracts.  She  is  applying  for  a  security
clearance  for  the  first  time.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2007  and  a  master’s
degree in 2014. She has never married, and she has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 11,
16, 27-28; GE 1, 2)
Applicant smoked marijuana on an irregular basis starting in 2009 when she was
in college. She has a good memory of the eight times she used it, which includes once
in  2013;  once  in  April  2014  in  edible  form  (candy);  once  in  July  2014;  once  in  2016,
again  in  candy;  in  July  2018  in  a  tea  bag;  in  2019  in  the  form  of  a  popsicle;  and  in
August 2020. She reported minimal if any effects from the marijuana. The only time she
purchased  marijuana  was  when  she  bought  the  tea  bag  for  about  $3  at  a  marijuana
dispensary  after  she  saw  marijuana  tea  bags  discussed  in  “O,”  the  Oprah  Winfrey
magazine. The title article was “High Tea,” and the lead to the article on the cover of the
magazine  was:  “Is  marijuana  the  new  merlot?  Mellow  out.”  (Tr.  at  19,  22;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE E, F)
Applicant reported her marijuana use on the Questionnaire for National Security
Positions  (SF  86)  she  submitted  in  January  2020.  She  noted  that  her  last  use  was  in
about September 2019. She forgot about at least one time that she used marijuana, and
stated  that  she  believed  she  smoked  marijuana  three  times  and  consumed  marijuana
edibles  twice.  She  wrote:  “Marijuana  does  not  seem  [to]  affect  me.  It  only  makes  me
smell unfortunate.” (GE 1)
Applicant  fully  discussed  her  marijuana  use  when  she  was  interviewed  for  her
background investigation in April 2020. She noted that a personal amount of marijuana
is legal under the law of her state, but she understood that the federal government has
a different position. She stated that she was still curious about marijuana because of the
little effect it had on her. She was unable to state that she would not try it again. (GE 2)
Applicant  used  marijuana  again  in  August  2020.  She  reported  her  use  in
response  to  DOHA  interrogatories.  She  indicated  that  she  did  not  understand  the  full
ramifications  of  her  marijuana  use.  She  thought  the  most  important  thing  was  to  be
honest  about  her  marijuana  use,  which  she  was.  She  now  completely  realizes  that
marijuana use is against the law, not responsible conduct, and inconsistent with holding
a security clearance. (Tr. at 22-25; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE F)
Applicant credibly testified that she did not  intend to use marijuana or any other
illegal  drug  in  the  future.  She  indicated  it  was  never  something  that  she  particularly
enjoyed. She still sees friends who use marijuana, as it is prevalent in her state, but she
told her friends that she does not use marijuana, and they do not use it in her presence.
She passed a drug test in January 2021. She was evaluated by a licensed clinical social
worker (LCSW) who concluded that she did not meet the criteria for a substance abuse
disorder  or  a  mental  health  disorder.  She  provided  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to
abstain  from  all  illegal  drug  use  with  the  acknowledgment  that  any  future  involvement
with illegal drugs would be grounds for revocation of her security clearance. I found her
to be forthcoming and credible. (Tr. at 19-27; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE B, D, F)
Applicant  volunteers  in  her  community  and  is  well  respected  by  senior
management in her company. She is praised for her excellent job performance, strong
moral  character,  discretion,  self-discipline,  judgment,  trustworthiness,  leadership,
honesty, reliability, work ethic, and integrity. (AE A, C, G)

"Applicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR, except for SOR allegation ¶ 1.j.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX 1  at  page  7.)
He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  January  of  2006.  (GX  1  at

He  is  not  married,  and  has  no  children.  (TR  at  page  14  lines  7~10.)  Applicant  has  a
Master’s degree. (TR at page 14 lines 16~21.)
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
1.a., 1.b., 1.g.~1.j., and 2.c. Applicant used Marijuana “weekly” from 1995~2012,
and three times from 2012~2017. He also purchased Marijuana with varying frequency
from  1995~2012.  (TR  at  page  15  line  11  to  page  17  line  25,  and  Answer  at  page  2.)
Furthermore,  Applicant  used  and  purchased  Marijuana  after  completing  his  SCA  in
2007,  and  used  Marijuana  after  completing  his  SCA  in  2017,  while  employed  in  a
sensitive position, and after being granted a security clearance in 2008. (GX 3.)
1.c.,  1.d.,  1.g.~1.j.,  and  2.c.  Applicant  used  Psilocybin  Mushrooms  from
2002~2011. He also purchased Psilocybin Mushrooms four times. (TR at page 18 line 1
to page 19 line 20, and Answer at page 3.) Furthermore, Applicant used and purchased
Psilocybin Mushrooms after completing his SCA in 2007, while employed in a sensitive
position, and after being granted a security clearance in 2008. (GX 3.)
1.e.,  1.f.,  1.g.~1.j.,  and  2.c.  Applicant  used  Cocaine  from  2001~2011.  He  also
purchased Cocaine. (TR at page 18 line 1 to page 19 line 20, and Answer at page 3.)
Furthermore, Applicant used and purchased Cocaine after completing his SCA in 2007,
while employed in a sensitive position, and after being granted a security clearance in
2008. (GX 3.)
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
2.a. Applicant admits that he falsified his March 2007 SCA, in answer to “Section
24:  Your  Use  of  Illegal  Drugs  and  Drug  Activity,”  when  he  failed  to  disclose  his
Psilocybin  Mushroom  usage,  his  Cocaine  usage,  and  his  post-2004  Marijuana  usage.
(TR  at  page  28  lines  3~25,  and  GX  3  at  pages  36~37.)  I  find  this  to  be  a  willful
falsification.
2.b.  Applicant  admits that he  falsified  his March  2017  SCA,  in answer to  “Section
23:   Illegal  Use   of  Drugs  or  Drug   Activity,”  when   he   failed   to   disclose   his   Psilocybin
Mushroom   usage,  his Cocaine   usage,  and   his  Marijuana   usage.  (TR  at  page   34   lines

"Applicant, age 28, has never been married nor had children. She earned her high
school diploma in May 2011, and a bachelor’s degree in May 2015. She has been taking
courses part time at a university school of business since March 2018. Applicant has been
employed as a project manager by a defense contractor since June 2015. In connection
with this employment, she has maintained a DOD security clearance since August 2015.
(Item 3)
Applicant infrequently  used  marijuana  from  April 2011  through  June  2014, during
high  school and  college. She  characterized  her use  during  that period  as “experimental”
and   estimated   that  she   used   marijuana   no   more  than   10   times.  She   resumed   using
marijuana  during  a  one-month  period  between  March and  April 2017. She  attributed  her
use   during   this  second   period   to   poor  decisions  she   made   while   partying   in  her  early
twenties  and  to  her  immaturity. She  estimated  that  she  used  marijuana  only  a  “handful of
times”  when  it  was offered  to  her.  She  regrets  using  marijuana  and  has no  intent to  use  it
again.  (Item  2; Item 3  at 39-40)
Applicant  used  cocaine  one  time  in  March  2017  at  a  party,  after  a  person  with
whom she no longer associates offered it to her. She characterized her one-time use of
cocaine as a  lapse in judgment. She regrets using cocaine and has no intent to use it
again.  She  understands  that,  in  addition  to  jeopardizing  her  career,  cocaine  is  a
dangerous drug. (Item 2; Item 3 at 40-41)
Applicant acknowledged that she possessed a security clearance when she used
marijuana and cocaine in 2017, but denied that she had been granted access to classified
information because she did not have a “need to know” for any classified programs at the
time. She asserted that her 2017 drug use was infrequent and occurred during a short
time  span  when  she  anticipated  leaving  her  job  to  seek  employment  outside  of  the
defense industry and would no longer need a security clearance. Once she realized that
she enjoyed her job and intended to remain in her position, she recognized the need to
avoid using illegal drugs. She acknowledged that illegal drug use “opens [her] up to the
risk  of  being  deemed  untrustworthy  and  therefore  not  being  able  to  renew  [her]
clearance.” (Item 2; Item 3 at 40-41)
Applicant self-reported the history of her illegal drug use on her 2019 SCA and in
her  SOR  answer.  She  acknowledged  that  illegal  drug  use  is  incompatible  with  the
maintenance of a security clearance. In her subscribed and sworn SOR answer, Applicant
professed  a  sincere  commitment  to  remain  abstinent  from  marijuana  and  other  illegal
drugs.  She  no  longer associates  with  anyone  who  does  any  type  of  illegal drugs.  The
record did not indicate whether she self-reported her 2017 drug use to her supervisor or
facility security officer prior to the disclosure she made on her 2019 SCA. (Item 2; Item 3
at 39-41)
In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant  asserted  that  her  2017  illegal  drug  use  was  a
“regrettable but isolated incident and is not indicative of [her] character or [her] ability to
follow rules.” She considers herself a very responsible and career-minded person. She is
committed to her work and will not put her career in jeopardy again. She stated: “I take
pride in the work I do for my company and for the [U.S.] Government and going forward
from 2017, have only acted in ways that hold the trust put in me as sacred.” (Item 2)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  extensive  comments,  the
factual allegations pertaining to  drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR ¶¶ 1.a.
through 1.c.). Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings
of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 23-year-old employee of a defense contractor that is a management
and  information  technology  consulting  firm.  It  is  unclear  when  he  joined  his  employer,
although it had to occur after he was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office
of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  April  2020,  or  what  position  he  holds  with  his
employer, as the record is silent as to those details. He received a bachelor’s degree in
2019, and was recognized as a college all-region scholar-athlete. There is an unverified
indication that he may have received a master’s degree. He has never served with the
U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. He has never been married. He has
no children.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant was a recreational substance abuser whose primary substance of choice
was  marijuana  –  a  Schedule  I  Controlled  Substance.  He  started  casually  smoking
marijuana several times per week in November 2016, and continued such use through at
least January 2020 when he completed his SF 86. At that time, he candidly indicated an
intention to continue using marijuana in anticipation of such use becoming legalized. (Item
3, at 28-29) During his April 2020 OPM interview, he acknowledged that he continued his
use  of  marijuana  until  at  least  April  2020.  (Item  4,  at  9)  However,  in  his  March  2021
Answers to the interrogatories, and in his April 2021 Answer to the SOR, he admitted that
he was still using marijuana until at least March 2021. (Item 2, at 1; Item 4, at 5) He used
marijuana because he enjoyed the feeling of being high. He continues to associate with
friends who use marijuana illegally. He has purchased marijuana with varying frequency
until at least March 2021. (Item 4, at 10; Item 2, at 1)
Applicant’s secondary substance of choice was cocaine – a Schedule II Controlled
Substance. He started using cocaine in casual party-settings with friends in March 2017,
and continued such use on about ten occasions through at least January 2020 when he
completed his SF 86. At that time, he stated that he intended to eliminate all drug use
after college. (Item 3, at 29) However, in his March 2021 Answers to the interrogatories,
and in his April 2021 Answer to the SOR, he admitted that he was still using cocaine until
at least March 2021 – approximately two years after he graduated from college. He also
modified his previously-stated future intentions regarding cocaine by stating that he “will
stop  using  the  drug  if  need  be.”  (Item  2,  at  1;  Item  4,  at  5)  He  used  cocaine,  initially
because of peer pressure, and eventually because it caused him to have an energizing
feeling. (Item 4, at 9) He continues to associate with friends who use cocaine illegally.
On two occasions he also experimented with hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms
–  a  Schedule  I  Controlled  Substance.  He  used  the  substance  in  December  2017  and
March  2018  due  to  peer  pressure  from  two  friends  at  a  friend’s  home  in  “a  controlled
environment” – not otherwise described. (Item 3, at 29; Item 4, at 10)  During his April
2020 OPM interview, he stated that he had no future intent to use the substance because
he had “no need” to do so. (Item 4, at 10) He continues to associate with friends who use
psilocybin mushrooms illegally.
Applicant chose not to provide information of individuals who were directly involved
in his drug use, whether it applied to the marijuana, cocaine, or the psilocybin mushrooms.
(Item 4, at 9-10) There is no evidence that Applicant ever tested positive for any illegal
substance, or that he has ever received treatment and counseling as a result of his illegal
use of controlled substances. It was not until he received the FORM that he altered his
direction regarding drug involvement and substance misuse. He contends that since he
is now removed from the college environment, he intends to abstain from all illegal drug
behavior, drug involvement, and substance misuse. (AE B)

"Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana between May
2013 and at least September 2020 (SOR 1.a). It was further alleged that Applicant intends
to use marijuana in the future. In response to the SOR, he admitted with explanation the
allegation at SOR 1.a, but denied SOR 1.b, also with explanation. (FORM, Items 1 and
2)
Applicant is a single, 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was hired
for  his  current  position  in  January  2020,  and  he  requires  a  security  clearance  for  his
assigned duties. Applicant graduated from college in May 2009. Since October 2010, he
has worked in the information technology (IT) field; however, his current employment is
the first to require access to sensitive information. (FORM, Item 3)
In his January 2020 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed he had used marijuana with varying
frequency between May 2013 and December 2019. He also stated therein that he did not
intend to use marijuana in the future. On March 20, 2020, Applicant completed a personal
subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator as part of Applicant’s background
investigation. During the PSI, he discussed his use of marijuana and disclosed additional
marijuana use as recently as earlier that month. He stated that he had purchased small
amounts of marijuana for personal use, and that he has never grown or sold marijuana.
(FORM, Items 3 and 4)
In 2018, Applicant was diagnosed with epilepsy. He stated in his PSI that using
marijuana  helps  with  co-occurring  anxiety  and  helps  him  calm  down.  When  asked  to
explain why he continued to smoke marijuana after declaring in the e-QIP his intention to
abstain from further use, Applicant stated that he would stop using marijuana when and
if he received a security clearance. (FORM, Item 4)
Later in 2020, DOHA Department Counsel presented Applicant with interrogatories
seeking,  in  relevant  part,  to  update  information  about  Applicant’s  use  of  marijuana.  In
response  to the interrogatories, Applicant disclosed that, after his March  2020 PSI, he
continued to use marijuana through at least September 2020. (FORM, Item 4)
In response to the SOR, Applicant disclosed that he suffered from epilepsy and
anxiety. For those conditions, in November 2020, he applied for authorization in his state
to  use  marijuana  for  medicinal  purposes.  His  request  was  endorsed  by  a  neurologist.
(FORM, Item 2)
Sua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I
controlled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal
law.  Guidance  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  (OASD)  in
February  2013  makes  clear  that  changes  in  the  laws  pertaining  to  marijuana  by  the
various states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the  current National
Security  Adjudicative  Guidelines.  Because  federal  law  supersedes  state  laws  on  this

"Applicant is 37 years old and married. He and his wife have a 10-year-old son and
a 4-year-old daughter. He received a Bachelor of Art degree in psychology in 2008 and
an Associate degree in computer-aided drafting technology in 2018. Applicant has worked
for a defense contractor as a drafting and design associate since May 2019. This is his
first security clearance application. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 9-11, 15-16)
Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  first  used  marijuana  in  2004,
during  the  summer  after  his  first  year  of  college,  and  last  used  marijuana  a  few  days
before the hearing. He admitted in his answer to the SOR that he intended to continue to
recreationally use marijuana. At the hearing, he confirmed that he intends to continue to
use marijuana. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 16-17, 24-25, 27-28, 32-33)
In his June 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana from June 2012
to March 2019. He indicated that he intended to stop using marijuana as he did not “want
to set a bad example for [his] children.” (GE 1; Tr. 25)
In his adopted August 2019 security clearance interview, Applicant admitted that
he smoked marijuana almost daily while he was in college. His use gradually decreased
as  he  aged.  At  the  time  of  the  interview,  his  most  recent  marijuana  purchase  was  in
February 2019, and his most recent use was two weeks before the interview. At that time,
he still possessed marijuana at home and intended to use it. (GE 2; Tr. 25)
Applicant  used  marijuana  a  few  days  before  the  hearing.  He  regularly  uses
marijuana  two  to  three  days  a  week  alone  at  home.  Most  of  his  social  circle  uses
marijuana. Occasionally, he uses marijuana with his friends; most recently, while playing
golf in May 2021. He typically purchases marijuana one to two times a year; most recently
in October 2020. As of the day of the hearing, he possessed approximately one eighth of
an ounce of marijuana at his home, which he intended to use. He intends to continue to
use marijuana regularly. (Tr. 16-18, 23-24, 27-32)
In  his answer to  the  SOR and  at the  hearing, Applicant characterized  his marijuana
use  as responsible  and  the  laws regarding  marijuana  as antiquated. He resides in a  state
in  which   recreational  use   continues  to   be   illegal,  but   medical  marijuana   use   is  legal.
Applicant did not proffer that his use  of  marijuana  was for medicinal purposes,  nor has he
ever possessed  a  medical marijuana  prescription. (Answer; Tr. 16-18, 23-24, 27-31, 33-
34)
Applicant  described  his  17-year  history  of  recreational  marijuana  use,  and  he
rationalized his continued use of marijuana as follows:
I’ve   stopped   numerous  times   throughout   my   youth   for  months  here  and
there, for various reasons. But at  that point I had  stopped  for the  drug-test
for the  hiring  at [current employer].  . . . .  I’ve  always gone  back  and  forth
about using  it or not,  mostly  because  my  wife…doesn’t love  it either. So  at
the  time  during  that,  the  initial interrogatories, eQIP  questionnaire, I strongly
considered  stopping  entirely  for that and  for the  security  clearance  and  most
other things. Like I  said, I  find  that I’m  not as  angry  of a  person, and  like  I
said, I’m just a better person and  a better father when I do use it.   (Tr.  26)
Applicant’s  current  employer  required  him  to  take  a  pre-employment  drug  test,
which he passed. According to its company policy, the employer is supposed to conduct
random  drug  testing  of  its  employees.  However,  Applicant  has  learned  from  other
employees that the company does not, in fact, conduct random drug screening or testing
other  than  during  the  pre-employment  phase.  Applicant  knows  that  it  is  against  his
employer’s  company  policy  to  use  drugs,  including  marijuana,  and  is  aware  that  his
marijuana use could adversely affect his employment and ability to obtain and maintain a
security clearance. Applicant has not disclosed his drug involvement to his security officer
or anyone  else at his current  employer, because he is  aware  his marijuana use  is not
permitted. (GE 1; Tr. 17-20, 31-32)
Two  of  Applicant’s prior  employers also had  drug-free  workplace  policies,  and  at
least  one   of   these   employers  required   him   to   take   a   pre-employment  drug-screening
urinalysis.  He  admitted   that  he   used   marijuana   while   working   for  both   of   these   prior
employers.  According   to   Applicant,   if   his  employers  had   regularly   drug   tested   him,  he
would  have   stopped   using   marijuana.  However,  despite   the   criminality   of  recreational
marijuana  use  in his state  and  at the  federal level and  his employer’s company  policies,
he  feels that  “the  benefits” he  gets  “from [using  marijuana]  are quite  beneficial.”  (Tr. 20-
24)
Applicant’s friends  and  family  members  find  him  to  be  dependable,  trustworthy,
reliable, organized, efficient, and honest. In his written closing statement, he asserted that
he a responsible, trustworthy, and hardworking individual. He currently uses marijuana to
reduce stress rather than to party. He values his job and the value it adds to protecting
the United States. (AE A; AE B)

Guideline  H –  Drug Involvement
1.a.  through  1.c.  Applicant  admits  from  about  1982  until  1984,  while  “between
college  and  graduate  school,” he  used  marijuana  about  ten  times.  (TR  at  page  16  line
20 to page 17 line 4, and at page 37 lines 20~25.)  In 1990, while attending a “bachelor
party,” he also used marijuana. (TR at page 38 lines 1~7.) Applicant disclosed this more
recent, one time usage on his January 2012 e-QIP. (GX 2 at page 3.)
When the use of marijuana was legalized in  his home state in January of 2018;
and while granted access to classified information,  Applicant used marijuana about 70
times from about January of 2018 to July of 2019. (TR at page 30 line 12 to page 32 line
17.) He first disclosed this usage on his June 2018 e-QIP with the following “Explanation
- Pot is legal in . . . [my home state] now.” (TR at page 30 line 12 to page 32 line 17, and
GX  1  at  page  33.)  It  was  during  a  subsequent,  July  2019,  subject  interview  that
Applicant  was  told  he  “was  dead  wrong”  about  his  assumption  as  to  the  use  of
marijuana.  (TR  at  page  18  line  22  to  page  19  line  16,  and  39  lines  5~16.)  He  then
immediately  ceased  his  use  of  marijuana.  Applicant’s  last  use  of  marijuana  was  more
than  two  years  ago.  Applicant  also  purchased  marijuana  four  times  from  legal
dispensaries  during  the  2018~2019  time  frame:  three  times  for  his  personal  use,  and
once for his elderly father to treat his father’s chronic pain. (TR at page 18 lines 2~18, at

Applicant  submitted  the  results  of  recent  drug  tests  (AppXs  A  and  J),  and
submitted a Statement of intent against future illegal drug usage (AppX B). He received

"In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  the  Guideline  H  allegations,  but  denied  the
Guideline E allegations. I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  32  years  old.  He  is  single,  never  married,  and  has  no  children.  He
holds  a  master’s  degree.  Applicant  started  working  for  his  current  federal  contractor-
employer  in  November  2019  as  an  engineer.  He  previously  worked  for  a  federal
contractor from April 2011 to August 2018. Between August 2018 and November 2019,
he  worked for a non-federal contractor.  He was  granted  a secret security clearance in
2011 and 2016. (Items 3, 7)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
approximately 2010 until May 2020; that he used marijuana with varying frequency from
approximately  June  2011  until  May  2020,  after  he  was  granted  access  to  classified
information; and that he used Ecstasy once in April 2020, after he was granted access to
classified  information. The  SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified  his answers when
completing his security clearance applications (SCA) in April 2011 and March 2016, when
he failed to disclose his marijuana use within the last seven years on those SCAs.
Applicant acknowledged that he used all the illegal substances alleged in the SOR
and at times when he held a security clearance. He denied deliberately making any false
statements when completing his 2011 and 2016 SCAs. (Items 2, 4 (section II, Drug Use,
question 1))
Applicant first used marijuana in 2010. He claims this use was in a country where
it was legal at the time of his use. Between 2018 and 2020 he used marijuana by smoking
it using a vape pen and eating edibles approximately 25 times. His last use of marijuana
was in May 2020. His use was with his roommate, who also provided the marijuana. He
claims  these  uses  were  all  in  states  that  legalized  marijuana  under  state  law.  He
acknowledged knowing marijuana use is illegal under federal law. He used Ecstasy one
time in April 2020. He used Ecstasy with his roommate and three other acquaintances.
He ingested it by drinking it in a powder form. He stated that he does not intend to use
either marijuana or Ecstasy in the future. He did not provide any information on whether
he still has contacts with the roommate and acquaintances he described above. He first
held a security clearance in 2011 and more recently has held a clearance since 2016.
(Items 2, 4, 7)
Applicant completed a SCA in April 2011. In response to a question asking about
his  illegal  drug  use  in  the  past  seven  years,  he  answered  in  the  negative.  Applicant
asserts that his only marijuana use at that point in time was in 2010 while he was visiting
a foreign country where such use was legal. He believes his answer to this SCA question
was not false because he did not engage in “illegal” drug usage, since it was legal under
the laws of the country where he used it. (Items 2, 6)
Applicant  completed  a  second  SCA  in  March  2016.  In  response  to  a  question
asking about his illegal drug use in the past seven years, he answered in the negative.
Applicant never really asserted a  reason  why  he  answered  “no” to  this question, other
than explaining his use in a foreign country in 2010 and asserting that the question was
confusing to him. He also pointed out that in his most recent SCA (July 2020) he listed all
of his illegal drug usage. (Items 2, 3, 5)

Applicant is 33 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since graduating
from college in May 2010. He was granted a security clearance in September 2010 and
is now seeking to renew his clearance.  In 2015, he  earned  a  master’s degree,  and  he
married in 2016. The couple have one child. (FORM Item 4.)
In  his  SCA,  Applicant  advised  that  after  being  granted  eligibility  for  a  security
clearance, he used marijuana about five times during the period July 2011 to June 2019.
In his September 2020 background interview, he repeated this information, including the
June 2019  date  of  his last  use  of  marijuana,  and  the  investigator reported  it  in  his/her
Report of Investigation. For a third time, he repeated in his February 18, 2021 Answer the
same dates of his use of marijuana. In his Response to Department Counsel’s FORM,
Applicant wrote that he misspoke during his background interview and that his last use of
marijuana was June 2018, one year earlier. He also corrected the spelling of the name of
a town appearing in the Investigator’s report in which he once used marijuana. (FORM
Item 1 at 5; FORM Item 2 at 45; FORM Item 3 at 1; Response.)
The   details  of  Applicant’s  admitted   use   of  marijuana   are   that  he   and   his  wife
traveled  to  two  states in  which marijuana  could be  legally  purchased  under  the  laws of
those states and used marijuana a total of four times. He used marijuana a fifth time in
his home state where marijuana is not legal under state law. On that occasion, he smoked
marijuana purchased illegally by a friend while they played golf with two other friends. He
admitted in his background interview that when he smoked marijuana, he was aware that
he was not permitted to do so as a security clearance holder.  He was also aware that
marijuana  was  not  legal  under  Federal  law.  He  wrote  that  recognized  now  that  he
exercised  poor  judgment  in  using  marijuana  after  having  been  granted  a  security
clearance. He reported his misconduct on his SCA and to the Government investigator in
an effort to be transparent and to demonstrate that he was honest and trustworthy. He
wrote in his Answer that he promised never to use marijuana in the future and that since
his  last  use,  he  has  matured  and  is  now a  father of  a  young  child.  He  recognizes  the
responsibilities that having a serious job as a  government contractor entails as well as
the responsibilities he has to his family. (FORM Item 3 at 2; Answer at 5; Response.)

under  state  law.  His  wife  had  success  with  medical  marijuana  in  treating  her  illness.
Applicant researched marijuana for medicinal purposes. He knew that while legal under
state  law,  it  was  a  controlled  substance  and  illegal  under  federal  law.  On  his  doctor’s
recommendation,  he  used  marijuana  in  the  form  of  edibles,  rubs,  and  vapes  for  his
insomnia  and  pain  management.  (Tr.  at  53-56,  64-65,  73,  80-81,  85-87;  Applicant’s

In  2018,  Applicant  moved  to  a  state  that  permitted  marijuana  use  for  medicinal
purposes. He used the marijuana rubs, but he did not take any edibles after he moved
in  2018,  and  he  did  not  use  marijuana  in  vape  form  until  he  received  a  card  from  the
state’s  cannabis  commission.  The  state  made  recreational  marijuana  use  legal  under
state law. It was no longer necessary for Applicant to have a medical marijuana card as
anyone  could  purchase  and  use  it  under  state  law.  (Tr.  at  56,  66,  82-84,  88-89;

received  the  SOR  and  discussed  it  with  his  attorney.  He  was  previously  incorrectly
advised  that  as  long  as  he  was  completely  honest,  that  his  marijuana  use  would  not
preclude him from holding a security clearance.  The last time he purchased marijuana
was in December 2020, and the last time he used marijuana was in January 2021. He
now completely realizes that marijuana use is against the law, not responsible conduct,
and inconsistent with holding a security clearance. (Tr. at 22-25, 67, 75-77, 80, 92-98;

Applicant was not a recreational drug user. He credibly testified that he does not
intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. He honestly admitted that
if  marijuana  is  legalized  federally,  he  would  consider  using  it  again  for  its  medicinal
properties.  His  wife  also  used  marijuana  for medicinal  purposes.  She  does  not  hold  a
security clearance, but she stopped using marijuana to support her husband. They have
both  pursued  treatments  for  their  ailments  that  do  not  involve  marijuana.  Applicant
passed  a  drug  test  in  August  2021.  He  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed  clinical  social

Applicant  is  52  years  old  and  has  worked  for  U.S.  defense  contractors  as  an
engineer since 2008. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1987 and served until 1997, when

SOR  Allegation
Paragraph 1, Guideline H - The SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana “with
varying frequencies” during the period September 2016 to at least May 2020, including
after  being  granted  access  to  classified  information  in  July  2018.  In  his  Answer,  he
admitted the allegation and provided some mitigating facts and circumstances, which he
repeated at the hearing.
Applicant was granted his first security clearance in 1991 when he was in the Navy.
He  has  held  a  clearance  continuously  since  February  2008  while  working  for  U.S.
Government contractors. His eligibility was last renewed in 2017, based upon a security
clearance application he submitted in April 2017 (2017 SCA). In his 2017 SCA, he
disclosed  that  he  smoked  marijuana  between  September  2016  and  January  2017.  In
response  to  a  question  about  his  frequency  of  use,  he  wrote  “smoked  Marijuana  @  a
party with friends.” He responded in the negative to a question about his future intentions
to  use  this  drug  in  the  future,  and  he  wrote:  “It  does  nothing  for  me.  I  actually  get  a
headache  the  next  morning  from  use  .  .  .  ha  ha  I  like  Beer  better  .  .  .”  (Ellipsis  and
capitalization in the original.) (Tr. at 31; GE 4 at 32-33; AE G.)
In his 2020 SCA, he disclosed more recent uses of marijuana on the application in
addition  to  the  2016-2017  uses.  He  disclosed  that  he  used marijuana  two  times  over  a
one-week period in May 2020. He provided the following additional comments:
During COVID-19 isolation, I Smoked some Marijuana to experiment during
a  depression  time  2  months  into  quarantine.  It  really  did  not  help  so  I
stopped.  (Capitalization in the original.)
In  response  to  the  question  about  his  future  intentions  with  respect  to  using  this  drug,
Applicant again checked the box indicating he had no future intent to use marijuana, and
he  wrote:  “I  did  not  get  the  relief,  am  no  longer  depressed  and  for  my  current  job
clearance.” (GE 1 at 34-35.)
Applicant  has  been  interviewed  two  times  regarding  his  marijuana  use  in
connection with his two most recent security clearance applications, first in January 2018
and  then  in  July  2020.  As  of  January  2018,  Applicant  admitted  using  marijuana
approximately three times between September 2016 and January 2017. He explained to
the investigator that he first used marijuana in 2016 by himself in his father’s back yard
while  he  was  caring  for  his  father  who  was  ill.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  no
intention to use marijuana again because he did not enjoy the drug and he had too much
to lose working as a contractor for the U.S. Government. (GE 2 at 1. 4-5; GE 3 at 1, 4-5.)
In his July 2020 interview, he told the investigator that he used marijuana again in
May 2020 during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic when state law required him
to shelter in place. He diagnosed himself as feeling depressed. He bought the marijuana
and  a  CBD  chocolate  edible  from  a  marijuana  dispensary  that  legally  sold  marijuana
products under the law of his state. He ate the edible at home alone. He also discussed
with the investigator his prior use of marijuana starting in September 2016, when he was
taking  care  of  his  terminally ill  father.  He  also  mentioned  his  use  at  a  New  Year’s  Eve
party. (GE 3 at 1, 4-5.)
Applicant testified that his past use of marijuana was during periods of stress when
he was feeling depressed by his life’s circumstances, which included the loss of his long-
term marriage and the deaths of his mother in early 2016 and then his father in later 2016.
He  also lost  his brother,  who  was  homeless and  died  in  an  accident,  leaving  Applicant
with only one family member, his sister. (Tr. at 18-21, 27.)
In  anticipation  of  a  future  hearing  regarding  his  clearance  eligibility,  Applicant
sought drug counseling at the request of his attorney. He testified that he learned from
this one-time counseling experience in March 2021 that there was a relationship between
his  drug  use  and  his  psychological  state.  This  is  a  connection  he  already  understood,
however. He wrote in his June 2020 SCA that his use of marijuana two times in March
2020 was due to feeling depressed. He no longer believes that he is suffering from any
psychological issues. (Tr. at 18-21; GE 1 at 34-35; AE C.)
Applicant’s testimony about the number of times he has used marijuana or another
THC  product  was  inconsistent.  He  testified  on  direct  examination  that  he  only  used
marijuana on three occasions. The first time was in March 2016, and the most recent time
was March 2020. On cross-examination, it became apparent that he had used marijuana
on  more  than  three  occasions.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  used  marijuana  on  two
occasions in September 2016. Also, Department Counsel pointed out that in Applicant’s
2018  background  interview,  he  admitted  using  marijuana  on  three  occasions  between
September 2016 and January 2017, the third time being at a New Year’s Eve party with
friends. He then testified that he used marijuana once again in March 2020. He had written
in his 2020 SCA that he last used marijuana twice in May 2020. At the hearing, he clarified
that the number of uses in 2020 was indeed twice. In 2020, he made a marijuana joint
using rolling paper he obtained from a neighbor. He lives in a condominium where it is
common  for  his  neighbors  to  smoke  marijuana.  He  partially  smoked  the  marijuana  by
himself on a couple of occasions. He also testified that he consumed the chocolate CBD
edible. (Tr. at 27-28, 41-52, 59-62, 64-66; GE 2 at 4-5; GE 3 at 4-5.)
Applicant had some confusion about the date of the New Year’s Eve party incident.
He attempted to change the date of his sole use of marijuana with friends from New Year’s
Eve  December  31,  2016,  to  December  31,  2017.  That  testimony,  however,  was
inconsistent with his disclosure in his April 2017 SCA, in which he dated the New Year’s
Eve party as occurring about three months earlier, i.e., on December 31, 2016-January
1, 2017. It could not have occurred one year later because that would have been after he
disclosed  marijuana  use  over  New  Year’s  Eve  2016-2017  on  his  April  2017  SCA,  a
document he prepared only months later. In his attorney’s Post-Hearing Arguments, the
attorney clarified that upon reflection after the hearing, Applicant realized that he had used
marijuana  at  New  Year’s  Eve  parties  in  both  years.  (Tr.  at 27-28,  41- 45;  GE  3  at  4-5;
Hearing Exhibit II.)
Applicant testified that he has no future intent to use marijuana. He also provided
a written statement confirming that intention and consenting to the automatic revocation
of his clearance in the event of a violation of his statement. Applicant also testified that
he no longer associates with the individuals he had used marijuana with in the past. As
noted, he has twice represented in his clearance applications that he has no intention of
using marijuana again. Also, he advised the investigator in 2018 of this same intention,
only to smoke marijuana twice in May 2020 and to eat a CBD edible the same week. (Tr.
at 29, 52-55; GE 1 at 34-45; GE 3 at 32; GE 4 at 32; AE A.)
Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant  presented  a  significant  amount  of  character  evidence,  starting  with  his
military  career,  as  discussed  above.  He  also  provided  evidence  of  his  volunteer  work,
which  was  impressive.  Two  co-workers  provided  reference  letters.  Both  were  aware  of
the SOR allegation. They praise Applicant’s knowledge, dedication, skills, and work ethic.
They believe him to be reliable and trustworthy. (Tr. at 24-65; AE E; AE  F.)
",False
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the single allegation that he used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  August  2004  to  November  2019.  His
admission is incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  composite  material  worker  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since November 2018. He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant graduated from high school in February 2006. He attended some college
courses in 2018 but did not receive a degree. He has never married and has no children.
When Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he used marijuana two or
three times a week from about August 2004 to November 2019. He stated that he did not
intend to use marijuana in the future because he had “no desire.” (FORM Item 3 at 32.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2020, he told
the investigator that he first used marijuana from January to April 2014 but stopped while
he was on probation for vandalism from April 2004 to August 2006. He disclosed that he
resumed his marijuana use in August 2006, with his use varying from very infrequent with
multiple  month  breaks  to  two  or  three  times  a  week.  He  occasionally  purchased
marijuana, but he usually obtained it from friends and social acquaintances. (FORM Item
4 at 4.) In his response to the FORM, he stated, “I have never used any substances while
at work on [the contractor’s] property.”
",False
"Applicant,  through  counsel,  admitted  in  part  and  denied  in  part  the  three  SOR
allegations with explanations. (SOR Answer) His partial admissions are incorporated or
adopted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Background Information
Applicant  is   a   39-year-old  senior  principal   engineer  -  electrical   employed   by   a
defense   contractor  since   March  2020.  (SOR  Answer  (Ex.  1);  GE   1;  Tr.   14-15,  38)  He
seeks a  security  clearance  to  enhance  his position  within his company.  (GE 1; Tr. 15-
16,  38-39)   Applicant   was  previously   employed   by   his  current   employer  and   held  a
clearance   from   2007   to   2013.  (SOR  Answer  (Ex.  1);  GE   2   -  June   10,  2020   Office   of
Personnel Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI);  Tr. 17)
Applicant  received   his   high   school  diploma   in  June   2000.  He   was  awarded   a
Bachelor  of   Science   degree   in  mechanical   engineering   with   a   minor  in  electrical
engineering   in   June   2004,  and   graduated   magna   cum   laude   with   a   3.84   grade   point
average.  (SOR Answer (Ex. 1); GE  1; Tr. 16, 37-38)  Applicant  married  in March  2016,
and  has no children.  (GE 1; Tr.  16-17)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant self-reported  drug  use  on  his  April 22,  2020  SF-86  when  reapplying  for
a   security   clearance   for  reemployment  with   his  current  defense   contractor.  (GE   1;   36-
37)  He  was  subsequently   interviewed   on   June   10,  2020   by   an   OPM   investigator
regarding   his  drug   use.  None   of   his  drug   use   occurred   while   holding   a   security
clearance   or  occurred   anticipating   renewal  of   a   security   clearance.  (GE   2)  He
elaborated  on  his drug  use  in  his  January  11, 2021  SOR Answer as well  as during  his
testimony. The  following  summarizes that drug use.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleged  that  from  approximately  September  2015  to  October  2019,
Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency.  In  his  SOR  Answer,  Applicant
admitted  to  using  marijuana  five  times  in  the  past  seven  years  and  disputed  the
characterization  of  “varying  frequency.”  He  noted that  over the  past  several years, the
legal  restrictions  on  recreational  use  of  marijuana  have  eased  significantly,  with
numerous  states  decriminalizing  marijuana  entirely.  (SOR  Answer)  During  his
testimony,  Applicant  confirmed  the  number of  times  he  used  marijuana  as  admitted  in
his SOR Answer adding that his marijuana use occurred in 2015 and from 2016 to 2019
at music/art festivals. (Tr. 39-40, 45--55)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleged  that  from  approximately  September  2015  to  October  2019,
Applicant used LSD with varying frequency. In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted to
using  LSD  two  times,  once  in  September  2015  and  once  in  October  2019.  Applicant
wanted  to  clarify  that  these  two  uses  did  not  constitute  “continued  use  and/or  abuse”
and were experimental, while attending music/art festivals. (SOR Answer; Tr. 45) During
his testimony, Applicant confirmed the number of times he used LSD as admitted in his
SOR Answer. (Tr. 39-40, 45-55)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleged  that  in  approximately  October  2019,  Applicant  used  MDMA
(“ecstasy”).  In  his  SOR  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  to  using  MDMA  once  in  October
2019  at  a  music/art  festival.  (SOR  Answer)  During  his  testimony,  Applicant  confirmed
the number of times he used MDMA in his SOR Answer. (Tr. 39-40, 45-55)
Applicant explained his use of drugs during this timeframe was “a spiritual event,
it  was  opening  my  mind  to  different  experiences,  different  viewpoints,  it  was  a  way  of
connecting  with  others  there,  it  was  a  different  way  to  experience  the  music  and  art.”
(Tr. 40, 52-53) He was not working for a defense contractor nor did he have a security
clearance at any time that he used these drugs. Applicant understands that use of drugs
when  he did not  have  a  security clearance was  illegal,  but  “it felt like  a  low risk  at the
time.  I  realize  now  it  was  a  mistake.  .  .”  This  experience  has  impressed  on  Applicant
that  drug  use  is  not  acceptable  and  that  youthful  experimentation  is  viewed  quite
differently as an adult. (Tr. 40, 48-49, 57-58)
Applicant credibly stated that he disclosed all of his drug use on his SF-86. (Tr.
42-43) He understands that any form of drug use is not permitted under federal law and
as  such,  he  will  comply  with  the  law.  (Tr.  55-56)  Applicant’s  wife  is  aware  of  his  past
drug use and fully supports him maintaining sobriety. (Tr. 61)
Applicant noted that the process to obtain a clearance has definitely affected his
motivation  regarding  any  future  drug  use.  He  stated,  “I  will  not  be  using  drugs  in  the
future.”  (Tr.  43)  Applicant’s  motivation  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  is,  “I  do  love  the
job. I like working with [described project]  very much, and it would enable me to better
help  my  company  and  the  customer,  the  Navy  or  the  Government.”  (Tr.  44)  He
requested the hearing because, “I want to convince the Judge and the Government that
I am trustworthy and can safely hold a security clearance.” (Tr. 44)
Applicant  described  time  spent  with  individuals  that  he  used  drugs  with  in  the
past as varying and dependent on the individual. Some individuals he sees annually or
less,  and  some  individuals he  sees on a more frequent basis,  but  does not use  drugs
with  them.  These  individuals  understand  and  respect  the  fact  that  Applicant’s  current
employment does not allow him to use drugs.  Applicant regrets his prior drug use and
acknowledged that using drugs in his profession was “not smart.” (Tr. 55, 58-60)
Applicant submitted two negative drug tests dated February 9, 2021, and March
29, 2021. (Ex. 3) Post-hearing, Applicant submitted a signed, sworn statement of intent,
dated  June  23,  2021,  to  avoid  any  future  drug  use  or  other  illegal  use  of  drugs  both
presently and in the future,  with the understanding that any drug violation will result in
the  automatic  revocation  of  clearance.  He  added  that  it  is  his  intention  to  abstain
completely  from  all  intoxicating  substance  abuse,  including,  but  not  limited  to
disassociation from events and people that promote the usage of illegal intoxicants and
avoidance of drug-using associates and/or contacts. (AE 7)
Character Evidence
Applicant called two character witnesses  to testify on  his behalf:
that  Applicant  was  cognizant  of  balancing
Co-worker  (CW-1)  and   mechanical  engineer.   CW-1   has   known   Applicant  since
2008   when   he   hired   on   as  a   new   employee   with   their   present  employer.  CW-1
described  Applicant  as  a  “very  approachable,  technically  capable  individual.” He further
stated
interests  of
management  and  the  customer making  “the  correct decision  for both  the  customer and
the   company’s  sake.”   CW-1   reached   out  to   Applicant  to   return   to   their   company
because  of his expertise  in key  areas. CW-1  never observed  Applicant drink to  excess
or  use   drugs.  CW-1   is   aware  of  Applicant’s  admitted   drug   use   and   the   Government’s
concerns.   Based   on   observing   Applicant  on   a   personal  and   professional  basis,  CW-1
stated   that  Applicant  is  a   person   of   “very  good   character”   who   could  be   trusted   to
safeguard  classified  information.  CW-1  also  submitted  a  reference  letter on  Applicant’s
behalf. (AE  6; Tr. 17-27)
the   competing
Co-worker  (CW-2)  and   mechanical  engineer.   CW-2   has   known   Applicant  since
the   “mid  2000s  when   he   joined   the   group   and   we   worked   on   production   equipment
together.”  CW-2  described  Applicant as a  “very  bright individual . . .  willing  to  wade  into
complex  situations and  sort them  out . .  . .” Applicant was well  liked  and  trusted  by  his
peers and   management.   CW-2   added   that   Applicant  was  good-natured,  punctual,  and
handled   stress  very   well.  CW-2   is  aware  of   Applicant’s  admitted   drug   use   and   the
Government’s concerns. CW-2  never observed  Applicant  drink to  excess. CW-2  stated
Applicant  is  a   valued   and   trusted   employee   and   does   not  pose   a   security   risk.  CW-2
also submitted  a reference letter on Applicant’s behalf. (AE 5; Tr. 28-35)
Applicant submitted four reference letters at his hearing: (1) Self-employed piano
instructor and professional musician (PI); (2) Applicant’s wife  (W); (3) CW-1 (testified at
his hearing; and (4) CW-2 (testified at his hearing).
PI  has  known  Applicant  since  1994  when  they  met  in  junior  high  school.  PI
described  Applicant  as  being  “without  question  one  of  the  most  trustworthy  people  I
have ever known.” W  is a veterinary surgeon, has known Applicant since 2003, began
dating him in 2010, and married him in 2016. She stated, “I am lucky to be [Applicant’s]
wife.” W discussed Applicant’s decision to self-report his drug use realizing that adverse
consequences could follow. She noted that Applicant is “most certainly aware now that
these were poor decisions.” As a veterinarian, she noted that any drug use on her part
would jeopardize  her license and  career. W is fully  supportive  of  Applicant maintaining  a
life   of   sobriety.  She   described   Applicant  as  “one   of  the   most  honest,   trustworthy,  and
empathetic people I have  ever  known. Our relationship has been  an  immense  source of
strength   and   support  for  me.  While   I  may   hold  some   bias,  I   also   feel  that  I  know
[Applicant]  the  best of anyone  and  can  attest to  his character.”  CW-1  and  CW-2’s letters
were consistent with their testimony. (AE 4, AE  5, AE  6)
Applicant  submitted  several  performance  evaluations  from  his  previous  and
current employers. They document a 16-year history in which Applicant has excelled in
his professional capacity and his contributions to the national defense. He is technically
competent,  well  liked,  trusted,  and  respected  by  his  peers  and  management.  (SOR
Answer; AE. 2, AE 3)
",True
"In  Applicant’s SOR response, she  admitted  the  SOR allegations  in ¶¶  1.a, 1.b, and
2.a.  (HE  3) She  denied  the  allegation  in SOR ¶  2.b. She  also provided  extenuating  and
mitigating information. Her  admissions  are accepted as  findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old program manager, who has been working for a defense
contractor since April 2018. (Tr. 7-8; GE 1) In 2009, she graduated from high school, and
in 2013, she was awarded a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from an Ivy League
university, where she had a full scholarship. (Tr. 7-8, 19, 34) She has not served in the
military. (Tr. 8) In August 2020, she married, and she does not have any children. (Tr. 8)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that from about 2013 to August 2020, Applicant used marijuana
with varying frequency. She indicated she intended to cease using marijuana once her
security clearance is approved. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that she used marijuana in June 2020
and August 2020 after she completed her SCA on May 16, 2020.
In  2013,  after  Applicant  graduated  from  college,  she  used  marijuana  on  two
occasions. (Tr. 20-21) She said the next time she used marijuana was in April of 2018.
(Tr. 22)
In her May 16, 2020 SCA, Applicant said she answered yes to the question about
illegal drug use “due to federal regulations around THC/marijuana,” which is an indication
she was aware of the federal restrictions on marijuana use. She said in her SCA that her
most recent marijuana involvement was in March 2020. (GE 1 at 40) Elsewhere in her
May 16, 2020 SCA, she said her most recent marijuana use was around November 2019.
(Id. at 39) She explained her frequency of marijuana use was “approximately 10-20 times
through  the  years,”  and  she  explained  as  follows:  “I  have  never  purchased  marijuana
outside state-sanctioned THC/marijuana dispensaries. My first time in a dispensary was
after moving [to a state where possession of marijuana under state law is legal] in April
2018; I have been back to the dispensaries a few times (6-10 times since then). (Id. at
39-40)  On  July  17,  2020,  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator
reviewed her SCA responses relating to the recency and frequency of her marijuana use,
and Applicant agreed she made these responses on her SCA. (GE 2 at 6)
At her hearing, Applicant said when she used marijuana after completion of her
SCA, she believed her marijuana use was not prohibited for security reasons because it
was not illegal under state law. (Tr. 24) In June and August of 2020, she used marijuana
in a state where marijuana use is legal. (Tr. 23) In her response to DOHA interrogatories
on December 11, 2020, she said her most recent marijuana use was on August 8, 2020.
(GE 2 at 10) At her hearing, she said she did not use marijuana after August 2020. (Tr.
24)
On September 25, 2018, Applicant provided a urine sample for a substance-use
evaluation, and a laboratory detected 27 ng/ml of the marijuana or Delta-9-THC-COOH
metabolite in her urine sample. (Tr. 26; GE 3) Applicant’s October 9, 2018 substance-use
evaluation indicates Applicant made a self-report to the evaluator that her most recent
marijuana use was on September 1, 2018. (GE 4 at 19)
At her hearing,  Applicant  said she used marijuana for medical reasons. (Tr. 38)
She  ended  her  marijuana  use  in  August  2020,  and  now  she  takes  vitamins  and  uses
exercise to alleviate her cramps and pain. (Tr. 38-39) She promised not to use marijuana
in the future. (Tr. 39)
Applicant’s husband  continues to  use  marijuana, and  she  associates  with  him. (Tr.
28)  She  said that  he  purchases a  single marijuana  joint  at a  time, and  he  does not have
any  remaining  marijuana  stored  in  their  house. (Tr. 33)
Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges in August 2018, Applicant was arrested for driving under the
influence of alcohol (DUI). Her breathalyzer test result was a blood alcohol content (BAC)
of  .193.  SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  in  September  2018,  a  chemical  dependency  professional
evaluated Applicant and diagnosed her with alcohol abuse, uncomplicated.
In  August 2018, Applicant and  her husband  consumed  several drinks in a  bar. (Tr.
25) Applicant said  she  consumed  four to  six  drinks of  whiskey  over  about three  hours.
(Tr. 31) She did  not indicate  the number of ounces of whiskey in the  drinks. They walked
home   from   the   bar,  and   Applicant  went  to   sleep   for  several  hours.  (Tr.  25,  30)  She
awakened   and   discovered   her  husband   was  not  in   her  residence.  (Tr.  25)  She   was
worried   about   him,  and   she   decided   to   drive   around   looking  for him.  (Tr. 25) She   was
arrested  for speeding  and   DUI.  She  was surprised  her BAC was so  high. (Tr. 30) The
charges   were   subsequently   dismissed   because   the   police   officer  had  listened   to   her
conversation  with  her attorney. (Tr. 27,  29; GE  2; GE  5) In  2018,  Applicant  received  a
substance-use   evaluation,  which  indicated   a   “Billing   Diagnosis”   of   alcohol  abuse,
uncomplicated.  (GE  4  at  17)  Her  evaluation  summary  in  the  clinical  notes  indicates  a
diagnosis of alcohol-use disorder severe. (GE 4 at 19)
In August 2021, Applicant received an updated substance-use evaluation. (AE A)
The evaluating clinician concluded that she has never had an alcohol-use disorder. (Tr.
27; AE A) She had not received any alcohol-related counseling, and no counseling was
recommended. (Tr. 28; AE A at 14-15) The clinician said the “concept of relapse is a non-
issue.” (Id. at 14) Applicant drinks alcohol at an unremarkable responsible level. (AE A)
In  the  last  year,  Applicant  has  not  driven  after  consuming  alcohol.  (Tr.  32)  The
most alcohol she has consumed on any one occasion in the last year is three drinks. (Tr.
32)
",False
"In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  the  allegation  in  the  SOR.  He  also  provided
some  explanation  for  his  conduct.  I  adopt  his  admission  as  a  finding  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact. (Item 2)
Applicant  is  55  years  old.  He  is  married  with  two  children,  ages  18  and  11.  He
has worked as a scientist for his current employer, a federal contractor, since 1988. He
holds  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  has  held  a  top  secret  security  clearance  since  2003.
(Item 3)
The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana in August 2020, while having access
to classified information. (Item 1)
In  his  October  2020  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  Applicant  admitted
using marijuana in August 2020, while he held a security clearance. In January 2021, he
admitted  to  a  defense  investigator  that  he  used  marijuana  on  the  one  occasion  in
August of 2020. He described his action as taking two puffs of a marijuana cigarette in
his  home.  His  wife  had  obtained  the  marijuana  from  a  friend.  He  also  stated  he  was
experiencing  stress  from  being  locked  down.  He  admitted  to  the  investigator  that  he
used  marijuana  one  other  time  30  years  ago.  In  his  SOR  answer,  he  claimed  that  his
August 2020  use  of  marijuana  “was the  only time  that I have  ever used  any controlled
substance.” (Items 2-3)
Applicant claimed he was unaware of his company’s  drug policy. He also stated
his  intent  was  not  to  use  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  He  claimed  not  to  associate  with
people  who  used  drugs  and  stated  his  wife  does  not  do  so  either.  Since  Applicant
submitted  this  case  for  an  administrative  determination,  I  was  unable  to  judge  his
credibility based on demeanor. (Items 2-3)

"I  adhere  to  the  findings  of  fact  in  my  original  decision,  and  I  have  added  a
discussion  of  the  matters  submitted  by  Applicant  in  his  May  20,  2021  email.  I  have
admitted Applicant’s additional evidence as Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through F.
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f,
alleging multiple arrests for various offenses between April 2008 and November 2018. He
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a, alleging purchase and use of marijuana with varying
frequency from 2001 to about 2013 or 2014. He admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 3.a
and 3.b,  alleging that he falsified his SCA on  in  February 2007 and  February 2017  by
deliberately failure to disclose his drug involvement. His admissions in his answer and at
the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a  33-year-old vehicle  refueler employed  by  a  defense  contractor since
October 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married,  but
he  has  lived   with   a   cohabitant  since   October   2016.  He  and   his  cohabitant  have   a   16-
month-old daughter. (Tr. 19.)  In  his post-hearing  submission, he  included  a  photograph
of a  document reflecting the christening of  his daughter. (AX F.)
Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in
2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014. He stopped
using it because his employer started random drug testing, and he realized that it could
jeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.) In his first SCA in February 2007, he answered  “No” to  the
question whether he had used a drug or controlled substance within the past seven years.
(GX  1  at  23.)  He  testified  that  he  could  not  remember  why  he  did  not  disclose  his
marijuana use. (Tr. 28.) He also testified that there was no reason why he continued to
use marijuana until 2014, except stupidity. (Tr. 30.)
Applicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with brandishing a firearm. His
arrest occurred after he was involved in a bar fight, and one of the participants told police
that  he  had  brandished  a firearm. The  police  stopped  him  as  he drove  away  from  the
scene of the fight. He testified that he has never owned a firearm. The police  searched
the  vehicle  and  did  not  find  a  firearm.  He  appeared  in  court  and  was  found  not  guilty
because the police were unable to find a firearm. (GX 4 at 3; Tr. 34-35.)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  February  2009  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana. After the police stopped him for speeding, they found marijuana in the center
console of his car. He appeared in court and adjudication was deferred. He was placed
on probation for one year, required to attend drug-education classes, and was subjected
to  random  urinalysis.  He  successfully  completed  his  probation  and  the  charges  were
dismissed. (GX 4 at 3; GX 5.) He did not disclose this arrest in his February 2017 SCA.
He testified that he did not disclose his February 2017 arrest because he was told that
his arrest record would be expunged. (Tr. 31.)
In  November  2010,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana and having defective equipment on his car. After Applicant completed a period
of probation and drug classes, the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 12.) Applicant
did  not  disclose  this  arrest  to  his  employer.  He  testified  that  he  was  unaware  of  any
requirement  to  disclose  arrests  to  his  employer.  He  testified  that  did  not  disclose  this
arrest or his continued use of marijuana in his February 2017 SCA, because he was afraid
that it would jeopardize his clearance and his job. (Tr. 32-33, 39.)
In  January  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  with  reckless  driving,  having  an  open
container  of  alcohol  in  his  car,  and  possession  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was  with  his
cousin, and he told the police that the marijuana was his, because he did not want his
cousin to get in trouble. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant was convicted of the open-container offense
and reckless driving, but the marijuana charge was dismissed. (GX 13.)
In  November 2013,  Applicant was arrested for  maliciously  causing  bodily  injury  to
his  cohabitant.   He  testified   that   his  cohabitant  was  driving   home   after  they   had   been
drinking  at a  bar, they  began  arguing, his cohabitant began  swerving, and  he  grabbed  the
steering  wheel to  keep  the  car from  striking  a  guardrail. The  police  officer  who  noticed  the
swerving  stopped  them,  noticed  a  cut  on  the  cohabitant’s forehead,  and  concluded  that
Applicant had  hit her in  the  face. Applicant spent a  week in jail after his arrest.  (Tr. 53-
55.) The  charge  was later reduced  to  assault and  battery. In  February  2014, the  court
found   “facts  sufficient to  find   guilt,” but deferred   adjudication  for one   year. The   charge
was dismissed in February 2015. (GX 7.)
Applicant  submitted  his  second  SCA  in  February  2017.  He  answered  “No”  to  a
question  whether,  during  the  last  seven  years,  he  had  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled substances. He also answered “No” to a question whether he had ever used
or  otherwise  been  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a
security clearance. (GX 2 at 26.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2018, he
told the investigator that he had never been charged with an offense related to alcohol or
drugs. When  the  investigator  confronted  him  with  evidence  of  his  arrest  record,  which
included drug offenses, he disclosed his marijuana use, beginning in his teenage years
and ending in 2014. He told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use
while holding a security clearance because it did not matter, since he had stopped using
marijuana. He also told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use because
he misread the question. (GX 3 at 12-13.)
In July 2018, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on his cohabitant.
Applicant testified that he was driving home after work after a long work day and spending
some time after work at a friend’s house. He fell asleep and hit the rear of an 18-wheel
truck.  His  cohabitant  came  to  the  scene  and  was  taking  him  home  when  they  began
arguing, because his cohabitant refused to take him to a hospital. Applicant became angry
and cracked the windshield of their car by punching it with his fist. His cohabitant called
the police, who concluded that they had been fighting. (Tr. 57-63.) A protective order was
issued, prohibiting Applicant from having any contact with his cohabitant for three days.
(GX 9.)
Applicant  testified   that  he   was  charged   and   the   protective   order  was  issued
because  his cohabitant “got all  hysterical”  and  told  the  police  that he  had  smacked  her.
He  admitted   that,   on   several  occasions,   he   grabbed   her  and   shook  her  after  she   said
things intended  to  provoke  him. (Tr. 50-51.) In  September 8, 2018, he appeared  in court
and  pleaded   no   contest.   The   judge   found   “facts  sufficient  to   find   guilt”  and   deferred
adjudication   until  September  2020.  (GX   8.)   Applicant  completed   his  probation   and   the
charge  was dismissed.  (Tr.  63.) Applicant  and  his cohabitant  stayed  apart for about seven
or eight months  after  his arrest.  (Tr.  64.) He  testified  that  most of their  arguments  arose
from his cohabitant’s desire that he stay at home instead of socializing  with friends away
from   home   and   her  practice  of  saying   things   that  she   knew   would  provoke   him.   He
testified that the arguments and physical violence  stopped after their  daughter was born.
(Tr. 51-52.)
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI). His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was 0.17. In the jurisdiction where he
was arrested, jail time is mandatory for a BAC at or above 0.15. In March 2019, Applicant
was convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 175 days suspended, and a $250
fine.  He  was  placed  on  unsupervised  probation  for  one  year.  His  driver’s  license  was
restricted for one year, and he was required to install an ignition interlock on his vehicle.
(GX 10.) He served his jail sentence on weekends. (Tr. 66.)
Applicant admitted that many of his arrests were related to alcohol, but he does
not believe he has an alcohol problem. He has reduced his drinking since the birth of his
daughter. He testified that he drinks mainly on weekends and limits himself to about two
drinks  or  two  beers.  (Tr.  67.)  He  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  an  alcohol-abuse
disorder or received treatment for it.
A  friend  of  Applicant  who  has  known  him  for  12  years  submitted  a  statement
describing Applicant as “a very respectful and honest gentleman” and “the type of person
that  will  give  you  the  shirt  off  his  back.”  The  friend  does  not  indicate  whether  he  is  a
supervisor, co-worker, or a friend. The friend does not indicate whether he is familiar with
Applicant’s criminal record. (AX A.)
Applicant’s mother submitted a statement acknowledging that Applicant has done
things “that have not been pleasing to the way of his teaching,” but stating that he is now
a  family-oriented  person  who  is  striving  to  be  a  better  person.  His  mother  states  that
Applicant speaks often of his job and his love for it, and that he is proud of his 15 years
of service with his employer. (AX B.) Applicant submitted two photographs of a clock and
a montage of photographs containing the numeral 15, which he received in recognition of
15 years of service. (AX C, D, and E.)

Applicant used marijuana a number of times between about 2007 and 2009. He
did not use marijuana again until 2014. He smoked marijuana once or twice from about
October 2014 to June 2015. (Tr. at 14; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4, 5)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
May 2015 in conjunction with his job offer. He intentionally failed to report his marijuana
use.  He  explained  that  he  filled  out  the  SF  86  on  his  parents’  computer  with  their
assistance. His parents are very religious, and he did not want them to know about his
marijuana  use.  He  also  admitted  that  it  was  the  only  job  offer  he  received,  and  he
thought that it could affect the job offer if he revealed his marijuana use.  (Tr. at 19-20,
28-30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 5)
Applicant received his security clearance in 2015. He continued to use marijuana
on  an  irregular  basis.  He  used  psilocybin  mushrooms  in  October  2016.  He  used
marijuana  at  the  same  time,  which  was  the  last  time  he  used  any  illegal  controlled
substances. (Tr. at 14-17, 30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5)
Applicant  interviewed  for  a  position  with  another  company  in  July  2017.  The
position  required  a  top  secret  clearance  and  eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive
compartmented information (SCI). It was at that time that Applicant realized the gravity
of his actions. He looked at brochures from his company, and he discovered he had an
affirmative  duty  to  self-report  his  marijuana  and  mushroom  use.  He  held  off  until
October 2017 in order to complete a program, and he then self-reported his illegal drug
use to his facility security officer (FSO), who reported it to the DOD. He also indicated
that he delayed his self-reporting because he was afraid of losing his job and going to
jail. (Tr. at 30-31, 34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 5)
Applicant submitted  another SF  86  at his FSO’s request  in  November  2017.  He
fully reported his illegal drug use. He reported that he used marijuana in total less than
20 times. His description of his drug use has been consistent when he was interviewed
for  his  background  investigation  in  2018,  in  his  reply  to  DOD  interrogatories,  in  his
response  to  the  SOR,  and  at  his  hearing.  Applicant  also  told  the  background
investigator that he paid for the services of prostitutes in Mexico in 2015 and 2016. (Tr.
at 14-15, 17-18, 31-33; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4, 5)
Applicant’s  security  clearance  was  suspended  in  about  December  2017.  In  his
July 2019 reply to DOD interrogatories, he admitted that he engaged the services of a
prostitute  in  Amsterdam  in  June  2019.  (Tr.  at  17-19,  31-34;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 4, 5)
Applicant  was  evaluated  in  December  2020  by  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker
(LCSW), who is also a certified substance abuse counselor, among other qualifications.
She  tested  Applicant  and  interviewed  him.  She  also  had  access  to  the  SOR.  They
discussed  his  substance  abuse  and  interactions  with  prostitutes.  She  concluded  that
there was no diagnosis, and that “[b]ased upon all information available to [her],” it was
her opinion that “[Applicant]  is not at risk of  relapse or return to  his previous behavior.”
(AE A, B)
There  are  inconsistencies  between  Applicant’s  statements  about  his  drug  use
and involvement with prostitutes before and during his hearing and his statements to the
LCSW about those events. She reported that Applicant told her that he used marijuana
twice in 2007 and in the fall of 2008. He did not use marijuana again for about six years
until  2014,  when  he  used  it  once.  He  told  her  that  he  used  it  again  with  psilocybin
mushrooms  in  2016  while  visiting  a  friend  in  a  state  that  had  made  marijuana  legal
under  state  law.  She  stated  in  her  report:  “[Applicant]  reported  that  after  the  trip  to
[State]  he  made  the  conscious  decision  that  he  was  never  going  to  use  substances
again. He returned home and self-reported to his security officer at work.” Regarding his
involvement with prostitutes, she wrote: “[Applicant] received a manual stimulation after
a  legitimate  massage.  However,  the  two  subsequent  engagements  with  paid  sexual
activities  were  not  consum[matt]ed.” This  is  inconsistent  with  his testimony  that  two  of
the encounters involved masturbation and the third involved “oral sex.” (Tr. At 35-37; AE
A)
Applicant stated that he does not intend to use illegal drugs or solicit prostitutes
in  the  future.  He  passed  drug  tests  in  December  2020  and  July  2021.  He  provided  a
signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse,
acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of
national security eligibility. He has minimal contact with individuals who use drugs, and
he  will  leave  if  he  finds  himself  in  a  place  where  drugs  are  present.  He  informed  his
fiancée  of  his  drug  use  and  involvement  with  prostitutes.  (Tr.  at  15-17,  19,  23-24,  27;

"Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2004. She married in
2015 and has a four-year-old child. She held an interim secret security clearance in 2008
and was granted a secret security clearance in 2009, which she has held to the present.
She has been employed by the same federal contractor since August 2006. (Items 3, 5,
6)
In  Applicant’s May 2019  security clearance application  (SCA) she disclosed  that
she  used  marijuana  from  January  1999  to  March  2019.  She  stated:  “I  have  used
marijuana  at concerts or specific events.  She  said:  “This may  happen  about 2  times a
year.” She admitted that she held a security clearance at the time of her uses. She stated:
“I have no plans to continue use, however, I do not know that I would not use it again in
those instances.” (GE 3)
During   Applicant’s  background   interview,  the   government  investigator  inquired
about her last marijuana  use  in March  2019.  Applicant  stated  she  was at a  concert and
may   have   passively   inhaled  marijuana   so   she   listed   this as  a   “use.” She   said  she   last
smoked  marijuana  in 2016  at a  concert. She  said it is usually  provided  by  unknown  people
at concerts. She  has used  marijuana  intermittently  throughout the  years, sometimes going
many  years without using. She  stated  she  had  no  further intent to  use  marijuana  in  the
future. She  explained  however that she cannot control others smoking marijuana  around
her when  she  attends concerts  or events and  that she  could  inhale  marijuana  while  there
and   then   she   could  potentially   test  positive   during   a   drug   test.   She   will  try   her  best  to
remove herself  from  crowds  where marijuana is being used. (GE 4)
Applicant  stated  she  did  not  fully  understand  the  consequences  of  smoking
marijuana, but learned it could jeopardize her career and it is not worth using. She claimed
she was unaware of any policy by her employer that prohibited marijuana use outside of
work. (GE 4)
In  Applicant’s response  to  the  FORM  she  stated: “During my interview, I did not
deny  what  was  in  my  application.  I  did  not  read  the  investigator’s  summary  as
contradictory to my response, so did not object to the report.” (AE A)

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except ¶ 3.c, which he denied. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He married in 2004 and divorced in 2009. He has three
children ages 17, 14, and 6. The two older children live with Applicant. The younger child
lives in another state. Applicant has been employed by federal contractors since at least
2008, with a period of unemployment from May to August 2019. He has been with his
present employer since August 2019. He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item
3)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  military  from  October  2004  to  December
2005 and was honorably discharged. He then served in the National Guard from 2008 to
2014. He tested positive for opioids or oxycodone on a random drug test, administered
by  his  National  Guard  unit,  in  May  2013.  In  September  2014,  he  received  a  General
Discharge  for  alcohol  or  other  drug  abuse.  Applicant  acknowledged  using  an  expired
prescription of oxycodone. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant’s  medical  records  reflect  that  he  was  prescribed  oxycodone  by  his
doctor.  While  he  was  being  weaned  off  this  drug,  another  drug  was  prescribed  as  a
replacement. The medical records show that on December 2, 2011, his doctor authorized
him to take a maximum of four oxycodone 15 milligram tablets a day. On December 12,
2011,  he  was  advised  by  his  doctor  that  the  continued  use  of  a  narcotic  for  pain
management  had  potential  problems,  such  as  dependence  and  tolerance.  The  doctor
discussed with Applicant alternative pain management methods and the plan to reduce
his prescribed narcotic medication. On December 28, 2011, the doctor reduced the daily
maximum to three tablets; and on January 25, 2012, the prescription was reduced to a
half-tablet to be taken as needed every six hours during the first week, every eight hours
during the second week, every twelve hours during the third week, and once a day during
the  fourth  week.  After  the  fourth  week,  Applicant’s  doctor  directed  him  to  stop  taking
oxycodone. (Item 4)
On January 30, 2012, the doctor prescribed a new replacement medication. The
medical records show that during Applicant’s appointments, the doctor assessed whether
Applicant  was  becoming  dependent  on  oxycodone.  For  each  visit  that  he  prescribed
oxycodone, the doctor prescribed a certain number of pills and specifically noted that “no
refills” were authorized.
During  Applicant’s  October  2019  background  interview  with  a  government
investigator, he explained that in 2011 he had been prescribed oxycodone while in the
military for a back injury. His prescription expired in 2012 or 2013. He did not use all of
the pills during the period the prescription was valid and had pills left over. (Item 4)
After  his  military  discharge,  though  he  was  no  longer  prescribed  oxycodone,
Applicant stated he continued to take about one tablet a month until October 2019 from
pills that were left over from his prior prescriptions. Although he had  oxycodone pills that
were originally prescribed to him, he was no longer authorized to take them, as noted in
his medical record. He told the government investigator that he did not believe taking the
pills  was  illegal  or  wrong  after  the  prescription’s  expiration  date  because  the  pills  had
been prescribed to him. (Item 4)
Applicant held a security clearance during the time he was taking the expired and
unauthorized  oxycodone  prescription.  He  told  the  government  investigator  that  he
intended  to  get  a  new  prescription  because  he  was  unaware  that  using  an  expired
prescription was an issue or concern. (Item 4)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated:
I did not know of any law or regulation preventing me from taking as needed
expired medication that was prescribed to me. I had spoken to my doctor
back then about not prescribing me anymore due to the fact I had some left
from my previous prescriptions, but I was told to have them filled and just
take as needed. (Item 2)
Again I was unaware I was not allowed to take expired medication that was
prescribed to me. (Item 2)
Applicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) in September 2019
and did not disclose any financial delinquencies. He did not disclose that he failed to file
federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  any  tax  year.  During  his  October  2019
background interview, he disclosed that he had not timely filed his federal or state income
tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2018. His explanation for failing to  disclose this
information on his SCA was that because he believed he was due a refund, he did not
have to disclose his failure to file on his SCA. He did not have an explanation for why he
failed to timely file the returns for tax years 2015 through 2018. He told the investigator
that he was in the process of trying to obtain his W-2 income statements for the delinquent
years, so he can file. Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR, will not
be  considered  for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  be  considered  when  applying
mitigating conditions, making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
(Items 3, 4)
Applicant  received  Government  interrogatories  on  December  11,  2020.  In  his
February 2021 response, he indicated he had filed his 2017, 2018, and 2019 federal and
state tax returns on December 14, 2020. He stated he was unable to find his W-2 income
statements  for  tax  years  2015  and  2016,  but  he  was  moving  soon,  and  he  would  go
through his boxes to find them, and then file the tax returns for these years. He anticipated
he would receive refunds for these tax years. He did not provide copies of his 2017, 2018,
or 2019 federal or state income tax returns to show when or if they were filed. He indicated
in his response to interrogatories that he did not owe federal income taxes for 2017, 2018,
or 2019. He stated he did not owe state income taxes for 2017 or 2019, but owed $157
for 2018 and that he mailed a check for the amount to the state. No documentary proof
was provided. (Item 4)
During Applicant’s background interview, he disclosed that he was approximately
$12,000 in arrears for child support. He explained that his child’s mother did not file for
child support until 2015, when the child was one-year-old. Applicant had sent money for
the  child  and  was  given  credit  for  his  payments  by  the  court,  but  he  still  owed  about
$7,500. He said that an additional $100 was being taken from his pay each month, but
because he had a period of unemployment, he was unable to make the payments and
that is why he believed he owed about $12,000. In his FORM response, Applicant stated
that his child support arrearage was satisfied when he filed his delinquent tax returns and
refunds were applied to the arrearage. He did not provide any documentary evidence to
substantiate his tax returns were filed and his child support is in good standing. (Items 2,
4; AE A)
Applicant did  not disclose  other  delinquent debts in  his SCA.  He  was confronted
by the investigator with the debts alleged in  SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($341); 1.b ($149); 1.c ($1,200);
1.d   ($4,511);  1.f   ($796);  and   1.g   ($558).  Applicant  denied   being   aware  of   any   of   the
delinquent  debts,   except  SOR  ¶   1.f,   which  was  owed   to   the   Defense   Financial  and
Accounting  Service (DFAS) for failing  to  return equipment  before his military  discharge.
He said  he  lost it. Applicant told  the  investigator that  the  debt in  SOR ¶  1.b  was for  car
insurance  that  he  let expire, and  he  thought it  was paid in  full. Regarding  all  of  the  alleged
debts,  he   told   the   investigator  that  he   would  follow   up   with   the   creditors.  In   his  SOR
answer, he  admitted  all of  the  debts except SOR ¶  3.c,  which he  denied, stating  he  did
not know  what the  debt was for. He did not provide  information  on  what action  he  may
have  taken  to  research  this debt.  All  of  the  SOR debts are corroborated  by  Applicant’s
admissions and credit reports from  September 2019 and December  2020. (Items 3, 4, 5,
6)
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he stated he had resolved the DFAS debt,
but  provided  no  documentary  proof.  He  stated  that  he  cannot  find  his  W-2  income
statements to file his 2015 and 2016 federal and state income tax returns. They remain
delinquent. He is confident he was entitled to receive refunds, but because it has been
more than three years since the required filing date, he would not receive them. Regarding
the resolution of his remaining debts he stated: “I fully intend to have them paid in full. I
would like to have them paid off within the next year or so if not earlier from my taxes next
year.”  He  provided  no  other  information  regarding  the  resolution  of  any  of  his  other
delinquent debts. (AE A)
As part of Applicant’s government interrogatories, he provided a personal financial
statement. He does not list any debts that he is currently paying. He notes at the end of
the month he has a surplus of $1,791. (Item 4)

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  degrees  of  frequency
from  June  1994,  to  present.  SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  in  2003  he  was  charged  with
possession of concentrated cannabis, a felony, and later in 2003, he was convicted of a
lesser misdemeanor-level offense and placed on three years of probation.
In April 2003, Applicant and his roommates were growing marijuana, and Applicant
was arrested for possession of concentrated cannabis. (Item 3 at 35; Item 4 at 8) He was
found guilty of a misdemeanor-level marijuana-related charge. He was sentenced to 75
days of custody/work release, which was reduced to 45 days for good behavior. (Id.) He
paid  fines  and  fees  totaling  $4,746,  and  he  successfully  completed  three  years  of
probation. (Id.) Ultimately, his conviction was dismissed and expunged. (Item 3 at 36)
In   Applicant’s  SCA,   he   said   he   used   marijuana   from   June   1994   (estimated),   to
February   2019,  for  recreational  purposes   on   a   daily   basis  for  several  months
“interspersed   with   years of  abstinence.” (Item   3   at  37) He did not   use   marijuana   while
holding   a   security   clearance   or  a   sensitive   position.  (Id.)  He  said,   “I  do   not   want  to
jeopardize  my  career or national security. If  this substance  becomes permissible to  use
while  employed  with  a  secret  clearance  at some  point,  I may  consider using  it again.” (Id.
at 38).
On  May  15,  2019,  Applicant  told  an  investigator  from  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) that he used marijuana recreationally with friends, and occasionally
by himself, and his most recent marijuana use was in February 2019. (Item 4 at 8) He
said “there is a slim chance he will use THC in the future, it depends on what happens at
the federal level.” (Id. at 9) In April 2020, Applicant responded to a DOHA question about
his marijuana use  since February 2019, and he said  that he used marijuana  “[s]everal
times per year usually with  holidays.” (Id. at 4) He did not specifically indicate his most
recent marijuana use.
In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  described  Applicant’s  security-significant
behavior and noted the absence of mitigation. The FORM informed Applicant that he had
30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a documentary response
setting  forth  objections,  rebuttal,  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  explanation,  as
appropriate.  .  .  .  If  Applicant  does  not  file  any  objections  or  submit  any  additional
information . . . [his] case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination
based  solely” on  the  evidence  set  forth  in  this  FORM.  (FORM at 3 (emphasis added))
Applicant did not provide any response to the FORM.

"Applicant is 36 years old and married. He and his wife have a 15-year-old daughter,
a 4-year-old son, and 19-month-old son. He received his General Education Development
(GED) in  May 2002,  and  subsequently completed  one  semester’s worth  of  community
college  classes.  He  has  worked  for  defense  contractors  almost  continuously  since
September 2006. Throughout this time, he has also worked second jobs at restaurants
and at a nightclub. Since March 2020, Applicant has worked as a property manager and
equipment  specialist  for  his  current  employer.  He  first  applied  for  a  secret  security
clearance in 2012 and has continuously held classified access since 2012. He completed
his second SCA in January 2018. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 12-14, 21-29, 80)
Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He first used marijuana in 1995, at
the age of ten, when his mother introduced it to him, and used marijuana at the age of 16
for six months. Starting in 2003, when he was 18, Applicant used marijuana three to four
times a month. He stopped using marijuana from 2009 to 2012, when he worked for a
defense contractor that conducted random drug tests. At the hearing, he admitted that he
discontinued using marijuana during this period, because he was fearful of losing his job.
(GE 2; Tr. 48-50, 54, 59, 67-69)
In 2012, Applicant completed a SCA for employment with a new company. This
defense contractor required a pre-employment drug test, but it did not conduct random
drug testing of its employees. Applicant knew that it was against his employer’s policy to
use drugs, including marijuana, and he was aware that marijuana use could  adversely
affect his employment and security clearance status. In his 2012 SCA, Applicant did not
disclose his history of marijuana use, despite using marijuana during the previous seven
years. This issue was not alleged in the LOI; therefore, it is not disqualifying behavior, but
it will be considered within the Guideline E mitigation analysis and whole-person analysis.
(GE 1; GE 2 at 4-5, 23; Tr. 48-50, 54, 59-61, 67-69)
After  his  pre-employment  drug  test  in  2012,  Applicant  resumed  using  and
purchasing marijuana. In his September 2018 background interview, he admitted that he
used marijuana daily after work from 2012 until November 2015. At the hearing, he initially
claimed that  he  “may  have  done  it  a  couple  of  times,  like  on  occasions from  what  [he
could]  remember.” He  eventually  admitted  that  the  information  he  told  the  background
investigator regarding his marijuana use was accurate. (GE 2 at 4-5; Tr. 60)
Starting in November 2014, Applicant worked as a bouncer at a nightclub.  After
leaving work at the nightclub on a Sunday night in November 2015, Applicant was pulled
over  by  the  police,  because  his  license-plate  light  was  out.  The  police  officer  smelled
marijuana  coming  from  his  vehicle  and  asked  Applicant  if  he  possessed  marijuana.
Applicant affirmatively answered, and the police seized a small bag of marijuana from his
pants  pocket  and  three-ounce  bag  of  marijuana  from  his  gym  bag.  At  the  hearing,  he
admitted that he purchased the three-ounce bag from a coworker that night, and he used
marijuana prior to the traffic stop. Applicant planned to give some of the marijuana to his
mother-in-law, but the remainder was for his personal use. (GE 2 at 3; Tr. 32-34, 48-50,
54, 59, 67-69, 71-72)
The  police  officer  who  detained  Applicant,  told  him  to  call  a  specific  police
investigator the next day. Applicant was then released, he was not taken into custody or
arrested. Applicant called the police investigator, who wanted him to provide information
as to where he obtained the marijuana. Additionally, the investigator wanted him to go
undercover to help the police conduct a sting operation. Applicant refused to name his
dealer or provide additional assistance, as he did not want to get “involved.” (GE 2; Tr.
33)
Applicant  stated  multiple  times,  throughout  the  course  of  his  September  2018
background  interview,  that  he  discontinued  his  marijuana  use  following  the  November
2015 traffic stop. He adopted this statement, without any  changes, in his August 2019
response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  and  reaffirmed  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  in
November 2015. (GE 2 at 5, 22)
In June 2016, Applicant was pulled over by a highway patrol officer, and he was
arrested due to an outstanding warrant related to the incident that occurred in November
2015.  He  was  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana,  in  the  first  degree,  a  felony.
Following  his  2016  arrest,  Applicant’s  defense  attorney  recommended  that  Applicant
participate  in  a  six-week  drug  education  class.  Additionally,  the  prosecution  agreed  to
dismiss  the  charges  (nolle  prosse)  after  Applicant  completed  a  six-month  pretrial
intervention program (PTIP). During the PTIP, Applicant was subject to six random drug
tests, all of which were negative, and he was not diagnosed with a drug use disorder. He
paid  all  associated  fines  and  court  costs.  As  a  result  of  Applicant’s  compliance  and
successful completion of the PTIP, the charges was dismissed. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; AE
1; AE 2, AE 3; AE 4; AE 5; Tr. 31-32, 36-45, 58, 77, 87)
Applicant testified that prior to his arrest in June 2016, he  used marijuana three
times a week. He affirmed in his March 2021 affidavit that he used marijuana until June
2016. At the hearing, he was confronted regarding the inconsistent information he gave
to the background investigator during his September 2018 interview. Specifically, that he
discontinued using marijuana in November 2015. He claimed the inconsistency was the
result of confusion. (GE 2; AE 7; Tr. 78-79)
According  to  Applicant, he was able  to  stop  using  marijuana  in 2016, in part, due
to   the   PTIP   and   the   classes   he   received.   He  has  not  attended   drug   counseling   or
Narcotics  Anonymous   (NA)  meetings  since   his  PTIP   program   ended   in  approximately
August 2017. As of  the  day  of  the  hearing, he  intended  to  continue  to  abstain from   all
future marijuana  use  and  provided  a  signed  affidavit  affirming  his intent. (AE  7; Tr. 45, 50-
53, 76-7)
In January 2018, Applicant submitted his  second SCA. He failed to disclose his
involvement with illegal drugs, his 2015 traffic stop and 2016 drug-related arrest, and his
employment  as  a  bouncer  at  the  nightclub.  Applicant  admitted  to  the  background
investigator that he did not list his marijuana use, because he was afraid he would lose
his job. Additionally, he told the background investigator that his criminal defense attorney
told him he could have the 2016 arrest expunged from his record if he went through the
proper steps, but at the time of the interview, he had not taken any action. (GE 2 at 4-5)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that his criminal defense attorney told him that
he was not required to disclose the arrest in his 2018 SCA, because the charges were
ultimately dropped. Upon further questioning, he disclosed that he knew he was required
to report his drug use, regardless of the status of the criminal charges.  Additionally, he
reaffirmed that he was concerned that his drug involvement and arrest he would cost him
his job. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 55-56, 80)
Following both the incident in November 2015 and his arrest in 2016, Applicant did
not notify his employer, a defense contractor, of the issues. He was afraid that he would
lose his job. At the hearing, he testified that he recognized that this was a mistake and a
security violation. (GE 2 at 3; GE 3; Tr. 33-34, 72)
During his September 2018 background interview, Applicant admitted he had not
disclosed his drug use and arrest to his FSO, but he intended to notify them. In his August
2019 response to the DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he disclosed the derogatory
information to his FSO  after he  received  the  interrogatory package.  At  the hearing,  he
claimed he told his FSO about his drug use and 2016 arrest in March 2018, prior to his
background interview. (GE 2; GE 55-56, 60-62, 65-66, 73)
Although his mother-in-law continues to use marijuana, Applicant has made it clear
to her that she cannot use it at his home or around him.  He no longer associates with
anyone  else  who  uses  marijuana.  His  received  a  pre-employment  drug  test  in  2016.
Following a workplace accident, Applicant was screened in 2019, and both of these drug
tests were negative. Applicant testified that he intends to provide truthful and accurate
information regarding his drug and arrest history in the future. (GE; Tr. 34-35, 46-47, 57,
74-77)

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from August
2008, to about March 2019. (Item 1) SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that in about March 2019 he used
marijuana after completing an SCA. (Item 2)
In his March 27, 2019 SCA Applicant said that he occasionally smoked marijuana
from August 2008 to “January 2018,” and he said:
Occasionally   I  would  smoke   in   social   settings  with   friends  or   family.
Typically  I would smoke  at  home, by  myself, while  playing  videogames or
reading.  For  the   second   half   of  high   school   and   throughout  most   of   my
undergraduate  studies,  I would smoke  0-5  times a  week. In  graduate  school
I smoked  less,  once every  two  weeks or so.  Since  leaving  graduate school
I  have   smoked   with   decreasing   regularity,  once   every   few   months.  .  .   .  I
have  not  smoked  since  January  2019, as  part of  a  New  Years resolution, I
do not plan  to start again. (Item 3 at 104)
On April 22, 2019, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed
Applicant. (Item 4) His interview about Applicant’s marijuana use was consistent with his
SCA, and he clarified that he used marijuana in March 2019. (Id. at 10) He offered to quit
using marijuana. (Id.) He received marijuana from his stepfather and brother. (Id.) He has
not tested positive for use of illegal drugs, and he does not use any other illegal drugs
except for marijuana. (Id.)
In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  described  Applicant’s  security-significant

"Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for

married  with three  children.  (Transcript (Tr.)  at  19-20; GE  1)
Applicant started smoking marijuana in about 1999 when he was in college.  He
was  a  track  athlete  and  did  not  use  marijuana  while  training.  He  continued  to  use
marijuana  on  an  irregular  basis  (about  once  a  year)  after  he  was  hired  by  his  current
employer  and  after  he  was  granted  a  security  clearance.  His  employer  maintains  a
drug-free  workplace.  He  was  aware  that  marijuana  use  was  against  his  company’s
policy and in conflict with his responsibilities as a security clearance holder.  As he got
older,  marijuana  became  less  important  to  him.  His  last  use  was  in  December  2016,
when he ate a marijuana edible. (Tr. at 18-19, 22-28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1, 3)
Applicant reported his marijuana use on the Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) he submitted in April 2019. He reported that he last used marijuana in
December 2016. He checked the box indicating that he intended to use marijuana in the
future,  with  the  explanation:  “I  do  not  seek  out  or  purchase  THC  products,  however
based on past experience there have been rare occasions when used.” (GE 1)
Applicant  indicated  that  he  erred  on  the  side  of  over  reporting  when  he  stated
that he intended to use marijuana in the future. He  is remorseful and understands that
illegal  drug  use  is  inconsistent  with  holding  a  security  clearance.  He  credibly  and
unequivocally testified that he does not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug
in  the  future.  He  has  a  family  and  a  good  job  where  he  is  a  valued  and  rewarded
employee,  and  he  does  not  want  to  jeopardize  his  family  or  his  job.  He  returned  to
competitive  long-distance  running  in  2016,  and  marijuana  use  is  not  conducive  to  his

"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  49  years  old  and  has  worked  for  a  DoD  contractor  as  a  systems
engineer  since  2014.  He  has  a  high  school  diploma  and  has  earned  a  number  of
professional  certifications.  He  married  and  divorced  once  as  a  young  man.  He
subsequently cohabited with a woman for a number of years and married her in 2008. He
has an adult stepchild. (Tr. at 21, 35.)
After graduating from high school in 1991, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force
with the intent to serve until his mandatory retirement. He wrote in his SCA that he was
discharged  in  April  1993  under  “General  Honorable  Conditions.”  He  then  wrote
“Discharge Detail Other Than Honorable,” suggesting that the character of his discharge
was Under Other Than Honorable Conditions.”  He also wrote in his SCA that the reason
for  his  discharge  was  a  “Reduction  in  forces.”  He  provided  the  same  reason  at  the
hearing. (SCA at18; Tr. at 22.)
In his May 2019 background interview (2019 Interview), Applicant disclosed that
he was discharged for misconduct. The only detail he said he could recall was the phrase
conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline.  In an April 2016 background interview
(2016  Interview),  Applicant  was  more  forthcoming  about  his  military  discharge.  He
disclosed  that  he  received  a  letter  of  reprimand  in  January  1993  for  disrespecting  a
superior and served a day, but not overnight, in the Correctional Custody Unit. He had
also been repeatedly counseled for dereliction of duties and for a poor attitude. On two
occasions,  he  received  letters  of  counseling  for  dereliction  of  duties.  He  blamed  his
superior officer for treating him differently than others due to his religious faith. In the 2016
Interview, he claimed he was told that he was being released under a reduction in forces
separation process. (2019 Interview at 6; 2016 Interview at 13.)
Applicant attended a class at a junior college when he was a senior in high school.
During the period August 1995 to May 1997, Applicant attended a tech school and earned
two  IT  certificates  of  completion.  In  subsequent  years,  he  was  awarded  additional  IT
certifications, mostly through self-study. Since 2014 or 2015, he has worked for a Federal
contractor as a systems engineer. He held a security clearance when he served in the Air
Force. He was not granted an interim security clearance after submitting his SCA in 2015.
His employer would like Applicant to have a clearance so that he could work on classified
matters, but he can continue his employment at his company without a clearance. It would
be helpful to both his employer and Applicant if he had a clearance to work directly on
classified  contracts  rather  than  around  the  perimeter  in  an  unclassified  environment.
(SCA at 13; Tr. at 20, 22-24, 27-32.)
SOR Allegations
Paragraph 1, Guideline  H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse
In his Answer, Applicant admitted  the facts alleged in the two subparagraphs of
the  SOR  under  this  guideline.  In  his  Supplemental  Answer,  he  specifically  denied  the
allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b. The specific facts regarding each of the allegations are as follows:
1.a  –  Use of marijuana in April  and  May 2019  –  In his 2019 Interview, Applicant
reported that he was given an item sample containing ingredients made from cannabis
by a vendor at an April 2019 Earth Day event. This occurred about a month before the
interview.  He consumed the product thinking it was a candy and not knowing it was a
marijuana edible (Edible). This was the first time he ever consumed “marijuana,”  using
that term broadly to include all products derived from marijuana. At the event, which is
generally  associated  with  marijuana,  Edibles  were  for  sale.  Applicant  claimed  that  the
item he consumed was not labeled to show that it contained marijuana. He later learned
that he had consumed an Edible. He testified it was not his intent to consume marijuana
or a marijuana product when he attended this event. (Tr. at 36-39; GE 2 at 9.)
In  his  2019  Interview,  Applicant  further  reported  that  his  wife  subsequently
purchased more Edibles at a cannabis dispensary in Applicant’s home state  where the
sale of such products is legal under state law. Applicant deliberately consumed Edibles a
few more times after his first experience with Edibles. At the time of the 2019 Interview
on May 21, 2019, he was still consuming Edibles. He said that was taking the Edibles to
ease shoulder pain and to sleep better at night. He intended to see his doctor in the near
future “to get a note for this.” At the time of the Interview, Applicant acknowledged that he
was aware that Edibles were not legal under Federal law. (GE 2 at 9.)
Applicant  provided  additional  information  in  his  October  2019  responses  to
DOHA’s Interrogatories about his past use of Edibles. He confirmed the accuracy of the
report  of  his  2019  Interview  regarding  his  past  drug  use  and  adopted  the  statements
contained in the report. He also wrote:
I would like  to  ensure clarification  that this [past use  of  edibles] was a  rather
desperate  occurrence  due  to  my  shoulder pain  preventing  me  from  sleeping
and this was only  done  after several (4-5) days of  (almost) no  sleep due to
the shoulder pain.
Hence  forth  [sic]  I have resorted to the prescription medications for pain as
prescribed  by my doctor despite the  negative effects associated.
He  also  corrected  a  statement  in  the  report  of  the  2019  Interview,  noting  that:  “The
strength of the product in question, while 10 mg per standard dose, was divided and was
not 15mg [as written in the report]. The approximate dosing was 2.5-5 mg.” (GE 2 at 3-4,
19, 21-22.)
In his January 2020 Answer, Applicant confirmed that he consumed Edibles in April
and May 2019 to help him sleep after “excessive periods of time when [he was] unable to
sleep.” He wrote that his decision to consume Edibles was made out of “desperation.” He
wrote further:
I have, as intended,  engaged  with  my  primary  care  physician  in exploring
FDA  approved  medications to  assist with  my  incremental sleep  problems.
My  primary  care physician  and  I are exploring  medications to  resolve  sleep
issues  that  do   not  leave   lingering   effects  the   following   day   that   could
potentially affect my work performance.
Answer at 1.
At the  hearing, Applicant explained  that he  consumed  the  Edibles  in 2019  under
extraordinary   circumstances.   He  experienced   significant   pain  in   his  shoulder  due   to   a
work-related  injury  and  was unable to  sleep  for about three  days. He ate  the  Edibles to
help him  sleep  on  two or three  occasions  while  he  was waiting  to  see  his workers’  comp
doctor.   He  made  a  point  that   he  only   used   a   “quarter”   of  the   “standard   dosing” in  the
square Edible  and  that his use  was infrequent  and  an  “isolated  incident.”   He waited  “a
very  short period  of  time” to  see  his workers’  comp  doctor, an  orthopedist.  The  doctor
gave  Applicant  a  prescription  for his pain.  The  medication  helped  him  sleep  without using
the  Edibles. He  also made  a  comment about  how  long  it takes  to  be  seen  by  a  workers’
comp   doctor,   which  was  inconsistent  with   his  earlier  testimony   that  he   had   an
appointment  with   that   doctor  after  only   waiting   a   short  time.   Also,  he   provided   no
testimony   regarding   his  primary   care  physician   or  that  doctor’s  role   in   “exploring
medications” with Applicant.   (Tr. at 40-50, 56.)
Applicant has not used Edibles since May 2019, the month of his 2019 Interview.
During the period when he was unable to sleep, Applicant did not consider the option of
seeing a doctor at a 24-hour healthcare facility. Applicant believed that was not a viable
option  because  he  assumed  that this type  of doctor  would tell  him  to  take  Tylenol  for  his
pain.  He did not believe  that an  over the  counter drug  like  Tylenol would be  sufficiently
helpful  for his condition. Applicant  confirmed  at the  hearing  that he  knew  at the  time  he
consumed  the  Edibles  that  it  was not  legal to  do  so  under Federal  law  and  that it  was
against  his employer’s drug  policy. He also confirmed  that he  understood  that at  the  time
of   his  use   of   the   Edibles,  he   was  under  consideration   for   a   security   clearance.   In
explaining   his  thought   process  at  the   time   he   consumed   the   Edibles,   he   provided   a
curious analogy  between  marijuana  and  alcohol, stating  that they  have  “pretty  much  the
same  restrictions” and  both  are  “controlled.”  He made  the  same  point in his post-hearing
submission  (AE  A), writing  that:  “edibles are available to  the  general public in an  over the
counter fashion  just  like  alcohol.” He noted at  both the hearing  and  repeated  in  AE  A  his
wife  had  leftover prescription  pain medication  and  that  he  chose  not to  take  the  medication
since  the  prescription  was not written  for him. He commented  in AE  A  that “prescription
pain killers are controlled  substances that are  not publicly  available in  an  over the  counter
fashion, like  alcohol.” He argued  that he  made  the  better choice by  using  Edibles, not the
leftover pills, to  relieve  his pain.  Applicant was unaware at the  hearing  that  marijuana  is
a Schedule I  controlled  substance  under the  Federal  Controlled   Substances Act, even
though,  as  noted,  he  knew  that  marijuana  was illegal under Federal  law. (Tr. at 45, 48-
50, 54-56; AE A  at 2.)
1.b  –  Expressed intent to  continue  using marijuana  in the  future  –  In his 2019
Interview, Applicant also made the statement that he may consider taking Edibles in the
future if needed for pain. He advised that he was going to see his doctor in the near future
and  to  get a  “note” for  using  Edibles. In response to the Government’s  interrogatories,
Applicant  was  given  the  opportunity  to  correct  any  errors  in  the  report  of  his  2019
Interview, and he made a number of corrections. None of his corrections addressed his
comments about his intention to use Edibles in the future. (GE 2 at 9, 18-20.)
In his Answer, Applicant explained that his comment about future use made during
his 2019 Interview was made “with the caveat of only under extreme circumstances, such
as having not slept for upwards of 72 hours, and only in the event of a delay in interacting
with my primary care physician to help resolve the problem.” He wrote further:
Since the time of my interview no further use has occurred as my primary
care physician was able to see me in a very expedited manner and begin
addressing the problem.
Answer at 1.  In  his  Supplemental Answer, Applicant specifically  answered  SOR allegation
in subparagraph  1.b  by  stating: “I deny  that  I  have  intent to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.”
(Supplemental Answer at 1.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  discussed  further  the  “note”  he  wanted  his  doctor  to
provide, which he discussed in his 2019 Interview. He explained that he wanted the doctor
to write “something to state that it was a pertinent solution to the immediate problem,” that
being his lack of sleep due to shoulder pain. He explained further that the note  should
address  that  Applicant’s  use  of  edibles  was  “a  last-minute  desperate  solution  to  an
impossible   problem.”   He  did  not   provide   such   a   note   from   his  doctor  or  any   doctor.
Applicant no  longer believes that he  will ever  use  an  illegal drug  again because  he  has
his shoulder pain  under control with  medications, when  needed.  He also  reaffirmed  his
denial of  the  allegation  regarding  future  intent  to  use  illegal drugs. (Tr. at 47, 50-51, 56-
60.)
During closing argument, Applicant and I engaged in a lengthy discussion about
his failure to provide a signed statement pursuant to AG ¶ 20(b)(3) that set forth both his
intent to abstain from using illegal drugs in the future and an acknowledgment that any
future  drug  use  by  him  would  be  grounds  for  the  revocation  of  his  national  security
eligibility.  He  said  he  did  not  submit  such  a  statement  because  he  expected  the
Government to provide him with an appropriate form for that purpose. After the hearing,
he provided a signed statement of his intent to abstain from any future drug use. He also
wrote: “Additionally, I do understand that these infractions are grounds for revocations of
security clearances issued by the U.S. government.” (Tr. at 105-111; AE C.)
Paragraph 2, Guideline M, Use of Information Technology
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in the one subparagraph of the
SOR under this guideline. The specific facts regarding this allegation are as follows:
2.a  –  Purchase and use in August 2015 of an external USB WiFi card –
Applicant answered the following question in his SCA in the affirmative:
Section 27- Use of Information Technology Systems
Unauthorized Access
In  the  last  seven  (7)  years  have  you  illegally  or  without  proper
authorization accessed or attempted to access any information technology
system?
In response to the follow-up questions in his SCA, Applicant disclosed that in August 2015
he “purchased an external USB WiFi card while at Defcon [sic] and have been learning
how to use Kali Linux.”
At his 2016 Interview, Applicant discussed  the above admission in his SCA. He
stated that in addition to the two items described, he also purchased a directional antenna.
He  said  that  these  items  are  typically  used  to  break  into  password-protected  wireless
internet networks. The antenna can be aimed to receive WiFi signals as far away as two
miles. He explained that Kali Linux is software used to overcome password protection on
WiFi  systems.  He  admitted  that  the  unauthorized  entry  of  a  secure  computer  system
would be a violation of law. He has never tried to access the WiFi system of a corporate
computer system.  He has  only attempted  to  enter WiFi  systems  that  appear to  him  to
belong to individuals. He believed that entering the network of a private party would be a
lesser violation of secularity restrictions. In response to a separate question in DOHA’s
interrogatories, he acknowledged as correct the following statement:
1. In  August 2015, you  purchased  an  external USB  WiFi card and  have  used
it at  various [he  corrected  the  word “various” by  inserting  “1 (one)”]  locations
attempting to break into password protected  wireless internet networks.
He then advised that his attempts  using his hacking equipment  were never successful
and that his last attempt was made in August 2015. (GE 2 at 15-16, 24.)
Applicant also reported in his 2016 Interview that he has taken the equipment to
parties at homes of his friends and has allowed them to use the equipment. He said he
does not recall if any of his friends were able to enter a secure WiFi network, but he was
not certain of that. (GE 2 at 15.)
In his October 21, 2019 responses to DOHA’s interrogatories, Applicant was given
the  opportunity  to  correct  any  errors  in  the  reports  summarizing  his  2016  and  2019
Interviews. He made a few minor corrections, but made no changes to the portions of the
2016 Interview report summarized above. He then affirmed that the interview summaries
attached to the Interrogatories were accurate as corrected and adopted the statements.
He signed his interrogatory responses before a Notary Public. (GE 2 at 4, 25-26
At the hearing, Applicant provided extensive testimony about  his involvement in
DEFCON  and  his purchase  and  use of  the hacking  equipment.  Applicant  and  his wife
have attended an annual IT security conference call DEFCON since 2010 or 2011. They
became  volunteer  staff  members  of  DEFCON  in  about  2015.  The  conference  is  an
important  venue  for  IT  security  professionals  to  stay  current  on  developments  in  their
field.  (Tr. at 29-33.)
Applicant  testified  that  in  2015,  at  the  DEFCON  conference  in  Las  Vegas,  he
purchased an external USB WiFi card, which gets plugged into a computer and can be
used to identify WiFi networks available in the area for connection. He explained that all
computers and phones use an internal WiFi card to perform this function. The external
card he bought not only has a USB connection to connect to a computer, it also has an
antenna port that is used to connect to an external antenna. That is the only difference of
the external WiFi card he purchased. The card he purchased came with an antenna. As
a staff member of DEFCON, he purchased the equipment at a discounted price. With the
addition  of  an  antenna,  he  is  able  to  conduct  a  directional  search  for  available  WiFi
networks.  He  testified  that  he  purchased  the  equipment  for  “continuing  education.”
Quoting  Sun  Tzu,  he  wanted  to  “know  thy  enemy,”  meaning  that  he  wanted  to  better
understand the capabilities of hackers who use this type of hacking equipment to break
into computer networks. He wanted to use the hacking equipment to see if he could gain
access  to  password  protected  networks.  To  get  through  a  password  protection  WiFi
network, he  needed  to download  a  “suite” of software called  Kali Linux and  use  one  of
the programs in the suite. (Tr. at 62-71.)
Applicant  explained  that  he  was  never  successful  hacking  into  a  password
protected network with his hacking tools and software. In the process of trying, he was
learning  how  the  tools  work.  He  blamed  his  lack  of  success  on  his  lack  of  expertise
working  with  Linux  software.  He  attempted  to  use  the  tools  at  his  apartment  after  the
conference. The antenna had a stated range of two miles, but Applicant explained that
the quality of the data transmission was poor at longer distances. His next-door neighbor’s
WiFi  network  would  certainly  be  within  reach  of  the  antenna  and  software.  He  initially
claimed he used the hacking tools over a day or two, but then he immediately modified
this statement saying he limited his use to one time for 30-45 minutes before dinner time.
When asked if he had used the hacking equipment since that time, he responded: “Not
to my recollection.” He also limited the target networks into which he sought to gain entry.
He  testified  that  he  only  “picked  something  that  said  ‘guest.’”  Subsequently,  Applicant
tried to explain what he meant by the word “guest” as something different than a business
owned and managed WiFi system. In his post-hearing submission, he repeated his claim
that he only “selected for testing networks containing ‘Guest’ in their SSID [Service Set
Identifier  or  wireless  network  name],”  and  he  did  “not  believe  .  .  .  [that]  would  be
considered  problematic.”  He  also  repeated  his  position  that  his activities  were  merely
self-education in matters “that are used for nefarious activities.”  He was simply “striving
to maintain a sufficient level of education to improve this facet of my IT responsibilities.”
(Tr. at 72-76, 78, 86-90, 93; AE A at 1.)
Applicant  also  testified  that  his  self-education  with  the  hacking  equipment  was
never a part of any work-related project for his employer. He explained that he is “not part
of that team” that works on accessing password-protected WiFi networks. When asked if
he  understood  the  Government’s  security  concerns  regarding  the  illegality  of  trying  to
access  password-protected  networks  without  authorization,  Applicant  responded,  “I
understand that there is verbiage about it.” When asked if he has any aspirations to be a
hacker, he responded:
“Hacker”  is a  lot  of  different terms  . . .  Everyone is a hacker if  you think
about it. You know, you talk - - at Starbucks, you talk somebody into giving
you, Hey, can you give me an extra shot of espresso, Matt, would you? That
type of thing is hacking.
(Tr. at 80-82.)
Applicant  also  testified  that  most  of  his friends  who  work  in  IT  positions  are  far
more knowledgeable than he is with respect to security matters. He agreed that he “may
have taken [the hacking tools] to a get-together [with his IT friends] once . . . I don’t know
if anyone used it or not.” He then testified “I’m going to assume no one picked it up and
messed with it.” (Tr. at 76-77.)
Applicant was asked if he agrees that accessing password-protected networks is
illegal. He responded as follows:
I would imagine there is something written somewhere about it. As I am not
a lawyer for the EFF [Electronic Frontier Foundation], I can’t be much more
specific than that.
He also testified that he sought to limit the targets of his attempted hacking activity. He
said:
I don’t know what the rules are about networks that are labeled as “guest”
that  are  intended  for  guest  access,  that  are  segregated  from  internal
corporate  network  that  actually  contain  pertinent  business  and  financial
data . . . Thus, my decision to pick something that said “guest.”
(Tr. at 77-78.)
Whole-Person Evidence
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided  four  character  letters,  which  have  been
marked collectively as AE B. They describe him as trustworthy, dependable, loyal, and a
good friend. His references believe that he is highly professional and a person of integrity.
His performs high-quality work and receives outstanding annual reviews. His most recent
character letter is dated April 2, 2018, from his supervisor at the time. He also produced
a  November  2017  report  from  the  FBI  that  stated  that  it  found  no  record  of  Applicant
having ever been arrested. (AE B at 1-5.)
The   subject   line   of   the   April  2,   2018   character  reference   letter  reads:
“Recommendation   for  military   discharge   characterization   upgrade   for  [Applicant].”  The
conclusion of  the letter in the penultimate paragraph states:
Given  his drive  for excellence  and  superb character, it is  my  professional
recommendation
[Applicant]   have   his  military   discharge
characterization  upgraded  to Honorable.”
that
Applicant provided no evidence as to whether his discharge upgrade petition was granted.
(AE B at 5.)
Applicant testified at length that he has a unique set of skill sets that makes him a
valuable  member of  his  employer’s  team.  Most  of  his colleagues are  experts in  Linux,
while  Applicant  has  a  different  expertise  making  his  skillset  unique.  Much  of  his
technology knowledge is self-taught. (Tr. at 30-34.)
",False
"Applicant  is  a  24-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance for the first time. (Exhibit 3 at Section 25) He is employed as a junior software
developer  for  a  company  doing  business  in  the  defense  industry.  He  has  had  this  job
since  about  January  2020.  Before  that,  he  was  enrolled  as  a  full-time  college  student
during  2015-2019,  which  resulted  in  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  December  2019.  He  has
never married and has no children.
Applicant  disclosed  a  history  of  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse  in  his
February  2020  security  clearance  application.  (Exhibit  5  at  Section  23)  His  drug  of
choice was marijuana, for which he reported the following details: (1) he used marijuana
with  varying  frequency,  from  daily  to  taking  extended  breaks  in  use,  from  about  May
2015 to January 2020; and (2) he sold marijuana to close friends while he was a college
student  during  2016-2018  for  two  brief  periods.  In  addition  to  marijuana,  he  reported
using the prescription drug Adderall without a prescription during 2015-2018. He did so
to help him stay up late to study. He also reported three to four instances of cocaine use
during 2015-2019, and a single use of LSD in 2016.
In addition to his substance misuse, Applicant disclosed a police record involving
marijuana. (Exhibit 3 at Section 22) He was arrested  for driving under the influence of
alcohol  (DUI)  and  possession  of  less  than  10  grams  of  marijuana  in  August  2018.  He
noted that both offenses resulted in suspended imposition of sentence in August 2019.
As I understand it, a suspended imposition of sentence is typically used in this particular
state for first-time offenders who  plead  guilty and  are  then placed on  probation. Along
with probation, the court required him to serve 40 hours of community service, complete
two educational courses, attend a victim-impact panel, and pay a fine.
Applicant provided additional details  about his marijuana  involvement during his
background  investigation.  (Exhibit  4)  Of  note,  in  a  May  2020  interview,  he  admitted
using marijuana about a week before the interview. He also admitted  buying marijuana
one  to  two  times  monthly  while  a  college  student.  Concerning  his  2018  arrest,  he
explained  that  he  was  placed  on  unsupervised  probation  for  two  years  (until  about
August 2021) and paid $600 in fines. He noted the arrest was a life-changing event for
him  because  it  was  a  wakeup  call  to  stop  being  stupid  and  focus  on  his  life  and  his
future.
In reply to written interrogatories, Applicant admitted continued use of marijuana.
(Exhibit  4)  He  stated  that  his  frequency  of  use  was  monthly,  and  that  his  last  use  of
marijuana  was  November  14,  2020,  which  was  the  month  before  he  answered  the
interrogatories.  Concerning  his  2018  arrest,  he  stated  that  he  was  still  serving
unsupervised probation.
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant wrote that he did not believe that the matters
in the SOR reflected who he is, his trustworthiness, his alignment with national security,
and  his  job  performance.  He  described  his  successes  at  work,  and  that  he  is  also
working to overcome the mistakes of his youth.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
1  Department  of  the  Navy   v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no
right to a security clearance).
2 484 U.S. at 531.
3 484 U.S. at 531.
followed   the   Court’s  reasoning,  and   a   judge’s  findings  of  fact  are   reviewed   under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.6  An
Applicant  is  responsible  for  presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or
mitigate  facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.7  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8
Discussion
Under Guideline H for drug involvement  and substance misuse, the  concern as
set forth in AG ¶ 24 is that:
[t]he   illegal  use   of  controlled   substances,  to   include   the   misuse   of
prescriptions and  non-prescription  drugs, and  the  use  of  other substances
that   cause   physical  or  mental  impairment   or  are   used  in  a   manner
inconsistent  with   their   intended   purpose,  can   raise   questions  about  an
individual’s  reliability   and   trustworthiness,  both   because   such   behavior
may   lead   to   physical  or  psychological  impairment  and   because   it  raises
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply  with laws, rules,
and regulations. . .  .
In addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of  National Intelligence
(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws
prohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state
can authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances
Act,  which  identifies  marijuana  as  a  Schedule  I  controlled  drug.  Second,  changes  to
state  laws  (and  the  laws  of  the  District  of  Columbia)  concerning marijuana  use  do  not
alter  the  national  security  adjudicative  guidelines.  And  third,  a  person’s  disregard  of
federal  law  concerning  the  use,  sale,  or  manufacture  of  marijuana  remains  relevant
when making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse;
4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.14.
7 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
8 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
AG  ¶   25(c)   illegal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  including
cultivation,  processing,  manufacture,  purchase,  sale,  or  distribution;  or
possession of drug paraphernalia;
AG ¶  25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance
misuse,  or failure  to  clearly  and  convincingly  commit  to  discontinue  such
misuse;
AG  ¶   26(a)  the   behavior  happened   so   long   ago,  was  so   infrequent,  or
happened  under such  circumstances that it is  unlikely  to  recur or does not
cast  doubt  on   the   individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or   good
judgment; and
AG  ¶   26(b) the  individual acknowledges  his or her drug involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including  but  not
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)
changing  or  avoiding  the  environment  where  drugs  were  used;  and  (3)
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility.
The  SOR  allegations  under  Guideline  H  are  established.  The  evidence  shows
that  Applicant  has  an  extensive  and  recent  history  of  marijuana  use  (2015-2020).  In
particular,  I  note  his  continued  marijuana  use  after  submitting  his  February  2020
security  clearance  application  and  while  his  case  was  pending  adjudication.  He  was
using  marijuana  within  a  week  of  his  May  2020  interview.  Thereafter,  he  continued
using  marijuana,  monthly,  with  his  last  known  usage  occurring  in  November  2020.
Given his continued use of marijuana as recently as 2020, I conclude Applicant failed to
clearly and convincing commit to discontinue such misuse.
I  have  considered  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  involvement  with  marijuana  and  his
other substance misuse as outlined in the findings of fact. It includes using marijuana for
more than five years and as recently as about November 2020. The latter fact means he
smoked  marijuana  during  his  employment  with  a  federal  contractor  engaged  in  the
defense industry. Any illegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a person’s
security  worthiness,  but  it  is  particularly  egregious  if  it  occurs  during  the  course  of
employment with a federal contractor. Furthermore, it is likely that his marijuana use in
2020 was in violation of his employer’s drug-free workplace policy.9
Applicant’s case in mitigation is not persuasive. The one item that stands out in
his favor is his candor and willingness to disclose his drug involvement and substance
misuse during the security clearance process. But the credit in mitigation is limited due
to his continued marijuana use after completing his 2020 security clearance application.
9  ISCR Case No. 16-00578 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2017) at 2 (noting the Drug-Free Workplace Act requires
federal contractors with a contract over $100,000 to establish certain drug-free workplace policies).
I  also  considered  the  two  mitigating  conditions  noted  above.  Neither  applies  in
Applicant’s  favor.  His  marijuana  use  occurred  over  a  period  of  years  and  is  recent
enough  to be of  concern.  It also occurred  while  his security clearance application was
pending.  The  latter  circumstance  cannot  be  overlooked,  ignored,  or  explained  away.
With that said, I am less concerned about his more limited substance misuse involving
cocaine, LSD, and Adderall. That misuse was relatively infrequent and appears to have
run its course while Applicant was a college student. On this basis, I find for  Applicant
on  those  allegations.  Otherwise,  the  evidence  is  not  sufficient  to  mitigate  the  drug-
related security concern.
Under  Guideline  J  for  criminal  conduct,  the  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be
questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  involvement  with
criminal conduct. The overall concern as  set forth in AG  ¶ 30  is aptly put:  “By  its  very
nature, [criminal conduct]  calls into  question  a  person’s ability  or willingness to  comply
with laws, rules, and regulations.”
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶  31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an
admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of
whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;
AG ¶  31(c) individual is currently on parole or probation;
AG  ¶   32(a)  so   much   time   has  elapsed   since   the   criminal  behavior
happened,  or  it  happened   under  such   unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is
unlikely   to   recur  and   does   not  cast   doubt   on   the   individual’s  reliability,
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and
AG ¶  32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not
limited  to,  the  passage  of  time  without  recurrence  of  criminal  activity,
restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or
higher  education,  good  employment  record,  or  constructive  community
involvement.
The  SOR  allegation  under  Guideline  J  is  established.  The  key  facts  are  not  in
dispute.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  August  2018  for  the  misdemeanor  offenses  of  DUI
and possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana. About a year later in August 2019,
he  pleaded  guilty  and  received  a  disposition  that  is  typically  given  for  first-time
offenders. He states that he satisfied the various terms and conditions imposed by the
court,  and  it  would  appear  that  his  term  of  unsupervised  probation  ended  in  about
August 2021, a few months ago.
Nevertheless,  the  evidentiary  record  here  creates  much  uncertainty.  First,
Applicant  continued  using  marijuana  while  serving  probation,  which  is  troubling.
Second, he did not provide documentary proof that he successfully completed his term
of  probation  and  that  his  criminal  case  is  now  closed.  The  lack  of  documentary  proof
provides  additional  reasons  to  be  uncertain.  Third,  his  continued  use  of  marijuana
during 2020, after completing his security clearance application, means I cannot safely
exclude  the  possibility  that  he may  again face  arrest and  prosecution  for a  marijuana-
related offense. The evidence  is not sufficient  to mitigate the criminal conduct security
concern.
The  Guideline  E  matters  consist  of  a  sole  allegation  that  is  merely  a  cross-
allegation  to  the  various  matters  under  Guidelines  H  and  J,  adding  nothing  of  factual
substance to the case. The judgment, honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness concerns
under  Guideline  E  are  implicitly  if  not  directly  at  issue  under  Guidelines  H  and  J.
Accordingly,  the  Guideline  E  matters  are  decided  against  Applicant  under  the  same
rationale set forth under Guidelines H and J. Additional discussion is unnecessary.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent standard, I have  doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good   judgment,  and   ability   to   protect
classified   or  sensitive   information.   In   reaching   this  conclusion,  I  weighed   the   evidence
as  a   whole  and   considered   if   the   favorable  evidence   outweighed   the   unfavorable
evidence  or vice versa. I also considered  the whole-person  concept.  In  particular, I gave
weight to  Applicant’s  relative  youth  and  inexperience  in  the  ways of the  world, but  those
matters  are  outweighed   by   his  continued   marijuana   use   while   his  security   clearance
application   was  pending.  I  conclude   that  he   has  not   met  his  ultimate   burden   of
persuasion   to   show   that  it  is  clearly   consistent  with   the   national  interest   to   grant   him
eligibility for access to  classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline  H:

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.a. (Item 2) He
also  provided  mitigating  information.  Applicant’s  admission  is  accepted  as  a  finding  of

Applicant  is  29  years  old,  and  he  has  worked  for  defense  contractors  as  a
mechanical engineer or as an associate member staff engineer since December 2014.
(Item 3 at 7, 16-19) In 2014, he was awarded a bachelor’s degree, and since 2016, he
has been participating in a post-graduate education program. (Id. at 15-16) He has not
served  in  the  military.  (Id.  at  25)  He  is  not  married,  and  he  has  been  in  a  cohabitant
relationship since 2018. (Id. at 27) He does not have any children. (Id. at 28)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in March 2019 Applicant used marijuana twice while granted
access to classified information. (Item 1) In his December 8, 2014 SCA, Applicant said
he used marijuana about once a month during his first two years of college, and his most
recent marijuana use was during Hurricane Sandy  (October 22 to November 2, 2012).
(Item 4 at 37) He did not hold a security clearance when he used marijuana in 2012. (Id.)
In his 2014 SCA, he said:
I do  not  plan on using  this drug because  since  then  I  have  removed  myself
from   that   environment   and   no   longer  feel  attracted   to   partaking   in  that
behavior. I have  realized  that  some  of the  decisions I  have  made  in the  past
can negatively affect my future and  my capacity to work. (Id.)
On  March  31,  2015,  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator
interviewed  Applicant.  (Item  6)  His  2015  OPM  interview  was  consistent  with  his  2014
SCA. His only illegal drug use involved his use of marijuana. (Id. at 7) The OPM summary
of interview states, “[Applicant] has no intention of any future [illegal] drug use. He is not
interested in future drug use, and he realizes that using drugs can negatively affect his
future and his capacity to work.” (Id.)
In his June 7, 2019 SCA, Applicant said that he used marijuana from November
2010 to October 2012 about once a month during his first two years in college. (Item 3 at
44-45)  He  did  not  use  marijuana  from  2012  until  March  2019.  (Id.  at  45)  He  used
marijuana twice in March 2019 while he held a security clearance while “in a social setting
after having a few drinks with some college friends who were visiting from out of state.”
(Id.)  He  does  not  continue  to  associate  with  the  college  friends  with  whom  he  used
marijuana. (Id.) He said:
I  do   not   intend   to   use   this  drug   in  the   future   because   I  consider  this  an
isolated  instance  and  I  would like  to  note  that I am  not  a  habitual user by
any means. I am  extremely remorseful of the  choice that I  made  and it was
a complete lapse  of judgement. (Id.)
On  August  21,  2019,  an  OPM  investigator  interviewed  Applicant.  (Item  5)  His
interview about Applicant’s marijuana use was consistent with his 2019 SCA. (Id. at 9) He
said he does not intend to use marijuana in the future, and he does not associate with the
people who used marijuana with him in 2019. (Id.) He has not tested positive for use of
illegal drugs. (Id.) His 2019 marijuana use was while he held a security clearance. (Id.)
In his SOR response, Applicant described his 2019 marijuana use as “an isolated
event,”  and  a  “lapse  of  judgement.”  (Item  2)  He  observed  that  recreational  use  of
marijuana  in  his  state is not  prohibited by state  law.  (Id.) In  July 2020, he moved  to  a
different state. (Id.) He promised to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, and not to
use marijuana in the future. (Id.)
In  his  FORM  response,  Applicant  expressed  remorse  for  his  marijuana  use  in
2019. (FORM) On September 17, 2021, he provided a hair sample for testing, and the
results from a hair follicle drug screen indicating no use of illegal drugs. (Id.) He said:
[H]e  was unhappy with [his] career and  felt there were limited  opportunities
for growth. [H]e  was uncertain  whether [he]  wanted  to  continue  working  as
an  Engineer for a  Federal Contractor . . .  and  [he] was planning  on  pursuing
a   career  in  real  estate   investing   which  meant  [he]  would  no   longer  need
access to classified information. (Id. at 1)
He subsequently decided to continue working as an engineer for a federal contractor. He
is  passionate  about  his  current  employment,  and  he  has  abandoned  his  idea  about  a
career in real estate. (Id.) He proposed marriage; he is working on his master’s degree;
he does not associate with marijuana users; and he endeavors to be the best possible
employee. (Id. at 1-2)
Applicant’s  manager,  coworkers,  and  friends  described  him  as  professional,
innovative,  diligent,  honest,  trustworthy,  loyalty,  mature,  knowledgeable,  and  reliable.
(FORM) They did not observe Applicant’s impairment at work. (Id.) He is an asset to his
employer. (Id.) He received an annual pay raise of over $4,000 on May 25, 2021. (Id.) He
received excellent performance evaluations. (Id.)

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b without further comment. His admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 32  years old.  He has never married  and  he  has no  children. (Item  4
at  26)  He   graduated   from   high   school  in   2008,   and   earned   his  bachelor’s  degree   in
2011.  He  continued   his  academic  studies for several years after that   (2011-2015),  but
did not earn an advanced degree. (Item  4 at 14-15; Item 5 at 11)
While  continuing  his  education,  Applicant  worked  various  jobs,  including  as  a
research assistant (2012-2013), a self-employed engineer (2013-2014), and a graduate
teaching assistant (2014-2015) among other jobs. (Item 4 at 17-21) In May 2015, after
finishing his classes, he moved to a new state for a job in mechanical engineering. He
has worked for that employer ever since. (Item 4 at 16)
The allegations in the SOR concern Applicant’s one-time use of Adderall, without
a prescription, in March 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and his one-time use of “Molly,” while holding
a security clearance, in August 2020. (SOR ¶ 1.b).8 “Molly” is another word for Ecstasy,
or MDNA. (See https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/mdma-ecstasymolly)
Applicant  had  a  background  interview  in  April  2018,  in  which  he  discussed  his
one-time use of Adderall, in March 2013. The SCA that preceded that interview is not in
the record, on which he appears to have disclosed his Adderall use. He explained that
he was given the Adderall by a friend before they went out to a  bar. The Adderall was
not prescribed to the friend, and it was not prescribed to Applicant. (Item 5 at 5)
Applicant also disclosed this one-time use of Adderall on his next SCA, in August
2020. He said he would not use it again because “it is illegal.” (Item 4 at 38-39) He also
said that his prior clearance application had been granted, in June 2018. (Item 4 at 43)
On or about September 23, 2020, Applicant had his background interview for his
most  recent  SCA.  (Item  5  at  10)  He  confirmed  his  2013  Adderall  use,  as  previously
disclosed.  Applicant  was  then  asked  if  he  had  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been
involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. He
responded in the affirmative. He disclosed that, in late August 2020, after submitting his
SCA  earlier  that  month,  he  had  been  at  a  party  and  someone  had  offered  him  some
white powder, a drug called “Molly.” He tasted the powder by wetting his finger, dipping
it into the powder, and then licking his finger. He did this three times. (Item 5 at 15)
Applicant said he tried the drug because he was curious. He knew that he had a
security clearance at the  time, and he knew the drug was  illegal. He  acknowledged  in
the interview that he made an unwise decision. He said he was offered another chance
to use the powder at the party but declined. (Item 5 at 15) Applicant indicated during the
interview that he will not use any drugs in the future because it is illegal and not worth
risking his job. He said he regretted his decision to use the powder and would not do it
again. (Item 5 at 15)
Applicant authenticated both of his interview summaries in January 2021, without
substantive  alterations.  (Item  5)  He  also  disclosed  both  the  Adderall  and  Molly  usage
again,  in  the  portion of  the  interrogatory regarding recent drug involvement. (Item  5 at
20)
Applicant  admitted  both  SOR  allegations  without  further  comment.  He  did  not
respond to the Government’s FORM or otherwise offer any mitigating evidence beyond
what he had previously stated.
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  48  years  old.  He  graduated  from  a  military  service  academy  and
served for 20 years, retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 2014. He earned a master’s degree
in 1999. He is divorced with two children who are 17 and 14 years old. He stated in his
answer that while on active duty he held a security clearance without incident. (Item 4)
Applicant admitted that he used marijuana every other week from approximately
2016 to July 2020. He admitted that from June 2016 to December 2017, incident to his
employment with Company A, he engaged in the  cultivation and sale of marijuana. He
admitted  that  from  October  2018  until  January  2020,  incident  to  his  employment  with
Company  B,  he  engaged  in  the  commercial  manufacture  and  sale  of  marijuana  and
marijuana products. He admitted that since June 2020, incident to his employment with
Company C, he has engaged in the commercial manufacture and sale of marijuana and
marijuana products. (Items 4, 5, 6)
Applicant primarily provided argument in his answer to the SOR and response to
the FORM stating that because cannabis is legal in the state and Canada where he used
it  and  conducted  business,  his  conduct  was  not  illegal.  He  provided  a  narrative  citing
policy memos by the federal government for not pursuing federal marijuana laws in states
that had legalized it. He provided further argument in his response to the FORM to show
that the federal government has chosen not to shut down the cannabis industry in states
where it is legal under state law. He also noted that medical marijuana is legal in 19 states.
(Item 4; AE A)
Applicant completed  his security  clearance  application  (SCA) in July  2020. During
Applicant’s  September  2020   background   interview   with   a   government  investigator  he
stated  that  he  had  not  used  marijuana  since  July  2020.  (Items 5, 6) In  his answer to  the
SOR, he stated:
I  admit  to  the  legal  consumption  of  legal  cannabis  in  small  quantities
approximately every  other  week  on  average  for  the  stated  time  period  in
U.S   jurisdictions  with   legal  adult-size   cannabis  programs  and   in  Canada
with   a   legal  adult-use   federal   program   (after   Canada   legalized   federally).
(Item  4)
Applicant has not made any statement in his answer, response to interrogatories,
or response to the FORM that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Items
4, 5, 6)
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2012. He is not married
and has no children. He has worked for the same employer, a federal contractor, since
August 2012 and held a security clearance since then. (Item 3)
In Applicant’s July 2012 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed that he
used marijuana with varying frequency from about July 2007 until August 2011. He stated:
I do  not intend  to  use  marijuana  again for a  number of  reasons. I haven’t
used  it since  last  year because  of my  wanting  to  focus on  my  last  year of
school, associated  senior design  project,  and  holding  onto  my  (then) current
employment.  Future use  is not considered because  of  the  desire  to  secure
and  maintain a security clearance  for [employer]. (Item  4)
In  July  2019,  Applicant  completed  a  new  SCA.  In  it  he  disclosed  that  he  used
marijuana from April 2015 to July 2018. He stated: “Frequency of use in previous 7 years
was infrequent and sporadic.” He further explained that marijuana was not addictive for
him. He has used it voluntarily in the past. He mostly used it vaporizing and not smoking.
He used it only in social settings. He has strong self-control, and said he had not used it
in  a  year  despite  having  it  around  him  on  multiple  occasions  and  offered  it  to  him  by
others. Over the years he has come to value his job more, which now surpasses his desire
for the psychoactive effects of marijuana use. He stated: “My responsibilities and desires
in life far surpass those of my wants to temporarily alter my state of mind. This is why I
do not foresee using marijuana in the future.” (Item 4)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated he does not sell, possess or purchase
marijuana. All of his former use was in a state where marijuana is legal so those providing
him  marijuana  were  doing  so  legally.  He  has  not  been  diagnosed  as  dependent  on
marijuana. His most recent use was July 2018. He does not intend to use marijuana in
the future because his job and career are more important to him than marijuana usage.
He noted that it had been a significant period of  time since his last marijuana use. He

explained   that  marijuana   is  a   Schedule  I  drug,  which  he   said  lends  credence   to   the
government’s willingness to  remove  it from  penalties  associated  with  drug  use. He  then
indicated   removal  as   a   scheduled   drug   from   federal  guidelines   “would  presumably
remove  marijuana   as  a   prohibitive   barrier to   security   clearance   applicants and   holders
(akin   to   alcohol  use),   provided   use   is  medicinal  in  nature  and/or  recreational  and
responsibly administered.” (Item  2)
Applicant  stated  in  his SOR  answer  that  17  states  and  the  District  of  Colombia
have  legalized  marijuana,  which  represents  the  majority  of  the  U.S.  population  and
“therefore the People’s belief that marijuana laws require a rewrite pertaining to its federal
legality  and  its  potential  for  abuse.”  He  then  said  that  he  “now  considers  the  federal
legality of the substance and therefore the severity of its use in regards to potential for his
exploitation with continued use.” (Item 2)
Applicant stated in his SOR answer that he estimated the frequency of his use from
April 2015 to July 2018 averaged less than once a month. He said that when he used
marijuana  he  took  into  account  numerous  variables  prior  to  each  engagement  with  its
use.  He  further  explained  that  what  he  failed  to  take  into  account  was  his  current
clearance status and the impact its usage would have on his status. He said during the
timeframe  he  was  using  marijuana  he  did  not  do  any  work  that  required  access  to
classified material. He said he has matured and has a “better intent” to not use marijuana
again because of his growing responsibilities on DOD contracts. (Item 2)
Applicant stated in his SOR answer that he was unaware of the potential gravity
or seriousness his infrequent use could have on national security if he was in possession
of classified material. He stated he has every intention to no longer engage in the use of
marijuana. (Item 2)

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 62 years old; he has been divorced three times and has no children.
He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1984 and a  master’s  degree in 1989. Applicant has
worked as a federal contractor since at least 2000 and has been with his current employer
since 2017. (Item 3)
Applicant has held a DoD security clearance since August 2000. In May 2010, he
completed a security clearance application (SCA) incident to his periodic reinvestigation.
In it, Applicant disclosed illegal drug use in 2002, specifically approximately 10 uses of
marijuana and one use of cocaine. He was interviewed by a government investigator in
August 2010, confirmed the drug use as disclosed, and explained that he used the drugs
while  on  a  six-month  sabbatical  in  Aruba.  In  his  adopted  summary  of  that  interview,
Applicant  denied  any  drug  use  since  2002,  citing  his  concerns  about  the  legal
ramifications and the potential impact on his security clearance. He stated his intent not
to use drugs in the future, citing again to his concern regarding his security clearance. His
clearance was adjudicated favorably. (Items 3, 4, 5)
In October 2017, Applicant completed another SCA. In it, he again disclosed the
drug use in Aruba. Additionally, he disclosed “random and rare use of marijuana” between
January 2012 and July 2016, estimating that he used marijuana fewer than five times and
acknowledging that he held a security clearance at the time. Applicant noted his intent
not to use marijuana in the future, stating: “[t]he legal and professional risks are too great.
Marijuana use is simply not that important to me.” (Item 3)
In September 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. In the
adopted summary of  that  interview,  he  confirmed use of  marijuana  between  2012 and
2016, estimated that he used no more than ten times, and explained that all uses took
place  with  a  friend  who  was  using  marijuana  for  medicinal  purposes.  Applicant  used
marijuana provided by his friend and only in his friend’s home. He acknowledged that he
was in his mid-50s on these occasions and cited to immaturity. Applicant stated that he
had not used any drugs in three or four years and that he did not intend to use in the
future because the risks were too great. (Items 3, 5)
The one incident of cocaine use in 2002 that Applicant disclosed is not alleged. I
have  not  considered  this  conduct  for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  consider  it  in
applying mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis.

"Applicant is a 40-year-old man with one child, age 9. Applicant was married twice
previously. Both marriages ended in divorce. (Item 1 at 17-19) He earned a high school
diploma in 2000, and he earned an associate’s degree in 2005. (Item 1 at 12-13) He has
been working for a defense contractor as a technical product designer since 2005. (Item 1
at 13) He has never held a security clearance. (Item 1 at 31)
Applicant used marijuana, on average, once every other year from approximately
1998 to 2018. (Item 5 at 3) He typically used it at concerts with friends or at the homes of
acquaintances.  (Item  4  at  29-30;  Item 5) He has not used marijuana since May 2018.
(Items 3-4) In November 2019, he executed a statement of intent to not use marijuana
again. (Item 5 at 15)
The SOR alleges six debts totaling approximately $11,000. Applicant incurred them
between 2012 and 2015. (Items 4-10)
The  debt alleged  in subparagraph  2.a  is a  delinquent phone  bill  for $337.  (Item  3  at
3)  It stems from a cell phone call that his former stepdaughter made  when  she  lived  with
him.  Applicant  initially   disputed   the   bill,  contending   that  the   phone   company   errantly
charged   a   long-distance   rate   for the   phone   call,  bypassing   a   local cell   phone   tower in
violation  of  Federal Communications Commission  regulations. (Item  5  at 3) By  the  date  of
Applicant’s answer in January  2021, he  had  concluded  that it was less expensive to pay
this bill than  to  contest it in court. (Item  3  at 3) He provided  no  evidence  that he  has either
paid this bill or arranged a payment plan.
Subparagraph 2.b, totaling $170, is a delinquent medical bill. (Item 3 at 3) Applicant
contends that the health care provider overcharged him, and that he met his deductible.
(Item 3 at 3) He referenced an explanation of benefits form substantiating his contention,
but did not submit the form into the record.
Subparagraph 2.c, totaling $82, is owed to a collection agent. In Applicant’s answer,
he stated that he would pay this bill within a month. (Item 1 at 2) He provided no proof of
payment.
Applicant incurred the bill alleged in subparagraph 2.d, totaling $232, when his then
wife  took  their  daughter  to  the  emergency  room.  While  the  hospital  was  checking  her
daughter into their system, Applicant’s then wife called him for their insurance information.
He told her that the emergency room was an out-of-network health provider, and to take
their  daughter  to  a  nearby  hospital  that  was  in-network.  Applicant’s  then  wife  obliged,
leaving before their daughter had received treatment or finished checking in. (Item 3 at 3)
Applicant received a  $232 bill from the out-of-network hospital even though his daughter
had not received treatment or finished checking in. His insurance carrier would not provide
partial reimbursement because his daughter had not received service. The hospital that
billed him refused to negotiate a resolution. (Item 3 at 3)  The bill remains outstanding.
Applicant provided no documentation of any attempts to satisfy or resolve this bill.
Subparagraph 2.e, totaling $129, is a utility disconnect fee Applicant incurred after
his home was destroyed by a fire in approximately 2016. (Item 3 at 4) Applicant contends
that  he  should  not  have  been  charged  this  fee  because  no  disconnect  services  were
provided, as the electric meter melted during the fire. (Item 3 at 4) Applicant provided no
record of any attempts to satisfy or resolve this debt.
Subparagraph 2.f, totaling $10,013, is a property tax delinquency for the property
that Applicant owned before he purchased his current home. (Item 1 at 2) This debt was
satisfied after the property was sold at auction. (Item 3 at 5-8) It is unclear from the record
whether this was the house that was destroyed by the fire in 2016.

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant self-reported past marijuana use on his January 29, 2019 SF-86 during
his  periodic  security  clearance  renewal.  (GE  1)  He  was  subsequently  interviewed  on
May 23, 2019, by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator regarding his
marijuana  use.  (GE  2)  He  elaborated  on  his  marijuana  use  in  his  April  14,  2020  SOR
Answer as well as during his testimony. The following summarizes that drug use.
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that from approximately June 2003 through at least December
2018, Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency; and SOR ¶ 1.b
alleged  that  Applicant  continued  to  purchase  and  use  marijuana  after  he  had  been
granted a DOD security clearance in March 2009.
In his SOR Answer, Applicant stated that he did not remember exactly what year
he  first  used  marijuana.  His  best  estimate  is  that  he  first  used  marijuana  sometime
between  2003  and  2005,  which  was  between  15  and  17  years  from  the  time  he
submitted  his  SOR  Answer.  He  used  marijuana  approximately  two  or  three  times  per
year, if that, until 2018 when his marijuana use increased to approximately one to two
times  per  month  for  a  short  period.  His  increased  marijuana  use  in  2018  came  about
when recreational marijuana use became legal in his state of residence. He stated that
he was under the mistaken belief that its use was acceptable at the federal level as well.
Applicant acknowledged his marijuana use was “extremely improvident” and added that
he has no intention to ever use marijuana or any other drug again. Applicant’s testimony
was  consistent  with  his January  29,  2019  SF-86  and  his SOR Answer.  (SOR  Answer;
Tr. 19-22; GE 1; AE 1(Q))
Applicant  used  marijuana  for  “recreational  use”  and  for  its  “relaxing  capabilities
every  now  and  then.”  Applicant  added  that  he  used  marijuana  about  20  times  while
holding  a  clearance  from  March  2009  to  December  2018,  further  adding  that  that
number was “just a guess.” He acknowledged that his marijuana use was a violation of
state  and  Federal  law,  security  clearance  regulations,  and  his  employer’s  drug-free
workplace policy. Applicant volunteered that his marijuana use was a “poor choice.” (Tr.
24-26)
The  driving  force  behind  Applicant’s  decision  to  quit  using  marijuana  occurred
when he was renewing his security clearance application in December 2018. He stated,
“it  really  dawned  on  me  I  shouldn’t  have  done  it,  and  it  was  a  poor  choice.”  Applicant
has  used  marijuana  with  his  wife.  His  wife  still  uses  marijuana,  which  is  legal  in  their
state of residence. Applicant stated that even though he has been around individuals to
include his wife who use marijuana, he is not tempted to use it anymore. (GE 2; Tr. 26-
29,  33-35)  Applicant  stated,  “trustworthiness  is  one  of  the  most  important  parts  of
having  a  Security  Clearance.  You  don’t  want  someone  that  lies.  .  .  .  You  make
mistakes, you’ve got to own up to it. So, that’s why I’m here.” (Tr. 57)
During Applicant’s March 2, 2009 OPM interview, he told the investigator that he
“stopped (using marijuana) in 2007 because the use no longer appealed to him and he
wanted to start a career.” (GE 4; Tr. 29-30)
Personal Conduct
The  concerns  identified  under  this  Guideline  are  listed  as  two  separate
allegations and discussed in order as indicated in the SOR.
The  Government  cross-alleged  the  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse
concern alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b under SOR ¶ 2.a. Additionally, the SOR alleged
that Applicant falsified his December 29, 2008 SF-86 when he disclosed marijuana use
from  November  2005  through  July  2007,  and  purportedly  failed  to  disclose  his
continuing use of marijuana as set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a.
Applicant denied falsifying his December 2008 SF-86. He explained that when he
completed his December 2008 SF-86, he was not using marijuana and had not done so
since  July  2007.  He  emphasized  the  information  he  provided  on  his  December  2008
SF-86 was accurate, as he was not using marijuana at that time. (SOR Answer; Tr. 22-
24) Apparently, the confusion over the “continuing use” question arose when Applicant
submitted his January 29, 2019 SF-86 and estimated his marijuana use as June 2003 to
June 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 24)
Character Evidence
Applicant called one character witness (CW) to testify on his behalf, a technical
director  and  co-worker  he  has  known  since  2013.  CW  has  held  a  clearance  since
approximately 1985. CW provided a favorable professional and personal assessment of
Applicant.  She  stated  among  other  things  that  Applicant  is  trustworthy,  loyal,  and  she
has no reason to question his ability to hold a security clearance. CW did concede on
cross-examination  that  following  the  law,  rules,  regulations,  and  company  policy  is  an
important part of holding a  security clearance. CW acknowledged that  Applicant made
mistakes  and  errors  in  judgment.  That  said,  she  noted  that  he  self-reported  his
marijuana  use  and  based  on  her first-hand  knowledge  of  him  believes  that  he  will  not
repeat those mistakes. CW also submitted a reference letter. (AE 1(P); Tr. 36-48)
Applicant  submitted  performance  reviews  covering  the  years  2017  to  2020,
numerous  professional  certificates  and  awards,  and  six  reference  letters.  The
cumulative  nature  of  this  evidence  documents  that  Applicant  has  excelled  in  his
professional capacity and in that capacity has contributed to the national defense. He is
technically competent, well liked, trusted, and respected by his peers and management.

Guideline H:  Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  has  an  extensive  history  of  illegal  drug  involvement  and  substance
misuse,  including  two  narcotic-related  arrests.  His  illegal  drug  use  includes  cocaine,
marijuana, and crystal methamphetamine, at various times, beginning in about January
1987, and continuing until November 2017.  He has also purchased cocaine from about
May 2007 to November 2017.
In April 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of a Narcotic
Controlled Substance.  Applicant cannot recall the particulars of this arrest and charge,
but he does not deny that it occurred.
In  January  2005,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  Possession  of  a
Narcotic  Controlled  Substance.  Applicant  explained  that  he  was  in  possession  of
paraphernalia and not drugs.  Applicant was with his girlfriend, and was driving a truck
with no license plates.  He took his girlfriend out to dinner, and on the way home they
were stopped by the police.  Applicant gave the officer permission to search the truck,
and  they  found  a  “bullet,”  a  plastic paraphernalia  storage  device,  shaped  like  a  bullet,
that is used to store narcotics.  Applicant stated that he does not know why it was in his
vehicle, since at the time, he was clean and sober.  The officer also found a baggie with
cocaine  in  it.  Applicant  was  arrested.  Applicant  pled  no  contest  to  the  charge  of
Possession  of  a  Narcotic.  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  pay  court  cost,  fines,  and
complete  community  service,  attend  Narcotic  Anonymous  meetings,  and
take
substance abuse courses through a court-required program.
In  October  2017,  Applicant  failed  a  random  drug  test  administered  by  his  then
employer.  The results of the test were positive for cocaine.  As a result, Applicant was
terminated  from  his  employment.
(Government  Exhibit  2,  and  Tr.  pp.  34  and  43.)
Applicant  states  that  he  has  no  intentions  of  ever  using  any  illegal  drug  in  the  future.
(Government Exhibit 1.)
Guideline J:   Criminal Conduct
Applicant’s  history  of  criminal  conduct  creates  doubt  about  his  judgment,
It  also  calls  into  question  his  ability  or  willingness  to
reliability,  and  trustworthiness.
comply with laws, rules, and regulations.
In  addition  to  his  illegal  drug  involvement,  Applicant  has  an  extensive  criminal
history involving a number of alcohol-related arrests.
In  about  March  2001,  Applicant  was  arrested  the  first  time  and  charged  with
Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol/Drugs  (DUI.)  Applicant  was  convicted  and
sentenced to three years probation.
In  about  September  2006,  Applicant  was  arrested  a  second  time  and  charged
with DUI.  Applicant had been out with his girlfriend, shooting pool and drinking.  As they
left  the  bar,  Applicant did  not  have  his  seatbelt  on.  As  he  drove  away  from  the  stop
light, he was pulled over by the police.  The officer smelled alcohol on Applicant’s breath
and administered the field sobriety test and the breathalyzer.  Applicant failed the tests
and was arrested and taken into custody.  At court, Applicant pled no contest, and was
sentenced to pay court cost, fines, and placed on probation for 36 months.
In about September 2012, Applicant was arrested  a third time and charged with
Hit and Run, Property Damage.  Applicant had been consuming beer at a local bar for
about five hours prior to the car accident that led to the Hit and Run, Property Damage
charge.  He got into a verbal altercation with another patron.  When he was leaving the
bar at about midnight, he was concerned that he may be followed by the individuals who
were  arguing  with  him.  As  he  left  the  bar,  Applicant  was  intoxicated  and  was  not  in
control or paying attention while driving.  Applicant side swiped a parked vehicle on the
curb.  He made it home, and had no encounter with police.  Several days passed, and
Applicant felt bad about what had happened, and decided to call the police.  Applicant
was  advised  to  make  an  in-person  report  at  the  local  police  precinct.  Applicant
complied,  and  was  arrested  for  and  charged  with  Hit  and  Run,  Property  Damage.
Applicant  was  sentenced  to  pay  restitution,  was  placed  on  36  months  probation,
required  to  pay  court  costs,  and  fines,  and  required  to  do  100  hours  of  community
service.
In about December 2013, Applicant was arrested a fourth time and charged with
DUI  Alcohol/Drugs.  Applicant  had  two  beers  over  a  four  hour  period  while  at  a  car
show.  Applicant then left and went to a bar where he consumed six to seven beers over
a two hour period.  When he left the bar, he peeled out of the parking lot, and launched
into  traffic  at  an  excessive  speed,  and  was  pulled  over  by  the  police.  Applicant
underwent  a  field  sobriety  test  and  breathalyzer  and  failed.  He  was  arrested  and
charged with DUI.  In court, Applicant pled no contest, and was sentenced to 36 months
probation, required to complete 18 months of an alcohol education class, and served 3
weeks in jail.  Due to overcrowded facilities, he served  only 3 days in jail, and was let
go.  An ignition lock was placed on his vehicle.
The SOR alleges that in about March 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  DUI.  This  was  not  an  additional  arrest.  Apparently  on  this  date,  Applicant  was
convicted of the incident that occurred on December 2013.
Information  set  forth  above  under  Guideline  H  is  also  adjudicated  under  this
guideline.
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
Applicant’s history of excessive alcohol abuse leading to questionable judgment,
and  the  failure  to  control  impulses,  raises  questions  about  his  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  began  consuming  alcohol  after  graduating  from  high  school.  By  age
twenty-one  he  was  drinking  every  weekend  and  consuming  between  eight  and  twelve
beers  on  the  weekends.  Applicant  would  rarely  drink  alcohol  during  the  weekdays.
Applicant explained that he  would frequently go  “clubbing”  where he  would dance and
drink.  As  time  passed,  Applicant’s  drinking  increased  to  the  point  where  he  was
regularly  consuming  between  twelve  to  eighteen  beers  on  the  weekends.  When  his
daughter was born, he slowed his drinking down for a period, but he has never tried to
stop drinking completely.  (Tr. p. 64.)  Applicant does not believe that he has an alcohol
problem.  He explained that his goal  is to stop drinking completely, but he is not there
yet.  (Tr. pp. 61-66.)
Applicant has never attended an alcohol rehabilitation program.  He does not and
has never attended Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous voluntarily.  He has
only completed the  court ordered  alcohol education  courses  and  counseling related to
the  sentencing  imposed  by  the  court  for  his  violations.  Applicant  is  currently  working
with his pastor who is counseling him, and encouraging him to get baptized, which the
pastor believes will gradually help to improve other areas of  Applicant’s  life.  Applicant
states  that  he  no  longer  drinks  and  drives.  Now,  he  only  drinks  at  home  at  dinner.
Applicant’s  daughter  has  told  him  more  than  once  that  she  does  not  like  him  to  drink
alcohol.  She has asked him not to drink, especially on her upcoming quinceneara.  (Tr.
p. 67.)
Applicant  is  involved  in  his  church,  and  plans  to  get  deeper  into  his  faith  and
continue to improve himself.  He is embarrassed by his past misconduct.  He believes
that it has taken him some time for him to get his head straighten out.  He admits that
he has had an attitude problem.  Now, instead of abusing alcohol and drugs, he spends
time with his family.  He enjoys working on classic cars, he goes to car shows with his
brothers, and spends time with his daughter.  Applicant works a lot of overtime to stay
busy and realizes that when he stays busy, he stays out of trouble.
Information  set  forth  above  under  Guideline  J  is  also  adjudicated  under  this

"Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for

Applicant lives in a state where marijuana use is legal under state law. Marijuana,
including  medical  marijuana,  remains  a  Schedule  I  controlled  substance  and  illegal
under  federal  law.  Since  2018,  she  has  used  marijuana  for  medicinal  purposes  to

In her February 2021 response to the SOR, Applicant wrote that she intended to
continue using marijuana for medical  purposes  as long as  she needed it for medicinal
purposes,  and  it  remained  legal  under  state  law.  Department  Counsel  provided
information  in  the  FORM  that  marijuana,  even  if  legal  under  state  law,  remains  a
controlled substance and illegal under federal law.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations. His admissions in
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  employee  of  a federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high  school in  June  2008  and  attended a  community college  from  September 2008  to
January 2010, but he did not receive a degree. He worked in various non-federal jobs
until he was hired by his current employer in April 2019. He has never married and has
no children. He has never held a security clearance.
In  his  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  in  April  2011,  he  was  charged  with
misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was convicted but the charge was reduced to
possession of paraphernalia on appeal. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail (suspended),
a $200 fine, and 12 months of supervised probation. (FORM Item 3 at 33-35.)
Applicant  also disclosed  in his SCA  that he  used marijuana between  May 2017
and January 2020. He stated that he used it once in May 2017, once in August 2017, and
twice in a state where it is legal in 2018 and 2020. He stated that his recreational use of
marijuana “became less of a want for me to do” as he “furthered in [his] career.” (FORM
Item 3 at 35) In his December 2010 response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he
had not used marijuana since January 2020. (FORM Item 4 at 9.)
During  an  interview  with  a  security  investigator  on  March  12,  2020,  he  told  the
investigator  that  he  purchased  marijuana  edibles  from  a  dispensary  in  a  state  where
marijuana is legal in 2018 and in January 2020. He told the investigator that he continues
to  socialize  with  two  friends  who  continue  to  use  marijuana.  He  has  not  received  any
treatment  or  rehabilitation  for  drug  use.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  will  never  use
drugs again. (Form Item 4 at 11-12.)
In  Applicant’s  response  to  interrogatories,  he  disclosed  that  he  was  cited  on
February 29, 2020 for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and failure to signal
a turn. Adjudication was deferred, and he successfully completed a diversion program,
after which the charges were dismissed and the record sealed. Although he was charged
under  a  statute  that  encompassed  driving  under  the  influence  of  drugs,  there  is  no
evidence  that  drugs  were  involved  in  this  incident.  (FORM  Item  4  at  4-7.)  He  was  on

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, with brief narrative comments.
Although he did not answer SOR ¶ 2.a, since it is a cross-allegation of SOR ¶¶ 1.c and
1.d, I consider it admitted. Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 53 years old. He was married from 1990 to 2000 and he remarried in
2003.  He  has  three  adult  children  from  his first  marriage,  and  he  and  his  second  wife
have  a  teenage  son.  (Item  3  at  20-25)  Applicant  earned  a  Ph.D.  in  2011  and  a
subsequent master’s degree  in 2013. (Item  3 at 11-12) Applicant worked as a scientist
for  a  military  research  lab  on  a  U.S.  military  base  in  State  1  from  August  2007  to
January 2018. (Item 3 at 15) In January 2018, Applicant accepted a new position with a
defense contractor in State 2. He worked there until March 2019, when he  accepted a
new  position  as  a  research  analyst  for  another  defense  contractor  in  the  same  state.
(Item  3  at  13-15)  Applicant  has  maintained  a  secret  clearance  since  about  October
2011. (Item 3 at 37)
The  allegations in the SOR concern Applicant’s use and purchase of marijuana,
including while  in  possession  of  a  security  clearance,  between  about  March  2018  and
about  mid-December  2019  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.c)  and  Applicant’s  intent  to  use
marijuana in the future (SOR ¶ 1.d).
Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  (concerning  marijuana  use),  1.b  (concerning
purchases of marijuana) and 1.d (concerning his intentions to continue using marijuana
in  the  future),  all  without  comment.  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.c,  concerning  his  use
and  purchase  of  marijuana  while  granted  access  to  classified  information,  though  he
stated that he “handled nothing about FOUO” (i.e., unclassified information marked “For
Official Use Only.”) (Item 2)
Applicant did not disclose any drug use on his SCA.  During his December 2019
background  interview,  he  reviewed  his  responses  to  the  questions  on  his  SCA,  and
disclosed drug use and drug treatment while in high school in the 1980s. Applicant then
disclosed to the interviewing agent that he had a medical marijuana card issued by his
current  state  of  residence  (State  3)  and  that  he  used  and  purchased  marijuana  on  a
regular  basis,  for  medicinal  purposes,  to  treat  his  arthritis.  Between  March  2018  and
December 2019 (the time of the interview), Applicant used marijuana between 7 and 10
times  a  week,  during  which  time  he  held  a  security  clearance.  (Item  4  at  p.  14-15)
Applicant  indicated  that  he  intended  to  continue  to  purchase  and  use  marijuana  for
medicinal purposes in the future. (Item 4 at p, 15)
Applicant stated that he did not list this marijuana use on his SCA because it is
not illegal under his home state’s law, so he did not believe he had to disclose it. (Item 4
at p. 14; Item 3 at 2) Because Applicant’s omission  is not alleged under Guideline E, it
will not be considered as disqualifying conduct.
Since January 2018, Applicant has lived in State 3, within commuting distance of
his job in State 2. (Item 3 at 9-10) Applicant stated in his Answer to the SOR  (Item 2)
that when he relocated, he
deliberately   chose   to   live   in  [State   3]  to   take   advantage   of   their   medical
marijuana   program   [citation   to   state   law   omitted]  such   that  I  do   not
‘illegally  use  illegal drugs.’ I answered  truthfully  then  as now  based  on  my
interpretation  of this confusion.  While  I  faithfully  held a  security  clearance
for  over  a   decade,   I  felt  obligated   to   take   this  chance   at  this  time   (two
years ago, of course), come what may.”
Applicant  indicated  in  his  February  2021  interrogatory  response  (by  checking
“No”) that he  had  not “engaged  in any  additional drug  use  since  December 13, 2019,”
and also that he had not used “ANY illegal drug in addition  to marijuana.” (Item 4 at 3)
(Emphasis in original).
In his FORM Response, Applicant reaffirmed his views:
.  .  . I  do   not  ‘illegally   use   illegal drugs,’  and   I  do   not  ‘illegally   use   drugs,”
and  I do  not ‘use  illegal drugs.’ I have  only  engaged  in medical therapy  in
private, after-hours settings.
Applicant  also  protested  Department  Counsel’s  argument  that  he  does  not
possess  the  requisite  reliability,  judgment,  or  trustworthiness  required  of  security
clearance  holders,  based  on  a  consideration  of  his  whole-person  evidence  and  life
experience. (FORM Response) Applicant sees his position as within his right to pursue
“the physical health and well-being that is an inalienable right of all citizens,” and akin to
the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy regarding homosexual conduct. (FORM Response)
Since Applicant has raised the matter, I take administrative notice of the fact that
a  “don’t  ask,  don’t  tell”  policy  concerning  homosexual  conduct  by  U.S.  military service
members  was  instituted  by the  Defense  Department  in  the  1990s. Unlike  the  Defense
Department’s  policy  position  on  marijuana,  discussed  below,  the  “don’t  ask,  don’t  tell”
policy is no longer in force.
Applicant offered no additional evidence in his FORM Response beyond his own
statements. He did not document his medical diagnosis, his medical need for medicinal
marijuana,  or  his  participation  in  his  home  state’s  medicinal  marijuana  program.
Nevertheless, I accept his assertions, which the Government did not challenge.

describe  employment,  names  of  witnesses,  or  locations  in  order  to  protect  Applicant’s
and her family’s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.)
Under the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana
with  varying  frequency  from  September  2001  to  September  2006  and  from  January
2011  to  August  2017.  The  SOR  also  alleges  Applicant  used  marijuana  after  being
granted  access  to  classified  information  in  approximately  January  2011.  In  her
response to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegation with clarifications. She first states
the  term  “with  varying  frequency”  is  vague  and  misleading.  She  has  never  been  a
consistent or habitual user or marijuana. Her marijuana use was sporadic and she has
not  used  marijuana  since  August  2017.  The  first  period,  from  2011  to  2006,  refers  to
occasional  use  during  social  situations  while  in  college.  Applicant  states  she  recalls
using  marijuana  on  three  occasions  in  early  2017.  She  describes  the  use  as  a  small
amount with friends. (Response to SOR, dated July 21, 2021)
Applicant  voluntarily disclosed  her marijuana use  to  the  Government  during her
security clearance background investigations.  On October 4, 2010, Applicant indicated
that  she  used  marijuana  in  response  to  Section  23  –  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug
Activity,  on  her security clearance  application.  She estimated  that  she  used  marijuana
from September 2001 to September 2005, on ten occasions.

During  a  subsequent  background  investigation  interview  in  October  2010,
Applicant  provided
indicated  she  used  marijuana
information.  She
approximately ten times while in college from September 2001 to September 2005. Her
use occurred while at parties or in social situations. She would take one or two puffs off
a  joint  that  was  being  passed  around.  She  never  purchased,  distributed,  or  grew
marijuana.  Her  marijuana  use  was  sporadic.  She  told  the  investigator  during  her
October 2010 background investigation interview that her last use of  marijuana was in
the Spring 2006. (Gov 3 at 16)
On February 6, 2018, Applicant submitted another security clearance application
as  part  of  a  periodic  background  reinvestigation.  In  response  to  Section  23,  Applicant
indicated  that  she  used  marijuana  infrequently  over  the  past  several  years.  She
indicated  the  estimated  month  and  year  of  first  use  was  January  2011.  The  estimate
and  year  of  her  most  recent  use  was  August  2017  (estimated).  She  indicated
“Infrequent use over the  last several years in social settings while  living in  [redacted] –
mainly January 2017 to August 2017.” She also indicated that she had used marijuana
while possessing a security clearance. (Gov 1, Section 23, at 67)
During  a  background  investigation  interview  on  October  13,  2018  Applicant
indicated she used marijuana infrequently from January 2011 to August 2017. Her last
use of marijuana was August 2017. She indicated that she never abused marijuana and
that her use of marijuana cannot subject her to blackmail. (Gov 3 at 8-9)
The  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  sent  Applicant  interrogatories
regarding her past use. The first set asked Applicant to list her past illegal drug use. She
listed  “THC”  (i.e.  marijuana)  and  indicated  the  date  of  her  first  use  was  2001  and  the
date  of  her  last  use  was  2017.  She  listed  the  frequency  of  use  as  “once  every  three
months.”  She acknowledged the information provided was true and correct to the best
of her knowledge and belief. She signed the document before a notary public. No date
was provided with her signature.
The second set of interrogatories provided the unsworn summaries of Applicant’s
background  investigation  interviews  from  October  2018  and  October  2010.  Applicant
was instructed to read the interviews carefully. She was then instructed to provide any
information that was not accurate in the interview summary. Applicant made corrections
to  both  unsworn  summaries.  After  making  corrections  to  the  unsworn  summaries  of
interview, she acknowledged before a notary on March 19, 2021, that she amended the
report and it is now accurate. (Gov 3 at 4-18).
During the hearing, Applicant admitted her answer to the interrogatories indicated
she    used    marijuana    “once    every    three    months”  between    2001    to    2017.  She    indicated
that  this  was  not  accurate   and   that  she   intended   the   answer  to   mean   that  she   used
marijuana   once   every   three   months  in   2017.   It   was  an   omission   on   her  part,  and   she
was not careful when  reviewing  the  interrogatories. She  intended  her answer to  be  in a
broad  fashion  because   she   was  concerned  about  omitting   any   of  her illegal marijuana
use. (Tr. 32-36)
Applicant  has  not  used  marijuana  since  August  2017.  She  used  marijuana

longer associates with the people with whom she used marijuana. She moved out of the
area and has built a new social network.  (Tr. 22, 30-38, 42-44)

"Applicant is 34 years old, and he holds a Bachelor’s degree (2010) and a Master’s
degree (2012). He is married and has a newly born daughter (about five months old at
the date of the Brief). Applicant recently purchased his home. Since 2015, he has been
employed by a defense contractor. (Item 2 and Brief.)
The SOR alleged that Applicant (1) used marijuana from about January 2011 to
February  2018,  including  after  completing  his  SCA  in  August  2017;  (2)  used  and
purchased cocaine three times from May 2012 to April 2016; and (3) used hallucinogenic
mushrooms once in May 2015 and once in February 2017. (Item 1.)  Applicant admitted
those allegations with explanations that he expanded further in his Brief. (Items 1, 3, and
Brief.)
Applicant’s answer and response to the FORM made the following points. First, he
observed that the duration of his first and last drug usage spanned many years and those
instances were “few and  far between.”  Second, Applicant argued that his single use of
marijuana during the four year clearance process was isolated and that he stopped when
he realized it could affect his clearance. Third, Applicant noted that since his drug usage
he  has  married,  bought  a  home,  and  has  a  young  child.  Finally,  he  emphasized  his
community involvement and his academic accomplishments. (Brief.) Applicant submitted

Applicant submitted a signed statement that comports with AG ¶ 26(b). (Item 3.)
Law and Policies
It  is well-established  law  that no  one  has a  right to  a  security  clearance. As  noted
by  the  Supreme  Court in  Department of the  Navy v. Egan, “the  clearly  consistent standard
indicates  that  security  clearance  determinations should  err,  if  they  must,  on  the   side  of
denials.”  Department  of  Navy  v.  Egan,   484   U.S.  518,   528,531   (1988)  (“it  should   be
obvious  that   no   one   has  a   ‘right’  to   a   security   clearance”);  Duane   v.   Department  of
Defense,  275   F.3d   988,  994   (10th   Cir.  2002)  (no   right  to   a   security   clearance).  Under
Egan, E.O. 10865, and  the  Directive, any  doubt  about whether  an  applicant  should be
allowed   access  to   classified   information   will   be   resolved   in  favor of   protecting   national
security.
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a  security  clearance  for  access  to  confidential,  secret,  or  top-secret  information.  An
unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any  existing
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). The
Government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR
that have been controverted. An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute,
explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven. In addition, an
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance
of evidence. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning,
and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard. ISCR
Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement and Substance  Abuse
Discussion
Under AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into
doubt because  drug  use  can both  impair  judgment and  raise  questions about a  person’s
ability  or willingness to  comply  with  laws, rules, and  regulations.  AG ¶¶  24, 25  and  26
(setting forth  the concern and the disqualifying and  mitigating conditions).
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription
and  non-prescription  drugs,  and  the  use  of  other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their
intended  purpose  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual's  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior  may  lead  to  physical  or
psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises  questions  about  a  person's
ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  Controlled
substance  means  any  ""controlled  substance""  as  defined  in  21  U.S.C.  802.
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions or factors:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);
AG  ¶   25(c)   illegal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  including
cultivation,  processing,  manufacture,  purchase,  sale,  or  distribution;  or
possession of drug paraphernalia;
AG  ¶   26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment; and,
AG  ¶   26(b)  the  individual acknowledges  his or her drug involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including,  but  not
limited to:
(1) disassociation  from drug-using associates and contacts;(2)
changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were  used; and,
(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security
eligibility.
Applicant  admitted   using   marijuana,  cocaine,   and   hallucinogenic   mushrooms
occasionally, with  the  most recent  usage  being  in February  2018    Facts admitted  by  an
applicant  in   an   answer  to   a   SOR   or  in   an   interview   require   no   further  proof   from   the
Government.   ISCR   Case   No.  94-1159   at   4   (App.   Bd.  Dec.  4,  1995)  (“any   admissions
[applicant] made to  the  SOR allegations . . . relieve  Department  Counsel of  its burden  of
proof”); ISCR  Case  No. 94-0569  at 4  and  n.1  (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (“[a]n  applicant’s
admissions,  whether testimonial or  written, can  provide  a  legal basis  for an  Administrative
Judge’s findings”).
Marijuana and cocaine are Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of
them  is regulated  by  the  federal government  under the  Controlled  Substances  Act.  21
U.S.C.  §   811   et   seq.   The   knowing   or  intentional  possession   and   use   of   any   such
substance  is  unlawful and punishable by imprisonment and or a  fine.  21U.S.C.§844.  In
an  October 25,  2014  memorandum, the  Director of National Intelligence  affirmed  that
the   use   of  marijuana   is  relevant   to   national  security   determinations,   regardless  of
changes to  state  laws concerning  marijuana  use.  James R. Clapper, Director of  National
Intelligence,  Memorandum:  Adherence   to   Federal  Laws  Prohibiting   Marijuana   Use
(October 25, 2014). See  also  http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml.   AG  ¶¶  25(a) and
(c) apply. The next inquiry is whether  any mitigating factors apply.
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(a). Applicant used illegal drugs with
varying frequency as recently as February 2018. His behavior was neither infrequent, nor
did it occur that long ago, with his last use being in February 2018, just over three years
ago. I find that AG ¶ 26(a) does not apply.
I  have  considered  mitigating  factor  AG  ¶  26(b).  Applicant’s  signed  written
statement faithfully tracks the language of AG ¶ 26(b). Of more importance is the record
evidence that Applicant’s life has dramatically changed since his drug-dabbling days. He
has become a husband, a father, and a homeowner. In addition to his impressive history
of  academic  and  professional  accomplishments,  Applicant  is  very  active  in  civic  and
community affairs. AG ¶ 26(b) applies.
The  record  does  not  raise  doubts  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,
judgment,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:
For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information.

"Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a and 1.b. He denied falsifying his April 2009
clearance  application  by  omitting  his  drug  use.  Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  mechanical
engineer employed by a defense contractor since  July 2008. He has held an industrial
clearance since approximately June 2009, based on an April 2009 clearance application
(Item 4). In May 2008, he graduated from a prestigious U.S. university with a degree in
mechanical engineering.  He married in June 2015 (Item 5); he and his wife adopted  a
shelter dog in mid-2017, and had a daughter in May 2019 (Item 3).
Applicant disclosed no substance abuse on his April 2009 clearance application
(Item  4).  On  his  March  2019  clearance  application  (Item  5),  he  stated  that  he  used
marijuana  about  once  or  twice  per  year  from  about  September  2004  to  July  2018,  on
special occasions. He also stated his intent to continue to use marijuana in the future, as
its use was legal in his state of residence and he could not categorically foreswear future
use.  He  reiterated  this  drug  history  and  intent  during  a  June  2019  interview  with  a
Government investigator, stating that he enjoyed marijuana and it did not affect his work.
Applicant now foreswears future drug abuse, both because of his employment and
because of the changes in his personal life. However, he also noted that he had used
marijuana with his wife (without clarifying whether they were married at the time). He has
also drastically edited the extent of his drug use, stating that he did not really remember
the number of occasions he used marijuana, and gave the September 2004 start date to
coincide  with  his  entry  to  college  out  of  an  abundance  of  caution  (Answer,  Item  3).
However, he currently counts only two specific instances of drug use.
Applicant’s Answer includes a November 2020 drug screen with negative results,
employment  evaluations  and  awards  attesting  to  an  otherwise  exemplary  work  history
from 2008 to 2019, and a November 2020 statement  of intent abjuring future drug use
consistent with the directive—along with a commitment to regular drug screens for at least
the next two years (Item 3).
Aside from his employment evaluations and company awards, Applicant submitted
no  work  or  character  references,  and  provided  no  evidence  of  any  community
involvement. Applicant’s Answer contains many self-serving assertions that require me
to accept his inferences that (1) he was unaware of Federal law proscribing marijuana
use, regardless of state law, that (2) he was oblivious to the obvious proscription implied
by the drug abuse question on the clearance application, that (3) he was unaware of any
company  policy  regarding  drug  use,  and  that  (4)  despite  his  meticulous  answers  to
detailed  questions  on  his  clearance  applications,  and  the  precision  required  by  his
employment and his profession, he was unable to more precisely pinpoint the extent of
his drug use on his 2019 clearance application and during his 2019 subject interview.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h,
2.a,  and  3.a,  with  explanations.  His  admissions  in  his  answer  and  at  the  hearing  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  engineering  technician  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  November  2018.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from
February 2012 to October 2017. He received a security clearance in December 2011, in
preparation  for  entrance  into  the  Navy  nuclear  propulsion  program.  He  married  on
September 2016 and has a two-year-old son and an eight-year-old stepson.
Applicant completed his first enlistment in the Navy without incident, received an
honorable discharge, and immediately reenlisted. He received nonjudicial punishment in
February  2013  for  smoking  an  electronic  cigarette  in  the  engine  room,  which  was  a
restricted area. He was reduced one pay grade (suspended), and restricted to the ship
for 30 days. At the time, he was responsible for supervising up to seven junior technicians.
(AX  J;  Tr.  37.)  After  receiving  nonjudicial  punishment,  he  was  removed  from  his
supervisory position.
Smoking in the engine room was a common practice. Applicant admitted that he
should have enforced the rule against smoking in the area. Instead, he joined the smokers
in the practice. He believes that an incoming new chain of command punished him to set
the example and make it clear that violation of the no-smoking rule would not be tolerated
any longer. (Tr. 15.)
Applicant attended a party with a group of friends in August 2017 and joined them
in  smoking  marijuana  that  was  being  passed  around.  He  tested  positive  in  a  random
urinalysis, and he received nonjudicial punishment for drug use. He attributed his use of
marijuana to being depressed after being removed from a supervisory position. (GX 3 at
5.) Based on the  two  incidents  resulting in nonjudicial punishment, he was  discharged
from the Navy with an other than honorable discharge, and he did not complete his term
of  enlistment, for which he had received a substantial reenlistment bonus. There is no
evidence  that  he  was  diagnosed  with  a  drug-use  disorder  or  that  he  received  any
counseling or treatment for his marijuana use.
After Applicant  was  discharged from  the  Navy,  he  was  unemployed  for about  a
month. When he found a job with a car dealership, he earned about $2,000 per month,
as compared to his Navy pay, which was more than $5,000 per month. (GX 1 at 16-18;
Tr. 19.) His wife had a difficult pregnancy and was unable to continue working outside the
home. (AX L; Tr. 20-21.)
The SOR alleges a debt to the U.S. Government placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.b)
and seven consumer debts totaling $18,895 that are past due or referred for collection
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c-1.h). The debts are reflected in credit reports from February 2021
and January 2020. (GX 4 and 5.) The evidence pertaining to the debts alleged in the SOR
is summarized below.
SOR  ¶  1.a,  credit  union  debt,  past  due  for  $573,  outstanding  balance  of
$14,857.  In  an  enhanced  subject  interview  (ESI)  in  January  2020,  Applicant  told  an
investigator that this debt was a line of credit that he used to cover multiple debts after he
was discharged from the Navy. (GX 3 at 11.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that it
was a joint credit-card account that he opened to enable his wife to establish credit.  At
the hearing, he testified that it was a credit-card debt incurred to buy furniture, repair cars,
and “different things.” (Tr. 24.)
SOR  ¶  1.b,  indebtedness  to  the  United  States,  placed  for  collection  of
$35,559. This debt is a recoupment of Applicant’s reenlistment bonus as a result of his
premature discharge for misconduct. He had a payment plan providing for monthly $50
payments  for  one  year,  but  after  the  one-year  plan  expired,  the  monthly  payments
increased to about $1,000 per month. Starting in February 2019, his pay was garnished
for $250 twice a month to repay the debt. (GX 3 at 13.)  He requested a new payment
plan,  but  had  not  received  a  response  as  of  the  time  the  record  closed.  In  November
2019, Applicant requested the garnishment be terminated because of financial hardship.
(AX G.) At the time of the hearing, collection of the debt was being deferred because of
the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. 23, 28.) Applicant’s most recent federal tax refund of about
$7,000 was diverted to pay this debt. (Tr. 27.)
SOR  ¶  1.c,  credit  card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $2,948.  In  the  ESI,
Applicant told the investigator that he incurred this debt at an electronics store to buy a
laptop and other items. (GX 3 at 10.) At the hearing, he testified that this debt was incurred
to buy his wife’s engagement ring. (Tr. 29.)
SOR ¶ 1.d, credit-card account charged off for $6,423. Applicant testified that
he opened this account jointly with his wife so that she could build her credit. (Tr. 25.)
SOR  ¶  1.e,  credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $3,947.  Applicant
testified  that  this  account  also  was  used  to  purchase  his  wife’s  engagement  ring,  her
wedding ring, and his wedding ring. Two accounts were used to make these purchases
because  his  credit  limit  prevented  him  from  charging  all  the  purchases  on  the  same
account. The total cost of an engagement ring and two wedding rings was around $5,000.
(Tr. 30.)
SOR  ¶  1.f,  finance  company account  charged  off  for  $1,456.  This debt  was
incurred to buy an expensive vacuum cleaner from a door-to-door salesman. (Tr. 31.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h, credit-card accounts charged off for $1,837 and $2,284.
Applicant used these accounts to pay for expensive repairs on an older sports car. (Tr.
31-32.)
None of the debts alleged in the SOR are resolved. Except for the recoupment of
the reenlistment bonus, Applicant presented no evidence that he attempted to contact his
creditors, made any payments, or attempted to establish payment plans before resorting
to Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He has not disputed any of the debts.
In August 2020, Applicant hired a lawyer to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.
He paid the lawyer $400 and agreed to pay an additional $1,070 before the petition is
filed.  (AX  D.)  He  completed  the  credit  counseling  required  by  the  bankruptcy  court  in
February 2021. (AX I.) He testified that he found the credit counseling helpful, because it
taught him how to create a budget and how to plan for the future. (Tr. 22.) At the time of
the hearing, he had not yet filed his bankruptcy petition because he could not afford the
attorney’s fee and filing fees. (Tr. 34.)
Applicant’s  wife  worked  part time  at a  grocery  store  until her complications  with
pregnancy. For the past year, she delivered pizzas until the end of October 2021. She
has enlisted in the Navy, and at the time of the hearing she was scheduled to report to
boot camp on November 30, 2021. Applicant will be a sole parent until April 2022, and he
expects to incur child-care expenses of about $300 per week, which he believes will be
affordable with their increase in joint income. (Tr. 47-49.) As of November 2020, Applicant
and his wife had monthly income of $3,540; expenses of $2,855; and debt payments (for
two cars) of $307 and $298, leaving a net monthly remainder of $80. (AX E.)
When  Applicant  responded  to  the  SOR  in  November  2020,  he  submitted  a
statement of intent to refrain from illegal drug involvement and  acknowledged that any
future involvement or misuse would be grounds for revocation of his security clearance.
(AX  H.)  He  testified  that  he  does  not  associate  with  the  persons  with  whom  he  used
marijuana or any of his former coworkers. He found a church community and new friends
who share his values. He has stopped using alcohol and tobacco products. (Tr. 44-45.)
His  pastor  submitted  a  letter  attesting  to  his  good  character,  candor,  honesty,  and
credibility. (AX M at 1.)
Applicant’s instructor at a technical school has known him for about two years and
believes that he has demonstrated the high character and integrity required to work as a
test  engineer.  (AX  M  at  2.)  Applicant’s  project  manager  describes  him  as  “a  shining
example of integrity, duty, and patriotism.” (AX M at 3.)

awarded a Master of Electrical Engineering degree in June 2003. He has received three
patents  and  has  three  patents  pending.  (GE  1;  AE  F,  AE  G;  Tr.  14-15,  27-28)  He
married in December 2018. (GE 1; Tr. 15-16) Applicant’s wife is employed as a pediatric
dentist at a children’s hospital. At the time of the hearing, Applicant’s wife was expecting
their first child. (Tr. 16-17)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  self-reported  his  drug  use  on  his  September  20,  2019  SF-86,  when
applying  for  a  security  clearance  with  his  current  employer.  (GE  1;  Tr.  10,  19-20)  He
was  subsequently  interviewed  on  November  11,  2019,  by  an  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  investigator  as  part  of  his  background  investigation  regarding  his
drug use. None of his drug use occurred while holding a security clearance. (GE 2) He
further  elaborated  on  his  drug  use  in  his  January  29,  2021  SOR  Answer  as  well  as
during his testimony. The following summarizes that drug use.
SOR  ¶   1.a   alleged   that  Applicant  used   marijuana   with   varying   frequency   from
about  January   1996   to   June   2019.   During   his  testimony,  Applicant  clarified   his   past
marijuana  use. While  in  college, he  used  marijuana  “probably  half  a  dozen  times  or so.”
After college  from  1998  to  2000, Applicant used  marijuana  “once, maybe  twice.” (SOR
Answer; Tr. 19, 32-35)  From  2000  to  2010, he  did “not touch  it at all.” This included  the
five-year period  he  held  a  clearance.   (Tr. 18-19)  From  2010  to  2014, he  used  cannabis
in conjunction  with  a  vaporizer he  developed  “maybe  every  two  to  six  months.”  (Tr. 35-
38)  From   2014   to   2019,  Applicant  characterized   his  marijuana   use   as  “maybe   one   or
two   puffs,  maybe   every  six   months.  .  .  .  Really   infrequent.”  (Tr.  39-40)   The   last   time
Applicant used  marijuana  was in June  2019  at a  summer gathering. If offered  marijuana
today, Applicant credibly  stated,  “I would just walk away. It’s not  part  of my  life.” (Tr.  22-
23, 28)
Applicant does not use marijuana or cannabis-based products. His prior use was
always personal and recreational. He never used marijuana when he previously held a
clearance from 2000 to 2005 and does not currently use or intend  to use marijuana or
any cannabis-based products in the future.  (SOR Answer; Tr. 19) Applicant reiterated
his  commitment  during  his  hearing  that  he  does  not  envision  nor  does  he  have  any
intent to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 24, 29, 43)
He added that he would not use marijuana in the future even if marijuana were
legalized  at  the  Federal  level.  Applicant  explained,  “Fundamentally,  it’s  just  not  who  I
am.  It’s  not  part  of  my  life  anymore.”  Applicant  stated,  “And  second  part  is  my  wife,
[wife’s  name],  is  from  [South  American  country].  She  is  adamantly  against  marijuana.
Her  father  was  an  ex-undercover  detective,  and  her  mother  was  a  judge  in  [South
American country]. So she grew up with very strong black-and-white  morals  and  she’s
very, very adamant on this subject. So no one would be anywhere near our house using
marijuana,  or  anything  else  illegal.”  (Tr.  24-25)  Applicant  does  not  associate  with
anyone who uses marijuana. (Tr. 44)
Applicant  stated  that  his  marijuana  use  was  never  the  result  of  a  medical
prescription, nor for self-medication. He has never been referred to drug counseling for
his past marijuana use. Applicant further stated that he does not now, nor has he ever,
struggled with addiction for any illegal substance, including cannabis. He has never had
a positive drug test. In his SOR Answer and during his hearing, Applicant submitted two
separate signed statements of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance
misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation
of  national  security  eligibility.  (SOR  Answer;  AE  B,  AE  K;  Tr.  23-24,  29-30)  Applicant
submitted  three  negative  drug  tests,  one  test  collected  on  January  25,  2021,  and  two
tests collected on June 10, 2021. (Tr. 24; AE C, AE J)
Applicant  also  submitted  a  comprehensive  drug  and  alcohol  assessment  dated
June  20,  2021,  from  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker,  certified  substance  abuse
counselor,  and  masters  addiction  professional  and
licensed  substance  abuse
professional.  She  concluded  that  Applicant  “is  not  at  risk  of  relapse  or  return  to  his
previous behavior. [Applicant] is fully capable of safeguarding classified information and
[she] find[s] him fit for duty in a position affecting the national security.” (Tr. 28; AE I)
Character Evidence
Applicant  submitted  five  reference  letters  from  individuals  who  know  Applicant
well. Two of those references are former work colleagues and one is a former neighbor.
One  reference  is  his  current  supervisor,  and  one  reference  is  his  wife.  Four  of
Applicant’s references are familiar with DoD security clearance regulations and policies.
All references are familiar  with the nature of the allegations against Applicant and fully
support him. Applicant’s 2020 performance evaluation documents superior performance
and his contribution to the national defense.  Applicant’s former colleagues and  current
supervisor  corroborated  the  positive  performance  evaluation  comments
in  their
reference  letters.  (Tr.  24-27;  AE  D,  AE  E,  AE  M)  Applicant  submitted  current
photographs of his wife and him. (Tr. 30-31; AE H, AE L)
",True
"Applicant is 59 years old. He is divorced with no children. Since 2002, he has been
employed by a defense contractor. (Item 3.)
The SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) used marijuana with varying frequency from
about  2015  to  present;  (2)  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  2017  to
present while having access to classified information; (3) and intends to continue using
marijuana  in  the  future.  (Item  1.)  Applicant  admitted  the  first  two  allegations  (with
qualifications) and denied that he intends to use marijuana in the future. Applicant claimed
that  contrary  to  the  SOR  his  most  recent  use  of  marijuana  began  in  2018  or  2019.
(Response  pp.  3  and  9.)  That  claim  does  not  comport  with  Applicant’s  April  2,  2020
statement that he used marijuana from 2015 to February 2020, including while holding a
security clearance.  (Item 5, Drugs, Developed Marijuana Use, and Drug Use Reporting.)
Applicant  completed  SCAs  in  2020  and  2016.  In  neither  of  those  applications  did
Applicant  disclose  his  prior  marijuana  use.  (Items  3  and  4.)  Applicant  submitted  a
statement of intent that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. (Item 5.) His
statement  is  undercut  by  his  contradictory  statement  denying  his  use  of  marijuana
between 2015 and 2020 and his explanation that he, or someone, was confused. (Item
5.)
Discussion
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement and Substance  Abuse
Under AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into
doubt because  drug  use  can both  impair  judgment and  raise  questions about a  person’s
ability  or willingness to  comply  with  laws, rules, and  regulations.  AG ¶¶  24, 25  and  26
(setting forth  the concern and the disqualifying and  mitigating conditions).
The illegal use  of controlled substances, to include the  misuse of prescription
and   non-prescription   drugs,  and   the   use   of   other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental  impairment or are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent with  their
intended   purpose   can   raise   questions  about  an   individual's  reliability   and
trustworthiness,  both   because   such   behavior  may   lead   to   physical  or
psychological  impairment   and   because   it  raises  questions  about   a   person's
ability   or  willingness  to   comply   with   laws,  rules,   and   regulations.  Controlled
substance   means  any   ""controlled   substance""   as  defined   in  21   U.S.C.  802.
Substance  misuse  is the  generic term  adopted  in this guideline  to  describe  any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions or factors:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);
AG  ¶   25(c)   illegal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  including
cultivation,  processing,  manufacture,  purchase,  sale,  or  distribution;  or
possession of drug paraphernalia;
AG  ¶   25(f)   any  illegal  drug  use  while  granted  access  to  classified
information;
AG ¶  25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement . . . or failure to
clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse;
AG  ¶   26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment;
AG  ¶   26(b)  the  individual acknowledges  his or her drug involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including,  but  not
limited to:
(1) disassociation  from drug-using associates and contacts;
(2) changing   or avoiding   the   environment   where drugs  were  used;
and
(3)  providing  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security
eligibility.
Applicant admitted  using  marijuana  while  holding  a  security  with  the  most recent
usage  being  in  February  2020.  Facts  admitted  by  an  applicant in  an  answer to  an  SOR
or in an  interview  require  no  further proof  from  the  Government.  ISCR  Case  No.  94-1159
at 4  (App. Bd. Dec. 4,  1995) (“any  admissions [applicant] made  to  the  SOR allegations .
. . relieve  Department Counsel of  its  burden of  proof”); ISCR  Case No. 94-0569  at 4  and
n.1  (App. Bd. Mar. 30,  1995) (“[a]n  applicant’s  admissions, whether testimonial or written,
can provide  a legal basis for an  Administrative Judge’s findings”).
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated
by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. § 811 et seq.
The knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and
punishable  by  imprisonment,  a  fine  or  both.  21U.S.C.§844.  In  an  October  25,  2014
memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is
a security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of  National Intelligence, Memorandum:
Adherence  to  Federal  Laws  Prohibiting  Marijuana  Use  (October  25,  2014).  See  also
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml
On  December  21,  2021,  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  signed  the
memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for
Agencies  Conducting  Adjudications  of  Persons  Proposed  for  Eligibility  for  Access  to
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal
law  remains  unchanged  with  respect  to  the  illegal  use,  possession,  production  and
distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited  by  law  from  using  controlled  substances.  Disregard  of  federal  law
pertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but
not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the “whole-
person  concept”  stated  under  SEAD  4,  to  determine  whether  the  applicant’s  behavior
raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
Disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 25(a), (c), and (f) apply here. Because of Applicant’s
record of prior marijuana use and his equivocation on future use, AG ¶ 25(g) may also
apply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply.
I  have  considered  mitigating  factor  AG  ¶  26(a).  Applicant  used  illegal  drugs  with
varying frequency as recently as February 2020. His behavior was neither infrequent, nor
did it occur that long ago, with his last use being in February 2020, just two years ago. I
find that AG ¶ 26(a) does not apply.
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(b). Applicant’s signed written statement
does  track  the  language  of  AG  ¶  and26(b).  In  explaining  his  future  intent,  Applicant’s
interview was equivocal. He cites “confusion” and apologizes if he caused any confusion.
Taking the record as a whole given Applicant’s recent and a frequent use of marijuana, I
find that his statement of intent lacks credibility. AG ¶ 26(b) does not apply.
The  record  raises  doubt  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  judgment,
and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not
met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly not consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant access to classified information.

"Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since January 2019. He is applying for a security clearance for the
first  time.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree,  which  he  earned  in  1996,  and  he  attended  a
school that helped him pass an examination to be licensed as a real estate agent. He is
married  for  the  second  time  after  his  first  marriage  ended  in  divorce.  He  has  two
children and four stepchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 10, 22-23; GE 1, 2)
Applicant started smoking marijuana in 1992 when he was a freshman in college.
He  continued  to  sporadically  use  marijuana  through  November  2018.  He  used
hallucinogenic mushrooms on one occasion in 2017, but he did not like the experience
and never used them again. (Tr. at 10, 14-15; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant lives in a state that has not legalized marijuana. In 2016, he invested in
a  registered  marijuana farm  in a  state  that has  made marijuana  legal under state  law.
He owned about 12% of the farm. He had no involvement in the operation of the farm.
He sold his share of the farm for $75,000 in December 2020. (Tr. at 16-17; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A)
Applicant  reported  his  use  of  marijuana  and  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  and  his
investment  in  the  marijuana  farm  on  the  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions
(SF-86)  he  submitted  in  July  2019.  He  reported  that  he  used  marijuana  about  once  a
year,  with  his  last  use  in  November  2018.  He  checked  the  box  indicating  that  he
intended to use marijuana in the future, with the explanation: “THC combined with CBD
have  proven  therapeutic  effects  on  the  human  body,  and  THC  is  legal  in  two-thirds
(33/50) of US states plus our nation’s capital. I do not smoke or consume THC in public
places and do not operate a motor vehicle while under the influence.” (GE 1)
Applicant  discussed  his  drug  use  during  his background  interview  in  July 2019.
He  stated  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  He  repeated  that
position  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  in  November  2020,  in  his  March  2021
response to the SOR, and at his hearing. (GE 2)
Applicant has not used any illegal drugs since November 2018, before he started
work for a defense contractor and before he submitted his SF-86. He understands that
marijuana possession is against federal law, and illegal drug use and investments in the
marijuana  industry  are  inconsistent  with  holding  a  security  clearance.  He  credibly
testified that he does not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future.
He  provided  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and
substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for
revocation  of  national  security  eligibility  (Tr.  at  10-11,  15-20;  Applicant’s  response  to

"In  Applicant’s SOR  response,  he  admitted SOR  allegations.  (¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,  1.c,  1.d, and
2.a.) He qualified his admission to ¶ 1.b, that alleged he had used THC while granted access to
classified  information,  with  the  qualification  “if  that’s  what  I  wrote  then  I  admit.”  There  is  no
evidence in the record that Applicant wrote (or stated) that he had used marijuana while holding
a security clearance or while having access to classified information. He did not specifically admit
or deny ¶¶ 3.a, and 4.a. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. (Item 1)
Applicant is 59 years old. He married in 1992 and divorced in 2013, and currently lives
with  a  cohabitant.  Since  September  2018,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor.  Applicant  listed  on  his  April  2019  SCA  that  he  previously  held  a  DOD  security
clearance in approximately 1982. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) showed that
Applicant  had  been  granted  a  secret  security  clearance  in  February  2006.  There  is  no  other
evidence that was submitted to show the specific period of time Applicant possessed his security
clearance, whether it was for one month, one year, or if Applicant continuously held the security
clearance from February 2006 through January 2013. (Items 3, 4 and 6)
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant smoked marijuana (THC) with varying
frequency from about January 1979 to January 2013. His heaviest use occurred during his high
school years and he used marijuana occasionally in his 30s and 40s. Over the course of his life
Applicant  estimated  he  has  used  marijuana  on  about  100  occasions.  He  used  LSD  and
psilocybin mushrooms (hallucinogens) from about 1979 to 2005. His heaviest use occurred in
high school, but he did use these substances again in his 40s. Applicant used cocaine from 1985
to 1995. He experimented with this drug and never enjoyed the experience. Over the course of
ten  years  he  used  cocaine  about  ten  times.  He  has  no  plans  to  use  any  of  these  illegal
substances in the future. (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Applicant  self-reported his illegal drug history on  the  SCA he  signed  in  April 2019.  He
listed that he had not used any illegal drugs while he held a DOD security clearance. During his
background interview in June 2019, which was certified by Applicant in November 2020, he told
the investigator that he had not used any illegal substance while holding a security clearance.
Applicant also responded to an interrogatory question which specifically asked whether he had
used  any  illegal  drugs  after  he  had  been  granted  a  security  clearance  in  February  2006.
Applicant responded; “No.” (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Applicant was granted a security clearance in February 2006, about eight months after
he had been hired by a different federal contractor. Department Counsel argued in the brief that
one  could  assume  that  Applicant  continuously held  a  security  clearance  from  February 2006
until September 2015, when he left that employment. According to Applicant’s admissions, his
use  of  marijuana  until  January  2013  overlapped  with  his  employment  and  possession  of  a
security clearance  if  he  held  it  continuously from  February 2006  until he  left  the  employment
position in September 2015. JPAS reflected the date the security clearance was issued, but it
did not reflect the length of time Applicant possessed the security clearance. (Items 3 and 6)
Under Guideline  G it  alleged  that Applicant  was arrested  in March 2017  for Driving  Under
the   Influence   of  Alcohol.   (DUI)   He   was  found   guilty   and   was  sentenced   to   restricted   driving
privileges  for six   months,  to   serve   eight   days  in   the  Sheriff’s   work program,  completion  of  an
alcohol education  program, fined about $1,900, and he was placed  on three years of probation.
This alcohol-related  allegation  (¶ 2.a) and  all  of  the  allegations under Guideline  H (¶¶  1.a  through
1.d) were cross-alleged  under Guideline J (¶  3.a).  The  allegation that Applicant used marijuana
while  possessing  a  security  clearance  (¶  1.b) was cross-alleged  under  Guideline  E  (¶  4.a).  (Items
1, 2, 3,  4, and 5)
Applicant told the investigator during his June 2019 background interview that this arrest
in 2017 was his only alcohol-related arrest. He successfully completed his court-ordered alcohol
education program and was not recommended to participate in any other alcohol treatment. He
consumed alcohol about three times weekly from the age of 21 until November 2015, when his
mother  passed  away.  After  November  2015  he  consumed  a  greater  volume  of  alcohol  more
frequently. He would consume a couple glasses of wine and on occasion, a shot of bourbon.
After  his  March  2017  DUI  arrest,  he  greatly  reduced  his  alcohol  consumption.  He  told  the
investigator  that  he  did  not  have  a  problem  with  alcohol  and  the  2017  DUI  was  an  isolated
incident. In the 2020 interrogatories,  Applicant reported that he completely stopped all use of
alcohol in October 2019. He also quit smoking tobacco for health, spiritual, and mental reasons.

1.a-1.j. (SOR ¶ 2.a) The SOR alleged that Applicant was charged with leaving the scene
of an accident (alcohol involved) in May 2013 and charged with driving under the influence
of alcohol in May 2014. (SOR ¶¶ 2.b-2.c) It alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false
information on his September 2015 security clearance application (SCA) when he failed
to disclose his illegal drug activity as stated in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.i above. (SOR ¶¶
2.d-2.f)  It  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  gave  false  information  on  his  September
2015 SCA and his July 2019 SCA when he stated that alcohol was not involved with his
May 2013 arrest for leaving the scene of an accident. (SOR ¶¶ 2.g-2.h)
Applicant admitted all of his illegal drug use, his prescription drug misuse, his 2013
and 2014 charges, and his deliberate false answers given on his 2015 and 2019 SCAs.
(Tr.  25,  30,  34-35;  SOR  Answer)  In  Applicant’s  2019  SCA,  during  his  February  2020
background interview, and in response to DOHA interrogatories, he set forth his extensive
drug history which  began  in approximately 2008.  He began using marijuana as a high
school  senior  in  2008.  He  continued  using  marijuana  while  attending  college.  He
increased his use frequency from two to three times a month to using it multiple times a
day by his sophomore year in college. At that time, he also began selling marijuana. He
sold  and  distributed  marijuana  during  his  sophomore  and  junior  years.  He  made  a
monetary profit by selling marijuana and obtained it free for his own personal use. During
his senior year of college, he was asked to leave his fraternity because of his drug use.
His  drug  supplier  was  arrested  for  trafficking,  and  he  lost  that  source  of  marijuana  for
himself. He found a new source and continued to buy marijuana so that he could use it
on a daily basis throughout his senior year. Applicant continued his marijuana use through
2016 when he obtained a security clearance. He has used marijuana “several  hundred
times.” He claims his last use of marijuana was in June 2018. He ate a marijuana-laced
chocolate bar. When reporting his use in his July 2019 SCA, he claimed he “accidentally”
ate the marijuana-laced chocolate bar. In his later February 2020 background interview,
he told the investigator that he intentionally and knowingly ate the chocolate bar. He held
a security clearance at the time of this knowing use of marijuana. Without specifying what
drug it was, Applicant testified that his last use of illegal drugs was on December 31, 2018.
He deliberately failed to list his illegal marijuana use on his September 2015 SCA because
he believed that if he answered truthfully he would not receive a security clearance. (Tr.
23, 25, 28, 30, 34; GE 1-3)
Applicant’s  other  admitted  drug  involvement  included:  (1)  cocaine—first  use
September 2011—last use  December 2017—frequency,  twice  a  year from  2011-2013,
once  in  2017;  (2)  methamphetamines—first  use  September  2011—last  use  summer
2017—frequency,  once  or  twice  a  year  from  2011  to  2017;  (3)  Adderall—first  use
December 2008—last use January 2019 (Applicant gives conflicting versions of his last
use  of  Adderall  in  his  background  interview  where  he  stated  his  last  uses  were  from
January to June 2019)—frequency, monthly to quarterly from 2008-2014, once or twice
a year 2014-2019; (4) Trazodone—first use August 2017—last use September 2017—
frequency, once or twice. He did not have a legal prescription for Adderall and Trazodone
at the time he used them. He purchased the drugs from someone who had a prescription.
He purchased the methamphetamines he used from an unknown source. The cocaine he
used was either given to him by friends or his girlfriend (now wife) purchased it for their
use. He deliberately failed to list his pre-2015 drug use and prescription drug abuse on
his  2015  SCA.  He  used  all  these  drugs  when  he  held  a  security  clearance.  Applicant
believed that even though he held a clearance at the time of his uses, he did not yet have
access to any cleared information so he did not think there was a problem. He did not
reveal his overall drug history to his current employer until after his  security clearance
hearing. (Tr. 29; GE 1-3; AE J-K)
Applicant admitted that he deliberately gave false information on both his 2015 and
2019 SCAs when he stated that alcohol was not involved when he was ordered to seek
alcohol counseling by the court as a result of his 2013 arrest. (Tr. 34-35; GE 1-2)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  any  drug  counseling.  He  was  court-ordered  to
attend alcohol counseling related to his 2013 and 2014 arrests. His wife continues to use
both marijuana and cocaine, despite having an infant child. (Tr. 32-33)
Applicant is involved in community activities such as Habitat for Humanity and First
Robotics. He provided work documentation, which he believes shows that he has matured
and  become  a  leader  within  his  company.  He  reported  an  employee  for  not  following
security procedures. He also presented his work performance appraisals for years 2014,
2015, and 2020. He received overall ratings of “exceeded commitments” (rating of 4 out
of 5) for 2014, “exceeded commitments” (rating of 4.1 out of 5) for 2015, and “significantly
exceeded”  (no  numerical  value  given)  for  2020.  Applicant  also  presented  a  standard
operating  procedure  (SOP)  that  he  developed.  He  stated  in  his  testimony,  and  in  his
answer to interrogatories in November 2020, that he did not intend to use illegal drugs or
misuse  prescription  drugs  in  the  future.  He  lives  in  a  state  where  marijuana  use  and
possession is legal under state law. (Tr. 24, 28, 37-39; GE 1, 3; AE A-I)

"Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $28,955 for six
delinquent student loans (SOR 1.a – 1.f), and $416 for three delinquent medical accounts
(SOR  1.g  –  1.i).  Under  Guideline  H,  the  Government  alleged  that  in  October  2017,
Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia (SOR 2.a);
and that he used marijuana between July 2018 and March 2020 (SOR 2.b). (FORM, Item
1)
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  explanations,  each  of  the
allegations. After reviewing the Government’s information and Applicant’s submissions in
response to the SOR and the FORM, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  employee  of  a  company  contracted  with  the  federal
government  to  perform  duties  in  support  of  governmental  functions  that  use  and
safeguard personally identifiable information (PII). Applicant attended a nationally known
technical  institute  between  February  2012  and  June  2014,  when  he  received  an
associate’s  degree.  To  fund  the  tuition  for  his  studies,  Applicant  obtained  the  student
loans  addressed  in  SOR  1.a  –  1.f.  The  school  he  attended  was  later  found  to  have
engaged in fraudulent practices that enticed students to borrow too much money for their
education. (FORM, Items 3 and 7)
In  2016,  the  school  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  went  out  of  business.
Applicant, aware of lawsuits against the school, thought he did not have to repay the loans
and they went into default in 2019.  In August 2021, the U.S. Department of Education
established a program of debt forgiveness for students of that school. On September 10,
2021, he was notified that his student loans had been forgiven.  Those accounts do not
appear on the most recent credit report available. SOR 1.a – 1.f are resolved for Applicant.
(Response to Form; FORM, Items 3 – 7)
SOR  1.g  –  1.i  are  three  medical  debts  totaling  $416  Applicant  incurred  during
periods of unemployment or under employment.  He claims he has repaid those debts,
but he has not supported his claims with any corroborating information. Those debts do
not appear on the most recent credit report, and they comprise less than one percent of
the  total  debt  alleged  in  the  SOR.  As  the  only  remaining  debts  at  issue,  they  do  not
present a disqualifying trustworthiness concern. SOR 1.g – 1.i are resolved for Applicant.
(Response to FORM; FORM, Items 4, 5 and 7)
Applicant disclosed in his e-QIP that has used marijuana with varying frequency
starting in 2018. However, during a personal subject interview (PSI) with a government
investigator  in  June  2020,  he  disclosed  that  he  first  used  marijuana  as  often  as  daily
starting in 2007, when he was in high school. His last documented use of marijuana at
the time he applied for a position of trust was in March 2020, after he had been employed
as a defense contractor for almost two years. A plain reading of the summary of his June
2020 PSI suggests that he continued to use marijuana after he submitted his e-QIP. In
October 2017, during a search incident to a traffic stop, he was arrested and charged with
possession  of  drug  paraphernalia,  to  wit,  a  small  pipe  used  to  smoke  marijuana.  The
charge was later dismissed. (FORM, Items 2, 3, 6 and 7)
Applicant occasionally uses marijuana in the privacy of his own home so that he
can relax. Marijuana also has a positive effect on his (unspecified) medical problems. As
to whether he will continue to use marijuana, he states that he would stop using the drug
if he were granted eligibility for a position of trust. In support of his marijuana use, he also
refers to the decriminalization of marijuana where he lives and the increasing instances
of marijuana decriminalization nationwide. (FORM, Items 2, 3 and 7)
Sua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I
controlled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal
law.  Guidance  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  (OASD)  in
February  2013  makes  clear  that  changes  in  the  laws  pertaining  to  marijuana  by  the
various states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the current National
Security  Adjudicative  Guidelines.  Because  federal  law  supersedes  state  laws  on  this
issue, Applicant’s use of marijuana, regardless of  location or medical justification  in his
state of residence, is illegal. Further, illegal drug use is prohibited in all federal workplaces
and on all military installations by civilian federal employees and by persons employed
for work on federal contracts.

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
about October 2008 to about April 2020;  SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that he used  cocaine with
varying frequency from about March 2016 to about December 2019; SOR ¶ 1.c alleges
that he used hallucinogenic mushrooms with varying frequency from about March 2013
to about August 2016; SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that he used prescription medication Adderall,
not prescribed to him, with varying frequency from about May 2013 to about May 2015;
and SOR ¶ 1.e alleges that he used LSD in about April 2013. He admitted all of these
allegations in his SOR Answer without explanation. (Items 1, 2)
These  allegations  came  to  light  when  Applicant  self-admitted  his  past  drug  use
on  his  May  21,  2020  SF-86  (Item  3).  On  June  15,  2020,  he  was  subsequently
interviewed  by  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator.  During  that
interview, Applicant provided further details regarding his past drug use. (Item 4)  In his
FORM response, he elaborated even further on his past drug use. (Item 5)
A summary of Applicant’s explanations follows:
Marijuana   –   Applicant  used  marijuana  all  throughout  high  school  from  2008  to
2011, “a handful of times, always with a group of peers, and always at a private home.”
He  smoked  marijuana  because  of  peer  pressure.  (Items  4,  5)  Applicant  continued  his
marijuana  use  during  college  from  2011  to  2015,  “a  few  times  a  week”  and  stopped
during the summer months because he had a job as a lifeguard and was drug tested.
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  during  college,  “as  an  escape  from  the  stress  of  school.”
(Items 4, 5) He did not smoke marijuana from 2016 to 2017 when he was employed as

current information available.
an   English   teacher  in   Thailand   (Items  4,5)   From   2017   to   2020,   Applicant   smoked
marijuana   “recreationally   to   help  relieve   him   from   stress  from   work  and   being
unemployed.” He stopped  using  marijuana  in  April 2020. (Items 4,  5) Applicant stated,
“Although  I have  a  history  of  using  marijuana  through  a  12  year period, the  amount  of
time  using  marijuana  during  that time  is miniscule and  my  dedication  to  not  using  it can
be seen in my drug tests that I never failed.” (Item 5)
Cocaine  –   Applicant  used  cocaine  “a  total  of four times  .  . . three  times  in 2016
and one lone time in 2019.” He stated a friend “convinced [him] to try it” in 2016 and the
second  and  third  cocaine  uses  were  “under  the  same  circumstances.”  The  last  time
Applicant  used  cocaine,  in  2019,  occurred  when  a  friend  “talked  [Applicant]  into  using
it.” (Items 4, 5)
Hallucinogenic mushrooms  –   Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms  “twice.”
The first time was in March 2013 when he was with a group of friends, and one of his
friends “pressured him into using it.” His second use of mushrooms occurred in Thailand
in August 2016. Another friend  “talked  him  into  . . .  order[ing]  a happy milkshake that
had hallucinogenic mushrooms in it.” (Items 4, 5)
Prescription   Adderall   –   Applicant  used  Adderall  while  in  college  “approximately
five  times to  help  him  focus on  studying  for school work”  from  May 2013  to  May 2015.
He  stated  he  used  Adderall  so  he  “could  study  and  focus  a  tad  more  than  normal.”
(Items 4, 5)
LSD   –  Applicant  used LSD  one  time  “in  about” April 2013. A  friend  “convinced”
him to try LSD. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant  stated  that  he  never  tested  positive  for  drugs,  does  not  currently
associate with anyone he used drugs with in the past, and does not intend to use drugs
in  the  future.  He  has  not  sought  professional  counseling  regarding  his  past  drug  use.
(Items  4,  5)  I  note  that  Applicant’s  last  drug  use  occurred  in  April  2020,  one  month
before he completed his SF-86 in May 2020, claiming that “he wanted control of his life
and that he had no intention of future use.” (Item  4) Applicant did not submit a signed
statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,
acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or  misuse  is  a  grounds  for  revocation  of
national security eligibility.
Applicant stated that he is “a loving friend, a reliable & trustworthy coworker, and
a  human  who  complies  with  other  laws  and  regulations.”  He  added  that  he  is  a
dedicated,  reliable  and  trustworthy  employee  and  would  like  to  have  a  clearance  to
become  a  more  effective  employee  and  enhance  his  position  within  his  company.
Applicant  stated  that  his  mistakes  from  the  past  are  no  reflection  of  who  he  is  today.

"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 25  years old. She  graduated  from  high  school  in 2014  and  college  with
a   bachelor’s  degree   in   2018.  She   is  not  married   and   has  no   children.  She   began   her
employment with a  federal contractor in January 2018. (Item  3)
Applicant completed her security clearance application (SCA) in March 2020. In it,
she disclosed that she was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in October 2018,
a misdemeanor. In her SOR answer, she explained she tested positive for marijuana at
the time of her arrest, but also had a blood alcohol level over the legal limit.  She pled
guilty  and  was  found  guilty  of  DWI  and  received  360  days  of  probation,  35  hours  of
community  service,  30  days  suspended  license,  court  fees,  and  she  was  required  to
attend an alcohol education class. As part of her probation, she received random drug
tests.  In  November  2018,  during  her  probation  in-processing,  she  tested  positive  for
marijuana. Applicant’s DWI was not alleged in the SOR. (Any derogatory information that
was not alleged will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered
in the application of mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis.) (Items 3 and
4)
Applicant  was  subjected  to  a  random  drug  test  in  February  2019,  while  on
probation. She tested positive for marijuana. (Item 4) She stated in her answer:
I take full responsibility for my lapse in judgment. No one person has been
more  disappointed  in  me  than  myself.  With  grace,  [my  probation  officer]
forgave  my  mistake  if  I  proved  through  my  actions  that  no  other  offense
would occur during my probation sentence. I am cognizant of the fact that
not too many offenders are offered this same level of forgiveness or mercy
that  I  was  given.  With  [my  probation  officer’s]  guidance  as  well  as  a
complete change of my mindset, I showed that I was worthy of moving past
this  offense  by  completing  the  terms  of  my  probation  sentence  with
complete respect for the people and system that showed me the brighter
path to take. The Honorable [Judge] relieved me of my probation sentence
in August 2019. (Item 2)
Applicant disclosed in her SCA that she used marijuana from about August 2014
to  August  2019.  She  stated  that  she  used  it  about  once  every  few  months  at  social
activities from 2014 to 2016. (Item 3) Regarding whether she intended to use marijuana
in the future, she stated:
I do not intend on using this controlled substance in the future because it is
illegal in the state of [X]. I am also not interested in hindering my ability to
efficiently  perform  my  job  at  a  professional  standard  or  jeopardize  my
judgment or ability to function as a safe and trustworthy member of society.
(Item 3)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in May 2020. During her
interview she reiterated that she began using marijuana in college when she was about
18 years old. She smoked or ingested it in a food substance until about August 2019. She
confirmed that she tested positive during her probation in-processing in November 2018.
She  did  not  disclose  to  the  government  investigator  that  she  had  also  tested  positive
during a random drug test for marijuana use in February 2019 while on probation.  She
stated  in  her answer  to  the  SOR  that  during  her phone  interview  with  the  government
investigator in May 2020, the February 2019 positive drug test was not brought up. (Item
2, 3) She stated:
This is solely due to the immense amount of shame and disappointment I
was  still  internally  marinating  in.  To  this  day,  I  deeply  regret  not  being
transparent with [the investigator]. This lack of transparency stemmed from
my inability to forgive myself for my transgressions. (Item 2)
Applicant  admitted   to   the   government  investigator  that  in  April  2020,  after
completing   her  SCA,   she   used   marijuana   at  a   friend’s  house.  She   was  offered   food
knowing  it had  marijuana  in it and  she  consumed  it. The  government  investigator queried
her about using  marijuana  while  employed  by  a federal contractor. She  advised  him  that
her employer did not conduct drug  tests,  so  she  was not worried  about being  fired  for her
marijuana  use. She  was asked  about her future intention  regarding  marijuana  use  and
whether she would commit to stop using it and she said she would stop. (Items 2, 4)

incorporated  those  admissions  into  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 29 years old. He has never married, but is currently engaged. He has
a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  February  2021.
From January 2020 to February 2021, he also worked for a defense contractor. He has
never held a security clearance. He completed his security clearance application (SCA)
in January 2020. (Tr. 6, 17; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant:  used  and  purchased  marijuana,  with  varying
frequency,  from  August  2011  to  October  2019;  was  arrested  and  charged  with
possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in January 2012; and was arrested for
driving under the influence of and possession of marijuana in August 2013. (See SOR
¶¶ 1.a - 1.c.)
Applicant  began  using  marijuana  shortly  after  graduating  from  high  school.  He
continued  to  use  it  sporadically  throughout  college.  He  acknowledged  that  he  made
“bad decisions” in that regard. He was arrested in January 2012 for using marijuana in
his dorm room when a resident advisor reported it. In August 2013, he was driving after
having  used  marijuana  and  was  stopped  by  law  enforcement  for  speeding.  He  was
suspected  of  driving  under  the  influence  of  marijuana  and  arrested.  His  use  of
marijuana was confirmed by a blood test. He pleaded guilty to a reckless driving charge
and satisfied all the terms of his sentence without incident. (Tr. 19-22, 27)
Applicant credibly testified that his last use of marijuana was in 2017. He stated
that the reference in his March 2020 statement to a background investigator that his last
use was in 2019 was a mistake. He has dissociated from his college friends with whom
he used marijuana. He has no intentions of using marijuana in the future. He reported
his marijuana use on his SCA and during his background investigation. (Tr. 22, 24-25;
GE 1, 2)
Applicant presented a letter from his work supervisor. His supervisor recognized
Applicant as a trustworthy employee and highly dependable. (AE B)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations, with
explanations. However, concerning the Guideline E allegations involving providing false
information or failing to provide truthful information, Applicant denies intentionally doing
either.  I  have  incorporated  those  admissions  into  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old.  He is married, but is currently separated. He has two
children,  ages  six  and  three.  He  has  a  high  school  diploma.  He  has  worked  for  a
defense contractor since March 2020 as an electronic maintenance technician. He has
never held a security clearance. He completed his security clearance application (SCA)
in May 2020. He was never briefed by the company facility security officer about filling
out the SCA. (Tr. 6, 20-22, 39-40; GE 1)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant:  used  marijuana,  with  varying
frequency, from August 2007 to the present; was arrested in January 2007 and charged
with  possession  of  marijuana  and  drug  paraphernalia;  and  intends  to  continue  using
marijuana.  (See  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c)  Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant:
deliberately failed  to  disclose  his 2007 marijuana  charge  when  completing his security
clearance  application  (SCA)  in  May  2020;  falsified  answers  to  a  defense  investigator
during  his  background  investigation  in  September  2020  when  he  deliberately  failed  to
disclose his 2007 charge  of  marijuana and paraphernalia possession;  and  deliberately
failed  to  disclose  his  illegal  drug  use  in  the  last  seven  years  when  completing  his
security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  May  2020.  The  drug  allegations  were  also
crossed-alleged under Guideline E. (See SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.d)
In January 2007, when Applicant was 18 years old and in high school, he and a
friend  had  used  marijuana  before  arriving  at  school  one  day.  School  officials  became
aware of possible marijuana use by Applicant and notified the police. When the police
arrived  on  scene,  a  search  of  Applicant’s  car  revealed  the  presence  of  a  marijuana
“bong” and a small amount of marijuana. The police arrested  Applicant and took him to
the police station. He was detained there for approximately two hours and then released
to  his parents.  He  was  never placed  in  a  jail cell.  He  does  not  recall going to  court to
dispose  of the  matter. He believes that it  was treated  similar  to  receiving  a  traffic  ticket
where  you   just  pay   a  fine.  He   did   not   hire  an   attorney   for this   matter.  His mother paid
the   fine   for  him.  Applicant  had   no   further  involvement  with   this  case.   While   the
Government’s  evidence   documented   Applicant’s  arrest,   there  is  no   Government
evidence reflecting the disposition of the  matter. (Tr. 23, 31-33; GE  2, 3)
Applicant admitted using marijuana infrequently in the past, aside from the 2007
school incident. He testified that his last use was in December 2019, before taking his
current  job.  His  use  of  marijuana  occurred  in  a  state  where  marijuana  use  has  been
legal, under state law, since 2012. Applicant asserted his use occurred during this time.
Before  being  interviewed  by  an  investigator  during  his  background  check,  he  was
unaware  that  marijuana  use  remained  illegal  under  federal  law.  He  has  never  held  a
federal job or federal contractor job before his current position. (Tr. 25-26, 32-33)
Also  during his background  check, he answered  questions regarding any future
use of marijuana. The investigator attributed the following statements to Applicant:
In  the  future,  [Applicant]  will  stop  using  if  told  by  his  current  employer  to
stop. However, [Applicant] has not been informed that he is not allowed to
use marijuana. If his employer asks, [Applicant] will be honest and report
that he is using marijuana. (GE 2)
Applicant  credibly  asserted  that  this  information  was  misconstrued  to  indicate  that  he
had a future intent to use marijuana. He denies having such intent. He now knows that
marijuana use is illegal under federal law and he has no intention to ever use it. Even if
marijuana use became legal under federal law, he would not use it. He is willing to take
regular drug tests to  verify his commitment not to use marijuana  in  the future. (Tr. 27,
34-36; SOR Answer)
When  Applicant  completed  his  SCA  in  May  2020,  he  did  not  intend  to  provide
false  information  about  the  2007  school-marijuana  incident.  He  truly,  albeit  incorrectly,
believed that his arrest was handled similar to a traffic ticket since he did not go to jail,
did not go to court, and his mother just paid a fine. In a similar fashion, Applicant did not
list  his  marijuana  use  within  the  last  seven  years  because  the  question  asked  for
“illegal”  drug  use  and  because  his use  of  marijuana  was  legal under state  law and  he
was  unaware  of  the federal prohibition of  marijuana use.  I  found  Applicant’s  testimony
credible. (Tr. 18, 23, 25-26, 28; SOR Answer)
During  his  background  interview  in  September  2020,  he  answered  negatively
when asked if he had been charged with any drug offense, even when he was young.
He answered this way because in his mind the 2007 school-marijuana incident was not
a  charged  offense.  Once  the  investigator  explained  that  a  police  report  showed
Applicant’s arrest, he fully disclosed the details of the incident. There is no documentary
evidence to show the disposition of this offense. This is also when the investigator made
him  aware  that  marijuana  use  violated  federal  law.  I  found  Applicant’s  testimony
credible. (Tr. 18, 23, 25-26, 28; SOR Answer)
Applicant produced his 2020-2021 work performance appraisal. He is rated at the
highest  level  in  almost  all  categories,  including  initiative,  dependability,  responsibility,
and compliance. His supervisor recognized Applicant as a highly valued team member
who sets a positive example. (AE A)

"SOR  ¶  1.a  alleged  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency,  from
about 2012 to 2013, after he was granted eligibility for a public trust position. SOR ¶ 1.b
alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, between 2015 and 2018,
after  he  was  granted  access  to  classified  information.  Applicant  admitted  both  SOR
allegations. His  SOR admissions are incorporated  as findings  of fact. After a  thorough
review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from
high  school  in  2003,  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2007,  and  completed  a  master’s
degree in 2009. He has never been married and has no children.
Applicant  has  worked  for  federal  contractors  holding  varied  positions  from
January  2010  to  present.  He  worked  as  a  program  analyst  for  a  federal  contractor
between January 2010 and March 2015. While in that position, he applied for and was
granted eligibility for a public trust position in March 2010. After holding the public trust
position, he illegally used marijuana at least four times between June 2012 and August
2013.  He  stated  that  he  smoked  marijuana  while  visiting  a  long-time  friend  in  another
state.
During a  May 13,  2015  interview  with  a  government  investigator, Applicant  was
questioned about his illegal use of marijuana. He indicated he was associating less with
his marijuana-using friend because he had a girlfriend. He told the investigator that he
did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (FORM, Item 3) following the background
investigation, Applicant was granted eligibility for a secret clearance in August 2015.
Applicant  worked  for  federal  contractors  as  a  senior  program  analyst  between
March 2015 and December 2019, and as a network data analyst between March 2020
and  January  2021.  He  started  working  for  his  current  employer  in  January  2021.  He
submitted his most recent SCA in August 2020.
During a September 23, 2020 interview with a government investigator, Applicant
stated that he used marijuana between June 2012 and December 2018. He estimated
using  marijuana  10  times  between  2015  and  2018  while  possessing  a  security
clearance. He used marijuana for recreational and experimental reasons. He claimed he
has  never  purchased  marijuana.  He  used  marijuana  with  a  long-time  friend  that
provided  the  marijuana.  Applicant  continued  to  associate  with  his  marijuana-using
friend. During his 2020 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he did not intend to
use marijuana in the future. Applicant presented no documentary evidence to show that
he  sought  or  received  any  medical  or  psychological  treatment  or  counseling  for
substance abuse.

"In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,  with  a  brief  narrative
statement. Applicant’s admissions and his statement  are incorporated into the findings
of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence  submitted, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 69  years old.  He and  his second  wife  have  been  married  since  1994.
He has  two  children  from  his first  marriage, and  three  stepchildren,  all  now  adults. (Item
3) Applicant has worked  as a  subject matter  expert for a  large  defense  contractor since
September 2020.  (Item   3  at  13) Previously,  from  August  2002   to  September 2020,  he
was the  president of  a  computer company  that provided  consulting  services to  the  U.S.
Navy   and   the   U.S.   Coast  Guard.  (Item   3   at  14)  Applicant  lived   and   worked   in  State   1
from  2002  to  2018. Since  January  2019, he  has lived  and  worked  in State  2. (Item  3  at
9-10)
Item  3,  Applicant’s  2020  SCA,  is the  only  exhibit  in  the  record.  When  asked on
his SCA if he had ever held a clearance before, Applicant reported that he either had a
background  investigation  or  been  granted  a  security  clearance  by  the  Coast  Guard.
When asked the level of his access granted, he checked “I don’t know.” (Item 3 at 41)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  SCA  that  he  has  used  medical  cannabis  daily  to
relieve  severe  head  pain  since  September  2018.  He  indicated  that  it  was  legally
prescribed  in  State  1,  where  he  used  to  live.  He  said  “I  still  need  this  for  pain  relief.”
(Item  3  at  39)  Applicant  answered  “No”  to  the  question  asking  about  illegal  drug  use
while possessing a security clearance. (Item 3 at 39) It is presumed that Applicant had a
background  interview  during  the  security  clearance  application  process,  as
is
customary, but the summary of that interview, which might provide additional details, is
not  in  the  record.  It  therefore  does  not  to  appear  that  Applicant  has  ever  held  a
clearance before, or holds one currently, as the Government would have noted if it were
so.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  concern  Applicant’s  admitted  use  of  marijuana  and  his
stated  intentions  to  continue  using  marijuana  in  the  future.  Applicant  admitted  both
allegations. In his Answer to the SOR, he said his marijuana is prescribed for a severely
painful  and  chronic  neurological  condition.  He  said  there  is  another  prescription
available  for  this  condition,  but  it  is  contraindicated  for  him,  since  he  takes  another
prescription for a heart condition. (Item 2) This is undocumented.
Applicant  said  “even  on  bad  days  I  limit  my  use  [of  medical  marijuana]  to  the
evening  to  help  me  sleep.  On  “light  days  (only one or two attacks,)”  he said that CBD
(cannabidiol)  “can  give me  sufficient relief and [I] have started to phase out the use of
marijuana when possible.” (Item 2)
Applicant  provided  no  further  information  in  his  SOR  response.  He  gave  no
updated  information  about  the  frequency  of  his  use  of  medical  marijuana  or  CBD.  He
did  not  document  his  medical  diagnosis,  his  need  for  medicinal  marijuana  or  a
prescription for it, nor did he assert its purported legality, under state law, either in State
1,  where  he  used  to  live,  or  State  2,  where  he  lives  now.  (Item  2)  Applicant  did  not
respond to the Government’s FORM.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f,
alleging multiple arrests for various offenses between April 2008 and November 2018. He
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a, alleging purchase and use of marijuana with varying
frequency from 2001 to about 2013 or 2014. He admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 3.a
and  3.b,  alleging  that  he  falsified  his  SCAs  in  February  2007  and  February  2017  by
deliberate failure to disclose his drug involvement. His admissions in his answer and at
the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 33-year-old vehicle refueler employed by a defense contractor since
October 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married, but
he has lived with a cohabitant since October 2016. He and his cohabitant have a daughter
who was born on December 17, 2019. (Tr. 19; AX F.)
Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in
2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014.  He testified
that  he  stopped  using  it  because  his  employer  started  random  drug  testing,  and  he
realized that it could jeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.)
In   Applicant’s   first  SCA  in  February   2007,   he   answered   “No”  to   the   question
whether he  had  used  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  within the  past seven  years. (GX  1
at 23.)  During   a  personal subject   interview   in  September 2018,   he   told   an   investigator
that  he  last  used  marijuana  at age  24.  (GX  3  at  4.) At the  hearing, he  testified  that he
could  not remember why  he did  not disclose his marijuana use  in his 2007  SCA.  (Tr. 27-
28.) He also testified  that there was no  reason  why  he  continued  to  use  marijuana  until
2014, except stupidity. (Tr. 30.)
Applicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with brandishing a firearm. His
arrest occurred after he was involved in a bar fight, and one of the participants told police
that  he  had  brandished  a firearm. The  police  stopped  him  as  he drove  away  from  the
scene of the fight. He testified that he has never owned a firearm. The police  searched
the  vehicle  and  did  not  find  a  firearm.  He  appeared  in  court  and  was  found  not  guilty
because the police were unable to find a firearm. (GX 4 at 3; Tr. 34-35.)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  February  2009  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana. After the police stopped him for speeding, they found marijuana in the center
console of his car. He appeared in court and adjudication was deferred. He was placed
on probation for one year, required to attend drug-education classes, and was subjected
to  random  urinalysis.  He  successfully  completed  his  probation  and  the  charges  were
dismissed. (GX 4 at 3; GX 5.)
In  November  2010,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana and having defective equipment on his car. After Applicant completed a period
of probation and drug classes, the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 12.) Applicant
did not disclose his drug-related arrests to his employer. He testified that he was unaware
of any requirement to disclose arrests to his employer. (Tr. 39.)
In  January  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  with  reckless  driving,  having  an  open
container  of  alcohol  in  his  car,  and  possession  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was  with  his
cousin, and he told the police that the marijuana was his, because he did not want his
cousin to get in trouble. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant was convicted of the open-container offense
and reckless driving, but the marijuana charge was dismissed. (GX 13.)
In  November 2013,  Applicant was arrested for  maliciously  causing  bodily  injury  to
his  cohabitant.   He  testified   that   his  cohabitant  was  driving   home   after  they   had   been
drinking  at a  bar, they  began  arguing, his cohabitant began  swerving, and  he  grabbed  the
steering  wheel to  keep  the  car from  striking  a  guardrail. The  police  officer  who  noticed  the
swerving  stopped  them,  noticed  a  cut  on  the  cohabitant’s forehead,  and  concluded  that
Applicant had  hit her in  the  face. Applicant spent a  week in jail after his arrest.  (Tr. 53-
55.) The  charge  was later reduced  to  assault and  battery. In  February  2014, the  court
found   “facts  sufficient to  find   guilt,” but deferred   adjudication  for one   year. The   charge
was dismissed in February 2015. (GX 7.)
Applicant  submitted  his  second  SCA  in  February  2017.  He  answered  “No”  to  a
question  whether,  during  the  last  seven  years,  he  had  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled substances. He also answered “No” to a question whether he had ever used
or  otherwise  been  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a
security clearance. (GX 2 at 26.)
Applicant did not disclose the February 2009 arrest, the November 2010 arrest, or
the January 2011 arrest in his February 2017 SCA. He testified that he did not disclose
his January 2011 arrest because he was told that his arrest record would be expunged.
(Tr. 31.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2018, he
told the investigator that he had never been charged with an offense related to alcohol or
drugs. He did not disclose his drug involvement until the investigator confronted him with
evidence  of  his  arrest  record,  which  included  drug  offenses.  He  then  disclosed  his
marijuana use, beginning in his teenage years and ending in 2014. He told the investigator
that he did not disclose his marijuana use while holding a security clearance because it
did not matter, since he had stopped using marijuana. He also told the investigator that
he did not disclose his marijuana use because he misread the question and thought he
was required to disclose only what had occurred in the last seven or ten years. (GX 3 at
12-13.) At the hearing,  he admitted that he did not disclose his marijuana involvement
because  he  was  nervous,  scared,  and  afraid  that  it  would  jeopardize  his  security
clearance or his job. (Tr. 31-33.)
In July 2018, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on his cohabitant.
Applicant testified that he was driving home after work after a long work day and spending
some time after work at a friend’s house. He fell asleep and hit the rear of an 18-wheel
truck.  His  cohabitant  came  to  the  scene  and  was  taking  him  home  when  they  began
arguing, because his cohabitant refused to take him to a hospital. Applicant became angry
and cracked the windshield of their car by punching it with his fist. His cohabitant called
the police, who concluded that they had been fighting. (Tr. 57-63.) A protective order was
issued, prohibiting Applicant from having any contact with his cohabitant for three days.
(GX 9.)
Applicant  testified   that  he   was  charged   and   the   protective   order  was  issued
because  his cohabitant “got all  hysterical”  and  told  the  police  that he  had  smacked  her.
He  admitted   that,   on   several  occasions,   he   grabbed   her  and   shook  her  after  she   said
things intended  to  provoke  him. (Tr. 50-51.) In  September 2018, he appeared  in court and
pleaded  no  contest.  The  judge  found  “facts sufficient to  find  guilt,” placed  Applicant on
probation, and  deferred  adjudication until September 2020. (GX  8.)  Applicant completed
his probation and the charge was dismissed. (Tr. 63.)
Applicant and his cohabitant stayed apart for about seven or eight months after his
arrest. (Tr. 64.) He testified that most of their arguments arose from his cohabitant’s desire
that he stay at home instead of socializing with friends away from home and her practice
of saying things that she knew would provoke him. He testified that the arguments and
physical violence stopped after their daughter was born. (Tr. 51-52.)
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI). His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was 0.17. In the jurisdiction where he
was arrested, jail time is mandatory for a BAC at or above 0.15. In March 2019, Applicant
was convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 175 days suspended, and a $250
fine.  He  was  placed  on  unsupervised  probation  for  one  year.  His  driver’s  license  was
restricted for one year, and he was required to install an ignition interlock on his vehicle.
(GX 10.) He served his jail sentence on weekends. (Tr. 66.) He completed eight weeks
of alcohol education in August 2019, and 16 weeks of group outpatient substance abuse
treatment in October 2019. He was allowed to remove the ignition  interlock in January
2020. The record of his treatment does not include a diagnosis or prognosis. (AX K.)
Applicant admitted that many of his arrests were related to alcohol, but he does
not believe he has an alcohol problem. He has reduced his drinking since the birth of his
daughter. He testified that he drinks mainly on weekends and limits himself to about two
drinks or two beers. (Tr. 67.)
A  friend  of  Applicant  who  has  known  him  for  12  years  submitted  a  statement
describing Applicant as “a very respectful and honest gentleman” and “the type of person
that will give you the shirt off his back.” The friend did not indicate whether he was familiar
with Applicant’s criminal record. (AX A.)
Applicant’s mother submitted a statement acknowledging that Applicant has done
things “that have not been pleasing to the way of his teaching,” but stating that he is now
a  family-oriented  person  who  is  striving  to  be  a  better  person.  His  mother  states  that
Applicant speaks often of his job and his love for it, and that he is proud of his 15 years
of service with his employer. (AX B.)
Applicant  submitted  photographs  of  a  clock  and  various  memorabilia  containing
the numeral 15, which he received in recognition of 15 years of service. (AX C, D, and E.)
Applicant’s cohabitant submitted a letter (AX H) including the following comments:
[Applicant]  has  gone  through  a  lot  of  changes  and  learning  experiences
whether good or bad. He strives to be a better person and a better man.
One  thing  I  can  say  is  that  [Applicant]  is  a  hard  worker,  dedicated  and
always willing to learn new things.
After separating  we  decided  to  work on  getting  back together and  decided
to  attend  church.  We’ve  made  a  commitment  to  attend  church and  hoped
that  our  relationship  would get  better. After all  these  years God  blessed  us
with   our  first  child.  [Applicant]   was  there  fully   committed   while   I  was
pregnant and  was there for most of my  doctor appointments as long  as his
job  permitted  it.  And  when  our  daughter was born I saw  the  look  on  his face
as a  proud  first-time  father.
He is an awesome father who is there for our daughter hand in hand. With
our work and busy schedules he makes sure that he is there to pick her up
from daycare and make sure that she is well taken care of at all times. He
loves our daughter with all his heart and he works very hard to make sure
she has everything that she needs.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the Guideline H allegation. I adopt
his admission as a finding of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  28  years  old.  He  is  single,  never  married,  and  has  no  children.  He
began  working  as  a  systems  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor  in  2017  and  that
contractor  was  acquired  by  his  current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  subject  to  the
drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. He holds a bachelor degree. He
is  seeking  a  security  clearance  for  the  first  time.  He  received  an  interim  security
clearance in approximately June 2018. (Tr. at 6, 27-28, 35; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  purchased  and  used  marijuana,  with  varying
frequency,  between  May  2014  and  October  2020,  while  holding  a  security  clearance.
The allegation is established by his security application admissions, his admissions to a
defense investigator during his background investigation, and his admission in his SOR
answer. (GE 1, 2; SOR answer)
Applicant described his marijuana use as beginning in approximately 2012, while
he  was  attending college.  He  acknowledged that his use at  the  time  was  illegal under
state  law.  He  asserts  that  the  remainder  of  his  marijuana  use  took  place  in  a  state
where marijuana use is legal under state law. The frequency of his marijuana use was
about four to six times a year. Applicant possessed a security clearance at the time of
these uses. He has continued his use of marijuana as recently as  in March 2021, after
the issuance of his SOR. He characterizes his use of marijuana as spiritual rather than
recreational. (Tr. 21, 23; GE 2)
Applicant admitted his marijuana use when he completed his security clearance
application (SCA) in September 2019. He also admitted in his SCA that he intended to
continue  using  marijuana  in  the  future.  When  questioned  by  a  defense  investigator
during his background investigation in October 2019, he again admitted his intention to
use  marijuana  in  the  future.  In  January  2021,  he  answered  interrogatories  concerning
his  answers  to  the  defense  investigator  and he  failed  to  address  whether  his  intent  to
use  marijuana  in  the  future  remained.  During  his  hearing  testimony,  Applicant
acknowledged  that  he  was  probably  briefed  by  his  employer  when  he  was  hired
concerning the illegality of using marijuana as an employee for a defense contractor, but
claims he  did  not  fully  understand  the  implications of that  information. He  further  claims
that  it was not  until sometime  in  early  2021  when  he  attended  a  training  class held by
his  employer  concerning   its  drug-use   policy   that  he   finally   realized   that  marijuana   use
violated   federal  law   and   his  employer’s  drug-use   policy.  It   was  at  this  time   that  he
revised  his intentions and  committed  to  not using  marijuana  in  the  future. In  Applicant’s
written   statement  of   intent  not  to   use   marijuana   in  the   future,  he   stated   that  his  full
recognition  of  the  legal implications of  his employer’s drug  policy  became  “very  clear”  to
him   when   he   reviewed   new   employee   training   materials  in  “early   2020.”  He  admitted
using marijuana  after that date. (Tr. 24-25, 27-30; GE 1-2; AE  B)
Applicant  offered  his  job  performance  appraisals  for  years  2018-2020.  They
reflected  overall  ratings  of  “significantly  exceeded” for 2018,  “exceeded” for 2019;  and
“exceeded” for 2020. As stated  above, he  also  offered  a  written statement, dated April
2021,  expressing  that  he  was  not  currently  using  marijuana  and  that  he  had  no
intentions to use it in the future. (AE A-B)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with
explanations.  I  have  incorporated  those  admissions  into  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  52   years  old.   He   has   a   high   school  diploma  and   two   years  of
technical school.  He has been married  four times (to wife  1 (W1): 1995-2014; W2: 2015-
2016; W3: 2017-2021;  W4: 2021  to  present).  He has two  children  and  two  stepchildren.
He has worked  for a  defense  contractor  as a  database  administrator  since  June  2019.
He served  in the  U.S. Army  for two  years and  received  an  honorable discharge  due  to
medical  reasons.   He   has  never  held  a   security   clearance.   He   completed   his   security
clearance application (SCA) in  July  2019.  (Tr. 6, 15-18; GE  1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant:  purchased  marijuana  from  December 2018  to  about
May   2019;   used   marijuana,  with   varying   frequency,   from   2012   to   May   2019;  used
mushrooms in December 2018; and  used  ecstasy  in August 2018.  (See  SOR ¶¶  1.a  -
1.d.)
Applicant credibly  testified  that his marijuana  use  was very  limited. When  he  was
17  years old,  his first exposure to  marijuana  was when  a  girl blew marijuana  smoke  in
his face.  He did  not ask her  to  do  it  at the  time. His only  other uses  of  marijuana  were in
approximately   2017   when   he   inhaled   it  from   an   e-pen   (device  used   for   smoking
marijuana), inhaled  it from  a  joint, ate  a  pastry  laced  with  marijuana, and  ate  marijuana
gummy   bears  on   two   occasions.  All   these   uses  occurred   in  2017,   when   he   was  living
with  W3  and  used  it  at  her urging. They  also  occurred  when  they  lived  in a  state  which
legalized   marijuana   use   under   state   law.  At   the   time   of  these   uses,  Applicant   did   not
have  a  security  clearance, or any  affiliation  with  a  defense  contractor. He has  not used
marijuana  since  beginning  to  work for his current employer. He voluntarily  disclosed  his
marijuana  use  to  a  defense  investigator when  interviewed  in September 2019. (Tr. 20-
23;  GE 2)
Applicant credibly testified that he purchased marijuana from December 2018 to
May  2019  as  gifts  to  W3.  She  is  approximately  12  years  younger  than  Applicant  and
was  very  involved  in  using  marijuana.  He  was  trying  to  make  her  happy  and  believed
that  his  purchases  of  marijuana  as  gifts  might  help  that  cause.  His  purchases  were
made at state-legalized marijuana dispensaries. Applicant and W3 separated in August
2019. He has not purchased marijuana since their separation and has no intention to do
so.  He  has  no  further  contact  with  her  other  than  to  pay  spousal  support  from  the
divorce.  He  provided  a  signed  sworn  statement  indicating  his  intent  not  to  use  or
possess  illegal  drugs  in  the  future  (he  understands  marijuana  is  illegal  under  federal
law) when he completed interrogatories sent to him by DOHA. (Tr. 18-19, 25, 28; GE 2)
When   completing   the   DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  also  disclosed   his  one-
time  use  of  psychedelic mushrooms (December 2018) and  ecstasy  (August 2018). He
testified   that he  used   these   drugs  while   on   vacation   and  on   his birthday   when   he   was
with  W3.  He has  not used  them  since  and  has no  intention  to  do  so. He  did  not  hold  a
security  clearance  nor  work for a  defense  contractor  at  the  time  of  these  uses.  (Tr.  26-
27; GE 2)

"Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security
clearance.  (Exhibit  3 at  Section 25)  He is employed as  a senior financial analyst  for a
large company doing business in the defense industry. He has had this job since about
January  2020.  Before  that,  he  worked  in  the  banking  industry  as  loan-document
specialist  and  then  an  operational-risk  consultant  during  2013-2020.  He  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in 2009. He is married with three minor children.
Applicant  disclosed  a  history  of  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse  in  his
initial  security  clearance  application  of  November  2019.  (Exhibit  4  at  Section  23)  His
drug  of  choice  was  marijuana,  for  which  he  reported  the  following:  (1)  he  used
marijuana  from  about  July  2008  to  September  2018;  (2)  he  described  the  nature,
frequency, and numbers of time used as recreational use, rarely used, and only used in
social  settings;  and  (3)  he  stated  that  he  had  no  intention  of  using  marijuana  in  the
future.  In  light  of  this  information,  the  DoD  CAF  made  a  favorable  eligibility
determination  and  granted  Applicant  a  security  clearance  at  the  secret  level  on
February 27, 2020. (Exhibit 5)
Applicant completed a December 2020 security clearance application as part of a
request for a top-secret security clearance. (Exhibits 3 and 5) Concerning marijuana, he
reported  the  following:  (1)  his  marijuana  use  extended  to  September  2020;  (2)  he
described  the  nature,  frequency,  and  number  of  times  used  as  “sleep  aid,  very  rare
use;” (3) he admitted using marijuana while possessing a security clearance; and (4) he
stated  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future,  as  he  was  focused  on
making healthy choices for him and his family. (Exhibit 3 at Section 23)
Applicant  confirmed  the  accuracy  of  his  marijuana  use  from  July  2008  to
September  2020  during  the  2021  background  investigation.  (Exhibit  6)  He  stated  that
his  marijuana  usage  was  rare,  estimated  at  two  to  three  times  annually,  and  he  used
marijuana  as  a  sleep  aid.  He  explained  that  as  a  resident  of  a  certain  state,  he
purchased  marijuana  from  a  dispensary  under  state  law.  Before  that,  he  obtained
marijuana  from  a  friend  that  he  no  longer  associates  with.  He  stated  that  he  used
marijuana  to  help  him  sleep  and for  relaxation  even  while  having  a  security  clearance
because he found traditional sleep aids ineffective. He no longer associates with people
with  whom  he  used  marijuana  in  the  past.  And  he  stated  there  is  no  likelihood  of
recurrence because he did not intend to use marijuana in the future.
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant emphasized the infrequency of his marijuana
use and that his primary use of marijuana was as a sleep aid. He stated that he decided
to quit using marijuana in September 2020 to promote a healthy lifestyle for himself and
his family. He stated he is focused on doing what is right for his family and his career. In
his job or role as a financial analyst, he denied having access to classified information
when he used or purchased marijuana between February 2020 and September 2020.
In his reply to the FORM, Applicant repeated the main themes  from his answer.
He  also  provided more  detail about  actions taken  in  quitting marijuana.  He  stated  that
he eliminated his seldom marijuana use as a sleep aid by adapting his daily routine  to
include regular exercise and a reformed diet. He also incorporates other activities, such
as reading and meditation, which allow him to relax before going to bed. As a result, he
stated  that  he  has  seen  an  overall  improvement  to  his  mental  and  physical  state.  He
further  stated  that  his  family  is  his  biggest  inspiration,  and  he  appreciates  the
importance of being a role model and leading by example for his children. He explained
that  the  positive  changes  in  his  personal  life  have  flowed  through  to  his  employment,
where  he has excelled  and received a promotion. In conclusion, he provided a signed
statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, and he
acknowledged that any future involvement or misuse would be grounds for revocation of
national security eligibility.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
1  Department  of  the  Navy   v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’  to a security  clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no
right to a security clearance).
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  granted  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  protecting  national  security.  In  Egan,  the
Supreme  Court  stated  that  the  burden  of  proof  is  less  than  a  preponderance  of
evidence.3  The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings
of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.6  An
Applicant  is  responsible  for  presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or
mitigate  facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.7  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8
Discussion
Under Guideline H for drug involvement  and substance misuse, the  concern as
set forth in AG ¶ 24 is that:
[t]he   illegal  use   of  controlled   substances,  to   include   the   misuse   of
prescriptions and  non-prescription  drugs, and  the  use  of  other substances
that   cause   physical  or  mental  impairment   or  are   used  in  a   manner
inconsistent  with   their   intended   purpose,  can   raise   questions  about  an
individual’s  reliability   and   trustworthiness,  both   because   such   behavior
may   lead   to   physical  or  psychological  impairment  and   because   it  raises
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply  with laws, rules,
and regulations. . .  .
In addition to the above matters, I note that the Director  of  National Intelligence
(DNI),  acting  in  his  capacity  as  the  Security  Executive  Agent  (SecEA),  issued  an
October  25,  2014  memorandum  concerning  adherence  to  federal  laws  prohibiting
marijuana  use.  In  doing  so,  the  DNI  emphasized  three  things.  First,  no  state  can
authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances Act,
which  identifies  marijuana  as  a  Schedule  I  controlled  drug.  Second,  changes  to  state
laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the

national security  adjudicative  guidelines. And  third, a  person’s disregard of  federal law
concerning  the  use,  sale,  or  manufacture  of  marijuana  remains  relevant  when  making
eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.
The   DNI   recently   updated   or  clarified   guidance   for  marijuana-related   issues  in
security  clearance  adjudications  via a  December  21, 2021  memorandum,  which states
in pertinent part the  following:
individual  may   be   relevant
[Federal]   agencies   are   instructed   that  prior  recreational  marijuana
use   by   an
to   adjudications   but  not
determinative.  The   SecEA   has  provided   direction   in  [the   adjudicative
guidelines]   to   agencies  that   requires  them   to   use   a   ""whole-person
concept.""   This  requires  adjudicators  to   carefully   weigh   a   number  of
variables  in  an   individual's  life   to   determine   whether  that  individual's
behavior raises a  security  concern, if  at all, and  whether that concern has
been   mitigated   such   that   the   individual  may   now   receive   a   favorable
adjudicative   determination.  Relevant  mitigations  include,  but  are  not
limited   to,  frequency   of   use   and   whether  the   individual  can   demonstrate
that  future  use   is  unlikely   to   recur,  including   by   signing   an   attestation   or
other such  appropriate  mitigation. Additionally, in light of  the  long-standing
federal  law   and   policy   prohibiting   illegal  drug   use   while   occupying   a
sensitive   position   or  holding   a   security   clearance,   agencies  are
encouraged   to   advise  prospective   national   security   workforce  employees
that they should refrain from any future marijuana  use  upon initiation of the
national  security   vetting   process,   which  commences  once   the   individual
signs  the   certification   contained   in   the   Standard  Form   86   (SF-86),
Questionnaire  for National Security Positions.9
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse;
AG  ¶   25(c)   illegal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  including
cultivation,  processing,  manufacture,  purchase,  sale,  or  distribution;  or
possession of drug paraphernalia;
AG  ¶   26(a)  the   behavior  happened   so   long   ago,  was  so   infrequent,  or
happened  under such  circumstances that it is  unlikely  to  recur or does not
cast  doubt  on   the   individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or   good
judgment; and
9  SecEA  Clarifying  Guidance  Concerning  Marijuana  for  Agencies  Conducting  Adjudications  of  Persons
Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated
December 21, 2021, at page 2.
AG  ¶   26(b) the   individual acknowledges  his or her drug   involvement  and
substance   misuse,  provides  evidence   of   actions  taken   to   overcome   this
problem,  and   has  established   a   pattern  of   abstinence,  including   but  not
limited  to: (1) disassociation  from  drug-using  associates and  contacts;  (2)
changing   or  avoiding   the   environment  where  drugs  were  used;  and   (3)
providing  a  signed  statement of  intent to  abstain from  all  drug  involvement
and   substance   misuse,  acknowledging   that  any   future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility.
The  evidence  shows  Applicant  used and purchased marijuana  on an  infrequent
basis  for  more  than  a  decade  during  2008-2020.  In  particular,  I  note  his  continued
involvement  with  marijuana  after  submitting  his  November  2019  security  clearance
application and while holding a security clearance, which was granted in February 2020.
His  last  known  use  of  marijuana  occurred  in  September  2020,  approximately  two  to
three months before submitting his December 2020 security clearance application for a
top-secret security clearance.
Although  the  evidence  shows  Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana  while
holding a security clearance during 2020, the same evidence does not establish that he
did so while granted access to classified information, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.
(Exhibit  5)  Note,  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  and  access  to  classified
information  are  different  concepts,  as  the  latter  requires  a  need  to  know.10  In  short,
eligibility  is  granted  by  the  central  adjudication  faculties  (e.g.,  the  DoD  CAF),  and
access  is  granted  by  the  individual  agencies.  Applicant  was  granted  eligibility  in
February  2020,  he  denied  having  access,  and  his  denial  is  unrebutted  by  the  record
evidence. Accordingly, on this basis, the disqualifying condition at AG ¶ 25(f) does not
apply, and the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are resolved in his favor.
I  have  considered  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  involvement  with  marijuana  as
outlined  in  the  findings of fact,  including  his last known  misuse  in September 2020. This
means he  used  marijuana  during  his employment with  a  federal contractor  engaged  in
the   defense   industry.  Any   illegal   drug   use   is  relevant   in  the   context  of   evaluating   a
person’s security  worthiness, but it is particularly  egregious if  it occurs during  the  course
of  employment with  a  federal contractor. Furthermore, it is likely  that his marijuana  use
in 2020 was in violation of  his employer’s drug-free workplace policy.

the   term   need   to  know   means   the   following:  “A   determination   made  by   a   possessor  of   classified
information   that  a  prospective  recipient,   in   the   interest  of   the   national   security,   has   a   requirement  for
access  to,  knowledge  of, or  possession  of  the classified  information  in order  to perform  tasks  or services
essential   to  the   fulfillment  of   an   official   U.S.  Government  program.  Knowledge  of,  possession  of,  or
access   to,   classified   information  will   not  be   afforded  to  any   individual   solely   by   virtue  of   the   individual’s
office, position, or security  eligibility.”  Id.  at Glossary, p. 82.
11  ISCR Case No. 16-00578 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2017) at 2 (noting the Drug-Free Workplace Act requires
federal contractors with a contract over $100,000 to establish certain drug-free workplace policies).
Applicant’s evidence of reform and rehabilitation is not persuasive. The one item
that  stands  out  in  his  favor  is  his  candor  and  willingness  to  disclose  his  drug
involvement and substance misuse during the security clearance process. But the credit
in mitigation is limited due to his continued marijuana use after he received a favorable
clearance decision in February 2020.
I  considered  the  two  mitigating  conditions  noted  above.  Neither  applies  in
Applicant’s  favor.  His  marijuana  use  occurred  over  a  period  of  years  and  is  recent
enough to be of concern. Likewise, Applicant’s signed statement of intent is outweighed
by  his  continued  marijuana  use  during  2020  while  holding  a  security  clearance.
Moreover,  his  continued  use  of  marijuana  in  2020  while  holding  a  security  clearance
was  dreadfully  poor  judgment.  It  simply  cannot  be  overlooked,  ignored,  or  explained
away.  Even  under  the  new  clarifying  guidance  issued  by  the  DNI,  Applicant’s
misconduct  continues  to  raise  serious  concerns  about  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,
and  good  judgment.  Although  I  have  no  axe  to  grind  with  marijuana  users,  I  do  have
concerns about applicants who affirmatively demonstrate they are unable or unwillingly
to follow rules applicable to those granted the privilege of a security clearance. That is
the situation here.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent standard, I have  doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified   or  sensitive   information.   In   reaching   this  conclusion,  I  weighed   the   evidence
as  a   whole  and   considered   if   the   favorable  evidence   outweighed   the   unfavorable
evidence  or  vice versa. I also considered  the  whole-person  concept.  I conclude  that he
has not  met his ultimate  burden  of persuasion  to  show  that  it is clearly  consistent with
the  national interest  to  grant him  eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline  H:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs  1.a  -- 1.b:
Subparagraphs 1.c -- 1.d:
For Applicant
Against Applicant
Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. National security eligibility is denied.

"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 27 years old. Since January 2020, he has been employed by a U.S.
Government contractor as an engineer.  In June 2017 he earned a bachelor’s degree in
aerospace engineering and has taken some post-graduate courses. After graduating from
college,  he  worked  for  a  different  U.S.  Government  contractor.  His  prior  employer
sponsored  him  for  a  security  clearance,  which  was  granted  in  October  2017.  He  is
unmarried, but has cohabitated with his long-time girlfriend since January 2020. He has
no children. (Tr. at 14-15, 23; AE G.)
SOR Allegations  and Answer
Paragraph  1,  Guideline  H  - The  SOR  sets  forth  three  allegations  regarding
Applicant’s  past  uses  of  marijuana.  They  were  in  2010  and  2011,  a  one-time  use  of
cocaine in May 2019, and a one-time use of marijuana in August 2019 after having been
granted a DoD security clearance.
In his Answer, Applicant admitted experimenting with marijuana seven-to-ten times
when he was in high school. He admitted the other two SOR allegations with clarifications.
He wrote that he “accidentally inhaled a very small amount of cocaine” in May 2019 at a
friend’s graduation party where cocaine was being used. He was curious about the smell
of  cocaine,  which  he  had  never  seen  or  smelled  before.  He  understood  from  a
documentary  he  had  seen  that  cocaine  smelled  like  kerosene.  He  was  offered  the
opportunity to inhale some cocaine, but he declined. Out of curiosity, he tried to smell it
and  inadvertently inhaled  a  small amount.  He felt  no  effect from this brief  exposure  to
cocaine. He disclosed the exposure in his SCA. Applicant also disclosed in his SCA his
accidental exposure to marijuana in August 2019. He explained in his Answer how that
occurred.  He  was  in  Las  Vegas  for  a  friend’s  birthday  when  a  woman  in  the  group
attending the celebration offered him the use of her vape pen. He took a couple of puffs.
He later learned that the pen contained THC. (Answer at 2; SCA at 65-68.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  used  marijuana  a  few  times  in  his
sophomore and junior years in high school. He stopped using marijuana before his senior
year in high school. He was focused then on his academic work and his applications for
college. He also changed the circle of friends with whom he spent time. He confirmed that
he has no intention to use illegal drugs in the future. (Tr. at 15-16, 24.)
Applicant again denied the SOR allegation 1.b that he used cocaine in May 2019.
He  testified  that  he  has  never  used  cocaine  in  his  life.  He  explained  that  this  incident
occurred  when  he  was  attending  a  friend’s  graduation  party  at  someone’s  house.  He
entered a bedroom to pick up his phone charger, which he had left in the room earlier in
the  day.  He  found  three  individuals  he  did  not  know  using  cocaine  in  the  room.  The
cocaine users offered Applicant the opportunity to inhale some of their cocaine, but he
declined. He was curious, however, about the smell of cocaine because he had seen in
a  documentary  that  cocaine  was  made  using  kerosene  and  had  a  heavy  smell  of
kerosene. He testified:
I inadvertently  got an  extremely  small  amount  on  me  while  inhaling  to  sniff  to  see
if  it smelled  of  kerosene. I never ingested  any  of  it. I quickly  got it off  [me] and  left
the room.
(Tr. at 17.) He testified that a small amount of cocaine got on the tip of his nose and he
“instantly got it off”  using his shirt sleeve. He insisted that no cocaine ever entered his
nose or body. (Tr. at 15-30, 39.)
Applicant also testified about the marijuana incident. He said that he mistakenly
assumed  that  the  vape  pen  he  was  offered  in  August  2019  was  a  “normal  nicotine-
flavored  pen.”  He  took  two  puffs.  He  learned  later  that  the  pen  contained  marijuana.
Before using the vape pen, he only sensed a fruity smell. He did not feel any effects of
the marijuana after using the pen. He does not smoke cigarettes, but he has tried vape
pens used by his friends. Applicant did not know the person who offered him the  vape
pen. It was the first time he met her. Applicant was in Las Vegas to celebrate his friend’s
birthday with a larger group  and the woman with the vape pen was part of  that group.
Neither Applicant’s friend nor his girlfriend use marijuana. He had no reason to suspect
that the vape pen contained illegal drugs. (Tr. at 15-20, 30-39.)
Applicant formally self-reported both the cocaine and the marijuana incidents after
talking to his security officer. They had that discussion in May 2019 when Applicant was
preparing the SCA to apply for  a higher-level security clearance. He did not report the
incidents earlier because he did not believe either one met the threshold requirements for
self-reporting because both incidents were unintentional and he did not actually inhale
any cocaine. (Tr. at 17, 19-20, 24-25, 36, 38.)
Applicant testified that he lives a “very ethical and honest life.” He is committed to
fulfilling  his  responsibilities  to  remain  eligible  to  hold  a  security  clearance.  I  found
Applicant’s  testimony  generally  to  be  credible.  I  further  found  Applicant’s  testimony
credibly  supported  his  accounts  regarding  the  two  2019  drug  incidents  as  well  as  his
statement of his values. At the hearing, he impressed me as a young man with maturity
and candor well beyond his years. (Tr. at 23.)
Mitigation
Applicant’s whole-person evidence describes him as a person of character. During
his college years, he volunteered to contribute his free time to a program called Great
Minds in STEM. This program served middle school and high school students from lower
income neighborhoods. The volunteers taught engineering principles and encouraged the
students’ interests in engineering and careers in engineering. He is also actively involved
in his church. He provided five character reference letters from friends and co-workers
who  know  him  well.  They  all  praise  his  intelligence,  trustworthiness,  honesty,  and
outstanding work ethic. One reference noted that he obtained scholarships and became
the first in his family to earn a bachelor’s degree. His work performance evaluations in the
record also describe Applicant as a person who is passionate about his work and who
has high ethical standards. (AE J; AE K; AE O; AE Q; AE R.)
Applicant also submitted a signed statement of his intent to abstain from all drug
involvement and substance misuse. His statement also contains an acknowledgment that
any violation of his pledge not to use illegal drugs in the future would be grounds for the
revocation of national security eligibility. (AE D.)

"Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  earned  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  June  2010.  He  applied  for  and  obtained  a  security  clearance  in

never been married but lives with a cohabitant. He has no children. (Items 3, 4, 5)
In  2009,  Applicant  used  marijuana  once.  He  abstained  from  illegal  drugs  for
approximately six  years.  Then,  from  June  2015  to  January 2021,  Applicant  consumed
marijuana  edibles  for  recreational purposes  and  to help  him  relax  and  sleep.  He  used
marijuana about once every two  months for a  total of  about five  times over  five  and a
half  years.  Applicant  used  marijuana  at  home  while  alone  or  with  his  cohabitant.  He
used  marijuana  while  holding  a  security  clearance  throughout  this  period.  There  is  no
evidence that Applicant reported his 2015 to 2021 marijuana use to his employer. (Items

Applicant  reported  his  relevant marijuana use  on  the Questionnaire for National

marijuana in the future. (Items 3, 5)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  illegal  consumption  and
purchase  of  marijuana  edibles from  2015  to 2021,  while  he  held  a  security  clearance.
The  SOR  also  alleged  Applicant’s  stated  intent  to  continue  to  use  marijuana.  In  his
response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he illegally used marijuana while possessing a
clearance, denied the marijuana purchase allegation, and denied that he would continue
to use marijuana in the future. He claimed that while he held a security clearance when
he used marijuana, he was not actively using his clearance  throughout this period. He
claimed that he never purchased marijuana or other illegal drugs, and that he no longer
intends  to use  illegal drugs  in  the future.  He  asserted  that  he  was  confused about  the
propriety of using marijuana with a clearance because it is legal under state law where
he resided.1 (Items 1, 2)
In  Applicant’s response  to  the  FORM, he made legal arguments and asserted a
willingness  to  undergo  random  drug  testing.  He  provided  a  December  2021  negative
drug test, a positive character reference from his cohabitant, and a signed statement of
intent  to  abstain  from  all  illegal  drug  and  substance  misuse.  He  also  provided
documents that he claimed support his legal arguments. (Item 6)

"Applicant  is  49  years  old  and  was  married  to  his  first  wife  from  2005  until  they
divorced in 2015. He remarried in 2018. He has an eleven-year-old daughter from his first
marriage and three teenage stepchildren who are ages 14, 17, and 18. Applicant studied
electrical  engineering  during  college,  achieving  over  120  credit  hours,  but  did  not
graduate  with  a  degree.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  (Company  A)  since
March 2003, and he currently works as an engineering manager. Applicant was granted
a secret security clearance in approximately 2010. (GE 1-2; Tr. 10-11, 23-26, 33-35)
Applicant admitted using marijuana from February 2015 to April 2020, as alleged
in  the  SOR,  but  denied  using  marijuana  after  having  ever  been  granted  access  to
classified information. He denied ever having access to classified materials, stating in his
answer to the SOR, “For as long as I have held a clearance I have never asked our [facility
security officer] FSO to establish a need to know and as such have never been granted
access to classified materials.” (Answer; AE A; Tr. 47)
Applicant  testified  that he  first  used marijuana  in 1993,  during his junior year of
college. He used it every other week or monthly until he started working for Company B
in 1996 or 1997, when he stopped using marijuana because it no longer benefited his life.
He next used marijuana once in approximately 2006, shortly after he married his first wife.
While she regularly used marijuana, he did not, as he could be subjected to drug testing
by his employer, for whom he continues to work. Applicant stated that he disclosed this
one-time use in his 2010 SCA. The Government did not offer this document as evidence.
(Tr. 25-28, 35-37, 39)
On November 30, 2020, Applicant submitted his SCA and disclosed that he used
marijuana four to six times between February 2015 and April 2020. He claimed he used
marijuana  due  to  his  divorce  and  not  having  his  daughter  during  the  holidays.  When
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in December 2020, he confirmed
that he used marijuana four to six times in the previous seven years, and that most of the
use occurred by smoking it through a pipe, although he did consume an edible on one
occasion. He used marijuana recreationally, at home, while he was relaxing, and his wife
obtained  it  from  a  friend.  He  did  not  clarify  which  wife  had  obtained  the  marijuana.
(Answer; GE 1 at 62-63; GE 2; Tr. 28-30)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that he used marijuana approximately two times
in  2015,  once  with  his  first  wife  and  once  with  a  friend.  He  testified  that  his  next  use
occurred  over  the  holidays  in  2019  with  his  second  wife,  and  he  attributed  his  use  to
anxiety and the stress of dealing with a blended family. Applicant also consumed an edible
form of marijuana provided to him by his current wife in April 2020. He attributed his most
recent usage to stress and anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Applicant did not
purchase  the  marijuana  that  he  used, his wives and  a  friend  provided  it for him.  (Tr. 28-
30, 39-40)
As a result of Applicant’s 2015 divorce, his subsequent marriage, and the stress
of blending children from two families, he started to attend counseling in 2014 to address
his anxiety. He has continued to attend counseling sporadically for the past seven years
and  sought  other  avenues  such  as  exercise,  meditation,  and  social  interactions  to
address his stress and anxiety, but he continued to use marijuana occasionally until April
2020. (AE F-G; Tr. 20, 24, 32-33, 51)
Applicant’s employer has never drug tested him, but his employer could test him
at any time. He stated that company policy is that employees are not to be impaired while
they are at work, but he is unsure if there is a policy against illegal drug use and marijuana
use. In Applicant’s state of residence, medicinal and recreational marijuana use is illegal.
He did not report his 2015 to 2020 marijuana use to his supervisor or FSO, but he knew
his use was inconsistent with holding a DOD security clearance. At the hearing, during
his  interview,  and  in  his  2020  SCA,  Applicant  stated  that  he  does  not  intend  to  use
marijuana in the future. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 31-32, 37-42)

Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  three  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
Applicant  has  used  marijuana  during  two  separate  periods.  The  first  period
extended from  approximately 2009  to  2014. During  this  period,  he  was  attending  high
school and then college. Applicant stated he used marijuana “sparingly” during that time,
“approximately 10 or so  times-ish.” Applicant set forth his minor marijuana use in great
detail during an interview with a Government investigator in January 2021. (Government
Exhibit 3 at 7-8; Tr. 18, 23.)
Applicant began work for his current employer in 2017. He filled out his first e-QIP
in  November  2017.  Shortly  after  that  he  obtained  a  security  clearance.  (Government
Exhibit 1; Tr. 29.)
Applicant did  not  use  marijuana  for several years. He resumed  using  marijuana  on
a   very   infrequent basis  during   2019  and   2020.  Applicant  used  marijuana   an   additional
three  times  during  this  period. Applicant  testified  that  he  realized  the  continuing  Federal
prohibition   against   marijuana   use   when   filling   out  his  second   e-QIP   in  October  2020.
Applicant has not used  marijuana  since  June  2020  and  evinced  a  credible  intent not to
use marijuana  in the future.  (Government  Exhibit  2; Government Exhibit 3  at  7-8; Tr. 22-
29, 38-39.)
With regard to his second period of marijuana use Applicant stated in his Answer:
[Applicant’s state  of  residence] had  lessened   the   laws on  Marijuana  but I
did not  take  into  account the  Federal regulations which I  fully  admit is my
mistake. I do   not plan   to   use   Marijuana   in   the  future  in  order   to   keep  my
security   clearance   access,  especially   since   the   nature   of my   most  recent
use was infrequent.
Paragraph 2  (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  conduct  that  shows  poor  judgment,  untrustworthiness  or
unreliability. Applicant admitted both the allegations under this paragraph.
2.a.  The  Government  alleges in this  subparagraph  that the  Applicant’s drug   use
history, as set forth  under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E.
2.b   As   stated,   Applicant   filled   out  an   e-QIP   in   November  2017.   (Government
Exhibit 1.) Section  23  of  the  questionnaire  asked  Applicant about his  drug  use  history.
That  section  asked  whether Applicant had  used  controlled  substances during  the  previous
seven  years. Applicant  stated, “Yes.” Applicant further explained  he  had  used marijuana
in 2009  and  2010, “When  I was in junior college  I had  tried  it a  couple times  with  friends
and   never  after  that.”   This  statement  was  false  in  that  Applicant   had   actually   used
marijuana  about ten times during  his college  years, ending in  2014.
Applicant filled out a second questionnaire in October 2020. (Government Exhibit
2.) In answering the same question in Section 23 about his drug use over the past seven
years Applicant again stated, “Yes.” He further indicated  that  the  usage  extended from
2009 to 2020. Applicant went on to explain, “When I was in college I had tried it multiple
times  with  friends  and  have  smoked  it  occasionally  in  recent  years.”  This  was  a  more
accurate statement of his use. The questionnaire also asked why he did not intend to use
illegal drugs in the future. He stated, “I would not want the previous usage to effect [sic]
my career advancement by not receiving a TS clearance.”
Applicant admitted that he made a conscious mistake on his initial e-QIP when he
set forth the time of his usage incorrectly. He freely admitted this error in judgment at the
hearing.  (Tr. 29-36.)

Applicant  submitted  a  letter  from  his  supervisor.  The  supervisor  stated,  “I  have
never experienced any issues in judgment or any questionable practices in day-to-day

From  October  2016  until  July  2020,  Applicant  used  marijuana  for  recreational
purposes.  During  this  time  period,  he  used  marijuana  about  once  every  one  to  three
months  at  most,  while  there  were  six  or  seven  month  gaps  when  he  did  not  use
marijuana at all. (Items 2, 3, 4)
From  May  2018  until  about  August  2019,  Applicant  used  LSD  in  order  to

motivation.”  During  this  period  of  time,  he  used  LSD  approximately once  every  five  to
six weeks. (Items 2, 3, 4)
Applicant reported his marijuana and LSD use on the Questionnaire for National
Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in February 2021. He discussed his marijuana
and LSD use when he was interviewed for his background investigation in March 2021.
He  stated  that  he  will  not  use  marijuana  in  the  future  unless  it  becomes  legal  under
federal law. He stated that he will not use LSD again as he has “no reason nor desire to
return to it.” Applicant stated that he is willing to undergo drug testing in order to prove
that  he  is  not  using  illegal  drugs.  He  provided  no  evidence  of  a  completed  drug  test.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  probably  still  associates  with  people  who  use  illegal
drugs, but they do not discuss drug use, so he cannot be sure. (Items 3, 4)

Applicant  noted  in  his  Answer  that  in  one  state  marijuana  was  legal  and  noted
that  his  listed  usage  of  illegal  drugs  may  be  greater  than  his  actual  usage.  He  added
that  he  does  not  go  looking  for  controlled  substances,  “but  there  were  times  when  he
did not say “No. when drugs were offered.” (Item 2) He also talked about peer pressure
in  terms  of  socialization.  He now knows  that it  is not good for him and  he  will not use
again.  He,  however,  did  not  relate  any  of  his  illegal  drug  usage  to  any  federal

During  his  February  12,  2021  subject  interview,  Applicant  provided  details

The original SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with
varying frequency from about July 1993 to about January 2019; and he used cocaine with
varying frequency from about February 2008 to about January 2019. Under Guideline G,
the  SOR  alleges  Applicant  was  arrested  in  another  state,  in  about  December  2004,
charged and convicted of DUI; and he was arrested in about August 2017 and charged
with DUI and open container of alcohol in a vehicle. Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-
alleges the previous SOR allegations, and that he was arrested in about March 2015 and
charged with trespassing, a charge in which he pleaded guilty; and in September 2016,

and personal safety, issued by his current state of residence in 2013 and renewed it in
2018. It remains valid until 2023. The CFP application (Rev 8/19) states:
You   are  not  eligible   to   carry   a   Concealed   Firearm   Permit  if   any   of   the
following   apply:  .  .  .   (6)  You   have   habitually   used   intoxicating   liquor  or  a
controlled  substance  to  the  extent that  your normal faculties are impaired,
including DUI convictions within five previous years and Medical Marijuana
Patients. (AE B)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed his use of marijuana “occurred on my
personal  time.”  However,  he  admitted  that  in  2006,  he  was  working  security  and
bodyguard jobs in nightclubs and “on the entertainment scene” and “was exposed to the
good and the bad that went along with it.” He stated that he initially rejected cocaine that
was  offered  to  him,  but  eventually  gave  in  and  used  it  “to  understand  the  effects  and
correlate it with the behaviors [he] experienced as a security/bodyguard.” At times it was
“offered to [him] from someone [he] or a client of [his] was interacting with.”
Applicant  testified  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  and  cocaine  on  or  about
January 1, 2019, partly as a result of a new year’s resolution. Coincidentally, he began
working  in  an  armed  security  position  in  January  2019  that  required  obtaining  a  state
private investigator license from a state licensing board to carry a firearm, and he worked
armed security for several medical marijuana dispensaries as well as jewelry and trade
shows.  He  also  applied  for  a  security  clearance  in  August  2019.  In  a  post-hearing
submission,  Applicant  provided  a  signed  notice  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement and substance misuse. He also stated he has never failed an employment,
pre-screening, or random drug test, and that he has disassociated from acquaintances
with whom he used drugs in the past. (AE B)
In December 2004, Applicant was arrested in another state for DUI at an impaired
driving  checkpoint.  He  was  convicted  in  2005,  placed  on  probation,  and  required  to
complete alcohol-related classes. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he was driving
home from  a work-related  holiday  party.  He  said  he  “gained  valuable  insight from  that
experience.”
In 2017, Applicant was again arrested for DUI and open container of alcohol after
he drove into a tree after returning from a bachelor party at 5 a.m. He was the “designated
driver” for his friends during the evening. He testified that he had a “shot or two” during
the evening, but denied that alcohol contributed to the accident. Of note, in his answer to
the SOR, he admitted to  having “a  drink a  couple drinks  [sic]  with  dinner”  at  a  casino.
When the police found an open container and a closed beer in his armrest, he stated they
were placed there without his knowledge. He said he “dozed off a mile, or less, from home
assumedly because [he] was in familiar surroundings and [his] body was  comfortable.”
He was given a field sobriety test at the scene but he refused a breathalyzer test because
he “felt their demeanor and attitude switch towards [him] and [he] no longer trusted the
process.” (Ans.) He was arrested for DUI and open container. The police suspected drunk
driving and obtained a warrant to take blood samples, but it was hours after the accident.
Applicant stated that his subsequent blood tests showed his blood alcohol level was under
the legal limit. He was not ultimately charged with drunk driving, but was found guilty of
failure to maintain a lane and having an open container of alcohol in his vehicle.
In  2015,  Applicant  was  charged  with  trespassing.  He  testified  that  he  was  at  a
casino  when  he  had  a  vocal  disagreement  with  a  card  dealer  and  management  over
errors he perceived were committed by the table dealer. Of note, he did not mention his
disagreement  with  the  dealer  during  his  PSI,  rather  he  stated  he  was  drinking  while
playing a table game “without incident” when the table game manager asked him to stop
playing and leave. He believed he was being treated unfairly and disrespected, and he
refused to leave the casino even though the manager and security officials told him they
would call the police. He believed it was a “peaceful protest” for the way in which he was
treated. Applicant was arrested, offered a deal to plead no contest, and was convicted of
trespass. In his answer to the SOR, he claimed the incident was a result of racism and
other  factors,  was  asked  “one  last  time  to  leave  or  be  arrested,”  and  that  he  was
“comfortable protesting and standing up for what [he] believed was right.” He noted that
since  then,  he  has  “meditated  and  looked  back  on  the  situation  and  understands  that
there are some things that are out of [his] control and it is better to remove [himself] from
those situations than to add fuel to the fire.”
Applicant married his former spouse in May 2016, but they lived together before
marrying. He moved out in October 2016, and their divorce was final in December 2016.
In  a  September  2016  police  report  to  her  local  police  department,  Applicant’s  former
spouse accused him of choking her and shaking her in July 2016 while they were at his
mother’s home in another state. She also accused him of pulling her hair and choking her
during  an  argument  in  September  2016,  while  they  were  again  visiting  his  family  in
another  state.  She  did  not  report  the  July  incident  because  they  were  at  his  mother’s
home  in  another  state,  and  that  she  thought  he  would  change.  She  reported  the
September incident about four days after it occurred, apparently after returning to their
state  of  residence.  No  arrest  was  made  because  the  incidents  occurred  in  another
jurisdiction.
In  the  same  police  report,  Applicant’s former spouse  also  alleged  an  incident  in
August  2016,  where  they  were  drinking  at  a  bar when  he  began  arguing  with  her  and
made a scene. She left the bar and Applicant followed. He blocked her from entering their
vehicle and continued arguing. He became angry and pulled her hair and yelled without
letting it go. At some point, he drew his firearm, pointed it at himself, and yelled “what do
you  want me  to  do, blow  my brains out”?  She  did not report the  incident at the  time  it
occurred because she thought he would change.  Applicant admitted drinking that night
and taking out his firearm and threatening to kill himself, but denied pulling her hair. He
also denied the alleged strangling incident in September 2016, and said he never had a
physical encounter with her except “face-to-face encounters.”
Applicant’s  current wife’s cousin and his supervisor testified on  his behalf. They
generally  attested  to  his  reliability  and  good character,  but  his  wife’s  cousin,  a  military
member that has known him for three years, was unaware of any issues with alcohol or
drugs.  Neither were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant  also submitted  character
letters from  co-worker  and  a  training director/apprentice  coordinator. Both  attest  to  his
work ethic, positive attitude, reliability, accountability, and willingness to take on greater
responsibilities  and  to  teach  new  apprentices,  but  neither  mentioned  specific  SOR
allegations. Additionally, Applicant’s current spouse wrote a strong, supportive letter on
his behalf, attesting to his judgment, kindness, reliability, and compassion. Applicant also
noted that after his divorce in 2016, he enrolled in personal counseling with a licensed
therapist  to  address  his  emotional  and  mental  concerns.  No  records  of  diagnosis  or
treatment were submitted from these counseling sessions.

Drug  Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d allege, and Applicant admitted that he purchased and
used  marijuana  and/or  THC-infused  CBD  edibles  with  varying  frequency  from  about
August  2010  to  about  March  2019.  This  includes  marijuana  use  while  a  federal
government employee from August 2010 to August 2012.
Applicant used marijuana from about 1997 until 2020. (Tr. 18, 21) When he was in
college, he smoked marijuana on about a weekly basis. (Tr. 18-19) He usually purchased
the  marijuana  he  used.  (Tr.  19)  In  August  2010,  he  began  his  federal  government
employment. (Tr. 20) In 2020, he reduced his marijuana use to about once a month. (Tr.
21)   There  was  no   evidence   presented   of   the   sensitivity   of   his  federal  government
employment.
Applicant  did  not  possess  or  use  marijuana  from  early  2010  until  around  2011
because of  his federal government employment. (Tr. 22, 24) He learned there  was  no
drug  testing  at  his  federal  government  employment,  and  he  decided  to  resume  his
marijuana possession and use. (Tr. 23) He worked for a university from September 2012
to February of 2016. (Tr. 23) At his hearing, he claimed that in late 2011 or early 2012,
he stopped using marijuana again because he was looking for new employment, and he
did not possess and use marijuana until late 2015 or early 2016. (Tr. 23-26)
In July 2017, Applicant started his current employment, and since early 2018, he
has  been  eating  THC-infused  CBD  edibles,  which  he  purchased  from  marijuana
dispensaries.  (Tr.  27)  His  most  recent  use  of  a  THC-infused  CBD  was  in  August  or
September 2020. (Tr. 33-34, 43; SOR response at 2) He is aware that the THC content
of  the  CBD  gummies  he  consumes  exceeds  the  Department  of  Agriculture  authorized
level  for  hemp  products  of  .3  percent.  (Tr.  28-29,  49)  As  such,  his  possession  and

SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  he  used  a  prescription  opioid
without  a  prescription  in  August  2019.  He  used  his  spouse’s  prescription  opioid  twice
when he had a painful molar and a painful knee. (Tr. 35)
As to his history of illegal drug use, Applicant said in a written statement submitted
at his hearing:
Simply   put,   since   my   professional  career  started   in   2006,  I  have   never
allowed  drug  use  to  be  a  limiting  factor in my  employability  or professional
advancement.  If  I’m  unable to  use  due  to  my  employment status or (as of
late)  if   I  cannot  acquire   recreational  CBD  or  THC   products  from   a   state-
sanctioned  dispensary, I simply refrain  from  using.  (AE A)
As for his future use of illegal drugs, Applicant said:
So  I'm  [an]  adult now  with  a  kid  and  a  mortgage. I don’t  need  to  use  CBD
products  or  anything  really, and  I  haven’t.  Once  again,  it’s not  a  big  deal.
And  if  it’s going  to  affect my  employment,  I  can’t risk even  5  percent of  my
job  and  my  son  and  my  mortgage  and  everything. I’m  risk averse and  I can’t.

Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.d allege Applicant failed to fully disclose on his March 17,
2019  SCA  the  information  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.e  concerning  his  marijuana
possession and use, his consumption of THC-infused CBD gummies, and his abuse of a
prescription opioid. He indicated on his SCA that he used marijuana; however, he limited
his  marijuana  use  to  states  where  marijuana  use  was  legal.  In  fact,  he  resided  in  and
possessed marijuana in several states where possession of marijuana was not legalized
under state law at the time he possessed it.
At his hearing, Applicant said his objective when he completed his 2019 SCA was
to disclose he was limiting his marijuana use to places where it was legal under state law.
(Tr. 36-37) He said “if [he] could get it legally at low risk, [he] will, and [he] will use edible
typically high CBD, low THC. (Tr. 37) He said he did not have “vivid memories of using
regularly.” (Tr. 40) When he answered the question on his SCA about drug use, he may
have  been  downplaying  his  drug  use.  (Tr.  46)  He  conceded  that  sometimes  he  used
marijuana outside these “limited parameters.” (SOR response at 2)
Applicant disclosed for the first time during his August 26, 2019 Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) interview that he used his spouse’s opioid prescription twice to treat
his painful tooth and knee. He indicated he wanted to be fully transparent about his opioid
use. (Tr. 35-37; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 2.e alleges Applicant failed to disclose on his September 7, 2010 SCA the
information  in  SOR  ¶¶ 1.a,  1.b,  and  1.c about  his marijuana  and/or THC-infused  CBD
use.  In  2010,  Applicant  was  applying  for  federal  government  employment.  He  said  he
intentionally answered no to the questions about marijuana possession and use during
the  previous seven  years because  he  “wanted  to  ensure  [he] received  the  job”  and  he
wanted to “ensure [his] employability.” (Tr. 22; AE A at 1) However, in his SOR response,
he claimed the omission of his marijuana involvement was unintentional and an oversight.
(SOR response at 3)
SOR ¶ 2.f cross alleges the drug involvement in SOR ¶ 1.b while he was a federal
government employee as a personal conduct security concern.
During his August 26, 2019 OPM interview, Applicant said he smoked marijuana
three or four times a week when he was in college from 1998 to 2003. (GE 1 at 12-13;
GE 3 at 7) He used marijuana once a week from 2008  to 2010 while he was attending
the university where he received his master’s degree. (GE 1 at 13; GE 3 at 7) From 2012
to  2015,  while  employed  at  another  university,  he  used  marijuana  on  a  weekly  basis,
mostly at home. (GE 1 at 14; GE 3 at 7) From 2016 to 2017, he used marijuana two or
three times a week. (GE 1 at 9-10; GE 3 at 7)
From 2017 to 2019, Applicant used marijuana once or twice a week. (GE 1 at 9;
GE 3 at 7) He reduced the frequency of his marijuana use from 2017 to 2019 because
the state where he was residing had not legalized the purchase of marijuana. (GE 3 at 7)
From  2017  to  2019,  he  purchased marijuana  in  the state  where he  lived from 2016 to
2017 because marijuana sales were legalized in that state. (Id.)
Applicant’s descriptions of his history of marijuana use during his OPM interview
indicated  significantly  more  extensive  marijuana  use  than  he described  at  his hearing.
(Tr. 29-30) At his hearing, he explained that at his OPM interview, he was trying to show
that he was candid and open, and he was not as careful about accuracy as during his
subsequent statement in response to the SOR and at his hearing. (Tr. 29-33)

The SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) purchased and used marijuana with varying
frequency from about January 2017 until February 2020; and (2) intends to continue using
marijuana  in  the future.  (Item 1.) Applicant admitted the  SOR allegations.  (Item 2.)  He
later qualified those admissions. In his Personal Subject Interview (PSI),  Applicant said
that marijuana purchase and use is legal in his state’s law. He purchases the drug legally
at  a  “recreational  dispensary.”  Applicant  said,  “he  will  stop  using  and  purchasing
marijuana  if  he  is  granted  a  Federal  security  clearance.”  Applicant  was  aware  that
purchase and use of marijuana is illegal under Federal law. (Item 4.)
Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
Discussion
Under AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into
doubt because  drug  use  can both  impair  judgment and  raise  questions about a  person’s
ability  or willingness to  comply  with  laws, rules, and  regulations.  AG ¶¶  24, 25  and  26
(setting forth  the concern and the disqualifying and  mitigating conditions).
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription
and  non-prescription  drugs,  and  the  use  of  other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their
intended  purpose  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual's  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior  may  lead  to  physical  or
psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises  questions  about  a  person's
ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  Controlled
substance  means  any  ""controlled  substance""  as  defined  in  21  U.S.C.  802.
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions or factors:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);
AG ¶  25(c)  illegal possession of a controlled substance;
AG ¶  25(g)
clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse;
expressed intent to continue drug involvement . . . or failure to
AG  ¶   26(a)  the   behavior  happened   so   long   ago,  was  so   infrequent,  or
happened  under such  circumstances that it is unlikely  to  recur or does not
cast  doubt  on   the   individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment;
Applicant admitted  to  legally  purchasing  and  using  marijuana  from  January  2017
to  February  2020.  Applicant also admitted  that he  will continue  to  use  marijuana, unless
he   is granted  a   security   clearance.  Facts admitted   by   an   applicant   in  an   answer to   an
SOR or in  an  interview  require  no  further proof from  the  Government. ISCR  Case  No.  94-
1159   at  4   (App.  Bd.  Dec.   4,  1995)  (“any   admissions  [applicant]   made   to   the   SOR
allegations . . . relieve  Department Counsel of  its burden  of  proof”); ISCR  Case  No.  94-
0569   at   4   and   n.1   (App.  Bd.  Mar.  30,  1995)  (“[a]n   applicant’s  admissions,  whether
testimonial or written, can provide  a legal basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”).
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated
by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. § 811 et seq.
The knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and
punishable  by  imprisonment,  a  fine  or  both. 21  U.S.C.  §  844.  In  an  October  25,  2014
memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is
a security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of  National Intelligence, Memorandum:
Adherence  to  Federal  Laws  Prohibiting  Marijuana  Use  (October  25,  2014).  See  also
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml.
More recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed
the  memorandum, Security Executive  Agent Clarifying  Guidance  Concerning  Marijuana
for Agencies Conducting  Adjudications of Persons Proposed  for Eligibility for Access to
Classified  Information  or Eligibility to  Hold a  Sensitive  Position.  It  emphasizes that  federal
law   remains  unchanged   with   respect   to   the   illegal  use,  possession,  production,   and
distribution  of  marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited   by   law   from   using   controlled   substances.  Disregard  of   federal  law
pertaining to  marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana  use) remains relevant,  but
not determinative, to  adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are  required  to use  the  “whole-
person   concept”  stated   under  SEAD  4,  to   determine   whether  the   applicant’s  behavior
raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
Applicant’s past use of marijuana and his conditional intent to use it in the future if
a clearance is not granted make disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 25(a), (c), and (g), apply
here. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply.
I have considered disqualifying factor AG ¶ 25(g) in light of Applicant’s  admission
that he would cease using marijuana if he were granted a security clearance. Adjudicative
Guideline H does not recognize, expressly or impliedly, a mitigating factor under these
circumstances.  Nor  does  the  “whole  person  concept”  offer  any  guidance  that  would
mitigate  Applicant’s  past  and  potentially  future  use  of  marijuana  if  a  clearance  is  not
granted. The  Government’s grant or denial of a  clearance  is not a  bargaining chip that
can be negotiated away by an applicant’s promise to cease illegal drug usage in the future
I  have  considered  mitigating  factor  AG  ¶  26(a).  Applicant  used  illegal  drugs  on
varying occasions from January 2017 to February 2020. His behavior was not infrequent,
nor was it long ago. I find that AG ¶ 26(a) does not apply.
The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and
ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. AG
¶¶  2(d)(1)-(9)  and  2(f)(1)-(6).  Accordingly,  I  conclude  that  Applicant  has  not  met  his
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph 1, Guideline H:
Against  Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:
Against  Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is denied.

2019. His first marriage ended in divorce in December 2017. He has minor child and a
stepchild. Applicant earned two bachelor’s degrees from a prestigious university in 1983
and a master’s degree in 1999. He began working for a DoD agency in 1989 and held a
Top Secret security clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information. He
worked for that agency until 2003. He began working for a U.S. Government contractor
in 2003. He applied to renew his clearance in 2005 and was granted a Secret clearance.
He testified that he lost his clearance eligibility in 2007 or 2008 as his duties no longer
required him to maintain a clearance.  In 2019, he changed employers and now works for
a second U.S. Government contractor. Applicant’s new employer sponsored him to apply
for a clearance in July 2020. He was granted an interim clearance. The clearance was
revoked a short period thereafter. (Tr. at 18-21; GE 1; GE 3.)
SOR Allegations  and Answer
Paragraph  1,  Guideline  H  - The  SOR  sets  forth  four  allegations  regarding
Applicant’s use of marijuana. Paragraph 1.a alleges that Appellant used marijuana with
varying frequency from about December 2006 to at least January 2021. Paragraphs 1.b
and 1.c allege that he used marijuana after having been granted a security clearance in
December 2006 and again in August 2020. Paragraph 1.d alleges that Applicant intends
to continue using marijuana in the future.
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  paragraphs  1.a  and  1.d  and  denied  1.b
and 1.c. He also commented that he only used marijuana  once in December 2006. He
wrote that he was not actively involved in classified work at that time.  He provided the
same comment with respect to the later time period. He also wrote in his Answer that he
disagreed  with  the basis of  the  AG, cited in the  SOR, that marijuana use  gives  rise  to
security concerns. He argued that alcohol use gave rise to similar concerns as marijuana
use and Guideline G is the more appropriate adjudicative guideline to be used to assess
the security risks raised by his continued use of marijuana.
At the hearing, Applicant testified about his past marijuana use. He said that he
used marijuana once on a family vacation in 2006. He estimated that he used marijuana
five  to  six times  in  the  2010-to-2014-time  period.  He  started  smoking  marijuana  about
once a month during the period 2014 until 2016 when the recreational use of marijuana
was legalized in his state of residence. During that two-or-three-year period, he used a
medical marijuana card and smoked marijuana to ease certain psychological and physical
problems he was experiencing due to the end of his first marriage. After 2016, he began
ingesting edibles containing THC or using a vape pen to inhale smoke containing CBD
oil.  He  purchased  these  marijuana  products  from  state-licensed  dispensaries.  The
frequency of  such  use during the  period 2016  up to the  present time  is about once  or
twice a month. He intends to continue using marijuana/THC in one form or another in the
future. His last use was four days before the hearing. (Tr. at 28-31, 37.)
With  respect  to  the  SOR  allegations  that  he  used  marijuana  while  holding  a
security clearance, he testified that during the periods in question he was not engaged in
working  with  classified  information.  He  said  that  he  stopped  working  with  classified
information  in  2003  when  he  left  his  DoD  position.  He  also  testified  that  he  cannot  be
certain that he used any marijuana product after he was briefly granted an interim security
clearance in 2020 and before it was revoked. (Tr. at 34-36.)
Applicant  submitted  two  articles  in  support  of  his  argument  about  alcohol  and
marijuana.  Applicant  also  argued  that  the  Federal  Government  has  de  facto  legalized
marijuana and that it is inappropriate to assess security risks under Guideline H, which is
the basis for the SOR allegations.  He  contends that the more appropriate adjudicative
guideline is Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). (Tr. at 25; AE A; AE B.)

"Applicant is 60 years old. He has never married and has no children. Applicant has
a  bachelor’s degree. Since  April 2019  he has been employed by a defense contractor.
Before then, from 2011 to 2012,  and from 2000 to 2008, Applicant worked for defense
contractors. (Item 3.)
The  SOR alleged  that Applicant:  (1) used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
about June  2013  to  about September 2018;  (2) used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency
from  about  2003  to  about  June  2008,  while  having  access to  classified  information; and
(3)  intends to  continue  using  marijuana  in  the  future,  stating  that “it is likely  that [he] will
use   drugs  in  the   future…  [and]  it   is  possible  [he]   will  smoke   marijuana   again  if   the
opportunity arises.”  (Item 1.)
Applicant qualifiedly admitted the first SOR allegation. The first SOR allegation is
wrong on two counts. First, Applicant denies that his use was “with varying frequency.”
His use was once in June 2003 and once in September 2018. Second, the alleged date
of June 2013 is wrong. (Item 2.)
Applicant  qualifiedly  admitted  the  second  SOR  allegation.  Applicant  had  no
security clearance in 2003 until 2004, when he received a clearance. He used marijuana
once in June 2008, while holding a security clearance. (Item 2.)
Applicant qualifiedly admitted the third SOR allegation.  In his answer, Applicant
referred to his responses to interrogatories. In response to interrogatory no. 12, Applicant
answered  “I have  no  future intentions of  drug  use, purchase  or distribution.”  Applicant
has not used illegal drugs since September 2018, when he last used marijuana.  (Items
2, 4, and Response.) Applicant was asked what he would do if he was in an environment
and  believed  illegal  drugs  were  or  had  been  used.  He  responded  “leave  the  area.”
Applicant  also  stated  that  he  does not  socialize  with  individuals  who  use  illegal drugs.
(Item 4, Personal Subject  Interview.) Applicant disclosed his marijuana use  in his May
2019 SCA.
Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
Discussion
Under AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into
doubt because  drug  use  can both  impair  judgment and  raise  questions about a  person’s
ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  AG ¶¶ 24, 25 and 26
(setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription
and  non-prescription  drugs,  and  the  use  of  other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their
intended  purpose  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual's  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior  may  lead  to  physical  or
psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises  questions  about  a  person's
ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  Controlled
substance  means  any  ""controlled  substance""  as  defined  in  21  U.S.C.  802.
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions or factors:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);
AG ¶  25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . . ;
AG  ¶   25(f)  any  illegal  drug  use  while  granted  access  to  classified
information;
AG ¶  25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement . . . or failure to
clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse;
AG  ¶   26(a)  the   behavior  happened   so   long   ago,  was  so   infrequent,  or
happened  under such  circumstances that it is unlikely  to  recur or does not
cast  doubt  on   the   individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment;
AG  ¶   26(b)  the  individual acknowledges  his  or her drug involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including,  but  not
limited to:
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs  were  used;
and
(3)  providing  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security
eligibility.
Applicant  admitted   using   marijuana  on  three   occasions,  in   June   2003  and   June
2008,  the  latter while  holding  a  security  clearance, and  with  his last  and  most recent usage
being  in September 2018.  Applicant also admitted  that  it is likely  or possible  he  would use
marijuana  in the  future if  the  occasion  arises.  Facts admitted  by  an  applicant in an  answer
to  an  SOR or in an  interview  require  no  further proof from  the  Government.  ISCR  Case
No.  94-1159  at  4  (App.  Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (“any  admissions [applicant]  made  to  the  SOR
allegations . . . relieve  Department Counsel of  its burden  of  proof”); ISCR  Case  No.  94-
0569   at   4   and   n.1   (App.  Bd.  Mar.  30,  1995)  (“[a]n   applicant’s  admissions,  whether
testimonial or written, can provide  a legal basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”).
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated
by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. § 811 et seq.
The knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and
punishable  by  imprisonment,  a  fine  or  both. 21  U.S.C.  §  844.  In  an  October  25,  2014
memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is
a security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of  National Intelligence, Memorandum:
Adherence  to  Federal  Laws  Prohibiting  Marijuana  Use  (October  25,  2014).  See  also
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml
More recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed
the  memorandum, Security Executive  Agent Clarifying  Guidance  Concerning  Marijuana
for Agencies Conducting  Adjudications of Persons Proposed  for Eligibility for Access to
Classified  Information  or Eligibility to  Hold a  Sensitive  Position.  It  emphasizes that  federal
law   remains   unchanged   with   respect   to   the   illegal  use,   possession,  production   and
distribution  of  marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited   by   law   from   using   controlled   substances.  Disregard  of   federal  law
pertaining to  marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana  use) remains relevant,  but
not determinative, to  adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are  required  to use  the  “whole-
person   concept”  stated   under  SEAD  4,  to   determine   whether  the   applicant’s  behavior
raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
Disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 25(a), (c), and (f), apply here. Because of Applicant’s
past use of marijuana and his equivocation on future use, AG ¶ 25(g) may also apply.
The next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply.
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(a). Applicant used illegal drugs on three
occasions,  in  June  2003,  June  2008  (with  a  clearance),  and  in  September  2018.  His
behavior was infrequent; his first use was in 2003, his next use in 2008, and his last use
in 2018, almost four years ago. I find that AG ¶ 26(a) applies, thereby mitigating AG ¶¶
25(a), (c), and (f).
AG ¶¶ 25(a), (c), and (f) are principally retrospective-looking, that is, they look to past
conduct  to  inform  a  predictive  assessment  of  potential future  conduct.  Provision  AG  ¶
25(g),  however,  looks  at  contemporaneous  expressions  of  future  intent  to  use  illegal
drugs. Here, in his PSI Applicant stated that “it is likely… [and] possible [he] will smoke
marijuana again if the opportunity arises.” That statement requires a consideration under
AG ¶ 25(g) whether Applicant  has “clearly  and  convincingly  [committed]  to  discontinue
such  misuse.”  AG  ¶  26(b)  has  mitigating  elements  that  complement  the  “clearly  and
convincingly” element of  AG ¶ 25(g). Those complements are: (1) acknowledgement of
drug  involvement;  (2)  a  pattern  of  abstinence;  (3)  disassociation  from  drug-using
associates; (3) avoiding a drug-using environment; and (4) a signed statement to abstain
from all future misuse of drugs, which misuse will be grounds for revocation of security
eligibility.
In his SCA, his Answer to the SOR, his PSI, and his responses to interrogatories,
Applicant has acknowledged his drug involvement. Applicant abstained from drug usage
from  2003  until  2008  (five  years)  and  from  2008  until  2018  (ten  years).  In  his  PSI,
Applicant stated that he does not socialize with individuals who use illegal drugs. He also
stated that if he found himself in a  drug-using  environment,  he  would “leave  the  area.”
Finally, Applicant submitted two statements disavowing any intent to use illegal drugs in
the future. It is fair to infer from his many years working for defense contractors that he
was, and is, aware that future illegal drug usage would jeopardize his security clearance
eligibility. I find that AG ¶ 26(b) mitigates disqualifying condition AG ¶ 25(g).
The  record  does  not  raise  doubts  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,
judgment,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has met
his ultimate burden of persuasion  to  show that  it  is clearly consistent  with  the  national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph 1, Guideline H:
For  Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:
For  Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information.

",True
"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  41  years old.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  March
2003. He holds a master’s degree. He is married and has two children, ages 13 and 8.
He has held a security clearance since 2004. (Tr. 6, 21-22; GE1, 4)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  from  2007  to
October 2017, while having access to classified information. (SOR ¶ 1.a) Under Guideline
E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false information on his March 2013
security clearance application  (SCA)  when  he failed to disclose his illegal drug  use as
stated in SOR ¶ 1.a above. (SOR ¶ 2.d)
Applicant admitted all of his illegal drug use, and his deliberate false answers given
on his 2013 SCA. Applicant began using marijuana in high school and continued his use
through his college years. He graduated from college in 2002. He was hired by his current
employer in 2003 and was investigated for and received a security clearance in 2004. He
claims he listed his previous high school and college drug use on his first SCA, however,
that document is not part of  the  record  so it cannot  corroborate  his assertion.  He also
asserts  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  from  the  time  of  his  hiring  (2003)  until
approximately 2007, when he began using marijuana again. He started using marijuana
in 2007 on a recreational basis approximately two to five times a year. He used it with
college friends and while on vacation with his friends. He remains friends with some of
the people with whom he smoked marijuana, and they continue to use marijuana in his
presence. He claims they respect his decision not to use marijuana any longer. Applicant
was  aware  that  marijuana  use  violated  his  company’s  drug  policy  and  that  using
marijuana was illegal in the state where he was using it. He now lives in a state where
marijuana use is legal under state law. His wife works for the same employer and also
holds a security clearance. She did not and does not use marijuana and was unhappy
about Applicant’s use  of  it.  He continued to use marijuana until approximately October
2017, when he stopped using it. He testified that there was no monumental event that led
to his cessation of marijuana use. Shortly thereafter, he reported his marijuana use to his
employer. In April 2018, he received a letter of reprimand for violating the company’s drug
policy. He has never received any drug treatment or counseling. He provided a written
statement of his intent not to use illegal drugs in the future. (Tr. 23, 26-33, 41-43; SOR
Answer; AE E-G)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  knowingly  falsified  his  2013  SCA  by  not  listing  his
marijuana use. He claims he was embarrassed to disclose this information at the time
and  he  knew  his  use  of  marijuana  was  wrong.  He  continued  to  use  marijuana  after
completing this SCA. After his disclosure to his employer in 2017-2018, he completed an
SCA in March of 2018 where he disclosed his previous marijuana use. (Tr. 31-33; GE 1,
5)
Applicant  is  involved   in  community   activities   such   as  coaching   youth   activities,
helping  out at school activities,  and  serving  as a  substitute  teacher. His volunteer work at
his  children’s  school  was  commended   by   the   school  principal   and   assistant  principal.
Applicant  was  characterized   as  a   valuable   school  asset   and   positive   influence.   He
provided  letters of support from  two  work supervisors who  describe Applicant as  honest,
trustworthy, and  very  remorseful for his conduct that led  to  this point.  They  recommend
him  for a  position  of  trust.  Applicant also provided  letters of  commendation  where he  was
recognized  for his contributions to  team  successes. His work evaluations  from  2003  to
2020  characterize  him as follows: satisfactory  contributor (2003), h
igh  contributor (2004-
2006),  exceptional  (2007-2011),  20%  (2012),  exceeded   (2015,  2018),  significantly

Applicant  is  the   son   of   a   first-generation   immigrant  father  and   a   second-
generation   mother  who   attempted   to   instill   “honesty,  integrity,  respect,   [and]   trust”  in

without  a   conviction.  Applicant  tested   positive   for  the   use   of  marijuana   on   a   pre-
employment   drug   test  in   May   2008.  His   job   offer   was  rescinded.   (Tr.  at  21-22;

Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  a
learning  disorder  and  attention-
deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  in  2008.  He  was  prescribed  Adderall,  which  helped  but
affected his sleep. He continued to use marijuana for recreational purposes and to help
with  some  of  the  unpleasant  effects of  Adderall.  (Tr. at  20-27; Applicant’s  response  to

Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August  2013.  He  reported  his  2006  arrest  for  “smoking  a  joint.”  He  also  reported
marijuana use from “09/1999 (Estimated)” to “12/2007 (estimated).” He reported the use
as recreational and moderate. He stated that he did not intend to use marijuana in the
future  with  the  explanation:  “I’ve  grown  up  and  it is  no  longer something  that I want to
impact my career. I’ve had bad things happen to me because [o]f it and don’t want to go
through it again.”  He intentionally failed to report the full extent of his marijuana use in
that  he  did  not  stop  using  marijuana  in  2007,  but  was  still  periodically  using  it.  He
testified that he was worried that if he told the truth, he would not be granted a security
clearance and he would lose his job. (Tr. at 13-14, 20, 22, 27-28; GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  September  2013.
His  answers  were  mostly  consistent  with  his  SF  86.  He  stated  that  he  smoked
marijuana about twice a week through December 2007. He stated that he had not used
marijuana since then, and he had no intention to use it in the future. (Tr. at 13; GE 3)
Applicant was granted a Secret security clearance in about 2013. He continued
to  periodically  smoke  marijuana  through  December  2016.  He  fully  reported  his
marijuana use on an SF 86 he submitted in April 2019. He stated that he did not intend
to  use  marijuana  in  the  future  with  the  explanation:  “I’ve  grown  up  and  it  is  no  longer
something that I want to  impact my career. I’ve  had bad things happen to me because
[o]f it and don’t want to go through it again.” (Tr. at 13, 28; GE 2, 4)
Applicant  stated that  his company wanted  him  to have  a Top Secret  clearance,
and he felt that he had to be completely truthful. There is no evidence of any illegal drug
use  after  December  2016.  He  stated  that  he  has  dissociated  himself  from  situations
where  marijuana  might  be  used,  and  he  does  not  intend  to  use  illegal  drugs  in  the
future. (Tr. at 14-15, 29-31; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  4)  Applicant submitted a
letter from a friend with the following declaration:

Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended purpose, and has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, which
can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 2001 to June 2004,

Paragraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Involvement)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  a  history  of  drug  involvement.  Specifically,  the  SOR  alleged  that
Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from about July 2004
through at least September 2019. The SOR also alleged that Applicant purchased and
used marijuana after he had been granted a security clearance in September 2010. In his
Answer, Applicant admitted the two SOR allegations under this guideline and wrote that
his last use of marijuana was in September 2019. He explained further that his uses of
marijuana were isolated events and occurred in December 2017 and September 2019.
He concluded his Answer with the comment that he has “no intent to abuse any drugs in
the future.”
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has engaged in conduct that involves questionable judgment, lack of candor,
and  dishonesty.  The  SOR  cross-alleges  under  this  guideline  the  two  Guideline  H
allegations described above. Applicant admitted both allegations again in his Answer.
Applicant’s Illegal Drug Use
On three occasions while climbing backcountry mountains, Applicant ingested an
“edible”  containing  CBD  with  THC  (Edibles).  The  dates  of  his  use  of  Edibles  are
December 2017, June 2018, and August 2019. His last use of  an Edible or any illegal
drug was August 2019. He used the Edibles as a sleep aid on three occasions after “high-
exertion” days and evenings of mountain-climbing activity so that he could sleep on a mat
on the ground. He has never purchased an Edible or any other illegal drugs. (GE 1 at 54;
Tr. at 26-31, 36-38,)
Prior to 2017, Applicant experimented with marijuana one or two times when he
was in college (2004-2007). He has not used any illegal drugs at any other times. (Tr. at
28-33.)
He reported in his e-QIP his use of THC during the preceding seven years. He also
reported his college use of marijuana in his original security clearance application when
he started working for his employer in 2007. (GE 1 at 53-55; Tr. at 29-33.)
Applicant testified that even though he had received extensive training about the
use  of  illegal  drugs  during  the  course  of  his  employment  from  2007  to  2019,  he  was
uncertain about the rules regarding the use of Edibles while holding a security clearance.
He described it as a gray area at the time, though he acknowledged that he  had never
inquired about the use of a substance containing CBD with THC. Through the process of
the adjudication of his clearance application, he now has a clear understanding of security
clearance rules. He wrote in his Answer and testified that he has no future intent to use
illegal drugs. (Tr. at 31-33.)
Mitigation
Applicant  provided  a  statement  of  his  personal  history  that  emphasized  his
charitable work and athletic activities while in high school and college. His statement also
expressed his pride in working for an important defense contractor for the past 15 years.
He wrote that he has been rated as a “high performer” in each of those years. (AE A.)
In a separate statement, Applicant noted that he has not used any illegal drugs
since August 2019 and that his use was limited to three occasions and occurred under
unusual circumstances when his use was solely for the purpose to permit him to sleep
under unusual circumstances. He wrote that he intends to continue to abstain from any
future use of illegal drugs, and he acknowledged that any future illegal drug involvement
or substance misuse would be grounds for the revocation of his national security eligibility.
(AE B.)
Applicant submitted two character letters. One letter is from a neighbor and friend
who  wrote  that  Applicant  is “of good  character and  a  model citizen.” The  other letter is
from  Applicant’s former roommate. He also praised Applicant in glowing terms. (AE C;
AE D.)
",True
"Applicant is 28 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. Applicant has a
bachelor’s  degree.  Since  December  2018,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor. (Item 2.)
The SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) used marijuana with varying frequency from
April 2011 to at least March 2021, and intends to use marijuana in the future; (2) used
LSD  in  March  2019;  (3)  used  cocaine  in  February  2018;  and  (4)  misused  Adderall  in
October 2017. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. (Item 1.)
Applicant later qualified those admissions. He understands that his use of
marijuana is problematic for his security clearance. He purchases marijuana from an
outside, illegal source. He intends to continue using marijuana in his own home,
because it reduces stress and improves his sleep and appetite. Applicant is concerned
about the side effects of prescription drugs that could provide those same benefits. He
used cocaine, Adderall, and LSD each only once and has no intention to use those
drugs in the future. Applicant used Adderall, which had been prescribed for one of his
friends. He used cocaine that was provided by an acquaintance of one of Applicant’s
friends. The LSD was provided by an unnamed acquaintance. (Items 2 and 3.)
Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
Discussion
Under Adjudicative Guideline (AG) H, suitability of an applicant may be questioned
or put into doubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about
a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG ¶¶ 24, 25,
and 26 set forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions.
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription
and  non-prescription  drugs,  and  the  use  of  other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their
intended  purpose  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual's  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior  may  lead  to  physical  or
psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises  questions  about  a  person's
ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  Controlled
substance  means  any  ""controlled  substance""  as  defined  in  21  U.S.C.  802.
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying
conditions:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);
AG ¶  25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance; and
AG ¶  25(g)
expressed intent to continue drug involvement . . .
Applicant admitted to illegally procuring and using marijuana from April 2011,  to
March 2021. He also admitted that he will continue to use marijuana. Facts admitted by
an applicant in an answer to an SOR or in an interview require no further proof from the
Government.  ISCR  Case  No.  94-1159  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  4,  1995)  (“any  admissions
[applicant] made to the SOR allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of
proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (“[a]n applicant’s
admissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal basis for an Administrative
Judge’s findings”).
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated
by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. § 811 et seq.
The knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and
punishable  by  imprisonment,  a  fine  or  both. 21  U.S.C.  §  844.  In  an  October  25,  2014
memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is
a security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of  National Intelligence, Memorandum:
Adherence  to  Federal  Laws  Prohibiting  Marijuana  Use  (October  25,  2014).  See  also
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml.
More recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed
the  memorandum, Security Executive  Agent Clarifying  Guidance  Concerning  Marijuana
for Agencies Conducting  Adjudications of Persons Proposed  for Eligibility for Access to
Classified  Information  or Eligibility to  Hold a  Sensitive  Position.  It  emphasizes that  federal
law   remains  unchanged   with   respect   to   the   illegal  use,  possession,  production,  and
distribution  of  marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited   by   law   from   using   controlled   substances.  Disregard  of   federal  law
pertaining to  marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana  use) remains relevant,  but
not determinative, to  adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are  required  to use  the  “whole-
person   concept”  stated   under  SEAD  4,  to   determine   whether  the   applicant’s  behavior
raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
LSD  and  cocaine  are  Schedule  I  and  Schedule  II  controlled  substances,
respectively,  under  the  Controlled  Substances  Act.  21  U.S.C.  §  811  et  seq.  See
http://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling.  Applicant’s  use  of  another
person’s  prescription  drug,  here  Adderall,  is  a  “misuse  of  prescription  .  .  .  drugs”  that
raises security concerns under AG H.
Applicant’s  past  use  of  marijuana  and  his  intent  to  use  it  in  the  future  make
disqualifying conditions  AG  ¶¶  25(a),  (c),  and  (g)  apply.  In  addition,  Applicant’s  use  of
LSD, cocaine, and his misuse of Adderall raise security concerns under AG H. I find that
no mitigating factors apply.
The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and
ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. AG
¶¶ 2(d)(1) through (9) and 2(f)(1) through (6).  Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has
not met his ultimate burden of  persuasion  to  show that  it  is clearly consistent  with  the
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:
Against  Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In  light of  the record as  a whole,  it is not clearly consistent with  the  interests of
national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is denied.

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.
(HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. He made some partial admissions in his
SOR response. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  industrial  engineer  who  has  worked  for  the  same
defense contractor since 2013. (Tr. 6-8; GE 1) In 2006, he graduated from high school,
and  in  2012,  he  received  a  bachelor’s  degree.  (Tr.  6)  His  bachelor’s  degree  was  in
industrial  and  systems  engineering.  (Tr.  6)  The  trend  in  his  grades  has  been  towards
improved grades. (Tr. 33-34; AE 18) His grades in graduate school have been excellent.
(Tr. 34; AE 19; AE 20) He is in the process of earning a master’s degree in engineering
technical management.  (Tr. 6)  He  has never served  in  the  military.  (Tr.  7)  In  2019, he
married,  and  he  does  not  have  any  children.  (Tr.  7)  There  is  no  evidence  of  security
violations, employee discipline, arrests, or alcohol abuse.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from about
2010  to  at  least  June  2021.  His  marijuana  use  continued  after  he  received  access  to
classified information in April 2020.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant used  LSD with varying frequency from about  2016
until at least February 2021. His LSD use continued after he received access to classified
information in April 2020.
Applicant’s first and second marijuana use occurred when he was in college. (Tr.
41-42)  When  his  employer  hired  him  in  2013,  he  received  a  drug  screen,  which  he
passed. (Tr. 31, 43) As part of in-processing at his employment, he probably received a
briefing or written materials about not using illegal drugs. (Tr. 43) He said the company
requests  that  employees  not  use  illegal  drugs.  (Tr.  44)  Over  one  six-year  period,  he
received three random drug screens or tests, and he did not test positive on any of them.
(Tr.  44)  During  a  subsequent  period,  he  used  marijuana  once  or  twice  a  month  on
weekends and during off-duty hours. (Tr. 45)
Applicant’s employer’s policy specifically prohibits any use of marijuana regardless
of state laws that authorize its use. (GE 5 at 5) The drug policy also prohibits possession
of any illegal or controlled substance. (Id.) Applicant denied that he intentionally violated
his employer’s policy prohibiting use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 47) He was only vaguely aware
that his employer prohibited illegal drug use; however, he was aware that possession of
marijuana  and  LSD  violated  federal  law.  (Tr.  48)  There  is  currently  marijuana  in  his
residence; however, he said it was his spouse’s marijuana. (Tr. 55)
Applicant did not disclose his possession and use of any illegal drugs on his April
7,  2020  SCA.  (GE  1)  On  May  7,  2020,  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
investigator interviewed Applicant, and he said that from 2010 to May 1, 2020, he used
marijuana on average every two or three months. (GE 2) He received the marijuana from
friends, acquaintances, and his spouse. (Id.) From 2016 to present, he used LSD four
times with his most recent LSD use occurring in mid-April 2020. (Id.) His spouse provided
the LSD to him. (Id.) He explained that his failure to disclose his illegal drug use on his
SCA  occurred  because  he  hurried  through  the  SCA  and  had  difficulty  completing  it
because of computer problems. (Id.)
Applicant said the most reliable information about the extent of his marijuana use
was during his OPM interview. (Tr. 45; GE 2) His most recent marijuana use was “before
June of 2021.” (Tr. 45, 55) He could not provide the specific date he most recently used
marijuana. (Tr. 60)
Applicant first used LSD in 2016, and during his lifetime, he used LSD a total five
times. (Tr. 48) His most recent LSD use was on February 13, 2021. (Tr. 48, 51; GE 2 at
8) On February 13, 2021, he used LSD that his spouse provided to him as a “bonding
experience.”  He  did not  use  LSD  with  the  intention of  violating  his employer’s  rules  or
federal law. (Tr. 52, 54)
Applicant  has  never  purchased  marijuana.  (Tr.  60)  His  spouse  occasionally
purchases marijuana. (Tr. 46) His spouse uses marijuana. He associates with her, and
she is involved in use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 53) He told his wife not to give him illegal drugs
in  the  future.  (Tr.  54)  He  does  not  intend  to  use  illegal  drugs  in  the  future  because
possession of a security clearance and career opportunities are “far more important” than
his desire to continue to use illegal drugs. (Tr. 49)
The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) indicates Applicant received
an interim secret clearance on April 14, 2020. (GE 3) In August 2020, Applicant signed a
non-disclosure agreement in connection with his access to classified information, and at
that  time,  Applicant  learned  he  had  an  interim  security  clearance.  (Tr.  56-57;  GE  4)
However, he  did not  actually  receive  access  to  any  classified  information  because  the
information  he  needed  to  access  was  top  secret,  and  the  interim  clearance  was
insufficient for him to have access to top secret information. (Tr. 56-58) Applicant has not
received any drug-related counseling or therapy. (Tr. 55)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s  character  evidence  supports  approval  of  his  access  to  classified
information.  He  received  positive  performance  evaluations,  which  indicate  he  is  an
outstanding  employee  who  has  made  important  contributions  to  the  success  of  his
employer. (Tr. 20-25; AE 1-AE 5) He is an intelligent, talented, professional, and diligent
high performer who is an innovative problem solver.  His credit report does not contain
any negative financial information. (Tr. 32; AE 11) His credit score is 761. (Tr. 33; AE 12)
From  2013  to  2017, he  paid about  $27,000 in  student  loans.  (Tr. 33) He  cares for his
mother, who was injured in a fall in 2021. (Tr. 37; AE 23) The general sense of his letters
of recommendation is that he is trustworthy, diligent, professional, responsible, reliable,
and  intelligent.  (Tr.  34-37;  AE  21;  AE  22)  He  has  outstanding  communication  skills,
judgment, and leadership. (Id.)

"In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and provided a brief
narrative statement. His admissions and his statement are incorporated into the findings
of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence  submitted, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 27 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2017, and has been
taking  post-graduate  courses  part-time  since  2019.  He  has  worked  as  a  software
engineer for his current employer, a defense contractor, since 2017. Applicant reported
in  his SCA  that his  initial  security clearance  investigation  was  completed  in  December
2017, and he was granted a security clearance in January 2018. (Item 2)
Applicant used and purchased marijuana while in high school and college, over a
five-year  period.  He  used  marijuana  a  few  times  a  week  during  the  school  year,  but
used it more often during summers. He purchased enough marijuana to last him about a
month at a time. Although Applicant knew it was illegal, he didn’t think his marijuana use
was causing harm to anyone. He stopped using marijuana in 2016 because he thought
that his continued use of it would impact his career and future. (Items 1, 2, 3)
Applicant did not use any illegal drugs between April 2016 to June 2019. During
this  time  period,  he  graduated  from  college,  started  employment  with  a  defense
contractor,  and  was  granted  a  security clearance.  Applicant  started  using illegal drugs
again in June 2019. (Items 2, 3)
In  his  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  used  cocaine,  hallucinogens,  and
stimulants  while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  In  his  Answer,  he  admitted  to  using
cocaine,  ecstasy,  LSD,  and  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  after  being  granted  access  to
classified information. He reported using drugs while possessing a security clearance in
his  interview  with  a  government  investigator.  From  June  2019  to  December  2019,  he
used and purchased  cocaine at least six times, at  party and music festival settings. In
July  2019,  he  used  and  purchased  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  and  LSD  at  a  music
festival. In August 2019, he used and purchased ecstasy at a music festival. Applicant
told a government investigator that his motivation to start using drugs in 2019, after he
had stopped his marijuana use three years’ prior, was for curiosity. (Items 1, 2, 3)
Applicant  stated  in  his  SOR  Answer  that  while  he  knows  that  drug  use  is  not
condoned  with  a  security  clearance,  he  believes  that  they  were  done  in  safe
environments,  and  did  not  pose  a  threat  to  himself,  anyone  around  him,  or  national
security.  He  also  asserts  that  he  used  illegal  drugs  in  small  amounts,  experimentally,
with friends he trusts, who are “upstanding citizens.” He argues his illegal drug use was
done in controlled environments of his choosing, and that he was not coerced into any
of this. He simply wanted to experience new things with friends. He asserts that he is an
“upstanding  citizen”  without  a  criminal record,  and that  he  raised  the  issue  of  his drug
use in his SCA. (Item 1)
Applicant argues that his drug use did not have lasting physical or psychological
impairment, and had no impact on his life. He did not state in his Answer that his drug
use  has  completely  stopped,  or  that  he  has  no  future  intent  to  use  illegal  drugs.  He
asserts that he is an outstanding employee,  and had received two promotions at work
and  good  performance  reviews.  He  provided  no  documentation  substantiating  these
assertions. (Item 1)

"Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he works as a
senior  customer  operations  engineer.  He  has  a  Bachelor’s  degree.  Applicant  is  not
married  and  has  no  children.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  national  security  eligibility  for  a
security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  employment  in  the  Defense  industry.
(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections12, 13A, and 17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
due  to  his  use  of  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  allegations  1.a  and  1.b  under  this
paragraph.
1.a.   Applicant  has  used   marijuana   on   a   frequent   basis   since   approximately
October  2005.  Applicant  used   marijuana   up   to   the   time   he   was  interviewed   by   an
investigator in March 2021. (Item 3.) There is no information in the record, including Item
3, to show that Applicant has stopped all marijuana use.
Applicant  stated  in  Section  23  of  the  e-QIP  in  answer  to  a  question  about  the
nature, frequency and number of times he used marijuana (Item 2):
Usage  has  been  for  the  purposes  of  mitigating  health  issue  impacting
quality of life such as insomnia, loss of appetite, anxiety, as well as for use
recreationally.  Use  has  also  assisted  with  side  effects  of  medication
(vyvanse) used for treating ADHD.
A different part of Section 23 asked Applicant to explain why he intended, or did
not intend, to use marijuana in the future:
My plan is to use the remaining portion of the year [2020] to substitute the
benefits  for  holistic  options  such  as  tea,  yoga,  meditation,  proper  eating
habits, and exercise. The goal is to ensure quality of life, mental health, and
maintain appetite  while  reducing  stress. I  select  ‘Yes’ because  I intend  to
submit this form before the end of November 2020.
Finally,  Applicant  was  asked  in  a  different  part  of  Section  23  if  he  intended  to
engage  in  marijuana  use  in  the  future.  Applicant  stated,  “No.”  As  stated,  Applicant
continued to use marijuana until March 2021, if not later.
1.b.  Applicant  admitted  on  his e-QIP  that he  purchased  marijuana  for  consumption
about every  3  to  4  months. He stated  that he  engaged  in this activity  because, “Use  of
substance  provides a  higher quality   of  life  and  address the  widest range  of  stressors.”
(Item  2 at Section  23.)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations  with
explanations.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  39  years  old.  He  is  single,  never  married,  and  has  no  children.  He
began working as an engineer for a defense contractor in 2004. His employer is subject
to  the  drug-free  workplace  provisions  of  41  U.S.C.  701  et  seq.  He  holds  a  master’s
degree. He has held a security clearance for 14 years. (Tr. 18-21; GE 1)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  between  July
2014 and July 2018, while granted access to classified information. In his answer to the
SOR,  Applicant  admitted  using  marijuana  during  this  time  and  stated  his  use  was
experimental.  Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  after  he
submitted his April 2017 security clearance application (SCA) in which he reported his
previous uses between 2014 and 2016 and in which he expressed his intent not to use
marijuana in the future. Applicant admitted using marijuana in 2018, after he completed
his  SCA.  He  further  explained  in  his  SOR  answer  that  he  was  not  trying  to  be
deliberately  misleading  when  he  stated  in  his  April  2017  SCA  that  he  would  not  use
marijuana in the future. (SOR answer)
Applicant admitted using marijuana a total of six times between 2014 and 2018,
five  times  before  completing  his April 2017  SCA  and  one  time  after  its  completion.  All
uses  were  while  he  held  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  stated  that  his  first  five  uses
were by smoking marijuana four times and by eating a marijuana edible one time. The
marijuana was supplied by a friend or his then girlfriend.  He was on vacation when he
used on these occasions. He claimed that he was not aware marijuana use was wrong
for a security clearance holder. Given his education, length of employment by a defense
contractor subject  to  the  drug-free  workplace  provisions  of  the federal statute,  and  his
14 years as a clearance holder, I do not find his claim of ignorance of the prohibition of
marijuana use credible. He also claimed his first five marijuana uses were experimental
and  then  stated  in  his  April  2017  SCA,  “Experiment  completed.  Not  needed  for  future
use.”  Contrary  to  this  statement,  Applicant  used  marijuana  again  when  he  was  on
vacation in July 2018. He met some people while partying on the street who offered him
marijuana,  which  he  accepted  and  used.  He  explained  his  action  as  simply  making  a
bad  decision.  He  has  had  no  further  contact  with  the  people  who  supplied  him
marijuana  on  this  occasion.  He  also  claims  he  no  longer  associates  with  his  former
girlfriend or friend who provided him with marijuana in the past. He admitted all six uses
during  his  background  interview  in  July  2018.  He  claims  not  to  have  used  since  July
2018. (Tr. 21-23, 27-28, 32, 36; GE 1-2)
Applicant provided three self-procured drug tests showing negative results for the
presence of illegal drugs. These tests results were from January 2020, November 2021,
and December 2021. He does not think he has ever taken an employee-mandated drug
test.  Applicant  also  provided  a  written  statement  of  intent  “never  to  use  illegal  drugs
again.” (Tr. 23, 31; AE A, B, J, Q)
In   September   2020,   Applicant  underwent  a   self-procured   substance-abuse
evaluation  by  a  licensed  clinical social worker and  certified  substance  abuse  counselor,
Ms.  B.  The   evaluation   consisted   of  an   interview,  a   standardized   drug   assessment
screening  test, and  a  review  of  the  SOR. Using  the  Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 5th  Edition   (DSM-5), Ms. B   opined   that   Applicant presented   with   “no
use   disorder”   and   further  opined   that   “no   treatment  was  warranted.”   In   her   evaluation
report,  Ms.  B   did   not  address   Applicant’s  broken   pledge   not   to   use   marijuana   in  the
future stated in his April 2017  SCA. (GE  1; AE  K-L)
Applicant  offered character letters from  six current  or former coworkers with  his
current  employer.  They  discussed  his  good  character, trustworthiness,  job  knowledge,
honesty,  reliability,  and  integrity.  Several  recommended  the  granting  of  his  security
clearance. Although Applicant testified that he told the authors the reason why he was
seeking  their  letters,  none  of  the  statements  referenced  that  the  authors  knew  about
Applicant’s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. (AE I, P)
Applicant  offered  his  job  performance  appraisals  for  years  2016-2020.  They
reflected  overall  ratings  of  “significantly  exceeded”  for  2016;  “achieved/substantially
achieved”  for  2018  and  2019;  and  “exceeded”  for  2017,  2020.  Applicant  also  offered
several certificates of appreciation noting his selection as employee of the month (twice)
and  as  a  significant  contributor  to  the  mission.  He  also  provided  a  photo  showing  his
involvement with a civic organization. (AE F-H, M)

"Under Guideline  H,  the  Government  alleged that  Applicant  used marijuana  with
varying  frequency  between  June  2012  and  February  2018,  at  times  while  holding  a
security  clearance  (SOR  1.a);  and  that  he  used  cocaine  in  about  March  2016  while
holding  a  security  clearance  (SOR  1.b).  In  response,  Applicant  admitted,  with
explanations, both of the SOR allegations (Answer). In addition to the facts established
by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since November
2018 in a position that requires eligibility for a security clearance. He  served on active
duty  in  the  U.S.  military  between  June  2006  and  June  2016,  when  he  received  an
honorable discharge. Applicant first received a security clearance after completing basic
training in 2006. Applicant was married between 2007 and 2012, when he and his ex-wife
divorced. He has no children. (GX 1 and 2)
In his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he smoked or ingested marijuana, once in
June 2012 and once in February 2018. He also listed that he used cocaine once in March
2016. He discussed those disclosures with a government investigator during a personal
subject  interview  (PSI)  on  January  22,  2019.  In  a  February  3,  2020,  response  to
interrogatories (RTI) about his use of illegal drugs, Applicant disclosed that in August or
September 2016, he used marijuana, an event he had not recalled when he completed
his e-QIP or during his PSI. He also disclosed in the RTI that in 2017, he unintentionally
ingested  an  illegal  drug  when  he  ate  a  brownie  he  did  not  know  contained
tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC),  the  active  psychoactive  ingredient  in  marijuana.  (Answer;
GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 26 – 30)
Applicant’s first use of marijuana occurred while he was on extended military leave
during a permanent change of stations (PCS) in June 2012. He was at an outdoor bar
and had consumed too much alcohol when he accepted an invitation to smoke marijuana.
Applicant was on active duty with an active security clearance. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr.
26 – 27, 40 – 42, 52 – 53)
In March 2016, Applicant was at a bachelor party in Las Vegas with some friends
he had known most of his life. Everyone, including Applicant, was drinking, gambling, and
having a good time. Someone at the party produced cocaine and Applicant tried some. It
is the  only time  he  has  used  cocaine.  Applicant  was  still on  active  duty with  an  active
security clearance. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 27, 42 – 43)
In late summer 2016, after his discharge from the military, but while his security
clearance was likely still active, Applicant was at another bachelor party. When some of
the attendees started smoking marijuana, Applicant used the drug when it was offered.
Again, he had consumed a lot of alcohol during the party. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 43 – 44)
In 2017, after Applicant’s discharge, he  worked with a longtime friend repairing,
renovating, and flipping houses. One day he went to his friend’s brother’s house to check
on a repair. He was hungry when he got there, and helped himself to some brownies that
were left out in the kitchen. He did not know the brownies contained THC until he felt odd
not long after eating one of them. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 28 – 29, 44 – 45, 56 – 58)
In  February  2018,  Applicant  received  in  the  mail  a  bag  of  between  10  and  20
gummy  candies  with  THC  in  them  (gummies).  They  were  sent,  with  Applicant’s
knowledge and approval, by a friend he served with in the military. That person lived in a
state where marijuana is legal under certain conditions. Applicant did not consider that
this conduct -- possessing or using THC -- might be illegal where he lived. Applicant ate
one or two of the gummies before giving the rest away. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 30 – 31,
45 – 48, 61)
After  Applicant  left  the  military,  he  worked  in  a  variety  of  jobs,  none  of  which
required  a  security  clearance.  When  he  received  the  THC  gummies  in  2018,  he  was
working at a civilian power plant. Later in 2018, he was hired by a temporary personnel
company for work at the same government facility and on the same project for which his
current employer hired him in November 2018. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 23 – 26, 45 – 47
Before 2018, Applicant’s lifestyle included attending parties and frequenting bars
and  nightclubs,  at  times  drinking  to  the  point  of  intoxication.  However,  since  October
2018,  he   has  been   in   a   committed   relationship  and   leads  a   stable,   healthy   lifestyle.
Applicant  has  not  been   intoxicated   since   2017   and   he   no   longer  associates  with   old
friends or anyone  else who  uses illegal drugs. Applicant asserted  that he  has no  intention
of  using  any  illegal substance  and  he  understands the  adverse consequences  that would
ensue  relative  to  his eligibility  for access to  classified  information. Further, Applicant has
a   solid   reputation   for  good   judgment  and   reliability   at  work  and   among   his  personal
associates.  A  family  member with  extensive  experience  in government work that  requires
access to  classified  information,  and  who  has  known  Applicant  for most of his life,  testified
that   Applicant   is  trustworthy,  reliable,   and   of   good   character,   and   that  Applicant  has
matured  significantly  over the  past few  years.  (Answer; GX  1; GX  2; AX  A; AX  B; Tr.  17

"Applicant is a 25-year-old single man. He is a high school graduate, and is being
sponsored by a defense contractor for a security clearance. (Item 3) Shortly after finishing
high school, he enlisted in the United States Air Force.
Applicant began using marijuana while in high school in 2014. In September 2015,
after entering the military, he completed a security clearance application. He admitted to
using marijuana twice in 2014, and noted that he did not intend to use it again. (Item 3 at
26-27) In August 2017, Applicant failed a drug test after testing positive for marijuana.
(Item 5 at 3) Subsequently, in September 2017, he was charged under the Uniform Code
of Military Justice with wrongful use of marijuana. (Item 6) He was awarded non-judicial
punishment of reduction in grade from E-3 to E-2, and he was administratively discharged
(Item 7 at 3)
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted to using marijuana with varying
frequency from February 2014 to August 2017. (Item 2 at 1) During part of this period, he
held a security clearance for his duties in the military. (Item 2 at 1)
In July 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized DOD  investigator. During
the interview, he told the investigator that he had not used marijuana since he was in high
school in 2014. (Item 5) In February 2020, Applicant completed interrogatories. He stated
that he ceased marijuana use in 2016, and that he has no intention of using it in the future.
(Item 2 at 2)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.a-1.g,
2.a-2.d, 3.a, and 3.b. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶ 4.a and 4.b. His admissions in
his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 62-year-old instrument repairer employed by a defense contractor
since September 1982. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 1978 to
August 1982. He married in November 1990.
Applicant  received  a security clearance  shortly after he  was  hired by a  defense
contractor in September 1982. (GX 5 at 2.) He applied to continue his clearance in June
2008. His application was denied in September 2008 after a hearing by an administrative
judge. (GX 5.) He applied again in March 2012, and his application was denied. (GX 1 at
32.). After he reapplied in 2013, his security clearance was reinstated.
In January 1990, Applicant was charged with felony possession of marijuana with
intent to distribute. At the hearing, he testified that he was riding in a car with two other
individuals, but he did not know that the driver had marijuana in the car. (Tr. 33-34.) The
record  indicates  that  he  was  represented  by  an  attorney  and  pleaded  guilty  to  a
misdemeanor  to  avoid  risking  a  jail  sentence.  He  was  convicted  of  misdemeanor
possession of marijuana and was fined. (GX 5 at 2.)
In October 1994, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana. He testified
that he was visiting a young woman outside an apartment complex. He gave the woman
his  jacket  because  it  was  cold.  She  walked  inside  the  apartment  complex  and  then
returned, wearing the jacket. While she was inside, security guards challenged Applicant
for being in the apartment complex and asked for identification. His identification was in
his  car,  but  he  responded  that  he  did  not  have  any  identification.  After  Applicant  was
arrested  for  trespassing,  the  young  woman  gave  his  jacket  to  the  police,  who  found
marijuana  in  the  pocket.  (Tr.  35-39.)  Court  records  reflect  that  he  pleaded  guilty  to
misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Although he testified that he was also convicted
of trespassing, a trespassing charge is not reflected in the record. He was sentenced to
30 days in jail (suspended) and fined $100 (GX 4 at 13.)
In August 1998, Applicant was stopped for making an illegal stop on a highway to
let a passenger out of his vehicle. His arrest occurred during a time that a labor strike was
ongoing. He submitted to a breathalyzer and was charged with driving under the influence
of  alcohol  (DUI).  (Tr.  41-42.)  He  was  convicted  and  required  to  attend  an  alcohol-
education program once a week for six months. (GX 5 at 3.) He completed the program
as required. (Tr. 42.)
In  September  2000,  Applicant  was  charged  with  felony  possession  of  cocaine.
During  his  September  2019  security  interview,  he  told  an  investigator  that  a  bag
containing a few rocks of cocaine was found nearby in a parking lot. During the interview
and at his hearing, he denied that the cocaine was his. (GX 2 at 15; Tr. 42-43.) He pleaded
not guilty, but he was convicted and sentenced to five years in jail (suspended) and one
year of supervised probation. (GX 4 at 11.)
In July 2009, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana, drunk in public
and  felony  assault  on  a  law  enforcement  officer.  He  testified  that  one  of  his  sons  had
hidden a marijuana cigarette in the garage. When he found it, he confronted his son while
holding it in his hand. He had consumed alcohol and admitted that he was “a little irate.”
A police officer approached and told Applicant he needed to go into the house. The record
does not reflect what caused the police officer to approach the house. Applicant told the
police officer that he was in his own yard and that he would not go into the house. The
factual  basis  for  charging  him  with  felony  assault  on  a  law  enforcement  officer  is  not
reflected in the record. The charges of marijuana possession and drunk in public were
disposed  of  by  nolle  prosequi.  Pursuant  to  a  plea  agreement,  he  was  convicted  of
misdemeanor  assault  and  battery  and  sentenced  to  180  days  in  jail,  with  160  days
suspended. (GX 4 at 5.) He served his jail time on weekends. He testified that the charge
of felony assault was in  retribution  for “talking  back” to  the  police  officer, and his guilty
plea  to  misdemeanor  assault  and  battery  was  a  non-negotiable  element  of  his  plea
agreement. (Tr. 50-51.)
In  March  2016,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI  and  refusing a  blood or breath
test. At the hearing, he testified that he hit a broken drainage grate in the road and ran
into a retaining wall. The airbags went off and he was stunned. He had no memory of
refusing a blood or breath test. He told a security investigator that he requested a blood
test,  which  was  refused.  (GX  2  at  12.)  He  pleaded  guilty  to  reckless  driving  and  was
sentenced to 12 months in jail (suspended), unsupervised probation for two years, and a
$250 fine. He was required to participate in 26-week substance-abuse program, which he
completed. (GX 2 at 10; GX 4 at 1-2.) The charge of refusing a blood or breath test was
disposed of by nolle prosequi. (GX 4 at 3) He testified that he did not inform his employer
about this incident because he was convicted only of reckless driving and not an alcohol-
related conviction.
Applicant testified that he usually consumed two or three beers a day before the
March 2016 incident. Now that he has started attending church, he seldom drinks beer,
but when he does, it is not more than two beers. He last consumed two beers at a wedding
on the weekend before his hearing. He has not received any treatment for alcohol use
since  he  completed  the  court-ordered  26-week  program  after  his  conviction  in  March
2016. The program included attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but he did
not actively participate in the meetings or continue his attendance after completing the
program. (Tr. 60-63.)
On July 4, 2019, Applicant used cocaine at a party, and he subsequently tested
positive for cocaine on a urinalysis test. He held an active security clearance at the time.
During a security interview in September 2019, he told an investigator that he had invited
friends to join him for a July 4 party, that a friend brought cocaine to the party, and that
he snorted two lines of his friend’s cocaine at the party. At the hearing, Applicant testified
that his use of cocaine was not due to peer pressure, but “just a little stupidity” on his part.
(Tr. 68-69.) After he tested positive  in  the  urinalysis,  he  was  referred  to the Employee
Assistance  Program.  He  was  enrolled  in  a  six-week  program  at  a  behavioral  health
facility,  which  he  successfully  completed.  (GX  2  at  14)  The  SOR  alleges  that  he  was
diagnosed with cocaine use disorder (moderate), and Applicant admitted the allegation-
in his answer to the SOR. However, at the hearing, he testified that he was unaware of
any diagnosis. There is no evidence of a diagnosis in the record. Applicant testified that
the friend who brought cocaine to the party lives in another area and it has been years
since they have had any contact. (Tr. 68.) He testified that he no longer associates with
drug-users. (Tr. 92.)
When Applicant submitted his most recent SCA in February 2019, he answered
“No” to the questions in Section 22, which included asking if he had ever been charged
with any felony offense and if he had ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol
or drugs. He also answered “No” to the questions in Section 23, asking if he had illegally
used any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years, if he had ever used or
otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security
clearance,  and  if  he  had  ever  been  ordered,  advised  or  asked  to  seek  counseling  or
treatment as a result of illegal use of drugs or controlled substances. (GX 1 at 27.) He did
not  disclose  that  he  was  charged  with  felony  possession  of  marijuana  with  intent  to
distribute  in  January  1990,  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana  in  October  1994,
charged  with  DUI  in  August  1998,  charged  with  felony  possession  of  cocaine  in
September 2000, charged with possession of marijuana in July 2009, charged with being
drunk  in  public  in  2009,  and  charged  with  felony  possession  of  cocaine  in  September
2000.
Applicant’s  testimony  regarding  his  failures  to  disclose  his  drug  and  alcohol
involvement in his February 2019 SCA, Department Counsel’s cross-examination about
his non-disclosure, and Applicant’s responses to cross-examination were repetitive and
circular, with both parties talking past each other and apparently not understanding each
other. However, the following facts were established. Applicant was generally familiar with
the security-clearance process. He received a security clearance around 1983. He had
previously submitted two paper versions of the SCA in 2006 and 2008 and two electronic
versions in 2013 and 2019. He found the completion of an SCA “really hard stuff” and he
had  been  “pinged” by an  administrative  judge  in 2008  for not disclosing  all  his criminal
conduct.  (Tr. 78;  GX 5 at 3.) He had admitted  during his 2008 hearing that he did not
report his criminal conduct because he was embarrassed. (Tr. 44; GX 5 at 3.) The record
does not reflect what Applicant disclosed in the SCAs he submitted in 2012 and 2013. He
testified that when he was filling out the 2019 SCA, he asked a woman, whose identity
and duties are not reflected in the record, whether he  needed to “go  all the  way back.”
The woman replied that she did not know. Applicant  testified that he believed  that “the
government” already knew about his criminal record, and so he did not disclose it in the
SCA. (Tr. 73-75.).
During  a  follow-up  interview  in  September  2019,  Applicant  initially  denied  any
illegal  drug  use  during  the  past  seven  years.  After  the  investigator  asked  him  about
involvement  in  any  drug  incidents  at  work,  he  disclosed  his  cocaine  use  and  positive
urinalysis in July 2019. (GX 2 at 14; Tr. 89.)
At the hearing, Applicant attributed some of his criminal record to racism, resulting
in  arrests  and  charges  that  would  otherwise  have  not  occurred.  (Tr.  19-24.)  I  have
considered his concern, especially with respect to his arrest for marijuana possession in
January 1990, his arrest for trespassing in October 1994, his arrest for making an illegal
stop on a highway in 1998, and his arrest for being drunk in public in July 2009.
In May 2019, Applicant was selected by his employer as an “Excellence in Action”
honoree for his outstanding performance of duty. (AX F.) In September 2020, he received
an  “on-the-spot”  recognition  certificate  for  “honesty  and  integrity  when  no  one  was
looking.”  He  had  raised  a  “red  flag”  on  a  ship’s  hull  after  noticing  that  cables  were
damaged. (AX A.)
Applicant’s  general  foreman  attested  to  his  unquestionable  integrity,  technical
knowledge, deck-plate experience, and leadership. (AX E.) A coworker who has known
Applicant  for  almost  40  years  describes  him  as  dependable,  responsible,  honest,
talented, and patriotic. (AX G.) Another coworker who has known Applicant for 32 years
admires  his  technical  experience,  leadership,  and  commitment  to  his  job.  (AX  H.)  A
coworker who has known Applicant for 18 years considers him the subject matter expert
in their shop, a caring coworker, and a person of honesty and integrity. (AX J.) Another
coworker who has worked with Applicant for three years similarly attests to his loyalty,
reliability,  and  technical  skills.  (AX  I.)  Applicant’s  pastor  describes  him  as  a  devoted
husband,  a  loving  father,  and  “an  extremely  humble,  considerate,  and  trustworthy
person.” (AX B.) A church member who has known him for five years regards him as loyal
and dependable, with great interpersonal skills (AX D.) A personal friend who has known
Applicant for more than 30 years considers him an honest, trustworthy, and dependable
person.  (AX  C.)  Applicant  testified  that  the  individuals  submitting  letters  on  his  behalf
might know about his past, but they probably do not know about his criminal convictions.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he denied the Guideline H allegations. After a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. He is divorced (date of marriage: 1999-2003), and has
one child, age 21. Applicant provides financial support to his child in the amount of $500
monthly.  He  began  working  as  an  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor  in  2008.  His
employer is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701  et seq. He
holds a bachelor degree. He served in the U.S. Army from 1997 until 2003 and received
an  honorable  discharge.  He  held  a  security  clearance  while  in  the  Army.  His  current
employer sponsored him for a security clearance in 2008, which was granted. He is an
active  outdoorsman,  whose  activities  include  hiking,  mountain  climbing,  camping,
mountain biking, skiing, and motorcycle trail-riding. (Tr. 17-20; GE 1, AE M)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  and  cocaine  in  June  2017,  while
granted access to classified information.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant  admitted
using cocaine and marijuana once each in June 2017. He denied that he had access to
classified  information  in  June  2017.  Applicant’s  security  clearance  application  (SCA)
established  that  he  was  granted  access  to  classified  information  in  2008.  Applicant’s
security manager authored an email in March 2021, stating that  Applicant  had  “access
with  a  clearance  for  [his  employer]  from  8/19/2008  through  10/12/2009  when  he  was
downgraded  as  no  longer  requiring  a  clearance  for  his  job  duties.”  The  Government
produced  a  document  from  the  Defense  Information  System  for  Security  (DISS)
showing  that  as  of  December  1,  2021,  Applicant  held  a  security  clearance.  While
Applicant  may  not  have  had  current  access  to  classified  information,  he  continued  to
possess a security clearance and could have been granted access at any time. (GE 1,
2; SOR answer)
In June 2017, Applicant met a woman (W1) at a bar. He did not know W1 before
meeting her on this occasion. The two of them went back to her house. A female friend
(W2) of W1’s came to her house and brought cocaine with her. W2 laid the cocaine out
on a coffee table. Applicant recalled that W2 snorted a line of cocaine, but he was not
sure if W1 did as well. The women then offered him cocaine, but he refused. The two
women then left the room and Applicant placed a small amount of cocaine on his finger
and tasted it using his tongue. Applicant claimed he did not like the taste of it and he did
not  ingest  anymore  of  it.  His  explanation  for  trying  the  cocaine  was  to  satisfy  his
curiosity about it. He claimed he never encountered W1 again after that night. Applicant
claimed  that  he  has  not  used  cocaine  since  this  incident  and  he  has  no  intent  to  use
cocaine in the future. (Tr. 20-22, 40; SOR answer; GE 1; AE B-C)
Later,  in  the  same  month,  Applicant  spent  the  night  at  a  friend’s  house  in  the
event  he drank alcohol during the evening.  The friend  produced  a marijuana pipe and
apparently told Applicant that using marijuana helped him sleep. Applicant claimed that
he smoked one puff of marijuana, that it did not agree with him, and he did not use any
more. He claimed he used the marijuana because he was curious about it based upon
his friend’s reference to using it to help him sleep. He claims he has not used marijuana
since that time and has no intention of using it in the future. He regularly associates with
the  friend  who  provided  the  marijuana  by  socializing  with  him  every  week  or  two.  (Tr.
24-25, 43; SOR Answer; GE 1, 3; AE B-C
Applicant admitted using marijuana previously in 1999 when he was in the Army
and while he held a security clearance. He claimed he used it while on leave. Since this
use  of  marijuana  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  I  will  not  use  it  for  disqualification
purposes, but I may use it in assessing Applicant’s credibility, in applying any mitigating
conditions,  and  in  my  whole-person  analysis.  Applicant’s  initial  admission  to  this
marijuana use came in his 2008 SCA, where he also stated, “I have not used marijuana
since that time and I don’t intend to use in the future.” (Tr. 36-37; GE 2-3)
As  part  of  his  on-boarding  process  with  his  employer  in  2008,  Applicant  was
required to take a drug test, which produced a negative result. He has not been drug-
tested  by  his  employer  since  that  pre-employment  test.  He  provided  copies  of  self-
procured  drug-test  results  from  January  2021  and  October  2021.  Both  tests  showed
negative  results  for  marijuana  and  cocaine,  as  well  as  other  illicit  drugs.  Applicant
admitted  knowing  his  use  of  cocaine  in  2017  was  illegal.  During  cross-examination,
when  asked  about  the  illegality  of  his  marijuana  use  in  2017,  Applicant  stated  that  he
just  knew  it  was  legal  under  state  law.  He  admitted  that  from  2008  he  was  generally
aware of his employer’s no-drug-use policy. (Tr. 34-35, 41, 45-46; AE A)
Applicant listed both his 2017 cocaine and marijuana uses on his January 2019
SCA.  He  also  revealed  those  uses  to  a  defense  investigator  during  his  background
interview in July 2019. He did not reveal these uses to his employer until after reporting
it on his SCA in January 2019. (Tr. 25, 39; GE 1, 3; AE C)
In  March 2021, Applicant underwent a  self-procured  substance-abuse  evaluation
by  a  licensed  clinical social worker and  certified  substance  abuse  counselor, Ms.  B.  The
evaluation   consisted   of   an   interview,  a   standardized   drug   assessment  screening   test,
and   a   review   of   the   SOR.  Using   the   Diagnostic  and   Statistical  Manual  of   Mental
Disorders,  5th   Edition   (DSM-5),  Ms.  B   opined   that  Applicant  presented   with   “no   use
disorder”  and  further opined  that “no  treatment was warranted.”  In  her evaluation  report,
Ms.  B   did   not  address  Applicant’s  1999   marijuana   use   while   holding   a   security
clearance, or his pledge not to use marijuana in the future stated in his 2008 SCA. (GE
2-3; AE C)
Applicant  offered  character  letters  from  five  acquaintances,  three  current  or
former coworkers with his current employer and two other professional associates. They
discussed  his  good  character,  trustworthiness,  job  knowledge,  honesty,  reliability,  and

statements  referenced  that  the  authors  knew  about  Applicant’s  use  of  cocaine  and
marijuana while holding a security clearance. One author stated, “It is imperative to me
to not be associated with someone against my morals, one of them being anyone who
partakes in the use of drugs. [Applicant] is not that person.” (AE L)
Applicant  offered  his  job  performance  appraisals  for  years  2017-2020.  They

"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in his Answer to the SOR. (¶¶1.a-d, and
2.a.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  64  years old.  He  was  previously married  from  about  1978  to  1990,
and he married his current spouse in 2013. He has an adopted son, age 31. He served
active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  August  1977  until  his  honorable  discharge  in
January  1982.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree,  with  a  focus  in  electronic  systems,  in
1982.  In  2009,  he  received  a  certification  in  systems  engineering,  and  in  2017,  a
master’s  degree  in  business  administration.  He  is  currently  employed  by  a  federal
contractor  since  mid-2021  as  a  principal  solutions  engineer.  Applicant  was  granted  a
secret  DOD  security  clearance  in  November  2018.  His  employer  has  sponsored
Applicant  for a  top  secret  security  clearance  in  order that  he  may  perform  specific  job
duties. (Tr. 9-10, 16-20; GE 1)
In  his  January  2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  previously  used
marijuana intermittently from June 1973 to September 2013, approximately a few times
a year. He listed that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because he did not
like marijuana and his lifestyle had changed when he remarried in 2013. (Tr. 19-21; GE
2)
In  Applicant’s  April  2020  SCA,  he  disclosed  that  he  continued  his  use  of
marijuana  a  couple  times  a  year  from  2013  to  December  2019.  He  also  listed  that  he
had smoked marijuana with friends after a mass shooting took place in August 2019. At
the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  continued  to  use  marijuana  due  to  certain
emotional  triggers;  such  as  the  anniversary  of  9/11,  and  after  a  mass  shooting  took
place near his residence in 2019. He and his friends have consistently visited a historic
area of bars and restaurants for more than 30 years where the mass shooting occurred,
and they were traumatized by the event. From August 2019 to December 2019, he used
marijuana more frequently with friends and family to deal with the trauma. In December
2019, he purchased marijuana at a bar in this historic district. (Tr. 21-25; GE 1)
On  May  8,  2018,  Applicant  participated  in  a  background  interview  with  an
authorized  DOD investigator.  Applicant provided details about his use  of marijuana  up
to January 2013. He explained that his lifestyle changed after he remarried in 2013 and
he  stopped  playing  in  a  band.  Applicant  reported  that  he  had  no  intention  of  using
marijuana again in the future. (GE 5)
On  May  4,  2020,  Applicant  participated  in  another  background  interview.  He
admitted  marijuana  use,  on  a  yearly  basis,  from  June  1973  to  December  2019.  He
clarified,  however,  that  he  used  marijuana  on  a  “weekly”  basis  from  August  2019
through December 2019. He used marijuana more frequently with friends following the
mass  shooting  near  his  residence.  He  stated  that  he  purchased  marijuana  from  a
stranger in late 2019. He reported that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future.
(Tr. 27; GE 4)
During   the   March   2022   hearing,  Applicant   admitted   that   he   had   most  recently
used  marijuana a  “handful”  of times  between his May  2020  interview and early  2022. He
had   also  purchased   marijuana   once   since   2019.   Applicant   acknowledged   that  he   was
aware,  at  the   time   of   his  conduct,  that  using   and   purchasing   illegal  drugs  while
possessing  a security  clearance  was prohibited. In  January  2021, Applicant submitted  a
statement  of  intent   to   abstain   from   future   marijuana   use;   however,  Applicant  candidly
testified   that   he   had   used   marijuana   as  recently   as  early   2022   and   it  was  unlikely   he
would  abstain  from   using   marijuana   in  the   future.  He  has  never  participated   in  a  drug
counseling or treatment  program.  (Tr. 24-29; GE 3)

all other illegal drugs. (Items 2, 3, 4)
Applicant  reported  some,  but  not  all  of  the  illegal  drug  involvement  he  was
required to on the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in
November 2019. He discussed the remaining instances of his drug involvement during
his March 2020  interview and  in  his interrogatory responses. He admitted  that he was
not fully candid when he filled out his SF 86 because he  was trying to  “save  face”  and
protect his long-term job security because he was concerned his employer might review
his completed SF 86. He did not want his employer to know about his drug involvement
other than with marijuana and asserted that his employer does not need to know about
it.  He  opined  that  if  there  were  no  legal  repercussions  for  lying  about  his  illegal  drug
use, he would probably lie about the use to a prospective employer. (Items 2, 3, 4)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  aforementioned  illegal  drug
involvement,  his  use  of  marijuana  after  completing  his  SF  86,  and  his  stated  intent  to
continue  to  use  marijuana.  Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  failure  to
divulge his non-marijuana illegal drug involvement in his SF 86 despite being required to
do so. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations  without
comment.  All of the SOR allegations are established. (Item 1)

"Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about June 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for
the first time. He is either a college graduate or just a few credits short of a degree. He
is divorced with three children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 50, 72; GE 1)
Applicant  has  a  history of  substance  abuse  and  criminal offenses  related  to  his
substance abuse. He became addicted to prescription opioid painkillers after he injured
his  back  sometime  between  about  2008  and  2011,  resulting  in  significant  pain.  The
physician’s  assistant  who  prescribed
for
overprescribing “oxycodone, hydrocodone, and other controlled substances” to patients
he  was  treating  for pain  management.  Applicant’s  addiction  led  to doctor shopping for
prescriptions,  alcohol  abuse,  employment  issues,  marital  difficulties,  and  financial
problems. In addition to the opioid painkillers, he would sometimes drink between a pint
and  a  fifth  of  vodka  a  day  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  3.a).  (Tr.  at  18-38,  82-96,  126;  Applicant’s
response to SOR, attachments A, F, P, S; GE 1, 2)
the  medication  was
later  sanctioned
Applicant was arrested in May 2013 and charged with two felony counts of falsely
obtaining  a  prescription  in  December  2012  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  2.c).  The  essence  of  the
offense is that he obtained a prescription for a controlled substance from one provider
without  informing  the  provider  that  he  also  received  the  controlled  substance  from
another source. He pleaded guilty on June 11, 2013, to falsely obtaining a prescription.
The second count was dismissed. He was sentenced to up to five years in prison, which
was  suspended  upon  his  completion  of  probation  for  36  months,  and  included
conditions  that  he  complete  substance  abuse  treatment,  and  not  possess  or  use
controlled  substances  or  alcohol.  The  felony  was  reduced  by  the  court  to  a
misdemeanor  in  December  2017.  (Tr.  at  38-41;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,
attachments A, G, H, N, P; GE 1-3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  August  2013  and  charged  with  six  felony  counts  of
falsely obtaining a prescription between April 1, 2013, and June 10, 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b,
2.c).  He  pleaded  guilty  in  October  2013  to  three  felony  counts  of  falsely  obtaining  a
prescription.  The  three  remaining  counts  were  dismissed.  In  January  2014,  he  was
sentenced  to  up  to  five  years  in  prison  and  $15,000  in  fines.  The  prison  term  and
$14,397  of  the  fine  were  suspended  upon  his  completion  of  probation  for  36  months.
Conditions  of  his  probation  included  a  drug  and  alcohol  evaluation  and  completion  of
any  recommended  substance  abuse  treatment,  and  to  not  possess  or  use  controlled
substances  or  alcohol.  The  felonies  were  reduced  by  the  court  to  misdemeanors  in
February 2018. (Tr. at 38-41, 98; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachments A, H, N, P;
GE 1-3)
Applicant  continued  to  abuse  opioid  painkillers  and  alcohol  notwithstanding  the
two  convictions  and  probation.  He  completed  a  36-day  inpatient  substance  abuse
treatment  program  from  about  February  2014  to  April  2014.  He  reported  that  he  was
drinking between a pint and a fifth of vodka a day  with the opioids. He was diagnosed
with  alcohol  dependence  and  opioid  dependence  (SOR  ¶¶  2.d,  3.a,  3.b).  He  was
advised  to  remain  abstinent  from  alcohol  and  recommended  upon  discharge  for
aftercare  and  outpatient  treatment.  (Tr.  at  40-43,  96;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,
attachments I, P, R, S; GE 2, 5)
Applicant  did  not  follow  through  on  aftercare  or  outpatient  treatment,  and  he
relapsed after leaving the treatment facility. He found that alcohol enhanced the effects
of the opioids. He was driving under the influence of opioids and alcohol when he  was
arrested in May 2014. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was about two and a half
times  the  legal limit.  He  was  charged  with  driving under the  influence  of  alcohol/drugs
(DUI). He pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of impaired driving in May 2014. He was
sentenced to 90 days in jail, with the 90 days suspended, and a fine (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 3.b,
3.c). (Tr. at 42-46, 102-103; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachment J; GE 1-3, 5)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  found  in  violation  of  his  probation  for  the  2013
convictions,  and  his  probation  was  revoked  and  restarted.  He  was  sentenced  to  150
days  in  jail  for  the  June  2013  conviction,  with  all  but  three  weeks  served  at  a  work
release facility (SOR ¶ 1.d). He was sentenced to 365 days in jail for the August 2013
conviction, with all but three weeks served at a work release facility (SOR ¶ 1.e). (Tr. at
47-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
After  he  completed  the  work-release  program,  Applicant  resumed  abusing
alcohol  and  opioids,  including  oxycodone,  morphine,  and  fentanyl  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b).
From about April 2015 to June 2015, he used heroin  during a period that he could not
obtain  the prescription opioids.  Heroin was  also  cheaper than the prescription opioids.
(SOR  ¶  2.e).  In  June  2015,  he  checked  into  the  same  substance  abuse  treatment
facility for inpatient treatment for 45 days. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence
and  opioid  dependence  (SOR  ¶¶  2.f,  3.d).  The  facility  certified  that  he  successfully
completed the inpatient program in July 2015. He was then provided a 45-day aftercare
program. He was advised to remain abstinent from alcohol and opioids. In August 2015,
he successfully completed a workout-based life coaching program. (Tr. at 49-50, 51-57,
59, 97-99; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachments K, L, P, R, S; GE 2, 5)
Applicant did not use heroin after his discharge from the facility, but he returned
to  abusing  alcohol  and  opioids,  including  fentanyl  (SOR  ¶  2.b).  He  was  again  driving
under the influence of opioids and alcohol when he was arrested in December 2015. His
BAC  was  about  two  times  the  legal  limit.  He  was  charged  with  DUI  and  alcohol-
restricted  driver.  In  March  2016,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI,  and  the  alcohol-restricted
driver charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to four days in jail and a fine (SOR  ¶
1.c). (Tr. at 51-55, 102-103; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachment M; GE 4)
There  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  has  used  any  illegal  controlled  substances
after 2016. His  parents,  who  could  always  tell when  he  was  using,  have not observed
any indication of use in years. He returned to the workout-based program in 2016. He
enrolled  in  a  90-day  workout  and  addiction-recovery  program  in  March  2019.  The
program  “requires  at  least  90  days  of  commitment  to  strenuous  activity,  dedication  to
sobriety, and active involvement in [their] fitness, nutritional, spiritual, and life coaching
curriculum.”  He  continues  to  be  actively  involved  in  the  program,  and  he  sees  a
therapist   unrelated   to   that  program.  He   has  learned   to   deal  with   his  back  pain   with
ibuprofen   and   an   active   lifestyle.   He  is  motivated   by   his  children   and   his  faith   to   stay
clean.  He  has   disassociated   himself   from   drug-using   associates  and   contacts,  and   he
passed   numerous  drug   tests.   He  signed   a  statement  of  intent   to   abstain  from   all   drug
involvement  and   substance   misuse,  acknowledging   that  any   future  involvement  or
misuse  is grounds  for revocation  of national security  eligibility.  (Tr. at 59-65,  70-82,  100-
102,  107-121,  125-126, 135; Applicant’s response  to  SOR,   attachments O,  P,  Q,  T,  U;
GE  2; AE A, B)
In  2020,  Applicant  was  prescribed  a  prescription  opioid  to  deal  with  pain  in  a
tooth before a root canal (SOR ¶ 4.a). He did not enjoy the experience and did not use
the  drugs  again  after  the  procedure  was  completed.  He  stated  that  he  has  not  had
cravings for opioids in four or five years, and the short use of a prescription medication
in 2020 did not change that. (Tr. at 67-70, 94-96; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant stated that he does not believe that alcohol was ever his real problem,
and  that  he  never  really  enjoyed  large  amounts  of  alcohol.  As  such,  he  does  not  feel
that  he  has  to  completely  abstain.  He  describes  his  drinking  as  occasional  and
responsible. He stated that his last drink was in November 2021 (SOR ¶ 3.f). (Tr. at 45,
50, 65-67; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August  2018.  He  reported  most  of  his  substance  abuse  and  criminal  history,  but  he
intentionally  failed  to  report  his  heroin  use  (SOR  ¶  4.b).  He  admitted  that  he  felt,  and
continues to feel, shame about his heroin use. (Tr. at 56-58, 103; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  June  2019.  He
discussed  his  addiction  to  opioid  painkillers,  including  oxycodone,  but  he  did  not
mention heroin use. He admitted heroin use in interrogatories in January 2020 after he
was specifically asked about heroin use as documented in records obtained by the DOD
from  the  substance  abuse  treatment  facility  where  Applicant  was  treated  in  2014  and
2015. He admitted at his hearing that if the DOD did not know about his heroin use, he
would  be  conflicted  and  it  would  be  very  hard  to  discuss  it,  even  at  his  hearing.  He
clarified that if he was directly asked about his heroin use, he would be honest.  (Tr. at
104-106; GE 2)
Applicant  called  three  witnesses,  and  he  submitted  documents  and  letters
attesting to his excellent job performance and strong moral character. He is praised for
his dedication, reliability, competence, enthusiasm, attention to detail, leadership, work
ethic,  trustworthiness,  and  integrity.  (Tr.  at  19-61;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,

"Applicant  is a  37-year-old  senior principal  aeronautical  engineer,  who  has  been
employed by a defense contractor since January 2009. (GE 1; Tr. 12-13) He has held a
secret  clearance  since  2009,  and  seeks  to  retain  it  as  a  requirement  of  his  continued
employment. (GE 1; Tr. 13-14)
Applicant graduated  from  high  school in June  2003. He was awarded  a  bachelor
of   science   degree   in   aerospace   engineering   in  June   2008   from   one   of   the   most

During  summer  2005,  between  his  sophomore  and  junior  years  in  college,
Applicant was paralyzed following an off-road ATV motorcycle accident. Since then, he
has  been  permanently  confined  to  a  wheel  chair.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  18;  AE  I)  As  a
result, he suffers from chronic back pain in addition to fatigue and soreness. (Tr. 18)
Applicant’s pain management has improved throughout the years. (Tr. 24) When
he  returned  to  college after his accident,  the on-campus  medical  team prescribed  him
“some  prescription-grade”  pain  medications.  After  college,  his  doctors  prescribed
various  pain  medication  options  to  include  opioids.  He  chose  not  to  use  opioids  given
their  addictive  qualities,  especially  after  observing  many  individuals  in  the  spinal  cord
injury community become addicted to opioids. Rather, he chose to live with his pain and
take only over-the-counter medications like Advil. (Tr. 18-19, 42-44, 46, 61; AE K)
In  about  2008  or  2009,  Applicant  began  participating  in  an  adaptive  sports
program and met other wheelchair users who could relate to his situation. This program
offered  various  activities,  like  basketball  and  cycling.  Applicant  credits  his  association
with  this group  as  being  the  most  “influential or consequential aspect”  of  his recovery,
especially  when  it  came  to  managing  his  spinal  cord  injury  through  exercise,  which
enabled him to. reduce “a lot of the pain” in his back. (Tr. 19-21, 24-25, 44-45)
Applicant considered using marijuana to control his pain after learning of success
stories from fellow members of the spinal cord injury community. He stated most of his
pain  came from muscle  fatigue,  usually  in  his  back.  He  has  no feeling  in  his  legs,  but
does  experience  “a  lot  of  muscle  spasms”  and  found  that  marijuana  relaxed  his  back
muscles and spasms.  See discussion, infra. (Tr. 21-23, 44-45)
Applicant  still experiences  pain, but  it  is not as  severe  as  it  once was  and  over
the  years  he  has  developed  a  certain  degree  of  tolerance.  He  initially  tried  over  the
counter  medications  such  as  ibuprofen  and  later  marijuana.  Today,  he  does  not  take
anything for his pain except ibuprofen occasionally. Since  April 2019, he has not used
marijuana and has no intention of using it in the future. (Tr. 25, 46-47, 53)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  self-reported  marijuana  use  on  his  April  25,  2019  SF-86.  (GE  1)  He
was  subsequently  interviewed  on  June  12,  2019,  by  an  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) investigator regarding his marijuana use. (GE 3) He elaborated on
his marijuana use in his January 3, 2021 SOR Answer as well as during his testimony.
The following summarizes that marijuana use.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
about  March  2004  to  about  April  2019.  He  admitted  this  allegation  with  explanations.
(SOR Answer) He first used marijuana in 2004, at age 19,  on two separate occasions
while in college. A college friend “offered” the marijuana to him on these two occasions,
both of which predate his paralysis. He did not use marijuana after these two occasions
because he “did not particularly enjoy it.” (Tr. 26-28, 40, 56)
Applicant  did  not use  marijuana  again until 2011, after  receiving  his first medical
marijuana  card. He did  so  with  “varying  frequency” to  address his chronic back pain and
muscle  spasms   relating   to   his  paralysis.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  21-23,  26,  45,  56-57)   His
marijuana  usage  beginning  in 2011, “would have  been  on  average  once to  twice a  week
as needed.” He  added, “But,  like  I said, that  would be  on  average. But then  there  were
would  also  be  periods   or weeks, many   weeks  in  between   where I   wouldn’t  have   any.”
There were times when  he  did not use marijuana for months  or years  at a  time.  (Tr. 27-
28, 48-49,  54, 56; GE   3)  When  Applicant used  marijuana, it was typically  at home  or, if
with   other
the   wheelchair   basketball   community   at
tournaments. (Tr. 47-48, 54-55)
it  was  within
individuals,
Applicant’s  decision  to  completely  stop  using  marijuana  “was  more  of  like  a
phasing out.” He added that a side effect of marijuana use was dehydration. As a spinal
cord  injury  patient,  he  found  it  necessary  to  avoid  dehydration,  which  could  lead  to
bladder infections. Through exercise and a disciplined diet, he used marijuana less and
was able to mitigate the need for its use. (Tr. 33-34, 49-50, 54, 57-58) He had started to
reduce his marijuana use before he filled out his SF-86 in April 2019. (Tr. 54) Applicant
also  knew  that  continued  marijuana  use  would  compound  problems  qualifying  for  a
security clearance. (Tr. 52-53)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant purchased marijuana from about March 2004 to
about  April  2019.  He  “mostly  admit(ted)”  this  allegation  with  explanations.  (SOR
Answer) He did not purchase marijuana in 2004, but rather a friend in college offered it
to him on two separate occasions. The first time he purchased marijuana was  after he
received his first medical marijuana card in 2011 from a medical marijuana dispensary.
He  never  purchased  marijuana  “off  the  streets.”  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  23-24,  28)
Applicant’s medical marijuana card expired in 2018. He has not renewed it nor does he
have any intention of doing so. (Tr. 24; AE J)
SOR  ¶   1.c   alleges  that  Applicant   used   and   purchased   marijuana   with   varying
frequency, from  about April 2009  to  about April 2019, while  granted  access to  classified
information. He admitted this allegation.  See  discussion under SOR ¶ 1.a  supra. (Tr. 26-
27)
Applicant  purchased  marijuana
for  pain  management  only  at  marijuana
dispensaries.  Applicant  did  not  share  with  his  employer  his  use  of  marijuana  for  pain
management stating, “some people probably would have been okay with it . . . others . .
.  may  have  some  objections  to  it.”  Applicant  did  not  discuss  his  pain  management
issues  with  management  primarily  because  he  considered  it  a  personal  issue  and
desired to maintain professionalism in the work place. (Tr. 29-31, 56-57)
If  his  clearance  is  renewed,  Applicant  stated  that  he  would  continue  to  abstain
from  all  drugs  in  the  future  to  include  marijuana.  (Tr.  35)  Applicant  takes  his  job  and
security  “very  seriously”  and  stated  that  he  is  not  a  threat  to  national  security.  He  is
trusted by his coworkers, management, and customers and has received promotions for
his work in support of the national defense. (Tr. 34)
Applicant  has  not  used  marijuana  since  April  2019.  (Tr.  53)  He  does  not
associate  with  anyone  who  uses  marijuana.  (Tr.  60)  Applicant  submitted  a  signed,
sworn, statement of intent, dated June 15, 2021, to avoid any future drug use or other
illegal  drugs  both  presently  and  in  the  future,  with  the  understanding  that  any  drug
violation  will  result  in  the.  automatic  revocation  of  clearance.  (Tr.  25-26;  AE  H)  Post-
hearing, Applicant submitted a negative drug test dated June 30, 2021. (AE L)
Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶   2.a   alleges   that  Applicant   falsified   his  March   31,  2009   SF-86   and
deliberately   failed   to   disclose   his  past   marijuana   use   when   he   answered   “no”  to   the
question  whether he  had  illegally  used  any  controlled  substance  in  the  last  seven  years.
Applicant admitted  this allegation with explanations. (SOR Answer)
Applicant  stated  he  “regretfully”  failed  to  disclose  his  2004  two-time  college
marijuana  use.  He  further explained  when  he  completed  his 2009 SF-86,  he  “deemed
these  2  occasions  as  insignificant  and  not  worthy  of  acknowledgement  since  [he]
thereafter  never  used   marijuana   through   2009.”  He   realizes  now   that   failing   to   list  his
2004   marijuana   use,  regardless  of   how   insignificant  it  may   have   been,  was  not  a
judgment for him  to  make. (SOR Answer)  When  Applicant completed  his 2009  SF-86, it
was his first job  out of college  and   he  “felt like  it was negligible  enough  to  dismiss . . .
per  [his]  judgement  at   the   time.”  This   was  also  the   first  time   he   applied   for  a   security
clearance. (Tr. 31-32, 40-41)
Applicant stated that since 2009, he has matured and grown, and now strives to
be  a  responsible  citizen,  human  being,  brother,  son,  and  coworker.  He  disclosed  his
2004  two-time  marijuana  use  in  the  interest  of  honesty,  peace  of  mind,  and  peace  of
conscience. (Tr. 32-33)
Character Evidence
Applicant  submitted  his  work  performance  reviews  for  2019  and  2020.  Those
reviews  document  sustained  superior  performance  and  rate  him  as  a  “top  performer.”
Management views  him as a  subject matter expert and placed him  in leadership roles
and  positions  of  responsibility.  Applicant  is  a  trusted  employee  within  his  company  as
well  as  with  his  company’s  customer  base.  (Tr.  37-38;  AE  C)  Applicant  informed  his
manager of these proceedings in early 2021 “to give him a heads up to some extent in
the  event  that  [he  was]  denied  a  clearance.”  He  did  so  to  mitigate  the  loss  to  the
company  of  him  being  terminated  as  a  result  of  his  clearance being  denied.  Applicant
stated  that  his manager “certainly  hopes for  a  positive  outcome.”  (Tr. 50-51) When  he
disclosed  his  past  marijuana  use  to  his  manager,  his  manager  could  have  started  the
termination process, but did not do so. (Tr. 55-56)
Applicant  has  received  two  company  awards  for:  (1)  his  leadership  role  in
company  diversity  in  Employee  Resource  Groups;  and  (2)  nomination  for  a  company
president leadership award for his efforts in securing “a major program.” Applicant also
received  various  monetary  awards  in  the  form  of  bonuses  for  his  work-related
accomplishments. (Tr. 38-39; AE D)
Applicant  submitted  two  reference  letters  from:  (1)  former  college  classmate,
coworker,  and  lifelong  friend,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  18  years;  and  (2)  staff
engineer/co-worker, top secret clearance holder, and 35-year company employee, who
has known Applicant 15 years. (Tr. 35-36; AE E) Reference (1) described how he and
Applicant  went  to  the  same  prestigious  university  and  survived  in  a  very  demanding
academic  environment  where  they  threw  “the  kitchen  sink  at  you”  and  how  it  took
everything in oneself “to stay afloat.” Reference (1) discussed how they went to work for
the same defense contractor where he saw Applicant “take ownership and leadership in
re-constructing and  modernizing  fundamental software  critical to  [defense  contractor’s]
design.”  The  writer  noted  Applicant’s  attention  to  detail  and  uncompromising  integrity.
He discussed how Applicant overcame his spinal cord injury and did not let it hinder him
in his work or attitude. (AE E),
Reference  (2)  has  knowledge  of  the  SOR  allegations  against  Applicant.  In  the
last 15 years, he has worked closely with Applicant. Reference (2) knows Applicant well
and   has first-hand   knowledge   of   his work ethic  and   character.  He described   Applicant
as  someone   with   “excellent  judgment”  and   an   employee   “entrusted   with   increasingly
responsible  positions  of leadership.” He  added  that at no  time  has anyone  on  their  team
or in management questioned  Applicant’s ability  to  lead  effectively  and  protect sensitive
information.   Reference   (2)  noted   that   if   Applicant  was  unable  to   perform   his  current
duties,  their   company   would  lose   one   of   their   most  valuable  leaders.  He  added   the

Applicant submitted three photographs depicting him in various settings. The first
one is of him in his wheel chair playing basketball, the second is of him on a hand cycle,
and the third is of him with his extended family. The hand cycle photograph depicts him
as an adaptive sports program member participating in a program fundraiser. Applicant
credits his family with providing him with moral support and the “number one reason” he
is  where  he  is  today.  It  was  his  closeness  with  his  family  that  caused  him  to  relocate
nearer  to  them.  (Tr.  36-37,  58-60;  AE  F)  The  last  two  photographs  are  of  Applicant’s

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  28-year-old  welder-training  specialist  employed  by  defense
contractors since March 2015. He married in May 2019 and has three children, ages 17,
16, and 2. He received a security clearance in April 2015. (FORM Item 8.)
Applicant used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  2008  to  June  2017. When
he   submitted   an   SCA  in  April  2015,  he   answered   “No”  to   a   question   asking   if   he   had
illegally  used  any  drugs or controlled  substances during  the  last seven  years, and  did not
disclose  his marijuana  use. (FORM  Item  4  at 27.) He  received  a  security  clearance  on  a
date  not reflected  in the  record, but before July  15, 2015, when  he  signed  a  nondisclosure
agreement.   (FORM   Item   8.)   He   continued   to   use   marijuana,   as   well   as  heroin   and
cocaine, while holding  a security clearance.
In 2016, Applicant began using heroin, in addition to using cocaine regularly and
marijuana  occasionally.  In  February  2017,  Applicant  self-admitted  to  a  drug-treatment
facility  and  received  inpatient  treatment  for  alcohol  and  cocaine  dependence.  He  was
released  in  March  2017.  The  treatment  recommendations  upon  discharge  included
avoiding  activities  that  involve  alcohol  or  other  drugs.  He  began  attending  Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) meetings in early 2017.
In June 2017 Applicant intentionally overdosed on his prescribed Trazadone. After
being treated in an emergency room for the overdose, he was readmitted into the drug-
treatment  facility.  In  June  and  July  2017,  he  received  inpatient  treatment  for  cocaine
dependence, cannabis abuse, and opioid abuse.
In July 2017, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor driving while intoxicated
(DWI)  and  refusing  a  blood  or  breath  test.  In  accordance  with  a  plea  agreement,  he
pleaded guilty to refusing a blood or breath test, and the DWI charge was dismissed. He
was sentenced to a fine, and his driver’s license was suspended for one year. From July
2017  to  September  2017,  he  received  outpatient  treatment  for  “alcohol  use  disorder
(severe,  dependence).”  Based  on  his  arrest  for  DWI,  his  security  clearance  was
suspended in September 2017.
The DWI charge triggered an interview by a security investigator in March 2018.
During  the  interview,  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  not  illegally  used  any
drugs  or  controlled  substances  during  the  past  seven  years.  He  denied  misusing
prescription drugs. He also told the investigator that he had not sought or been ordered
to receive counseling or treatment for using drugs or controlled substances. (FORM Item
5 at 6.) In his answer to the SOR, he admitted that his statements to the investigator were
false. (FORM Item 2 at 2.)
Applicant was fired by a defense contractor in January 2019 for coming to work
under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. He was hired by another defense contractor
with no significant period of unemployment.
In Applicant’s response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he has been sober
since he was fired in January 2019. (FORM Item 5 at  14.) In his most recent SCA, he
stated that he now attends AA meetings regularly and has a sponsor who has been sober
for 32 years. (FORM Item 3 at 37, 47.)

"Applicant  is  43  years  old.  He  is  married  and  has  four  children.  He  has  a
Master’s degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Cloud Architect.  He is

Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  has  no  prior  military  service.  He  began  working  for  his  current
employer  in  May  2019.  He  was  granted  an  interim  Top  Secret  security  clearance  on
May 7, 2020.  (Government Exhibit 9.)
Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.  Applicant
has  a  long  history  of  marijuana  use.  From  about  2004  until  at  least  August  2021,
Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana  with  varying  frequency.  He  also  used
marijuana  while  possessing  a  security  clearance  from  May  2020  to  at  least  August
2021.
In  about  March  2020  and  August  2021,  Applicant  stated  that  he  intended  to
continue using marijuana as prescribed to him by his licensed physician.  (Government
Exhibits 2 through 9, except Government Exhibit 6.)
In  2010,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  eye  disease.  Applicant  stated  that  over
the  years,  he  has  had  many  care  providers  that  have  tried  multiple  ophthalmic
medications  to  help  his  condition,  but  that  his  attacks  subsided  and  his  eye  pressure
stabilized  only after he  started using medicinal marijuana in 2018.  Applicant  indicates
that since August 2018 to at least January 2021, he has been under the care of Cheryl
Williams,  MD.,  of  Herban  Medical  Solutions.  Applicant  was  prescribed  medicinal
marijuana for glaucoma and degenerative eye condition.  Applicant used the marijuana
daily.  Applicant provided documentary evidence from his physician approving treatment
of  his  eye  conditions  with  cannabis  on  August  22,  2018,  with  renewals  in  September
2019, and September 2020.  (Government Exhibit 5.)
In  his  interrogatories  dated  August  2,  2021,  Applicant  answered,  “Yes”,  to  the
question  that  asked  him  if  he  has  decided  to  stop  using  substances  prohibited  under
Federal law.  (Government Exhibit 6.)  This recent statement of intent fails to clearly and
convincingly  demonstrate  Applicant’s  commitment  to  discontinue  his  marijuana  use,
especially when weighed against his previous statements that he intended to continue
using   marijuana   because   of  its  medical  benefits.     (Government  Exhibits  2   through   9,
except Government Exhibit 6.)
While  marijuana  use  may  have  been  legalized  under  certain  state  laws,  it
remains illegal under Federal law that governs the requirements to qualify for access to
classified information.  Marijuana use is strictly prohibited under Federal law.  It is also
against DoD policy and defense contractor regulations.

Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  & Guideline E  - Personal
Conduct
1.a.,   1.b.,   and   2.b.  Applicant  admits  that  she  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency from about February of 2007 until about July of 2008. She also admits to this
usage on at least two occasions while granted access to classified information.
1.c., 1.d., and  2.b.
Applicant admits that she again used marijuana with varying
frequency from about May of 2019 until about April of 2020. She also admits to this usage
on at least five occasions while granted access to classified information.

"The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used  marijuana with varying
frequency from approximately October 2003 to about May 2020 (SOR ¶ 1.a), including
after he was granted a DOD security clearance in July 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.b). (Item 1.) When
he answered the SOR, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana in the past, but not while
employed by the U.S. government. After resigning from federal civilian service in July 2011
and  moving  abroad  for  his  now  ex-wife’s  education,  he  resumed  using  marijuana
“sporadically.” (Item 2.) Applicant’s admission to having used marijuana is accepted and
incorporated as a factual finding. After considering Items 1 through 5 in the FORM, I make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old and divorced. He and his ex-wife were married from June
2011 to January 2014. He has been in a cohabitant relationship since October 2018. He
has no children. He earned a bachelor’s degree  in  electrical engineering in May 2005.
(Item 3.)
Applicant  began  his  undergraduate  studies  in  August  1999.  He  spent  the  fall
semester in 2001 at a community college and then returned to the university to finish his
degree. He used marijuana recreationally during his last two years in college, starting in
October  2003.  (Items  3-4.)  No  information  was  provided  as  to  whether  Applicant  was
employed in the year following his graduation from college.
From May 2006 to July 2011, Applicant was employed as an electrical engineer for
the U.S. government. (Items 3-4.) He was granted a DOD secret clearance for his duties in
July  2006.  (Item  5.)  Applicant  did  not  use  any  marijuana  while  working  for  the  U.S.
government. (Items 2, 4.)
In July 2011, Applicant resigned from his federal civil service job, and in August
2011, he moved overseas with his then spouse, who began her master’s degree studies in
a program co-sponsored by business schools in the United States and the foreign country
(country X). (Item 3.) Applicant resumed using marijuana while living in country X. (Item 4.)
Applicant was unemployed in country X from August 2011 until April 2012, when he
started  working  as  a  test  engineer  in  the  commercial  sector.  Applicant’s  marriage
deteriorated abroad, and in June 2013, he quit his job in country X and returned to the
United States. Initially, he lived with his mother and was unemployed. (Item 3.)
In October 2013, Applicant relocated to his present area. He worked part time in the
restaurant industry primarily. He also worked part-time for a tech shop from March 2015 to
February 2016, when he was laid off; and from July 2016 to June 2017, as a self-employed
product engineer for a start-up company that went out of business. In December 2018, he
quit  working  as  a  bartender  to  focus  on  finding  a  job  in  the  tech  industry.  He  was
unemployed until June 2019, when he began working as a part-time tutor. In September
2020, he accepted an offer of employment as an engineer and developer for a defense
contractor. The job is contingent on him obtaining a DOD secret clearance. (Item 3.)
On  September  30,  2020,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  as  accurate  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86).  He responded affirmatively to an SF
86 inquiry concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years and reported that he had
used marijuana. He provided dates of October 2003 for his first use and May 2020 for his
most recent use, and added, “I occasionally have used marijuana for recreational use, or to
help reduce anxiety and help sleep. Frequency 0 – 3 times a week, do not know number of
times.” He denied any use of marijuana while possessing a security clearance and any
intention to use marijuana in the future, citing the importance of his career path to him. He
indicated that he did not want to be seen as unreliable or as a liability. (Item 3.)
Applicant was asked about his illegal drug involvement during his November 16,
2020 PSI. He related that he could not specify the frequency of his marijuana use as it
differed  each  week.  He  explained  that  there  were  long  periods  when  he  did  not  use
marijuana, including during the time that he possessed a security clearance. He affirmed
his  SF  86  disclosure  of  having  used  marijuana  from  zero  to  three  times  per  week;
characterized his marijuana use as solely recreational; and related that it occurred in his
apartment with lots of friends, who brought the drug with them. He found marijuana to be
calming and relaxing. He expressed that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future,
as he desired a career in the tech industry, and to that end, he was no longer in contact
with the persons with whom he had used marijuana in the past. (Item 4.)
In response to the SOR, Applicant explained about his marijuana use (SOR ¶ 1.a)
that he first used the drug “around October 2003 to May 2005” while he was in college. He
stated that he “did not use marijuana at all” as a federal employee, but after resigning his
position in July 2011, he moved to country X for  his now ex-wife’s graduate  education
“[w]here [he] imbibed a marijuana cigarette.” In response to SOR ¶ 1.b, Applicant stated
that he used marijuana sporadically after he resigned from his federal job:
Outside of employment with the Federal Government and with no interaction
with  any  former government  employees  or government  entities  is when  I
again used marijuana sporadically. But at NO time during my employment as
a Federal Government Employee was marijuana used. (Item 2.)

"The  SOR  contains  one  allegation that  Applicant  used marijuana from  January
2012  to  November  2021.  (Answer  to  SOR)  In  her  February  14,  2022  answer,  she
admitted the allegation, but contended that since 2016, she only uses the drug clinically
for  anxiety  or  depression,  not  recreationally.  She  noted  that  the  drug  has  been
decriminalized  in  the  jurisdiction  where  she  lives.  She  indicated  that  her  future  use
would be as needed.
Applicant  is  25  years  old  and  single  with  a  four-year-old  son.  She  attended
college between 2014 and 2016, and 2017 to the present, but received no degree. She
is  currently  being  sponsored  by  a  defense  contractor,  and  has  been  working  as  a
community support worker since March 2020. She was unemployed from August 2019
to  March  2020.  She  was  employed  in  three  restaurant  positions  between  November
2017 and August 2019. (Item 2 at 10-22)
In her March 2021 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that she used marijuana. (Item 2)
Her  reason  for  use  was  anxiety  and  depression.  Although  she  was  not  formally
diagnosed by a doctor, she discussed her use with her mental health practitioner. She
noted  that  her  first  use  was  in  2012.  Her  most  recent  use  was  in  March  2021.  She
indicated that, “I have not used marijuana  consistently since 2011 (she probably meant
to  state  2012  because  she  identified  her  first  use  as  2012).  She  noted,  “However[,]
since the beginning of 2020, I have used it on an as needed basis.”  (Item 2 at 34) She
indicated  that  she  did  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  Instead,  after  her
discussions with her mental health practitioner of alternative methods of easing anxiety,
she  intended  to  use  medication,  writing,  and  gaming  to  relieve  her  anxiety.  Applicant
never sought treatment for marijuana use. (Item 2 at 33-35)
In her April 26, 2021 PSI with the OPM investigator, Applicant stated she was
using marijuana three times a week, but, less than two months after she submitted her
e-QIP,  she  could  not  recall  when  she  first  started  using  the  drug.  She  noted  that  she
was purchasing about seven grams of the drug as needed. In  her November 23, 2021
interrogatory answers, she claimed her first use was in January 2019 and her last use
was  in  November  2021.  She  described  her  marijuana  use  as  occurring  three  to  four
times  a  week.  Her  future  intentions  were  to  use  marijuana  to  reduce  stress,  but  she
would discontinue use if required. On November 23, 2021, Applicant indicated that her
interrogatory  answers  were  accurate.  On  November  29,  2021,  she  confirmed  that  the
April  2021  PSI  accurately  reflected  the  discussions  she  had  with  the  investigator.

"Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency from about November 2020 until about December 2020, while granted access
to classified information. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted using marijuana
between November 2019 and December 2019, not in 2020. He further stated that he was
not  working  in  a  cleared  position  and  was  not  aware  that  he  had  an  active  security
clearance. These issues will be more fully discussed below.
Applicant,  31,  is  a  legislative  analyst  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since
March 2021. He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from July 2012
through July 2016. He received his bachelor’s degree in 2019 and his master’s degree in
2020. He is currently pursuing a graduate level certificate in legislative studies with an
anticipated graduation date of August 2023. He was granted his first security clearance
while  on  active  duty  in  the  military.  He  was  re-investigated  for  a  security  clearance  in
approximately 2017/2018 while working for a Federal-contractor marketing agency. (GX
3; GX 4; Answer.)
On his March 2021 e-QIP, in response to Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug
Activity, Applicant answered “yes” to having used illegal drugs in the past seven years.
He  listed  his  dates  of  use  as  November  2019  to  December  2019,  explaining  “in  late
2019/2020 I smoked weed. This renewed the fact that drugs are not for me.” He further
stated, “I tried  it once  or twice and  have  not  touched  the  drug  since  with  no  plans to.” In
providing  an  explanation  for why  he  does or  does  not intend  any  future use,  Applicant
stated,  “I   don’t  like   it.   It  was  legal in the   area   I  was  in   and  even   then  I  just   do  not   like
smoking. To  be  quite  honest, the  smell  of  smoke  in  general is  what ruins it for me.” (GX
3.)
The   summary   of   Applicant’s  May   2021   personal  subject   interview   (PSI)  was
submitted  with  the  FORM  as GX  4, to  which Applicant did not  object. In  the  PSI,  Applicant
stated  that between  November and  December 2019, “he  smoked  THC/marijuana  twice
with  friends  when  they  were at a  local pub. [Applicant] stated  he  took  1-2  puffs of  one  joint
the  two  times  he  smoked.” He  further stated  that he  did not  continue  smoking  marijuana
because  “it was not for  him  and  he  really  did not enjoy  it.” He also  stated  that he  had  no
future intention of  marijuana use. (GX 4.)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated,  “I  admit  to  a  single  infraction  of
Guideline H.” He further explained:
The   date   of   the   infraction   was  between   November  and   December  2019,
during  my  time… working  on  my  master’s degree…. I did not  have  access
to  classified  information  when  the  infraction  took place  When  the  infraction
happened, I was in an  area  that had  decriminalized  the  federally  banned
substance  and  an  opportunity  presented  itself  to  try  this substance  to  which
I  obliged.  After  this,  I  made   the   decision   to   not  continue   usage.  .  .  .  this
action  is  not reflective  of  my  character . .  . I  hope  the  Administrative  Judge
looks upon  this as  an  honest  mistake  and  not a  character defining  moment.
In his response to the FORM, Applicant’s attorney stated that Applicant:
is an accomplished, intelligent person, but he is not an attorney, much less
a government attorney with a focus on personnel security or the nuanced
differences  between  decriminalized  marijuana  use  and  local  jurisdictions
and federal policy continue to prohibit it. . . . when he believed he was not
in violation of any rule, he accepted marijuana from an acquaintance when
it was offered, experimentally. The drug use did not continue; it occurred
only once or twice.
Based  on  the  entirety  of  the  record, I find  that the  dates  of  Applicant’s marijuana
usage set forth in the  SOR allegation are erroneous. Applicant’s marijuana use occurred
between November and December 2019.
The   only   record  evidence   regarding   Applicant’s  security   clearance   history   was
provided by Applicant.  On his e-QIP, he listed that he was granted a  secret clearance by
the  Air  Force  while  on  active  duty, but  was not able to  provide  a  date  that  the  investigation
was  completed   or  when   the   clearance   was  granted.  He   also   listed   an   investigation
performed  by  the  Department of the  Navy  which  was completed  in  December 2017. He
did not know the date that access was granted. He listed his dates of employment with
this Federal contractor as December 2017 to December 2018.
In his answer to the SOR, while asserting that he “did not have access to classified
information when the infraction took place,” Applicant stated:
The current FSO Security Portal that I have access to states that DoDCAF
granted my SECRET clearance in April 2019 to which I was sadly unaware.
To  my  knowledge,  upon  my  separation  from  the  Military  in  2016,  my
clearance was only sponsored temporarily by OPM during 2018 while I was
employed for a Navy recruiting contract in Nashville, Tennessee. Outside
of this timeframe, I was to believe that my clearance was listed as inactive
or  unsponsored.  I  did  not  have  direct  or  indirect  access  to  classified
information  for  the  years  of  2018-2021.  My  access  to  information  was
renewed  upon  my  employment  in  March  2021  which  promoted  this
investigation.
In the FORM, the Government argues that Applicant was on notice, as a result of
undergoing the security clearance process, that using illegal drugs while possessing a
security  clearance  would  raise  a  security  concern.  The  Government  goes  on  to  argue
that:
Despite this, he knowingly and intentionally chose to use illegal drugs. His
decision to use illegal drugs (while possessing a security clearance), raises
questions regarding Applicant’s decision-making, reliability and willingness
to  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  that  are  paramount  in  protecting
classified information.
In   the   Applicant’s  response   to   the   FORM,  Applicant’s  attorney   disputes  the
statement  that  Applicant  knowingly   and   intentionally   used   illegal drugs  while   holding   a
security   clearance   on   two   grounds.  First,  Applicant  did  not  know   he   held  a   security
clearance  at  the  time  and  did not  have  access  to  classified  information. Second,  Applicant
used   marijuana   in   a   jurisdiction   where   it  was  decriminalized   and   at  the   time   of  usage
believed it to be legal.
According  to  https://www.nysenate.gov,  on  July 29,  2019,  the  Governor  of  New
York  signed  into  law  the  decriminalization  of  marijuana.  The  law  decriminalized
possession  of  small  amounts  of  marijuana  by  removing  criminal  penalties  for  unlawful
possession and by reducing the penalty to a violation punishable by a fine. On March 31,
2021, the Governor of New York signed into law the legalization of recreational marijuana
for adults age 21 and older, permitting the use, smoking, ingesting, or other consumption
of  cannabis  products  and  possession  of  up  to  3  ounces  or  24  grams  of  concentrated
cannabis.
Applicant’s  response   to   the   FORM   also  cites  the   December  21,  2021,
Memorandum  for Distribution  from  the  Director of  National Intelligence, Avril D. Haines
(the  Haines  Memorandum) which provides clarifying  guidance  concerning  marijuana  for
agencies involved  in conducting  security  clearance  and  positions of  trust adjudications.
Specifically,  the   Haines  Memorandum   states,  “Based   on   current  federal  law,  I  provide
additional  adjudicative   guidance   herein   on   three   topics  that  have   generated   ongoing
inquiries from  federal agencies: 1) recency of  recreational marijuana  use….”
The  memorandum   states,  “with   regard  to   the  first  topic,  agencies are  instructed
that prior recreational marijuana  use  by  an  individual may  be  relevant to  adjudications but
not  determinative.”  It   then   sets   forth   the   factors  to   be   considered   when   evaluating   a
person’s  security   worthiness  under  the   “whole-person   concept.”   The   memorandum
further states that:
relevant  mitigations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  frequency  of  use  and
whether the individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur,
including  by  signing  an  attestation  or  other  such  appropriate  mitigation.
Additionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting
illegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security
clearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security
workforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use
upon initiation of the national security vetting  process, which commences
once the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form
86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. (AX G.)
I have considered the Haines Memorandum and Applicant’s attorney’s arguments based
on her interpretations of the applicability of it to Applicant’s case.
Applicant  stated   in  his  response   to   the   form   that  he   voluntarily   disclosed   his
marijuana  use  to  the Government despite “there being  no legal ramifications or record of
it.” He provided  the  results of two  negative  drug  tests dated  July  15, 2020,  and  January
27,  2022.  (AX  F.) He  also provided  a  statement of  intent not  to  use  any  illegal controlled
substance  in the  future  and  stipulated  to  his willingness to  undergo  random  drug  testing
and  to  have  his security  clearance  immediately  revoked  in the  event of  any  future positive
drug   test.   (AX   H.)  Applicant  stated   in  his  response   to   the   FORM   that  he   regrets  his
marijuana   use   and  no   longer associates  with   the   acquaintance   with   whom  he   smoked
marijuana in  2019.
Applicant’s  three   character  references,  a   friend   and   former  roommate   who   has
known  Applicant for  nine  years, a
friend  of nine  years with  whom  Applicant  served  in  the

Applicant  also   served   in  the   Air   Force,   were   aware  of  the   issues   raised   in   the   SOR.

"Applicant  is  33  years  old.  She  is not  married  and  has  no  children.  She  has a
Bachelor’s  degree.  Applicant holds a full time position  with  a  defense  contractor as  a
Software Engineer.  She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with this
employment.  The  SOR  alleges  security  concerns  under  three  of  the  following  four
guidelines:
Guideline  I –  Psychological Condition:   The Government alleges that Applicant has
an emotional, mental, and personality condition that can impair judgment, reliability, or
trustworthiness.  Applicant denies the allegation set forth under this allegation.
Guideline   G  –   Alcohol  Consumption:  The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant
engages in excessive alcohol consumption that can lead to the exercise of questionable
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about her reliability
and  trustworthiness.  The  SOR  refers  to  allegation  1.b.,  which  does  not  exist.
Accordingly, there is no finding for or against the Applicant under this guideline.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:   The  Government alleges  that
Applicant has used controlled substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are
used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their  intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions
about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.  Applicant admits with explanation the
allegations  set  forth  in  3.a.,  and  3.b.  The  SOR  refers  to  allegation  3.c.,  which  does  not
exist.  Accordingly, there is no finding for or against the Applicant for 3.c.
Guideline   E   –   Personal   Conduct:   The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has
engaged  in  conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or
unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  that  can  raise  questions  about  her
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  The
Applicant admits with explanation the allegations set forth under this guideline.
Applicant  began  working  for  her  current  employer  in  March  2015.  Applicant
completed a security clearance application dated September 21, 2016.  In response to
questions  in  Section  23,  Applicant  was  asked.  “In  the  last  seven  years,  have  you
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances?”  The  Applicant  answered,  “NO.”
Applicant deliberately failed to disclose that she used marijuana with varying frequency
from  about  high  school  to  at  least  2015.  She  also  failed  to  list  her  use  of  ecstasy  in
2018, while granted a security clearance.  Furthermore, Applicant did not report to her
facility  security  officer  that  she  used  ecstasy  in  2018  as  required  by  DoD  policy  and
procedure.  During  her  interview  with  an  investigator  from  OPM  on  August  21,  2018,
Applicant  was  asked  why  she  did  not  tell  the  truth  about  her  illegal  drug  use  on  her
security clearance application. Applicant stated that she was afraid of losing her security
clearance.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
In regard to the use of illegal drugs, Applicant initially stated that she has never
used  any  illegal  drugs.
(Government  Exhibit  4.)  She  later  admitted  that  she  used
marijuana in high school; about once a week for the last few months of her senior year.
Then,  in  college  her  use  of  marijuana  continued  until  she  quit,  during  the  second
semester.  Applicant did not use marijuana again until 2015, when she visited Colorado
on  two  separate  occasions.  While  in  Colorado,  Applicant  smoked  marijuana  and  ate
marijuana  gummy  bears  one  or  two  times  on  each  trip.  Applicant  decided  to  use
marijuana  since  it  was  legal  in  Colorado,  and  because  she  was  on  vacation.  The
marijuana made her feel loopy, lazy, and dumb.  Applicant stated that the effects of the
gummy  bears  lasted  longer  than  when  she  would  smoke  marijuana.  Applicant  states
that she no longer uses marijuana.  (Answer to SOR.)  Applicant also admitted that in
2018,  she  used  ecstasy  at  a  music festival  in  Ireland  with  a  friend.  She  stated  that a
stranger offered it to her and she tried it.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
Applicant also stated that since April 2017, she has been seeing a mental health
counselor for general anxiety and depression.  Her therapy has continued on a weekly
basis since then.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
In  September  2019,  Applicant  was  referred  for  a  psychological  evaluation  in
relation  to  her  security  clearance  application.
(Government  Exhibit  5.)  During  the
evaluation,  Applicant  discussed  her  difficulty  managing  her  alcohol  consumption,  and
how  she  has  used  alcohol  to  cope  with  stressors  and  stressful  situations.  Applicant
stated that her work with her therapist “focuses on curtailing her drinking.”  In describing
her drinking pattern, Applicant stated that she currently does not drink during the work
week, but drinks wine on Friday and Saturdays.  She has never had a period of drinking
daily, but has “binged” in social situations.  She does not know if she has been formally
diagnosed with  depression  and anxiety,  but she  reported that  she is sad and anxious.
The last time she drank more than she wanted to was October 28, 2019.  She reported
that she had three beers.  Prior to that she drank too much around Valentines day while
on a ski trip.  She consumed about three seltzers and whiskey (about 5-6 drinks).  She
does  not  remember  everything  from  that  night,  but  knows  that  she  had  too  much  to
drink.  She  states  that  she  currently  drinks  heavily  every  couple  of  months  while  at
home.  During those times, she has said things to her roommate that she does not want
to say, and has done things she does not want to do.  For about a two-month period in
2017, she stopped drinking alcohol, and found  that she experienced increased energy
and motivation.  She then returned to her regular drinking pattern.  Applicant has never
attended  Alcoholics Anonymous  or any rehabilitation program for her alcohol problem.
(Government Exhibit 5.)
Applicant explained that in social situations, she becomes very anxious.  At least
once a month she has to leave work early because of her emotions.  Applicant admitted
that  her  alcohol  consumption  has  helped  her  connect  with  people,  but  also
acknowledged  that  it  has  made  things  worse  for  her  most  of  the  time.  (Government
Exhibit 5.)  Applicant believes that she has control over her alcohol consumption since
she tries to follow moderation management.  (Answer to SOR.)
During  the  evaluation,  Applicant  discussed  her  struggle  with  Attention  Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, reflected by an ongoing pattern of impulsivity and poor decision
making.  For  about  a  year,  Applicant  has  been  taking  a  medication  prescribed  by  her
primary  care  physician  for  her  attention  deficit  related  difficulties.  Applicant  explained
that she was having difficulty accomplishing anything at work, and felt like she was not
quite hearing what people were talking to her about.  She feels that she does not listen
well and felt overwhelmed.  She feels that overall, the medication has helped her, but it
can make her feel sick and anxious in the mornings.  (Government Exhibit 5.)
The psychologist  stated that Applicant’s above-described conditions  have led to
episodes  of  poor  judgment  and  failure  to  consider  her  behavior  and  decisions  in  the
face of her obligations related to her security clearance.  Her poor decisions  can place
her in unsafe situations that could make her a target for blackmail or at risk of coercion,
particularly when she is drinking heavily.  She is unable to stop drinking altogether and
says things she wishes she did not say to her roommate when she is home drinking on
the  weekends.  Her alcohol use  places  her  judgment  and  reliability  at  risk  as  she  has
placed  herself  in  dangerous  situations  when  drunk  or  impaired  by  alcohol,  and  later
reports that she cannot report the details.  (Government Exhibit 5.)
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder,  Major  Depressive
Disorder  and  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,  Moderate.  The  psychologist  concluded  that
Applicant’s overall prognosis is poor.  She continues to struggle to eliminate episodes of
heavy drinking, continues to experience impairing levels of depression and anxiety, and
appears insufficiently motivated to put the requirements of her security clearance before
her own desires, even when recognizing the possible security concerns of her actions.
It is also noted that given her ongoing pattern of alcohol use, her ongoing symptoms of
depression  and  anxiety,  as  well  as  her  impulsive  decision  making,  her  judgment,
reliability  and  trustworthiness  appear  impaired  which  impacts  her  capacity  to  properly
safeguard classified information.  (Government Exhibit 5.)

degree in Electrical Engineering.  He holds the position of Test Engineer.  He is seeking
to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Guideline E  – Personal Conduct
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.
From  1998  through  2001,  while  in  high  school,  Applicant  used  marijuana.  He
began  using  it  experimentally,  but  it  soon  became  a  recreational  habit.  After  high
school, in 2002, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. Applicant served on active duty
from  November  2002  to  November  2008.  In  2002,  he  applied  for  and  was  granted  a
security clearance.  He used marijuana and other illegal drugs on numerous occasions
while  in  the  Air  Force.  In  2002,  Applicant  did  not  disclose  his  illegal  drug  use  on  his
security clearance application.  Applicant testified that a friend who served in the military
told him not to.  (Tr. p. 12.)  From November 2008 to November 2014, Applicant served
in the Air National Guard.  (Tr. p. 31.)
While  on  active  duty  with  the  Air  Force,  and  after  being  granted  a  Top  Secret
security  clearance,  Applicant  used  a  variety  of  illegal  drugs  including  marijuana,
cocaine,  and  prescription  medication  such  as  Vicodin,  Percocet,  and  Rohypnol  (not
prescribed to him), Ecstacy, and Methamphetamine.  Applicant used cocaine from 1999
through  2019  with  varying  frequency,  and  at  times  while  granted  access  to  classified
information.  He used prescription medication, not prescribed to him, from 2001 to 2011,
at  times  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.  He  used  Ecstacy  and
Methamphetamines in 2009, while granted access to classified information.
In 2009,  while  serving in  the Air National Guard,  Applicant was  pulled over and
cited for possession  of  marijuana.  Applicant did  not  tell the military about  this citation
and apparently, they were not notified about it.  Applicant continued to use marijuana.  A
few months later, in 2010, Applicant was cited again for possession of marijuana.  This
time,  the  military  was  officially  notified  about  this  citation.  Applicant  lied  to  his
supervisor or first sergeant, who was filling in for the commander  at the time, and told
him  that  the  marijuana  found  in  his  car  during  his  June  2009  citation  belonged  to  his
cousin, and that he did not smoke marijuana.  This was a lie.  The marijuana was the
Applicant’s, and he had used it at the time.  Applicant’s punishment for this offense was
only  given  a  verbal  and  written  reprimand.  Applicant  was  later  asked  by  the
commander about the incident, and Applicant admitted to possession of the marijuana,
but  did  not  tell  him  that  he  was  smoking  the  marijuana  or  that  it  was  his  marijuana.
Applicant told the commander only enough to get out of the situation.  (Tr. pp. 29-30.)
At  the end  of  his commitment  term, Applicant  wanted to re-enlist, but was  told that he
was unable to do so given his history of drug use.  Apparently the police reports of the
two  citations  for  possession  of  marijuana  disclosed  that  Applicant  had  been  using
marijuana and that it was his marijuana.  This information was not timely reported to the
military legal department and so Applicant slipped through the cracks  and was able to
finish his military commitment without interruption.  Concerning the possession charges
in 2009 and 2010, the court offered the Applicant a diversion program that required him
to  complete  mandatory  drug  treatment  programs,  and  the  charges  were  dismissed.
Applicant  has  completed  substance  abuse  education  and  counseling  ordered  by  the
court as a result of his possession charges.  (Applicant’s Exhibit I.)
In  2014,  with  the  commander’s  discretion,  Applicant  was  given  an  honorable
discharge  with  a  stipulation  that  prevents  him  from  ever  re-enlisting  in  military  service
again.  (Tr. pp. 39-40.)
After leaving military service, Applicant continued to use marijuana.  He last used
marijuana in 2019 with a friend, and another time that year he used it with his brother.
Applicant  began  his  current  employment  in  October  2018.  On  July  11,  2019,
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application.
In  response  to  Section  23,
concerning Illegal Drug Activity, the question asked, “In the last seven years, have you
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substance?  Have  you  EVER  illegally  used  or
otherwise been illegally involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a
security  clearance  other  than  previously  listed?”  Applicant  answered,  “NO,”  to  both
questions.  (Government  Exhibit  1.)  Applicant’s  answer  was  false  to  both  questions.
Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his history of illegal drug use discussed above.
Applicant  states that  he  has not used any illegal drugs  since 2020.  (Tr.  p. 53.)
He  states  that  he  is  a  changed  man  who  has  greatly  matured.  He  is  taking  positive
steps  to  eliminate  the chances  that  would  place  him  in  a  situation where  he  would  be
compelled to use illegal drugs.  He no longer associates with drug users or puts himself
in those environments.
In February 2013, Applicant got married.  His wife does not use illegal drugs.  He
now  has  children  who  are  depending  on  him  to  provide,  and  be  reliable  and  sober-
minded, and to be available physically, mentally, and spiritually every day.  (Tr. p. 63.)
Applicant testified that from 2010  to 2015, although he was using illegal drugs, he
finished  college  and  obtained  his bachelor’s degree.  Throughout the  years of  his illegal
drug use, alcohol abuse  went hand and hand.  At times, he still consumes alcohol to
excess.  In 2007, he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence.  Applicant states that
he no longer drinks and drives but uses UBER or LYFT services.  (Tr. p. 65.)  He has
also attended mandatory MADD meetings and substance abuse courses.  (Tr. pp. 66.)
Applicant’s  military  performance  reports  during  the  period  from  November  19,
2002,  to  July 15, 2004;  July 16, 2004,  to  July 15,  2005; and July 16, 2005 to July 15,
2006, reflects superior performance in all areas.  From July 16, 2006 to July 15, 2007,
the performance reports show a remarkable decline  in work performance.  (Applicant’s
Exhibit F.)
Applicant’s performance evaluation for the period from January 2, 2020, to June
30, 2020, reflects an overall rating of “excellent performer.”  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Letters  of  recommendation  from  former  colleagues,  friends,  and  family  of  the
Applicant described Applicant as a dedicated employee, a trusted leader, respected by
all, highly motivated, honest and responsible.  At work, he has helped develop training
material  and  provide  mentorship  for  new  members  of  the  team.  When  the  technical
manager  was  away,  Applicant  was  called  upon  to  be  the  leader.  Applicant  is

"Applicant  is  31  years  old  and  was  married  to  his  first  wife  from  2017  until  they
divorced in 2018. He remarried in 2019 and has no children. He received  a  bachelor’s
degree in May 2014, and a master’s degree in December 2017. He has worked full time
as a hardware engineer for his employer, Company A, since May 2014. He applied for a
security clearance in February 2012, and reapplied for a security clearance in October
2020. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5)
Applicant  admitted  using  marijuana  from  September  2009  to  August  2010,  and
then  again  from  2012  to  at  least  August  2020,  while  granted  access  to  classified
information, as alleged in the SOR.  (Item I; Item 2)
In February 2012, Applicant completed his first SCA in anticipation of an internship
with  Company A,  and he  disclosed  he  used marijuana four times  between  September
2009 and August 2010. He further stated:
I don’t intend to use  marijuana in the  future because I  have grown up since
then and learned to think like an  adult. .  . .  It  doesn’t appeal to  me  because
I  have   a   great  life   and   am   almost  out  of   college.  I  am   ready   to   be   a
responsible   working   adult  that  contributes   positively   to   American   society.
Friends have  told  me  stories of how  drugs ruined people’s  lives and I  don’t
want that to  happen to  me  or be part of that crowd.
While he was still in college, Applicant interned at Company A from May 2012 until August
2012 and from May 2013 until August 2013. Company A kept him on the company payroll
starting in May 2012, and he worked one hour a week as an intern to maintain his security
clearance until he graduated from college. After he graduated in May 2014, he was hired
full time by Company A. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5)
Applicant completed a second SCA in October 2020. He disclosed no use of drugs
in  this  SCA.  It  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  he  falsified  his  SCA;  therefore,  this
information will not be considered disqualifying, but it will be considered in determining if
mitigation is applicable and under whole-person consideration. (Item 3)
During Applicant’s February 5, 2021 interview with a government investigator, he
admitted using illegal drugs during the previous seven years. He stated that he started
using marijuana in 2012, and his use typically consisted of taking a few hits off of joints
at least two to three times a year at parties. At the time of the interview, he did not intend
to stop or reduce his marijuana use, as it was so infrequent; he did not feel the need to
stop using illegal drugs; and if marijuana is present at parties, he will use it. (Item 5)
When questioned regarding using marijuana  while  holding a security clearance,
Applicant  initially  told  the  investigator  that  he  was  under  the  impression  that  because
marijuana is legal in his state of residence, he was not aware he was required to disclose
his use on his SCA. Applicant also claimed that he was unaware that he could not use
marijuana and hold a security clearance. Upon further questioning and confrontation, he
admitted he had received security briefings from his employer in which he was informed
that  he  cannot  use  illegal  drugs  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  Additionally,  he
admitted that he has never reported his marijuana use to his security manager, nor had
he stopped using marijuana, despite knowing it was inconsistent with holding a security
clearance. Finally, his company has a policy regarding the use of illegal drugs, including
marijuana, despite local laws legalizing its use. (Item 5; Item 6)
In September 2021, Applicant was asked to adopt his February 2021 interview; he
did so, but indicated that he used marijuana less than ten times between March 1, 2012
and August 2020, when he last used marijuana. As of September 2021, he intended to
“continue to abstain from marijuana in all circumstances.” He did not live with anyone who
uses marijuana, but he does know people who have medical cards and use medicinal
marijuana. It is unclear from the record if Applicant still attends parties where individuals
use marijuana. (Item 2; Item 5)
Applicant provided his 2020 year-end review from his supervisor. He is described
as  very  organized,  detail-orientated,  and  self-disciplined.  He  was  a  key  contributor  to

Applicant used  marijuana  sporadically  from  when  he  was a  teenager until about
August  2020.  His  employer  has  a   drug-free   policy.  He  used   MDMA   (3,4-
methylenedioxy-methamphetamine), a  controlled  substance, once  in 2015  and  again  in
2017. He purchased  Adderall  in Mexico,  where it is an  over-the-counter drug. He used

involvement  and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  his  national  security  eligibility.  Recreational
marijuana  use  does  not  violate  state  law  in  Applicant’s  state.  As  such,  it  is difficult for
Applicant  to  completely  disassociate  himself  from  people  who  use  marijuana,  but  he
avoids  it  to  the  extent  possible.  He  credibly  testified  that  he  does  not  intend  to  use

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted both allegations, with explanations
(contained in the attachment to his answer). I have incorporated those admissions into
my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  47  years  old.  He  was  awarded  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  is  married
and  he  has  two  children,  ages  14  and  17.  He  volunteers  in  his  community  and  has
coached  youth  soccer.  He  is  a  consultant  to  several  Government  agencies,  including
the  DOD.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  2016  (his  current  employer
acquired the company who hired him in 2016). He was granted a security clearance in
2016, after completing his security clearance application (SCA) in July 2016. (Tr. 6, 21,
29-30; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 2014 to
about 2019, and he used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about 2016 to about
2019, while holding a security clearance. (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.b.)
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  his  marijuana  use  was  very  limited.  While  he
admitted  using  recreationally  in  college,  his  2014  to  2019  uses  were  all  due  to  his
decision to use marijuana rather than prescribed opioids to manage his pain after four
oral surgery procedures during that timeframe. His first two oral surgeries were in 2010
or  2011  and  2014  timeframe,  and  he  took  the  prescribed  opioid  pain  medicine.  He
became  concerned  about  the  addictive  effect  of  these  drugs  and  talked  to  his doctors
about  alternative  pain  management,  including  using  marijuana.  His  third  oral  surgery
was in 2016, after he filled out his SCA in July 2016. He admitted using marijuana rather
than opioids for pain management after this surgery. He lives in a state where marijuana
use is legal under state law. He did not list his marijuana use on the SCA because, he
believed  his use  was legal under state  law and  the  question  asked  about “illegal”  drug
usage.  Even  though  he  did  not  have  to  do  so,  Applicant  applied  for  and  received  a
medical  marijuana  card.  He  only  used  marijuana  after  the  dental  surgeries  for  pain
management. He did not use it recreationally. (Tr. 22-24, 36, 38; GE 2; AE A)
Applicant  testified  that  sometime  in  2018  he  first  became  aware  that  using
marijuana violated federal law and was advised by a coworker that he should report his
previous uses to his employer. Later in 2018, Applicant believed he self-reported to his
employer  his  marijuana  pain-management  use  after  his  2016  surgery.  (Tr.  39,  42-43;
GE 2, AE A)
In  2019,  Applicant  had  a  fourth  oral  surgery.  He  once  again  used  marijuana
rather  the  opioids  for  pain  management  after  the  surgery.  This  was  the  last  time
Applicant used marijuana. While he has not informed his employer about this marijuana
use, during his January 2020 background investigation, he disclosed this information to
the  investigator.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  confused  as  to  what  his  obligations
were regarding the prohibition on marijuana use given the legality differences between
federal  and  state  jurisdictions.  He  admitted  that  he  did  not  seek  clarification  from  his
facilities security officer or other company officials. (Tr. 25, 27, 41-42, 44-45)
Applicant  provided  a  signed  statement  indicating  his  intent  not  to  use  illegal
drugs,  including  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  expects  to  have  at  least  one  more  oral
surgery  in  the  future,  but  he  will  not  use  marijuana  for  pain  management  after  that
procedure. He will talk with his doctors about other pain management options and if he
has to, he will take the prescribed opioids. (Tr. 46, 49; AE B)

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2007. He was married
from 2004 to 2015 and has three children, ages 16, 14, and 12. He served in the National
Guard from 2010 to 2016 and was honorably discharged. He deployed to Afghanistan for
15 months in 2012 to 2013. He has been employed by federal contractors and his present
employer  since  January  2018.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  approximately
2010. (Tr. 14-16, 22; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  testified  that  he  suffers  from  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),
depression, and anxiety. He sees mental health professionals. Applicant explained that
in 2015, he began having PTSD symptoms. He received therapy and medication through
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). After months of trying different medications, he
decided  in  November  2016  to  use  marijuana  to  help  him  because  the  prescribed
medications were not helping him. He purchased it from unknown street vendors. (Tr. 19-
25, 33-34)
When Applicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) in April 2020,
he did not disclose his marijuana use. He explained that he rushed to complete the SCA.
He was using marijuana at the time he completed it. He stated it did not register with him
to stop using marijuana, despite the question on the SCA asking about his drug use. He
said he did not stop using marijuana at that time and did not take into consideration his
job. He stopped using it when he found medication that worked.  He explained that his
mental health trumped all other considerations. (Tr. 26-27, 36)
In  June  2020,  during  Applicant’s  background  interview  with  a  government
investigator,  he  was  asked  by  the  investigator  about  his  use  of  illegal  drugs  and  he
disclosed his marijuana use. He testified that his use of marijuana was in conjunction with
going  to  the  VA  to  help  him  manage  his  PTSD.  His  use  was  not  based  on  advice  or
recommendations from any mental health professional. When asked if he understood his
use of marijuana was contrary to holding a security clearance, he said at the time he was
only  focused  on  his  mental  health.  The  thought  of  losing  his  security  clearance  never
crossed his mind when he used marijuana. (Tr. 25-28)
Applicant  believes  he  is  on  a  better  medication  now  and  does  not  need  to  use
marijuana. He testified that he stopped using marijuana in December 2020. Because his
medication is working, he does not feel the need to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 19,
27-28, 35)
Applicant  testified  that  marijuana  is  a  natural  supplement  and  is  legal  in  many
states. He stated that it does not alter his performance. If he believed its use would alter
his performance, he would not use it. He used it for his mental health. His psychiatrist and
therapist were aware he was using marijuana. They did not recommend its use and were
concerned because they could not manage it. He would use it at night to aid him in getting
to sleep. He estimated he used it less than once a week. He testified he used marijuana
for  several  years  before  he  found  medication  that  worked.  He  said  if  his  medication
stopped working, he would not resume using marijuana. He now has an appreciation that
marijuana use is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. He had been seeing his
mental health professionals about once a month, but now sees them about every three
months. Applicant provided copies of prescriptions he takes for depression and anxiety.
He also provided copies of some of his medical records. (Tr. 26-33; AE A-I)
The SOR alleges two delinquent debts (¶¶ 1.a - $13,795; 1.b – $2,050) that were
charged off. Applicant testified that a few years ago he had some collection accounts, but
they are now resolved.  He provided documentary evidence that both debts have been
resolved. (Tr. 16, GE 2; AE J, K, L)
",False
"Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since June 2019. He held a security clearance from about 1991 to
2011,  but  it  lapsed  while  he  did  non-defense  work.  This  is  his  first  application  for  a
security clearance since the lapse. He has a  bachelor’s degree  earned in 1984, and a
master’s  degree  earned  in  1987.  He  is  married  with  adult  children  and  stepchildren.
(Transcript (Tr.) at 31-33, 36; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  used marijuana  in his youth, and then did  not  use  it  again  until about
2018.  From  about  August  2018  to  July  2020,  he  used  marijuana  on  a  number  of
occasions  in a  state  where  recreational marijuana  use  is legal under state  law,  and  in
his  home  state  where  recreational  marijuana  use  is  illegal  under  state  law,  but
decriminalized, depenalized, or rarely prosecuted. He used it on several occasions with
a friend who had cancer. His friend used marijuana to help alleviate the symptoms. His
friend  has  passed  away.  He  also  used  marijuana  on  a  river-rafting  trip  and  on  a
camping and mountain biking trip. (Tr. at 33-36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  reported  his  drug  use  on  the  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions  (SF-86)  he  submitted  in  November  2020.  He  fully  discussed  his  drug  use
during  his  background  interview  in  January  2021.  He  has  not  used  marijuana  or  any
other illegal drugs since July 2020. (Tr. at 35-37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2;
AE A, B)
Applicant did not fully grasp the significance of his marijuana use because of  its
increasing  acceptance  by  states  and  the  public.  He  no  longer  associates  with  people
who use marijuana. He signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds
for  revocation  of  his  national  security  eligibility.  He  credibly  testified  that  he  does  not
intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. (Tr. at  34-37; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2; AE D, E)
Applicant called a witness, and he  submitted documents and letters attesting to
his  excellent  job  performance  and  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  judgment,
reliability, trustworthiness, dependability, ethics, and honesty. He is recommended for a
security clearance. (Tr. at 22-28; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE F)
",True
"Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since December 2020. He is applying for a security clearance for
the  first  time.  He  has  an  associate  degree  and  additional  college  credits,  but  no
bachelor’s degree. He is single without children. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant has a history of substance abuse. He started using marijuana in about
2006.  He  was  issued  citations  for  possession  of  marijuana  in  2006  and  2010.  He
stopped using marijuana after the second citation, but his alcohol use started to become
problematic in about 2011. It increased to the point that he was drinking beer daily and
liquor several times a week. He was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated
(DWI) in 2012. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 45 days in jail, with all of the jail
time suspended; probation for one year; a fine and costs; and attendance at an alcohol
class. (Items 1-3)
Applicant’s  alcohol  use  contributed  to  medical  problems,  resulting  in  inpatient
hospitalizations in July 2019 and from October 2019 to December 2019. He has not had
any  alcohol  since  he  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  in  October  2019.  He  was  told  that
drinking again could kill him. (Items 1-3)
Applicant was prescribed opioid medication for the pain. After consulting with his
pain-management  doctor,  he  decided  that  marijuana  was  a  better  alternative  than
opioids. In March 2020, he resumed using marijuana, but only for medicinal purposes.
He purchased the marijuana about once a month. (Items 1-3)
Applicant reported his alcohol issues and his marijuana use on a Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in January 2021. He stated that he
intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future  with  the  comment:  “I  use  this  for  medical
reasons.  As  suggested  by  my  Doctors.  It  provides  a  level  of  relief  that  could  only  be
achieved by heavy narcotic and opioid medication.” (Item 2)
Applicant  provided  similar  information  when  he  was  interviewed  for  his
background  investigation  in  March  2021  and  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  in
October 2021, in which he wrote:
My  use  of  medical cannabis/marijuana  has been  a  vital tool in  my  journey
of  recovery  and  has  helped  me  become  the  best me  I  have  ever been.  In
addition   to   the   fact  that  it  helped   me   stop   taking   heavy   doses  of   opioids
almost
relief,   gastric
stress/problems   relief,   sleep   issues,   and   it   works  in  conjunction   with   my
anxiety medication  for anxiety relief. If permitted, I would like to continue to
use  medical cannabis.  (Item  3)
its  use   helps  me   with   pain
immediately,
Applicant  wrote  in  his  response  to  the  SOR:  “I  am  willing  to  work  and  find  an
alternative  medical  solution,  but  until  that  medical  solution  is  found,  I’m  going  to
continue  to  use  the  medical solution  that  works, as it is legal in  my state  to  do  so.”  He
did not respond to the FORM, so additional information is not available.

"The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  H  that  Applicant  purchased  and  used  khat
(cathinone) from about January 2013 through at least May 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and that he
purchased and used marijuana from January 2013 through at least July 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.b).
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant was found guilty of a January 2017
assault and incarcerated for a time (SOR ¶ 2.a); that he was terminated from jobs in 2017
(SOR ¶ 2.b) and February 2018 (SOR ¶ 2.d); and that he resigned from a job in July 2017
after he had been told he would be fired (SOR ¶ 2.c). Applicant admitted the allegations
when he answered the SOR. His admissions are accepted and incorporated as factual
findings.  After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  He  left  his  native  country  in
October 1999 to attend a high school in France. After he graduated from high school, he
came to the United States as a tourist in late August 2001, but left for Canada in April 2002
to seek asylum, citing his fear of being arrested and tortured for protesting against the
government in his native country. His application for asylum was denied by Canada. In
November 2005, he returned to the United States and applied for asylum here. (GEs 1, 5.)
No information was presented in evidence about Applicant’s activities in the United
States  over  the  next  four  years.  The  United  States  granted  him  asylum  in  2008  and
permanent residency status in June 2009. (GE 5.)
Applicant supported himself on savings and per diem work as an interpreter from
February 2008 to June 2015. He remained eligible for assignments until February 2017,
although he had no interpreter work  after June 2015.  (GE 2.) He attended a technical
institute for one semester in the fall of 2009. He earned an associate’s degree in June
2012 and a bachelor’s degree in January 2015. (GE 1.)
In   June   2015,  Applicant  moved   to   his  current  locale,   where  there  was  a
concentration   of   immigrants  from   his  native   area.  He  worked   as  a   customer  service
representative  for a  marketing  company  for about six  months.  He became  a  naturalized
U.S. citizen in March 2016. (GE 1.)
Shortly after he relocated, Applicant began volunteering his time, language skills,
and knowledge of immigration and social services to immigrants from his native country
through their community organization. He helped many new immigrants in their transitions
to life in the United States, and spoke positively of the values of the United States. As of
April 2017, he was spending about 25 hours a week in community service while studying to
take the examination for law school toward possibly becoming an immigration attorney. (AE
A.)
Criminal Charges
Around July 2016, Applicant began dating an asylum seeker from his native country.
On January 10, 2017, he and this now ex-girlfriend had an argument. He asserts that she
became  emotional  after  the  2016  presidential  election,  as  she  feared  her  asylum
application would be disapproved by the then-U.S. administration because of its stance on
immigration, and so she attempted to convince him to marry her, thinking it would aid her
case for U.S. refugee status. (GEs 2-3, 5; Tr. 25-26.) Over the course of the day, Applicant
consumed six to eight 12-ounce beers. He maintains that after telling her that he wanted to
end their relationship, she struck him in the chest, and he pushed her backwards. He left
the apartment to purchase more alcohol, and she called the police. (GE 2.)
Applicant’s ex-girlfriend was no longer at the apartment when the police arrived, as
she had gone to the police station. Applicant was outside the apartment when the police
arrived. He told the police that he had argued with his ex-girlfriend, but that it “was no big
deal,” and  explained that  he had  gone out to purchase more beer.  He consented to a
search of the apartment, and the police seized a large kitchen knife from a drying rack. (GE
3.)
At the police station, Applicant’s ex-girlfriend, a French speaker with limited facility in
English,  complained  that  “her  cousin”  (Applicant)  had  pushed  her  to  the  couch,  put  a
kitchen knife to her throat, and told her he would kill her. When she screamed, he put down
the knife but returned with a cigarette and told her he would hurt her face. She further
complained that he put his hands to her breasts at the door, but then returned to the room,
where he threatened to rape her and exposed himself before putting the knife back and
leaving the premises. She was adamant that there was no sexual relationship between her
and Applicant, and claimed that she was staying in his apartment temporarily because
there was a problem with her apartment. At the station, Applicant admitted to the police
that  he  had  argued  with  his  ex-girlfriend  and  had  thrown  some  things  around  the
apartment, but he denied that he threatened her. He told the police that he had consumed
as many as eight to ten beers earlier in the day. (GE 3.)
The police reported seeing no signs that Applicant’s ex-girlfriend was injured. (GE
3.) Yet Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, criminal threatening
with a dangerous weapon, assault, and indecent conduct on his ex-girlfriend (SOR ¶ 2.a).
He could not post bail and was jailed from January 11, 2017, until February 22, 2017, when
a reduced bail was posted. (GE 4.)
One  of  Applicant’s  neighbors  and  the  neighbor’s  mother  were  interviewed  by  a
private  investigator  in  June  2017  at  the  request  of  Applicant’s  defense  attorney.  The
neighbor  expressed  her  belief  that  Applicant  and  the  ex-girlfriend  had  a  personal
relationship as she had observed public displays of affection between them, and she had
not seen or heard any signs of acrimony between them. The neighbor’s mother believed
Applicant and the ex-girlfriend were married, and she described Applicant as a good man.
(AE A.)
In July 2017, Applicant pled guilty to the criminal threatening and assault charges,
and prosecution was deferred with conditions. Applicant was required to refrain from any
criminal conduct, any contact with his ex-girlfriend, and any possession of a dangerous
weapon; abstain from the use of alcohol and illegal drugs with random testing; and undergo
substance abuse and psychological evaluations with updates to be provided every three
months. (GE 4.)
Applicant began monthly counseling with a licensed alcohol and drug counselor in
early  March  2017  to  work  on  substance  abuse  issues,  relationship  issues,  and
communication  skills.  As  of  mid-April  2017,  he  reported  to  the  counselor  that  he  was
abstaining from drinking and was not socializing with anyone who might promote an activity
harmful to his future. (AE A.) As of January 12, 2018, Applicant was regularly attending his
counseling appointments with no report of any relapses. (AE A.) He attended counseling
sessions for about one year. (Tr. 33-34.)
On July 6, 2018, the state moved to withdraw Applicant’s guilty plea to the felony
criminal threatening charge pursuant to the plea agreement and successful completion of
the deferment period. Applicant was found guilty of assault and sentenced to a jail term of
42 days with credit for time served. He was ordered to pay fines and surcharges totaling
$430 payable at $25 a month. A late fee of $50 was assessed on August 13, 2018. He
made a cash payment of $100 on September 13, 2018, to avoid a warrant. (GE 4.)
On October 9, 2018, Applicant underwent a counterintelligence-focused security
screening (CSS) as part of his application for a linguist position with the company currently
sponsoring him for security clearance eligibility. About the January 2017 incident involving
his ex-girlfriend, Applicant stated that her asylum application was pending at the time, and
that she threw dishes at him because he would not marry her. He admitted that he pushed
her, but explained that his lawyer recommended that he take the plea deal resulting in all
but the assault charge being dropped. (GE 5.)
Applicant listed his January 2017 arrest and his sentence for misdemeanor assault
on an October 11, 2018, security clearance application (SF 86). (GE 1.) During an October
29, 2018 subject interview (SI) with an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM), Applicant stated that he began dating an asylum seeker from his
native country in July 2016, and that they briefly cohabited until she obtained her own
apartment in the same building. He explained that they argued after he told her he did not
want  to  engage  in a fraudulent marriage, and she became increasingly emotional and
punched him in the chest with a closed fist. After he informed her that he wanted to end
their relationship, she became “extremely outraged,” and struck him again. He retaliated by
pushing her backwards, although he claimed it was not enough for her to fall or cause her
injury. Applicant vehemently denied her accusations of attempted rape or of putting a knife
to  her  neck.  He  pled  guilty  to  misdemeanor  assault  under  a  plea  agreement,  but  he
maintained that his ex-girlfriend had fabricated the entire event, thinking that she would
receive more favorable consideration for U.S. “citizenship.” Applicant denied that he was
required to participate in any program for alcohol use or anger management as a condition
of his release. (GE 2.) He currently asserts he pled guilty only to put the incident behind
him. The criminal proceedings occurred before he applied for a clearance, and he did not
realize that a conviction could negatively impact his future. (Tr. 26, 31.) He has not had any
contact with his ex-girlfriend since the incident. (Tr. 31.)
Adverse Employment Issues
Between  2016  and  2018, Applicant had  three  jobs that ended  under unfavorable
circumstances. He was terminated  from  his job  as a  production  worker  at  a  bakery  in  “2016
or 2017”  (SOR ¶  2.b). Applicant did not list this job  on  his SF 86. (GE 1.) When  asked
about this developed  information  during  his SI,  Applicant recalled  that he  had  worked  for a
bakery  as a  production  worker in “2016  or 2017  for six  months,” when  he  was fired  on-the-
spot after his supervisor heard him  say  that he  was going  to  quit because  it was  too  hot on
the   job.  (GE  2.) At  his security   clearance  hearing, he  initially  asserted  that he   quit the
bakery  job  because  he  thought he  could spend  his time  on  more important work, such  as
preparing  and  taking  the  admission  examination  for law  school,  and  that the  company
“tricked” him  about the  nature of  the  job. He subsequently  admitted  that he  was fired  after
missing work twice. (Tr. 41-42.)
In  February  2017,  Applicant  began  working  full  time  as  a  behavioral-health
professional for children. He provided support for a student with special needs, helping him
with behavior and focus issues. (Tr. 43.) During the summer of 2017, Applicant did not take
online classes required to meet state-certification requirements, as he believed he should
not have to take them on his own time without compensation. He resigned in July 2017 in
lieu of being terminated (SOR ¶ 2.c). (GEs 1-3.) On his SF 86, he indicated that he quit the
job after being told he would be fired, and explained he lost the job over money issues,
stating: “My employer and I came to an agreement because I was not able to make enough
money during the summer of 2017 so I quit” (SOR ¶ 2.c). During his subsequent SI (GE 2)
and   at  his  hearing   (Tr.  44),  Applicant  acknowledged   that  he   did  not  take   the   classes
required  to  keep  his job  in the  summer of  2017, but maintained  that he  left  the  job  amicably
because  the  job  was not a  good  fit.  He asserts that,  to  end  his employment,  the  company
was required  by  policy  to  issue  him  a  letter stating  that he  was fired  or terminated. (Tr. 44-
45.)
Applicant next worked as a full-time linguist at a hospital from November 2017 until
February 2018. He indicated on his SF 86 that he had been fired from the job “for missing
3 or 4 days due to [a] personal matter” (SOR ¶ 2.d). During his SI, Applicant was asked
about the nature of the “personal matter.” He declined to provide any further information,
even  after  he  was  advised  that  the  failure  to  provide  the  requested  information  could
preclude a determination of his clearance eligibility.  (GE 2.) At his hearing, he explained
that he had car issues and was fired by the hospital for being late twice and absent once
during his probationary period. (Tr. 47-48.) When asked why he would not tell the OPM
investigator about the “personal matter” that led to his job termination, Applicant claimed
that he was not asked about it during his SI. (Tr. 48.)
Drug Involvement
In June 2018, Applicant applied to work as a linguist with a federal contractor. He
was unemployed at the time. (GE 1.) During his October 9, 2018 CSS, Applicant related
that he smoked marijuana once or twice a week from 2009 to July 2018 when he stopped
using marijuana because he would be drug tested as a linguist with the defense contractor.
(GE 5.) When he completed his SF 86 on October 1, 2018, he indicated that he used and
purchased marijuana for recreational purchases from  January 2013 to May 2018 at a
frequency of once a month (SOR ¶ 1.b). He denied any intention to use or purchase the
drug in the future, and stated, “I am grown up and this job that I am applying for is serious
about drug usage.” (GE 1.) During his October 29, 2018 SI, Applicant related that he used
marijuana in his home every weekend between January 2013 and May 2018, and that he
purchased marijuana from friends at a cost of $40 a  week. He explained that he used
marijuana initially out of curiosity and continued using marijuana because it relaxed him.
Applicant would not provide the names of the persons from whom he bought marijuana
because he did not want to get them in trouble. He admitted knowing that it was a violation
under federal law to possess marijuana, but given that it was legal in his state, coupled with
the  fact that “everyone  does it,” he  did not feel it was a  big deal. Applicant denied  any
intention to resume using marijuana.
Applicant was then asked during his SI whether he had experimented with or used
any other illegal substance. He responded “No” initially, but after being provided examples
of drugs, Applicant volunteered that he consumed two or three leaves of khat (a shrub with
two active ingredients, cathine and cathinone, used for its stimulant effect, see GE 6), on
the weekends once or twice a month from January 2013 to May 2018. He related that he
purchased the stimulant on the black market in his area. He was aware that it was against
state and federal laws to use khat, but explained that it was “heritage related;” that the use
of  khat  was  common  and  “not  taboo”  (was  culturally  accepted)  in  his  native  land.  He
asserted that he stopped using khat because he was planning to work as a linguist in a
position  that required  clearance  eligibility,  and  he  knew  that its use  would not be  allowed.
He attributed his omission of his khat use from his SF 86 to “oversight.” (GE 2.)
In October 2019, Applicant was asked to respond to drug interrogatories. He listed
marijuana and khat use “Few Times (once a week)” from January 2013 to May 2018. He
denied any current association with known drug users or any frequenting of places where
he had reason to believe drugs were being used. He commented about his drug use, as
follows:
For  the  khat  and  marijuana,  I  used  them  just  for pleasure  and  I  was  not
aware that the security clearance process would ask me about the use of
those  drugs.  I  never  had  any  addictions  or  issues  with  them.  It  never
impaired me physically or psychologically. I also want to express that khat is
not  considered  illegal  in  the  East  African  countries  where  I  grew  up.
Marijuana is also not considered illegal in the state of [name omitted], where
I  live  at  this  moment.  Those  are  the  reasons  why  I  did  purchase  those
substances. But I put everything behind me since the [security clearance]
process started for me. (GE 2.)
At his hearing, Applicant was not asked about the discrepancy between his CSS,
where he reported first using marijuana in 2009, and his SF 86, SI, and hearing, where he
maintained that he started using marijuana in January 2013. He testified at his hearing that
he began using marijuana in college (Tr. 55-56), and that he used marijuana recreationally
once a week on the weekends. (Tr. 56.) When asked about the discrepancy in dates for his
reported last use of marijuana (July 2018 during the CSS, and May 2018 on his SF 86 and
during his SI), Applicant responded, “I can’t really be specific. But it was within that range
of time. Like those two days [sic].” (Tr. 57.)
Applicant explained that marijuana “was kind of legal,” and it was easy to obtain in
his state. (Tr. 62.) As to why he used marijuana when it could possibly hinder his chance of
a legal career or his ability to aid other immigrants in his community, Applicant responded
that “it was something that [he] was not consuming every day;” it was not hurting him; he
did it only on the weekends; he did not think about any possible negative impacts his use
could have on his future; it was just keeping him relaxed; and “[he] was just doing it for the
sake  of  doing it.  Or [his]  friends  [were]  doing it.” (Tr. 63.)  Applicant  denies  any use  of
marijuana since 2018 (Tr. 58), and asserts that he cut ties in 2018 with those friends who
used  marijuana.  (Tr.  64.)  When  asked  about  his  marijuana  use  in  2018,  which  would
appear to have been in violation of the condition of his deferred disposition that he abstain
from  illegal  drug  use,  Applicant  initially  asserted  that  he  was  not  told  that  he  was  not
supposed to use illegal drugs. (Tr. 67.) He then claimed that he stopped using illegal drugs
when the court ordered him to refrain from illegal drug use and that he “maybe made a
mistake with the dates [of his drug use].” (Tr. 68.)
Applicant denies any use of khat since 2018. (Tr. 58.) In December 2019, he went to
his native country for his marriage to a resident citizen of that country. He maintains that he
did not use any khat at his wedding, despite the drug being commonly used at weddings.
He returned to his native country in January 2020 and stayed there until March 2021. (Tr.
58.) Some of his family members used khat in his presence. (Tr. 59-60.) Applicant asserts
that he did his best to make them understand that his situation has changed in that he was
trying to obtain a job that did not allow for the use of khat. (Tr. 60.)

"After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant  used marijuana with varying
frequency from about June 2016 to about March 2019, and that he purchased marijuana
from early 2017 to about March 2019. In Applicant’s September 2021 answer to the SOR,
he admitted both SOR allegations. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant is 22 years old. He graduated from high school in June 2018 and started
college in September 2018. He lived in campus housing from September 2018 to at least
June 2019, and reported that he was seeking a degree. He has not been married and has
no children. He started an internship for a federal contractor in May 2019. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  May  2019.  He
disclosed  that  he  used  marijuana  from  June  2016  to  March  2019.  He  stated  that  he
smoked marijuana once or twice a week to relieve stress, and that he did not know how
many times he had used marijuana. He reported that he enjoyed using marijuana, but did
not intend to use it in the future to avoid risking employment opportunities. He noted that
if  the  recreational  use  of  marijuana  were  legalized,  that  he  intended  to  use  marijuana
again. He denied being involved in the illegal purchase of marijuana. (Item 3)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2019. He verified
the  accuracy  of  his  SCA  responses,  and  clarified  that  if  marijuana  use  were  legalized
under  Federal  law  he  would  resume  using  it  because  that  would  not  jeopardize  his
employment  opportunities.  He  stated  that  he  smoked  marijuana  approximately  once
every three months from June 2016 until September 2018. He said that after he started
college in September 2018, he smoked approximately one gram of marijuana that was
shared with one-two friends on each occasion, one-two times per week. He smoked the
marijuana at a friend’s home, off campus residences, parks, or in the woods or forests.
He identified nine people that he had smoked marijuana with including long-term friends
identified as references in his SCA, and one roommate. He said that he smoked marijuana
for experimentation, social purposes, and as a means to relax. He believed that marijuana
was a better option for relaxation than alcohol. He said that he continued to socialize with
individuals who use drugs illegally. He noted that his parents, brother, former girlfriends
and the nine individuals he identified were aware of his marijuana use, and believed that
since his marijuana use was known that it could not be used for blackmail or coercion. He
stated that the marijuana was obtained by friends and shared among the group, and that
he had purchased marijuana for use by the group. He noted that he had failed to disclose
that he had purchased marijuana on his SCA and attributed that failure to an unintentional
oversight.   He  reported   that  he   first   purchased   marijuana   in   early   2017   and   had   most
recently  purchased  marijuana  in  March 2019.  He said  that he  purchased  approximately
3.5  grams of  marijuana  twice a month,  for an  unspecified  period  of time,  from  a  friend. He
said that  he  understands rules  and  regulations are in  place  for a  reason, and  follows them
to  the  best of  his ability. He has  not sought counseling  or treatment for his marijuana  use.

"In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  the  allegation  in  the  SOR.  He  also  provided

thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact. (Item 2)
Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  married  in  September 2020.  He  has  worked  as  a
software  engineer  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal  contractor,  since  2015,  and  that
contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. He
holds  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  has  held  a  top  secret  security  clearance  since  2012.
(Item 3)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used marijuana, with  varying frequency,  from  about
May 2017 to about May 2019, while having access to classified information. (Item 1)
In his June 2018 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant admitted using
marijuana on three occasions between May 2017 and June 2018. Later in the SCA, he
denied using marijuana while holding a security clearance  (even though he completed
his 2018  SCA  stating that he  held  a  security clearance  since  2012).  He  also  stated  in
his SCA that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because he has nothing to
gain by using it and he did not get much pleasure  out of using it. In June 2019, during
his background interview, Applicant described the three times he used marijuana before
completing  his 2018  SCA.  He  then  admitted  using marijuana  three  to four more  times
after completing his 2018 SCA. He told the investigator he was not sure if he possessed
a  security  clearance  during  his  most  recent  uses  of  marijuana.  He  described  that  his
most recent use was in May 2019, when he was traveling through a state where using
marijuana was legal under state law. He also told the investigator that he did not intend
to use marijuana in the future. (Items 3-4)
In  his  SOR  answer,  he  admitted  using  marijuana  while  possessing  a  security
clearance,  but  he  claimed  that  at  the  time  of  the  uses  he  did  not  have  access  to
classified  information or facilities.  He  went on  to state that he has discontinued use  of
marijuana  and  he  is  committed  to  a  life  of  abstinence  from  illegal  substances.  He
reiterated his commitment not to use marijuana in the future. Since Applicant submitted
this case for an administrative determination, I was unable to judge his credibility based
on demeanor. (Item 2)

"Applicant is 30 years old and unmarried. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2018.
Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  financial  analyst  since
December 2020. He is a first-time applicant seeking to obtain national security eligibility
in connection with his employment. (Tr. at 21-22, 51.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Involvement)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  a  history  of  drug  involvement.  Specifically,  the  SOR  alleged  that
Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2010 through
December 2020 (SOR 1.a). The SOR also alleged that Applicant purchased and used
marijuana after completing his e-QIP and submitting it on December 2, 2020 (SOR 1.b).
The  Government  alleged  further  in  the  SOR  that  Applicant  intends  to  continue  using
marijuana in the future (SOR 1.c).
In his Answer, Applicant denied part of SOR 1.a and all of SOR 1.c. He wrote that
he had not purchased marijuana prior to relocating to State 1 in 2017, where it was legal
to do so under state law. He also wrote that he had only used marijuana a few times prior
to 2017. He admitted the allegations in SOR 1.b and wrote that he was unaware of the
significance of the difference between Federal and state law with respect to the use of
marijuana  in  the  context  of  Federal employment  until  he  “went  through  the  process  of
applying for my clearance.” (Answer at 1.)
Applicant first smoked marijuana in 2010 with his college basketball teammates in
State  2.  This  use  occurred  on  a  few  occasions.  He  subsequently  transferred  colleges
twice  to  continue  his  college  basketball  experience  at  larger  universities.  He  did  not
smoke marijuana during those college years because he was no longer associating with
the  same  teammates.  In  about  2013  or  2014  while  a  college  student,  Applicant’s
grandmother died. He was close to his grandmother, and he suffered a serious emotional
loss. A therapist suggested that he try CBD to help him handle the stress and anxiety he
was  experiencing.  In  about  2017,  Applicant  was  treated  by  a  doctor for  a  serious  and
painful  medical  condition.  The  doctor  gave  him  a  prescription  for  medical  marijuana,
which was legal at that time in State 1 where Applicant resided. A physical therapist who
treated Applicant also recommended that he use medical marijuana for his condition. (Tr.
at 29, 35-40.)
Applicant  used  marijuana  medically  and  on  occasion  he  used  it  with  friends  for
recreational  purposes,  which  was  also  legal  in  State  1  at  that  time.  He  purchased
marijuana at a legal medical marijuana dispensary. He smoked the marijuana or ate it in
edible form. (Tr. at 40-43.)
Applicant’s  December  2,  2020  e-QIP  was  followed  later  that  month  with  his
background interview. He initially advised the interviewer that he would like to continue
using marijuana for medical purposes if that was allowed. In a follow-up phone call, he
explicitly told the interviewer that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future for any
purpose.  He  was  concerned  that  the  interviewer  may  have  misunderstood  his  earlier
comments on the subject of his intent to use marijuana in the future. He testified at the
hearing that he has no intention of using marijuana in the future, and he provided a written
statement memorializing his intention. He earnestly testified that he will keep that promise
and  has  agreed  in  his  written  statement  to  the  revocation  of  any  security  clearance
granted  to  him  should  he  violate  his  commitment  in  the  future.  He  stopped  using
marijuana  in  or  about  December  2020  and  now addresses  his  medical  needs  through
daily meditation. He credibly testified that he does not recall whether he used marijuana
during the three-week period after he submitted his e-QIP and the time of his background
interview or whether he advised the interviewer that he had done so. (Tr. at 58-60, 65;
AE G.)
In April 2022, however, he used a vape pen containing marijuana. The pen was
offered to him by a friend after an evening of drinking alcohol at a bar. Initially, Applicant
believed  the  pen  was  a  simple  e-cigarette,  but  after  using  it,  he  thought  it  contained
marijuana. He asked his friend and the friend confirmed that it did. He then took one more
“hit” from the pen. He gave the pen back to his friend and knew that he had just made a
mistake and was upset with himself. He let his friends know that he will not ever again
consume anything with marijuana so that a similar incident does not happen by mistake
in the future. He now avoids smoking in general, whether it is an e-cigarette or a vape
pen. He testified that “[I] knew that I had messed up [taking a second puff of marijuana
from the vape pen].” (Tr. at 60-63.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has engaged in conduct that involves questionable judgment, lack of candor,
and dishonesty. The SOR alleges that he falsified information in his e-QIP by denying any
illegal purchase or use of drugs or controlled substances in the past seven years (SOR
2.a). Applicant denied this allegation in his Answer and asserted that he misunderstood
the  e-QIP  question.  He  explained  that  at  the  time  he  prepared  his  application,  he
understood that purchasing and using marijuana in State 1 was legal. (Answer at 1.)
Applicant’s December 2, 2020 e-QIP was followed by his background interview on
December 29, 2020. Applicant  viewed  the  interview  as  an  extension  of  his application
giving him the opportunity to provide more detailed information than that which  he had
provided  in  his  e-QIP.  Applicant  and  the  interviewer  discussed  his  answers  to  each
question in the e-QIP. The interviewer explained to Applicant how the law of State 1 and
Federal law differed on the legality of marijuana purchases and use. When he learned the
difference,  he  told  the  interviewer  that  he  would  like  to  change  his  answers  to  the
questions in Section 23 regarding the possession and use of illegal drugs. He advised the
interviewer that the correct answer to the e-QIP question was “Yes.” He explained at the
hearing that he answered the e-QIP question regarding illegal drug use in the negative
because the purchase and use of marijuana was legal in his state. He had no intention to
provide false information on his e-QIP. (Tr. at 43-49, 54-57, 63.)
Applicant  noted  at  the  hearing  that  his  college  drug  use  in  2010  and  2011  was
outside  the  seven-year  time  frame  of  the  question  in  the  e-QIP.  Accordingly,  his  only
reportable  drug  use  was  after  he  relocated  to  State  1,  where  medical  marijuana
purchases and use were legal with a medical marijuana card. He explained that he had
assumed incorrectly that the appropriate answer to the e-QIP questions was “No,” since
the question references illegal use of drugs and he did not believe his use of marijuana
in  State  1  in  the  past  seven  years  was  illegal.  He  testified  that  the  interviewer  never
confronted  him  with  information  about  Applicant’s  past  use  of  marijuana  prior  to  his
disclosure about his purchases and use of marijuana in State 1 starting in 2017. (Tr. at
43-49, 54-57, 63; GE 2 at 8.)
Mitigation
Applicant provided six character letters. Two are from work supervisors, two are
from retired military personnel who have long-term relationships with Applicant, and two
are from Applicant’s parents. All of the letters describe Applicant as a person with a high
moral  character  and  who  is  highly  trustworthy.  They  strongly  endorse  Applicant’s
qualifications to hold a security clearance. (Tr. at 65-66; AE A-F.)
Applicant also submitted a letter stating his intent to refrain from using illegal drugs
in the future. His letter, dated May 15, 2022, post-dates his one puff experience with a
vape pen in April 2022. He included in his letter the statement required by AG ¶ 26(b)(3),
which requires an acknowledgement by the Applicant that any breach of his commitment
to abstain from illegal drug use in the future would be automatic grounds for the revocation
of any security clearance granted to him. Applicant sincerely testified at the hearing that
he made this promise in writing because “I meant it.” (Tr. at 65; AE G.)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  both  of  the  Guideline  H
allegations,  with  explanations.  I  adopt  his  admissions  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 33  years old.  He is single, has never married, and has no children.
He  works  as  a  project  manager  for  a  defense  contractor  where  he  began  working  in
2016. That contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701
et seq. Applicant holds a master’s degree and he is pursuing a second master’s degree.
He has held a security clearance since 2016. (Tr. 16-17, 27-28; GE 1, 4)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  in  about  September  2018,  while
holding  a  security  clearance.  The  SOR  also  alleged  that  he  used  marijuana  in  about
November  2013  before  he  was  granted  a  security  clearance.  The  allegations  are
established  by  Applicant’s  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  admissions,  his
admissions  to  a  defense  investigator  during  his  background  investigation,  and  his
admission in his SOR answer. (GE 1-3; SOR answer)
Applicant described his 2013 marijuana use as occurring while he was in college.
He  was  25  years  old  at  the  time.  He  attended  a  football  tailgate  party  and  a  pipe
containing marijuana was being circulated at the party. Applicant smoked from the pipe
on two occasions. He claims this was his first time he ever used marijuana and did so
out of curiosity. He felt euphoric after using it. He did not hold a security clearance at the
time. (Tr. 23; GE 2, 3)
In  July  2016,  in  connection  with  his  employment  with  a  defense  contractor,
Applicant completed an SCA. When asked about previous drug use in Section 23 of the
SCA,  he  admitted  his  2013  marijuana  use  and  stated  the  following:  “I  tried  the
substance  once  in  life  and  do  not  plan  on  using  the  substance  again  due  to  illegal
nature  of  the  substance  and  lack  of  enjoyment.”  Thereafter,  Applicant  was  granted  a
security clearance, in 2016. (GE 2)
In September 2018, Applicant was on vacation with a group of friends in another
state.  He  believed  that  his  friends  were  able  to  use  marijuana  legally  because  either
they  held  medical  marijuana  cards  or  use  was  legal  under  state  law  where  they  were
located.  One  of  the  friends  passed  around  a  vape  pen,  which  contained  marijuana.
During  Applicant’s background  investigation, he  admitted  to inhaling two to three puffs
from the vape pen. During his hearing testimony, he claimed he only took one puff from
the vape pen containing marijuana. He knew immediately that doing so was a lapse in
good  judgment.  At  the  time  of  his  use,  he  knew  marijuana  use  was  illegal  and  also
against his employer’s rules and drug policies. He held a security clearance at the time
of this use. He did not report his use to his employer at the time.  Applicant remains in
contact  with  this group  of friends and he believes  they still use marijuana.  (Tr. 18,  27;
GE 3, 4)
Sometime   before   June   2020,  Applicant   was  made   aware  that  he   was  being
considered   for access   to   top   secret   classified   material.  In   order   for  that  to   happen,   he
needed  to  complete  a  new  SCA,  which he  did in June  2020. On  that SCA,  he  disclosed
his September 2018  marijuana  use.  It  was at about this same  time, two  years after the
fact,  that Applicant  first  informed  his employer about his marijuana  use  in 2018. (Tr. 24-
25; GE 1)
Applicant  explained  that  growing  up  he  lived  with  his  mother  who  had  a
substance-abuse  addiction.  That  experience  has  made  him  sensitive  to  addictive
qualities and why he is committed not to use illegal substances in the future. He plans to
inform his friends that he will not use illegal substances in the future. (Tr. 19-20; AE A)

Science  in construction  management,  and  he  has worked  as a  construction  engineer for
his current employer, a  defense  contractor, since  2008. He  was granted  a  top  secret  (TS)

clearance  with  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  (SCI) access.  (GE 1-2;  Tr.  11,  17-

Applicant  admitted  using  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  on  two  occasions  in  about
October  2018  and  November  2020,  after  having  been  granted  access  to  classified
information, as alleged in the SOR. Applicant does not consider himself to be a drug user,
rather he made a bad decision while he was grieving the death of his friend’s father. He
then repeated this mistake with the same friend “under the belief that the damage … was
already done … .” (Answer; GE 1-2; Tr. 13, 21, 23)
In  October 2018, Applicant’s  college friend’s  father passed  away.  The man  had
been a mentor to him. Applicant agreed leave his home that night and drive to another
state, where his friend’s family owns a ranch, to help them. Two nights after he arrived,
Applicant’s  friend  offered  him  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  after  dinner.  His  friend  was
aware that Applicant had a security clearance. At the hearing, Applicant was unable to
explain why he chose to ingest the mushrooms other than to relieve the grief that he was
experiencing. They produced an overall helpful or pleasurable effect on him. He returned
to his home a day or two later. (Answer; Tr. 20-22, 27-28)
When Applicant  returned  to  work, he did  not disclose  his illegal drug use  to his
supervisor, facility security officer (FSO), or anyone else. He did not disclose his drug use
to his wife. He continued to communicate with his friend during the subsequent two years
almost exclusively via text messages. (Tr. 22)
In  November  2020,  Applicant’s  friend  traveled  to  visit  him,  and  they  went  to
Applicant’s mother’s cabin to hunt elk together. While at the cabin, according to Applicant:
The  night that I consumed  the  psilocybe  again,  he  made  it obvious that he
had   some   and   applied,  I  guess,   a   little   bit  of  peer  pressure   that  he,  you
know, he didn’t want to do it alone and  all of that kind of silly stuff.
Initially, Applicant resisted consuming the mushrooms, but he eventually did and had a
negative experience. After returning home, he told his wife and mother what he had done,
but he did not notify his FSO when he returned to work. (Tr. 13, 22-24)
In December 2020, Applicant disclosed his drug use in his SCA during the course
of  his periodic  reinvestigation. He also  disclosed  it  when  he  was interviewed  in February
2021  by  a  Government  investigator. Applicant’s employer has never drug  tested  him, but
his employer could test  him  at any  time.  He understands  that his company’s  policy  is  that
employees are not to  use  drugs. Applicant testified  that  in February  2021, he  told a  co-
worker and  his director  about his use  of  hallucinogenic mushrooms.  (GE  1- 2; Tr. 24-26,
32-33)
While  they  were  in  college,  Applicant  used  marijuana  a  few  times  with  his
previously mentioned friend. He used marijuana a total of approximately ten times, and
he did not use it after he graduated from college in 2007. At the hearing, he admitted to
using cocaine two times the summer after he graduated from high school. He also used
hallucinogenic  mushrooms  two  to  three  times  late  in  college.  This  behavior  was  not
alleged and will not be considered as disqualifying conduct. He testified that he disclosed
all of this illegal conduct in the first SCA he completed in 2010. (Tr. 28-32)
Since Applicant’s last use of illegal drugs in November 2020, he has avoided all
contact with his friend and ignored his calls, text messages, and emails. He has not given
his friend a reason for his lack of contact or for his behavior. Applicant’s wife does not use
drugs, and they do not keep drugs in their home. (Tr. 25, 28-29, 33-34)
Applicant provided documentation that on March 30, 2022, he received an email
with the contact information to make an appointment with a provider within his employee

The SOR alleges under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
that  Applicant  used  marijuana  on  various  occasions  between  at  least  June  2009  and
January 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a); and that in August 2016, he was charged with DWI –  drug
intoxication, resisting arrest by flight, and felony property damage. He was convicted of
DWI and placed on probation for two years. (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Under  Guideline  E  (Personal  Conduct),  the  SOR  cross-alleged  in  ¶  2.a,  the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. Also, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his May
2019 SCA by failing to disclose his  criminal charges and DWI conviction as alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.b, and past drug use as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c) Finally, the
SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts in the answers provided in his August
2019 personal subject interview (PSI), wherein he failed to disclose his felony charge and
alcohol-related offense as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. (SOR ¶ 2.d)
In his 2019 SCA, Applicant noted that he had no history of illegal drug use, alcohol-
related charges, arrests, convictions, or other criminal/police activity. When he was first
interviewed by an investigator in August 2019, he twice denied ever being charged with
a  felony  or  any  offense  involving  alcohol.  When  the  investigator  confronted  him  with
information about his charges and conviction in August 2016, he asserted that it was not
supposed to be part of his record so he did not think it needed to be listed on his SCA.
He described the incident, changed parts of his story, and then stated that he purposely
omitted the arrest, assuming it would not be on his record or raised in the investigation
and that he wanted to keep his business private. He stated that he was happy to have his
job and did not want or think he needed a security clearance.
In his response to Government interrogatories and in his PSI, Applicant admitted
to daily marijuana use from June 2009 to January 2019. He stated in his PSI that he was
an  “habitual daily  user”  but  never believed  it to  be  problematic because  it  never affected
his personal or professional life. He used  marijuana  alone  or whenever given  the  chance.
He purposely  omitted  the  information  from  his  SCA as he  did not  think it would ever come
up  or be  included  in the  police  report. He claimed  to  have  no  immediate  intention  to  use
marijuana  again,  but  left open  the  possibility  of  using  it after he  retired  if  it was legal. He
also admitted  his August 2016  arrest for driving  under the  influence  of  alcohol. He stated
in his response to interrogatories that he  pleaded guilty and “a deal was made  if I go two
years  under  probation   with   no   re-occurring   incidents,   then   the   DUI  would   be   removed
from [his] record, case  is currently closed with everything complete.” His Federal Bureau
of  Investigation  (FBI) criminal history  shows Applicant was charged  in August 2016  for
DWI-drug  intoxication, resisting  arrest,  property  damage, and  felony  property  damage  1st
degree.

"In his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Paragraph
1 of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to support his
request for eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant  is  27  years  old,  recently  married,  and  has  no  children.  He  has  a
Master’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering. He works for a defense contractor. (TR at
page 5 lines 13~20., and at page 14 line 21 to page 17 line 7.)
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse
1.a.  Applicant  used  marijuana  “at  most  six  times  per  year  over  .  .  .  [a]  10-year
period,” from about April of 2010 until his last usage in November of 2020. (TR at page
19 line 24 to page 23 line 13.) Applicant used marijuana once; after obtaining his current
employment, but before executing his e-QIP. (TR at page 26 line 18 to page 27 line 10.)
He  also  purchased  marijuana,  once,  “from  a  State-licensed  distributor,”  during  the
2018~2019-time frame. (TR at page 28 lines 1~18.)
1.b.  and   1.c.   Applicant  used   cocaine   at   a   concert  in  August  of  2016,  and   used
Methyenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA) at a  concert in 2017. (TR at  page  17  line  13
to page 19 line 18.)
On  December  15,  2021,  Applicant  attested:  “I  will  abstain  from  all  future  drug
involvement  and  substance  misuse,  and  acknowledge  that  any  future  involvement
would  be  immediately  disclosed  and  that  it  would  be  grounds  for  revocation  of  my
national security eligibility.” (AppX A at page 2.)

"Applicant is 27 years old and has never married. He has no children. He earned
his bachelor’s degree in June 2017. Applicant was unemployed after graduation until he
was hired in March 2018 by a Defense Department contractor to work as an engineer. He
is a first-time applicant for a security clearance. He seeks national security eligibility and
a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 3 at Sections 12, 13A, 17,
18, 25.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The  Government  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a  security
clearance because of his illegal use of a controlled substance, marijuana. The three SOR
allegations are supported by Applicant’s admissions in his Answer and in his Reply. The
allegations  are  also  evidenced  by  Applicant’s  statements  in  his  e-QIP,  his  answers  to
interrogatories, and his comments made during an interview with an investigator from the
Office of Personnel Management held on January 5, 2021. (Items 3, 4, and 5.)
The details regarding  the  three  SOR allegations and  Applicant’s admissions  are
as follows:
1.a.  After graduating from high school and while in college, Applicant experimented
with  using  marijuana  approximately  ten  times.  He  did  not  use  any  marijuana  after
graduating from college in 2017 until about November 2019. Since that time, Applicant
has used marijuana on a daily basis in the late evenings to help reduce low back pain he
has  experienced  since  he  had  a  skiing  accident.  As  noted,  he  began  working  for  his
current employer in March 2018. His employer has a policy titled “Drug and Alcohol Free
Workplace   and   Testing.”  Under  this  policy,  the   company   prohibits  employees   from
reporting  for work “with  illegal drugs in their  systems.” The  policy  provides no  exception
for using  marijuana  for  medical purposes. About one  month  before  Applicant signed  his
e-QIP, he  obtained  a  medical marijuana  card  from  a  physician  in his state  of  residence
and work. (Item 3 at 28; Item  4 at 2;  Item 5 at 4 and 8;  Item  6 at 2.)
1.b. Applicant continued to use marijuana after he signed his e-QIP on October 30,
2020, and that use has continued up until at least the date of the Reply. (Item 4 at 2; Item
5 at 3-4, 8.)
1.c. In his e-QIP Applicant responded affirmatively to a question about his intention
to use marijuana in the future. He noted further: “I would strongly prefer this method of
pain  relief  [using  marijuana]  over  Narcotics.”  He  concluded  stating:  “if  this  [his  use  of
medical  marijuana  with  a  state  medical  marijuana  card]  is  problematic,  please  let  me
know”. He was reported as stating during his background interview that he would like to
continue to use marijuana for his back pain, but he would cease using it immediately if
his  use  of  marijuana  was  an  issue  with  his  employer  or  his  security  clearance.  In  his
response to interrogatories, he wrote that he intends to continue his daily use of marijuana
“if acceptable” and was “willing to cease as necessary.” In his Reply, Applicant wrote: I
would like to reiterate that I have repeatedly stated I would be willing to cease medical
cannabis use at the department’s request, to secure a security clearance. This is not my
preference because that may make prescription opiates necessary in the evening.” (Item
3 at 28; Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 4; Reply.)

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a and denied ¶ 1.b in his Answer. He is 41 years old,
single, and does not have any children. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 11-12, 23, 52; GE 1)
Applicant graduated from high school in 1999 and earned an associate degree in
2006. He worked for a previous DOD contractor from approximately 2007 to 2014. As of
the date of the hearing, he worked as a principal designer for his employer, another DOD
contractor, since approximately November 2017. He has never held a security clearance.
(Tr. at 5, 7-9, 23, 29-30, 33; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  approximately  once  or  twice  a
month from about May 1999 to September 2020 (the date of the SOR), and he intended
to  continue  to  use  marijuana  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b).  Applicant  first  experimented  with
marijuana  in  the  summer  of  1999,  before  his  senior  year  of  high  school.  He  used  it  a
handful  of  times,  knowing  that  it  was  illegal.  He  listed  in  his  November  2019  security
clearance application (SCA) that he used marijuana from May 1999 to September 2019.
He indicated, during his January 2020 background interview, that he used marijuana one
to  two  times  monthly,  from  1999  to  December  2019,  and  he  acknowledged  that  his
December 2019 marijuana use occurred after he submitted his SCA. (SOR; Answer; GE
1, 2; Tr. at 15, 20, 23-24, 32-45, 53-68)
Applicant testified that after first experimenting with marijuana in 1999, he did not
use marijuana again until he was in college, between 2004 and 2006, using it “once in a
while  on  the  weekend.”  He  testified  that  he  did  not  use  marijuana  from  2006  to  2015,
when  he  worked  for  a  DOD  contractor,  because  he  did  not  want  to  jeopardize  his
employment. He testified that after he used marijuana in college, he did not use marijuana
again until 2016, when he used it to self-medicate after his father had a stroke. He used
marijuana once to twice monthly for anxiety relief, as a sleep aid, and to relax. He obtained
marijuana for his personal use from a friend and  he  used  it  alone or with  a  friend.  He
stated in his June 2020 interrogatory responses that he no longer personally possessed
marijuana and he used it recreationally, on occasion, with friends who purchased it. (SOR;
Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A; Tr. at 15, 21, 24-25, 27-45, 53-70)
Applicant testified that he had not used marijuana since November 2017, when he
began working for his employer, because he did not want to jeopardize his employment.
He testified that he erred, in his SCA and during his January 2020 background interview,
when he listed and indicated that he last used marijuana in 2019. He also testified that he
did  not  thoroughly  read  the  January  2020  background  interview  summary  when  he
adopted its accuracy in his June 2020 interrogatory responses. He also testified that he
erred when he admitted SOR ¶ 1.a in his Answer. He testified, “I just didn’t understand
what I was doing . . .,” as this was the first time he had undergone the security clearance
process. He maintained he was just trying to be honest and stated that he should have
sought advice from his Facility Security Officer (FSO). (SOR; Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A; Tr.
at 15, 21, 24-25, 27-45, 53-70)
In  October 2013, Applicant was charged  with  misdemeanor marijuana  possession.
A  police  officer pulled  him  over for a  tinted  license  plate,  the  officer smelled  marijuana,
and  Applicant admitted  to  the  officer  that he  had  marijuana  in his car. During  his  January
2020   background   interview,  he   indicated   that  he   obtained   the   marijuana   from   a   friend
because   he   needed   it   to   sleep   while   he   was  visiting   his  parents.   At  the   hearing,  he
testified, however, that  he  did not obtain the  marijuana  for his personal use. Rather, he
was simply  transporting  the  marijuana  for his  sibling  who  was going  through  a  divorce.
He  intended   to   offer  the   marijuana   to   his  sibling   as  a   way   for  his  sibling   to   relax.  He
testified  that  he  had  never used  marijuana  with  his  sibling. He  hired  an  attorney, appeared
in court, took an online  drug  education class, and  paid a  fine  of a couple hundred dollars
to  have  the  charge  expunged  from  his record. (SOR; Answer; GE  1, 2;  Tr. at  25-27, 45-
52)
Applicant  stated  in  his  2019  SCA  that  he  would  not  use  marijuana  if  he  were
required  to  stop.  He  indicated  during  his  January  2020  background  interview  that  he
planned to use marijuana once monthly because it was fun. When he was asked during
his second background interview on February 7, 2020 about his discrepant statements
regarding  his  future  intent  with  marijuana,  he  indicated  that  he  did  not  plan  to  use
marijuana in the future. He stated in his Answer and testified that he made his previous
statements about his future intent with marijuana under the idea that marijuana was legal
or  being  made  legal  under  state  law.  Upon  further  research,  he  testified  that  he
understood marijuana remained illegal under federal law, and he intended to comply with
both state and federal laws and abstain from marijuana use in the future.  He signed a
statement of intent in February 2022, in which he stated that he would abstain from any
drug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that any future involvement
or  misuse  would  be  grounds  for  revocation  of  his  national  security  eligibility.  (SOR;
Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A; Tr. at 21-22, 31-32, 37-38, 68-73)
Applicant  testified  that  he  manages  his  anxiety  by  living  an  active  and  healthy
lifestyle. He indicated during his January 2020 background interview and in his June 2020
interrogatory responses that he associates with an individual who uses illegal drugs, and
he clarified during his testimony that this individual is a friend who has a prescription for
the  medical  use  of  marijuana.  He  testified,  however,  that  he  no  longer  socializes  with
individuals who use marijuana, as he changed his social circle in approximately 2016. If
he were to find himself in a situation where marijuana was being used, he testified that
he would remove himself. He testified that he is not subject to random drug tests by his
employer. He was voluntarily drug tested by his doctor in January 2022 and the test did
not show any illegal drug use. (GE 2; AE A; Tr. at 21, 43-44, 68-73)

"In  his  answer  to  the  SOR, Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  contained  in SOR  ¶¶
1.a through  1.f.  His admissions  are accepted  as findings of  fact.
Applicant is 35 years old and divorced since 2021. He lives with his girlfriend. He
has two children with his former wife and a child with his girlfriend. In 2018, he earned an
associate’s degree, and in 2021, a bachelor’s degree  in business administration. He is
enrolled in a master’s degree program. He has been working for a defense contractor for
the past six years. He is a supervisor. (Tr. 14-17)
Applicant has a history of illegally using cannabis. In November 2003, Applicant
was arrested and charged with possession of cannabis. This charge was dismissed, but
he was required to complete 50 hours of community service and one year of supervision.
In April 2005, he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of drugs,
possessing  cannabis,  improper  display  license  plate,  and  registration  expiration.  The
charges were dismissed after proving he was not under the influence of cannabis and no
cannabis  was  found  in  his  car.  In  December 2005,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with
possession of cannabis and drug paraphernalia.  This charge was dropped. (Tr. 22-24;
GE 2 at 9, 11; GE 3)
In February 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony cultivation of
cannabis  plants,  manufacturing/delivering  cannabis,  and  possession  of  cannabis.  He
pleaded  guilty  to  production  of  cannabis,  a  felony.  He  was  fined  $9,323,  placed  on
probation for two years, and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. (Tr. 24;
GE 2 at 10; GE 3)
In  his April 2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA), Applicant disclosed  his 2003
and  two  2005  misdemeanor charges and  his 2010  felony  conviction,  all  of which involved
the  illegal use  and  possession  of cannabis.  (GE 1  at  30-32) He  wrote  in  his SCA  that  he
“quit smoking  completely  when  I pursued  a  position  with  a  [defense  contractor] last  year.”
(GE 1  at 34) In  his August 2018  background  interview  about the  information  in his SCA
(more   than   a   year  after  submitting   his SCA),  Applicant   discussed   in  detail   his   criminal
activity  involving  cannabis.  He  told  the  investigator that he  only  used  cannabis  on  special
occasions and  would stop  using  it if  necessary  to  obtain a  security  clearance. (GE 2  at
14) In  his November 2019  Interrogatories, Applicant stated  that he  used  cannabis on  a
regular basis and  intended  to  use  it  in  the  future.  He said he  used  it  with  his  girlfriend.
(GE 2 at 2-3)
While  testifying,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  purchased  and  used  cannabis  with
varying frequency from about August 2001 through November 2019. He used it the week
before his hearing.  He uses  it a  couple times  a  week  as  a leisure activity to  relax.  He
believes that holders of security clearances are permitted to use marijuana. He said he is
not addicted to it, and could stop if necessary to keep his job. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 18-20,
27)
Applicant said he no longer associates with the people with whom he was involved
at  the  time  of  his  arrests.  He  does  not  use  cannabis  with  any  person  other  than  his
girlfriend (now wife), who has a medical marijuana card. (Tr. 18-9, 25-26) He stated he
did not use marijuana for a couple years prior to 2009. (Tr. 20-22)
Applicant  stated  that  he  was  unaware  that  as  an  employee  for  a  defense
contractor, he was prohibited from using cannabis as it is illegal under federal law.  He
thought that because his state legalized cannabis that the federal government did too. He
said he is not subject to drug testing at his job. (Tr. 27-30)

Applicant  served  in  the  U.S.  military  from  August  2010  until  he  was  separated
with a general under honorable conditions discharge in March 2013. He lived on base in
Germany  from  April  2011  until he  and  his  then  wife  decided  to  move  off  base  in  April
2012. In October 2012, his then wife reported to the military that as she was moving out
of  their  residence,  she  discovered  two  pipes  that  she  suspected  were  used  to  smoke
marijuana.  She  told  the  investigators  that  Applicant  had  a  history  of  marijuana  use
before  joining  the  military.  Military  investigators  seized  the  pipes.  A  field  test  of  both
pipes tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana.
Applicant  provided  a  urine  sample,  which  tested  negative  for  controlled  substances.

Applicant  requested  an  attorney,  and  was  not  interviewed  by  the  investigators.
His supervisor (E-6) reported that Applicant told him that the pipes were his from before
he  joined  the  military.  An  officer  (O-4)  that  Applicant  worked  for  reported  that  he
overheard  the  conversation  in  which  Applicant  admitted  that  the  “bong”  was  his  from
before the military. Both the E-6 and the O-4, as well as other military members, wrote
glowing letters of recommendation for Applicant to remain in the military. (GE 5; AE G)

Applicant  denied  ever  using  any  illegal  drugs  before  leaving  the  military.  He
testified  that  the  pipes  belonged  to  his  sister  who  used  marijuana,  and  that  they  must
have gotten mixed in with his household goods when he joined the military. He stated
that his ex-wife was upset at him because of their imminent divorce. She told him that
she found the pipes in a storage container or a box, and she thought he planted them
there to get her in trouble. He testified that she wanted to retract her statement, but she
was fearful of the legal repercussions of doing so. (Tr. at 17-23, 44-48)
Applicant’s  mother  wrote  a  statement  in  February  2013  in  which  she  wrote  that
she met with Applicant’s wife in February 2013:
When  we  met, we  discussed  the  divorce,  how  she  was hurt  by  it, and  how
it contributed  to  her making  the  statements that she  did.  She  explained  to
me  that she  was very  sorry  that she  ever did  it, but doesn’t want to  come
forward  to   retract   her  statement   for  fear  of  possible   legal  ramifications.
From  what I understand, she  said she  spoke with  her friend’s father who  is
a   lawyer  and   advised   her  about   the   consequences  of  making   a   false
statement and subsequently taking it back. (AE F)
Applicant’s  ex-wife  wrote  an  email  to  Applicant’s  military  defense  counsel  in
February 2013, in which she posed the following question:
I just  wanted  to  ask  you  what  the  legality  of  a  statement retraction  would
be, and  whether it would be  considered  perjury  to  make  a  statement in a
word document retracting  a  previous statement to  police.  Also  what would
the  possible consequences be to that?  (AE E)
The E-6 also wrote a statement in February 2013 in which he attempted to clarify
his statement from October 2012:
I  left  out  of   the   statement  how   I  was  uncertain  of   how   [Applicant]   had
worded   that   drugs  had   been   found   with   residue   and   possibly   fingerprints
on   them.   I  feel  my   statements  may   have   been   taking   as  a   point   of  fact
rather than as hear say (sic) from the previous days.  (AE F)
Applicant’s   sister  wrote   a   statement  to   his  military   defense   counsel  in  February
2013  with  the  following: “The  pipes  that were found  in  [Applicant’s]  possession  were my

"SOR  ¶  1.a  alleged  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency,  from
March 2015 to about December 2020. SOR ¶ 1.b alleged that Applicant purchased a dab
pen  and  tincture  to  use  marijuana  in  June  2019.  He  admitted  both  SOR  allegations,
except for his alleged intent to continue to use marijuana in the future, which he denied.
His SOR admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the
record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  24-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  graduated  from

married and has no children. Applicant worked as an intern for his current employer and
security sponsor, a federal contractor, between June and September 2019. He has been
a full-time employee with the federal contractor since July 2020.
In his answers to Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his October
2020  SCA, Applicant disclosed that  he  illegally used  marijuana  with  varying frequency
between March 2015 and September 2020. (Item 3) He described his illegal marijuana
use as follows:
“Purely  recreational. I  only  smoke  when  hanging  out  with  friends. I first tried
pot during  my  junior year in high  school  and  did not touch  it again  until my
junior year of  college  4  years later . .  . I  smoked  the most during  junior and
senior year of college  probably  averaging  2  times a  month  at my  peak. Now
I would say I smoke about every 2 or 3 months.”
He also  stated his intent to use marijuana in the  future.
During a January 7, 2021 interview with a government investigator, Applicant was
questioned  about  his  illegal  use  of  marijuana.  (Item  4)  He  indicated  he  started  using
marijuana in high school in 2015, because of peer pressure. He clarified that he resumed
his marijuana use during his sophomore year in college in 2018. He purchased marijuana
when he turned 21 in June 2019. He claimed that his most recent uses of marijuana were
in September and December 2020.
Applicant acknowledged knowing that marijuana is illegal under both his state and
federal law. He admitted during his interview that he was currently using marijuana. He
explained that he had purchased a dab pen and tinctures (liquid marijuana extractions)
and  still  had  four  or  five  doses  left.  When  asked  about  his  current  and  future  use  of
marijuana, he stated that he did not believe he is addicted to marijuana, but intended to
keep on using his tincture until it runs out.
Applicant has been tested for drug use by his employer at least twice since he was
hired in July 2020. He stated he is not concerned about testing positive because his use
is infrequent, only once every few months. Initially, he claimed not to know whether his
employer  has  a  policy  against  the  use  of  illegal  drugs,  but  believes  that  if  he  tested
positive there would be a problem.
When  asked  whether  he  would  continue  his  illegal  marijuana  use  knowing  it  is
illegal under both state and federal law, and knowing his employer has a policy against it,
Applicant  stated  he  would  not  use  marijuana  in  the  future  and  that  he  would  probably
throw his tincture away. He does not want to risk losing his clearance eligibility over his
use of marijuana. He noted that his friends and some coworkers know about his marijuana
use. He is not concerned about being blackmailed because his use is infrequent.
In  his  April  2021  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  stated  that  he
decided  to  stop  using  marijuana  in  December  2020  because  he  wanted  to  get  a
clearance. He stated twice that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. The last
time he purchased marijuana was roughly one year and nine months prior to his answer
to the interrogatories. He claimed that he no longer hangs out with anyone that does drugs
often. He presented no documentary evidence to show that he sought or received any
medical or psychological treatment or counseling for substance abuse.

"In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b concerning his history of
marijuana use and use after submitting his SCA. He  denied SOR ¶ 1c, concerning his
future intent to use marijuana. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  evidence  submitted,  and
testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 57 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1989. He works as a
senior cyber and software expert and executive for a computer software company that
contracts with the U.S. Government. He was married in 1999 and has no children. This
is his first application for a security clearance. (Tr. 16-19; GE 1)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  from  May  1979  to  July
2020. He reported that he has lived in states where marijuana use was legal and that he
intended to continue his use it. Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator
in  September  2020,  and  he  disclosed  historical  information  about  his  marijuana  use,
and stated that he saw no reason to stop using marijuana. He was told by a government
investigator that illegal drug usage is incompatible with maintaining a security clearance
regardless  of  any  particular  state  law,  and  his  use  would  preclude  him  from  holding  a
security clearance. He asserted that he is not dependent on marijuana usage and could
stop if someone from the government told him that he needed to refrain from use. (GE
1, 2)
Applicant testified that he has been forthright about his history of marijuana use.
He stated that his use has been sporadic over time, and he has never had an addiction
or a problem with marijuana. He asserted that he has never been a daily user, and that
he  used  it  more  frequently  when  he  was  living  in  states  where  it  was  legalized.  He
stated that he now understands that the marijuana prohibition in federal law supersedes
state legalization. (Tr. 20-22)
Applicant used marijuana a limited number of times after filling out his July 2020
SCA,  and  his  September  2020  interview  with  a  government  investigator.  He  asserted
that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  in  June  2021,  when  he  filled  out  his  interrogatory
response.  He  stated  that  he  knows  that  he  cannot  change  the  past,  but  he  made  a
decision when he submitted his interrogatory response to discontinue use. He respects
his employer and his role  with  them, and  since  he  used marijuana so  infrequently,  his
decision to abstain was not difficult. (Tr. 23-25, 42)
Applicant  stated  that he  has not used other illegal drugs.  When he moved  from
State A where marijuana was legal and available, to less permissive State B in February
of 2020, the frequency of his marijuana use dropped. He asserted that he has only used
marijuana ten times since moving to State B, and he has only used it at home with his
wife.  He  claims  they  purchased  it  only  one  time  after  moving  to  State  B,  through  a
dispensary. His wife still uses marijuana, and has used it more frequently than he has.
(Tr. 23-30, 33-36)
His  employer’s  drug  and  alcohol  policy  prohibits  use  or  possession  or  both  at
work,  as  well  as  use  before  work  or  while  conducting  business.  It  also  states  that
criminal  convictions  involving  either  will  not  be  tolerated.  He  stated  that  he  has  never
had a random drug screening by his current employer, but has passed drug tests given
in  two  prior positions.  His  employer  and  FSO  is aware  of  his past  marijuana  use,  and
the specific allegations in the SOR. (Tr. 26-33; AE A)
When asked why he still used marijuana after filling out his SCA and his interview
with  a  government  investigator,  Applicant  stated  that  he  thought  that  he  would  be
precluded from receiving a security clearance because of his history with marijuana. He
stated  that  his  answers  about  his  future  intent  for  use  on  his  SCA  and  to  the
investigator, which did not present him in a positive light, were also rooted in that belief.
He  expressed  this  belief  at  the  start  of  his  hearing.  He  asserted  that  even  after  forty
years  of  sporadic  use,  he  was  able  to  abstain  from  marijuana  use  for  the  last  year,
because  it  is  not  important  to  him.  He  asserted  that  he  has  gone  years  without  using
marijuana in the past, and it was not a problem for him. (Tr. 19-21, 26-33)
He  stated
that  he  understands  why  marijuana  use  creates  risks  and
vulnerabilities beyond the issue of impairment. He knows that his requirement to refrain
from marijuana use, and the obligations and behavior expected of a security clearance
holder transcends duty hours, and is required whenever and wherever he may be. (Tr.
37-44)
Applicant stated that since he moved in early 2020, the circumstances where he
had  used  marijuana  changed,  as  he  is  no  longer  in  social  situations  or  environments
where  it  was  used.  He  is  still  in  contact  with  friends  with  whom  he  used  marijuana  in
State A, but they live  2000 miles away.  He stated that he would not be obliged to use
marijuana if offered; it was never important to him, and he will continue to abstain. (Tr.
37-44)
Applicant claims that his career history shows that  he has good judgement, and
can  follow  rules  and  regulations.  He  submitted  four  letters  of  recommendation  and  a
personal  profile,  career  history,  and  performance  review  package  into  the  record.  The
letters highlighted his character, judgement, honesty, and professional skills. (Tr. 37-44;
AE A-F)

telecommunications debts, and medical debts. Applicant denied the debts described in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.h-1.k without further elaboration. He admitted the debts described in
SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.g  and  1.l  without  further  elaboration.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as
findings  of  fact.  Applicant  attributed  his  financial  difficulties  to  being  young  and  not
having a steady income. He claimed that he will be staying on top of  his finances and
his  financial  difficulties  will  not  continue.  He  has  not  received  any  form  of  financial
counseling.  I  find  that  the  Guideline  F  SOR  allegations  are  established  through  credit

corroborate these payments. (Items 1, 2, 4-7)
The judgments in favor of City A alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.f have not been

disputed this debt, offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant
action to resolve this debt. (Items 1, 2, 4, 6)
Applicant used marijuana three to four times from June to July 2016. He claimed
that he has not used marijuana since July 2016 and has no intention to use it again. He
stated that he wants to become an FBI agent and understands that using marijuana will
hurt his chances of attaining this goal. (Items 1, 4)
In  September  2018,  police  found  about  two  grams  of  marijuana  in  his  vehicle
after  stopping  him  for  speeding.  Applicant  was  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana,
first  offense.  In  June  2019,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  this offense.  He  was  sentenced  to  30
days in jail with all 30 days suspended, was required to pay court costs and fines, and
his driver’s license was restricted to travel to and from work and church. (Items 1-4, 9)
Applicant claimed that the marijuana that the police found in his car was not his.
He  claimed  that he  shared his car with  his two  brothers and another friend.  He stated
that he does not know whose marijuana was in his car as his brothers and his friend all
denied leaving marijuana there. (Items 1, 3, 4, 9)
The Government alleged Applicant’s aforementioned 2016 marijuana use and his
2018  marijuana  possession  charge  and  2019  conviction  under  Guideline  H  of  the
Directive (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b). Despite telling his investigator about his 2016 marijuana
use,  he  denied  that  allegation  in  his  response  to  the  SOR.  He  admitted  the  allegation
concerning  his  possession  of  marijuana  charge  and  conviction.  His  admission  is
adopted as a finding of fact. I find that the Guideline H SOR allegations are established
through  Applicant’s  January  2021  subject  interview,  court  records,  and  Applicant’s
admission. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 9)
In October 2017, Applicant was fired from his job at a grocery store for stealing
food. Applicant claimed that he stole a $5 to $6 plate of food for one of his co-workers
who  had  no  money  and  had  not  eaten  in  three  days.  When  his  manager  confronted
Applicant about the theft, Applicant admitted it and  attempted to give his manager $50
to repay the grocery store for the stolen food. Applicant claimed that he was fired during
this  meeting  with  his  manager.  Despite  being  required  to  do  so,  Applicant  failed  to
report  this  firing  on  the  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  he
submitted  in  September  2020.  He  intentionally  failed  to  disclose  this  firing  to  avoid
providing negative information about himself. (Items 1, 2, 4)
Applicant  failed  to  disclose  his  2016  marijuana  use  on  his  SF  86  despite  being
required  to  do  so.  He  admitted  that  he  intentionally  failed  to  disclose  this  drug  use
because he did not want to look like he was involved with drugs.
Applicant failed  to  disclose  his  judgments  and  delinquent  debts  on  his SF 86.  He
was  required   to   report  the   SOR   debts   listed   as  SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.e   and   1.g-1.l.  The
judgment listed  in SOR  ¶  1.f had  not  yet been   entered  when  applicant certified  his SF
86.  Applicant   claimed   that   he   failed   to   list   these   debts  on   his  SF   86   because   he   was
rushing to complete the  form, he  forgot about them, or because of  oversight. (Items 1, 2,

In  the  SOR,  under Guideline  E,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  2017  firing
and  his  intentional  failure  to  report  this  firing  in  his  SF  86.  Under  Guideline  E,  it  also
alleged  Applicant’s  intentional  failure  to  disclose  his  marijuana  use  and  his  delinquent
debts  in  his  SF  86  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a-3.d).  In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted

"Applicant is 29-years-old. He has been employed with a defense contractor since
September  2021.  He  is  single.  Applicant  received  a  Doctorate  in  August  2021.  He  is
seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  work  with  the  Defense
Department. This is his first application for a security clearance.
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  four  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
1.a  and  1.d.  Applicant  used  marijuana  approximately  seven  to  nine  times  between
2015 and October 2020. His usage included  smoking marijuana  and consuming edibles.
He purchased  marijuana  on  a  single occasion  in 2018.  HIs  October  2020  marijuana  use
occurred  when  he  visited  friends in  a  state  where the  purchase  and  use  of  marijuana  is
legal. He further testified  that he  stopped  marijuana  use  because  he  really  did  not like  it
and  he  wanted  to  move  on  with  his career.  (Tr. 21-27, 42-44,  46;  Government Exhibit 1
at Section  23; Government Exhibit 2.)
1.b   and   1.c.   Applicant   purchased   and   used   psilocybin  mushrooms  on   a   single
occasion   in   about   July   2020   with   friends.  He  realizes  that  the   purchase   and   use   of
mushrooms was illegal. He has no  intention  of using  or purchasing  any  mushrooms in the
future,   admitting   that   this  was  an   impulsive   mistake.  He  is no   longer  in  touch   with   the
person from  whom  he obtained the mushrooms. (Tr. 44-45, 54; Government Exhibit 1  at
Section 23; Government Exhibit 2.)
Applicant submitted a Statement of Intent. In that Statement he indicated that he
is not currently using any controlled substances, that he has no future intent to use any
illegal  controlled  substances  or  misuse  prescription  medication,  and  he  stipulated  to
random  drug  testing  and  the  immediate  and  unqualified  revocation  of  his  security
clearance in the event of a positive drug test. (Applicant Exhibit G.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline G  –  Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he consumes intoxicants to excess. Applicant denied the single allegation under
this paragraph.
2.a.  Applicant admitted  that he  has consumed  alcohol, occasionally  to  intoxication,
starting  in  about  March  2018  through  December  2021.  He  testified  that  he  has  reduced
his  drinking   “significantly”  because   he   is   too   busy   with   his   job   and   healthy   personal
lifestyle   to   engage   in  excessive   alcohol  consumption.  He   has  had   no   alcohol-related
arrests  or  incidents   at   any   time   in  his  past.   There  is  no   evidence   that  he   has  been
diagnosed with an alcohol problem.  A current coworker submitted a  statement  indicating
that  he  has  not seen  the  Applicant  drink to  the  point  of  intoxication  during  the  time  he  has
known him. (Tr. 27-39, 45-46; Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit D.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  conduct  that  shows  poor  judgment,  untrustworthiness  or
unreliability. Applicant denied subparagraph 3.a. He admitted the other two allegations.
3.a.  This  subparagraph  alleged  that  Applicant socializes with  individuals who  use
illegal  substances.  Applicant  testified   that  he   has  informed   the   people  he   used   illegal
substances  with  earlier  that they  could  not do  that  in  front  of him.  He  believes that these
people will support  him  in this endeavor. Applicant Exhibit F is a  statement  from  a  friend
concerning  Applicant’s  decision  not to  be  around  people who  use  illegal substances. (Tr.
46-49.)
3.b.   The   Government   alleges  in  this  subparagraph   that  Applicant’s  drug   use
history, as set forth  under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E.
3.c.   The   Government  alleges  in  this  subparagraph   that  Applicant’s  alcohol   use
history, as set forth  under Paragraph  2, above, is also cognizable under Guideline  E.

Applicant received an evaluation from a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist
(LMFT) who is also an Addiction Treatment Counselor. Her report is dated June 6, 2022,
and is Applicant Exhibit H. Based on her evaluation of Applicant using various diagnostic
criteria  she  reported,  “[Applicant]  does  not  fit  any  of  the  criteria;  thus  no  evidence  of
misuse of drugs or alcohol. He has not experienced any adverse effects or consequences
consistent with the misuse of substances.”
The therapist further stated, “Lastly, my impression of [Applicant] is that he is an
honest, reliable, hard-working individual. He also made it clear to me that a career is of
the  utmost  importance  to  him  and  he  would  not  do  anything  to  jeopardize  such  a  life-
changing opportunity.”
As stated, Applicant Exhibit D is a letter from a coworker. The witness writes that
Applicant is an effective member of the team stating, “He [Applicant] is honest about his
work and someone I can trust to put forth his best work.”
The record shows that Applicant had a successful academic career. In addition to
school,  he  also  engaged  in  extra-curricular  activities  that  helped  his  community.

"The SOR alleges under Guideline H, and cross-references under Guideline E (SOR
¶ 2.a) that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2008 to at least
November  2017  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  that  he  was  arrested  for  possession  of  a  controlled
substance in February 1992 (SOR ¶ 1.b), possession of marijuana in January 1996 (SOR ¶
1.c),  and  felony  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  possession  of  marijuana,  and
possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  in  November  2017  (SOR  ¶  1.e);  and  that  he  tested
positive  for marijuana  in  a  March 2009 urinalysis test (SOR ¶ 1.d). Additionally, under
Guideline  E,  Applicant  is  alleged  to  have  falsified  his  October  13,  2020  Electronic
Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by responding negatively to an inquiry
into  whether  he  had  ever  been  charged  for  an  offense  involving  alcohol  or  drugs  and
deliberately concealing the drug charges in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e. (Item 1.)
When Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted that he had used marijuana in
the past, but not since 2009 when he failed a drug urinalysis test. He admitted his arrests in
1992, 1996, and 2017, but asserted that the 1992 and 1996 charges were dropped and he
was released by the police in the 2017 incident because he was not impaired.  As for his
alleged failure to list the charges on his SF 86, he indicated that he was not aware that he
had to report offenses that were outside the 10-year scope of the SF 86 and claimed that
he was suspected of driving under the influence in the 2017 incident and was unaware of
the marijuana charge before being contacted by investigators. He asserted that he knew he
could not hide public information from the DOD. (Item 2.)
After considering Items 1 through 10 in the FORM, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old high school graduate. He served on active duty in the
United States Air Force from October 1986 until April 1990, when he was granted a general
discharge under honorable conditions. The circumstances that led to his discharge are not
in evidence. Applicant has been married since May 2000 and has two daughters, now in
their early 30s, from previous relationships. He has worked as an aircraft maintenance
technician for a defense contractor most recently since December 2009. He previously
worked for the company as a flight operations mechanic from November 1998 until March
2000, when he was laid off. (Items 3-5.)
Applicant  was  employed  outside  of  the  defense  industry  from  March  2000  to
December 2009. (Items 3-5.) With his return to work for the defense contractor contingent
on him obtaining an interim clearance, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-
QIP on December 9, 2009. He responded negatively to the e-QIP’s police record inquiries,
including whether he had ever been charged with any offenses related to alcohol or drugs.
He answered “Yes” to a question concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years
and indicated that he smoked marijuana once on vacation in February 2009. He responded
negatively to an inquiry into any counseling or treatment in the last seven years because of
his use of illegal drugs. (Item 3.)
A  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  records  check  on  December  18,  2009,
revealed that he had been arrested in May 1990 for assault and battery; in January 1996
for possession of marijuana; and in April 2001 for violation of an ex parte order. (Item 6.)
On February 25, 2010, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
OPM. He explained about his January 1996 marijuana arrest that he was visiting a person,
whom  he  later  learned  was  a  drug  dealer,  when  police  raided  the  residence.  He  was
arrested for having a small amount of marijuana on his person and spent a night in jail
before being released. The charge was subsequently dismissed. As for his reported use of
marijuana,  he  was  on  vacation  with  some  friends  for  his  wife’s  birthday,  and  they  all
smoked marijuana. After he returned from the vacation, he was selected for a random drug
screen by his then employer in March 2009, and he tested positive for marijuana. He was
required by his then employer to attend a drug and alcohol awareness program, which he
said  consisted  of  one  session  a  week  for  one  month.  Applicant  denied  any  other
involvement with marijuana. (Item 5.) On November 4, 2010, DOHA granted him a DOD
secret clearance. (Item 10.)
On  June  24, 2020, the  DOD Continuous Evaluation  Program  developed  unreported
information  (validated  on  July  2, 2020) that Applicant had  been  arrested  on  November 21,
2017, and charged with felony possession of a controlled substance except 35 grams or
less of  marijuana/ synthetic  cannabinoid;  possession  of marijuana/synthetic  cannabinoid  of
11-35  grams; and  unlawful possession  of  drug  paraphernalia. (Items  9, 10.)  The  police
records show  that Applicant had  been  involved  in an  accident with  another vehicle. The
responding officers detected the odor of burnt marijuana  about Applicant,  whose  vehicle
was then  searched. A  small  bag  of  marijuana  was in plain  view  on  the  floorboard in the
backseat of  the  car. Additionally, the  police  seized  a  metal grinder containing  marijuana
and, from  the  center console,  a  small  bag  containing  suspected  crack cocaine.  During a
search of  Applicant’s person  incident to  his arrest,  the  police  found  a  small  metal pipe
containing  burnt residue  in his back pocket. Laboratory  tests revealed  that approximately
2.2   grams  of   marijuana   and   1.3   grams  of   cocaine   had   been   seized   from   Applicant’s
vehicle. On  March 13, 2018, the  county  prosecutor notified  the  police  that the  case  would
not  be   prosecuted.  (Item   8.)  The   reason   for  the   declination   of   prosecution   is  not  in
evidence.
On October 13, 2020, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-QIP on
which he responded negatively to the police record inquiries, including the following:
In the last seven (7) years have you been arrested by any police officer,
sheriff, marshal or other type of law enforcement official?;
Have you EVER been charged with any felony offense? (Include those under
the Uniform Code of Military Justice and non-military/civilian felony offenses);
and
Have you EVER been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?
Applicant also responded negatively to e-QIP inquiries concerning any illegal use of
a  drug  or  controlled  substance  in  the  last  seven  years  and  any  illegal  use  or  illegal
involvement with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. In
response  to  a  question  about  whether  he  had  ever  been  ordered  to  seek  treatment
because of illegal drug use, Applicant responded that he had failed a drug test in 2008 [sic]
and  attended  a program from March  2009 to November 2009 after testing positive for
marijuana. Applicant reported no alcohol-related incidents, counseling, or treatment on his
e-QIP. He answered negatively to the following question:
In the last seven (7) years has your use of alcohol had a negative impact on
your  work  performance,  your  professional or personal relationships,  your
finances,  or  resulted  in  intervention  by  law  enforcement/public  safety
personnel?  (Item 4.)
On March 10, 2021, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator about his
unreported  November  2017  drug-related  arrest.  When  asked  whether  he  had  been
arrested or detained in the last seven years, Applicant responded that he was detained for
a short time in the Fall of 2017 but added that he thought only arrests had to be disclosed.
He explained that he had been rear-ended by another vehicle and for some reason the
police felt he was intoxicated even though he passed a breathalyzer test. He denied that he
had been charged with other offenses, even after he was confronted with the drug charges.
He asserted that he had not used marijuana since his treatment in 2008 and would not use
any drugs in the future; that his brother had sometimes used his name and been in legal
trouble; and that he had reported this to the police.  He stated that he had never been
notified of a drug arrest; was unaware of it; and it did not happen. (Item 7.)
Applicant is the only listed suspect on the police records of the November 2017
incident.  The  personally  identifying  information  (PII) for Applicant  on  the  police  report,
including the home address, date of birth, age, social security number, height and weight
(within five pounds), matches his PII on his October 2020 e-QIP. (Items 4, 9.) The police
report also contains a driver’s license number for Applicant. (Item 9.) The brother named by
Applicant as having used his name on occasion is five years younger than Applicant, and
he has a different address. (Item 4.)
On November 3, 2021, Applicant completed interrogatories from DOHA. In response
to an inquiry into whether he had ever illegally used any drugs or controlled substances,
Applicant responded that he had used “Pot” one time, in 2009, and he did not intend to use
the drug in the future. (Item 7.)
When Applicant responded to the SOR on January 10, 2022, he admitted he had
been arrested in November 2017 after his car was rear-ended on the highway, but then
stated:
While  getting  checked  out in the  ambulance, the  officer mistakenly  thought
that  I  was  impaired,  though   I  was  not.   He  took  me   into   the   station   for  a
sobriety  check which I passed  and  was  released  because  I  was  not  impaired.
When  the  investigator reached  out to  me  about this incident,  it had  verbiage
about  a   marijuana   possession   that  I  was  unaware  of.  I  currently   have   a
lawyer looking into this incident.
As to  why  he  did not list the  incident on  his October 2020 e-QIP, Applicant stated
that he  “admitted  and  reported” that he  was suspected  of  DUI on  the  date  in question  but
that he  took a  sobriety  test and  was released. He reiterated  that he  knew  nothing  of  a
marijuana  charge  at the  time. About his failure to  disclose  his  1992  and  1996  drug  arrests
on  his e-QIP, Applicant stated  that he  was unaware that he  had  “to  repeat a  topic already
addressed that fell outside of the 10yr range  of the current investigation.” (Item 2).

"Applicant is 33 years old.  He is not married and has no children.  He has a high
school  diploma,  several  college  courses,  and  military  training.  He  is  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  as  an  Electrician.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in
connection  with  his  employment.  Applicant began  working  for his current  employer in
2013.  In his answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
Applicant’s history of excessive alcohol abuse leading to questionable judgment,
and  the  failure  to  control  impulses,  raises  questions  about  his  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Guideline J:   Criminal Conduct
Applicant’s  history  of  criminal  conduct  creates  doubt  about  his  judgment,
It  also  calls  into  question  his  ability  or  willingness  to
reliability,  and  trustworthiness.
comply with laws, rules, and regulations.
Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from 2007 to 2012.  He separated at the rank
of E-4, petty officer, third class, and received an honorable discharge.  Applicant held a
security clearance in the military without incident.  Applicant began consuming alcohol
when he joined the Navy. He started by consuming a couple of beers at social events.
As time passed, he found himself drinking as much as ten beers at a time to the point of
intoxication.  (Government Exhibit 2.)
In  2010,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  Driving  Under  the  Influence
(DUI.)  Applicant  explained  that  he  was  with  a  close friend,  at  a bar  drinking alcohol.
Before driving back to his parent’s house, Applicant believes he consumed at least five
beers and two shots of hard liquor.  (Tr. pp. 23-24.)  While driving, Applicant hit another
car.  When the police arrived,  Applicant was administered the breathalyzer, and found
to be legally intoxicated.  Applicant was arrested and taken into custody.  Applicant pled
nolo contendere to the DUI charge.  He was found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine
and  referred  to  driver’s  education  classes  and  alcohol  counseling.  His  license  was
revoked  for  one  year,  and  he  was  required  to  attend  a  substance  abuse  rehabilitation
program.  Applicant  was  also  required  to  pay  restitution  for  the  damage  from  the
accident.  Applicant  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings.  Since  Applicant
was active duty Navy at the time of the arrest, he was reduced in rank from E-4 to E-3,
placed on one month’s restriction on the ship, and forfeited to half a month’s pay for two
months.  (Tr. p. 29, and Government Exhibit 4.)  Following this arrest, Applicant states
(Tr.  p.  31.)  When
that  he  was  able  to  maintain  sobriety  for  about  nine  months.
Applicant  returned  to  consuming  alcohol,  he  states  that  he  would  have  a  few  drinks
every now and then.
In 2014, Applicant was charged with Reckless Driving.  Applicant explained that
he  was  at  his  cousin’s  house,  talking,  drinking,  and  playing  cards.  Applicant  believes
that he had consumed only one beer before driving home.  (Tr. p. 32.)  Applicant was
pulled over by the police, and administered the breathalyzer.  Applicant believes that he
passed  the  sobriety  tests,  as  he  was  not  arrested.  He  was  given  a  Reckless  Driving
citation, and required to appear in court.  (Tr. p. 33.)  Applicant was sentenced to pay a
fine,  required  to  enroll  in  and  complete  a  driver  improvement  course,  and  required  to
remain arrest and conviction free for a period of six months.  After receiving this ticket,
Applicant stopped drinking altogether for about six months.  (Tr. p. 36 and Government
Exhibit 5.)
In  2015,  Applicant  was  arrested  again  for  DUI.  Applicant  stated  that  he  and  a
close friend were hanging out.  They went drinking at a bar, and then took a taxi back to
his friend’s place to sleep.  Applicant believes that he had consumed, “under ten beers”
before the arrest.  (Tr. p. 37.)  Applicant spent the  night at his friend’s house,  and the
next afternoon at about 2:00 pm, he drove home.  Applicant fell asleep at the stop light,
and when he woke up, he continued driving.  He was pulled over by law enforcement.
Applicant was administered the breathalyzer, and taken into custody.  Applicant’s court
case was eventually dismissed on a technicality, as the officer did not appear.  (Tr. pp.
40-41, and Government Exhibits 6 and 7.)
Following  this  arrest,  Applicant  was  able  to  remain  totally  sober  for  about  nine
months.  (Tr. p. 42.)  Applicant stated that during this time he would stay away from his
friends.  In 2016, he started drinking alcohol again at social events.
In  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  DUI  again.  Applicant  stated  that  he  was
drinking  with  a  friend.  Applicant  consumed  at  least  five  beers  and  two  shots  of  hard
liquor, and then decided to drive home.  On this occasion, Applicant “rear-ended” a bus
and  then  reversed  the  car,  and  hit  a  police  car.  Applicant  was  administered  the
breathalyzer  that  registered  a  .16  blood  alcohol  level,  which  was  twice  the  legal  limit.
Applicant  was  arrested  and  taken  into  custody.  Applicant  plead  nolo  contendere.  He
was  found  guilty,  and  sentenced  to  a  driver’s  education  classes,  his  license  was
revoked  for  one  year,  and  he  was  required  to  attend  a  substance  abuse  assessment
and rehabilitation program.  (Government Exhibit 8.)
Following this arrest,  Applicant  stopped  drinking for a  couple of  months.  When
he  started  drinking  again,  he  states  that  he  would  only  have  a  beer  here  and  there.
Applicant completed all of the court ordered sentencing requirements related to his four
alcohol-related arrests.  He states that he no longer drinks and drives.  Applicant states
that  he  is  a  good  employee  and  a  hard  worker  on  the  job.  He  is  the  first  one  in  his
family  to  be  able  to  purchase  a  house,  and  he  is  proud  of  this.  He  has  picked  up
gardening as a hobby.  (Tr. p. 50.)  He is working to improve himself.
Applicant  acknowledges  that  he  is  an  alcoholic.
(Tr.  p.  53.)  He  has  never
received  inpatient  treatment  for  alcohol  abuse,  or  attended  an  out-patient  treatment
program.  He is not currently attending AA meetings.  (Tr. p. 53.)  Applicant states that
the last time he consumed alcohol was a few months ago and it was a beer.  (Tr. p. 54.)

"Applicant admitted the sole SOR allegation contained in Paragraph 1.a. (Item 2)
His admission is incorporated into these findings of fact.
Applicant is 57 years old, married, and has two children. He earned a bachelor’s
degree  in  2016.  He  has  worked  for  his  employer  since  June  2014.  In  April  2017,  he
submitted a security clearance application (SCA) and was then granted a clearance. (Item
3)
In March 2019, Applicant failed a urinalysis test  and tested positive for cocaine.
His security clearance was subsequently revoked. During an interview in April 2020, he
told a government investigator that he had been at a party the night before the test and
consumed a large amount of alcohol. He did not recall using cocaine that night. He said
he has not had any other problems at his work. (Item 4)

"Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2004. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has
held since about 2008. He has an associate degree. He is twice married and divorced.
He has three children. (Items 4-7)
Applicant has a history of marijuana use. In his 2008 Questionnaire for National
Security  Positions  (SF  86),  he  reported  using  marijuana  about  seven  to  ten  times
between  2001  and  2007.  His  employer  is  a  major  defense  contractor  with  a  drug-free
workplace  policy,  with  the  following  guidance  to  employees:  “Even  though  marijuana
has been legalized in certain U.S. states, it is still considered illegal under federal law.
Therefore, our company prohibits its use, even in locations where it is not against state
law.” (Items 3, 4, 6-8)
Applicant either continued using marijuana or resumed using  marijuana after he
obtained  his  security  clearance.  He  reported  on  his  August  2018  SF  86  that  he  used
marijuana between 1984 and July 2018, including while holding a security clearance. It
is  unclear  from  the  record  whether  he  was  granted  access  to  classified  information
when  he  used  marijuana.  He  indicated  that  his  “[u]se  varied,  helped  with  depression
and  stress  at  times.  Frequency  varied.  Consecutive  days  to  months  going  by  with  no
use.”  He  indicated  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  near  future,  but
perhaps he would use it again at some point in the future. (Items 3, 5, 6, 8)
Applicant  provided  similar  information  when  he  was  interviewed  for  his
background investigation in October 2018. He stated that THC (the active ingredient in
marijuana) helped with his depression and stress. He stated that he used it primarily by
himself  and  sometimes  with  friends.  He  still  associated  with  those  friends,  but  if  they
smoked marijuana, he would not participate. (Item 6)
In his response to interrogatories in  December 2019, Applicant reported his last
THC  use  as  November  2019.  He  indicated  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  THC  at  that
time, but that could change if federal laws change. He admitted in his response to the
SOR that he intended to use marijuana in the future “in context of the law.” (Items 3, 8)
He did not respond to the FORM, so additional information is not available.

ages  21,  17,  and  15,  and  his  wife  has  two  children,  ages  17  and  13,  from  a  prior
relationship. Applicant received a high school diploma in 1998 and attended a technical
institute for two years, but did not receive a degree or certification. He enlisted in the U.S.
Navy in December 1998, but in April 2000 he was administratively discharge under Other
Than  Honorable  conditions.  He  held  a  security  clearance  while  serving  in  the  Navy.
Applicant  has  experienced  two  periods  of  unemployment  since  2016  (August  2016  to
September 2017 and December 210 to March 2019). He has been employed by a DoD
contractor as an artisan since March 2019. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance
in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 23-25; GE 1 at 14-16.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 1 are as follows:
1.a.   March  2000  Non-Judicial  Punishment  (NJP)
for  Drunkenness  and
Incapacitation  for  the  Performance  of  Duties.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his
Answer. He was too drunk to report for duty. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 27, 32; GE 2 at 19.)
1.b.   June  2008  Charge  of  Felony  Battery  resulted  from  an  incident  in  which
Applicant  was  under the  influence  of  alcohol.  Applicant denied  the battery  charge,  but
admitted that he  was under the influence of  alcohol at the  time of  the dispute  with  his
domestic partner and unplugged the house phone while his domestic partner was making
a call to 911. He was taken to jail intoxicated. The record evidence reflects that the battery
charge was a misdemeanor. The altercation was just verbal and there were no injuries.
The  record  evidence  also  reflects  that  the  offense  of  maliciously  obstructing  a
communication  device  is  also  a  misdemeanor.  Neither  the  battery  charge  nor  the
obstruction of the call charge were prosecuted. Applicant recalls pleading guilty to being
drunk. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 28, 32-35; GE 8 at 17; GE 9 at 2, 4.)
1.c.  November  2008  charge  of  Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol  (DUI).
Applicant admitted that he pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of DUI and was ordered
to  complete  a  DUI  program.  He  was  given  a  sentence  of  probation  for five  years.  His
driver’s license was also suspended. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 28, 35-36; GE 7 at 3.)
1.d.  February 2009 charge of Drunk in Public amended at the hearing to Driving
on Suspended License (DSL). Applicant denied the original allegation because he has no
memory of any such charge or arrest. Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to
conform  to  the  Government’s  evidence.  According  to  that  evidence,  Applicant  was
actually cited for DSL at that time. Applicant admitted this amended allegation. He was
sentenced to probation for three years. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 29, 35-37; GE 8 at 10; GE 10
at 8.)
1.e. March 2010 charges of  DUI and DSL and failure to complete court-ordered
DUI program. In his Answer Applicant admitted the arrest on that date and the charges.
He was on probation at that time for his 2008 DUI and his DSL convictions. He pled guilty
to misdemeanor DUI and was sentenced to probation for five years. The court ordered
him to attend a program for multiple DUI offenders. He denied part of the SOR allegation
because he disputed the Government’s claim that he had not completed the DUI program.
He testified that he completed the program, but his certificate of completion was never
submitted to the court. He requested the program manger to provide a duplicate certificate
to the court, and he submitted a copy of the certificate into evidence at the DOHA hearing.
The  certificate  reflects  that  Applicant  enrolled  in  the  course  in  October  2012  and
completed it in November 2016. He attributed the delay in enrolling and completing the
course to his inability to pay the fees associated with the program. It took him about four
years to complete an 18-month program. He claims that he sought extensions from the
court when he could not continue the program for financial reasons. (Answer at 2; Tr. at
29-30, 38-39; GE 7 at 3; AE A.)
1.f. April 2010 charges of DUI and DSL. Applicant asserts that these charges are
the same as those alleged in 1.e. The time difference between the two alleged dates is
only six days. He noted that during this period, he had no access to his vehicle, which
had been taken from him by the police. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 30, 39-40.)
1.g. August 2016 charges of DUI, DSL, Spousal Battery, and maliciously/unlawfully
removing  telephone.  At  the  hearing  Department  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  SOR
allegation  by  deleting  the  phrase  “maliciously/unlawfully  removed  telephone”  on  the
ground  that  this  charge  was  part  of  the  charges  filed  against  Applicant  and  alleged  in
SOR  1.b,  above,  and was  not  a  part of  the 2016  charges.  Applicant  denied  the  entire
allegation.  He  believes  that  his  criminal  records  are  wrong  or  they  have  been
misinterpreted  in the  preparation  of the  SOR.  He asserted  that he  has only  had  two  DUIs
(2008  and  2010)  and  the  battery  charge  is a  duplicate  of  the  2008  charge. At the  hearing,
Applicant denied  the  DUI charge, but  admitted  he  was cited  for DSL  due  to  the  lack  of a
record  evidencing   his   completion   of  the   court-ordered   course   that   was  part   of  his
sentence  for the  2010  DUI.  He argued  that his driver’s  license  should  never have  been
suspended.  He claimed  that  the  DSL  charge  was withdrawn  after  he  established  that  he
had completed  the  program  by  producing  a  duplicate  of  his certificate  of  completion. I find
Applicant’s  testimony   regarding   the   DSL   charge   to   be   credible   and   that   the   SOR
allegation regarding other charges is based upon incorrect information. (Answer at 2; Tr.
at 30, 40-45; GE 2 at 23; GE 7  at 4; GE 8 at  3, 21-24; GE 10 at 3.)
Applicant has never received any in-patient treatment for alcohol abuse. He has
never been diagnosed with alcohol dependence or abuse. (Tr. at 45-46.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 2 are as follows:
2.a.  March   2000   Non-Judicial  Punishment   for  testing   positive   for  marijuana.
Applicant was administratively  discharged   from  the  Navy   under Other Than  Honorable
conditions  as   a   result  of   failing   a   drug   test   on   March  2,  2000.  Applicant  admitted   this
allegation. He commented  that he  was 19  years old at the  time  and  was influenced  by  his
friends and  peers. He  regrets the  choices he  made  at that  time.  (Answer at 2, 5; Tr. at  49-
51; GE 6.)
2.b. Applicant used marijuana from 2000 until June 5, 2013. Applicant denied this
allegation on the ground that the June 5, 2013 date is incorrect. That date is his official
“clean date” for abstaining from both illegal drugs and alcohol. His last use of marijuana
was in 2012, the year in which he gained custody of two of his children. The information
in the report of his background interview about drug use until June 2013 is the result of a
misunderstanding by the investigator. That date only applies to his last use of alcohol.
(Answer at 2, 5; Tr. at 50-51; GE 2 at 20, 23.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The  SOR  sets  forth  three  allegations  of  omissions  in  Applicant’s  e-QIP  that
resulted in false answers. The details regarding the SOR falsification allegations set forth
in this paragraph and Applicant’s responses are as follows:
3.a.   Failure  to  disclose  his  use  of  marijuana  in  the  seven  years  preceding  April
2019 in his response to Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs in the e-QIP. Applicant ceased
using marijuana in 2012 when he was granted full physical custody of two of his children.
He understood that responsibility required him to be drug-free. He did not list his last use
of marijuana sometime in 2012 because it was about seven years prior to the date of his
e-QIP  and  disclosure was not required  under the  question’s seven-year time limitation.
He credibly testified that the information in GE 2 regarding drug use until June 5, 2013, is
a misunderstanding. That date only applies to use last use of alcohol. (Tr. at 52-53; GE 2
at 20.)
3.b.  Failure  to  disclose  in  his  response  to  Section  22  - Police  Record  all  of  his
offenses involving alcohol and drug use during the period 2000 to August 2016 and an
alleged felony charge. Applicant was never charged with a felony, so he had nothing to
report in response to the e-QIP question regarding past felony charges. The same is true
with respect to the alleged 2016 DUI. Applicant disclosed his 2010 DUI arrest in response
to  Section  22,  and  in  response  to  Section  24  –  Use  of  Alcohol,  he  disclosed  the  DUI
offenders program he was ordered to take. He failed to respond correctly to a follow-up
question in Section 22 that asks for other instances of certain types of charges including
alcohol and drugs. As a result, he failed to list his 2008 DUI charge and his 2000 NJPs
for  alcohol  intoxication  and  drug  use.  He  failed  to  list  these  incidents  due  to
misunderstanding  the  question  and  acknowledges  that  he  answered  the  question
incorrectly. He said that he filled out the questionnaire, which he described as lengthy,
after  a  long  day  of  work,  and  he  did  not  clearly  understand  the  question.  He  credibly
testified that he had no intention to mislead the Government or to withhold this derogatory
information  from  many  years  ago.  In  his  background  interview,  he  volunteered  the
information regarding 2008 DUI before being confronted. (Tr. at 54-57; GE 1 at 31-32,
33-34; GE 2 at 7, 10.)
3.c. Failure to disclose his delinquent debts incurred in the seven years preceding
April 2019 in his response to Section 26 – Financial Record. Applicant credibly testified
that he failed to disclose his delinquent debts and repossessed vehicle due to oversight.
He acknowledged that he answered the question incorrectly. He said he was not prepared
to respond to these detailed financial questions. He did not have a credit report at the
time  he  prepared  his  responses  to  the  e-QIP  questions,  and  he  mistakenly  did  not
disclose certain debts in response to the questions. He had no intention to mislead the
Government about his debts. In his July 2019 background interview, Applicant discussed
his  debts  at  length  indicating  that  he  had  no  intent  to  shield  information  from  the
Government in his e-QIP. (Tr. at 55, 57-58; GE 2 at 10-18.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
is
financially  overextended  and
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
because  he
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
identifies eight past-due debts that have been referred to collection or charged off. The
debts total about $23,000. In his Answer, Applicant denied all of the allegations under this
guideline, except one (4.b). (Answer at 3-4, 7-8.)
The current status of the allegations in paragraph 4 of the SOR is as follows:
4.a.   Credit  union  account  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $14,888.  This  debt  is  a
vehicle loan account. Applicant defaulted on paying the monthly loan payments in 2016
during  a  period  of  unemployment  from  August  2016  to  September  2017..  In  2020  he
entered into a payment plan agreement with the creditor and has been paying this account
monthly.  GE  3  and  4  confirm  that  Applicant  is  “paying  under  a  partial  payment
agreement.” This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 59-60; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4.)
4.b. Credit account in collection in the approximate amount of $1,263.  Applicant
paid this debt after his July 2019 background interview, possibly in 2020. He does not
have  a  receipt.  The  account  does  not  appear  on  the  most  recent  credit  report  in  the
record, dated March 31, 2022. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 60-61; GE 3; GE 4 at 2; GE
5 at 6.)
4.c. Credit account in collection in the approximate amount of $878. The original
creditor on this account is the same creditor as the one listed in 4.b, above. Applicant
testified that he only had one account with this creditor. In 2021 he disputed this debt with
the  credit  bureaus.  He  believes  his  dispute  is  still  under  investigation.  He  provided  no
evidence regarding the dispute. The credit reports in the record do not reflect that this
debt is disputed. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 61-62; GE 4 at 2.)
4.d.   Collection  account  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $593.  This  account  was
originally a credit-card account. Applicant paid this debt in May 2021. He provided proof
of payment of the debt. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 62-63; GE 4 at 2-3; GE 5 at
12; AE C.)
4.e. Payday loan account in collection in the approximate amount of  $315.  This
account became delinquent after Applicant prepared his e-QIP. Applicant paid this debt
in late 2020 or early 2021. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 63; GE 2 at 11; GE 4 at
3; GE 5 at 12.)
4.f. Credit union account in collection in the approximate amount of $815. Applicant
defaulted  on  paying  this  credit-card  account  in  late  2016  or  early  2017  when  he  was
unemployed. Applicant settled this debt for less than the full balance, as evidenced by a
credit report in the record, dated January 5, 2021 (GE 4). The settlement was paid in June
2020. Applicant provided proof of the resolution of this debt. This debt has been resolved.
(Tr. at 63; GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 5; AE B.)
4.g.  Collection account in the approximate amount of $4,516. Applicant disputed
this  account  in  about  April  2021  because  he  does  not  know  what  it  is.  The  dispute  is
confirmed  by  the  Government’s  March  31,  2022  credit  report  in  the  record  (GE  3).
Applicant called the original creditor identified in his credit report (Creditor A) and learned
that it is an online lender. He claimed that he has never taken out a loan from Creditor A.
His dispute has not been resolved. In his background interview, Applicant admitted that
he   received   a   loan   in   the   amount   of  $3,000   from   Creditor  A   in   May   2016   and   that  he
became  delinquent  on  the  loan  in  August  2016  due  to  limited  financial resources during
periods  of   unemployment.   Government   Exhibit  5   confirms  Applicant’s  loan   for  $3,000
from  Creditor A  and  the  dates  he  provided  to  the  investigator. This  debt  is  unresolved.
(Tr. at  64; GE 2 at 16; GE 3  at 5; GE 5  at 4.)
4.h.   Medical  account  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $294.  Applicant  does  not
recognize  this  debt.  He  insists  that  in  2019  and  2020  he  had  a  state-funded  medical
insurance policy for low-income families that has no co-pays. The date on which Applicant
became delinquent on this account is not apparent in the Government’s credit reports and
it  only  appears  on  the  oldest  report,  dated  May  11,  2019.  Applicant  has  reviewed  his
recent credit report and this debt does not appear on it. He has not taken any action to
dispute this debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 64; GE 2 at 11; GE 5 at 12.)
Mitigation
Applicant  summarized  his  life’s  journey  in  a  brief  statement  (AE  K).  He
acknowledged his history of misconduct when he was young and irresponsible. He also
admitted that  he  has a  history of  losing jobs  and encountering financial  difficulties.  He
wrote that he began to change his ways when he was granted full physical custody of two
of his children in 2012. In that year he stopped using illegal drugs, i.e., marijuana. In 2013
he ceased drinking alcohol so that he could become a better father. He joined a church
that has become central to his life along with his family. Now he is married at age 41. He
works on improving his character and being a better husband and father. He has been an
active participant in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) for over 8 years and has worked all of the
steps. He has been sober since June 2013. He has a support group as part of NA that is
important  to  him.  His  most  important  supporter  is  his  wife.  He  has  made  a  serious
commitment to himself and his family to provide his children with a better life. His children
have successfully developed into responsible individuals. His oldest is attending college
studying civil engineering, and the younger ones are excelling as well. (Tr. at 48, AE K.)
Applicant provided character letters from  senior managers, supervisors, and co-
workers at his place of employment and from his church pastor and assistant pastor. They
all describe Applicant in glowing terms and remark how he matured and devoted himself
to his wife and family and to his church. His pastor wrote that Applicant has “completely
turn[ed]  his  life  around”  and  has  “grown  emotionally,  mentally  and  spiritually.”  The
church’s assistant pastor commented that Applicant takes “full responsibility for his past”
and now is one of the pastors “must trusted and faithful friends.” At work, he is described
as “dedicated, hardworking, and possess[ing] a can do spirit.” He is praised for his work
ethic, reliability, honesty, integrity, and positive attitude, as well as his professionalism.

"Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  is  unmarried  with  no  children.  He  has  a  high
school  diploma  and  a  few  college  credits.  He  holds  the  position  of  Help  Desk
Administrator.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.
After  graduating  from  high  school,  Applicant  joined  the  U.S  Army  for  an  eight
year  commitment,  from  July  2009  to  February  2015,  six  years  of  active  duty  service,
and then from February 2015 to May 2017, two years of reserve duty.  On active duty,
Applicant  underwent  a  number  of  urinalysis,  and  understood  military  rules  and
regulations  that  strictly  prohibit  the  use  of  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  held  a  security
clearance throughout his military career.
At  the  end  of  his  six-year  active  duty service,  Applicant  was  required  to finalize
his  paperwork  and  met  with  a  recruiter  to  get  his  orders  to  go  into  the  reserves.
Applicant does not know if he signed the wrong paperwork, or if the recruiter explained
something  incorrectly  to  him,  but  apparently,  Applicant  signed  a  new  reserve  contract
for eight years without realizing it.
Applicant  testified  that  during  the  entire  two  years  he  spent  in  the  reserves  he
repeatedly asked his command if he could be released  after completing his two years,
and was denied.  Applicant did not like the reserves, as it was not a good fit for him.  He
was  told  by  his  Commander  and  Sergeant  that  since  he  signed  the  contract  he  was
obligated to complete it regardless of his personal circumstances.
At this point, Applicant decided that the most expedient way to break his contract
and be released from the Army was to use marijuana.  Applicant purchased marijuana
and used it on three separate occasions between March 2017 and May 2017, before a
drill  weekend  knowing  that  he  was  subject  to  a  urinalysis  that  it  would  come  back
positive.  After  the  first  positive  urinalysis,  Applicant  was  counseled  and  received  an
Article  15.  After failing  two  more  drug  tests,  Applicant  was  administratively  separated
from  the  U.S.  Army  in  May  2017.  Applicant  received  a  general  discharge  under
honorable conditions for testing positive for  tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as
marijuana.
Applicant  knew  that  he  would  be  released  from  the  military  and  his  security
clearance would be revoked for using marijuana.  However, he did not consider future
consequences.  Applicant stated that he has not used marijuana since May 2017, and
he  has  no  intentions  of  ever using it  again.  Applicant  states  that he  did not enjoy the
use  of  marijuana  and  had  never  used  it  before  this  situation.  He  understands  that
although marijuana is legal in some states, it is prohibited and illegal while employed for
the DoD and while possessing a security clearance.
Applicant’s  direct  supervisor  testified  that  Applicant  is  a  good  performer  on  the
job  and  has  learned  quickly.  She  states  that  for  the  most  part  Applicant  has  been
reliable.  Applicant has had a problem being on time to work.  Applicant told her that he
is not a morning person.  Before getting Human Resources involved, she discussed the
problem  with  him.  After  Human  Resources  was  made  aware  of  the  problem,  and
Applicant received a written warning, the problem has improved.  (Tr. pp. 49-50.)
Applicant’s  father,  who  is  retired  Air  Force,  after  26  years,  testified  that  his  son
has changed since his time in the reserves.  Since April 2018, Applicant has been living
with his parents, and working on improving himself.  He got a job and has passed their
drug tests.  He is taking care of his health and doing everything that he was told to do
by his family and his employer.  His father considers him to be an outstanding person
now.  (Tr. p. 16.)
Applicant  states  that  he  now  knows  that  he  made  a  bad  decision  to  use
marijuana.

single  and  has  two  children.  She  is  a  high  school  graduate.  She  is  seeking  to  obtain
national security eligibility in connection with her work with DoD.
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  she  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
1.a. Applicant admitted using marijuana from about 2007 through September 2017.
She  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequencies  during  that  time,  at  one  point  using
marijuana three times a week (2013-2015). She stated that the use was encouraged by
her then-boyfriend, who was an avid marijuana user. In her Answer she stated, “I am no
longer involved with those persons and have since stopped using marijuana and started
focusing on my career and my children.” (Item 2 at 3.)
In Applicant Exhibit A she further stated, “During the time that I was engaging in
questionable activities, I was in a dark place in my life. I was around people who were not
good  influences  and  I  was  in  a  toxic  and  abusive  relationship.  Since  leaving  that
relationship, I have cut ties with all of those people and no longer associate with anyone
from that part of my life.”
1.b.  Applicant  admitted   that  she   tested   positive   for  marijuana   in  January   2015
during  a  drug  test administered  by  her then-employer (Company  One). This incident  is
further discussed under subparagraphs 2.a  and  2.b, below.
Applicant stated  in  Applicant Exhibit A,  “Please  note  that in September of 2020, a
new  company  took  over my  contract.  As  a  part  of  their  company  policy, I  was administered
an  initial  drug  test,  which I passed  and  am  subject  to  random  testing  at any  time.”  She
included   a  copy   of  her   employer’s Drug/Alcohol Workplace  Policy   as an  attachment to
Applicant Exhibit A.
Paragraph 2  (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  she has  engaged  in  conduct  that  shows  poor judgment, untrustworthiness  or
unreliability.  She  admitted  allegations  2.a  through  2.e  under  this  paragraph  with
explanations.
2.a. Applicant admitted  that she  was involuntarily  separated  from  Company  One
as a result of the positive drug test set forth under subparagraph 1.a, above.
2.b   Applicant  filled   out  an   e-QIP   in  April  2019.  (Item   3.)  Section   13A   of   the
questionnaire   asked   Applicant  about  her  employment   history,  including   with   Company
One.  She  admitted  working  there  from  January  2013  to  February  2015.  She  stated  that
the reason  for leaving the company was, “Acquired new employment.”
The   questionnaire   also   asked   Applicant  whether   during   her  employment  with
Company   One   “any   of  the   following   happened   to   you  in  the   last  seven  (7)  years?
Fired/Quit  after being  told you  would be  fired/Left  by  mutual  agreement  following  charges
or allegations of misconduct/Left  by  mutual agreement following  notice of  unsatisfactory
performance.”  (Emphasis  in  original)   Applicant   answered,  “No.”  These   were  false
answers to relevant questions about Applicant’s prior employment history  with Company
One.
Applicant stated in Item 2 at 3:
I was being  drug  tested  for a  new  position  in the  company  [Company  One].
I was aware that I would not  pass the  test  so  while  waiting  for the  results I
found   employment  elsewhere.  After  being   informed   of   the   results   by   the
company that conducted the  test, I informed  my manager at the time of the
results and  he  informed  my  district manager who  happened  to  be  visiting
the store that day. I was effectively sent home that afternoon  and was later
contacted  by  HR  for the  company. By  that point,  I had  a  tentative  start date
for my new employer and did not return their  call.
2.c.   Section   23   of   the   same   questionnaire   asked   Applicant  about   her   drug   use
history. Specifically, Applicant  was asked  whether  she  had  used  controlled  substances
during  the  previous seven  years. Applicant  stated, “No.” This statement was false in  that
Applicant had  actually  used  marijuana  between 2007 and 2017, as  set forth above.
2.d. Applicant was interviewed  on  July  17, 2019, by  an  authorized  investigator for
the  Department of  Defense. (Item  4.) During that interview  Applicant stated  that she  had
left her employment with  Company  One  because  the  daily  commute  was too  long  for her.
Applicant  was  re-interviewed  on  August  5,  2019.  She  initially  restated  that  she
voluntarily left that employment. It was only after being confronted by the investigator with
the facts of her positive drug test that she admitted being sent home after she told her
manager of the positive drug test.
The Report of Investigation also stated:
Subject  [Applicant]  stated  that she  did not list this information  in her case
papers  or  bring   it  up   during   her  interview   because   she   did  not  view   her
separation  from  [Company  One] as a  termination. Subject stated  that she
was  never  told  she   was  terminated   and   never  signed   any   paperwork
showing   she   had   been   terminated.  Subject   viewed   her  separation   from
[Company  One] as  her leaving  for another employment  opportunity. Subject
claimed  that she  was not attempting  to  conceal or falsify  this  information  in
any way. (Item 4 at 4-5.)
2.e.  During  the  same  July  17, 2019  interview  Applicant verified  that her answers
on  the  April 17, 2019  e-QIP  to  questions concerning  drug  use  were correct.  She  was re-
interviewed   on   August  5,  2019.  When   confronted   concerning   her  drug   use   history
Applicant admitted  making  a  false  statement in  the  earlier interview  “due  to  believing  that
a  positive  response  to  drug  questions could hurt her possibility  of gaining  employment.”
(Item  4 at 5.)
Regarding  all  the  falsification  allegations Applicant stated, “I admit that I did falsify
material facts on  my  e-QIP  and  during  my  interview  regarding  my drug  use. I was afraid
that admission of these facts  would hinder my  chances of getting  the  job,  which I greatly
needed,” (Item 2  at 3.)
Applicant stated  the  following  in Applicant Exhibit A. “Working  with  the  military  has
given me a  new perspective of the  terms “Honor, Courage and Commitment” and what it
means to  serve  our nation. I now  know  that honor means being  held  accountable for my
personal behavior and,  taking  responsibility  for my  actions and  being  honest and  truthful.”

December 2018 to about November 2019.
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying frequency from about
December 2018 to about November 2019, while granted access to classified information.
In   June   2008,  the   DOD  granted,  and   in  February   2014,  the   DOD  renewed
Applicant’s   security   clearance.  (Tr.   21-22)   From   December   2018   to   about  November

(Tr.  19;  GE   1)  He  did   not  have   access   to   classified   information   when   he   was  using
marijuana. (Tr. 31) He  did not use  marijuana  on  business trips or in the  workplace. (Tr.

Applicant’s  November  12,  2019  SCA  asked  about  use  of  illegal  drugs  in  the
previous  seven  years.  (Tr.  22;  GE  1)  Applicant  voluntarily  responded  that  he  used
marijuana  from  December  2018  to  November  2019.  (Tr.  23;  GE  1)  He  explained,
“Seldom, recreational use outside of  work, primarily on  weekends.” (GE 1  at 35) As for
plans of future marijuana use, he said “I do not intend to keep using now that I am actively
on a government contract again and it really doesn’t do much for me.” (Id.) In his February
25, 2020 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, he said he used marijuana
about 20 times during this period. (GE 4 at 2) He used marijuana because he was curious
about  how  it  would  affect  him.  (Id.)  He  does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future
because of his employment. (Id.)
At his hearing, Applicant said he probably used marijuana less than 20 times. (Tr.

"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 3.a and 4.a. She
denied the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.b. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of
fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 25 years old. She graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree in
December 2019. She then pursued and completed a professional certificate in 2021 and
was accepted into a master’s program, which began in August 2022. She married in 2022
and  has  no  children.  She  began  college  in 2015.  In about  May 2017,  she moved  to a
different state and transferred to a local college in her new state. She also worked part-
time as an intern for her present employer, a federal contractor, until she graduated from
college in December 2019. After graduation, she was offered a full-time position by her
present employer and has worked for them since January 2020. (Tr. 23-29; GE 1; AE F,
J, L, M, N)
From approximately September 2015 to May 2017, Applicant used marijuana with
varying frequency. She was 18 to 20 years old at the time. She smoked marijuana with
friends. She stopped using marijuana when she moved to the new state and distanced
herself from the friends with whom she was using it. She credibly testified that she has
not used marijuana or any other illegal drug since May 2017 and does not intend to do so
in the future. When she got married, her wedding was in the state where she previously
lived, and none of her former friends were invited to her wedding. Her husband does not
use  illegal  drugs.  She  provided  a  hair  follicle  drug  analysis  from  June  29,  2022,  with
negative results for illegal drugs. (Tr. 42-47; AE O)
In August 2016, Applicant was in a car with friends when it was stopped by the
police. Marijuana was found in the car. Applicant testified it did not belong to her. She and
the other occupants were arrested. She was charged with possession of marijuana with
the intent to use. She stated she was confused about the arrest and that is why she denied
SOR ¶ 1.b. She said when she went to court a couple of days after the incident, she was
told the charges were dismissed. She did not go before a judge or meet with anyone from
the prosecutor’s office. Her FBI record shows the charge was dismissed. She requested
this charge be expunged from her record and it was so ordered by the court in October
2021. (Tr. 47-48, 70-72; GE 3, AE P)
In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR  she  explained  that in February  2017,  she  was
attending   college   at  X   University   (XU)  in  her  home   state.  In   her  first  semester  of   her
sophomore year, she  received  a  D in  a  course. She  felt  she  deserved  a  better grade. She
had   to   retake   the   class  in  the   spring   semester  and   felt   the   situation   was  unfair,  which
caused  her not to  take  the  course  seriously. On  her first test,  she  received  a  failing  grade.
She  tried  to  make  up  for it, but  received  a  failing  grade  on  her second  exam. She  knew
even  if  she  scored  100% on  her final exam,  she  would still  fail  the  course.  At the  time,
she  was working  part  time  in  the  Office  of  Information  Technology  (OIT) at XU. She  stated
that  before considering  the  ramifications  and  consequences  of her actions,  she  thought
she   could   use   her access  in   the   OIT  to   change   her   grade,   which  she  did.   In   her   SOR
answer, she  said she  then  felt guilty  and  an  hour later she  emailed  her professor telling
her that Applicant’s grade  was incorrectly  put in the  system. Her  professor thanked  her
and corrected  the  grade. She  did not tell  the  professor that it was her who  changed  the
grade. Two  days later,  she  was summoned  to  the  OIT  by  managers who  confronted  her
with  what she  had  done. They  reported  her conduct to  XU and  the  police. She  said  in her
SOR  answer  that  she   was  unaware  that  her  conduct   could   lead   to   serious  criminal
allegations.  She  attributed  her  actions to  being  immature  and  she  had  no  excuse. (Tr. 48-
49, 73-79; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  testified  about  the  specifics  of  her  actions.  She  gained  access  to  the
professor’s  portal and  changed the password  on  the professor’s  account so she could
change the grade. The professor was notified that her password changed and notified the
OIT  asking  why  it  had  changed.  When  the  OIT  became  aware,  they  investigated  the
action,  which  was  traced  back  to  Applicant’s  computer and  the  time  she  was  working.
Applicant testified she was aware of the rules and protocol of working in the OIT and her
conduct  was  a  violation.  When  Applicant  was  confronted  by  the  manager  of  the  OIT
regarding changing the password, she initially denied it and did not take responsibility for
her conduct. She also denied it to the XU conduct board. At her hearing, she testified that
XU  conducted  an  investigation  and  she  was  suspended from  school  at  the  end  of  the
semester for six months. She received an F in the course. She was permitted to complete
her other courses before the suspension. She said she was humiliated and embarrassed.
(Tr. 48-49, 73-79)
In March 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with accessing, falsifying or
tampering with data or computer records, a felony, for her actions at XU. She did not tell
her parents until months later. A public defender represented her. The prosecutor agreed
to  accept  a  Pretrial  Intervention  (PTI)  program,  which  lasted  30  months.  She  was  on
probation  and  had  to  contact  her  probation  officer,  participate  in  drug  testing,  and  not
commit any offenses. She was able to move to a new state while still on probation, but
had to continue to contact her probation officer and was required to notify the probation
officer if she got into any trouble. (Tr. 50-53, 79-84)
In June 2018, while still participating in the PTI and working as an intern with her
employer, Applicant was arrested for shoplifting. She admits her conduct was selfish and
lacked good judgment. She walked into a department store, grabbed four purses, put a
small one in her purse, put another over her shoulder, tried to hide one and said the other
she did not try to hide. A security guard stopped her, checked the tags on the purses and
the police were called. She was arrested and taken to jail. She called her boyfriend, who
later would be her husband. He was upset. She called a bail bondsman, paid the bond,
and was released. She testified that she immediately contacted her probation officer and
told the officer of her arrest. When she returned to court for the charge, the official from
the store failed to appear and the charge was dismissed. She testified that she thought
she got away with it and did it again as noted below. (Tr. 52, 84-89)
In October 2018, Applicant was arrested again for shoplifting. She went into a large
retail store, put items in her cart and went through the self-checkout aisle. She purchased
the items and grabbed extra plastic shopping bags. After completing her purchase and
before leaving the store, she went back through the store and filled the bags with items.
She  then  left  the  store  with  items  she  stole  and  drove  away.  She  was  subsequently
stopped by the police and was arrested. She testified she did this one other time at the
same store about a month earlier and got away with it. She also did it once when she was
in high school, got caught, but she was not arrested and was released by the store.1 (Tr.
55, 89-92)
Applicant testified that she reported the second shoplifting incident to her probation
officer.  She  admitted  that  after  her first  shoplifting arrest,  she felt  she  got  away  with  it
without  consequences  after  the  charge  was  dropped.  In  her  answer  to  the  SOR,  she
stated that when she went to court for the October 2018 offense, she asked the judge if
there  was  a  diversion  program  she  could  participate  in  that  would  help  her  with  her
“kleptomania-like  tendencies”:  She  entered  a  Pretrial  Diversion  (PTD)  program  that
included classes focused on shoplifting.  She said it changed her life and forced her to
think about why she was doing destructive things and how her actions impacted other’s
lives and property. She completed the program in December 2018 and the charge was
dismissed. (Tr. 55-57, 92-93; AE R)
Applicant testified that as part of the PTD program it was recommended that she
seek  therapy,  which  she  did  through  her  college  counseling  services.  She  said  she
attended therapy about once a month for about a year. Discussions were about why she
was struggling, adjusting to a new area, family expectations, and feelings of entitlement.
(Tr. 107-114)
Applicant  completed  the  PTI  program  in  November 2019  and  the  felony charge
was dismissed. In October 2021, this charge was expunged under the same order as her
2016 drug arrest. (Tr. 54-55; AE P, Q)
Applicant did not report her criminal conduct of misusing information technology or
that she was participating in a PTI program to her employer while she was an intern. This
offense occurred before she was hired as an intern. She did not report to her employer
her shoplifting arrests in June 2018 and October 2018 or that she was participating in a

whole-person  analysis.
PTD program. She did not believe she was obligated to report her criminal arrests as an
intern and because she was not a full-time employee. She testified that her boyfriend at
the time, now her husband, did review the rules to see if he was obligated to report the
information  and  he  was  not.  He  did  not  counsel  her  to  report  the  information  to  their
employer.  She  testified  that  she  considered  reporting  it,  but  did  not  want  to  risk  an
opportunity to be hired full time. She testified that she has not been involved in any other
authorized computer access since her incident at XU. (Tr. 57-59, 94-98, 106-107)
Applicant provided a document to show that the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS)  gave  her  a  fitness/suitability  determination  where  she  has  access  to  a  level  of
sensitive information. She testified she had to complete an Electronic Questionnaires for
Investigation Processing in 2021. She said she disclosed her criminal arrests. (Tr. 31-32,
5998-100; AE E)
Applicant provided numerous documents reflecting her exceptional performance
while  working  for  her  employer.  She  received  17  awards  since  October  2019  and  her
year-end  reviews  from  2020  and  2021  also  reflect  her  outstanding  performance  and
contribution to the company and its mission. (Tr. 30-35; AE F, G, H, I)
Applicant provided a letter of recommendation from Dr. W from July 2021, that was
submitted  for  Applicant’s  application  for  enrollment  into  the  professional  certificate
program, which she completed. She also provided a letter of recommendation from him
for  a  security  clearance.  The  letter  glowingly  describes  Applicant’s  academic  abilities,
motivation, and personal qualities. She is described as a self-starter, a team player, and
a  problem-solver.  She  is  considered  tenacious,  hardworking,  and  dedicated.  Dr.  W
described Applicant as having a solid work ethic, moral character, and is pleasant and
confident.  He  considers  her  honest  and  has  never  questioned  her  loyalty.  She  is  the
epitome of professionalism, intelligence, integrity and dedication. He recommended her
for a security clearance. Applicant testified that Dr. W was not made aware of the SOR
allegations or her criminal charges. (Tr. 38-40; AE B, K)
Applicant provided a July 2021 character letter from her direct supervisor at work
who has known her for four years. He indicated  in his letter that he  was aware of  “her
need for a security clearance.” He has had regular interaction with her since 2018 and
frequently on a daily basis. He described her as being a diligent worker with a strong work
ethic  and  uncompromised  integrity.  She  sets  the  example  for  her  peers  in  terms  of
dedication, trustworthiness, reliability, and stability. She received 10 performance awards
from  2020  to  2021,  which  is  unmatched  by  her  peers.  Applicant  testified  that  her
supervisor was not privy to the allegations in the SOR or her background, and he is only
aware of her work history. (Tr. 35-38; AE A)
Applicant  provided  a  recommendation  for  promotion  from  Dr.  D.  It  states  that
Applicant executes high quality technical work, engages in leadership behavior, supports
and  monitors  the  team.  She  motivates  others.  Dr.  D  also  described  different  technical
accomplishments of Applicant and recommended her for promotion. (Tr. 40-42; AE C)
Applicant’s husband provided a statement on behalf of her. He has known his wife
since  2017.  He  works  for  the  same  company.  He  describes  her  as  one  of  the  most
honorable  and  hardworking  individuals  he  has  ever  known.  He  was  aware  of  some
mistakes she made and that she exercised poor judgment when she was younger. He is
aware of mistakes she made in 2018. He stated she can be trusted. If he did not believe
that she could be trusted, he would not be married to her. He would not jeopardize the
security clearance he holds. She volunteers for difficult tasks and rises to the occasion.
She is a valuable asset to the company. (Tr. 63-67; AE D)
Applicant provided a copy of her credit report that reflects she pays her bills and
has no financial issues. She purchased a vehicle in 2019 and paid the loan in 2020. She
was responsible for paying her tuition and her father helped her with half of it. She worked
and went to school at the same time and was responsible for her monthly expenses. (Tr.
60-62; AE S, T)
Applicant stated  in  her  Answer to  the  SOR  and  testimony  that  she  has received
accolades for her outstanding  performance  and  awards that  were provided  as exhibits.
She  works on  important projects that impact the  public interest. She  volunteers her time
for students  in the  science, technology, engineering  and  mathematics (STEM) curriculum
for grades kindergarten  through  12th  grade  as a  mentor and  judge  in  competitions. She
also  mentored   an   all-girls  robotics  team.  She   volunteers  at  work  and   participates  in
different teams that help others. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant provided a lengthy and detailed Answer to the SOR. In it, she repeatedly
takes full responsibility for her conduct and makes no excuses. When testifying she did
the  same  and  was  candid.  She  attributed  her  drug  involvement  with  being  around  the
wrong people and has put that in her past. She says she has turned her life around. The
PTD class forced her to reflect on her life and she saw people like her who were also
struggling with their choices. She found it beneficial and it was an epiphany in her life.
She attributes her criminal conduct to being young, immature, and selfish. She says she
is no longer that person, and she has learned her lessons and grown from her mistakes.
She is thankful that the system gave her a second chance to restart her life.

"In  her  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations,  except  the
allegations  concerning  her  future  intent  to  use  drugs  (¶¶  1.f  and  1.g).  No  further
information  was  provided  with  her  answer.  Her  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  38  years  old.  She  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  2004.  She  is
employed  as  an  engineering  technician  for  a  defense  contractor.  She  has  worked  for
this employer since 2004 and has held a secret clearance since March 2010. She was
married  in  2005  and  divorced  in  2013.  She has  two  children;  one  is  an  adult,  and  the
other a minor. (Item 3)
In February 2020, a Government investigator conducted a background interview
with Applicant. In response to an interrogatory, she verified the accuracy of the report of
this interview. On the signature block of her interrogatory response,  the year printed is
2020,  which  is  an  administrative  error,  because  her  interrogatory  response  would
predate the interview. The correct year of this response is 2021. (Item 4)
In her background interview, Applicant disclosed to the investigator that she had
used  marijuana  from  2001  to  November  2016.  Between  2010–2016,  she  had  been
using  marijuana  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.  She  reported  that  until
2013, she had used marijuana recreationally on most weekends. After her divorce, she
was using it every day after work and on weekends. This continued until 2016. (Item 3,
4)
In her background interview, Applicant also disclosed that she had used ecstasy,
mushrooms  (psilocybin),  and  cocaine  in  the  last  seven  years.  She  reported  that  she
used mushrooms once in about 2016, because she had never tried it.  She stated that
she  had  used  ecstasy  on  about  twelve  occasions,  from  about  2016  to  2019,  while
attending festivals or concerts. Her most recent use was in December 2019, which was
the month after she submitted her most recent SCA. She stated that she used ecstasy
after a period of abstinence from substance abuse, because she wanted to see what it
would  feel  like  after being  sober for  a  long  time.  She  admitted  in her  answer  that  she
used ecstasy while granted access to classified information. (Item 4)
Applicant admitted to the investigator that she had first tried cocaine in November
2013,  while  at  a  party.  She  continued  to  use  it  about  six  more  times  over  the  next
month. After then, she used cocaine most weekends until her driving while intoxicated
(DWI)  arrest  in  November  2016.  She  last  used  cocaine  in  December  2019.  She
admitted  in  her  answer  that  she  used  cocaine  while  granted  access  to  classified
information. (Item 4)
In her background interview,  Applicant was asked about her intent to use drugs
in  the  future.  She  claimed  that  she  does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  because  it  is
expensive and smelly. She admitted that she would do ecstasy again if it was given to
her, because  it is enjoyable for concerts or festivals.  She stated that  she  will probably
use  ecstasy  about  once  a  year  from  now  on.  She  also  admitted  that  if  cocaine  is
available,  she  will  use  it  a  couple  of  times  a  month.  She  has  friends  that  provide  it  to
her.  She  claimed  that  she  could  abstain  from  drugs  if  it  threatened  her  job,  and  has
been  able  to  abstain  in  the  past  because  she  avoided  her  friends.  She  denied  future
intent to use drugs in her answer. (Item 4)
Applicant  failed  to  report  any  drug  use  or  drug  use  while  possessing  a  security
clearance  on  her  SCA.  When  asked  about  her  omissions  by  an  investigator,  she
claimed  that  she  was  only  thinking  of  her  three  years  of  sobriety,  and  that  she  must
have mismarked the form. She also stated that she did not know why she answered the
question in that way. (Item 3, 4)
In  November 2016, Applicant was  arrested for DWI. When she was  pulled over
by police at about 4 AM,  her blood alcohol content (BAC) was almost double the legal
limit  of  intoxication.  She  was  arrested,  and  pled  guilty  to  fourth  degree  driving  while
impaired.  In  March  2017,  she  was  sentenced  to  two  years  of  probation,  a  45  day
suspended  jail  sentence,  a  fine,  and  attendance  at  state  mandated  DWI  offender
classes. (Item 3, 4, 5)
After  her  DWI  conviction,  Applicant  attended  an  outpatient  substance  abuse
program.  She  reported  on  her  SCA  that  she  attended  from  March  2017  to  October
2017.  She  verified  this  information  in  her  background  interview.  SOR  ¶  2.c  listed  the
year she attended this program as 2016, which appears to be an administrative error. In
this  program,  she  attended  individual  therapy  and  group  therapy  once  a  week.  In  her
answer,  she  admitted  being  diagnosed  with  alcohol  use  disorder,  cannabis  use
disorder, and cocaine use disorder. (Item 3, 4)
Applicant reported that her drinking became a problem after her divorce in 2013.
Until  her  DWI  arrest,  she  was  binge  drinking  on  weekends.  After  attending  the
substance abuse program  in 2017, she was sober for two and a half  years.  In August
2020, she had a drink at a wedding, and decided to start drinking again on weekends.
She claimed that she is not binge drinking anymore, and limits herself to three shots per
weekend night or special occasion. She asserted that she has not abused alcohol since
completing the substance abuse program in 2017. She stated that she intends to keep
drinking because all her friends do it,  and  she  does not want  to be  excluded from  her
friends. She claimed that she will able to drink in moderation. (Item 4)
In  her  FORM response,  Applicant stated  that  she  was  sorry and  ashamed, and
has been grateful for the privilege to hold a clearance for 12 years. She stated that she
regrets  her  offending  behavior  and  understands  the  damage  that  drugs  can  do.  She
asserted  that  she  has  worked  for  her  employer  for  over  17  years,  and  has  been
mentoring and leading her co-workers for ten years. She stated that she has a history of
anxiety  and  depression,  and  had  planned  to  seek  help  to  continue  to  address  her
mental  health  issues,  and  has  been  spiritually  practicing  and  seeking  guidance.

"In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the  SOR allegations  in ¶¶  1.a  through
1.d.   (HE  3)   He  also  provided   mitigating   information.   His  admissions   are   accepted   as
findings  of  fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a 54-year-old senior research scientist and technical lead for a highly
technical facility. (Tr. 8-9, 19) A DOD contractor has employed him for about 30 months
(since October 2019). (Tr. 7-8, 29) In 1985, he graduated from high school, and in 1989,
he received an associate’s degree. (Tr. 7, 22) In 1991, he received a bachelor’s degree
with a major in mechanical engineering, and in 1998, he received a master of  science
degree. (Tr. 7-8, 23) He has not served in the military. (Tr. 7, 24) In 2001, he married, and
he separated from his spouse about eight months before his hearing. (Tr. 20) His three
children are ages 15, 17, and 19. (Tr. 9, 20-21)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used marijuana with  varying frequency from about
2018 to about June 2020. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant purchased marijuana from about
2018 to about June 2020. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant used and purchased marijuana
with varying frequency from about March 2020 to about June 2020, while granted access
to  classified  information.  SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  Applicant  intends  to  use  marijuana  in  the
future. In his SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations, except he clarified
that he has not had access to classified information. (HE 3)
Applicant was diagnosed with a serious stomach-related disease in his mid-20s.
(Tr.  30-31)  He  tried  a  variety  of  drugs  and  therapies  over  the  years.  (Tr.  31)  He  uses
marijuana because he believes it is effective in the treatment of his symptoms. (Tr. 36)
He used marijuana two or three times a day. (Tr. 36) He used marijuana about three hours
before his hearing. (Tr. 36)
Applicant disclosed on his January 27, 2020  SCA that  he  has  “been prescribed
medical marijuana for a stomach condition for approximately two years.” (GE 1 at 31) He
fully  described  his  marijuana  use  during  his  June  11,  2020  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) personal subject interview. (GE 2) For the past three years, he has
had  a  state  medical  marijuana  card  which  enables  him  to  purchase  marijuana  legally
under state law. (Tr. 37) He knew federal law prohibited marijuana possession and use.
(Tr. 34) On March 31, 2020, he received an interim Secret clearance. (Tr. 35)  He has
never had access to classified information. (Tr. 36, 41) He would be much more effective
in his position if he was authorized to have access to classified information. (Tr. 39-40)
His friends, family, and supervisor are aware of his marijuana use. (Tr. 38; AE A-AE D)
He would leave his employment before he would end his marijuana use. (Tr. 38)
In his written closing comments, Applicant said in part:
Currently, 40 of the 50 states in the U.S. allow for medical marijuana. If the
Federal law is supposed to reflect the will of the majority of the people, 40
of the 50 states is an overwhelming majority and the federal law simply has
not kept up.
My use of medical marijuana does not result in being impaired and does not
adversely  affect  my  judgment.  To  the  contrary,  I  believe  I  have  an
established record of doing the right thing and this is reflected in the four
character  reference  letters  attached  to  this  correspondence.  Additionally,
while maintaining a clearance was a requirement for my position . . . , the
requirement has been waived for me [by my employer]. I believe this is in
large part because I have been forthcoming and transparent from the very
beginning - when I believed my job was on the line – again keeping with my
track record of doing the right thing.
In conclusion, I can see no evidence of my conduct that casts doubt on my
reliability, trustworthiness or good judgement. Additionally, although my job
is not in jeopardy as a result of the outcome of this hearing, my not having
a clearance would be a roadblock that would require significant workaround
and  undoubtedly delay the  time  it  will take  to  [accomplish  his employer’s
objectives].  With  this  in  mind,  it  is  obvious  that  allowing  me  to  keep  my
security clearance is clearly consistent with the interest of national security.

Character Evidence
Four friends and coworkers who have known Applicant for several years praised
his good character and contributions to the national defense. (AE A-AE D) The general
sense  of  their  statements  is  that  he  is  an  exceptionally  intelligent,  diligent,  skilled,
talented,  driven,  trustworthy,  and  professional  employee.  He  has  an  important  patent;
however, his current employer is not involved in using the patent. (AE F) His character
evidence provides important support for his access to classified information.

"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR in his November 2020 answer
to the SOR. In his supplemental answer to the SOR, he admitted ¶¶ 1a, 1.b, 1.c, and 2.a.
He denied SOR ¶ 1.d based on dates alleged. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old. He married in 2015 and has four children under the age
of five years. He earned a bachelor’s  degree in 2007 and master’s degree  in 2015. He
has worked for federal contractors since approximately 2011 and his present employer
since 2019. He has held a security clearance since approximately 2011. (Tr. 15-22; GE
1; AE B, D, E)
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from February 2004 to April 2017.
He  testified  that from  2004  to  2006,  while  in  college,  he  used  marijuana  less  than  ten
times. He used marijuana once in June 2009, while on a camping trip. He did not use
marijuana from June 2009 to June 2016. He illegally purchased marijuana one time in
2016. He cooked this marijuana in brownies to eat. He used marijuana from June 2016
to  February  2017,  about  five  to  seven  times,  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  His
explanation for using it was he was dealing with anxiety, sleep issues, and a back injury.
His doctor had prescribed medication, but he did not like taking the drugs because they
made him groggy. He used marijuana as a muscle relaxer. He now infrequently takes a
prescribed medication for stress, anxiety, and sleep issues that has minimal side effects.
He testified the last time he used marijuana was February 2017. (Answer to SOR; GE 4;
Tr. 23-30)
Applicant used  the  prescription  drugs Adderall and  Ritalin  from  May  2012  to  2019.
These  drugs were not prescribed  to  him. He got the  drugs from  a  friend. He was unaware
this was inappropriate  and  was not overly  concerned  using  these  drugs. He swapped  his
prescribed  Xanax  with  a  friend  who  had  Adderall  and  Ritalin. He infrequently  used  it while
attending   college   and   later  night  school  in  2015,  while   earning   his   master’s  degree   or
when  completing  a  big  project to  help  him  be  more  focused.  He  estimated  he  used  his
friend’s prescription  drugs about  five  or  less  times  and  did  not  take  a  whole pill. He  no
longer has contact with this friend since Applicant moved to  a  new state  in 2019  that is a
long  distance  away. His doctor was unaware he  was using  these  drugs. (Tr. 30-32,  40-
45,48-50; GE  4)
Applicant voluntarily disclosed his drug use on his security clearance applications
(SCA)  in  2011,  2018,  and  again  in  2020.  He  indicated  to  the  investigator  during  his
background interview that he does not intend to use any illegal drug or drug that is not
prescribed to him in the future. He provided a signed written statement  that he will not
use  illegal  drugs  in  the  future  and  acknowledging  future  involvement  may  result  in
revocation  of  his  clearance.  He  also  indicated  in  writing  that  he  is  willing  to  submit  to
random and scheduled drug testing. (Tr. 32-34; GE 1, 2, 3; AE G)
Applicant  fully  understands  that  illegal  drug  use  is  inconsistent  with  holding  a
security clearance. He understands this is regardless of whether he actually has access
to classified information. (Tr. 35-36, 43)
After the birth of his first child in 2017, Applicant made a conscious decision that
he must set an example for his children and illegal drug use was inconsistent with the
model he wanted to represent. He is a different person since becoming a parent. He felt
it  was  more  important  to  be  honest  in  disclosing  his  past  drug  use  than  to  hide  it  and
although  disclosure was  required,  it was  also  the  right  thing to do.  He  does not regret
being honest. He admitted he made errors in judgment that are in his past and has thought
about the negative impact his past drug use could have on his family and his career. He
asked for another chance. (Tr. 35-37)
Character witnesses testified on Applicant’s behalf. They described him as honest,
honorable, prodigious, forthright, disciplined, and trustworthy. They would never question
his integrity. He is a devoted family man and father. He is devoted to his faith and is part
of a team at his church. His supervisor testified that Applicant is highly respected at work
for his attention to detail, and he ensures the project is completed on schedule. All but his
wife, who testified for him, hold security clearances. All expressed they had no concerns
about Applicant holding a security clearance. (Tr. 52-91)

"The SOR largely alleges that Applicant used certain illegal drugs, while granted
access  to  classified  information.  He  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d  and  ¶  2.a,  and  provided
narrative  explanations  for  each  allegation.  He  denied  using  illegal  drugs  while
possessing an active clearance, but he acknowledged using the illegal drugs during the
timeframe  alleged.  He  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.e,  also  with  an  explanation.  That  admission,
and  his  explanations,  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. He was married from October 2016 until January 2020,
when  he  and  his  wife  divorced.  He  has  no  children.  Applicant  graduated  from  high
school in 2007. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2011 and a master’s degree in 2012.
From June 2012 until August 2014, he worked as an engineer for defense contractor 1.
He left that job for his current position with defense contractor 2, a job he has held since
August 2014. (Item 3)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  January  2021  SCA  that  he  was  granted  a  secret
security clearance in 2012, in connection with his job with defense contractor 1. (Item 3
at 44-45)
Applicant  also  disclosed  a  history  of  illegal  drug  use.  He  disclosed  using
marijuana  four  times  with  friends  in  the  summer  of  2009.  He  disclosed  that  he  has
“smoked  weed  and  eaten  edibles  with  friends  since  it’s  been  legalized”  in  the  state
where  Applicant  lives,  between  January  2019  and  November  2020.  He  said  he  had
been “curious to try THC and have tried it a few times.” (Item 3 at 40-41)
Applicant  disclosed  that  has  used  MDMA  (ecstasy/molly)  three  times  between
September  2019  and  November  2020,  once  at  a  music  festival,  and  twice  at  parties.
(Item 3 at 41) Applicant disclosed “snorting cocaine powder a few times (fewer than five
times)”  with  friends  between  August  2020  and  November  2020.  (Item  3  at  41-42)
Applicant disclosed using LSD  once  and  “magic mushrooms” a  few  times with  friends,
also between August 2020 and December 2020. (Item 3 at 42)
On  his  SCA.  Applicant  described  his  use  of  each  drug  as  experimental,  and
driven  by  curiosity.  He  repeatedly stated  that  he  had  never  used  illegal  drugs  while  in
possession of a security clearance, and in answering the question “Was your use while
possessing a security clearance?” in each instance Applicant answered, “NO.” Applicant
also stated that he did not intend to use illegal drugs in the future due to the impact  on
his clearance and his career. (Item 3 at 40-42)
Applicant had a background interview in February 2021. He affirmed during the-
interview  that  he  had  not  used  illegal  drugs  since  December  2020,  as  previously
disclosed.  In  August  2021,  he  authenticated  and  adopted  his  interview  summary  as
valid  and  accurate. When asked  to  detail his  history  of  illegal drug use,  he  referred  to
his previous disclosures and affirmed that “no further instances have occurred.” (Item 4)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant’s  various  instances  of
illegal  drug  use
(marijuana,  MDNA,  cocaine  and  LSD)  occurred  with  varying  frequency,  during  the
timeframes  listed  above  (with  one  exception  noted  below),  “while  granted  access  to
classified information.” (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d)
SOR ¶  1.a  alleges that  Applicant used marijuana, with  varying  frequency, in June
2009  and  again from  about July  2011  to  at least November 2020, while  granted  access
to   classified   information.”  (Emphasis  added)   Notwithstanding   Applicant’s  statement  in
answering   SOR  ¶   1.a   that  he   “used   marijuana   during   the   time   specified,”  there  is   no
other  evidence   that   he   resumed   marijuana   use   in   “July   2011.”  Rather,  the   record
otherwise supports a  finding  that he  resumed  marijuana  use  in January  2019. (Item  3  at
40-41; Item  4  at 8)  It  therefore  appears that the  reference  to  “July  2011” in SOR ¶  1.a  is
erroneous,  and   likely  a   typographical  error.  I  find   accordingly   and   consider  that  he
resumed  using marijuana in January 2019.
As noted, Applicant admitted using the illegal drugs in question but denied using
any illegal drugs while in possession of a clearance. He reported having been granted a
clearance  while  with  defense  contractor  1,  in  March  2012.  (Item  3)  However,  the
Government  did  not  submit  documentary  evidence  from  its  own  records  to  verify  the
status  of  Applicant’s  clearance  eligibility,  such  as  from  the  DOD’s  Joint  Personnel
Adjudication System (JPAS) or its successor database, DISS.
SOR  ¶  1.e  states  that  Applicant  “continue[s]  to  associate  with  others  who  are
involved in illegal drug use.” Applicant admitted the allegation, noting that marijuana use
is widespread in the state where he lives. He noted that it would be “virtually impossible
to associate only with people who do not use illegal drugs.” (Answer)
Applicant  attested  that  his  illegal  drug  use  has  ceased;  he  is  not  tempted  to
partake  in  illegal  substances;  he  has  been  truthful  about  his  prior  drug  use,  which
demonstrates his honesty and his ability and willingness to comply with laws, rules and
regulations,  and  thus,  his  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  (Answer)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  Government’s  FORM  so  no  more  recent  information
about him is available.

"After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency from about February 2015 until June 2020, and that he used marijuana from
about February 2015 until June 2020 “while holding a security clearance.” In Applicant’s
undated answer to the SOR, he admitted both SOR allegations. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant  is  29  years  old.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  May  2015.  He
married in September 2015 and divorced in June 2020. He has no children. He has been
employed by a federal contractor since May 2014, initially as an intern and subsequently
as a full-time employee. He has held a security clearance since about July 2014. (Items
3 through 7)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  July  2014.  He
certified that he had not illegally used any drugs or controlled substances in the previous
seven  years.  He  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  on  various  dates  from
September 2014 to December 2014, and in September 2015. There is no indication illegal
drug  use  was  discussed  by  the  investigator  or  Applicant  during  the  background
interviews. (Items 5, 6, 7)
Applicant completed another SCA on January 8, 2021, and disclosed that he had
illegally  used  marijuana  from  approximately  February  2015  to  June  2020  while
possessing a  security clearance.  He described his illegal marijuana  use as  “Less than
once a year, when there was marijuana at a group event. Very limited usage, and it has
never actually affected me…. Someday if marijuana/[tetrahydrocannabinol] THC is fully
legalized, I may be more inclined to participate in some capacity.” (Item 3 at 34-36)
During a  February 23,  2021  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  Applicant
confirmed that he used substances containing THC from approximately February 2015 to
June 2020. He said that he smoked marijuana four times from approximately February
2015 to June 2020, and consumed an edible containing THC in 2019. He stated that he
smoked marijuana about once a year at parties by taking one puff of marijuana as it was
passed around. He said that he did not recall the specific dates he used marijuana, and
did  not  know  who  brought  it  to  the  parties.  He  also  said  that  he  legally  purchased  a
chocolate bar containing THC from a state-authorized dispensary in 2019. He stated that
he was curious about what it felt like to be high, but had never experienced a high from
his marijuana/THC [hereinafter marijuana]  use.  He  said  that  he  last  used  marijuana  in
June 2020. He stated that he did not intend to illegally use  marijuana in the future, but
might  if  it  was  legalized  under  federal  law.  He  said  that  he  avoids  situations  where
marijuana may be used, and did not know if anyone he socializes with illegally uses drugs.
He has not participated in any drug counseling or treatment. (Item 4 at 4-5)
In his undated response to the SOR, Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. He
stated that he had “used marijuana very infrequently, maybe 5-6 times” over a five-year
period. He noted that he had “no interest in seeking it out again, unless it were to become
a fully legal activity,” and that it had been over a year since his last use. He also noted
that:
I   used   marijuana   while   holding   a   security   clearance.  .  .  I  will  add   that
although  I had  a  clearance,  I have  never had  a  reason  to  use  it, and  have
no  knowledge  of  any  classified  [government]  information. If  I were entrusted
with  that  information  in  the  course  of my  work, it would  be  more  important
to  me to protect that knowledge.
(Item 2 at 2)
In his undated response to the FORM, Applicant again stated that he did not recall
the date he first used marijuana, but was certain that it was sometime after he graduated
from college in May 2015. He stated that he had incorrectly estimated February 2015 as
the date of his first use in previous submissions, and said that he had never lied about his
drug  use  during  an  investigation  including  during  the  September  2015  background
interview. He averred that his self-reported drug use evidenced his truthfulness. (AE A)

"Applicant is a 26-year-old mechanical technician with a defense contractor. She is
single and has one child. She is a high school graduate. She is seeking to obtain national
security eligibility in connection with her work with DoD. (Item 3 at Sections 13A, 17, and
18,)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline  H – Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  she  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  allegations  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.d
without reservations. She admitted in part and denied in part allegations 1.a, 1.e, and 1.f,
with explanations.
1.a. Applicant admitted using marijuana  from  about November 2012  to December
2020. She  used  marijuana  about  once  or  twice  a  month  during  that  period.  (Answer; Item
3 at Section 23; Item 4 at 6-7.)
The allegation alleged that Applicant stopped using marijuana in May 2021. This
date was based on a handwritten answer concerning her last date of use Applicant made
in  DOHA  interrogatories  signed  by  her  on  October  13,  2021.  (Item  4  at  20.)  Applicant
denied that part of the allegation in her Answer, stating, “I realized that is a date error on
my  part.  My  last  use  was  Dec  20.”  When  responding  to  allegations  1.e  and  1.f  in  her
Answer, which also refer to May 2021 as her last date of use, Applicant described her
entry as, “a typo error.” Department Counsel argued in the FORM that this statement of
Applicant concerning the wrong date lacked credibility.
1.b.  Applicant  admitted  that she  used  hallucinogenic mushrooms  on  one  occasion
in 2018.  (Item 3  at Section 23; Item 4  at 7-8.)
1.c.  Applicant  admitted  using  cocaine  on  one  occasion  in  2017  in  her Answer. In
her e-QIP,  during  a  subject  interview  with  an  authorized  investigator for the  DoD,  and  in
her interrogatory answers, she admits to using cocaine two times in 2017. I find that she
used cocaine twice in 2017. (Item 3 at Section 23; Item 4 at 7, 20.)
1.d.   Applicant   admitted   using   methamphetamine   one   time   in  2017.   (Item   3   at
Section 23; Item 4  at 7.)
1.e.  Applicant  admitted  using  marijuana  in  December 2020  after beginning  to  work
for  her  current  employer  in  a   sensitive   position   in  November  2020.  She   stated   in  her
Answer, “I deny I used  in May 2021  as that was a typo  error.”
1.f.   Applicant   admitted   using   marijuana   after   filling   out  her  e-QIP   in   December
2020. She  stated  in her Answer, “I deny  I used  marijuana  in  May  of 2021  as this was a
typo error.”
With  regard  to  any  future  use  of  drugs  Applicant  stated  in  her  interrogatory
response, “It is my intent to live a long healthy life, with no use of harmful substances. I
have  occasionally  used  marijuana  as  a  means  of  leisure,  but  I  would  never  allow any
substance to interfere with my career development and employment.” (Item 4 at 21.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because the conduct alleged in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.e, and 1.f  shows poor judgment,
untrustworthiness or unreliability. Her conduct will be evaluated under this guideline as
well. She did not admit or deny the single allegation under this paragraph, which I view
as a denial.

"Applicant is 48 years old, married and has two children (ages seven and ten) and
two stepchildren (ages 25 and 28). He received his high school diploma in 1992 and has
taken  some  college  courses.  In  2006  Applicant  applied  for  a  trustworthiness
determination. DOHA granted him eligibility in March 2007. Applicant is now the co-owner
and a senior management officer of a technology company (the Company), which he co-
founded  in  2011.  He  is  also  the  Facility  Security  Officer  (FSO)  of  the  Company.  The
Company  has  about  12  employees.  Applicant  was  granted  eligibility  for  a  Secret
clearance in November 2018. The Company is now seeking facility clearance eligibility to
work  on  Top  Secret  DoD  contracts.  As  one  of  the  Company’s  Key  Management
Personnel, Applicant is also seeking eligibility at the Top Secret level  as a requirement
for the upgrade of the Company’s facility clearance. (Answer at 1-2; Tr. at 28, 43-51; GE
4 at 1; AE B at 1, 3, 4.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because of his recent drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  August  2019  through  March  2021  (SOR
1.a). The SOR also alleged that Applicant used marijuana after he had been granted a
security clearance in November 2018 (SOR 1.b). In his Answer, Applicant admitted both
allegations under this guideline. (Answer at 1.)
In 2019 Applicant started smoking marijuana at the request of his wife. They lived
in  State  A  where  it  was  legal  to  purchase  and  possess  marijuana.  His  wife  was
experiencing anxiety, and she wanted to use marijuana to ease her discomfort and help
her sleep at night. When the Company was given the opportunity in 2021 to work on a
DoD contract that required the Company to have a Top Secret facility clearance, Applicant
knew that he would need to upgrade his clearance, and he stopped smoking marijuana.
His wife continued to occasionally smoke marijuana alone in the family’s garage before
retiring to sleep. Applicant submitted his e-QIP for his upgraded clearance a couple of
months later. He disclosed his marijuana use in his e-QIP and wrote that he used it about
40-50 times during the period August 2019 to March 2021. He wrote, “When it was noted
that existing contract work would require potential to upgrade to a TS I thought I probably
should  not  use  [marijuana].”  At  the  hearing,  he  confirmed  these  dates,  the  estimated
number of times he used marijuana, and his motivation for ceasing his marijuana use in
about March 2021 before submitting his May 2021 e-QIP. (Tr. at 40-41, 45-47, 49; GE 1
at 35-36.)
Paragraph 2  - Guideline  E, Personal Conduct
The  Government alleges in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for  clearance
because   he   has  engaged   in  conduct   that  involves  questionable   judgment,   an
unwillingness to  follow  rules and  regulations,  lack of  candor, and  dishonesty. The  SOR
cross-alleged  under this guideline  the  two  Guideline  H allegations described  above  (SOR
2.a). The  SOR also alleged  that Applicant was arrested  and  charged  with  Driving  Under
the   Influence   of   Alcohol  (DUI)  on   two   occasions,  once   in  August   2000   and   again  in
November  2004   (SOR  2.b   and   2.c).  The   SOR  sets   forth   two   additional  allegations
involving  Applicant’s failure to  disclose  the  November 2004  DUI arrest in his 2021  e-QIP
and   in  a   prior  e-QIP,  certified   by   Applicant  on   April  6,   2017   (2017   e-QIP).  Applicant
allegedly  falsified  his responses under Section  22  - Police  Record (EVER)  (SOR 2.d  and
2.e)  in both  e-QIPs. The  specific questions also use  the  unlimited  timeframe  of  “EVER,”
with  the  emphasis in the  original e-QIP  texts  in both  the  section  titles  and  in the  questions.
In   his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted   the   allegations  in  subparagraphs   2.a   through
2.c. He  denied  the  falsification  allegations in  SOR 2.d  and  2.e. He  accompanied  those
denials with  explanations.  He wrote  that the  omission  of his second  DUI arrest in 2004  in
his 2017  e-QIP  and  the  omission  of  both  arrests in his 2021  e-QIP  was not intentional
and  was due  to  a  misunderstanding.  He wrote  that  he  fully  disclosed  both  DUIs  during  his
background interviews in 2017 and  2021.  (Answer at 1-2.)
Applicant  discussed  his  DUIs  in  his  2021  background  interview.  He  told  the
investigator  that  his failure  to  disclose  his  2000  DUI  in  his  2021  e-QIP  was  due  to  an
oversight.  He  disclosed  it  under  questions  dealing  with  alcohol  counseling.  He  also
reported that he did not disclose the 2004 DUI due to a misunderstanding. (GE 3 at 8-9.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  his failure  to  completely disclose  his  DUI
arrests in his two most recent e-QIPs was unintentional. Applicant noted that he disclosed
his  2000  DUI  in  the  2021  e-QIP  in  response  to  questions  in  Section  24  titled  “Use  of
Alcohol.” He omitted his 2004 DUI due to a “clerical mistake.” He did not believe he had
to  repeat  in  his  2021  e-QIP  all  of  the  details  in  his  2017  e-QIP  and  from  his  prior
investigations. The record does not contain the summaries of his background interviews
from his prior investigations. In his 2017 e-QIP he disclosed his 2000 arrest, but not his
2004 arrest. He said that omission was due to a misunderstanding. He also noted that he
fully disclosed his recent use of marijuana and disclosed his DUI arrests in his background
interviews. He also testified that he no longer drinks alcohol because he has developed
an allergic reaction to alcohol. (Tr. at 37-42, 50-51; GE 2 at 37.)
Mitigation  and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant’s  business  partner  testified  in  support  of  Applicant.  The  witness  has
known Applicant since 2009 and has worked closely with him since then. They started
their business together in 2011. The witness believes Applicant has “amazing integrity”
and  appreciates  Applicant’s  honesty  since  they  are  partners.  He  and  Applicant  have
discussed the differences between Federal law and the law in State A where they both
live and work. (Tr. at 21-29.)
Applicant’s wife  also testified. She  has  known  Applicant for 13  years. The  first time
he  smoked  marijuana  was with  her in the  summer or fall of  2019. They  last  used  marijuana
together  in the  first  quarter of 2021.  She  asked  Applicant  to  smoke  marijuana  with  her
because   she   was  nervous  and   suffering   from   anxiety.  She   was  experiencing   difficulty
sleeping, and  she  thought that  marijuana  might help  her condition.   She  did  not want  to
use  marijuana  alone.  She  has  seen  Applicant use  marijuana  30-40  times  during  the  2019-
to-2021   period.  She   continues  to   use   marijuana   for  her  anxiety   and   has  smoked
marijuana  as recently  as a  couple of months  before the  hearing. She  does  not use  the
drug  in the  presence  of  her husband. She  smokes at  before bedtime  in  their  garage  away
from the couple’s children. (Tr. at 29-36.)

approximately June 2011, and reapplied for a security clearance in August 2020. (Item 2;
Item 3; Item 4)
Applicant admitted using marijuana multiple times between March and April 2019,
while granted access to classified information, as alleged in the SOR.  (Item I; Item 2)
In Applicant’s August 2020 SCA, he admitted to using marijuana between January
1997 and March 2019. “In 2019, I smoked marijuana (in plant form) several times from a
tobacco pipe. I consumed it on the weekends to help with sleep and stress.” He further
explained  that  he  thought using  marijuana  “would help with  stress and  relaxation  but  it
caused paranoia and made [him] feel terrible.” (Item 3 at 32-33)
During  Applicant’s  August  2021  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  he
admitted to using marijuana for the first time in January 1997, while he was in high school;
however, he discontinued using it until March 2019. At that time, he went on vacation to
a  state  in which  recreational marijuana use is legal.  He  paid $50 for marijuana from  a
vendor  and  brought  it  home  with  him.  At  that  time,  all  marijuana  possession  in  his
residential  state  was  illegal,  including  possession  of  marijuana  for  medical  use,  and
misdemeanor possession of marijuana for personal use could result in a $6,000 fine and
a one-year jail term. Following his vacation, he used the marijuana he had purchased one
to two times a weekend, at home, by himself, before going to bed over the course of two
to three weekends. Due, in part, to conflict with his wife, he disposed of the remainder of
the  marijuana.  His  marijuana  use  caused  strain  in  his  marriage  and  was  one  of  the
contributing factors of his 2020 divorce. As of the date of his interview, no one other than
his ex-wife is aware of his illegal marijuana use and possession, including his supervisor
and security officer.  (Item 4)
When questioned regarding using marijuana  while  holding a security clearance,
Applicant told investigator that he was aware that marijuana use while holding a security
clearance was illegal. Additionally, he discontinued his use of marijuana, in part, due to
being concerned that he would fail a work-place urinalysis. Marijuana use also caused
him to have paranoia, his heart to race, and he thought he was going to die. (Item 4)
In Applicant’s February 2022 Answer to the SOR, he reiterated that he does not
intend to use marijuana in the future. He used marijuana due to being at a low point in his
life.  His  marriage  was  struggling,  he  was  feeling  overwhelmed  financially,  and  he  was
disappointed  that  his  career  as  an  artist  had  not  occurred.  He  also  indicated  he  had
“sought out help  with  a  counselor”  but did not provide  additional details or substantiating
documentation. (Item 2)

March 2005. In spite of those two statements, Applicant testified at his hearing that he
did not recall using marijuana in 2001 to 2002.  (Tr. at 19-20, 23-26, 40-41; Applicant’s
response  to  SOR;  GE  6,  7)  I  did  not  find  his  testimony  credible.  I  find  by  substantial
evidence2  that he used marijuana while holding a security clearance in about December
2001 or January 2002.
1 Any adverse matter that  was not alleged  in the SOR  will not be used for disqualification  purposes. It may
be  considered when  assessing  Applicant’s  credibility, in the  application  of  mitigating  conditions, and in the
whole-person  analysis.
2  Substantial  evidence  is  “such  relevant  evidence  as  a  reasonable  mind  might  accept  as  adequate  to
support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.” See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No.
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
September  2015.  He  reported  that  he  was  fired  from  his  employment  in  June  2015
because  of  “Misunderstanding  of  company  policy.” He  provided  a  detailed  explanation
under other questions. He reported his 1979 citation for possession of marijuana, but he
did not report his January 2002 citation for possession of drug paraphernalia. He denied
that  he  “EVER  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled
substance while possessing a security clearance other than previously listed.” (GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  June  2017.  He
discussed  his  2015  job  termination.  He  stated  that  the  1979  marijuana  possession
charge was discussed previously, and there were no other developments to report. (GE
2)
Applicant  was  stopped  for  a  traffic  citation  in  September  2017.  The  deputy
noticed the smell of unburnt marijuana and saw something suspicious in the cup holder.
Applicant stated that it was an old pipe that he used to smoke tobacco. When he was
handed  the  pipe,  the  deputy  saw  burnt  marijuana  residue,  and  it  smelled  like  burnt
marijuana.  Applicant  admitted  to  smoking  “bud”  that  day.  The  deputy  also  found  two
plastic  bags  in  the  vehicle  with  just  over  two  grams  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was  cited
with possession of marijuana. (Tr. at 15, 26, 30-31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2,
3, 13, 15)
Applicant  received  a  deferred  adjudication  for  the  offense.  He  was  required  to
pay a fine and fees, and he was required to attend a personal behavior class. (Tr. at 15,
16, 38-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 15)
Applicant held a security clearance at the time. He  self-reported the charge and
its disposition to his security officer in November 2017. He indicated that he purchased
the  marijuana  and  smoked  it  in  a  state  where  it  was  legal  under  state  law.  He
transported it to his state, where it was not legal under state law. He falsely stated that
he had not used illegal drugs on any other occasions since 1979. (Tr. at 15, 26; GE 3,
15)
Applicant was going through airport security in his home state in January 2018. A
small knife and a pipe with marijuana residue was found after his carry-on bag was x-
rayed. The small metal pipe was wrapped in a napkin in a ziplock bag inside a toiletry
bag. Airport police were notified.  Applicant admitted to the  police officer that the carry-
on bag and the ziplock bag was his. The officer asked him what was in the ziplock bag
to which Applicant replied it was “a small pipe that he had forgotten that was in his bag.”
He  also  stated  that  he  smoked  tobacco.  The  police  officer  examined  the  pipe  and
determined  based  on  his  experience  that  the  residue  was  burnt  marijuana.  Applicant
17-04166   at  3  (App.  Bd.  Mar.  21,  2019)   (citing   Directive  ¶   E3.1.32.1).   “This   is   something   less   than  the
weight  of   the   evidence,  and   the  possibility   of   drawing   two  inconsistent  conclusions   from   the   evidence
does  not prevent [a Judge’s] finding  from  being  supported by   substantial   evidence.”  Consolo v. Federal
Maritime  Comm’n,  383  U.S. 607,  620 (1966).  “Substantial  evidence” is  “more than  a  scintilla  but  less  than
a preponderance.”  See v. Washington  Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36  F.3d  375, 380  (4th  Cir. 1994);  ISCR
Case No.  04-07187  at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2006).
then   admitted   that  he   smoked   marijuana,  and   that  the   last   time   he   smoked   marijuana
with the pipe was the  previous month on Christmas.  (Tr. at 31-39; GE 14)
Applicant was cited with possession of drug paraphernalia, provided a court date,
and  permitted  to  board  his flight.  Applicant  was  found  not  guilty  of  the  charge  in  April
2019. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 14)
Applicant  testified   that   he   borrowed   the   carry-on   bag   from   his  son,  and   he   was
unaware that the  pipe  was in the  bag. He stated  that he  never asked  his son  about  the
pipe  because  he  did not want to  worry his son.  He denied  telling  the  police  officer  that
he  used  the  pipe  to  smoke  marijuana.   (Tr.  at 31-39; Applicant’s response   to   SOR;   GE
14) I did not find his testimony credible.  I find that the incident happened substantially as
reported in the  police report of the incident.
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  background  investigator  in  October  2018  about
the 2017 and 2018 citations and his marijuana use. He admitted that he used marijuana
in  college  from  1978  to  1983,  but  he  stated  that  he  did  not  use  it  again  until  he
possessed and used marijuana in July 2017. He discussed his September 2017 charge
for  marijuana  possession.  He  used  marijuana  three  or  four  days  while  he  was  on
vacation  in  July  2017,  and  again  in  September  2017.  He  stated  those  were  the  only
times he used drugs while holding a security clearance. He stated that he had not used
marijuana at any other time, and he did not intend to use it in the future as it could derail
his career. (GE 2)
Applicant  discussed  the  January  2018  citation  from  the  airport  with  the
investigator. He stated that the pipe was not his, and he did not know how it got in his
bag. He stated that it could belong to one of his children. (GE 2)
Applicant  denied  that  he  provided  false  information  during  the  interview.  He
stated that he told the truth and that it was not his pipe that was found at the airport. (Tr.
at 31-39; Applicant’s response to SOR) As indicated above, I did not find him credible. I
find  that  he  lied  to  the  investigator,  and  he  provided  additional false  statements  in  the
SOR response and during his hearing testimony.
Applicant  also has a  history of  workplace  issues.  An  incident  report  was  issued
by  an  employer  in  February  1997  because  Applicant  “did  not  comply  with  company
policy  of  paying  his  [company]  credit  card  in  a  timely  manner  and  by  using  his  credit
card  for  personal  use.”  He  stated  that  he  paid  the  balance  off  in  full,  and  no  further
action  was  required.  He  went  to  work  for  another  defense  contractor  in  August  1997,
where  he  worked  until  he  was  terminated  in  May  2015  for  unauthorized  use  of  an
employer-issued credit card. (Tr. at 45-50; GE 6, 8, 10, 16)
In 2001, Applicant’s employer counseled him for charging personal rental cars to
the  company’s  corporate  credit  card  without  proper  authority,  for  having  an  unpaid
balance  on  a  corporate  credit  card,  and  for  not  repaying  a  cash  advance  from  the
company.  The  company  assisted  him  in  resolving  the  matter.  He  was  suspended
without  pay  for  a  week.  He  was  “placed  on  permanent  probation  for  any  similar
violations,” with  the  warning  that “[s]hould similar violations occur he  will  be  immediately
terminated.”  (Tr. at 50;  GE 6, 11)
Applicant was terminated in May 2015 for misuse of a company credit card. He
stated that he was having financial difficulties, and he used the company credit card for
“expenses  that  involved  transportation  to  work  and  some  expenses  on  an  approved
trip.” He asserted that it was a “[m]isundstanding of company policy,” and that he “never
falsified  any  trip  reports  and  paid  the  balance  of  the  credit  card.”  (Tr.  at  44,  50-55;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 12, 16)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance  and  ethical  standards.  He  is  praised  for  his  work  ethic  and  sensitive
handling of classified information. (Applicant’s response to SOR)
",False
"The SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR ¶ 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline
J (SOR ¶ 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR ¶ 4.b) that Applicant was convicted of driving under
the  influence  (DUI)  or  operating  under  the  influence  (OUI)  offenses  committed  in  July
2013  (SOR ¶ 1.b), April 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.c), and August 2015  (SOR ¶ 1.d). Also under
Guideline G, Applicant allegedly consumed alcohol at times to excess and to intoxication
since about 2013 to at least December 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a); was separated from the Army
National Guard Reserve (ARNG) because of his alcohol-related offenses; and received
treatment from November 2015 to January 2016 for diagnosed addictive disorder-alcohol
abuse and attention deficit disorder (SOR ¶ 1.f) and from February 2016 to April 2016 for
substance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (SOR ¶ 1.g).
The   SOR  alleges  under  Guideline   H  (SOR  ¶   3.a),  and   cross-alleges  under
Guideline  J  (SOR ¶  2.b), that  Applicant  used  cocaine  with  varying  frequency  from  about
September  2013   to   at  least  September  2015   while   granted   access  to   classified
information  (SOR ¶  3.b).  His use  of cocaine  while  granted  access  to  classified  information
was also cross-alleged  under  Guideline  E  (SOR ¶  4.a).  Also  under Guideline  E,  Applicant
allegedly   falsified   his  June   30,  2018   Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing   (hereafter  SF  86)  by   responding   negatively   to   inquiries  concerning   any
delinquency  regarding  routine  accounts  (SOR  ¶  4.c). Under Guideline  F, the  SOR alleges
that   Applicant owed,  as  of   May   21,  2021,  three   charged-off   debts for $24,833   (SOR  ¶
5.a), $  830  (SOR ¶ 5.b), and  $53  (SOR ¶ 5.i); and  eight  collection debts for $185  (SOR ¶
5.c), $572  (SOR ¶  5.d), $1,493  (SOR ¶  5.e), $619  (SOR ¶  5.f), $1,188  (SOR ¶  5.g), $567
(SOR ¶ 5.h), $3,923 (SOR ¶ 5.j), and $469 (SOR ¶ 5.k).
When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations but indicated
that he did not intentionally falsify his SF 86. Applicant asserted that he had abstained
from alcohol since December 5, 2019; that he sought help for his depression and is on
mental-health  medications;  and  that  he  had  paid  off  some  of  the  delinquent  debts,
including the debt in SOR ¶ 5.a.
Applicant’s admissions to abusing alcohol and committing drunk-driving offenses;
to receiving treatment for the diagnosed conditions; and to having owed the delinquent
debts are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings,
exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old high school graduate with some online college study.
(GE  1.)  He  has  never  married,  but  he  has  had  a  cohabitant  girlfriend  for  the  past  five
years.  She  has  two  children,  ages  17  and  20,  who  live  with  them.  (Tr.  29,  32,  81.)
Applicant has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since about June
2017. (GE 1.)
Applicant enlisted in the ARNG at age 17 in April 2004 (Tr. 32-33), and he served
until February 2016, when he was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions
because he had tested positive for cocaine and alcohol in a routine ARNG screening. (Tr.
35.) He appealed the character of his discharge, and it was later changed to honorable
based on his military service record. (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 35-36.) He was activated twice to
combat duty: from May 2006 through April 2007 and from July 2008 to May 2009. (AE B;
Tr. 33.) He was granted a security clearance shortly before his second deployment. (Tr.
34.) On his return from active duty, he worked full time for his state’s ARNG, which included
a deployment overseas from October 2012 to August 2013. (AE C.) In September 2013,
he lost his full-time job with the ARNG. He indicated on his June 2018 SF 86 that funding
for  his  full-time  position  with  the  ARNG  ran  out,  but  his  medical  records  from  the  VA
indicate that his job loss was because of his July 2013 DUI. (AE C.)
Substance Use  and Treatment
Applicant  drank  alcohol  in  high  school  “at  a  party  here  or  there.”  (Tr.  36.)  His
drinking to excess started in the summer of 2007. After he returned from being deployed,
he initially consumed alcohol in quantity of 30 beers and 750 ml of liquor per week. (AE
C.) He eventually moderated his consumption to social drinking, about twice a week, until
about April 2013. After he and his then-fiancée called off their relationship three months
before  they  were  to  marry  (Tr.  37),  he  began  to  turn  to  alcohol,  often  nightly,  to  self-
medicate for mental-health issues. (AE C; Tr. 25.)
After drinking four to five alcohol drinks while out at a casino with family members
one evening in July 2013, Applicant was stopped by police for swerving. He failed field
sobriety  tests  and  was  arrested  for  DUI.  He  pled  guilty,  was  granted  accelerated
rehabilitation,  placed  on  probation,  and  ordered  to  complete  100  hours  of  community
service and alcohol counseling. The charge was dismissed after he completed the terms.
(GE 2.)
Applicant’s July 2013 DUI was a factor in him losing his full-time job with the ARNG
around September 2013. He drank 750 ml of vodka per night early that winter before his
family intervened in January 2014, and he attended a two-week alcohol program. (AE C.)
From March 2014 to November 2014, he worked as a part-time bartender. (GEs 1, 2.) He
drank  alcohol  at  times  to  excess  and  used  cocaine  intermittently  in  combination  with
alcohol in that job. (Tr. 26, 44.) He used cocaine as the drug helped him sober up more
quickly from drinking. He found that the drug helped him drink more. (Tr. 42.)
Applicant consumed five to six alcohol drinks and three to four shots of liquor on
April  18,  2014,  while  talking  with  patrons  and  then  cleaning up  with  his manager  after
closing the bar. While driving home, he was stopped by the police, who smelled alcohol
on his breath. He failed a breathalyzer and was arrested for  DUI. (GEs 1-2.) Available
records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicate a re-arrest date of October
25, 2014; a disposition date of January 14, 2015; and a sentence of  six months in jail,
suspended, a $500 fine, one year of probation, and 100 hours of community service. (GE
6.)
Applicant was seen at a VA health center in May 2014 and referred to the facility’s
substance-abuse  clinic.  He  reported  an  escalation  of  alcohol  use  following  two
deployments and use of alcohol to avoid his mental-health problems. A toxicology screen
of  May  8,  2014  was  positive  for  cocaine.  While  attending  substance-abuse  outpatient
programs  at  the  VA  between  July  2014  and  September  2014,  he  continued  to  drink
alcohol once a week, about two to four drinks each time. His drinking adversely affected
his relationship with his family between April 2014 and February 2015. (AE C.)
Applicant was unemployed from about November 2014 to June 2015. He was not
engaged  in  any  substance-abuse  treatment  nor  seeing  a  psychiatrist  during  that  time.
(GE  1;  AE  C;  Tr.  25.)  On  March  6,  2015,  he  presented  at  a  VA  clinic  for  a  medical
screening for a research study. He showed signs of mild intoxication, and he reported a
history of  consuming two to three alcohol drinks per day. He described his drinking as
“out of control” in the recent past. He was advised to abstain from alcohol. (AE B.)
Applicant worked for a home-improvement retailer from April 2015 to August 2015.
He  told the VA in 2015  that he had been  sober, but he  subsequently admitted  in  May
2016 that he had been drinking the entire time. (AE C.) In August 2015, he started working
as a manager at a bar. (GE 1.) In addition to using alcohol, he used cocaine on occasion
to at least November 22, 2015. (GE 2; AE C.) He reported during a psychiatric consult at
the VA in May 2016 that he had “hired his cocaine dealer” when he managed the bar so
that he and his staff would have access to the drug “as needed.” At times, he slept on a
sofa at work and was late to his drill weekend because of drinking. (AE C.)
On August 31, 2015, Applicant crashed his scooter in route home after consuming
five to six alcohol drinks with a friend on the friend’s boat. He was charged with DUI and
with probation violation (two counts). (GE 6.) He testified that he was charged with being
a two-time first offender for the April 2014 and August 2015 DUIs in that he faced one
DUI charge for the August 2015 offense with the ramifications of two DUIs. (Tr. 38.) FBI
records show that, on April 27, 2016, he was convicted of  the August 2015 DUI and of
the violation of probation charges. On May 4, 2016, he was sentenced on the DUI charge
to six months in jail, one year of probation, and a $500 fine. He had to serve only ten days
in jail as the court accepted his attendance at a substance-abuse treatment program in
lieu of jail time. He was sentenced on the probation violation counts to two days in jail for
each  offense,  to  serve  concurrently.  (GE  6;  AE  C.)  He  was  also  required  to  have  an
interlock-type device in his vehicle. (GE 2; Tr. 28.) He testified that he fulfilled the terms
of his sentence, and the device was removed. (Tr. 78.)
On  September  17,  2015,  Applicant  went  to  a  VA  mental-health  clinic  seeking
substance-abuse  treatment.  He  reported  some  anxiety  and  exhibited  some  signs  of
minimization of the harm drinking had caused him. He reported drinking “only six drinks”
before his August 2015 DUI. He was placed on a trial dose of Lexapro and referred to an
outpatient alcohol and substance abuse program. (AE C.)
During a follow-up visit with his treating psychiatrist at his local VA clinic on October
19,  2015,  Applicant  reported  he  had  completed  seven  sessions  of  substance-abuse
treatment and had abstained from alcohol. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder
and PTSD (rule out), and was continued on Lexapro. (AE C.)
Applicant  quit  working  at  the  bar  in  November  2015  to  focus  on  his  alcohol
rehabilitation.  (GE  1.)  On  November  23,  2015,  he  went  to  a  VA  medical  center’s
psychiatric emergency department accompanied by his ARNG supervisor. Applicant had
been  late  to  a  military  drill  because  of  intoxication,  after  having  consumed  a  gallon  of
alcohol. He reported binge drinking of six to eight beers plus 750 ml of vodka or rum every
three weeks and consumption of lesser amounts several times per week, to as recently
as November 20, 2015. He complained of symptoms of PTSD and requested substance-
abuse treatment. He was admitted for observation for 23 hours, and was diagnosed with
alcohol use disorder (binge pattern) and PTSD.  Assessed as psychiatrically stable, he
was discharged on November 24, 2015, for immediate admission to a private inpatient
alcohol-treatment facility for alcohol detoxification. The records from that private treatment
facility were not submitted in evidence, but the VA records show that he was discharged
from the inpatient facility on December 1, 2015. (AE C.)
While residing in a sober-housing situation, Applicant received follow-up recovery-
support treatment in a VA intensive outpatient program (IOP) from December 2, 2015, to
December 23, 2015, for diagnosed alcohol use disorder (severe) and PTSD. In reviewing
his  options  for  follow-up  care  with  his  recovery  support  team  on  December  17,  2015,
Applicant expressed a desire to continue individual therapy to address his negative life
experiences, as his felt his alcohol and drug use stemmed from “defective ability to cope.”
He did not believe group substance-abuse treatment would be helpful to him, although
medical records show that he had demonstrated active listening skills in group sessions.
He  was  discharged  on  December  23,  2015,  to  follow-up  with  counseling  until  a  dual-
diagnosis  program  became  available,  and  to  continue  with  his  VA  psychiatrist.  At
discharge, Applicant indicated that he was “considerably” confident in his ability to abstain
from alcohol and drugs. He denied any cravings to use alcohol or drugs in the prior 30
days. (AE C.)
During a session with his VA psychiatrist on January 12, 2016, Applicant reported
that he had abstained from alcohol for 50 days with no cravings. On January 26, 2016,
he  was  determined  to  be  not  a  good  candidate  for  a  certain  dual-diagnosis  program
because  his  medical  record  did  not  adequately  support  the  PTSD  diagnosis.  He  was
accepted into another program through the VA to start on May 26, 2016, or earlier, if a
slot became available. (AE C.)
Applicant agreed to participate in  a once-weekly continuing care program at the
VA,  but  he  never  started  the  program.  He  told  the  VA  he  was  on  active-duty  orders
through February 23, 2016, and was unable to attend. In lieu of that program, he attended
individual  therapy  outside  the  VA  setting.  His  therapist  advised  the  VA  that,  after  six
weeks  of  therapy,  she  considered  Applicant  to  be  in  the  “pre-contemplative  stage”
regarding  his  drinking  and  in  some  denial.  VA  records  show  that  Applicant  consumed
alcohol on at least February 14, 2016. (AE C.)
On March 4, 2016, Applicant was admitted to a six-week specialized inpatient dual-
diagnosis  program  at  a  VA  facility  for  diagnosed  alcohol  dependence  and  PTSD.  A
breathalyzer  test  on  admission  was  negative  for any  alcohol.  Applicant  interacted  well
with peers and staff and attended all groups and classes with good participation. Clinical
opinion was positive for Applicant’s development of goals toward an overall improvement
in his lifestyle and his challenges. He was discharged as scheduled on April 15, 2016,
with a plan to continue cognitive behavioral therapy with his private therapist.  During a
psychiatric visit at the VA on April 19, 2016, Applicant reported that he had maintained
sobriety. (AE C.)
On May 16, 2016, Applicant was assessed at the VA to see if an increase in his
service-connected disability was warranted due to his mental-health issues. He reported
no alcohol consumption since February 14, 2016, and was diagnosed, in part, with PTSD
and alcohol use disorder, severe, in early remission. (AE C.)
Applicant became employed as a clerk at a gas station in June 2016. He was fired
in March 2017 for a violation of his employer’s policies unrelated to drinking. (GEs 1-2.)
Applicant then held a part-time job in maintenance for a daycare facility until he started
his current employment in June 2017. (GE 1.) He denies any drinking around that time,
but admits that he did not take his recovery as seriously as he should have. (Tr. 26.-27.)
After not drinking for approximately 18 months (AE C), he began drinking socially, “a drink
now  and  then  at  dinner,”  in  the  summer  of  2017.  (Tr.  47.)  Applicant  thought  he  could
control his drinking. (Tr. 50.)
On his June 2018 SF 86, Applicant disclosed that he received treatment for PTSD
for  about  two  months  in  2016.  He  listed  his three  DUIs  and  one  violation  of  probation
offense. Concerning an SF 86 inquiry into whether his use of alcohol had any negative
impact on his work performance, professional or personal relationships, his finances, or
resulted in law enforcement intervention, Applicant indicated that, in addition to the DUIs,
alcohol caused him problems between September 2013 and September 2015 in that his
relationships  with  family and  friends  suffered.  He  disclosed  that  he had  participated  in
alcohol-rehabilitation programs at the VA between November 2015 and January 2016.
(GE 1.)
In  response  to  an  SF  86  illegal  drug  inquiry,  he  reported  that  he  used  cocaine
infrequently and only when drinking between September 2013 and September 2016. He
responded affirmatively to an SF 86 inquiry into whether his drug use occurred when he
possessed a  security clearance.  He explained  that he self-medicated  with  alcohol and
sometimes cocaine when he was in a “rough place” in his life, but that he had checked
himself  into  rehabilitation,  was  taking  medications  to  control  his  PTSD,  and  going  to
support groups for his PTSD.  He  added that he  had  ended  all ties to  people  who  use
illegal drugs and drink heavily, and he denied any intention of returning to that lifestyle.
(GE 1.)
On  August  10,  2018,  Applicant  had  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an
authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He related that
he  was  drinking  alcohol,  despite  previous  treatment  for  alcohol  use.  He  described  his
current  consumption  as  one  or  two  drinks  per  month  at  family  functions,  usually
celebrations, which he did not consider to be abusive. He stated  that he  would “never”
again consume alcohol to the point where it impacted him negatively. (GE 2.)
As for his cocaine use, Applicant recalled during his PSI that he last used cocaine
around September 2015 and not September 2016. He stated that he used cocaine about
five times, in bar settings, while he held a security clearance. He denied any intention to
use  cocaine  in  the  future  because  of  his  “current  career”  and  stated  that  he  had  no
ongoing association with individuals who use the drug. (GE 2.) Applicant now asserts that
his  cocaine  use  occurred  between  September  2014  and  September  2015,  when  a
positive drug screen for cocaine led to his discharge from the ARNG in February 2016.
(Tr. 41.) VA records show he tested positive for cocaine on May 18, 2014, and again on
November 22, 2015. (AE C.) He now recalls that he first used cocaine on his birthday in
March 2014 and last used cocaine before he entered the dual-diagnosis program, which
VA records show started on March 4, 2016. (AE C; Tr. 44) He told the clinicians in the
dual-diagnosis program that he last used cocaine on November 22, 2015. The evidence
substantiates  that  he  used  cocaine  on  occasion  between  March  2014  and  at  least
November 2015 rather than from September 2013 to September 2015 as reported on his
SF 86, or from September 2014 to September 2015 as stated during his PSI.
Applicant’s  drinking  eventually  progressed  to  every  other  day  after  work.  He
testified at his hearing that it was not that he lacked control over his drinking at that time,
but  he  “thought  it  was  on  that  path.”  (Tr.  47-49.)  On  December  5,  2019,  Applicant
contacted his VA psychiatrist and reported that “the drinking started back up” and that his
mental-health  medications  were  ineffective.  He  had  not  been  taking  his  psychiatric
medications. (AE B.)
On December 10, 2019, Applicant voluntarily sought treatment in the psychiatric
emergency room  at  the  VA for his alcohol use  disorder.  He felt  that  he  could  not  stop
drinking on his own and could not safely undergo detoxification at home. (Tr. 49-50.) He
was admitted overnight for observation prior to entering a substance-abuse day program.
A drug screen of December 10, 2019, detected no presence of illegal drugs. He reported
a last use of  cocaine some four years prior, but recent use of alcohol to a last use on
December 5, 2019. He described his drinking as “getting out of hand.” He used alcohol
to address issues of insomnia and anxiety, and reported consuming two bottles of vodka
every two to three days preceding his last use. He was discharged to a recovery-support
program  on December 11, 2019, with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  He was not
accepted for admission to a higher level of residential treatment as clinical opinion was
that his needs could be met at the lower level of care. (AE B.)
Applicant  attended  a  recovery-support  program,  which  included  group  day
sessions  starting  December  12,  2019,  in  the  same  substance-abuse  rehabilitation
program  he  had  attended  in  2015.  He  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependence,
uncomplicated.  His  family  and  friends  were  supportive  of  his  recovery,  and  he  felt
extremely confident throughout treatment that he would not use alcohol or illegal drugs.
Initially, he reported that he was slightly bothered by cravings or urges to use alcohol. He
attended  and  participated  in  all  aspects  of  the  program,  including  group  sessions  of
December  17,  2019,  in  which  the  importance  of  medication  compliance  was  stressed,
and  December  30.  2019,  in  which  attending  self-help  meetings  after  discharge  was
encouraged.  He  remained  abstinent  from  alcohol  and  illegal  drugs,  as  confirmed  by
negative urine screens and breathalyzer tests. Clinicians assessed him as able to identify
and discuss triggers and urges, and having developed good coping skills to avoid relapse.
Applicant requested to follow up the program in an evening IOP outside the VA network.
At discharge to his home on January 6, 2020, he was referred to a community resource
for assistance with securing an IOP. He also planned to see his private therapist and his
psychiatrist at the local VA primary-care clinic. (AE B.)
During a January 7, 2020 session with his VA psychiatrist, Applicant reported that
he  had  become  complacent  with  social  alcohol  use  and  so  took  action  to  stop  using
alcohol.  He  expressed his intention  to  pursue  an  evening  IOP  and denied  any current
cravings or urges to use alcohol. Concerning his mental-health medications, he admitted
that he had discontinued taking his Depakote on his own. He was continued on Adderall
and cleared to return to work. (AE B.)
Applicant testified that he attended an IOP three nights per week for two months.
(Tr. 27, 51.) Records of that program are not in evidence. In response to interrogatories,
on  January  21,  2021,  Applicant  stated  that  his  alcohol  and  drug  use  was  “more  of  an
escape from underlying PTSD issue.” He indicated that he was “seeking counseling for
mental health due to PTSD still.” (GE 2.)
On July 27, 2020, Applicant was diagnosed by the VA with adult attention deficit
hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD).  He  currently  takes  bupropion  for  a  mood  disorder
diagnosed in February 2021 and Ritalin for his ADHD. (AEs B-C; Tr. 79.) He is currently
on a maintenance schedule where he sees his VA-appointed psychiatrist every two or
three  months.  He  is  not  currently  receiving  therapy  from  a  therapist.  He  last  saw  the
private  therapist  in  Spring  2021,  and  he  has  been  looking  for  a  new  therapist  without
success. (Tr. 51, 84.) He has requested an appointment with his VA psychiatrist because
of  increased  depression  over  the  last  month.  (Tr.  80.)  Notwithstanding  his  history  of
drinking  to  self-medicate  mental-health  issues,  he  does  not  believe  he  is  at  risk  of
relapsing into alcohol. (Tr. 80.)
Applicant is not  involved  in any  self-help  meetings such  as  Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA), but he  has participated  about once  a  week in  an  online  program  Smart Recovery,
which he states instructs on “more  modern coping skills and  techniques.” (Tr. 52-53.) He
signed  onto  Smart Recovery  in January  2020. (Tr. 53.)  He  denies any  consumption  of
alcohol since  December 5, 2019, and  any  intention  to  drink alcohol in the future. (Tr. 27-
28.)  His girlfriend  and  family  are his primary  support system. (Tr. 53.)  He testified  that his
job is also a significant deterrent to relapse. (Tr. 81.)
Finances
Applicant’s finances began to suffer around 2014 and 2015, when he was drinking
heavily.  He  testified  that  all  of  his  money  went  to  fight  cancer.  (Tr.  54.)  Available  VA
records  do  not  show a  cancer diagnosis (AEs  B-C),  and  he  presented  no  evidence of
medical payments. Periods of unemployment were a factor in him being unable to meet
some of his expenses. (Tr. 54.)
Applicant  responded  affirmatively  on  his  June  2018  SF  86  to  inquiries  into  any
delinquency involving enforcement. He listed one debt of $20,000, for which his pay was
garnished. At the time, he believed it was a credit-card debt, but he recalled during his
August 2018 PSI that it was a car-loan deficiency balance. (GE 2.) About steps to satisfy
the debt, he indicated on his SF 86, “I had no clue about it. . . talking with lawyer to get it
resolved  sooner.”  He  answered  “No”  to  the  SF  86  questions  about  any  delinquency
involving  routine  accounts,  but  added,  “Besides  previously  stated  not  that  I  can
remember.” (GE 1.)
As  of  July  14,  2018,  Applicant’s  credit  report  (GE  5)  showed  the  delinquent
accounts listed in SOR ¶¶ 5.a.-5.j. As of April 9, 2020 (GE 4), his credit report showed an
additional  delinquency  (SOR  ¶  5.k).  The  delinquency  and  payment  histories  for  the
accounts are reflected in the following table:

During his August 2018 PSI, Applicant was confronted about the delinquencies on
his credit  report. About  the previously disclosed  garnishment, Applicant  stated  that his
wages were being garnished at 24% if his pay since March 2018 to recover a $20,000
deficiency balance on a  car loan  that he  thought  insurance had covered.  He  indicated
that  he  was  unaware  of  any  other delinquent  accounts,  and  when  confronted  with  the
adverse credit information on his credit report, he was unable to provide any details. He
expressed  an  intention  to  pay  off  his  legitimate  debts.  He  had  not  had  any  financial
counseling, but stated that he intended to get some help to address his debts. (GE 2.)
Applicant asserts that when  he  found  out  about  the  adverse credit  information  on
his credit record,  he  “tried  to  get one  of those  credit  consolidators and  figure it out  that
way, and  then  it  kind  of fell  off. [He] got  promoted  at work and  it wasn’t important to  [him],
so   [he]  neglected   it.”  (Tr.  55.)  In   his  January   2021   response   to   DOHA   interrogatories,
Applicant stated,  “1/2  of  all  debts  paid  and  working  with  lawyer for rest.” (GE  2.)  He  now
admits   that  it  was  not   until  he   received   the   SOR  that  he   realized   he   could  not  put   off
11
dealing with the debts any longer. (Tr. 55.) He maintains that he paid off some $30,000
in debt balances, including the car-loan debt in SOR ¶ 5.a, which was resolved through
garnishment. (Tr. 56.) He provided no documentation proving that any of the SOR debts
have been paid.
As of May 2022, Applicant was $387 past due on a $16,012 vehicle loan obtained
in August 2017. His account first became past due 30 days in December 2017. It was 90
days  past  due  in  January  2019,  December  2020,  and  January  2021.  The  loan  had  a
balance  of  $8,364  as  of  late  May  2022.  (AE  A.)  He  testified  about  the  May  2022
delinquency that his car payment was not debited properly from his bank account so the
bank rejected his payment. He paid $400 on July 4, 2022, to catch up. (Tr. 76.)
A credit-card account opened with a retailer in May 2021  was reported as being
120 days past due in February 2022, although it was current as of June 2022 with a $253
balance. A $22,122 vehicle loan cosigned by Applicant for his girlfriend in August 2017
had never been late. She made the $421 monthly payments on time and had reduced the
balance  to $6,303 as of  May 2022.  (AE A; Tr. 30.) As of  July 2022, a $148 debt from
February 2020 for his interlock device was in collection.  (AE A.) He maintains that the
debt has been paid. (Tr. 77.) As of July 2022, his credit rating was poor. (AE A.)
Applicant received a substantial increase in his salary from $68,000 to $104,000
annually on his promotion effective May 2, 2022, to a supervisory role at work. (Tr. 29,
67-68.)  As  of  his  July  2022  security  clearance  hearing,  he  was  researching  credit
specialists to resolve some of his past-due debts. (Tr. 29.) He receives a monthly disability
payment from the VA of $1,987. (Tr. 68.)
Applicant’s  cohabitant   girlfriend   is  a   paraprofessional  in  special  education   for  a
school district  during the academic school year. (Tr. 29.)  She did not finish out the  2021-
2022  school year because  of complications from  COVID she  suffered  in early  2022. (Tr.
68.)  When  she  was working, she  earned  $14.50  per hour for a  32-hour work week. (Tr.
82.)
Applicant  and  his girlfriend’s monthly  expenses  include  $2,000 for rent  (Tr. 69);
$377  and  $421  in  car  payments  (AE  A);  $100  for  Internet  service  (Tr.  70);  $89  for
cellphone service (Tr. 71); and $600 to $700 for gasoline. (Tr. 71.) He and his girlfriend
give  her  20-year-old  daughter about $200 a month for her  college expenses. She  is a
commuter student at a community college. (Tr. 82.) Applicant was recently billed $1,200
for emergency room services. (Tr. 71.) He testified that he has around $2,000 per month
available for food after paying his other obligations. (Tr. 72.) He indicated that he used
some of his discretionary income to remove five collections debts from his credit report
and to pay bills. (Tr. 72.) He has minimal savings of maybe “a couple” hundred, although
he expects his financial situation to improve with his recent increase in income. (Tr. 73.)
Applicant has  not had  any financial  counseling, even  though  he  testified  he  “definitely”
needs it. (Tr. 74.)

"Applicant is a 56-year-old process senior network systems engineer, employed by
a defense contractor since 2019. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1991. He married in
1994 and divorced in 2015. He remarried in 2018 and has two adult children. This is his
first security clearance application.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
December 2015, that was discharged in 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.a). Under Guideline H, Applicant
used marijuana with varying frequency from about October 2018 to present (SOR ¶ 2.a);
and that he intends to continue using marijuana (SOR ¶ 2.b). Applicant admitted the SOR
allegations with explanations.
Applicant explained in his Answer to the SOR, that he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy
on the advice of his attorney and by agreement in his divorce, to avoid lifetime alimony
payments to his ex-spouse. As part of the divorce decree, Applicant compiled joint credit-
card debts attributed to his marriage, and filed bankruptcy to extinguish the debts.  The
bankruptcy was discharged in in 2016, and he stated that since that time, he has never
been late on a payment, never failed to make a payment when due, and successfully met
all financial  obligations.  He  does  not  carry significant  debt  and  contributes  regularly to
savings and retirement accounts.
In  2017,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  Crohn’s  disease,  a  progressive
autoimmune  disease  that  affects  the  digestive  tract,  and  causes  inflammation,  pain,
scarring of intestinal tissue, nutritional deficiency, and immunodeficiency. In consultation
with his doctor, he began using medicinal cannabis in 2018 as a treatment that he claims
has  been  successful.  His  treatment  includes  extracted  oil  cannabis  capsules  in  12mg
doses, which he takes every evening, along with an anti-inflammatory prescription drug.
Applicant believes he is now tolerant of the marijuana and he no longer experiences any
physical or mental impairment from the cannabis capsules. Applicant has a state-issued
medical cannabis program card that permits him to legally purchase the cannabis in his
state. He intends to continue this course of treatment.
Marijuana  is  a  Schedule  I  substance  under  the  Controlled  Substances  Act,
meaning  that  it  has  a  high  potential  for  abuse,  no  currently  accepted  medical  use  in
treatment  in  the  United  States,  and  a  lack  of  accepted  safety  for  use  under  medical
supervision.  Although  some  states  within  the  United  States  have  allowed  the  use  of
marijuana for medicinal purpose, it is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that has the
federal authority to approve drugs for medicinal use in the U.S. To date, the FDA has not
approved  a  marketing application  for  any  marijuana  product  for  any  clinical  indication.
Consistent therewith, the FDA and DEA have concluded that marijuana has no federally
approved  medical  use  for  treatment  in  the  U.S.  and  thus  it  remains  as  a  Schedule  I
controlled substance under federal law. See, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Fact
Sheet; https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Marijuana-Cannabis-2020  0.pdf.
In addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of  National Intelligence
(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws
prohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state
can authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances
Act, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state
law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the
national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a  person’s disregard of  federal law
concerning  the  use,  sale,  or  manufacture  of  marijuana  remains  relevant  when  making
eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.

"Applicant is a 42-year-old employee for a DOD contractor who seeks  a security
clearance. He has been employed with the DOD contractor for 17 years. This is his first
time  applying  for  a  security  clearance.  He  was  asked  by  his  employer  to  submit  a
security clearance application so he can work on classified projects. His highest level of
education is a Master’s Degree. He is in a long-term relationship. He and his significant
other  live  with  their  son,  age  20  months.  (Tr.16-19;  Gov  1)  (Note:  The  facts  in  this
decision  do  not  specifically  describe  employment,  names  of  witnesses,  or  locations  in
order  to  protect  Applicant’s  and  his  family’s  privacy.  The  cited  sources  contain  more
specific information.)
Under the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana
with varying frequency from January 1999 to at least January 2020. (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 1,
Section 23 at 30) The SOR also alleges Applicant intends to use marijuana in the future.
(SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 1, Section 23 at 30).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted
the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  but  “.  .  .  with  amplifying  evidence  of  mitigating  conditions
having been met in the attached written reply, with exhibits. He denies SOR ¶ 1.b again
stating  he  has  “amplifying  evidence  of  mitigating  conditions  having  been  met.”
(Response to SOR)
Applicant voluntarily disclosed his past marijuana use to the Government during
his security clearance background  investigation.  On  his security clearance  application,
dated  March  27,  2020,  Applicant  indicated  that  he  used  marijuana  in  response  to
Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. He estimated that he used marijuana
from  January  1999  to  January  2020.  He  listed  the  nature  and  frequency  of  the
marijuana  use  as “Recreational, perhaps less than 10 times per year.”  (Gov 1. Section
23 at 30)
During the hearing Applicant testified that he started using marijuana in college.
His  use  was  more frequent  during  his  college  years.  After  college,  his marijuana  use
was  not  as  frequent.  Years  would  pass  where  he  did  not  use  marijuana.  He  used
marijuana  in  group  settings  where  marijuana  was  offered  to  him.  He  never  purchased
marijuana.  He  testified  that  he  listed  that  he  used  marijuana  “perhaps  less  than  10
times  per  year”  in  order  to  cover  all  of  the  instances  of  his marijuana  use.  He  did  not
want  to  be  accused  of  under-reporting  his  marijuana  use.  In  the  summary  of  his
background  investigation  interview, the  investigator states that, “Subject  confirmed  that
he  smoked  ten  times  per  year  from  1999  to  January  2020,  which  he  described  as
infrequent.”  This  summary  of  the  background  investigation  interview  was  prepared  by
the interviewer. (Gov 2)  Applicant did not have an opportunity to review the statement
for accuracy. He did not have the opportunity to swear that the statement is an accurate
representation of what occurred during the interview. Instead, it is an unsworn summary
of what the investigator claims transpired during the interview. Paragraph E3.1.17 of the
Directive states DOD personnel background reports of investigation cannot be received
without an authenticating witness. While Applicant did not object to Gov 2, I give Gov 2
less weight because it is unsworn and unauthenticated.
On his March 2020 security clearance application, Applicant wrote the following
response  to  the  question  about  his  intentional  future  use  of  marijuana:  “Recreational
marijuana,  as  desired,  with  similar  frequency  as  noted  above,  if  at  all.”  Applicant
testified that what he meant by this answer is that he may possibly use it in the future for
example,  should  marijuana  become  legal  in  the  future.  (Gov  1,  section  23  at  30)  The
unsworn  summary  of  Applicant’s  background  investigation  interview  mentioned  that
when asked about his plans for future use of marijuana, Applicant said it was  possible,
maybe. The investigator asked him about future use if it affected his security clearance
as well as it being illegal under state and federal law. Applicant replied that he has no
problem with not using marijuana.  His past marijuana use had no negative affect on his
personal and professional life.
Applicant  testified   his  last   use   of  marijuana   was  over  the   July   4th   weekend   in
2019.  He  and   his  wife   were  out  of   town   visiting   friends.  Someone   passed   around   a
marijuana  joint  during  a  gathering  and  Applicant used  it. Prior to  that,  he  recalls his last
use   of   marijuana   was  in  December  2016.  He   did  not  use   for  a   period   of   years  before
2016.  He   estimated   he   used   marijuana   perhaps   in   2010   or   2012.   (Tr.   32,  39)  On   his
March  2020,   security  clearance   application,  Applicant  estimated   his   last   use   of
marijuana  was in January  2020. Applicant testified  he  does not  recall  using  in January
2020, but  the  answers  on  his security  clearance  application  may  be  more  reliable  than
his present memory. This was his first time  completing  a  security  clearance  application
and  he  was providing  an  estimate.  He was trying  to  be  as truthful as possible.  (Tr. 34  -
37)
Applicant testified that during his subsequent background investigation interview,
the interviewer did not ask about specific dates. The investigator wrote in his unsworn
summary of the  interview: “Subject  confirmed  that he has smoked marijuana  about ten
times per year from 1999  to  January 2020, which he  described  as infrequent.” (Gov 2)
Applicant  testified:  “That  was  his  interpretation  from  our  phone  conversation.  So  he
Under  cross-
transcribed  that.  I  did  not  make  that  exact  statement.”  (Tr.47)
examination,  Department  Counsel  mentioned  that  Applicant  was  providing  a  different
answer. Applicant replied:
Okay, I cannot  - - I  would say  that  I  cannot recall  the exact statement that I
would  have   made   vocally   to   him   on   the   phone,  and  the  only   evidence   to
refer back to  that  is  what he  put on  there. But I  do  not necessarily agree
with   the   that  exact  vernacular  that’s  used   in   that  statement,   and   that   is
something  that I could  clarify. So  had  I had  –  had  I read  this - - And  by  the
way,  also  this  occurred   before  I  sought  any   counsel.  I  didn’t   really
understand  what - - about the  whole process there, but had  I read  this and
had  the  opportunity  to  have  follow-up  conversation  with  this interviewer, I
would  have   enjoyed   the   opportunity   to   clarify   some   of  these   statements.
(Tr. 47)
On April 2, 2021, Applicant signed a Statement of Intent declaring that he will not
illegally  use  any  drugs,  to  include  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  acknowledged  that  any
future  use  of  illegal  drugs  shall  constitute  grounds  for  revocation  of  his  security
clearance. (AE E).
On April 12, 2021, Applicant was seen by Dr. J.C., a psychiatrist, for a tele-video
visit.  The  appointment  lasted  one  hour.  Applicant  told  Dr.  J.C.  that  he  first  used
marijuana in college in 1999. Some years he did not use at all, other years he used less
than 10 times a year. He reported his use decreased over time since college, and was
always sporadic. He only used in social situations when it was offered to him. He never
purchased  marijuana.  He  denied  his  marijuana  usage  created  legal,  health,  social,
employment or financial issues. He denies cravings, withdrawal symptoms, or tolerance
related to marijuana use. He has never used marijuana at work or before work and has
never been under the influence of marijuana at work. He denies significant alcohol use.
He  drinks  socially and has on average  1-2  glasses  of  wine  a  week.  He mentioned his
newborn son has health problems. As a result, he has no desire to engage in substance
abuse  and  is  focused  on  healthy  lifestyle  changes.  He  denies  ever  being  treated  for
substance abuse. (AE E at 2-3)
Dr. J.C. concludes that based on Applicant’s reported history of cannabis use, he
does  not  meet  DSM-5  diagnostic  criteria  for  a  substance  use  disorder.  She  notes  he
reported  not using cannabis since late 2019 and has no plans to use marijuana in the
future.  He  is  focused  on  a  healthy  lifestyle,  caring  for  his  family  and  newborn  and
progressing in his career. She recommends no further treatment because he shows no
current  or  history  of  clinically  significant  distress  or  social/occupational/financial/health
impairment related to cannabis use or other substance use. (AE E at 3)
On May 3, 2021, and August 5, 2022, Applicant submitted samples of his urine to
test for illegal drugs, to include marijuana. Both samples tested negative. (AE E at 4-5)
Whole-Person Factors
Applicant’s  significant   other  provided   a   statement  on   his  behalf.  She   met
Applicant  in  2018.  She   currently   lives  with   him   and   their   infant  son.   She   describes
Applicant as   “exceptionally   well-reasoned,  responsible, and  trustworthy.”   They  recently
purchased   a   home.  When   their   son   was  born  five   weeks  early   in  December  2020,
Applicant  advocated   for  their   son   when   he   was  in  the   hospital.   He   fed   and   cared   for
their   son   when   he   was  so   small   that  he   could  hold   him   in  the   palm   of   his  hand.  She
moved  in  with  Applicant in  January  2020. The  last  time  she recalls seeing  Applicant  use
marijuana   was  at  a   party   over  the   4th   of   July   weekend   in  2019.  She   states  Applicant
wants  to   remove   himself  entirely   from   situations   where  people   may   be   using   illegal
substances or drinking  alcohol heavily. Applicant’s resolve  has only  strengthened  since
the   birth  of   their   son. He  is dedicated   to   being   an   exceptional role   model for their   son
and  she  is confident that he  will not use  marijuana  in the  future. (AE  D at 11-13). Six  of
Applicant’s  close   friends   and   colleagues  provided   letters  attesting   to   his  character,
trustworthiness,  and integrity. (AE  D  at 1-6, 14-18).
",True
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the Guideline H allegations,
with  explanations.  However,  his  admission  to  SOR  ¶  1.d  when  considered  with  his
explanation is essentially a denial and will be treated as such. He failed to address the
Guideline  E allegation  by  admitting  or denying  it.  Since  all the  Guideline  E  allegations
re-allege  the  same  underlying  conduct  as  alleged  under  Guideline  H,  I  will  treat
Applicant’s  Guideline H admissions/denial as applying to the Guideline E allegations. I
adopt  his  admissions  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is 46 years old.  He is divorced,  but  currently cohabitating with  his ex-
wife. They have  two  children, ages  18 and 19.  He works as  a  principal engineer for a
software  team.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  defense  contractor  since  2009.  He  also
worked for a defense contractor from 2001 to 2009. Both contractors are subject to the
drug-free  workplace  provisions  of  41  U.S.C.  701  et  seq.  Applicant  holds  a  bachelor’s
degree. He has held a security clearance since 2003. (Tr. 16-17, 27-28; GE 1, 4)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana from about  January
1994 to about March 2019; that he used and purchased marijuana from about January
1994 to about March 2019, while granted access to classified information; and that he
was  arrested for possession of  marijuana  in March  1996. (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e) The  same
allegations were cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR ¶ 2.a). The allegations in SOR
¶¶  1.a-1.c and 1.e  are established  by  Applicant’s  security clearance  application  (SCA)
admissions and his admissions in his SOR answer. (GE 1-2; SOR answer)
Applicant started using marijuana in approximately 1994 when he was 18 years
old.  He  continued  to  use  marijuana  intermittently  over  the  years  while  having  some
substantial  time  gaps  between  uses.  As  stated  above,  he  first  obtained  a  security
clearance in 2003 and he admitted using marijuana numerous times from 2003 to 2006
while  holding  a  clearance.  He  further  admitted  that  he  knew  in  2003  that  holding  a
security  clearance  and  using  marijuana  was  incompatible.  He  justified  his  use  of
marijuana by saying, although illegal, he did not think it was serious. He typically used
marijuana in a social setting with friends. He frequently visited a friend’s ranch every two
to three months where he used marijuana. (Tr. 21-25; GE 1)
Applicant  claimed  to  have  stopped  using  marijuana  for  some  unspecified  time,
but  he  admitted  resuming  his  use  in  2013  or  2014.  He  continued  his  use  at  the
frequency  of  twice  a  week  through  2021.  His  last  two  uses  were  in  April  2021  and
August 2021, both were after the issuance of his SOR. (Note: Applicant’s two 2021 uses
were not alleged in the SOR so I will not use that evidence for disqualification purposes,
however,  I  can  consider  it  in  assessing  Applicant’s  credibility,  in  determining  the
applicability  of  any  mitigating  conditions,  and  in  the  application  of  the  whole-person
factors.) He  admitted  to  purchasing marijuana  on  occasion.  He  continues  to  associate
with friends who use marijuana in his presence. Applicant denied using marijuana while
granted  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  failed  to  present  any
evidence  establishing  Applicant’s  use  of  marijuana  while  he  was  granted  access  to
classified  information  or  when  holding  a  sensitive  position.  (Tr.  27-28,  30-31;  GE  1;
SOR answer)
Applicant admitted to an investigator during his background investigation that he
intended to continue using marijuana in the future. In his SOR answer, he confirmed his
intention  to  continue  his  marijuana  use.  He  justified  his  position  by  stating  that
marijuana  provided  him  some  health  benefits  and  because  it  has  been  legalized  in
several states. During his hearing testimony, he stated he would not use in the future as
long as it remained illegal under Federal law. (Tr. 32, 37; SOR answer)
Applicant admitted his arrest in 1994 for marijuana possession. He was charged,
but the charges were later dismissed. He was required to complete community service.
He has not participated in a drug evaluation or counseling. (Tr. 34-35; GE 3)
Applicant  presented  documentation  reflecting  that  he  was  recognized  by  his
employer  as  an  outstanding  employee.  He  also  presented  several  years’  worth  of
performance appraisals where he was rated as “exceeding expectations.”
",False
"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  the  allegation  that  she  used
marijuana with varying frequency from about June 1995 to April 2020. Her admission is
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  42-year-old.  She  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  in
information  technology  (IT)  since  February  2020.  She  has  never  held  a  security
clearance.
Applicant believes she received her GED in September 1999.  She attended some
college courses in 1999 but did not receive a degree. She married in 2000 and has three
children.
When Applicant submitted her SCA in February 2020, she disclosed that she used
marijuana  from  about  June  1995  to  February  2020.  She  described  her use  from  June
1995 until 2000 as daily. She stated her more recent use was on occasion and that she
did not intend to use marijuana in the future because she did not want it to interfere with
her career. (FORM Item 2 at 33.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2020, she told
the investigator that from 2000 to the present she smoked marijuana three to four times
a week at her house. She disclosed she used hemp pills in 2019 to mitigate the pain from
a car accident and had stopped use when she no longer needed them. She was given an
opportunity to verify her April 2020 interview. She affirmed her interview in February 2021
and stated she had not used marijuana since “April 2020, nor do [I] have the want or need
to.” (FORM Item 3 at 3.)

"In answering both allegations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a and 1.b), Applicant denied that
the  drug  use  alleged  in  the  SOR  “caused  psychological  impairment  that  affected  [his]
reliability  and  trustworthiness.” During  his hearing  testimony,  when  asked  to  clarify  his
answers,  he  admitted  both  SOR  allegations.  (Tr.  26)  His  admissions  are  incorporated
into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. He graduated from high school in 1998 and earned a
bachelor’s  degree  in  2004.  He  has  never  married  and  has  no  children.  Applicant  has
spent most of his professional career as an engineer in the aerospace field. He worked
for  an  aerospace  company,  contractor A,  between  2006  and  2017  in  state  1.  He  then
left  the  industry  and  managed  his  own  automotive  consulting  firm  from  2017  to  2019.
When  that  opportunity  ended,  he  returned  to  the  aerospace  industry,  with  another
company  for  whom  he  has  worked  since  June  2019.  He  earns  a  $131,000  annual
salary. He now lives in state 2. (GE 1; Tr. 20-24, 27-29, 33, 43-47)
On   his  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed   marijuana   use   between   about  June   1994   to
about July  2019. He reported  using  marijuana  daily  while  in college. Applicant disclosed
on   his  SCA  that  while   employed   with   contractor  A,  he   used   marijuana   “much   more
infrequently. I quit for many  years due  to  random  testing  (about 2014  to  2017)”  (GE 1  at
35) After leaving  contractor A  in 2017, he  reported  that he  “used  it daily  for two  years. I
then   mostly   quit”  and   used   it   only   rarely.  In   the   nine   months  before   submitting   his
September  2019   SCA,   he   used   marijuana   once,  at  a   friend’s  birthday   party.  Applicant
said he  was no  longer interested  in using  marijuana  and  no  longer associates with  old
friends. He did not indicate  that he  had  used  marijuana  use  while  possessing  a  security
clearance. (GE 1 at 35-36)
Applicant  was  granted  a  DOD  security  clearance  through  DOD  in  either  about
September 2007 (GE 1 at 39) or soon thereafter, in 2008. (Tr. 34) He left Contractor A
in February 2017 to start his own company. (GE 1 at 16) Applicant acknowledged using
marijuana while at defense contractor A. He also acknowledged using marijuana with a
clearance and while the company had a drug policy in place. He further acknowledged
knowing marijuana use is not considered lawful use under federal law. (Tr. 30; GE 3)
Government  Exhibit  3  details  the  substance  abuse  policy  of  contractor  A,  as  of
August 21, 2015. It includes the following:
[Contractor  A]  follows  substance  abuse  policies  and  procedures  that  are
appropriate to the work environments, business conditions, and the overall
interests  of  the  Company.  Implementation  of  this  Policy  is  subject  to
restrictions  contained  in  federal  laws,  and  to  the  extent  not  inconsistent
with  federal  government  contractor  requirements,  state  and  local  laws.
(GE 3 at 2)
Policy: 1: Whenever employees are working, are operating [Contractor A]
equipment  or  vehicles,  are  present  on  [Contractor  A]  premises,  or  are
conducting company-related work off-site, they are prohibited from:
Using,  possessing,  buying  selling,  manufacturing,  or  dispensing  illegal
drugs (as defined under federal law and this Policy, including possession
of drug paraphernalia;  . . . . (GE 3 at 2)
*  *  *  *
3.  Marijuana:  Despite   state   laws  legalizing   recreational  marijuana   or
medicinal  use   (including   Washington   and   the   District  of   Columbia)
recreational  use   of  marijuana   or  use   of  medicinal  marijuana   is  not
considered  lawful possession  or use,  as  a  prescription  drug  or otherwise,
because  marijuana  is a  prohibited  controlled  substance  under federal law.
See, e.g., DOT  [U.S. Department of  Transportation] regulations, 49  C.F.R.
§40.151. (GE 3 at 2-3)
Contractor  A’s  policy  regarding  Random  Drug  Testing  is,  in  pertinent  part,  as
follows:  “.  .  .  Employees  who  hold  a  security  clearance,  or  are  assigned  to  safety-
sensitive and/or sensitive positions . . . are subject to random drug testing.” (GE 3 at 5)
The term “Sensitive Position” is defined in Contractor A’s policy as:
An  employee  who  has  been  granted  access  to  classified  information,  or
employees  in  other  positions  that  the  contractor  determines  involves
national security,  health  and  safety,  or functions other than the foregoing
requiring a high degree of trust and confidence. (GE 3 at 9)
Applicant  testified   that  after  about   2013   or  2014,   though   he   remained   with
contractor A   until 2017,  he   no   longer needed   access to   classified  information.   (Tr. 20-
21) Afterwards,  he  said  he  used  marijuana  “very  infrequently,” which, when  pressed, he
said meant “never”  because  it  “became  far too  dangerous  to  continue  the  behavior,” so
he   stopped.   (Tr. 41)  He   then   said  during   that  timeframe,  he   “effectively   quit”  but  used
marijuana perhaps once  around  Christmas during  those  years, and  “I may  have  smoked
it and immediately regretted it” because he  was filled with  the  fear of testing positive due
to  the  increased  frequency  of  random  testing. (Tr. 41-42)  Applicant said,  “If  I had  tested
positive  during  the  random  drug  test,  they  would have  fired  me.” (Tr. 37) He  knew  that
even  though  marijuana  use  was legal in state  1  at  the  time,  it was illegal under federal
law. (Tr. 35-36; GE  3 at 2-3)
Applicant  explained  that  his  understanding  of  the  company’s  drug  policy  was,
“what I did during the off-hours, as long as it did not affect my ability to do my job, were
my  business,  such  as  going  to  a  barbeque  and  having  some  beers,  and,  you  know,
getting a little tipsy.” (Tr. 38) With respect to off-hours drug use, Applicant said, “I did it
with enough infrequency to ensure that I would pass testing and that – I’ve never failed
a test;” and, “As long as you are above the limit, you are OK. And with respect to that, if
you  do  it  infrequently  enough,  it  does  leave  your  system  rather  quickly,  which  was  I
suppose my thought process there. But not – again, it was done with quite of bit of risk,
obviously.” (Tr. 39, 40)
Applicant  explained   that  his  rationale   for  using   drugs  in   violation   of  company
policy   was  because   “we   were  supposed   to   report  any   unusual  behavior…  and   as  a
result  of   having   no   change   in  behavior,  then   there  was  nothing   different  about  my
behavior in any  way  for my  entire tenure there. And  the  frequency  was very  infrequent
because of  the fear of random drug  testing.” (Tr. 30-31) As a  result of  increased  random
drug   testing,  he   ceased   marijuana   use   for  several  years  for fear  of   losing   his  job.  (Tr.
31, 40)  Applicant  is unaware whether his current employer has a  drug  policy, though   it
is  a  federal contractor. He has never been  drug tested  there. (Tr. 51)
Applicant reported on his SCA that he left the aerospace industry in March 2017.
(GE  1  at  16)  He  did  not  have  access  to  classified  information  after  that.  He  resumed
using marijuana on a daily basis from then until fall 2019, when he was not in classified
position, while working for his own company. (Tr. 29, 42-43, 46) He then decided to “get
serious and stop bad stuff” as he prepared to reenter the job market. (Tr. 46-47)
In  2019,  Applicant  moved  to  state  2,  where  marijuana  use  is  also  legal,  for  his
current job. He said he severed most of his social ties and negative influences, and he
no  longer has an interest  in using marijuana.  (Tr. 20-24, 32)  His last  use of  marijuana
was  in  July  2019,  after  waking  up  feeling  “pretty  bad”  (i.e.,  hung  over)  after  a  night  of
drinking  with  friends.  (Tr.  45,  GE  2)  He  termed  this  a  “terrible  mistake  because  I  had
been clean for six months at that point.” (Tr. 32-33)
Applicant denied using any other controlled substances. He said there was “zero”
chance  of  future  drug use  while  holding  a  clearance.  (Tr. 33)  He  asserted  that  his life
has changed  since  he  took  his  current  job  and  moved  to  a  new  state  in  2019. He  said
he  is  no  longer close  to  his  old  friends  with  whom  he  used  to  use  marijuana.  He  is now
a   homeowner  and   has  a   good   job   in  his   specific  field.  He   is  dedicated   to   the   United
States   and   recognizes  the   importance   of  his   work. (Tr. 49-50,   57, 63-64,   66)   After the
hearing, Applicant submitted  a  statement of  intent to  abstain  from  the  use  of  marijuana
in any  form, “regardless of legal status,  for the rest of my days.” (AE A)
Two longtime co-workers of Applicant’s attested  to his work ethic and  dedicated
professionalism.  He  works  well  with  others  and  goes  above  and  beyond  what  is
expected  to  teach  and  train  others.  He  is  an  asset  to  the  team  and  he  has  an
understanding of the importance of confidentiality and proprietary information. (AE B)

"In  his  answer  to  the  SOR, Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  contained  in SOR  ¶¶
1.a  1. b, 2.a,  and  2.c. He denied  the  allegations  in SOR ¶¶  2.b, and  3.a  through  3.f. His
admissions  are accepted as  findings of fact.
Applicant is 27 years old. He graduated from high school in 2013. He served on
active  duty  in  the  Army  from  June  2013  to  March  2018,  at  which  time  he  received  an
honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while serving.  He has been married
since  2017.  He and his  wife  have  one child. (GE  1)  Between 2019  and  2020, he  took
online  courses  in  information  technology  (IT).  He  is  currently  enrolled  in  college  and
pursuing a bachelor’s degree in IT. He anticipates graduating in 2023. (Tr. 22-24)
After his discharge from the Army in March 2018, Applicant worked for a federal
contractor for two months and then for a trucking company for six months. In December
2018,  he  started  a  position  with  the  Army  as  an  operating  room  nursing  assistant.  He
worked there until October 25, 2019, when he was fired during his probationary period for
testing positive for marijuana. He held a security clearance at the time he was fired. He
then became self-employed as a driver for restaurants until he secured a position with
another federal contractor. (Tr. 16; GE 1 at 33-34)
In  March  2020,  Applicant  submitted  an  e-QIP,  requesting  eligibility  to  hold  a
sensitive  position.  In  April  2020,  Applicant  started  employment  with  another  federal
contractor for which he needs eligibility to occupy a position of public trust.
Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
In his March 26, 2020 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed the following information:
(1)  Under   Section   13A   -  Employment  Activities,  he  disclosed  that  in  October
2019 he was fired from the Army for “Probationary Termination.” (GE 1 at 15)
(2)  Under  Section   23   –   Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug   Activity,  he   disclosed   that
within  the   past  seven   years  he   illegally   used   drugs.  He   reported   that  he   used
“Recreational and  Medication  CBD W/THC below  the  Threshold” from  “January  2019  to
June  2019  (Estimated).”  (GE 1  at 31) He  stated  that he  used  it  while  visiting  another state.
He noted  that he  used  it to  alleviate  pain. He  disclosed  that he  used  it  while  possessing
a security clearance and that he  did not intend to  use it in the  future.  (GE 1  at 31, 32)
(3)  Section  23  –  Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, While Possessing a Security
Clearance,  inquired:  “Have  you  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been  illegally  involved
with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security  clearance  other  than
previously listed,” Applicant answered “no.” (GE 1 at 32)
In May 2020, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about his illegal drug
use and other background issues. Applicant discussed using marijuana while employed
at the Army hospital. He told the investigator that in September 2019, he tested positive
for marijuana while employed with the Army, which resulted in his termination. Applicant
stated that after his supervisor notified him  of his positive  drug test, he was placed on
administrative leave and terminated on October 25, 2019. He showed the investigator the
termination notice. (GE 2 at 3)
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  used  marijuana  about  eight  times  and
cannabidiol, a chemical found in marijuana (CBD), twice. He used CBD oil for insomnia
and migraines. He did not have a medical marijuana card. He purchased marijuana from
a stranger. He acknowledged that his use of marijuana and CBD was the reason for his
termination. He said he did not intend to use it in the future. (GE 2 at 5)
Subsequent to his interview, the Government sent Applicant Interrogatories, which
incorporated the report of his May 2020 interview and asked him to verify the accuracy of
the information in that report. Applicant confirmed that the information was accurate. In
addition,  the  Government  asked  him  to  complete  Interrogatories  which  asked  the
following  question:  “In  your  interview,  you  disclosed  that  you  used  marijuana  between
January  2019  and  August  2019.  Have  you  used  marijuana  since  then?”  Applicant
answered “no.” (GE 2 at 10) In response to two other questions, he reported that he did
not intend to use marijuana in the future and that he no longer associates with the people
with whom he used it. (Id.)
Applicant testified that he knew as a surgical assistant and as a federal employee
holding  a  security  clearance,  he  was  prohibited  from  using  marijuana  or  any  illegal
substance.  He  understood  the  adverse  consequences  of  buying  and  using  marijuana
while  employed  in  his  position.  He  started  using  it  because  he  witnessed  gruesome
trauma surgeries, which caused him serious emotional distress that he chose to manage
with  marijuana. (Tr. 25-33; GE 2  at 5) He said  that he used marijuana for recreational
purposes and CBD oil for medical purposes. (Tr. 33)
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  post-traumatic stress  syndrome  (PTSD) in  March
2018,  prior  to  his discharge  from  the  Army.  He  continues  to  suffer from  it.  After  being
diagnosed  with  PTSD,  he  began  participating  in  therapy  once  a  week  for  about  two
months  with  a  psychologist  at  the  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  hospital.  He  has  continued  to
participate in some form of treatment over the past four years. His therapist recommended
that he not use marijuana. He has never been referred to a psychiatrist for medication,
although he said he has requested it. He has continued to use marijuana monthly since
2019. He used it a week before this hearing and intends to continue using it. (Tr. 35-41,
54; GE 2)
Personal Conduct
Applicant admitted that he was fired from his employment at the Department of
the Army in about October 2019 for testing positive for marijuana, and was not eligible for
rehire, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. (Answer)
Applicant denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.b, which alleged he deliberately failed
to  disclose  in  Section  23  –  Illegal  Use  of  Drug  Activity  of  his  March  2020  e-QIP  the
information set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a: He used marijuana with varying frequency, from about
January 2019 to about August 2019, while granted access to classified information. He
stated that he disclosed his illegal drug use under Section 23 in his e-QIP. In addition,
Applicant  asserted  that  he  gave  all  of  the  information  surrounding  his  drug  use  and
termination to the investigator during his May 2020 interview. (Answer)
Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.c that alleged he intentionally failed
to disclose under Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drug Activity, While Possessing a Security
Clearance, that he illegally used a drug while possessing a security clearance. Applicant
admitted that he did not disclose the information under this heading because he disclosed
it in the previous paragraph in Section 23. (Answer)
Financial Considerations
Based  on  credit  bureau  reports  from  October  2018,  May  2020,  April  2021,  and
February 2022, the SOR alleged six delinquent debts, which became delinquent between
2017 and 2021. (GE 3, 4, 5, and 6) They total  $12,154. In his Answer to the SOR, he
denied owing all six debts because his mortgage company required him to resolve all of
his delinquent debts before applying for a mortgage to purchase a home. (Answer) The
status of each debt is as follows:
(3.a) Applicant said that this  charged-off  credit card debt for $12,044  was settled
for  less  and   paid  after   the   creditor  obtained   a   judgment  and   then   a   lien.  He  said  the
account became  delinquent before he  started  working  for  the  Army  because  he  could  not
afford to pay it.  He  said he settled it prior to  May 24, 2021, the  day  he closed on  a  home.
(Tr. 41-45; AE  G)  He agreed  to  submit proof  of  the  settlement and  payment, but did not
do so.  It is not resolved.
(3.b) Applicant  said  the  charged-off  $3,137  motorcycle loan  was a  personal  loan
he  obtained  in 2016. He  settled  the  debt and  paid it.  He thinks he  received  a  Cancellation
of  Debt document from  the  creditor  in the  amount of the  loan. (Tr.  46-49)  He agreed  to
submit documents verifying that it was resolved, but did not do so.  It is not resolved.
(3.c) Applicant negotiated a settlement of $1,600 for the $2,805 collection account
owed to LVNV. He paid the debt in February 2021. (Tr. 49-50; AE F, AE J) It is resolved.
(3.d) The $1,273 collections account owed to LVNV for a mattress was paid and
settled for $1,018 after the creditor sued Applicant. (Tr. 50-51; AE K) It is resolved.
(3.e) The $1,009 collections account is owed to an apartment complex for unpaid
rent. Applicant said he paid it and would submit a receipt. (Tr. 52) He did not provide a
receipt. It is not resolved.
(3.f)   The  $886  collections  account  is owed  to  a  jewelry store.  Applicant  said he
resolved  it  and  would  provide  proof  of  payment.  (Tr.  53)  He  did  not  submit  any
documentation. The debt is not resolved.
Applicant  stated  that  some  of  the  above  accounts  began  accumulating  prior  to
2018, when he started working for the Army hospital. He said that he was spending more
money than he was earning. (Tr. 42) He began addressing his delinquent debts in 2021
because he wanted to repair his credit  so he could purchase a house, which he did in
May 2021.  (Tr. 52) His  income  is  now stable.  He  started  receiving disability payments
from the VA in September 2019. His initial disability rating was 90 per cent. In December
2019, the rating was raised to 100 percent. He receives $4,000 each month, which is tax
free.  (AE  D) In  April 2020,  Applicant  started  a  position  with  a  federal  contractor as  an
infrastructure monitoring analyst. (Tr. 15-18)
As of December 15, 2021, Applicant had earned about $55,800. (AE A) In January
2021, he completed a homeownership education course with Fannie Mae. (AE E)
Mitigation
While serving in the Army, he received two Army Achievement Medals, a National
Defense  Service  Medal,  and  the  Army  Service  Ribbon.  He  served  in  management
positions and conducted service trainings for patient healthcare. (Tr. 20-21)

"Applicant is 29 years old. He is a December 2016 college graduate. Applicant has
never  married  and  has  no  children.  Since  October  2018,  he  has  been  employed  by  a
defense contractor. (Item 3.)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant:  (1)  used  marijuana  with
varying  frequency,  from  April  2011  to  about  April  2020;  and  (2)  stated  he  intended  to
continue using marijuana but would reconsider if he were granted a security clearance.
(Item 1.)
Applicant admitted the Guideline H allegations, with explanations. He admitted that
he used marijuana from April 2011 to April 2020.  Applicant explained that “early in college
[he]  identified  his  use  as  a  problem”  and  took  “steps  to  control  [his]  use,  reduce  the
frequency, and limit its impact on [his] personal growth.” Applicant “only uses it on Fridays
and Saturdays” and can expand those limits. (Item 3.)
In  Applicant’s May  29,  2020  Personal  Subject  Interview  (PSI), Applicant stated  that
he  had  intended  to  keep  using  until he  learned  it was illegal under federal law. Applicant
now  intends to  stop  using  “to  stay  in compliance  with  federal law  and  his future  security
clearance.” He plans to  stop  using   “the  day  of  the  [PSI] and  feels   it will only   be  a  little
difficult to stop.” (Item  5.)
In his February 15, 2022 Answer, Applicant said he had used marijuana recently.
When  he  started  the  position  of  trust  process  (April  2020),  Applicant  stopped  his  use
completely for eight months, anticipating being cleared for a position of trust. In December
2020,  however,  he  became  impatient  and  started  using  marijuana  again.  Applicant
intended  to  continue  using  marijuana  on  Fridays  and  Saturdays  unless  “a  Security
Clearance … explicitly forbids it then I would be willing to reconsider.” (Item 3.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  public  trust  position.  As  the
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability  for  a  public  trust  position,  an
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are
flexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the
whole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable
information  about the  person,  past and  present,  favorable  and  unfavorable,  in  making  a
decision.   The   protection   of   the   national  security   is  the   paramount   consideration.  AG  ¶
2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny   doubt  concerning   personnel  being   considered   for  national
security eligibility  will be resolved in  favor of the national security.”
Under Directive  ¶  E3.1.14, the  Government must present evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by  applicant  or proven  by  Department  Counsel. . ..” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of  persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement and Substance  Abuse
Under AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into
question a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG
¶ 24 sets forth the concern, as follows:
The illegal use  of controlled substances, to  include the  misuse of prescription
and   non-prescription   drugs,  and   the   use   of   other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental  impairment or are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent with  their
intended   purpose   can   raise   questions  about  an   individual's  reliability   and
trustworthiness,  both   because   such   behavior  may   lead   to   physical  or
psychological  impairment   and   because   it  raises  questions  about   a   person's
ability   or  willingness  to   comply   with   laws,  rules,   and   regulations.  Controlled
substance   means   any   ""controlled   substance""   as   defined   in   21   U.S.C.§   802.
Substance  misuse  is the  generic term  adopted  in this guideline  to  describe  any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions or factors:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);
AG ¶  25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . .  and
AG ¶  25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance
abuse,  or  failure  to  clearly  and  convincingly  commit  to  discontinue  such
misuse.
The only potentially applicable mitigating factor here is quoted below:
AG  ¶   26(a)  the   behavior  happened   so   long   ago,  was  so   infrequent,  or
happened  under such  circumstances that it is unlikely  to  recur or does not
cast  doubt  on   the   individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment.
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated
by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. § 811 et seq.
The knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and
punishable  by  imprisonment,  a  fine  or  both. 21  U.S.C.  §  844.  In  an  October  25,  2014
memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is
a security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of  National Intelligence, Memorandum:
Adherence  to  Federal  Laws  Prohibiting  Marijuana  Use  (October  25,  2014).  See  also
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml
More recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed
the memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana
for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal
law  remains  unchanged  with  respect  to  the  illegal  use,  possession,  production  and
distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited  by  law  from  using  controlled  substances.  Disregard  of  federal  law
pertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal, or recreational marijuana use) remains
relevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use
the “whole-person concept” stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant’s
behavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
Applicant  admitted  using marijuana with  varying frequency from about April 2011
until  April  2020,  May  2020,  or  December  2020  (or  thereafter).  The  exact  end  date  is
unclear and immaterial. In any event, Applicant was a regular user of marijuana for nine
years or more. In addition, if Applicant did stop in April 2020, he had difficulty continuing
his cessation, resuming use in December 2020. Furthermore, his history of use shows a
failure to control the habit, even when confronted with the potential inability to obtain a
qualification  that  may  be  necessary  for  his  continued  employment  or  professional
advancement. Facts admitted by an applicant in an Application, an answer to an SOR, or
in an interview require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at
4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995). Applicant’s years of past use of marijuana trigger disqualifying
conditions AG ¶¶ 25(a) and (c). In addition, Applicant suggested he  would “reconsider”
stopping using marijuana, if his position “explicitly forbids it.” Applicant did not “clearly and
convincingly commit to discontinue” marijuana use. AG ¶¶ 25(g) applies.
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(a). Applicant began using marijuana
more than 11 years ago. Therefore, the inception of his use was long ago. Applicant has,
however, continued his regular, and not infrequent, use until April 2020, at the earliest.
And  Applicant  may  continue  to  use  marijuana,  unless  it  is  expressly  forbidden  by  the
position  of  trust  for  which  he  has  applied.  His  history  of  use  shows  an  inability  or
unwillingness  to  comply  with  federal  law  and  casts  doubt  on  his  trustworthiness  and
reliability. Applicant’s use of marijuana is not mitigated by AG ¶ 26(a).
Whole-Person Concept
The  record  raises  doubt  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  judgment,
and  ability  to  protect  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not
met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to sensitive information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a.- 1.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant access to sensitive information.

"The  SOR alleges under Guideline  H that Applicant purchased  and  used  marijuana
with  varying  frequency  from  approximately  June  2012  through  at least April 2021  (SOR  ¶
1.a)   and   that  on   her   February   7,  2020   Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing (SF 86), during  her March 20, 2020  personnel subject  interview  (PSI), and in
her May  13, 2021  response  to  interrogatories, she  expressed   her intention  to  continue
using  marijuana  (SOR ¶  1.b). Additionally, under Guideline  H, Applicant allegedly  used
Adderall  without a  prescription  from  about September 2012  through  at least June  2019
(SOR ¶  1.c),  and  cocaine  with  varying  frequency  from  about March 2017  through  at least
March 2020  (SOR ¶  1.d); and  she  expressed  during  her March 2020  PSI her intention  to
use cocaine in the future (SOR ¶ 1.e).
Applicant provided a detailed response to the SOR in which she admitted the use
and purchases of marijuana, explaining that all of her purchases were made legally, and
that she plans to continue “occasional recreational marijuana use.” She also admitted that
she used Adderall without a prescription while she was a full-time engineering student; that
she  used  cocaine  infrequently  for  recreational purposes  in  the  past;  and  that  she  had
stated during her March 2020 PSI that she intended to use cocaine in the future. However,
she explained that her life has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic and that she no
longer plans to use cocaine in the future.
Applicant’s admissions to the drug use and purchases and to intending to continue
using marijuana are accepted and incorporated in my factual findings. After considering the
pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 26-year-old project engineer with a bachelor’s degree earned in May
2019.  (GE  1;  Tr.  21.)  She  began  pursuing  a  master’s  degree  in  January  2022  and
maintains  a  grade  point  average  of  3.85  on  a  4.00  scale.  (Tr.  15,  30.)  She  has  never
married and has no children. (GE 1.)
Applicant worked for her current employer, a defense contractor, as a co-op student
for two semesters, from January 2017 to August 2017 and from January 2018 to August
2018, before becoming a full-time employee in July 2019.  (GE 1.) Applicant seeks her first
DOD security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 21.) On February 7, 2020, she completed and certified
as accurate an SF 86 on which she disclosed a history of marijuana, Adderall, and cocaine
use and marijuana purchases. (GE 1.) The salient details follow.
Marijuana
Applicant began using marijuana around June 2012 during the summer following her
sophomore year of high school. She used marijuana once or twice a month with a friend,
who  provided  the  marijuana  that  they  smoked  together  in  the  friend’s  basement  or
backyard. After high school, Applicant attended a private college in her home state, which
had not legalized marijuana use. Applicant used marijuana on a limited basis, about once
or  twice  a  month  recreationally  with  three  college  friends,  during  her  freshman  and
sophomore years of college. (Tr. 33.) In 2017, Applicant began to use marijuana illegally
once or twice a week (GE 2), although she abstained from marijuana during the two co-op
internships with her current employer. (Tr. 33.) She did not purchase marijuana in college.
She obtained the drug from one of the friends and paid for dinner for him in exchange for
the marijuana. (Tr. 23.)
After college, Applicant moved for her job to her current locale. She passed a pre-
employment drug screen for her employer when she became a full-time employee. (Tr. 34.)
Since  then, she  has used  marijuana  in her residence  while  socializing  with  her  sister
or with  two  friends, and  also to  relax  before bed. She  used  marijuana  on  average  twice a
week, although  after she  began  graduate  studies  in January  2022, her involvement with
marijuana  declined  to  “a little less than  once  a   week.” She  used  marijuana  “often  as a
replacement for alcohol,”  as she  experiences worse side  effects from  alcohol.  (Tr. 32, 35-
36.) She  purchased  the  marijuana  she  used  from  licensed  cannabis dispensaries in an
adjacent state. (GEs 1-2.)  She  testified  that she  would not be  using  marijuana  currently  if it
was illegal to purchase it. (Tr. 23.)
On  her  February  2020  SF  86,  Applicant  estimated  that  she  used  marijuana  to
January  2020  “most  likely”  more  than  50  times.  She  answered  “Yes”  with  respect  to
whether she intended to use marijuana in the future, and added, “Recreational use may
continue  in  social  circumstances.”  Applicant  also  disclosed  on  her  SF  86  that  she
purchased marijuana illegally one to two times a year between September 2017 and June
2019, when she was “too far away from a state [in] which this was legal.” She denied any
intention to purchase marijuana illegally in the future. (GE 1.)
On  March  20,  2020,  Applicant  was  interviewed  telephonically  by  an  authorized
investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During her PSI, Applicant
admitted that she had continued to use marijuana to as recently as the weekend preceding
her interview. She expressed an intention to continue to use marijuana and related that she
had made no attempts to stop or reduce her drug use. (GE 2.)
On May 13, 2021, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories about her drug use.
She reported that she had used marijuana over 100 times; that she had purchased the
drug;  and  that  she  intends  to  continue  to  use  the  drug.  She  explained  that  she  had
purchased marijuana legally from dispensaries and then transported it to her home and
that  she  currently  had  marijuana  obtained  from  a  dispensary  as  well  as  marijuana
paraphernalia in her home. (GE 2.)
On July 7, 2021, in response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that she had used
marijuana, but she also stated that she had not performed any work-related tasks while
under  the  influence  of  the  drug.  She  added  that  “all  marijuana  purchases  were  legal
through the state where purchased.” She expressed an intention to continue occasional
recreational marijuana use, and she was currently using the drug as a sleep aid. She did
not consider her marijuana use to be detrimental to her life, work performance, or her
ability to complete tasks that would be required of her if she is granted security clearance
eligibility. She explained that marijuana has been legalized in the state where she resides
and works, and that she would continue to use the drug responsibly. She stated that, if
necessary, she could stop using marijuana “as [she had] done in the past.”
At  her  hearing,  Applicant  admitted  that  she  continued  to  use  marijuana  to  as
recently as late May 2022, about seven days before her hearing (Tr. 17-18), and that she
intends to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 30.) She purchased the drug herself and used it
alone in her residence. (Tr. 17-18.) Her rationale is that marijuana is legal in her state, and
she has always purchased it legally from dispensaries in an adjacent state. (Tr. 15.)
Applicant  is  subject  to  random  drug  tests  at  work.  (Tr.  34.)  She  had  not  used
marijuana while working, and her marijuana use has not led to any involvement with law
enforcement. While she knows that marijuana is an illegal drug under federal law (Tr. 16,
18), and she has realized since her March 2020 PSI that using marijuana is incompatible
with  holding  a  security  clearance  (Tr.  19),  she  does  not  believe  that  her  character  or
trustworthiness should be judged based on “a measure that has been deemed appropriate
by many lawmakers.” (Tr. 16, 20.) While Applicant is still friendly with the persons with
whom she used marijuana recreationally in the past, she does not live near them and has
had limited contact with them since the  COVID pandemic started in 2020. (Tr. 25-27.)
Applicant’s sister has been around Applicant when Applicant has used marijuana, but she
does not use marijuana herself. (Tr. 33.)
Adderall
Applicant used Adderall without a prescription as a study aid from approximately
September 2012 to 2015 one to five times a year and from 2015 through May 2019 once a
week. In high school, she obtained the drug from her sister. In college, she obtained the
drug from the same friend who gave her marijuana, and she bought him coffee or dinner in
exchange for the Adderall. (GE 2; Tr. 28-29.) Applicant estimates that she used Adderall
more than 50 times total during high school and college. (GEs 1-2.) On her SF 86, during
her PSI, in response to DOHA interrogatories, in response to the SOR, and at her hearing,
Applicant denied any intention to use Adderall in the future. (GEs 1-2; Answer; Tr. 14.) She
understands that she should not have used Adderall without a prescription to help her
study. (Answer.)
Cocaine
Applicant used cocaine with her sister five times a year between March 2017 and
March 2020. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 27.) She used cocaine before going out to bars when visiting
her sister. She also used it in her residence when her sister visited her. Applicant did not
purchase any of the cocaine that she used. (GE 2.)
On  her February  2020  SF 86, Applicant denied  any  intention  to  use  cocaine  in the
future, and  stated, “No  longer intend  to  use  this drug, no  longer going  out in that way.” (GE
1.)  During   her  PSI,   Applicant  admitted   that  she   had   used   cocaine   during   the   previous
weekend  to  stay  awake  and  be  more energetic. She  stated  that she  had  no  plan  to  use
cocaine  in the  future,  but that she  would use  it if  circumstances conducive  to  cocaine  use
arose.  (GE  2.)  When   she   responded   to   DOHA  interrogatories  in  May   2021,  Applicant
denied  any  intention  to use cocaine in the future. (GE 2.) In her July 2021 Answer to the
SOR, Applicant explained  her changed intention about future use  of  cocaine,  as follows:
Since  the  COVID-19  pandemic my  life  has changed  drastically, and  I do  not
have  plans to  use  this substance  in the  future. Additionally,  I do  not  have  any
of  this substance  in my  capacity  or available to  me. Lastly, I have  not,  and
would  never  be   under  the   influence   while   working,  or  performing   any
necessary tasks.  (Answer.)
Applicant  explained  at  her  hearing  that  the  pandemic  impacted  her  lifestyle,
including her activities and social associations. She had seen the friends listed on her SF
86 only one or two times since the COVID-related lockdown in March 2020. While she
interacts with her sister regularly, to Applicant’s knowledge, her sister has not purchased
any illegal drugs in the last two years. (Tr. 15.)
Applicant takes her job responsibilities seriously. Her performance reviews have
been positive. She indicated that she would not waiver in her commitment to her work if
granted clearance eligibility. (Tr. 16.) However, she is not required to hold a clearance to
keep her present job. (Tr. 20.) A clearance would provide her additional opportunities at
work in the future. (Tr. 22.)

"Based on the testimony and record evidence presented at the hearing, I make
the  following  findings  of  fact.  The  July  2021  SOR  alleges  under  paragraph  1.a  that
Applicant  used marijuana at  varying  frequency between  June 2000  and  June  2020.  In
his July 2021 answer, he admitted the allegation, but noted there were breaks in usage
and the total number of marijuana uses was in the “low single digits.” He indicated that
other  than  his  marijuana  use,  he  never  violated  federal  law  in  any  way.  The  use  of
marijuana  never  felt  comfortable,  and  he  had  no  desire  to  use  the  drug  in  the  future.
(July 2021 answer to SOR)
The  SOR  alleges  under  paragraph  1.b  that  Applicant  used marijuana  after he
was  granted  access to  classified  information  on  March 21, 2006, and on February 10,
2016.  Applicant  admitted  paragraph  1.b,  but  presented  no  additional  comment  to
explain his admission.
Paragraph 2.a of the SOR alleges that Applicant provided false information on
his September 2015 e-QIP by answering “No” to the Section 23 question of illegal drug
use  in  the  last  7  years,  and  by  answering  “No”  to  illegal  drug  use  while  possessing  a
security  clearance.  Applicant  admitted  providing  false  information,  but  claimed  it
resulted  from  misunderstanding  the  seven-year  question.  He  remembered  telling  the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator  that  he  had  used  marijuana
previously, but not in the last seven years. The investigator told him not to worry about
his  use.  Applicant  still  believed  the  seven-year  period  applied  to  the  second  question
(illegal  use  of  drugs  with  a  security  clearance),  even  though  “it  (the  security  question)
clearly  included  the  word  “EVER,”  referring  to  any  past  use.  Applicant  acknowledged
illegal drug use, but contended that it took place outside the previous seven years. (July
2021 answer to SOR)
Paragraph  2.b  of  the  SOR  alleges  that  in  his  August  2005  security  clearance
application  (SCA),  Applicant  answered  “No”  to  question  27  asking  whether  he  used
illegal  drugs  since  the  age  of  16  or  in  the  last  7  years.  In  admitting  the  allegation,
Applicant  characterized  his  negative  answer  as  a  miscalculation.  In  August  2005,  he
recalled  using  marijuana  once  in  his  life,  but  he  was  unsure  when.  Because  he  only
remembered a  single  use many years ago,  he  determined  it  was  outside  the  previous
seven  years.  Upon  current  reconsideration  of  when  he  last  used  marijuana,  his  best
estimate was that the use occurred in the middle of 2000. Applicant emphasized that he
never intentionally furnished false information on a security clearance application. (July
2021 answer to SOR)
Applicant is  46  years old.  From  1994  to  1997,  he  earned  three  years of college
credits but no  degree. From  1997  to  1999, he  received  additional college  credits at two
other  colleges  but  no   degree.   (GE  2   at   9,   Tr.   13,  16)  He  has  been   married   since
September  2010   and   has  two   minor  children,  an   11-year-old  daughter  and   a   seven-
year-old  son.  Since   1997,  he   has  been   employed   by   a   defense   contractor  as  an
estimator.  Applicant  was  granted   a   security   clearance   in  March   2006,  June   2010,  and
February 2016. He has owned his home since April 2011. (GE 1  at 9-18, 33)
The  allegation  of  marijuana  use  set  forth  in  SOR  1.a  is  based  on  Applicant’s
February  2021  e-QIP  where  he  admitted  that  he  used  marijuana  from  June  2000  to
June 2020. He described the frequency of use as approximately every couple of years.
He  indicated  that  he  used  marijuana  while  he  held  a  security  clearance.  He  did  not
intend to use marijuana in the future. Applicant commented that “[marijuana] doesn’t do
much for me. Every couple of years or so I think it might be better and I try it again. But
it’s always the same, just don’t’ see the point.” (GE 1 at 31)
Applicant’s  admissions  about  illegal  marijuana  use  and  use  while  holding  a
security clearance in his February 2021 e-QIP contradict his negative responses in his
September  2015  e-QIP  to  using  illegal  drugs  in  the  last  seven  (7)  years,  and  never
using drugs while possessing a security clearance. (SOR 2.a) (GE 2 at 30) Applicant’s
February  2021  drug  admissions  are  also  inconsistent  with  his  negative  response  to
Question 27 of his August 2005 e-QIP requiring disclosure of information of illegal drug
use since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years. (SOR 2.b) (GE 3 at 4)
At the April 2022 hearing, Applicant was questioned further about his history of
marijuana use. He claimed that he used the drug no more than four times in his lifetime,
which is less than half as many times as he disclosed in his February 2021 e-QIP. (Tr.
11-12)
Applicant  testified  that  his  first  use  of  marijuana  occurred  after  returning  from
college  in  1997.  Then  he  testified  the  first  use  may  have  occurred  between  1997  and
1999.  Then  he  testified  he  could  not  remember  when  the  first  use  took  place.
Notwithstanding his inability to recall when he began using marijuana, he indicated that
he used the drug with  a group of friends at someone’s house after a holiday party. (Tr.
17)
Applicant’s second marijuana use occurred the following year in probably 1998
or 1999, in a similar situation. He accepted someone’s offer of the drug. He claimed the
effect of his second use was just as unimpressive as his first use. (Tr. 18)
In  2007  or  2008,  Applicant’s  third  use  of  marijuana  occurred  at  his  parents’
summer house in a state where marijuana had been recently legalized. His parents had
obtained  a  chocolate  edible  mixed  with  marijuana  from  a  dispensary.  Having  been
granted  his  security  clearance  in  March  2006,  Applicant  knew  that  his  marijuana  use
was inconsistent with his federal security clearance responsibilities. Applicant compared
the  edible  to  “chewing  a  stick”  and  has  not  used  marijuana  in  edible  form  since.  He
decided to use the drug because, as noted earlier, the state had recently legalized the
drug, and he was not really thinking about his security clearance responsibilities at the
time he used the drug. (Tr. 18-19, 23-24)
After  a  social  event  with  neighbors  in  June  2020,  Applicant  and  his  wife
returned home. She pulled out a vape pen that she said she had received from a friend
in high school. She had occasionally used marijuana in Applicant’s presence in the past,
but  this was  the first  time he used the drug with  her. He  was  at  home  engaging in  an
experimental  method  of  using  the  drug,  and  was  not  thinking  about  his  security
clearance  at  the  time.  Because  he  could  not  taste  the  flavor  the  pen  produced,  he
decided that he did not like it. Applicant testified that his security clearance is not at the
“forefront of most things I do on a daily basis.” He periodically thinks about his security
clearance  at  work,  but  otherwise  he  does  not  think  about  the  clearance  regularly.  (Tr.
19-20, 26-28)
Applicant  was  asked  about  the  scope  and  frequency  of  his  marijuana  use
between June 2000 and June 2020. He read the relevant portion of his February 2021
e-QIP  describing  his  use  of  marijuana  about  every  two  years  over  the  twenty-year
period.  Applicant  disagreed  with  his  statements  by  indicating  he  should  have  taken
more time and explained that  his use  was  about four  times over a period of  20 years.
Subsequently,  he  stated  that  he  described  his  marijuana  use  inadequately  in  that  he
believed his reply appearing in the e-QIP was focused on the overall number of years.
Therefore, in Applicant’s opinion, he only used marijuana twice between June 2000 and
June 2020. He was not really considering his lifetime total marijuana usage. The June
2000  date  was  an  estimate  as  to  when  he  began  marijuana  use.  He  believed  the
beginning  use  was  closer  to  1997.  Although  he  testified  earlier  in  the  hearing  that  he
used marijuana twice between 1997 and 1999, once in 2007 or 2008, and once in June
2020,  he  did  not  disclose  that  use  in  his  February  2021  e-QIP  because  of  “poor
wording,” “averaging  it  out,” over the  period  rather that stating  the  number of  times he
used the drug. No additional clarifying information was provided. (GE 1 at 31; Tr. 28-30,
34-35)
Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.
However,  he  was  unable  to  state  that  he  would  not  use  the  drug  after  he  retires  to  a
state with warmer weather. Given that he has not been awed by his use of the drug four
times in the past, he did not see a need to use the drug in the future.  Even though his
security clearance  is a growing factor in  not using marijuana,  the  primary factor still is
that he does not like marijuana. (Tr. 30-31)
Although  Applicant  unequivocally  stated  in  his  February  2021  e-QIP  that  he
used marijuana approximately every two years between June 2000 and June 2020,  he
testified  that  he  only  used  the  drug  twice  during  the  period.  Though  he  admitted
falsifying  the  two  questions  on  his  2015  e-QIP  concerning  drug  use,  and  using  drugs
while possessing a security clearance, he claimed the negative answers resulted from
misunderstanding  the  questions  asked,  rather  than  deliberately  falsifying  his  answers.
Though  he  admitted  falsifying  the  drug  use  question  in  his  2005  e-QIP,  his  negative
answer was the result of a miscalculation, and not deliberately falsifying his answer. He
was unsure when his last use of the drug occurred. In light of Applicant’s five years of a
college  education,  his  employment  with  a  defense  contractor  for  about  24  years,  his
possession of a security clearance for  at least 14 years, his knowledge that marijuana
use is illegal at the federal level and inconsistent with holding a security clearance, I do
not  consider  his  discrepant  and  ambiguous  accounts  of  his  drug  history  and  the
explanations for his falsifications to be credible.

"In her Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e; she admitted, in part,
and denied, in part, SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g. At the hearing and without objection, Applicant
amended her Answer to SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g, admitting both allegations. She is 29 years
old. As of the date of the hearing and since November 2021, she was separated from her
spouse,  whom  she  married  in  2011,  at  age  18.  She  has  a  child  from  a  previous
relationship, a minor, who has special needs. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 21-29, 46-47, 57, 80-81;

Applicant graduated from high school in 2011. She earned an associate’s degree
in 2015 and a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering in 2017. As of the date of the
hearing,  she  was  working  towards  her  master’s  degree  in  aerospace  engineering  and
mechanics.  She  worked  for  her  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  March  2019.  She
initially worked 12-hour rotating shifts as a satellite controller, but she was promoted  in
approximately  November  2020  to  a  satellite  engineer.  She  was  granted  a  security
clearance in approximately 2019. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 21-29, 75, 79-81, 89; GE 1-3; AE A,
F)
The SOR alleged that Applicant used: marijuana from approximately August 2008
to September 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a); illegal stimulants (primarily ecstasy) from approximately
August 2011 to August 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.b); hallucinogens (including mushrooms, LSD, and
lab/synthetic hallucinogens) from August 2011 to August 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.c); cocaine from
March  2015  to  August  2019  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  and  prescription  medication  Adderall,  not
prescribed to her, from September 2010 to March 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.e). It also alleged that
Applicant  purchased  hallucinogens  on  the  dark  web  and  then  resold  them  between
September 2011 and August 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.f); and purchased illegal stimulants on the
dark web and then resold them between September 2011 and March 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.g).
Applicant acknowledged that curiosity would likely have led her to try drugs, but
she attributed the extent of her drug involvement to her spouse’s influence. She described
him  as  an  “incredibly  chronic”  marijuana  user.  When  she  met  him,  he  was  already
supplying and selling drugs. He supplied her with a number of drugs, to include her first
experiences with  MDMA  (ecstasy), cocaine, LSD, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and  lab-
created  hallucinogens.  He encouraged  her to  continue  to  sell  drugs  in 2019  when  she
decided   to   stop,   as   further  discussed   below.  He   suffered   from   depressive   episodes.
During  an  episode,  he   consumed  large  quantities of alcohol “and   other things,” and   he
abused   her.   She   endured   his   abuse   throughout   their   relationship,   and   his   abuse
worsened  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic. After an abusive  incident  that left her “really
scared” and  felt different than  before,  she  left  him  and  took her son  with  her. Her fear of
her spouse  affected  her ability  to  function, both  while  she  was with  him  and  since  leaving
him. Since  leaving  him, she  attended  weekly  individual and  group  therapy, through  which
she  learned  coping  mechanisms. She  had  no  future intent  to  have  any  contact  with  him
and  she  intended  to  seek a  divorce.  She  had  anxiety, difficulty  concentrating, and  memory
loss, especially concerning anything related to him. She  stated:
[I]t’s  hard   for   me   to   remember  anything   that’s  like   associated   with   my
husband.  And  the  [drug] use, I don’t know  if  why, like  the  drug  use  for me  is
like very intertwined with  him.

Applicant disclosed her drug involvement on her security  clearance applications
(SCA)  from  October  2019  (SCA  1)  and  August  2020  (SCA  2).  After  SCA  1,  she  was
interviewed by a background investigator in January 2020 and May 2020. After SCA 2,
she was interviewed by the same background investigator in September 2020.  Applicant
did not have a copy of SCA 1 or SCA 2 to reference during the interviews. She received
and responded to GE 2, in which she adopted the ROIs that summarized her interviews
with the background investigator, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the height of her
spouse’s abuse.  She did not review GE 2 as closely as she could have, she remembered
things incorrectly, and she did not reference SCA 1 or SCA 2 when reviewing GE 2. She
stated that her drug disclosures on SCA 1 most accurately reflected her drug involvement,
since it was the closest in time to the period in which she was using, buying, and selling
drugs. (Tr. at 53-56, 81-83, 89, 92-96, 98; GE 1-3)
Applicant used marijuana approximately monthly, from 2008 to 2015; she did not
use marijuana between 2015 and September 2019; and she exercised bad judgment in
September 2019 when she used marijuana with her spouse at a week-long music festival
between  the  end  of  August  and  into  September  2019.  She  used  marijuana  with  her
spouse and in social settings. She has not used marijuana since September 2019. (Tr. at
29-31, 33, 84-86, 88-89, 93-94, 98; GE 1-3)
Applicant  used  illegal  stimulants  between  2011  and  2019.  She  primarily  used
ecstasy and MDA, but she also used cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine, and
prescription  ADHD  medication  not  prescribed  to  her,  primarily  Adderall.  She  used  the
illegal  stimulants  in  social  settings.  She  estimated  that  she  used  ecstasy  “a  couple  of
times a month,” from 2011 to 2015. She did not use ecstasy between 2015 and August
2019. In August 2019, she exercised bad judgment and used ecstasy with her spouse at
the  same  music  festival  where  she  last  used  marijuana.  She  estimated  that  she  used
cocaine every three to six months, on around 10 occasions, from March 2015 to August
2019. In  August 2019, she  exercised  bad  judgment and  used  cocaine  with  her spouse  at
the  same  music festival where she  last  used  marijuana  and  ecstasy.  She  has  not  used
illegal stimulants since  August 2019.  (Tr.  at  31-35, 38-40, 84-86, 88-89, 93-94, 98;  GE  1-

Applicant   used   prescription   ADHD  medication,  not   prescribed   to   her,   from
approximately   September  2010   to   March  2015.  She   occasionally   used   amphetamines
in   college.  She   used
and   prescription   medication   not   prescribed
methamphetamine  once, in  2011, when  she  was in  college.  She  used  amphetamines  and
prescription medication  not prescribed  to  her,  in college  “to focus  or  study for tests,”  and
she also used  the latter once  or twice to stay up to party. (Tr. at 31-35, 38-40, 84-86, 88-
89; GE  1-3)
to   her,
Applicant  used  LSD,  hallucinogenic  mushrooms,  and  lab-created  hallucinogens
from 2011 to 2016. She estimated that she used these hallucinogens “a couple of times
a  month”  during this period.  She did  not  use hallucinogens  between  2016 and August
2019.  In  August  2019,  she  exercised  bad  judgment  and  used  hallucinogens  with  her
spouse at the same music festival where she last used marijuana, ecstasy, and cocaine.
She has not used hallucinogens since August 2019. (Tr. at 35-36, 84-86, 88-89, 93-94,
98; GE 1-3)
Applicant  used  narcotics  from  approximately  February  2012  to  June  2014.  She
used heroin once, orally, out of curiosity. She also used prescription narcotic medication,
as prescribed to her, for pain relief. She has not illegally used a narcotic since June 2014.
(Tr. at 36-38; GE 1-3)
Applicant purchased and sold stimulants from approximately September 2011 to
March 2017, and she purchased and sold hallucinogens from approximately September
2011 to August 2019. She did so with her spouse, who was already supplying and selling
drugs when she met him. She stated, “Well, I literally didn’t have any time to myself, like
we did everything together.” They purchased stimulants and hallucinogens from people
they knew primarily through her spouse who were associated with drugs, and also on the
dark web from an online black market that she learned of after reading about it. She could
not recall the amount of stimulants and hallucinogens they purchased on the dark web;
how often they purchased stimulants and hallucinogens on the dark web; or how much
they  spent  on  stimulants  and  hallucinogens  on  the  dark  web.  She  estimated  that  they
purchased  stimulants  and  hallucinogens  from  people  they  knew  approximately  twice
monthly, and  from  the  dark web  approximately “a couple times a  year.”  She estimated
that they spent in “the low hundreds” when they purchased stimulants and hallucinogens
from the dark web. They purchased stimulants and hallucinogens for their personal use
and  to  sell,  out  of  their  apartment,  to  people  they  knew  from  social  events  who  were
“heavy drug users.” (Tr. at 41-45, 61-75, 88-91, 94-95; GE 1-3)
Applicant stated that she was young, and she sold stimulants and hallucinogens,
with her spouse, “mostly to buy groceries,” as she was in school full-time, her spouse was
earning  approximately  $30,000  annually,  and  they  were  “really  struggling.”  She  was
unsure how much they earned selling stimulants and hallucinogens, and estimated that it
was between approximately $200 to $500 per month. In approximately 2015,  when the
online black market through which they purchased stimulants and hallucinogens was shut
down, their purchases of stimulants and hallucinogens from the dark web ceased. After
graduating from college in 2017, she wanted to take her professional career seriously and
be  a  good  role  model  for  her  child,  so  she  mostly  stopped  purchasing  and  selling
stimulants and hallucinogens. On rare occasions between 2017 and 2019, she purchased
and resold stimulants and hallucinogens to friends who wanted them, but not to generate
income.  The  last  time  she  distributed  drugs  to  friends  was  at  the  2019  music  festival,
where she last used marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine, and hallucinogens. When her husband
pushed for her to continue to purchase and sell drugs, she told him “no.” (Tr. at 41-45,
61-75, 88-91, 96-97; GE 1-3)
Applicant  has  no  future  intentions  to  use  illegal  drugs  or  prescription  drugs  not
legally prescribed to her. She stated that she has matured since her last period of drug
involvement in 2019; she no longer socializes with individuals who used or sold drugs;
and  she  no  longer  frequents  places  where  drugs  are  used  or  sold.  If  she  were  to find
herself in an environment where drugs are being used, she would say “no.” She signed a
statement of intent in August 2021 not to use illegal drugs in the future, and agreed that
any such violation is grounds for revocation of her security clearance. She wants to be a
role  model for her  child.  She  had friends  who  battled narcotic addiction  and  died from
overdoses. She also stated, “At my job I want to be seen as a leader. Someone who can
mentor folks. I  want  to  be  respected  in my  field.”  She  described  her responsibilities at
work as:
I  am   the   satellite   buslead   for  two   of   our  geosynchronous  satellites.  So   I
focus  on  .  . . making  sure the  satellite  is healthy  . . .  sitting  in  space  correctly.

Applicant completed an online drug and alcohol awareness class in August 2021.
She was subject to random drug tests by her employer.  She tested negative for drugs
when  she  voluntarily  submitted  to  a  drug  test  in  March  2022.  She  has  never  been
diagnosed with a drug dependency. The director of the satellite control center in which
she worked, while not privy to Applicant’s past drug involvement, described her as “one
of the most dedicated, industrious, and trustworthy employees that I have worked with in
over  35  years  in  the  field.”  She  provided  numerous  other  references  from  individuals
attesting to her character, to include colleagues, former colleagues, peers, and friends,
many of whom were aware of Applicant’s past drug involvement. All of them vouched for
her maturity,  reliability,  and  willingness  to follow rules  and regulations. She stated  that
while  her  immediate  and  second  line  supervisors  were  unaware  of  her  past  drug
involvement, she was an “open book,” and would not be concerned if anyone were to find
out. Her employer awarded her bonuses in 2020 and 2021 for her performance, and she
received a favorable performance review by her former employer in 2017. (Tr. at 75, 77,
91-92, 97; AE C-G)
A co-worker of three years who worked with Applicant on a weekly basis, and who
was  also  a  friend,  testified.  This  individual  held  a  security  clearance.  She  stated  that
Applicant’s  superiors sought  to  recently increase Applicant’s  work responsibility,  which
was a testament to Applicant’s favorable work performance. This  individual stated  that
she  was  aware  of  Applicant’s  past  drug  involvement,  and  noted  that  Applicant  was
working hard to improve her life situation. She described Applicant as “a bright character
and has a very strong intent to be a positive influence on her son . . . and is exceedingly
passionate about her career path remaining in a positive trajectory.” (Tr. at 99-107)

indicates
The adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a),
the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the
“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
A2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to
classified information will  be  resolved  in favor of  the  national security.” In  reaching  this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on
the  evidence  contained  in  the  record.  Likewise,  I  have  avoided  drawing  inferences
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.”
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement and Substance  Abuse
Under AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into
question a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG
¶ 24 sets forth the concern, as follows:
The illegal use  of controlled substances, to include the  misuse of prescription
and   non-prescription   drugs,  and   the   use   of   other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental  impairment or are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent with  their
intended   purpose   can   raise   questions  about  an   individual's  reliability   and
trustworthiness,  both   because   such   behavior  may   lead   to   physical  or
psychological  impairment   and   because   it  raises  questions  about   a   person's
ability   or  willingness  to   comply   with   laws,  rules,   and   regulations.  Controlled
substance   means   any   ""controlled   substance""   as   defined   in   21   U.S.C.§   802.
Substance  misuse  is the  generic term  adopted  in this guideline  to  describe  any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions or factors:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);
AG ¶  25(c)  illegal possession of a controlled substance . . .  ; and
AG ¶  25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance
abuse . . . .
The only potentially applicable mitigating factor here is quoted below:
AG  ¶   26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment.
Applicant admitted that he has been using marijuana regularly since 1996 and that
he intends to continue to use it for pain relief. Facts admitted by an applicant in an SCA,
an Answer to a SOR, or in an interview require no further proof from the Government.
ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (“any admissions [applicant] made
to  the  SOR  allegations  .  .  .  relieve  Department  Counsel of  its  burden  of  proof”);  ISCR
Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1  (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (“[a]n applicant’s admissions,
whether  testimonial  or  written,  can  provide  a  legal  basis for  an  Administrative  Judge’s
findings”).
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated
by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. § 811 et seq.
The knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and
punishable  by  imprisonment,  a  fine  or  both. 21  U.S.C.  §  844.  In  an  October  25,  2014
memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is
a security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of  National Intelligence, Memorandum:
Adherence  to  Federal  Laws  Prohibiting  Marijuana  Use  (October  25,  2014).  See  also
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml
More recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed
the memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana
for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal
law  remains  unchanged  with  respect  to  the  illegal  use,  possession,  production  and
distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited  by  law  from  using  controlled  substances.  Disregard  of  federal  law
pertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal, or recreational marijuana use) remains
relevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use
the “whole-person concept” stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant’s
behavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
Because  of  Applicant’s  past  use  of  marijuana,  his  current  use,  and  his  expressed
intent to use in the future, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 25(a), (c), and (g) apply here.
The next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply.
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(a). Applicant began using marijuana more
than 25 years ago. Therefore, the inception of his use was long ago. He has, however,
continued his regular use to the present day. And Applicant intends to continue to use
marijuana. His use has been frequent, and Applicant plans to continue using marijuana
in the future. His use is not mitigated by AG ¶ 26(a).
The Whole-Person Concept
The record raises doubts about  Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment,
and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not
met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a.- 1.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest

27, 39; GE 1 at 7, 12, 13, 24, 26-30, 37-38.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and  Substance Involvement
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a  security  clearance
because he has used marijuana since 2015 and intends to continue to do so in the future
(SOR 1.a and 1.b). The Government further alleges that a psychologist (the Psychologist)
who  conducted  a  psychological  evaluation  diagnosed  Applicant  as  having  Unspecified
Cannabis-Related  Disorder  and  concluded  that  his  condition  could  pose  a  risk  to  his
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified information at this time (SOR
1.c).  In  his  Answer  Applicant  admits  the  first  two  SOR  allegations  and  provides  some
additional information. He denies the third allegation stating that he does not meet the
criteria  of  the  diagnosis  provided  by  the  Psychologist  and  questions  whether  the
Psychologist is competent.
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  before  his  children  were  born  in  the  mid-to-late
1980’s. As a parent he decided to stop using illegal drugs to set an appropriate example.
In 2015 after the death of his son, Applicant began using edibles containing marijuana or
THC  (Edibles).  Applicant  was  suffering  severely  from  grief.  He  was  having  difficulty
sleeping.  A  doctor  diagnosed  that  Applicant  was  experiencing  post-traumatic  stress
disorder (PTSD) and provided him with a medical marijuana card that permitted him to
purchase  marijuana,  including  Edibles  with  THC,  to  help  him  with  his  PTSD.  He  uses
Edibles  because  they  gave  him  some  relief  from  his  “emotional  trauma”  and  help  him
sleep. He presently uses them three or four nights per week. The anniversary of his son’s
death was during the period just before the hearing, and he used Edibles more frequently
to help  him  get through  a period  he  described  as “hell.” He  only takes Edibles after he
experiences something that triggers his intense feeling of grief. He acknowledged that he
experiences triggers every day, even “24/7.” He never takes Edibles during the day. He
is  opposed  to  any  prescription  drugs  that  are  typically  used  to  reduce  anxiety  or
depression. He “avoid[s] them like the plague.” He intends to continue using Edibles in
the future because “the pain never goes away.” He acknowledged that he is aware that
THC is an illegal drug under Federal law. He views his only alternative to THC is the use
of opioids, which he dislikes because they are addictive. (Tr. at 28- 31, 39-45.)
Applicant candidly testified that he uses Edibles because without them he will “cry
himself to sleep every night.” He suffers from sadness and depression every day, but only
uses the Edibles at night because they help him sleep. He finds it overwhelming to deal
with so much grief every day. His plan for the future is to continue focusing on his work,
which he asserts he performs well. He will also continue surfing on the weekends and
after work. When  he  needs  the  relief  provided  by  the  Edibles,  he will  continue  to  take
them to help him sleep. He commented that he will “not be a free man until the day I die.
There is no resolution.” (Tr. at 46-49.)
Applicant disagrees with the Psychologist’s evaluation of his condition because he
does not believe he is dependent on marijuana or THC (collectively, THC). He views the
Psychologist’s  diagnosis  of  Unspecified  Cannabis-Related  Disorder  as  concluding  that
Applicant is dependent on THC. Applicant testified about his recent experience of taking
a two-week vacation with his wife when he could not travel with Edibles to other states.
During  that  vacation,  he  was  comfortable  not  using  Edibles  because  there  were  few
situations that triggered intense grief. He experiences those triggers regularly when he is
at  home  where  he  keeps  his  son’s  ashes.  He  acknowledged  that  the  Psychologist’s
conclusion that Applicant is reliant on THC to  stabilize  his mood  is “60% accurate.” He
engages in other activities to remain calm, like surfing. (Tr. at 31-33, 43.)
Paragraph 2  - Guideline  I, Psychological Conditions
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security
clearance  because  he  has  a  psychological  condition  that  raises  security  concerns.
Specifically, the SOR alleges the Psychologist gave Applicant a guarded prognosis due
to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) that is untreated other than a prescription for
marijuana.  In  his  Answer  Applicant  denies  this  allegation  and  provides  additional
information and opinions regarding his view that the Psychologist’s opinion is erroneous.
At the hearing Applicant acknowledged that he is not currently participating in any
treatment. He does not find grief counseling useful. He participated in grief counseling for
two years after his son’s death and found that discussions about the seven stages of grief
to be repetitive and unhelpful. He believes that “nothing resolves the grief of a lost child.
Nothing.” He believes that there are no answers. (Tr. at 34-36.)
The  Psychologist’s  report,  dated  January  6,  2022,  is  part  of  the  record.  In  his
report, the Psychologist  noted that three counselors have treated Applicant  in the past
and that Applicant advised that he had been diagnosed with PTSD. Applicant has only
received treatment during a six-month period. The Psychologist’s test results confirmed
this diagnosis. He also affirmed a prior diagnosis of Applicant of Unspecified Cannabis-
Related Disorder. The Psychologist gave Applicant a “guarded” diagnosis. He wrote that
Applicant “seems reliant on the substance [THC] to maintain a stable mood.” His ultimate
conclusion was that Applicant’s “PTSD and marijuana use could pose a significant risk to
his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness concerning classified information at the present
time.” (GE 2 at 8-9.)
Mitigation
Applicant honorably served in the Navy for four years and was discharged with a
disability. In 2015 he suffered the tragic loss of his only son with whom he was very close.
Seven years later he continues to grieve, kissing the urn holding his son’s ashes before
he retires for the night. He sleeps poorly and thinks of  his son and the loss of his son
every  day.  He  is  opposed  to  using  prescription  medications  to  treat  his  suffering  and
strongly believes that his use of Edibles is the best treatment option. He complied with
the laws of his state to obtain a prescription authorizing him to purchase and use Edibles.
He  believes  that  he  would  be  a  greater  risk  to  national  security  if  he  used  opioids  to
manage his PTSD and grief. He describes his honesty as his strength and his fault, noting
that he could have lied in his e-QIP and his use of Edibles would never have become an
issue. (Tr. at 49.)

"The SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR ¶ 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline
J (SOR ¶ 3.a) and Guideline E (SOR ¶ 4.f), that Applicant was arrested for driving under

Under Guideline H (SOR ¶ 2.a), and cross-alleged under Guideline J (SOR ¶ 3.a) and
Guideline E (SOR ¶ 4.a), Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in February 2014,
while granted access to classified information, and charged with possession of less than
one-half ounce of cannabis.
Under  Guideline  E,  Applicant  is  also  alleged  to  have  falsified  a  May  17,  2017
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by not disclosing the 2014
marijuana possession charge in response to the police record inquiries (SOR ¶ 4.a) and
by denying any illegal drug involvement in response to a question concerning any drug
use while possessing a security clearance (SOR ¶ 4.b). Applicant is also alleged to have
concealed the September 2018 and October 2018 DUI offenses and the 2014 marijuana
possession  charge  when  questioned  during  his  December  2019  PSI  (SOR  ¶  4.c).
Additionally, Applicant allegedly failed to self-report his September 2018 (SOR ¶ 4.d) and
October 2018 (SOR ¶ 4.e) DUIs to his FSO.
Applicant denied all of the allegations when he responded to the SOR, including
the  DUIs,  which  he  denied  on  the  basis  that  he  had  passed  the  outpatient  programs
without incident and no recurrence since the October 2018 offense. He explained about
the marijuana charge that he was ticketed $50, but that the marijuana was left in his car
by  a  former  colleague.  He  asserted  he  had  forgotten  about  the  ticket  for  marijuana
possession,  and  he  denied  any  intentional  concealment  of  his  DUIs  or  the  marijuana
charge.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  high  school  graduate,  who  subsequently  completed
vocational  training  in  July  2005.  (GE  2.)  He  worked  as  a  technician  in  the  automotive
repair industry for over a decade before going to work in equipment repair for his current
employer, a defense contractor, in late May 2017. (AE A; Tr. 56.) He served honorably as
a wheeled vehicle mechanic with a clearance in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) from May
2007 to June or July 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 49-50, 56-57.) He has never married and has no
children. (GE 1; Tr. 56.)
On November 14, 2006, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-QIP
in application for a secret clearance for his Army enlistment. He listed two speeding tickets
from September 2005 and September 2006, but no other issues. (GE 2.) He was granted
a secret clearance for his duties in the military. (GE 1.)
On February 23, 2014, Applicant was stopped by the police in the parking lot of a
local  convenience  store.  He  exhibited  signs  of  intoxication,  including  glassy  eyes  and
slurred  speech.  He  told  the  police  he  had  consumed  four  beers  at  a  local  pub  and
admitted that he was “inebriated.”  The police directed him to a dry portion of the sidewalk.
After failing field sobriety tests, he was arrested for DUI. During an inventory search of
Applicant’s vehicle, the police found marijuana and two glass pipes containing marijuana
under his driver’s seat; marijuana residue in his center console; and a marijuana grinder
in the pocket of his driver’s door. (GE 5.) Applicant was subsequently charged with DUI
and possession of less than one half ounce of cannabis, first offense. He was fined $50
for  the  marijuana  charge.  (GE  3;  Tr.  48.)  Applicant  asserts  that  he  was  told  by  the
prosecutor that “it was the equivalent of a parking ticket with a $50 fine.” (Tr. 48.) For the
DUI, he was required to attend 15 alcohol-education classes. On his completion of the
classes, the charge was dismissed and his record was sealed. (GE 3.) He asserts that
his command in the USAR was aware of his arrest. (Tr. 51.)
On May 17, 2017, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-QIP for the
security clearance needed for his current employment. In response to the police record
inquiries,  he  reported  his  2014  arrest  for  DUI  and  indicated  that  he  had  to  attend  15
classes for the offense. He did not disclose that he had also been charged with, and fined
for, marijuana possession, and responded negatively to questions regarding illegal use
of drugs or drug activity including the following:
Have  you  EVER  illegally  used  or otherwise  been  involved  with  a drug  or
controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security  clearance  other  than
previously listed? (GE 1.)
Applicant’s clearance eligibility was renewed through the military about four or five months
after he submitted his e-QIP, and it was transferred for his work with a defense contractor.
(Tr. 60.)
On September 23, 2018, Applicant was on a business trip in another state for his
employer when he was pulled over for not having his headlights on. He told the police
that he had consumed three beers with dinner, but he had a strong odor of alcohol about
him and slurred speech. He failed field sobriety testing and was arrested for DUI. At the
police station, his blood alcohol content (BAC) tested at .14% by breathalyzer. (GE 4.)
Applicant  pled  guilty  to  DUI,  was  fined  $460,  and  ordered  to  attend  alcohol-education
classes  within  one  year.  As  of  December  4,  2019,  he  had  not  completed  the  required
alcohol-education classes as he was asking the court to accept classes taken as a result
of a subsequent DUI offense, committed in October 2018 in his state. (GE 3.)
Applicant consumed about four to five beers at a bar while out on a date in October
2018. He and his date drove separately, and he did not feel too impaired to drive safely.
He was pulled over while exiting a highway on suspicion of drunk driving. Applicant told
the  officer  that  he  had  consumed  some  alcohol  on  a  date,  and  he  failed  field  sobriety
tests. He was arrested for DUI and brought to the police station. Applicant recalls that his
breathalyzer result showed a .12% BAC. In April 2019, his driver’s license was suspended
pending the installation of an Interlock device  on his vehicle, which he had installed in
November 2019. He was placed on probation for 18 months, and was required to attend
eight  alcohol-education  classes,  and  complete  100  hours  of  community  service.  As  of
December 2019, he had attended seven alcohol-education classes but had yet to start
his  community  service  or  complete  the  alcohol-education  classes  required  for  his
September 2018 DUI in another state. (GE 3.)
On December 4, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator,
who  confirmed  that  Applicant  was  very  nervous.  (Tr.  26-27.)  When  asked  about  his
disclosed February 2014 DUI arrest, Applicant stated that he had consumed three to four
beers while playing video games in his home before driving to a local convenience store.
He claimed that he failed only one field sobriety test in that he could not walk a straight
line because of ice on the ground. He denied that any drugs were involved in that arrest;
that  he  ever  used  any  illegal  drugs;  and  that  he  had  an  additional criminal  charges  to
report since completing his e-QIP in May 2017. (GE 3; Tr. 19.) Additional questioning by
the investigator elicited an admission and details from Applicant about his October 2018
DUI, including that his BAC tested at .12% and that he was on 18 months of probation.
He  expressed  regret  for  the  incident,  but  asserted  that  he  did  not  believe  he  has  an
alcohol problem. (GE 3.)
When  asked  again  by  the  investigator  about  any  additional  arrests  or  any
association with drugs or drug-related arrests, Applicant responded negatively. (GE 3; Tr.
19-20.) He was then confronted about the February 2014 marijuana possession charge.
Applicant asserted that the marijuana found in his vehicle belonged to a former co-worker
who must have dropped it in his vehicle, although he also stated that he had never seen
this co-worker use or possess an illegal drug. Applicant expressed that he pled guilty to
possession  of  marijuana  because  the  drug  was  in  his  vehicle,  and  he  paid  a  fine.  He
denied  any  intention  to  conceal  the  drug  charge,  and  explained  that  he  had  forgotten
about it when he completed his e-QIP and when questioned during his PSI. (GE 3.)
After discussing the drug charge with the investigator, Applicant again denied any
additional arrests or charges involving drugs or alcohol before additional questioning by
the investigator disclosed his arrest for DUI while out of state on business in September
2018. (GE 3; Tr. 20-21.) He explained that he believed he passed field sobriety testing,
but  admitted  that  he  “blew  a  .12  failing  the  [breathalyzer]  test.”  He  admitted  that,  in
February 2019, he pled guilty to DUI, paid a $460 fine, and was sentenced to complete
alcohol-education classes within one year. He explained that he had not disclosed  the
arrest in response to previous questioning because he was scared that it would adversely
affect  his  security  clearance  eligibility.  He  stated  that  he  reported  the  incident  to  his
supervisor,  co-workers,  and military command,  but not  to his FSO because  he did not
know that it  was  required.  (GE 3.)  The investigator recalls  that  Applicant provided  him
with contact information for his military chain of command and for his civilian department
head, who could corroborate his self-report (Tr. 27), and that Applicant told him that he
did not know he had to notify his FSO. (Tr. 31-32.)
The  investigator  flagged  Applicant  as  having  questionable  integrity  because  he
had to question Applicant numerous times, and had to confront him with the evidence of
the  charges  before  Applicant  provided  the  information  about  his  2018  DUIs  and  2014
drug charge. (Tr. 22-23.) However, the investigator believes that, after Applicant admitted
that he  had  not  disclosed  his September 2018  DUI  because of  fear it  would  affect his
clearance, Applicant was “as transparent as possible with [him] after the fact in regards
to self-admitting.” (Tr. 23.)
Applicant testified about his PSI as follows:
As the  interview  went along, yes, I was very nervous. It  was an  interview
that randomly  came  up  with  no  knowledge  of  anything  that was occurring.
So   yes,  I  was  absolutely   nervous.  And   I  do   not  believe   I  was  asked   that
many   times   to   recollect.   From   my   memory   I   do   remember  Special   Agent
[name  omitted] asking  me  was there anything  else.  And  I stuttered  when  I
told him. And  told him  about the  DUIs.  And  my   verbiage  at the  end  was,
yes, I am  aware that  these  can  affect  your security  clearance  that’s why  that
makes  me  nervous. Not the  fact that I  was hiding  it made  me  nervous. So
that was also a  clear misinterpretation  of  what I was saying  or what I thought
I clearly  came  across with  towards him. And  still, I was very  nervous of  what
was going on, not knowing what was going on. Because this process has
also, the actual investigation is also, came up when it started in 2020. Has
also stopped me from reenlisting in the [USAR]. (Tr. 49-50.)
Applicant testified at his hearing that he never tried to hide his DUIs from anybody
and that he “clearly and openly” talked to his bosses and co-workers as a group. He also
testified  that  he  made  his  motor  sergeant,  platoon  sergeant,  first  sergeant,  and
commander in the USAR aware of his DUIs because he knew they could affect his career.
(Tr. 51.) He asserts that he was told by his co-workers to make sure he reported any DUIs
on  his  e-QIP.  (Tr.  52-53.)  As  for  his  alleged  concealment  of  the  marijuana  charge,
Applicant testified as follows:
And   [the   special  agent]   asked   me   several  times  about  the   marijuana.   I
honestly   didn’t  remember   that  charge.  Or  that  ticket.   Because   my
information was that it was a ticket so I could throw that out of  my memory.
The  thing  to  worry  about was the  DUI and  making  sure  that got  out  on  my
e-QIP. And  then  going  from my  DUIs,  making sure I don’t get another one.
(Tr. 53.)
When asked on cross-examination to explain why he did not tell the investigator
about  his  2018  DUIs  when  asked  about  any  additional  alcohol  offenses,  Applicant
responded that he did inform the investigator. As to why he had to be questioned so many
times,  Applicant  disputed  that  the  interview  went  as  the  investigator  reported  in  his
summary (GE 3) and testified. Applicant maintains he never denied any other arrests (Tr.
59), and provided the following account of the PSI:
I’m  saying  that’s not  what happened. The  way  he  was asking  the  questions
is not  the  way  that  that  is written  down. Because  the  way  he  was asking  me
the  questions  is, are you  sure, and  I  said,  I’m  sorry, let  me  correct that.  He
asked   me,  is   there  anything   else.   And   I   can   adamantly   say,  I  wasn’t
reluctant  but nervously saying  yes there is,  there was this, Okay, is there
anything  else.  Still  reluctantly  saying, yes. Because  I’m  nervous as hell. (Tr.
61.)
During his December 2019 PSI, Applicant expressed a belief that he does not have
an alcohol problem. He attributed his DUI arrests to bad luck. He initially described his
current  alcohol  consumption  as  four  to  five  12-ounce  beers  within  a  four  to  five-hour
period once weekly, usually on the weekends, and said that has been his drinking pattern
before and after his February 2014 DUI. Later during his PSI, Applicant reportedly said
that  he  was  drinking  four  to  five  beers  approximately  once  a  month.  (GE  3.)  Neither
Applicant nor the investigator was asked about the discrepancy. At his June 2022 hearing,
Applicant described his current consumption as “maybe one beer on a Friday.” (Tr. 68.)
He explained that he drank out of habit, and that once he resumed raising animals and
doing  his  community  service  and  other  activities  that  he  enjoys,  he  found  his  drinking
habit easy to break. (Tr. 71.)
The alcohol-education classes required for the October 2018 DUI were apparently
accepted in fulfillment of the alcohol-education required by the out-of-state court for his
September  2018  DUI.  (Tr.  72.)  Applicant  admitted  triggering  his  Interlock  device  in
December 2019, when he consumed some alcohol-laced egg nog. (Tr. 71-72.) He was
originally  ordered  to  have  an  Interlock  device  on  his  vehicle  for  two  years,  but  it  was
extended to five years  because he missed two calibrations, which each added a year,
and he  drove  a  vehicle  without  an Interlock device  in  July 2020,  which  added  another
year. (Tr. 74-75.)
In  October 2021, Applicant  was pulled  over while  driving  to  work in  a  new  car  for
him.  He did  not have  an  Interlock  device in  the  vehicle,  and  was charged  with  driving  on
a  suspended  license.  He testified  that he  thought he  was no  longer subject  to  the  Interlock
requirement based  on  paperwork that he  had  and  that he  did  not know  his license  had
been  suspended. He testified  there is  conflict  between  the  Interlock device provider and
the  state  as to  whether he  had  the  device removed. He paid a  fine  for  texting  while  driving
and   had   the   Interlock  device  installed   (Tr.  77-78),  but  he   is  having   problems  with   the
device.  He  has  been   reported   three   times,   most   recently   in  about   February   2022,   for
violating  the Interlock. He asserts it  is due  to faulty  installation  in that  if he  leaves the  car
with  the  lights on, the  Interlock is recorded  as  still  being  on  (“if  you  leave  the  lights on  and
walk away  the  machine  is still  going  and  it reported  him  as missing  a  breath.”). (Tr. 79-
80.) He explained  that he  has not had  the  wiring  of  the  device inspected  because  he  has
to take time  from work. (Tr. 80-81.) He does not want to be  accused  of tampering so  has
not tried  to  correct the issue. (Tr. 81.)  The driving  while license  suspended  charge  is still
pending, and he has appeared  four times in court on that charge. (Tr. 78.)
Applicant performed his community service for his October 2018 DUI by providing
assistance to a local Boy Scout troop starting in June 2020. He continued to volunteer
after completing his community service, and as of June 2022 he had provided over 250
hours. The scoutmaster attested to his completion of those hours. She has no knowledge
of  any  information  that  would  compromise  Applicant’s  status  with  the  scouting
organization. (AE B.) Applicant has been a registered den leader for a Cub Scout pack
for the past six months. (Tr. 54-55.)
Applicant denies any use of marijuana. He testified that he was subjected to drug
testing  by  urinalysis  primarily  once  a  month  during  his  13  years  in  the  USAR,  and  he
never  failed  a  drug  screen.  (Tr.  50-51.)  He  testified  to  recalling  that  the  police  found
marijuana  “hidden  underneath  the  passenger  seat”  of  his  vehicle.  (Tr.  64.)  When
confronted with the police report of marijuana being in a glass jar under the driver’s seat,
Applicant  responded,  “I  thought  it  was  under  the  passenger  seat,  but  it  was  not  my
marijuana.” As for the police finding glass pipes with burnt marijuana in the center console
of his vehicle, Applicant stated, “They weren’t mine, so they had to have been his.” (Tr.
65.) As for the grinder found in the pocket of the driver’s door, Applicant explained:
In the interview I stated that I gave [his former co-worker] a ride earlier and
dropped him off at a place called [pub name omitted] where he waited for a
ride. I waited with him, then I went home and played video games. I was
drinking at my house and then went to the [convenience store] to where i
got pulled over. (Tr. 65.)
Applicant maintains that he did not know any of the drug paraphernalia had been in his
car before he was provided a copy of the police report by DOHA Department Counsel as
he had only paid a $50 “ticket” in court. (Tr. 66.)
Character References
Applicant’s chief union steward authored a character reference letter for Applicant
(AE A) and also testified (Tr. 38-46.) The union steward has worked for their employer
since 1989 and has a secret clearance. He has been a union steward for 15 years, and
president  and  chief  steward  of  the  union  “going  on  seven  years  now.”  (Tr.  40-42.)  He
testified that he did not understand until a couple of months ago that employees have a
duty to self-report information that could affect security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 40.) The
chief steward previously understood that it is when individuals come up for the ten-year
review of their clearance that they are required to be forthcoming about everything that
has happened understood “within the first ten years and the second.” (Tr. 39.) The chief
steward recalled an issue involving an employee who had an incident  while intoxicated
that  the employee  reported  to  his supervisor  and not  the  FSO,  but he  could  not  recall
whether their employer took any steps to inform employees of a duty to self-report to the
FSO. (Tr. 43-44.) The chief steward believes that he is “probably not” required to report
a union member who informs him of a legal problem, but he would advise him or her to
inform  his or her  supervisor.  (Tr. 44-45.)  The  chief  steward  attests  that  Applicant  “has
been  a  model  employee  gaining  respect  of  management,  fellow  employees,  and  [his]
entire team of union officers.” (AE A.)
Applicant  provided  character  reference  letters  from  five  co-workers  (AEs  C-G),
who attest to it being common knowledge that Applicant was arrested for DUI while on a
road job for their employer in 2018. A co-worker who works with Applicant on a daily basis
recalled  hearing  in  2018  about  Applicant’s  arrest.  He  indicated  that  Applicant  was
forthright  about  the arrest  when  questioned  on  his  return,  and  that  Applicant  was  also
candid about his subsequent DUI. This co-worker stated that if it was common knowledge
to notify their FSO of arrests, he would have asked Applicant if he had self-reported and
encouraged  him  to do so.  He  asserts  that  Applicant has  taken  positive  steps  to  better
himself  in  the  last  five  years  and  requests  consideration  of  the  negative  impact  on
Applicant’s personal growth should he lose his clearance. (AE E.)

"The amended SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used (SOR ¶ 1.a) and
purchased (SOR ¶ 1.b) marijuana with varying frequency from August 2019 to present,
including after he completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing
(hereafter  SF  86)  on  April  12,  2021  (SOR  ¶  1.c),  and  he  intends  to  continue  to  use
marijuana in the future (SOR ¶ 1.d). When Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted
the allegations and stated that his uses and purchases were legal under state law. He
explained that he used marijuana recreationally, during non-working hours, and his drug
involvement was candidly disclosed.
Applicant’s  admissions  to  using  and  purchasing  marijuana,  including  since
completing his SF 86, and to intending to continue using marijuana, are accepted and
incorporated in my factual findings. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript,
I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is a  39-year-old principal technical-support engineer with  a  bachelor’s
degree earned in May 2005.  (GE 1; Tr. XX.) He has never married and has no children.
(GE 1; Tr. 15.)
Applicant worked as an implementation engineer after college from May 2005 to
January 2013, when he was laid off by his then employer during a reduction in force. (GE
1.) He held a DOD secret clearance from about 2007 to 2012. (Tr. 13.) He then worked
part time as a software support developer until January 2014. He did not need a clearance
in  that  position  so  his  clearance  eligibility  lapsed.  (Tr.  16.)  In  March  2014,  he  began
working for his current employer, a defense contractor. (GE 1; Tr.15.)
Needing  a  security  clearance  for  a  new  project  with  his  employer,  Applicant
completed an SF 86 on April 12, 2021. (GE 1; Tr. 13.) In response to an SF 86 inquiry
concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years, Applicant reported that he engaged
in  recreational marijuana  use  between  August  2019  and  April 2021.  He  described  the
frequency of his use as “[d]aily partial smoking of a marijuana joint outside/after the work
day.” He responded “Yes” as to his intent regarding future use of the drug and explained
that adult recreational use is legal in his state. Applicant answered “No” to an SF 86 inquiry
into any illegal drug activity, including any involvement in the illegal purchase of a drug or
controlled substance in the last seven years. (GE 1.)
On  July  20,  2021,  Applicant  had  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an
authorized  investigator  for  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  Applicant
explained that he began using marijuana in August 2019, when it became legal to do so in
his state, and that he continued to use it daily since then. He used the drug to relax after
work either alone in his residence or with friends at social gatherings in the friends’ homes.
He stated that he planned to continue to use it, even if granted a security clearance, as he
did  not  want  to  alter his lifestyle and especially because it is legal in his state.  When
advised  that  use  of  marijuana  was  not  allowed  while  having  access  to  sensitive  or
classified information on a federal contract, Applicant stated that he would still continue to
use marijuana, as he had been candid about his use on his SF 86 and during his PSI.
Applicant reported that he had purchased marijuana three to five times, spending about
$100 per occasion, from legal dispensaries in his state since August 2019. He added that
he has been gifted some marijuana from a friend who grows the drug and “has so much of
it.” He accepted the drug from his friend only since his state legalized the possession and
use of marijuana. (GE 2.)
In response to DOHA drug interrogatories, Applicant disclosed on September 7,
2021, that he used marijuana daily from August 2019 to September 2021, and that he
intended to continue using marijuana. He admitted that he associates with persons who
use  marijuana  or frequents places where marijuana  is used  and  added, “when  visiting
some friends’ houses, (once a week or less) [and] concerts (3-4 times a year).” He stated
that he does not use any other illegal substance under federal law and would not do so. He
responded affirmatively regarding any purchases, and stated that he purchased cannabis
occasionally from state “recreational/adult-use facilities spending around $100.” He did not
recall  the  specific  date  of  his  last  purchase  other  than  that  it  was  in  2021.  Applicant
expressed his intention to continue to use cannabis in accord with state law; to purchase it
occasionally from licensed retailers; and to receive gifts of the drug, and added, “There
would be no purchase, sale, or use of any other drugs.” (GE 2.)
At his hearing, Applicant explained that he was first introduced to marijuana while
socializing with a friend who is in a reggae band. (Tr. 20.) He continues to “enjoy cannabis
in a very small way, off work, never during  work hours.”  (Tr. 13.)  His use of marijuana
occurred only in states where adult recreational use is legal. (Tr. 17.) He understands that
marijuana use and possession is illegal under federal law. When asked why he decided to
use marijuana knowing of its illegality under federal law, Applicant responded that, “at the
time, [he] had really no other reason not to.” It was decriminalized and then also legalized.
(Tr. 17-18.) He intends to continue to use marijuana, knowing that it remains the DOD’s
position that marijuana use is incompatible with holding a security clearance. (Tr. 19-21.)
He does not believe that his off-duty use of cannabis adversely affects his ability to handle
sensitive or classified information. (Tr. 14.) He asserted that he would never use marijuana
at work and not while working with classified information. (Tr. 14, 21-22.) He does not
perceive  his  drug  use  as  compromising  his  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  safeguard
sensitive information. (Tr. 22.) His manager is aware that he uses marijuana. The manager
told him it would be in his best interest to stop using marijuana but did not tell him that he
would be required to cease his marijuana use to obtain a clearance. (Tr. 22-23.)

"In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 3.a, and denied SOR ¶¶ 1.b,
and  2.b-2.e.  He  included  a  short  explanation  for  each  allegation.  His  admissions  and
explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  review  of  the  pleadings,
testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  36  years  old.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2015,  and  is  now
attending school to obtain a master’s degree. He was married in 2009, but he and his wife
have been separated since 2020. They were also separated from about 2017-2019. He
has two minor children. He served on active duty in the Air Force from 2008-2012, in the
Air Force Reserve from 2013-2014, and in the Air National Guard from 2014-2019. He
received an honorable discharge. He currently works as a victim notifications specialist
for a government contractor. (Tr. 21-26; GE 1)
On his 2008 SCA, Applicant reported that he used marijuana about 20 times from
January 2004  –  September  2007.  He  stated  that  he  used  it  recreationally  with  friends
before  entering  the  military.  In  his  September  2008  background  interview  with  a
government investigator, he stated that the usage number that he reported was just an
estimate, and the actual number could be double. He stated that he had no intent to use
marijuana again. (Tr. 27-36, 46; GE 3, 4)
On his 2013 SCA, Applicant did not report any illegal drug use in the last seven
years.  This  period  covered  March  2006  to  March  2013,  which  includes  some  of  the
marijuana use he reported on his 2008 SCA. In his April 2013 background interview, he
was  confronted  about  his  earlier  marijuana  use,  and  stated  he  had  no  intent  to  use
marijuana again. He testified that he did not intend to hide his marijuana use, and that he
wanted to explain the situation on the SCA, but failed to do so. (Tr. 36-46; GE 2, 4)
In  2015,  Applicant  applied  for  a  job  that  required  him  to  possess  a  security
clearance. The job also required a pre-employment drug screening as a condition of being
hired.  On  June  16,  2015,  the  employer  submitted  an  incident  report  through  the  Joint
Personnel Adjudication  System  (JPAS), which  stated  that  the  testing lab  notified  them
that  Applicant  tested  positive  for  one  of  the  eight  prohibited  substances,  and  that  in  a
prescreening interview,  he  stated  that  he  had  not  used  illegal  drugs  in  the past  seven
years. The DoD CAF issued him an SOR for the positive urinalysis. In his 2016 answer,
he stated that he does not understand how his urine tested positive for marijuana, and
that the testing office would not give him or the employer any information. He  asserted
that he believed his urine was contaminated at the testing facility through the process that
they used. He provided  no evidence supporting this assertion. In June 2016, the DOD
CAF rejected this explanation, and temporarily revoked his security clearance. In his July
2020 background interview, he stated that this must have been a false positive result. At
the hearing, he testified that he does not know how his urine tested positive for marijuana,
and that he had not used it at that time. (Tr. 27-46; GE 4, 5, 7, 8; AE C-D)
The record shows that on June 16, 2015, the testing lab contacted the employer
so  that  they  could  speak  with  Applicant  about  the  result.  The  employer  provided  the
testing lab with his contact information, and asked him to call the confidential line for the
lab. Not only did Applicant have the opportunity to get information from the testing lab,
they offered to discuss the results with him. Six days later, he emailed the employer and
stated that he ate a protein bar with hemp seeds or oil in it, and that it must have caused
him to test positive for marijuana. At the hearing, he did not mention the hemp protein bar
in his testimony, and there was no assertion about it in his 2020 background interview.
(Tr. 27-46; GE 4, 5, 7, 8; AE C-D)
On  his  2020  SCA,  Applicant  did  not  report any  marijuana  use  in  the  last  seven
years, or use while possessing a clearance. In his July 2020 background interview, he
reported  that he  used marijuana,  while  possessing a  security clearance, from  October
2017 – February 2018. He stated that he purchased it from a friend, and used marijuana
about 8 times. He reported that he was depressed at the time. He stated that he has no
intent  to  use  marijuana  again.  He  reported  that  he  did  not  list  this  usage  on  his  SCA
because he was scared that he would not get the clearance. At the hearing, he testified
that  he  did  not  recall  ever  saying  that.  However,  when  reminded  that  he  verified  the
accuracy of this interview in March 2021, he stated that he did not correct this statement
because of an oversight. He testified that he used marijuana in 2017 because alcohol did
not  suffice  to  deal  with  his  pain,  and  he  was  health  conscious.  He  stated  that  the
marijuana got him through it. He also stated that he could not remember how he obtained
the marijuana, and tried to evade answering the question. He admitted that he knew that
using marijuana with a security clearance was prohibited. He reported that he stopped
using  it  because  he  was  trying  to  get  his  life  back  on  track.  He  stated  that  he  had
counseling for issues relating to his marriage separation, and that his marijuana use was
discussed at the counseling. (Tr.27-36, 47-76: GE 1, 4)
In his March 2021 response to interrogatories, Applicant reported using marijuana
from September 27, 2017 to October 2, 2017, about every other day. At the hearing, he
was asked about the discrepancy in dates from the marijuana use he reported in his July
2020 background interview and his March 2021 interrogatory response. He stated that he
just  gave  an  estimate,  and  that  he  cannot  recall  the  timeframe.  He  said  that  he  was
depressed during this period, and used marijuana over four or five months. He also did
not report his first period of marijuana use  in the interrogatory response, despite being
asked if he “ever used any federally illegal drugs….” He claimed that he thought that he
was just being asked about the last seven years. (Tr. 45, 63-69; GE 4)
Applicant’s  credit  reports  show  a  charged-off  credit-card  account  for  about
$16,000. He asserted that it became delinquent after losing his job in 2019. This debt was
resolved in October 2020 through a settlement agreement with the creditor. (Tr. 50-54;
GE 9-11, 14; AE A, B)
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana from January
2004 to February 2018, including while possessing a security clearance, and that his job
offer was rescinded in 2015 for failing a urinalysis. The SOR alleges under Guideline E
that he falsified his 2013 SCA and 2020 SCA for failing to disclose marijuana use, and
falsified his 2021 interrogatory response for failing to disclose all his marijuana use. The
SOR alleges under Guideline F that he is indebted on a charged-off credit card for about
$16,000.

"SOR ¶  1.a  alleged  that Applicant  illegally  used  nitrous  oxide  between  June  2014
and   January   2020,  and   that  he   intended   to   continue   using   it  in  the   future.  In   his  SOR
answer, Applicant  admitted  the  use,  but denied  his intent to  use  it in  the  future. SOR  ¶
1.b   alleged,   and   Applicant   admitted,   that  he   used   marijuana   from   June   1999   to   about
June   2018.  SOR  ¶   1.c  alleged,  and   Applicant  admitted,   that  he   used   MDMA   (3,   4-
methylenedioxy-methamphetamine   –   Ecstasy/Molly)   in  June   2018.   SOR  ¶   1.d   alleged
that Applicant used  amyl nitrate  (poppers)  between  June  2013  and  June  2017, and  that
he   intended   to   continue   using   “poppers”   in  the   future.  In   his  SOR  answer,  Applicant
admitted the use, but denied his intent to  use it in the  future.
Applicant’s SOR admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough
review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 41 years old. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2004. He married in
2007 and divorced in 2013. He has no children. He has been living with a cohabitant since
2018. Applicant has been working for his clearance sponsor, a federal contractor, since
September 2019. This is his first security clearance application (SCA).
In  Section  23  (Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity)  of  his  March  2020  SCA,
Applicant disclosed that he experimented with marijuana in 1999, and then used it with
varying  frequency  between  2014  and  2018.  He  purchased  the  marijuana  from  state
licensed  dispensaries  to  self-medicate  anxiety  and  focus  issues,  no  more  than  two  to
three times per year, the latest use in 2018. He used amyl nitrate (and similar formulations
of inhalants; poppers) six to eight times a year between 2013 and 2017. He noted he had
not used poppers for several years, but stated his intent to do so in the future.
Applicant  disclosed  he  used  nitrous  oxide  three  to  five  times  per  year  between
2014 and 2020, at social gatherings and for recreational purposes. He stated his intent to
use nitrous oxide in the future. He used MDMA (molly) once in June 2018. He does not
intend to use it in the future. (Item 4)
During his 2020 interviews, government investigators questioned Applicant about
his  illegal  use  of  drugs.  (Item  5)  Applicant  confirmed  his  drug  use  as  disclosed  in  his
March 2020 SCA, but indicated he no longer intended to continue using illegal drugs in
the future, except for nitrous oxide, which he intended to use again, but not regularly. He
admitted to socializing with individuals who use illegal drugs at least twice a year.
Applicant  noted  that  if  he  were  assigned  to  a  position  where  the  use  of  nitrous
oxide  was  prohibited,  he  would  not  use  it.  He  claimed  he  is  now  focused  on  his
professional life and has chosen to settle down his social life, which is why he is no longer
using illegal drugs. He  presented no  documentary evidence to show that he sought or
received any medical or psychological treatment or counseling for substance abuse. He
has never participated in any drug counseling, treatment, or education.

"The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  from  approximately  December
2020  to  about  February  2021,  while  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  in  a  sensitive
position (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that he intends to use marijuana in the future (SOR ¶ 1.b). In
Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a and responded
to SOR ¶ 1.b by saying, “Possibly, I admit.” His admissions are incorporated in my findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  machinist  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since
March  2015.  He  was  employed  in  the  civilian  sector  before  being  hired  by  his  current
employer. He has held a security clearance since about 2017. (Tr. 16.)
Applicant  married  in  May  2003  and  has  three  children,  ages  12,  8,  and  5.  He
attended  a  community college from  August 1999  to  May 2013 and  received  a  general
studies  degree  in  May  2014.  He  attended  a  technical  school from  June  to  September
2014 and received a certificate in September 2014.
When Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he used marijuana twice, in
January  and  February  2021.  (GX  1  at  30-31.)  During  an  interview  with  a  security
investigator in July 2021, he told the investigator that he obtained marijuana from a friend
and used it on one occasion with his wife and a second occasion with  his brother and
sister-in-law. When asked about his motivation for using it, he explained that he knew that
marijuana use was about to be decriminalized in July 2021 in the state where he resides,
and he “just wanted to try it out.” He told the investigator that future use of marijuana was
“probable,” but that he felt no need to use it. He told the investigator that he wanted to
keep his options open because marijuana was legal in the state where he resides. (GX 2
at  5.)  In  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  about  his  intention  to use  marijuana  in  the
future, he responded, “Maybe, no real plans to.” (GX 2 at 11.)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that when he used marijuana on two occasions,
he  was  not  aware  that  it  might  affect  his  security  clearance.  His  employer’s  policy
regarding marijuana use is to send an employee to rehabilitation classes for the first use,
and any subsequent use is grounds for termination. He believed that his employer’s policy
was a “gray area,” similar to alcohol abuse. (Tr. 17-19.)
Applicant testified that he obtained the marijuana from a friend, that he had used
all of it, and that he is “too cheap” to buy any more. (Tr. 21.) He unequivocally stated that
he would not use illegal drugs again, because “it just wasn’t worth it.” He explained that
he likes his job, is not addicted to marijuana, and does not wish to risk losing his job by
smoking  it.  (Tr.  21-22.)  He  was  asked,  “If  you  have  a  choice  between  your  job  and
marijuana, which one are you going to take?” He responded, “Absolutely my job.” (Tr. 26.)
After the hearing, he submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug
use, acknowledging that any future involvement would result in revocation of his security
clearance. His statement was admitted without objection as Applicant’s Exhibit A.
",True
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2011 and is pursuing
another  degree.  He  works  part-time  for  a  company  and  has  worked  for  a  federal
contractor since May 2021. He has never married and has no children.
Applicant disclosed on his June 2021 security clearance application (SCA) that he
began using marijuana sporadically in high school in 1997, and used it more habitually in
his 20s, smoking it on a daily basis and several times a day. During his 30s his usage
declined and be took longer breaks from using marijuana. In the past four years, he has
stopped  seeking  it  out  to  purchase,  and  he  reduced  his  usage.  He  disclosed  that  his
current  usage  was  once  every  couple  of  weeks  while  golfing  with  friends  when  they
provide the marijuana. (Item 2)
Applicant further disclosed in his SCA that he uses marijuana as a way to relax
and enjoy time with his friends and while golfing when he has no responsibilities. He had
no  intention  of  using  marijuana  regularly  or  in  the  evenings.  If  it  were  legalized  at  the
federal level he may consider more regular use, but it was not worth seeking it out at that
point. (Item 2)
Applicant disclosed that he purchased marijuana from September 2000 to August
2017.  He  regularly  purchased  marijuana  from  2014  to  2017.  He  said  he  purchased  it
about every few weeks for a few months, and then there would  be times that he would
not purchase any for a few months. He stated that the reason he purchased marijuana
was  because:  “If  an  individual  wants  their  own  supply  of  marijuana  to  smoke  at  their
leisure,  for any  period  of  time,  they  must  seek  out  an  individual  [who]  sells  it  and  buy
some.” (Item 2) He did not intend to purchase marijuana in the future. (Item 2)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  July 2021.  Applicant
told  the  investigator that  he  did  not have  any intentions to stop  using  marijuana as  he
enjoyed how it makes him feel, and he planned to continue to socialize with his friends
who use marijuana. He further stated he has reduced his marijuana use, but did not plan
to  stop  using  marijuana.  He  said  that  he  purchased  marijuana  once  a  week  from
September 2000 to August 2017. He had no intention of purchasing it in the future. He
has never attended drug counseling, treatment, or drug education classes and has not
had his drug use assessed professionally. He has not been diagnosed as drug dependent
or with drug abuse. (Item 3)
In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR, he  admitted  that from  October 1997  to  May  2021
he   used   marijuana   with   varying   frequency;  from   September   2000   to   August  2017,   he
purchased  marijuana  on  various occasions; and  he  intended  to  continue  using  marijuana
in the  future. (Item 1)
In his SOR answer, Applicant stated:
My use during this time was done with no malice or desire to intentionally
disobey or not comply with any laws, rules, or regulations. I used it simply
from  the  standpoint  that  I  enjoyed  the  sensation  that  consumption  of
marijuana provided along with the social interaction of my friends who were
also experimenting at the time.
* * *
As  I’ve  gotten  older,  my  desire  for  the  sensation  alongside  all  the  other
mitigating factors of acquiring marijuana have waned and discouraged me
from using on any type of regular basis. Those mitigating factors would be
the  people  that  I  would  have  to  associate  with  to  acquire  marijuana,  any
possible  legal  ramifications  that  may  occur  if  I  would  get  caught  with  the
substance, and any negative circumstances that may affect my job or career
due to the previous two factors. (Item 1)
Applicant explained  in  his answer that his use  of  marijuana  did  not impact his ability
to  be  responsible  and  show  up  for  work and  perform  his assigned  tasks. He  further stated
that “I think it would be  ignorant to  deny  it didn’t have  any  effect, but it is reasonable to
say that effect has been  minimal.” (Item 1)  He stated that his use of marijuana  has never
had   any   negative   repercussions  with   law   enforcement  and   he   has never received   any
citations with regard to his use and possession of  marijuana. (Item 1)
Applicant  stated   in  his  SOR  answer  that  he   purchased   marijuana   because   he
“wanted  to  enjoy  that  sensation  on  my  own  terms with  a  frequency  that was determined
by me.” (Item  1) He  further explained:
When  a person  reaches a  point where they  decide  to  enjoy  a  substance at
their   own   leisure,  at  their   own   pace,  they   must  seek  out  a   source  to
purchase  it from. Because  these  substances are illegal, it creates a  black
market  where individuals can  acquire  their  desired  substance. If  a  person
desires  a   substance,  they   are  going   to   find  a   way  to   get  it  and   it doesn’t
matter what  the  substance  is  and  in many  cases it  doesn’t  matter what  the
consequences are.  I have  never sought  out any  other substances beyond
marijuana because  of the  mitigating factors I  mentioned [previously].
I have  not purchased  any  marijuana  in  several years and  the  primary  reason
for  that  is  because   everything   around   the   hassle  of  finding   and   buying   it
became  more than  I wanted  to  deal with, and  it didn’t  seem  worth  it to  me
anymore.   I   didn’t   like   the  people   I would   have  to  interact   with, and  it was
difficult to  find  a  good  reliable source that also  had  good  product.  It reached
a  point  that the  sensation  I felt from  marijuana  wasn’t worth  the  things I had
to go through to acquire it.  (Item  1)
Regarding Applicant’s intent to continue to use marijuana, he stated in his
answer to the SOR the following:
I  admit  to  expressing  at  least  a  desire  or  intention  to  continue  to  use
marijuana in the future. My intention to use marijuana in the future is not
meant to be done with any malice or with the intention to defy laws, rules,
or  regulations.  My  use  currently  is  sporadic.  I  play  golf  a  couple  times  a
month with friends and if one of them happens to offer some, I will partake.
I enjoy the feeling and being able to relax while I’m out having fun with my
friends. I only do it when I have no responsibilities to worry about during my
free  time.  I  have  no  intention  to  use  with  any  regularity  or  purchase  any
marijuana at any point in the future.
If I had a job that tested regularly or required me to not use, I would have
no  problem  adhering  to  that  policy. Which  is  an  example  of  my  ability  to
follow laws, rules, and regulations, if need be, as well as be responsible.
(Item 1)
Applicant also stated that he was told by his bosses and colleagues the importance
of being honest during the security clearance process and he has been honest and he is
trustworthy.  He  chose  to  be  forthcoming  about  his  illegal  drug  use  in  his  SCA  and
investigation.
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he stated that a lot of time had passed since
he  indicated  his  intent  to  continue  using  marijuana.  His  SOR  answer  was  in  February
2022  and  his  FORM  response  was  in  July  2022.  He  then  stated  that  he  was  not
completely sure of what his statement meant when he made it. He reiterated that he was
told to be honest and he was. He stated he had expressed a willingness to discontinue
his marijuana use in the future if it was worth it and his present job is worth it. He said his
job  is  too  important  to  him  to  jeopardize  it  by  continuing  to  use  marijuana.  Applicant’s
response continued with an analysis of the decriminalization of marijuana in many states
and  proposals  in  Congress  to  decriminalize  it  federally  and  a  bill  to  forbid  the  use  of
marijuana to be used to determine eligibility for a security clearance. (AE A)
Applicant further stated that because he disclosed his marijuana use it shows his
overall  trustworthiness  and  honesty.  He  reiterated  he  has  had  no  interaction  with  law
enforcement or history of arrests. He has no intention of disobeying any laws, rules, or
regulations he must adhere to in order to hold a security clearance. He further stated that
ld  not bring  his marijuana activity  to  court
a  high  percentage  of people  in  the  country wou
and   this  indicates  that   they   do   not  see   his  conduct  as  a   risk  to   national  security.  He
believes his willingness to  disclose  his  past and  be  honest  should  outweigh  his past drug
involvement. He  said he  does  his  job,  pays his bills and  taxes,  goes home and enjoys “a
few of  the liberties I still have.” (AE A)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b,
and SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.c, but denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 3..a, regarding falsification of
his October 2017 and February 2, 2021 SCAs in response to Section 23 –Illegal Use of
Drugs or Drug Activity and Illegal Use of Drugs or Controlled Substances in the last seven
years,  and  while  possessing  a  security  clearance  have  you  ever  illegally  used  or
otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance by answering “No”; and SOR
¶ 3.b. as cross-alleged under SOR ¶ 2.a through 2.c. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact (Item 1)
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  systems  engineer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  November  2015.  He  is  unmarried  and  has  no  children.  He  obtained  an
undergraduate degree in 2014. He reported no military service.  Applicant has worked for
defense  contractors  since  2014,  with  short  periods  of  unemployment  when  he  was
working  on  personal  projects  from  November  2014  until  June  2015.  He  obtained  a
security clearance in 2017. (Item 2)
Guideline J: Criminal Conduct
The allegation in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b involved an arrest in November 2014, with a
charge of possession of marijuana, and the alleged arrest in May 2019, with a charge of
possession  of  marijuana.  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  but  noted  that  the
marijuana  was  obtained  through  dispensaries  and  used  for  sleep  assistance  and  to
increase his appetite. For his 2014 marijuana possession offense, he was charged with
a misdemeanor, first offense, received a ticket, probation, and a fine. (Items 1, 4)
In  Applicant’s  2021,  personal  subject  interview  (PSI),  he  volunteered  to  the
investigator that he was offered marijuana by his cousin, and purchased some marijuana
from him in 2014. (Item 4) He put some marijuana in his vehicle trunk on the way home,
and was stopped for speeding by a police officer. Applicant was  taken to jail, and was
able to bail himself out. The PSI report states that he went to court at some point and he
“was told to submit dismissal paperwork.” (Item 4) Applicant told the investigator that later
he found out the case was dismissed.
Guideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance  Abuse
In  his  answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  three  SOR  allegations  that  he  used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  2012  to  about  July  2021  (2.a);  that  he
purchased  and  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  2012  to  about  July
2021 2.b; and 2.c, that he purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from
about July 2018 to about July 2021, while granted access to classified information. (Item
1)
However, in that same answer, he  stated that the  “time  span was persuaded by
the investigator during the interview as a general from and to date.”  During his 2018 PSI,
he stated that “estimated months and dates noted are fairly accurate.”
Applicant volunteered information about the May 2019 arrest for purchase and use
of marijuana from his cousin. He told the investigator that it was an open case because
he  did  not  know  that  his  case  had  been  fully  dismissed.  (Item  4)  It  is  not  clear  what
Applicant meant by that statement.
Applicant used marijuana in college from 2012 to 2014. He also used marijuana
perhaps once a year over the next couple of years for recreational use. He stated that he
purchased from vendors in states where marijuana was legal from 2019 to the present
when he was on vacation.  Applicant was drug tested when he was hired and stated that
he understood the employer  policy on illegal drug use, and that it is against policy to use
marijuana while in federal employment. He believes that the legalization of marijuana is
coming  and that it should not be an issue. (Item 4)
Applicant stated that he used the marijuana also to assist with his anxiety and to
make  him  feel  relaxed  and  creative.  He  emphasized  that  he  has  not  developed  any
dependency  on  marijuana  and  has  had  no  counseling  or  treatment.  He  compares  his
marijuana use to alcohol. His future intent does not include the use of marijuana, so that
he  can  keep  his  job  and  security  clearance.  Applicant  would  use  it  if  marijuana  was
legalized. However, currently he will refrain from marijuana use, although he could not
rule out using marijuana in the future if it is legalized. He stressed that his use of marijuana
has “no criminal intent.” (Item 4)
Guideline E:  Personal Conduct
The SOR alleged in SOR 3.a and 3.b that Applicant falsified material facts on his
October  17,  2017  and  February  2,  2021  SCAs  by  answering  “NO”  to  the  questions  in
Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs of Drug Activity as set forth in subparagraph 1.a and
1.b, and 2.a through 2.c above. It further alleged that had he denied ever using drugs or
otherwise being involved with a drug substance while possessing a security clearance
and he answered “NO.”
Applicant  denied  the  falsification  allegations  because  he  believes  he  made  a
mistake in assuming the other sections correlated. He claimed he answered the question
incorrectly by an honest mistake. He believes the process to be very difficult. He added
that due to having previously submitted SCAs and having pre-populated information the
resubmission had an error in it. He added that he would be willing to discuss any items
with the investigator if needed. He stated that he did not report the use because he did
not believe it was serious. (Item 4) He has held a security clearance since 2017. On both
SCAs,  he  answered  “NO.”  to  have  you  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been  illegally
involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other
than previously listed? He did not add any information concerning this issue in his 2022
DOHA interrogatories. He insisted in his subject interview that he was never going to list
the information concerning use of marijuana on his SCA because he wanted to tell an
investigator whenever he was interviewed. He admitted that he was properly trained on
reporting of  such issues, but just did not think about it when he recertified his security
clearance  application.  (Item  4)  Applicant  made  no  clarifications  to  his  reasons  for
omission except that he would disclose to the investigator.

with his employment.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the  Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.
The SOR alleged that Applicant has used and purchased marijuana with varying
frequency from about July 2006 to at least February 2022; that he has been arrested in
May  2018  for  Possession  of  Marijuana,  among  other  things;  and  that  he  intends  to
continue  using  marijuana  in  the  future.  Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations  with
explanations.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant explained that he has used marijuana over the years to treat symptoms
of back pain and depression.  This use has occurred on a weekly basis over the years.
He  also  stated  that  he  plans  to  continue  using  marijuana  in  the  future.  (Government
Exhibit 6.)  He stated that he would be willing to discontinue his marijuana use if that is
a  requirement  of  his  security  clearance  process.  He  does  not  believe  that  his  use  of
marijuana constitutes “drug abuse,” and notes that marijuana is legal in the state where
he resides.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
In  May  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  Hashish-Possession
(felony), Possession of Controlled Substance (felony), Marijuana Possession with Intent
(felony),  Marijuana  Possession  - More  than  1  oz,  less  than  1  lb,  Narcotic  Equipment-
Possession.  Applicant admits the allegation.  On this occasion, Applicant believes that
the  search  of  his  vehicle  was  illegal  under  the  4th  amendment.  He  contends  that  his
purchase  of  the  substance  was  legal,  and  his use  of  the  substance  was  personal and
medicinal.  (Government Exhibit 7.)
Applicant further notes that his purchases of marijuana have all been legal.  He
stated  that  he  has  always  paid  taxes  on  the  marijuana  he  purchased.  He  has  never
been involved in any criminal distribution networks.  (Government Exhibit 3.)

employed as a chief technical officer since August 2010. He reports no military service.
(Item 3) Applicant has held a security clearance for more than a decade. He completed
his latest security clearance application (SCA) on May 5, 2021.
The SOR alleged, under Guideline H, that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency from  about January 2000,  to  the  present  (1.a);  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency from 2014 to the present, while granted access to classified information  1.b;
was arrested in about August 2005 and charged with possession of marijuana (1.c); and
intends to continue using marijuana in the future. (1.d) In his Answer, Applicant admitted
the  SOR  allegations  under  Guideline  H  with  explanations.  The  SOR  alleged,  under
Guideline  E,  that  Applicant  falsified  his  March  9,  2011  SCA  by failing  to  report  his  full
illegal  drug  usage  in  the  last  seven  years  in  response  to  Section  23.  (2.a);  and  his
January  26,  2010  SCA  by  stating  that  his  2005  arrest  was  the  only  time  that  he  had
used marijuana  (2.b); and  it  also  cross alleged  the information from  SOR  1.b and  1.d.
Applicant admitted the Guideline E allegations with explanations. (Item 1)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations ¶¶1.a through
1.d,  as  stated  above.  He  stated  that  his  occasional  use  of  marijuana  did  not
compromise his reliability, trustworthiness, integrity, or dedication to the United States.
He  emphasized  that  he  never  used  or  had  been  under  the  influence  during  work  or
while  accessing  classified  information.  He  claimed  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana
completely  from  about  2011  to  2014,  while  working  for  the  Federal  Government.  He
stated that he stopped due to agency regulations. Applicant emphasized that his arrest
occurred over 15 years ago and that the record was expunged over ten years ago. He
further  noted  that  this was  the  only incident  he  ever  had  with  law  enforcement.  In  the
final part of his answer, he stated that his expected use will be “consistent with past use,
which  will be  occasional and  limited.”  Applicant stated that  “his openness and honesty
about his past, present, and future use of marijuana should prove that he is trustworthy
and deserving of a favorable determination.” (Item 2)
As  to  the  SOR  allegations  ¶¶  2.a  through  2.c,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  only
disclosed  on  his  2011  SCA  the  2005  arrest  for  marijuana  but  not  the  other  times  he
used marijuana. It was his understanding that the use of marijuana would always result
in an unfavorable adjudication. He was “worried that if he answered “Yes”, he would not
receive  a  clearance  and  lose  his  job,  not  be  able  to  take  care  of  his family  or pay  his
mortgage. (Item 2)
Applicant completed his most recent SCA on May 5, 2021. (Item 3) He disclosed
two  decades  of  marijuana  use  and  indicated  his  intent  to  cease  his  further  use  of
marijuana” on an unspecified date in  the  future, as  he  values his clearance above  the
occasional use of marijuana. (Government Response to Applicant’s  FORM Response);
(Item 6) He admitted on his own  volition  that  he  was  not candid  in describing his past
marijuana use on his latest SCA. He asserted that he was forthcoming and honest in his
answer to the May 2022 SOR issued to him, aware that his doing so may result in his
loss of a security clearance. (Item 2)
In Applicant’s response to his first SCA in 2010, he disclosed his 2005 arrest for
possession of marijuana and resisting arrest, as required. (Item 5). Ultimately dismissed
and expunged from Applicant’s record, he expressed embarrassment over this incident
in his answer. He stated that he was hanging out with the wrong people and committed
to staying away from marijuana. “I have not and will not make the bad decisions that put
me  in  that  situation  again.”  In  Applicant’s  March  2011  SCA  he  reiterated  the  same
concerning his marijuana use on the 2010 SCA.  (Items 4, 5)
In  Applicant’s  response  to  FORM  through  counsel,  he admitted  that  he felt  sick
and  disappointed  with  himself  for  using  marijuana  again  after  he  decide  to  stay  away
from  marijuana.  On  the  January  2010  SCA,  he  only  reported  the  2005  arrest  for
possession  of  marijuana  and  not  the  total  use.  (Item  6);  and  that  he  again  reported
inaccurately on his March 2011  SCA; and that he was granted a secret clearance and
stated that he did not use marijuana at that time. He also indicated that he did not use
marijuana for a period but then resumed use in mid-2014. He noted that his clearance
was  deactivated  from  February  2018  through  April  2020.  On  his  May  5,  2021,  SCA,
Applicant  characterized  all  of  his  marijuana  use  as  recreational  and  asserted  that  he
ceased use from 2010 through 2014. (Item 3 and Item 6)
Applicant  noted  that  he  is  the  primary  earner  in  his  family  and  is  engaged  with
the community. He coaches his son’s baseball team and volunteers. (Item 6)
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his

marijuana that he illegally used for 20 years. SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b. The SOR also cross
alleged  the  information  set  forth  in  SOR  1.b  and  1.d.  Applicant  admitted  the  E
allegations  and  that  he  was  intending  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.  (Item  2)  He

"Applicant is 40 years old.  He has a Bachelor’s degree.  He holds the position of
Senior  Cyber  Security  Engineer.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in
connection with his employment.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.
Applicant  began  working for his current employer in  2011.  He  is applying for a
security  clearance  for the  first  time.  As  part of  the  application  process,  he  completed
the  security  clearance  application  (SF-86)  dated  June  2,  2019.  In  the  application,  he
denied any illegal drug use.  During a subsequent subject interview, Applicant admitted
that  he  has  used  marijuana  on  a  regular  basis  since  2005,  and  that  he  answered  the
question on the application incorrectly.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant has used marijuana from about 2005 to at least July 2019 with varying
frequency.  Applicant  stated  that  he  smokes  on  average  between  five  to  ten  hits  from
the vape pen per weekly use.  He  further stated that he has never purchased,  sold or
manufactured  marijuana.  He  plans  to  continue  using  marijuana  for  recreational
purposes, unless he has to quit in order to obtain a security clearance.  Applicant stated
that his friends know that he smokes marijuana, but his parents do not.  He has never
received nor has ever felt the need to receive drug treatment or counseling of any sort.
(Government Exhibit 4.)
Applicant  also  stated  that  he  has  never  abused  any  other  kind  of  illegal  drugs
and has never abused prescription drugs or alcohol.  (Government Exhibit 4.)

"In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, with explanations. His
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence,
I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a federal contractor working as an aircraft
electrician since March 2022. He holds an associate’s degree and a certification. He is
single, never married, and has no children. He was unemployed from October 2019 to
February 2020, February 2015 to January 2016, and March 2013 to October 2013.  (Tr.
4, 6, 24-25; GE 1)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts (student loans, car
debt, medical debt, and other consumer debts) totaling approximately $54,119. The debts
are established by credit reports from September 2020, April 2021, June 2021, and July
2022; Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator in October 2020;
and his SOR response admissions (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h). (GE 3, 5-8; Answer to SOR)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency from about January 2011 to January 2017. This allegation is established by
Applicant’s admissions to an investigator during his October 2020 PSI, his admissions in
his January 2021 security clearance application (SCA), and his admissions in his SOR
response (SOR ¶ 2.a). (GE 2-3; Answer to SOR)
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material
facts in his August 2020 SCA when he failed to list his marijuana use, as described in
SOR ¶ 2.a, in Section 23 of the SCA. It also alleged that Applicant falsified material facts
in his August 2020 and January 2021 SCAs when he failed to list his delinquent debts,
as described in SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h, in Section 26 of the SCAs. (SOR ¶¶ 3.a – 3.c)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  began  after  he  finished  school  and  received  his
associate’s degree and his certificate. He financed his education with student loans. He
stated that at one time he had approximately $140,000 worth of student-loan debt. All but
approximately $60,000 of it was forgiven because the school that funded the loans went
out of business. He provided no corroboration for this assertion.
The   history   and   current  status  of  Applicant’s  student  loans  is  as   follows:  His
September 2020  credit  report  reflects  that a  national student-loan-servicing  company  was
assigned  Applicant’s student loans in  April 2015, with  a  balance  of $29,856.  The  date  of
last   activity   is  listed   as  May   2018.  The   status  of   the   loans  is  listed   as  “closed”  and   a
“charged-off  account.” The  credit report also  reflects that the  account was “purchased  by
another  lender.”   His  most   recent   credit   report  from   July   2022   still   shows  the   loans   as
charged  off. This credit report also lists 15  other student loans in the  name  of  a  federal
agency, with  a  total balance  of approximately  $59,648. None  of  these  loans show  a  “past
due” characterization  on  the  credit report. Applicant stated  that these  loans are currently
deferred, although  he  was not sure of  the  reason  for the  deferment.  Most likely, these
student  loans  are  deferred   because   of   the   Presidential  Executive   Order  deferring   all
student-loan  payments  and  interest accumulation  because  of the  COVID-19  pandemic.
There is no  evidence  linking  the  SOR listed  charged-off  student loans  with  the  15  currently
deferred student loans. (Tr. 30-32, 48, 66; GE 5, 8)
Applicant  claimed  that  the  car debt list  in SOR ¶  1.c was erroneous because  he
held  the   title   to   the   car.  He  did  not  produce   documentation   to   corroborate   that   he
possessed   a   free   and   clear  title   for  the   car.   For  all   the   remaining   delinquent  debts,
Applicant  claimed   that   he   paid   a   debt  repair   company   (DRC)  approximately   $3,000   in
August 2020. Once  he  hired  the  DRC, he  believed  it would “clean-up” his debt. He was
advised  by  the  DRC not to  pay  any  of  the  debts so  they  would “drop  off” his credit report.
Aside  from  his one-time  payment  to  the  DRC,  he  has  not made  any  payments  toward  his
SOR  debts.   He   stated   that   he   would  produce   documentation   showing   his  contractual
arrangement with  the  DRC. He did not do  so. SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.g  are based  upon  the
same underlying debt and  therefore, I  find  for Applicant on SOR ¶ 1.g. (Tr.24, 29-30, 41-
42, 63, 68-69-70; GE  5)
Applicant’s annual salary is between $50,000 and $60,000. He does not have any
savings currently. He is living in a recreational vehicle that his brother financed. He pays
his brother $800 per month to repay this loan. (Tr. 72, 74)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  admitted  in  his  testimony  that  he  used  marijuana  infrequently  starting
when his was about 22. He was not working for a federal contractor then. He knew it was
illegal  when  he  used  it.  He  listed  on  his  January  2021  SCA  that  he  stopped  using
marijuana in 2017, but he does not really recall the date. On cross-examination, he stated
that he had not used marijuana in the last two years. He understood that marijuana use
is illegal under federal law and prohibited by federal contractor employees. His company
does random drug testing and he was tested three times before he was hired.
Personal Conduct
Applicant failed to list his marijuana use under Section 23 of his August 2020 SCA.
He listed that activity when he completed his January 2021 SCA. He explained that the
reason for his omission on his earlier SCA was because he was not at his home when he
was completing it, and he did not have access to records that would  have  helped him
remember his activities seven years back. In between his first and second SCAs, he was
interviewed by an investigator in October 2020 and failed to disclose his marijuana use
between 2011 and 2017. When he completed the second SCA in January 2021, he was
at his home location. He also contacted people at work and asked about  this question,
and he was told to list his marijuana use on the SCA. I did not find Applicant’s explanation
credible. (Tr. 33-35; GE 1-2)
Applicant also failed to list his delinquent debts on either of his SCAs when asked
to do so in Section 26 of each one. Applicant explained that he did not list the debts on
his SCAs because he had hired the DRC and believed his debts were being resolved. He
admitted on cross-examination that he was asked about his debts  and made aware of
their delinquent status when he was interviewed by an investigator in October 2020. He
claimed he had no intent to deceive the government about his debt status. I did not find
Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 40-42, 61; GE 1-2)

Since August 2019, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item 3.)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  (1)  used  marijuana  with
varying  frequency  from  about  February  1994  to  present;  (2)  currently  uses  marijuana
daily;  (3)  has  grown  marijuana  from  about  2002  to  present;  (4)  used  marijuana  after

charged  with  violating  the  Uniform  Controlled  Substances  Act  and  possessing
instruments of a crime. (Item 1.)
Applicant admitted the Guideline H allegations, noting that his use was primarily
medicinal and personal, which is legal in his home state. He also corrected the year he
began growing marijuana to 2012, not 2002, as alleged. Finally, Applicant answered that
he did not recall the exact charges of his 1998 arrest. (Item 3.)  The record supports the
SOR offenses charged in Applicant’s 1998 arrest. (Item 6.) In his SCA, Applicant stated
that he grows his own marijuana in quantities that are within his home state’s legal limits.
He has not sold or purchased marijuana in a decade. (Item 4.)
Applicant uses marijuana daily, because it helps relax him and controls his anxiety.
He only uses it in the evening after his children have been put to bed. Applicant has never
engaged in drug trafficking or the misuse of prescription drugs. His use has not affected
his  personal,  professional,  emotional  health,  reputation,
financial
responsibility.  Applicant  could  stop  his  use  at  any  time,  if  it  were  required  by  his
employment. (Item 5 at Personal Subject Interview (PSI).) He intends to use marijuana in

Law and Policies
It   is  well   established   that  no   one   has  a   right  to   a   security   clearance.  As  the
that  security
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
indicates
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
The adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a),
the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the
“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
A2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to
classified  information  will  be  resolved  in favor of  the  national security.” In  reaching  this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on
the  evidence  contained  in  the  record.  Likewise,  I  have  avoided  drawing  inferences
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.”
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
Under AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into
question a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG
¶ 24 sets forth the concern, as follows:
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription
and  non-prescription  drugs,  and  the  use  of  other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their
intended  purpose  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual's  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior  may  lead  to  physical  or
psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises  questions  about  a  person's
ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  Controlled
substance means any ""controlled substance""  as defined  in 21  U.S.C.§  802.
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions or factors:
AG ¶ 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);
AG  ¶  25(c)  illegal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance  .  .  .
cultivation . . . ; and
including
AG ¶ 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance
abuse . . . .
The only potentially applicable mitigating factor here is quoted below:
AG  ¶  26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment.
Applicant admitted  that he  has been  using  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
about  February   1994   to   present,  including   daily   use   currently,  that  he   has  grown
marijuana  from  about  2012  to  present  for his personal use,  and  purchased  marijuana  from
about  February   1994   to   at  least  2002.  He  was  arrested   in  about  August  1998   in
possession  of marijuana  and  charged  with  violating  the  Uniform  Controlled  Substances
Act  and   possessing   instruments  of   a   crime.   He  also  admitted   he   intended   to   continue
using   marijuana   in   the   future,   unless  it   is  prohibited   by   his  employer  or  he   is  actively
holding a security clearance.  Facts admitted  by an applicant in an SCA, an  answer to an
SOR,  or in  an  interview  require no  further proof  from  the  Government.  ISCR  Case  No.
94-1159   at  4   (App.  Bd.  Dec.   4,  1995)  (“any   admissions  [applicant]   made   to   the   SOR
allegations . . . relieve  Department Counsel of  its burden  of  proof”); ISCR  Case  No.  94-
0569   at   4   and   n.1   (App.  Bd.  Mar.  30,  1995)  (“[a]n   applicant’s  admissions,  whether
testimonial or written, can provide  a legal basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”).
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated
by  the  federal government under the  Controlled  Substances Act.  21  U.S.C. §  811  et seq.
The  knowing  or intentional possession  and  use  of  any  such  substance  is unlawful and
punishable  by   imprisonment,   a   fine   or  both.  21   U.S.C.  §   844.   In   an   October  25,  2014
memorandum, the  Director of  National Intelligence  affirmed  that the  use  of  marijuana  is
a  security  concern.  James R. Clapper, Director of  National Intelligence, Memorandum:
Adherence   to   Federal   Laws  Prohibiting   Marijuana   Use  (October  25,  2014).  See   also
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml
More recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed
the memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana
for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal
law  remains  unchanged  with  respect  to  the  illegal  use,  possession,  production  and
distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited  by  law  from  using  controlled  substances.  Disregard  of  federal  law
pertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal, or recreational marijuana use) remains
relevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use
the “whole-person concept” stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant’s
behavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
Because of Applicant’s past use of marijuana and his expressed intent to use in the
future, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 25(a), (c), and (g) apply here. The next inquiry is
whether any mitigating factors apply.
I  have  considered  mitigating  factor  AG  ¶  26(a).  Applicant  began  using  marijuana
almost 30 years ago.  Therefore, the inception of his use was long ago. He has, however,
continued his regular use to the present day. And Applicant intends to continue to use
marijuana. His use has been frequent, and Applicant plans to continue using marijuana
in the future, unless it conflicts with his employment or his security clearance. His use is
not mitigated by AG ¶ 26(a).
Guideline E – Personal Conduct
In assessing an allegation of detrimental personal conduct, I consider not only the
allegation and applicant’s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and
2(f)(1)-(6) (explaining the whole person concept). Under Guideline E for personal conduct,
the  concern  is  that  “[c]onduct  involving  questionable  judgment  …  or  unwillingness  to
comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,
trustworthiness, and ability classified or sensitive information.” Guideline E and Guideline
H  have  common  concerns  relevant  to  an  applicant’s  care  in  handling  classified  or
sensitive information. Those concerns must be carefully observed in the national security
arena. Therefore, Applicant’s conduct has not been mitigated.
Whole Person Concept
The record raises doubts about  Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment,
and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not
met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph 1, Guideline H:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a.- 1.f:
Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 2.a:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant access to classified information.

"In  her  answer  to  the  SOR, Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  contained  in  SOR  ¶¶
1.a  and  1.b.  Her  admissions  are accepted as findings of  fact.
Applicant is 30 years old. She is unmarried and graduated from high school in May
2011.  She  has  been  enrolled  in  college  since  2020  and  she  is  pursuing  a  bachelor’s
degree. (Tr. 33) She has become a firefighter. (Tr. 63)
While  in  high  school,  Applicant  began  working  with  a  military  recruiter.  She
submitted her first security clearance application (SCA) in November 2010. In it, she did
not disclose that she used cocaine and marijuana while in high school. (Tr. 26-29; GE 2)
She did not include  that  information on the advice  or her recruiter.  She  enlisted in  the
Marines when she turned 18 years old in 2011. (Tr. 30-32) She subsequently received a
security clearance.
Applicant testified that she began using marijuana in May 2010 while she was in
high school. The last time she used it was in August 2017, before she took a position with
a defense contractor. She estimated that she has used it 15 to 20 times. She used cocaine
once while in high school (Tr. 28, 68-69)
In September 2011, Applicant entered active duty and went to boot camp. (Tr. 34)
From 2012 to 2014, she was stationed overseas. While there, she was sexually assaulted
twice. (Tr. 38) In 2013, Applicant received an Article 15 or nonjudicial punishment (NJP)
for  wrongful  interference  with  an  adverse  administrative  proceeding.  (Tr.  47)  She  was
reduced from an E-3 to E-2 and was denied reenlistment. She left the Marines in 2015,
and went to the Marine Corps Reserve until 2016. (Tr. 47, 50-52; GE 4)
After returning to the states in 2014, Applicant used Ecstasy (Molly), an illegal drug,
with a friend who gave it to her. She used it twice between 2014 and the time she left the
Marines  in  2015.  She  used  it  to  “numb”  herself  from  past  traumas  (including  sexual
assaults) and her distress over leaving the Marine Corps. She held a security clearance
at the time. (Tr. 49-52, 60, 86-88)
Applicant  was  aware  that  using   marijuana   while  she   was  in  the   Marines  was  a
violation  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ). She  estimated  she  used  it five
separate  times  during  her service.  She  held  a  security  clearance  at that time. (Tr. 72,  78-
79)  After  leaving   the   Marine   Corps   Reserve   in   2016,   she   used   it  twice  with   a   former
boyfriend  between  July 2017  and  August  2017. She  never purchased  marijuana. (Tr. 81-
82; GE 4)
From August 2017 to July 2020  Applicant worked for a defense contractor. She
deployed to the Middle East to provide assistance to the contractor’s management teams.
(Tr. 53) She continues to work for the contractor on a part-time basis. Currently, she works
fulltime for a non-profit organization that provides mental health services to veterans. (Tr.
22, 64-65)
In  October 2017, Applicant  submitted  her  second  security clearance  application
(SCA-2), after starting the above position with a defense contractor. In it, she disclosed
that she used marijuana from June 2008, while in high school, to August 2017, which was
a month before she started her position with the defense contractor. She disclosed that
she used Ecstasy between 2014 and 2017. (Tr. 67; GE 1 at 35-36) In December 2017,
her security clearance was suspended pending this investigation. (GE 3)
While testifying Applicant disclosed that she smoked marijuana, one time, with a
friend  in  August  2022,  about  two  months  before  the  hearing.  She  was  having  trouble
sleeping and decided to use it. (Tr. 85) She regrets her decision. She knew at that time
she  was  going  to  appear  at  this  hearing.  (Tr.  86,  94)  She  also  believed  that  it  was
important to be honest about her drug use. (Tr. 61)
Applicant  submitted  a  statement  in  which  she  acknowledged  her  past  use  of
marijuana, cocaine, and Ecstasy, and her intention not to use illegal drugs in the future.
If she were granted a security clearance, she agreed to an automatic revocation of it if
she involved herself in future substance abuse. (AE G)
Applicant has not participated in a substance abuse program. (Tr. 90) She has not
sought  treatment  for  her  history  of  childhood  abuse  or  post-traumatic  stress  disorder
(PTSD),  which  a  psychiatrist  recently  diagnosed  during  a  disability  interview.  The
psychiatrist recommended that she participate in therapy and try medication. To date, she
has not followed through with that medical advice. (Tr.  95-97)
Applicant submitted five letters of recommendation. All authors are aware of her
past drug issues and the NJP she received. They attest to her competency, honesty and
dedication to service. (AE A through E.)

"Applicant  admitted  the  three  allegations  listed  in  the  SOR,  with  explanations.
He  admitted  using  marijuana  from  2009  to  July  2022,  including  use  of  the  drug  after
completing  and  certifying  an  e-QIP  on  November 30,  2021.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  He  observed
that  use  of  the  drug  was  legal  in  his  state.  He  understands  that  marijuana  use  is  not
permitted  while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  He  has  not  used  the  drug  since  his
vacation in July 2022. Applicant stated that his doctor condoned use of the drug to ease
depression  and  anger  issues  that  led  to  Applicant’s  opiate  addiction.  The  word
“condone” means forgive. I find the more appropriate word in the context of Applicant’s
answer to this allegation is that his doctor “advocated” the use of marijuana to improve
or diminish Applicant’s depression and anger issues.
Applicant  indicated  that  testing  positive  for  marijuana  in  September  2009,
leading  to  his  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions  United  States  Army

his discharge, Applicant characterized his performance as top-notch.
Applicant  admitted  using  the  prescription  medications  Percocet,  Vicodin,  and
OxyContin,  not  prescribed  to  him,  from  about  May  2008  to  September  2017.  He  has
received  treatment  since  November  2017  for  a  condition  diagnosed  as  opiate
dependence. Though  Applicant’s life  was chaotic during  the  period  of dependence, his
job performance exceeded expectations. He considers himself very honest and patriotic
like his two grandfathers who served in foreign wars. (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant is 41 years old. He was married from June 1996 to October 2010. He
served  in  the  United States Army  (USA)  Air National Guard  (ANG)  from  June  1999  to
December  2009,  when  he  received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions
because he tested positive for marijuana in a September 2009 urinalysis. Following his
discharge,  he  purchased  a  home  in  April  2014.  He  has  been  living  with  his  girlfriend
since  September  2017,  and  has  a  two-year-old  son  from  this  relationship.  Since  July
2007,  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  a  master  technician  for  a  defense  contractor.
(Item 3 at 6-18; Item 4 at 1)
Applicant  described  his  purchase  and  use  of  narcotics  and  prescription
medications  not  prescribed  to  him  between  May  2008  and  September  2017.  He
indicated  that  he  never  had  a  security  clearance,  but  the  ANG  processed  security
clearance paperwork. He did not know the outcome of the processing. (Item 1 at 23-28)
On August 9, 2022, Applicant swore that he read the January 10, 2022 PSI and
attested  to  its  accuracy.  Regarding  the  January  14,  2022  PSI  with  Applicant,  the
investigator faxed two specific releases related to Applicant’s treatment. He signed and
returned  the  releases.  Applicant  swore  that  the  additional  information  he  provided  in
response  to  the  interrogatories  was  true  and  correct.  His  signature,  which  appears on
the last page of the interrogatories, is dated August 8, 2022. (Item 4 at 1-11) (Item 4 at
9)
SOR ¶ 1.a –  Applicant used marijuana once or twice a week from 2009 to the
January 8,  2022.  He  ingested  the  drug from either a  pipe  or a  vaporizer.  He  uses  the
drug  to  relax  when  he  is  at  home.  Until  purchase  of  the  drug  became  legal  in  a  state
nearby (State X), he would purchase it from drug sellers or acquaintances. He travels to
State  X  to  purchase  the  drug  legally,  and  uses  it  in  State  Y,  where  recreational
possession and use of marijuana is legal. Applicant omitted the marijuana use from his
November 2021 e-QIP because it was an oversight. (Item 4 at 6-7, 10)
Applicant’s  marijuana  use  has  not  produced  any  legal  or  disciplinary  action,
except  for  the  discharge  in  December  2009.  After  the  OPM  investigator  informed
Applicant in January 2022 that recreational use of marijuana was not legal at the federal
level,  and  could  affect  his  security  clearance  application,  Applicant  indicated  that  he
would  stop  immediately.  There  is  no  indication  that  he  stopped.  Rather,  he  stated  in
August 2022 interrogatory answers that his last use of the drug was on July 30, 2022,
and he had no marijuana in his possession. In his August 2022 answer to the SOR, he
stated  he  would  stop  if  granted  a  security  clearance.  (Item  4  at  6-7,  10;  August  2022
answer to SOR)
SOR  ¶  1.b  - Applicant  was  in  the  ANG  in  September  2009.  Regulations
required drills of one weekend a month and two weeks a year. In September 2009,  his
supervisor  directed  him  to  undergo  a  random  drug  test  required  under  ANG  drug
screening policy.  Applicant  complied.  About  two  weeks  later,  his  captain  informed  him
that  he  would  receive  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions  because  he
tested  positive  for  marijuana.  He  knew  that  his  marijuana  use  could  result  in  his
discharge  from  the  ANG,  but  was  not  thinking  about  the  long-term  consequences  of
illegal  drug  use.  Applicant  has  never  been  subject  to  a  courts-martial  or  other
disciplinary action. (Item 4 at 4-5)
SOR  ¶  1.c  - Applicant  stated  that  he  began  using  Percocet,  Vicodin,  and
OxyContin  in  May  2008  to  “escape  from  life’s  problems  and  to  self-medicate  himself.”
(Item  4  at  5)  He  purchased  the  prescription  medications  from  drug  sellers  or
acquaintances that he could not recall and in amounts that he could not remember. He
used the drugs  alone at home or with one or two friends that he could not  remember.
Occasionally  he  would  not  use  the  drugs  for periods  of  up  to  one year.  The  Applicant
had  no  adverse  reaction  to  the drugs,  but  his  addictive  use  was  a  pivotal factor in  his
divorce, loss of friends, and significant loss of money due to his addiction. He used the
medications until September 2017, when he voluntarily sought treatment. (Item 4 at 5)
After  a  couple  of  unsuccessful  attempts,  Applicant  discovered  an  effective
treatment regimen with a substance abuse counselor in September 2017.  (SOR ¶ 1.c)
The  treatment  consisted  of  group  counseling  one  to  three  times  a  week  in  hour-long
sessions. The counselor persuaded Applicant to become more conscientious about his
treatment. He has taken no opiates since September 2017, when he began taking Sub
Oxone  daily  prescribed  by  the  doctor  who  was  collaborating  with  the  counselor  at  the
time.  Sub  Oxone  is  a  prescription  drug  that  decreases  the  user’s  dependence  on
opiates.  Applicant  stopped  his  treatment  with  the  substance  abuse  counselor  but
continued  his  Sub  Oxone  prescription  and  opiate  addiction  treatment  with  another
doctor  who  could  prescribe  Sub  Oxone  to  him  which  the  substance  abuse  counselor
could not. Since 2017, Applicant has received treatment from the doctor once a month,
then once every six weeks. He claims that he has never been diagnosed by a medical
professional with opiate dependence or addiction. Rather, he has always self-diagnosed
his  addiction.  Given  the  treatment  and  medication  he  has  received  since  September
2017,  it  seems  to  me  that  regardless  of  his  self-diagnosis,  his  treating  doctor  has
essentially confirmed his opiate dependence. In January 2022, he believed his addiction
was under control and he has continued to receive treatment.  He is determined not to
use opiates in the future. (Item 4 at 5-6)
",False
"Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  between
September  1986  and  December  2021  (SOR  1.a);  and  that  Applicant  intends  to  use
marijuana in the future. (SOR 1.b) In response to the SOR, she admitted SOR 1.a and
denied,  with  explanation,  SOR  1.b.  (FORM,  Items  1  and  2)  In  addition  to  the  facts
established  by  Applicant’s  admission  to  SOR  1.a,  and  based  on  my  review  of  the
information presented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor,  for  whom  she  has
worked  since  August  2019  as  company  vice  president.  This  appears  to  be  her  first
application for a security clearance. Her employer wants her to fill a position other than
the one she now holds. The new position requires she be eligible for access to classified
information. (FORM, Items 2 – 4)
Applicant has been  married  since  1992, the  same  year she  graduated  from  college
with  a  bachelor’s degree. She  started  using  marijuana  in 1986, when  she  was 18  years
old.   She   has  used   marijuana   with   varying   frequency   through   at  least  December 2021.
The  state  where she  lives and  works legalized  the  use  of marijuana  for medical purposes
in 2018.  In February 2020,  a  doctor prescribed  for her  a license to buy marijuana to treat
her insomnia.  Since  then, she  smokes “a small  bowl”  of  marijuana  two  or three  times a
week in the  privacy  of  her own  home. Before receiving  her medical marijuana  prescription,
Applicant bought marijuana illegally from  a variety of sources. (FORM, Item 4)
In response to questions in Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of her
e-QIP, Applicant disclosed her drug use and stated she would continue to use marijuana
for  medical  purposes  as  allowed  by  law  in  her  state.  On  January  24,  2022,  during  a
personal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator, she stated she does not
plan,  and  has  not  tried,  to  stop  using  marijuana.  She  further  stated  she  knows  using
marijuana is still a violation of federal law. Additionally, she stated that if her drug use is
an impediment to being approved for a security clearance, she would ask her employer
to find someone else to fill the position that requires a clearance rather than stop using
marijuana. However, Applicant also allowed that if her employer insisted that she fill the
new position, she would give up her marijuana use, but such would not be her first choice.
Her response to SOR 1.b is consistent with her statements on this issue during her PSI.
(FORM, Items 2 – 4)
Sua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I
controlled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal
law.  Guidance  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  (OASD)  in
February 2013 and by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in December 2021 make
clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states, territories,
and  the  District  of  Columbia  do  not  alter  the  current  National  Security  Adjudicative
Guidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this issue, Applicant’s use of
marijuana,  regardless  of  location  or  medical  justification  in  her  state  of  residence,  is
illegal. Further, federal workplaces prohibit illegal drug use by civilian federal employees
and by persons employed for work on federal contracts.

"Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the defense  contractor since 2019.  Applicant  has  never  held  a  security
clearance.  He is  not married, and has  no children.  (TR at page 6 at line 21 to page 7

1.a.   and   4.a   From  about  June  of  2018  to  about  July  of  2018,  Applicant  was
hospitalized for Depression with suicidal ideation. He was diagnosed as suffering from a
Major  Depressive  Disorder
–  MDMA,
Methamphetamines,  Amphetamines,  and  Possibly  Alcohol.  (TR  at  page  33  line  18  to

He  was  diagnosed  as  suffering  from  an  Unspecified  Bipolar  and  Related  Disorder,
Unspecified  Schizophrenia  Spectrum  and  Other  Psychotic  Disorder,  Unspecified
Alcohol  Related  Disorder,  and  Stimulant  Use  Disorder,  moderate,  amphetamine  type
substance,  in  sustained  remission.  The  psychologist  further  found  that  Applicant’s
mental health  diagnoses may be  a  significant risk to  Applicant’s judgment, reliability or
trustworthiness  concerning  classified  information.  (TR  at  page  24  line  24  to  page  33

Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
4.a. has been discussed, above.
4.b.  In  about  November  of  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  with  and  convicted  of
Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  alcohol  or  drugs.  He  was  placed  on  probation  for  ten
years. (GX 6.)

"Applicant is a 27-year-old associate counsel with a defense contractor. He is single
and has a fiancée. He has a juris doctor degree, and is seeking to obtain national security
eligibility in connection with his work with DoD. This is Applicant’s first application for a
security clearance in connection with his first job out of law school. (Item 3 at Sections
12, 13A, 17, and 25.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  the  single  allegation  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
1.a.  Applicant  admitted   using   marijuana   from   about  September  2012   through
August 2020. He  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequencies during  that  time, at one  point
using  marijuana  two  times a  week (2012-2016). From  2016  to  2018  he  used  marijuana
once   a   month.   He  then   used   marijuana   three   times  in  January   2019   and   five   times  in
August of  2020. Starting  in 2016,  he  only  used  marijuana  in states  where its purchase
and  use  was legal  under state  law. He has not used  marijuana  or any  other illegal drug
since August 2020. (Item 3  at Section  23  and  Item  4.)
Applicant  submitted   a   signed   statement  of  intent   dated   January   26,  2022.  He
stated,  “I   have   no   future  intent  to   use   any   illegal  controlled   substance   or  abuse
prescription   drugs,  regardless  of   whether  I   am   an   applicant  for  or  hold  a   security
clearance.”  He  also  agreed   to   random   drug   testing   and   immediate   revocation   of   his
security clearance if  he has a positive drug test. (Applicant Exhibit F.)
Applicant also agreed to the granting of a conditional clearance. His supervisor,
the general counsel of the defense contractor, agreed in writing to monitor Applicant for
one year and authorize quarterly, random drug tests. (Applicant Exhibit G.)
Mitigation
Applicant submitted a letter from his supervisor, who is the general counsel of the
defense contractor. She has worked daily with Applicant for five years, since he began as
an  intern.  She  stated,  “I  have  personally  found  [Applicant]  to  be  honest,  trustworthy,
reliable, dedicated  and loyal.”  The rest of the letter is also laudatory. She recommends
Applicant for a  position  of  trust,  which is shown  by  the  company’s decision  to  propose
Applicant as the Facility Security Officer. (Applicant Exhibit D at 1-2.)
Applicant submitted his annual appraisal covering his first full year working for the
defense  contractor.  His  supervisor  stated,  “[Applicant’s]  performance  in  2020  was
excellent.” (Applicant Exhibit C at 5-10.)
Applicant submitted letters from a long-time friend and from his fiancée. They each
discuss  Applicant’s  stated  and  unequivocal  intention  not  to  use  marijuana.  (Applicant
Exhibit D at 3-4.)

"[Note – The limited background information regarding Applicant was derived from
the FORM and was the most current information available.]
Applicant is a 62-year-old delivery driver employed by a defense contractor since
September  2018.  His  continued  employment  is  contingent  on  him  obtaining  a  security
clearance. He previously held a Secret security clearance when he was on active duty
in the U.S. Navy, discussed below.
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  1979.  He  was  awarded  an
associate’s  degree  in  November  1996.  He  has  been  married  three  times,  the  first
marriage  was  from  1982  to  1995,  and  the  second  marriage  was  from  1995  to  2001.
Both of those marriages ended by divorce. He married a third time in 2004. He has one
adult  biological  child  and  five  adult  stepchildren.  He  served  in  the  Navy  from  1986  to
1996, and was honorably discharged.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant disclosed his past drug use on his November 8, 2018. SF-86 (Item 3)
He said that he used marijuana between about May 1976 to about October 2018.  (SOR
¶  1.a)  He  admitted  the  SOR  allegation  in  his  answer  but  offered  no  additional  details.
(Items  1,  2,  3)  In  his  SF-86,  Applicant  stated  that  he  used  marijuana  for  anxiety  and
insomnia. The “norm” for him was to use marijuana at the end of the day as a sleep aid.
His  doctor  offered  him  “pills”  for  his  anxiety  and  insomnia,  but  Applicant  declined  that
option because he did not like pills, especially if they were addictive. He stopped using
marijuana when he was offered his current job. (Item 3)
During his January 22, 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview,
Applicant reiterated what he stated when completing his SF-86. However, he added that
since  he  stopped  using  marijuana  in  October  2018,  he  has  no  issue  with  anxiety  or
insomnia and has no plans to use marijuana in the future. Getting this job was a second
chance for him to get his life in order. He purchased his marijuana in small amounts for
$20  through  acquaintances,  whose  “names  are  unknown.”  He  did  not  have  a  medical
marijuana card. Applicant smoked marijuana with his wife in the evenings. He claimed
that  he  does  not  associate  with  anyone  who  uses  marijuana.  Applicant  has  not
undergone a drug assessment for drug dependency, nor has he participated in any drug
treatment  program  or  counseling.  Only  his  wife  and  security  officials  know  of  his
marijuana  use,  and  he  told  the  OPM  interviewer  that  his  use  cannot  be  used  for
blackmail or coercion. (Item 6)
Financial Considerations
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  his  mortgage  company  for  an
account that went into foreclosure, with a deficiency balance of $60,151. He denied this
allegation  in  his  SOR  answer,  stating  “no  attempt  to  collect.”  He  did  not  provide  any
further details regarding any efforts he made to resolve this situation. (Items 1, 2)
This  delinquent  SOR  debt  is  established  by  an  April  22,  2019  circuit  court  final
judgment  in  favor  of  Applicant’s  mortgage  company,  and  by  his  November  8,  2019
credit report, which reports that this account went into foreclosure in 2015. (Items 4, 5)
During  Applicant’s  January  22,  2019  OPM  interview,  he  stated  that  his  property
manager  remodeled  a  rental  house  belonging  to  Applicant  without  his  authorization,
which caused “financial difficulties” for him. Additionally, his tenant was not able  to pay
her  rent.  Applicant  estimated  this  situation  began  in  2014.  Applicant  was  late  on  his
mortgage because of these issues related to his rental house. (Item 6)
Applicant also stated during that same OPM interview that his financial problems
were  tied  to  events  beyond  his  control  because  he  was  unemployed  and  had  health
issues  which  prevented  him from making timely payments to his creditors. He has not
sought financial counseling or debt consolidation services. He stated that he lives within
his means and no one can question his ability or willingness to pay his debts. (Item 6) A
review  of  Applicant’s November 8,  2018  SF-86  reflects periods  of unemployment from
September 2017 to February 2018; and August 2016 to November 2016. (Item 3)
As  noted  above,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  2.a  in  his  answer,  asserting  that  the
creditor had not attempted to collect the deficiency balance. He provided no evidence of
his own efforts or intentions to resolve the debt. SOR ¶ 2.a is not resolved.

In the January 4, 2016 SCA, the second page of the form states its purpose as
follows:
Purpose of this Form
“The  United  States  Government  conducts  background  investigations  .  .  .  to
establish  that  applicants  either  employed  by  the  Government  or  working  for  the
Government  under  contract  are  suitable  for  the  job  and/or  eligible  for  a  public  trust  or

Each SCA in the record had identical language at the beginning of the form. (Items
3 and 5.) The AQPTP stated that it is a “supplement” to the SCA. (Item 4.)
Each SCA and the AQPTP had the following language:

18,  United   States  Code).”   (Items   2   through   5.)    Applicant   digitally   signed
each certification. (Items 2  through 5.)
In   Applicant’s  most  recent  SCA  (June   24,  2021),   she   disclosed   that  she   used
marijuana   between   October  2007   and   May   2021.  She   characterized   her  use   as
“infrequent,”  about  20   times.  She   also  described   how   marijuana   affected   her:  “Not  a
pleasant feeling, do not enjoy.” (Item 5.)
In Applicant’s March 31, 2022 Responses to Interrogatories, she stated that she
used marijuana  between October 2007 and May 2021 “once  every few years” and that
she had “no intention to use drugs in the future.” In her Personal Subject Interview (PSI),
she explained that she used marijuana with friends for “experimental” purposes, and no
longer associates with those individuals. (Item 6.)
Applicant’s Response to the FORM makes the following relevant points:
Guideline H
   Her sole use  of marijuana  after  being  granted  a  public trust position  was in May
2021, when she  unintentionally ingested a  fruit snack containing  THC.
   Aside  from  the  incident  in May  2021, most of  her marijuana  use  was prior to  2012.
Guideline E
   The   January   2016   SCA,  October   2018   SCA,  and   November   2018   AQPTP
questions about marijuana  usage  only  looked  back one  year. She  had  not used
marijuana in  the one-year periods  before those questions were posed to her.
   She  “misunderstood  the  [November 2, 2018  AQPTP] question  to  be  exclusive  of
marijuana  use,  given  its legalization  at the  state  level at the  time  [she] completed
the  form.”
The November 2, 2018 AQPTP question about marijuana usage looks back seven
years, not one year. (Item 4.)
Law and Policies
It   is  well   established   that  no   one   has  a   right  to   a   security   clearance.  As  the
that   security
Supreme   Court  held,  “the   clearly   consistent  standard
determinations should err, if  they  must,  on  the  side  of  denials.” Department of the  Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When   evaluating   an   applicant’s  suitability
for  a   security   clearance,  an
administrative   judge   must  consider  the   adjudicative   guidelines.  These   guidelines  are
flexible  rules of  law  that apply  together with  common  sense  and  the  general factors of  the
whole-person  concept.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider all  available and  reliable
information  about the  person,  past and  present,  favorable  and  unfavorable,  in  making  a
decision.   The   protection   of   the   national  security   is  the   paramount   consideration.  AG  ¶
¶2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny   doubt  concerning   personnel  being   considered   for  national
security eligibility  will be resolved in  favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive   ¶   E3.1.14,   the   Government   must  present  evidence   to   establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by  applicant or proven  by  Department Counsel. . . .”  The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion in seeking  a  favorable security decision.
Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
Under  AG  H,  illegal  drug  use  may  raise  questions  about  a  person’s  ability  or
willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG ¶ 24 sets forth the concern,
as follows:
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription
and  non-prescription  drugs,  and  the  use  of  other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their
intended  purpose  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual's  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior  may  lead  to  physical  or
psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises  questions  about  a  person's
ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  Controlled
substance means any ""controlled substance"" as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 802.
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions or factors:
AG ¶ 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and
AG  ¶  25(f)  any  illegal  drug  use  while  granted  access  to  classification  or
holding a sensitive position.
The potentially applicable mitigating factors here are quoted below:
AG  ¶  26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment; and
AG ¶ 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and
substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this
problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not
limited to:
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and
(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is
grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.
Applicant  admitted  that  she  used  marijuana with  varying  frequency from  October
2007 to May 2021, and after being granted public trust eligibility in June 2017 and January
2020. Facts admitted by an applicant in an SCA, an Answer to a SOR, or in an interview
require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd.
Dec.  4,  1995)  (“any  admissions  [applicant]  made  to  the  SOR  allegations  .  .  .  relieve
Department Counsel of its burden of proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App.
Bd.  Mar.  30,  1995)  (“[a]n  applicant’s  admissions,  whether  testimonial  or  written,  can
provide a legal basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”).
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated
by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. § 811 et seq.
The knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and
punishable  by  imprisonment,  a  fine  or  both. 21  U.S.C.  §  844.  In  an  October  25,  2014
memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is
a security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of  National Intelligence, Memorandum:
Adherence  to  Federal  Laws  Prohibiting  Marijuana  Use  (October  25,  2014).  See  also
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml
More recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed
the memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana
for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal
law  remains  unchanged  with  respect  to  the  illegal  use,  possession,  production  and
distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited  by  law  from  using  controlled  substances.  Disregard  of  federal  law
pertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal or recreational marijuana use) remains
relevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use
the “whole-person concept” stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant’s
behavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
Because  Applicant used marijuana for an extended period of time, including  while
holding a public trust position, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 25(a) and (f) apply. The next
inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply.
I  considered  mitigating  condition  AG  ¶  26(a).  Applicant  began  using  marijuana  in
2007, almost 15 years ago. Therefore, her initial use was long ago. She did, however,
continue that use with varying frequency through May 2021. Her drug use is not mitigated
by AG ¶ 26(a).
I  considered  mitigating condition  AG  ¶  26(b).  That  condition  has  two  components.
First,  the  individual  must  acknowledge  her  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse.
Second, the individual must establish a “pattern of abstinence.” The condition then lists
several nonexclusive examples of how a pattern could be shown.
Applicant  acknowledged  her  marijuana  use  for  the  first  time  in  her  June  24,  2021
SCA. There is no temporal component to  when that acknowledgement must be made.
That  is,  the  timing  of  the  acknowledgement  is  not  prescribed,  but  its  timing  may  be
considered  in  weighing  the  overall  evidence.  Here,  Applicant  did  acknowledge  her
marijuana use, albeit quite belatedly.
The second component requires an applicant to show a pattern of abstinence. Here,
Applicant said she no longer associates with the friends with whom she used marijuana
That is helpful to her cause.
Mitigating condition AG ¶ 26(b) also suggests that providing a signed statement in the
form described could aid in showing a commitment to abstinence. In her March 31, 2022
responses  to  interrogatories,  Applicant  said  she  had  “no  intention  to  use  drugs  in  the
future.” Her statement of future intent, however, is not controlling. The core of AG ¶ 26(b)
is whether Applicant has established a pattern of abstinence. Her drug use from October
2007 to 2021, even if infrequent, was a lengthy period. On balance, her abstinence from
2021  to  the  present  is  not  a  sufficient  period  of  abstinence  to  establish  a  pattern  that
satisfies AG ¶ 26(b). Her drug use is not mitigated by AG ¶ 26(b).
I find against Applicant on SOR ¶ 1.
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
In  assessing  an  allegation  of  deliberate  falsification,  I  consider  not  only  the
allegation  and  applicant’s  answer  but  also  all  relevant  circumstances. AG  ¶¶  2(a)  and
(d)(1)-(9)  (explaining  the  “whole-person”  concept  and  factors).  Under  Guideline  E  for
personal conduct, the concern is that “[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of
candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified
or sensitive information.” A statement or an omission is false or dishonest when it is made
deliberately (knowingly and willfully).
The SOR alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose her previous
marijuana use. More specifically, the SOR alleged that she omitted marijuana use from
her  January  4,  2016  SCA,  October  29,  2018  SCA,  and  November  2,  2018  AQPTP.
Applicant denied those allegations. This alleged conduct falls squarely within AG ¶ 16(a),
which states in pertinent part:
[D]eliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant  facts  from
any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations.
AG ¶ 17(a) states in pertinent part a condition that may mitigate that disqualifying
condition:
[The]  individual  made  prompt,  good-faith  efforts  to  correct  the  omission,
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.
Applicant  offers  two  explanations.  First,  she  claims  that  each  of  those  three
questionnaires look back only one year for prior drug use. She then states that she did
not  use  marijuana  during  those  respective  one-year  periods.  The  November  2,  2018
AQPTP, however, does not look back only one  year; it looks back seven  years, which
captures drug use in 2011. She stated that “most of the marijuana use was prior to 2012.”
Applicant’s first explanation has another problem. She would have us believe that
she can answer the following questions in the affirmative:
(1)  she remembers precisely that she did not use marijuana during the one year
preceding her January 4, 2016 SCA?
(2)  she remembers precisely that she did not use marijuana during the one year
preceding her October 29, 2018 SCA?
(3)  she remembers precisely that she did not use marijuana during the one year
preceding her November 2, 2018  AQPTP?  (Even though that questionnaire
looks back seven years.)
Applicant’s pot-smoking sessions were not formal gatherings. She was with others
at a friend’s house. It is not credible that she could honestly answer those three questions
in the affirmative. Moreover, she began her use of marijuana in 2007 for “experimental”
purposes. Yet she continued using for years, even though it was “not a pleasant feeling,”
and she did “not enjoy” it. Applicant’ first explanation is not credible.
Moreover,  Applicant’s  “No”  response  to  the  AQPTP  question  is  striking.  The
AQPTP asked about her marijuana use going back seven years, that is, from November
2018 back to November 2011. That seven-year period must have included at least one
of the 20 times that she used marijuana between October 2007 and May 2021. She was
trying  to  minimize  the  extent  of  her  drug  usage.  An  honest  “Yes”  answer  would  have
defeated that purpose.
Applicant has a second explanation. Her omission of marijuana use was simply
based  on  a  misunderstanding.  She  “misunderstood  the  [November  2,  2018  AQPTP]
question to be exclusive of marijuana use, given its legalization at the state level at the
time [she] completed the form.” The context, however, suggests otherwise.
Each SCA states at page two its purpose:
“The  United  States Government conducts background  investigations . . . to  establish  that
applicants  either  employed   by   the   Government  or  working   for  the   Government  under
contract are suitable  for the job and/or eligible for a  public trust or sensitive position.”
The AQPTP stated that it was a “supplement” to the SCAs. Since Applicant digitally
signed  each  form,  surely  she  knew  that  the  forms  were  to  be  used  by  the  U.S.
Government, not state governments.
There is more context that undermines Applicant’s “misunderstanding.” Each  form
has the  following Certification:
My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete,
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good
faith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form
can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both (See section 1001 of title
18, United States Code).
Applicant  digitally  signed  each  Certification.  That  Certification  on  its  face  is
governed by federal, not state law. There is not even a hint in any of the documents of
record that state law applies to the federal trustworthiness process. Applicant was granted
public trust eligibility in June 2017 and January 2020. She is well aware that the federal
Government holds illegal drug use to be important in the public trust eligibility process.
Given Applicant’s education, background, and experience, her “misunderstanding” is not
credible.
Finally, there is AG ¶ 17(a) that states in pertinent part a condition that may mitigate
the disqualifying conditions that apply here:
[The]  individual  made  prompt,  good-faith  efforts  to  correct  the  omission,
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.
Applicant’s first material omission was in her January 4, 2016 SCA. She made no
prompt efforts to correct that omission. Her second material omission was in her October
29, 2018 SCA. She made no prompt efforts to correct that omission. Her third material
omission was in her November 2, 2018 AQPTP. She made no prompt efforts to correct
that omission. In fact, she never made any efforts, let alone prompt ones, to correct her
three material omissions. This history shows a pattern of deliberate omissions. She finally
answered truthfully when she was confronted by her June 24, 2021 SCA.  AG  ¶ 17(a)
does not apply.
I find that Applicant made deliberately false omissions, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.
The Whole-Person Concept
The  record raises doubts about  Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment,
and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  whether  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not
met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph 1, Guideline H:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a. - 1.b:
Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 2.a – 2.d:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In  light of  the  record as  a  whole,  it is not clearly  consistent with  the  national interest
to grant Applicant access to classified information. Applicant’s eligibility is denied.
Philip J. Katauskas
Administrative Judge
",False
"Applicant is 37 years old, married and has one young child. He and his wife are
expecting a second child. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2008 and a master’s degree
in  2015.  He  has  worked  for  a  major  DoD  contractor  for  the  last  14  years.  Applicant’s
employer has promoted  him five  times, and he  is presently a manager.  He  received a
security clearance in 2009 and is seeking to renew his eligibility in connection with his
employment. (Tr. at 15-23; GE 1 at 12-20; AE A at 1-2.)
Guideline H, Drug Involvement  and Substance Involvement
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  a  history  of  drug  involvement.  Specifically,  the  SOR  alleged  that
Applicant used marijuana with “varying frequency” from about September 2015 to at least
September 2017. The SOR also alleged that Applicant used marijuana after he had been
granted  access  to  classified  information  (SOR  1.a).  The  SOR  further  alleged  that
Applicant intended to continue using marijuana in the future (SOR 1.b). In his Answer,
Applicant denied SOR 1.a “due to the term ‘varying frequency,’ which is ambiguous.” He
commented further  that he  “will explain  more  at  the  hearing.”  He also denied SOR 1.b
without comments.
In his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana occasionally during the
period September 2015 to September 2017. At the hearing, he testified that those dates
were incorrect. He said that his first use was in or about September 2017 and his last use
was sometime in the first half of 2018. The basis of this adjusted timeline is the fact that
he only purchased medical marijuana, actually “edibles” containing THC (Edibles), in his
state of residence from medical marijuana dispensaries using a process that requires a
doctor’s  medical  marijuana  “recommendation.”  His  purchases  and  uses  of  medical
marijuana,  including  Edibles,  pursuant  to  this  process  are  legal  in  the  state  in  which
Applicant resides. He first received a recommendation letter from a doctor in his state on
September 20,  2017.  He  had  never  used marijuana  in  any form  prior  to  obtaining  this
recommendation. He also testified that he stopped using Edibles prior to submitting his
e-QIP in July 2018. He estimated that he used Edibles less than 15 times during a period
of about nine months. Applicant acknowledged that he held a security clearance at the
time he used Edibles. (Tr. at 24-28, 48-50.)
Applicant  sought  a  recommendation  from  a  doctor  to  use  medical  marijuana
because he believed it would help reduce his “debilitating” symptoms of Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD)  and  anxiety.  Applicant’s  psychiatrist  has  given  him  a
diagnosis  of  ADHD  and  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder.  For  a  year  or  two  Applicant
followed the advice of his psychiatrist and followed his treatment plan for Applicant, which
included  taking  medication  for  his  ADHD  condition.  Over  that  period,  the  psychiatrist
adjusted Applicant’s medication a number of times in an attempt to reduce his symptoms
as much as possible with the medication. The medication never provided sufficient relief,
and  it  had  significant  side  effects  that  bothered  Applicant.  Prior  to  September  2017,
Applicant was also under the care of a therapist. (Tr. at 27-33, 48-50.)
Applicant asserted that his condition interfered with both his professional life and
his marriage. While searching for a better cure of his condition, he read about medical
studies  that  showed  that  marijuana  could  provide  relief  for  individuals  with  ADHD  or
anxiety. He decided to seek the advice of a physician about the possibility of treating his
condition  with  marijuana.  The  physician  gave  him  the  recommendation  letter  that  was
required  for  Applicant  to  purchase  marijuana  at  a  state-licensed  dispensary  where  his
purchases would be legal under state law. He used the marijuana in the form of Edibles
and found that the drug relieved his symptoms “to a degree.” It was more effective than
the  medication  prescribed  by  his  psychiatrist,  but  it  did  not  resolve  his  symptoms
completely. It had the benefit of eliminating the side effects of the prescribed drug. (Tr. at
31-35.)
Applicant  then   switched   to   a  new   therapist   who   treated   patients   with   Cognitive
Behavior Therapy  (CBT). Using  the  CBT techniques,  Applicant  learned  from  his therapist
that  he  could stop  the  cycle of  his symptoms  seriously  interfering  with  all  aspects of  his
life. He  decided  to  continue  with  CBT  therapy, and  he  stopped  using  Edibles.  Since  he
began   with   CBT  therapy   in  2018   after  he   prepared   his  e-QIP,   he   has  not  had   an
experience  of  having  his symptoms of  ADHD or anxiety  becoming  “out  of control.”  As  a
result,  he   does  not  intend   to   use   marijuana   in  the   future   and   has   signed   a   statement
confirming  that commitment.  At the  hearing, he  retracted  his statement in his July  2018
e-QIP  that he  may  need  to  rely  on  marijuana  in  the  future. He  believes that  his  use  of
CBT  techniques is a  much  more  effective  coping  mechanism  than  prescription  drugs or
marijuana.  It  is  also  important to  him  that  CBT techniques have  no  side  effects.  (Tr. at 33-
36; AE E.)
Applicant also is planning to avoid marijuana in the future for two other significant
reasons. One is that he became a father and wanted to become a proper role model for
his  child. He wants his  home  to  be  drug-free.  The  other reason  is that he  is aware that
under Federal law  his use  of Edibles is  illegal. At  the  time  he  used  Edibles,  he  was aware
that their  use  was inconsistent  with  the  responsibilities of  a  security  clearance  holder. He
used   Edibles   only   because   he   was  afraid  that  his  worsening   condition,  particularly   his
anxiety  disorder,  would seriously  damage  his marriage  and  his career if  he  did  not get his
mental health  condition  under control. He  was hoping  that  marijuana  would give  him  the
relief he  needed.  He understands  that  he  exercised  poor  judgment.  He  testified  that  his
judgment was “probably  clouded  by  the  feeling  that I  needed  to  do  something  quickly.”
He acknowledged that he “failed to consider the consequences of [his] actions while [he]
was desperate to regain control of his mental health.” He is committed now to complying
with  his legal responsibilities.  If he ever felt  desperate again,  he  would take  time off from
work and  consult with  his new  psychiatrist and  therapist. Moreover, he  stated  that he  has
faith in his current psychiatric care team. (Tr. at 36-41.)
Mitigation  and Whole-Person Evidence
As noted, Applicant has had a highly successful career working for his employer
since graduate school. He has advanced in the company more quickly than most of his
peers. He has been selected for several special advancement programs and has received
certifications following his completion of specialized courses. (Tr. at 17-18; AE A at 2; AE
D at 1-15.)
Applicant  submitted  eight  reference  letters  from  a  supervisor,  co-workers  and
family members. All of his references praise Applicant’s intelligence, skills, and dedication
to  his  employer  and  the  United  States.  They  attest  to  his  integrity,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness. He also submitted several performance reviews in which he was highly
rated and praised for his excellent leadership skills, work ethic, and accomplishments. In
one review, he is described as one of the company’s “superstars.” (AE B; AE E.)
",True
"In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions to allegations under
both Guidelines H and E, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old.
In 2002, he earned a bachelor’s degree in political science. In 2013, he earned a master’s
of  business  administration  (MBA).  In  January  2012,  he  went  to  work  for  a  federal
contractor in an information technology (IT) position that required eligibility for a security
clearance.  He  worked  there  until  July  2016,  when  he  started  working  for  his  current
employer, also a federal contractor, in a position that also requires access to classified
information. (GX 1; Tr. 43 – 46)
Applicant has had access to classified information since 2012. He first applied for
a  security  clearance  by  submitting  an  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations
Processing  (e-QIP)  on  January  9,  2012  (e-QIP  #1;  admitted  as  GX  5).  Based  on  the
ensuing background investigation, he received a secret-level security clearance in early
2012. On December 12, 2012, he submitted another e-QIP (e-QIP #2; admitted as GX 3)
to obtain eligibility for access at the top-secret level, which he received in March 2013.
On  November  21, 2018,  he  submitted  another e-QIP  (e-QIP #3; admitted  as GX 1) to
initiate this current review of his eligibility for access. (GX 1; GX 3; GX 5)
Applicant was married from September 2011 until finalizing a divorce in May 2013.
He  and  his  ex-wife  separated  sometime  in  2012.  In  October  2012,  Applicant  obtained
what he termed a legal separation, and then proceeded through a contentious and bitter
divorce.  Applicant’s  ex-wife  reportedly  abused  alcohol  and  was  often  abusive  towards
him. The divorce caused Applicant to endure significant personal, physical, financial, and
psychological stress. Since 2017, he has been in a committed relationship with a woman
to whom he now is engaged, and with whom he has two children. (Answer 1; GX 1; Tr.
48, 53 – 55)
Applicant first used marijuana at age 17 in 2001 while on a student trip abroad. He
next used in 2004, while in college, and  between  2007 and 2010 with friends in social
settings. Available information shows he did not use marijuana again until October 2012.
At  that  time,  he  began  using  marijuana  as  a  means  to  cope  with  the  stressors  of  his
separation  and  pending  divorce.  He  was  having  trouble  sleeping  because  of  related
anxiety, and his doctor prescribed him different medications to address his condition. He
avers  that  the  medications  either  were  ineffective  or  had  significant  side  effects  that
impeded  his  ability  to  function  at  home  and  at  work.  He  chose  to  use  marijuana  as  a
replacement for the prescribed medications and for about the next two years, he used
frequently  each  week.  Applicant  obtained  marijuana  from  a  friend  with  whom  he  had
worked  in  2009  and  2010,  receiving  small  amounts  of  marijuana  from  that  friend  in
exchange for doing chores and odd jobs for him. Applicant often used marijuana with that
friend. This arrangement and Applicant’s frequency of use lasted until about May 2014, a
year after his divorce, when the friend moved away. At all times during this period of drug
use, Applicant had access to classified information. In e-QIP #2, submitted in December
2012,  despite  the  fact  that  he  had  been  using  marijuana frequently  each  week for the
preceding two months,  he stated he  had  last  used marijuana  in  2007 and that he had
used  it  a  total  of  about  five  times.  At  hearing,  he  conceded  he  intentionally  omitted
information about his drug use from e-QIP #2. (Answer 1; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 48 – 60, 69, 75

When Applicant submitted e-QIP #1 in January 2012, he did not disclose that he
had used marijuana during the preceding seven years; however, when he submitted e-
QIP #2 in December 2012, he disclosed that he had used marijuana “socially a few times
in college and grad school” between 2004 and 2007. Also in that application, he denied
any future intent to use marijuana, stating “I do not have any need or use for it and will
not jeopardize my way of life.” In e-QIP #2, he did not mention that, two months earlier,
he had begun using marijuana more frequently to cope with the breakup of his marriage.
(GX 3 and 5)
In June 2018, Applicant and his fiancée were travelling with friends in a state where
recreational use of marijuana is legal. They visited breweries and attended a concert, and
at  some  point  decided  to  try  edibles  containing  THC,  the  controlled  substance  in
marijuana. Applicant next used marijuana at a New Year’s Eve party in his home state,
where  marijuana  use  is  still  illegal  under  state  law.  He  was  intoxicated  and  smoked
marijuana when someone offered it to him while standing around a bonfire. (Answer 1;
GX 2; Tr. 59 – 60, 104 – 105)
Applicant submitted e-QIP #3 on November 21, 2018. In response to questions in
Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity), he disclosed that he used marijuana
between October 2012 and June 2018, and that he had used in social settings about five
times “since days of regular use,” by which he meant the period between October 2012
and  May  2014.  When  asked  if  his  drug  use  occurred  while  he  possessed  a  security
clearance, he answered “Yes.” When asked if he intended to use marijuana in the future,
he  answered  “No,”  and  stated  “The  stress  that  was  present  while  regularly  using
marijuana during my divorce are no longer present. I have developed proven routines and
activities that help alleviate stress and have a positive relationship for which the stress of
the past is no longer present.” In contrast to his reported five instances of marijuana use
after 2014, Applicant testified that he only used marijuana twice after 2014 – in June and
December 2018. On cross-examination, he referred to his e-QIP disclosure as “a general
statement.” (GX 1 at 31 – 32; Tr. 59 – 60, 76 – 77)
During the background investigation initiated by e-QIP #3, Applicant completed a
PSI  with  a  government  investigator  on  January  24,  2019.  During  that  interview,  he
reported he first used marijuana in October 2012 and last used marijuana in June 2018.
On  July  5,  2019,  a  government  investigator  conducted  two  follow-up  interviews  with
Applicant about his drug use. In the first July 5 interview, Applicant reported that he used
marijuana with the person from whom he obtained the marijuana an average of four nights
a week over an average of three weeks monthly. After his source of marijuana moved
away,  he  smoked  marijuana  in  social  settings  or  parties  if  someone  offered  it  to  him.
During the first July 5 interview, he also disclosed his use of marijuana on December 31,
2018.  He  stated  that  he  only  used  marijuana  that  night  because  he  was  intoxicated.
During the interview, he stated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because
he now has good sleep habits, he meditates, and he is in a good relationship with his
fiancée. (GX 2)
The  summary  report  of  the  July  5,  2019  PSI  does  not  indicate  that  Applicant
explained why he had not disclosed his December 2018 marijuana use when discussing
his drug use during a PSI less than a month after his last use. Applicant denied SOR 2.d,
which alleged that he intentionally made a false official statement to the government by
failing to disclose his most recent drug use during the January 2019 PSI. In response to
the  SOR  and  at  hearing,  he  stated  that  he  did  not  disclose  smoking  marijuana  at  the
December 2018 New Year’s Eve party because he was so intoxicated that night he did
not  remember  doing  so.  He  claimed  it  was  not  until  the  spring  of  2019,  as  he  was
discussing  his  drug  use  with  a  friend  whom  he  had  listed  as  a  reference  in  e-QIP  #3,
Section 16 (People You Know Well) that he recalled his December 2018 use. That friend
was the same person who hosted the New Year’s Eve party, and according to Applicant,
reminded him that he had used marijuana that evening. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 70 – 72)
Applicant’s  fiancée  testified  for  Applicant.  She  recounted  their  use  of  edibles  in
June  2018,  and  she  was  present  at  the  New  Year’s  Eve  party.  Although  she  did  not
witness  Applicant  using  marijuana,  she  testified  she  knew  he  had  used  it  at  the  party
because Applicant told her that evening that he had smoked marijuana. (Tr. 110 - 111)
In   response   to   the   Government’s  information,  Applicant  presented   19   letters  of
support, all  attesting  to  his good  character, reliability, and  trustworthiness. (AX  A) He also
presented  a  series  of  lab  reports that show  he  tested  negative  for controlled  substances
through  hair  and  urine  tests each  month  between  May  2021  and  August 2022  (AX  B) In
April 2021, he  completed  a  marijuana  education  class that  discusses the  chemistry  and
legalities  associated   with   marijuana.  (AX   C;  Tr.  98   –   99)  Also  presented   were  recent
performance  evaluations from  his employer that reflect excellent work between  2016  and
2020. (AX  D)  Applicant also has  completed  several IT  certifications.  (AX  F)  A  co-worker
who  has known  Applicant since  2017  testified  that he  is an  excellent worker who  is a  “go-
to   guy”  on   important  projects.   The   witness  also  reported   that  Applicant  is  largely   self-
taught  in most of  his IT skills, and  that he  is honest  and  trustworthy. The  witness is  aware
of  Applicant’s use  of  marijuana  to  cope  with  divorce-related  stress,  but acknowledged  that
his drug use  thereafter was a stupid mistake. (Tr. 29  –  43)
Applicant insists that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. To that end,
he presented a notarized statement of intent (AX E) in which he acknowledged that any
future drug use might be grounds for revocation of any clearance he holds. Applicant also
testified that he no longer associates with persons who use marijuana, and that he leads
a lifestyle that is conducive to continued abstinence. By contrast, the personal reference
who  he  claims  refreshed  his  recollection  about  his  December  2018  marijuana  use  is
someone with whom Applicant has smoked marijuana in the past, and who hosted the
New Year’s Eve party. Applicant’s fiancée characterized that party as a gathering of “very,
very close friends.” As of the July 2019 PSIs, Applicant was in contact with that person
about quarterly.  (GX 2; Tr. 91 – 93, 94 – 95, 105)

"Applicant  admitted  all of  the  SOR  allegations. He  is  44  years old, married, and  he
has two  minor children. He has owned  his home  since  2009. (Answer; Tr. at  18-20, 76-
79; GE 2-3)
Applicant graduated from high school in 1996. He attended a junior college in 2017
and then transferred to a four-year university, where he earned a bachelor’s degree  in
computer engineering in 2002. He earned a master’s degree in engineering management
in 2005. He worked for a DOD contractor from 2002 to 2007. He then worked for three
DOD contractors between 2007 and June 2018. Since then, he has worked as a computer
engineer  for  another  DOD  contractor.  He  was  first  granted  a  security  clearance  in
approximately August 2002. (Tr.  6-8, 19-23, 35-37, 40, 42; GE 1-3; AE G-H)
Under Guideline  H, the SOR alleged  that Applicant used  and  purchased  marijuana,
with  varying  frequency, from  approximately  1995  to  February  2015.  (SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.b)  It
also alleged  that  he  used  marijuana,  in  approximately  May  2003,  while  granted  access to
classified  information, and  in approximately  May  2013  and  February  2015,  while  holding
a   public  trust  position.   (SOR  ¶¶   1.c-1.d)  Under  Guideline   E,  the   SOR   alleged   that  he
falsified  his 2002  security  clearance  application  (SCA), by  failing  to  disclose  his prior drug
involvement.  (SOR  ¶  2.a) It  also  alleged  that he falsified  his  responses to  section  23  of
his July  2018  SCA,  by  failing  to  disclose  his use  and  purchase  of marijuana, and  by  failing
to  disclose  his 2003 marijuana  use  while  granted  access to  classified  information, as set
forth in  SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.b, and  1.c, respectively.  (SOR ¶¶  2.b-2.d)
Applicant  experimented   with   marijuana   in  high   school;  he  used   it approximately
four times with  friends.  He used  marijuana  10  times while  in junior college, with  friends  or
on  his own.  He  significantly  increased  his marijuana  use  to  almost  daily  upon  joining  a
fraternity  while attending  university.  He used marijuana  with friends at parties and  on his
own.  He   and   members  of   his  fraternity   also   purchased   marijuana   from   a   fraternity
member’s friend, then  sold the  marijuana to  their college  friends. Sheriff’s officers visited
him   while   in  college   and   confiscated   “between   a   half  and   three-quarters  of  a   bag”  of
marijuana  from  his dorm  room.  He cooperated  with  the  officers and  they  did  not arrest
him. He  left  the  fraternity, disassociated  himself from  his  fraternity  friends, and  stopped
selling   marijuana   in  1999.  He  also   stopped   using   illegal  drugs,  with   the   exception   of
marijuana.   He   continued   to   use   marijuana,   decreasing   his  usage   over  time   until   he
stopped  in  February  2002,  six  months before  his  graduation. (Answer; Tr. at  23-27, 38-
41, 45, 64-68; GE 3-4)
Applicant completed his first SCA in May 2002. Although the 2002 SCA is not in
evidence,  he  recalled  completing  it.  He  recalled  the  questions  contained  therein
pertaining  to  drug  involvement.  He  admitted  to  omitting  his  drug  history.  He  had  just
graduated  from  college.  He  was  24  years  old.  He  did  not  take  the  security  clearance
process seriously. His past drug use embarrassed him. He did not want to jeopardize his
ability to obtain a security clearance by disclosing his drug history. (Tr. at 28-29, 40-41,
64; GE 4)
Applicant used marijuana again in May 2003. He was celebrating with friends on
the eve of his wedding, and he smoked from a marijuana joint that his friends shared. He
knew that he held a security clearance. He attributed this drug use to immaturity. (Tr. at
27-28, 41, 53-55, 68-69; GE 2-4)
In  March  2007,  Applicant  completed  a  questionnaire  for  non-sensitive  positions
(SF85) to obtain eligibility for a public trust position. As of the date of the hearing, this was
the only SF85 that he completed. Section 14 of that SF85 inquired only whether Applicant
had used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs within the past year. Since
he  had  not  used  illegal  drugs  in  2006,  he  truthfully  answered  that  question.  No  one
informed him that he had access to sensitive information after he completed the SF85.
He did not believe he worked with sensitive information. He did not receive annual security
training.  He  was  unaware  that  he  still  had  such  access  in  2013  and  2015.  When  he
completed another SCA in June 2018, as further discussed below, he did so through the
same  website  he  used  to  complete  his  SF85.  When  he  saw  his  completed  SF85,  he
realized  that  he  was  likely  granted  access  to  sensitive  information  in  2007,  and  he
estimated that he had such access for a period of between 10 to 15 years. (Tr. at 27-28,
42-44, 55-59, 65; GE 1-2, 4)
Applicant  used   marijuana   again  in   May   2013   and   February   2015,   while   he   had
access to  sensitive  information. In  May  2013, he used  marijuana  on  the eve  of a friend’s
wedding,  shared   by   friends   of  the   wedding   party.   He   used   marijuana   last   in  February
2015,  while  on  vacation  in Jamaica with  his  spouse. He smoked  from  a  marijuana  joint
that  beach-goers  shared.  He  also   purchased   and   smoked   a   marijuana   joint,   and   he
purchased  and  ate  a  marijuana  brownie.  As  discussed  above, he  was unaware that he
had  access to  sensitive  information  in  2013  and  2015.  (Tr.  at  27-28, 44-45,  51, 55-59,  69-
71; GE 2-4)
Applicant completed another SCA in July 2018.  Section 23 of that SCA inquired
about his illegal drug use and illegal drug purchase within the last seven years, as well
as any illegal drug use or drug activity while holding a security clearance. He knowingly
falsified his responses when he marked “No” and failed to disclose his relevant use and
purchase  of  marijuana,  as  well  as  his  2003  use  of  marijuana  while  holding  a  security
clearance. He anguished over it for several weeks. He discussed it with his spouse. He
sought  advice  from  an  attorney,  who  encouraged  him  to  correct  his  falsifications.  He
decided that he did not want to repeat his falsifications every time he was re-investigated,
and he was motivated to live by the advice he gives to his children to “be a man of their
word and not lie.” (Tr. at 29-37, 45-51, 59-64, 73-85; GE 2, 4)
In August 2018, Applicant notified his corporate facility security officer (FSO) that
he omitted information on his 2018 SCA. As directed, he then notified his local FSO. He
also notified one of his managers, who testified on Applicant’s behalf as further discussed
below, and this manager scheduled a meeting with his other managers. At this meeting,
he informed his managers that he “omitted some information off of my [SCA] and so we
talked  it over.” He disclosed  information regarding his drug use and his drug use while
holding a security clearance. They chose to retract his 2018 SCA, with the understanding
that he would complete another SCA in which he would disclose his drug involvement.
An authorized DOD background investigator did not interview him in 2018. (Tr. at 29-37,
45-51, 66, 73-76; GE 2-4; AE I)
Applicant has no regrets about coming forward, stating:
So, I’m  falling  on  the  sword trying  to  correct the  record. I feel like  I  cleansed
my  soul. I can  look back at my  kids with  a  pure heart and  a  clean  conscience
knowing  that I did the  right thing. I obviously  messed  up, I don’t deny  that
and   I’m   fixing   the   record  to   my   personal  detriment  financially   and
professionally. But I  feel supported  by  my  colleagues, my  friends, and  my
neighbors.
(Tr. at 36)
Applicant completed a third SCA in March 2019. He disclosed all of his prior drug
involvement, as discussed above. He was candid about his drug involvement during his
subsequent  interview  by  a  background  investigator  in  June  2019.  He  has  no  future
intentions to use illegal drugs. He stated that he has matured and he no longer socializes
with individuals who use or sell drugs. If he were to find himself in an environment where
drugs are present, he stated that he would remove himself from the situation. His spouse
is aware of his past drug involvement. He wants to continue to be a role model for his
children, respected by his peers and managers, and an active member of his community.
(Tr. at 64, 71-72, 76-85; GE 3-4; AE F)
Applicant is subject to random drug testing by his employer. As of the date of the
hearing, his employer had not yet selected him to report for such a test. He stated that he
voluntarily submitted to several drug tests through his doctor, and that he tested negative
for illegal drugs. In 2019, he provided the background investigator with two urinalysis tests
administered in January 2018 and May 2018 reflecting that he tested negative for illegal
drugs. (Tr. at 51-53; GE 4)
All of Applicant’s witnesses were aware of the SOR allegations, and they vouched
for  Applicant’s  trustworthiness,  integrity,  reliability,  and  judgment.  One  witness,  a
department head for a U.S. Government agency who has held a security clearance since
2007, has known Applicant since 2019. He referred to Applicant as a respected subject-
matter  expert  and  his  “go-to  guy.”  Another  witness,  who  has  worked  for  the  same
company as Applicant for 27 years, and who has held a security clearance for 20 years,
testified  that  he  has  known  Applicant  since  2018.  The  witness  testified  that  Applicant
served  under  his  supervision  from  2018  to  2022,  and  the  witness  was  one  of  the
managers to whom Applicant disclosed that he had falsified his 2018 SCA. The witness
scheduled  the  meeting  in  August  2018  with  Applicant  and  his  other  managers.  The
witness described Applicant as an excellent employee. Another witness who testified and
provided a letter of support was a retired U.S. Government civilian. This witness never
held a security clearance. This witness met Applicant in 2007, when Applicant was hired
as a contractor for the agency in which the witness worked. When the witness served as
a  branch  chief  in  2012,  he  oversaw  Applicant’s  work  assignments  until  2018.  He
described  Applicant  as  an  outstanding  colleague  with  exemplary  work  ethic  and
performance. A neighbor, close friend, fellow youth sports coach, and a lieutenant colonel
in the U.S. Air Force Reserve who also provided a letter of support, described Applicant
as a conscientious individual, willing to admit and correct his mistakes. (Tr. at 76-165; GE
4; AE F, I)
Applicant  also  provided  letters  of  support  from  four  individuals  who  attested,  in
2018,  to  his  trustworthiness,  integrity,  reliability,  and  judgment.  One  individual,  who
served as the chief operating officer for a defense contractor and who hired Applicant in
2014, attested to Applicant’s exemplary performance. Another individual, an Information
Technology Branch Chief who has known Applicant since 2013, stated that he granted
Applicant  elevated  user  privileges  as  a  computer  engineer.  This  individual  stated  that
Applicant  never  once  abused  his  heightened  privileges,  and  this  individual  would  not
hesitate to provide Applicant with the same level of access in the future. Two neighbors,
one of whom was a fellow youth sports coach and the other, a family friend for more than
30 years, described Applicant as a conscientious individual, willing to admit and correct
his  mistakes.  Performance  evaluations  from  2018  to  2021  reflect  that  Applicant’s
employer rated him favorably, noting that he is a strong performer who has demonstrated
high levels of leadership. He is an active member of his community. (GE 4; AE A-F)

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer with the exception of
SOR ¶ 1.d, which he denied. He is 30 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was
single, he did not have any children, and he rented an apartment with a roommate since
approximately February 2021. (Answer; Tr. at 18-19, 38, 46; GE 1-2)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2011. He earned a bachelor’s degree in
psychology in May 2015. He attended classes towards a  master’s degree  from August
2016 to March 2017, but he had not yet earned that degree. He was unemployed after
college from May 2015 to September 2015, July 2016 to June 2017, February 2020 to
May  2020,  and  August  2020  to  February  2021.  He  completed  his  security  clearance
application  (SCA) in November 2020. As  of  the  date of  the  hearing,  he worked for his
employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  February  2021.  He  has  never  held  a  security
clearance. (Tr. at 5, 7-8, 18-19, 43, 46; GE 1-2)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana,  with  varying
frequency, from approximately September 2013 to at least May 2021, and that he had not
committed to discontinue his marijuana use clearly and convincingly. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) It
also  alleged  that  he  used  and  purchased  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  twice  from
approximately April 2018 to June 2020, and that he used ecstasy in approximately April
2018. (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.e)
Applicant  first  used  marijuana  in  September  2013.  He  was  20  years  old  and  in
college. He spent about $40 every two to three weeks to purchase marijuana from college
friends,  and  he  used  it  with  those  friends  approximately  weekly.  He  stopped  using
marijuana as he approached his graduation date, because he knew he would be returning
to live with his parents and they would not permit marijuana use in their home. He used
marijuana during two periods when he did not live with his parents, from August 2016 to
March 2017 and January 2018 until August 2020. (Tr. at 21-31, 35-39, 49-50, 61-62; GE

Sometime  in 2019, Applicant obtained  a  medical marijuana  card.  He obtained  a
medical  marijuana   card  after  he   read   that   marijuana   could   help  treat  the   neurological
disorder he has had  since  birth, and for which  he  was officially  diagnosed  at around age
11.  He sought  to  supplement  with  marijuana  the  medication  his doctor prescribed  him  for
his  disorder.   He  consulted   with   his  neurologist,  and   the   neurologist  advised   him   that
marijuana  could  not hurt to  try. He also enjoyed  using  marijuana  recreationally. He spent
around  $120  every  three  to  four weeks to  purchase  marijuana  from  a  dispensary  using
his  medical  marijuana   card,  and   he   used   marijuana   daily,  at  times,  for  almost  a   year.
When Applicant lived in state B from February 2020 to August 2020, he spent around $40
every three weeks to one month to purchase marijuana from his roommates, and he used
marijuana daily, at times. After he obtained a medical marijuana card, his parents’ attitude
toward his marijuana use somewhat changed, and they permitted him to use marijuana
in  their  backyard.  He  used  marijuana  while  he  resided  with  them,  from  approximately
August 2020 to February 2021. In his June 2021 response to interrogatories, he stated
that he last purchased marijuana in March 2021, from a marijuana dispensary. He also
stated in his response to interrogatories that he last used marijuana in May 2021, and
that his frequency of marijuana use up to that point was approximately once every two to
three weeks. He testified that he last used marijuana in approximately March 2022, and
that his medical marijuana card expired in May 2022. (Tr. at 21-31, 35-39, 49-59, 62-66,
68, 71; GE 1-2)
Applicant disclosed his marijuana use on his SCA.  In response to a question in
section 23 that inquired whether he intended to use it in the future, Applicant stated:
Honestly,  this  is  a   maybe.  If   my   employment  is  contingent  on   not  using
medical marijuana, then  I will fully  commit to  not using  it. However, due  to
its  medicinal   nature   and   the   fact  that   I   have   a   qualifying   condition,  if  my
employment   is  not   contingent   on   remaining   THC   free,  then   I  would   be
inclined to resume use.
(GE 1)
Applicant  indicated,  during  his  December  2020  interview  with  a  background
investigator,  that  he  would  not  use  marijuana  if  it  negatively  affected  his  chances  for
employment or a security clearance. He also indicated that if there were no issue with his
medical marijuana use, he would continue to use marijuana because he believed it helped
treat his neurological disorder.  He testified that at the time he  made the above-quoted
statement on his SCA, “my thinking was if I don’t have to stop, I wouldn’t like to because
I don’t personally see any -- I mean, it’s never affected my work . . ..” He testified, “. . . I
have stopped smoking marijuana in the last six months or so. And I’m willing certainly to
continue that.” (Tr. at 20-21, 31, 39; GE 1-2)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  aware  when  he  completed  his  SCA,  when  the
background investigator interviewed him, and when he responded to the interrogatories,
that marijuana is illegal under federal law and that his illegal drug use raised concerns.
He acknowledged that he continued to use marijuana when he completed his SCA, in his
response  to  interrogatories,  and  since  receiving  the  SOR.  He  testified  that  he  was
unaware that illegal drug use was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. (Tr. at
20-21, 31, 39, 50-61, 70; GE 1-2)
Applicant  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  twice  between  April  2018  and  June
2020. He purchased it from friends on both occasions. He initially used it out of curiosity,
and then he used it again because he knew that he liked that it made him feel happy and
carefree. He purchased and used ecstasy once in April 2018, out of curiosity, and he did
not  like  how  it  made  him  feel.  He  testified  that  he  had  no  future  intention  of  using
hallucinogenic mushrooms or ecstasy. (Tr. at 39-43, 49-50, 66-68; GE 1-2)
Applicant testified that he submitted to a pre-employment drug test by his employer
in  February 2021,  and  that he  tested  negative  for illegal drugs.  He  stated  that he  was
subject to random drug testing by his employer, but he had not yet been selected for such
a  test.  He  testified  that  he  submitted  to  six  pre-employment  drug  tests  for  each  of  his
employers, and all tested negative for illegal drugs aside from one that was inconclusive
after he dropped the urine sample in the toilet. He maintained that the inconclusive test
would not have tested positive for illegal drugs had he not dropped it. He acknowledged
that he used marijuana during the periods leading up to, and in the periods after, each of
the pre-employment drug tests, to include the one administered by his current employer.
He testified, in reference to a pre-employment drug test administered to him in April 2020
when he lived in state B and was using marijuana daily, “I knew that I needed to clean up
as it were.” He testified that, aside from his marijuana use, he felt he has demonstrated a
consistent  pattern  of  employability  and  good  citizenship.  He  endeavored  to  be  honest
about his marijuana use, and stated that it never affected his work performance.  (Tr. at
31-36, 50-61, 66; GE 2)
Applicant  is  aware  that  his  roommate  uses  marijuana  “extremely  infrequently,”
although  he  has  never  witnessed  it,  and  that  his  roommate  had  products  containing
marijuana  in their apartment.  He has  two friends  who  also  use  marijuana  infrequently,
sometimes in his presence. As of the date of the hearing and since March 2022, he has
found himself in situations where marijuana was being used and where he was offered
marijuana, and he instead had a beer or entertained himself another way. He stated that
flower  containing  marijuana  and  marijuana-related
he  still  possessed  a  dried
paraphernalia. In September 2022, he signed a statement of intent not to abuse any drugs
in the future. He stated that as a showing of good faith and commitment,  he remained
abstinent  from  illegal  drug  use  and  he  removed  all  products  containing  marijuana  and
marijuana-related paraphernalia from his apartment. (Tr. at 47-50, 61-62, 66-72; AE A)

Drug  Involvement  and Substance  Abuse
Applicant’s  history  of  drug  involvement  and  substance  abuse  is  established  by
disclosures in his February 15, 2021 SF-86, in his January 24, 2022 response to DOHA
interrogatories  that  contained  his  March  30,  2021  Office  of  Personnel  Management
(OPM) Personal Subject Interview (PSI), in his undated SOR Answer, and in his hearing
testimony.  (GE  1,  GE  2)  A  summary  of  that  drug  involvement  and  substance  abuse
follows.
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that from about October 2012 through the present, Applicant
purchased  and  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency,  adding  that  he  intends  to
continue using marijuana in the future unless he holds a security clearance. In his SOR
Answer,  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation,  adding  that  there  was  “no  evidence  of
psychological  or  physical  dependence  on  the  drug.”  He  stated  his  use  of  marijuana
would end upon being granted a security clearance. (SOR Answer)
At his hearing, Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in high school in
March 2012. While in high school, he purchased marijuana from a friend and described
his  use  as  “[m]aybe  twice  a  year.”  While  in  college  from  2015  to  2019,  he  purchased
marijuana “[a]bout half of the times” he used it,  and described his use as “once a week
on the  weekends.”  The use of marijuana was not legal in his state of residence at any
point during the years 2012 to 2019. (Tr. 16-18)
After  graduating  from  college  in  2019,  until  March  2022,  Applicant’s  marijuana
use was the “most frequent . . . a couple times a week.” During the period from 2019 to
January 2021, he drove to a location where he could purchase marijuana legally about
“once  a  month.”  In  January  2021,  he  moved  to  his  current  state  of  residence  where
marijuana is legal under state law. (Tr. 18-20) After this move, he purchased all of  his
marijuana from state-licensed dispensaries. (Tr. 20-21)
Applicant stopped using marijuana in March 2022 because he is more productive
when  not  using  marijuana.  His  career,  relationships,  health,  and  fitness  are  all  better
without  the habitual use  of marijuana.  He described the  security clearance process as
“eye-opening.” He stated that he planned to reach out to a substance abuse therapist to
“stay consistent with this transition” of a drug-free lifestyle. Applicant added that he has
“mostly avoided” associating with friends who still use drugs. (Tr. 21-22; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  from  about  January  2016  through  at  least  March  2021,
Applicant  purchased  and  used  the  prescription  medication  Adderall  that  was  not
prescribed  to  him,  adding  that  he  intends  to  continue  using  Adderall  without  a
prescription. In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted this allegation, but denied that he
intends to continue using Adderall without a prescription in the future. He stated that he
has not used Adderall since March 2021. (SOR Answer)
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  first  used  Adderall  when  he  was  a
freshman  in  college.  A  friend  gave  it  to  him  when  he  was  “cramming”  for  an
examination.  Applicant  stated  that  the  Adderall  helped  him  “with  staying  on  task  and
being able to study for as long as [he] needed to study for and to retain the information
to  regurgitate  that  onto  the  test.”  The  last  time  Applicant  used  Adderall  was  in  March
2021 when he was studying for a certification. He used Adderall infrequently in college,
once every two months or whenever he had a big project to complete. After college, he
used Adderall “maybe once a quarter.” (Tr. 26-29)
Applicant corrected the number of times he used Adderall from the 50 times he
listed  on  his  SF-86  to  approximately  30  times.  Applicant  stopped  using  Adderall  in
March 2021 because, after evaluating the negative versus the positive benefits of using
Adderall, he decided the negatives outweighed the positives. He obtained Adderall from
friends  who  had  prescriptions  for  it.  He  previously  stated  that  he  intended  to  continue
using Adderall out of “stubbornness.” As previously stated in his SOR Answer,  he does
not intend to use Adderall in the future. (Tr. 29-31; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  from  about  November  2016  through  at  least  February
2021,  Applicant  purchased  and  used  ecstasy  with  varying  frequency.  In  his  SOR
Answer,  he  admitted  this  allegation,  adding  that  his  use  of  ecstasy  was  purely
experimental  and  mostly  occurred  while  he  was  in  college.  He  stated  that  he  has  not
used ecstasy since February 2021. (SOR Answer)
At his hearing, Applicant reiterated that, as he stated in his SOR Answer, he last
used  ecstasy  in  February  2021.  He  described  his  ecstasy  use  as  “experimental.”  He
used ecstasy while  in college  “during  a  big  party,” and  later at  a  “few  music festivals.”
He  estimated  that  he  used  ecstasy  four  times.  He  purchased  ecstasy  one  time  and
obtained  it  the  other  times  from  friends.  He  stopped  using  ecstasy  because  the
negatives outweighed the positives. (Tr. 31-33)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  from  about  March  2019  through  November  2020,
Applicant purchased and used hallucinogenic drugs with varying frequency. In his SOR
Answer, Applicant admitted this allegation, adding that his use of hallucinogenic drugs
was purely experimental. He has not used hallucinogenic drugs since November 2020.
(SOR Answer)
At his hearing, Applicant reiterated what he wrote in his SOR Answer that he last
used hallucinogenic drugs in November 2020. He compared his hallucinogenic drug use
to  that  of  ecstasy,  “extremely  infrequent,  purely  experimental.”  He  estimated  that  he
used  hallucinogenic  drugs  three  times.  He  purchased  hallucinogenic  drugs  one  time
and obtained it the other times from friends. (Tr. 33-34)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  from  about  November  2016  through  at  least  February
2021,  Applicant  purchased  and  used  cocaine  with  varying  frequency.  In  his  SOR
Answer,  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation,  adding  that  his  use  of  cocaine  was
occasional  and  mostly  occurred  in  college.  He  has  not  used  cocaine  since  February
2021. (SOR Answer)
At his hearing, Applicant reiterated what he stated in his SOR Answer, testifying
that the first time he used cocaine  was in November 2016 and the last time he used it
was in February 2021. He characterized his cocaine use as “occasional,” estimating that
he  used  it “about  40  times.” His cocaine  use  was “mostly in college  and  always during
social  gatherings.”  He  infrequently  purchased  cocaine  from  a  college  friend  and  the
other  times  he  obtained  it  from  friends.  He  stopped  using  cocaine  because  the
negatives outweighed the positives. (Tr. 34-36; AE A)
Applicant has never participated in a drug rehabilitation program, nor has he ever
been  diagnosed  with  a  substance  abuse  disorder.  (Tr.  36)  During  his  hearing,  he
submitted a statement claiming he  “will be  consulting with  a substance abuse therapist
in [location] to ensure I stay consistent.” (AE A) From 2012 to 2022, the only time period
that he  was  totally abstinent from drug use  was  a  three-month period  before  his 2018
summer  internship. That  was  in  part to  ensure  he  would  pass  his drug-screening test.
(Tr. 37) Applicant never sold drugs, but reciprocated with individuals who had provided
him drugs by doing the same for them. (Tr. 37-38)
Applicant  works  for  an  employer  who  requires  a  drug-free  environment.  His
explanation  to  continue  using  drugs,  contrary  to  this  policy,  was  because  of
“stubbornness” and for no  good  reason. He understood  at  the  time  when  his employer
hired  him  they  had  a  drug-free  policy.  After  passing  his  entry-level  drug  test  when  he
was hired in 2018, he has not been tested since. (Tr. 22-24) His job is full time remote,
and  he  has  no  expectation  that  he  will  be  required  to  report  to  an  office  environment.
(Tr. 24-25)
Applicant  submitted  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement  and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (AE A)  Applicant stated
that  he  swallowed  his  pride  and  determined  that  a  drug-free  life  is  better  than  a  life
spent  misusing  and  being  involved  with  drugs. He believes that  “turning  this page” will
greatly improve his overall health and enhance his career and his relationship with his
family. (Tr. 38-39; AE A) Applicant’s family is aware of his drug use and is supportive of
him remaining drug-free. (Tr. 39-40)

In or about March 2019, while in the Army, Applicant used marijuana. He held a
security clearance at the time. His marijuana use led to the failure of a random urinalysis
test. Subsequently, he  received  non-judicial punishment under Article 15  of  the  Uniform
Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ)  for the  offense  of  wrongful use  of  marijuana  –  detected  by
urinalysis, and  wrongful use  of  marijuana  –  not detected  by  urinalysis.  (Item  1  at 3)  During

Applicant failed to disclose his use of marijuana and his non-judicial punishment for
failing a drug test, as required on his security clearance application of January 2021. In his
interview  with  an  investigative  agent,  he  said  that  he  failed  to  disclose  the  required
information because he forgot to include it. (GE 2 at 4) In his answer, he stated that he

connection with his employment.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.
Applicant began working for his current employer in March 2019.  He is applying
for  a  security  clearance  for  the  first  time.  As  part  of  the  application  process,  he
completed the security clearance application (SF-86) dated December 13, 2021. In the
application, he admitted illegal drug use.
Applicant  has  used  marijuana  from  about  2013  to  at  least  January  2022,  with
varying frequency.  He began smoking marijuana during his first year of college.  (Tr. p.
23.)  During  this  period,  he  struggled  in  school,  and  was  depressed.  He  continued
smoking  marijuana,  mainly  in  social  settings  with  friends.  He  testified  that  he  usually
smokes marijuana once every two or three months.  (Tr. p. 24.)  He stated that he used
it less than 20 times a year or less than 100 times in the last seven years.  (Government
Exhibit 1.)  He testified that he believed that it was legal to use.  He usually obtained it
for use from his friends.  On one occasion, in 2017/2018, he purchased marijuana at a
dispensary in a state where he believed it to be legal under state law.  (Tr. p. 26.)
After being hired by his current employer in March 2019, Applicant continued to
use marijuana.  He states that he is not aware of his company’s drug policy.  (Tr. p. 28.)
None  of  his  supervisors  or  management  is  aware  of  his  illegal  drug  use.  (Tr.  p.  28.)
When  he  was  hired,  he  was  advised  to  read  the  Employee  Handbook,  but  he  did  not
take  the  time  to  do  so.  He  also  received  regular  annual  briefings  about  company
policies  and  procedures.  He  is  not  subject  to  random  urinalysis.  In  January 2022,  he
stopped  using  marijuana  when  he  learned  that  federal  law  prohibits  the  use  of
marijuana.
Applicant  explained  that  he  last  used  marijuana  in  January  2022,  after
completing  his  security  clearance  application.  He  was  celebrating  his  Birthday,  and
received marijuana as a Birthday gift from a friend.  (Tr. p. 29.)  He used it to celebrate
and  decompress.  In  response  to  interrogatories  he  completed  as  part  of  his  security
clearance  background  investigation,  Applicant  initially  stated  that  he  intended  to
continue  using  marijuana  even  after  being  issued  a  security  clearance.  (Government
Exhibit  2.)  He  explained  that  he  held  this  belief  because  of  his  stubbornness  and
unwillingness to take full responsibility for the current role he is in.
Applicant  shared   that  he   has  been   seeing   a   therapist  to   help   him   take
responsibility   for   his actions.    Applicant’s father is   battling   dementia   and   Applicant   has
recently  been  required  to  help  the  family  by  taking  his sister  to  school and  other things.
Applicant was not happy  about having  to  take  on  these  additional responsibilities.  His
therapist  is helping  him  gain  a  better  understanding  of how  to  be  responsible.   (Tr. pp.
30-34.)
He  is  also  learning  how  to  believe  in  himself  more,  take  responsibility  for  his
actions  and  to fully  engross  himself  in  any  role  where  he  is  needed.  Applicant  states
that he is now a role model at work, where he is mentoring the new hires and providing
guidance to them on the programs and practices used at work.  He wants to continue in
this  role  and  to  one  day  become  a  program/project  manager  in  the  defense  industry

have  you
any  controlled  substance,  narcotics,  depressants,
hallucinogenics, steroids, or prescription drugs, experimenting or otherwise consuming
any  controlled  substance”  as  alleged  under Guideline  E,  in  SOR  ¶  2.b,the  SOR  cross
alleged the marijuana use  allegation in ¶ 1.a. Applicant denied these allegations in the
SOR. (Item 2)
In his answer, Applicant denied the SOR allegation that he used marijuana with
varying  frequency  from  about  1999  to  at  least  2021and  stated  that  he  tried  marijuana
once in 1999 and did not use marijuana again until 2013 when his roommate moved in.
He acknowledged that the use of marijuana was after his initial security screening in 2009.
He continued to relate that he used it about a handful of times, with the last time being
Thanksgiving 2021. (Item 2)
In  his  September  5,  2018,  SCA  he  acknowledged  that  he  had  been  smoking
marijuana about once a week for recreational use because it provides a good method of
relaxation. He specified the time was from March 1999 until August 2018. He admitted
that he was using marijuana while holding a security clearance, and that he intended to
use the marijuana in the future. (Item 3)
During  Applicant’s  January  2019  interview,  he  stated  that  he  bought  marijuana
from friends. He noted that he is not dependent on the illegal use of marijuana and has
never  tested  positive  for  it..  He  commented  that  it  has  never  affected  his  judgment  or
personality. He claims there has been no negative impact on his work or home life. (Item
3)
Applicant  answered  DOHA  interrogatories  in  April  2022.  He  stated  that  he  last
used marijuana during Thanksgiving  2021 and further acknowledged that he  knew that
marijuana was illegal under Federal law and that his employer prohibited the use of all
illegal drugs. Applicant stated that he would abstain from further drug use. (Item 4)
Applicant’s admissions and the evidence in the record, especially while holding a
security  clearance  is  serious.  He  has  not  presented  in  a  credible  manner  a  case  for
granting him a security clearance.

September 2008 SCA by answering “NO” to the questions in Section 24 – Illegal Use of
Drugs of Drug Activity as set forth in subparagraph 1.a of the SOR. It cross-alleged his
marijuana use in SOR ¶ 2.b.
Applicant  denied  the  falsification  allegations  because  he  believes  he  made  a
mistake  and misinterpreted the question in assuming the other sections correlated. He
claimed he answered the question incorrectly by an honest mistake. He  claims he was
not trying to hide anything or be deceptive, or lie. He has held a security clearance since
2009. On his SCA, he answered “NO.” to have you ever illegally used or otherwise been
illegally  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security
clearance other than previously listed? He did not add any information concerning this
issue in his  DOHA interrogatories. He insisted that he had no ill intentions because his

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  his  Answer  to  the  SOR.  (¶¶1.a  and
1.b,  and  2.a.)  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  57  years old.  He  was  previously married  from  about  1984  to  2014,
and he married his current spouse in 2020. He has three adult children. He graduated
from  high  school  in  1983,  and  attended  college  for  one  semester.  He  has  been
employed by his present employer, a federal contractor, since November 2018. His job
title is director of information technology. Applicant was granted an interim DOD security
clearance in August 2019, and he has never been notified that his interim DOD security
was revoked. (Tr. 13-15; GE 1)
Drug Involvement and Falsification
In his February 2019 SCA, Applicant intentionally failed to disclose, as required,
that  he  had  used  and  purchased  marijuana  from  2012  to  present.  He  testified  at  the
hearing that he did not disclose this information because he was worried that he would
not  get  a  DOD  security  clearance,  and  he  would  be  fired  by  his  employer.  He  also
admitted  that  during  his  first  background  interview  conducted  in  June  2019,  he
deliberately failed to disclose his use and purchase of marijuana to an authorized DOD
investigator. A second interview was conducted in March 2020 to confront him about his
failure  to  report  illegal  drug  use.  He  then  admitted  that  he  had  used  marijuana  from
approximately  “2014”  to  the  present  time.  He  reported  that  he  smokes  marijuana  at
least  one  time  per  week,  and  if  he  is  on  vacation,  he  will  smoke  it  daily.  He  also
estimated  that  he  spends  about  $400  to  $500  on  a  monthly  basis  to  purchase
marijuana. (GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 15-18, 23)
Applicant stated that even though he applied for a DOD security clearance with
the  submission  of  the February 2019 SCA, he  never had  the  intention  to  abstain from
smoking  marijuana.  Both  he  and  his  wife  use  marijuana  in  the  home.  He  testified,
however,  that  he  recently  made  a  decision  to  stop  smoking marijuana.  His  last  use  of
marijuana  occurred  on  October  2,  2022.  He  decided  that  he  would  no  longer  smoke
marijuana because he would like to keep his current employment. His wife continues to
smoke marijuana in the home. He also acknowledged that using marijuana is illegal in
his state of residence and in violation of federal law. He has not reported his illegal drug
use to his facility security officer. (Tr. 18-22; GE 2

"Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked  since  1999.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  1989.  He  was  married  from
2006 until February 2017, when he finalized his divorce. He served on active duty with
the U.S. Marines from 1991 until 1994, when he received an honorable discharge.  He
resides  with  his  girlfriend,  to  whom  he  is  engaged  to  be  married.  He  has  two  adult
children. (Tr. 15-18, 27; GE 1)
At all times relevant to this proceeding, marijuana purchase, possession, and use
has  been  illegal  under  federal  law.  Federal  laws  regarding  marijuana  supersede  any
state  laws  that  are  inconsistent  with  it.  Applicant  was  granted  access  to  classified
information at all times relevant hereto. (Tr. 17; GE 1, 2)
In  about  February  2020,  Applicant  traveled  about  45  miles  from  home  to
purchase marijuana from a dispensary in State A, where it was sold legally under state
law. In February and March 2020, he used marijuana on weekend nights a total of about
16  times  in  order  to  help  him  sleep.  He  did  not  report  his  marijuana  purchase,
possession, or use to his employer or facility security officer (FSO) until he realized that
he would likely be caught for this use. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR,
such as Applicant’s failure to report his marijuana purchase, possession, and use to his
employer  or  FSO,  cannot  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be  considered
when  assessing  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions  and  for  the  whole-person
analysis. On March 24, 2020, he underwent a random drug test through his employer.
Prior to the test, he told his employer that he did not believe that he would pass the drug
test because he had been using marijuana. He tested positive for marijuana after taking
this  drug  test.  As  a  result  of  his  marijuana  use  and  positive  drug  test,  his  employer
created  an  incident  report  in  the  Defense  Information  System  for Security  (DISS).  (Tr.

While   using   marijuana,  Applicant   knew   it  was  illegal  to   do   so.   Since   1999,   he
received   annual  training   regarding   his  responsibilities  as  a   security   clearance   holder
with   respect  to   illegal  drugs.  He  knew   that   using   marijuana   violated   the   conditions   of
holding  his security  clearance  and  the  terms of  his employment.  He knew  that  he  was
subject   to   random   drug   testing.  Applicant  has  sleep   apnea   and   other  unspecified
ailments.  He claimed  he  used  marijuana  despite  knowing  it was illegal and  incompatible
with   holding   a   security  clearance,   because   he   was  desperate   to   get  quality   sleep.  His
girlfriend  recommended  that he  try m  arijuana  for his sleeping  problems. A doctor did not
recommend   or  prescribe   him   marijuana.   He  did  try   other  prescription   and   non-
prescription  medications to  help  him  sleep  before resorting  to  marijuana.  (Tr.  15-19, 31-
34, 36; Answer)
As  a  result  of  his  positive  drug  test,  instead  of  terminating  him,  Applicant’s
employer  suspended  him  without  pay  until  he  completed  a  substance  abuse  program
(SAP).  On  May  2,  2020,  he  completed  an  SAP.  The  SAP  consisted  of  three  group
meetings a week for 30 days. His employer also placed him on probation for 24 months.
While  he  was  on  probation,  he  could  not  be  promoted.  His  employer  required  him  to
take   monthly   drug   tests   for  38   months.   His  employer  also  had   him   enter  into   a   “Last
Chance   Agreement”  whereby   he   acknowledged   that  any   recurrence   of  inappropriate
behavior  would  result   in  his  immediate   termination   of  employment.   After  his  initial
positive   drug   test,   all   of   his  subsequent   monthly   drug   tests  have   had   negative   results.
After he  completes 38 months of monthly  drug  tests,  Applicant will be  subject  to  random
drug   tests.   Applicant  is  no   longer  on   probation.  He   was  promoted   at   work  once   he
became   eligible.   He  claimed   that  he   will   never  use   marijuana   again  and   that  he   is
“scared   to   death”  because   of  all   the   trouble   it  has   caused   him.   (Tr.   22-24,   36-37;
Answer; GE  1, 2; AE A, B)
From  about  January  2022  until  he  received  the  SOR  in  March  2022,  Applicant
purchased  marijuana  for  his  girlfriend  on  three  separate  occasions.  He  purchased  the
marijuana  at  the  same  dispensary  in  State  A  from  which  he  purchased  marijuana  for
himself in 2020. He claimed that he purchased the marijuana instead of his girlfriend as
he  received  a  discount  because  he  is  a  military  veteran.  He  claimed  he  did  not
understand  that  purchasing marijuana  is illegal.  He  thought  that  he  was  doing nothing
wrong as long as he was not using marijuana.  He claimed that his annual training, his
SAP and his Last Chance Agreement did not inform him that purchasing marijuana was
inappropriate or illegal. There is no documentary evidence in the record relating to this
training, the SAP, or the Last Chance Agreement. He claimed that after he received the
SOR,  he  realized  that  purchasing  marijuana  is  illegal,  so  he  stopped  purchasing
marijuana and wants nothing more to do with it. (Tr. 24-35, 37)
Applicant’s girlfriend has used marijuana recreationally for at least six years and
plans to continue to use it. She has used it a couple  of times per week. She has kept
the  marijuana  in  the  home  she  shares  with  Applicant,  but  has  used  it  on  the  property
outside the house. She has used it while Applicant is home.  Applicant claimed that he
does not monitor her use and “just stay(s) away from it.” (Tr. 24-35)
Applicant  provided  character  reference  letters  from  two  co-workers  who  know
him  noting  his
trustworthiness,  strong  character,
selflessness, and good work ethic. They also note that he cares for his family and has
always  provided  for  them.  His  employer  awarded  him  a  certificate  of  recognition  in
March 2022 for his significant contribution to a work project. (AE A, B)

Under Guideline H, the  SOR alleged  Applicant’s purchase  and use  of marijuana
in February and March 2020 while holding a security clearance. The SOR also alleged
Applicant’s March 2020 failed drug test and the resultant punishment from his employer.
He admitted the SOR allegations with additional comment. (SOR; Answer)
",False
"In her Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Paragraph
1  of  the  SOR,  and  denied  the  factual  allegations  in  Paragraph  2  of  the  SOR,  with
explanations.  She  also  provided  additional  information  to  support  her  request  for
eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant  is  30  years  old,  unmarried,  and  has  no  children.  She  works  for  a
defense  contractor.  (TR  at  page  12  line  1  to  page  13  line  6,  and  GX  1  at  page  5.)
Applicant was born and raised in State A until about May of 2016, when she moved to
State B, where she presently resides. (GX 1 at pages 5, and 8~13.)
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement
1.a. and 1.b.  Applicant admits she used marijuana, with varying frequency from
about 2008 until her last usage in March of 2021, more than a year prior to the issuance
of the SOR. Applicant used it recreationally, but also to treat menstrual pains. Applicant
admits  that  she  used  marijuana  after  being  granted  a  security  clearance  in  August  of
2018. (TR at page 13 line 7 to page 16 line 14, and at page 21 line 22 to page 22 line

submitted three negative drug tests: June 2022, and two in September 2022. (AppXs A,

(7) seven  years”  on  her March 2021  e-QIP. (GX 2  at page  57.) Applicant  avers, in part,
that she  did not know the  use  of marijuana  was illegal. (TR at page  17 line  7  to  page  18
line   21.)    I   find   this  to   be   a   willful   falsification   as   the   use   of  marijuana   is  illegal  under
Federal law. Applicant  argues  that she  thought  that its use  is legal in State  B;  but this
argument   holds  little  weight,   as  it  was   not   legal  in  State   A   where   she   resided   prior  to
May 2016.

Drugs  . . . in the  last  (7) seven  years”  on  her  February 2017  e-QIP.  (GX 1  at page  45.)
Applicant  avers, in part,  that she  did not  know the  use  of  marijuana  was illegal. (TR at

illegal under Federal   law.  Applicant’s   use   of   marijuana   was  not   legal  in   State   A   where
she resided  prior to May 2016.
",True
"Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 62 years old. He graduated from high school and completed various
certifications. He never married and has no children. He has been employed by a federal
contractor since December 2020.
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2021. In
it, he disclosed that from 1975 until April 2021 he used marijuana about once a week. He
stated, “Used for pain relief, about ½ oz. per year in use.” He stated he did not intend to
use marijuana in the future because “could effect working on the Fed side of [X] business.”
(Item 3). X is Applicant’s present employer.
Applicant also disclosed in his SCA that he used cocaine periodically from 1975 to
June 2017. He also said in his SCA that he quit using cocaine three years ago, which is
inconsistent with the dates he provided. He used it weekly in the 1970s. He said, “quit for
many years then [sporadic]. I have quit with no plans to start again.” (Item 3). He said the
reason he stopped using cocaine was because it is “bad for your health and it is bad for
your career.” (Item 3)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2021. He told
the investigator that he used marijuana from 1975 to 1985 and then resumed using it in
2010 until April 2021. For the past ten years he used marijuana at home and before then
he used it while out with friends. His more  recent use consisted of taking  “a hit” before
bed if he could not sleep. He purchased marijuana in the past seven years and his last
purchase was June 2020. He purchased it through a friend. He purchased it so he could
use it to help him sleep. He said he did not intend to purchase marijuana in the future. He
continues to socialize with friends who use marijuana, but said he does not use it with
them. He uses it alone. He told the investigator he stopped using it to keep his job. (Item
4)
Applicant told the investigator that he used cocaine monthly or quarterly. He would
use up to maybe half of a gram. It made him happy. He would use it at his house or his
friends or hanging out at a party. He has not purchased cocaine in the last seven years.
He explained his motivation was for acceptance. It was around him so he used it too. He
used it with his brother and a friend. He said he no longer associates with those he used
cocaine with. He did not elaborate on whether he no longer has contact with his brother.
He  said  he  has  changed  his  behavior  to  prevent  future  use.  He  did  not  explain  what
behavior he changed or how. He said he quit using cocaine because he has grown “too
old” to continue using it. (Item 4)
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he provided details about the type of work
he does for his employer. He explained he does not talk about his work to anyone outside
of work. He was willing to submit to random drug testing. He said his trustworthiness and
reliability  has  never  been  questioned.  He  would  never  do  anything  to  jeopardize  his
career,  country,  or  family.  He  noted  his  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and
regulations. He stated, “I am a law abiding citizen and although I have had issues in the
past,  I  have  worked  very  hard  to  turn  those  issues  around.  This  includes  going  to  AA
meetings,  talking  with  professionals,  seeking  professional  help  as  needed.”  He  further
stated that he does not intend to travel outside of the country. (AE A)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when applying the mitigating conditions
and in a whole-person analysis.
",False
"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 27 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2018. He is not married
and has no children. He has been employed by a federal contractor since July 2018. (Item
3)
In June 2016, Applicant was employed as a summer intern for a company that had
random drug testing. He was terminated the same month for testing positive for marijuana
on a random drug test. He explained that he had used marijuana several weeks prior to
starting the job. (Items 3, 5)
In October 2021, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In it
he disclosed that from 2013 to October 2021, he occasionally used marijuana about once
every two months on average from 2013 to 2014; once every two weeks while attending
college from 2014 to 2018, more frequently during the school year and less frequently
during the summer months; and once a month on average from 2020 to 2021. (Item 3)
Applicant stated in his SCA the following:
I inten[d]  to  use  THC  on  occasional frequency  in the  future provided  nothing
regarding  my  employment responsibilities changes. One  potential impact to
my   employment  responsibilities  would  be   the   successful   obtainment  of  a
Federal Security   Clearance.  In   this case,  I  would  refrain  from   using   THC
while in possession of  the clearance. (Item  3)
Applicant disclosed that he purchased marijuana illegally from people he knew in
his hometown and at college about once every two months from 2013 to 2018. It was not
legal in his state when he purchased it. (Item 3)
Applicant disclosed on his SCA that he used hallucinogenic drugs five times. He
used LSD twice in 2014 and once in 2020 and mushrooms once in 2017 and 2019. He
stated he does not intend to use these drugs in the future because it does not appeal to
him and the risks of using them are too high. (Item 3)
Additionally,  Applicant  disclosed  that  from  2015  to  September  2020  he  used
cocaine eight times. It was provided by someone else and he consumed it through his
nose. He reported that five of his uses were in college, then twice in late 2018 and once
in  2020.  He  reported he  does  not  intend  to use  cocaine  in  the future  as  it  was  not  an
appealing drug to him and the risks of using it were too high. (Item 3)
In  December  2021,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  as
part of his background investigation. He reported to the investigator that his last use of
marijuana  was  October  2021.  He  confirmed  his  previously  disclosed  cocaine  and
hallucinogenic drug use and frequency. He confirmed that he continues to have contact
with  two  of  his friends with  whom he used  illegal drugs.  He said he  changed his mind
about using marijuana and other illegal drugs in the future, and he does not intend to use
any illegal drugs in the future. He is focused on his future. He explained he used all of
these drugs for fun and recreation. (Item 5)
In June 2022, Applicant completed government interrogatories. He was transferred
by his employer and  moved  to a  new state  in  October 2021.  Marijuana  can  be  legally
obtained in that state. He reported in his interrogatories that his last use of marijuana was
November 2021 in the state where he had moved. This contradicts the date that he told
the government investigator that his last use was October 2021. He stated he decided to
stop using marijuana. (Items 3, 4) He said:
Decided   to   focus  on   career  including   security   clearance   application.
Decided  risk to  career, reputation,  legal action  was not worth  it.  Additionally
decided to  focus on physical health as an  adult. (Item 4)
Applicant stated he continues to associate with persons who use illegal substances
and frequents places where he has reason to believe illegal substances are used or are
used  in  his  presence.  He  stated  that  this  occurs  about  once  every  three  months  at
concerts and outdoor parks, but he typically does not find himself in these situations. He
reported  that  when  he  had  been  in  situations  where  illegal  drugs  were  present,  he
removed himself and made it clear he had made a decision not to use illegal drugs. (Item
4)
Applicant stated that he has changed his professional situation and joined a new
team at his job, which supports the military, and having a security clearance is desirable.
He said he applied for a security clearance in December 2021. His SCA was signed on
October 22, 2021. (Items 3, 4)

He was granted national security eligibility in May 2012 in connection with his employment
with a Government contractor at that time. He seeks to retain his eligibility and security
clearance in connection with his current employment. (Item 4 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 17,

Paragraph 1  - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The  Government  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a  security
clearance because of his illegal use of a controlled substance, marijuana. The three SOR
allegations are supported by Applicant’s admissions in his Answer and in his Response.
The  allegations  are  also  evidenced  by  Applicant’s  statements  in  his  e-QIP and  a  prior
security clearance application, dated March 8, 2012 (2012 SCA), and his comments made
during  interviews  with  investigators  from  the Office  of  Personnel Management  held  on
December 31, 2020, and March 20, 2012. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; Response.)
The details regarding  the  three  SOR allegations and  Applicant’s admissions  are
as follows:
1.a. THC use from August 1995 to December 2018. In high school and  college,
Applicant  frequently  used  marijuana.  He  continued  using  marijuana  in  the  early  2000s
after  his  graduation  from  college,  but  that  use  significantly  decreased  as  his  career
progressed. After his marriage in 2007 and the birth of his first child in 2009, his use of
marijuana  became  “very rare.” During  the  period  from  2013  to  2016, he  used  marijuana
about one  time  per year on  average, typically during  camping  trips with  college  friends in
the  rural state  in which  they all  lived  at  that time  and  attended  college  together.  His friends
were  using  marijuana, and  he  wanted  to  feel involved. With  the  birth  of his second  child
in 2014  and  his  relocation  of his family to  a  state  across  the  country late  that  year,  he  saw
little  of  his camping  friends with  one  exception. He used  marijuana  with  that  friend  in  2015
and  2016. He used  marijuana  again  one  last time  in  December 2018.  He has not used
marijuana   in  more  than   four  years  because   he   is  a   “family  man”  and   is  dedicated   to
working   hard   to   support  his  family.  He  also  noted   that  he   understands   that  using
marijuana   is inconsistent  with  holding   a   security  clearance   and   he   no   longer enjoys  it.
(Item  3 at 41; Item 4  at 10, 32; Item  6 at 3.)
1.b. Use of marijuana after submitting his 2012 SCA. Applicant continued to use
marijuana  after  he  signed  his  2012  e-QIP,  as  described  above.  He  commented  in  his
2012 e-QIP that he does not plan on using marijuana again. (Item 3 at 41; Item 4 at 34;
Item 5 at 3-4, 8.)
1.c.  Use  of  marijuana  in  December  2018  while  holding  a  security  clearance.
Applicant was granted national security eligibility and a security clearance in about May
2012.  This allegation  is focused  solely on  Applicant’s  one-time use  in December 2018
while holding a security clearance. The reason for this limitation is unclear. In his e-QIP,
Applicant wrote that his use of marijuana was “very infrequent” and was “less than once
a year at most” during the past seven years (2013 to 2020). He also wrote in his e-QIP
and in his Answer that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future because of his
family responsibilities and his “rewarding career.” In his Response, Applicant noted that
he intends “to continue to abstain from all drug involvement and acknowledge[s] that any
future involvement is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.” He wrote that
his one-time use in 2018 at a New Year’s Eve party in December of that year “was the
last time I ever used THC. He also wrote that the use of marijuana was “not an enjoyable
experience.” He  expressed  his regret  for “his momentary  lack of judgment” “late  in the
evening” in which another person possessed the illegal drug. He also noted that he has
promised his wife that he will never again take any action that might jeopardize his ability
to  support  her  and  their  two  children.  Applicant  noted  that  he  takes  this  promise  very
seriously. (Item 2 at 1, 2; Item 3 at 41; Item 4 at 32; Item 6 at 4; Response at 4.)

marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  November  2015  to  July  2021,  to  include
after being granted access to classified information and that he had been arrested  and
charged with marijuana possession in September 2020.

executed a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) two weeks later. (FORM Item 5.)
When Applicant  submitted his  SCA  in January 2020,  he  disclosed that he used
marijuana  from  about  November  2015  until  December  2019.  He  did  not  answer  the
question on his SCA regarding the nature of use, frequency, and number of times used,
and simply listed “recently stopped” on the line provided for the question. (FORM Item 3
at 23.) In response to the request in the SCA, for an explanation on why he intended or
did not intend to use marijuana in the future, he responded, “Can hinder me from obtain
[sic] security clearance and jobs in the future.”
In  response  to  DOHA interrogatories,  he  listed  “socially” in the  Frequency  of Use
box.  (FORM   Item   4   at  8.)  During   his   enhanced   subject  interview  (ESI)  conducted   in

Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has  engaged  in  the  use  of  controlled
substances  that  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner
inconsistent  with  their  intended  purpose;  and  can  raise  questions  about  his  reliability,
trustworthiness, and ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.
The  SOR  alleges  that  from  May  2019  to  January  2022,  Applicant  has  used
marijuana with varying frequency.  Applicant stated that he would use marijuana about
eight  to  nine  times  a  month.  He  would  use  it  with  his  brother  and  their  friends.
Marijuana would make him feel calm and less irritated.  From about November 2021 to
about January 2022, Applicant has used marijuana about seven times after completing
his security clearance application dated November 16, 2021.  Applicant usually obtained
marijuana  from  co-workers,  or  at  school,  and  when  it  became  legal  in  his  state,  he
purchased  it  at  a  dispensary.  Applicant  has  never  received  any  treatment  for  drug
abuse.  People  who  know  about  his  marijuana  use  are  the  people  he  smokes  with.
Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  (Government Exhibit 2.)
In  his  security  clearance  application  dated  November  16,  2021,  Applicant
explained that he uses marijuana for anxiety purposes induced by stress.  He normally
uses  it  on  weekends  about  twice  a  day.  Sometimes  he  over  thinks  situations  and
marijuana helps to prevent this.  He stated that he has no intent to use marijuana in the
future.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
During  an  interview  with  a  Federal  investigator  on  January  27,  2022,  Applicant
confirmed  his  use  of  marijuana  between  May  2019  and  January 22,  2022.  He  stated
that  he  last  used  it  at  a  techno  concert.  He  also  disclosed  that  since  completing  his
security  clearance  application  on  November  16,  2021,  he  has  continued  to  use
marijuana, at least seven times total.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
In  response  to  the  Government’s  interrogatories  dated  July  21,  2022,  Applicant
stated that he had no intent for future use of marijuana due to the nature of the job he
enjoys.  His job brings less stress to his life.  He is also motivated to live a healthier life.

Applicant is 46 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2000 and a master’s
degree in 2005. He has been employed by a federal contractor since November 2020.
He is also self-employed with his own business since August 2017. Except for a period
from May 2015 to August 2017, Applicant has worked for federal contractors since 2008.
He was married in 2004 and divorced in 2009. He does not have children. (Item 3)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2021. In it, he
disclosed he has held a top secret security clearance since 2008. (Item 3)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that in February 2012, Applicant was charged with operating a
vehicle while intoxicated and operating a vehicle with .10 blood alcohol content (BAC) in
State  A.  In  July  2021,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  He
disclosed that in 2012 he was stopped by police after he had drinks at a bar. He could
not recall how many. He was arrested and later went to court and pleaded guilty to the
offense. He said his driver’s license was suspended for some time, but could not recall
for how long. He was required to pay a fine and perform community service. (Items 2, 3,
10)
Applicant disclosed in his SCA that in November 2015 he was arrested for driving
under the influence (DUI) of alcohol in State B. He was at a bar with friends and consumed
between four to five alcoholic beverages. He felt fine to drive. He was stopped by police
and  failed  a  breathalyzer  test.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI.  He  told  the  government
investigator  that  he  was  ordered  to  pay  a  fine,  complete  community  service,  and  his
license  was  suspended for three months. He  admitted SOR  ¶ 1.b that alleged he  was
charged with DUI in November 2015, found guilty and sentenced to five days in jail and
36 months probation. (Items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10)
In February 2017, Applicant was charged with driving when privilege suspended
for prior DUI conviction in State B. In May 2017, a bench warrant was issued against him
for this offense. It remains active as of the close of the record. (Items 8, 9)
In March 2017, an arrest warrant was issued from  State B where Applicant was
convicted of DUI in 2015, for failing to comply with the probation conditions. The warrant
remains active as of the close of the record. (Items 8, 9)
In December 2017, Applicant was charged in State C with leaving the scene of a
crash and driving while license revoked due to DUI. It appears he had a plea agreement
and  pleaded  guilty  or  no  contest  to  the  revocation  offense  and  received  a  30-day  jail
sentence, which was suspended, and a fine. (Item 4)
Applicant told the government investigator that in April 2019 he was at a friend’s
house and consumed between four and five alcoholic beverages. He was driving home
when he was in a one-car accident. According to the police report, Applicant was trapped
in the vehicle and the roof had to be cut off by the fire department to extricate him from it.
He was observed by the fireman on scene to be highly intoxicated. A check by the police
revealed Applicant’s license had been revoked for a previous DUI. The effective dates of
the revocation was from July 2016 to July 2019. Applicant refused consent to submit to a
blood test. The police obtained  a search  warrant  for Applicant’s  blood test results.  His
blood  alcohol  level  at  the  time  of  the  accident  was  .204%.  The  court  records  reflect
Applicant was charged with DUI in State C, driving while license revoked, and failure to
have insurance. He was convicted of the offenses. He received 2 days’ home confinement
for the DUI (one day suspended), 30 days’ home confinement for driving with a revoked
license, and fines for all three offenses. (Items 5, 10)
Applicant  told  the  government  investigator  that  he  does  not  believe  he  has  a
problem with alcohol. For his 2015 and 2019 DUI convictions, he was required to attend
court-ordered alcohol awareness classes. He said he no longer drinks and drives. He is
a social drinker and goes out about once a month or two months. He will consume two to
three alcoholic beverages and will not drive. He has no intention of drinking and driving
in the future. He said he will not drive even if he consumes one drink. (Item 10)
Applicant  disclosed  in his  SCA  that  from  January 2017  to  March  2017  he  used
cocaine  three  or  four  times  while  at  parties.  He  was  not  working  as  a  government
contractor  at  the  time.  He  told  the  government  investigator  that  he  stopped  using  it
because he did not like it and he did not intend to use it or any other illegal drug in the
future. (Items 3, 10)
SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.j  alleged  delinquent  medical  accounts,  credit  cards,
communication  services,  utilities,  and  other  consumer  accounts  totaling  approximately
$35,249.  Applicant  admitted  them  all  in  his  SOR  answer.  He  told  the  government
investigator that he had some financial problems during the COVID pandemic when he
did not have enough work and fell behind on his bills. When the investigator confronted
him with his delinquent accounts he said he was unaware the accounts were delinquent,
and he would look into them and resolve them. These collection accounts are reported in
Applicant’s June 2021 and February 2022 credit bureau reports. Applicant did not provide
any  information  about  actions  he  may  have  taken  to  pay,  dispute,  or  resolve  these
accounts. (Items 2, 6, 7 10)
",False
"In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, without further comment.
His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  has  never  married  and  he  has  no  children.  He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2017.  In  June  2020,  he  began  working  for  his  current
employer and sponsor for a position of public trust. On his application, he disclosed “at
least”  daily  use  of  marijuana  from  September  2016  to  August  2021,  the  month  he
submitted his application. He  indicated that he enjoyed smoking marijuana, and would
continue to do so. He also said:
I am  aware of the  consequences  for  smoking  weed, and  I  know  what type
of trouble I can get in if this is a concern to  anybody. I am a respectful user
and  only  smoke  when  I am  in the  apartment and  have  no  intentions  to  go
anywhere. (Item  3 at 32)
In his background interview two months later, Applicant indicated that he had continued
purchasing and using marijuana and would continue to do so. (Item 4)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  purchase  and  use  of  marijuana  with  varying
frequency,  from  September  2016  to  August  2021,  and  his  stated  intention  to  continue
using  it.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,  respectively)  Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  in  his
answer to  the  SOR  without further comment.  He  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so he
offered no new information that could mitigate his past conduct or future intentions.
",False
"Applicant  is  34  years  old.  He  has  a  high  school  diploma  and  he  has  attended
trade  school.  He  is  employed  with  a  defense  contractor  as  a  Structures  Aircraft
Mechanic.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment.
The Government alleges that Applicant’s foreign influence could pose a security
risk;  he  has  engaged  in  illegal  substance  abuse;  that  he  is  excessively  indebted;  and
that  he  falsified  his  security  clearance  application.  Applicant  admits  each  of  the
allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR.  Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in
December 2019.
Guideline B- Foreign Influence
Applicant’s spouse  is a  citizen  of Mexico.  She  crossed the border and came to
the  United  States  illegally.  Applicant  met  her  at  a  previous  job,  where  they  worked
together.  They dated for several years, and were married in 2009, in Las Vegas.  After
they were married, Applicant hired an attorney to assist them with immigration services.
Applicant’s  wife’s  immigration  application  was  initially  denied.  Applicant  believes  that
she was denied because the paperwork indicated that she crossed the border with her
two  children  in  hand,  subjecting  them  to  danger.  Applicant  explained  that  her  two
children  crossed  the border,  in  an  earlier date,  and  they  did  not  come  with  her.  They
came before she did.  Applicant stated that he is still in the process of getting his wife
legal  status  in  the  U.S.  He  stated  that  his  wife  currently  has  a  work  permit  that  was
granted about six months ago.  He did not provide a copy of her work permit.  She has a
son and a daughter from a previous relationship, and two children with the Applicant.
Guideline H  –  Drug  Involvement  and Substance Misuse
Applicant  used  the  prescription  drug  Norco,  without  a  prescription,  off  and  on
from  about  2007/2008  to  at  least  August  2019.  He  explained  that  in  2007/2008,  his
father  was  in  an  accident  at  work,  and  Norco  was  prescribed  to  him.  At  some  point,
Applicant suffered back pain and complained to his father about it.  His father gave him
some Norco, and over time, Applicant became addicted to it.  Applicant would obtain the
drug from a  friend at work.  The  cost of the drug was $10 per pill.  At times  he  would
spend  $40  a  day  on  the  pills.  Applicant’s  wife  noticed  that  Applicant  was  spending
money not accounted for.  Applicant realized his addiction and in 2016/2017, he entered
an  out-patient  drug  rehabilitation  program.  The  program  lasted  one  year.  Applicant
completed  the program and  was able to  completely abstain  from drug use  for about 2
and a  half  years.  In 2020, Applicant relapsed  and  started using  Norco  again.  At that
time, Applicant was working for his current employer and he used Norco for about a six-
month period.  (Tr. p. 52.)  Applicant believes that the loss of his brother in 1999, that he
never really addressed, and the stress he experienced at home, caused him to relapse.
In 2020, Applicant then entered a second treatment center for his Norco addiction.  This
time,  Applicant’s  drug  rehabilitation  was  a  ten-day  in-patient  treatment  program.  He
completed the program and has been drug free for the past two and a half years.
Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  previous  employment  for  hitting  an  airplane.
Applicant underwent a drug test that was positive for Norco, and he admits that he was
under the influence of Norco at the time of the accident.  Applicant does not believe he
disclosed this information to his current employer.
Guideline  F –  Financial Considerations
Applicant  is  indebted  to  five  creditors  listed  in  the  SOR,  totaling  $24,489.  He
admits  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR  under  this  guideline.  Applicant’s
credit  reports  dated  May  24,  2019;  March  23,  2020;  and  August  5,  2022,  confirm  this
indebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6.)  The following delinquent debts are of
security concern:
1.    A   debt  is  owed   to   a   bank  for  a   credit  card   account  that  was   charged   off   in   the
approximate  amount of  $5,540.   Applicant  has made  no  payments  towards  the  account.
He recently received court documents regarding  the  matter.  The debt remains owing.
2.  A  debt is owed  to  a  creditor  for an  account that was charged  off in the  approximate
amount   of   $413   with   a   total  balance   of   $4,235.     Applicant   stated   that   he   has  paid  the
debt off, however he has not provided  documentary evidence to support this.
3.    A   debt  is  owed   to   a   creditor  for  a   credit   card   account  that  was   charged   off   in  the
approximate   amount  of  $2,834.     Applicant  has  made   no   payments  towards  the   debt.
The  debt remains owing.
4.    A   debt  is  owed   to   a   creditor  for  a   cellular   account  that  was   charged   off  in  the
approximate  amount  of $1,199.     The  debt  remains owing.
5.  A  debt is owed  to  a  creditor for an  account that was charged  off in the  approximate
amount  of  $10,681.     Applicant  does  not  recall   the   debt  and   has  not  looked   into   it.    It
appears  to   be   a   personal  loan   opened   in  2015.    (Government  Exhibit  4.)     The   debt
remains owing.
Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  dated  May  7,  2019.
Section 23, asked him, “In the past seven years have you intentionally engaged in the
misuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not the drugs were prescribed for
you or someone else?”  Applicant answered, “NO.”  (Government Exhibit 1.)  Applicant
deliberately  failed  to  list  the  prescription  drug  use  discussed  above.  Applicant  stated
that he was embarrassed about his past drug addiction and did not list it.
Section 26 of the same application, asked the Applicant, “In the last seven years,
have you had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency? In the last seven years,
have you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing
to pay as agreed?”  Applicant answered, “NO,” to both questions.  (Government Exhibit
1.)  Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent debts discussed above.
",False
"Applicant  is  50  years  old.  He  has  been  married  since  2012.  His  16-year-old
stepdaughter and 9-year-old daughter still reside in the family home, which he purchased
in  2002.  He  earned  an  engineering  bachelor’s  degree  in  1994,  and  earned  master’s
degrees in aerospace engineering and business administration in, respectively, 1999 and
2007. He began his current employment with a major defense contractor in December
1996,  and  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  1999.  He  has  advanced  through
increasingly  responsible  positions,  and  is  currently  a  senior  engineering  manager.  His
current  duties  mostly  involve  unclassified  work  on  commercial  projects,  but  his
supervisors requested him to apply for continued national security eligibility so he could
continue  his  intermittent  temporary  work advising  DoD-support  programs  on  technical,
planning, staffing, and budgeting considerations. He never served in the military or held
a Federal civil service position. (GE 1; Tr. 9, 27-32.)
Shortly after the  recreational use  of marijuana  was legalized  under his state’s laws
in 2013, Applicant’s wife  wanted  to  obtain and  try some. Applicant agreed  to  participate,
and  she  brought  home  an  edible  and  a  joint  for  them  to  share  on  a  weekend  evening.
Applicant  was  assigned   to   commercial projects  that  involved   no   classified   work during
that  time, and  his company’s drug  policies only prohibited  being  under the  influence  of,
or using, alcohol or  drugs while  at work.  It  did  not occur to  him  that  this experimentation
at home  would  have  any connection  to, or effect on, his security clearance  or employment
so  he did not report it to  anyone at the  time. However, in response to  the  “Illegal Use  of
Drugs   or  Controlled  Substances”  question   in  Section   23   of   his  2019   e-QIP,  he
commented, “I have  used  Marijuana  once  in  the  past  7  years after it had  been  legalized
for personal use in  [his state of residence].” (Answer; GE 1; GE  2; Tr. 32-35.)
Applicant completed  most of the  entries  on  his  2019  e-QIP  during  late  2018,  but
delayed   its  submission   because   he   needed   to   obtain  some   updated   information   about
people he  listed  as contacts. As alleged  in  SOR ¶  2.a,  he  responded,  “No,”  to  the  question
in Section  23  asking,  “While  Possessing  a  Security  Clearance  Have  you  EVER  illegally
used   or  otherwise  been   illegally   involved   with   a   drug   or  controlled   substance   while
possessing  a  security clearance  other than  previously listed?” (Emphasis in the  original.)
As described  above,  Applicant  had  previously listed  the 2013 marijuana  use  that  was,  at
the time he was filling  out this section of the  e-QIP, the only time he had used it. He also
expressed  his understanding  that this use  was not illegal, but he  disclosed  it to  provide
complete information. (Answer; GE 1; GE  2;  Tr. 25-26, 32-42.)
During January 2019, Applicant attended a party hosted by a friend of his wife. He
did not know any of the other people at the party. When a marijuana pipe was passed
around the group, he took one or two puffs on it to be sociable. This also occurred on a
weekend  evening  during  a  period  when  he  was  exclusively  assigned  to  unclassified
commercial projects at work. It did not occur to him in late February, when he completed
the contact information on his e-QIP and submitted it, that he needed to add this second
marijuana use to his answers in Section 23. During a security interview with a Government
investigator on May 28, 2019, Applicant volunteered the information concerning his 2019
marijuana use without being confronted about it. At no time did he intentionally conceal
or misrepresent his two incidents of drug involvement. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 25-26,
35-43.)
Applicant believes that decriminalization of some controlled substances represents
sound public policy, and that Federal laws prohibiting marijuana use may be changed to
mirror the legalization spreading through multiple state law changes. However, he has
only used the drug twice, his wife does not regularly use it, and he firmly expressed that
he has no desire or intention to use marijuana in the future. (GE 2; Tr. 26-27, 44-45.)
",True
"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted some of the allegations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a-1.c
and  2.b),  and  denied  other  allegations  (¶¶  2.c-2.d)  (He  failed  to  admit  or  deny  ¶  2.a,
which  is  a  cross-allegation  of  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  under  Guideline  E.  His  admissions  to  the
underlying  Guideline  H  allegations  will  also  be  recognized  as  an  admission  to  this
allegation). He also provided some explanation for his conduct. I adopt his admissions
as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 29 years old. He is single, never has married, and has no  children.
He  has  worked  as a  computer engineer  for his current  employer,  a  federal  contractor,
since September 2017. That contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions
of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. Applicant holds a bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 6, 20; GE 1-2)
The SOR alleged, under Guideline H, that Applicant used (from December 2012
to October 2019) and purchased marijuana (from December 2012 to April 2014). It also
alleged Applicant used marijuana after being granted a security clearance in 2017. I find
this  allegation,  SOR  ¶  1.b,  is  duplicative  with  SOR  ¶  1.a  because  it  alleges  the  same
conduct, i.e., use of marijuana. The SOR language stating that the use was “after being
granted  a  security  clearance”  does  not  equate  to  the  disqualifying  language  of  “while
granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position” and is therefore
superfluous. I find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR ¶ 1.b. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c)
Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged all the allegations listed above. (SOR
¶  2.a)  Additionally,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  provided  false
information  when  completing  his  September  2019  security  clearance  application,
specifically  relating  to  Section  23;  and  during  his  background  interview  with  an
investigator in November 2019, when he denied his marijuana use between December
2012 and October 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 2.b-2.d)
Applicant admitted his marijuana use  between February 2012 and April 2014  in
his  September  2017  SCA.  He  described  that  use  as  experimental  and  that  he  used
marijuana approximately once a week as a freshman in college. He also stated he had
no  intent  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future  because  he  “no  longer  enjoy  the  effects  of
marijuana.” He received his secret security clearance in approximately January 2018. In
2019, his employer requested that Applicant seek a top secret clearance. This required
the  completion  of  a  new  SCA.  Applicant  completed  this  SCA  in  September  2019.  (Tr.
20; GE 1-2)
In  his  2019  SCA,  under  Section  23,  Applicant  denied  using  any  illegal  drugs
within the past seven years and he also denied using drugs while possessing a security
clearance. He failed to list on this SCA his drug use from December 2012 to April 2014,
which he previously listed on his September 2017 SCA. These uses would fall within the
seven-year window about which the question asked. In November 2019, Applicant was
interviewed by a background investigator and was  asked the same two questions, i.e.,
whether he had any involvement with illegal drugs in the last seven years and if he had
any  involvement  with  illegal  drugs  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  Applicant
answered “no” to both questions. (GE 1-2 (section 23), GE 3 (p. 7-using bottom center
page numbers)
The  investigator  confronted  Applicant  with  his  admissions  from  his  2017  SCA.
After  being  confronted,  Applicant  admitted  to  his  earlier  marijuana  use  (2012  to  2014)
and expounded on more recent use. He described smoking marijuana in leaf form with
a  water  pipe  at  home  or  at  parties.  He  used  about  four  times  annually,  with  his  most
recent use in October 2019, which he claimed was also his last use. He claimed his last
purchase of marijuana was in April 2014. He also claimed that he did not associate with
anyone who uses drugs. He has not received any drug treatment or counseling.  (GE 3
(p. 7))
Applicant  admitted  his  marijuana  use  and  purchase  of  marijuana  in  his  SOR
answer.  He  also  admitted  intentionally  providing  false  information  on  his  2019  SCA
because he became aware that using drugs could disqualify him from holding a security
clearance. He admitted during his testimony that he provided false information because
he was concerned he might lose his job if he admitted to his marijuana use. (Tr. 20, 23)
Applicant offered the following explanation for his conduct. When he was hired in
2017 by his defense contractor employer he claimed to have stopped using marijuana
because  he  lived  in  a  state  where  it  was  illegal.  He  was  transferred  to  a  new  location
within  the  company  in  August  2019.  His  transfer  was  to  a  state  where  marijuana  use
and possession is legal under state law. He began using marijuana when he arrived in
the  new  state  because  he  claimed  he  was  unaware  that  use  of  marijuana  was  illegal
under  federal  law.  He  further  claimed  that  he  was  first  made  aware  of  the  federal
prohibition  when  his  background  investigator  stated  this  to  him  in  November  2019,
which  is  when  he  claims  he  stopped  using  marijuana.  He  also  claimed  he  could  not
remember  being  briefed  by  his  employer  that  marijuana  use  was  illegal  under  federal
law and prohibited by its employees. I find these claims not credible. (Tr. 22, 30)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c.  He  did  not
specifically admit or deny the same allegations that were cross-alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. His
admissions  are adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After a thorough  and careful review of  the
pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 51 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2000. He married in
2010 and has an adult stepson. He has been employed by his present employer, a federal
contractor,  since  2020  and  has  worked  for  different  federal  employers  since  2006.
(Transcript (Tr.) 20; GE 1)
In 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with trafficking marijuana, a felony.
He  was  attempting  to  sell  about  two  pounds  of  marijuana  when  arrested.  He  had
successfully sold about a pound of marijuana on one other occasion. His charge was later
reduced  to  possession  of  marijuana,  a  misdemeanor.  He  was  convicted  of  the  lesser
offense and sentenced to 12 months in jail. He served eight months and was released
early. (Tr. 24, 39-45)
After Applicant’s release from jail, he would purchase small amounts of marijuana
from friends for personal use, and he used marijuana with varying frequency from 1994
to 2001. He stopped using marijuana when he applied for a job  in 2001 that required a
security clearance. He said he did not receive the clearance. He testified he also stopped
using marijuana because he  wanted to pursue a  different path  for his life. He became
involved with his church and turned his life to God. In approximately 2006, he applied for
another job that required a security clearance. He was denied the clearance after going
through the adjudicative process, including a hearing with an administrative judge from
DOHA. In 2009, Applicant reapplied for a security clearance and it was granted in 2010.
All of his jobs since 2010 have required a security clearance. (Tr. 23-26, 45-52)
In  about  2011,  Applicant  and  his  wife  purchased  undeveloped  property  in  the
country  on  which  they  spent  years  clearing  brush  and  trees,  erecting  fences  and
renovating  buildings. Six years later, after his stepson  graduated  from  high  school,  he
and his wife moved to their tiny house, planted gardens, fruit trees, berry orchards, and
learned to care for livestock. Applicant was also in a position to invest more time into his
hobby of cycling that he pursues three to four times a week for two to three hours  at a
time.  Applicant  also  continued  to  work  hard  at  his  job.  In  2019,  after  years of  working
every day and every weekend, he and his wife planned a vacation.
Applicant and his wife planned their vacation for months. They intended to fly to
Colorado and rent a recreational vehicle and then drive to various locations where they
could hike and bike and enjoy the mountains. They purchased one-way tickets, as when
they completed their mountain trip, they intended to drive home. In order to leave their
farm, they required someone who was experienced in caring for animals. Their farm is
not for profit, but intended for a degree of self-sufficiency. They arranged for a person to
care  for  the  farm  animals  while  they  were  gone.  He  was  to  come  to  the  farm  the  day
before they were to leave for vacation so they could do a last-minute walk through. The
farm hand failed to show up the day before and could not be contacted. He had gotten
the days wrong. (Tr. 26-30; Answer to the SOR)
The  plane  tickets  were  non-refundable,  so  Applicant’s  wife  suggested  that
Applicant take the trip without her, rent a bike, and cycle through the Rockies. Applicant
already had approved leave. He did not want to go on vacation without his wife, but at her
insistence and to give him a much-needed vacation, he took the trip. (Tr. 26-30; Answer
to the SOR)
Applicant arrived in Colorado and checked out bike shops. There were numerous
cannabis shops. Use and possession of marijuana is legal in Colorado. He testified that
he was curious because there were cannabis stores everywhere and since it was legal in
the state, he went into one and on impulse purchased a small amount of marijuana. He
went back to his hotel room and used a small amount. About ten minutes later, he realized
his mistake and did not like the way the drug made him feel. He disposed of the marijuana,
called his wife, told her what he did, and said he wanted to come home immediately. He
did not want to vacation without his wife and felt guilty for his actions. He checked out of
the hotel at 4:00 a.m. the next morning and drove home. (Tr. 30-33, 52-53, 55; Answer to
the SOR)
Applicant credibly testified that this one-time use in 2019 was the only time since
2001 that he used marijuana or any illegal drug. His wife and his stepson are aware of
his use. In July 2020, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) as part
of his reinvestigation for his security clearance. In the SCA, he disclosed his one-time use
of marijuana in October 2019, while he held a security clearance. He indicated his intent
never to use it again because it jeopardized all that he had worked for. Applicant provided
a  signed  statement  swearing  that  he  does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  again  and
understands revocation of his security clearance would be immediate if he did. Applicant
credibly  testified  that  he  never  considered  lying  on  his  SCA  and  not  disclosing  his
marijuana use. He felt it was his duty and obligation to disclose the information. (Tr. 23,
34-36, 53, 58-59; GE 1; AE I)
In September 2020 Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He
disclosed his purchase of marijuana in Colorado while on vacation and his one-time use
before discarding the remaining marijuana. He told the investigator that he regretted his
actions and the risk was not worth jeopardizing his livelihood. He made a full disclosure
to the investigator. (GE 4)
Applicant testified and acknowledged his mistake. He said he was selfish. He is
remorseful for his actions. He testified that he understands he was given a second chance
when he was granted a security clearance in 2010. He did not like the way the marijuana
made him feel, and he does not intend to ever use marijuana again. In 2021, he decided
to abstain from alcohol to live a completely clean life. He eats healthy, rides his bike, and
devotes any extra time he has to his church. He credibly testified that after he got married
he gave his life to God. (Tr. 35-37, 56-57-58)
Applicant’s wife testified on his behalf. She confirmed that she and Applicant had
worked tirelessly on their farm, and they were looking forward to a second honeymoon
because they were unable to take a first one. When their farm hand failed to show up,
she had insisted Applicant go on the trip without her because he deserved a break. She
said that Applicant called her from Colorado after he used marijuana and was upset with
himself. She wanted him to put the incident behind him and enjoy the rest of the vacation,
but he wanted to come home. She testified he was angry with himself and remorseful.
She stated that he has a set of ethics that he lives by, and he is brutally honest. He is
devoted to his faith and it is an integral and cornerstone part of his life. She believes she
knows him better than anyone and acknowledges his past and that he has evolved. (Tr.
64-76)
Applicant’s  former  supervisor  testified  on  his  behalf.  She  has  known  him  since
2003 and supervised him for four to five years. He does excellent work and is honest to
a fault. She is aware of his marijuana use in 2019. She was somewhat aware that he had
issues in his background, but he had overcome them. She considers him trustworthy. She
acknowledged he used bad judgment when he used marijuana, but he was honest when
he disclosed it. She has no concerns about him holding a security clearance. (Tr. 76-83)
A coworker, who is retired from the military and has worked with Applicant since
2009, testified on his behalf. He noted that Applicant’s work was detailed and excellent.
He stated that Applicant is very honest, and he has integrity. He is aware of Applicant’s
2019 marijuana use and he did not have concerns with him having a security clearance.
(Tr. 84-89)
Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  an  award,  letters  of  appreciation,  certificates  of
excellence, letters of outstanding performance in support of a military program, certificate
of  excellence  for  exceptional  service  to  the  military,  and  a  chronological  list  of
accomplishments since August 2018. (AE A-H)

"In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admits  to  all  allegations  in  the  SOR  with
some explanations.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  who  seeks  a  security
clearance. He has held a security clearance since 2009. He has been employed with his
current  employer since  January 2021.  He was  employed by  other defense contractors
prior to this position. He earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in the  spring 2022. He married in
2011, but separated from his wife in 2013. They have a ten-year-old son who lives with
his wife. He has lived with a cohabitant since 2018. From 2009 to 2014, he served on
active duty in the United States Army. He was separated for medical reasons due to a
shoulder  injury.  (Gov  2,  Gov  3,  Tr.  19-26)  (Note:  The  facts  in  this  decision  do  not
specifically  describe  employment,  names  of  witnesses,  or  locations  in  order  to  protect
Applicant’s  and  his  family’s  privacy.  The  cited  sources  contain  more  specific
information.)
Drug  Involvement
Under the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana
from March 2018 to August 2018. (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 1 at 1; Gov 2 at 42)  In his response
to the SOR, he admits to using marijuana on a couple occasions. In response to Section
23,  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity,  on  his  January  21,  2020  security  clearance
application,  he  listed  using  marijuana  between  March  2018  and  August  2018,  on  10
occasions. He indicated he used marijuana for relaxation and pain.  During the hearing,
he testified that he used marijuana to help with pain in his shoulder. He injured his left
shoulder while in the Army. He was ultimately medically boarded and discharged from
the  U.S.  Army  as  a  result  of  this  injury.  He  stopped  using  marijuana  when  the
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  prescribed  him  a  long-term  pain  medication  that
was effective in controlling his pain. (Tr. 26-27; Gov 2 at 27)
Applicant  states  he  never  used  marijuana  before  this  time  and  has  not  used
marijuana since August 2018. He is aware that use of illegal drugs is not consistent with
holding a security clearance.  He provided the results of numerous drug tests taken on
May  14,  2019;  October  22,  2019;  February  3,  2020;  and  September  30,  2021,  which
indicate he tested negative for marijuana and other illicit substances. He tested positive
for his prescribed pain medication. He also provided a statement of intent to refrain from
illegal  drug  use  acknowledging  any  future  use  of  illegal  drugs  would  be  grounds  for
revoking his security clearance. (Tr. 12, 26; Gov 1 at 1, 5 - 21)
Personal Conduct
Under  the  personal  conduct  concern,  the  SOR  alleges  Applicant  deliberately
falsified  material  facts  on  a  security  clearance  application,  dated  April  23,  2019,  when
he answered “No” in response to “Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs and Drug Activity –
Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Controlled  Substances  – “In  the  last  seven  years,  have  you
illegally used any drugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance
includes  injecting,  snorting,  inhaling,  swallowing,  experimenting  with  or  otherwise
consuming  any drug  or controlled  substance.” Applicant failed  to  list his marijuana use
between March 2018 and August 2018.  (Tr. 28; Gov 3 at 41)
Applicant admits he failed to list his marijuana use on his 2019 security clearance
application,  but  it  was not  intentional.  He  said  it  did  not  cross  his mind.  He  completed
the 2019  security  clearance  in a hurry.  He  testified 2019  was not a  great  year for him
and he had a lot of other stuff on his mind. He honestly does not know why he did not
list his 2018 marijuana use on the 2019 security clearance application. He did not intend
to  provide  false  or  misleading  information.  (Tr.  28-30;  Gov  1  at  1)  About  nine  months
later,  he  was  asked  to  submit  a  security  clearance  application  for  a  top  secret
clearance.  He  completed  another  security  clearance  application  on  January  21,  2020.
Applicant listed his marijuana use on this application in response to Section 23. (Tr. 29;
Gov 2 at 42)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  irresponsibility.  The
SOR alleged 26 delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of $71,891. Three of
the  accounts  were  for  student  loans,  totaling  $25,697.  The  remaining  23  debts  were
consumer/credit card accounts, totaling approximately  $46,194. Applicant purchased a
house  in  2017.  He  started  to  purchase  furniture  and  other  items  for  his  house  and
became financially over-extended. (Tr. 16-18, 32, 52)
In  2019,  Applicant  entered  into  an  agreement  with  a  debt  company  to  help
resolve his accounts. The debt  company advised  Applicant to stop  paying towards his
debts.  They  wanted  the  debts  to  go  delinquent.  They  would  then  negotiate  settlement
agreements  for  their  clients.  Applicant  paid  the  debt  company  money  twice  a  month.
The  debt  company  was  to  use  the  money  for  negotiating  settlements  on  the  debts.
Applicant  did  not  realize  that  his  debts  would  default  if  he  did  not  make  payments
toward  the  accounts.  After  several  months,  he  did  not  think  the  debt  company  was
making  sufficient  progress  satisfying  his  debts.  He  quit  doing  business  with  the  debt
company  in  December 2019  and  began  to  resolve  the  accounts  on  his  own.  Some  of
the accounts were charged off and sent to collection. He said it was his mistake to enter
into  an  agreement  with  the  debt  company.  He  is  now  slowly  working  to  resolve  his
delinquent debts. He claims that he is not living outside his means. He was able to pay
all  of  his accounts  before  he  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  debt  company.  Over
the past year, he has been able to raise his credit score almost 100 points as a result of
working to get his debts in good standing. (Tr. 16-18, 32-34, 52; Gov 1 at 2-3)
After  the   hearing,  Applicant   consulted   with   a   counselor   from   a   non-profit
counseling service  (counseling service)  on December 20, 2022.  He is working with  them
to  create  a  budget,  and  a  plan  to  resolve  his  debts.  He  entered  into  a  debt  management
agreement  on   December   22,  2022.  The   counseling   service   was  able  to   locate   the
current creditors of the  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.b, 1.c,  1.g, 1.h  and  1.z.   These  debts
were  added   to   Applicant’s  payment  plan   which   is  to   last  for  a   period   of  40   months.
Applicant   agreed   to   pay   a   first  payment  of  $1,142   a   month   on   January   15,  2023,  and
subsequent   payments   of   $1,117   due   on   the   15th   of   each   month.   He  intends   to   make
payments   by   monthly   allotment   from   his  checking   account.   (AE   B   at  1-11)   It   appears
that all  of Applicant’s unresolved debts were  included  in the  counseling  service  payment
plan.
The status of the debts alleged in the SOR are as follows:
SOR  ¶   3.a:  $7,047  delinquent  student  loan  account  placed  for  collection.
Applicant  claims  this account was a mistake  on his  credit report.  He  disputed  it online

locate  the  current  creditor  and  the  debt  was  added  to  the  new  payment  agreement
Applicant has with the counseling service. (Tr. 14, 32-34; Gov 1 at 3; AE B at 2, 11)
SOR ¶  3.c: $4,107 charged-off credit card account. During the hearing, Applicant

paid this off. He now has a payment agreement to resolve this debt. He provided a copy
of the agreement and proof that he made a payment on November 30, 2021. He hopes
to  have  the  account  paid  off  in  March  2023.  (Tr.  14,  36-40;  Gov  1  at  3,  24-26)  This
account  is  likely  included  in  the  new  payment  agreement  Applicant  has  with  the
counseling service. (AE B at 11)
SOR ¶  3.f: $3,526 charged-off electronic retail store account. Applicant provided
proof that he paid off this account on September 9, 2021. (Tr. 14, 41; Gov 1 at 3, 27)
SOR ¶  3.g:  $690 charged-off outdoor retail store. During the hearing, Applicant
testified he was unable to find the current owner of the account and said he would pay
the  account  if  he  locates  them.  After  the  hearing,  the  counseling  service  was  able  to
locate  the  current  creditor  and  the  debt  was  added  to  the  new  payment  agreement
Applicant has with the counseling service. (Tr. 14, 41; Gov 1 at 3; AE B at 2,11)
SOR ¶  3.h: $5,276 charged-off big box retail store account. During the hearing,
Applicant testified he was unable to find the current owner of the account  and said he

able  to  locate  the  current  creditor  and  the  debt  was  added  to  the  new  payment
agreement Applicant has with the counseling service. (Tr. 14, 41; Gov 1 at 3; AE B at 2,
11)
SOR ¶  3.i: $5,141 account placed for collection.  Applicant claims the account is
in  good  standing  and  he  is  making  payments  on  this  account.  The  repayment
agreement  consists  of  Applicant  making  monthly  payments  of  $100.80  through
November  9,  2025.  Applicant  did  not  provide  proof  that  he  was  making  consistent
payments toward this account. (Tr. 15, 41-43; Gov 1 at 3, 28-29) This account is likely
included in the new payment agreement Applicant has with the counseling service. (AE
B at 11)

"Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  Labor  Relations  Staff  employee  with  a  defense
contractor.  She  has  worked  for  the  company  since  2000.  She  is  single.  Applicant  has
received  a  bachelor  of  arts  degree  and  a  master’s  degree.  She  is  seeking  to  retain  a
security  clearance granted in approximately 2006  in connection with  her work with the
DoD. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Applicant Exhibit E.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  she  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
Applicant admitted that she used marijuana less than ten times in the 1990s. That
use is not alleged in the SOR and is in the distant past. This use has no current security
significance. (Applicant Exhibit M; Tr. 101-102.)
Applicant stated that she was unintentionally exposed to marijuana in 2014 and
2015. She denies intentionally using it during the period of her employment. (Tr. 62-63.)
In  2014  she  attended  an  outdoor  concert  with  friends.  During  this  concert
neighboring attendees shared food such as brownies and cookies. Applicant ate several
of these items. After she consumed them one of the neighbors told her that the  baked
goods contained marijuana. Applicant testified that she did not know that before she ate
them, felt no affects from eating the food, and has no knowledge as to whether the person
was telling the truth. (Tr. 63-66, 107-108.)
The next time Applicant was exposed to marijuana was about a year later, in 2015,
while  on  vacation  with  several  other  people.  Some  of  these  people  were  friends  of
Applicant, others were friends of her friends. Several of them, including Applicant, used
vape pens. Applicant’s used tobacco in hers. On one occasion Applicant picked up the
wrong vape pen by accident. She took a puff and found that it had a strange flavor. She
enquired and was told by the owner, a friend of a friend, that it contained marijuana. Once
again, Applicant did not feel any affects, and has no knowledge as to whether the person
was telling the truth. (Tr. 66-71.)
Subsequent to these  two  incidents  Applicant is much more careful about taking
food from  strangers in concert-like  situations.  In addition,  she has stopped using  vape
pens altogether. (Tr. 66, 69, 71-73.)
Applicant has repeatedly stated that these were her last “uses” of marijuana and
that she has no intent of using marijuana in the future. Even though Applicant does not
believe  she  has  or  had  a  drug  problem,  she  has  taken  several  steps  to  assure  the
Government  that  she  is  being  proactive  in  preventing  a  future  problem.  Applicant  has
taken a course in drug and alcohol awareness, and also one in marijuana education. She
has taken several negative drug tests. (Applicant Exhibits J, L, N, and O; Tr. 72, 74.)
Applicant received an evaluation dated December 20, 2021, from a psychologist.
The  report  covered  the  area  of  drug  abuse.  (Applicant  Exhibit  M.)  He  conducted  a
thorough examination of Applicant that included an interview, various psychological tests,
and review of relevant documentation. The psychologist opined, “[Applicant] does not now
nor has she ever met criteria for a diagnosable substance-related  disorder.”  (Applicant
Exhibit M at 6; Tr. 102-106.)
Applicant has also submitted a signed statement of intent “not to use or be involved
with  illegal drugs in  the  future.” The  statement also declared that Applicant understood
that  such  involvement  “may  be  grounds  for  revocation  or  denial  of  national  security
eligibility.” (Applicant Exhibit K.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because she has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or
unreliability.  Applicant  admitted  both  the  allegations  under  this  paragraph  with
explanations.
2.a.   Applicant   filled   out  an   e-QIP   in  September   2015.  (Government   Exhibit  2.)
Section 23 of the  questionnaire  asked  Applicant about her drug  use  history. Specifically,
Applicant was asked  whether she   had  used  controlled  substances   during  the  previous
seven  years.  Applicant  stated,  “No.” This  was  an  incorrect  answer to  a  relevant question
about Applicant’s drug  use history.
Applicant stated that her reason for not disclosing the two incidents of marijuana
use in 2014 and 2015 was because she thought they were too minor and inconsequential
to  disclose.  She  specifically  stated  that  she  did  not  have  an  intent  to  deceive  the
Government about  this  accidental use,  that it  was simply a  mistake  on  her part.  (Tr. 75-
76, 89, 115-116.)
Applicant began working closely with Mr. C, an investigator for her employer, in
about 2013. Mr. C testified that he communicates with Applicant on almost a daily basis.
When Applicant began preparing to fill out her 2020 questionnaire, she asked Mr. C for
his advice in filling out the form. He advised her to not make her own decisions as to what
the Government felt was relevant or important. Rather, he advised her to be proactive in
telling the Government about incidents she did not think were important. (Tr. 24-36, 92.)
Applicant  filled  out  that  second  questionnaire  in  October  2020.  (Government
Exhibit 1.) In answering the same question in Section 23 about her drug use over the past
seven  years  Applicant  stated,  “Yes.”  This  was  based  on  the  advice  of  Mr.  C  to  be
completely  forthcoming  no  matter  how  minor  she  believed  the  information  to  be.  She
further indicated that the usage extended from 2014 to 2016, which was in error. Applicant
went on to explain, “While out at events (concerts, celebrations) I have smoked and eaten
edibles  that  contained  marijuana  that  I  did  not  know/  know  contained  marijuana.”  She
further stated, ”‘I’m estimating the times at less than 10 as I don’t know how many times
for an exact number.” Applicant stated that the number ten was used to include all of the
baked goods she ate at the 2014 concert, in an attempt to be completely forthcoming.
This was a more accurate statement of her use, though somewhat confusing. (Tr. 76-79,
89, 94-98.)
A Report of Investigation (ROI) was prepared by a government investigator based
on his notes from an interview with Applicant. The ROI stated, “From 1/14 to 1/16, Subject
[Applicant]  smoked  and  ate  marijuana  at  concerts,  parties,  someone’s  house,  and  at
camping  trips  for  a  total  of  10  times.”  Applicant  vehemently  disagreed  with  the
investigator’s version of the interview. (Government Exhibit 5; Tr. 80-88, 109-112.)
Based on the advice of Mr. C, Applicant also revealed a 1995 arrest for petty theft
under Section 22 of the same questionnaire. This arrest would not have been required
under the terms of the question, but Applicant put it down in an attempt to be completely
forthcoming.
Applicant stated that she has learned  to  “pay attention  to  what’s written  on  your
SF-86.” (Tr. 116-117.)
2.b.   The   Government  alleges in  this  subparagraph   that the  Applicant’s drug  use
history, as set forth  under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E.
Mitigation
A good friend of Applicant’s testified on her behalf. This person, Ms. M, is a Director
of  Human  Resources  for  a  division  of  Applicant’s  defense  employer.  The  witness  has
human resources responsibility for 8,000 personnel in her division. She has a Top-Secret
clearance  and  is  knowledgeable  about  security  responsibilities.  She  is  aware  of  the
allegations in this case. The witness has known Applicant since elementary school and
is the person who recruited Applicant for the company. The witness believes Applicant to
be  completely  honest,  trustworthy,  and  of  a  stellar  character.  The  witness  gave  the
Applicant her highest recommendation. (Tr. 37-58.)
The witness Mr. C also submitted a statement on Applicant’s behalf, in addition to
his  testimony.  He  has  known  Applicant  for  ten  years  in  a  professional  capacity  as  an
investigator. Mr., C was apprised of the allegations in this case.  He stated, “[Applicant]
has a solid understanding and appreciation for classified work activities at [her employer],
and  has  demonstrated  her  commitment  to  protecting  National  Security  through  her
positive work ethic and actions.” He also testified that she is honest with a high degree of
integrity. (Applicant Exhibit G at 10-12; Tr. 24-36.)
Additional letters of recommendation were submitted by coworkers and personal
friends. Each of them has known Applicant for over ten years. All of them have knowledge
of the allegations in this case. They all state that Applicant is trustworthy and believable.
They find her to be a hard-working person of integrity and recommend her for a position
of trust. (Applicant Exhibit G at pages 1-9, 13-15.)
Applicant  is  viewed  as  a  solid  performer  by  her  employer.  She  has  repeatedly
received recognition for her job performance. (Applicant Exhibits D, F, and P.)

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant had used marijuana from 2010
to  June  2020,  and  that  he  sold  marijuana  in  2014.  It  also  alleged  he  used  psilocybin
mushrooms from 2014 to  February 2020, and that he sold psilocybin mushrooms from
July 2017 to May 2019 (on two or three occasions, and no more than six ounces on each
occasion).  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.h,  and  1.j.)  It  also  alleges  he  used  LSD  (on  three
occasions)  from  2016  to  2017,  and  he  used  cocaine  (on  two  occasions)  in  November
2016  and  February  2019.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d.)  The  SOR  also  alleges  that  he  used
medications  not  prescribed  to  him,  such  as  Hydrocodone  (once)  in  July  2015,  and
Adderall (about ten times) from December 2013 to November 2015. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f.)
Also  alleged  is  that  in  April  2012,  he  was  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana  and
possession  of  paraphernalia.  (SOR  ¶  1.g.)  It  is  alleged  that  in  August  2016,  he  was
charged with felony possession of a controlled substance, and that he was convicted of
three  misdemeanors  –  possession  of  marijuana,  possession  of  paraphernalia,  and
ingestion  of  an  intoxicant other than alcohol.  (SOR  ¶ 1.i.) Applicant  admitted all of the
allegations, with detailed explanations in his Answer to the SOR. (Item 1; Item 2)
Applicant  stated  that  his  illegal  drug  use,  which  was  generally  sporadic  and
recreational, occurred mainly during his high school and college years. In his Answer, he
listed  that  he  is  remorseful  for  his  past  illegal  drug  use.  He  also  believed  a  significant
amount of time had passed since he last used any illegal drug, which was marijuana in
June 2020. He explained that he is more mature and has consistently demonstrated good
judgment in his career as a software engineer. He no longer associates with friends who
use illegal drugs. (Item 2)
Applicant  was  in  high  school  when  he  was  charged  in  2012  with  possession  of
marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He was not convicted of these charges.
He abstained from using marijuana for about two years after this incident. In August 2016,
Applicant, the driver of the car, and two other passengers were pulled over by the police
for speeding. All four occupants were arrested for possession of a controlled substance,
(hashish brownies), a felony, less than two ounces of marijuana, ingestion of intoxicant,
other than alcohol, and drug paraphernalia (bong and pipe with residue). Applicant was
22 years-old at the time of this arrest. He pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor offenses.
(Item 2 Exhibits D and E, Item 3, Item 4)
In  May  2021,  Applicant  participated  in  a  drug  abuse  evaluation  and  submitted
documentation with his Answer. The record showed that he started smoking marijuana at
age 16, and he progressed to daily use of marijuana from approximately age 17 to 18.
After his 2016 offense, he smoked marijuana about two or three times a year until June
2020. He used Adderall without a prescription on about ten occasions during college to
help him study. He took psilocybin mushrooms five to ten times, and LSD three times. He
ingested unprescribed Hydrocodone one time. The counselor found Applicant to be very
credible and noted  that  he  fit the criteria  for cannabis  use disorder,  mild, in remission.
Applicant is considered to be in a low-risk category. (Item 2 Exhibit E)
Applicant was completely candid about his illegal drug use and drug-related arrests
on his August 2020 SCA. He understands marijuana use is against federal law, and it is
unacceptable for individuals possessing DOD security clearances  to smoke marijuana,
even if the state law makes it legal to do so. He signed a letter of intent declaring that that
he had no intention of using any illegal drug in the future. (Item 2, Item 3)

Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The  SOR  alleges  that  the  Applicant  has  used  controlled  substances,  to  include
the misuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances
that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their
intended  purpose  and  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior  may  lead  to  physical  or  psychological
impairment  and  raise  questions  about  a  person’s  ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with
laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  under
this guideline.
1.a.   Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequencies  from  about  October  1992
through  at  least  October  2019.  He  stated  that  he  began  using  marijuana  in  his  early
teens  and  through  college.  After  college  he  continued  to  use  it,  but  not  as  often,
averaging  once  every  few  years.  In  2017,  he  used  it  to  treat  pain  for  a  chronic  back
condition, but it did not help.  He continued to use it about twice a month or so to help
him  sleep.  This  use  continued  up  until  October  2019.  Applicant  stated  that  his  most
recent use of marijuana he believed to be legal based on his state law and the Federal
non-enforcement  stance.  (Applicant’s  Exhibit  B.)  He  stated  that he  now  understands
that  this  was  not  correct.  He  stated  that  he  had  no  intention  to  do  anything  illegal  or
against Federal law.  (Tr. pp. 46-49, and Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
1,b,
In  March  2017,  Applicant  provided  a  1.75  million  dollar  loan  to  a  company  that
was  in  the  business  of  cultivating  marijuana.  He  states  that  he  has  done  about  45  of
those  real  estate  loans  over  the  past  10  to  15  years.  (Tr.  pp.  60-67,  and  Applicant’s
Answer to SOR.)
1.c.   A  few  months  later  in  July  2017,  he  made  another  loan  to  a  company  to  allow
them to build a marijuana greenhouse and cultivate marijuana.  The borrower ran out of
money,  could  no  longer  make  the  payments  on  the  greenhouse,  and  the  project

business.  This was not a real estate loan, but a convertible note.  It was a loan in the
beginning, with the option of converting into ownership of the company once it became
an  operating  company  cultivating  marijuana.  Applicant  was  unable  to  exercise  the
option,  which  would  have  given  him  10  percent  of  the  company,  had  it  become
successful.  (Tr. pp. 64-67, and Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
Applicant  states  that  he  has  no  intention  of  being  involved  in  the  marijuana
industry again, nor is he sensitive to having his past involvement be known by others or
vulnerable to coercion due to his past involvement.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D, and Answer
to SOR.)
Guideline  B  –  Foreign Influence
The SOR alleges that the Applicant has foreign contacts and interests, including
but  not  limited  to,  business,  financial,  and  property  interests,  that  are  of  a  national
security  concern  if  they  create  circumstances  in  which  the  individual  may  be
manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in
a  way  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to  pressure  or
coercion by any foreign interest.  Applicant admits allegations 2.b., and 2.c., and denies
allegation 2.a.
2.a.   Applicant’s  girlfriend   is  a   citizen   of  Colombia.     He   met  her   in  October  2014.
Since   2015,   she   has  resided   with   the   Applicant.     He   denies  that  she   is  an
undocumented   immigrant,   or  that  she   was   an   undocumented   immigrant  when   he   met
her.     Applicant   submitted   copies   of   her  work  permits  from   June   2016   to   June   2017.
(Applicant’s Exhibit  A.)   When  he  met her,  she  was working  to  obtain  her residency.  It
was  his   understanding   that   she   came   to   the   United   States   on   a   fiancée   visa.     The
relationship   failed   and   she   overstayed   her  visa.    He  states  that  she   was  granted   her
residency in 2020.  She  is now working  towards obtaining  her green  card.  (Tr. pp. 70-
71.)
2.b.   Applicant’s  girlfriend’s  brother  is  a  career  member  of  the  Colombian  Army.  He
recently  retired  as  a  Sergeant  Major.  (Tr.  p.  71.)  Applicant  stated  that  he  does  not
provide  any  financial  support  to  his  girlfriend’s  brother.  However,  he  does  pay  for
medical school tuition in Colombian for his girlfriend’s brother’s daughter.  She got into
medical  school  at  sixteen.  Applicant  offered  to  pay  for  her  tuition.  Medical  school
(university) in Colombia is six years.  Applicant pays the tuition with his credit card.  He
has already provided about $25,000 in tuition over the past two years.  (Tr. pp. 72-74.)
Applicant  stated  that  he  has  visited  Colombia  on  two  occasions,  and  his  most
recent visit was in March 2022.  During his visit he met  some of his girlfriend’s family.
Her mother passed away many years ago, and her father is not in the picture.  She has
eight siblings.  All but three of them live in Colombia.  Applicant is not sure if any of his
girlfriend’s siblings, other than her brother, are affiliated in any way with the Colombian
Government.  (Tr. pp. 76-77.)
2.c.   Since 2017, Applicant has provided multi-million dollar financial investments and
loans  to  some  foreign  national  business  partners.
(Tr.  pp.  79-83,  and  Applicant’s
Answer to the SOR.)  The following information provides some background:
After  graduating  from  college,  in  1998,  Applicant  started  a  business  that  sold
vitamins  and  supplements  on-line.  Over  the  years,  he  has  grown  the  company  to  be
very successful.  At its peak in 2014, the business was worth about 77 million dollars.
He states that his company is currently worth about 20 million dollars.  He continues to
own and operate the company.  (Tr. pp. 57-58.)
In 2015/2016, Applicant was introduced to his now partner who owned a defense
contracting company.  At that time, they began discussing partnership possibilities.  In
mid-2018, Applicant formally joined his partner and started their company working with
the  defense  industry.  Applicant  had  been  using  marijuana,  and  continued  using  it  up
until  October  2019,  when  he  completed  a  security  clearance  application.  Applicant  is
the  co-owner  of  a  company  that  does  contracting  with  the  Defense  Department.
Applicant  states  that  there  are  three  full-time  employees,  Applicant’s  partner  and  co-
owner,  who  is  also  the  Facility  Security  Officer,  and  two  aircraft  mechanics.  The
company  owns  10  aircraft,  and  leases  a  few  more.  Applicant  requires  a  security
clearance in order to perform his duties for the company.  He admits that he entered this
industry later in life, and that he did not always follow Federal law.  (Tr. pp. 46-50, and
Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit H.)
Over the years, Applicant has also made other financial investments which have
amplified his income.  Applicant has been in the business of providing first and second
trustee  loans  on  real  estate  investments.  He  explained  that  he  loans  money  to
investors and takes ownership of the deed of title as collateral.  On various occasions,
he  has  funded  multi-million  dollar  financial  investments  and  provided  loans  to  foreign
nationals  for  their  businesses.  He  explained  that  at  times  there  are  multiple  private
investors  in  a  deal,  sometimes  up  to  four,  and  he  does  not  know  if  they  are  foreign
nationals.  He  does  know  that  on  many  occasions,  owners  of  the  real  estate  have

concerned   as  to   who   he   is  giving   the   loan   to.    There   are  several   scenarios  in  which
Applicant may loan money to a  foreign  national.  Applicant is either loaning  money to  an
individual  to   purchase   the   real  property,  or  is  loaning   money  to   a   property  owner  to
allow them  to  renovate  or flip it.  However, he  does not vet these  people.  Typically, his
broker  finds  the   deal   for  him,  and   then   contacts  him   to   see   if  he   is  interested.
Applicant’s  only concern  about   the   deal is   the   value   of   the  property.   In   the  event that
the   loan   goes  unpaid,   he   gets  the   property,   and   the   property  must  be   worth   his  loan.
The  largest  loan  that  Applicant has funded  has been  2.5  million  dollars.   (Tr. pp.  60-67,
and  Applicant’s Exhibit H.)
Applicant  states  that  he  has  been  a  “pretty  active  investor.”  He  has  funded  at
least  45  secured  trust  deed  loans  through  a  licensed  broker  where  he  participates  as
the investor.  He has met only two of the borrowers since he started funding loans about
nine years ago.  Some of the borrowers are likely foreign citizens.  The loans are made
at  conservative  loan-to-value  ratios  and  a  deed  of  trust  is  recorded  with  the  county.
Applicant states that in the event of non-payment, a foreclosure process is initiated, and
the  property  liquidated  to  return  funds  to  the  lender,  eliminating  any  risk  of  them
withholding fund to exert leverage.  (Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
Applicant  owns 16  rental units,  which  generate  half  a  million  dollars per year  in
rent, about half of which is income.  He also owns half of a large industrial building in
another state  which  is used for his vitamin  company, but would  rent  for approximately
one million per year to a third party.  His assets  are on average, one third stocks, one
third  loans/cash,  and  one  third  real  estate  equity.  He  stated  that  his  total  assets  are
currently valued at about 30 million dollars.  His goal is to divest himself of the vitamin
company  within  a  year  and  concentrate  on  defense  contracting  and  passive
investments  (real  estate  ownership,  real  estate  lending,  and  publicly  traded  stocks).
(Applicant’s Exhibit H.)
In  assessing  the  heightened  risk  created  by  holding  a  security  clearance,  the
Applicant’s ties to a country are important.  Under the particular facts of this case, I have
taken  administrative  notice  of  the  information  provided  concerning  the  Country  of
Colombia.  Colombia is a constitutional, multi-party republic.  Colombia has endured a
decades-long  conflict  between  government  forces,  paramilitaries,  and  antigovernment
insurgent groups heavily funded by the drug trade, principally the Revolutionary Armed
Forces  of  Colombia  (FARC).  Recently,  there  has  been  a  significant  uptick  of  violent
incidents  targeting  Colombian  security  forces  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  The
Department of State has issued a level 3: Reconsider travel advisory for Colombia due
to crime, terrorism, and COVID 19, and to exercise increased caution due to civil unrest,
and  kidnapping.  Violent  crime,  such  as  homicide,  assault,  and  armed  robbery  is
widespread.  Organized criminal activities, such as  extortion, robbery, and kidnapping,
are common in some areas.  The Department of State has assessed Bogato, as being a
high  threat  location  and  Cartagena  as  being  a  medium  threat  location  for  terrorism
directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests.  There are significant human
rights  violations  including  unlawful  or  arbitrary  killings;  reports  of  torture  and  arbitrary
detention  by  government  security  forces  and  illegal  armed  groups;  rape  and  abuse  of
women  and  children,  as  well  as  unlawful recruitment  of  child  soldiers  by  illegal armed
groups,  criminalization  of  libel,  widespread  corruption;  violence  against  and  forced
displacement of Afro-Colombian and indigenous persons; violence against lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons; child labor; and killings and other violence
against trade unionists.  (H-1)
A letter of recommendation from his partner and co-owner of his company, who
also serves as the Facility Security Officer, considers Applicant to be extremely ethical,
trustworthy, hardworking, and an excellent business partner.  He believes that Applicant
is  transparent  with  him.  He  supported  Applicant’s  full  disclosure  of  the  all  of  the
information about his marijuana  use  and his prior investment  in a marijuana  business.
He  believes  that  Applicant  understands  that  he  will  be  held  to  the  highest  standards
while involved in classified work.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit G.)
A witness, who has a security clearance and military background, testified that he
has  known  the  Applicant  since  high  school  and  college.  He  has  also  worked  for  his
vitamin  company  by  providing  programming  services.  He  considers  Applicant  to  be
honest, trustworthy and responsible.  (Tr. pp. 20-26.)
Applicant submitted a Statement of Intent dated August 16, 2022.  He stated that
he has not been involved in any illegal drug use since the security clearance process.
He  further  stated  that  he  is  committed  to  abstaining  from  all  future  drug  involvement.
He  understands  that  any  future  drug  involvement  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  his
national security eligibility.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)

"Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has

additional  college  courses  without  earning  another  degree.  He  has  never  married  and
has no children. (Items 3, 5, 8)
From  about  2009  through  December  2014,  Applicant  used  marijuana  with
varying  frequency.  From  about  2011  until  about  2014,  he  purchased  marijuana  with
varying frequency. During this timeframe, he used marijuana socially with friends and to
help him sleep at night. In April 2015, he claimed that he had no intention to use illegal
drugs  in  the  future.  Notwithstanding  this  marijuana  usage,  Applicant  was  granted  a
security clearance in about June 2015. He did not use illegal drugs between 2014 and
September 2019. In about September 2019, while he held a security clearance, he used
the illegal stimulant “Molly,” or MDMA, on one occasion with friends before attending a
concert.  He  volunteered  his  illegal  drug  use  in  his  two  Questionnaires  for  National
Security Positions (SF 86), discussed it openly with the investigator during his security
interviews in 2015 and 2020, and self-reported the September 2019 illegal drug use to
his facility security officer (FSO). He has not used an illegal drug since September 2019.
He claimed that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He acknowledged
that he has made some poor choices related to illegal drug usage in the past, but that
he has learned from his mistakes. He claimed that he understands that illegal drug use
is not compatible with holding a security clearance. He claimed that he has “cut virtually
all contact” with the friends with whom he used illegal drugs in the past. His reporting of
derogatory  information  regarding  his  illegal  drug  use  enhances  his  credibility  with
respect to these claims. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6, 8; FORM Response)

reported this information on his SF 86. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR,
such as Applicant’s late filing of income tax returns for the 2018 tax year cannot be used
for disqualification purposes; however, it may be considered in assessing an applicant’s
credibility;  in  evaluating  an  applicant’s  evidence  of extenuation, mitigation,  or changed
circumstances;  in  considering  whether  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful
rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3
(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (Items 2-5, 8; FORM Response).
Applicant filed his late 2017 federal income tax return with the IRS in September
2020.  He  filed  his  late  2018  federal  income  tax  return  with  the  IRS  in  March  2021.In
February  2021,  he  made  an  arrangement  with  the  IRS  to  pay  his  delinquent  federal
taxes  for  the  2017  and  2018  tax  years.  He  had  already  made  two  payments  on  his
delinquent federal taxes for the 2017 tax year in September 2020 and January 2021. He
satisfied his delinquent federal taxes for the 2017 tax year in July 2021. He satisfied his
delinquent federal taxes for the 2018 tax year in June 2022. He claimed that he did not
file his federal income taxes for the 2017 and 2018 tax years for several reasons, to wit:
he  was unfamiliar  with the process; he unknowingly failed to withhold  sufficient  wages
and incurred a larger tax obligation than he could afford; he had always received a tax
refund  in  the  past;  and  he  did  not  have  enough  money  to  pay  his  federal  taxes  in
addition to his other financial responsibilities. He claimed that he timely filed and paid all
his  federal  income  tax  obligations  before  and  after  the  2017  and  2018  tax  years.  His
reporting  of  derogatory  information  regarding  his  drug  usage  and  federal  tax
deficiencies during the clearance process enhances the credibility of his claims. (Items

"Applicant admitted  all  allegations contained in  both  paragraphs of the  SOR.  (Item
1)  His  admissions are incorporated into  these  findings.
Applicant is 33 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2012. He has worked
as a digital design engineer for a defense contractor since August 2017. (Item 1)
Applicant has a history of using marijuana, beginning in March 2011 when he was
in  college  and  continuing,  with  varying  frequency,  into  September  2021  when  he
submitted  his  SCA  for  a  position  with  a  defense  contractor.  He  stated  that  he  used
marijuana “most days in a week during the evenings.” (Item 2 at 28) He said he used it
for arthritis because it helps alleviate his pain and relieves nausea, which he experiences
from cancer medications. (Id.)
Applicant  also  disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  in  February  2017,  he  was  previously
investigated for a “TS-SCI clearance without success.” (Item 2 at 31) At that time he was
employed by a defense contractor, who terminated him for his admitted use of marijuana
and inability to obtain a security clearance because of it. (Item 1) He stated that he used
marijuana from December 2011 to February 2012, while working as an intern for defense
contractor A and holding a security clearance. (Item 1)
During  a  December  2021  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  Applicant
stated  that  after  he  was  denied  a  security  clearance  in  February  2017,  and  he  was
terminated from his position with defense contractor B. He then stopped using marijuana
because he wanted to apply for a job with defense contractor C, and he knew he may
need to pass a drug test required for employment. In June or July 2017, he passed a drug
screening and began working for defense contractor C in August 2017. He subsequently
resumed using marijuana in spring of 2018. He uses marijuana in the evenings during the
week and on weekends. He primarily uses it for medicinal purposes but acknowledged
there  is  a  social  element  in  using  it.  He  said  he  was  unfamiliar  with  any  employment
requirements to report his marijuana use. (Item 3)
Applicant denied that any physician prescribed marijuana for him. He indicated that
marijuana  is  legal  in  his  home  state.  He  obtains  it  at  a  local  dispensary.  He  told  the
investigator that he would rather work on unclassified projects, than stop using marijuana.
He said his family and friends are aware of his marijuana use. (Item 3) There is no credible
evidence that he has participated in a substance abuse program or has any intention to
quit using marijuana.

"Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  she  has
worked  since  March  2021.  She  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  2003  and  has  taken
community  college courses  without earning a  degree. She has never  married and has
no children. (Items 3, 5, 8)
Beginning in about 2001,  Applicant had  upwards of  six knee surgeries  to repair
or  replace  menisci  and  her  anterior  cruciate  ligament  in  her  left  knee.  When  none  of
these  surgeries  proved  successful,  Applicant  had  knee  replacement  surgery  in  about
2011. Despite the knee replacement, she continued to experience pain in her knee. For
several  years,  she  was  legally  taking  the  prescription  opioid  Tramadol  with  a
prescription  for  pain  relief  related  to  her  knee.  However,  in  about  July  2014,  she  quit
before  she  was  fired  from  her  job  with  a  government  agency.  She  lost  her  insurance
and her  prescription for Tramadol lapsed.  She  was  still experiencing  pain  and thought
she  needed  the  Tramadol,  so  she  used  it  illegally,  without  the  requisite  prescription,
from  about  August  2014  until  about  February  2015.  She  claimed  that  she  still  had  a
valid prescription for the Tramadol and merely refilled her prescriptions more often than
her  doctor  authorized.  There  is  no  documentation  to  this  effect  in  the  record.
Regardless,  she  admitted  using  Tramadol  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  her  doctor’s
prescription. From about May 2015 until about the middle of November 2015, a medical
doctor again prescribed her Tramadol for pain relief. She claimed that she continued to
experience pain in her left knee until a surgical repair of a portion of her artificial knee in
about  September  2022.  However,  she  has  not  used  opioids  since  sometime  in  2016.
(Items 2-4; FORM Response)
While Applicant claimed that she did not use opioids for pain management, she
illegally used “medical”  marijuana edibles with varying frequency for pain management
from  about  October  2020  to  the  present.  She  thought  using  medical  marijuana  was  a
better  alternative  to  opioids  for  managing  her  pain.  In  April  2022,  she  obtained  a
certification from a family nurse practitioner for the use of cannabis products in State A
where she resides. She claimed she thought marijuana use was “legal” in State A until
she  had  her security  interview in  May  2021.  Despite  her understanding  of  marijuana’s
illegality,  she  continued  to  use  it  and  obtained  the  certificate  for  the  use  of  cannabis
products  after  her  security  interview.  She  claimed  that,  on  an  unspecified  date,  she
made  her  current  employer  aware  of  her  marijuana  use  and  decided  to  stop  using  it.
There is no evidence in the record to corroborate this claim. Conversely, she has also
claimed that she will stop using marijuana once she obtains a clearance, which implies
that she continues to use it. (Items 2, 3, 4; FORM Response)
From  about  December  2014  until  about  February  2015,  Applicant  fraudulently
obtained prescriptions for Tramadol. She also fraudulently obtained at least 150 doses
is  a  registered  nurse.  Applicant  knew
of  Tramadol.  She  obtained  these  prescriptions  and  dosages  by  calling  pharmacies
posing  as  an  acquaintance  who
the
acquaintance’s  “NPI”  number  and  used  it  during  her  phone  calls  with  pharmacies  to
mislead  the  pharmacies  into  believing  the  prescription  was  valid.  In  February  2015,  a
pharmacist suspected her prescription to be fraudulently obtained and called the police
while  Applicant  was  waiting  to  pick  up  her  refill.  A  police  officer  confronted  Applicant,
and she admitted the prescription fraud. She was arrested and charged with five counts
of prescription fraud, a class 6 felony. In May 2015, she entered into a plea agreement
whereby she pleaded guilty to all five felony counts. She was sentenced to two years of
probation,  was  ordered  to  attend  drug  counseling,  had  her  driver’s  license  suspended
for 30 months, and was ordered to pay fees. As part of her plea agreement, her guilty
plea  on  the  five  felony  counts  was  suspended  for  a  year  and  all  five  were  reduced  to
misdemeanors  when  she  completed  the  other  requirements  of  her plea  agreement  on
June 15, 2017. It is unclear whether she has continued to attend drug counseling after
June 2017. (Items 2-5; FORM Response)
From about 2007 until 2014, Applicant held a security clearance while she either
worked  as  a  contractor  for  a  government  agency  or  directly  for  the  same  government
agency.  In  about  December  2013,  she  failed  to  properly  escort  individuals  in  her
workspace  for  whom  she  was  responsible,  because  she  was  using  social  media.  Her
supervisor  revoked  her  access  to  the  information-technology  (IT)  system  that  allowed
her to access social media at work. Applicant wanted to continue to access social media
at work, so, in contravention of the government’s rules for accessing its IT systems, she
used another employee’s  (her mother’s) access  information to  access  the  government
IT system. Her mother told her that she should not use her mother’s access information,
but Applicant thought it was not a big deal. In about July 2014, the government agency
for whom she worked determined that she was inappropriately accessing its IT system
with  another  individual’s  access  information  and  gave  her  the  option  of  resigning  or
being fired. She resigned. She lost her security clearance because of this conduct and
blames her actions on a “severe error in judgment.” (Items 2-4; FORM Response)
To show her rehabilitation and worthiness to hold a security clearance, Applicant
cites to the years that have passed without using opioids, engaging in criminal conduct,
or  engaging  in  workplace  misconduct.  She  claimed  that  she  has  learned  from  her
mistakes  and  now  possesses  the  requisite  judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  to
hold a security clearance. She claimed that the level of trust that her current employer
places in her is evidence of this change. (Item 2; FORM Response)

AE G; Tr. at 17, 46, 47-48, 50-52, 120-121)
The  SOR  alleged  security  concerns  about  Applicant’s  marijuana  use  and
marijuana-related criminal charges under Guideline H, and then cross-alleged the same
concerns under Guideline  J.  In his Answer, Applicant  admitted,  in part,  and denied,  in
part, the Guideline H allegations. He did not respond to the Guideline J allegation in his
Answer, which I construed as a denial. Based on Applicant’s admissions, his testimony,
and the evidentiary record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  in  joint  form,  with  varying  frequency,  from  1990
through  2012.  He  consumed  marijuana  in  an  edible  form  one  time  in  2013  while
unemployed. He was criminally charged with possession of marijuana in 2008, 2009, May
2011, December 2011, and 2018. He was convicted of all but the 2008 charge. Applicant
proffered inconsistent information at various times during his testimony and throughout
the  security  clearance  process  concerning  the  facts  and  circumstances  underlying  his
marijuana use and the criminal charges. (GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6; Tr.)
2008  Charge
In September 2008, while driving home from a gun shooting range, a police officer
pulled  Applicant’s  vehicle  over  for  a  missing  license  plate.  After  smelling  marijuana
emanating from the vehicle, the police officer initiated a search of the vehicle. During the
search, the officer found a handgun under the passenger’s seat. The handgun, which was
registered to Applicant, was loaded. Applicant forgot to unload it and place it in the trunk
after leaving the range. The officer also found marijuana inside a bookbag located on the
back seat. Applicant was arrested and held in custody for three to four hours before being
released. (GE 1; GE 2 at 4, 13; GE 4; GE 5 at 3-4; GE 6)
Applicant was initially charged with (1) felony possession of marijuana with intent
to  distribute,  (2)  misdemeanor  possession  of  marijuana,  and  (3)  misdemeanor
transporting  a  handgun  in  a  vehicle.  At  some  point,  charge  (3)  was  amended  to
misdemeanor  transporting,  wearing,  or  carrying  a  handgun.  Charge  (1)  was  nolle
prosequi  in  October  2008.  In  March  2009,  charge  (2)  was  nolle  prosequi  and  he  was
found guilty of charge (3), as amended. In October 2009, he was sentenced to serve an
unspecified  number  of  days  in  jail  over  five  consecutive  weekends  and  supervised
probation  for  one  year.  Applicant  asserted  that  his  sentence  was  shortened  to  three
weekends and that his probation was also shortened by about six months. (AE A at 1-3;
AE B; GE 2 at 4, 13; GE 3; GE 5 at 4; Answer; Tr. at 56, 59, 122)
In  his  2011  eQIP,  Applicant  stated,  “I  have  learned  my  lesson,”  in  response  to
questions about this offense. In his 2017 and 2019 eQIPs, he repeated:
I  was  young   and   immature.   This  was  a   mistake   and   I   have   learned   my
lesson.  I recognize  my failures and  shortcoming’s [sic].  This does  not define
who   I  am   as  a   person   or  professional.  I  have   goals  and   want   to   be
successful.  (GE 1, 4, 6)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  asserted  that  the  marijuana  found  in  his  vehicle  “was
somebody’s else’s.” He also maintained that he had not used marijuana on the day he
was arrested. (Tr. at 151)
2009 Charge
In March 2009, while Applicant was driving home from work, a police officer pulled
his vehicle over for an inoperable taillight. After smelling the odor of marijuana emanating
from the vehicle, the officer initiated a search of the vehicle. During the search, the officer
found  what  Applicant  described  as  a  marijuana  joint  in  the  ashtray.  Applicant  was  not
arrested, but he was issued a summons to appear in court. (GE 1, GE 2 at 4; GE 4; GE
5 at 4; GE 6)
Applicant was charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. A court record
indicates that he pled guilty at a July 1, 2009 court appearance, during which he received
a  deferred  disposition  to  July  6,  2010,  pending  his  completion  of  a  drug  treatment
program,  100 hours of community  service, and  payment of  a $250 fine.  He  voluntarily
performed  an  additional  seven  hours  of  community  service  for  a  total  of  107  hours  in
January 2010. He completed the drug program in February 2010. (GE 3; Answer; AE A
at 5-6, 13-14; AE B)
Applicant  described  the  drug  program  as  an  outpatient  class  where  he  was
subjected to urinalysis testing. He attended group classes once or twice per week where
he was educated about drugs and the pitfalls of drug use. He completed the program in
a manner sufficient to satisfy his obligation to the court. Although he did not stop using
marijuana  immediately following his completion  from the program, he  asserted that he
began  having  better  judgment  and  becoming  more  reliable  based  on  what  he  learned
from the program. About two to three months later, he stopped using marijuana because
he wanted to better his life. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 65)
In his 2011 eQIP, Applicant stated, “I was immature and having fun, I have learned
my lesson,” in response to questions about this offense. In his 2017 and 2019 eQIPs, he
repeated,  “I  am  drug  free  and  more  mature.”  At  the  hearing,  he  asserted  that  the
marijuana belonged to a “coworker of mine.” (Tr. at 151; GE 1, 4, 6) He also maintained
that he had not used marijuana on the day he was arrested. (Tr. at 66).
May 2011 Charge
In May 2011, Applicant smoked marijuana, in an amount he described as half a
joint, while sitting alone and listening to the radio inside his parked vehicle in a park. At
some  point,  he  fell  asleep  and  was  awakened  by  park  police  officers  pulling  on  his
vehicle’s door handles. In response, Applicant rolled down the window of his vehicle to
speak with the officers. After observing Applicant put something in his mouth believed to
be  drugs,  one  of  the  officers  tried  to  open  Applicant’s  mouth.  In  response,  he  bit  the
officer’s finger. He was arrested and held in custody for two to three hours before being
released. (GE 1; GE 2 at 3, 12-13; GE 4; GE 5 at 3; GE 6; Tr. at 68, 69)
Applicant  was  charged  with  (1)  misdemeanor  assault  on  a  police  officer,  (2)
misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and (3) misdemeanor possession of marijuana
paraphernalia. In July 2011, he pled guilty to charge (2) for which he was sentenced to
serve  one  day  in  jail  and  fined  $50.  The  disposition  of  charges  (1)  and  (3)  was  not
indicated in the documentary evidence. However, he asserted that the officer agreed to
drop  charge  (1)  on  the  basis  that  there  had  been  a  miscommunication  and
misunderstanding of his rights. During a January 2018 security clearance interview (SI),
Applicant  admitted  that  the  officers  found  marijuana  in  the  vehicle.  However,  during
subsequent SIs in March and October 2019 and in his Answer, he maintained that the
officers did not find any marijuana. Applicant did not address charge (3). (GE 1, GE 2 at
3, 13; GE 3, 4; GE 5 at 3; GE 6; Answer; AE A at 7; Tr. at 72; AE B)
Applicant  asserted   that  he   served   his  sentence   by  spending   a   few  hours  in  a
holding  cell  on  the  day  of his conviction. (GE 2  at 3; Tr. at 69) He maintained  that he  did
not  bite  the  officer’s finger on  purpose.  (Tr. at  69) In  his 2011  eQIP,  Applicant  stated, “This
lifestyle  is behind  me  and  I have  grown up,” in  response  to questions about this offense.
In his 2017 and  2019 eQIPs, repeated:
I have  been  drug  free  for 5  years  and  much  more mature;  I understand  and
learned   from   my   failures,   shortcomings,  and   bad   experiences.  This
occurrence  does not define  who  I am  as a  person  or professional. (GE  1,  4,
6)
At  the  hearing,  after initially  denying  that  he  smoked  marijuana  the  day  he  was
arrested, Applicant admitted that he had, in fact, smoked marijuana that day. However,
he  denied  that  he  was  either  smoking  marijuana  or  in  possession  of  marijuana  in  the
vehicle at the time of his arrest. He explained:
Okay, so  they never caught me  with  possession  of marijuana, but then  when
I went  to  the  holding  cell, they  asked  me  to  make  a  statement,  and  basically
I made  this statement, you  know, saying  that I  had  marijuana, and  they said
if I made  that  statement,  that they was [sic] going  to  make  everything  go
away or they  was [sic] going  to  drop all  charges.  So, the  only reason  why I
agreed  to  possession  of marijuana, because they said they  was [sic] going
to  drop  the  assault charges and  the  possession  of marijuana  charges.  (Tr.
at 70, 73, 77, 94-95, 153)
Later during his testimony, Applicant claimed that the police report indicating that
the smell of marijuana was emanating from Applicant’s person was incorrect because,
contrary  to  his  previous  admission  during  an  October  2019  SI,  he  had  not  smoked
marijuana in the vehicle. In response to a question about where he smoked the marijuana,
he asserted “[i]t was after work so after work outside.” He denied that a marijuana smell
was emanating from his person by the time the officers approached him because he had
smoked the marijuana “probably like three hours, four hours” prior. (Tr. at 84, 153-155;
GE 2 at 3)
December 2011 Charge
In December 2011, a police officer pulled Applicant’s vehicle over after observing
him make an illegal U-turn at a red light. Due to smelling the odor of marijuana emanating
from the vehicle, the officer initiated a search of the vehicle. Applicant was arrested after
the officer found a small bag of marijuana in the vehicle, in an amount Applicant described
as equivalent to a joint. (GE 2 at 3-4, 12; GE 5 at 4; Tr. at 77)
Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  possession  of  marijuana.  In  October
2012, he pled guilty, was sentenced to one day in jail, six months unsupervised probation,
and fined $45. (AE A at 4; AE B; Tr. at 74)
In his 2017 eQIP, in response to questions about this offense, Applicant stated:
I paid a  court fine  for this charge  and  case  is  close  [sic].  I have  been  drug
free  for 5  years and  much more mature. I have  learned  my  lesson from my
failures and  shortcomings. This was my last  and  final charge. That part of
my life  is behind  me  and  doesn’t exist, I have  moved  on  and  have  goals to
be successful.  (GE 3, 4)
In his 2019 eQIP, he stated:
I paid a  court fine  for this charge  and  case  is  close  [sic].  I have  been  drug
free  for 5  years and  much more mature. I have  learned  my  lesson from my
failures  and   shortcomings.  That  part  of  my  life   is  behind   me   and   doesn’t
exist, I have moved on and have goals to be  successful. (GE 1)
At the hearing, Applicant asserted that the marijuana found in his vehicle did not
belong  to  him,  and  he  denied  that  he  smoked  marijuana  that  day.  He  attributed  the
officer’s  smell  of  marijuana  to  odor  emanating  from  the  bag  of  marijuana  found  in  the
vehicle. When asked to whom the marijuana belonged, he answered “I mean, I don’t recall
who  was  the  person.”  Then,  he  explained  that  he  had  occasionally  given  rides  to  a
coworker “like once  a  week or once  every  two weeks.” He  believed  that the  marijuana
may have belonged to his coworker. When asked for the coworker’s name, he replied, “I
don’t recall or remember.” He later stated that the marijuana belonged to his cousin. He
maintained  that  he  told  his  lawyer,  but  not  the  arresting  officer  or  the  court,  that  the
marijuana did not belong to him. He stated that arresting officer did not ask whether the
marijuana belonged to him. (Tr. at 77, 80-81, 94, 156)
2018 Charge
In April 2018, while on a routine patrol, a police officer observed Applicant driving
without wearing his seatbelt. When the officer pulled  his vehicle over for a traffic stop,
Applicant immediately jumped out of the vehicle and began to reach back into the vehicle
out of the officer’s line of sight. The officer then ordered Applicant to step away from the
vehicle and to take his hands out of his pockets. During a pat down, the officer detected
a  strong odor of marijuana  emanating from Applicant’s person, at which time Applicant
admitted to the officer that he had just smoked marijuana. The officer also detected the
odor of burnt marijuana emanating from inside the vehicle. During a search of the vehicle,
the officer located a grocery bag inside an open backpack containing a clear Ziplock bag
of  marijuana.  Also  located  inside  the  backpack  was  a  small  container  of  marijuana,  a
digital scale, $113 in cash, and two empty clear plastic baggies. The marijuana had a total
weight  of  22.1  grams  and  a  street  value  of  $440.  Because  the  officer  deemed  the
presence  of  these  items  to  be  indicators  of  possession  of  marijuana  with  the  intent  to
distribute it, he arrested Applicant and transported him to be charged. (GE 7)
Applicant was charged with (1) misdemeanor possession of 10 or more grams of
marijuana and (2) felony possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Charge (2) was
nolle prosequi in May 2018. In October 2018, Applicant pled nolo contendere to charge
(1). He was sentenced to one day in jail, with a credit of one day, and fined $45. (GE 3;
AE A at 8-12; Tr. at 88-89)
During an October 2019 SI, Applicant explained that he had been driving alone in
his vehicle on his way home from work. He asserted that the backpack, which was located
on  the  back  seat  of  the  vehicle,  belonged  to  a  coworker.  He  also  asserted  that  the
coworker had been in the vehicle prior to Applicant’s encounter with the police because
Applicant had given the coworker a ride from work to a bus stop. (GE 2 at 12; Answer)
At the hearing, Applicant reiterated that the backpack did not belong to him. He
maintained that he was wearing his seatbelt at the time he was pulled over. He denied
that, when he exited the vehicle, he either tried to retrieve something from the vehicle or
reach back into  the vehicle. He acknowledged  that he  “jumped  out of the  vehicle,” but
maintained that he only retrieved his identification from his person, not from inside of the
vehicle. He also denied that he smelled of marijuana at the time of his arrest or that he
had  smoked  marijuana  that  day.  He  opined  that  perhaps  the  officer  was  smelling  the
marijuana emanating from the backpack. He did not recall telling the officer that he had
just  smoked  marijuana.  He  asserted  that  the  police  report  was  incorrect  as  to  the
controverted facts. (Tr. at 83-85, 97, 136-137)
Applicant testified  that the  backpack belonged  to  a  coworker who  accidentally left
it in the vehicle after Applicant dropped  off the coworker “earlier that day, from work.” He
estimated  that  he  dropped  the  coworker off  at about  4:00  p.m.  or 5:00  p.m. and  that  he
was pulled  over at about 6:00  p.m.  or 7:00  p.m. He  maintained  that  he  did not  know the
backpack was  in the  vehicle  until it  was discovered  by the  officer. When  asked  for  the
coworker’s name, he  stated  “First name  was  [Person  A].  I  don’t remember  his last name.”
He  gave   Person   A   rides  “probably  once   a   month,  but   it  was  like   one   of  those   special
occasions, it doesn’t happen  regularly.” He asserted  that he  no  longer maintains contact
with Person A. (Tr. at 85-86, 157)
Later  during  the  hearing,  Applicant  disclosed  that,  at  some  point,  during  his
interaction  with  the  officer  outside  of  the  vehicle,  the  officer  told  him  that  he  smelled
marijuana emanating from the vehicle. Applicant explained that he “opened up the car”
after the officer warned that if he did not do so, he was “going to break the car window.”
He also explained that he worked with Person A daily for about six months, had given him
rides about once a month from their worksite to a transit station, and had observed him
smoke marijuana at their worksite prior to starting work “a couple of times.” Later in his
testimony, he admitted that he observed him “about once a week”. (Tr. at 134-135, 136,
139-141)
During his April 2019 and October 2019 SIs, Applicant acknowledged that he had
not disclosed his criminal charges to anyone besides his lawyer because he did not want
to  stress  anybody.  However,  he  asserted  that  he  felt  that  he  could  not  be  coerced  or
blackmailed. He maintained that he had not had any involvement with drugs since 2013
or with law enforcement since 2018. (GE 2 at 9, 13)
Marijuana Use, Frequency, and Future Intent
In his 2011 eQIP, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana while possessing a
security  clearance.  He  described  the  nature  and  frequency  of  his  marijuana  use  as
“[s]tress, special occasions, twice a month.” He explained:
I was raised  in  a  house  were  [sic] marijuana   was used.   I didn’t  know any
better  as  a   kid.  I  have   matured   and   learn   [sic]  the   long   term   effects  of
marijuana use.
He professed his intent not to use marijuana in the future and declared:
I  want  to   be   successful  in  life   and   marijuana   would  hender  [sic]   me   in
accomplishing   my  goals.  The   long   term   effects  of   marijuana   causes   [sic]
health  problems  and  I can’t accomplish  my goals if I’m  not healthy  or living.
(GE 6)
In his 2017 eQIP, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana while possessing a
security  clearance.  He  described  the  nature  and  frequency  of  his  marijuana  use  as
“[r]elieving stress, smoked once every six months.” He explained:
I was raised  in  a  house  were  [sic] marijuana   was used.   I didn’t  know any
better as a  kid. I have  matured  and  have  goals that I  want to  accomplish. I
want to be successful, provide for myself, and take care of my family.
He professed his intent not to use marijuana in the future and asserted:
I want to  be  successful. I have  goals  and  plans that  I  need  to  accomplish
and  marijuana would not help [me]  accomplish those  goals.
Again,  I want to  be  successful and  there  is no  success in doing  drugs or
[sic] under the  influence. I have  learned  my  lesson  from  prior experience
and   wrong   doings.  I’m   ready  for  a   positive   change   in  my  life   and   for  my
family. I  have  been  drug  free  for 5  years and  much  more mature to  know,
right from wrong; and  understand the outcome  regarding  drug  use.
During his 2018 SI, Applicant reiterated his intent not to use marijuana in the future. (GE
4; GE 5 at 4)
In his 2019 eQIP, Applicant admitted that he smoked marijuana while possessing
a  security  clearance  but  denied  that  he  possessed  a  clearance  when  he  consumed
marijuana in edible form in 2013. He described the nature and frequency of his marijuana
use as “[r]elieving stress, smoked once every six months.” He asserted that he consumed
the edible  only one  time  on  a  “special occasion.”  He professed his intent not to smoke
marijuana in the future and repeated verbatim the reasons he provided in his 2017 eQIP.
He  also  professed  his  intent  not  to  consume  marijuana  in  edible  form.  At  the  hearing,
Applicant stated that he obtained the edible from an individual he described as “a friend,
or  an  acquaintance  .  .  .  associate.”  When  asked  to  provide  the  individual’s  name,  he
stated,  “I  just  know him  on  the  street  as  [Person  B].” He  explained  that  Person  B  was
“actually cooking edibles, or making edibles.” He maintained that he no longer maintains
contact with Person B. (GE 4; Tr. at 98, 99-100)
During his March 2019 SI, Applicant characterized his marijuana use as occasional
and estimated the frequency of his use to be around once a year. He stated, generally,
that he whenever he was in possession of marijuana, the quantity was one joint maximum
or  about  four  grams  total.  He  also  stated  that  he  was  always  alone  when  he  used
marijuana and during each occasion that he was involved with law enforcement. He could
not  recall  how  he  obtained  the  marijuana  that  he  used.  He  asserted  that  he  was  not
dependent  on  marijuana.  He  disclosed  that  he  had  been  expelled  for  possession  of
marijuana  during  his  10th  grade  of  high  school.  He  was  able  to  return  to  school  and
earned his high school diploma as indicated above. He reported that, while unemployed
in 2013, he tested positive for marijuana use during a preemployment drug test and was
not hired by that employer. (GE 2 at 1, 3-5)
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  characterized  the  frequency  of  his marijuana  use  as  “I
may  have  consumed marijuana  2  times out of  a  year between 1990  and  2012  when I
didn’t have a clearance or [sic] employed with a government agency.” He reiterated that
drug use is incompatible with his personal and professional goals and that he learned his
lesson from “prior experience and wrong doings.” He asserted:
I have  changed  my  life  for myself and  my family. I have  been  drug  free  for
9  years and much more  mature  to  know, right  from  wrong; and  understand
the  negative  outcome regarding drug use.
At the hearing, Applicant admitted that, whenever he smoked marijuana, he did so
either by himself or, at times, with his uncle, a frequent marijuana user.  He maintained
that  he  never  exchanged  money  for  any  of  the  marijuana  he  used  because  his  uncle
supplied it to him. His uncle passed away from cancer in 2015. He attributed his uncle’s
passing with helping inform his evolved understanding of the dangers that marijuana use
posed to his health and professional goals. In response to a question about the frequency
of Applicant’s marijuana use, he stated “It probably was like once a year.” When asked to
explain the discrepancy between the twice a year he estimated in his Answer, he stated:
Because  I don't think it was  consecutively, it's not consecutively every year.
I mean  maybe  it was like, you  know, one  year I probably did it  twice.  Another
year I  probably did  it once.  So  it wasn't a  pattern as  you  could say  .  .  . I  may
have  did [sic] it one time in one  year, and two times in another year  . . . .
He also testified, “And so I may have partaked [sic], you know, a couple of times or I may
have partaked [sic] once a year or so like I said before on special occasions.”
(Tr. at 89-91, 99, 102-103, 130-131, 149, 150-151)
When  questioned  more  specifically  about  his  use  of  marijuana  in  2009,  2011,
2017, and 2018, Applicant testified that he had not smoked at all in 2009, including on
the day he was arrested in March, and that he only used marijuana one time in 2011, the
day he was arrested in May 2011. He denied using marijuana at any other time in 2011,
including the day he was arrested in December 2011. He denied using marijuana at all in
either 2017 or 2018. He asserted that his last consumption of marijuana was the edible
he ate in 2013. (Tr. at 66, 79, 82, 94-95, 97, 99, 100)
Applicant  had  the  following  exchange  with  Department  Counsel  (DC)  about  his
marijuana use while in possession of a security clearance,
DC: Now, in your responses, sir, you also stated you didn't consume any
marijuana when you had a clearance, right?
Applicant: Correct.
DC: You stated that you had a clearance between 2008 and 2011?
Applicant: Correct, 2008 to, hold on, say that again?
DC: You had a clearance between 2008 and 2011?
Applicant: Okay, yes.
DC: Right? And, you've admitted to smoking during that time period, as well.
Right? You indicated in your SOR response I admit, when you were asked
about smoking between 1990 and 2011? I mean 2012, sorry.
Applicant: So, your question again is?
DC: Sure. So you had a clearance between 2008 and 2011, right?
Applicant: Correct, correct.
DC: All right, and you've stated in your SOR response, you never smoked
or used marijuana while you held a clearance?
Applicant: I did, yes.
DC:  Okay.  And,  but  you've  also  admitted  to  smoking  between  1990  and
December 2012?
Applicant: Correct, correct.
DC: So you did smoke when you, while you held an active clearance?
Applicant: I may have, yes, I may, yes, I did probably once. (Tr. at 100-101)
During  his testimony, Applicant reiterated  that he  had  no  intent to  use  marijuana
or other drugs  in  the  future. He  denied  that he  continued  to  associate  with  any individuals
who  use  marijuana  or other drugs. When  asked   about the  last  time  he  associated  with
such  individuals, he  responded.  “Probably like  2014  or ’15, when  my uncle was  alive.” He
asserted  that  he  had  not given   a   ride  in  his   vehicle   to   “people,   coworkers, [or]   friends”
since  2018. He acknowledged  that he  still  encounters individuals who  use  marijuana  and
other drugs  in his “environment,” but   asserted  that he   is able to  distance   himself when
marijuana or other drugs are being used  around him. (Tr. at 102-103, 114)
When asked to explain how this time would be different than his previous promises
to steer clear of marijuana use and involvement with law enforcement, Applicant testified
that  he  intended  to  “be  more  selfish”  and  avoid  environments  and  persons  involving
drugs. He stated that he had no intent to give rides in his vehicle to anyone in the future.
He understood that drug use is incompatible with maintaining a security clearance. (Tr.
at 102, 145-147, 167)
10
Applicant testified that he reported his criminal charges to “most employers I did
let them know, yes.” He maintained that he never suffered any negative consequences
with his employment or lost his clearance due to his criminal charges. He acknowledged
that his employers provided him with security clearance training, including informing him
“not to partake any criminal or illegal activities.” However, he also asserted:
I wasn't  really instructed  how to  conduct myself.  Well, like  you  said, I  thought
the  clearance  mainly had  to  do  with  the  job. So  I didn't think it had  to  do  with
your outside  life, normal life, after work. So that was ignorance  on my part,
not   taking   the   clearance   into   consideration  of on   [sic]  the   job   and   how   to
conduct  yourself,  you   know,  when   you're   not  working.  But  I'm   more
knowledgeable now. And  I understand, you  know, how to  conduct myself,
you  know, either on  the  job  or off the  job  and  period  just  having  a  clearance.
So  I understand  the  severity of having  a  clearance,  yes.  (Tr. at 95, 158-159)
Whole Person
Applicant  has  resided  with  his  grandmother  all  his  life.  When  his  grandfather
passed away “in 2012 or 2009,” he became her primary caregiver. He took time off from
work to take care of her when she was sick. His mother passed away when he was five
years  old.  He  has  never  met  his  father  and  does  not  know  whether  he  is  living  or
deceased. He was raised in a hostile environment where marijuana was frequently used
and where he did not have access to positive role models. He explained, “So, of course,
I didn't see any negative aspects of it because everybody was functional.” Eventually, he
realized that he had to separate himself from that environment if he wanted to get ahead
in life, which led him to seek a “good job,” and get a clearance. (Answer; GE 5 at 1; GE 1
at 17-19, 27; Tr. at 129-133, 149).
Applicant  volunteered  for  a  Hurricane  Katrina  relief  project  from  2006  through
2008. He has volunteered for a Christmas in April program. Since 2010, he has regularly
volunteered  to  take  on  projects  for  his  church.  An  individual  from  the  program  where
Applicant  performed  the  community  service  hours  in  connection  with  his  March  2009
charge  wrote  a  letter  on  his  behalf  lauding  Applicant’s  exceptional  character  and
performance as a volunteer. The individual also stated, “I believe that this experience will
have an endless impression on [Applicant] and will teach him to follow the correct path.”
(AE G; AE A at 15)
Applicant proffered documents showing the various accolades he received about
his  exemplary  work  performance.  He  also  provided,  two  letters,  both  from  September
2022, from individuals who  praised his character and work performance. One of those
references, a friend and former coworker, stated, “I have never witnessed [Applicant] with
drugs or associated with any criminal activity.” Applicant acknowledged that none of his
references knew about his criminal arrests and convictions or his marijuana use. At some
point, he received a five-year service award for delivering outstanding customer service
while employed by a defense contractor for whom he was employed between 2002 and
2011. (AE D, F, G, H; Tr. at 103)
11
Applicant’s next-door neighbor testified on Applicant’s behalf at the hearing. The
neighbor considers him  to  be  “like  a  son.” The  neighbor has  known  him  since at least
2012, having met through Applicant’s grandmother. He and the neighbor interact “close
to every day.” The neighbor has observed him taking care of his grandmother and their
home. The witness stated, “He helps her out a lot.”
I've   never   known  him   to   do   anything   wrong   or  hang   out  with   the   wrong
characters  out  there.  Every  time   I  seen   [sic]  him   he's   working.  He   helps
everybody in the  neighborhood. I  think -- I think a  lot  of him. And  I think he'd
be   pretty  good   with   whatever  he   do   [sic]  in   life.  He  doesn't  do   anything
wrong that I know of or ever seen  him  do.  (Tr. at 7-14)
The  neighbor  had  not  been  aware  of  Applicant’s  history  of  marijuana  use  or  criminal
charges  prior  to  the  Government  presenting  him  with  that  information  upon  cross-
examination.  After  being  presented  by  that  information,  the  neighbor  reiterated  his
support for Applicant.  (Tr. at 7-14)
At the end of the hearing, Applicant asserted that each occasion of his involvement
with law enforcement resulted from profiling. He explained, “I mean, all the times I got
pulled over is, as you can say, I feel like I was being profiled or they was [sic] looking for
something and then that escalated to another thing.” (Tr. at 165)

"Applicant is a 34-year-old,  married  man with  one child, age nine,  He served in the
U.S. Navy from  2011  to  2016. He was honorably  discharged.  Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s
degree  in  information  technology in  2019, and  a  master’s degree  in information  assurance
and  cybersecurity in 2021. (Response  at 3)  He  has been  working  for a  defense  contractor
since 2017. (Item 5 at  14)
Applicant has been using marijuana with varying degrees of frequency since 2007.
For the first three to four years of his use, he periodically sold marijuana. (Item 6 at 2; Item
8 at 10) Applicant stopped using marijuana while he was in the Navy and resumed use in
2018. Since then, he typically either smokes it or uses it in candy form. He typically uses it
with his wife. (Items 7 at 6; 8 at 9) He enjoys using marijuana, contending that it helps him
manage anxiety, helped him quit smoking tobacco, and makes him “feel relaxed, like [he]
feels when he drinks two beers, but without the weight gain.” (Item 7 at 6) Over the years,
he has used it approximately 300 times.
Applicant’s last use of marijuana was in March 2022, approximately four years after
he completed a security clearance application, and four days before he was scheduled for
an interview with an investigative agent. (Item 7 at 5) At that time, he was using marijuana
approximately once per week. (Item 7 at 5) In response to a question on the March 2022
interrogatories regarding future illegal marijuana use, Applicant responded, as follows:
I have  no  details, but I figure it’s better to  err  on  the  side  of the  affirmative.
The  national culture  is shifting  and  all  but the  top  seems to  be  moving  with  it.
5mg or  2  beers doesn’t  make  much  difference  since  I don’t leave  my house
either way.  (Item 7 at 9)
In response to subparagraph 1.c alleging that Applicant intends to continue using marijuana
in the future, he denied it, explaining that he does not have a plan in place to continue
using marijuana, but was “not against” using it in the future, and “wouldn’t use it, at least,
for a while.” (Item 3 at 2)
Applicant believes the current  classification of marijuana  under federal law  as a
Schedule I drug with a high potential for abuse is “ridiculous,” and the presumption that use
of marijuana constitutes “such a danger that [he] can’t be trusted by using it is incorrect[,]
and . . . the majority of the developed world would agree” with him. (Item 7 at 11) Moreover,
though he admits that  he  is disregarding the law  by using marijuana, he denies  that it
reflects negatively on his character. (Response at 1)
Applicant has a medical disability that results in severe neck pain, for which he is
prescribed a combination of anti-inflammatory medication and muscle relaxers. (Item 3 at 1)
In 2019, his prescription was delayed in the mail. Subsequently, Applicant experienced
extreme pain, compelling him to use one of his mother’s prescription pain relievers, on one
occasion, to get it under control. (Item 3 at 1; Item 6 at 3)
Shortly  before  Applicant  entered  the  Navy  in  2011,  he  completed  a  security
clearance application. He did not include his purchase, sale, and use of marijuana on the
application, as  required,  and as  alleged in  SOR  subparagraphs 2.a  and  2.b. Applicant
contends that he told his recruiter who advised him to “keep it to [him]self.” (Response at 1)
Applicant completed  a  security clearance  application  in 2018. SOR subparagraph
2.c alleges that he  underreported  his  marijuana  use  by not disclosing  his use  in 2007  in
response  to  Section  23  of the  application  requiring  disclosure  of  illegal  drugs  within  the  past
seven  years preceding  completion  of the  application.  Applicant answered   ‘Yes,’   to  this
question,   disclosing  that  his most  recent  use   was  approximately  seven   months  before
completion of the application.

"The single allegation  in the SOR concerns Applicant’s  alleged use of marijuana
from  April  2020  through  October  2021  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.
Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a  with  an  explanation.  His  admission  is  incorporated  into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  26  years  old.  He  has  never  married  and  has  no  children.  After
graduating  high  school  in  2014,  he  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2018.  He  began
working as an engineer with a defense contractor in May 2019. He submitted his initial
SCA  in  July 2019  and was  subsequently  granted  a  security  clearance.  He  left  his  first
contracting position in September 2021 and started with his current employer, another
defense contractor, in October 2021. (Items 4, 6)
Applicant did not list  any drug  use on his July 2019 SCA. On his October 2021
SCA, he disclosed that he began smoking marijuana in April 2020 as the COVID-related
lockdowns  began.  Applicant  lives  in  State  1.  He  smoked  marijuana  in  a  neighboring
state, State 2, where its purchase and use was legal under state law. After a few weeks,
he  stopped  using  marijuana  when  he  began  feeling  “paranoid”  each  time  he  smoked.
About  a  year  later,  marijuana  became  legal  in  State  1  and  Applicant  started  smoking
marijuana weekly. (Items 4, 6)
In  August  2021,  Applicant  briefly  stopped  using  marijuana  so  that  he  could
interview  and  take  a  drug  test  for  his  current  employer  in  connection  with  the  hiring
process. Once Applicant passed the drug test, he resumed his use of marijuana.  (Item
4)
On  his  October  2021  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  all  of  his  marijuana  use
occurred while he possessed a security clearance. He further stated “I intend to use this
drug  since  it’s  legal  in  [State  1],  although  I  will  not  if  it  is  necessary  to  stop  for  this
security clearance, or for my job.” (Item 4)
During  his  January  2022  background  interview,  Applicant  explained  he  smoked
marijuana  with  his  former  girlfriend  and  her  cousin.  He  described  feeling  a  “paranoid
anxiety”  each  time  he  smoked  and  stopped  using  it.  However,  he  started  using
marijuana  again  when  it  became  available  in  State  1.  Applicant  admitted  that,  during
this time, he held a security clearance with his previous employer, a defense contractor.
However,  Applicant  claimed  that  the  contractor  had  a  “laid-back  environment”  and  he
did not recall ever being briefed about  drug use or being required to take a urinalysis.
(Item 5)
However,  Applicant  stated  that  shortly  after  starting  with  his  current  employer,
that employer’s security officer told him that he could not use marijuana while holding a
security  clearance.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  was  “surprised”  to  learn  that  marijuana
remained  illegal  under  federal  law,  which,  in  his  view,  “contradicted”  state  law.  He
claimed  that  he  never used  marijuana  in  high  school  or  college  because  it  was  illegal
and he  had  since  only used  in  states  where it  was  legal.  Applicant  asserted  he  would
not  have  used  marijuana  if  it  was  illegal  for  him  to  do  so.  He  claimed  that  he  had  no
intent of using marijuana in the future. (Item 5)
In  his June  2022 Response  to  DOHA  Interrogatories,  Applicant  detailed that  he
used  marijuana  weekly  from  April  2020  through  May  2020  and  again  from  May  2021
through  August  2021.  After he  passed  his  August 2021  drug  test, Applicant  increased
his marijuana use to every other day until he stopped in October 2021. (Item 5)
In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  “I  used  marijuana  in  places  it  was
legalized  …  and  didn’t  realize  I  was  breaking  this  guideline  since  it  was  only illegal at
the  federal level.  I have  stopped  using  marijuana  since my  security  officer  warned me
about this guideline and I don’t plan on using it in the future.” (Item 3)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  Government’s  FORM  or  otherwise  offer  any
mitigating evidence beyond what he had previously stated.
",False
"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e, 2.b-2.d, 3.a, and the cross-allegations at SOR
¶¶ 3.b-3.c. He denied SOR ¶ 2.a.  His admissions are incorporated into the findings of
fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old facilities and logistics support employee. He has been
employed  by  his  sponsor  since  July  2022.  (Item  3  at  13.)  He  earned  his  high  school
diploma in August 2010. He attended community college in 2012 and 2015 and has not
completed his associates degree. (Item 3 at 12.) He is single and resides with his girlfriend
and her two children. (Item 3 at 23 and Response.) He does not have any children of his
own. (Item 3 at 24.)
Item 8 is Applicant’s August 1, 2014 e-QIP.  He marks on his June 28, 2018 e-QIP
that he was granted a clearance. (Item 3 at 40.)
Guideline G  (cross-alleged under  Guideline J)
In December 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged  with Drunk in Public. In
February  2014,  he  was  found  guilty  in  abstentia.  (Item  5  at  1.)  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  3.b)  He
explained in his Answer he had gotten out of his friend’s car while his friend “was being
arrested for DUI” and the same officers arrested him as he walked to his friend’s house.
In June 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged. He pled guilty in September
2014 of Driving While Intoxicated. (Item 5 at 4-5.) (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 3.b) He was required to
attend counseling as part of his sentence. (Item 5 at 5.) The Government notes he violated
his probation. (Item 5 at 16.) Prior to his parole violation he was found to have failed to
comply  with  court  orders  on  multiple  occasions.  (Item  5  at  8-9,10-11,  and  14-15.)  He
offered that he attended and completed the two required court ordered programs. (Item
2 at 1.)
In February 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with Violation of Probation-
Failure  to  Comply  with  ASAP  (Alcohol  Safety  Action  Program).  He  pled  guilty  in  April
2017. (Item 5 at 16-17.) (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 3.b) He asserted that he was confused about the
scheduling and that he did not receive the notice for his first appointment because it was
sent to a prior address. He offered that he completed the required counseling program.

In  July  2015, Applicant  was arrested  and  charged  with  being  Drunk  in Public. He
pled  nolo contendere  in January 2016  of  being  Drunk in  Public or Profane. (Item 5 at 18-
19.)  (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 3.b)
In February 2019, Applicant was arrested  with being Drunk or profane in Public
and Disorderly Conduct. He pled nolo contendere to the charges in May 2019.  (SOR ¶¶

Applicant  indicated  on  his 2018  e-QIP  that  he  had  sought treatment with  an  out-
of-state   care   provider  in  2015.   (Item   3   at  39.)  He  listed   completing   his  court   required
program   in  2017.  (Item   3   at  39.)   He  asserted   that   all   these   incidences  were   part   of  a
chapter   of  his  life   when   he   was  not  mature   enough   to   fully  understand   how  poor  his
behavior was.  He stated  he  is not a  bad  person  and  was just a  young  man  doing  what  he
thought  was  ""fun""  and  in  dealing  with  the  consequences  of  his  actions  he  has  “since
matured and [does] not plan to venture down that road again.” (Item 2 at 2.)
Guideline H (cross-alleged under  Guideline  J)
Applicant denies using marijuana from about July 2015 to about December 2015,
as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.a.  On  his  June  2018  SCA  he  marked  “no”  to  using  drugs  or
controlled  substances  in  the  last  seven  years.  (Item  3  at  37.)  He  told  the  investigator
during his enhanced subject interview (ESI) on September 6, 2018, that he stopped using
marijuana  in  December  2015.  (Item  4  at  10.)  He  authenticated  the ESI  on  August  24,
2020. (Item 4 at 3.)
Applicant admits that in May 2019, he tested positive for cocaine on a urinalysis
test administered while he was on probation. (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 3.c). He was on probation for
being drunk and disorderly, the offense at SOR ¶ 1.e.
On two sperate occasions, in July 2015 and May 2019, Applicant was arrested and
charged with possession of marijuana. He later pled nolo contendere and was found guilty
on  both  occasions.  (SOR  ¶¶  2.c,  2.d,  3.c)  In  his  Answer,  he  states  he  did  not  claim
ownership of the marijuana.
As  a  general  explanation  for  his  conduct,  Applicant  asserted  that,  as  with  his
alcohol-related offenses addressed above, these incidences were part of a chapter of his
life when he was not mature enough to fully understand how poor his behavior was. (Item
2 at 2.)
Guideline J
In December 2016 Applicant was charged and later found guilty in August 2017 of
pointing a laser at a police officer. (SOR ¶ 3.a) He states it was not his intention to do any
of  this.  He  believed  there  was  a  possible  break-in  because  when  he  saw  flashlights
shining up at the neighboring townhouse windows while he was sitting on his balcony. He
states in his Answer that he shined his laser pointer to deter the suspected thieves. He
was surprised to find out that it was law enforcement and apologized to them. (Item 2 at
2.)  The  reporting  police  officer reported  that he  saw  them  and  “he  thought  it  would  be
funny to mess with us.” Item 6 at 20.)
Applicant  offered  a  letter  with  his  Answer  and  Response  documenting  his
comprehensive  outpatient  addiction  and  treatment.  (AE  B).  The  treatment  started  in
December 2020. He attended three times a week for three hours a day and he completed
29  sessions.  He  attended  and  participated  in  all  aspects  of  the  treatment,  including
random  breathalyzer  (BAI)  testing  for  alcohol  use  and  urinalysis  testing  for  drugs.  He
tested negative for alcohol and all other substances tested. His program manager noted
he had made significant progress in the areas of recognizing and managing craving, the
ability to identify emotions, and gain insight to the motivations and reasons for his past
treatment-focused,  engaged,  well-respected  and
substance  use  and  was  very
participatory in group sessions. Applicant completed the program in February 2021. (AE1)
Applicant in his Response stated he “was honestly embarrassed to see how many
charges and mishaps”  he  had to admit to.  He offered that  his Answer was made  “in a
panic”  and  he  was  looking  for  “excuses  or  small  discrepancies  in  the  contents  of  the
package  to  try  and  lighten  things  up  a  bit,”  but  as  he  went  through  the  SOR  he
acknowledged  “there  was  a  whole  lot  of  truth  written  out”  for  him  “to  finally  own.”  He
acknowledged the reports describe him during a time in life where he was a “young adult
having trouble finding [his] way.” He states these actions do not define [him] accurately
as the man [he has] grown to be.” He offers that he has taken control his life is working
on a plan to obtain a double major in cybersecurity and cloud computing. He asserts in
his Response that he is using this experience to explain to the two children that depend
on him “that your actions can and will catch up to you if you let them.”

"Applicant  is  34  years  old  and  single.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  a
master’s  degree.  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  senior
software engineer since March 2019. He seeks to obtain national security eligibility and
a security clearance in connection with his current employment. Applicant has not held a
security clearance in the past. (Item 3 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
As  a  general  statement,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  an  extensive  history  of
illegal drug abuse when he worked in the restaurant industry before 2014. After he began
school in 2014 his drug use continued as further described below. (Item 3 at Section 23;
Item 4 at 12-14.)
The allegations will be discussed in chronological order:
1.b.   Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana  on  various  occasions  from
approximately  May  2006  until  February  2018.  (The  SOR  allegation  that  Applicant’s
marijuana  use  began  in  2003  is  based  on  a  typographical  error  in  the  Report  of
Investigation of an interview of Applicant by a Government investigator dated December
10, 2019.) Applicant’s most frequent use of marijuana occurred between 2006 and 2013.
During that period, he used marijuana on a daily, weekly, or bi-weekly basis. From 2014
to 2018 Applicant used marijuana infrequently. His last use was at a family wedding in
February 2018. (Item 3 at 46-47; Item 4 at 12; Applicant Exhibit B.)
Applicant submitted  a  notarized  statement of intent  dated  February 4, 2022, as  an
attachment  to  his  interrogatory  responses. Part of  that  statement says, “I  am  not  able to
commit to  not associating  with  individuals who  use,  because  many  members of  my  family
use  marijuana, and family is very important to me.” (Item  4 at 19-20.)
1.j.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  July  2007  and  charged  with  Operating  Under  the
Influence of Alcohol, Speeding, and Possession of a Class D Substance: Marijuana. He
stated that he was put on probation for a year and had to obtain counseling. (Item 3 at
42-43; Item 4 at 11.)
1.f.  Applicant  purchased  and  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  about  four  times
from about March 2007 to about May 2010. (Item 3 at 47; Item 4 at 13.)
1.g. Applicant purchased and used LSD about four times from about March 2007
to about May 2010. (Item 3 at 47; Item 4 at 13.)
1.c. Applicant used cocaine from about April 2007 to about April 2014. He stated,
“During most of my restaurant career I would use cocaine once every few months, but in
2013 when I was at . . . Steakhouse there was a couple months were [sic] I used once a
week on ‘guys night.’ Towards the end of this I realized that cocaine is basically a waste
of money and I haven’t used it since.” (Item 3 at 47-48; Item 4 at 13; Applicant Exhibit B.)
1.i.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  about  October  2009  and  charged  with  Drug
Possession  of  a  Class  A  Substance:  Heroin.  Applicant  stated  that  the  charges  were
dropped. (Item 3 at 43-44; Item 4 at 11-12.)
1.h.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  December  2009  after  he  was  involved  in  an
automobile  accident.  He  was  charged  with  Negligent  Operation  of  a  Motor  Vehicle,
Marked Lanes Violation, and Possession of a Class D Substance: Marijuana. He stated
that the Possession charge was dropped and he was put on probation for a year. (Item 3
at 44-45; Item 4 at 12.)
Applicant became  addicted  to  prescription  painkillers in approximately 2009  due
to  serious pain in his legs and  feet from  his work in the  restaurant industry. He stated, “I
tried  to  combat this [pain]  with  Aleve  or Ibuprofen, but I eventually started  to  use  stronger
prescription  medication that wasn’t prescribed for me.” (Applicant Exhibit B  at 2.)
1.e. Applicant used the prescription medication Oxycontin that was not prescribed
for him between May 2009 to June 2012. (Item 3 at 50-51; Item 4 at 13.)
1.d.   Applicant  used  the  prescription  medication  Oxymorphone  that  was  not
prescribed  to  him  from  about  May  2011  to  November  2012.  Applicant  used  this  drug
because Oxycontin became more difficult to acquire. (Item 3 at 51; Item 4 at 13.)
1.a.  In  about  May  2012  Applicant  began  using  the  prescription  drug  Suboxone
daily as a way to combat his opioid addiction. Applicant did not obtain a prescription for
it. Rather, he obtained the Suboxone from his father. His use of Suboxone continued for
ten years, until March 2022, just before issuance of the SOR. This was after he submitted
his e-QIP in 2019 and responses to DOHA interrogatories in February 2022. (Item 3 at
51; Item 4 at 13-14.)
Applicant enrolled in a Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program on March
8, 2022, aimed at persons suffering from Opioid Use Disorder. A Progress Report dated
July 7, 2022, states that Applicant had made eight appointments without any absences.
The  Report  describes  the  program:  “MAT  is  arranged  as  part  of  a  comprehensive
treatment that includes medication with counseling and participation in [a] social support
program.” (Applicant Exhibits A and B at 3.)
Also attached to Applicant Exhibit B, at 4, is a statement dated July 7, 2022, from
a  Lead  Behavioral  Health  Technician  at  the  counseling  center  Applicant  attends.  The
statement  says,  “He  [Applicant]  is currently stable and  seen monthly by provider . . . .
[Applicant] is consistent and appears committed to his recovery by reliably participating
in MAT services. He would benefit from the continuance of medication.”
Applicant  stated  that  he  is  currently  on  the  drug  Buprenorphine,  with  a  proper
prescription to help him combat Opioid Use Disorder. He further stated, “So far, my time
in the MAT program has proven to be stable and successful, so I will continue this route
until this is finally behind me.” (Applicant Exhibit B at 2.)
As  stated,  Applicant  submitted  a  signed  statement  of  intent  that  said  in  part,  “If
issued security clearance, I am willing to abstain from any drug involvement or substance
misuse, and I acknowledge that any future involvement or misuse would be considered
grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.” (Item 4 at 19.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  engaged  in  conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Applicant did not admit
or deny the sole allegation under this guideline. His silence is viewed as a denial.
2.a.   The  Government  alleges  in  this  subparagraph  that  all  of  the  information  to
which Applicant admitted set forth under paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under
this guideline.
Paragraph 3  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
The  Government alleges in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for  clearance
because   he   has  engaged   in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about   a   person’s
judgment,   reliability,  and   trustworthiness.   Applicant  did  not   admit  or  deny   the   sole
allegation under this guideline. His silence is viewed as a denial.
3.a.   The  Government  alleges  in  this  subparagraph  that  all  of  the  information  to
which Applicant admitted set forth under paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under
this guideline.
The record contains no evidence concerning Applicant’s recent job performance,
trustworthiness,  character  in  a  professional  setting,  or  track  record  with  respect  to
handling sensitive information and observation of job-related security procedures. I was
unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since he elected to
have his case decided without a hearing.

"Applicant is 30 years old. He has never been married but he is currently living with
his fiancée. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2014, and a master’s degree in 2020. Since
June 2015, he has worked for a government contractor as an engineer. He was issued a
DOD security clearance in about March 2018. (Items 1, 4 and 5)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  H  that  Applicant  had  used  marijuana  with
varying frequency from December 2011 through November 2020. (SOR ¶ 1.a.) His use
of  marijuana  continued  after he had  been granted a  DOD security  clearance in  March
2018.  He  denied  both  of  the  allegations.  He  did  not  provide  an  explanation  of  the
circumstances or time period of his marijuana use in his Answer to the SOR. (Items 1 and
2)
Applicant listed in his December 2016 security clearance application (SCA) that he
had used marijuana from December 2011 through December 2013. He described his use
as  experimental  and  primarily  in  college.  He  also  stated  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use
marijuana in the future. He acknowledged marijuana use was illegal, and he did not like
the way it made him feel. (Item 3)
Applicant  completed  another  SCA  in  March  2021.  He  disclosed  that  he  used
marijuana from December 2011 through November 2020. His continued use of marijuana
occurred after college and after he claimed he had no intent to use marijuana in the future.
Based  on  the  information  he  disclosed  in  the  2021  SCA,  his  use  of  marijuana  also
occurred after he was hired by his sponsoring employer in June 2015, and after he was
issued a DOD security clearance in March 2018. (Item 4)
Applicant was interviewed on May 28, 2021, by an authorized DOD investigator.
Applicant  admitted  that  he  sporadically  used  marijuana  between  December  2011  and
November  2020.  His  most  recent  use  occurred  during  the  pandemic,  and  he  had
purchased it from a dispensary in his state where marijuana use is legal. After using it, he
realized that although marijuana is legal in his state of residence, it is considered illegal
under federal law. He used marijuana while possessing a security clearance because he
was  not  clear  about  the  laws.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use
marijuana in the future. (Item 5)

"Applicant  is  33  years  old  and  single.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  is
currently studying for his master’s. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor
as an engineer since September 2020 and seeks to obtain national security eligibility and
a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  current  employment.  He  had  worked  for
another defense  contractor from 2013  to  2020.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Sections  12,
13A, and 17.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about  a  person’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted both allegations under this
guideline.
1.a.  Applicant  was  arrested  on  December  28,  2016,  and  charged  with  Felony
Assault with a Deadly Weapon. Applicant stated that he was extremely intoxicated that
night and does not really remember the event. However, Applicant admitted he hit another
person in the head with a glass during a bar fight. The glass broke, the other person was
injured, and Applicant was arrested. Applicant subsequently pled guilty in May 2017 to
the Assault with a Deadly Weapon charge. He was sentenced to five years of supervised
probation,  two  days  in  jail,  and  30  days  community  labor.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Section 22, Exhibit 4 at pages 10-11.)
Applicant’s probation terms included the following, as described by Applicant:
Do  not  use  or  possess  any  narcotics,  dangerous  or  restricted  drugs  or
associated  paraphernalia,  except  with  a  valid  prescription  and  stay  away
from places where users or sellers congregate. Do not associate with drug
users or sellers unless attending a drug treatment program. . . Abstain from
the  use  of  alcoholic  beverages,  including  beer  and  wine,  and  stay  out  of
places  where  they  are  the  chief  items  of  sale.  .  .  You  [Applicant]  are
specifically ordered not to use or possess any quantity of marijuana, even
with  an  otherwise  valid  prescription  or  recommendation.  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 22.)
Applicant’s  probation  ended  in  May  2022.  (Tr.  49.)  He  repeatedly  violated  the
above terms of his probation as described below.
1.b.  Applicant used illegal drugs and alcohol on a frequent basis from May 2017
through June 2019 while he was on probation for the offense set forth in 1.a, above. He
knew his conduct was in violation of his probation. Applicant admitted that he did not tell
the probation department at any time that he was violating his probation. He stated that
he discussed telling the probation department about his drug and alcohol use once he
stopped using all drugs and alcohol after June 2019. He was advised by relatives that he
should not do so, since admitting to a probation violation may require him to go to jail or
prison.  Applicant  agreed  not  to  tell  probation  personnel  about  his  conduct.  Applicant
stated that his probation officer never asked Applicant if he used drugs or alcohol during
his mandatory monthly interviews. (Government Exhibit 4 at 24-25; Tr. 52-54.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  G, Alcohol Consumption)
The  Government alleges in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for  clearance
because  he  consumes  intoxicants to  excess.  Applicant admitted  both  allegations under
this guideline.
2.a. Refer to that information set forth under subparagraph 1.a, above.
2.b.  Applicant  used  alcohol  from  May  2017 through  December  2018.  He  stated
that from about the middle of 2018 until September 2018 he consumed alcohol frequently
and excessively. During that time, as set forth under paragraph 1, above, Applicant was
on probation and required to abstain from any use of alcohol. Applicant was interviewed
by a Government investigator on March 2, 2021. The investigator’s Report of Investigation
(ROI) stated, “He [Applicant] decided to keep drinking alcohol during the time he was on
probation  because  he  had  already  violated  his  probation  at  that  time.”  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 24; Exhibit 4 at pages 12, 22-23; Tr. 54-55.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
As a preliminary matter, Applicant held a security clearance from approximately
January 2015  through March  2017.  According  to  Applicant  his clearance  was  revoked
due  to  the  criminal charges  set  forth  in  paragraph  1,  above.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Section 25.)
3.a. Applicant used marijuana on various occasions from approximately February
2003 until July 2019. As stated, between January 2015 and March 2017 Applicant was
granted access to classified information. He used marijuana daily from June to December
2018. Applicant stopped use for several months until he last used marijuana with an ex-
girlfriend in July 2019. (Government Exhibit 4 at pages 8-19.)
3.b.  Applicant  used  cocaine  on  various  occasions  from  May  2010  to  December
2018. As stated, between January 2015 and March 2017 Applicant was granted access
to  classified  information.  He  used  cocaine  weekly  during  2017.  He  used  cocaine  daily
during 2018 until his last use around New Year’s 2018/19. (Government Exhibit 4 at pages
19-20.)
3.c.  Applicant  used  cocaine  at  work  while  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  in
2018. He stated in his Answer, “I used at an unclassified site with no classified information
present, nor any secure rooms or locations present at the facility.” (Government Exhibit 4
at pages 19-20.)
3.d. Applicant used Ecstasy one time in June 2010 and a second time in July 2018.
It is further alleged that Applicant’s 2018 use of Ecstasy occurred while he was granted
access  to  classified  information.  The  record  is  unclear  as  to  whether  he  actually  had
access in July 2018. He stated in his Answer that his clearance was under reinvestigation
at that time, and he may have had an interim clearance. However, Government Exhibit 5,
a  DISS/CATS  Incident  Report,  stated  Applicant’s  “Eligibility  Level”  was  “none.”  The
document also stated, under “Eligibility Determination,” “’No Determination Made’ made
on  2019-02-11  by  DoD  CAF.”  (Internal  punctuation  added  for  clarity.)  (Government
Exhibit 4 at pages 20, 24; Tr. 51-52.) Given the state of the evidence this allegation is
found for Applicant.
3.e. Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms one time in about November 2018.
It is further alleged that Applicant’s 2018 use of hallucinogenic mushrooms occurred while
he was granted access to classified information. The record is unclear as to whether he
actually had access in July 2018. He stated in his Answer that his clearance was under
reinvestigation  at  that  time,  and  he  may  have  had  an  interim  clearance.  However,
Government Exhibit 5, a DISS/CATS Incident Report, stated Applicant’s “Eligibility Level”
was  “none.”  The  document  also  stated,  under  “Eligibility  Determination,”  “’No
Determination Made’ made on 2019-02-11 by DoD CAF.” (Internal punctuation added for
clarity.)  (Government  Exhibit  4  at  pages  20-21,  24;  Tr.  51-52.)  Given  the  state  of  the
evidence this allegation is found for Applicant.
3.f.  Applicant  admitted
that  he  used  marijuana,  cocaine,  Ecstasy  and
Hallucinogenic Mushrooms between at least May 2017 and July 2019 as set forth above.
During that period, he was prohibited from using any illegal drugs under the terms of his
probation.  He  stated  in  his  Answer  that  his  use,  including  daily  use  of  cocaine  and
marijuana,  was  because,  “I  was  under  extreme  depression  and  anxiety  due  to  the
circumstances that arose from my arrest in December 2016 as stated in subparagraph
1.a.” (Answer; Government Exhibit 4 at pages 18-21; Tr. 49.)
With regard to his drug use, as well as his alcohol use, Applicant stated that he
made a conscious decision at the end of 2018 to stop using all the substances in order to
live a better, healthier life. He also stated that his decision was the result of a religious
awakening  in  his  life.  Applicant  testified  that  his  management  is  aware  of  his  past.
However,  no  additional  information  was  forwarded  by  Applicant  from  his  current
employers setting forth the extent of their knowledge. (Government Exhibit 4 at 18; Tr.
42-48, 54-55.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  falsified  material  facts  during  the  clearance  screening  process.  In
addition, it is alleged that Applicant engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations.
Applicant admitted both allegations under this paragraph with explanations.
4.a.  The Government alleges in this subparagraph that all of the information set
forth under paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, above, is also cognizable under this guideline.
4.b. Applicant submitted an e-QIP on January 11, 2018. (Government Exhibit 2.)
Section 23 concerned Illegal Use of Drugs and Drug Activity. Applicant was specifically
asked,  “In  the  last  (7)  seven  years,  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled
substances?” Applicant answered, “Yes.” He disclosed marijuana use between 2003 and
2013,  cocaine  use  in  2010,  and  Ecstasy  use  in  2010.  These  were  false  answers  to
relevant questions about Applicant’s drug involvement. In his Answer, Applicant explained
this conduct:
Note that while I falsified information at this time, I was using alcohol and
drugs and was not applying my best judgment. The substance abuse did
create my conduct to be questionable and this is what caused me to falsify
information. Another reason was my fear of admission of substance abuse
could be reported to my probation officer and this would cause me to serve
my suspended sentence.
Applicant was forthcoming on a 2020 questionnaire and in subsequent interviews
with Government investigators. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23; Government Exhibit
4 at pages 18-21, 25; Tr. 50.)

The  pastor of Applicant’s church testified  on   his behalf. The  witness has known
Applicant  for  three   years.  He  testified   at  length   about  what  the   witness  views  as
Applicant’s personal growth  in the  past three  years. The  witness had  knowledge  of  the
allegations  in  the   SOR.  He  stated   that  Applicant  has  been   open   with   him   about  his
conduct  and   about   his  battle   with   alcohol  and   drugs.   Applicant   provides   substantial
financial   support   to   the   church.   The   witness  believes  Applicant   to   be   trustworthy.

purchase   of  his marijuana   by  selling   old  trinkets  and   used   video   games.  (Item   5   at  3)
Applicant stopped  using  marijuana  because  he  felt that  it no  longer added  any value  to  his
life. (Item 5 at 3)  Between January 2018 and March 2019, Applicant used  LSD  once  and
hallucinogenic   mushrooms   approximately   three   times.   (Item   3   at   2)  Applicant   has   no
intentions of using illegal drugs in the  future.
In March 2018, Applicant  failed to disclose his illegal drug use in response to a
question on a public trust position application. There is no record evidence as to whether
he  was  confronted  about  this  omission.  Applicant  disclosed  his  illegal  drug  use  and
discussed it at length on his 2021 security clearance application. (Item 3 at 32-34)

"Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used  marijuana with varying
frequency from about August 2015 until about June 2020; dimethyltryptamine (DMT) from
about October 2019 until about June 2020; lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) from about
March  2017  until  about  March  2021;  methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA),  also
known as molly, or ecstasy, from about October 2018 until about March 2021; ketamine
from about September 2019 until about February 2020; cocaine twice in about October
2017; psilocybin in February 2020; and that Applicant used the prescription medication
Adderall that was not prescribed to her from about October 2017 until about December
2019.
The SOR also alleges that Applicant purchased LSD and MDMA at varying times
during her periods of usage of each of the substances, that she purchased Adderall in
about October 2017, and that she attempted  to purchase cocaine in about September
2019.  It  also  alleges  that  Applicant  purchased  marijuana  from  August  2015  until
September 2020. Applicant admits each of the SOR allegations. Applicant’s admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant,  25, is  a  quantum  sciences researcher employed  by a  defense  contractor
since  July  2021. She  received  her bachelor’s degree  in 2019.  This is her  first application
for security clearance. (GX 3.)
The information in the record regarding Applicant’s drug abuse is derived from her
August 2021 e-QIP. Applicant also discussed her drug use with the investigator during
her personal subject interview (PSI) in September 2021, and in her answer to the SOR.
In  response  to  the  questions  under  Section  21  –  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug
Activity on her August 2021 e-QIP, Applicant set forth her use of illegal drugs and misuse
of prescription drugs. In  response to the  “provide  explanation” sections of the drug-use
related  questions,  Applicant  described  her  drug  use  in  a  narrative  format.  She  also
provided estimated dates of first use and last use. In response to the section where she
was required to “provide nature of use, frequency, and number of times used” Applicant
listed the dates of use, her characterization of the frequency of use, and the drug used.
Applicant also discussed her drug use during her September 2021 PSI.
Applicant first smoked marijuana in the summer of 2015. She characterizes this
use as “experimental.” She smoked with a former friend from high school with whom she
has not associated since that time.
From  the  fall  of  2015  until 2017, Applicant was a  university student  and  smoked
marijuana  occasionally. Applicant  does not  state  her definition  of “occasionally.” Applicant
transferred  out  of  this  university in  2017, and  only  maintained  a  relationship with  one  of
her  friends.  She   disassociated   herself  from   all   her  other  drug-using   associates   at   this
university.
In March 2017, while Applicant was visiting her remaining friend at the university
Applicant  previously  attended,  she  used  LSD  on  a  single  occasion.  Applicant
characterizes this use as experimental.
Applicant stated on her e-QIP that she used cocaine twice in October 2017 while
hanging out with some friends from her sorority. However, she told the investigator during
her  PSI  that  she  used  cocaine  on  another  occasion  while  hanging  out  with  the  same
friends. She disassociated herself from the people with whom she used cocaine.
On her e-QIP, Applicant stated that she also used MDMA one time and misused
Adderall  one  time  in  October  2017.  She  characterizes  the  use  of  these  two  drugs  as
experimental.
Between June and December 2018, Applicant characterizes her marijuana use as
frequent, smoking marijuana on a weekly basis, primarily with her two housemates. One
of  her  housemates  was  her  remaining  friend  from  the  university  Applicant  previously
attended. In June 2018, Applicant used LSD with her housemates. She characterizes this
use  as  experimental.  Her  friend  from  Applicant’s  former  university  moved  out  of  their
shared  house  in  January  2019  and  Applicant  has  not  had  any  contact  with  this  friend
since that time.
Applicant misused Adderall occasionally between June 2018 and June 2019 with
her housemate(s). She stated in her PSI that she misused Adderall a total of six to eight
times total. Between January and June 2019, Applicant used marijuana on an occasional
basis  with  her  remaining  housemate.  In  March  2019,  Applicant  used  LSD  with  her
housemate. She also used MDMA one time in March 2019. Applicant characterizes the
use as of these two drugs as experimental. Applicant has not associated with her former
housemate since December 2019.
Between June and August 2019, Applicant did not use any illegal drugs or misuse
any  prescription  drugs  because  she  was  living  in  a  “drug-free  environment.”  Applicant
was living with her father.
Applicant stated on her e-QIP that in August 2019, she moved into a new house
where she had not met most of the people who also lived there. Applicant was unaware
that her housemates were drug users until after she had moved in. While living there until
March  2020,  Applicant  describes  her  marijuana  use  as  “very  occasional.”  She  also
“occasionally used  LSD and  experimented  with  DMT and  psilocybin mushrooms.” She
stated that she used DMT one time and MDMA one time in October 2019 and psilocybin
mushrooms one time in February 2020. She also misused Adderall between September
and  December  2019  with  her  housemates.  Applicant  misused  Ketamine  three  or  four
times between August 2019 and March 2020 with her housemates who provided it.
During her PSI, Applicant stated that from 2019 until March 2020, she used LSD
monthly.  Applicant  stated  that  after  March  2020,  she  used  LSD  on  a  more  infrequent
basis.  She also  stated  that  she  used mushrooms  two  times  between  March  2017  and
March  2021  but  was  not  able  to  recall  the  exact  dates.  She  stated  that  she  used  the
mushrooms with friends, however she felt nauseous and vomited both times she used
them.
On her e-QIP, Applicant stated that she purchased marijuana from August 2015
until September 2020 “from former drug-using associates on a small scale, for myself to
use, occasionally during this time period.”
Between  September  2018  and  September  2019,  Applicant  purchased  a  small
amount of MDMA from a former associate. She also attempted to purchase MDMA online
on the “dark web.”
The dark web is the set of webpages on the World Wide Web that cannot
be  indexed  by  search  engines,  are  not  viewable  in  the  standard  web
browser, require specific means (such as specialized software or network
configuration) in order to access, and use encryption to provide anonymity
and privacy for users. https://www.merriam-webster.com
In March 2017, Applicant purchased LSD one time from a friend. On her e-QIP,
she explained that in September 2019 she purchased LSD through the “dark web” while
a  friend  guided  her  through  the  transaction.  She  stated  she  “was  hesitant  to  use  this
method ever again and so did not.” She also stated that she “may have exchanged cash
on other occasions as well but I do not remember exact dates or times.” During her PSI,
Applicant stated  that she  would purchase  LSD on  the  “dark web” and  it would then  be
mailed directly to her home.
Between October 2017 and December 2019, Applicant purchased Adderall from a
friend who had it. On her e-QIP, Applicant stated that she did not ever purchase cocaine.
In September 2019, she attempted to purchase cocaine on the “dark web,” however, she
was not successful. She submitted her payment and after the transaction was complete,
“it was clear that I would not receive this product.”
Throughout  her  responses  to  the  drug-related  questions  on  the  e-QIP,  Applicant
repeatedly listed the mitigating factors regarding her past drug use. Specifically, Applicant
noted her disassociation from her drug-using associates and her move in March 2020 out
of an environment where drugs were used.
In  March  2020,  Applicant  moved  out  of  the  house  she  had  been  living  in  with
housemates since August 2019 and moved in with her mother. In her e-QIP, she states,
I moved  out in March 2020  to  avoid the  environment were  drugs were  used,
and  have  not kept  in  close  contact  with  these  people (outside  of seeing  two
of these  people for  lunch  on  two  separate  occasions, where  there was no
alcohol or  drug   use   involved).  This demonstrates  my  disassociation   from
these   drug-using   associates,   as   well   as   my  changing   or  avoiding   this
environment were  drugs were used.”
Applicant continued to use illegal drugs from March 2020 until March 2021. Her
last stated marijuana use was in June 2020. She describes her other drug use as follows:
Occasional LSD use. One  MDMA  experimental use. Two  of the  LSD use
cases were  with  two  other people,  one  of whom  is  a  friend  I  made  in  college,
and  the  other was someone  she  went to  high  school with  that I am  not close
with. Since  then,  the  friend  I made  in  college  has  also, like  me,  made  the
decision  to  lead  a  drug-free  lifestyle. Another LSD use  case  was a  situation
where I was the  only user, and  was with  a  friend  who  is not a  drug  user.
This friend  is very encouraging  of me  leading  a  healthy, drug-free  lifestyle.
The  final LSD and  MDMA  use  case  was with  a  friend  who  did  not use  LSD,
but used  MDMA. This incident was  potentially a  contributing  factor to  this
friend’s  subsequent  hospitalization.  Since   this  incident,   this  friend   and   I
have  both resolved to  commit to a  healthy, drug-free lifestyle.
It  is unclear from  Applicant’s  statements  in  her e-QIP and during her PSI if  she
purchased  the  marijuana,  MDMA,  and  LSD  that  she  used  between  March  2020  and
March 2021, or how she otherwise obtained these drugs.
On her e-QIP, Applicant concluded her comments with the following statement:
Overall, I acknowledge my former drug involvement and substance  misuse
. . . I have  provided  [evidence] of my actions  that I  have  taken  to  mitigate
concern.  I  have   disassociated   from   drug-using   associates  and   contacts,
and  have  changed  and  avoided  the  environment where drugs  were  used  in
the  past.  I have  an  excellent support system  of substance-free  friends and
family  members,  and   am   committed   to   and   look  forward   to   continuing   to
lead  a healthy, happy,  and  drug-free life.
Applicant stated  during  her PSI that  she  went through  an  experimental   phase  of
drug  use  while attending  college  and  feels she  has passed  that period. She  further stated
that she  no  longer associates with  the  same  crowd  of people and  she  is focused  on  her
career and  future.  With  her answer, Applicant provided  a  statement of intent to  abstain
from  all  drug  involvement and  substance  misuse  wherein  she  acknowledged  that future
involvement or misuse  is grounds for revocation  of national security  eligibility.  Applicant
stated   her  answer  to   the   SOR  that  she   disclosed   her  prior  drug   use   to   her  employer.
However, there is nothing  in the  record that   suggests that Applicant’s employer or any
other entity with  the  power to  revoke  Applicant’s national security eligibility is screening
her for illegal drug use  or substance misuse.
In her April 2022 answer to the SOR Applicant stated:
I  acknowledge my drug  involvement and  substance misuse.  I have  since
changed my environment and group of associates, and have full support for
my family to continue in my drug and substance misuse-free lifestyle. I have
not  use  substances  since  March  2021,  and  am  demonstrating  this
continued  sobriety  by  submitting  to  voluntary  monthly  drug  tests  with  my
doctor since April 2022.
In the college environment I was a part of, drug use was normalized. This
consistent normalization in such an adolescent environment led to my drug
substance  misuse.  Because  of  this  normalization  and,  quite  frankly,  my
stupidity at the time, I did not fully realize the impact of my actions, both on
my internal health and on my future career prospects. It was not until a friend
of mine was hospitalized in March 2021, in part due to the substance use
we both partook in, that I really had a wake-up call and realized how poorly
I  had  been  treating  my  health.  That  realization,  combined  with  the
realization that many of the serious career aspirations I had would require
a  drug-free  lifestyle,  is  what  led  me  to  making  the  decision  to  halt  all
substance misuse for good. I have not used drugs or misused substances
since March 2021.
Additionally, I have begun the process of seeking counseling with a licensed
clinical therapist not only discuss how my past misjudgments have affected
me,  but  also  take  a  drug  evaluation  assessment  to  demonstrate  an
applicable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.
Applicant did not respond  to  the  FORM. There  is no  record evidence  of the  results
of Applicant’s monthly  drug   tests that   began   in April 2022,   nor is  there any information
regarding counseling.

"Applicant is 31 years old.  He is divorced and has four children, two with his ex-
wife,  and  two  with  his  current  girlfriend  who  resides  with  him.  He  has  completed  two
years of college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Electronic Technician.
He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  conduct,  drug  abuse,  alcohol  abuse,  and
dishonesty, evidenced by numerous arrests and convictions spanning over most of his
adult  life.  (Government  Exhibits  2,  4,  5,  6,  and  7.)  Applicant  admits  to  each  of  the
allegations set forth in the SOR.  (See Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.)
After finishing high  school, Applicant  joined  the  U.S. Army.   He  served  in  the  U.S.
Army from  June  2009  to  December  2016,  and  held  a  security  clearance.   He received
an   Honorable   Discharge  for his first  six-year   tour of  service.   He   then   re-enlisted   for   a
second  two-year tour where most  of  his problems  began.   During  his military career, he
received   a  number   of  awards  and   commendations  for  his   service,  including   the   Army
Good   Conduct   Medal,  (2nd  award);   the   Army   Achievement  Medal,  (2nd   Award);   the
Afghanistan   Campaign   Medal  with   2   campaign   Stars;   the   Global   War   on   Terrorism
Medal;   the   National  Defense   Medal;   and   the   Combat  Action   Badge   for  his  service   in
Afghanistan.   (Applicant’s  Exhibit  F.)
During his second tour in the military, Applicant’s excessive alcohol consumption
and  alcohol  dependence  caused  him  to  be  arrested  on  a  number  of  occasions  for
Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI).  This excessive criminal conduct resulted
in him being disciplined.  (Tr. p. 31-32.)  His rank was reduced from an E-4 to an E-1.
He was eventually discharged from the Army with an “Other than Honorable” discharge
in December 2016.  (Government Exhibit 7.)  Following his discharge, Applicant applied
for  VA  disability.  He  is  currently  receiving  100  percent  VA  disability  for  his  Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  (Applicant’s Exhibit F.)
Applicant explained that he  was born and raised in Iowa  to a drug and alcohol-
addicted  mother.  His  father  was  never  in  the  picture.  He  experienced  a  very difficult
childhood  and  still  suffers  from  this  trauma.  He  described  bouncing  from  foster  care
home to foster care home and always feeling out of place.  He witnessed his 11 month
old sister being molested by one of his foster care parents, and was beaten for trying to
stop the abuse.  As a five or six year old child he described staying in a drug house with
his  biological  mother  and  being  allowed  to  roam  the  streets  with  no  supervision.  His
mother was not present and his two older siblings sometimes took care of him.  He was
also molested at age 5 or 6.  (Tr. p. 37.)
In  March/April  2017,  Applicant  began  working  as  a  civilian  for  a  defense
contractor.  Since  obtaining  this  employment,  he  states  that  he  has  never  violated
company  policies  and  procedures  nor  has  he  violated  any  proprietary  interests  of  the
company.  He states that he has received favorable performance evaluations, and has
been promoted for good job performance.  He contends that for the past four years, he
has greatly improved himself and changed his life for the better.
Guideline J  - Criminal Conduct
Applicant’s  criminal  conduct  began  while  he  was  in  the  Army.  His  extensive
arrest history includes six arrests for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), and
other  related  charges  and  convictions.  1.a.  In  October  2010,  Applicant  was  charged
with underaged drinking.  He was found guilty and received an Article 15.  1.b.  In July
2014,  he  was  apprehended  for  Spousal  Abuse  and  Child  Endangerment.  1.c.
In
October  2015,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI,  with  a  BAC  of  .08%  or
higher,  and  Driving  without  a  license.  1.d.  In  March  2016,  while  on  probation  for  his
October 2015  DUI  offense, Applicant  was arrested  and  charged with  DUI,  and  hit and
run.  1.e.
In  June  2016,  while  still  on  probation  for  his  March  2016  DUI  offense,
Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, and registered a BAC of .13%.  His Army
post  privileges  were  revoked,  and  he  received  a  letter  of  reprimand.  He  was  found
guilty  of  an  Article  15,  given  extra  duty,  and  suspended  forfeiture  of  pay.  1.f.
In
December  2016,  he  was  administratively  separated  from  the  Army  for  misconduct,
(namely his multiple DUI’s) and he received an Other than Honorable Discharge.  1.g.
In  February  2017,  while  still  on  probation  for  the  offense  in  October  2015,  he  was
arrested  and  charged  with  DUI,  and  Driving  While  License  Suspended  for  DUI,  after
registering a BAC of .08% or higher.  1.h.  In September 2018, while still on probation
and  diversion  for  the  offenses  in  October  2015  and  February  2017,  Applicant  was
arrested  and  charged  with  DUI,  and  Driving  While  License  Suspended  for  DUI,  after
registering a BAC of .08% or higher.  1.i.  In October 2018, while still on probation and
diversion for the offenses in October 2015 and  February 2017, Applicant was arrested
and charged with DUI, and Driving While License Suspended for DUI, after registering a
BAC of .08% or higher.  Applicant states that his criminal conduct occurred because he
was young, immature, and made unwise choices while drinking.  (Answer to SOR.)
In  each  of  the  cases  listed  above,  except  for  the  Spousal  Abuse  and  Child
Endangerment  claim,  Applicant  was  found  guilty  or  pled  guilty  to  the  charge  against
him.  He was either sentenced to pay a fine, complete an alcohol course, and a driver’s
license suspension; or he was placed in a military diversion program; and/or ordered to
complete  an  18  month  Traffic,  Alcohol,  and  Awareness  School  for  multiple  offenders.
(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.)
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse
Applicant  has  used  a  variety  of  illegal  drugs  while  possessing  a  security
clearance.  In his answer to the SOR, he admitted using cocaine, but denies ever using
any other illegal drug.  (Answer to SOR.)  He  testified at the hearing  that he  does not

recall  ever  using  any  other  illegal  drug  besides  cocaine.
November  29,  2018,  to  February  27,  2019,  Applicant  voluntarily  entered  an  inpatient
treatment  for  conditions  diagnosed  as  Cocaine  Use  Disorder  (Severe),  Cannabis  Use
Disorder  (Mild),  Stimulant  Use  Disorder  (Moderate),  and  PTSD.
(Tr.  p.  57-69,  and
Government Exhibit 3.)  2.a.  Medical records from the facility reflect that from 2014 until
November  2018,  Applicant  used  cocaine  with  varying  frequency,  including  at  times
daily,  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.  2.b.  From  2012  until  at  least
September  2018,  he  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency,  while  granted  access  to
classified  information.  2.c.  From  June  2018  until  at  least  November  2018,  he  used
methamphetamine  with  varying

information.  2.d.  In late 2017 and/or in 2018, he used MDMA (molly and ecstasy) with
varying  frequency  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.  2.f.  Applicant  has
also on occasion, between 2017 and 2018, shown up late for work under the influence
of illegal drugs and alcohol.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
frequency  while  granted  access
Guideline G  - Alcohol Consumption
Applicant’s history of alcohol abuse includes at least six arrests for DUI and one
arrest  for  Underaged  Drinking,  that  all  occurred  between  2015  and  2018.  Applicant’s
excessive  alcohol  abuse  was  the  reason  he  was  administratively  separated  from  the
Army and the reason why he received an “Other than Honorable” discharge.  After his
discharge from the Army, Applicant continued to abuse alcohol.  He enjoyed consuming
alcohol and  would  often  drink  while using  illegal drugs.  He also  abused  alcohol while
possessing  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  denies  ever  showing  up  for  work  late  or
under  the  influence  of  alcohol.  3.b.  However,  medical  records  from  the  treatment
center  indicate  that  on  several occasions  between  2017  and  2018,  he  arrived  to  work
under the influence of alcohol and drugs and on occasion was late for work because of
this overindulgence.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
3.c.  Following  his  last  arrest  for  DUI  in  October  2018,  Applicant  voluntarily
entered  an  Alcohol  and  Drug  treatment  program  for  his  addictions.  Records  from  the
treatment  center  indicate  that  from  November  29,  2018  to  February  27,  2019,  he
received inpatient treatment for 90 days and was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder
(Severe),  among  other  conditions.  (Applicant’s  Exhibit  F,  and  Government  Exhibit  3.)
After  completing  the  inpatient  treatment  program,  he  attended  the  one-year  outpatient
treatment program  and  successfully completed it on November 26, 2019.  (Applicant’s
Exhibit F.)  Applicant stated that he last consumed alcohol on October 16, 2019.  (Tr. p.
53.)  He states that he has been sober for the past four years.  (Tr. p. 54.)  His intent is
to never drink alcohol again.  (Tr. p. 69.)
Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct
Applicant  has  a  history  of  dishonesty.  Recently,  during  his  security  clearance
background  investigation,  he  has  been  dishonest  and  untruthful  in  response  to  the
Government’s questions on his security clearance application, in his interrogatories, and
during  the  interviews  about  his  past  arrests  and  illegal  drug  use  while  possessing  a
security  clearance.  Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  under  this
guideline, except allegations 4.h., and 4.i.
4.a.  On March 28, 2017, he completed a security clearance application.  Section
15  - Military  History,  asked  him  if  he  was  discharged  from  military  service?  He
answered,  “NO”.  (Government  Exhibit  1.)  This  was  a  false  response.  He  failed  to
disclose  that  he  received  an  “Other  than  Honorable  Discharge”  in  December  2016.
(Government Exhibit 7, and Applicant’s Exhibit F.)
4.b.  Section  22  –  Police  Record,  of  the  same  security  clearance  application
asked the Applicant if in the last seven years he has been issued a summons, citation,
or  ticket  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal  proceeding  filed  against  him?;  has  he  been
arrested  by  any  police  officer  or  sheriff,  marshal  or  any  other  type  if  law  enforcement
official?; has he been charged, convicted, or sentenced of a crime in any court?; has he
been or is currently on probation or parole?; is he currently on trial or awaiting a trial on
criminal charges?  Applicant answered, “NO.”  (Government Exhibit 1.)  This was a false
response.  He  failed  to  disclose  his  extensive  arrest  history  discussed  above.
(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.)
4.c.  Section  23-Illegal Drugs,  of  the  same  security  clearance application asked
the  Applicant  if  in  the  last  seven  years  he  has  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled

substances?  Applicant  answered,  “No.”
response.  He failed to list his illegal drug use discussed above.
4.d.  Section  23  also  asked  the  Applicant  if  he  has  ever  illegally  used  or
otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security
clearance  other  than  previously  listed?  Applicant  answered,  “NO.”
(Government
Exhibit  1.)  This  was  a  false  response.  He  failed  to  list  his  illegal  drug  use  while
possessing a security clearance discussed above.
4.e.  During an interview on April 11, 2019, with an investigator for the Defense
Department,  Applicant  denied  ever  receiving  letters  of  reprimand  while  in  the  Army.
Only  after  being  confronted  by  the  investigator  did  he  admit  to  receiving  the  letters  of
reprimand.  (Government Exhibit 2.)

(Government
Exhibit 2.)
4.h.  During an interview on August 9, 2021, with an investigator for the Defense
Department, Applicant stated that he had only used cocaine three times and that he had
never used drugs while possessing a security clearance.  Applicant blatantly lied to the
investigator.  Applicant has actually used cocaine more than three times and has used
a variety of other illegal drugs, including cocaine, while possessing a security clearance.
(Government Exhibit 2.)
4.i.  Applicant  was  asked  to  respond  to  interrogatories  dated  January  3,  2022.
When  asked  to  provide  the  month  and  year  of  his  last  use  of  marijuana/THC,
amphetamine/methamphetamine, and molly/ecstasy, Applicant denied ever using these
drugs  by  answering  “NA.”  (Government  Exhibit  2.)  He  was  not  truthful  in  answering
this question.  In fact, the Applicant’s last use of these illegal drugs is discussed above.

drove  a  vehicle  while  knowing  that  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  or  revoked.

Applicant  was  not  truthful  when  he  answered  the  questions  on  his  security
clearance  application  in  Sections  22  and  23  discussed  above.  He  should  have
answered  “Yes.”  He  was  also  not  truthful  during  his  interview  with  the  investigator  in
April 2019,  or in his interrogatories  in  January 2022.  Applicant’s  deliberate attempt  to

On  the  weekend  of  August  21,  2021,  Applicant  attended  an  off  base  popular
overseas  nightclub  and  while  there  engaged  in  heavy  drinking.  While  at  the  club  he
states that he “was offered cocaine and made  the bad judgment of accepting.”  (Item 2
at  1)  In  the  drug  treatment  documentation  provided  by  Applicant,  the  report  indicates
that he used “cocaine twice that weekend.” (Item 2 at 9)
On  August  25,  2021,  Applicant  provided  a  urine  sample  during  a  random  drug
test. On September 8, 2021, the drug laboratory reported that his sample tested positive
for cocaine with a confirmation level of 402 ng/ml. The cutoff was 100 ng/ml. (Items 4, 5)

Criminal Conduct  and Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  that  Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force  in
January  2022  for  illegal  use  of  a  controlled  substance.  SOR  ¶  2.b  cross-alleges  the
information  in  SOR  ¶  1.a,  above.  Applicant  admitted  both  of  these  allegations  in  his
SOR Answer.
SOR ¶ 3.a cross-alleges the information in SOR ¶ 1.a, above.
Following up on the report of Applicant testing positive for cocaine, the Air Force
Security  Forces  Squadron  conducted  an  investigation.  The  investigation  revealed  that
Applicant  wrongfully  used  a  controlled  substance  in  violation  of  Article  112a,  Uniform
Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ).  (Items  6,  10)  Applicant’s  commander  imposed
nonjudicial punishment, pursuant to Article 15, UCMJ, on September 22, 2021, reducing
him from staff sergeant (pay grade E-5) to senior airman (pay grade E-4), and ordered

Applicant  submitted  two  reference  letters:  (1)  a  civilian  co-worker  who  worked
with  Applicant  in  the  base  contracting  office  from  December  2020  to  October  2021
(letter dated October 25, 2021); and (2) an active duty Air Force master sergeant, who
worked with Applicant in an overseas location from December 2019 to November 2020
(letter dated October 22, 2021). Both individuals spoke highly of Applicant’s work ethic,
dedication, and professionalism. These letters were submitted in support of Applicant to
recommend  that  he  be  retained  in  the  Air  Force  when  he  was  pending  disciplinary
proceedings in 2021. (Item 2)
Applicant’s  SOR  Answer  contained  a  personal  statement.  In  that  statement,  he
accepts full responsibility for his error in judgment in using cocaine. He stated  that his
ADAPT was successful and taught him coping mechanisms to deal with stress and not
to resort to binge drinking. He added that since his discharge from the Air Force, he has
strong  family  support  in  the  form  of  his  two  older  brothers.  He  lives  with  his  oldest
brother  and  spends  time  with  his  other  brother.  Both  brothers  have  Top  Secret

encouraging  him  to  finish  his  bachelor’s  degree  and  to  pursue  his  goals  in  spite  of

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  allegations  of  drug
involvement in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c. He stated that he “technically” admitted the allegation of
falsification in SOR ¶ 2.a, but he denied intending to deceive. I have treated his answer
to SOR ¶ 2.a as a denial. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  information  technology  technician  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  since  June  2021.  His  work  site  is  on  a  military  installation,  and  he
has access to classified information.1 He received a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice
in  December  2010  and  a  technical  certification  in  January  2019.  He  married  in  June
2016 and has no children. He has held a security clearance since March 2020. (FORM
Item 3 at 55)
1  Eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  and  actual  access  to  classified  information  are  separate
determinations.  ISCR  Case  No.  20-0311  (App.  Bd.  Aug.  10,  2022).  Applicant  admitted  in  his  answer  to
the SOR that he had actual access to classified information when he used cocaine, and he described his
duties involving classified information in FORM Item 3.
On  March  21,  2021,  Applicant  and  a  group  of  former  college  classmates
gathered  for  a  birthday  celebration  that  consisted  of  bar  hopping,  heavy  drinking,  and
snorting  cocaine.  While  walking  between  bars,  the  group  was  confronted  by  two  loud,
obnoxious,  and  aggressive  men,  resulting  in  an  affray  that  was  stopped  by  nearby
police officers. All the participants were handcuffed and transported to the police station.
When Applicant was searched by the police, they found a small quantity of cocaine in a
plastic  bag  in  his  pocket.  He  was  charged  with  participating  in  an  affray,  a
misdemeanor, and felony possession of a Schedule II controlled substance.
In  May  2021,  with  the  assistance  of  an  attorney  and  pursuant  to  a  plea
agreement, Applicant pleaded guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia. The charges
of  participating  in  an  affray  and  the  felony  drug  charges  were  dismissed.  He  was
required  to  complete  a  16-hour  program  of  drug  classes,  and  he  was  placed  on
unsupervised probation for one year. (FORM Item 3 at 50-51; FORM Item 5 at 6) During
the  ESI  in  February  2022,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  used  cocaine  in  college  as
well as on the night of the affray. (FORM Item 5 at 5.)
When  Applicant  submitted  an  SCA  in  December  2021,  he  answered  “yes”  to  a
question in Section 22—Police Record, asking whether, in the last seven years, he had
been  or  was  currently  on  probation  or parole.  He  disclosed  an  arrest  in  April  2014  for
driving  under  the  influence  (DUI),  his  conviction  in  August  2015,  and  a  sentence  that
included one year of unsupervised probation. He also disclosed his arrest in May 2021
for  the  drug  offense  and  participating  in  an  affray,  his  conviction  of  possessing
paraphernalia, and his sentence that included probation for one year.
However, Applicant answered “no” to two questions in Section 23—Illegal Use of
Drugs  or  Drug  Activity.  The  first  question  asked  if,  in  the  last  seven  years,  he  had
illegally used any drugs or controlled substances, and the second question asked if he
had ever illegally used or had otherwise been illegally involved with a drug or controlled
substance  while  possessing  a  security  clearance  other  than  previously  listed.  His
answers to the questions in Section 23 are the basis for the allegation that he falsified
his SCA.
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  he  stated  that  when  he  completed  his
SCA, it contained the answers from previous SCAs, and he updated the portion  asking
about  arrests  but  skimmed  through  the  section  asking  about  use  of  drugs.  He  stated
that during the  ESI, the  investigator went  through  each  section  of  the  SCA, and  when
they  reached  the  section  on  drug  use,  he  told  the  investigator  that  the  subject  was
addressed  in  the  section  involving  arrests.  He  told  the  investigator  that  there  were
multiple  sections  in  the  SCA  with  similar  questions,  and  he  thought  that  providing  the
information in one section was sufficient. (FORM Response at 2-3)

"Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  that  between  June  2017  and  May  2018,
Applicant  used  marijuana  approximately  300  times  while  he  had  access  to  classified
information  (SOR  1.a); and  that  during  the  same period, he  purchased marijuana  with
varying frequency while he had access to classified information (SOR 1.b). He admitted
without  comment  both  allegations.  (FORM,  Items  1  and  2)  In  addition  to  the  facts
established  by  Applicant’s  admissions,  and  based  on  my  review  of  the  information
presented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked since August 2011. He and his wife have been married since July 2010 and they
have  three  children.  He  was  first  granted  a  security  clearance  in  September  2011.
(FORM, Items 3 and 5)
Applicant first used marijuana in high school and college between September 1997
and May 2004. During this period, he smoked marijuana as often as daily, and at least
weekly, purchasing the drug from people he knew, including his brother. He stopped in
2004 because he felt he no longer needed it. He also did not want to spend money buying
marijuana when he also had to pay for his college education. (FORM, Item 4)
In 2017, marijuana became legal in the state where Applicant lives. He decided to
start using it again because it was legal under state law and because he felt it may help
with his anxiety. During a personal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator
on November 22, 2021, he estimated that he used marijuana about 300 times between
June 2017 and May 2018. He knew at that time that his use of marijuana, while having a
security  clearance,  was  “forbidden”  and  could  disqualify  him  from  access  to  sensitive
information. (FORM, Items 3 and 4)
In  May  2018,  Applicant  checked  himself  into  a  hospital  for  treatment  of  severe
anxiety, depression, and related behavioral problems. He believes his extensive use of
marijuana  over  the  previous  year  had  altered  his  brain  chemistry  and  caused  him  to
behave erratically towards his wife. Applicant no longer experiences the behavioral issues
that  he  believes  were  caused  or  exacerbated  by  his  marijuana  use.  He  has  not  used
marijuana or any other illegal substance since May 2018. (FORM, Item 4)
The summary of his PSI reported that Applicant did not disclose his drug use to
his employer’s security office; however, in response to DOHA interrogatories, he averred
that after he was hospitalized in 2018, he was asked to submit “a preemptive SF 86” in
which  he  disclosed  his  drug  use  while  cleared.  He  also  reported  his  drug  use  in  his
September 2021 e-QIP. (FORM, Item 4)
Applicant no longer associates with the people with whom he used marijuana. In
his  e-QIP,  in  his  PSI,  and  in  his  notarized  response  to  interrogatories,  he  stated  his
intention to abstain from any future use of marijuana. (FORM, Items 3 and 4)
Sua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I
controlled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal
law.  Guidance  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  (OASD)  in
February  2013,  which  was  updated  by  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (DNI)  in
December  2021,  makes  clear  that  changes  in  the  laws  pertaining  to  marijuana  by  the
various states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the  current National
Security  Adjudicative  Guidelines.  Because  federal  law  supersedes  state  laws  on  this
issue, Applicant’s use of marijuana, regardless of location or medical justification  in  his
state  of  residence,  was  illegal.  Further,  federal  workplaces  prohibit  illegal  drug  use  by
civilian federal employees and by persons employed for work on federal contracts.

February  2020  to  July  2021.  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  He  used  the  inhalant,  also  known  as
“whippets,”  recreationally  approximately  four  to  five  times  over  the  course  of  several
months.  He  used  it  with  his  stepbrother,  who  purchased  it.  It  made  him  feel  semi-
euphoric. (Items 1-5)
Applicant stated in his SCA and indicated during his background interview that he
may  use  marijuana  again  if  it  becomes  legal  under  federal  law.  He  stated  in  his  May
2022  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  “I  do  not  find  myself  in  a  situation  where  I
would  want  to  use  this  drug  [nitrous  oxide]  in  the  future.”  He  indicated  during  his
background  interview that  he did  not  currently  use  illegal drugs  or misuse  prescription
drugs, but that he might use drugs again if they became legal. He indicated that he did
not socialize with individuals who use drugs illegally. (Items 4-5)

At the hearing, Applicant admitted he ingests marijuana using a vape device on an
almost  daily  basis,  and  he  used  it  the  night  before  the  hearing.  He  uses  marijuana
because it helps him tolerate food, and he uses it as a sleep aid. He intends to continue
to use marijuana in this manner and with this frequency, notwithstanding its impact on his
clearance  eligibility.  He  has  not  disclosed  his  marijuana  use  to  anyone  other  than  his
physicians  and  his  father.  Additionally,  no  one  at  his  company  is aware  of  his  past  or
ongoing use of marijuana. He first used marijuana recreationally in 2005. He did not use
it  between  2005  and  2012.  In  approximately  2012,  he  obtained  a  medical  marijuana

In  January  2017,  Applicant  certified  and  submitted  his
first  Electronic
Questionnaire  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP).  Under  Section  23,  he  responded
“NO” to the following query, “In the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs
or controlled substances?” (Tr. 106-107; GE 2)
In  July  2018,  Applicant  certified  and  submitted  a  Standard  Form  (SF)  85P  for
Public Trust Positions. Under question 10, he responded “NO” to the following query, “In
the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances?” The
SOR did not allege that Applicant falsified this document, and his response will not be
considered disqualifying conduct. (Tr. 107-108; GE 3)
In  June  2020,  Applicant  completed  a  second  e-QIP,  and  under  Section  23,  he
disclosed  that  between  June  2005  and  June  2020,  he  had  used  “THC,  (Such  as
marijuana,  weed,  pot,  hashish,  etc.”  His  use  was  related  to  treating  conditions  and
symptoms  for  a  medical  condition.  Additionally,  he  stated,  “There  are  virtually  no
medications that help with the symptoms I experience. I have an extensive medical record
trying  existing  medications, I have  made  many changes [to] my diet  and  continue  to  work
with my medical doctor to improve my condition so that I many discontinue use.” (GE  1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  August  2020.  He
confirmed  that  the  information  he  disclosed  in  his  2020  e-QIP  regarding  his  drug  was
accurate. Additionally, he stated that he intended to continue to use marijuana to alleviate
the  symptoms  of  his  medical  condition.  He  claimed  he  obtained  marijuana  through  a
prescription from his physician. (GE 4)
In Applicant’s Answer, he admitted to deliberately omitting or falsifying information
about  his  illegal  drug  use  on  his  January  2017  e-QIP  but  provided  no  explanation.
However, at the hearing, he testified that he did not disclose his marijuana use in his 2017
e-QIP and 2018 SF 85P, because he considered his use of marijuana to be legal under
applicable state laws, and he was not intentionally trying to hide it. He disclosed marijuana
use in his 2020 e-QIP, because he was under the impression, at that time, that because
he was required to sign a medical release form through his employer, his company was
going to be able to review his medical records and would learn that he was using medical
marijuana. (Tr. 76-81, 108-110; GE 1-3)
After  the   SOR  was   issued,  Applicant  did  not  approach   his  physicians  for  legal
medical  alternatives  for  his  illegal  marijuana   use.   When   questioned   at   the   hearing
regarding  his company’s policy regarding  drug  use, he  responded, “I can’t think of what it
is, recite  it off  the  top of my head, but I’m pretty sure that they  don’t want you  [to] do  any
illegal drugs.” When  asked  to  clarify if his company considers  marijuana  to  be  an  illegal
drug,  he   responded,  “I’m   not  sure  if  they  do   or  not.”  He  did  not  ask  for  clarification,
because  it is his medical information. He is not subject to drug  testing  at work.  (Tr. 111-
112, 120)
Applicant testified that he is aware that marijuana use is illegal under federal law,
and  the  following  dialogue  at  the  hearing  indicates  he  is  fully  aware  that  his  use  of
marijuana is prohibited by DOD regulations for individuals holding public trust positions.
Applicant’s Attorney: Have you ever used marijuana with anybody at work?
Applicant: No.
Applicant’s Attorney: Has it ever come  up  as a  topic any time, anywhere for
any reason?
Applicant: Absolutely not, Jesus Christ.
Applicant’s Attorney: Okay
Applicant: I like having my job.
Applicant’s Counsel:  [Y]ou  felt  it was  appropriate  and  go  ahead  and  disclose
your medical use?
Applicant: I didn’t think I had much of a choice. (Tr. 78-79)
At  the  hearing,  an  expert  witness  (EW)  testified  regarding  the  use  of  cannabis
medicine  or  medical  marijuana.  He  is  a  physician,  specializing  in  palliative  care  and
rehabilitative medicine, and he has a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in medical geography.
According to EW, marijuana use should be decriminalized, and it should no longer be a
Schedule  I  drug,  despite  its  federal  classification,  as  it  has  it  has  medicinal  benefits.
Medical  marijuana  was  legalized  in  Applicant’s  state  of  residence  in  1999,  and  its
recreational use was legalized in 2012. (Tr. 29-70; AE A; AE B)
EW   does   not  treat  Applicant,  nor  has   Applicant  ever  been   his   patient.   EW
conducted a “mostly” remote telephonic 73-minute  examination  of Applicant, a  couple of
follow-up   calls,   and   reviewed   Applicant’s   medical  record   from   August  2015   and   his
prescription  history detailed  in AE  C. Based  upon  these  data  points,  WE  concluded  that
Applicant  has  a   “diagnosable  condition   that   could  and   would   potentially  benefit  from
medical cannabis use”  to  wit,  gastroparesis,  as there are  limited  prescriptions available
to  treat this affliction, and  Applicant has not tolerated  them  well. WE  testified  that he  does
not believe  that  Applicant’s use of medical marijuana  affects his trustworthiness.  (Tr. 30-
70; AE A-C)
Applicant  presented  briefs  regarding  the  historical  laws  criminalizing  the  use  of
marijuana; the medical use of marijuana; the legalization of marijuana by various states;
the  medical  necessity  defense;  marijuana’s  status  as  a  Schedule  I  drug;  and  three
Attorney General memos from 2009 to 2013 regarding the enforcement of the Controlled
Substances Act concerning marijuana. (AE D-H; See also GE 5)
Applicant does not feel that his marijuana use affects his ability to be trustworthy
or  his  job  performance,  which  has  been  “usually  above  satisfactory.”  He  is  currently
managing  “an entire group” which consists of approximately 27 workers. He enjoys his
job and wants to continue to work for his company. (Tr. 73, 87-94)

"Applicant  is  28  years  old  and  a  high  school  graduate  (2013).  He  attended
community college for about three months in the fall of 2013.  He married in April 2018
and has one child, a daughter age four. He purchased a home in November 2019. From
September  2015  to  March  2021,  he  worked  as  a  support  engineer  for  a  large  cloud
computing  company.  Since  March  2021.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  data  center
technician  for  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  never  held  a  clearance.  (Item  3  and

The SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) used marijuana with varying frequency from
about  November  2010  until  at  least  October  2020;  and  (2)  purchased  marijuana  with
varying  frequency  from  about  November  2010  until  about  October  2020.  (Item  1.)
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. (Item 2.)
In  his  July  7,  2021  Personal  Subject  Interview  (PSI),  Applicant  described  his
marijuana use from November 2010 to October 2020. His use was experimental and to
be sociable. He used with a friend, AA, at another friend’s house. The drug was obtained
by AA. He only bought marijuana once, and that was from AA.  AA still used drugs but
Applicant did not know which drugs or in what amounts. The marijuana made him feel
relaxed but had no impact on  his personality, judgment, reliability, work, or friends. He
had no intent to use illegal drugs in the future. He was not dependent on marijuana. (Item
4.)
Applicant described his LSD use from March 2015 to May 2017. He used LSD as
an experiment after seeing a movie. He used it twice, with his friend, AA, who obtained it.
It made him feel anxious and uncomfortable.  The use took place once at a hotel room
and once  at a college dorm but had no impact on his personality, judgment, reliability,
work, or friends. He has no intent to use illegal drugs in the future. He was not dependent
on LSD. (Item 4.)
In his PSI, Applicant described his cocaine use in July 2016. He used it once. He
used it with a friend, BB, at a bar. BB obtained it. It made him feel hung over but had no
impact on his personality, judgment, reliability, work, or friends. He had no intent to use
illegal drugs in the future. He is not dependent on cocaine. (Item 4.)
AA  is one  of Applicant’s friends from  high  school. They now live  in different and
not adjacent states. They text and play games “every once and a while.”  He stated: “But
we don’t see  each  other every other month. Only when  my family and  I  come visit my
parents in [AA’s state] or when [AA] comes to [Applicant’s state] to visit. So we only see
each other 2-5 times a year.” BB was a friend from middle school through high school.
They drifted apart. They text or talk to each other perhaps once a year. (Item 4.)
In Applicant’s May 24, 2022 response to a DOHA Interrogatory asking the last time
he used marijuana, he said: “I genuinely can’t remember the last time I used marijuana
or a THC product. It’s been about 2 years now. 10/2020 would be a rough guess as to
the last time.” (Item 4.) In his Response, he stated that “it’s been almost 3 years since I
used any THC/Marijuana product.”  (Item 4.) In his Response to the FORM, he stated his
regret for his past use of marijuana and also emphasized that he is now a husband, a
father, and the primary provider for his family.
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
Discussion
Under Adjudicative Guideline (AG) H, suitability of an applicant may be questioned
or put into doubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about
a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG ¶¶ 24, 25,
and 26 set forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions.
The illegal use  of controlled substances, to include the  misuse of prescription
and   non-prescription   drugs,  and   the   use   of  other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental  impairment or are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent with  their
intended   purpose   can   raise   questions  about  an   individual's  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both   because   such   behavior  may  lead   to   physical  or
psychological  impairment   and   because   it  raises  questions  about   a   person's
ability  or  willingness  to   comply  with   laws,  rules,  and   regulations.  Controlled
substance   means  any   ""controlled   substance""   as  defined   in  21   U.S.C.  802.
Substance  misuse  is the  generic term  adopted  in this guideline  to  describe  any
of the  behaviors listed  above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying
conditions:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and
AG ¶  25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including
cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or
possession of drug paraphernalia.
Applicant admitted to purchasing marijuana (once, from AA) and using marijuana
from November 2010 to October 2020. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to an
SOR require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App.
Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) AG ¶¶ 25(a) and (c) apply.
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated
by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. § 811 et seq.
The knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and
punishable  by  imprisonment,  a  fine  or  both. 21  U.S.C.  §  844.  In  an  October  25,  2014
memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is
a security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum:
Adherence  to  Federal  Laws  Prohibiting  Marijuana  Use  (October  25,  2014).  See  also
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml.
More recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed
the  memorandum, Security Executive  Agent Clarifying  Guidance  Concerning  Marijuana
for Agencies Conducting  Adjudications of Persons Proposed  for Eligibility for Access to
Classified  Information  or Eligibility to  Hold a  Sensitive  Position.  It  emphasizes  that  federal
law  remains   unchanged   with   respect   to   the   illegal  use,  possession,  production,  and
distribution  of marijuana. Individuals who  hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited   by  law  from   using   controlled   substances.  Disregard  of  federal  law
pertaining to  marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana  use) remains relevant,  but
not determinative,  to  adjudications of eligibility.  Agencies  are  required  to use  the  “whole-
person   concept”  stated   under  SEAD  4,  to   determine   whether  the   applicant’s  behavior
raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
I have also considered the following mitigating conditions under AG H:
AG  ¶ 26(a) the  behavior happened  so  long  ago, was so  infrequent, or
occurred  under such  circumstances that it is unlikely  to  recur and  does
not cast  doubt on  the individual's  current reliability, trustworthiness, or
good judgment; and
AG  ¶ 26(b) the  individual  acknowledges  his  or her  drug  involvement and
substance   misuse,   provides  evidence   of  actions  taken   to   overcome   this
problem,  and   has  established   a   pattern  of  abstinence,  including   but  not
limited to:
(1)  disassociation from  drug-using associates and contacts;
(2)   changing  or avoiding  the environment where  drugs were used: and
(3)  providing  a signed statement of intent to  abstain from all future drug
involvement and substance  misuse, acknowledging that any future
involvement or misuse  is grounds for revocation of national security
eligibility.
Under AG ¶  25(a), Applicant’s marijuana  use  started  in November 2010, which  is
quite  long  ago. It  continued, however until October 2020. So  it did recur during  that 10-
year  period   and   ended   quite   recently.  Therefore,  Applicant’s  illegal  drug   usage   is  not
mitigated  by AG ¶  25(a).
The  key under mitigating  factor AG ¶  26(b) is the  “pattern  of  abstinence.” Subparts
(1) through  (3) are simply nonexclusive  examples of how such  a  pattern may be  shown.
It  seems  that  certain  changes in  Applicant’s  life  have  operated  to  disassociate  him  from
his former drug-using  friends. In  particular, he  and AA now live  in different, not  adjacent,
states  and  see  each  other only several times a  year. Similarly, he  is now a  homeowner,
married,  and the father of  a four-year old  child. So, the former drug-using environment is
no  more.  These are all salutary changes.
Here,  the  “pattern  of  abstinence”  must  be  weighed  against  a  lengthy  period  of
marijuana use. Applicant began his marijuana use in high school in 2020, not a particularly
unusual time or place for that to happen. He did, however, continue that recreational use
until  about  October  2020,  by  his  own  estimate.  He  claimed  he  is  not  dependent  on
marijuana  and  has  no  intent  to  use  it  in  the  future.  There  is nothing  in  the  record  that
contradicts  his  representations.  But  his  10  years  of  prior  marijuana  use  outweigh  his
recent  few  years  of  abstinence.  This  is  not  to  minimize  his  current  track  record  of
abstinence; it is commendable. If he continues on his present path, he could be a worthy
candidate  for  reapplication.  At  this  point,  however,  it  is  not  sufficient  to  mitigate  his
extended history of marijuana use. I must find against him on SOR ¶ 1.
I  find  that  Applicant’s  one-time  use  of  cocaine  and  his  twice-use  of  LSD do  not
raise national security concerns.
The  record raises doubts about  Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment,
and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1) through (9) and 2(f)(1) through (6).  Accordingly, I conclude that
Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In  light of the record as  a whole, it is not clearly  consistent with the  interests of
national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is denied.

"Applicant  admitted  the  three  SOR  allegations  contained  in  SOR  Paragraph  1,
without further elaboration or explanation. (Item 3) Her admissions are incorporated into
these findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. She is unmarried and has no children. She earned a high
school diploma in June 2010 and has taken some community college courses. She has
no record of military or federal civil service, and has never held a security clearance. She
is sponsored to seek national security eligibility in connection with possibly obtaining a
position at a professional services Government contracting company. (Items 2, 4.)
Applicant completed her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing
(e-QIP) on January 21, 2022. In response to questions in Section 23 regarding illegal use
of  drugs  or  drug  activity,  she  disclosed
illegally  used
THC/marijuana/cannabis from January 2010 to January 2021, at which point she obtained
a  Medical  Cannabis  Card  from  her  state  and  continued  “legally”  using  it  until  January
2022. She further declared that she intended to continue using the drug in the future, and
tended to use it only when she had trouble sleeping or eating. (Item 4.)
that  she  had
On April 26, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Office of
Personnel  Management  (OPM).  She  confirmed  the  accuracy  of  her  e-QIP  statements
concerning drug use, and added that she had been spending about $150 per month on
marijuana or THC vaping products until January 2022, and smoking several times each
week. She said that she stopped purchasing and using medical marijuana at that point
since she was unsure how it would affect her pending job application and national security
eligibility.  She  said  she  had  purchased  marijuana  from  licensed  dispensaries  after
obtaining her Card in January 2021, and illegally obtained it from friends, acquaintances,
or off the street before that. Once she started buying medical marijuana, her association
and contact with many of those acquaintances became less frequent. (Item 5.)
Applicant  also  said  that  her  present  employer  is  aware  of  her  use  of  medical
marijuana since she tested positive on a February 2021 random drug test. She expressed
to  the  OPM  investigator  that  she  would  like  to  go  back  to  using  medical  marijuana
because  it  benefits  her  health  greatly,  but  she  would  also  like  to  secure  her  pending
employment with the Federal contractor. She said that if the employer prohibits medical
marijuana use even with her state-issued Card, then she would not be engaged with it
any longer and would have to find alternatives to assist with her health concerns.  (Item
5.)
The record contains no evidence concerning Applicant’s recent job performance,
trustworthiness,  character  in  a  professional  setting,  or  track  record  with  respect  to
handling sensitive information and observation of job-related security procedures. There
is  no  indication  that  she  was  ever  evaluated  for,  or  diagnosed  with,  a  substance  use
disorder, or participated in a treatment program. I was unable to evaluate her credibility,
demeanor, or character in person, since she elected to have her case decided without a
hearing.

varying  frequency  from  January  2003  to  October  2022.  His  admission  is  incorporated
into  the  findings  of  fact.  (Item  2)  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings
and Items submitted, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  31  years old.  He  earned  a  General  Education  Development  (GED)
certificate in 2008 and a Certificate of Electrical Technician in 2010. He is divorced and
has two children, ages 12 and 15. He and his girlfriend have lived together since 2020.
In  August  2020,  he  started  a  position  with  his  current  employer, a  defense  contractor.
Previously,  he  worked  from  August  2012  to  August  2020  for  a  different  defense
contractor. In April 2022, he completed his first security clearance application (SCA). In
May 2022, he was granted an interim secret security clearance. (Items 3, 6)
In  June  2022,  a  government  investigator  interviewed  Applicant.  During  that
interview, Applicant disclosed that  he started using marijuana  in 2002 when he was in
eighth grade. He used it with friends and has continued to use it since then. He uses it
every other day or twice a week to help him sleep, relax, or relieve a headache. He said
he did not disclose this information in his SCA  because marijuana is legal in his home
state. When he turned 18 in 2006, he began purchasing marijuana at a dispensary with
the  medical  marijuana  card  he  obtained  for  headaches.  He  also  purchases  it  from
friends. He said marijuana does not affect his personality or judgment. (Item 4)
While  discussing  Applicant’s  history  of  marijuana  use,  the  investigator  informed
him  that  using  marijuana  is  considered  an  illegal  drug  for  purposes  of  a  security
clearance. Applicant told the investigator that he intended to continue using it. (Item 4 at
3)
In  November  2022,  Applicant  completed  interrogatories  regarding  his  history  of
marijuana use. He estimated that he started using it in January 2003 and used it once a
week or more up to October 16, 2022. He stated he did not intend to use it in the future
because having a security clearance  was more important than smoking marijuana. He
did not want to miss an opportunity to obtain a security clearance. (Item 5)

Applicant  used  marijuana  approximately  twice  monthly  from  May  2020  to  April
2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. She maintained  that she did not use marijuana
recreationally, but to manage her anxiety from the impact the pandemic had on her, her
family,  and  her  employment.  She  did  not  find  her  prescription  medication  helpful  in
managing her anxiety, and she did not want to go through the process of seeking medical
help during the pandemic. She used marijuana in edible form at night as a sleep aid. Her
spouse obtained it from his mother, who had a medical marijuana card in state A, or he
purchased it from a legal marijuana dispensary  when they visited family and friends  in
state C. She stopped using marijuana in April 2021, when she received her COVID-19
vaccination. (Answer; Tr. at 17-47, 49-65, 68-70; GE 1-3; AE A)
Applicant acknowledged that her decision to use marijuana to manage her anxiety
was  a  bad  one.  She  understood  that  her  use  of  marijuana  while  holding  a  security
clearance was unwise, against the rules, and jeopardized her ability to continue to hold a
clearance.  She  self-reported  her  marijuana  use  on  her  May  2021  security  clearance
application and she discussed it during her July 2021 background interview. (Answer; Tr.

Applicant  has  no  future  intention  to  use  marijuana  or  other  illegal  drugs.  She
sought medical help with managing her anxiety in state B in February 2022, and she has
since been under her doctor’s care for anxiety and insomnia. Her doctor prescribed her a
different medication for managing her anxiety and helping her sleep. She also exercises
and has developed hobbies to further manage her anxiety. She and her spouse do not
have  any  marijuana  in  their  home.  She  indicated  during  her  July  2021  background
interview that she had never tested positive for illegal drugs. She  is subject to random
drug  testing by her employer. As of  the date  of the  hearing, her employer had not yet
selected her to report for such a test. In March 2022, she signed a statement of intent not
to illegally use any drugs, to include marijuana, and that any violation would be grounds
for automatic revocation of her security clearance. (Answer; Tr. at 17-47, 63-68; GE 1-3;
AE A)
Applicant provided letters of support from her spouse as well as three friends she
has  known  for  over  10  years.  Each  of  them  attested  to  her  trustworthiness,  integrity,
reliability, and judgment. Her employer has favorably rated her performance annually and
has awarded her for her performance in 2020 and 2021. As of the date of the hearing,
she  was  in  a  pool  of  candidates  for  promotions  for  management  and  director-level
positions. (Answer; Tr. at 68-70; AE A)

"Applicant  is  38  years  old,  married,  and  has  four  minor  children.  He  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in 2007. He is currently employed by a  private company, and he has
been offered a position as an engineer with a Government contractor, which is sponsoring
him to apply for a security clearance. He has held a security clearance in the past, and
he is seeking to renew his eligibility for a security clearance in relation to his prospective
employment. (Tr. at 12-20.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
In  this  paragraph  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  engaged  in  conduct
involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  an  unwillingness  to
comply  with  rules  and  regulations,  which  raise  questions  about  his  reliability,
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. The details of the
allegations are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a. December 2020 Employment Termination. The Government alleged
that Applicant  was terminated from his employment  in December 2020  after he  tested
positive for THC during a random drug test on October 20, 2020.
In January 2020, Applicant began working for Company A in State 1. He claimed
he was surprised that he tested positive for THC in October 2020 because he does not
use marijuana or any cannabis product. He testified that a few days prior to the drug test,
he had experimented using CBD oil for the first time. He had migraine headaches, and a
co-worker, or “a few co-workers,” had suggested that CBD oil had helped her/them with
migraines. He used the CBD oil two or three times during the week prior to the drug test,
including the night before the test. He concluded that the CBD oil must have contained
THC. He claimed he was unaware that the CBD oil contained THC when he used it. (Tr.
at 26-33, 67-68.)
Applicant testified that his wife had purchased the CBD oil for her medical condition
when they lived in State 2. In that state, marijuana and CBD oil with THC could be legally
purchased. He testified that he  was aware that some CBD oils sold in State 2 contain
THC. When Applicant and his family moved from State 2 to State 1 in about August 2019,
Applicant claimed that the CBD oil was in a box that moved with them. He claimed that
after his positive drug test he inspected his wife’s bottle of CBD oil. The label provided no
indication that the CBD oil contained any THC. (Tr. at 26-33, 67-68.)
In support of his case, Applicant submitted a letter from his long-time psychiatrist
in State 2. The psychiatrist wrote that he believed Applicant’s explanation for the positive
drug  test.  He  also  wrote  that  Applicant  was  a  trustworthy  and  compliant  patient.  He
provided  a  comment  that  directly  contradicted  Applicant’s  testimony  of  his history  with
CBD oil. He stated:
Prior to moving to [State 1] he reported to me in an office visit that he had
some success with CBD for his migraines that had worsened when his son
was apparently molested in the school he was attending.
AE W at 1-2. The psychiatrist also wrote, “Apparently the CBD oil he had purchased in
[State 2] was not pure CBD and had some THC in it as well.” AE W at 1.
Applicant explained to his employer over the phone that he did not use marijuana
and that the test results were due to his accidental ingestion of THC when he used CBD
oil not knowing that the oil contained THC. Applicant claimed that his employer was not
interested in the details of his explanation for his positive drug test. Applicant did not offer
to show his employer the CBD oil bottle or even to send his supervisor a picture of the
label as evidence of his lack of knowledge about the contents of the oil. He testified that
he threw the bottle away because he did not want to keep it in his home. (Tr. at 26-35.
67-68.)
After  the  positive  drug  test,  Company  A  put  Applicant  on  unpaid  administrative
leave, but agreed to give him the opportunity to remain with the company by signing a
Last Clear Chance Agreement (LCCA) (AE A). Under the LCCA Applicant was required
to complete substance abuse counseling. He met with his employer’s drug counselor and
explained why he thought he tested positive for THC. The counselor accepted Applicant’s
explanation and issued a letter to Company A, dated November 2, 2020 (AE B), in which
the counselor commented that he had provided drug counseling and concluded that no
formal  drug  treatment  or  additional  counseling  was  necessary.  The  letter  stated  that
Applicant can return to work once he provides a negative drug test result to Company A.
(Tr. at 36-38; AE A; AE B.)
Applicant’s  supervisor  repeated  that  he  could  return  to  work  once  he  provided
evidence of a negative drug test. The supervisor instructed Applicant that he would then
take a second test at the on-site medical facility Company A used for drug tests. Applicant
claimed  that  the  required  protocol  was  not  really  laid  out  for  him,  but  then  he  testified
about exactly what the LCCA and his supervisor required. (Tr. at 36-38.)
Applicant purchased an at-home drug test that produced a pass or fail test result.
Company A rejected the test result and insisted that Applicant go to a testing facility and
take a controlled drug test. He claimed he did not know that his employer would reject a
home test. He claimed the process “was really confusing.” He wanted his employer to tell
him where to get tested, and the company’s response was for him to find a testing facility
using Google, which he eventually did. In his testimony, he repeatedly claimed that it was
complicated to get tested in his rural environment. Nine days after the November 2, 2020
letter, he finally found a local testing place, but it was closed for Veteran’s Day. He went
to another local testing facility and was tested. A mistake was made, and the specimen
label was a mismatch. (AE D) The test needed to be redone. He retested and received a
negative drug test on November 25, 2020 (AE E). On December 10, 2020, he wrote to
his supervisor at Company A and asked if the company had everything it needed (AE F).
(Tr. at 33-47, 49, 53-55; AE A through AE F; Post-Hearing Statement at 2.)
After all of the explanations for his delays, Applicant agreed he could have handled
finding a testing facility better. He kept repeating how difficult it was because he lived in
a rural area, but he also acknowledged he could have driven to a city and been tested
there. He testified that during the intervening time, he bought several more at home drug
tests because he did not want to have a surprise and to get a bad test result in a controlled
lab test. (Tr. at 41-43.)
Company A provided the Government a different set of facts from which Company
A  concluded that  Applicant  was not being  truthful when he provided  information to  his
supervisor, the Company A medical facility, and during a subsequent investigation. The
difference  had  to  do  with  the  timelines  Applicant  provided  to  the  company  about  a
complicated history of his attempts to get a simple drug test completed in a timely fashion.
Company A was also concerned about inconsistent statements Applicant made during a
phone interview with Applicant on or about November 18, 2020, regarding his attempts
to obtain a drug test. Applicant described this interview “as more of an interrogation that
I was blindsided with” and was unprepared to answer the questions of the representatives
of Company A. The questions dealt with his attempts to get drug tested during the 16-day
period  from  the  drug  counselor’s  November  2,  2022  letter  to  November  18,  2022.  He
provided one timeline on the phone and then a second timeline in writing. (GE 3 at 1, 5,
12-13.)
In Applicant’s  Post-Hearing Statement, he admitted that he misspoke during his
interview with  Company  A  about  the  timeline  of his activities  during  the  preceding  two
weeks.  He  blamed  his  errors  on  his  lack  of  opportunity  to  prepare  for  the  interview.
Company  A  terminated  Applicant  by  phone  on  or  about  December  14,  2020,  and  the
parties signed a Separation Agreement, dated  January 12, 2021. (GE 3 at 1, 5, 11-13,
22-28; Post Hearing Statement at 4.)
Applicant’s  testimony  about  his  attempts  to  be  tested  in  November  2020  was
similarly confusing and unconvincing, creating the overall impression that Applicant was
attempting to delay his drug test in the first half of November 2020  after having tested
positive for THC on October 20, 2020. His testimony lacked credibility in all key respects.
SOR  ¶  1.b.  Falsification  in  March  2021  e-QIP;  Amendment  to  the  SOR.
Applicant  failed  to  disclose  in  his  e-QIP  that  Company  A  terminated  him  in  December
2020, about three months earlier. Section 13A of the e-QIP asked for Applicant to provide
the  “Reason  for  Leaving”  his  employment  at  Company  A.  He  misleadingly  wrote  in
response:  “Presented  with  the  opportunity  to  work  again  for  the  Navy  as  a  [specific
position.]” A follow-up question in the e-QIP asked with respect to this employment, “Have
any of the following happened to you[:] “Fired; Quit after being told you would be fired;
Left  by  mutual  agreement  following  charges  or  allegations  of  misconduct;  or  Left  by
mutual  agreement  following  notice  of  unsatisfactory  performance?”  Applicant  falsely
answered this question, “No.”
Applicant testified that his errors in responding to the two e-QIP questions were
“inadvertent.” He explained that his comment in the e-QIP about the job opportunity with
the  Navy  was  merely  draft  language  he  used  as  a  “placeholder”  in  the  form  while  he
consulted with his attorney about how to respond to the question. The attorney did not
respond to Applicant’s email. He signed and submitted the e-QIP with the draft language
unchanged. He testified that he was impatient to get the application submitted and made
a mistake. He did not satisfactorily explain his negative answer to the second question
about being fired. (Tr. at 55.)
In his Post-Hearing Statement, he provided another reason for wanting to discuss
with an attorney his response to this question. He claimed that he felt he needed legal
advice on whether he could disclose the termination under the terms of his Severance
Agreement, which included a confidentiality clause. The confidentiality clause in Section
8 of the Severance Agreement contains exceptions, including “anyone having a need to
know  the  contents  of  the  Agreement[.]”  Also,  the  last  paragraph  of  the  Confidentiality
section of the Agreement makes it clear that Company  A did not want Applicant to tell
anyone he received a financial package as part of his severance. The protection sought
by Company A in the Confidentiality Section was not addressed to the question whether
Applicant  had  been  terminated,  since  the  confidentiality  language  was  in  a  severance
agreement. Among all of the numerous documents provided by Applicant both before and
after the  hearing,  he  did  not  include  his email  to  his attorney.  Also,  Applicant  failed  to
mention his termination from Company A during his initial security interview on April 28,
2021. When questioned about his termination in a follow-up interview, he provided this
same  excuse  to  the  Government  investigator  as  he  gave  at  the  hearing  regarding  the
Navy position language just to serve as a placeholder while he completed the rest of the
form. (GE 2 at 3-5, 5-6; Post-Hearing Statement at 5.)
Applicant  also  maintains  that  he  was  never  told  by  Company  A  why  he  was
terminated. Accordingly, he argued in his Post-Hearing Statement that “I was not under
the impression that my severance with [Company A] [was] a result of being fired and/or
left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct.” He claims his
“No” answer to the e-QIP question regarding the end of his employment with Company A
was accurate. This information is contradicted by his acknowledgement in his follow-up
security  interview  on  June  25,  2021.  In  that  interview  he  discussed  his  termination  by
Company A. He advised the Government investigator that he was called on December
14,  2020,  by  a  Company  A  human  resources  representative  and  advised  that  he  was
being terminated. He reported that he was told that his termination was related to incorrect
dates and information he provided to the company regarding his drug tests in November
2020. (GE 2 at 5, 7; Post-Hearing Statement at 6; Amendment Response at 2.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant’s illegal drug use raised
questions about his reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead
to physical or psychological impairment and because it raised questions about his ability
or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  The  details  regarding  this
allegation are as follows:
SOR ¶ 2.a. Positive Drug Test. The Government alleged that in or about October
2020, Applicant tested positive for THC in a  random  employer-administered urinalysis.
Applicant admitted this allegation in his Answer with an explanation about his use of his
wife’s CBD oil without knowing that it contained THC. He explained that the presence of
THC  in  his  body  at  the  time  of  the  drug  test  was  accidental  and  merely  an  “isolated
Incident.” (Answer at 3-4.)
Paragraph 3 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
is
financially  overextended  and
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
identified  six  past-due  debts  that  have  been  charged-off  or  referred  to  collection.  The
debts total about $63,000. In his Answer, Applicant denied each of the allegations, but
asserted that two of the debts are being repaid through a payment plan arranged by a
third party, three of the debts are under negotiations, and one debt is disputed due to a
mismatch of the debt amounts. (Answer at 7.)
In  or about 2018  Applicant and  his wife  attempted  to  create  a  start-up,  defense-
contracting  business.  They  were   set up   to   commence   their   business  when   their  three-
year-old  son   was  molested   by   his  preschool  teacher.   The   family  experienced   a
“nightmare”  seeking   counseling   for  their   son   and   the   expense   of   his  treatment.   The
therapist  did  not  accept insurance  coverage, so   Applicant  had  to  pay the  medical bills.
Applicant took time  off  from  work for a  period  (March to  November 2019) to  take  care  of
his family. He  moved his family from  State  2  to a remote  part of  State  1 to  help his family
heal from  their  trauma.  Without  Applicant’s income, he  and  his wife  paid their  expenses
with  their  credit cards  and  incurred  medical  bills and  other debts that are alleged  in  the
SOR. Less  than  half of  the  debts were  incurred  in connection  with  the  start-up business
and the  rest  of the  debts were  incurred  while Applicant was not working. (Tr. at 70-76, 91-
92.)
In June 2019, Applicant sought debt counseling from a credit-counseling company
(CCC). He was advised to stop paying his debts so that CCC could negotiate payment
plans with the creditors. He followed this advice, and the debts listed in the SOR were
included  along  with  others  in  a  debt-settlement  program  undertaken  by  CCC  (the
Program).  Applicant  has  been  making  payments  of  about  $940  per  month  into  the
Program for about 41 months. (Tr. at 76-83, 92, 94; Answer.)
The current status of the debts alleged in paragraph 3 of the SOR is as follows:
SOR ¶ 3.a. Credit-Card Account Charged Off in the Approximate Amount of
$5,954. Applicant defaulted on this account in 2019. In June 2019, Applicant hired CCC,
which advised him to stop paying this account along with others, including the five other
accounts alleged in the SOR. Applicant is currently making payments on this debt through
the Program. This debt is being resolved. (Answer at 7; Tr. at 83-84, 96-97, 101; GE 1 at
50-51; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 3; AE Q at 2.)
SOR  ¶  3.b.  Unsecured-Loan  Account  Charged  Off  in  the  Approximate
Amount of $17,444. Applicant opened this account in July 2018 and defaulted on this
account in November 2019. The debt is listed in the CCC’s December 2022 status report
under  a  different  collection  agency’s  name.  The  report  evidences  that  Applicant  is
currently making payments on this debt through the Program. This debt is being resolved.
(Answer at 7; Tr. at 84-85; GE 1 at 51; GE 4 at 7, 10; AE Q at 2.)
SOR ¶ 3.c. Credit-Card Account in Collection in the Approximate Amount of
$5,870.  Applicant  defaulted  in  paying  this  account  in  2019.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
correctly stated that the amount alleged in the SOR is significantly different than the past-
due amounts shown in the Government’s credit reports. It appears from the Answer that
he is disputing this allegation. However, the CCC’s December 2022 status report reflects
that the amount of this debt is $10,787, which is the correct amount according to the credit
reports,  and  that  the  debt  was  paid  in  the  settlement  amount  of  $4,316.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Tr. at 85-86, 96-97, 99; GE 4 at 8; GE 5 at 7; GE 6 at 3; GE 8 at 1; AE Q at 1.)
SOR ¶ 3.d. Credit-Card Account in Collection in the Approximate Amount of
$9,179.  Applicant  defaulted  in  paying  this  account  in  2019.  This  debt  and  the  debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.e and 3.f, all owed to the same creditor, are to be resolved in the
future by CCC. These debts will be resolved by CCC in the future under the Program. (Tr.
at 86-87; GE 4 at 11; GE 5 at 11; AE Q at 2.)
SOR ¶ 3.e. Credit-Card Account in Collection in the Approximate Amount of
$16,851. Applicant defaulted in paying this account in 2019. See discussion in SOR ¶ 3.d,
above. (Tr. at 86-87; GE 4 at 11; GE 5 at 11; AE Q at 2.)
SOR ¶¶ 3.f. Credit-Card Account in Collection in the Approximate amount of
$7,238. Applicant defaulted in paying this account in 2019. See discussion in SOR ¶ 3.d,
above. GE 4 at 13; GE 5 at 13; AE Q at 2.)
The   December  2022   CCC  status  report  indicates  that  five   of  Applicant’s  debts
totaling  about $41,000  have  been  paid  through  the  Program. The  status report also shows
that settlements of three of the debts totaling about $30,000 are in the process of being
paid every month, and that four debts owed to the creditor, three of which are listed in
SOR  ¶¶  3.d,  3e,  and  3f,  totaling  about  $45,000  are  to  be  negotiated  and  settled  with
payments in the future. (AE Q at 1-2.)
Whole-Person and Other Mitigation Evidence
Applicant provided six character-reference letters with his Answer (Answer Att. 7
through 12) and he resubmitted the same letters with his Post-Hearing Submission (AE
H through  M).  The  letters were  prepared by friends  and  former co-workers. One  letter
was written by a retired Navy lieutenant commander, and another was written by a retired
Navy  command  master  chief.  They  all  praise  Applicant’s  character.  The  following  are
sample  comments  about  Applicant’s  character:  “impeccable  integrity;”  “devoted  family
man;”  “passionate  and  driven  person;”  “trustworthy  and  deserving  of  a  position  in
defense;”  “an  intelligent,  honest,  motivated  and  reliable  person;”  “friendly,  patient  and
outgoing;”  “reliable,  loyal,  trustworthy;”  “competent;”  “patriot;”  “hard  working;”  “strong
moral  fiber;”  “dedicated  beyond  reproach;”  and  “absolutely  deserving  of  the  security
clearance he seeks.” (AE H through M.)
As noted, Applicant also provided a letter from his psychiatrist in which the writer
expressed his view that he believed Applicant ingested THC unknowingly with CBD oil.
He  treated  Applicant  for  ten  years  and  always  found  him  to  be  trustworthy.  He  also
believes that Company A treated Applicant unfairly by terminating him. (AE W.)
Applicant also submitted copies of 13 awards that he received from the Navy and
his former employer in State 2 for his excellent work. In addition, he provided a statement
of intent in which he committed to never use illegal drugs and agreed to the automatic
revocation of his security clearance in the event that he broke his commitment. He also
submitted a June 2022 credit report and a budget of his income and expenses.  (AE N;
AE U; AE V.)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  with  explanations.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36  years old. He married  in 2005  and  divorced  in 2007. There were  no
children  from  the  marriage. He remarried  in 2015  and  divorced  in 2019. He has an  eight-
year-old  child   from   the   marriage.   He  has  custody   of   the   child.  He   is  in  a   cohabitation
relationship. He  served  in  the military from 2004  to  2011  and  was honorably discharged.
Applicant was employed  from  September 2019  until  June  2021. He  has been  employed
by a federal contractor since July  2021.  (Tr. 43-46, 70-71,74;  GE 1)
In July 2016, Applicant was charged with possession of a controlled substance,
Oxycodone. Applicant held a security clearance at the time. He testified that he did not
have access to classified information, and there is no evidence to the contrary. (Tr. 165;
GE 2)
In  February  2017,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  In
October  2019,  Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  He  was
reinterviewed in November 2019. Applicant was issued government interrogatories and
he  was  advised  to  make  corrections  or  additions  to  the  summary  of  interviews.  He
reported  updated  information  about  criminal  charges  and  an  updated  credit  report.  In
December 2020, he swore to the accuracy of the interviews. (GE 2)
During  his initial interview,  Applicant  was questioned about his  July  2016  arrest
and told the investigator that on July 2, 2016, he had traveled to Mexico for the day. While
in Mexico, he filled a prescription he had for Oxycodone and then returned home to the
United States. Upon entry into the U.S., he was questioned by Border Protection Agents
about the nature of his trip, and he informed them that it had been to refill a prescription
for Oxycodone, and he showed the agent the handwritten prescription and the pill bottle
which contained 15-20 pills. He was then met by a deputy sheriff of the local county. The
drug  was  seized,  and  Applicant  was  issued  a  citation  for  possession  of  a  controlled
substance. He showed the deputy sheriff the prescription that was obtained from a U.S.
doctor. Applicant was advised that it did not matter and was informed he would have to
appear in court. He was then released. (GE 2)
Applicant told the investigator that in August 2016 he went to the appropriate court
and was told by the clerk that no action had been taken on his citation, and he would be
contacted at a later date. He further told the investigator that as of the date of his interview
(February 2017) he had no contact with the court and did not know the status of his case.
He  said  he  did  not  report  the  misdemeanor  citation  for  possession  of  a  controlled
substance on his SCA because he did not believe he did anything wrong, was not arrested
and  had  not  had  his  day  in  court  to  prove  his  innocence.  He  did  not  believe  he  was
required to disclose it on his SCA.1 (GE 2)
During his February 2017 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he had a
prescription for Oxycodone for pain, which at the time he took lawfully and in compliance
with the prescription. He began using it sometime in January 2014, and he never abused
it.  Beginning  in  December  2016,  he  felt  like  he  was  becoming  addicted  and  sought
treatment  from a different doctor than the  one  who prescribed  it. He  was prescribed a
new  medication  for  pain  and  weaned  from  Oxycodone.  He  said  he  had  not  used
Oxycodone since January 2017. He did not believe he was addicted to it but believed he
was headed in that direction. He has not participated in drug counseling and did not have
a diagnosis of opioid addiction. (Tr. 136; GE 2)
Applicant  testified  that  he  had  a  valid  prescription  for  Oxycodone  and  took  it
according  to  the  prescription.  He  said  he  went  to  Mexico  to  have  dental  work.  Upon
returning through customs, he declared his medicine, which he said he was not taking at
the time. He showed the Border Control agent the bottle of  Oxycodone pills. It was an
older bottle and not the most current. It was confiscated, his car was searched, and he
received a citation for possession of a controlled substance. He said that he went to the
wrong courthouse and the hearing was rescheduled. (Tr. 110-115, 167-169)
In October 2017, Applicant was charged with felony importation of cocaine. During
his  November  2019  interview  by  a  government  investigator,  he  explained  that  he  had
gone to Mexico to a veterinarian to obtain vaccines for his dogs. He rented a car because
his  vehicle  had  been  recently  totaled  in  an  accident.  In  Mexico,  while  he  was  at  the
veterinarian, the vehicle was out of his sight for about three hours. After he finished at the
veterinarian, he crossed the Mexico-U.S. border on his return to the United States. His
vehicle  was  searched  and  inside  the  spare  tire  rim  16  kilos  of  cocaine  were  found.
Applicant  was arrested  and  charged  with  felony  importation of  cocaine.  He  denied the
drugs belonged to him and denied he was aware they were in the vehicle. (Tr. 115-117,
150-156; GE 3)
1  Applicant was referring to a previous SCA which was not offered into evidence.
During his November 2019 interview,  Applicant told the government investigator
that an investigation concluded that the drugs did not belong to  him, but because they
were in his vehicle, he was ultimately responsible. No investigative report was provided
that concluded the drugs did not belong to Applicant. He told the investigator that he pled
guilty to the charge to fast track his case, and it would allow him to qualify for Veteran’s
Court. In December 2017, he entered a plea of guilty to the felony importation of cocaine.
He said he believed he would have been convicted of the charge had it gone to trial. He
was incarcerated from October 2017 until approximately January or February 2018 and
then  immediately  participated  in  the  Community  Resource  and  Self-Help  Program
(CRASH)  where  he  resided  for  90  days.  This  program  is  apparently  a  prerequisite  for
participation in Veteran’s Court. (Tr. 67-69, 86-90, 115-118, 150-156)
After release from the CRASH program, while waiting to be accepted to Veteran’s
Court, Applicant was restricted from leaving the county. He violated that restriction to go
visit his son in another state. He was returned to custody in approximately October 2018.
He was in a holding facility and then federal prison from October 2018 until April 2019.
He was accepted into the  Veteran’s Court program.  In April 2019, he filed a motion to
withdraw his original plea of guilty, so he could participate in Veteran’s Court. As part of
the agreement to allow him to withdraw his plea and participate in Veteran’s Court he had
to plead guilty to the importation of cocaine charge. It was also learned that he had an
outstanding  charge  for  possession  of  a  controlled  substance  from  2016.  During  his
November 2019 interview,  he told the government  investigator that  in  August 2016  he
went to the wrong court for this charge and then he assumed the sheriff’s office chose not
to pursue the charge since no record could be found. He did not follow up on the citation.
A failure to appear warrant was issued  that he was unaware of until his October 2017
arrest. At his security clearance hearing, he said after he went to the wrong court, he was
given a new date to appear, but he failed to do so because he had been arrested and
was incarcerated at that time. He testified that the state agreed to resolve the possession
of  a  controlled  substance  citation  while  he  was  a  participant  in  Veteran’s  Court.  The
charge  was  adjudicated  by  a  different  court  through  a  diversion  program,  which  he
completed, and was dismissed in January 2021. (Tr. 118-127, 139-147-150, 159-164; GE
2)
The Veteran’s Court required that Applicant plead guilty to the charge; complete
inpatient  residence;  complete  three  urinalyses  a  week;  attend  counseling;  complete
community service; find employment; and participate in therapy. Applicant successfully
completed the program in July 2020. He testified that after three years, he can request to
have the charge expunged. Applicant provided the court document that the  importation
charge was dismissed with prejudice in July 2020. He provided a certificate of completion
for the Veterans Village Recovery Program (February 2020) and received alumni status.
This  program  is  a  one-year  inpatient  resident  program.  He  was  required  to  attend  the
required classes during the day and then he was able to get a job. Applicant completed it
in 10 months. He also provided a certificate of completion of the Veteran’s Court treatment
program from July 2020. (Tr. 127-135, 159-164; GE 2; AE C, D)
In  Applicant’s  October  2019  SCA,  he  did  not  disclose  under  Section  22  (Police
Record) or Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) that he received a citation in
July  2016  for  possession  of  a  controlled  substance.  Under  these  two  sections,  he
disclosed  the  following  regarding  his  October  2017  felony  arrest  and  charge  for
importation of cocaine: “I was traveling from Mexico into the United States on October 3,
2017. An illegal substance was found in the rental vehicle I was driving. I have not been
convicted and the charges are due to be dismissed.” (GE 1) Under Section 23 he wrote:
“I was not aware of what was in my vehicle while coming back into the United States. All
matters have been settled and I was never convicted of any crime, nor did I ever have to
pay an[y]  fines concerning  this matter.”  He said under the  reasons sections, “I used  to
live close to the border while working in [State]. I would to (sic) go down to Mexico for
better priced dental treatments.” (GE 1) He responded “yes” to the questions that asked
if  in  the  last  seven  years  he  had  been  involved  in  the  illegal  purchase,  manufacture,
cultivation,  trafficking,  production,  transfer,  shipping,  receiving,  handling  or  sale  of  any
drug or controlled substance.” (Tr 156-159; GE 1)
During  Applicant’s  November 2019  interview with  a  government investigator,  he
discussed  his October  2017  felony offense  of importation  of cocaine.  He was asked  by
the  investigator if he  had  any  other offenses to  report and  he  said “no”. He was confronted
with  his  July  2016  possession  of  a  controlled  substance   citation.  He then  explained  he
did not  know  why it  was not on  his SCA because  he  recalled  reporting  it,  but  he  could
possibly not have  saved  it correctly. He said he  had  traveled  to  Mexico to  purchase  over-
the-counter diabetes medication  for his aunt and  Oxycodone  for himself  that had  been
prescribed   and   upon  his return  to   the   United   States  he   received   the   above-mentioned
citation.   At   his  hearing,  Applicant  testified   that  he   went   to   Mexico   on   this  occasion   to
obtain  dental care.  He  was not sure why he failed to  disclose his drug offense citation on
his SCA.  He  then  said  he  did not  disclose  it because  he  did not  go  to  court and  did  not
think it  was anything serious. (Tr. 136, 138; GE 2)
In Applicant’s SCA under Section 11, which asked where he had lived, he did not
disclose  his  incarceration  from  October  2017  to  January  or  February  2018  or  his
residence in the CRASH program for 90 days. When the investigator asked him why he
failed  to  disclose  where  he  was  living,  he  explained  that  he  considered  these  to  be
transitional, or he did not consider them “residences,” and he was not required to disclose
them. He said he was not intentionally attempting to conceal this information. When asked
at his hearing why he failed to disclose the information, he testified that he did not know
why he did not disclose it. He was not the same person mentally as he is now. (Tr. 89-92;
GE 1)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. However, the information may be considered in the application
of  mitigating  conditions,  in  making  a  credibility  determination,  and in  the  whole-person
analysis.
Applicant provided a letter of intent which stated he would never misuse any illegal
substances in the future, including possession of any illegal drug or use any legal drug
without a prescription. If he violates the letter, he consented to automatic revocation of
his security clearance. He also agreed that if his charges were not dismissed in July 2023
due to his failure to meet all the requirements, he consented to automatic revocation of
his security clearance. (AE A)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  has  six  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately
$74,386. He testified these debts were incurred during his marriage, and the smaller ones
he lost track of due to life events. He disclosed on his October 2019 SCA a credit card
debt of approximately $5,000 (SOR ¶ 1.b - actual amount owed $14,923) that became
delinquent in May 2017 that he attributed to a divorce and the end of a contract that he
had been working on. He said he planned on contacting the creditor to resolve it once he
was back at work. He planned on taking the necessary steps to pay the debt in a timely
manner. He did not disclose any other delinquent debts. (Tr. 48-49, 95; GE 1)
During his November 2019 interview, Applicant acknowledged he underestimated
the amount of his credit card debt. He stated it became delinquent due to the loss of a
contract  and  because  he  was  unemployed  while  incarcerated  in  October  2017  for  the
above-mentioned drug charge. Applicant told the investigator  that he did not have any
other financial issues. He was then confronted with the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($57,793) with
the same creditor. He explained he had purchased a travel trailer with a loan from the
creditor. The original loan amount was $85,000. He was unable to pay the loan for the
same reasons stated above. He told the investigator that he contacted the creditor and
planned to make payments on the debt. He said he had started a new job and would pay
it when he was sure he was able to keep the job. He testified that he did not know why
he failed to disclose this debt on his SCA. (Tr. 96; GE 2)
In  November 2019  Applicant  acknowledged  to  the  investigator the  four remaining
debts that are alleged  in the  SOR (¶¶  1.c - $849, 1.d  - $641, 1.e  - $143, 1.f  - $37). He told
the  investigator that his finances  were  stable, he  was able and  willing  to  pay his debts,
and  he  would  not likely experience  future financial problems. In  his answer to  the  SOR,
he   provided   documents  to   show  he   paid   the   debts  in   SOR  ¶¶  1.c,   1.d,  1.e   and   1.f   in
February 2021.  He testified  that he paid  them  after he  received  the SOR. (Tr. 48-51, 79-
80; GE 2, 4, 5, 6, 7)
In  Applicant’s February 2021  answer to  the  SOR, he  said was  working  on  repaying
the  debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a  and  1.b,  and  he  was taking  all  actions required  to  restore his
credit. He testified  he  started  to  miss payments on  the  debt in  SOR ¶  1.a  in  2017.  He said
he  delayed  resolving  the  debt because  in approximately 2020  he  was  involved  in a  costly
child  custody  dispute.  At his  hearing,  he  provided  letters  dated  February 14,  2023,  from
the creditor confirming settlement offers of $26,006 for SOR ¶ 1.a  and $6,696 for SOR ¶
1.b  with  monthly  payments  of  $650  and  $270,  respectively,  for 40  months  until  June  2026.
He provided  copies of payments made  in February and  March 2023. (Tr. 52; Answer to
SOR; GE 4, 5, 6, 7;  AE B, E, F)
Applicant  testified  that  his  finances  and  job  are  stable.  After  living  in  rental
residences, he and his girlfriend were concerned about the housing market and decided
to  purchase  a  home. In  July 2022, they  purchased  a  home  together  with  both  using  partial
eligibility for a Department of Veterans Affairs loan. They each  contributed  about $5,000-
6,000 toward the  down payment.  (Tr. 75-77)
Character witnesses  testified  on  Applicant’s behalf. His cohabitant has been  his
girlfriend for three years. She believes he is the most honest and trustworthy person she
ever met. She has not observed him using illegal drugs and he takes his valid medication
as prescribed. He pays his bills and is very responsible. She holds a security clearance
and believes he possesses the good judgment necessary to hold a clearance. (Tr. 20-27)
A  coworker testified  on  his behalf. They have  worked  together since  July 2022. He
testified  that Applicant’s work performance  is  outstanding. He  believes Applicant  is very
truthful and honest. He trusts  him to safeguard classified information. (Tr. 28-33)
Applicant’s  former  supervisor  testified  on  his  behalf.  Applicant  worked  for  him
starting in August 2021  and they are friends.  He testified  that  Applicant’s  performance
was reliable and trustworthy. He would trust Applicant to handle classified information.
(Tr. 34-40)

"In  Applicant's  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  2.b,  and  4.b.  He
admitted SOR ¶ 4.c, but with an explanation that I construe as a denial. He denied SOR
¶  1.b.  He  also  admitted  the  cross-allegations  at  SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  3.a,  and  4.a,  also  with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  aviation  mechanic  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since July 2005. (Item 2 at 7, 13.) He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item 2
at 32.)  He married in October 1995 and divorced in May 1998. He has two adult children.
(Item 2 at 17 and 20-21.)
April  2017  arrest and charge  of  possession  of  marijuana  (SOR ¶¶  1.a, 2.a, 4.a
and 4.c). Applicant admitted in his Answer to being arrested and charged with possession
of  marijuana.  In  his  SCA  he  admitted  to  pleading  guilty  to  possession  of  a  controlled
substance and noted that the possession of marijuana charge was dropped. He stated in
his SCA that “there is a plea of guilty as I was not allowed to plead no contest.” (Item 2 at
27-28.) He was sentenced to 18 months of community supervision, to participate in 50
hours of community service, and pay a fine of $968. (Item 2 at 26, 27, 28, and  29.) He
stated in his background interview he did not know the entirety of what he was charged
with  possessing  but  then  admitted  he  pled  guilty  because  he  was  advised  he  was
fortunate to not have a felony charge. (Item 3 at 5-6.) He states in his SCA this charge
was false and the person who accused him of sexual assault could not recant this offense
because they could risk being charged with a crime. (Item 2 at 37.)
April   2017   use   and/or  possession  of   marijuana   with   vary   frequency   while
granted access   to   classified information   (SOR  ¶¶ 1.b, 4.a).
Applicant pled guilty  to
possession of marijuana in his residence. (Item 2 at 9.) The police recovered a bag of
marijuana  in  plain  view,  along  with  a  water  bong in  the  master  bedroom.  The  police
recovered a vaporizer bong hidden behind a closed master bathroom door. (Item 4 at 57.)
The police deployed a trained narcotics dog who alerted in several areas of the home and
Applicant’s  vehicle.  (Item  4  at  16,  57.)  The  police  recovered  marijuana  in  the  kitchen
refrigerator, kitchen freezer, and in a downstairs bedroom. The police also recovered drug
paraphernalia.  Applicant  states  in  an   interrogatory  response   that  “any  and   all
paraphernalia  was isolated  to  back room  where [his girlfriend] was allowed  to  smoke  only
and outside.” (Item  3  at 2.) He  said  he  was not aware  of the marijuana  in  the  refrigerator
until it was reported  to  him. (Item  3  at 2.)  He initially denied  knowledge  of any drugs in his
home  until the  interviewing  agent asked  about the  drugs found  in  plain  view. (Item  3  at
5.)  The  arrest complaint was for a  “State  Jail  Felony” in the  1st  degree  for the  marijuana
seized  in freezer. (Item  4  at 38.) A  second  arrest complaint,  for a  class A  misdemeanor.
was issued  for other forms of  marijuana  found  in the  house. (Item  4  at 40.)  Applicant  was
ordered  as part of his sentence  to  participate  in the  state’s  drug  offender program. (Item
2   at  28.)  During   his background   interview   he   told  the   investigator he   pled   guilty  to   the
misdemeanor charges  in 2018  to  avoid being  charged  with  felony offenses.  (Item  3  at 6.)
He stated  he  passed  his employer’s drug  tests. (Item  at 6.)  He was granted  a  clearance
in July 2011. (Item 2 at 32.)
April  2017  arrest and  charges of  aggravated assault with a  deadly  weapon
and sexual assault.  (SOR ¶  2.b, and, as  to  the  arrest and charge  of  sexual assault,
SOR  ¶   3.a)  Applicant  admitted  to  being  arrested  and  charged  for  the  offenses  of
aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and sexual assault. He denied the underlying
conduct,  noting  that  the  alleged  victim  recanted  her  statement  and  that  the  grand  jury
returned a “No Bill.” (Answer). The alleged victim reported the sexual assault in April 2017
and told the police the incident took place in March 2017. The police officer noted while
taking the statement the alleged victim described an assault with a pistol that had taken
place in January 2017. (Item 4 at 57.) Police recovered two firearms in an upstairs workout
room closet with various magazines as well as a 9mm pistol with one magazine loaded.
(Item 4 at 57-58.) The inventory description lists two locations where the 9mm pistol was
recovered, the vehicle’s side door pocket and the upstairs workout room. (Item 4 at 58.)
The grand jury returned a “No Bill” on both charges. (Item 2 at 28.)
SOR  ¶   4.b:   failed  to   report  [or]  failed  to   fully   disclose   to   Facility   Security
Officer.  Applicant admitted in his Answer and during his background interview he did not
fully  disclose  the  sexual assault  allegation  when  asked.  (Item  3  at 6.)  He  states  in  his
Answer he thought because the security officer was a woman, and by her demeanor, he
was being judged. In his Answer, he admits he did not fully disclose because he did not
know  how  to  explain  to  the  woman  “what  did  not  happen  versus  what  was  already
implied.” In his Answer he states he did call the same day because he knew he needed
to relay what he did not provide and explain why he felt intimidated. He requested a male
security officer be at next meeting. He adds he provided all the information he failed to
provide at the next meeting. During his background interview he told the investigator he
would have reported the additional charges at the correct time had the security official
been a male. (Item 3 at 6.)
SOR ¶  4.c: Failure  to  disclose  April  2017  drug arrest on his  SCA.  Applicant
denied  he  deliberately  falsified  his  answer  to  Question  23  of  his  SCA,  which  asked
whether  he  had  used  or  otherwise  been  illegally  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled
substance not previously listed, on the basis he had already addressed the April 2017
incident in the SCA. He addressed the conduct in his SCA responses. (Item 2 at 27-28.)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  he  did  not  provide  any  updated
evidence  to  be  considered  in  mitigation.  He  also  provided  no  character  evidence  for
consideration under the whole-person concept.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-d  in  his  Answer  to  the  SOR.  He  did  not
specifically admit or deny ¶ 2.a, which referenced SOR ¶ 1.d under Guideline J.  I will
interpret his omission as a denial. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2010. He married his
wife  in  2012,  and  they  have  twins,  age  10.  Since  September  2014,  he  has  been
employed  by  a  federal  contractor  as  a  quality  assurance  analyst.  Applicant  currently
possesses a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 14-17; GE 1)
In  his  August  2020 SCA,  Applicant disclosed  that  he  used marijuana  daily  from
June 2019 to November 2019, while he possessed a DOD security clearance. He listed
that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future  because  it  is  unhealthy.  He
purchased  marijuana  on  a  monthly  basis  from  June  2019  to  November  2019.  He also
listed that he was arrested in November 2019 for felonious possession of marijuana and
felonious  distribution  of  marijuana.  He  was  still  awaiting  trial  for  these  charges  at  the
time he completed his SCA. (Tr. 18-21; GE 1)
In  December  2020,  Applicant  participated  in  a  background  interview  with  an
authorized DOD investigator. Applicant provided details about his use of marijuana and
stated that he would smoke about one or two puffs a day, approximately half of a gram
of  marijuana.  He  used  marijuana  to  relieve  his  stress.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he
would purchase marijuana from “pop up” parties near his residence. These events were
held  in  a  market  setting  where  customers  could  purchase  an  item  and  then  the
individual  was  “gifted”  with  free  marijuana.  Applicant  estimated  that  he  spent  $200  a
month for marijuana, and he had no intention of using marijuana again in the future. He
researched other ways to relieve stress, and he currently uses meditation and binaural
beats, that have significantly reduced his tension. (GE 2; Tr. 23-25, 41)
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  admitted  that,  when  he  was  stopped  by  police  in
November  2019,  he  had  about  one-and-a-half  ounces  of  individually  packaged
marijuana  and  several  smoking  devices  in  his  backpack.  The  police  also  found
concentrated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a wax form. He had recently purchased the
marijuana  and  believed  the  amount  would  satisfy  his  marijuana  needs  for  about  one
month.  He  admitted  that  he  smoked  marijuana more frequently on the  weekends, and
sometimes he added the concentrated THC to his marijuana. The police also found that
Applicant  possessed  a  large  amount  of  cash  in  large  denominations,  approximately
$900.  Applicant  stated  that  his  parents  taught  him  to  always  carry  a  large  amount  of
money. He normally carries around $200 to $300 cash on him, but he had extra money
in  his  possession because he  had  just  won approximately  $500  from  a  sports bet.  He
denied  that  he  was  selling  marijuana.  He  admitted  that  he  was  aware  marijuana  was
illegal  under  federal  and  state  law  and  violated  the  requirements  for  individuals
possessing security clearances. He reported his arrest to his employer’s security officer.
He attended Narcotics Anonymous for six months, participated in drug screenings, and
he  completed  over  180  hours  of  community  service.  The  court  dismissed  the  charges
against him. (Tr. 26-37, 39-42; GE 3, GE 4, GE 5)
Applicant testified that he stopped using marijuana in November 2019 only after
he  had  been  arrested.  He  admitted  that  if  he  had  not  been  arrested,  he  most  likely
would  have  continued  using  marijuana.  The  arrest  was  a  wake-up  call.  Although  he
possessed  a  DOD  security  clearance,  he  did  not  report  his  previous  use  and
possession of marijuana to his security officer until after his arrest. (Tr. 36-37; GE 1)
Applicant  provided  a  character  reference  letter  from  his  team  manager,  who
described  Applicant  as  an  effective  leader  of  the  team.  He  has  no  reservations  about
Applicant’s  character,  responsibility,  or  patriotism.  The  team  manager  did  not  state  in
his letter whether he was aware of Applicant’s illegal drug use. Applicant also submitted
an April 20, 2023, drug screen certificate which showed no drugs were detected in his
urine. (AE A and AE B)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  the  four  allegations  under  the  drug  involvement  guideline,
and the three allegations under the personal conduct guideline, without explanations.
Applicant is 31 years old. She has been married to her second husband for two
years.  The  couple  have  no  children.  She  married  her  first  husband  in  February  2016,
and divorced him in March 2017. She has been working for her employer since January
2017. She began as a branch manager and currently is an engineering manager on the
leadership team. She supervises 300 individuals. (GE 1 at 25; GE 3 at 6; Tr. 33-37)
From August 2006 to March 2010, Applicant attended a military academy and
received  a  high  school  diploma  in  May  2010.  She  attended  an  aeronautics  university
from August 2010 to June 2014, where she earned a bachelor’s degree. She received
three  work-related  certificates  in  2019,  and  a  cash  award  in  2020.  Her  performance
evaluations for 2018, 2019, and 2021 registered eight or higher on a one to ten  rating
system.  In  August  2021,  she  received  a  master’s  degree  in  science  in  unmanned
systems. (GE 1 at 13-15; GE 3 at 5; Tr. 65-66; AE 1, 2, 3)
After graduating from the university in June 2014, Applicant was commissioned
to  the  United  States  Army  Reserve  (USAR)  as  an  officer.  She  was  then  assigned  to
United States (U.S.) duty locations while working civilian jobs. She went on active duty
to  Afghanistan  from  January  2016  to  January  2017,  when  she  returned  to  the  United
States  and  began  working  for  her  current  employer.  She  remained  in  the  USAR  until
July 2019, when she left by mutual agreement after unsatisfactory performance, though
the  record  persuasively  demonstrates  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  her  performance.
She never explained the nature of the unsatisfactory performance. She made reference
to: (1) an incident during her deployment that she did not want to be recorded; (2) her
subsequent  marijuana  usage  because  of  sleep  problems;  and  (3)  counseling  she
received from her chain-of-command in August 2018 because of her failed drug test in
July 2018. (GE 1 at 17; GE 3 at 4-5; GE 4; Tr. 43)
Drug Involvement
SOR  ¶   1.a   –  In  her  August  2021answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  that
she initially used marijuana at varying frequencies from August 2009 to June 2014, and
later  purchased  marijuana  from  January  2017  to  August  2018.  She  began  using
marijuana  in  August  2009  sporadically  in  high  school  in  social  settings.  Though  she
testified that she could not recall how many times she used the drug in high school, she
estimated  two  times  in  her  August  2019  e-QIP.  She  acquired  the  drug  from  her  high
school friends. (GE 1 at 37; GE 3 at 5; Tr. 62) There is no evidence indicating that she
purchased the drug during this period.
In college from 2010 to June 2014, Applicant testified that she used marijuana
sporadically. While  she  could not attach  a  number  for the  times  she  used  the  drug,  in
her August 2019 e-QIP, she estimated her use as “a handful of times in college.”  She
testified that she did not purchase the drug while in college. (GE 1 at 37-38; Tr. 41, 54,
63)
After  graduating  from  the  university
in  June  2014,  and  receiving  her
commission into the USAR, Applicant stopped using marijuana because she recognized
the zero-tolerance policy against drug use in the U.S. Army (USA). Before receiving her
commission, she tested positive for marijuana in June 2014. (GE 4 at 5; Tr. 41)
Applicant stated in her April 2020 PSI that she used marijuana two months after
returning  from  her  active-duty  deployment  in  December  2016.  Anxiety  and  post-
traumatic  stress  syndrome  (PTSD),  two  undiagnosed  medical  conditions  that  were
related  to  Applicant’s  foreign  deployment  which  caused  sleep  problems,  were  the
reasons  that  she  resumed  using  marijuana.  She  justified  drug  use  over  alcohol  use
because of her father’s ongoing problems with alcohol; she rationalized marijuana use
over  treatment  from  a  medical  professional  because  of  Applicant’s  family’s  risk  of
addiction. She smoked marijuana less than 12 times in 2017, and once a month in 2018
until June 2018 when she failed a drug test. She purchased the drug during this period.
(GE  3 at 4-5; GE 4 at 5; Tr.  50-52, 54, 74) Applicant  testified that after returning from
foreign  deployment,  she  did  not  resume  marijuana  use  until  June  or  July  2017,  rather
than January 2017. (Tr. 49-50) In her December 2019 e-QIP, she stated that she did not
intend to use marijuana in the future because of her discharge from the military in July
2019 (SOR ¶ 2.b), which helped reduce her stress and sleep problems. (GE 1 at 37-38)
In the same form, she admitted using marijuana while possessing a security clearance,
but  falsely  denied  purchasing  marijuana  in  the  previous  7  years.  (GE  1  at  38)  This
falsification is not alleged in the SOR, but will be considered in the whole-person section
of this decision.
SOR  ¶   1.b   –    Applicant  admitted  in  her  answer  that  between  November  2011
and August 2018, she used and purchased marijuana while she was granted access to
classified  information.  Though  she  had  a  security  clearance  during  the  entire  period
covered by  SOR  ¶ 1.b,  she did not use or purchase marijuana between  June 2014 to
the  middle  of  2017.  She  claimed  she  did  not  know  that  she  had  a  security  clearance
until she was receiving briefings in 2015 in advance of foreign deployment in early 2016.
(Tr. 42) She also claimed that she did not know that the e-QIP she filled out in 2011 had
a connection to her security clearance. She believed her security clearance was granted
to her by virtue of her military status as an officer. (Tr. 42)
SOR ¶  1.d –   In June 2014, Applicant tested positive for marijuana based on a
urinalysis  test  administered  by  Applicant’s  Army  unit.  She  did  not  receive  the  results
until  2018,  when  she  took  another  urinalysis  test.  In  the  interim  years,  she  registered
negative results from seven urinalysis tests between June 2014 and June 2018. (GE 4
at 5; Tr. 43-44)
SOR ¶  1.c  –   In June 2018, Applicant tested positive for marijuana based on a
urinalysis test administered by her Army unit. (GE 4 at 5)
After  Applicant’s  positive  marijuana  test  in  June  2018,  she  sought  treatment
from medical professionals, using her employer’s assistance program. During five or six
months  of  treatment,  she  learned  different  tactics  to  alleviate  stress,  such  as  physical
fitness, medication techniques, and alternative communication practices. (Tr. 55-56, 78,
86-89)
In  her  testimony,  Applicant  stressed  that  she  does  not  intend  to  resume
marijuana  use  in  the  future.  She  has  made  positive  changes  in  her  lifestyle.  She  no
longer  associates  with  the  person  she  purchased  the  marijuana  from.  She  does  not
associate with any drug users or environments where drugs are used. She has provided
a  statement  of  intent  to  refrain  from  future  drug  use,  recognizing  that  any  future  drug
involvement is grounds for revocation of eligibility for security clearance eligibility. (AE 6)
She and her husband plan to start a family. She is thriving in her career development.
One aspect of Applicant’s job is counseling her employees on career development and
security  issues.  She  emphasizes  the  importance  of  supplying  truthful  information  on
security forms. (Tr. 57-58, 81-82)
Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶   2.a   –    Applicant’s  illegal  use  of  marijuana  between  August  2009  and
2014,  and  between  the  middle  of  2017  to  June  2018,  while  possessing  a  security
clearance, demonstrates questionable judgment under the personal conduct guideline.
SOR ¶  2.b  –   Applicant was administratively separated from USAR in July 2019
for misconduct, specifically drug use. (GE 3 at 5; AE 1-2) Applicant claimed that if she
had told her commander that she intended to stay in the military, the commander was
willing to ensure that Applicant would not be administratively separated from the USAR.
(Tr.  56-57,  76-77)  In  her  undated  character  statement  describing  Applicant’s  remorse
for her drug use and her good job performance, the commander indicated that “I would
have  fought  to  keep  [Applicant]  in  the  military  if  I  could  have.”  (AE  4  at  4)  I  find  that
Applicant was administratively  separated from the USAR for her drug use. (GE 3 at 5;
GE 4 at 1)
SOR ¶  2.c –   In her October 2011 e-QIP, Applicant was asked in Section 23 of
the application if she had used illegal drugs in the last seven years. By answering “no”
to the question, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her marijuana use (SOR ¶ 1.a)
that began on August 9, 2009. In her answer to the SOR, she admitted she falsified her
answer to the question. (Tr. 63-65)
In 2010, when Applicant was 19 years old and applying for colleges, a military
recruiter recommended that she not disclose her marijuana use since she aspired to be
an officer in the military. (Tr. 38) In 2011 at age 20, after attending a Reserve Officer’s
Training  Corps  (ROTC)  scholarship  ceremony,  she  went  into  a  conference  room  and,
under  the  supervision  of  military  recruiters,  filled  out  different  forms  that  she  believed
related to her ROTC scholarship and to join the military. She did not know that one of
those forms was a security clearance application, but she did know that information that
she  put  on  2011  security  clearance  application  was  incorrect.  (Tr.  40)  At  the  hearing,
she indicated that she did not know she had a security clearance until she was receiving
briefings  in  2015  for  foreign  deployment  in  early  2016.  (Tr.  42)  Regardless  of  when
Applicant became aware she had a security clearance, she knew in October 2011 that
she deliberately concealed her marijuana use as set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a.
Character Evidence
Witness  A,  a  project  manager  for  Applicant’s  employer,  has  had  a  security
clearance since late 2017. In the last five years, he has worked with Applicant in several
locations. They have worked on several projects together. Witness A believes Applicant
is honest and pleasant to work with. The adverse information in the SOR occurred many
years ago and does not change Witness A’s favorable opinion of Applicant. Though not
fully  aware  of  his  employer’s  drug  policy,  he  is  aware  that  using  illegal  drugs  while
holding a security clearance could result in loss of the clearance. (Tr. 16-22)
Witness   B   works for Applicant’s employer as   a   financial officer in   the   office of
intelligence   and   analytics.   He   has   had     security  clearance   for  10   years.  He  has  been
working  with  her  since  2018. Besides being  trustworthy, Witness B  praises Applicant’s
professional   approach   in  evaluating   a   task  from   all   angles  before   proceeding   with   a
pragmatic   solution.   Witness   B   is  not   aware   of  his  employer’s  drug   policy,   but  believes
that a  person’s  drug  use  while holding  security clearance  must be  evaluated  on  a  case-
by-case basis. (Tr. 23-33)
Applicant  submitted  four-character  references.  Reference  C  works  as  a
scheduling supervisor for a distiller. In 2016, he served with Applicant in the Middle East
where she was the officer in charge (OIC) of operations. In that position, Reference C
watched  Applicant  develop  a  commendable  reputation  for  organizational  skills  and
problem-solving abilities. Reference C believes Applicant is security conscious. (AE 4 at
C)
Reference D works for a defense contractor and has a security clearance. This
reference  has  known  Applicant  for  13  years  and  met  her  in  college.  They  were  in
separate  branches  of  the  military  through  the  ROTC  program.  Reference  D  believes
Applicant is reliable and merits a security clearance. (AE 4 at D)
Reference  E,  a  program  manager,  has  known  Applicant  since  2010  and
considers her a role model who is very trustworthy. He recommends her for a security
clearance. (AE 4 at E)
Reference F was Applicant’s commander and is currently a major  in the USA.
Reference  F  relied  on  Applicant  as  OIC  of  the  weapon  ranges  or  as  the  training  and
planning officer. Based on Applicant’s performance in all tasks she was assigned, and
her  security  consciousness,  Reference  F  recommends  that  she  receive  a  security
clearance. (AE 4 at F)
Reference G has been an employee of the intelligence and analytics division of
Applicant’s employer since 2012. Having worked with Applicant since 2018, reference G
believes she exercises good judgment and trustworthiness. In his view she has earned
security clearance eligibility. (AE 4 at G)
",True
"Applicant  is  37  years  old.  He  has  never  been  married  and  does  not  have  any
children. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2008. Since October 2009, he has worked for
a federal contractor as a lead automation engineer. This is his first application for a DOD
security clearance. (Item 2)
Drug  Involvement and Substance  Misuse
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant has used marijuana from about
January 2004 to June 2021. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He has also purchased marijuana from about
January  2004  to  June  2021.  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  He  listed  this  information  on  his  June  2021
security clearance application (SCA) and admitted these allegations in his Answer. (Item
2; Answer)
In  August  2021,  Applicant  participated  in  a  background  interview  with  an
authorized DOD investigator. He stated that he first used marijuana in college,  and he
used marijuana on  a weekly basis from  approximately 2004  to  2008.  After college, he
stopped  all  use  of  marijuana  when  he  became  involved  in  the  hiring  process  with  his
current employer. He was aware that he  would be required to pass a pre-employment
drug test. He passed the drug screen and was hired in October 2009; at which time he
resumed his use of marijuana, but on a monthly basis. He used marijuana with friends
and the effects from the marijuana made him feel relaxed. His purchases of marijuana
did  not  cause  him  to  experience  financial  problems.  His  monthly  use  of  marijuana
remained consistent until June 2021. He told the investigator that he stopped marijuana
use  at  that  time  because  he  learned  that  his  employer had  sponsored  him  for  a  DOD
security  clearance.  He  is  aware  that  using  illegal  drugs  violates  federal  law  and  it  is
inconsistent with his employer’s drug policy. He has no intention of using marijuana in the
future. (Item 3)
Applicant told the investigator that he believed he had enough will power to reject
marijuana if it were offered to him because his job is more important to him than using
marijuana. He also stated that if he was not in the process of obtaining a DOD security
clearance, he would continue using marijuana, despite knowing such use violated federal
law and his employer’s drug policy. (Item 3)
Criminal Conduct
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  J  (criminal  conduct)  that  Applicant  used  and
purchased marijuana from about January 2004 to about June 2021. (SOR ¶ 2.a.)
",False
"Applicant is a 37-year-old Pre-Sales Solution Architect with a defense contractor.
He  has  worked  for  the  company  since  2015.  He  is  recently  married.  Applicant  has
received a bachelor of science degree and a master’s degree. He is seeking to retain a
security  clearance  granted  in  approximately 2011  in  connection  with  his  work  with  the
DoD. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Tr. 43-45, 52.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted allegation1.a under this paragraph
with explanations. He denied 1.b.
Applicant began using marijuana in edible form sometime between April 2017 and
mid-2018. (Tr. 17-20.)
He stated in his e-QIP of March 8, 2021:
Shortly after [State  A] legalized  recreational marijuana  I tried  it. I was always
scared  of illegal drugs. I have  experimented  with  it numerous times while in
states where it has been  legalized. I typically take  edibles that are created
for specific  uses  to  support better sleep, creative  thinking, stress  relief and
social anxiety. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23.)
Concerning his statements on the questionnaire Applicant testified, “I wanted to be
truthful, and frank and open and honest. All of those things in this Questionnaire. I felt the
most important thing was honesty.” (Tr. 19.)
Applicant would use marijuana about once or twice a week until August 2018. At
that  time, he moved  to  State  B,  where  it  was  still illegal to  purchase  or use marijuana
under state law. Applicant abstained from any marijuana use during the period he lived in
State B. Instead of marijuana he used legal supplements to help him sleep. (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 11; Government Exhibit 2 at 4, 8-9; Tr. 20-21.)
Applicant  returned  to  State  A  in  November  2020.  He  once  again  purchased
marijuana in pill form from state-approved stores and used it two to three times a week
until approximately June 2021, when he stopped all marijuana use. Altogether Applicant
used marijuana in pill or edible form about 50 times. Applicant has abstained from any
marijuana use since that time and evinced a credible intent not to use  marijuana in the
future. He has returned to using legal supplements as a sleep aid and finds them effective.
(Tr. 18-22, 26-29, 49-51.)
As  stated,  Applicant  received  a  security  clearance  in  2011.  That clearance  was
active during the time Applicant was using marijuana. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section
25; Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 43-45.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  conduct  that  shows  poor  judgment,  untrustworthiness,  or
unreliability. Applicant denied the single allegation under this paragraph because he felt
it was too vague.
2.a. The  Government alleges in  this subparagraph  that the  Applicant’s drug  use
history, as set forth under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E.
Mitigation
Applicant  is  viewed  as  a  solid  performer  by  his  employer.  He  has  repeatedly
received recognition for his job performance. Applicant is respected by his coworkers and
supervisors. (Applicant Exhibits B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K; Tr. 33-36, 38-40.)
Applicant has been singled out to be part of a special program by his employer.
This  program  is  limited  to  a  small  percentage  of  people  throughout  the  company.
(Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 36-37.)

"In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.c without further comment. His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  31  years  old.  Record  evidence  reflects  that  he  was  engaged  to  be
married  in  late  2021  and  has  no  children.  He  graduated  college  in  2014.  Shortly
afterwards,  he  obtained  employment  as  a  software  engineer  and  has  since  been
consistently employed. He has been with his current employer as a  software engineer
since 2021. (GX 3-4)
In  his  June  2021  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  began  using  marijuana  in
2010, during his first year in college. The frequency of his marijuana use varied from as
little as four times per year to as often as four times per week. He stopped using for a
period  in  2016  when  he  experienced  “bad  anxiety  and  paranoia”  after  consuming  a
marijuana edible. However, he later resumed using marijuana and disclosed that his last
use was in May 2021, a month before submitting his SCA. He stated he would not use
marijuana for the period he held a security clearance. (GX 3)
During  his  September  2021  background  interview,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he
purchased  marijuana  from  2010  through  2014.  He  further  disclosed  that  he  had
consumed,  smoked,  and  vaped  a  variety  of  marijuana  products  from  2010  into  2021,
including  after  he  submitted  his  SCA.  Although  Applicant  resides  in  a  state  where
marijuana  is  legal,  he  acknowledged  his  awareness  that  marijuana  was  illegal  under
federal  law.  Still,  Applicant  stated  that  he  intends  to  continue  using  marijuana  in  the
future because  he  “enjoys the autonomy to smoke” even though he claimed to not like
marijuana. (GX 4)
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana from about
October  2010  through  July  2021,  a  month  after  he  submitted  his  SCA  and  that  he
purchased  marijuana  from  2010  through  2014.  He  further  admitted  his  intention  to
continue  using  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  did  not  provide  any  additional  information
beyond his admissions. (GX 2)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  Government’s  FORM  or  otherwise  offer  any
mitigating evidence beyond what he had previously stated.
",False
"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b and 2.b. He denied the SOR
allegation  in  ¶  2.a.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 28 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. Since July 2018,
he has cohabitated with another. He earned a  bachelor’s degree  in May 2017 and  has
worked  for  his  present  employer  since  July  2017.  He  completed  a  security  clearance
application (SCA) in May 2018 and was granted a security clearance in October 2018.
(Item 3)
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  May  2018  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  from  about
September 2009 to January 2012, primarily while attending high school. He began using
it  weekly  and  then  daily  by  the  time  he  said  he  stopped  using  it.  He  purchased  the
marijuana he used. He disclosed that his use negatively impacted his productivity, which
is why he stopped. He also noted that he loved his job and wanted to keep it. (Item 3)
In  September  2020,  Applicant  completed  a  new  SCA.  He  disclosed  that  in
November 2018 the following occurred.
On  my   first   trip   to   California,  I  legally  purchased   items  containing   THC  from   a
dispensary  with   the   intent  of   traveling   across  state   lines  via  airplane   and
distributing  it as  gifts  to  my friends  when  I returned  home  to  the  state  of [X],  where
recreational THC was also legal at the time.  (Item 4)
He further stated in his September 2020  SCA: “I was asked to bring souvenirs back from
my trip, I thought of the  items containing  THC as a  ‘gag  gift.’”  He said  in his SCA, “This
was trafficking  THC products  from  one  legal  state to
another legal  state  but traveled  on
U.S. airlines across state lines which I believe makes this event illegal.”  (Item 4)
In   October  2020,   Applicant  was  interviewed   by  a   government  investigator.  He
explained  that in  November  2018  he  purchased  THC  edibles and  multiple  THC vaporized
cartridges.  He explained  his purchase  was  one  time,  and  he  never used  any  of the  THC
products.  He   stated   that  his  first  involvement  was  in   November  2018   and   his   last
involvement  with  THC was in November 2018. He told  the  investigator that  he  thought it
would be  okay to  purchase  it because  it was legal. He  told  the  investigator that he  did  not
realize it was illegal to  transport THC on an  airplane,  and  he only recently found  this out.
He admitted  to  the  investigator that  he  was aware purchasing  THC was against  the  rules,
regulations,  and procedures while possessing a security clearance. When asked why he
decided   to   purchase   the   THC,  he   explained   that  he   did  not   think  he   would  be
reinvestigated  for ten  years. Applicant was asked  by  the  government investigator about
other  drug  involvement,  and  he  said he  had  ----
never  used  THC and  cannot comment  on
how drugs affect his behavior.  Applicant did not disclose  his 2009  to  2012  marijuana  use
to this investigator during this interview.
Applicant was re-interviewed by a government investigator on November 12, 2020.
He was asked to clarify his statement from his October 2020 interview where he explained
the reason he purchased the THC while holding a security clearance was because he did
not think he would be reinvestigated for ten years. He admitted he was aware it was a
violation of rules, regulations, and procedure to purchase THC products while possessing
a security clearance. He told the investigator that he knew that he could not purchase any
illegal drug or have any involvement with illegal drugs while holding a security clearance.
He said that when he saw the THC products while in California, his thought process was
they were legal in California and legal in the state where he had a layover and legal in the
state where he was going, so he thought it would be okay to purchase THC as gag gifts
for his friends. He said that the latter part of his thought process overtook the part of him
holding a security clearance at the time. He acknowledged that he made a poor and wrong
choice, and it would not happen again. (Item 5)
Government  interrogatories  were  sent  to  Applicant,  and  he  was  provided  a
summary of his interviews with government investigators. In June 2022, he made several
changes to the summary before indicating it was an accurate reflection of his interview.
He did not correct the record or provide an explanation about his failure to disclose to the
government investigator his prior drug use from 2009 to 2012.
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  his  marijuana  use  from  2009  to
2012  and  that he purchased  marijuana  in November 2018. He stated: “I did something
that I was absolutely not supposed to do and that it was dumb and dangerous.” (Item 2)
Applicant denied that he failed to provide accurate information to the investigators. He
said, “At no point did I believe the information I had reported on a previous e-QIP for an
incident that had occurred more than 7 years prior to the current investigative process
was  relevant  to  the  investigation.”  He  further  stated,  “At  no  point  did  I  falsify  any
information because I accurately reported that I could not comment on how drugs affected
my behavior as my body and mind had matured in the 8 years since the previous incident.”
He also said, “I had tried to ask the interviewer to elaborate so that I could more accurately
understand the scope of what he was asking, as I believed it was a trick question designed
to  get  a  response  contradicting  the  incident  in  subparagraph  1.b,  which  I  was  just
questioned about.” (Item 2)
Applicant  never  referenced  his  inability  to  understand  the  question  that  the
investigator  was  asking  during  his  previous  interviews.  He  also  did  not  address  his
inability when he reviewed his summary of interviews that were provided as part of his
interrogatories. (Item 5)
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  he  said  that  he  answered  the  questions
posed in the interrogatories about the accuracy of the information. He said, “At no point
was  there  a  question  asked  to  elaborate  on  responses  given,  I  was  simply  asked  to
correct anything the investigator may have reported incorrectly.” He also noted that there
was  a  place  to  put  additional  information  regarding  the  matters  discussed  during  the
interview. He said:
I  did  not  immediately  think  to   recall   how  I  felt  answering   each   question
during   the   long   and   intensive   interview.   Instead,  I  opted   to   mention   an
address   change   as  I   have   moved   nearby   at   some   point  during   the
adjudicative   process.  Even   if  I  thought  that   this  is  what   the   “additional
information”   was  referencing,  I   would  not   begin  to   understand   the   scope
being asked. . ..” (AE  A)
Applicant’s FORM  response  notes that when  he  completed  his 2020  SCA he  did
not report his 2009  to  2012  drug  use  because  it was outside  the  seven-year time  frame.
He decided  that because  the  drug  use  was outside  the  seven  years  he  did  not have  to
disclose   it  in  his 2020   SCA  or during   his subsequent  investigative   interview.  Applicant
said he  did not  falsify material facts  during  his October 2020  subject  interview.  He did not
provide  an  explanation  for why when  he  was specifically asked  by  the  investigator about
never  used  THC and  he  could not  comment
his prior drug  involvement,  he  said he  had  ----
on how drugs affect his behavior.
Applicant further stated that “at no point did I contradict any of what was previously
reported.” He emphasized that he had self-reported the 2018 purchase and transportation
of THC, which is indicative of his honesty. He said he has been cooperative, and he is
trustworthy. He said he is aware that his conduct was “dumb and dangerous” and made
him vulnerable to exploitation and there is not an excuse for his actions. He believes he
is  trustworthy  because  he  self-reported  his  purchase  and  transportation  of  THC.  He
indicated this was an isolated incident. He has not been involved in any security violations.
He said he is praised for his work performance.
I do not find Applicant’s statements and explanations credible. I find he deliberately
falsified material facts during his personal subject interview on October 10, 2020, with an
authorized  investigator  with  the  Department  of  Defense  when  he  stated  he  had  never
used THC and could not comment on how drugs affected his behavior.
Applicant stated in his FORM response the following:
I  take   my  job   and   national  security  very  seriously.  At  work  I  have   been
praised   numerous  times  for  my   performance   on   my   project   that   involves
classified  information. The  information  that I am  in charge  of is invaluable
to  the  nation  and  our  treaties with  foreign  nations which  I take  great pride
in.  At no  point have  I ever been  involved  in any  sort of leak, and  I make  sure
all   information   I  work  with   is  stored   and   transferred   correctly.  I   have
previously been  involved  with  locking  up  closed  rooms  which  involved  doing
sweeps for any materials that were improperly stored  and  they’ve always
been thorough with no  incidents to  date. (AE  A)

after a major surgery. (Item 3 at 2; Response at 1.) He also acknowledges he used it for
non-medicinal  reasons.  In  his  Response  he  stated  he  did  not  want  to  lie  about  his
marijuana  use.  He  noted  the  prevalence  of  marijuana  use  in  the  U.S.  and  the  trends
towards legalization in expressing his hope that an otherwise qualified applicant would
not be disqualified solely based on marijuana use. (Response; Item 3.)

"Applicant is 30 years old, has never married, and has no children. She earned a
bachelor’s degree in 2017. She has worked for a DoD contractor since September 2021.
She  is  a  first-time  applicant  for  a  security  clearance  and  is  seeking  to  obtain  national
security eligibility in connection with her employment. (Tr. at 21-23; GE 1 at Sections 2,
12, 13A, 17, 18, 25.)
Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Involvement
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  she  has  a  history  of  drug  involvement.  Specifically,  the  SOR  alleged  that
Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana  with  “varying  frequency  from  about  October
2012  to  at  least  September  2021.”  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b.)  The  SOR  also  alleged  that
Applicant “used and purchased the hallucinogenic drug called mushrooms with varying
frequency from about February 2015 to about December 2019.” (SOR ¶ 1.c.) The SOR
further alleged that Applicant intended to continue use of “cannabis” and “mushrooms” in
the future. (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e.) In her Answer Applicant admitted the allegation set forth
in SOR ¶ 1.b and admitted with explanations the allegations in SOR ¶¶1.a, 1.c, and 1.d.
She denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.e.
I make the following findings of fact with respect to each of the SOR allegations:
1.a.  Marijuana   Use.   Applicant  used  marijuana   socially when   she   was  in  college
(2012-2017).   Sharing   marijuana   was  a   common   way  for  Applicant  and   her  friends  to
socialize,   and   she   felt   she   should   join   them   to   maintain  their   friendship.   At  times,   her
social use  was  several  times a  day.  By  2013,  her  use  became  frequent.  In  that  year she
received  a  medical marijuana  card so  that she  could buy marijuana  in her state  legally.
She used  marijuana  “medically”  at  that  time  for  anxiety  and  nausea  and  to  help  her sleep.
(Tr. at 28-31.)
In July 2014, Applicant was injured while wake boarding. She seriously damaged
muscles and tendons in her leg. Her leg was put in a cast and when the cast was removed,
she experienced searing pain. The use of the cast to immobilize her leg was a mistake
and she developed a serious condition called Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome or CRPS.
In her accident she had also damaged her leg nerves, and she has been subsequently
advised the worst thing to do with damaged nerves is to immobilize the area of the body
where the nerves have been damaged. Applicant saw eight doctors before being referred
to her current doctor, who is reputed to be the best doctor for treating her rare condition.
He treats her with a very high dose of one prescription medication for her nervous system
and two other medications. Applicant provided a letter from a pain management doctor
who  evaluated  her.  His  letter  graphically  describes  the  extraordinary  level  of  pain
Applicant experiences on a daily basis. She also provided a medical article describing her
rare condition. (Tr. at 28-40, 45; AE B; AE C.)
During the period 2019 to 2021, Applicant only used marijuana at night to help her
sleep because her condition caused her so much pain. Occasionally, she used marijuana
during the day for pain relief. During that period, she underwent multiple surgeries on her
leg and foot. When she was prescribed opioids after surgeries, she did not use marijuana
at  the  direction  of  her  doctors.  Her  current  doctor  is  aware  that  in  the  past  she  used
marijuana for her pain in addition to the medications he prescribed. (Tr. at 28-40.)
Applicant last used marijuana in August 2021, just before she was hired for her
current position in September 2021. She stopped using marijuana at that time because
she knew it was not legal federally and she did not want to risk losing her job opportunity
to work for a federal contractor. (Tr. at 24-27.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  candidly  admitted  that  she  purchased  and  used
marijuana once after she was hired by her current employer. She had temporarily run out
of her prescription medication for her nerve pain and needed help to relieve her pain at
night so she could sleep. The lack of medication during that period of about six nights
also put her at risk of having seizures. One of the uses of her medication is to prevent
seizures.  By  running  out  of  the  medication,  which  she  takes  in  very  high  doses,  she
increases her risk of seizures. Marijuana reduced that risk because it calms the nervous
system like her medication. (Tr. at 30-40.)
Applicant is required to refill her prescriptions for the pain medication every three
months  and  must  see  her  doctor  in  person  to  receive  the  refill  prescription.  She  has
difficulty scheduling an appointment with him because he has a busy practice. On this
one  occasion,  she  made  a  mistake  and  called  a  little  too  late  to  receive  a  timely
appointment.  Once  she  received the new prescription,  it  took a  few more  days  for the
pharmacy to mail her the medication. She legally purchased the marijuana under her state
law for the limited purpose of filling in the gap due to her lack of medication. She does not
anticipate having a problem like this in the future. She felt too much anxiety about risking
her job by using marijuana during that week to ever permit herself to be in that position
again. Her job is too important to her. She is anxious to maintain a happy and healthy
trajectory in her life after so many years of misery due to her condition. (Tr.at 28, 30-33.,
38-40.)
At the time Applicant ran out of medication, she was driving two hours each way
to commute to work. This daily routine made her more susceptible to even greater pain
without her medication. After eight months, she relocated to a new home near her job to
avoid the excessive wear on her fragile condition. (Tr. at 44.)
Applicant  is comfortable  with  her prescription  medications now. She  is reducing
the amounts of the medication using alternative strategies to relieve her pain. She lives
by herself with her dog. She is not surrounded by people who use marijuana as she was
during  her  college  and  subsequent  years.  She  never  finds  herself  in  the  company  of
others using marijuana. (Tr. at 32- 35, 37.)
1.b.  Marijuana  Purchases. See discussion  under 1.c, below.
1.c.   Mushroom   Use  and   Purchases.   Applicant   wrote   in  the   Answer  that  she
purchased   and   used   mushrooms  “inconsistently  between   [about  February  2015   and
about December 2019] to  help with the tough  emotional and spiritual part of chronic pain
at 21  years  old.”  Her last use of mushrooms was in  or about  December  2019. When  she
was diagnosed  with  CRPS  just  before her 22nd  birthday, she  was devastated  and  at a
loss receiving  such  bad  news about her health  at her young  age. At times, she  wanted  to
end   her  life   because   her  pain  was  unbearable.   She   used   mushrooms  when   she   was
desperate,  such  as after a  failed  surgery for her condition. She  used  mushrooms about
five  times over nine  years. She  has no  intention  to  use  or purchase  mushrooms in  the
future, noting  in the  Answer that she  was “doing  much  better, thankfully.” Applicant is very
happy with her life  now and the direction it is going. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 27, 35-36.)
1.d. Intent to Use Cannabis in the Future. In the Answer, Applicant wrote that, “I
admit medical cannabis helps my pain and the struggles my pain puts me through, but if
it means putting my job at risk then I wont use cannabis unless it becomes federally legal.”
She credibly testified that she has no future intent to use cannabis.  She explained her
position further and clarified her statement in her security interview on the subject of her
future intent to use cannabis. She said that in the event that cannabis became legal at
the federal level in the future, she would use cannabis again for her medical condition. If
there is no change in federal law, then she has no intention to use marijuana in the future.
(Answer at 2; Tr. at 23-24, 44.)
1.e. Intent to Use Mushrooms in the Future. At the time of her security interview,
Applicant candidly commented that she may use cannabis and mushrooms occasionally
when necessary due to pain or for celebratory purposes. She denied in the Answer any
future intent to use mushrooms. She credibly testified that she now has no future intent
to use mushrooms. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 23-24, 50; GE 2 at 13.)
Mitigation and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant is an independent, disabled person serving our military servicemembers
and working a full-time job. She has an emotional support dog. She rescues injured and
lost pets and finds them good homes. She is the best condition she has been in for nearly
a decade. She is determined to do what she needs to do to maintain this trajectory and
has been extremely honest about her past. She has received a coin  of appreciation for
her excellent work. She describes her job as the culmination of nearly 10 years of hard,
very painful work. She is dedicated to maintaining her improved health and her journey
to an even higher level of recovery. (Tr. at 49-50.)
",True
"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since May 2018.
He has taken some college courses. He is married and has two children, ages five and
one. He has held a security clearance since 2019. (Tr. 5-6, 21, 26; GE1)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana from October 2010
to June 2021 (SOR ¶ 1.a); that he used and purchased marijuana from about March 2019
to  about  2021,  while  having  access  to  classified  information  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  and  that  he
purchased marijuana from January 2011 to December 2020 (SOR ¶ 1.c).
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  gave  false
information  on  his  June  2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  when  he  failed  to
disclose his illegal drug use and purchases as stated in SOR ¶¶1.a-1.c above. (SOR ¶
2.a)
Applicant  admitted  all  of  his  illegal  drug  use  and  purchases,  and  his  deliberate
false  answer  given  on  his  2018  SCA.  He  began  using  marijuana  in  2010  and  starting
purchasing it in 2011. He used marijuana on a daily basis from 2011 through June 2021.
He purchased marijuana from 2011 through December 2020. He claimed that his use and
purchase of marijuana was because he suffered from anxiety and using marijuana helped
him with it. He admitted that he was never diagnosed by a medical professional before
March 2021 with anxiety. At that time, his primary care doctor prescribed him the drug
Escitalopram,  which  is  an  anxiety  medication,  but  he  did  not  know  if  he  was  formally
diagnosed with anxiety. He originally took the medication once a day, but now takes it on
an as-needed basis. He has never seen a psychologist or a psychiatrist about a possible
anxiety disorder. He claims he has not used marijuana since June 2021. (Tr. 20, 22-23,
27, 29-31; GE 3; AE D; SOR answer)
Applicant filled out an SCA in June 2018. In Section 23 of the SCA, he was asked
if, within the last seven years, he had used any illegal drugs or controlled substances. He
answered “no.” That answer was false because Applicant was using marijuana on a daily
basis before he completed the SCA and at the time he filled out the SCA. He admitted his
answer  was  false.  He  answered  falsely  to  conceal  his  past  use  of  marijuana.  He  was
aware his employer had a drug-free work policy, and he signed an agreement to adhere
to that policy. He was also aware that using marijuana violated federal and state law. He
also understood that he was granted a security clearance in 2019 based upon his false
answer to Section 23 of his 2018 SCA. He continued to use marijuana after being granted
a security clearance in 2019 through June 2021. (Tr. 20, 22-27; GE 2)
Applicant admitted that from May 2021 through June 2021, when he claims to have
stopped using marijuana, he had access to classified information. He claimed he did not
purchase  marijuana  during  this  same  time  frame.  As  of  the  date  of  his  background
interview in July 2021, he had not disclosed his marijuana use to his employer. (Tr. 32-
33; GE 3, p.6)
Applicant  completed  and  submitted  a  second  SCA  in  June  2021.  He  admitted
using marijuana in this SCA beginning in 2010, with his most recent use in June 2021.
He  also  admitted  using  marijuana  while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  He  admitted
purchasing marijuana about once a week from 2011 to December 2020. He also stated
that  he  was  now  taking  medication  to  prevent  further  use  of  marijuana.  During  his
testimony,  he  explained  that  the  reason  he  decided  to  fully  disclose  his  previous
marijuana use and purchases at that time was because he just had his second child, he
now had prescription medication to aid his anxiety, and he felt it was the right thing to do
now that he actually had access to classified information. (Tr. 33-34; GE 1)
Applicant  completed  a  30-day  inpatient  drug  treatment  program  beginning  in
February 2023 and ending in March 2023. He followed that with a “stepped down” 30-day
program from which he was discharged on March 31, 2023. All this treatment post-dated
his hearing in January 2023. The letter from the treatment program does not provide a
diagnosis,  prognosis,  or  a  treatment  plan  for  Applicant.  He  participated  in  family
counseling  where  apparently  his  drug  use  was  discussed.  No  further  information  was
provided and that counseling ceased in May 2021. His wife does not use marijuana, nor
do family members or friends with whom he associates. (Tr. 34-36; AE E)
Applicant  provided  letters  of  support  from  two  work  supervisors  and  a  personal
friend.  Both  of  his  work  supervisors  expressed  the  opinion  that  he  was  a  respected
member of the team and presented no security issues. One of the supervisors stated that
“to my knowledge, he doesn’t abuse alcohol or drugs.” Applicant admitted that he did not
tell either supervisor about his past drug use for fear that knowing that information might
impact their professional opinion of him. His personal friend wrote that he was aware of
Applicant’s prior drug use, but nonetheless believes that he does not pose a security risk.

"Applicant  is  33  years  old.  He  married  in  March  2020.  His  wife  passed  away
unexpectedly in March 2022, leaving him a widower with an 18-month-old child. Applicant
earned a bachelor’s degree in 2012 and a master’s degree in 2017. He has worked for a
federal contractor since 2014 and is now a manager. He applied for a security clearance
in November 2014 (2014 e-QIP), and the CAF granted him national security eligibility in
January 2015. He seeks to retain his eligibility in connection with his employment. (Tr. at
17-20; GE 1 at 5, 10-12, 17, 20-21, 35-37; GE 3; GE 4.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse
The  Government  alleged  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a
clearance  because  of  his  recent  drug  involvement.  Specifically,  the  SOR  alleged  that
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about June 2012 through March
2022  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  The  CAF  also  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.a  that  Applicant  used
marijuana  after  he  had  been  granted  a  security  clearance.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
admitted the allegation under this guideline. (Answer at 1.)
In his 2022 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana “very sparingly” in
the past seven years. He wrote that he used marijuana during that period about five times.
He disclosed further that his most recent use (two or three of about five times) was in
March 2022 after his wife died suddenly on March 1, 2022. He used the marijuana to help
him sleep at a time of extreme stress. (GE 1 at 33-34.)
Applicant testified that he had first experimented with marijuana one or two times
during  the  period  after  college  and  before  he  began  working  for  his  current  employer
(2012 to 2014). He smoked marijuana with friends who shared their marijuana with him.
He also smoked marijuana during the period 2015 to early 2022, while he held a security
clearance. He does not recall the specifics of these occasions because it was a number
of years ago when he was younger, but he is certain that his use of marijuana was very
limited during that period before his wife died. His best estimate is that he used marijuana
one or two times during that period. (Tr. at 21-23, 25-27.)
Applicant explained that the cause of his  wife’s  death was the result of taking a
medication that  she thought  was  a prescription medication.  He experienced  significant
trauma from this loss and the new reality that he was the widowed father of a young child
and responsible for both his child and a demanding full-time job. He had difficulty sleeping.
He tried non-prescription sleep aids, but they did not help him, and they had side effects
that  were  difficult  for  him  to  handle.  On  two  or  three  occasions  he  smoked  marijuana
before trying to sleep. He purchased the marijuana legally under the laws of his state of
residence (State A). The marijuana gave him some needed rest. (Tr. at 24-30.)
Applicant  quickly  decided,  however,  that  he  did  not  want  to  continue  to  use
marijuana  for  this  purpose  because  he  knew  that  its  use  was  inconsistent  with  his
responsibilities as someone with access to classified information. He concluded that using
marijuana  was  a  mistake.  He  did  not  want  to  have  his  use  of  marijuana  “spiral”  into
constant use to self-medicate his stress and grief. Because of the circumstances of his
wife’s  death,  he  had  no  interest  in  taking  any  prescription  medication  to  help  with  his
sleep. He forced himself to find non-drug remedies for his stress in the form of meditation,
therapy, breathing exercises, physical exercise, eating better, and time with his child. He
used these techniques to calm his mind so he could function during the day and sleep at
night. He described his path towards emotional recovery as an effort to better himself. He
testified that he has no intention to use marijuana or any illegal drug in the future because
he wants to strive to better himself and to set a proper example for his child. (Tr. at 28-
32.)
Applicant has not used any marijuana or other illegal form of drugs since his brief
experience  immediately  after his  wife’s  death.  After  the  hearing,  he  provided  a  written
statement in which he wrote that he has no intention to use illegal drugs in the future and
acknowledged that that usage of illegal drugs would constitute a basis for the automatic
revocation of his security clearance. He no longer associates with anyone who uses illegal
drugs. (Tr. at 31-32; AE A.)
Paragraph 2  - Guideline  E, Personal Conduct
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for clearance because he has engaged in conduct that involves questionable judgment,
an unwillingness to follow rules and regulations, lack of candor, and dishonesty. The CAF
alleged that Applicant falsified his answers to the question in Section 23 of the 2014 e-
QIP  about  prior  illegal  drug  use.  (SOR  ¶  2.a.)  The  SOR  also  cross-alleged  under  this
guideline the Guideline H allegations described above. (SOR ¶ 2.b.)
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in subparagraph 2.b and did not
respond  to  the  falsification  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.a.  Accordingly,  I  regard  his  lack  of
response to the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a as a denial of the allegation. (Answer at 2.)
At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he deliberately provided a false answer to
the question in Section 23 of the 2014 e-QIP. He testified that he was scared at the time
to admit his prior limited use of marijuana because it could make him ineligible to work for
the Government contractor that had offered him his first serious job after his completion
of college. He was 24 years old. (Tr. at 23-24.)
Applicant explained that when he prepared his 2022 e-QIP, he knew that he had
made a serious mistake in failing to disclose his drug use prior to November 2014 in his
2014 e-QIP. He decided that he should fully disclose his past use of marijuana, including
his post-college drug use and his recent use of marijuana after the death of his wife about
three months earlier. He  reasoned that he had matured since 2014 when he was  very
young and that working at a DoD contractor had taught him the importance of personal
integrity. He also believes that being fully candid with the Government was an important
step  in  his  healing  process  following  the  loss  of  his  wife.  He  is  determined  “to  better
himself”  so that he is the best person he can be. He decided he needed to accept the
consequences of his past mistakes using marijuana and not disclosing his prior use in his
2014 e-QIP. (Tr. at 32-33, 36, 41.)
Applicant understands that the purpose of his 2022 e-QIP is to seek eligibility for
a  Top  Secret  clearance.  He  fully  appreciates  the  responsibilities  that  such  eligibility
carries with it and the level of personal integrity that accompanies such a clearance. He
intends to live a healthy and honest lifestyle going forward. He is proud of his hard work
throughout  his  college  years  and  post-graduate  education.  He  has  been  successful
working at his employer since 2014 and has been rewarded with several promotions. He
hopes to continue his stellar career working for a DoD contractor. (Tr. at 32-33, 36, 41.)
Mitigation  and Whole-Person Evidence
After the hearing, Applicant submitted his performance evaluations since 2017. He
has been  rated  in  each  year as  a  “excellent  performer”  or  a  “successful performer. He
has earned promotions since his first year at the company in 2014 with increasing levels
of responsibility. (AE B – AE H, AE N.) Applicant also submitted four character reference
letters  from  work  colleagues,  including  a  former  supervisor,  and  a  neighbor.  They  all
praise Applicant’s dedication to his work and his reliable and trustworthy character. (AE I
through AE L.)
In a written statement submitted after the hearing, Applicant wrote that he does not
intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future  and  acknowledges  that  any  such  use  would  be
grounds for the revocation of his national security eligibility. He also wrote  that he has
volunteered to receive random drug testing by his employer. He noted that his illegal drug
use, both before he worked for this contractor and held a clearance, and after, occurred
when he was quite young and was very infrequent. His usage of marijuana after the death
of his wife was also quite limited and occurred during a brief period when the crisis of his
wife’s  sudden  death  dramatically  changed  his  life.  He  was  traumatized.  He  has  since
worked hard to rebuild his life and commit himself to living a healthy, drug-free lifestyle.
He believes that his therapy, his stress-reducing exercises, and time with his young child
have all dramatically improved his life since the low point he experienced in March 2022.

with  varying  frequency  from  about  2017  to  about  April  2022.  He  told  the  investigator
during  the  hiring  process  in  2022  he  stopped  using  marijuana  for  a  two-month  period
because he wanted to pass a drug test. (Item 3 at 8, 9.) He states he stopped using five

SOR  ¶   1.b  --  purchasing  marijuana.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admits  to
purchasing marijuana from about 2017 to about April 2022. He would buy the marijuana
in one state, at a recreational dispensary, and transport it back to his state because he
understood it to be against the law in his state to purchase and possess marijuana. (Item
3 at 5 and 8.) He states in his Answer that he does not intend to possess marijuana in the
future. He specified in his interrogatory response he did not sell or manufacture the drug
during  this  time  period.  (Item  3  at  5.)  He  also  stated  he  no  longer  possesses  unused
drugs,  substances,  or  paraphernalia,  and  no  longer  associates  with  persons  who  use
illegal substances (to include marijuana and derivative products) or frequent places where
he may believe illegal substances are being used. (Item 3 at 6-7.)

used  psilocybin  mushrooms  in  about  July  2019.  Under  further  questioning  during  his
security  clearance  interview  he  admitted  to  using  mushrooms  at  the  beach  with  his
girlfriend. (Item 3 at 9.) He states this was an “eye opening experience and this was the
only time he used mushrooms. (Item 3 at 9.)
SOR ¶  2.a  -- falsifying  material facts.  Applicant admits he falsified his answer
to Question 23 of his SCA, which asked whether he had used or otherwise been illegally
involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance.  He  answered  “Yes”  but  disclosed  the
marijuana  use  as  limited  to  a  one-year  period,  from  January  2021  through  December
2021. He stated in his SCA that he used “it only on special occasions.” (Item 2 at 28.) He
failed  to  disclose  the  full  extent  of  his  marijuana  use  until  his  April  28,  2022  security
clearance interview. (Item 3 at 8.) He told the investigator he did not want to admit to his
employer that he had been smoking marijuana for an extended period of time. (Item 3 at

SOR ¶  2.b  –  falsifying  material facts. Applicant admitted he deliberately falsified
his answer to Question 23 of his SCA, which asked whether he had any additional illegal
use of a drug or controlled substance to disclose . He answered “No” and failed to disclose
his use of psilocybin mushrooms in July 2019.
Applicant  explained  in  his  April  2022  security  clearance  interview  that  after
completing his SCA in March 2022 he researched marijuana use and learned he could
not use marijuana while holding a security clearance. (Item 3 at 8-9.) He continued to use
and  possess  marijuana  up  until  his  security  clearance  interview.  (Item  3  at  9.)  In  the

and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty
and was placed on probation for six months and ordered to perform 24 hours of community
service. (GE 2 at 7) As part of his probation, his driver’s license was suspended for six
months. Applicant successfully completed the probation.
In 2016, a police officer pulled over Applicant’s automobile when he noticed that his
inspection sticker had expired. When the officer spoke to Applicant, he noticed that the car
smelled like marijuana, prompting him to search it. After noticing a small mason jar filled
with  marijuana,  the  officer  arrested  Applicant  and  charged  him  with  misdemeanor
possession  of  marijuana.  (Item  2  at  8;  Tr.  23)  A  few  months  later,  the  court  deferred
judgment  for  six months  and  placed  Applicant  on  probation  during  that  time.  While  on
probation,  Applicant’s  driver’s  license  was  suspended,  he  was  to  perform  32  hours  of
community service, complete random drug tests, and his driver’s license was restricted.
(GE 4 at 2) Applicant did not complete the community services hours as ordered, and he
failed two random drug tests. His non-compliance with the terms of probation prompted the
court to find him guilty of the charge. (GE 2 at 8)
One evening in March 2017, while driving home from a party where he had been
drinking alcohol, Applicant fell asleep at the wheel after stopping at a red light. The driver of
the car behind Applicant’s car exited his vehicle and knocked on Applicant’s driver-side
window.  When  Applicant  did  not  awaken,  the  driver  of  the  other  car  called  the  fire
department. When a fire truck arrived, the firefighters knocked on the window, then broke it
after Applicant did not respond. Applicant still did not wake up. By the time Applicant woke
up, a police officer had arrived and administered a breathalyzer, which he failed. Applicant
was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (GE 2 at 9)
After pleading guilty to the offense, Applicant was fined $500, ordered to complete alcohol
and drug counseling, attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, required to install an
ignition interlock device for a period of six months, and sentenced to 30 days’ incarceration
(suspended). (Answer at 2) Applicant complied with the requirements of the court order.
(Tr. 25)
Applicant reduced his alcohol consumption significantly after the DUI arrest. Now, he
drinks approximately three drinks per month. (Item 2 at 7) Applicant has not used marijuana
since December 2018, and no longer associates with his friends who use marijuana. (Item
2 at 6) He attributes his use to immaturity, acknowledged that he was “in the wrong,” and
testified that it “didn’t register that [he] would have future issues,” if he continued to use
marijuana.” (Tr. 28)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  in  November  2018.  He
underreported his use of marijuana, estimating that he had used it a few times between
August 2011 and December 2012, when in fact he was using it occasionally at the time he
completed the application. (Answer at 2; Tr. 30) Applicant also falsified his answer to the
question asking about drug use while possessing a security clearance by answering “No,”
and failed to disclose his marijuana use within that context. (Answer at 3) Applicant admits
these allegations, explaining that he was “scared and . . . overthinking” when he completed
the  application.  In  response  to  a  question  concerning  whether  he  would  ever  use  any
marijuana in the future, Applicant responded, “I don’t intend on using this substance EVER
[emphasis provided by Applicant] because I am an employee at the [company].” (Tr. 34) He
continued  to  use  marijuana  for  approximately  one  month  after  completing  the  security
clearance application.

"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in his Answer to the SOR. (¶¶1.a, 1.b 1.c,
2.a,  and  2.b.)  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  58  years old.  He  was  previously  married  from  about  1986  to  2004,
and he is currently single. He has one adult daughter. He graduated from high school in
1983. He has been employed by his present employer, a federal contractor, since May
2001.  His  job  title  is  machinist.  Applicant  was  granted  a  DOD  security  clearance  in
December  2001.  He  needs  to  maintain  his  security  clearance  to  perform  his
employment duties. (Tr. 22-25; GE 1)
Drug Involvement and Falsification
In  his  September  2021  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  Applicant
intentionally failed to disclose, as required, that he had used and purchased marijuana
from  May  2001  to  the  time  he  submitted  the  SCA  and  while  possessing  a  security
clearance.  (SOR  ¶  2.a.)  He  testified  at  the  hearing  that  he  did  not  disclose  this
information because he was worried that he would lose his DOD security clearance and
be fired by his employer. He also admitted that he deliberately failed to disclose his use
and  purchase  of  marijuana  to  an  authorized  DOD  investigator  during  his  November
2021  background  interview.  (SOR  ¶  2.b.)  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  had
stopped using marijuana ten years ago. The investigator was aware that Applicant had
not  disclosed  any  illegal  drug  use  during  his  previous  investigation  that  had  occurred
about  ten  years earlier.  The  investigator  interrogated  him  further, and  Applicant  stated
he realized the investigator caught him in a lie. He was tired of lying about his marijuana
use  and decided to disclose  the  full details about  his marijuana use.  (GE 1,  GE  2;  Tr.
17-21, 32-35)
Applicant stated that even though he possessed a DOD security clearance at the
time he submitted the September 2021 SCA, he never had the intention to abstain from
smoking  marijuana.  He  has  lied  about  his  illegal  drug  use  since  he  was  hired  by  his
employer  in  May  2001.  Despite  his  history  of  using  marijuana,  he  stated  that  he  has
consistently been a valued and hard-working employee. (Tr. 21)
Applicant  admitted  that  in  August  1986,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with
possession of a controlled substance. (SOR ¶ 1.a.) He testified that he actually had two
incidents of getting into trouble with the police for illegal drugs, but due to the age of the
arrest,  he  could not  specifically recall any details  about  the incident.  (Tr. 25-27;  GE  2,
GE 3)
According to an interrogatory completed by Applicant on May 18, 2022, he listed
that he had used marijuana daily from January 1980 to May 17, 2022, and he had future
intentions  of  using  marijuana.  Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  use  marijuana  daily
during that entire period. When he was first hired by his employer, he believed he may
have abstained from using marijuana for about a year. He admitted during the hearing
that he continues to use marijuana. (GE 2; Tr. 27-29)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  also  purchased  marijuana  while  holding  a  DOD
security  clearance.  (SOR  ¶ 1.c.) He disclosed during his background interview that he
spends  about  $100  every  two  months  to  purchase  marijuana  from  a  friend  who
possesses a medical marijuana card. He smokes marijuana in the evenings to relax and
it  also  helps  with  his arthritis  pain.  He testified  that  in  September 2022,  he obtained  a
medical  marijuana  card  and  he  has  recently  purchased  marijuana  from  a  dispensary.
He  provided  documentation  from  September 2022  that  his  application  to  participate  in
his  state’s  medical  marijuana  program  had  been  approved.  He  was  aware  the  use  of
marijuana  is  illegal  under  federal  law,  and  that  the  Federal  Government  and  his
employer  have  a  policy  against  people  holding  a  security  clearance  and  using  illegal
drugs. (GE 2; Tr. 29-32, 35-36; AE C, AE D)
Applicant submitted two character reference letters from his direct supervisor and
the  operations  manager  from  his  place  of  employment.  Both  references  praised
Applicant’s  outstanding  work  ethic  and  personal  commitment  to  the  mission.  They
believe Applicant is an asset for his employer and the DOD. (AE A, AE B)

"Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  October  2019.  He  received  a  high  school  diploma  in  2003.  He  has  not
been married and has no  children. He  served  on active  reserve duty  with  the  U.S.  Air
Force from 2005 to 2013 and received an honorable discharge. (Items 3, 8)
Applicant has a history of mental health issues and inpatient hospitalizations. He
has  been  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  and  unspecified  psychotic  disorder  by  a  duly
qualified  mental  health  professional.  His  mental-health  disorders  cause  periods  of
psychosis where he suffers from delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and memory loss.
He began experiencing these symptoms in about 2010. (Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8)
In  late  November  2019,  Applicant  checked  himself  into  an  inpatient  hospital  for
mental  health  treatment  because  he  was  suffering  from  an  increase  in  audio-visual
hallucinations, high  anxiety,  and insomnia.  During  this inpatient  treatment, he  reported
that,  for  years,  he  had  been  misusing  prescription  Xanax  and  prescription  Ambien  by
taking  more  than  the  amount  he  was  prescribed.  He  also  reported  that  he  had  been
binge  drinking  about  a  pint  of  liquor  one  to  two  times  per  week  to  help  him  sleep.
According  to  his  medical  records  form  this  hospital,  combining  alcohol  with  several  of
the  prescription  drugs  he  was  taking  is  a  misuse  of  those  prescription  drugs.  This
inpatient treatment lasted for about a week. During this treatment, a certified psychiatric
nurse practitioner diagnosed him with an unspecified schizophrenic spectrum and other
psychotic disorder, and an unspecified stimulant use disorder (moderate). (Items 2, 3, 5,
7, 8)
In  January  2020,  Applicant  reported  that  he  voluntarily  checked  himself  in  to
another inpatient hospital because he was again suffering from psychosis. There is no
evidence  in  the  record  as  to  how  long  this  second  inpatient  hospitalization  lasted,  the
specific  treatment  he  received,  or  whether  he  was  diagnosed  with  a  mental  health
disorder. (Items 2, 3, 7)
Applicant was evaluated at the DOD’s request by a licensed psychiatrist, and the
report of the evaluation was issued on March 8, 2022. After meeting with him virtually,
reviewing the results of an online psychological inventory, and reviewing Items 3, 5, 6,
and  8,  the  DOD’s  licensed  psychiatrist  found  his  condition  to  be  “suspicious  for
schizophrenia,”  but  diagnosed  him  with  an  unspecified  psychotic  disorder  and
polysubstance  abuse  of  alcohol  and  prescription  medication.  She  opined  that  his
conditions are likely to impair his reliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness, and
that his prognosis was guarded. Her prognosis was partly based upon the premise that
he  was  not  receiving  psychiatric  treatment,  but  he  had  made  an  appointment  to  start
doing so. According to a letter from his treatment provider dated October 20, 2022, he
received  psychiatric  treatment  from  a  licensed  psychiatric  nurse  practitioner  since
March  28,  2022,  and  he  remained  stable  on  his  current  medication  and  treatment
regimen. This licensed psychiatric nurse practitioner diagnosed him with schizophrenia
and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). (Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  made  poor decisions  and  has  shown  poor
judgment  when  he  is suffering  from  psychosis.  For  example,  in  March  2020,  when  he
was  suffering  from  psychosis,  he  drove  while  he  was  intoxicated.  He  claimed  that  he
would not have driven while intoxicated if he had not been suffering from psychosis. He
also claimed that he has only abused his prescription medications and alcohol when he
was  in  a  period  of  psychosis  and  claimed  that  he  would  not  have  abused  those
substances otherwise. (Items 2-8)
Applicant claimed that he is feeling better mentally. He claimed that his treatment
with a licensed psychiatric nurse practitioner has helped, and that he plans to continue
that  treatment,  including  following  her  advice  regarding  prescription  medication.  He
claimed  he  has  had  no  episodes  of  psychosis  after  his  January  2020  inpatient
hospitalization. He claimed that he has learned better coping mechanisms. At the time
of his meeting with the DOD psychiatrist, he had recently moved in with his father and
lived  closer  to  his  siblings  and  one  of  his  good  friends.  He  noted  that  he  has  sought
inpatient treatment whenever he has a period of psychosis. He did not indicate whether
he  still  suffers  from  audio  or  visual  hallucinations  or  paranoia.  He  has  not  received
substance  abuse  counseling  other  than  detoxification.  The  DOD  licensed  psychiatrist
opined that he should be receiving treatment for substance abuse. She also noted that
he  had  a  lower-than-average  motivation  for  treatment  level  compared  to  others  with
mental  health  issues  and  that  he  sees  little  need  for  changes  in  his  behavior.  She
opined that these qualities are poor prognostic indicators. (Items 2, 3, 7, 8)
In  February  2008,  Applicant  drove  while  intoxicated.  He  was  stopped  by  police
and  arrested  for  aggravated  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  He  was
convicted of this crime. He spent four days in jail and had to pay fines. (Items 2-4, 7)
In  March  2020,  Applicant  was  consuming  alcohol  while  in  a  state  of  psychosis.
His dog got out of his house and went missing. Applicant drove his car while intoxicated
to attempt to find his dog. While he was driving while intoxicated, he struck a power line
pole  with  his  vehicle.  Police  arrested  him  and  charged  him  with  extreme  DUI  (.15  per
cent blood alcohol content (BAC) or higher). He spent the night in jail. In July 2021, he
pleaded guilty  to a  lesser charge of  reckless driving.  The court suspended  his  driver’s
license  for  90  days  and  ordered  him  to  pay  about  $1,300  in  fines.  The  court  also
ordered  him  to  undergo  an  online  drug  and  alcohol  screening.  As  of  his  June  2020
security  interview,  he  had  not  taken  this  online  screening  and  has  not  provided  any
evidence that he has since completed it. (Items 2-4, 6-8)
Applicant  provided  inconsistent  information  about  his  alcohol  consumption.
During  his  2019  inpatient  hospitalization,  Applicant  reported  his  aforementioned
consumption of a pint of liquor one to two times per week. During his June 2020 security
interview,  he  told  the  investigator  that  he  drinks  four  beers  about  four  to  five  hours
before  he  takes  his prescription  medications.  He  told  the  DOD  licensed  psychiatrist  in
March 2022 that he had not consumed alcohol since his 2020 DUI arrest. He also told
her that he had not consumed alcohol in about eight months. He later told her that it had
been a year since he last had alcohol. In his response to the SOR, he claimed that  he
now rarely drinks alcohol and only has a couple of drinks when he does. He provided no
evidence  that  he  is  permitted  to  consume  alcohol  while  on  his  current  prescription
medication regimen. (Items 2, 5, 7, 8)
Beginning in about June 2013, for a little  over two years, Applicant misused his
employer-issued  company  credit  card  by  using  it  to  pay  about  $86,000  for  personal
expenses. In April 2016, his employer fired him for this credit card misuse. He claimed
that he thought there was an unwritten rule that he could use the company credit card
for personal expenses if he timely paid off his balance. However, he did not timely pay
off  the balance.  He claimed  that he  has  since  satisfied the account  after paying  about
$20,000 on it over two years. He provided no documentary evidence of this resolution.
He claimed that he now understands this misuse was wrong and he has not misused a
company credit card since 2015. (Items 2, 3, 7, 8)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a (using
marijuana  with  varying frequency  from about November 2016  to about May  2022). He
also admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b (intending to continue to use marijuana in the
future), but with an explanation. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
explanation:
Applicant is a 24-year-old test engineer employed by a defense contractor since
March  2022.  At  the  time  he  submitted  his  SCA,  he  was  unmarried  and  lived  with  his
parents.  He  graduated  from  college  with  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  December  2021  and
worked in various non-federal jobs until he was hired for his current position.
When  Applicant submitted  his SCA, he  answered  “Yes” to  the  question  whether
he had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances within the last seven years. He
estimated  that  he  used  marijuana  from  November  2016  through  May  2022.  He  stated
that  his  use  was  “recreational  not  too  often  from  time  to  time.”  He  stated  that  he
intended to use marijuana in the future, explaining,  “I have  friends who  will  be  living  in
states where the drug is legal for recreational use and will possibly use it while visiting.”
(FORM Item 3 at 35-36)
During  a  PSI  on  August  2,  2022,  Applicant  told  an  investigator  that  he  uses
marijuana about once a month with his brother or with friends. He told the investigator
that he does not illegally purchase marijuana but that he obtains it from dispensaries in
adjoining states where it is legal. He also told the investigator that he has not had any
drug counseling or treatment. (FORM Item 4 at 4)
When  Applicant  responded  to  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b,  he  admitted  the
allegation with the following explanation:
I admit  to  1.b  of claiming  to  continue  use  of marijuana  in  the  future  during
initial interviews for security clearance. I  would like  to  add  that as of now I
do   intend   to   stop   the   use   of  marijuana   consumption.  After  speaking   with
someone   more   knowledgeable   of  the   process  for  [obtaining   a]   security
clearance  I am  aware  that use  of marijuana  will  affect  me  being  granted  a
security  clearance.  Not   being   granted   clearance   will   affect  my  livelihood
and  the  use  of marijuana  is not worth  the  overall  problems it may cause  in
my life.
In   the   FORM,  Department  Counsel  argued,  “In   his  SOR  Response,  Applicant
admits his marijuana  use  and  states that he  intends to  stop  using  marijuana. It does not
appear as  though  Applicant has in fact ceased  marijuana  use, which is not compatible
with   holding   a   clearance.”  Applicant  responded   to   Department  Counsel’s  argument  as
follows:
This letter is  to  make  a  correction  to  the  argument that I  have  not stopped
use  of marijuana. My early statement of intention  to  stop  was to  never use
marijuana   again.  I   have   not  had   any   association   with   marijuana   since
October  2022   and   will   not   have   any  association   again.   If   needed   I  can
take  and provide a  drug screening to show proof that I have ceased  use.

"In  Applicant's  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  to  all  of  the  allegations.  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 33-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for

his bachelor's degree in 2013. He was granted a secret clearance in July 2017.
March 2014 and July 2015 violations of company’s substance abuse policy.
(Guideline E - SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). Applicant admitted in his Answer to testing positive
on company drug tests for marijuana in March 2014 and July 2015. After the positive 2014
test he completed a drug treatment program. During a random 2015 urinalysis he tested
positive again for marijuana and was terminated. He cited succumbing to peer pressure
for why he used marijuana again in 2015. (Item 5 at 6, 9.)
From  June  2006  until  May  2022,  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency
(Guideline  H  - SOR  ¶  2.a).  Applicant  listed  in  response  to  interrogatories  that  he  first
used marijuana in June 2006, and he estimated he stopped using it either in April or May
of  2022.  Between  June  2006  and  February 2014,  he  used  it  on  a  weekly basis.  From
February 2014 until his termination in July 2015 he used marijuana  “very sporadically.”
From  July  2015  until  January  2016,  he  used  it  “weekly  to  a  few  times  a  week.”  From
January 2016 until April 2022, he used marijuana  “a few times sporadically.” (Item 5 at
6.)
From  July  2017  until  May  2022,  used  marijuana  with  vary  frequency  while
granted  access  to  classified  information  (Guideline  H  - SOR  ¶  2.b).  Applicant
admitted  he  had  a  “lapse  in  judgment’  when  he  “returned  to  behavior”  that  was  “not
acceptable while having a security clearance.” He stated he let “stressors get to [him].”
(Item  5  at  6.)  On  his  2021  SCA  he  disclosed  he  used  marijuana  occasionally  from
December 2018 until January 2019. (Item 3 at 36.) In response to interrogatories, he said
he used marijuana “a few times sporadically” from January 2016 until April 2022, (Item 5
at 6.)
January 2019 arrest for possession of marijuana. (Guideline J - SOR ¶ 3.a).
Applicant admitted to being arrested for possession of marijuana. He was pulled over for
failing to stop at a posted stop sign. The officer smelled marijuana and questioned him.
He admitted to marijuana possession and showed the officer where it was in his car. He
was  arrested  and  charged  with  “Possession  of  Marijuana  less  than  2  oz.”  He  has  not
heard anything further regarding the charge. (Item 5 at 14.)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  he  did  not  provide  any  updated
evidence to be considered in mitigation. He stated in his SCA that he does not intend to
continue using marijuana because he wants to retain his security clearance. (Item 3 at

at  6.)  He  provided  no  character  evidence  for  consideration  under  the  whole-person
concept.

Applicant  was  first granted a  security  clearance  in 2006,  which  was  renewed  in
2016  following  her  submission  of  an  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations
Processing on September 8, 2016 (2016 e-QIP). Applicant’s submission of her 2019 e-
QIP  was  in  connection  with  her  employer’s  request  that  she  receive  a  Top  Secret
clearance,  which  was  granted  in  2020.  A  subsequent  investigation  was  undertaken  in
response to her employer’s request that Applicant receive eligibility for access to sensitive
compartmented information (SCI). The SOR is based upon new facts about Applicant’s
past  involvement  with  drugs  uncovered  during  the  SCI  investigation  and  her  failure  to
disclose her more recent use of marijuana on her 2016 e-QIP and her 2019 e-QIP. (Tr.

Paragraph 1  - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because of her past drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant used
marijuana on two occasions, December 2013 and May 2016, after having been granted
access  to  classified  information  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  In  her  Answer  Applicant  admitted  the
allegation  under this guideline  and wrote  that,  “I  chose  to use marijuana on  these  two
occasions  knowing  that  I  was  behaving  in  sharp  contrast  to  my  promise  to  the  United
States.”  She  added,  “There  have  been  no  other  times  I  have  used  any  controlled
substance during any time while holding a clearance from 2006 until this day.” (Answer.)
Applicant  testified  that  prior  to  1995  she  had  a  13-year  history  of  being  a  drug
abuser who smoked marijuana and used methamphetamine, almost daily. She also drank
alcohol excessively. In 1988, she was involuntarily hospitalized due an incident involving
excessive  drinking of alcohol.  In  1995  Applicant’s  co-habitant  forced  her to  leave  their
residence  because  of  her  addictions.  She  went  to  live  with  her  sister,  who  assisted
Applicant in becoming sober. Applicant was successful and maintained sobriety  for 17
years through her participation in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and the help of her family.

In  2012  Applicant  started  drinking  alcohol  again  when  she  was  working  as  a
defense contractor on a remote location of a U.S territory. She testified that there was
little  or  no  support  systems  for  someone  with  Applicant’s  history  of  addictions.  She
thought  that  there  was  no  reason  she  could  not  drink  alcohol  like  a  “grown-up.”  Her
consumption of alcohol developed into daily drinking to the point of intoxication. She also
smoked marijuana on two occasions  while granted access to classified information, as
alleged in the SOR (see below). After four years, she left her job in the remote location
and relocated to State 1. She wanted to stop drinking alcohol, but she found it was more
difficult to do that in 2017 than it was the first time. She also started attending NA meetings
again. In 2019, she found employment at a U.S. military base in State 2 and relocated to
State  2  for  her  new  job.  Her  drinking  continued  until  May  2019.  She  finally  found  the
support she needed to control her alcohol consumption. (Tr. at 23-27, 36-38; GE 3 at 6-

Applicant testified that the sister of her former boyfriend urged Applicant to smoke
marijuana with her on two occasions, once in 2013 and again in 2016. Applicant made
the  choice  of  smoking  marijuana  on  both  occasions.  Both  instances  occurred  while
Applicant was visiting her boyfriend on the mainland of the United States. She has not
used any illegal drugs since 2016. (Answer; Tr. at 26-28, 39; GE 3 at 7, 9; GE 4 at 3.)
Paragraph 2  - Guideline  E, Personal Conduct
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for a security clearance because she has engaged in conduct that involves questionable
judgment,  an  unwillingness  to  follow  rules  and  regulations,  a  lack  of  candor,  and
dishonesty. The DoD CAF alleged that Applicant falsified her answer to the question in
Section 23 of the 2016 e-QIP about prior illegal drug use by failing to disclose her use of
marijuana in 2013 (SOR ¶ 2.a). The SOR also alleged under this guideline that Applicant
falsified her answer to the same question in Section 23 of the 2019 e-QIP by failing to
disclose her uses of marijuana in 2013 and 2016 (SOR ¶ 2.b).
In her Answer Applicant admitted both allegations in paragraph 2 of the SOR. She
wrote, “There is no justification I can give for these decisions to falsify my investigations.
It was bad judgment, and I can expect nothing less than having my clearance revoked.”
She added:
I am proud to have the privilege of working for our military. I understand the
responsibility that comes with that privilege and that I have broken the trust
that the U.S. government had in me by making these false statements. I can
assure you that I understand the consequences that our military personnel
and our country could face due to questionable judgment. I can promise you
that my judgment regarding any information that I have been privy to has
never been in question. (Answer at 1.)
Applicant concluded  her comments in  her Answer by writing, “I  want to assure the US
Government of my sincere desire to repair the trust that has been given to me and that I
will continue to be a good steward of that trust.” (Answer at 1.)
At the hearing, Applicant admitted that she deliberately provided a false answer to
the question in Section 23 of the 2016 e-QIP. She testified that she was scared to admit
her  use  of  marijuana  in  2013  because  it  might  make  her  ineligible  to  work  for  her
government contractor. In addition, she was drinking alcohol to excess at the time and
that  clouded  her  judgment.  At  the  time  she  completed  her  2019  e-QIP,  Applicant  had
stopped drinking alcohol. She again did not report her marijuana uses in 2013 and 2016
because she was again afraid of losing her job. At her initial background interview, she
did  not  disclose  her  marijuana  use  in  2013  and  2016.  An  investigator  interviewed
Applicant’s sister in January 2020, and the sister told the investigator about Applicant’s
difficult history with drugs and alcohol and her active participation in NA. (Tr. at 28-31; GE
3 at 4-6; GE 5.)
Applicant’s  sister  advised  Applicant  that  evening  about  the  interview.  Applicant
realized that she had to tell the investigator the truth about her drug history and her use
of marijuana in 2013 and 2016. She wrote the investigator an email the next morning and
admitted to the investigator that she had lied in her interview by not disclosing her past
drug use and her current involvement in NA. The SOR does not contain an allegation that
she provided false information to the investigator. At the hearing, she insisted that she
would  never  again  place  her  own  self-interest  ahead  of  her  national  security
responsibilities. She feels a particularly strong duty to be honest for the sake of our military
members. (Tr. at 31-34; GE 5.)
Psychological Evaluation
The DoD CAF requested that Applicant submit to a psychological evaluation. The
evaluation  was  conducted  by  a  DoD  psychologist  in  May  2021.  He  provided  a  report,
dated June 8, 2021. In his report, the psychologist provided an even-handed prognosis
in  which  he  credited  Applicant  “for  utilizing  her  resources  and  reportedly  maintaining
sobriety  for  17  years.”  He  also  noted  that  “with  the  right  combination  of  support,  she
appears to be able to successfully manage her addiction.” He commented, however, “that
an absence or removal of some of her supports can cause her to fall back into using drugs
or alcohol again, even after long periods of sobriety.” He believes that it cannot be known
if  [Applicant’s  current]  stability  will  be  maintained  or  follow  the  patterns  of  the  past.
Significantly, he wrote that “the disclosure of [Applicant’s] marijuana use in 2013 and 2016
was  not  forthright  and  [was]  only  discovered  by  [an]  offhand  comment  which  raises
concerns  as  to  whether future reportable  events  will  be  brought  forward with  integrity.”
The  Psychologist believes that Applicant “has a  condition  which  impairs her judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness and should be carefully considered.” (GE 4 at 5.)
Mitigation  and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant has worked for the U.S. military for the past 19 years and considers this
work as the best experience of her career. She is a member of NA and attends meetings
regularly. She believes she has a large support system that has helped her maintain her
sobriety.  (Tr. at 17, 34-35.)
Applicant sincerely expressed remorse for lying to the Government about her past.
She admits she lied on her applications out of fear for losing her job. She recognizes that
her  skills  are  transferrable  to  the  private  sector,  but  she  does  not  want  to  lose  the
opportunity to serve the U.S. military. (Tr. at 18-19.)
Prior  to  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  17  character-reference  letters.  Eight
reference  letters  from  professional  contacts  praised  Applicant’s  responsibility  and
dependability.  She  maintains  excellent  security  practices  and  can  be  relied  upon  to
protect classified information. The writers also praise her personal qualities, particularly
her work ethic, honesty, and interpersonal skills. (AE A through H.)
Applicant  also  submitted  seven  reference  letters  from  personal  contacts,  who
praised her reliability, integrity, and authenticity. Friends who know Applicant through their
involvement with her in NA write that Applicant is deeply committed to maintaining her
sobriety.  (AE I through O.)
The  last  two  reference  letters  were  written  by  Applicant’s  sister  and  Applicant’s
adult daughter. Her sister praised Applicant for the progress she has made in her life after
many difficult years struggling with drug addiction while raising a child on her own. She
believes that Applicant today is a strong and trustworthy person. Applicant’s daughter has
witnessed  Applicant’s  struggles  in  life  firsthand  since  she  was  born  in  1984,  and  she
believes that Applicant has grown into a mature and trustworthy person. (AE P and Q.)
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability  for  national  security  eligibility,  the
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief
",True
"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 25 years old. As
of his February 2022 security clearance application (SCA), he was not married, and he
did  not  have  any  children.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2016  and  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in December 2020. He has worked as an engineer for his employer,
a  DOD  contractor,  since  December  2021.  He  has  never  held  a  security  clearance.
(Items 1-3)
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from approximately September
2014  to  October  2022.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  He  used  it  recreationally  and  in  states  where
recreational marijuana use is legal. He used it one to three times weekly while attending
college, and then during weekends in social settings. As of the date of his SCA, he used
it “rarely now, on holidays. [sic] major events, or visiting friends.”  He estimated that he
used  it  approximately  500  times.  He  stated  that  his  use  of  marijuana  neither  impaired
his  ability  to  graduate  from  high  school  or  obtain  his  bachelor’s  degree,  nor  has  it
hindered  him  professionally.  He  obtained  it  from  friends,  or  he  purchased  it  in  states
where  it  is  legal,  and  he  used  it  with  friends.  He  intends  to  continue  using  marijuana,
citing to both his intention to use it infrequently as well as its medicinal benefits. (SOR ¶

around  10  times,  in  small  group  settings, at  live  music  concerts, and  in  private  settings
for  medicinal  purposes.   He  stated   in  his  SCA  that   he   used   them   “for  positive   life
experiences,   mental  health   therapy,   and   general  well-being,”   and   he   found   them   to
“increase   creativity,  connectivity,  and   short-term   happiness.”   He  obtained   them   from
friends,  or  he  purchased  them.  He  intends  to  continue  using  hallucinogens,  citing  to  his
intention   to   use   them   in  a  professional   setting   as  a   safe   and   effective   method   for
encouraging  positive mental health,  as  well as his  intention  to use them  rarely  outside  of
such a setting.  (SOR  ¶  1.d)  He  indicated during his April 2022  background interview that
he  socializes  with individuals who use drugs. (Items  1-3)
Applicant  also  used  stimulants  not  prescribed  to  him,  including  Adderall  and
Vyvanse, with varying frequency from approximately October 2017 to November 2020.
(SOR  ¶  1.e)  He  stated  in  his  SCA  that  he  used  Adderall  “rarely,”  one  to  three  times
yearly  for  a  total  of  seven  times,  “to  increase  focus  in  order  to  complete  school  work
[sic] faster than I normally would.” He indicated during his background interview that he
also  used  Vyvanse  four  times  from  2017  to  2020  for  the  same  purpose.  He  obtained
Adderall from an individual for whom it was prescribed, and he obtained Vyvanse from a
fraternity brother. He stated in his SCA and Answer that he had not used Adderall since
graduating  from  college  and  he  had  no  intention  to  use   such  substances in   the  future.

since June 2021. (Item 3 at 11) He has not served in the military. (Item 3 at 16)
The  allegations  in the  SOR  concern  Applicant’s  sporadic  use  of marijuana from
about June 2016 to about March 2022 (SOR ¶ 1.a); his use of hallucinogenic mushrooms
on approximately three occasions between June 2020 and November 2021 (SOR ¶ 1.b);
and  his  use  of  cocaine  on  approximately  two  occasions  between  July  2020  and  June
2021 (SOR ¶ 1.c).
Applicant used marijuana recreationally with varying frequency while in high school
and college, from about June 2016 to March 2022. Applicant believes he used marijuana
on  no  more  than  40  occasions  over  that  six-year  period.  While  in  college,  he  used
hallucinogenic mushrooms  on  approximately three  occasions  between  June  2020  and
November 2021 and he used cocaine on approximately two occasions between July 2020
and June 2021. (Items 2-4 and Applicant’s Response to the FORM)
Applicant admitted his use of drugs in his SCA, in his adopted subject interview of
July 5, 2022, in his answer to the SOR, and in his response to the FORM. (Items 2-4 and
Applicant’s Response to the FORM). His statements have remained consistent. He stated
he has not used hallucinogenic mushrooms for over 18 months, cocaine for almost two
years,  and  marijuana  for  over  a  year. He  further  stated  he  no  longer  associates  with
friends who continue to use drugs. In his subject interview, he provided the names those
with whom he used drugs and contact information for the friends he still associated with
but whom, he said, also no longer use illegal drugs. He stated he regrets his former drug
use, it was foolish and immature, and he pledges to abstain from any future use. (Items

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  hardware  test  engineer  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  September  2020.  He  attended  a  university  from  August  2011  to  May

The  SOR  alleges  multiple  instances  of  drug  involvement  from  May  2007  to
September 2022. The evidence concerning each of the allegations of drug involvement
alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: use  of  marijuana  with varying frequency  from about  May  2007  to
September   2022.
When  Applicant  submitted  his  SCA,  he  disclosed  that  he  used
marijuana  recreationally  a  “few  times  per  year,”  less  than  100  times  in  his  lifetime,
between  May  2007 and  August 2020.  He  stated that people with whom he associates
use marijuana regularly because it is legal where he lives. He  stated that he  does not
seek it out or use it regularly, but he uses it at social settings such as parties.  (FORM

was  in  the   spring   or  summer  of   2021,  in  a   jurisdiction   where  marijuana   use   is  legal,
when  a  joint of  marijuana  was passed  around  outside  a  bar.  He stated  that he  did not
intend to  use  illegal drugs or controlled substances in the future. (FORM Item 4  at 3-4)

question whether he intended to use illegal substances in the future, he answered “No.”
He explained: “I answered  No, as I do not intend  to use marijuana. My reason  is that I
never  seek  it  out,  it  is  always  a  chance  occasion  that  I  am  offered  it  and  accept.  It  is
very present in [the jurisdiction  where he lives] as  legal recreational use and I reject  it
quite often.” (FORM Item 5 at 15-16)

(Item 2 at 26.) He then noted “if not prohibited to be used for work purposes then I would
most likely continue to use it every so often. But if my work prohibits I will not.” (Item 2 at

occasion and added he does not seek it out. While he expressed that he would “likely”
partake in use in the future he added he would not partake if is required by his employer
to stop. (Item 3 at 8 of interview.) He responded similarly in his interrogatory response.

marijuana in the future.
Applicant occasionally used marijuana from 2017 to October 2021. (Tr. 24; HE 3)
In  2020,  he  purchased  marijuana  on  one  occasion  for  recreational  use.  (Tr.  26)
Sometimes he used marijuana once a week, and sometimes he did not use marijuana for
several months. (Tr. 27, 45) When he used marijuana in 2020 and 2021, which was during
the  pandemic,  he  was  alone  at  home.  (Tr.  27)  He  was  aware  that  his  marijuana
involvement was illegal under federal law. (Tr. 26, 28) He did not use marijuana or any
other illegal drugs while working for a DOD contractor. (Tr. 28-29) He had one test for
illegal drugs in 2022, and he did not test positive. (Tr. 29) In his SOR response, Applicant
said he had no intention of using marijuana again. (HE 3)
Applicant  said  he  chose  to  end  his  marijuana  use  because  of  its  effects  on  his
health. (Tr. 30) He said marijuana use caused him to feel anxious, and he was worried
about  someone  walking  past  his  door  and  smelling  marijuana  smoke.  (Tr.  30,  40)  A
secondary reason for ending his marijuana use was his applications for employment and
concern about passing pre-employment drug tests. (Tr. 53-54; GE 2)
Applicant  provided  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse
is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (AE A) See AG ¶ 26(b)(3), infra.
On  March  27,  2023,  Applicant  received  a  drug-use  evaluation.  (AE  P)  The
evaluation states:
He began  experimenting  with  marijuana  in 2017  using  it in a  recreational
setting   if  his  friends   had   it.  In   2019,   he   .   .  .   would   occasionally  go   to   the
dispensary to  use  for anxiety  and  relaxation.  He denied  his THC use  has
ever  crossed   over  into   a   problem   and   he   has  never  had   a   problem   with
stopping  the  use  of the  drug. He  denied  any  other type  of illicit drug  use.
(AE P at 1)
In  his  evaluation,  Applicant  “denied  ever  having  a  problem  with  alcohol  or
marijuana.  He  has  no  plans  to  use  the  drug  now  or  in  the  future.  There  is  no
recommendation for treatment at this time.” (AE P at 2)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges Applicant minimized the extent of his marijuana use on his April
9, 2022 SCA when he said that he used marijuana “[a]pproximately 10 times total” during
the previous seven years. (GE 1). SOR ¶ 2.c alleges he said on his SCA that he did not
intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future  “due  to  paranoia  and  lack  of feeling  in  control  of
personal actions.” (Id.)
A  May  17,  2022  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  summary  of  personal
subject interview (PSI), indicates Applicant told the investigator:
Subject  first smoked  marijuana  in or about Sep  2017. He  smoked  the  drug
with  friends. He  did not smoke  marijuana  again until 2019.  From  2019  to
about Oct  2021, Subject smoked  marijuana  36  to  40  times, discrepant.  He
advised  that he  listed  10  times on  his security clearance  paperwork because
he  wanted  to  minimize  the  amount  of  his  usage. Subject stated  his  decision
to  falsify his security clearance  paperwork pertaining  to  his  marijuana  use
[was] deliberate and willful.
From   2019   to   Oct  2021,  Subject  would  purchase   his  marijuana   from
dispensaries in [a  state] where  recreational usage  is legal. Subject  stated
he   stopped   smoking   marijuana   in  or  about   Oct   2021   because   he   was
applying for jobs and was concern[ed]  he would not pass a  drug test.
Subject  was  asked  about  his future  intent  regarding  marijuana  usage,  and
he  advised  it  is highly probable  that  he’ll  use  marijuana  in the  future.  Subject
was asked  if he  would  smoke  marijuana  in  the  future  knowing  that  it  violates
federal law; he  advised  yes.  However, he  initially stated  that  he  would not
smoke   marijuana   while   holding   a   clearance.  Shortly   thereafter,  he
transitioned   his  answer  that  there   was   a   reasonable   chance   he   would
smoke  marijuana  while  holding  a  security clearance  even  if it violated  policy
and  federal law.
Subject  was asked  what  [other]  federal law he  feels  he  does not have  to
comply with. He  advised  this is the  only federal  law he  does not comply with.
Subject  was asked  if it showed  poor judgement that  he  violated  and  is willing
to   violate   federal  law;  he   advised   yes  that  it   does  show  poor  judgement.
Subject was asked  if a  person  that exercises poor judgement should  hold a
security clearance. He  stated  no.  He was  asked  if  he  should be  granted  a
security clearance  and  he  advised  yes.  He stated  after further reflection, he
has decided  not to use  marijuana  in  the  future  as  long as it  violates  federal
law or violates security clearance rules.
Subject denied any other illegal drug use. (GE 2)
Applicant  had   an   opportunity  to   submit  corrections  to   the   summary  of  the   OPM
interview, and  he failed to  make  corrections because of “a lack of due diligence.” (Tr. 37,
52) At his hearing, he  said he  told  the  OPM  investigator he  used  marijuana  36  to  40  times
based  on  use  every two  weeks over a  19-month  period  from  2020  to  2021. (Tr. 45-46) As
to  the  number of his marijuana uses, he  said “I do  not believe  it’s an  inaccurate  number,
but I am  not  sure  of  the  exact number.”  (Tr. 48, 62-63) He estimated  the  true  number of
marijuana  uses to  be  in  the  mid-20s  or more generally between  10  and  40  times. (Tr. 49,
63) He acknowledged  he  may have  underreported  his marijuana  use  on  his SCA,  and  he
may have  given  the  OPM  investigator an  inaccurate  number of marijuana  uses due  to
being “flustered” and  out of a desire to be cooperative and to agree  with the investigator.
(Tr. 50, 59)  He denied  that he  deliberately underreported  his marijuana  uses on  his SCA,
and  he  insisted  “[a]t  the  time  [he] filled  it out [he] believed  it was, approximately 10.” (Tr.
60-61)
As to  his future  intentions about marijuana  use, Applicant  told  the  OPM  investigator
“to   his  knowledge”  he   did  not  intend   to   use   marijuana   in   the   future.  (Tr.  33-34)  The
investigator  interpreted   the   words  “to   his  knowledge”  to   be   an   equivocal  denial  of  his
intention  not to  use  marijuana, and  the  investigator pressured  Applicant on  this issue. (Tr.
33-35) Applicant attempted  to  convey to  the  OPM  investigator that  he  did  not intend  to
use   marijuana   in   the   future;   however,  he   “tripped   over  [him]self  and   said,   in  kind   of
thinking  [he] said no  at the  time, or the  only other answer in this situation, is yes.” (Tr. 57)
He was “kind  of  scrambl[ing]  to  pick up  the  pieces in  a  sense.”  (Tr. 58) He was  flustered
and   did   not  “know exactly  why  [he]  said   that”  there   was   a   good   chance   he   would  use
marijuana in  the future. (Tr. 58)
Applicant said the OPM investigator questioning caused him to become “flustered”
and he felt pressured. (HE 3) The OPM investigator used “napkin math” to increase the
number of estimated marijuana uses to 36 to 40 times, and during the interview, Applicant
agreed  with  the  estimate.  (Tr.  31;  HE  3;  GE  2)  He  did  not  have  a  precise  number  of
marijuana uses. (Tr. 31) He denied that he said he “willfully and deliberately falsified [his]
application to minimize [his] marijuana usage.” (Tr. 31; HE 3) He denied that he intended
to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 36, 38)
Character Evidence
Three  coworkers,  including  his  manager,  and  two  friends  from  his  university
praised his good character and/or contributions to his employer. (Tr. 41-43; AE K-AE O)
The general sense of their statements and his academic records is that he is exceptionally
intelligent, diligent, skilled, talented, dedicated, responsible, and professional employee.

"Applicant  is  52  years old.  He  is  married  a  second  time,  and  has  four  children,
ages 29, 25, 23, and 20.  He holds a Master’s degree.  He is employed by a defense
contractor  as  a  Software  Developer.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in
connection with his employment.
The  Government  alleges  that  the  Applicant  has  engaged  in  the  illegal  use  of
controlled  substances  that  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a
manner  inconsistent  with  their  intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an
individual’s  reliability  and  trustworthiness,  and  his  ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with
laws, rules, and regulations.
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant:  a.  used  marijuana  from  about  1999  to
November  2019,  and  intends  to  keep  using  marijuana;  b.  used  marijuana  while
possessing  a  security  clearance  from  January  2016  until  November  2019;  c.  used
hallucinogenic mushrooms while holding a security clearance in June 2018; and d. was
charged  with  marijuana  possession  and  placed  on  probation  in  2000.  Applicant
admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  (See Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  Reserves  from  1989  through  1998,  and
received  an  honorable  discharge.
Following  his  military  service,  he  obtained
employment  in  the  defense  industry,  working  for  a  defense  contractor  as  a  civilian.
(Government
Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  December  2010.
Exhibit 3.)
In March 2012, Applicant completed a security clearance application and applied
In  the  application  he
for  a  security  clearance  for  the  first  time  as  a  civilian.
acknowledged  that  he  had  used  marijuana  from  about  March  1999  until  July  2009,  “a
couple times a week”.  In response to the question concerning whether he intended to
use  marijuana  in  the  future,  he  marked,  “No.”  Applicant  was  not  granted  a  security
clearance.  (Government Exhibit 5.)
Three  years  later,  in  February  2015,  Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance
application.  In  this  application  he  stated  that  his  marijuana  use  ended  in  June  2010,
rather than July 2009, as he had stated in his 2012 application.  Applicant stated that he
did  not  intend to use marijuana  again,  and  that  it does  not  interest  him like  it  used  to.
He also stated that he had distanced himself from friends who had encouraged the use
of pot.  Applicant was granted a security clearance.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
In  December  2019,  Applicant  completed  another  security  clearance  application.
In this application Applicant stated that he had resumed using marijuana in September
2015.  He  also  stated  that  between  2015  and  2018,  he  smoked  marijuana  with  his
friends  about  twice  a  year  at  social  gatherings.  He  explained  that  after  the  state  in
which  he  resides  legalized  the  use  of  marijuana  in  December  2018,  he  increased  his
marijuana  consumption  to  a  couple  of  times  a  week  at  social  gatherings.  Applicant
further  stated  that  he  has  not  used  marijuana  since  November  2019.
In  response  to
whether  he  intended  to  continue  using  marijuana,  Applicant  initially  stated  that  he  did
not intend to use marijuana again, but then qualified his response by stating that he did
not  know  if  he  could  say  that  he  would  never  use  it  again,  outside  of  a  rare  social
gathering, but doubted that he would use it again.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
In January 2020, during Applicant’s personal subject interview, Applicant told the
investigator that he probably would use marijuana again since it was legal and socially
acceptable  in  the  state.  Applicant  further  stated  that  he  socializes  and  works  with
people  involved  in  the  use  of  marijuana  that  is  legal  in  his  state  but  illegal  Federally.
Applicant  listed  a  friend  and  coworker  that  he  uses  marijuana  with  as  one  of  his
references  in  his  2019  security  clearance  application.  Applicant’s  step-father,  who
Applicant visits a few times a year, also uses marijuana.  (Government Exhibit 6.)
Regarding Applicant’s use of hallucinogenic mushrooms in 2018 while holding a
security  clearance,  Applicant  also  told  the  investigator  that  his  friend  and  co-worker
referenced above is the individual who provided him with the mushrooms and they used
them at the coworker’s house.  (Government Exhibit 6.)
In his response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he understands that marijuana
possession  is  a  federal  crime  and  he  has  no  reservations  about  stopping  his  use  of
marijuana as long as he has a security clearance.  (Government Exhibit 2.)

Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  2006,  and  he  attended  college  from
September 2011 to March 2012 but did not earn a degree. He previously worked for two
defense contractors, from approximately July 2006 to August 2008 and then August 2008
to February 2018, respectively. As of the date of the hearing and since March 2018, he
has  worked  in  the  field  of  information  technology  for  his  current  employer,  another
defense  contractor.  He  was  first  granted  a  security  clearance  in  approximately  2008.

Applicant first used marijuana and cocaine in high school. He used them socially
with friends. He used marijuana approximately once weekly and cocaine approximately
once or twice a year. He used marijuana approximately 100 times from January 2006 to
December 2017. He also used cocaine, approximately five times, from December 2006
to December 2017. He used the drugs socially, and they were provided by friends, his
brother, or his now-deceased girlfriend. He disclosed his illegal drug use on his 2019 SCA
and he discussed it during his June 2019 background interview.  (Answer; Tr. at 40-49,
82, 98-100, 102-106; GE 1, 3)
In approximately 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession and
intent to distribute marijuana. This was his only drug-related offense. He was at a social
gathering,  and  he  went  with  a  friend  so  that  the  friend  could  obtain  marijuana  for
consumption at the gathering. The friend drove his car. He did not have marijuana on his
person, but the police officer found approximately an ounce of marijuana in his car. He
pled guilty to simple possession, received probation before judgment, and the charge was
subsequently  expunged.  He  discussed  this  incident  during  his  June  2019  background
interview,  and  he  stated  therein,  reiterated  in  his  Answer,  and  testified  that  he  did  not
disclose this arrest on his 2019 SCA due to oversight. He completed the SCA within two
to  three  hours  and  he  did  not  give  it  the  appropriate  attention  that  he  should  have.

In July 2006, Applicant completed an FD-316, or “Access of Non-FBI personnel to
FBI Facilities Background Data Information Form.” After he completed the  form, he was
arrested and charged with possession and intent to distribute marijuana, as discussed
above.  He  maintained  that  he  did  not  falsify  the  FD-316  form  because  he  had  not  yet
been arrested when he completed it. In September 2006, the FBI denied Applicant “. . .
access to FBI facilities, due to drug-related arrests that were not indicated”  on his July
2006  FD-316.  He  resubmitted  for  access  with  the  FBI  after  his  drug  charge  was
expunged, and the FBI granted him a clearance in 2008. (Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 44-45,
82-98, 117; GE 1, 3, 5-7)
Applicant indicated during his June 2019 background interview, reiterated in his
Answer, and testified that he did not disclose the FBI’s 2006 denial of his access to FBI
facilities  on  his  2019  SCA  due  to  oversight.  He  reiterated  that  he  completed  the  SCA
within two to three hours and he did not give it the appropriate attention that he should
have. He only remembered that his access to FBI facilities had been granted when he
completed the 2019 SCA and he forgot that it had been previously denied, as discussed
above. (Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 82-98, 117; GE 1, 3, 5-7)
Applicant first consumed alcohol in high school. In approximately 2012, Applicant
was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI). This was his first DUI.
He stated that he consumed a beer at a hockey game and then went to a bar for dinner,
where he consumed another beer and a shot of liquor. He drove home, which was less
than a mile from the bar.  His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .11%.  The  charge  was
nolle  prosequi  and  he  received  six  weeks  of  court-ordered  alcohol  treatment.  He
discussed this DUI during his June 2019 background interview, and he indicated therein
that he did not disclose this DUI on his 2019 SCA because he mistakenly believed he
was not required to since it occurred more than seven years prior. He reiterated that he
completed  the  SCA  within  two  to  three  hours  and  he  did  not  give  it  the  appropriate
attention that he should have. (Tr. at 49-52, 82-85, 106-107, 113-114; GE 3, 4)
In approximately June 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. This
was  his  second  DUI.  He  was  at  a  sports  bar  with  several  co-workers  and  his  former
supervisor after attending his father’s memorial service. He consumed approximately four
double mixed drinks and drove home. His BAC was .16%. In October 2014, he pled guilty
to misdemeanor DUI and was sentenced to three days in jail and one year of probation.
He  was  ordered  to  complete  an  18-week  court-ordered  outpatient  alcohol  treatment
program and abstain from alcohol during his year of probation. He consumed alcohol on
one  occasion and  consequently failed  a  drug  test,  but then abided by the  court’s order
and successfully completed the program and probation. He disclosed this DUI on his 2019
SCA  and  discussed  it  during  his  June  2019  background  interview.  Since  this  DUI,  he
consumes only a couple of beers at home or when he is entertaining clients approximately
once monthly. (Tr. at 52-63, 82-85, 107-108; GE 1, 3, 4)
Applicant  last  used  marijuana  and  cocaine  in  2017.  He  reached  a  turning  point
after he lost his father and girlfriend in 2014 and 2017, respectively. His girlfriend of three
years, who was not a drug user, died of an accidental overdose after she snorted a pain
pill that, unbeknownst to her, contained fentanyl. She died in his home, and he witnessed
it.  He  stated  that  he  does  not  socialize  with  drug  users.  He  stated  that  his  previous
roommate, who he sees on occasion, no longer uses drugs. As of the date of the hearing,
his  seven-year-old  niece  and  his  brother,  who  previously  provided  him  with  and  used
illegal drugs, lived with him. He stated that his brother was two years clean and part of a
Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  program.  He  stated  that  he  has  no  future  intention  to  use
marijuana or other illegal drugs, and that if he were to find himself in a situation where
illegal drugs were being used, he would leave. He stated that he learned from the 2019
security  clearance  process  the  effect  that  any  criminal  involvement  would  have  on  his
career, and he was committed to not doing anything that would jeopardize it. (Answer; Tr.

multi-vehicle  collision,  and he  was charged  with  aggravated  DUI resulting  in great bodily
harm.  Applicant  said the  accident was not  his fault.  (Tr. 71) The  accident was at  about

when   he   was  at  dinner.  (Tr.  71)  The   accident  occurred   at  about   10   p.m.  (Tr.  71)   One
report said he  had  a  breathalyzer which  registered  .075  (no  time  specified  in the  report);

Applicant  said  they  tested  urine  samples  in  the  jail,  and  they  found  cocaine
metabolites in his urinalysis sample; however, he disagreed with this finding. (Tr. 76, 101)
He  was  taking  Adderall  for  ADHD,  and  it  was  not  detected  in  the  test.  (Tr.  76-77)  He
believed they switched his urine sample with one of the other prisoners. (Tr. 101) Forty-
eight hours after he was arrested, he had a blood test, which was negative for the cocaine
metabolite. (Tr. 103, 106) I asked Applicant to provide a copy of the blood test results
after his hearing; however, he did not provide them. (Tr. 116)
Applicant was arrested for failure to appear on March 6, 2023, and he was released
on March 13, 2023. (Tr. 79-80, 96) Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI in order to get released
from  jail.  (Tr.  82)  He  was  placed  on  probation  for  18  months.  (Tr.  109)  He  intends  to
appeal his conviction. (Tr. 82) He was unaware of the status of the civil lawsuit the woman
seriously injured in the accident filed against him. (Tr. 83; GE 5)
Applicant told the police officer he drank a double vodka at about 5:00 p.m., and
he said he had not smoked marijuana in the previous three days. (Tr. 86; GE 4 at 19)
The  woman  who  was  seriously  injured  in  the  accident  on  July  22,  2019,  was
pregnant. In her lawsuit, she seeks damages from Applicant in the amount of $50,000.
(GE 4) The lawsuit states Applicant was under the influence of alcohol and/or marijuana
at the time of the accident.
Applicant was arrested or served with papers in the summer of 2022 for not paying
his child support. (Tr. 60, 68) He said, “they put me in jail twice to pay child support in a
total amount of $9,000 one time, and then $6,000 the next time. So, that’s $15,000. So,
how could I possibly owe them anything?” (Tr. 59) The hearing is supposed to clarify the
amount  of  his  child  support  payments,  and  possibly  designate  who  should  take  the
deductions  for  the  children  for  income  tax  purposes.  (Tr.  59-62)  He  had  a  hearing
scheduled the last week of March 2023 concerning child support payments. (Tr. 58-59)
He believes his child support is current. (Tr. 60)
Personal Conduct-Falsification of SCA
SOR ¶¶ 4.b, 4.c, and 4.d allege Applicant failed to disclose on his April 23, 2020
SCA the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 3.b in response to questions
about felony charges, charges involving alcohol and illegal drugs, and involvement with
marijuana in the previous seven years.
In his April 23, 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed: his 2017 or 2018 domestic violence
charges which was dismissed; his emergency order of protection in 2019 was denied; his
aggravated  DUI  charge  in  2019  was  pending;  and  he  was  accused  of  violation  of
parenting order or plan in 2020 (GE 1 at 32-39) He did not disclose any alcohol offenses
except  the  2019  DUI  or  any  drug  offenses  or  involvement  in  response  to  the  specific
questions about alcohol-related charges and drug involvement. (GE 1)
On November 4, 2019, Applicant confirmed to an OPM investigator that his only
arrest for or charge of DUI was in 2019, and he did not have any drug-related charges.
(OPM ROI at 6) He was confronted with and confirmed marijuana possession charges in
1995, 2003, and 2011. (Id. at 6-9; SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i) He confirmed: his 1997 DUI
arrest and conviction in 2000, and his arrest in 1998, for obstruction of justice/destruction
of evidence. (OPM ROI at 8; SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h) He indicated he used marijuana from
August 1986 to August 2019, and his average use was three or four times a month. (OPM
ROI at 9) He said he “has never tested  positive on  a  drug  test.”  (Id. at 10) He told the
OPM investigator that he believed he was only required to disclose marijuana offenses
and DUIs in the previous seven years. (Id. at 6-9) In his response to DOHA interrogatories
he  explained  the  urinalysis  test  result  showing  cocaine  metabolites  found  in  his  urine
sample  were  erroneous,  and  he  predicted  the  charges  would  be  removed  from  his
records. (GE 2 at 2)
At his hearing, Applicant said he  had  no  idea  he  was charged  with  the  felonies in
SOR ¶  1.g. (Tr. 89) He  misread  the  question  concerning  alcohol  and  drug  offenses.  (Tr.
90-91) He thought he  only had  to  disclose  the  offenses in the  last  seven  years. (Tr. 90-
91)

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - 1.c  without  further  comment,  but  provided
comments  in  his  January  17,  2022,  response  to  DOHA’s  interrogatories  and  his
December 2, 2022, response to the Government’s proposed evidence to the FORM. His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 62-year-old contractor. He has been divorced twice, has one adult
child,  and  currently  lives  with  a  long-term  partner.  (Item  3  at  17-19)  He  earned  his
bachelor’s  degree  in  2004  and  his  master’s  degree  in  2014.  (Item  3  at  11-12) He  has
been employed as a contractor since 1981. (Item 3 at 12-14) He has never served in the
military. (Item 3 at 15)
The  allegations in  the  SOR concern Applicant’s long-term  use  of  marijuana  from
about September  1976  to  about January 2022  (SOR   ¶   1.a);  his  use  of  marijuana  from
about April 2009  to  August 2013  while granted  access to  classified  information  (SOR ¶
1.b);  and  his use  of  marijuana  from  about May  2018  to  January 2022  after completing  his
SCA on   May   24, 2021,   and   his   intention   to   continue   to   use   Marijuana   (SOR  ¶   1.c).
[Because  the  SCA was submitted  in May  2021, May  2018 appears  to  be  alleged  in error
and should have  been  May 2021.]
In   his  interrogatory  response,   in  which he    adopted   his  June   2021  background
interview after making  corrections and  clarifications,  Applicant  admitted  using  marijuana
since  1976  and  “on  and  off  for over four decades,  but  recently once  a  week  in  accordance
with  a  prescription.”  He  stated  he  consumed  infrequently when  he  held his clearance  at
a  defense  contractor but then  stopped  while he  held a  clearance  at subsequent defense
contractor. He  did   not state   whether he   had  access to   classified   material at   the   time   he
was using  and  working  for a  contractor. He  stated  he  stopped  in 2013  after his polygraph
and then resumed  use  sometime in  2018 when he got a prescription  for medical use. He
states he  consumes it responsibly for anxiety  and  pain  and  that he  intends  to  consume
marijuana  “legally and  per the  medical prescription.”  He stated  he  did not need  to  use
marijuana  and  would find  alternatives if his continued  use  would affect his employment.
He  has not    received   drug   counselling  or    attended  a   drug   education  class.   His   use  is
evaluated  by a  physician. (Item  4  at 13) He has never sold it and  only purchases small
quantities for personal use. (Item 4  at A-2)
Applicant stated he considers “marijuana an  organic, natural herb that helps [him]
with  anxiety and  pain” and  that he  does not “want to  use  synthetic drugs.” He states he
consumes  marijuana  “responsibly, legally with  a  prescription  and  in such  a  way  that  does
not  compromise [his]   work  performance, ability  to   keep   a   secret   or  to   be   the   target  of
espionage…”  He  states he  would prefer to  continue  his use  of prescription  marijuana  but
does not wish to “forfeit a clearance over it.” (Item 4 at A-3)
Applicant responded  to  the  FORM  on  December 2, 2022, acknowledging  “in   the
past  that [his] occasional use  of  marijuana  was prohibited  under federal law” and  states
he  is contrite  about  his objectionable  behavior. He  states  he  never used  marijuana  during
work hours or came  to  work under its influence. He  argues his use  has no  bearing  on  his
judgement or ability to  keep  a  secret.  He  requests a  favorable clearance  determination
but notes he  does “not expect  a  change  in  disposition  to  a  favorable decision  to  be  cleared
again due to [his] continued use of marijuana.” (Answer to FORM)
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the

Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen. He travels extensively for work. He lives in
the United States when he is not on an overseas  assignment. His fiancée and his two
children  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Laos.  He  met  her  in  about  2014  when  he  was
working on a project in Laos. He talks with her daily over the Internet, and he spends as
much time as he can in Laos. Their two children were born in Laos. His fiancée also has
two older children from another relationship. Applicant provides her with regular support
of  at  least  $1,000  per  month  and  sometimes  much  more.  (Tr.  at  22-28,  31-38,  41-43;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, B, H)
Applicant’s  fiancée   used   to   work  in  a   restaurant.   She   then   tried   some   small
businesses.  She  now  relies   primarily  on   his   support.  Because   he   travels  so   much   for
work,  it  is  impractical  at  this  time   for  her  to   immigrate   with   the   children   to   the   United
States. She  is better off  in Laos with  her family and  support system  in place. (Tr. at 39-
45; GE 2)
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  when  he  was  in  high  school.  He  did  not  smoke  it
again until late 2010 or early 2011 when he was drunk at a New Year’s Eve party. He
held a  security  clearance  at  the time.  He tested  positive on a test administered by  his
employer.  As  discipline,  he  was  suspended  for  two  weeks  without  pay.  (Tr.  at  46-50;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE F)
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  he  has  not  knowingly  smoked  or  otherwise
ingested  marijuana  since  the  failed  drug  test  in  2011.  He  tested  positive  for  THC,  the
active ingredient in marijuana, in a test administered by his employer in April 2020. He
smoked  cigarettes  for years, and  for  some  time  before  the  failed  drug  test,  he  used a
vape pen to inhale the vapor of liquids, primarily with nicotine. He purchased vape liquid
without noticing that it was a cannabidiol or CBD. He lives in a state where marijuana is
illegal, so he did not expect a legitimate store to sell a product with marijuana or THC.
He used the vape to smoke the CBD product, which must have contained some amount
of THC, resulting in the positive test. (Tr. at 50-58; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE I)
The  Security  Executive  Agent  for  the  United  States  Government  provided
clarifying guidance concerning marijuana on December 21, 2021. Part of that guidance
addressed CBD products:
With  respect to  the  use  of CBD  products,  agencies should be  aware  that
using   these   cannabis   derivatives   may  be   relevant   to   adjudications  in
accordance   with   SEAD  4.   Although   the   passage   of  the   Agricultural
Improvement  Act of  2018  excluded  hemp  from  the  definition  of  marijuana
within  the   Controlled   Substances   Act,   products  containing   greater  than   a
0.3   percent   concentration   of   delta-9   tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC),  a
psychoactive  ingredient in marijuana, do  not  meet the  definition  of  “hemp.”
Accordingly,   products   labeled   as   hemp-derived   that  contain   greater  than
0.3   percent  THC  continue   to   meet   the   legal   definition   of  marijuana,  and
therefore  remain   illegal  to   use   under  federal  law  and   policy.  Additionally,
agencies should be  aware  that the  Federal Drug  Administration  does not
certify  levels of   THC in  CBD products,   so   the   percentage  of  THC cannot
be   guaranteed,  thus  posing   a   concern  pertaining   to   the   use   of  a   CBD
product under federal law.  Studies have   shown  that   some   CBD products
exceed   the   0.3   percent   THC  threshold   for  hemp,   notwithstanding
advertising  labels (Reference  F). Therefore,  there is a  risk that using  these
products  may nonetheless cause  sufficiently high  levels of THC to  result in
a   positive  marijuana   test   under  agency-administered   employment  or
random  drug  testing  programs. Should an  individual test positive,  they will
be   subject  to   an   investigation   under  specific  guidelines  established   by
their home agency.  (GE 5)
The  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services  Administration  (SAMSHA)
provided a warning about CBD products on July 24, 2019:
that   some   CBD  products’
Studies   have   shown
labeling   does  not
accurately  reflect  their  content.   Cannabis  based   products  containing   a
THC   level  greater  than   0.3%  on   a  dry  weight  basis  do   not  fall   under  the
Farm   Bill’s  definition   of  hemp   even   if  they   are  labeled   as  such.   In   one
study,  the   amount  of   CBD  in  69%  of  the   84   tested   CBD  products  was
inconsistent  with   that  on   the   label,   and   some   products  contained
unlabeled   cannabinoids,  including   THC  in   amounts   up   to   6.4   mg/mL.   As
such,  an   employee’s  drug   test  may  be   positive  for  the   THC  metabolite,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA), due  to  THC in the
CBD product. (GE 6)
SAMSHA  further  advised  that  “federal  agencies  should  make  every  effort  to
inform  applicants  and  employees  of  the  risk  that  using  such  products  may  result  in  a
positive marijuana test.” (GE 6)
Applicant  passed  a  number  of  drug  tests.  He  is  now  extremely  cautious  when
purchasing vape products to ensure that he does not purchase any CBDs or marijuana-
related products. (Tr. at 58-59; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE G, I)
Applicant called  a witness, and he  submitted documents and letters attesting  to
his  excellent  job  performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  work
ethic, reliability, trustworthiness, dependability, honesty, judgment, and integrity. (Tr. at

"In  the  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  with  additional
comments. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked
for his current employer since February 2016. He earned a high school diploma in 2010
and  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  December  2015.  He  has  been  married  since  December

From  about  September  2011  until  March  2014,  Applicant  purchased  and  used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  in  social  settings  while  he  attended  college.  In  April
2017, in his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (2017 SF 86), he claimed that
he  had no intention  to use  illegal drugs  in the  future.  He  reaffirmed  his intention to no
longer  use  marijuana  or  other  illegal  drugs  during  his  2018  security  interview.
Notwithstanding  his  prior  marijuana  involvement,  the  DOD  granted  him  access  to
classified  information  in  about  November  2018.  Despite  his  stated  intention  to  avoid
illegal  drug  involvement,  he  used  marijuana  in  January  2019,  May  2019,  and  March
2021, while he was granted access to classified information. He used marijuana these
three times socially with friends He also purchased marijuana on at least one of these
occasions. In his June 2021 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (2021 SF 86),
he stated that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future, but that he might use it
because  he  thought  marijuana  use  should  be  legalized.  He  reiterated  this  sentiment
during  his  June  2021  security  interview,  telling  the  DOD  investigator  that  marijuana
should  be  legal  under  federal  law,  and  implying  that  he  knew  best  about  whether  he
could use it. He also acknowledged that he was violating his employer’s drug use policy
when  he  used  marijuana.  He  last  used  marijuana  in  March  2021.  He  has  not  used  or
purchased any other illegal drugs. (Tr. 20-21, 25-33, 37-39; Answer; GE 1-4, AE A-C)

that  he  has  matured  since  he  last  used  marijuana  and  last  opined  that  he  would  be
open  to  using  it.  He  claimed  that  he  is  now  ashamed  of  the  statements  he  made
regarding marijuana use in his 2021 SF 86 and during his June 2021 security interview.
He  credits  the  birth  of  his  son  and  his  overall  maturation  process  with  changing  his
perspective. He claimed that having a child, with another on the way, has led him to put
his  family  first,  and  to  look  out  for  their  best  interests,  instead  of  his  own.  He  also
claimed that he now understands that he must abide by the  federal prohibition against
marijuana use regardless  of  whether he agrees  with it. He  volunteered his  illegal drug
use in his 2017 SF 86 and his 2021 SF 86 and discussed it openly with the investigators
during his security interviews in August 2018 and June 2021. (Tr. 20-22, 33-37; Answer;

Applicant continues to associate with some of the individuals with whom he used
marijuana in the past, but they have not used it in his presence since March 2021. He is
unaware  of  whether  they  continue  to  use  marijuana.  His  wife  does  not  use  marijuana
and  there  is  no  marijuana  in  his  house.  He  provided  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to
abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future
misuse  is  grounds  for  automatic  revocation  of  his  security  clearance  eligibility.  I
observed him while he testified and found him to be sincere and credible. His reporting
of  derogatory  information  regarding  his  illegal  drug  use,  including,  paradoxically,  his
earlier openness to continuing to use marijuana in the future, bolsters his credibility. (Tr.

"Applicant is 32 years old, married, with two children ages four and five. (Item 3.)
From September 2009 to May 2013, he went to college in State A, where he earned his
bachelor’s degree. From  November 2013  to  August 2019, he  held a  number of jobs in
State A. From September 2019 to June 2021, he lived in State B, where he earned his
graduate degree. He then returned to State A in July 2021, where he currently lives. His
clearance sponsor is a federal contractor. This is his first security clearance application.
(Items 3 and 4.)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  purchased  and  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency from March 2011 to about June 2021.  (Item 1.) Applicant admitted the SOR
allegations.  (Item  2.)  In  his  SCA,  he  elaborated  on  his  marijuana  use.  He  “smoked
marijuana  in  college…[took]  edibles  rarely  over  the  last  couple  years…[maybe]  once
every couple weeks.” Marijuana is currently legal in State B. If marijuana is legal in State
A, he “may use it in the future in a social setting.” (Item 3.)
In his July 27, 2022 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), Applicant further explained
his marijuana use and his intentions for future use. He confirmed the approximate dates
of  his  past  marijuana  use.  His  statements  in  the  PSI  about  future  use,  however,  are
inconsistent.  On the one hand, he said he stopped using marijuana in July 2021, when
he returned to State A, where marijuana is illegal. On the other hand, he said he intends
to use marijuana in the future because it is legal in State A and State B. In his response
to  an  interrogatory,  he  said  his  intent  is  to  use  “occasionally  if  legal  in  location.”  In
response to the query “do you intend to use marijuana . . . in the future,” he checked the
answer “No.” (Item 4.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
that  security
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
for  a  security  clearance,  an
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are
flexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the
whole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  The  protection  of  the  national  security  is  the  paramount  consideration.  AG  ¶
¶2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶   E3.1.14,   the   Government   must  present  evidence   to   establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel  . . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
Discussion
Under Adjudicative Guideline (AG) H, suitability of an applicant may be questioned
or put into doubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about
a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG ¶ 24 sets
forth the concern in more detail below:
The  illegal  use  of  controlled  substances,  to  include  the  misuse  of
prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances
that  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner
inconsistent  with  their  intended  purpose  can  raise  questions  about  an
individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may
lead  to  physical  or  psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises
questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,
and regulations. Controlled substance means any ""controlled substance"" as
defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in
this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying
conditions:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and
AG ¶  25(c)  illegal possession of a controlled substance.
Applicant  admitted  that  he  purchased  and  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency from March 2011 to June 2021.  Facts admitted by an applicant in an
answer to an SOR or in an interview require no further proof from the Government.
ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (“any admissions [applicant]
made  to  the  SOR  allegations  .  .  .  relieve  Department  Counsel  of  its  burden  of
proof”);  ISCR  Case  No.  94-0569  at  4  and  n.1  (App.  Bd.  Mar.  30,  1995)  (“[a]n
applicant’s admissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal basis
for an Administrative Judge’s findings”).
Possession  of  marijuana  is  regulated  by  the  federal  government  under  the
Controlled  Substances  Act.  21  U.S.C.  §  811  et  seq.  The  knowing  or  intentional
possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and punishable by imprisonment,
a  fine or both. 21 U.S.C.  § 844.  In an October 25, 2014 memorandum, the Director of
National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is a security concern. James R.

On   December  21,  2021,   the   Director  of   National  Intelligence   signed   the
memorandum, Security Executive  Agent Clarifying  Guidance  Concerning  Marijuana  for
Agencies  Conducting   Adjudications  of  Persons  Proposed   for  Eligibility  for  Access  to
Classified  Information  or Eligibility to  Hold a  Sensitive  Position.  It  emphasizes  that  federal
law  remains   unchanged   with   respect   to   the   illegal  use,  possession,  production,  and
distribution  of marijuana. Individuals who  hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited   by  law  from   using   controlled   substances.  Disregard  of  federal  law
pertaining to  marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana  use) remains relevant,  but
not determinative,  to  adjudications of eligibility.  Agencies  are  required  to use  the  “whole-
person   concept”  stated   under  SEAD  4,  to   determine   whether  the   applicant’s  behavior
raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
In this case, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 25(a) and (c) apply. Applicant is under
the misapprehension that state law governs the legality of marijuana purchase and use.
That is incorrect. Marijuana purchase and use continue to raise national security concerns
under federal law that must be mitigated. His conflicting statements in his PSI sow doubts
about his intention to use marijuana in the future.
Only mitigating condition AG ¶ 26(a) potentially applies here. That condition states:
“[T]he  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  happened  under  such
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual’s current
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” It is true that Applicant’s use of marijuana
began quite some time ago, in March 2011 while he was in college. His use, however,
continued with varying frequency until June 2021,  just a month after he completed  his
SCA. A two-year period of abstinence, especially in light of his equivocal future intent, is
insufficient to allay national security concerns. On these facts, mitigating condition AG ¶
26(a) does not apply.
In reaching this conclusion, I have also carefully considered the other mitigating
conditions set forth in AG ¶¶ 26(b) through (d). On their face, those mitigating conditions
do not apply in this case. I find against Applicant on SOR ¶ 1.
The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and
ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. AG
¶¶ 2(d)(1) through (9) and 2(f)(1) through (6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has
not met his ultimate burden of  persuasion  to  show that  it  is clearly  consistent  with  the
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required  by section  E3.1.25  of Enclosure  3  of the  Directive,  I make  the  following
formal findings on the  SOR allegations:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:
Against  Applicant
Subparagraph  1.a:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In  light of the record as  a whole, it is not clearly  consistent with the  interests of
national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is denied.

"Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  senior  control  systems  engineer,  who  has  been
employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  June  2006.  He  has  held  a  Secret  security
clearance since November 2016 and seeks to retain it as a requirement of his continued
employment. (GE 1; Tr. 10-12)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1993.  He  was  awarded  a  Bachelor  of
Science  degree  in  electrical  engineering  in  June  2007,  a  master’s  degree  in  electrical
engineering  in  May  2009,  and  a  Ph.D.  in  electrical  engineering  June  2013.  (GE  1;  Tr.
12-15)  He  married  in  February  2002,  and  has  a  20-year-old  daughter,  an  18-year-old
daughter,  and  a  15-year-old  son.  Applicant’s  wife  is  employed  in  the  marketing  and
graphic design department at a major university. (GE 1; Tr. 15-16)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  self-reported  marijuana  use  on  his  November  3,  2021  SF-86.  (GE  1)
He  was  subsequently  interviewed  on  January  4,  2022,  by  an  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) investigator regarding his marijuana use. (GE 3) He elaborated on
his  marijuana  use  in  his  September  6,  2022  SOR  Answer  as  well  as  during  his
testimony. The following summarizes that marijuana use.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
about  January  1995  to  about  September  2021.  He  admitted  this  allegation  with
explanations. (SOR Answer) He smoked marijuana occasionally in his early 20s, but in
2002 he started a family and pursued a Ph.D. in electrical engineering that took him 13
years  to  complete.  Applicant  did  not  use  marijuana  again  until  mid-2017  when  it  was
legalized in his state of residence. (SOR Answer)
During  his  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  he  first  used  marijuana  “shortly  after
high school” and did not use it in a consistent pattern. While Applicant was attending a
community  college  before  transferring  to  a  university  where  he  was  awarded  his
bachelor’s  degree,  he  estimated  he  used  marijuana  “a  small  handful  of  times  .  .  .  not
very often.” (Tr. 21-23) When he transferred to a university setting, he “was just hanging
out  with  a  bunch  of  Engineers.”  Applicant  was  married  the  entire  time  he  was  in  a
university setting pursuing his Ph.D. Neither he nor his wife used marijuana during this
timeframe. Marijuana became readily available in Applicant’s state of residence after it
was legalized in 2016, and his wife’s girlfriends “started smoking it or they would have
like gummy edibles or whatever. It just sort of started surfacing through different social
networks.” It was “sometime, middle to the end of 2017,” that his wife came home with a
vape pen, “like an e-cigarette.” (Tr. 23-24, 31)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
about  2016  to  September  2021  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.  He
admitted  this  allegation  with  explanations.  (SOR  Answer)  He  added,  “to  date  I  have
never been in possession of or had access to classified information.” (SOR Answer)
When Applicant’s wife came home with an electronic cigarette in 2017, she told
him that it was a hemp-derived version called Delta-8 THC and was legal in all states.
Applicant researched whether his wife’s claim, as well as the same claim of a friend he
played  hockey  with,  was  accurate  and  found  the  laws  to  be  conflicting.  He  used  the
ambiguity  of  the  laws to  justify  his  infrequent  use  of  these  products  and  began  to  use
them  sporadically  because,  as  a  writer,  its  use  would  help  him  to  write.  He  reiterated
and  acknowledged  that  was  a  “big  mistake”  and  stated  he  would  not  make  that  same
mistake again.  He only used these products with his wife or by himself. Applicant fully
admitted that he got it wrong. (Tr. 19-20, 24-25, 32, 39)
Applicant told the investigator during his January 4, 2022 OPM interview that he
planned to continue “to use this stuff” because he had convinced himself “that it wasn’t
a  big  deal.”  Applicant  acknowledged  this  response  was  “very  wrong”  and  is  “very
remorseful”  for  making  that  statement.  He  “mis-understood  the  severity  of  the  choice
and how the  Federal Government  would  see  this.”  He  credibly  expressed  that  he  was
sorry  and  stated that  “it  won’t  happen  again.”  (Tr.  20)  Applicant  said  that he  last used
Delta-8  THC  shortly  after  his  OPM  interview,  stating  that  he  was  “thick-headed”  not
realizing  the  “magnitude  of  this.”  Shortly  after  his  OPM  interview,  and  “maybe  eight
months”  ago,  Applicant  stopped  using  marijuana  completely.  In  his  post-hearing
statement, he clarified that he had not used any marijuana products over the past year.
He added that it was not hard for him to stop using marijuana nor does he miss using it.
(Tr. 25-27, 30; AE C)
Applicant  underwent  a  pre-employment  drug  test  when  he  was  initially  hired  as
an intern. He stated that his employer provides training but does not recall any specific
training  on  his  company’s  drug  policy.  He  realizes  Federal  law  “trumps”  state  law.  He
has  not  undergone  any  random  drug  screenings  since  he  began  his  employment  in
2006.  (Tr.  27-28)  When  Applicant  completed  his  November  3,  2021  SF-86,  he  stated
that he wrote songs and occasionally used marijuana to generate new ideas. He added
that if marijuana use became an impediment to obtaining his clearance, he would refrain
from  further  use  as  he  was  not  “very attached  to  it.”  He  testified  that  he  provided  that
response  because  he  was  mistaken  regarding  the  state  of  the  law  and  acknowledged
that he “could have made a better choice . . . and stopped right then.” (Tr. 20-21; GE 2)
Applicant stated that his wife no longer uses marijuana. She is very aware of the
problems  that  continued  marijuana  use  will  cause  for  his  career  and  their  collective
livelihood. She understands the requirement for Applicant to refrain from any drug use
and  is  very  supportive  of  his  total abstinence.  Apart from  a  fellow hockey  team  player
who  sometimes  uses  a  vape  pen,  Applicant  does  not  find  himself  in  any  situations
where marijuana is used. He is not tempted to use marijuana on the rare occasion his
hockey teammate uses marijuana.  (Tr. 30-31)
Applicant  “wholeheartedly”  understands  the  Government’s  zero  tolerance  policy
with regard to drug  use, even if a drug  is legal in one’s state of residence  under state
law  but  not  Federal  law.  (Tr.  32-33,  39-40)  Applicant  submitted  a  signed  statement  of
intent, dated January 29, 2023, to abstain from all hemp derived products regardless of
their legal status at state and Federal levels. He added that he has not consumed any of
these products  for the past  year and  is fully committed  to  maintaining  abstinence.  (Tr.
33-34;  AE  C)  Similarly,  Applicant’s  wife  submitted  a  signed  statement,  dated  January
29, 2023, expressing her committed support of her husband’s decision to abstain from
all hemp products. She  added  that she  discontinued  her use of all such products. (Tr.
33-34; AE B)
Post-hearing,  Applicant  submitted  an  email  referencing  research  he  conducted
on  the  legality  of  consuming  hemp  derived  Delta-8  THC.  He  stated  that  based  on  his
research  it was his belief  that Delta-8  THC  is  legal Federally  as well  as  in his state of
residence.  With  that  in  mind,  he  asserted  that  he  did  not  violate  his  employer’s  zero
drug tolerance policy as his employer’s policy only pertains to the consumption of illegal
drugs. Regardless, Applicant stated that he would abstain either way. (AE L)  Applicant
submitted a  second email  with  citations  and further discussion  supporting  his position.
(AE M) [Note – DOD policy does not permit the use Delta 8 THC. See discussion under
Analysis section infra.]
In response and in summary, Department Counsel stated that Applicant made no
reference to using Delta-8 THC when he completed his November 3, 2021 SF-86 nor in
his  January  4,  2022  OPM  interview.  She  noted  that  Applicant  specifically  referred  to
“marijuana”  and  “THC”  adding  that  he  expressed  an  intent  to  continue  using  it,  even
when  he  was  not  certain  whether  it  was  permissible  to  do  so  while  holding  a  security
clearance. She concluded that even if Applicant were to establish that he currently has
a  reasonable  basis  to  believe  that  the  product  he  was  using  was  legal  and  Farm  Bill-
compliant,  his  use  occurred  while  he  had  doubts  about  its  legality  and  reflected
adversely on his judgment. (GE 4; GE 5)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his April 22, 2016 SF-86 by deliberately
failing  to  disclose  his  past  marijuana  use  as  set  forth  in  SOR  ¶  1  when  he  answered
“no” to the question whether  he had illegally used any controlled substance  in the last
seven  years.  Applicant  denied  this  allegation  with  explanations.  (SOR  Answer)  He
stated when he completed his April 22, 2016 SF-86, he answered “no” because he had
not smoked marijuana for “approximately 14 years.” (SOR Answer) During his hearing,
Applicant reiterated that he did not use marijuana again until 2017 after it was legalized
in his state of residence. (Tr. 28-29)
Character Evidence
During his hearing, Applicant made a statement expressing his patriotism, love of
country,  and  motivation  for  going  forward.  His  family  on  both  sides  has  been  in  the
United  States  “since  before  the  Mayflower.”  He  has  built  his  entire  career  being  of
service  to  the  United  States.  He  is  very  proud  of  being  able  to  solve  problems  “that
nobody else could” on a Navy platform. He continues to work on programs that impact
the client’s wellbeing and would like to make more contributions, if allowed. He viewed
the outcome of this decision not only as being important to him and is family, but to the
country as well. (Tr. 20)
Applicant submitted a reference letter from his functional manager (FM), who has
known  Applicant  for  the  past  five  years,  first  as  his  technical  lead  and  later  as  his
functional  manager.  [FM  described  Applicant’s  projects,  past  and  present.  Identifying
these  projects  would  in  all  likelihood  provide  information  leading  to  the  identify  of
projects  and  parties  concerned.  Suffice  it  to  say,  the  projects  involved  are  of  critical
importance  and  vital  to  the  national  defense.]  Applicant  has  a  proven  track  record  of
working on highly sophisticated platforms and is the  “only member of [FM’s] team  that
has both capability and drive to address these efforts in the short time-frames that are
available on these  programs.”  Applicant  is assigned  to multiple  programs  as a  subject
matter expert. In this role besides learning the needed control technology and applying
his  technical  skills,  Applicant  serves  as  a  sounding  board  and  mentor  to  junior
engineers. (AE A)
Applicant’s  work  performance  evaluations  from  2017  to  2023  reflect  sustained
superior performance and provided specific examples of his contribution to the national
defense. (AE - I) For example, his 2023 evaluation states, “[Applicant] continued to be
sought by [client] for his control design expertise. [Applicant] is deeply respected for his
creativity,  intellect,  passion,  maturity,  and  good  nature  and  should  continue  to  be  a
tremendous  asset  for  [employer]  in  the  years  to  come.”
“[Applicant’s]  work  was
acknowledged  by  the  senior  leadership.  He  has  been  asked  to  obtain  a  clearance  so
that he can employ his work on several programs.” (Tr. 35; AE I)
In  addition  to  his  contribution  to  the  national  defense,  Applicant  likewise
contributes to his local community. He developed a passion for teaching while he was a
graduate  student  working  on  his  Ph.D.  He  participates  in  a  company-sponsored
program to encourage young people to pursue careers in science and engineering. He
developed  a  curriculum  and  leads  classroom  laboratory  sessions  for  elementary
students  in  electricity,  magnetism,  and  the  fundamentals  of  circuit  design.  Applicant
participates  in  career  days  where  he  gives  presentations  on  exciting  engineering
projects  to  middle  schoolers.  He  provided  a photograph  of  him  in  the  ‘teaching mode”
and  copies  of  numerous  thank  you  notes  from  students  who  benefited  from  his
teaching. (Tr. 38; AE J – K)
",True
"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  with  explanations.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 32  years old.  He earned two bachelor’s degrees and  earned credits
towards a master’s degree. He was married to his first wife from December 2016 until she
passed  away  in  2019.  He  remarried  in  March  2023.  He  has  worked  for  his  current
employer, a federal contractor, since 2015. (Tr. 20; GE 1)
During Applicant’s first marriage, his wife suffered from mental illness. She had a
child from a previous relationship, and Applicant treated his stepdaughter like his own.
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  aware  his  wife  had  experienced  significant  and  intense
trauma in her past. She was abused by a previous boyfriend and had childhood trauma.
She was participating in talk therapy, cognitive therapy, and was on medication. He and
his first wife were together for about two and a half years before they married. He raised
his stepdaughter almost by himself from the age of three until she was seven years. His
wife was a flight attendant and would be gone for extended periods of time, and Applicant
would care for the child. He and his stepdaughter had a close relationship. In early 2017,
he  and  his  wife  attended  marriage  counseling  to  address  communication  issues.  The
counselor recommended he seek individual counseling. (Tr. 21-27, 79)
Applicant sought mental health treatment from a health center (HC) in April 2017.
He reported to the mental health professional (MHP) that he was having difficulty focusing
and  concentrating.  He  was  diagnosed  with  attention  deficient/hyperactivity  disorder
(ADHD). He was prescribed medication. He stated that he also participated in treatment
brought on by his relationship with his wife who was undergoing treatment for depression
and  extreme  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD).  He  said  she  had  an  ongoing
diagnosis  of  alcoholism  and  borderline  personality  disorder.  He  explained  that  as  her
partner and a person who loved her, these conditions led to stress and trauma in dealing
with  her  behavior.  While  attending  therapy,  he  was  also  evaluated  for  various  mental
health issues to ensure a bipolar condition was ruled out, which it was. Applicant testified
that he now manages his ADHD through diet, sleep, and exercise  and is no longer on
medication. (Tr. 22, 25-27, 42, 51-54; Answer to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant testified that his wife was  prescribed  medication for her mental health
issues and was experiencing side effects, such as hallucinations and delusions. She was
also abusing alcohol. She had participated in alcohol detoxification a couple of times. Her
medications  were  changed,  but her symptoms  and  side  effects  worsened.  He  testified
that he was arrested in August 2017 on charges of domestic violence. He testified that
his  wife  was  not  taking  her  prescribed  medication,  and  he  thought  she  was  having
flashbacks. He said that his wife attacked him, and he defended himself by wrapping his
arms around her. He had injuries to his face. He was arrested for domestic violence but
the charges were later dropped. (Tr. 29-30, 45-47, 55-59)
Applicant testified that in August 2017, his wife left him, and she left her daughter
in his care. He was the sole provider for his stepdaughter until November 2017 when the
police arrived at his home on Thanksgiving Day and escorted his stepdaughter from the
premises. He understood that he had no legal rights to her, and he only ever saw her a
few more times. Applicant was distraught and grieving at the loss of his stepdaughter. In
November  2017,  he  reported  to  his  MHP  that  he  was  experiencing  anxiety  due  to  his
separation  from  his  wife  and  loss  of  contact  with  his  stepdaughter.  He  continued  his
regular appointments. (Tr. 22-25, 30, 62; Answer to the SOR)
In  late  December 2017, he  learned  that his wife  had  aborted  their  child. They had
tried  to  conceive  for two  years but struggled  due  to  his wife’s physical health  issues  and
were  unsuccessful. The  combination  of losing  access to  his  stepdaughter and  learning  of
the  abortion  made  him  more depressed  and  mired  in grief.  In  January 2018, he  sought
treatment and  was admitted  to  a  mental health  facility for suicidal  ideations. He  continued
his therapy  to  approximately April 2018  for  grief because  of the  loss of  his  stepdaughter
and  familial stress.  (Tr. 28-30, 66; Answer to the SOR)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  January  2018  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions  (SF 86)  that  in  January 2018  he purchased  and used marijuana  three  times
during one weekend while living in a state where it is legal. He had a security clearance
at the time but did not have access to classified information. He testified that because of
all of the family issues he was experiencing, with the loss of custody of his stepdaughter,
and the separation from his wife, he thought he would try marijuana to relieve the stress.
He believed because it was legal under state law, he was permitted to use it. He credibly
testified that he was unaware that he was not permitted to use marijuana under federal
law, but also acknowledged he should have known better. He has not used marijuana
since that weekend and does not intend to use it in the future. He provided a signed letter
of  intent  to never use or possess  illegal drugs  or misuse  legal drugs  in  the future  and
agreed that his security clearance could be revoked if he violated his promise. (Tr. 43-45,
64-66, 113-118; Answer to the SOR; AE B)
Applicant provided the results of drug tests administered on June 3, 2022, March
25,  2023,  and  April  5,  2023,  which  showed  he  tested  negative  for  illegal  drugs.  He
provided a letter from his mother who said she had visited her son in June 2018, and he
disclosed to her that he had used marijuana to help cope with the separation from his wife
and stepdaughter. She had concerns about the policy of his employer because marijuana
was legal in the state where he lived. She said her son told her that he believed it was
permissible to use. (Tr. 47; AE D, H, I, P)
In  July  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  domestic  violence  against  his  wife.
Applicant denied he committed any act of violence. He believed it was a plot devised by
his  wife  so  he  would  be  in  jail  and  she  could  obtain  items  from  the  marital  home.  He
indicated the incident was entirely fabricated and he had an alibi to her accusations in
that he was not where she claimed he was located. He believed the allegation was made
to obtain legal leverage for their pending divorce or were attributed to his wife’s mental
health  issues  because  he  believed  she  was  not  taking  her  medications  and  was
consuming  alcohol.  He  attributed  her  obtaining  restraining  orders  against  him  in
September 2018 and May 2019 to the same purposes as noted above. The charges and
orders were all dismissed when Applicant’s wife failed to appear in court. (Tr. 29-30, 41,
45-47, 77; Answer to the SOR)
During  marriage  counseling,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  depressed  and
mentioned  he  had  suicidal  ideations.  In  December  2018,  Applicant  was  at  home  and
asleep. His wife tried to contact him by telephone and when he did not answer, she called
the police. He explained to the police that he was seeking treatment for grief and was
dealing with depression, but it was being handled through his private MHP. For reasons
unbeknownst to him they admitted him under the Baker Act to a mental health facility.
Applicant believes this was an attempt by his wife to ruin his reputation and gain leverage
in  their  divorce  proceeding.  Applicant  admitted  he  had  suicidal  ideations  but  did  not
attempt suicide. (Tr. 31,37-41, 66, 82-87)
Applicant’s discharge summary from his December 2018 hospitalization notes that
he was communicating with his ex-wife and was venting and instead of her calming him,
she began screaming at him. He attempted to tell her that because of the way she treated
him and interacted with him, he had become suicidal in the past. That was the end of the
conversation,  until  the  police  arrived  at  his  door.  He  denied  he  had  attempted  to
deliberately harm himself. He had positives in this life and was gainfully employed. He
was receiving support from his mother and brother and had strong religious beliefs. He
was looking forward to a trip to India. He was discharged in January 2019 with a diagnosis
by a medical doctor of depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified, major depressive
disorder, single episode, unspecified, and unspecified depressive disorder. He testified
that he was told to continue seeing his therapist. (Tr. 30, 40-41; GE 3)
Applicant was moving from one state to another and during the period of late 2018
to 2019, and he was traveling back and forth between the states. Also at some point, his
wife  had  move  to  the  new  state.  He  testified  that  he  followed  up  with  a  health  care
professional in the new state. Applicant provided a letter from Dr. MS, a licensed married
and   family therapist  (LMF)   and   licensed  mental health   counselor, who  practiced   in   the
new state. She  provided  a  letter from  October 2020  that stated  she  had  treated  Applicant
since   November 2018   and   diagnosed  him   with   adjustment   disorder with   anxiety   as he
was  transitioning   through   divorce.   She   last   saw  him   in   December  2019   when   they
mutually decided  to  terminate  services.  He testified  that they agreed  he  had  continued
therapy  to  the  point  where it  was no  longer necessary, and  at that  point he  had  a  game
plan  to  address any issues that may occur or bouts of grief he  may  experience. (Tr. 34-
35, 66-75, 80-82, 87; AE C)
Applicant  testified  that  his  wife  attempted  suicide  five  times  while  they  were
married. In September 2019, she succeeded. She left a suicide note, hung herself, and
was  found  weeks  later  at  her  house.  It  was  determined  that  her  cause  of  death  was
suicide. (Tr. 45)
On  January  17,  2022,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  government-approved
psychologist, Dr. B. Based on her clinical interview, available medical and mental health
treatment  records,  testing  observations,  and  results  of  the  Personality  Assessment
Inventory (PAI), she determined Applicant met the criteria for major depressive disorder,
recurrent, severe in remission, bipolar disorder R/O1 and Cluster B personality traits.2 She
noted Applicant had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and domestic violence issues.
He  also  had  episodes  of  increased  energy  and  activity  as  well  as  episodes  of  major
depression.  He  was  not  in  treatment  for  these  conditions  because  she  noted  that
Applicant felt he did not need mental health treatment. His prognosis was poor because
he  was  not  interested  in  treatment,  which  Dr.  B  noted  would  need  to  be  regular  and
ongoing  to  prevent  relapses  of  depression  and  possibly  mania.  She  said  due  to
inconsistencies  she  noted  in  information  he  provided  to  her  and  to  the  government
investigator regarding his security clearance application it suggested he was dishonest.
She  noted  his  use  of  marijuana  while  he  had  a  security  clearance,  which  he
acknowledged, also gave her concerns, although she did not discuss this as impacting
judgment,
his  psychological
trustworthiness, and reliability. (GE 4)
issues.  She  had  significant  concerns  about  his
Applicant testified that he disagreed with many things Dr. B stated in her report
noting they were inaccurate. He noted that his virtual evaluation was between one and
two hours. Her conclusions that he perpetrated acts of domestic violence were not true.
He noted she opined that he had unpredictable and violent behavior, which was untrue
and  based  on  false  reports  from  his  ex-wife.  He  said  Dr.  B  saw  this  as  inconsistent
reporting and dishonest. He adamantly disagreed with her interpretation and willingness
to accept these accusations without considering his information. Dr B. concluded that he
had  episodes  of  increased  energy  and  activity,  such  as  formulating  a  plan  to  travel  to

consideration. For example, a normal chest x-ray may “rule out” pneumonia.

erratic  cluster,  include  Borderline  Personality  Disorder,  Narcissistic  Personality  Disorder,  Histrionic
Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder.
India, which were a concern. Applicant had planned a trip to India for a wedding that was
subsequently canceled because the wedding was canceled. He took a trip to Aruba after
he  had  completed  his  two  bachelor’s  degrees  because  he  was  exhausted  and  not
because he was using sleep as a coping mechanism for a manic episode. He denied he
exhibited  unpredictable  and  erratic  behavior.  He  denied  he  lied  and  had  recurring
problems with the law, was aggressive, violent, and impulsive. He also disagreed with her
evaluation that he was dishonest. Dr. B noted that he was in a tumultuous relationship
with his wife and had suicidal ideations during this time, which prompted a diagnosis of
major depressive disorder, and she had concerns that he was not currently in treatment.
When  he  was  evaluated  by  Dr.  B,  he  was  no  longer  married  as  his  wife  had  been
deceased since 2019. She noted that he reported on his security clearance application
(January 2020) that he was going through some hard times but was in therapy and doing
better. She said if he did have some insight for treatment, he did not have it at the time of
the evaluation and therefore his prognosis was poor. (Tr. 32-33, 102-112; GE 4)
Applicant was re-evaluated in June  2022 by a licensed psychologist (LC). The LC
noted   that  she   had   experience   treating   various  disorders,  particularly  depressive
disorders. They discussed  his past suicidal  ideations, Baker Act hospitalization, the  loss
of  his  stepdaughter  and   ex-wife.  They  also   discussed   his  history  of  grief  and   his  past
counseling  with  Dr.  MS. LC  noted  that Applicant  reported  that  he  was previously given
the  Personality Assessment Inventory and  the  screening  yielded  Bipolar  Disorder. (This
is  incorrect  according   to   Dr.  B   Bipolar  Disorder  had   to   be   ruled   out.)  LC   administered
assessments   for  anxiety  and   depression.  His   scores  were   nonsignificant  in   the   “none-
minimal”   range.  She   also  reviewed   the   DSM-5   criteria   for  Bipolar  I,   II,  and   Major
Depressive  Disorder.  Of   the   three   disorders,  Applicant  only  “endorsed   1   symptom   of
Major  Depressive  Disorder  (diminished   ability  to   concentrate/think)  and   the   diagnosis
requires  5   or  more  symptoms  to   be   endorsed.”  (AE   A)  In   LC’s  professional  opinion,
Applicant does not currently meet the  criteria  for Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar I
or Bipolar II Disorders. (Tr. 34, 89-102; AE A)
Applicant testified that he loved his first wife, despite their tumultuous relationship,
which he attributed to her PTSD and trauma she experienced, along with her abuse of
alcohol.  The  loss  of  custody  of  his  stepdaughter  had  a  devastating  impact  on  him
emotionally  and  mentally.  When  he  learned  his  wife  committed  suicide,  she  had  been
deceased  for  several  weeks  before  her  body  was  found.  Although  their  marriage  had
failed, she had been his best friend and he loved her. He could not understand why she
would not take her medication. (Tr. 29)
Applicant remarried in 2023. He provided a letter from his new wife who is aware
of the allegations in the SOR. She has known Applicant for four years. She has noticed
positive  changes  in  how  he  copes  with  his  grief  and  loss.  She  noticed  a  substantial
change in the first year of knowing him and continued consistency in the three subsequent
years. She supports him in his goals. She described him as patient and understanding.
(AE J, O)
Applicant testified that he has a good support system with his wife and family. He
is looking forward to his future and starting a family. He has developed coping skills and
participating in therapy has helped him. The loss of his wife and stepdaughter will always
be with him, but its impact has diminished, and he has learned the proper way to deal
with his loss. (Tr. 112)
Applicant provided performance evaluations from 2016 to 2021. He consistently
took on additional responsibilities and successfully added value to various projects. His
evaluations ranked him as “exceeded” and “significantly exceeded” goals. (AE F)
Applicant provided character letters describing him as a mentor, a leader, reliable,
focused, respected, and dependable. He has a strong work ethic and is a vital member
of the team. (Tr. 47-49; AE G, J)

"In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  under
Guidelines H and E. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a -1.f, and 2.a.) His admissions are accepted as findings
of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 31 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in August 2012 and was
honorably discharged in August 2016. From August 2016 to 2020, he was a member of
the Navy Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). He worked part time at a car dealership while
taking college courses. He earned an associate degree in 2018 and a bachelor’s degree
in May 2020. Since August 2020, he has been employed by a government contractor. His
job  title  is  senior  classified  systems  administrator.  He  is not  married,  and  he  does  not
have any children. (Tr. 20-22, 27, 42; GE 1)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used marijuana with  varying  frequency  from about
2009 to about May 2020. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that he purchased marijuana during 2009
until about May 2020. SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e allege that he used and purchased marijuana
from  September  2016  to  May  2020,  while  granted  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information.  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.f.  allege  that  he  used  and  purchased  marijuana  from
September 2016 to about May 2020, while employed in a sensitive position with the IRR.
Applicant  detailed  and  categorized  his  marijuana  involvement  into  four  distinct
periods of his life. (1) from 2009 to 2012, he used marijuana recreationally in high school
until his junior year of college; (2) from 2012 to 2016, while serving in the U.S. Navy, he
did  not  use  marijuana  at  all;  (3)  after  his  August  2016  discharge  from  the  Navy,  he
occasionally used marijuana recreationally with friends until May 2020; and (4) from May
2020 to the date of the hearing, he had not used any illegal substance. (Tr. 22-42)
Applicant explained why he resumed his use of marijuana after his 2016 discharge
from the U.S. Navy. He was adjusting to life as a civilian, he was back with his hometown
friends, and marijuana was legal under state law where he lived. He was employed part-
time by a car dealership, he attended college classes, and he was a member of the IRR.
His  involvement  in  the  IRR  was  an  unpaid  position,  he  did  not  report  to  any  military
commander or installation or drill, he did not wear his uniform, and he was unaware during
that time that he had been granted security clearance eligibility in the event he received
orders to mobilize. He has not used marijuana since he graduated from college in May
2020.  He  stated  that  he  has  matured  and  has  no  intention  of  using  marijuana  again.
Applicant provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and
substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for
revocation  of  national  security  eligibility.  See  AG  ¶  26(b)(3),  infra.  He  created  strict
boundaries with his girlfriend, friends, and family members, letting them know that he will
not tolerate anyone using illegal drugs in his presence. He has also agreed to allow his
employer to conduct multiple drug tests to confirm his compliance. (Tr. 22-42; AE G)
In  May  2023,  Applicant  participated  in  a  substance  abuse  evaluation  with  a
substance  abuse  and  mental  health  professional.  He  denied  any  previous  substance
abuse treatment, positive drug tests, or drug-related criminal charges. He was diagnosed
with depression in 2018. He takes prescribed medication  daily and denied any current
depression or anxiety. Applicant took several administered tests used in the industry to
assess whether he had a substance abuse disorder. The results showed that Applicant
did not meet the criteria set forth by the American Psychiatric Association for an active
cannabis  abuse  disorder.  His  final  diagnosis  was  cannabis  use  disorder  –  mild  –  in
sustained remission. He was not referred for further treatment or counseling. (AE F; Tr.
44-45)
Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶ 2.a alleges  Applicant  falsified his marijuana use on  the April 2012 SCA,
when he denied that he had used any illegal or controlled substance within the last seven
years. Applicant stated that his recruiter convinced him to omit his marijuana usage when
he  completed  the  SCA  at  the  age  of  20.  The  recruiter  gave  him  the  impression  that
Applicant would not be able to enlist into the U.S. Navy if he disclosed his prior use of
marijuana, so he followed his recruiter’s advice. When Applicant completed his SCA in
September 2020, he was more mature and understood the importance of truthfulness.
He fully disclosed his past use of marijuana on his 2020 SCA and throughout his 2020
security investigation. (GE 1, GE 2; SOR response; Tr. 45-48, 50-53)
Character Evidence
Three coworkers, including Applicant’s manager, chief information officer and an
associate  director,  and  a  longtime  friend,  praised  his  good  character,  integrity,  and
outstanding contributions to the DOD. The general sense of their statements is that he is
exceptionally  intelligent,  candid,  dedicated,  responsible,  and  a  professional  employee.
Applicant has been promoted twice since he started his employment in August 2020, and
he has also received several performance bonuses. (Tr. 55-56; AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D,
AE E)
",True
"In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a -1.d with explanations. During the
hearing, he admitted SOR ¶ 2.a, as noted above. His admissions are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  41  years old.  He  has  never  married  and  has  one  child.  He  did  not
attend  college,  instead  earning  a  trade  certification  in  2004.  He  submitted  his  SCA
through  a  previous  employer.  In  September  2022,  he  began  working  for  his  current
employer  as  an  electrical  technician.  He  has  not  previously  held  a  security  clearance.
(GX 1-2; Tr. 17, 20)
Marijuana Use
Applicant began using marijuana in about 1999 when he was eighteen years old
in  high  school.  He  would  smoke  three  to  seven  times  per  month,  mostly  with  friends.
Initially, others gave the marijuana to him. However, he later purchased marijuana from
drug dealers at local gas stations. (GX 1-2; Tr. 28-29)
In  2003,  Applicant  joined  a  job  program  through  another  federal  agency.  The
program  required  drug  screenings  for  participants.  He  tested  positive  for  marijuana
during  his  initial  screening  but  was  allowed  to  remain  in  the  program  and  had  no
additional positive drug tests.  (This is not alleged in the SOR). In 2004, he left  the job
program and resumed using marijuana. (GX 2; Tr. 33-36)
Over time, Applicant’s marijuana use increased to almost daily. His use continued
until 2012, when he refused to provide a second urine sample, as requested, during an
employer-directed  drug  test.  His  refusal  was  considered  a  failed  drug  test  by  his
employer  and  he  was  released  from  his  assigned  contract.  (See  further  discussion,
below). With the loss of income, he could no longer afford marijuana and stopped using
it for about a year.  However, once he got another job, he resumed smoking marijuana
about twice a week. (GX 1-2; Tr. 62-65)
Applicant would often smoke on his own, with his son’s mother or with friends. In
about  2018,  he  stopped  seeing  his  son’s  mother and  obtained  full  custody  of  his  son.
Although he stopped seeing the friends with whom he used marijuana, he continued to
regularly  purchase  and  use  marijuana  through  about  April  2021.  He  stopped  using
marijuana in order to pass an initial drug screening for his employer. (Tr. 30-32, 75-76)
In  his  May  2021  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  purchased  and  used
marijuana  “hundreds  of  times”  up  until  a  month  before  his  security  clearance
application. However, he also stated his intent to terminate future marijuana use. (GX 1)
At his hearing, Applicant testified that he was committed to not using marijuana in
the future. He described his personal growth, health and life changes as well as trying to
be a good father as reasons why he no longer intended to use marijuana. (Tr. 69-70, 77)
Misuse of Prescription Medications
In  about  2003,  while  working  with  the  job  program,  Applicant  experienced  a
painful medical condition and was given a prescription for Percocet. Later, he received
Vicodin  at  the  hospital  for  a  toothache.  In  both  instances,  he  liked  the  way  these
narcotics made him feel and described becoming addicted to them. (Tr. 46-49)
After  his  prescriptions  ran  out,  Applicant  continued  using  Percocet  or  Vicodin
weekly.  He would illegally  use  these  narcotics  with  his son’s  mother.  She  would  either
get them from the doctor’s office where she worked, or she would purchase them from a
friend. Applicant would give her money to purchase the narcotics. (GX 1; Tr. 51-53)
Applicant  testified  that  he  stopped  using  Percocet  in  2018,  primarily  because  it
resulted in stomach issues. However, he continued taking Vicodin without a prescription
through  late  2020  or  early  2021.  He  did  not  seek  out  any  treatment  or  counseling  to
assist in terminating his use. However, he testified that he has no further intent to take
narcotics  without  a  prescription  because  he  was  getting  older  and  was  trying  to  set  a
good example for his son. (Tr. 44, 57, 73-77)
Attempted Submission of a False Urine Sample for Drug Test
In  about  June  2012,  following  a  work  injury,  Applicant  was  directed  by  his
employer  to  take  a  urinalysis  drug  test,  as  referenced  above.  Knowing  that  he  would
test  positive  for  marijuana, Applicant  called  several  friends  in  an  effort  to  obtain  clean
urine  to  submit  for the test.  He then concealed  the  friend’s  urine in his jeans when  he
entered the testing facility. However, when he submitted the sample, the lab technician
suspected  something  was  wrong  and  asked  him  to  submit  a  second  sample.  He
refused,  pretended  to  be  sick  and  left  the  facility.  His  refusal  was  considered  a  failed
drug test by his employer and he was released from his assigned contract. (Tr. 59-68)
Although Applicant disclosed details of this event in his Answer to the SOR and
at hearing, he provided conflicting accounts during previous aspects of his investigation.
In  both  his  SCA  and  background  interview,  he  stated  he  did  not  know  why  he  was
requested to submit a second urine sample. Yet, he knew the first sample was not his
urine.  He  later  claimed  that  he  did  not  share  details  of  his  efforts  to  subvert  the  2012
drug test during the investigation because he forgot. (GX 1-2; Answer)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  his  attempt  to  submit  a  false  urine  sample  was  a
“horrible  idea”  that  he  would  not  repeat.  However,  he  did  resume  using  marijuana
afterwards. (Tr. 78)
",False
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 2.b,
and 2.c. (Item 4) He also provided clarifying and mitigating information. (Id.) Applicant’s
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a 45-year-old senior analyst who is seeking employment with a DOD
contractor. (Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 3) In 2014, he was awarded an associate degree, and
in 2017, he was awarded a bachelor’s degree. (Id. at 9) He has been married since 2003,
and his three children are ages 6, 17, and 23. (Item 5; Item 6 at 3, 5) He did not disclose
any arrests, abuse of alcohol, possession or use of illegal drugs, or security violations.
(Item 5)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  and Personal Conduct
The SOR states as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a alleges Applicant used marijuana on various occasions between 1996
and November 2020. (Item 3) In  his SOR response  he  said, “I admit I used  THC but it
was not between 1996-2020. I tried it in 1996 in college and never did it again until 2020.”
(Item 4) Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana.
SOR  ¶   2.a  alleges  in  about  November  2020  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his
employment with S for failing a random drug test by testing positive for marijuana and for
attempting  to  falsify the  results of a drug  test.  (Item  3) In  his SOR response  he said,  “I
admit that.” (Item 4)
SOR ¶  2.b  alleges on April 7, 2022, Applicant responded to the question on his
SCA about why he left employment that he held from August 2014 to November 2020
and stated he was laid off because of COVID. (Item 3; Item 5 at 12) He deliberately failed
to disclose the information in SOR ¶ 2.a. (Item 3) In his SOR response he said, “I admit
that  I  wasn’t  truthful.  Everything  was  moving  so  fast  I  should  have  been  more
accountable.” (Item 4)
SOR ¶  2.c alleges on April 7, 2022, Applicant responded to the question on his
SCA about illegal use of drugs and controlled substances in the previous seven years,
and  he  stated,  “No.”  (Item  3)  He  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  his  marijuana  use  in
November 2020. (Id.) In his SOR response he said, “I admit I had THC in my system, and
yes, I should have answered yes.” (Item 4)
In  Applicant’s  May  10,  2022  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  personal
subject interview (PSI), he confirmed the information he reported in the SCA, that is, he
was laid off from his employment with S due to COVID. (Item 6 at 4) He said he was not
involved with illegal drugs in the previous seven years. (Id.)
In  Applicant’s June  13,  2022  OPM  PSI,  the  investigator confronted  Applicant with
the   allegation   that   he  was terminated   from   employment   with  S  “for attempting  to   falsify
the   results  of   a   random   drug   test  by  hiding   a   bag   of  urine   within  his  clothing.  Subject
ultimately failed  the  drug  test and  tested  positive for marijuana. Subject  was terminated
11/2020  and  is not eligible  for rehire.” (Item  6  at 10)  Applicant said  he  failed  to  list this
information  on  his SCA  due  to  “oversight.” (Id.)  Applicant told the  OPM  investigator that
when   he   went  to   provide   the   urine   sample,   the   observer noticed   a   bulge   in one  of  his
pockets. (Id.) Applicant said he  “accidentally left pill bottle in his cargo pants pocket. The
pill bottle  contained  two  high  blood  pressure pills.” (Id.) Applicant  threw the  pill bottle  in
the   trash   as  instructed.  (Id.)   He   explained   the   positive  test   result  was  due   to   eating
“gummy  snacks  that  were   laced   with   THC.”  (Id.  at  11)   He  claimed   that  at  the   time   he
consumed   the   gummy   snacks   he   was  unaware  of  the   presence   of  the   THC.  (Id.)   He
promised   not  to   use   marijuana   in   the   future.  (Id.)   He  said   he   does  not  associate   with
marijuana users. (Id.)
Applicant concluded his SOR response with the following statement:
I take  full  responsibility for my  actions of  not holding  myself  accountable  and
being   upfront  with   the   truth   during   the   security  questions.   I  have   been
ashamed  of  myself because  I knew better and  chose  not to  and  for that  I
fully understand  why I was rejected.  I can promise you  and myself  that this
will  never happen  again  and  that  I have  taken  the  necessary measures to
ensure that it doesn’t. It  is very important to  me  that you  all  trust me  to  do
what I am suppose[d] to do as well as honoring my commitments.
I  let   myself  down,   and   more   importantly  I  let   my  wife   down,  and   I  let   my
company down and  I regret the  whole incident.  I am  deeply embarrassed  to
have  put myself as well  as the  agents through  something  that could have
been   avoided  by being   truthful,   but I  was   not  thinking   clearly at   the  time,
and  I have  taken  full  responsibility for my actions. I would be  honored  to  be
able to  get  my  security clearance, but I also  understand  I  do  not get  to  make
that decision based  [on] my decisions. (Item  4 at 3)
In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  described  Applicant’s  security-significant
behavior and noted the absence of persuasive mitigation. The FORM informed Applicant
that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a documentary
response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation,
as appropriate. . . . If [Applicant does] not file any objections or submit any additional
information . . . [his] case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination
based  solely” on  the  evidence  set  forth  in  this  FORM.  (FORM at 9 (emphasis added))
Applicant did not provide any response to the FORM.

"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 25 years old. As
of his May 2022 security clearance application  (SCA), he was not married, and he did
not have any children. He graduated from high school in 2016 and earned a bachelor’s
degree  in  December  2021.  He  worked  part  time  as  a  self-employed  freelance  web
developer from December 2020 to December 2021. He was unemployed and financially
supported by his parents  from December 2021  to June 2022, at which time  he moved
from state A to state B and began working as a software engineer  for his employer, a
DOD contractor. He has never held a security clearance. (Items 1-4)
Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana  with  varying
from
approximately May 2015 to March 2022. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 2.a) He first used marijuana
out  of  curiosity  during his  junior  year  of  high  school  in  state  A.  He  continued  to  use  it
socially  with  friends,  at  his  or  a  friend’s  residence,  between  five  times  daily  and  five
times weekly. He also ate edible marijuana brownies once every three to six months. He
also purchased it for his personal use. After it was legalized in state A in approximately
late  2018,  he  purchased  it  from  licensed  marijuana  dispensaries  in  state  A.  He  also
purchased it from such dispensaries when he visited state B. (Items 1-4)
frequency
In March 2022, Applicant stopped using marijuana. He wanted to focus on his job
search and reduce his feelings of anxiety and lack of motivation that he associated with
his  marijuana  use.  He  stated  in  his  SCA  that  he  saw  the  negatives  of  continued
marijuana  use  once  he  was  no  longer  in  college  or  around  the  people  with  whom  he
used marijuana, and he had also become comfortable with the idea of using marijuana
upon its legalization in state A. He realized it would have been beneficial for him to stop
using  marijuana  earlier.  In  his  FORM  Response,  he  stated  that  he  highly  values
progressing in his chosen profession, which is in contradiction with using drugs, and he
reiterated  his  intention  to  abstain  from  marijuana  use.  He  underwent  pre-employment
drug screening by his employer in May 2022, and he has never been informed that he
tested positive for drugs in a drug test. (Items 1-4; AE A)
Applicant continues to associate with two friends with whom he previously used
and  purchased  marijuana,  and  one  of  these  friends  has  been  his  roommate  since
October 2022. Both friends continue to use marijuana. Although he requested that both
friends not use marijuana in his presence, he was aware, in November 2022  when he
responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  that  his  roommate  used  and  stored  marijuana-
related  paraphernalia  somewhere  in  their  residence  and  he  had  been  around  his
roommate  two  to  four  times  monthly  while  his  roommate  was  under  the  influence  of
marijuana. Despite his request, his other friend had also used marijuana in his presence
approximately once monthly. In his FORM Response, he stated that he made it clear to
his  roommate  that  there  is  to  be  no  marijuana  use  in  their  residence,  and  if  his
roommate kept marijuana in their residence, it must be concealed from him. He stated
that  his  other  friend  follows  these  conditions  when  he  visits  Applicant.  He  stated  that
both  friends  respect  his  decision  to  focus  on  progressing  in  his  career  and  abstaining
from marijuana. His parents and sibling are aware of his marijuana involvement. (Items

diethylamide   (LSD)   and   psilocybin mushrooms,  with   varying   frequency   and   on   various
occasions,   from  approximately   December 2015   to  September 2016.   (SOR   ¶¶   1.c, 1.d,
2.a)   He   was  introduced   to   hallucinogens  in   high   school  by  friends   with   whom   he   no
longer  associates.  He used  LSD  approximately three  times  and  psilocybin mushrooms
once,  out  of   curiosity  and   social   pressure.  He  contributed   money   so   that  his   friends
could  purchase   these   hallucinogens  from   dealers.   He   found   that  the   hallucinogens
made  him  anxious,  which he  did not enjoy,  so  he  decided  to  never use  them  again.  He
stated   in  his  FORM   Response   that  he   has  removed   himself  from   the   individuals  with
whom  he  used  hallucinogens, and  that he  remained  in contact with  one  individual,  who
“is rarely in my life, with only occasional text messages.”  (Items  1-4; AE A)

"Applicant, age 31, is unmarried without children. He has resided with a cohabitant
since 2014. He earned an associate degree in February 2020 from a community college
he  began  attending  in  August  2018.  He  attended  another  college  from  August  2020
through at least April 2022, without earning a degree. He worked part-time for two different
grocers from July 2011 through at least April 2022. This is Applicant’s first application for
a security clearance. His employment status with the defense contractor sponsoring his
SCA is not indicated in the record. (Item 5)
Applicant smoked marijuana from about August 2009 (age 17) through November
2019 (age 27), which he described as his “high school and college” years. From August
2009  through  2015,  he  smoked  marijuana  three  to  five  times  a  week.  After  his  father
passed away in 2015, he reduced the frequency of his marijuana use to once every six
months because smoking marijuana caused him to be depressed and sad. He purchased
marijuana for his personal use: in high school, from a friend; and in college, from either a
neighbor or a friend. He usually smoked marijuana while with other people: in high school,
with his brother and three unnamed friends; and in college, with his roommate. (Items 5,
6)
Applicant  used  Adderall  without  a  prescription  from  September  2015  (age  23)
through November 2019 (age 27), about every three months. On each occasion that he
used Adderall, he ingested one or two pills. He maintained that he used Adderall to help
him study and focus, in preparation for his college exams. He purchased at least one of
the Adderall pills he used from either a friend or another unnamed person. (Items 5, 6)
Applicant used  lysergic  acid diethylamide  (LSD)  two  times, in November 2019  (age
27)  and  March  2021  (age  28). On  each  occasion  that  he  used  LSD, he  ingested  one-third
of a  tab, which had been  provided  to him  by a friend. He maintained that he  used LSD to
enhance  his experience  at music festivals  he attended  with  friends. He suffered  adverse
effects following his use of LSD the second time  and has not used it since. (Items 5, 6)
Applicant used cocaine one time in December 2021. The cocaine was provided to
him by an individual he met while on a camping trip with friends. He rolled up a dollar bill
and snorted one line of cocaine at two separate times during the same camping trip. The
following day, he suffered adverse effects due to his cocaine use. (Items 5, 6)
In his April 2022 SCA, Applicant asserted that he had no intent to use marijuana,
Adderall, LSD, or cocaine, in the future. With regard to why he did not intend to continue
his marijuana use, he stated, “I am extremely driven and weed doesn’t help me to be the
person I want to be.” As to why he did not intend to continue his LSD use, he stated, “I
dont [sic] intend to use it anymore because it wasn’t a positive experience and I’m past
that part in [sic] my life.” Concerning why he did not intend to continue his cocaine use,
he stated, “[m]oving on with my career and having a family in the future.” (Item 5).
During  his  June  2022  security  clearance  interview,  Applicant  explained  that  he
initially smoked marijuana to be accepted and hang out with the cool kids. He described
his college career as longer than it should have been due to a lack of motivation and self-
confidence he attributed to his marijuana use.  He regretted using cocaine  because he
knew that he should not have used it and attributed his one-time use to being absorbed
into his environment. He professed that he had transitioned out of his party phase and no
longer needed to use drugs to hang out with his friends or feel included. He averred that
he  no  longer  needed  to  use  Adderall  because  he  had  become  more  confident  in  his
academic ability. (Item 6)
During his June 2022 security clearance interview, Applicant asserted that he no
longer associated with drug users. He maintained that his friends have either graduated
or  are  not  willing  to  jeopardize  their  careers  by  using  drugs.  Of  the  three  references
Applicant listed on his SCA, two were friends with whom he had smoked marijuana. He
maintained that neither friend smoked marijuana anymore. He was not sure whether his
brother still smoked marijuana, as his brother did not live close by. (Items 5, 6)
In his November 2022 Answer, Applicant reiterated his commitment to abstinence
from marijuana, Adderall, LSD, cocaine, and any other controlled substances. He stated,
“I understand the illegal use of controlled substances greatly damages my future career
and I have already dedicated myself to changing this behavior . . .” He maintained that he
has become  “more career and  family oriented, has dedicated  himself to  living  a  “more
healthy and meaningful life.”  He has distanced himself from  those with whom he used
Adderall,  LSD,  and  cocaine,  and  changed  his  environment  by  moving  away  from  his
hometown and college town.

Adderall, that was not prescribed to him, in October 2020. SOR ¶ 1.c alleged Applicant
used  marijuana  in  January  2023,  after  having  been  granted  access  to  classified
information.  This  allegation  was  cross-alleged  under  the  personal  conduct  guideline.
(SOR ¶ 2.a) He admitted all SOR allegations. His SOR admissions are incorporated as
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
In his answers to Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his May 2021
SCA, Applicant disclosed that he illegally used marijuana with varying frequency between
July 2016 and February 2021. (Item 3) He described his illegal marijuana use as follows:
“The   nature   of   the   use   was   social  (friends  or  parties)   or  individual  (self-
medication).  The  frequency ranged  from  once  every  6  months  to  daily use
depending  on  the  time  period.  The  number of times used  is probably around
100-200.”  (Item 2 at 40)
He also stated his intent to not use marijuana in the future while it is still federally
illegal.  He wanted to progress in his career and had no desire to indulge in activities that
could hinder his opportunities. (Item 2 at 41)
During  an  August  2021  interview with a  government investigator, Applicant  was
questioned about his illegal use of marijuana.  (Item 4) He indicated he used marijuana
between  100  to  200  times,  mostly  for  recreation  and  self-medication.  He  indicated  he
stopped  using  marijuana  because  he  did  not  want  it  to  cause  problems  for  his  future
career. He would only use marijuana in the future if it became legal under federal law. He
was aware that marijuana use was illegal when he used marijuana. Applicant purchased
marijuana on several occasions from August 2018 to February 2021. In October 2020,
Applicant took Adderall without a prescription. He took the Adderall so he could focus on
a class assignment. This was the only time he took Adderall.  (Item 4)
Applicant provided his employer’s policy on the use of illegal drugs in response to
DOHA Interrogatories.  The employee handbook states: “The Company is dedicated to
providing employees with a workplace that is  free of drugs and alcohol. The Company
reserves the  right  to  test any employee  for the  use  of illegal drugs, marijuana, or alcohol
in accordance with applicable law.”  (Item  5 at 18)
In January 2023, while on vacation in a state where the use of marijuana is legal,
Applicant  and  the  friend  he  was  visiting  stopped  at  a  marijuana  dispensary.  Applicant
purchased a pack of marijuana joints for his friend as a thank you for hosting him. When
they returned to his friend’s house, a joint was being passed around and Applicant shared
the joint with his friend or friends. He claims he used due to the spontaneity of the situation
as  well  as  dealing  with  depression.  When  Applicant  returned  home,  he  booked  an
appointment with a therapist. He states he began therapy on January 22, 2023, and has
attended on a weekly basis. He did not provide documentation regarding his therapy. He
wanted to be accountable for the marijuana incident and self-reported his marijuana use
on February 10, 2023. (Item 1; Item 4)

Paragraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 1 are as follows:
1.a. In August 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the
Influence of alcohol (DUI). He attended a wedding reception prior to his arrest and drank
beer for three to four hours. He went to the party intending to drive home, and he believed
he  was  sufficiently  sober  to  drive.  He  was  stopped  due  to  poor  driving,  and  his  BAC
following the arrest was 0.15%. The arrest occurred three days before he submitted his
2021 e-QIP. (Tr. at 11-16, 47; GE 2 at 38.)
Applicant  pled  guilty  to  DUI  and  was  given  a  standard  first-offender  sentence
requiring  him  to  attend  a  three-month  alcohol  education  and  awareness  course.  The
requirements of the  course  included attendance at meetings of Alcoholics  Anonymous
and Mothers Against  Drunk Driving. The state motor vehicle  department (DMV) imposed
a  three-year  restriction   on   his  license,  which   will   end   in  2025.  The   DMV   also  required
Applicant to  have  a  breathalyzer interlock device  on  his car for a  period.  (Tr. at 14-15, 42-
43; 45; AE K; AE L.)
1.b.  Applicant experienced a prior arrest related to his use of alcohol. In 2015, he
and his then-girlfriend went to a bar. Applicant believes that someone added a drug to his
drink. He wrote in the Answer that a friend accompanied  him and his former girlfriend,
and the friend also believed he was drugged. Applicant has no memory of the events of
the evening. He believes his female companion was the actual target of the drug incident.
He claims that he subsequently learned that he went to a second bar where he had an
altercation with the bar’s bouncer. He was arrested and charged with Drunk in Public. He
hired  a  lawyer,  and  the  charge  was  dropped.  Applicant  submitted  no  corroborating
testimony regarding his claim that he was drugged, such as a written statement from the
friend who accompanied him to the first bar. (Tr. at 16-18, 35, 47; AE J at 2.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 2 are as follows:
2.a.  After  having  been  granted  access  to  classified  information  during  2011,
Applicant  attended  two  concerts  with  a  friend.  The  friend  gave  him  MDMA  (Ecstasy)
during  both  concerts,  which  occurred  in  or  about  December  2014  and  October  2015.
Applicant  took  the  illegal  drug  knowing  that  to  do  so  was  inconsistent  with  his
responsibilities and commitments as a person granted access to classified information.
He asserted at the hearing that these were just two instances of poor judgment. (Tr. at
18-19, 46.)
2.b. Beginning  in high  school and  extending  through  his college  years and  his post-
graduate   education   when   he   worked   at   a   DoD  facility,  Applicant   used   marijuana.  He
claims that  his  use  during  the  period  of 2010  to  2015  was  limited  to  four occasions.  (Tr.
at 19-21; AE G.)
The record contains his 2011 security clearance application in which he wrote that
his last use was in 2007  when he  was in high  school. He asserted, “I was young and I
have  no  desire  to  use  it  again.”  He  was  granted  a  clearance.  In  his  2021  e-QIP,  he
contradicted his disclosure in his 2011 security clearance application, that his last use of
marijuana was in 2007, by disclosing that his first use during the relevant time period was
in May 2010. He partially blamed his former girlfriend for his poor judgment in using illegal
drugs.  His  current  girlfriend  uses  marijuana  on  a  regular  basis  for  medical  purposes.
Applicant denied that her use of marijuana has any effect on his abstinence. He repeated
his 2011 statement regarding  his intent  not  to  use  marijuana  in the  future  by writing,  “I
have no desire to partake in these activities now or in the future.” (GE 1 at 36-37; GE 2
at 35.)
The Government does not allege in the SOR another government agency’s (AGA)
denial  of  Applicant’s  national  security  eligibility.  The  SOR  also  does  not  cross  allege,
under Guideline J, Applicant’s criminal conduct using illegal drugs.
Paragraph 3  (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 3 are as follows:
3.a.  The  Government  cross-alleges  the  two  alcohol-related  offenses  under
Guideline J under the guideline for Alcohol Consumption.
3.b. The SOR further alleges that Applicant continues to consume alcohol despite
his two alcohol-related arrests and his completion of a three-month alcohol education and
awareness program, which was required pursuant to his DUI sentence. Applicant asserts
that he drinks much less following his 2021 DUI arrest. He claims he now only drinks a
couple times a week at dinner on weekends. He acknowledged that he sometimes drinks
to the point of intoxication and has blacked out in the past, though not more than once a
year. He last drank excessively in the summer of 2021 at a friend’s birthday party. (Tr. at
25-26; 38-39.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 4 are as follows:
4.a. The Government cross-alleges the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b,
2.a, 2.b, and 3.b under Personal Conduct guideline.

"In Applicant's answer to the SOR, he admitted all allegations. His admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 43-year-old customer service representative. He has worked for his
sponsor since August 2021. He is a high school graduate and holds a technical certificate.
He received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army for his service from 2009-2015,
which included a deployment to a combat zone. He previously held a clearance in 2009.
He was married from 2011-2017 and remarried in 2021. He has one child of his own and
two stepchildren. (Item 3 at 7, 12-13, 17, 21, 23-25, and 35; Item 4 at 5.)
SOR  ¶¶   1.a,   3.a   and  3.b:  Failed   to   disclose   the   information  set  forth  in
subparagraph 3.a  that he  had used marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from about
June 2016  to  about  November 2021  and purchased marijuana  during this  period.
Applicant answered “No” to Question 23 of his August 2021 SCA, which asked whether
he  had  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances.  (Item  3  at  33.)  He  was
interviewed multiple times during the investigative process. During the first interview in
September  2021,  he  discussed  alcohol  abuse  and  financial  matters,  along  with  other
areas. (Item 4 at 13-15.) He was provided additional time to provide documentation to
support his answers concerning financial matters and was asked to provide paperwork to
the  investigator  for  release  of  his  medical  records.  (Item  4  at  17.)  He  subsequently
provided consent paperwork for the release of his mental health and alcohol counseling
records. After receiving these records, the investigator asked if he had any involvement
with illegal drugs. He answered yes and told the investigator that he had used marijuana
on a daily basis by himself in his house. (Item 4 at 21.) He explained that the marijuana
helped  with  his  anxiety  and  back  pain  and  that  he  had  to  buy  the  marijuana  illegally
through a friend. He stated the reason he did not truthfully answer the SCA question about
his drug use was because he did not think the investigation would include obtaining his
medical records. (Item 4 at 21.) After going through “drug and alcohol rehab” in June 2021
he  stated  that  he  tried  marijuana  again  but  did  not  like  the  feeling.  (Item  4  at  6.)  His
treatment  included  receiving  shots  to  get  him  off  marijuana  and  patches.  His  monthly
shots started in August 2021, but he admitted that he continued to use marijuana and had
used marijuana as recently as November 23, 2021. He listed as references three friends
who also use marijuana. (Item 4 at 21 and Item 3 at 22-23.)

4.a.   and   4.b,  accounts  charged  off  in  the   approximate   amounts   of   $21,054   and
$19,269.   Applicant  listed  one  debt  on  his  SCA.  When  asked  if  he  had  any  additional
qualifying debts by the investigator, he responded no. (Item 4 at 15.) When confronted by
the  investigator  with  two  charged-off  debts,  he  acknowledged  them  as  private  student
loans. (Item 4 at 15.) He took these loans out in approximately 1999 and they went into
collection in around 2006. He stated he did not disclose the delinquent student loans on
his SCA because he did not want to look bad.  He had utilized deferments while in the
military and later when he took classes between October 2015 and May 2018. He told the
investigator since May 2018 he has tried to forget about his student loans. (Item 4 at 15-
16 and Item 5 at 3, 8.)
SOR ¶¶  2.a  and 2.b:  Consumed alcohol, at times  in excess  and  to  the  point
of   intoxication,  from   about   June  2020   to   present   and  received  inpatient   alcohol
treatment from about June 2021 to about August 2021, with  a  diagnosis of alcohol
dependent.  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  received  inpatient  treatment  for  alcohol
dependency and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from June 2021 through August
2021. (Item 3 and Item 4 at 14.) He acknowledged consuming a bottle of tequila a day
from June 2020 until entering treatment in June 2021. In his September 2021 interview
with an investigator, he said that his alcohol use was “zero.” (Item 4 at 14.) He stated his
inpatient rehabilitation program had given him “the tools needed to abstain from alcohol.”
(Item 4 at 14.) In his November 2022 response to interrogatories, he acknowledged that
he continued to drink, but said that he had moderated his consumption and only drinks
one to two beers socially. He cited a recent Halloween party as an example. (Item 4 at
8.) He indicated he would be involved in an outpatient program. (Item 4 at 14.)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.d,  mostly  with
explanations. He admitted SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b, 3.a, 3.b, and 4.a-4.c, without comment. He
did not answer the cross-allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.c and 4.d. I construe those answers
as  denials.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  29  years  old.  He  has  never  married  and  he  has  no  children.  He
earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  2012  and  has  taken  some  college  courses.  He  has
been employed by a federal contractor as an information technology (IT) specialist since
August  2014.  He  testified  that  he  has  held  a  secret  or  interim  secret  clearance  since
2014, though he asserted  that he did not have  actual access to  classified  information.
He has held his current position as an IT team lead since May 2019. He has an annual
salary of about $96,000. He works on a military base. (GE 1; Tr. 12, 27-32, 61-65, 105)
In  March  2013,  Dr.  S  diagnosed  Applicant  with  major  depressive  disorder  and
atypical  depressive  disorder.  Dr.  S’s  notes  indicate  that  Applicant  “has  clinical
depression;  has  not  been  on  meds  for  several  months,  having  anxiety  attacks,  sleep
deprivation.”  He  was  brought  for  medical  attention  by  his  mother.  (GE  9)  He  did  not
seek medical approval before ceasing his medication at the time. (Tr. 68-70)
GE 8 is comprised of treatment records for Applicant from Dr. M and Dr. J from
September  2013  to  January  2019.  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  generalized  anxiety
disorder and atypical depressive disorder. He acknowledged experiencing symptoms of
depression and anxiety since age 12. (Tr. 65-67, 71-78, 80-81)
On or about September 27, 2017, Applicant then age 23, went to the emergency
room  (ER)  of  Hospital  C  complaining  of  depression  and  anxiety.  He  reported  drinking
alcohol and using cocaine as coping mechanisms, and that he had consumed a fifth of
alcohol and used cocaine the night before. He reported intermittent thoughts of suicide
(though  not  at  that  time)  but  has  never  had  a  plan.  (GE  5  at  1-2;  Tr.  83-85)  He  was
admitted to the hospital due to “suicidal ideation” (i.e., thoughts of suicide). (GE 2 at 13)
(SOR ¶ 1.a)
At  Hospital  C,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder,
recurrent,  moderate.  (GE  2  at  15)  He  was  discharged  from  Hospital  C  on  October  2,
2017 and referred to Treatment Center P for inpatient substance abuse treatment. (GE
2 at 15; Tr. 83-85) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 3.a) He was diagnosed at Treatment Center P with
alcohol  use  disorder,  severe;  cocaine  use  disorder,  severe;  cannabis  use  disorder,
severe, tobacco use disorder, mild; and major depressive disorder. (GE 6 at 2)
Treatment  Center  P  records  reflect  that  Applicant  reported  first using  alcohol  at
17. He was found to be severely dependent on alcohol, with daily reported use over the
previous three years. He reported drinking a fifth of alcohol 20 of the previous 30 days,
and  using  cocaine  five  of  the  previous  30  days,  before  his  ER  admission.  He  began
using marijuana at age 16 and used it for four years regularly. (GE 6 at 2; Tr. 79, 86-87)
(SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b)  During  his  testimony,  Applicant  asserted  that  the  frequency  of  his
cocaine  use,  as  reflected  in  GE  6,  is  inaccurate  as  he  only  recalled  or  acknowledged
using  cocaine  twice.  (Tr.  86-87)  He  denied  marijuana  use  within  30  days  of  entering
treatment. (Tr. 88; GE 6 at 2)
Applicant  did  not  complete  inpatient  treatment  at  Treatment  Center  P.  He  left
abruptly on October 14, 2017, reportedly because he did not want to be there anymore.
His  prognosis  was  poor  due  to  his  inability  to  successfully  complete  treatment.  It  was
noted that he  would benefit from readmission to residential treatment and involvement
in  a  12-step  program.  (GE  6  at  3;  Tr.  89)  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  It  was  recommended  that
Applicant  continue  to  abstain  from  alcohol  and  drugs;  that  he  consider  outpatient
psychiatric  treatment  and  behavioral  counseling;  attend  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA),
Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  or  other  meetings  daily;  and  submit  to  random  urinalysis
and  breath  analysis  as  directed.  (GE  6  at  1)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  not
done any of these things. (Tr. 90)
In December 2017, Applicant went to the ER at Hospital C due to insomnia and
acute anxiety after running out of his medication, Wellbutrin. He was not admitted. (GE
2 at 3. GE 7; Tr. 95-97) (SOR ¶ 3.b) Afterwards, his mother wrote a letter to his primary
care physician, Dr. J, about Applicant’s anxiety. (GE 8 at 8-9; Tr. 97)
Applicant  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  had  been  treated  for  depression  at
Hospital C in about September 2017 and needed to get on the right medication. (GE 1
at 24-25; Tr. 83) He reported being treated for alcohol use at Treatment Center P from
September to October 2017. (GE 1 at 27-28) He  did not report any  illegal drug use  in
the previous seven years; he reported no illegal drug involvement while in possession of
a clearance; and he reported no drug treatment. (GE 1 at 26-27) (SOR ¶¶ 4.a, 4.b) He
reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  had  been  previously  granted  a  clearance  by  DOD  but
provided no details. (GE 1 at 28-29)
Applicant  had  background  interviews  relating  to  his  SCA  in  September  2018,
May 2019, and July 2019. In his first interview, he verified his reported hospitalization at
Hospital C and said it was for depression. He also discussed his history of alcohol use.
He said he had not been diagnosed as abusing alcohol or being alcohol dependent. He
did not disclose any other issues of substance abuse. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 90)
In Applicant’s May 2019 interview, he said he was hospitalized at Hospital C for
one week for medication maintenance after his primary care physician, Dr. J, changed
his anti-depression medication. He said he was not hospitalized for any other condition.
He  discussed his substance abuse  counseling at Treatment Center  P, and his alcohol
involvement  and  history  at  the  time.  He  was  asked  if  he  had  used  illegal  drugs  in  the
past  seven  years,  to  include marijuana, and he  said  no.  (GE  2 at 8-10;  Tr.  83,  91-92)
(SOR ¶ 4.c) He acknowledged at his hearing that his time at Treatment Center P would
be considered drug counseling. (Tr. 92)
Applicant was interviewed a third time, in July 2019. He was confronted about his
prior marijuana and cocaine use. He said he had used cocaine once in 2017, then said
he used it once or twice between June 2011 and the present. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b) (Tr. 60)
He denied being a habitual user of cocaine and said his cocaine use was experimental.
He  said  he  used  marijuana  between  2008  and  late  2011  about  10  times  a  year,  with
varying frequency. He used it to help him sleep and to cope with depression. He said he
had  not used  marijuana  since  2011  and  had  not  used  cocaine  since  2017.  He  denied
intentionally omitting his illegal drug use from his SCA. Earlier in the interview, he said
he did not list his drug use because he believed it was not on record anywhere and was
not a problem. (GE 2 at 10-11; Tr. 92-93) (SOR ¶ 4.c)
Applicant also disclosed that the real reason for his hospitalization at Hospital C
in  2017  was  for  both  medication  maintenance  and  alcohol  treatment.  (GE  2  at  11-12)
He  authenticated  the  three  interview  summaries  as  accurate  in  a  signed  but  undated
interrogatory response. (GE 2)
In  November 2020,  Applicant participated  in a  psychological  evaluation  ordered
by  the  DOD  CAF  related  to  his  security  clearance  investigation.  The  evaluation  was
conducted  by  Dr.  B,  a  Ph.D.  licensed  clinical  psychologist.  She  reviewed  medical
records  provided  by  the  DOD  CAF,  as  well  as  his  SCA  and  background  interview
summaries.  She  also  conducted  a  clinical  interview,  testing  observations,  and  a
personality assessment inventory (PAI). (GE 3 at 1-2, GE 4) (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 3.c)
Applicant  told  Dr.  B  that  he  had  always  been  a  “casual”  drinker  and  had  never
engaged  in  binge  drinking.  He  drank  more  prior  to  his  2017  hospitalization  and  was
mixing  alcohol  with  his  prescribed  medications.  He  said  he  had  reduced  his  drinking
significantly since 2018, consuming a bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer a week. (GE 3
at 4) (SOR ¶ 1.d) He said he took Zoloft as needed and that he meets with his primary
care doctor every three months for refills. (GE  3 at 3, 4)
With respect to drug use, Applicant told Dr. B that he stopped smoking marijuana
at age 22. He acknowledged trying cocaine on “a couple of occasions in my past,” and
said he had only used cocaine twice in 2018. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b) He said his three-day
hospitalization in 2017 was due to switching medications and was “just to be safe.” He
did not disclose his 2017 substance abuse treatment at Center P or his subsequent ER
visit in 2017. It was noted that records from 2019 indicated that he has a history of not
being  fully  candid  about  his  cocaine  and  marijuana  use  during  interviews  and  in  his
case paperwork. (GE 3 at 4)
Dr.  B  found  that  Applicant  acknowledged  his  history  of  depression  and  anxiety
but tended to minimize  his symptoms. He “severely downplayed his history of alcohol,
cocaine,  and  marijuana  use  and  he  was  not  fully  candid  about  his  struggles  with
substances. His lack of candor “appears to be a pattern.” (GE 3 at 6)
Dr. B found Applicant’s lack of honesty regarding his history of substance abuse
“particularly concerning” since he failed to complete his residential treatment program in
2017;  he  was  given  a  poor  prognosis  by  counselors;  he  failed  to  follow  through  on
discharge  instructions;  had  not  received  mental  health  or  substance  abuse  treatment
since  2017  and  continued  to  consume  alcohol  at  a  fairly  high  level.  Dr.  B  found  that
Applicant’s  demonstrated  lack  of  honesty  impacted  the  credibility  of  his  self-reporting
about his prior drug use. His prognosis was “guarded, at best.” (GE 3 at 6)
Dr.  B.  diagnosed  Applicant  with  (1)  major  depressive  disorder  (moderate,
recurrent) (DSM 296.32); (2) alcohol use disorder, severe (DSM 303.90); (3) cannabis
disorder (severe) (DSM 304.30); and (4) stimulant use disorder (severe) (DSM 304.40).
(GE 3 at 6) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Dr.  B.  found  that  major  depressive  disorder  tends  to  be  a  chronic  and  highly
recurrent condition. Applicant has experienced symptoms since childhood. His tendency
to self-medicate, coupled with ongoing alcohol use, inadequate treatment and, “perhaps
most importantly, limited insight and transparency, point to a guarded prognosis. At this
time,  [Applicant’s]  diagnoses  could  pose  a  risk  to  his  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness concerning classified information.” (GE 3 at 6) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a,  because  he  said  he  never  had  or  expressed
thoughts  of  suicide.  (Tr.  33-34)  He  denied  SOR  ¶  1.b  because  he  said  he  abstained
from alcohol for a year, and sought therapy, but the doctor he consulted in late 2017 did
not  carry  his  insurance.  (Tr.  110)  He  did  not  pursue  mental  health  treatment  or
counseling after that or during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not done so since then.
(Tr. 110-111) He has consulted his primary care physician whom he has seen for many
years.  (Tr.  110-112)  He  is  currently  prescribed  propranolol  (anti-anxiety)  and  Zoloft
(anti-depressant).  (Answer;  Tr.  34-39)  He  said  he  continues  to  experience  “sundown
syndrome” (the worsening of his anxiety or depression at night). (Tr, 97-98; GE 8 at 8)
He denied mental health issues at work necessitating treatment. (Tr. 99)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  before  his  2017  treatment,  his  drinking  had
increased to four times a week, which he acknowledged was “binge drinking” and self-
medication, where “one day would lead to the next day.” (Tr. 42) He was consuming a
bottle of wine or a fifth of liquor per occasion. (Tr. 45-47, 78) He said it “took a while” to
realize what he was doing. He knows now that he cannot do that. This led him to self-
refer, with some family assistance, to Hospital C in 2017 for treatment and “so I can get
on the right medication.” (Tr. 43)
Applicant  said  he  left  Treatment  Center  P  because  of  anxiety  and  unfamiliarity
with  being  around  a  lot  of  people.  He  said  his  departure  did  not  relate  to  alcohol.  He
now  sees  that  he  should  have  completed  the  program.  He  recognizes  that  he  was  at
“rock-bottom” at the time and does not want to feel that way again. (Tr. 44-45)
Applicant said he resumed drinking socially after about a year of sobriety in about
2018  or  2019  but  consumed  less  alcohol.  (Tr.  39-41)  He  said  “I  knew  myself  enough
that, in a social capacity, I could be able to continue consuming alcohol.”  (Tr. 42) He did
so unilaterally, “coming [to] a personal moment, trying to, you know, see how I do.”  (Tr.
100)  He  acknowledged  that  this  was  “probably  not”   recommended.  He  found  it  a  “big
step”   that he could have one drink and then stop. (Tr. 101) Later, however, during the
COVID-19  pandemic,  when  he  was  at  home  teleworking  full  time,  he  on  occasion
consumed  a  whole  bottle  of  wine  or  a  12-pack  of  beer  at  home  at  one  sitting.  “Every
now and then throughout 2020 I did that,” he said. (Tr. 102)
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.c,  which  asserts  that  he  engages  in  ongoing  severe
substance  abuse.  (Answer;  Tr.  47-48)  He  testified  that  he  has  made  an  “agreement”
with himself to know his limits. He said he can go months without drinking. He continues
to have one or two drinks on dates or social occasions. He last had a drink three weeks
before the hearing, one or two drinks on a golf course, and then two months before that.
He said he had not been intoxicated in a year or more, when he had “a couple glasses
of mixed drinks” at his brother’s birthday party. (Tr. 49-51, 100)
Applicant  has  never  received  a  medical  opinion  that  he  could  drink  again.  (Tr.
102)  Since  2018,  he  has  sought  no  mental  health  counseling,  except  from  Dr.  J,  his
primary  care  physician.  He  sees  her  every  three  to  four  months  for  medication  refills
and for primary care treatment. He said he has “for the most part”  kept to his medication
regimen since his 2017 treatment, though he has continued drinking on days he took his
medication. He has not sought treatment in the ER since then. (Tr. 102-105)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  any  drug  or  alcohol  counseling  or  treatment
since  he  left  Treatment  Center  P.  He  has  not  participated  in  AA  meetings.  (Tr.  51-52,
112-113) He said he drinks alcohol less than once a week, and no longer consumes a
bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer at one sitting, as he did in 2020, at the time of  his
DOD evaluation by Dr. B. (Tr. 99-100)
Applicant said he had not used marijuana since 2011 and had not used cocaine
since  2017.  He  had  a  clearance  in  2017  when  he  used  cocaine.  He  used  it  twice,  in
social situations like at a bar. He acknowledged that cocaine and marijuana are illegal
under federal law and inconsistent with holding a clearance. He believes he is subject to
random drug testing at work. (Tr. 53-54, 88, 93-94, 105-107)
Applicant acknowledged that Dr. B’s report shows he used cocaine twice in 2018,
not  2017,  but  he  thinks  he  may  have  meant  2017.  (Tr.  107-108;  GE  3  at  4)  He  also
asserted that statements in Treatment Center P’s records that he used cocaine starting
at age 23 and used cocaine regularly for one year, including five of the past 3 days prior
to  September  26,  2017,  were  “not  accurate.”  Similarly,  he  denied  that  he  had  used
marijuana for four years regularly, asserting that he had not used marijuana since high
school.  (Tr.  108-109;  GE  6  at  2)  He  was  unable  to  explain  why  his  testimony
contradicted Dr. B’s records. (Tr. 109-110)
As to Guideline E, Applicant testified that he first applied for a clearance at age
20, and he was young and did not get good advice from his company on how to fill out
the SCA. He asserted that he did not disclose his 2011 marijuana use on his first SCA
(in 2014) due to naivety and because it occurred in high school, before he turned 18. He
graduated from high school in 2012. (Tr. 27-28, 55-59)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  did  not  disclose  his  2017  cocaine  use  or  his
2011 marijuana use on his 2018 SCA. (Tr. 54) He said he held a clearance at the time,
granted  sometime  after  2014.  (Tr.  57-58)  He  testified  that  he  did  not  input  any  new
information on his 2018 SCA. He was just told to “review this and just hit Okay.”  (Tr. 27-
28, 31) He did disclose  his treatments at Hospital C and Treatment  Center P  in 2017,
both  of  which  were  after  his  first  SCA.  (Tr.  32)  He  did  not  intend  to  mislead  the
government.  (Tr.  32)  He  said  he  came  clean  because  he  was  confronted  by  the
interviewer, who had evidence of his cocaine use in his medical records. (Tr. 56-57, 59-
60)
Applicant asserted that his future intention as to illegal drug use is “never to use.”
He  believes  he  is  “well  past  the  dependency  for  it  and  the  self-medication.”  He  will
continue drinking socially but will continue working on cutting back on his drinking. (Tr.
113-115) he said he always uses a ride-share service when he is out drinking and has
never had a DUI or been pulled over by the police. (Tr. 113-115)
Applicant has worked at his DOD job for his whole career. He cannot change the
past but can continue  to  work on  improving himself. He has had  no  criminal issues or
workplace issues. His personal issues have never affected his work life. (Tr. 28-30) He
closed his testimony by stating  that he has presented himself as best he can and has
come a long way in the last eight years. He feels blessed to be where he is today. He
loves his job and wants to continue his career. (Tr. 116-118)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  retained  counsel,  and  he  submitted  additional
exhibits.  In  a  post-hearing  Declaration,  he  said  he  wished  he  had  completed  the
program  at  Treatment  Center  P  in  2017,  but  still  learned  from  the  experience.  He
reaffirmed that he had not used cocaine or marijuana since leaving the facility. He said
that since his hearing, he has attended AA meetings. He did not see himself as “having
a problem” in the past but now acknowledges that “any use is [too] much.” He has dealt
with  clinical  depression  and  anxiety  for  most  of  his  adult  life  and  has  taken  them
seriously. He has begun vetting therapists so he can pursue regular care and continue
progressing. (AE C) Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent not to use illegal
drugs  in  the  future  and  acknowledged  that  any  violation  was  grounds  for  automatic
revocation of his clearance. (AE E)
Applicant  submitted  character  letters  from  two  longtime  friends  and  from  an
executive  with his employer.  They attest that  Applicant cares about  his job, his family,
his  friends,  and  his  career.  He  has  worked  hard  to  improve  himself.  He  is  very
trustworthy  personally  and  professionally.  He  is  more  mature  and  responsible  than  he
was earlier in his career. He is reliable, trustworthy, and emotionally stable. He should
retain his clearance. (AE D)
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard
",False
"In his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Paragraph
1 of the SOR, with explanations  He also provided additional information to support his
request for eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant is 28 years old, unmarried, and has no children. (GX 1 at pages 5, and
22~23.) He has a PhD in Philosophy in Counseling Psychology. (AppX Y at page 1.) He
has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  March  of  2022.  (TR  at  page  19  line  20  to
page 21 line 21.)
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement
1.a. and  1.g. Applicant admits he used  marijuana between 75~100 times during
the  time  period  December  of  2013  to  May  of  2022,  a  period  of  about  nine  years.  He
heaviest usage was in 2017, and Applicant used marijuana at least once after executing
his e-QIP in April of 2022. (TR at page 22 line 4 to page 26 line 25, and at page 36 line
19 to page 38 line 4.)
1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  purchased  marijuana  from  about  September 2016

once in about August of 2017, while visiting Amsterdam in the Netherlands. (TR at page
34 line 24 to page 35 line 14.)
Applicant  eschews  any  future  illegal  drug  usage,  and  has  signed  two  letters  of
intent in 2023 in that regard. (AppXs S and T.) He has also submitted negative drug test
results  from  March  of  2023.  (AppX  V.)  Applicant’s  testimony  was  forthright  and  his
integrity was apparent.
",False
"Applicant is 26 years old.  He has a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering
and  a  minor  in  Mathematics.  He  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  Project
Manager.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  has  an  extensive  history  of  illegal  drug  use  involving  marijuana,
cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms,  Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), and the use of
prescription  drugs  not  prescribed  to  him  include  Adderall,  Vyvanse,  Tramadol,  Vicodin
and  Xanax.  Applicant  was  hired  by  his  current  employer  on  July  8,  2021.  He  is
applying for a security clearance for the first time.
1.a. and 1.b.  Applicant  attended  college  from  August  2015  to  December  2020.  He
stated  that  he  started  using  marijuana  in  college,  in  July  2015,  and  continued  until
March  2022,  consuming  it  about  five  to  seven  times  a  week.  (Tr.  p.  38.)  Given  the
seven years he has used marijuana, he admits to using it over 1,000 times.  (Tr. p. 63.)
He would normally use it in social settings with his friends.
Applicant  started  working  for  his  current  employer  in  July  2021,  and  continued
using  marijuana  until  at  least  March  2022.  Applicant  testified  from  his  personal
knowledge  that  there  are  people  at  his  company  who  use  marijuana  and  who  hold
security clearances.  Applicant provided the names of two of these employees.  (Tr. p.
72.)  He mentioned that there are others, but he has only learned about  them through
the grapevine.
Applicant stated that he has now stopped using marijuana since he has become
aware  of  the  security  obligations  required  to  obtain  a  security  clearance.  During  the
years he used marijuana he also purchased it about once or twice a month to supply his
habit.  (Tr. p. 43.)
1.c.  and  1.d.  Applicant has used and purchased cocaine nine times from about 2015 to
April 2021.  He used cocaine in social  settings  with  his friends.  He  stated that he  did
not enjoy it.  He also used and purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms three times from
September  2016  to  about  March  2021.  He  did  not  particularly  enjoy  this  experience
either.  (Tr. p. 47-48.)
1.e.   Applicant  has  used  and  purchased  prescription  medications,  namely  Adderall
and  Vyvanse  not  prescribed  to  him,  from  about  August  2016  to  November  2018.  He
explained that he used it as a study aid.  He would usually use these drugs with friends
in his study group.
1.f.   Applicant used Tramadol on one occasion in October 2017.  He remembers that
he  had  pain  from  a  laceration  on  his  hand.  His  sister  had  a  pill  left  over  from  her
wisdom tooth removal, and she gave it to him.
1.g.   Applicant  used  Vicodin  on  one  occasion  in  about  July  2018.  He  suffered  a
hamstring injury while playing intramural football and a friend offered his Vicodin to him.
1.h.   Applicant  used  and  purchased  Lysergic  Acid  Diethylamide  (LSD)  on  two
occasions, once in March 2017, and again in May 2017.  He acknowledges that he was
young and naïve at the time.  He was outdoors in a nature setting or going on a hike at
the time he used it.  He stated that he did not really enjoy it, and he understood the risks
associated with the drug.
Applicant  sold  marijuana  in  2017.  He  explained  that  he  was  responsible  for
1.i.
taking the marijuana to a friend of  his, and then returning the  money to  another friend
who owned the marijuana, who had asked him to do the favor.  (Tr. p. 55-56.)  Applicant
did not receive any money for his efforts.
Applicant used and purchased Xanax not prescribed to him on two occasions in
1.j.
about August 2015.
Applicant admitted that he made a knowing and conscious decision to use these
drugs when he did so, and he knew that he violated both state and Federal law when he
used marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and hallucinogenic mushrooms.  (Tr. pp. 63-66.)
Letters  of  recommendation
from  Applicant’s  Senior  Manager  and  other
professional  colleagues,  including  a  roommate,  attest  to  Applicant’s  high  level  of
maturity  and  job  responsibility.  Applicant  is  considered  to  be  a  highly  driven
professional  and  the  go-to  person  as  an  expert  in  certain  areas  as  an  Engineer  and
Data Analyst.  Applicant’s good character, work ethic, and commitment to the principles
of integrity and confidentiality are noted.  However, only one individual who provided a
letter  of  recommendation  for  Applicant  makes  any  reference  to  being  aware  of
Applicant’s  history  of  illegal  drug  use,  and  characterizes  it  as  occurring  prior  to  his
employment with the company, which is not accurate.  Applicant testified that he did not
show the SOR to any of those who submitted letters on his behalf, and although he only
verbally  discussed  some  of  the  allegations  with  them,  he  did  not  provide  them  with
specifics.  Applicant testified that his Senior Manager, who has supported him, told the
security officer that if Applicant were to be denied his security clearance, steps would be
taken to keep him on the program.  (Tr. p. 75, and Applicant’s Exhibits E and I.)
Hair Drug Test results dated March 1, 2023; March 24, 2023; May 11, 2023; and
June 8, 2023, were negative.  (Applicant’s Exhibits B and H.)
Applicant  submitted  a Statement  of  Intent  dated  March  23,  2023,  declaring  that
he  will  never  misuse  substances  in  the  future.  He  plans  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement  and  substance  misuse  and  acknowledges  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  (Applicant’s Exhibit C.)
Notes  concerning  Applicant’s  performance  appraisals  indicate  that  he  was  an
excellent  performer  in  2021,  and  that  he  continues  to  be  impressive,  showing
outstanding  job  performance.  He  is  described  as  a  hard  worker  whose  skill  and
diligence has helped to make the projects successful.  He continues to be an extremely
valuable  member  of  the  team  as  he  continues  to  expand  his  knowledge  and
understanding of various aspects of his job responsibilities.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)

"After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant purchased and used  marijuana
from  about  January  2002  until  about  January  2022,  and  that  he  purchased  and  used
cocaine  from  about  January  2008  until  about  April  2022.  In  response  to  the  SOR,
Applicant admitted all allegations. (Items 1, 2, 3)
Applicant  is  39  years  old.  He  received  an  associate  degree  in  2017  and  a
bachelor’s degree in 2019. He married in November 2019 and his wife was pregnant with
their first child when he responded to the FORM.  He has been employed by a federal
contractor since  June 2022 as an IT Specialist. He has worked as a  restaurant  server
since 2011. He has no military experience and has never held a security clearance. (Items
4, 5; AE A)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  July  2022.  He
disclosed that he had purchased and used marijuana from January 2002 to January 2022.
He  first  used  marijuana  in  high  school,  characterized  his  use  as  casual,  social  and
recreational, noted that marijuana was a regular part of his life in his early 20’s, and that
his frequency of use dropped considerably as he aged. He could not provide an accurate
number of times that he had used marijuana. (Items 4, 5; AE A)
Applicant  also  reported  that  he  had  purchased  and  used  cocaine  from  January
2008 to April 2022. He characterized his use as casual and social, noted that he usually
used cocaine while drinking with friends and that his frequency of use varied from periods
of regular use (weekly or bi-weekly) to periods where he would not use cocaine for years
at a time. (Items 4, 5; AE A)
Appellant stated that he did not intend to purchase or use marijuana, cocaine or
other controlled substances in the future, He identified three reasons why he no longer
intended  to  use marijuana  or cocaine:  (1) he and  his wife  were  trying  to  start  a  family
which provided a source of motivation to clean up his life and facilitate his family’s growth
and prosperity; (2) he was inspired by a close friend, a high functioning alcoholic, who
had completed rehabilitation, cleaned up his act to help raise his daughter and was now
the happiest and healthiest Applicant had ever seen him, and (3) he was also motivated
to stop using drugs and drinking by the recent death of a close friend who died from an
overdose. He also stated that he had not misused prescription drugs in the previous seven
years, had not been ordered to or advised to seek drug counselling, and that he had not
sought counseling or treatment for his drug use. (Items 4, 5; AE A)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  August  2022  and
authenticated  the  accuracy  of  the  summary  of  that  interview.  His  interview  responses
were  consistent  with  his  SCA  disclosures  and  included  the  following  additional
information. (Items 4, 5)
He purchased marijuana from friends and used marijuana with friends and while
alone. Marijuana made him feel high but after a while he started feeling useless and was
not  productive.  He  purchased  and  used  cocaine  for  about  14  years.  He  purchased
cocaine from within his social circle, never from people that he did not know. He used
cocaine in homes and bars, often while drinking alcohol. His marijuana use was a big part
of his life and widely known, and most of his friends were aware that he used cocaine. He
has never grown, produced, or sold marijuana or cocaine. He has never had a positive
drug test or been arrested. He reiterated and emphasized his motivations for and intent
to abstain from future use of marijuana, cocaine, and other controlled substances. (Items
4, 5)
Applicant said that at some point in his mid-twenties, he felt dependent on cocaine
but overcame it. He reduced his use and took up golf as a hobby. He reported that his
cocaine use had strained his marriage when his spouse asked him to stop, he was unable
to do so and then lied about it. He weaned himself from cocaine when he got married and
tried to have a baby. After reducing his use, he lost his craving for cocaine. He last used
cocaine after his friend died. (Item 5)
Applicant did not provide documents or evidence in response to the SOR, but did
provide an email, signed statement, photo, and letter of intent to abstain from the illegal
use of controlled substances in response to the FORM. (Item 3; AE A)
In  his  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  reported  that  his  wife  was  15-weeks
pregnant and included a photo of a recent ultrasound. He said that he had been drug free
for  over  a  year  and  reduced  his  alcohol  consumption  by  “roughly  99.9  percent”  to  an
occasional  beer  at  dinner  with  his  father-in-law.  His  “desire  to  indulge  in  drug  use  or
consume alcohol is completely gone” and he is motivated to permanently maintain these
positive changes in his life. He is particularly motivated by his desire and responsibility to
provide a thriving home environment for his child. He reported that he no longer goes to
bars, clubs or house parties where drugs and alcohol are commonly used. He expressed
confidence  in  his  efforts  to  quit  using  drugs  permanently  noting  that  he  significantly
decreased  his  marijuana  and  cocaine  use  in  May  2021,  when  they  started  in-vitro
fertilization treatment, and that he reduced his drug use until he stopped using marijuana
in January 2022 and cocaine in April 2022. He reported that he no longer associates with
people  who  use  drugs,  avoids  environments  where  drugs  are  used,  and  submitted  a
notarized letter of intent to abstain from the illegal use of controlled substances dated May
12, 2023. (AE A)

"In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the three allegations, SOR ¶ 1.a,
that he used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2011 to about October 2021;
SOR ¶ 1.b, that he purchased marijuana from about June 2019 to about October 2021;
and SOR ¶ 1.c, that he intended to use marijuana in the future.
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2017. He seeks to obtain a security clearance. He attended
community  college  for three  years but did not  earn  a degree. He  is  single and  has no
children. (GE 1 at 12, 14, and 21.)
Applicant has a history of marijuana use. In his  2021 Questionnaire for National
Security Positions (SF 86), he reported using marijuana about two to three times a year
socially between 2011 and 2019. (GE 1 at 65 and Tr. at 17-18 27, 28.) After joining his
employer he was assigned work that required international travel and he started to use
marijuana to help him sleep. (Tr. at 14, 17.) He stated on the SF 86 that he intended to
use marijuana in the future because it helped him sleep. (GE 1 at 65 and Tr. at 12-14.)
He testified he would switch to other legal means to help him sleep. (Tr. at 28-29.) He
testified if it “stops [him] from getting [his] security clearance, [he] would not continue to
smoke  marijuana.”  (Tr.  at  21.)  In  response  to  whether  he  would  sign  a  statement
concerning future use of marijuana, he offered he would sign a statement declining future
use. (Tr. at 31.)
Applicant  lived  in  a  state  where  marijuana  became  legal  under  state  law  about
midway  during  the  period  alleged.  (Tr.  at  27.)  He  stated  he  never  illegally  purchased
marijuana but understood it was an illegal controlled substance under Federal law. (Tr. at
16, 21.) He admitted using marijuana in a social setting one or two times after receiving
the SOR. His last use was about month before the hearing. He felt the security clearance
application process was “extremely slow” and the project he would have used a security
clearance for had been completed so he used marijuana. He acknowledged this was not
an excuse.  (Tr. at 18, 21, 23, 27.) He listed on his SF 86 as references, persons with
whom he used marijuana socially. (Tr. at 29.)
Applicant testified he had been told by work colleagues, who also used marijuana
and held DoD security clearances, that if he was truthful, he would not have a problem.
(Tr. at 30-31.) When asked to divulge the people smoking marijuana while holding a DoD
security clearance, he declined to answer the question. (Tr. at 32.) He added that since
he did not have a security clearance, he would not report them. (Tr. at 36.) Any derogatory
information  that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualifying
purposes. However, it may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions, in
making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.

"In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the SOR allegations in ¶ 1.a, and she
denied the SOR allegations in ¶ 1.b. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a 44-year-old  senior manager.  (Tr. 26) She has been employed since
2001  working  for two  DOD contractors. (Tr. 23-25) She  received  four promotions  from  her

administration   and   information   management.  (Tr.  25)   Her  resume   provides   additional
information  about her employment history and background. (Tr. 25-26; GE 1; AE A)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used  marijuana  and  took  gummies  enhanced  with
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with varying frequency from about August 1999 to about July
2021. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges she used marijuana and took gummies enhanced with THC with
varying frequency from about September 2012 to about July 2021, after being granted
access to classified information.
In Applicant’s February 11, 2022 SCA, she said “I used marijuana a few times over
the last seven years in a recreational setting. I have smoked marijuana a few times and
taken gummies enhanced with THC. I would estimate use at 10 or less times in the last
7  years.”  (GE 1  at 29) In her March 31, 2022 Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
personal subject interview (PSI) she said:
[She]  admits  that  she   did  not  think  about  her  security  clearance   the   few
times that she  used  marijuana. She  didn’t actively use  her  clearance  at [that]
time  and  did  not think about it.  [She]  has  no  future  intent to  use  marijuana.
She   understands  that  using   marijuana   while   possessing   a   security
clearance is not allowed and could result in  termination.  (GE 2)
In  1999,  Applicant  used  marijuana  while  she  was  in  college.  (Tr.  42-43)  She
stopped using marijuana before she was hired by a DOD contractor in 2001. (Tr. 43) She
was tested for illegal drug use before she was hired. (Tr. 44) The DOD contractor’s policy
was employees were not allowed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs at work.
(Tr. 43) She was never drug tested after the DOD contractor employed her. (Tr. 44) She
did not use illegal drugs from 2001 to 2012. (Tr. 45)
In  2012, Applicant applied  for a  security clearance  because  her employer believed
she  might need  it in the  future. (Tr. 31) She  said  she  did not use  marijuana  in the  previous
seven  years on  her 2012  SCA.  (Tr. 34) In  2012,  she   did  not have  access to  classified
information.  (Tr. 31) About  two  months  after  her security clearance  was approved,  she
was transferred  to  a  different  state, and  she  did not need  a  security clearance. (Tr. 32)
She   never  used   marijuana   while  having   access  to   classified   information.  (Tr.  32)   She
understood   that  she   was  not   permitted   to   use   marijuana   while   she   had   a   security
clearance. (Tr. 34)  She  used  marijuana  a  few times from  2012  to  2014, which  was after
she   completed  her 2012   SCA.  (Tr. 45)   Although   she   did   not  have  access  to   classified
information,  she  used  marijuana  after  her security clearance  was  granted. (Tr. 46)  She
did  not  believe   her  employment  while  working   for  the   DOD  contractor  was  “sensitive”
employment.  (Tr. 52-53) Her annual pay in 2020  was about $135,000,  and  she  supervised
employees working  on  some  important DOD contracts  involving  weapons systems. (Tr.
53)  As   to   whether  her   employment  is  sensitive,  she   said   it  depends  on   how  the   term
“sensitive” is defined. (Tr. 54)
Applicant used marijuana two or three times between 2015 and July 2021. (Tr. 34,
38, 51) However, later she said she did not use marijuana from January 2014 through
October 2017. (Tr. 49; GE 1) She ended her association with the people with whom she
used marijuana, except for her husband who continues to use marijuana. (Tr. 35-37) She
has used marijuana with him in the past. (Tr. 50) He does not use marijuana in her home
or  in  her  presence.  (Tr.  37-38)  She  did  not  advise  her  facility  security  officer  of  her
marijuana use because she was not accessing classified information. (Tr. 48)
Applicant stopped using marijuana in July 2021 because she was looking for new
employment,  her  daughter  was  getting  older,  and  she  had  made  some  other  life-style
changes. (Tr. 38) She has not received any medical treatment for abuse of illegal drugs.
(Tr.  39;  AE  I)  Her  primary-care  physician  indicates  she  has  not  been  prescribed  any
controlled substances; she has not received any inpatient mental-health treatment; and
she has been of “sound mental health.” (Tr. 39; AE H)
Applicant regrets her marijuana use, and she does not intend to use marijuana in
the  future.  (Tr.  40;  AE  I)  She  acknowledged  her  marijuana  use  was  wrong,  and  she
apologized for her marijuana use. (Tr. 42) She provided a signed statement of intent to
abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future
involvement  or misuse  is  grounds  for  or  would  result  in  revocation of  national security
eligibility.  (AE  I)  See  AG  ¶  26(b)(3),  infra.  She  offered  to  voluntarily  submit  to  random
urinalysis testing for detection of abuse of illegal drugs. (Tr. 40-41) On April 24, 2023, she
tested negative in a urinalysis-drug test for the presence of illegal drugs in her body. (Tr.

Applicant received excellent performance evaluations, which included “exceeded
expectations” in the areas of integrity and trust. (Tr. 27-30; AE B-AE F) Her ratings were

"Applicant  is   36   years  old.   He   recently  married,   for  the   first  time,   and   has   no
children.  He   earned   a   high   school   diploma   in  June   2005   and   a   Computer  Support
Technician   Certificate   from   a   technical  college   in  May  2015.  He   began   his  current
employment  as a  computer network support technician  with  a  major defense  contractor
in  August  2014,  and   has  held  a   security  clearance   since   2018   in  connection   with   that
work.  He never served  in the  military or held a  Federal civil service  position. (GE  1;  Tr. 7-
8, 25-28.)
On  May  24,  2018,  Applicant  submitted  his  initial  Electronic  Questionnaires  for
Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  to  apply  for  a  security  clearance  that  he  needed  to
move into a position involving access to classified information. As alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b,
he responded, “No,” to the question in Section 23 asking, “In the last seven (7) years,
have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled
substance  includes  injecting,  snorting,  inhaling,  swallowing,  experimenting  with  or
otherwise consuming any drug or controlled substance.” He was granted a final Secret
clearance by the DoD CAF in August 2018. (GE 1; GE 4, Tr. 27-30.)
In early 2021 Applicant decided to improve his potential employment opportunities
by applying for a part-time second job with a government agency (GA). The job required
a Top Secret clearance. He was not asked to submit another e-QIP, but underwent an
enhanced background investigation. During his initial interview during May 2021, he told
the GA investigator that he had not used illegal drugs, including marijuana. He was then
scheduled to take a July 2021 polygraph test. During the pre-polygraph interview on the
test date, he admitted that he had smoked marijuana. The details of the investigation by
the  GA  were  not  entered  into  this  record.  However,  Applicant  confirmed  that  he  first
disclosed  his  previous  use  of  marijuana  to  security  officials  during  that  July  2021
interview. Due to the resulting security concerns, the GA denied him a clearance and did
not hire him. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 24, 29-31, 47-49.)
After  he  confessed  his  drug  use  to  the  GA  in  July  2021,  he  told  his  full-time
employer’s security officer (FSO) about his previously undisclosed drug use. That security
officer  directed  him  to  complete  another  e-QIP,  in  which  he  wrote  that  he  had  used
marijuana between April 2004 and May 2021 in the form of THC candy consumption or
smoking. He said this was “very very infrequent” and occurred a total of approximately 20
times. This information was forwarded to the DoD CAF, for its consideration whether his
DoD Secret clearance should be revoked. During an interview with an investigator from
the  Office of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  on  March  28,  2022, he  reiterated  that  he
smoked marijuana approximately 20 times during the reported dates, but said that he had
difficulty  providing  an  accurate  approximation.  He  said  that  he  never  purchased
marijuana, but used it “at parties and sometimes after work,” and that he had not sought
professional counseling or treatment for marijuana use. His testimony during the hearing
was broadly consistent with these assertions. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 31-34.)
Applicant testified that his most recent period of marijuana use occurred during the
COVID-19 pandemic, when he started a second job moonlighting in a bar and restaurant.
He  worked there  from October 2020 until  May  2021. He  said  he and  friends  from that
employment  would  go  out  after  the  bar  closed  to  share  marijuana  at  parties.  His
description of this activity portrayed a regular pattern during this seven-month period. He
claimed that these marijuana parties took place on days when the bar closed earlier in
the evening, rather than on the nights when it closed in the early morning hours. However,
he also said that he did participate when he had to work the next morning at his weekday
job with the defense contractor. It is unusual that the bar where he worked would have
closed  early  on  Friday  and  Saturday  nights,  but  after  midnight  on  Sundays  through
Thursdays  preceding  his  workdays.  Those  incongruent  assertions  raise  significant
credibility issues, as do his repeated and vague minimizations in describing his drug-use
history while holding and seeking to upgrade his security clearance. (Tr. 35-40, 45-47.)
In  his  2021  e-QIP,  Applicant  said  that  he  was  “in  search  for  a  drug  awareness
class.”  In  response to DOHA  interrogatories he  said,  “I  have  research  [sic]  some  drug
improvement class, but was unaware which one would fit the [GA] criteria.”  During his
hearing testimony he said that he had not attended any such programs. He described his
continuing  use  of  marijuana  until  May  2021  as,  “a  bad  choice  in  judgement,”  “a  bad
choice,” and “a lapse in judgement.” He further stated that he is, “committed to not taken
[sic] any more substance,” and “there will be no further use after incident.” He no longer
parties with his former coworkers from the bar. The record contains no evaluation from a
doctor  or  other  medical  professional  assessing  the  level  of  Applicant’s  drug  abuse,  or
expressing a prognosis for future abstinence. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 38, 45.)
Applicant  testified  that,  while  applying  for  his  initial  security  clearance  with  the
defense  contractor,  he  intentionally  falsified  his  2018  e-QIP  because  he  knew  that  an
honest disclosure of his recent marijuana use would reduce his chances to obtain the job
and a security clearance. He also testified that he knew his marijuana use was illegal at
the  time.  As  noted  above,  he  initially  attempted  to  deceive  the  GA  investigators
concerning  his  ongoing  marijuana  use  again  in  2021,  but  admitted  it  when  he  was
confronted with taking a polygraph examination. (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. 29-31, 42-44.)
Applicant also provided a post-hearing written statement of intent and “agreement
to  not  engage  in  any  marijuana  and  any  other  drugs  use  while  contracted  for  the  US
Federal  Government.”  He  also  agreed  “to  abide  by  all  laws,  rules  and  regulations
pertaining to marijuana use.” (AE A.)
Applicant’s  parents  and  sister  wrote  letters  describing  him  as  enthusiastic,
ambitious, persistent, and a great leader who learns from his mistakes and takes charge
to come up with different ways to accomplish tasks. His manager wrote that he always
works  hard,  operates  in  an  ethical  manner,  performs  at  a  very  high  level,  and  has  a
supportive  loving  family.  Applicant’s  wife  describes  him  as  “a  reliable,  trustworthy,
straightforward,  honest  man.”  She  said  he  has  “always  abided  by  the  protocols  and
procedures of his work, taking classification seriously, never sharing private information,
and  always  stepping  in  to  help  his  coworkers.”  She  said,  “His  integrity  is  extremely
important to him and others recognize him for it.” (AE B.)

On September 21, 2022, Department Counsel amended SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.c, 3.a, and 4.a.
The  amendment  purported  to  amend  SOR  ¶  5.f,  but  there  was  no  paragraph  5  in  the
original SOR. Applicant admitted all the amended allegations. At the hearing, Department
Counsel  corrected  the  erroneous  references  to  SOR  ¶¶  5.f  and  5.g  and  submitted  a
corrected amendment with the amended language in italics. The corrected version of the
SOR as amended before and during the hearing, with the changes in italics, is attached
to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. Applicant indicated on the record that he understood
the amendments and corrections of the SOR. (Tr. 8) His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant is  31  years  old. He  has been  offered  a  position  with  a  defense  contractor,
contingent  on   obtaining   a   security  clearance.   He   married   in   December   2014,  and   they
had  two  children, now ages 6  and  7. He divorced  his first wife  on  a  date  not reflected  in
the  record. He  married  his current wife  in November 2020, with  whom  he  has a  10-month-
old daughter.
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  June  2014  to  November
2016 and received an other than honorable discharge. He received a security clearance
while on active duty.
In April 2015, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform
Code  of  Military  Justice,  10  U.S.C.  §  815,  for  assaulting  another  sailor.  The  incident
involved a fist fight that occurred when Applicant asked a fellow sailor to help out on a
project and the fellow sailor did not respond. (GX 6 at 12) His punishment was restriction
for 30 days, extra duties for 30 days, reduction in rate, and forfeiture of one half of his
basic pay per month for two months. (GX 8 at 8)
In August 2016, Applicant and his wife had an altercation over his text messages
with another woman. At the hearing, he testified that his wife choked him, and he slapped
her to stop her from choking him. (Tr. 35-36) Applicant received nonjudicial punishment
for this incident, which consisted of reduction in rate, and forfeiture of one half of his pay
per month for two months, suspended for six months. (GX 8 at 2)
In November 2016, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery
on a family member. This incident occurred when Applicant  was playing a video game
when his wife was talking to him. When he ignored her, she broke the game controller,
and he responded by smashing the television screen. (GX 6 at 9) His wife claimed that
he struck her in the face and head, knocking her to the floor. At the hearing, he denied
hitting her, but admitted that he pushed her. He was charged by civilian authorities with
misdemeanor  assault  and  battery  on  a  family  member.  The  civilian  prosecution  was
deferred in February 2019 to enable Applicant to complete court-ordered counseling.  (GX
7 at 6; Tr. 40-41)
During  the  November  2016  altercation,  Applicant’s  wife  was  holding  their  baby
daughter. A protective order was issued against Applicant, and in January 2017, he was
listed as a child abuser in the state child abuse and neglect registry. (GX 11; GX 12) He
will remain on the registry until November 2023. (Tr. 41)
Applicant testified that he did not tell his commanding officer or the police that his
wife was the aggressor in the domestic incidents. His wife was on active duty in the Navy
and he kept silent in an effort to enable her to retain her military benefits. (Tr. 43)
On the day after the November 2016 altercation, Applicant attempted to commit
suicide by overdosing a prescribed muscle relaxant. He called his wife and told her that
he  had  ingested  the  drugs.  His  wife  called  an  ambulance,  and  he  was  taken  to  an
emergency room and then admitted to a military hospital. He received medical treatment
and  was  diagnosed  with  an  adjustment  disorder  with  depressed  mood.  He  was
hospitalized for two or three days and discharged. The medical authorities recommended
that he attend outpatient psychotherapy. He testified that he did not obtain psychotherapy
as  recommended,  but  he  began  obtaining  therapy  about  six  months  later  and  was
diagnosed with anxiety. He stopped the therapy when his therapist retired around 2019.
He resumed therapy for about six months in 2020 but stopped when his insurance would
no longer cover it. (Tr. 43-47; GX 5; GX 6 at 9)
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2012 to 2013. He resumed
his marijuana use in 2017, after he was discharged from the Navy, using it once or twice
a month. (GX 6 at 20). He testified that he has not smoked marijuana since 2020, because
most of his friends with whom he smoked marijuana are married and have children, and
several are DOD employees. (Tr. 66)
In  April  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  of  drugs,
possession of marijuana, tampering with evidence, driving with defective equipment, and
operation of a vehicle with an expired license tag. The evidence tampering charge was
based  on  a  police  officer  accusing  him  of  attempting  to  eat  marijuana  that  was  in  the
vehicle when he and an acquaintance were stopped by police. (GX 6 at 14)
The  police  report for the  April 2017  incident recites that the  police  were  operating
a   driver’s  license   checkpoint,   and   they  observed   Applicant’s  vehicle  turn  around   in  a
parking   lot   in  an   apparent  attempt  to   avoid  the   checkpoint.   At  the   hearing,  Applicant
admitted avoiding the checkpoint because he knew that his license tags were expired.
(Tr. 52)
When the police officer stopped Applicant’s vehicle, he noticed a strong smell of
marijuana, and observed that Applicant’s eyes were glassy and he seemed “out of it.” He
observed small pieces  of  what appeared  to  be  marijuana  in  Appellant’s lap  and  on  his
shirt. When Applicant exited the car, the piece of marijuana that was on his lap fell onto
the ground. The police officer asked Applicant to open his mouth and he saw small pieces
of  marijuana  on  his  tongue,  and  his  tongue  was  covered  with  a  green  film.  Applicant
declined to be tested for drugs. (GX 13)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  believed  he  was  innocent  of  the  drug
charges,  but  he  was  told  that  his  trial  would  not  be  until  eight  months  later  unless  he
pleaded guilty. (Tr. 57-58) In June 2017, he pleaded guilty, was convicted of driving under
the influence of drugs, and was sentenced to eight days in jail and community service.
He was placed on probation for 60 months. For the marijuana possession, he was fined
$1,200 and placed on probation for 12 months. For tampering with evidence, he was fined
$750 and placed on probation for 12 months. (GX 7 at 9; GX 9)
In  January 2019, Applicant failed  to  report to  his probation  officer as  required. (GX
10) At  the  hearing, he  testified  that  he  failed  to  report because  he  was unsuccessful in
trying  to  contact the  new probation  officer who  was assigned  to  his case. (Tr. 60-61) The
probation  officer’s affidavit, dated  January 24,  2019, recited  that the  probation  officer had
called Applicant at least twice at a telephone  number that is the same  telephone number
as Applicant  provided  in  his answer to  the  SOR. As of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant
had  not contacted  his probation  officer. As  a  result, the  running  of his time  on  probation
has been tolled  since January 24, 2019, and  he  is still on  probation. (Tr. 63)
At  the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  psychologist  in
October 2021. The psychologist concluded that Applicant “does not appear to have any
mental  health  conditions  that  would  negatively  impact  his  ability  or  willingness  to
safeguard  classified  information.”  However,  the  psychologist  also  noted  that  Applicant
“has personality  characteristics and  behavioral tendencies that  could negatively impact
his judgment and trustworthiness.” (GX 3 at 8)
When Applicant submitted his SCAs in December 2013 and September 2018, he
did not disclose that he used marijuana with varying frequency between 2012 and 2013.
(GX 1 at  30-31; GX 2 at 19) In his answer to the SOR amendment and at the hearing,
He admitted intentionally not disclosing it in both SCAs. He testified that a military recruiter
advised him not to disclose it. (Tr. 14, 67)
Applicant admitted that he did not disclose his arrest for assault and battery in his
September 2018 SCA, because he believed it was not reflected in his record. (Tr. 68) He
disclosed his arrest for DUI and stated that he was awaiting trial. He did not disclose that
he was also charged with possession of marijuana, was convicted and sentenced, and
that  he  was  on  probation.  When  he  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in
December  2018,  he  admitted  that  he  did  not  disclose  his  probation  because  he  was
concerned that it would affect his application for a security clearance. (GX 6 at 15) When
he  was  evaluated  by  a  psychologist  in  October  2021,  he  admitted  that  he  thought  he
might be able to get by with not disclosing his probation. (GX 3 at 5)
When  Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  May  2022,  he  disclosed
that he used marijuana a few times in 2017. He did not disclose that he used marijuana
in 2020. (GX 6 at 20) During his psychological evaluation, he disclosed that he last used
marijuana in 2020, and he confirmed that disclosure at the hearing. (GX 3 at 5; Tr. 66) At
the hearing, he testified that he did not know why he did not fully disclose his marijuana
use in 2020 but he “probably didn’t think about it too hard.” (Tr. 72)
Applicant’s spouse submitted a statement describing him as an exceptional father
and husband with unwavering commitment to the wellbeing of his family. (AX A) A friend
of Applicant for more than eight years describes him as a gifted manager who is forthright,
fair, discreet, and “supremely knowledgeable.” (AX B) A former shipmate describes him
as  a  hardworking,  self-driven,  and  effective  leader.  (AX  C)  A  joint  statement  from  14
sailors  with  ratings  and  ranks  ranging  from  petty  officer  second  class  to  lieutenant
describes Applicant as an outstanding sailor and lists his multiple accomplishments while
in  the  Navy.  (AX  D;  AX  E)  A  retired  sailor  who  has  known  Applicant  for  nine  years
describes him as very respectful of privacy, classified information, rules, and restrictions.
(AX F). A petty officer second class with nine years of Navy service admires Applicant for
his exemplary work ethic, innate generosity, steadfastness, and dependability. (AX G)
",True
"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted,  without  comment,  to  the  single
allegation of drug involvement in this SOR. His admission is incorporated in my findings
of fact.
Applicant is a 25-year-old engineer currently sponsored by a defense contractor.
He  graduated  from  high  school  in  May  2016,  and  subsequently  enrolled  in  a  full-time
university program of study in August 2016. He completed the program in May 2020, and
was awarded a bachelor’s degree. Applicant has never been married and does not have
children.
Applicant completed  his first  SCA in March 2021,  while being  sponsored  by  the
U.S. Customs  and  Border  Protection  (Customs). He disclosed  that  Customs  determined
he  was ineligible  for a   security clearance  and  thus denied  his request  for a  clearance.
(Item  4  at 7, and  Item  3  at 60)  He previously disclosed  in his SCA that he  purchased  and
used  marijuana  from  September 2016  through  February 2021, and  that the  frequency of
his marijuana  use  was “approximately  4-5  times per month.” He stated  he  used  marijuana
for “stress  relief.” (Item   2   at   43   through   44)   He  also   indicated   his   intention   to   continue
using  marijuana  in the  future, responding “yes”  to  this question.  (Item  2 at 44)
Applicant subsequently completed his second nearly identical SCA in November
2021, this time, sponsored by a defense contractor. (Item 3) He made additional updated
disclosures in his second SCA. For example, he disclosed he continued to use marijuana
through September 2021, with the same frequency and for the same stated purpose of
stress  relief.  He  also  continued  to  purchase  marijuana  during  this  period.  He  did  not
include the additional dates  because marijuana, he  stated, was no  longer illegal in  his
state. Rather than through friends and others, he purchased marijuana through a state
dispensary.  (Item  3  at  57  through  59)  He  again  stated  his  intention  to  continue  using
marijuana in the future. (Item 3 at 58)
In his February 2022 interview, after the investigator informed him using marijuana
was federally illegal, Applicant stated he would discontinue using marijuana if this affects
his job and  that he would  have no future  intent.  He  previously  stated during the  same
interview that he was not dependent on marijuana, that he could stop using it at any time,
and that he had never received treatment or counseling for marijuana use. He also told
the investigator marijuana had a calming effect on him and that he used it to relieve stress.
(Item 4 at 7)
In  about  November  2022,  prior  to  issuance  of  the  SOR,  Applicant  verified  the
accuracy of his summarized interview with DoD investigators, and responded to specific
questions  concerning  his  most  recent  drug  involvement.  (Item  4)  He  admitted  he
continued his use of marijuana through October 2022, stating he used it “about every 10
days.” He also reiterated prior statements made concerning his future intent, namely, that
he would continue using marijuana in the future, and that he had no intent to change his
behavior. (Item 4 at 9)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the Guideline H allegations,
he also listed what mitigating circumstances he believed applied to his case. I adopt his
admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 31  years old.  He has never married and has no children. He works
as  a  software  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor,  who  he  has  worked  for  since  2014.
This contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq.
Applicant  holds  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  science.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since 2016. (Tr. 22-24, 34, 37, 47; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana from about 2008 to about 2013, and
from  about  September  2020  to  at  least  December  2021;  and  that  he  used  marijuana
from about September 2020 to least December 2021, while granted access to classified
information.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b)  The  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b  are  established  by
Applicant’s  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  admissions,  his  admissions  in  his
answers to interrogatories and his background interview, and his admissions in his SOR
answer. (GE 1-3; SOR answer)
Applicant  started  using  marijuana  in 2008  when he  was  17  or  18 years old.  He
used  marijuana  approximately  400  times  between  2008  and  2013.  Use  of  marijuana
was  illegal  under  state  law  where  Applicant  resided  until  2012.  He  claimed  to  have
stopped using marijuana in 2013 because it no longer fit his lifestyle. He began working
for  his  current  employer  in  2014  and  shortly  thereafter  completed  his  first  SCA.  He
admitted  his  earlier  use  of  marijuana  in  his  2014  SCA.  He  was  granted  a  security
clearance in 2016. He worked on a classified project from 2016 through approximately
2020,  when  he  no  longer  worked  on  that  project.  He  claimed  that  he  did  not  use
marijuana  during  this  time  period.  He  was  advised  by  his  work  supervisor  not  to  start
using marijuana now that he was no longer working on a classified project.  (Tr. 24-25,
31-32, 35-36, 41, 57; GE 2)
Applicant  resumed  using  marijuana  in  approximately  September  2020.  He
continued  his  use  through  approximately  December  2021.  He  testified  that  he  used
marijuana  one  to  three  times  a  week.  He  used  marijuana  with  his  then-girlfriend,  with
whom  he  no  longer  associates.  He  stated  his  reason  for  using  marijuana  during  this
time  span  was  to  relieve  stress  that  he  was  experiencing  due  to  the  isolation  from
friends and coworkers caused by the pandemic. He held a security clearance during this
entire  period,  but  he  clarified  that  he  only  had  access  to  classified  information  from
November  2021  to  December  2021.  He  admitted  knowing  his  employer’s  drug  policy,
which  prohibited  using  marijuana.  He  was  told  by  his  employer  in  2021  that  it  wanted
him on another classified project. He was required to fill out another SCA in May 2021
and  undergo  a  background  interview  in  June  and  July  2021.  He  admitted  using
marijuana after undergoing these security clearance activities. (Tr. 25-26, 33, 38-39, 42,
44, 47, 49; GE 2)
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  asserted  that  he  would  not  use  marijuana  in  the
future. He denied that he was dependent on marijuana. He offered evidence that on four
occasions  between  October 2022  and  February  2023,  he  provided  urine  samples  that
tested negative for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana. He
began seeing a therapist in June 2022. He sees her weekly. She testified that they have
worked on how Applicant can better cope  with anxiety and stress. She uses Cognitive
Behavior Therapy as a  tool to address these  topics  and to decrease  his desire  to use
marijuana.  She  has  seen  improvements  in  him.  Applicant  also  presented  a  self-
administrated form for alcohol or drug abuse. While the assessment put Applicant at the
risk  level  of  “None  to  Low,”  I  gave  little  weight  to  this  assessment  because  all  the
information is provided by Applicant in response to “yes and no” questions. (Tr. 27, 30,
42-43, 50, 61-66; AE A-B)
Applicant’s  former supervisor,  who  worked  with  him on a  classified project from
2016 to 2020, testified for him and offered a written statement of support. He stated that
Applicant is an excellent engineer and is a trustworthy person. He is the supervisor who
warned  Applicant  not  to  use  marijuana  after  concluding  his  work  on  the  classified
project in 2020. He is also aware of  Applicant’s  marijuana use after 2020 but believes
he  has  learned  from  the  experience  and  recommends  him  for  a  clearance.  Applicant
presented  several  years’  worth  of  performance  appraisals  where  he  was  rated  as
“exceeded or significantly exceeded” expectations.” (Tr. 52-57; AE C-D)

thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He has worked for his current contractor-employer since
January 2020. He served in the U.S. Army from 1991 until 2001, when he was honorably
discharged. He has worked for various government contractors since his Army discharge.
He has taken some college courses. He is divorced and has one adult child. He has held
a security clearance or a public trust position in the past. (Tr. 5, 18-19, 22; GE1-2)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  gave  false
information  on  his  March  2022  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  when  he  failed  to
disclose that he was fired from a job within the past seven years because of a positive
urinalysis test (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) and his illegal drug use (SOR ¶ 1.c). It also alleged that
he was terminated from his job in April 2019 because he tested positive for marijuana
(SOR ¶ 1.d). It alleged that he admitted to a background investigator that he intentionally
omitted  information  from  his  SCA  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  It  also  alleged  he  used  marijuana  and
tested positive for its presence in 1995 or 1996, while possessing a security clearance
(SOR ¶ 1.f). Applicant admitted all the allegations during his background interview, in his
SOR answer, and during his testimony. (Tr. 19-22; GE 2; SOR answer)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged in April 2019 Applicant failed a urinalysis test
for marijuana (SOR ¶ 2.a); and that he was arrested in August 2003 for unlawful use and
possession of a controlled substance marijuana (SOR ¶ 2.b). Applicant admitted all the
allegations during his background interview, in his SOR answer, and during his testimony.
(Tr. 19-24; GE 2; SOR answer)
Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleged the drug allegations stated in SOR ¶ 2
above (SOR ¶ 3.a and 3.j). It also alleged a series of criminal arrests as follows: a March
1992 arrest in a foreign country for misuse of privileges (SOR ¶ 3.i); a July 1992 arrest
for theft of government property (SOR ¶ 3.h); an August 1993 arrest for adultery (SOR ¶
3.g); a  December 1993  arrest  for adultery (SOR  ¶  3.f); a  June  2000  arrest  for  assault
(SOR ¶ 3.e); a July 2000 arrest for driving while license under restraint (SOR ¶ 3.d); an
April 2001  arrest  for his failure  to  appear (SOR  ¶  3.c);  and  his August  2001  arrest  for
damaging  property,  criminal  mischief,  and  making  a  false  police  report  (SOR  ¶  3.b).
Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations,  except  for  SOR  ¶¶  3.f  and  3.h,  during  his
background interview, in his SOR answer, and during his testimony. (Tr. 19-24, 26-31,
34-37, 40-42, 45-46; GE 2; SOR answer)
In 2019, Applicant was working for his employer on a government project. He held
a  position of trust at  the time.  He knowingly ingested some edible marijuana lozenges
while employed by this company. He consumed two over two days. Three weeks later,
he was assigned to drive a company vehicle  and was involved in an accident. He was
required to take a urinalysis test because of the accident. It came back with a positive
result for the presence of marijuana. His employer immediately terminated him from his
position based upon  his use of marijuana. He  was aware of the  company’s drug  policy
and knew he was not allowed to use any illegal drugs during his employment with this
contractor. (Tr. 21-22, 45; GE 2)
In  March 2022,  Applicant  completed  an  SCA  for  his current  employer.  He  gave
false information on his SCA when he deliberately failed to disclose in Section 13A and
13C that he was fired for cause in 2019 because of his use of marijuana as established
by a positive urinalysis test. He also deliberately failed to disclose his 2019 marijuana use
in Section 23 of his 2022 SCA. During his background investigation and at his hearing,
Applicant admitted knowingly making these false statements because he was afraid that
revealing  the  truth  would  jeopardize  his chances  of  receiving  a  security  clearance.  He
admitted his arrest for using and possessing marijuana in 2003 on a military installation.
He  denied  the  marijuana  was  his,  or that  he used  it  on  that  occasion,  and  there  is no
record  evidence  contradicting  his  statement.  He  admitted  using  marijuana  and  testing
positive for it in approximately 1995 or 1996 when he was in the Army. (Tr. 19, 46; GE 2)
In August 2001, he was angry with his ex-wife who was storing some furniture at
his residence. In his anger, he destroyed several pieces of furniture. He later called the
police and reported that someone broke into his house and destroyed the furniture. He
was confronted by the officers about submitting false information and admitted that he did
so.  He  was  charged  with  destruction  of  property  and  filing  a  false  police  report.  He
admitted committing these offenses. (Tr. 30-31; GE 2, 4)
Applicant admitted his arrest for failing to appear for a court appearance in 2001.
He admitted his arrest for driving while his license was under restraint in July 2000. He
admitted his arrest for assault in June 2000. He admitted his arrest for adultery in August
1993. He admitted his arrest in March 1992 for misuse of privileges. There is no additional
evidence available about these offenses. (SOR answer)
Applicant  denied  an  arrest  for  adultery and sodomy  in  December 1993,  and  an
arrest for larceny of government property in July 1992. There is no evidence in the record
to contradict his denials. (Tr. 27, 35; GE 1-4; SOR answer)
Applicant testified that he has not used marijuana since 2019. He has not been
arrested since 2003. He provided a written statement promising to abstain from using any
illegal substances in the future. (Tr. 25, 29, 33; AE A)

"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in her Answer, with explanations. She
is 34 years old. As of her May 2022 security clearance application (SCA), she was not
married, she did not have any children, and she has lived with her parents since 2019.
She graduated from high school in 2008. She attended college in 2008 or 2009 and in
2013,  but  she  did  not  earn  a  degree.  She  has  worked  as  a  mechanical  technician  for
her  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  approximately  November  2010.  She  was  first
granted a security clearance in approximately April 2019. (Items 1-6)
Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from approximately July 2008
to  November  2017.  (SOR  ¶  2.b)  She  used  it  socially  and  less  than  ten  times.  She
disclosed this marijuana use on her July 2018 SCA. She indicated therein that she did
not intend to use marijuana  in the future because, “I don’t like the smell or taste of it.”
(Items 2-4)
In  approximately  July  2021,  while  holding  a  security  clearance,  Applicant
purchased  and  used  a  vape  pen  containing  marijuana.  She  indicated  in  her  August
2022 background interview that  she smoked marijuana on this occasion recreationally,
in her home, with a friend because she was bored. It made her feel relaxed. She further
indicated that she realized she was not allowed to consume marijuana while possessing
a security clearance, but she made a bad judgment call. She stated in her January 2023
response  to  interrogatories  that  this  was  a  “one  time  purchase  with  cash  legally  in
California. I think it was $30.” She stated that she decided thereafter to stop using illegal
substances  because  “I  just  didn’t  like  it  and  I  honestly  felt  bad  about  it.”  She  further
stated  that  she  did  not  have  any  intentions  for  future  marijuana  use,  and  she  did  not
associate  with  individuals  who  use  illegal  substances  or  frequent  places  where  illegal
substances are used. (SOR ¶ 2.a; Items 2, 5)
Applicant  did  not  disclose   her  relevant  drug   involvement   in  response   to   section
23   of  her  2022   SCA,   which   inquired   about   illegal  use   of  drugs  or  drug   activity.  She
marked  “No,”  and  did not  disclose  her marijuana  use  from  2015  to  2017,  and  in  2021,  in
response   to   a   question   that   inquired   whether  she   had   illegally   used   any   drug   or
controlled   substances   in  the   last   seven   years.  She   also   marked   “No,”   and   did  not
disclose her  use  of  marijuana  in  2021, while holding  a  security clearance,  in  response  to
a  question  that inquired  whether  she  had  ever illegally used  or otherwise been  illegally
involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while possessing  a  security  clearance.  She
also disclosed  that she  had  a  security clearance  that was granted  to  her in 2019. (GE  2-

"In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.a  and  2.a.  He
denied SOR allegations ¶¶ 2.b – 2.e. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of
fact. (Item 2)
Applicant is 35 years old. Since January 2020, he has been employed by a defense
contractor  and  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance.  He  served  on  active  duty  with  the
United  States  Army  from  January  2007  to  August  2011,  separating  with  an  honorable

The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  H  that  Applicant  smoked  marijuana  (THC)  in
November  or  December  2019  and  tested  positive  for  THC  in  a  work-related  urinalysis
test.  (SOR  ¶  1.a:  Item  4;  Item  6)  Under  Guideline  E,  Personal  Conduct,  it  is  alleged
Applicant was fired by his employer in 2019 after his positive urinalysis test. (SOR ¶ 2.a:
Item 4; Item 6) Several falsifications are also alleged under Guideline E, to include:
SOR  ¶   2.b:   Applicant  falsified  material  facts  in  response  to  DOD  CAF
Interrogatories, dated November 9, 2021, in response to question 8, “Have you ever failed
a  scheduled  or  random  drug  test?”  Applicant  answered  “No.”  He  failed  to  mention  his
2019 urinalysis test which was positive for THC. (Item 4; Item 5 at 5; Item 6)
SOR ¶  2.c:
Applicant falsified his January 31, 2020 SCA in response to Section
13A  - Employee  Activities,  concerning  his  employment  with  Employer  A,  “for  this
employment, have any of the following happened to you in the last seven (7) years? Fired;
Quit after being told you would be fired; Left by mutual agreement following charges or
allegations of misconduct; [or] Left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory
performance?” Applicant answered, “No.”  He failed to disclose he was fired by Employer
A  because  of  his  positive  urinalysis  in  2019.  He  listed  on  the  SCA  that  his  reason  for
leaving his employment with Employer A was “baby on the way.” (Item 3 at 14-15; Item 4
at 7-8)
SOR ¶  2.d:
Applicant falsified his January 31, 2020 SCA in response to Section
23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. “In the last seven (7) years, have you illegally
used any drugs or controlled substances?” Applicant answered “No.” He failed to disclose
his 2019 marijuana use. (Item 3 at 31; Item 4)
SOR    ¶   2.e:  Despite  receiving  a  citation  for  driving  with  no  evidence  of  current
registration in March 2019, Applicant continued to drive the same vehicle without a valid
registration. He received another citation for the same offense in November 2019. He was
found guilty of both offenses. He did not pay the $867 fine and civil assessment that was
imposed for the first offense, which resulted in the court sending the debt to a collection
agency  in  June  2021. (Items  7  –  8)  He  admits  that  he  drove  his  car  without  a  current
registration. He continued to drive  the car after receiving a citation because it was the
only way he could get to work. Although he claims he paid the fines and civil assessment,
he did not provide proof that it was paid. (Item 6 at 9-11) In his Response to the SOR,
Applicant denied this allegation, stating that he was not aware of this issue. (Item 2)
In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  claims  he  misunderstood  the  questions
regarding  SOR  ¶¶  2.b  –  2.d.  In  other  words,  he  did  not  intentionally  withhold  any
information on his security clearance application. On April 30, 2020, he was interviewed
by  an  investigator  in  conjunction  with  his  security  clearance  background  investigation.
The  investigator  questioned  him  about  his  employment  with  Employer  A,  specifically
whether he ever received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended or
disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, or terminated. Applicant replied, “No.”  The
investigator confronted him with information that Employer A fired him because he failed
a  post-accident drug  screen. Once confronted,  Applicant  admitted to  having a  positive
drug test for marijuana in November or December 2019. He said Employer A allowed him
to resign in lieu of being terminated. He admitted to using marijuana on one occasion to
treat back pain after he hurt his back at work. Employer A later sent him to an urgent care
clinic  to  have  his  back  checked  because  it  was  a  work-related  injury.  Applicant  was
required to provide a urine sample as part of the treatment. The sample tested positive
for marijuana. (Item 6 at 7-8)
A  few  days  later,  Applicant’s  supervisor  informed  him  that  he  violated  the  drug
policy and would be terminated. He told his supervisor that he would resign because he
needed a better paying job. He believed his employment record with Company A would
indicate he resigned. He did not list his termination on the January 2020  SCA because
he did not believe he was terminated. He claims he only used marijuana on one occasion.
He has not used marijuana since. He is aware that he is not allowed to use marijuana or
other drugs while holding a security clearance. (Item 6 at 8)
The  investigator  who  interviewed  Applicant  prepared  an  unsworn  summary  of
Applicant’s Personal Subject Interview. On September 18, 2022, Applicant certified that
the unsworn summary of his April 30, 2020 personal subject interview was accurate in
response to DOHA interrogatories. (Item 6) He indicated:
I swear (or affirm)  that the  statements on  this form, and  any attachments to
it, are true, complete, and  correct to  the  best or my knowledge  and  belief
and  are  made  in  good  faith. I understand  that a  knowing  and  willful false
statement  on   this  form   or  attachments  can   be   punished   by  fine   or
imprisonment or both.
In response to the same interrogatory, he answered, “Yes,” to question (1) “Does
the  report  accurately  reflect  the  information  that  you  provided  during  your  interview?”
(Item  6  at  2,  17-18)  I  find  SOR  ¶  2.b  for  Applicant.  While  Applicant  denied  failing  “a
scheduled or random drug test” in response question 8 on interrogatories sent to him by
the  Department  of  Defense  on  November  9,  2021,  he  previously  admitted  to  testing
positive  for  marijuana  during  a  work-related  urinalysis  during  his  personal  subject
interview  on  April  30,  2020.  The  Government  was  on  notice  that  Applicant  failed  a
urinalysis test. His incorrect answer to question 8 on the November 2021 Interrogatory

"Applicant is 35 years old.  She has a Bachelor’s degree in Ceramic Art.  She is
employed by a defense contractor as a  Research Project Manager.  She is seeking to
obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled  substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  has  an  extensive  history  of  illegal  drug  use  beginning  in  high  school,
involving  marijuana,  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  (psilocybin),  ecstasy,  and  cocaine.
Applicant has worked in the defense industry since 2010.  She was hired by her current
employer in November 2017, as an Engineer, Level 1, and has moved up quickly to her
current position.  She is applying for a security clearance for the first time.
Applicant  began  using  marijuana  in  high  school  in  October  2003  with  varying
frequency.  Her use of marijuana continued through college and afterwards until about
2014.  For the most part,  from 2014 to 2017,  Applicant stopped using all illegal drugs,
including  marijuana.  From  2017  to  January  2021,  she  made  new  friends  and  started
using marijuana again, about once a month.  She explained that she would occasionally
hit someone’s vape pen during a social event or if it were offered to her.  (Tr. pp. 41-42.)
She  ate  edibles  twice,  but  found  them  to  be  too  strong.  She  enjoyed  marijuana  as  it
helped her relax and helped her sleep.  (Tr. p. 23.)  Applicant has not used marijuana
since about January 2021.
Applicant began using ecstasy in May 2004 while in high school.  That summer
she  used  it  twice  a  month  with  her  friends  until  about  mid-August  2004.  She  did  use
ecstasy  again  until  2008,  and  continued  to  use  it  with  varying  frequency  until  about
October 2020.  (Tr. p. 29.)
Applicant used  cocaine  one time  in  high  school in  May 2004.  She  did not  use  it
again  until about  2018/2019.  She  stated  that  she  used  it about 15  times between  2018
and   2020/2021.     (Tr.  p.  23.)     She   did   not  particularly  like   it,   and   so   she   did   not  use   it
again  until  recently.   She  stated  that  she  used  it  only  on  the  weekends when  she  knew  it
would not  impact her job.  (Tr.  p.  25.)   She  has a  friend  that  she  would use  cocaine  with,
and when  her friend  moved,  she  made  a  conscious decision  to  stop  using  cocaine.   (Tr.
p. 26.)   Applicant last used cocaine in January 2021.
Applicant  has  used  psilocybin  mushrooms  a  total  of  about  eight  times,  three
times from  May 2004 to 2010; and five times between 2015 to  May 2022.  (Tr. p. 33.)
She  has  also  used  LSD  on  three  occasions,  twice  in  college,  and  once  in  May  2020.
(Tr. p. 33-34.)  She does not want to use mushrooms again because they take her out
of control.  Applicant stated that she normally did not have to pay for her illegal drugs.
Often her friends would provide them for her.  (Tr. pp. 31-32.)
During her interview with OPM, Applicant indicated that she could potentially use
mushrooms  in  the  future.  She  stated  that  her  opinions  on  the  matter  have  changed.
She  stated  that  her  two  years  of  sobriety  have  made  her  feel  the  most  balanced  and
clear  that  she  has  felt  for  some  time.  She  enjoys  this  lifestyle.  Her  priorities  have
changed.  She stated that she is now more focused on her career and building a future
for herself.  (Government Exhibit 2.)
From  about  2014  to  2017  Applicant  tapered  off  her marijuana  use  and  was  not
using illegal drugs of any sort.  (Tr. p. 34.)  She explained that when she moved from
State A to State B at the end of 2017, she was  alone and had  no friends.  She made
new friends and slowly accumulated people close to her who used illegal drugs.
Applicant  stated  that  she  was  never  addicted  to  any  hard  drugs.  She  is  now
trying to live a cleaner lifestyle.  She stated that she is in a place of sobriety from illegal
substances, accomplishing this on her own, and has even stopped smoking cigarettes.
She  has  friends  who  casually  participate  in  these  substances,  but  their  use  does  not
impact  her  decisions.  Her  motivation  for  curtailing  her  illegal  drug  use  was  not
prompted  by  her  desire  for  a  security  clearance.  She  stated  that  she  did  not  like  the
recovery process which took several days after using drugs, and she did not feel good
during  that  time.  (Tr.  p.  38.)  She  also  currently  has  a  boyfriend  who  she  has  been
dating  since  May  2022.  He  has  a  Top  Secret  clearance.  They  spend  lots  of  time
together and they do not do drugs.  (Tr. p. 43.)
A  letter  from  Applicant’s  best  friend,  who  has  known  her  for  at  least  ten  years,
attests  to  her  good  character,  hard-working  nature,  and  commitment  to  values.  She
recognizes  Applicant  as  an  honest,  intelligent,  reliable,  trustworthy  individual.  She
knows that Applicant has partaken in illegal substances, but no longer feels that these
experiences  serve  her  and  her  growth,  and  has  made  the  commitment  to  a  drug-free
lifestyle.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)

"Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana between 1968
and  January  2022  (SOR  1.a);  that  between  June  2014  and  January  2022,  his  use  of
marijuana occurred while he had access to classified information (SOR 1.b); and that he
intends to continue using marijuana (SOR 1.c). (FORM, Item 1)
In response to the SOR, he admitted, with comments, the allegations at SOR 1.a
and 1.b. He denied, with comments, the SOR 1.c allegation. (FORM, Item 2) The facts
alleged at SOR 1.a and 1.b are established by his admissions, and based on my review
of the information presented in the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  71-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked  in  an  information  technology  (IT)  position  since  November  2010.  He  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in 1982, and he has been married since  1984. He and his wife have
one adult child. (FORM, Item 3)
Applicant disclosed in Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his 2021
e-QIP that he used marijuana between June 2014 and May 2020. He could not state with
any precision how many times or how often he used marijuana because he did not use
or possess the drug unless he happened to be socializing with friends who were using
marijuana and offered it to him. As to his intentions regarding future use of marijuana, he
stated the following:
I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t going to ever, ever again have a smoke knowing
it’s quite likely I will find myself (as I have in the past) in a situation sometime
in  the  future  where  others  are  passing  it  around.  You  might  find  this
incredible to believe, but marijuana is really popular, especially now that it
is (about to be) legal in [the state where he lives and works]. (FORM, Item
3)
On August 25, 2021, Applicant completed a personal subject interview (PSI) by a
government investigator as part of his most recent background investigation. During the
PSI,  he  confirmed  his  disclosed  use  between  2014  and  2020,  estimating  he  smokes
marijuana between three and six times a year when it is offered to him in social settings.
He also stated that he knows his drug use violates federal workplace policies. In response
to  interrogatories  from  Department  Counsel,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  has  used
marijuana since 1968, but ceased frequent use in 1984. When he was first hired by his
current employer in 2010, he submitted an e-QIP in which he was required to disclose,
inter alia, any illegal drug use in the preceding seven years. He answered “no” to all of
the  Section  23  questions  in  that  clearance  application.  He  was  first  granted  a  security
clearance  and  access  to  classified  information  based  on  a  background  investigation
completed in March 2011. As to his future intent to use marijuana, Applicant now avers
that  he  will  abstain  from  using  marijuana  while  he  has  “an  active  security  clearance.”
(FORM, Items 2, 5, and 6)
Sua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I
controlled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal
law.  Guidance  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  (OASD)  in
February  2013,  and  by  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (DNI)  in  December  2021,
makes  clear  that  changes  in  the  laws  pertaining  to  marijuana  by  the  various  states,
territories,  and  the  District  of  Columbia  do  not  alter  the  current  National  Security
Adjudicative  Guidelines.  Because  federal  law  supersedes  state  laws  on  this  issue,
Applicant’s use of marijuana, regardless of location or medical justification in his state of
residence, is illegal. Further, federal workplaces prohibit illegal drug use by civilian federal
employees and by persons employed for work on federal contracts.

"Applicant  admitted  the allegations  in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d, 2.a  and 2.b,  with
explanations.  He  denied  SOR  ¶  2.c,  with  explanations.  I  have  incorporated  his
admissions  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. He earned some college credits but not a degree. He
was  married  from  2005  to  2007.  He  remarried  in  2016  and  was  divorced  in  2020.  He
has two children from his second marriage, ages 11 and 6. He has been employed by
federal contractors since approximately 2011 and by his present employer since 2019.
He  is  responsible  for  providing  maintenance  on  the  hardware  of  both  classified  and
unclassified  government  computers.  He  stated  he  does  not  have  access  to  classified
sites but is responsible for the cables and fiber optics to them. (Tr. 16-22, 104-108; GE
1)
Applicant and his second wife separated sometime around May 2019. He stated
that he believed at that time they were still working on saving their marriage. In October
2019,  he  learned  that  she  obtained  a  default  judgment  for  divorce  from  him.  The
judgment  was  later  vacated,  and  they  proceeded  to  divorce  and  were  awarded  equal
custody of the children. After the divorce was final, he learned from one of his children
that his ex-wife had been having an affair with his cousin while they were still married.
Applicant sent her inappropriate text messages. He admitted he lost his temper. Based
on the text messages, his ex-wife sought protection from the court. (Tr. 22-29; GE 2, 3)
Prior to the hearing, Applicant’s attorney advised him that it would be beneficial if
he started an anger management class. When he enrolled, it was recommended that he
also take a class on domestic abuse, which included the anger management class. The
class lasted 24 weeks. When he went to court, the judge ruled the text messages were
harassing  and  threatening,  which  resulted  in  an  ex  parte  order  of  protection  issued
against Applicant in July 2020. He was not permitted to see his children as part of this
order. He was ordered to continue taking  the  anger management classes. (Tr.27-38, 84-
86;  AE A; Answer to  the SOR)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  severe  back  pain  and  in  2013,  his  doctor
prescribed  oxycodone  for  the  pain.  He  did  not  feel  good  on  the  pain  medication.  In
2015, due to his own concern about the addictive nature of the drug, he told his doctor
he  wanted  to  pursue  different  pain  management.  He  was  weened  off  oxycodone.  His
doctor  suggested  he  use  Cannabidiol  (CBD).  He  was  told  it  was  natural  and  not  a
narcotic.  It  relieved  his  pain  and allowed  him  to  function  normally.  Applicant  stated  he
could purchase the CBD legally in his state. He used it as a muscle relaxer for his pain
and back condition. He believed he could use CBD because it is legal in his state. He
did  not  know of  any  federal law  implications.  He  purchased and  used  it  regularly  from
May 2015 to May 2021. (Tr. 39-52, 91-100)
The  Security  Executive  Agent  for  the  United  States  Government  provided
clarifying guidance concerning marijuana on December 21, 2021. Part of that guidance
addressed CBD products:
With  respect to  the  use  of CBD  products,  agencies should be  aware  that
using   these   cannabis   derivatives   may  be   relevant   to   adjudications  in
accordance   with   SEAD  4.   Although   the   passage   of  the   Agricultural
Improvement  Act of  2018  excluded  hemp  from  the  definition  of  marijuana
within  the   Controlled   Substances   Act,   products  containing   greater  than   a
0.3   percent   concentration   of   delta-9   tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC),  a
psychoactive  ingredient in marijuana, do  not  meet the  definition  of  “hemp.”
Accordingly,   products   labeled   as   hemp-derived   that  contain   greater  than
0.3   percent  THC  continue   to   meet   the   legal   definition   of  marijuana,  and
therefore  remain   illegal  to   use   under  federal  law  and   policy.  Additionally,
agencies  should be  aware  that the  Federal Drug  Administration  does not
certify  levels of   THC in  CBD products,   so   the   percentage  of   THC cannot
be   guaranteed,  thus  posing   a   concern  pertaining   to   the   use   of  a   CBD
product under federal law.  Studies have   shown  that   some   CBD products
exceed   the   0.3   percent   THC  threshold   for  hemp,   notwithstanding
advertising  labels (Reference  F). Therefore,  there  is a  risk that using  these
products  may nonetheless cause  sufficiently high  levels of THC to  result in
a   positive  marijuana   test   under  agency-administered   employment  or
random  drug  testing  programs. Should an  individual test positive, they will
be   subject   to   an   investigation   under  specific  guidelines  established   by
their home agency.
The  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services  Administration  (SAMSHA)
provided a warning about CBD products on July 24, 2019:
labeling   does  not
Studies   have   shown   that   some   CBD  products’
accurately  reflect  their  content.   Cannabis  based   products  containing   a
THC   level  greater  than   0.3%  on   a  dry  weight  basis  do   not  fall   under  the
Farm   Bill’s  definition   of  hemp   even   if  they   are  labeled   as  such.   In   one
study,  the   amount  of   CBD  in  69%  of  the   84   tested   CBD  products  was
inconsistent  with   that  on   the   label,   and   some   products  contained
unlabeled   cannabinoids,  including   THC  in  amounts  up   to   6.4   mg/ml.  As
such,  an   employee’s  drug   test  may  be   positive  for  the   THC  metabolite,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA), due  to  THC in the
CBD product.
SAMSHA  further  advised  that  “federal  agencies  should  make  every  effort  to
inform  applicants  and  employees  of  the  risk  that  using  such  products  may  result  in  a
positive marijuana test.”
Applicant  passed  a  number  of  drug  tests  and  provided  the  results.  He  testified
that  he  asked  his  supervisor  if  he  was  permitted  to  use  CBD  and  was  told  it  was  not
illegal. (Tr. 47-48; AE B)
In May 2021, Applicant went back to court to have his visitation with his children
reinstated.  The  court determined  that  if  both  parties  wanted  to  see  their  children,  they
were  required  to  take  a  drug  test.  Applicant  testified  that  earlier  that  month,  he  was
attending  a  bachelor  party  in  a  state  where  marijuana  is  legal.  He  testified  he  used
marijuana at the party and was aware  that although it was legal in the state where he
was  located,  it was illegal under federal  law.  He held a security clearance  at the time.
He said it had been a stressful year due to the court proceedings, and he decided “well
I’ll just have fun one night.” (Tr. 39, 53-55, 91-92)
While  in  court,  the  judge  asked  Applicant  if  any  drug  would  be  detected  during
the drug screening. Applicant told the Court about his marijuana use earlier that month
and that he is prescribed Adderall. The judge told both parties before the drug test that if
they  did  not  testify  honestly,  they  would  be  subject  to  contempt  and  a  ten-day  jail
sentence. Applicant’s drug screen tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine.
Applicant adamantly denied he knowingly used methamphetamine. He said he had no
idea how he tested positive for methamphetamine, but he had several theories. He said
the judge believed he had lied to him. Applicant concurred that he would have believed
the same if he saw a positive drug result. Applicant testified that the judge told him that
he needed to go to drug rehabilitation and assess his life, and he told him how to live.
Applicant  acknowledged  he  had  a  negative  attitude,  and  he  was  upset.  He  told  the
judge  “You  need to  worry  about  you.  I got me.”  Applicant  testified  that  he  was held  in
contempt of court because the judge believed he was dishonest about his drug use after
he tested positive for two illegal drugs. He served a 10-day sentence for contempt. (Tr.
55-63, 86-88; GE 2)
Applicant  testified  that  part of  his visitation  order  is  that  if  he  wanted  to  see  his
children, he had to provide a drug screen. Applicant did not have to do a drug screen if
he  did  not  plan  to  see  his  children.  Applicant  provided  negative  drug  screen  results
taken from hair follicles. This type of test is able to detect a longer period if drugs are in
the  system.  He  provided  negative  test  results  from  November  2021,  February  2022,
November  2022,  December  2022,  January   2023,  February  2023,  May  2023,  and   July
2023. (Tr. 77; AE B)
Applicant testified that he sent a group text message to his  former stepson, the
son of his ex-wife, wishing him a happy birthday. The text also went to his ex-wife. He
said he did not realize she was on the group text. She believed it was a violation of the
no  contact  ex  parte  order.  Court  documents from  November 2021  state  that  Applicant
admitted  he  was  held  in  civil  contempt  for  violating  a  no  contact  order.  He  denied  his
text had any derogatory message. (Tr. 65-75, 88-91; GE 2 page 13)
Applicant  testified  that  he  continued  to  participate  in  counseling  even  after  the
24-week  class  ended.  He  said  he  did  not  know  he  had  anger  issues  until  he  went
through  counseling. He still meets with a counselor, and they have lunch together. He
also  attends  classes  occasionally.  The  counselor  provided  a  report  that  Applicant  had
successfully  completed  the  required  session.  He  made  a  $2,500  donation  to  his
counselor’s facility. (Tr. 84-86; AE A)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  going  through  a  difficult  time  in  his  life  when  he
was  dealing  with  an  acrimonious  divorce,  and  he  was  unable  to  see  his  children.  He
attributed his marijuana use to stress in his life. He loves and is devoted to his job. He
admitted he made a mistake. Applicant’s post-hearing statement mentioned his family’s
service  in  the military and  federal government.  He  stated he  is not  a  threat  or liability.
He  stated:  “I  refused  to  snitch  when  I  tested  positive  for  drugs  and  was  charged  with
contempt.” He further stated that he does not sell out his friends, family, or country. He
believes he has been an asset to the military community. (Tr. 78; AE C)

answer  to  “Section  22  –  Police  Record  .  .  .  (EVER)  been  charged  with  an  offense
involving alcohol,” by answering “No.” I find this to be a willful falsification of a relevant
question about his alcohol use.

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted one of the allegations in the SOR (¶ 1.a), and
denied the other allegation (¶ 1.b). He also provided some explanation for his conduct. I
adopt  his  admission  as  a  finding  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. (Items
1, 3)
Applicant is 25  years  old.  He  is single,  never has married,  and  has no  children.
He  has  worked   as   a   network  technician   for his  current  employer,   a   federal   contractor,
since  March  2022.  That contractor is subject  to  the  drug-free  workplace  provisions  of  41
U.S.C.  701   et  seq.   Applicant   completed   his  academic   requirements  for  his   bachelor’s
degree, but as of  May 2022, it had not been  awarded.  (Items  4,  5)
The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  H,  that  Applicant  used  and  purchased
marijuana  from  May  2015  to  at  least  May  2022  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  It  also  alleged  that
Applicant  used  marijuana  after  completing  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on
April 7, 2022 (SOR¶ 1.b)
Applicant  admitted  his  marijuana  use  in  his  April  2022  SCA,  his  May  2022
personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an  investigator,  and  in  his  March  2023  SOR
answer. In his SOR answer, he denied using and purchasing marijuana after completing
his SCA in April 2022. He previously admitted using marijuana through May 2022 during
his PSI. (Items 3-5)
During Applicant’s PSI, he stated that his marijuana use started in approximately
2014-2015 after he fell off a truck and injured his back.  He admitted not getting proper
medical  treatment  for  his  injury  and  instead  started  using  marijuana  for  pain
management. In approximately June 2015, he began getting marijuana from his friends
and smoking it to alleviate his back pain. He used marijuana irregularly from June 2015
to August 2016. He abstained from August 2016 to  March 2017. After March 2017, he
started using marijuana on weekends sporadically. This frequency of use continued until
December  2018  when  he  stopped  again.  From  March  2020  until  the  time  of  his  PSI
(May 2022), he used marijuana on weekdays. (Item 5)
In  June  2018,  he  was  ticketed  for  possession  of  marijuana  because  his
passenger had lit up a marijuana joint just as the police officer arrived. The charge was
dismissed when his friend admitted ownership of the marijuana. (Item 5)
Applicant  provided  medical  information,  attached  to  his  SOR  answer,  that
described  his  back  pain  issues.  The  doctor  performing  the  more  recent  examination
(sometime in 2021) came up with a plan that he should seek a surgery consult, or if no
surgery was recommended, he should start physical therapy. No further information was
provided. (Item 3)
To  help  with  his back pain,  Applicant  claims  he  now  follows his  doctor’s  advice
regarding pain management, performs yoga, wears a back brace, uses a massage gun,
meditates daily, uses CBD cream, and stretches. (Item 3)

"Applicant is a 29-year-old engineer currently sponsored by a defense contractor.
He  graduated  from  high  school  in  May  2012,  and  subsequently  enrolled  in  a  full-time
university program of study in June 2012. He completed the program in May 2017, and
was awarded a bachelor’s degree. Applicant has never been married and does not have
children.
From  about  January  2015  through  about  May  2017,  Applicant  participated  in  a
special university work experience program for engineering majors. In this program, he
was paid as an employee of the university, but physically worked part-time with a defense
contractor. (Item 4 at 12; and Item 10 at 1) In February 2017, he completed his first SCA,
sponsored by the same defense contractor. After graduation in May 2017, he was hired
as a full-time employee of the same defense contractor. (Item 4 at 12, and Item 10 at 1)
He began working as a mechanical engineering associate at that time. (Item AE-A at 1)
In  his  February  2017  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  he  used  marijuana  from  August
2012  through  December  2016,  describing  his  marijuana  use  as  “sporadic”  throughout
college  and  occurring  mostly  during  summer  and  winter  breaks.  (Item  4  at  26)  He
responded “no” to the question of whether he intended to continue using marijuana in the
future, explaining:
It's [not] worth risking my future career to get high. None of my successful
family  members  smoke  marijuana;  many  of  my  not  so  successful  family
members do; makes the decision easy.
Applicant provided additional details regarding his marijuana use during his May
2018 interview with a DOD investigator. (Item 10 at 2) He disclosed he used marijuana
for the first time in the spring of 2012. He smoked it socially with a friend who provided it
in the form of a “bong.” He continued to smoke marijuana through December 2016 with
the same friend. They smoked it about once a month at his friend’s house. He disclosed
that  using  marijuana  made  him  laugh  and  feel  happy.  He  stated  he  stopped  using
marijuana because he desired to find a good job and to have a good career. He shared
that he witnessed relatives unable to have good careers because of marijuana use. He
stated he would not use marijuana in the future. (Item 10 at 2)
Applicant  became  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information  in  July  2018,
following  the  DOD  CAS’s  favorable  adjudication  of  his  SCA.  He  was  granted  a  DOD
security  clearance  on  July  14,  2018,  and  signed  a  DOD non-disclosure  agreement  on
July 27, 2018. (Item 5) He disclosed he was submitted for a top-secret security clearance
in February 2022. (Item AE-A at 1)
Applicant  completed  a  second  SCA  in  February  2022,  sponsored  by  the  same
defense contractor. (AE-A at 1; and Item 9 at 5) He disclosed he used marijuana starting
in August 2012 and continuing through July 2021. (Item 3 at 25 through 26). When asked
whether he used marijuana while possessing a security clearance, he responded “yes.”
When asked whether he intended to use marijuana in the future, he responded “yes,” and
explained:
Possibly  in  social  settings,  but  not  worth  the  ordeal  to  purchase  and
consume at my home. If legalized it is much more likely.
In  his  March  2022  interview  with  a  DOD  investigator,  Applicant  disclosed  he
smoked marijuana in cigar form, from about August 2012 through about July 2021. While
in college from August 2012 through May 2017, he stated he smoked marijuana with a
friend socially about twice a month. After college from May 2017 through July 2021, he
stated he smoked marijuana about twice a year. He also admitted he smoked marijuana
while possessing a security clearance. He stated he smoked marijuana with a friend who
supplied it, asserting he never purchased it.
Applicant has maintained close in-person contact with the same friend. He stated
he stopped smoking marijuana because he could not smoke it legally, but he intends to
use marijuana in the future because he enjoyed it. He stated he experienced no negative
consequences as a result of using marijuana, and denied being dependent on it. He never
tested positive for marijuana use; nor has he been ordered to attend drug-related classes.
(Item 9 at 5-6)
In his January 2023 response to the SOR, Applicant, for the first time, asserted he
used the Delta-8 THC products “beginning during the pandemic lockdown and periodically
afterwards in social settings . . . .” (Item 2. See also Items 2, and AE-A compared to Items
3,  4,  9,  and  10)  Delta-8  THC  products  are  not  considered  federally  illegal  under  the
Controlled Substances Act if it is determined to contain less than 0.3% delta-9 THC, the
psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. (Items 6 through 8) He previously stated in his 2018
and 2022 DOD interviews, that his friend or friends provided the marijuana he used, and
that he never purchased it. (Items 9 and 10).
In  April  2023,  Applicant  submitted  a  document  in  evidence  in  response  to  this
FORM, Item AE-A. He stated he no longer intended to use marijuana in the future, and
referenced comments he made in his response to the SOR. (Item AE-A at 2) He stated
he is in a serious romantic relationship that he hopes will lead to marriage, and because
of this, he wished to amend his claim that he would use marijuana in the future if it were
legalized.  He  stated  he  “does  not  plan  to  use  marijuana  illegally  again  since  ceasing
usage (in) prior to graduating college in 2017.” (Item AE-A at 2) He commented as follows:
[He] has not used Delta-8 THC products since July 2021 when he learned
that this was a substance prohibited under DoD Guidelines. This fact was
stated  in  [his]  reply  to  the  SOR  but  was  seemingly  misconstrued  by  the
investigator.  [He]  only  used  Delta-8  THC  a  few  times  –  maybe  twice  per
month at most – from the summer of 2020 through July 2021.
For SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant admitted to using marijuana, from August 2012 to July
2021, but qualified his admission, stating “… usage after roughly 2014 (beginning around
the  middle  of  2020)  would  be  limited  to  the  federally  legal  Delta-8  THC  [marijuana]
products.”  (Item  2) As stated  above,  this is the  first time  Applicant has  claimed  to  use
Delta-8 THC products. (See Items 2, 3, 4,9, 10, and AE-A)
For  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c,  Applicant  denied  the  allegations,  reiterating  he  used
federally  legal  “Delta-8  THC  products”  beginning  during  the  pandemic,  and  socially
afterwards.
For SOR ¶ 1.d, Applicant denied his intention to use marijuana in the future. He
sought to clarify previous statements he made, emphasizing that he would use marijuana
in the future “if legal,” stating he had no current plans to use marijuana in the immediate
future. (Item 2) Applicant previously disclosed his intention to use marijuana in the future
in his February 2022 SCA, and his March 2022 interview with a DOD investigator. (Items
4 and 9)

master’s degree. Since May 2010, he has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item
3.)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant:  (1)  used  marijuana  with
varying  frequency  from  April  1997  to  about  April  2023;  (In  the  FORM,  Department
Counsel amended the SOR to delete this first allegation in its entirety.) (2) used marijuana
from  March  2019  to  about  April  2023  while  granted  eligibility  to  access  classified  or
sensitive information; (3) intends to continue to use marijuana in the future; (4) purchased
and  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  with  varying  frequency  from  about  July  2021  to
about July 2022; (5) used hallucinogenic mushrooms while granted eligibility to access
classified  or  sensitive  information;  and  (6)  intends  to  continue  to  use  hallucinogenic
mushrooms in the future. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted all Guideline H allegations. (Item
2.)
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on a July
19, 2018 public trust application by failing to disclose his marijuana and mushroom use
under circumstances  described above.  (Item 1.)  There  is no July 19,  2018  public trust
application in the record. The only other application in the record is dated April 18, 2019
(the 2019 Application). (Item 4.) He denied this allegation and observed that he disclosed
his marijuana use from May 1998 to April 2019 in his April 18, 2019 application. (Item 2,
citing  Item  4  §  23.)  In his Response,  he  said  that he  did not  have a  copy  of  the  2018
Application and reiterated his denials.
The 2022 Application Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse disclosures. (Item
3 §23.)
Applicant  disclosed  that  he  used  marijuana  from  May  1998  to  September  2022
about 10 to 15 times per month, “always outside of any work activities.” He stated that he
“used marijuana while [he] previously had the Public Trust clearance that [he is] applying
for again.” As to future  use, he  said:  “Used  as an occasional stress reliever. It is more
effective and with fewer side effects than other substances, such as alcohol.”
Applicant disclosed that he used hallucinogenic  mushrooms in July 2021 and July
2022 “3 times (across 3 different days).” As to future use, he said: “I found the experience
very pleasant and it wears off in a couple  of hours, much more easily to manage than
drinking  alcohol.  I  will  likely  do  it  again  in  the  future,  but  would  not  make  it  a  regular
activity.”
The 2019 Application Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse disclosures. (Item
4 §23.)
Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana from May 1998 to April 2019 and said:
“Occasional  marijuana  use,  on  nights  or  weekends,  never  in  conjunction  with  work
activities. Frequency: 5-10 times per year, not consistently. Number of times used: 50.”
As to future use, he said: “Used as an occasional stress reliever. It is more effective and
with  fewer  side  effects  than  other  substances,  such  as  alcohol.”  There  were  no
disclosures of any other drug involvement or substance misuse.
Applicant’s responses to interrogatories and his January 11, 2023 personal subject
interview (PSI) were consistent  with  the responses  in his 2022 and  2019 Applications,
with one notable exception. The interrogatories asked: “When, if ever, did you decide to
stop using illegal substances (list the substance and date of last use)?” He responded: “I
have  not  decided  to  stop  marijuana  or  mushrooms  at  this  time.”  That  response  was
verified  on  April  10,  2023.  In  his  January  11,  2023  PSI,  he  was  asked:  “[If]  he  would
discontinue use of the above drugs [marijuana and mushrooms] if it was required for a
favorable clearance adjudication,  which  he  replied  yes.”  His  PSI  was  also  verified  on
April 10, 2023. (Item 5.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  public  trust  position.  As  the
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability  for  a  public  trust  position,  an
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are
flexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the
whole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  The  protection  of  the  national  security  is  the  paramount  consideration.  AG  ¶
2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, then the applicant is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..” The applicant
has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.
Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
Under  this  guideline,  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be  questioned  or  put  into
question a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG
¶ 24 sets forth the concern, as follows:
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription
and  non-prescription  drugs,  and  the  use  of  other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their
intended  purpose  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual's  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior  may  lead  to  physical  or
psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises  questions  about  a  person's
ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  Controlled
substance means any ""controlled substance""  as defined  in 21  U.S.C.§  802.
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any
of the behaviors listed above.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions or factors:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);
AG ¶  25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . .
AG ¶  25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information
or holding a sensitive position; and
AG ¶  25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance
abuse,  or  failure  to  clearly  and  convincingly  commit  to  discontinue  such
misuse.
The only potentially applicable mitigating factor here is quoted below:
AG  ¶   26(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment.
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated
by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. § 811 et seq.
The knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is  unlawful and
punishable  by  imprisonment,  a  fine  or  both. 21  U.S.C.  §  844.  In  an  October  25,  2014
memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is
a security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum:
Adherence  to  Federal  Laws  Prohibiting  Marijuana  Use  (October  25,  2014).  See  also
http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml
More recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed
the memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana
for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal
law  remains  unchanged  with  respect  to  the  illegal  use,  possession,  production  and
distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position
are  prohibited  by  law  from  using  controlled  substances.  Disregard  of  federal  law
pertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal, or recreational marijuana use) remains
relevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use
the “whole-person concept” stated under SEAD 4, to  determine whether the applicant’s
behavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.
Hallucinogenic mushrooms are Schedule I controlled substances under 21 U.S.C.
.§ 812 (c).
Applicant admitted using marijuana with varying frequency from about May 1998
to September 2022. He admitted to using marijuana from March 2019 to April 2023 while
holding a position of public trust. In 2019, his frequency of use was 5 to 10 times per year.
In 2022, that frequency had increased dramatically to 10 to 15 times per month. He used
mushrooms about three times in July 2021 and July 2022, also while holding a position
of public trust. He was inconsistent about future drug use if his clearance was at stake,
because  he  said  unequivocally  that  he  had  no  plans  to  stop  using  those  controlled
substances.
Facts admitted by an applicant in an application, an answer to an SOR, or in an
interview  require  no  further  proof  from  the  Government.  ISCR  Case  No.  94-1159  at  4
(App.  Bd.  Dec.  4,  1995).  Applicant’s  years  of  past  use  of  marijuana,  his  recent  use  of
mushrooms,  and  his  intent  to  keep  using  them  trigger  disqualifying  conditions  AG  ¶¶
25(a), (c), (f), and (g).
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(a). On this record, Applicant began
using marijuana 25  years ago. Therefore, the inception of his use was long ago. Applicant
has,  however,  continued  his  regular,  and  not  infrequent,  use  of  marijuana.  In  fact,  the
frequency  of  his  use  has  increased  significantly  between  2019  and  2022.  And  he  has
added mushrooms to his menu of controlled substances. His history of drug involvement
and substance misuse shows an inability and certainly an unwillingness to comply with
federal  law  and  casts  doubt  on  his  trustworthiness  and  reliability.  Applicant’s  use  of
controlled substances is not mitigated by AG ¶ 26(a).
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
The SOR alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on a July 19, 2018  public
trust application by failing to disclose his marijuana and mushroom use. There is no July
19,  2018  public  trust  application  in  the  record.  Therefore,  the  Government  has  not
established SOR ¶ 2. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR ¶ 2.
Whole-Person Concept
The  record  raises  doubt  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  judgment,
and  ability  to  protect  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept. AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not
met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to sensitive information.
As required  by section  E3.1.25  of Enclosure  3  of the  Directive,  I make  the  following
formal findings on the  SOR allegations:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H:
AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph  1.a:
Withdrawn
Subparagraphs 1.b-1.f:
Against Applicant
Paragraph  2, Guideline E:
FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraph  2.a:
For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant access to sensitive information.

"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR. His admissions are incorporated
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony,
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He attended college at various times from 1990 to 2005
but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  married  in  2014  and  has  a  stepchild.  He  has  two  adult
children from previous relationships. He has worked for his present employer, a federal
contractor, since 2018. (Tr. 16-20)
Applicant was arrested in April 1992 and charged with robbery and conspiracy to
commit robbery, both felonies. He testified he was in college and he and a group of friends
decided to order a pizza and then steal the pizza from the delivery person and not pay.
He was with the group when two people stole the pizza and beverages and they all ran
away. Applicant ran and did not get caught but later turned himself in. He admitted it was
a dumb college stunt. He participated in a pretrial diversion program. He was required to
perform community service, pay a fine, and was on probation. He successfully completed
the  program  and  in  1996  the  charge  was  dismissed.  Applicant  did  not  disclose  these
felony charges on his January 2019 security clearance application (SCA) as was required.
He testified he was aware the charge was a felony and serious. His explanation for failing
to disclose it was he marked “no” in error. He did not know why he would mark “no” and
said he did not intentionally falsify his SCA. (Tr. 23-31; GE 1, 2, 14)
In  December  1993,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  simple  assault-physical  menace.
He pleaded not guilty and was found not guilty. He could not recall this arrest or any of
the facts. (Tr. 30-31; GE 5)
In  October  1994,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  obstructing  highways/other  public
passages. He explained that he grew up in a tough neighborhood and the police were
doing a lot of sweeps in the street. He explained that if you were outside, you would get
swept  up.  and  go  to  jail.  He  was  home  from  college  and  was  with  friends  and  was
arrested. A warrant was issued in 2007 for failing to appear for this charge. He testified
he  was  unaware  of  the  notice  to  appear  because  he  likely  went  back  to  school.  The
charge was dismissed in 2008 but Applicant does not recall the situation. (Tr. 31-34; GE
2, 6)
In July 1996, Applicant was arrested for alcohol in public, bad check, and failure to
appear.  During  his  background  investigation  he  told  the  investigator  he  had  written  a
check and intended to put money in his account to cover the amount, but he had a serious
motorcycle accident and spent three months in the hospital. When he was notified about
the bad check, he went and paid it. He said this was a separate incident from the alcohol
in public charge. He stated he was probably loitering when the police came, and he likely
had a bottle in his hand. He pleaded guilty to the alcohol in public charge. Regarding the
failure to appear charge, he said he likely did not show up in court for a previous charge.
(Tr. 35-39; GE 2, 7)
In May 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled
dangerous substance, less than 50 grams of marijuana, 5 grams of hashish. He explained
he was arrested the day after his birthday. A friend had given him some marijuana as a
present, and he was stopped by the police. He had been consuming alcohol but did not
recall how much. He was searched and forgot he had the marijuana in his pocket. When
he went to court, he said the judge was angry at the prosecutor because he or she had
made an error and did not have the required original documents to prosecute the case.
The judge dismissed the charge and told Applicant it was his lucky day, and he should
buy a lottery ticket. (Tr. 39-43; GE 8)
In  response  to  questions on  his SCA that asked  if Applicant  had  ever been  charged
with  an  offense  involving alcohol or  drugs, Applicant  responded  “no.” He testified  that  he
was  not  convicted   but   he   was   charged   so   did  not   disclose   it.   He   said   he   may   have
interpreted the  question incorrectly.  (Tr. 43-44; GE 1)
In  June  2007,  Applicant  was  charged  with  public  drinking  alcohol  prohibited.
Applicant  testified  that  this  arrest  occurred  during  one  of  the  police  sweeps  of  his
neighborhood. He and friends were drinking outside a house that was close to a liquor
store. He pleaded guilty to the offense. He believed he was required to pay a fine. (Tr.
44-46; GE 2, 9)
In   June   2012,   Applicant  was  charged   with   driving   on   a   suspended
license/registration  suspended/revoked. He testified  his license  was suspended  because
of unpaid parking  tickets.  He went to  pay the  tickets and  learned  the  tickets  belonged  to
his father who  had  a  vehicle  registered  in  Applicant’s name  and  did  not pay the  tickets.
His father had moved. Applicant paid the  tickets,  and his license  was reinstated. (Tr. 46-
47;  GE 12)
In  March  2013,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  on  a  suspected
license/registration  suspended/revoked.  Applicant  testified  he  pleaded  not  guilty  to  the
charge, and it was dismissed. He stated he did not recall if his license was suspended.
When completing his SCA, it asked if Applicant had been issued a summons, citation, or
ticket  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal  proceeding  against  him.  He  responded  “no.”  He
testified  that  he  did  not  know  why  he  responded  ‘no”  and  did  not  disclose  the  2013
suspended license ticket. (Tr. 47-48; GE 1, 10)
In December 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating under the
influence  of  liquor  or  drugs  and  operation  of  a  motor  vehicle  while  in  possession  of
narcotics. Applicant testified that he was intoxicated and was pulled over by the police for
failure to maintain his lane. The police searched him and found a bag of marijuana on
him.  He  was  found  guilty  of  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  or  drugs  (DUI).  His
driver’s license was suspended. He was required to attend a 20-hour alcohol information
course. This was the first time he attended an alcohol information course. (Tr. 48-52; GE
11)
In August 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and driving while
license suspended or revoked. Applicant testified that he was drinking alcohol with friends
at a bar. He and his friend left, and Applicant was following his friend in his car to another
location. He was stopped by the police. He said he was unaware that his driver’s license
was  suspended  when  he  was  stopped.  He  learned  he  had  not  completed  the
requirements for reinstatement of his suspended license that was issued by another state.
He  said  he  took  care  of  the  requirements.  He  spent  a  couple  of  days  in  jail.  He  was
convicted  of  DUI.  He  was  ordered  to  take  two  alcohol  courses  that  required  weekly
attendance.  He  testified  he  did  not  have  a  problem  with  alcohol,  but  rather  he  had  a
problem with driving after he had consumed alcohol. (Tr. 52-56 73-74; GE 2, 14)
In November 2019, Applicant was charged with simple assault-family violence. He
was  ordered  to  attend  a  24-week  anger management  course.  He  and  his wife  had  an
argument,  and  he  tossed  a  purse  across  the  room  and  the  strap  hit  her  leg.  She  felt
threatened, called the police, and then hung up. The police arrived and he was arrested.
He  admitted  he  had  consumed  a  couple  of  beers  at  the  time.  His  wife  contacted  the
prosecutor saying she regretted her actions. Applicant’s case was nolle prosequi under a
pretrial diversion program after he completed an anger management course. (Tr. 56-58;
GE 2, 4)
In  his  March  2019  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  He
confirmed the accuracy of a summary of his interview in September 2020. Applicant told
the government investigator that he drinks one beer a day and four on the weekends. He
said he does not drink and drive and instead uses an UBER for transportation. He also
said that there was a zero-chance alcohol would have a negative impact on his life in the
future. At his hearing, he said he obviously did not adhere to that promise. (Tr. 74-75; GE
2)
Applicant was asked by the government investigator about his criminal record and
if he was ever charged with a felony, been convicted of domestic violence, or charged
with an offense involving a firearm, alcohol, or drugs and he responded “no, only the DUI
charges.”  Only  upon  being  confronted  with  the  2007  criminal  charge  of  possession  of
marijuana did he admit the offense. He did not disclose the felony robbery arrest in 1992;
the  1993  simple  assault  arrest;  the  1994  obstructing  a  public  highway;  the  1996
possession of marijuana; the 2007 public consumption of alcohol; and the 2013 driving
with a suspended/revoked license arrest. These arrests were not disclosed or discussed
during his March 2019 interview. (GE 2)
In January 2020, Applicant was interviewed again by a government investigator.
He was asked if he had been arrested, charged with, convicted of, or sentenced for a
crime,  or  received  a  summons,  citation,  or  ticket  to  appear  in  court,  or  has  been  on
probation or parole. He said “yes” and said he had previously discussed all of his criminal
activity during his March 2019 interview.  That interview included his three DUI arrests,
and the 2007 criminal charge of possession of marijuana, but did not include disclosure
of the felony robbery arrest in 1992, the 1993 simple assault arrest; the 1994 obstructing
a  public  highway  arrest;  the  1996  possession  of  marijuana  arrest;  the  2007  public
consumption of alcohol; and the 2013 driving with a suspended/revoked license arrest.
When he was asked by the investigator if he had any additional criminal activity to report,
he said “no.” He did not disclose the above arrests. (GE 2)
In December 2021, Applicant was arrested for DUI, possession of an open alcohol
container and defective tires. He testified that he was going home, and his tire blew out.
He  pulled  over  and  put  on  his  emergency  flashers.  The  police  stopped  to  assist  and
smelled alcohol on his breath.  He  said he  had  consumed two  to  three  drinks.  He  was
arrested. He said the alcohol containers found in the trunk of his car were not from that
night and were trash. He was found guilty and sentenced in October 2022. He received
credit for the time he served in jail, which was about five days and a 90-day jail sentence
that was suspended. He was required to go to DUI school and be evaluated. He testified
he did not receive a diagnosis from the evaluation. He is also required to take another
course on drugs. He said he is currently registering for the course. He received a fine of
$2,600 that he pays in installments. He is required to complete 120 hours of community
service. He has completed about 28 hours. He was required to wear an ankle bracelet for
three months in 2022 that detects alcohol consumption. He is no longer required to wear
the bracelet. When he completes the drug course, he can have his license reinstated on
a restricted basis to drive to and from work. He is required to have an interlock installed
on his car. He is on probation until October 2024. He is to abstain from alcohol while on
probation.  He  meets  with  his  probation  officer  monthly.  He  is  required  to  abide  by  the
terms of his probation. He testified that he has not consumed alcohol while on probation.
(Tr. 59-72; GE 3, 13)
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  from  1990  to  2016  and
wrote, “recreational occasional 5.” He testified that he does not know what he meant by
“recreational occasional 5.” During his background interview he told the investigator that
he  used  marijuana  three  times  a  month.  At  his  hearing,  he  said  he  did  not  know  how
accurate that statement was. He admitted that he has used marijuana since completing
his January 2019 SCA. He was asked when his last use was, and he said he consumed
an edible marijuana in 2021 and another time in 2022. He also acknowledged he was on
probation when he consumed the edible marijuana in 2022. He consumed it while at a
family  reunion.  He  said  he  no  longer  smokes  marijuana.  It  is  unknown  if  his  use  of
marijuana is a violation of the terms of his probation. (Tr. 75-82; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  told  the  government  investigator  that  he  continued  to  associate  with
people who use illegal drugs. At his hearing, he testified that he now tries not to associate
with people who use drugs. (Tr. 80-82; GE 2)
Applicant  was  asked  at  his  hearing  why  he  failed  to  disclose  his  felony  arrest,
domestic  violence  arrest,  alcohol  arrests  and  drug  arrests.  He  denied  he  intentionally
falsified his SCA. He said he did not remember a lot of his past. He said he did not have
any  idea  why  he  did  not  disclose  them  on  his  SCA  or  when  he  was  questioned  by  a
government investigator. He said at the time he did not recall certain offenses. He said
he was not trying to hide anything from the government. (Tr. 82-84)
Applicant testified that he has regrets his past, and he wants to move on. He is
remorseful for his past conduct. He has had personal issues that he has taken care of.
He stated that if it is determined that he needs additional treatment he will follow through.
He believes the anger management class he completed has helped his marriage. (Tr. 21,
84-85)

"Applicant is a 37-year-old aircraft painter with a defense contractor (Company A).
She has worked for Company A since March 2022. She is single and has a bachelor of
fine arts degree. This is her first application for a security clearance and the first time she
has worked for a defense contractor. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and
25; Tr. 15-17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because she has used illegal drugs. She admitted all the allegations under this paragraph
with explanations.
1.a  and  1.c. Applicant used marijuana in edible form between about 2008 and June
2022. She would use it as a sleeping aid and to help with anxiety. From 2008 through
2020 she used it about ten times. Her use increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. She
would purchase it from dispensaries between 2020 and 2021. Such purchases are legal
in the state where Applicant resides (State One). She stopped using marijuana in January
2022, before her employment began with Company A. Soon after her employment began,
she came down with Covid-19. She admits that she used marijuana edibles twice in June
2022 to attempt to sleep and recover from Covid. She understands that her conduct was
foolish and has repeatedly stated that she has no intent to use marijuana in the future.
(Answer; Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23; Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 14-26.)
1.c. Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms on an infrequent basis while hiking
with friends between 2020 and August 2021, before she began working for Company A.
She no longer uses mushrooms on hikes and does not intend to use them in the future.
(Tr. 28-30.)
1.d.  Applicant  states  that  she  is  a  rule  follower,  understands  the  proscription
against marijuana and mushroom use while holding a security clearance, and has evinced
a  credible  intent  not  to  use  any  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  She  submitted  a  signed
statement of intent stating that the future use of illegal drugs is grounds for revocation of
her security clearance. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 26-28.)
Mitigation
Applicant is a  successful  performer as  shown  in her initial year-end  review. Her
supervisor  states,  “[Applicant]  has  good   values  and   a   high   work  ethic,  and   she
understands  and   adheres  to   company  standards,   conduct  policies  and   procedures.
[Applicant]  demonstrates a  great can-do  attitude  and  drive  to  be  a  key player and  bring
more value  to  the  . . . team.” (Applicant Exhibit B.)

and she does not have any children. She graduated from high school in 2003. She has
also received several technical certifications. She has owned her home since July 2019.
As of the date of the hearing and since November 2022, she has worked as a business
analyst  for her employer,  a  DOD contractor. She has  never held  a security  clearance.

Applicant lived in state A for 25 years until July 2019, when she moved to state B,
where  she  currently  resides.  She  has  been  taking  medication  prescribed  by  her
neurologist  for  epilepsy  since  2013.  In  2015,  she  realized  she  was  experiencing
depression symptoms and she sought the care of a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her with
depression. Under her psychiatrist’s care, she took the maximum dose of a prescribed
medication to manage her depression symptoms. Although she  felt “somewhat better,”
her symptoms persisted. She consulted with her psychiatrist, who then wanted to switch
her to a different medication. After researching online its possible detrimental side effects
on her health and the potential that it would make her depression worse, she elected not
to  switch  her  medication.  She  stated,  “that  was  the  only  treatment  option  that  my
psychiatrist offered me,” and she did not discuss with her psychiatrist the possibility of a
different treatment option or seek a second opinion. (Tr. at 13-14, 17-29, 30-32, 34, 46,
49, 52-53; GE 1-3; AE B, C)
Applicant  researched  the  therapeutic  benefits  about  the  use  of  psilocybin
mushrooms, a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, to treat her
persistent depression, and she decided to try it. She did not consult with her doctors about
whether it would have an adverse effect on her prescribed medications. She purchased
psilocybin  mushrooms  from  an  individual  who  grew  it,  whom  she  met  through  an
acquaintance. She orally consumed four grams on five occasions between August 2018
and April 2019, at her home, to self-treat her depression. (SOR ¶ 1.a) This was the first
time she used illegal drugs, and she has not used any illegal drugs since then. She did
not  inform  her  psychiatrist  that  she  was  self-medicating.  She  found  that  her  use  of
psilocybin  mushrooms  significantly  alleviated  her  symptoms,  and  she  stopped  taking
them because she felt better.  During this period,  she  continued  to take her prescribed
medications. When she moved to state B, her new psychiatrist reduced the amount of her
prescribed medication, and she has found this dosage effective. Her spouse is aware of
her use of psilocybin mushrooms. (Tr. at 13-14, 17-29, 30-32, 34-36, 39, 46-51, 53-54,
56; GE 1-3; AE B, C)
Applicant  disclosed  information  about  her  use  of  psilocybin  mushrooms  on  her
November  2020  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  and  during  her  March  2021
background  interview.  She  stated  on  her  SCA  and  indicated  during  her  background
interview that she intended to continue to use psilocybin mushrooms in the future if her
symptoms returned. (SOR ¶ 1.b) At the hearing, she clarified that she meant she would
consider using it under the care of her psychiatrist if it was legalized under federal and
state law. (Tr. at 13-14, 17-32, 36-40, 55-57; GE 1-3; AE B, C)
Applicant is committed to seeking professional help with treating her depression in
the future. Unlike her psychiatrist in state A, her psychiatrist in state B discussed with her
other treatment options that they could explore should her symptoms return or worsen.
She sees her psychiatrist and neurologist once every six months. She also has hobbies,
to include yoga, gardening, and hiking, to help her cope with her depression. She stated
that she does not socialize with anyone involved with drugs. If she were to find herself in
a situation where illegal drugs are being used, she would leave. She intends to abide by
her employer’s policy against using illegal drugs. In April 2023, she signed a statement of
intent to refrain from using any illegal substances, or abusing any legal substance, and
that any violation would result in her losing her security clearance. (Tr. at 27-31, 39-41,

"In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  without  comment,  the  single
allegation of drug involvement (SOR ¶ 1.a). His admission is incorporated in my findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  systems  engineering  manager  sponsored  by  a
successive  defense  contractor  since  January  2021.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in
June 1992, and subsequently enrolled in a full-time university program of study in August
1992. He completed the program in May 1996 and was awarded a bachelor’s degree. He
continued his education in August 1998 and was awarded a master’s degree in May 2004.
Applicant married in November 2003, and divorced in about April 2007. He does not have
children. (Items 2 and 3)
Applicant disclosed he first used marijuana in high school in May 1991, and that
he  continued  to  use  it  casually  through  about  1995.  (Item  4  at  3)  In  August  1995,  he
disclosed  he  was  criminally  charged  with  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia.  After
admitting responsibility and satisfying program requirements, he successfully completed
probation before judgment, a pretrial diversion program. He stated the charge was later
expunged from his record. (Item 2 at 45, and Item 4 at 3) Applicant’s drug involvement in
1995 is not alleged in the SOR.
In  about  April  2011,  Applicant  completed  his  first  application  for  a  public  trust
position. He was granted eligibility for access to sensitive information about a month later.
He  subsequently  submitted  an  SCA  in  April  2018,  seeking  eligibility  for  access  to
classified information. Applicant stated in his 2021 SCA, that he was granted eligibility for
access to top-secret information during the same month. (Item 2 at 50)
In  his  September  2021  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  he  purchased  and  used
marijuana from about July 2021 through August 2021. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He explained that he
sustained  a “debilitating  back injury” and  decided to use marijuana to help alleviate his
sciatic nerve pain. He purchased the marijuana he used in the  form of edibles, from a
local  dispensary.  He  stated  he  ingested  it  about  three  to  five  times  during  this  period.
(Item 2 at 47-48; and Item 3 at 5)
Applicant stated he also sought medical treatment through a chiropractor, and that
after a few weeks of rehabilitation and after purchasing a new mattress, he stopped using
marijuana in about August 2021. He has not received drug counseling or treatment, and
he stated he does not socialize or associate with any person who uses drugs illegally.
(Item 2 at 47-48; and Item 3 at 5)
In his September 2021 SCA, Applicant responded “yes” to the question of whether
he used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. (Item 2 at 48) (SOR ¶ 1.a, in
part) Notwithstanding this disclosure, there is no independent evidence in the record to
establish he was “granted access to classified information” when he used marijuana from
July 2021 through August 2021, as alleged. Applicant also acknowledged understating at
the  time  he  purchased  and  used  marijuana,  that  marijuana  remains  a  federally  illegal
controlled substance.
Applicant stated his intention to refrain from using marijuana or any illegal drugs in
the  future  in  his  September  2021  SCA,  and  later  signed  a  similar  sworn  statement  in
February 2023. (Item 2 at 48, and Item 4 at 4)

application (SCA) in support of his prospective employment with a government contractor.
He was eventually hired by the government contractor in a quality control position. (Items

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The SOR alleges  under Guideline H that Applicant  used marijuana with varying
frequency  from  April  1992  to  about  January  2022.  (SOR  ¶  1.a.)  His  use  of  marijuana
continued for 30 years until shortly before he completed his SCA. (Items 1, 3 and 4)
Applicant  disclosed  on  the  February  2022  SCA  that  he  had  used  marijuana
between April 1992 and January 2022, “use as needed for [back] pain.” When responding
to the SCA’s inquiry as to his intentions for future use of an illegal drug, he listed that he
intended to use marijuana, as needed for his back pain, and while “not working.” (Item 4)
Applicant  was  interviewed  on  April  5,  2022  by  an  authorized  DOD  investigator.
Applicant admitted that he had used psilocybin mushrooms and LSD on two occasions
between  September  1990  and  September  2015,  which  is  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.
Applicant also admitted he used marijuana at home. He obtained the marijuana from his
friend. He last used marijuana in January 2022, and his motivation for using marijuana
was to relieve his back pain. He acknowledged he did not have a medical prescription to
use marijuana. He has  never had any involvement with  law enforcement for his illegal
drug use, and he has never received treatment, or been diagnosed with a substance use
disorder. He told the investigator that he is “unlikely” to use marijuana again since he is
no longer motivated or interested in using it. (Item 5)

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted all the allegations under Guidelines J, G, and
H,  in  the  SOR  with  some  explanation.  He  failed  to  address  the  allegations  under
Guideline  E,  which  are  cross  allegations  previously  alleged.  I  will  adopt  Applicant’s
admissions  to  the  cross-alleged  allegations  as  his  response  to  the  Guideline  E
allegations as well. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional

U.S.  Marine   Corps   from   approximately   2015   to   2019   when   he   was  administratively
separated   with   a   general  discharge   as  further  explained,   infra.  He   has  worked   for   a

is a high  school graduate  and has taken some college courses.  (Tr. 6, 25-27; GE  1)
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged in January 2021, with
illegal discharge of a firearm, intoxication, and with carrying a dangerous firearm under
the influence of alcohol. He entered a plea in abeyance agreement and was sentenced
to pay fines and fees, and a term of 12 months’ probation. He was required to abstain
from  alcohol  consumption  during  his  probation.  In  about  September  2018,  Applicant,
while  serving  in  the  Marine  Corps,  was  charged  with  wrongful  use  of  controlled
substances  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ).  As  a  result  of  this
investigation, he was administratively separated from the Marine Corps and received a
general discharge. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b)
Under Guideline G, the SOR alleged Applicant was required to attend an alcohol
education  class  in  March  2019.  It  also  cross-alleged  the  firearm-alcohol  arrest  from
January 2021. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.b)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  steroids  from  September
2016  to  April  2017,  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  It  also  cross-alleged  the
September 2018 UCMJ offense. (SOR ¶¶ 3.a-3.b)
Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the allegations from SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
and 3.a. (SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.c)
Criminal Conduct.
Applicant  testified that he was using steroids  while on active duty in  the Marine
Corps  for  about  six  weeks  in  2016-2017.  He  testified  that  he  had  access  to  classified
information  at  the  time  of  his  use.  He  admitted  in  his  August  2020  security  clearance
application  (SCA)  that  he  used  steroids  from  September  2016  to  April  2017.  He
obtained  the  steroids  from  another  Marine.  He  claimed  that  he  began  using  steroids
because  he  was  concerned  about  being  able  to  meet  the  required  physical  fitness
standards of the Marine Corps. He also received advice from former Marines whom he
considered mentors. They recommended using steroids. He stated that he has not used
steroids since this time frame. (Tr. 24-25, 31, 33-35, 40; GE 1)
While  Applicant  was  investigated  and  interviewed  by  the  Naval  Criminal
Investigative  Service  (NCIS)  for  his  steroid  involvement,  there  is  no  evidence  that  he
was charged under the UCMJ. He admitted receiving an administrative discharge with a
general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions  characterization  related  to  his  steroid
involvement. (Tr. 25; GE 1, 4)
Alcohol Consumption.
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  NCIS  regarding  his  steroid  abuse,  he  also
admitted  drinking  approximately  10  beers  the  previous  weekend  at  a  housewarming
party. This information was related to Applicant’s command who ordered him to attend
alcohol-education classes. Applicant attended the classes. (GE 2; Answer to SOR).
The  second  alcohol-related  allegation  involves  Applicant’s  criminal  arrest  in
January 2021. He stated that he and his family were at a friend’s apartment complex to
celebrate New Year’s Eve. The apartment complex was in a residential area. There was
a  vacant  field  close to the apartment  complex  that  Applicant described  as about  three
miles long. He and his friend had been drinking alcohol that evening. At approximately
midnight, Applicant and his friend fired a small caliber rifle into the air three to four times
to celebrate the new year. A neighbor called the police and Applicant was cited for gun
and alcohol violations, upon which he later entered a plea agreement, supra. (Tr. 36-37;
GE 1-3, 6-7)
Drug  Involvement and Substance Misuse.
As  stated  supra,  Applicant  admitted  illegal  steroid  use  sometime  between
September 2016 and April 2017. He was an active-duty Marine then and had access to
classified information. His use, while a Marine, resulted in his administrative discharge
with a general discharge. He stopped using steroids in 2017. (Tr. 24-25, 31, 33, 35; GE

Personal Conduct.
The  factual  background  for  the  personal  conduct  allegations  have  been
previously described and will not be repeated here.
Applicant’s Mitigation.
Applicant  presented  his  2021  year-end  performance  review  and  his  2022
midpoint review. He is described as an effective team player. He makes an outstanding
contribution to the team’s productivity. He documented that he complied with the terms
of his probation and his 2021 gun and alcohol charges were dismissed. He testified that
he has had no further involvement with law enforcement since his January 2021 arrest.

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - 1.d  and  provided  additional  comments  in  her
response to the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  contractor.  She  is divorced  and  has  no  children.  She
earned  her  bachelor’s  degree  in  2009.  She  has  been  employed  as  a  contractor  since
2017. (GE 1 at 5-23, Tr. 29-31)
Applicant works as a senior copy-writing supervisor. In that position, she works on
projects  that  help  military  members  and  families  find  resources  to  assist  them.  She  is
motivated and passionate about her work. (GE 1 at 13-14, AE G & J, Tr. 23-28, 31-32)
The allegations in the SOR concern Applicant’s long-term use of marijuana from
about October 2006 to about January 2022 and intent to continue use (SOR ¶ 1.a); her
purchase of marijuana from about October 2007 to about October 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.b); her
use of cocaine and hallucinogenic mushrooms during about February 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.c);
and  her  misuse  of  the  prescription  drug  codeine  from  about  March  2013  to  about
December 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.d). She admitted all four of the allegations. (SOR Answer)
In  her  SCA,  SOR  response,  subject  interview,  and  her  testimony,  Applicant
admitted using marijuana since about October 2007. She began using it as a teenager
and  has  found  it  improves  her mood.  She  experienced  depression  in  high  school  and
turned to marijuana and alcohol to self-medicate. A mental health professional eventually
proscribed anti-depressants which she found to be effective. She has been open with her
therapist and primary care physician regarding her marijuana use and neither expressed
concern. Upon legalization in her state, she obtained a medical prescription for marijuana
and vapes it. She stated her prescription marijuana helps her to feel relaxed, optimistic,
and peaceful. She last used marijuana the morning of the hearing. (SOR Answer, GE 1
at 41-45, GE 2 at 3-4, Tr. 34-44)
Applicant  knows  the  use  of  marijuana  violates  federal  law,  even  when  legally
prescribed  under  state  law,  but  she  intends  to  continue  to  use  it.  She  considers  it  an
effective  medical  treatment  for  her  depression.  She  stated  her  employer  has  a  policy
against the use of illegal drugs. She stated her employer occasionally requires urinalysis
and that though she would expect to test positive for marijuana metabolite, she was not
overly concerned. (SOR Answer, GE 1 at 41-44, GE 2 at 3-4, Tr. 14, 47)
Applicant stated prior to her state legalizing marijuana for medical purposes, she
would purchase it on various occasions for personal use from friends or friends of friends.
She would occasionally sell small amounts to friends. On average, she purchased a few
grams every few months. (GE 1 at 41-43, GE 2 at 3-4, Tr. 44-46)
In about February of 2012, while studying overseas as part of a semester abroad,
Applicant used cocaine and hallucinogenic mushrooms. She was offered the mushrooms
by a friend she was studying with while on a sight-seeing trip and was offered the cocaine
at a night club. She did not purchase either of them. She tried both. She has not used
them since and has no intention of using them again. She is no longer close to the friend
who was with her at the time. (SOR Answer, GE 1 at 42-43, GE 2 at 3-4, Tr. 49-54)
Applicant tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in late 2012 or early 2013. She
was prescribed codeine for pain management. During the treatment period, she did not
use all of the codeine. She had four to five pills left after the prescription period ended.
From March through December 2013 Applicant used the remaining four to five codeine
pills for additional pain management. After they were gone, she used Tylenol or ibuprofen.

SOR ¶ 1.g. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old fiber optics technician employed by a defense contractor
since September 2020 (Tr. 15) He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant attended a community college from July 2010 to May 2013 and January
2016 to May 2016, but he has not obtained a degree. He married in November 2012 and
separated on a date not reflected in the record. He testified that he was divorced but could
not recall when it occurred. (Tr. 14).
When Applicant submitted his SCA in April 2019, he disclosed that he illegally used
Oxycontin between September 2013 and December  2017. He did not disclose  illegally
using any other controlled substances.
In response to DOHA interrogatories in September 2022, Applicant admitted using
marijuana  twice  a  month  from  January  2006  to  January  2007.  He  admitted  using
Oxycontin once a week from September 2013 to January 2014 and three times a week
in December 2017. (GX 3 at 4.) He declared that he did not intend to use marijuana in
the  future.  (GX  3  at  6) At  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  last  used  marijuana  around
2020. (Tr. 16)
In Applicant’s response to the SOR in December 2022, he admitted using opioids,
including Oxycontin, Percocet, and Roxicodone on various occasions between 2007 and
December  2017,  using  cocaine  in  2007,  abusing  Adderall  in  2012,  and  using  LSD  on
various  occasions  until  2017.  He  also  admitted  using  mushrooms  on  one  occasion  in
2006.  He  denied  using  phencyclidine  (PCP),  but  he  admitted  that  it  was  possible  that
other drugs were laced with PCP. He admitted that in October 2012, he was diagnosed
in  December  2017  he  was  diagnosed  with
with  cannabis  dependence,
opiate/benzodiazepine  dependence  and  sedative/hypnotic  dependence,
that  his
dependence was continuous and severe, and that his prognosis was fair.
that
Applicant testified that he used Adderall in high school in greater quantities than
prescribed, and he continued to use it in college.  He also started stealing opioids from
his father, who had a prescription for them, and used them to counteract the Adderall. (Tr.
18)
In 2007, Applicant “threw a fit” because his parents would not give him the keys to
the family car. His parents called the police, and he was charged with disorderly conduct.
The charges were dismissed. (Tr. 21-22; GX 9 at 5) He was admitted into a behavioral
health  center  for  three  days  and  diagnosed  with  a  major  depressive  disorder,  single
episode, severe; cocaine abuse; opiate abuse; and cannabis abuse. His prognosis was
“good with adequate follow up and support.” (GX 5)
In 2012, Applicant punched his father in the face because of something that  his
father said. His father was in a wheelchair at the time. (Tr. 39) Applicant was charged with
assault  and  battery  on  a  family  member.  He  spent  a  week  in  jail.  He  was  convicted,
adjudication was deferred, and he was required to complete anger management training.
(GX 9 at 5)
In  October  2012,  after  the  incident  with  his  father,  Applicant  was  involuntarily
admitted  to  a  psychiatric  center  and  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder,
generalized  anxiety  disorder,  and  cannabis  dependence.  He  did  not  complete  this
treatment  program.  He  was discharged  in August 2013  because he  stopped attending
appointments and did not respond to efforts to contact him. (GX 6)  The records of the
psychiatric center do not include a prognosis.
In May 2013, Applicant was charged with destruction of property. He testified that
after he and his father had an argument, he broke a handrail in the house. He testified
that at that time, he would sometimes break something when he was angry. (Tr. 43) He
failed to appear in court, was convicted of contempt of court, and was sentenced to 90
days in jail, suspended for 90 days. (GX 4 at 6)
In  mid-2016,  Applicant’s  father  committed  suicide.  Applicant  went  into  “deep
depression” and resumed use of opioids. On December 15, 2017, he self-admitted into a
psychiatric center for opioid detoxication. On admission, he was diagnosed with opioid
withdrawal,  sedative  hypnotic  withdrawal,  opioid  use  disorder,  benzodiazepine  use
disorder, sedative hypnotic use disorder, substance induced mood disorder, and anxiety
disorder not otherwise specified. (GX 7 at 4) He was discharged on December 29, 2017,
and  diagnosed  with  opiate  dependence,  continuous,  severe;  sedative  and  hypnotic
dependence,  continuous,  severe;  and  generalized  anxiety  disorder.  (GX  7  at  41)  His
prognosis was “fair.” (GX 7 at 6)
After Applicant was discharged from the psychiatric center, he was referred to a
psychiatric  nurse  practitioner,  and  he  began  participating  in  group  therapy  in  January
2018.  His  diagnosis  upon  admission  was  opioid  dependance,  uncomplicated;  and
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic dependence, uncomplicated. (GX 8 at 2) A progress note
from June 2018, reflected that he continued to exhibit symptoms of an emotional disorder
and  substance  abuse  disorder.  (GX  8  at  47)  Group  members  were  required  to  attend
meetings  of  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  or  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  three  times  a
week. In November 2018, the psychiatric nurse practitioner suspected that some of the
signatures on his NA attendance sheets appeared to have been forged. Applicant denied
forging signatures, and  the  issue  was not  resolved. (GX 8  at  80)  During  the  treatment
program,  he  tested  positive  for  marijuana  at  least  twice.  (GX  8  at  48)  He  actively
participated  in  the  group  therapy  sessions.  The  group  therapy  records  reflect  that
Applicant was admonished frequently to follow medication instructions and advised him
against premature tapering off the use of drugs to control the craving for opioids. (GX 8
at 82) At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he stopped taking the drugs sooner than his
therapist  recommended  and  contrary  to  the  advice  of  his  peer  support  group.  He
considers himself “completely clean.” (Tr. 32) The records of the group therapy facility do
not include a prognosis.
In  June  2022,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  board-certified  psychologist  at  the
request  of  the  DCSA  CAS.  (GX  4)  The  psychologist  had  him  complete  a  personality
assessment inventory (PAI). The psychologist noted that Applicant responded to items
carelessly  and  did  not  pay  attention  to  the  content  of  the  questions.  He  attributed
Applicant’s  answers  in  the  PAI  were  due  to  “general  carelessness,  reading  problems,
attention  problems,  or idiosyncratic thinking.”  The  psychologist  concluded  that  the  PAI
was invalid because Applicant’s responses to questions were “indicative of respondents
who attempt to portray themselves in the most positive light and exceptionally free of the
common shortcomings to which most others will admit.”
The psychologist also noted that Applicant “was not highly motivated to put forth
the  mental  energy  needed  to  provide  a  detailed  accounting  of  his  mental  health  and
substance us history and treatment history.” Instead, Applicant simply referred to his SCA
and  report  of  investigation  multiple  times  as  the  source  of  information  that  the
psychologist asked for.
Applicant told the psychologist that he stopped using marijuana when he was hired
by his current employer in September 2020, but later in the interview he admitted that he
had “smoked weed here and there” since he was hired. (GX 4 at 4) He admitted to the
psychologist that he stopped taking the opioid-withdrawal drugs sooner than his therapist
recommended  and  contrary  to  the  advice  of  his  peer  support  group.  The  psychologist
reported  that  it  was  difficult  to  fully  understand  Applicant’s  current  substance-abuse
status, because the information he provided during the assessment was inconsistent with
past records (such as his SCA and responses to interrogatories) and his own statements
during  the  assessment.  He  noted  that  there  was  “hard  evidence”  that  Applicant  had
recovered from his last episode of opioid abuse, but there was also evidence that he did
not follow the treatment recommendations from his last treatment that ended in December
2018. The psychologist concluded:
At best, [Applicant] has abstained from opioid and other drug use since 2017
and from marijuana use since 2020. At worst, he misrepresented himself to
me and he continues to use illegal drugs and/or misuse prescription drugs
with an unknown frequency and intensity. . . . At best, [Applicant] is free of
interfering  mental  health  symptoms  at  this time.  At  worst,  he  continues  to
suffer  from  a  range  of  symptoms  to  a  degree  that  interferes  with  his
interpersonal and work life. I am simply unable to tell.
The psychologist concluded, “The results of the present evaluation are inconclusive
regarding whether [Applicant] has any active mental health or substance abuse condition
that could negatively impact his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment in safeguarding
national security information.” (GX 4 at 6-7)
Applicant’s girlfriend since December 2020 met him while they were both working
for his current employer. She  regards him  as a  kind  and  loving  person  who  is “always
trying to improve himself despite the things he did in the past.” She believes that he has
grown into a “healthy and reliable person, coworker, and future husband.” (AX A)
Applicant’s lifelong friend, who now shares an apartment with him, has known him
since they were teenagers. He witnessed  Applicant’s “blatant disregard  for himself and
others around him, destructive behavior, and rampant substance abuse.” He believes that
Applicant has “both figuratively and literally turned his life around in roaring totality for the
better.”  Although  Applicant  was  told  that  he  would  “never  be  employed,  never  free  of
drugs, and never worth of affection,” he now “has a great job, is long-term free of drugs,
and is in a health relationship.” (AX C)
Applicant’s younger brother believes that the turning point in Applicant’s life was
the passing of their father. He describes the changes in Applicant’s behavior as “someone
that  was  on  the  path  of  self-destruction  to  someone  [who]  leads  the  path  of  self-
improvement.”  He  considers  Applicant  a  role  model  to  any  who  wishes  to  better
themselves and enjoy a happy, successful adulthood. (AX D)
Applicant’s mother states that she has watched him  completely transform during
the past ten years, when her view of him was “murky at best” to the present. He now talks
about  things  that  she never dreamed possible  for him.  (AX  E) Applicant’s  former wife,
who maintains a “strong friendship” with him, believes that he has undergone a significant
positive  transformation  after  the  passing  of  his  father.  He  now  handles  his  mother’s
financial matters and has shown no interest in drugs. (AX G)
One of Applicant’s coworkers, who has known him for the past year, describes him
as “an individual who shows up earlier than asked, works hard, and carries [himself] in a
polite, respectable manner. (AX H) Applicant’s project lead describes him as a kind and
generous person with a strong sense of duty and high integrity. (AX B) Applicant’s current
project manager describes him as an upstanding and reliable key employee, who plays
a  critical  role  in  the  fiber  optic  installation  team.  He  strongly  recommends  approval  of
Applicant’s application for a security clearance. (AX F)

Specialist  (E-3).  In  November  2014  she  submitted  an  e-QIP  (2014  e-QIP)  (GE  2)  in
connection with her enlistment  in the ANG and was granted a security clearance. She
has worked for a DoD contractor since September 2019.  She subsequently submitted a

Paragraph 1: Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  she  has  tested  positive  for  THC  in  July  2020.  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  In  her  Answer
Applicant denied this allegation and provided an explanation of the circumstances of the
drug test.
I make the following findings of fact with respect SOR allegation ¶ 1.a:
Applicant was drug tested on July 27, 2020, in connection with her ANG service.
The  test  results  were  reported  by  the  lab  on  August  5,  2020,  as  positive  for  THC,  or
marijuana. On August 18, 2020, a flag was initiated by the Deputy Chief of Staff G-1 of
State  1’s  ANG.  The  reason  provided  in  the  Report  to  Suspend  Favorable  Personnel
Actions (Flag), DA Form 286 (August 2020 DA 286 or GE 5) was “Drug Abuse Adverse
Action.” GE 5 reflects that Applicant was on the distribution list. A memorandum from the
Headquarters  of  the  State  1  ANG,  dated  October  29,  2020,  (the  October  2020
Memorandum  or GE  7)  states  that Applicant enrolled  in  the  State  1  ANG’s  Substance
Abuse Program (SAP) on August 27, 2020, after testing positive for “an illegal substance”
on July 27, 2020. The memorandum further reflects that she “successfully attended and
participated  in  the  required  inpatient  program.”  A  May  8,  2023  memorandum  from  the
State 1 ANG Joint Force Headquarters recites the details of Applicant’s positive drug test,
including  her  being.  “Flagged  for  drug  abuse.”  and  her  successful  completion  of  the
substance abuse inpatient program, as set forth in GE 7. Applicant’s positive test result
for THC is substantial evidence of her use of marijuana prior to the test. (GE 4 through
GE 8.)
On August 18, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by a U.S. Government investigator
in  connection  with  her  2021  security  clearance  application  (GE  1).  The  investigator
prepared  a  summary  of  Applicant’s  statements  during  the  interview  in  a  report  (ROI).
the  accuracy  of  the  report  in  her  responses  to  DOHA’s
Applicant  confirmed
interrogatories. The ROI recites that Applicant denied in her interview that she had used
marijuana prior to testing positive for THC in July 2020. She claimed that she was first
advised about three months by her commander after the drug test that she tested positive
and had to retest the next day. Applicant declined to retest because she said she had a
family emergency and was unavailable the next day. She further asserted in the interview
that this conversation about three weeks prior to her separation from the ANG, which was
in October 2020. (GE 3 at 4.)
Applicant’s
interview  statements  are
the  Government’s
documentary evidence described above that she was advised in August 2020 that she
was  flagged  for  drug  abuse  and  that  she  was  required  to  participate  in  an  inpatient
substance  abuse  treatment  program  beginning  on  August  27,  2020,  which  she
subsequently completed.
inconsistent  with
At the  hearing, Applicant testified  that she  first  learned  about the  positive  drug  test
when   her sergeant  advised   her  of  the  test  results   just   prior to   her   separation   from   the
ANG. She  denied that she had  used marijuana  prior to  her drug  test  or at any  other time
since  2010. She  testified  that her  sergeant told her to  speak with  their  unit commander
on  October 18,  2020,  for further instructions. She  advised  the  commander that the  test
results were  inaccurate  due  to  a  label mix up. She  explained  to  the  commander that new
labels  had   to   be   printed   during   the   testing   process  and   that   a   mix  up   produced   an
erroneous  positive test  result for Applicant.  She  also  claimed  at the  hearing  that neither
she nor anyone  else taking a drug test at that time  were  asked  to re-sign the new labels.
Applicant made the additional assertions  that the October 2020  Memorandum contained
inaccurate  information  in that she  never participated  in  the  ANG’s SAP. (Tr. at 13-14, 24-
26, 29-30.)
Applicant  further  testified  that  her  commander  told  her  that  she  could  file  a
complaint with the Inspector General (IG) and that she would receive paper copies of all
of the relevant documentation. She said she filed a complaint electronically with the IG in
2020 about both the mistake in the drug test results and the inaccurate information in the
October Memorandum. She did not produce a copy of her IG complaint at the hearing.
She claimed that she followed up on her complaint several times, but she  never heard
further and did not receive paper copies of anything related to the drug test.  Applicant
also testified that prior to receiving the Government’s evidence from Department Counsel
in March 2023, she had never seen GE 6, the August 2020 DA 286. (Tr. at 14-15, 22, 25-
27.)
Paragraph 2: Guideline E, Personal Conduct
The SOR sets forth three allegations under the Personal Conduct guideline. The
Government alleged that Applicant has engaged in dishonest and unreliable conduct by
falsifying responses to questions in her 2021 e-QIP and her 2014 e-QIP regarding her
past use of illegal drugs. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b.) The SOR also cross-alleged the allegation
set forth in ¶ 1.a under Guideline H. (SOR ¶ 2.c.)
I make the following findings of fact with respect SOR allegation  ¶¶ 2.a through
2.c:
Department Counsel submitted the 2021 e-QIP (GE 1) and an excerpt for the 2014
e-QIP (GE 2). In the 2021 e-QIP, Applicant responded in the negative to the question in
Section 23 of that application about her drug use in the past seven years. The excerpt
from  Applicant’s  2014  e-QIP  are  the  pages  of  that  application  in  which  Section  23
appears. The SOR points to Applicant’s failed drug test in July 2020 as evidence that she
had used marijuana prior to the drug test and that her response to the seven-year drug
question  in  Section  23  of  the  2021  e-QIP  was  a  deliberate  falsification.  In  view  of  my
finding  above  that  her  positive  drug  test  was  substantial  evidence  of  Applicant  having
used marijuana prior to the test, I conclude that the Government has met its burden to
establish its allegation that Applicant deliberately falsified her answers in Section 23 of
the 2019 e-QIP. (GE 1 at 31-32.)
As stated, Department Counsel also submitted an excerpt of Applicant’s 2014 e-
QIP  with  her  responses  to  Section  23  regarding  drug  use  in  the  past  seven  years.
Applicant  answered  these  questions  in  the  negative.  During  her  2022  background
interview,  she  disclosed  that  she  had  use  marijuana  once  in  2010  when  she  was  a
freshman in high school. She also wrote in the Answer that she had smoked marijuana in
August 2010, which was the same high school incident. She blamed the non-disclosure
of that drug use in the 2014 e-QIP on her recruiter, who she claimed filled out the form
for her. She asserted in her Answer and at the hearing that she had advised the recruiter
about her one-time prior use of marijuana, and he failed to note her response in the 2014
e-QIP. (Answer; Tr. at 18; GE 2 at 20-21; GE 3 at 5.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  the  non-disclosure  of  her drug use  in  2010.
She testified that she advised her recruiter of her drug use in high school, and he told her
not to mention it or she would not be allowed to enlist. She reported that the recruiter told
her everything would be “fine” if she passed the drug test when she enlisted. She claimed
that the recruiter prepared her 2014 e-QIP. She did admit that she signed the 2014 e-QIP
under penalty of perjury for any deliberately false statements. (Tr. at 18-20.)

Guideline H, Drug Involvement  and Substance  Misuse
The  Government  alleged  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a
clearance because he has a history of drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged
that Applicant used Ecstasy in about August 2017 and marijuana from about March 2018
through at least January 2022 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). The SOR also alleged that Applicant
used marijuana after having been granted eligibility for access to classified information in
January 2020 (SOR ¶ 1.c). In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations “with
clarifications.”
I make the following findings of fact with respect to the SOR allegations:
SOR ¶ 1.a. Ecstasy  Use.  Applicant used Ecstasy on one occasion in August 2017
at a music festival he attended with some college friends. He was given the drug by a
friend. Applicant views this as a one-time experience. He had never taken Ecstasy before
this music festival and has never taken it since. Applicant disclosed this illegal drug use
in his 2019 e-QIP. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 21-24; GE 1 at 37-38.)
SOR ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c.  Marijuana  Use. Applicant wrote in the Answer that he smoked
marijuana a few times with friends in 2018 while he was attending college. He smoked
marijuana using a THC wax pen. He estimated that this occurred four or five times. The
friends were in his study group during his senior year in college. He never possessed,
bought,  or  sold  the  drug.  He  stopped  using  marijuana  prior  to  starting  work  at  his
employer.  His  employer  has  a  zero-tolerance  policy  for  illegal  drug  use.  Applicant
disclosed his 2018 use of marijuana in his 2019 e-QIP. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 24-33, 38-42;
GE 1 at 38.)
Applicant also admitted in his Answer that he used marijuana twice in 2021. He
reported his use of marijuana in his 2022 e-QIP, and the two instances of illegal drug use
are the subject of these SOR allegations. The first time he used marijuana in August 2021
was at a  friend’s wedding. Applicant joined  with  friends he knew from high school and
took “a few puffs” on a THC wax pen. The wedding was the first occasion that he had
seen these friends since  the beginning of the  Covid-19 pandemic. The second time  in
2021 was at a New Year’s Eve (2021-2022) party with friends from college. (Answer at 1;
Tr. at 24-33; GE 2 at 34-36.)
Applicant  wrote  in  his  2019  e-QIP  that,  “I  sacrificed  a  lot  to  make  sure  that  I
graduated college and have no intention of jeopardizing my early career by using THC
wax pens.” At the hearing, he admitted that he used poor judgment on two occasions by
smoking marijuana in 2021. He also described his judgment as a “careless lapse.” In the
future,  he  plans  to  be  very  diligent  and  “very,  very  conscious  of  my  actions.”  He  also
attributed his lapses of judgment to the end of the COVID-19 restrictions on socializing.
Now that the restrictions have been lifted for some time, he is comfortable that socializing
with friends is not such a special occasion, and he can exercise better judgment in his
actions. He has never been a habitual user of marijuana. He estimates that he has used
marijuana about eight times in his life. He is unhappy with himself that he used such poor
judgment that he put himself in the position of being scrutinized for his recent drug. He
intends to make sure that he never puts his career in jeopardy again. He is now more
conscious of his actions at his workplace, when he is away from work, and when he is
around others. He is confident that his past poor judgment will not be repeated.  (Answer
at 2; Tr. at 38-42, 44-48, 49; GE 2 at 35.)
Mitigation  and Whole-Person Evidence
In his 2022 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed his marijuana use in 2021 because he knew
it  was  important  to  be  completely  transparent  and  honest.  He  feels  that  his  work  is
important, and he takes his work seriously.  He does not intend to ever use an illegal drug
again. He feels strongly that the incidents in 2021 are in the past and will not be repeated.
He has had subsequent experiences where others were using drugs in his presence, and
he has refrained from participating. He understands now that his work is very important
to him, and he does not want to jeopardize his career in any way. Applicant submitted a
written letter expressing his intent to abstain from illegal drugs in the future. (Tr. at 33-37;

Applicant  also  presented  a  psychological  evaluation  from  a  board-certified
psychologist.  The  psychologist  concluded
that  Applicant  “does  not  have  any
psychological  conditions,  behavioral  patterns,  or  substance  use  problems  that  could
impair  his  judgment,  reliability,  or  trustworthiness  related  to  properly  safeguarding
national security information or working in a secure setting.” In support of this conclusion,
the psychologist noted that Applicant has admitted to making poor choices in the past.
The psychologist wrote further that Applicant “elected to disclose the information [about
his past drug use] to the Government when it would have been easy to omit and conceal
it. [Applicant] said, ‘I just decided I would rather be honest and up front about it. That’s
who I want to be.’” (AE Q at 5-6.)

"Applicant is a 74-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked since 1999. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1972. He was married from 1975
until 1982. He remarried in 1985.  He has two adult children.  He served  on active duty
with  the  Navy  for  about  three  months  between  1972  and  1973,  when  he  received  a
general discharge because of a health issue. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1, 2)
At  all  times  relevant  to  this  proceeding,  marijuana  cultivation,  sale,  and
possession  has  been  illegal  under  federal  law.  Federal  laws  regarding  marijuana
supersede any state laws that are inconsistent with it. Applicant was granted access to
classified information at all times relevant hereto. (Tr. 17; GE 1-4)
In  about  June  2019, after a  change  in  state law  regarding marijuana  in  State  A
where he resides, Applicant created a limited liability company (LLC) for the purpose of
cultivating  and  selling  medical  marijuana  for  profit.  He  and  his  wife  created  the  LLC
because they thought it was legal and because they saw it as an opportunity to provide
a job for their son, who lacked stable employment. Applicant felt he could also draw on
his  experience  as  a  farmer  when  he  was  younger.  They  complied  with  State  A’s
regulatory requirements and paid about $25,000 of their own money to create and run
the  business.  He  left  day  to  day  operations  of  the  business,  including  the  marijuana
cultivation,  to  his  son,  who  lived  about  an  hour-and-a-half  away  from  Applicant.  He
visited  the  operating  location  of  the LLC once.  The  LLC was  never  profitable,  partially
because  their  marijuana  crop  never  met  State  A’s  testing  requirements  for  quality.
There is no evidence that the LLC ever sold any marijuana. (Tr. 17-18, 20-24; GE 2, 3,
6)
In June 2021, when it came time to renew the LLC’s operating license with State
A,  Applicant  did  not  renew  it.  He  made  this  decision  because  the  business  was  not
profitable  and  because  his son  found other, stable employment.  The  LLC is no  longer
operational and its status with State A has been inactive since June 2021. The LLC still
owns  assets,  such  as pots, heat  lamps,  and a  hoop  house, but he plans  to divest  the
LLC of those assets. His  ability  to do so  was  delayed and  hampered  by his colorectal
cancer  diagnosis  in  October  2022,  for  which  he  received  radiation  and  chemotherapy
treatment.  He  now  believes  he  is  cancer  free,  so  he  will  take  the  steps  necessary  to
wind down the LLC. The LLC does not currently own any marijuana or federally illegal
paraphernalia.  He  has  no  intention  to  be  involved  with  illegal,  controlled  substances
ever again, and claimed that if he had known it was illegal under federal law, he would
never have become involved. (Tr. 17-18, 20-30; GE 1-3, 6)
About every year-and-a-half since 2009, Applicant has received training from his
employer  regarding  his  responsibilities  as  a  security  clearance  holder.  This  training
informed  Applicant  that  the  use  of  illegal,  controlled  substances,  among  other  things,
could  result  in  the  loss  of  his  security  clearance.  While  he  never  notified  his  facility
security officer about the LLC or the nature of its operations, there is no evidence that
the training informed him that he had to inform his employer that he had registered an
outside business or that he was  cultivating an illegal controlled substance.  He testified
that he believed there was no reporting requirement for registering a business or a duty
to report that he started a business that was cultivating marijuana. He also testified that,
because  it  was  legal  pursuant  to  state  law,  he  did  not  know  that  cultivating  marijuana
was illegal pursuant to federal law or that it could affect his security clearance eligibility.
In  about  March  2020,  while  the  LLC  was  operational,  one  of  the  LLC’s  creditors,  a
credit-card  company,  canceled  the  LLC’s  credit  card  because  of  the  nature  of  its
transactions. While acknowledging the cancellation, he testified that he still thought the
LLC  operations  were  legal  because  it  was  properly  licensed  with  State  A  and  legal
pursuant to the laws of State A. I observed him testify and found his testimony credible.

Under Guideline  H  in the  SOR, the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  operation  of
the   LLC   while  granted   access  to   classified   information   or  holding   a   sensitive  position.
Under  Guideline   E   in   the   SOR,   the   Government   alleged   his  failure  to   report  his
operation  of the  LLC to  his facility security officer and  cross-alleged  the  operation  of the
LLC.  (SOR;  Answer)

"Under  Guideline  H,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  used  marijuana
between 1991 and at least February 2023 (SOR 1.a); that between 2015 and 2022, he
purchased  marijuana  (SOR  1.b);  that  in  October  2010,  he  used  Vicodin  without  a
prescription  (SOR  1.c);  and  that  in  1994,  and  between  2000  and  2007,  he  used
methamphetamine (SOR 1.f).
It is further alleged that in December 1994, he was arrested and charged with the
sale  or  transportation  of  a  controlled  substance  and  possession  of  methamphetamine
(SOR  1.j);  that  from  1993  to  1996,  he  sold  cocaine  (SOR  1.i);  that  in  1998,  he  was
arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale (SOR 1.h); that
in  2007,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of  a  controlled  substance  and
being under the influence of a controlled substance (SOR 1.g); and that in 2010, he was
arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of  a  narcotic  controlled  substance  (SOR  1.d).
Finally, it was alleged that in 2009, he was ordered to undergo treatment for his drug use,
which he failed to successfully complete (SOR 1.e). (FORM, Item 1)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  Government  cross-alleged  the  Guideline  H  allegations
(SOR 2.a). It also was alleged that Applicant intentionally made false official statements
in response to questions in Section 22 (Police Record – EVER) of his August 2022 e-QIP
by failing to list the facts alleged in SOR 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j (SOR 2.b). The SOR also
alleged  that  Applicant  intentionally  made  a  false  official  statement  in  response  to
questions in Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his August 2022 e-QIP
by failing to list the facts alleged in SOR 1.a (SOR 2.c). (FORM, Item 1)
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  without  comment,  each  of  the
allegations.  (Form,  Item  1)  All  of  the  allegations  are  also  supported  by  disclosures  he
made in his e-QIP; by statements he made during a personal subject interview (PSI) on
October 26 and 28, 2022; by a report of arrest information from the FBI’s Criminal Justice
Information Services Division; and by his responses to interrogatories from Department
Counsel  on  March  15,  2023.  (FORM,  Items  2  –  4)  After  reviewing  all  of  the  available
information, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  employee  of  a  company  contracted  with  the  federal
government to perform duties in support of a military facility. He requires eligibility for a
public trust position to access his work location. He is a high school graduate, has never
married, and has one child, now age 21. (FORM, Items 2 and 3)
Applicant started using marijuana in 1991, when he was about 15 or 16 years old.
At times, he smoked as many as five joints a day. He reduced and eventually ceased his
marijuana use by September 2022, because he was trying to find work and knew he might
have  to  undergo  urinalysis  testing.  In  2015, he  started  buying  marijuana  from  medical
marijuana  dispensaries  in  his  home  state,  where  personal  possession  and  use  of
marijuana has been legalized. Although he claims his use of marijuana has never caused
him  personal  or  professional  difficulties,  in  2009,  as  alleged  in  SOR  1.e,  a  local  child
protective services agency (CPS) ordered him to undergo rehabilitative drug treatment
after his then-8-year-old child made remarks about his drug use to someone at her school.
Because he did not complete the treatment, his daughter was placed in foster care and
eventually  adopted.  In  his  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  on  March  15,  2023,  he
disclosed that he had last used marijuana a total of five times on two days in February
2023, six months after he submitted his e-QIP. He also averred that he does not intend
to use marijuana in the future. In his e-QIP, he did not list his failed drug treatment (as
required by Section 23) because  he  ‘did not want to  relive  it.” He did not list his use  of
marijuana (also as required by Section 23) because he does not believe marijuana use
is a bad thing. (FORM, Items 2 and 3)
Sua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I
controlled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation  of federal
law.  Guidance  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  (OASD)  in
February  2013  makes  clear  that  changes  in  the  laws  pertaining  to  marijuana  by  the
various states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the current National
Security  Adjudicative  Guidelines.  Because  federal  law  supersedes  state  laws  on  this
issue, Applicant’s use of marijuana, regardless of location or medical justification  in his
state of residence, is illegal. Further, illegal drug use is prohibited in all federal workplaces
and on all military installations by civilian federal employees and by persons employed
for work on federal contracts.
Between  1994  and  2009,  Applicant  used  and  sold  other  federally  controlled
substances. Specifically, he sold, but did not use, cocaine from 1993 to 1996. He used
methamphetamine (crystal meth) in 1994 because a girl he liked used it. He also used
crystal meth between 2000 and 2007, again because his girlfriend used it. He used it daily
but decided to stop using it when he noticed it affected his thinking and gave him what he
referred to as a ”light brain.” (FORM, Items 1 and 3)
Applicant was arrested in 1994 and charged with possession of crystal meth and
with possession of a controlled substance for sale. In 1996, he was sentenced to three
years’ probation. During probation, he was required to undergo random urinalysis testing.
Twice he tested positive for marijuana. After the second positive test, he was ordered to
complete  a  drug  rehabilitation  program  and  his  probation  was  restarted  pending
completion of the rehab program. He completed rehab in 1998  and probation in 1999.
Applicant disclosed his arrest, rehab, and probation in his e-QIP. (FORM, Items 2 – 4)
SOR 1.h alleges Applicant also was arrested in 1998 and charged with possession
of a  controlled  substance for sale. In his PSI,  he  stated he did not remember such an
arrest and there is no information about a disposition of this charge. It is likely the entry
in the FBI report is related to the 1996 conviction discussed above. SOR 1.h is resolved
for Applicant. (FORM, Items 3 and 4)
Applicant was arrested in November 2007 and charged with possession, and being
under the influence, of a controlled substance (crystal meth). During a search incident to
a  traffic  stop,  a  plastic  bag  containing  crystal  meth  residue  was  found  in  Applicant’s
pocket. He acknowledged he had used crystal meth earlier that day but had forgotten to
get rid of the bag. He spent three days in jail before the charges were dismissed. He did
not disclose this arrest because he viewed it as a minor event when compared to his 1994
arrest. (FORM, Items 2 – 4)
In October 2010, Applicant used a pain reliever – Vicodin – without a prescription.
Use  of  Vicodin  requires  a  prescription  because  it  is  an  opiate-based  medication.
Applicant’s niece gave him three Vicodin pills after he developed a migraine headache.
He took one of the pills and kept the other two. Later in the day, a friend of his asked him
if he had anything for a headache and Applicant traded one of the Vicodin pills for a single
dose of Oxycontin, also a prescription pain reliever. On October 19, 2010, Applicant was
stopped  by  police  on suspicion  of  selling  illegal drugs.  A  consensual search  produced
unprescribed Vicodin and Oxycontin in his possession. After a few days in jail, the charges
were dismissed. Applicant did not disclose this arrest in his e-QIP because he forgot about
it. (FORM, Items 2 – 4)

Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Tr. 20-21.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has used illegal drugs. He admitted the single allegation under this paragraph
with explanations.
1.a. Applicant smoked marijuana during two distinct periods of time. He smoked
marijuana twice in approximately 2008 when he was in college. He derived no pleasure
from it and did not use it again for almost 13 years. He admitted this use during a 2015
investigation. (Government Exhibit 3 at Section 23; Government Exhibit 4; Tr. 19, 29.)
In 2021 Applicant began a relationship with his partner (Ms. One). Ms. One is a
cancer survivor who uses marijuana to relieve pain from her treatment. In approximately
June 2021, during the Covid pandemic, Applicant used marijuana about four times with
Ms. One. He supplied no good reason for using marijuana at this time, particularly given
the  fact  he  has  held  a  security  clearance  for  many  years.  He  admitted  this  use  in  an
August 2021 e-QIP and  a subsequent interview.  (Government Exhibit  1 at Section 23;
Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 22-23, 29, 32, 34-35, 37.)
Applicant has not used marijuana for two years. He states that he understands the
proscription against marijuana use while holding a security clearance, and has evinced a
credible intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. He submitted a signed statement
of intent acknowledging that any future use of illegal drugs is grounds for revocation of
his security clearance. (Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 26-28, 38.)

Applicant  used  marijuana  when  he  was  in  high  school.1  He  used  cocaine  and
ecstasy (3, 4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine or MDMA) on one occasion each. He
signed  the  contract  to  enlist  in  the military  in  about  August  2008, but  he  did  not  go  to
boot camp until April 2009. He submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions
(SF 86)  in  August 2008  as  part of  his enlistment  paperwork.  He  informed his recruiter
about his illegal drug use, but the recruiter told him not to report  it, and he did not. He
did not use any illegal drugs from the time he signed the contract until his discharge in
2014. (Tr. at 24-25, 55, 62-64)
Applicant used marijuana on about ten occasions from May 2016 through March
2020.  He  smoked  it,  vaped  it,  or  ate  it,  always  with  his  wife.  He  used  cocaine  on  two
occasions  in  May  2019.  He  and  his  wife  used  it  with  his  neighbor  who  provided  the
cocaine.  They  were  drinking  on  both  occasions.  Applicant  held  a  security  clearance
during  the  entire  period  of  his drug use  from 2016  through 2020.  From  about  October
2017  to  January  2019,  he  had  access  to  classified  information.  After  that,  he  held  a

Applicant self-reported his marijuana use to his security officer after he was hired
by  his  current  employer  in  June  2019.  He  wrote  that  he  last  used  marijuana  in

Applicant did not  report his cocaine use that occurred just  the month before his
statement.  He  wrote  in  the  statement  that  high  school  “was  the  last  time  [he]  used
cocaine.” He used marijuana about two to three times after he submitted the statement
to his security officer. He fully reported his illegal drug use on the SF 86 he submitted in

with   stopped   using   marijuana,  and   the   neighbor  he   used   cocaine   with   moved   away.
Applicant  used  to  drink regularly.  In  about  November 2022,  he  and  his wife  decided  to
significantly  cut  down   on   their   drinking   and   concentrate   on   their  children   and   other
activities.  He  estimates that  he  has  had  a  total of  fewer  than  ten  drinks since  then.  He is
committed   to   remaining   drug   free.   He   realizes  that  he   made   poor  decisions  when   he
used  illegal drugs. He is willing  to  accept the  consequences of his conduct.  (Tr. at 16-

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  admitted  the  factual  allegations  in
Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations
in Paragraph 4 of the SOR, with explanation.
Applicant  is  49  years  old,  twice  divorced,  and  has  three  children,  two  of  whom
are adults. He has worked for a defense contractor since June of 2018. (GX 1 at pages
7, 12, 18~20 and 22~23.).
Guideline H - Drug Involvement   and Substance Misuae
1.a. Applicant admits that he used marijuana, about once or twice a month from
about  1996 until his  last  usage  in  about  July of  2015.  In  2015,  about  eight  years ago,
Applicant  found  out  that  he  had  a  “heart  disease;”  and  as  a  result,  stopped  using
marijuana. (TR at page 16 line 4 to page 17 line 22.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
2.b.  Applicant  has  paid  his  2015  Federal  income  tax  debt  through  an  “Online
Account” by two payments: $1,000 in April of 2022, and $4,074 in August of 2023. This
is  evidenced  by  a  document  from  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).  (PHX  A.)  On
August  1, 2023, Applicant also filed his Federal income tax returns  for tax  years 2016
and  2017,  as  evidenced  by  those  filings.  (PHXs  C  and  D.)  He  has  also  submitted
documentation  from  the  IRS  showing  that  Applicant  owes  “$0.00”  for  tax  years
2017~2022. (PHX B.)
Guideline J  - Criminal Conduct
3.a. Applicant admits that in August of 2015, about eight years ago, he was found
to  be  in  Contempt  of  Court  during  a  child  custody  battle  with  his  second  wife.  When
asked if he was using drugs, which his former spouse alleged, Applicant averred “no,”
since Applicant had previously ceased any marijuana usage due to his heart condition.
However, he tested  “positive”  as a result of his past marijuana usage. (TR at page 18
line  18  to  page  20  line  6.)  As  a  result,  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  seven  days  of
confinement for Contempt.
3.b. Applicant admits that in July of 2018, about five years ago, he was arrested
and  charged  with  Driving  Under  the  Influence  (DUI).  He  claims  he  had  consumed  a
couple  of  beers. (TR at page  20  line  10  to  page  21  line  6.) Applicant has completed  all
court-required  DUI programs, as evidenced  by court documents.  (PHXs K, L  and M.)
3.c.  Applicant  admits  that  in  December  of  2019,  about  four  years  ago,  he  was
arrested  and  charged  with  being  an  “unlicensed  driver”  in  State  B,  which  had
suspended  his  State  B  driver’s  license  as  a  result  of  his  2018  DUI  arrest.  (AppX  A.)
Although he had moved to State B, he was still using his previous valid State A driver’s
license. (TR at page 21 line 14 to page 24 line 21.)
Guideline G  - Alcohol Consumption
4.a.  As  a  result  of  his  July  2018  DUI,  noted  above  in  subparagraph  3.b.,
Applicant no longer drives after drinking alcohol. (TR at page 30 line 22 to page 31 line
14.)
",True
"Applicant, age 33, is an employee of a Department of Defense contractor seeking
to  maintain  his  security  clearance.  He  has  worked  for  various  DoD  contractors  at  an
overseas location since 2015. He served on active duty in the United States Army from
2007  to  2010,  separating  with  a  general  under  honorable  conditions  discharge.  He  is
divorced and has no children. (GE 1-2; Tr. 11, 17-18, 26)
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement
Applicant admitted using marijuana with varying frequency from October 2009 to
January 2010. (SOR  ¶ 1.a,  Response  to  SOR) He  also admitted using marijuana  with
varying frequency from July 2014 to February 2021. (SOR ¶ 1.b, Response to SOR) In
April  2010,  he  was  discharged  from  the  U.S.  Army  with  a  discharge  characterized  as
general under honorable conditions due to a positive urinalysis for THC, and marijuana
use. (SOR ¶ 1.c: GE 9)
After his discharge from active duty, Applicant was arrested on three occasions
and charged with drug-related offenses to include:
SOR  ¶   1.d:   February  2015  arrest  for  Use/Possession  Drug  Paraphernalia;
Use/Possession Marijuana. Applicant failed to appear in court and a warrant was issued.
The case was nolle prossed, with prejudice in May 2018. (GE 3);
SOR  ¶   1.e:  June  2015  arrest  for  Illegal  Possession  of  Prescription  Drugs  and
Possession of Marijuana, Second Degree. He failed to appear in court and a warrant was
issued for his arrest. (GE 2 at 18; GE 5); and
SOR ¶  1.f:  May 2018 arrest for Possession of Marijuana Second Degree and Open
Container in a Vehicle. He failed to appear in court and a warrant was issued for his arrest.
(GE 2 at 19-20; GE 6)
During the hearing, Applicant testified that he first used marijuana at age 12. It was
a one-time experimental use. He did not use marijuana again until he was deployed to
Iraq in 2009. He was deployed to Iraq from approximately July 2008 to October 2009.
Although Applicant admitted the use of alcohol and marijuana was prohibited in Iraq by a
General Order, several of his fellow soldiers were drinking alcohol to blow off steam.  He
was a driver and decided it was better to use marijuana instead of alcohol even though
he was aware marijuana use was prohibited.  He estimated he used marijuana at least
once a month while deployed. (Tr. 18-19, 70-71)
Upon his return from deployment, Applicant continued to use marijuana while on
active  duty.  He  smoked  marijuana  in  social  settings,  at  parties,  and  in  the  park.  He
estimated  his  level  of  use  was  on  a  weekly to  monthly  basis.  In  early  2010,  Applicant
smoked marijuana with a fellow soldier at a party in the barracks. Soon after, his unit was
called for a random urinalysis. He and his friend both tested positive for THC, a derivative
of marijuana and both were eventually discharged from active duty. In February 2010, he
was  ordered  to  attend  ASAP  (a  drug  counseling  course  the  Army  provided),  but  was
separated from active duty before its completion.  (GE 2 at 15. Tr. 19-20)
After  his  separation  from  active  duty,  Applicant  did  not  use  marijuana  until  July
2014. He smoked marijuana on a monthly basis until February 2021. He stopped using
marijuana when he applied for his current job because he did not want to fail the drug
test. Between 2015 to 2021, Applicant worked for several DoD contractors. He was asked
whether he recalls signing a drug policy document with each employer which states that
illegal  drug  use  is  prohibited.  Subject  told  the  background  investigator  conducting  his
security  clearance  investigation  that  he  knew  marijuana  use  was  against  policy,  but
thought  his  use  was  not  hurting  anything  since  he  never  used  marijuana  at  work.  He
stopped using marijuana in hopes of being granted a security clearance. He claims he is
not dependent on marijuana and is able to stop using it. He testified during the hearing
that  the  last  time  he  used  marijuana  was  in  November  2022.  I  am  going  to  use  the
November 2022 date as the last time he used marijuana. (Tr. 22-25, 74; GE 2 at 16)
Applicant admits that he was arrested in February 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.e) but was not
sure what the charges were. He claims the police were looking for his brother. His brother
was  not home,  so Applicant  was arrested  because  the  police  discovered grinders and
papers. Applicant denies that he possessed marijuana. He did not appear in court. He
returned overseas to work. He claims that he was not aware of the outstanding charges
until he came home on vacation and was arrested for having open arrest warrants. (Tr.
26 -30; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  admits  he  was  arrested  in  June  2015,  but  denies  that  he  possessed
marijuana or illegally possessed prescription drugs. (SOR ¶ 1.e) He was driving with Mr.
M, a close friend. The car he was driving belonged to  his mother’s friend. A police car
drove in the opposite direction and noticed Applicant was driving without a seat belt.  As
Applicant pulled into the driveway of Mr. M’s house, the police approached their car.  A
subsequent search of the car revealed prescription pills.  He does not recall marijuana
being found in the car. He and his friend were arrested, booked, and spent 24 hours in
jail. He posted bond. He was given a court date, but went back overseas to work before
the court date. He failed to appear and a warrant was issued for his arrest. (Tr. 32, GE 2
at 18-19; Answer to SOR; GE 5)
Finally, Applicant admits he was arrested in May 2018 but was not sure where the
marijuana charges came from. (SOR ¶ 1.f) He was home on leave to attend his sister’s
graduation. He had several open bottles of alcohol in the car which were left over from
the graduation celebration. He was driving back from the celebration. A woman who he
had  just  met  on-line  was  in  the  car  with  him.  He  believes  she  may  have  possessed
marijuana. He denies possessing marijuana. Five minutes after he picked up the woman,
the police pulled him over and he was arrested for Open Container and Possession of
Marijuana, Second Degree. The police discovered Applicant had open warrants in several
jurisdictions. The police report indicates Applicant was searched after they discovered he
had outstanding warrants. A bundle of U.S. currency and a plastic baggie containing a
green leafy substance believed to be marijuana was found in Applicant’s right front pocket
of his shorts. (Gov 6 at 2) Applicant ended up spending four nights in jail in four different
jurisdictions in order to answer the outstanding warrants. After he was released, Applicant
returned to his overseas residence.  He did not appear at his court date and a warrant
was issued for his arrest. (Tr. 45 – 52; GE 2 at 19-20; GE 6; Answer to SOR)
Applicant returned  to  the  U.S. in  November 2020, to  spend  Thanksgiving  with  his
family. He  did  not attempt  to  resolve his open  warrants when  he  was  home. His mother
told him not to worry about it because it had  no effect on  his job or life overseas. (Tr. 54-
56; Gov 2  at 20) During  the  hearing, Applicant testified  the  last time  he  visited  the  U.S.
was May 2022. The  warrants remain outstanding. He  indicated he plans to  hire a  lawyer
to solve these issues at some point in the future. (Tr. 15, 43;  GE  4; GE 10)

The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e – 1.f are cross- alleged under Guideline J, Criminal
Conduct.  The same facts apply.
Personal Conduct
The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.f are cross- alleged under Guideline E, Personal
Conduct.  The same facts apply.
Applicant is alleged to  have intentionally falsified several answers on his June 30,
2021, security clearance  application  (also known as e-QIP)  in response  to  Section  22  –
Police  Record. “Have  any of the  following  happened?  In  the  last  seven  years have  you
been   issued   a   summons,  citation,  or  ticket  to   appear  in   court  in   a   criminal   proceeding
against  you?   –   In   the   last   seven   years,   have   you   been   arrested   by  any   police   officer,
sheriff, marshal, or any other type  of  law enforcement official?  –  In  the  last seven  years

U.S. court, even  if previously listed  on  this form) –  In  the  last seven  years have  you  been
or  are   you   currently  on   probation   or  parole?   –   Are  you   currently   on   trial  or  awaiting   a
criminal trial on  criminal charges?” Applicant  answered, “No” and  deliberately did not  list
his arrests alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d  and 1.e. (SOR ¶ 3.b” GE  1, Section 22, at 37)
Applicant is also alleged to have intentionally falsified his June 30, 2021, security
clearance  application  in  response  to  “Section  22  –  Police  Record  (EVER)  Other  than
those offenses already listed, have you EVER had the following happen to you . . . Have
you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?” when he answered,
“No.”  He deliberately did not list the offenses listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e and 1.f. (SOR ¶
3.c: GE 1, Section 22, at 37-38)
Finally,  Applicant  is  alleged  to  have  intentionally  falsified  his  June  30,  2021,
security clearance application in response to “Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug
Activity.  In  the  last  seven  years,  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled
substances?  Use of a  drug  or controlled  substance  includes injecting, snorting,  inhaling,
swallowing,  experimenting   with   or   otherwise   consuming   any  drug   or  controlled
substance?”  when he answered  “No.”  He  deliberately failed  to  disclose his illegal use of
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  between  July 2014  to  February 2021.  (SOR ¶  3.d:  GE
1, Section  23, at 38)
In his response to the SOR, Applicant denies the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 3.a – 3.d.
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  having  problems  with  the  e-QIP
program.  He claims he tried to put the correct information into the e-QIP, but the program
would not allow it. He states he never tried to hide his marijuana use. (Tr. 57-61)  During
his background investigation interview, Applicant told the investigator that he did not list
these  events on  his case  papers because  he  thought  they  would  reflect  negatively on
him. (GE 2 at 20)
Whole-Person Factors
Applicant provided  several character references attesting to his good character.
Mr. R., Applicant’s direct supervisor, has worked with Applicant over the past two years.
They no longer work on the same team, but he describes him as “a trustworthy, motivated,
and  hard-working  young  man.”  (AE  A  at  1)  Ms.  N.B.  is  Applicant’s  close  friend  and
neighbor.  She  has  known  Applicant  for  the  past  14  years.  She  states  Applicant  has
consistently  shown  a  commitment  to  “integrity,  leadership,  altruism,  trustworthiness,
reliability, accountability, and hard work, as well as being a great friend that always has
an open ear to listen.” (AE A at 2-4) Applicant’s sister, a former co-worker, and a friend
who served with him on active duty also provided favorable letters attesting to his good
character.  (AE  A  at  5  –  7)  Applicant  also  received  a  certificate  of  appreciation  for  his
support of the Army’s mission. (AE A at 8)

Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct
Applicant visits family and friends in his birth state for about two weeks most years.
Marijuana  use  has  been  legal  in  his  birth  state  since  about  2012.  He  used  marijuana
during his  annual  visits  to his birth  state from  about  November 2017  to  October 2020.
During each of those annual visits he smoked marijuana with his best friend and his best
friend’s  spouse.  He  also  purchased  marijuana-infused  chocolates  (edibles)  and
consumed an edible most nights of each visit to help him sleep. In his December 2020
security clearance  application  (SCA),  Applicant denied  illegally using  or purchasing  any
drug  or controlled  substance  in  the  previous seven  years, and  he  denied  “ever”  illegally
using   or  otherwise  being   illegally  involved   with   a   drug   or  controlled   substance   while
possessing  a  security clearance. (GE  1  at 26-27, GE  2  at 12-13; Answer; Tr. 41, 45-50,
68-69, 76-79)
During a March 2021 interview with a government investigator, Applicant disclosed
that he smoked marijuana during visits to his birth state from 2017 or 2018 to October
2020. He said that he thought it was okay to smoke marijuana there because it was legal
under  state  law.  After  being  informed  that  federal  law  and  DOD  policy  prohibiting
marijuana use applied to security clearance holders even if marijuana use was permitted
under state law, Applicant said that he would not use marijuana again. He said that he
had smoked marijuana two to three times each visit over a period of about two weeks. He
said that he would take one small inhalation of marijuana from an electronic cigarette and
would feel more relaxed. He would sometimes consume marijuana edibles before going
to bed. He purchased edibles in November 2019 for about $30. He said that he ate one
or two of the edibles and left the remaining edibles with his best friend and his best friend’s
spouse. (GE 2 at 12-13)
In his June 2022 response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he ingested marijuana
“only 5-12 days” during each annual visit to his birth state from about November 2017 to
October 2020. (Answer) He said that he used marijuana primarily to help him sleep and
would “eat a single 10 mg edible” before bed. (Id.) He said that he was not “high” from
marijuana  at  any  time,  was  always  in  command  of  his  faculties,  did  not  disclose  any
sensitive information, never left his friends’ house while under the influence of marijuana,
and was never around anybody that he did not know or trust. (Id.) After learning that he
was  not  permitted  to  use  marijuana  in  his  birth  state,  he  did  not  consume  anything
containing marijuana, and told his friends that he was prohibited from using marijuana.
His friends “respected it and not only didn’t offer [him] any, but even went outside anytime
they wanted to use [marijuana].” (Id.) He said that he purchased a single pack of about
15  marijuana edibles in  November 2019. “The  people I was with  only smoked, and  did
not take edibles, so I needed to purchase them myself. Any chocolates remaining once
the trip was over, I left up there.” (Id.)
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  first  used  marijuana  in  about
November  2017  “just  on  a  whim  [he]  decided  .  .  .  I’m  hanging  out  with  some  friends,
having  trouble sleeping, here let me  try.”  (Tr. 49, 68) He normally stayed with his best
friend and his best friend’s spouse for seven to nine nights during each 12 to 13 day visit
and spent the other nights with various family members. While staying in his friend’s home
and playing video games with them, he would “take maybe a single hit [of marijuana] from
one  of the  little vape  pens”  once or twice per visit. (Tr. 48-49, 77) He said that he had
difficulty sleeping throughout the entirety of his visits so he consumed a single marijuana
edible before going to bed every night except for the first and last night of his trip, including
nights he stayed with family members. (Tr. 49, 78-79) He  purchased  edibles “one  time
per visit . . . [a]bout four times” and would leave any unused edibles with his best friend.
(Tr. 79)
Applicant was aware that the use of marijuana was prohibited under federal law
since  at  least  2013,  when  he  received  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  46)  He  said  that  he
“wasn’t aware that [he] was being held specifically to federal [law] rather than, you know,
state exceptions” and believed that he could legally use marijuana if it was legal under
state law. (Tr. 47)  Since  learning that he was prohibited from using marijuana he has
visited and stayed with his best friend and his best friend’s spouse. (AE D at 2) After he
told them that he was prohibited from using marijuana with a security clearance, “they
were very considerate and instead of using their vapes or  whatever inside, they'd step
out on the porch to use it, and [he] would of course if [he] was outside at that time, [he]'d
go back in just to avoid any secondhand issues.” (Tr. 41)
Applicant  submitted  a  signed  statement  of  his  intent  to  abstain  from  drug
involvement at the hearing. (AE B; Tr. 69) He also provided results from seven urinalyses
dated from March 2021 to February 2023 that tested negative for illegal substances. (AE
A;  Tr.  70)  He  testified  that  the  results  were  from  unscheduled  urinalyses  that  he  was
required to take every 3-6 months, as part of the process to refill a pain medication that
he had been prescribed for a shoulder injury since late 2020. (Tr. 70-71)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges that, as of January 2021, Applicant had enrolled approximately
$42,898 of debt into a debt resolution program and that the debt remained delinquent. In
his  Answer,  Applicant  acknowledged  incurring  debts  but  said  that  he  had  resolved  all
delinquent  accounts.  He  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  unanticipated  expenses
including  replacement  of  home  heating  and  air  conditioning  systems  and  a  hot  water
heater,  repair costs  for flooding  damage, fence  repairs  for damage  caused  by  a  fallen
tree, and his pets’ health issues.
Applicant disclosed his financial difficulties and that he was working with  a debt
consolidation  company  (DCC)  in  his  2020  SCA.  He  discussed  specific  details  of  each
debt and his debt resolution efforts during his background interview. He said that over a
period  of  several  years  he  had  accrued  delinquent  debt  because  of  unexpected
expenses. He was current on his debts but could only afford minimum payments on some
debts and continued to fall behind.
In  about  October  2019,  he  entered  an  agreement  with  a  DCC  to  negotiate
settlements with some creditors and was told to stop making payments on those debts.
By  March  2021,  the  DCC  had  resolved  most  delinquent  debts  with  funds  deposited
monthly  ($584)  by  Applicant.  In  March  2021,  he  obtained  a  debt  consolidation  loan
($24,413),  and  the  DCC  used  the  loan  proceeds  to  resolve  his  remaining  delinquent
debts. He has been current on all credit accounts since then and, as of May 26, 2023,
had reduced the debt consolidation loan balance to $12,363 by making required monthly
payments. He said that he had made all required monthly payments on a home mortgage
since  October  2016.  Documentary  evidence  including  credit  reports  from  December
2020,  June  2022  and  May  2023  corroborate  Applicant’s  claims  and  testimony.  These
debts are resolved. (Answer; GE 1-8; AE C; Tr. 41-43, 50-55, 72-75)

Applicant submitted letters from his cohabitant for the past seven years, and two
friends
reliability,
trustworthiness,  adherence  to  laws  and  rules,  career  focus,  and  commitment  to
safeguarding  sensitive  information.  Each  letter  also  noted  that  Applicant  was  unaware
that  his use  of  marijuana  in  a  state  where  marijuana  use  was  legal was  prohibited  for
DOD security clearance holders, that once he learned otherwise he abstained from using
marijuana and told them about the prohibition, and each recommended that he retain his
security clearance. His cohabitant, a Master Level Clinical Mental Health Counselor and
certified alcohol and drug counselor with six years of experience in addiction treatment,
offered her personal but unofficial assessment that  Applicant did not meet the criteria of
someone suffering from any form of substance abuse or drug dependence, and that he
has not demonstrated symptoms of a substance misuse problem. (AE C-E)
Applicant’s  regional  service  manager  testified  and  authored  documents  that
commented  favorably  about  his  work  performance,  sobriety  at  work,  reliability,
trustworthiness,  and  compliance  with  rules  and  regulations  regarding  safeguarding
classified information. He testified that Applicant had a security clearance and access to
classified  information,  and  that  he  had  communicated  the  issues  with  his  security
clearance renewal process including his marijuana use. (Tr. 28-39; AE G-H)
Any  derogatory  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  considered  for

e-QIP  by  intentionally  failing  to  disclose  his  marijuana  use  in  about  October  2020;  by
intentionally failing to disclose his 2020 marijuana while possessing a security clearance;
and  that  he  falsified  his  October  1,  2019,  e-QIP  by  intentionally  failing  to  disclose  his
marijuana use from approximately May 2016 to December 2018.
Applicant,  26,  is a  senior information  technology consultant  currently  employed  by
a  defense  contractor since  November 2019. He received  his bachelor’s degree  in   May
2019. (GX 3.)
Applicant completed his first e-QIP in 2019. He answered “No” to the question that
asked if he had used any illegal drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years.
He was granted a secret security clearance in November 2019. (GX 3; GX 4.)
On  his February 2021  e-QIP  in response  to  the  same  question  about his drug  use
in the  last  seven  years, Applicant stated  that he  used  THC (marijuana) “less than  three
times in college” and  listed  his dates of use  as May 2016  (estimated) to  December 2018.
When  asked  to  provide  an  explanation  of why he  did  not intend  to  use  marijuana  in the
future,  Applicant stated  “I will/have  not been  using  this drug  prior to  my initial employment
due  to  security clearance  regulations that THC is an  illegal substance  per governmental
law.” (GX 1.)
On  March 23, 2021, Applicant underwent a  personal subject  interview (PSI) as part
of his background investigation. He verified the investigator’s summary of the interview in
response  to  DOHA’s interrogatories on  April 6, 2022. During  his PSI,  Applicant told the
investigator the  information  on  his February 2021  e-QIP  was accurate  except that he  also
used  marijuana  one  more time  in  October 2020  while  possessing  a  security clearance.
He stated  that he  did not know why he  did not  list this most recent use. He  then  stated  he
“did  not report this most recent use  to  his organization  because  he  did not know what the
repercussions  would  have  on  his job  status.” He further stated  that he  “wasn’t  told  what
the  reporting  requirements were  and  was therefore not sure if he  would be  required  to
report his use  to his organization.” (GX 2.)
In his answer to the amended SOR, Applicant stated:
In  2019,  I completed  an  e-QIP  for my first professional job. It  was  the  first
time  I had  applied  for a  security clearance. I did  not disclose  that I had  used
marijuana  between  2016  and  2018. . . . I blame  my own omission  on  my
ignorance  of the  process as well as my failure to  pay attention  to  detail when
completing  such  forms. At the  time, I did not fully understand  the  significant
consequences   my   actions  could   have   on   my  future   and   my  ability  to
progress   in  my   chosen   field.  I  did  not   receive  an   in-brief  at   my   new  job
explaining the e-QIP process and  the pitfalls.
From   2016   to   2018,  I   was  in  my  first  few  years  of  college,  and   I  used
marijuana  with  friends.  I was young  and  immature and  not thinking  about
how  my  decisions   could  negatively   impact  my   future.  The   use   was
infrequent  and   never   resulted   in  anyone   questioning   my  judgment,
character, or reliability.
Applicant further stated, “the 2020 use was an outlier and not consistent with my
behavior and 2020.”
I was put in  for a  higher level fill  out another e-QIP  when  I completed  the  e-
QIP on February 26, 2021, I unintentionally omitted my use of marijuana in
October 2020.  . .  . During  my interview with  the  investigator, I realized  I had
omitted  the  2020  use  when  completing  the  e-QIP  and  I reported  it. I did so
because  my failure to  include  the  information  on  the  form  was an  oversight.
It was not intentional. .  . .
During his testimony, Applicant stated:
And  when  it came  to  the  marijuana  section, I  mean  at the  time  I  was right
out of college, I was scared  if I were  to  say yes or no. What does that mean
if I were  to  get rejected?  That’s a  huge  impact on  my  job, right.  So  I think
not understanding  the  process and  being  truthful in your answers, no  matter
what that is if it’s going  to negatively impact you  are not a  thing that’s really
the  main thing. (Tr. 23.)
So  during  the  time,  so  my interview,  if I  recall, was back in  2021. And  during
the  time, I was answering  all  the  questions… And  she  asked  if I recall  doing
marijuana. Have  I  ever  done  it?  And  I  was,  like, yes.  I have  done  it in  2016
and  2018,  throughout  college,  very briefly, periodically. I was, again, I  was
a  college  student.  . . . I was very busy all  the  time, but I say I maybe  did it
twice a year. (Tr. 24.)
So  that’s something  that I, looking  back on, if  I were to  go and resubmit the
form  again, no  matter what I’ve  done, parking  tickets,  if I’ve  gotten  arrested,
you  have  to  put it on  there. You  can’t lie  about  that.  Because  there’s always
ways to  find  that out, whether it’s in the court  or if there sifting through your
friends. There’s always  ways to  find  things. So  I think it’s just  the  right thing
to do, is just be honest and truthful. (Tr. 25.)
During cross-examination, the following exchange occurred:
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: When you completed your first e-QIP in October of
2019, you did not disclose your marijuana use while in college.
APPLICANT: Yes, sir.
DEPARTMENT   COUNSEL:  And   you’re   saying   it’s  because   you   breezed
through the form  and  missed  the questions about that?
APPLICANT: Breezed through the form and then just being nervous about
submitting the, well, if I were to say yes, I had smoked marijuana from 2016
to  2018  when  I  graduated,  I  would  be  scared  of  that.  That  was  going  to
impact my ability to obviously move from [my former state of residence], and
start a new life, and working in this field, so yes.
DEPARTMENT   COUNSEL:  Okay.  So  you  chose  not  to  include  that
information, because you were concerned it would affect your chances of
getting a job?
APPLICANT: Yes, sir. (Tr. 39.)
While  holding  a  security  clearance,  Applicant  used  marijuana  in  October  2020
while attending a party:
APPLICANT’S ATTORNEY: So even at the party, did you realize how stupid
you were?
APPLICANT:  Yes.  So   admittedly  I   took  a   couple   of   hits  of  it,   and   I
immediately  realized   –   and   I   jumped,  what  are  you   doing?   Why  are   you
doing this? So I immediately removed  myself from the situation. There was
[sic] people  that  were  around  me  that they  were  mutual friends  or  friends of
friends. And  I was,  like,  why am  I  doing  this? Like,  if I were to  get caught,  or
if somebody were to find out about this, that’s not good. (Tr. 26.)
When   asked   by  Department  Counsel  if  he   was  aware   that  holding   a   security
clearance  meant that he  could  not use  marijuana  or  other illegal substances,  Applicant
stated, “I  did understand that, to  be  honest, at the time. I did.” (Tr. 42.)
The following  exchange regarding Applicant’s failure to  disclose his October 2020
marijuana   use   while  holding   a   security  clearance   on   his  2021   e-QIP   occurred   during
cross-examination:
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: And this form was filled out February 2021.
APPLICANT: Yes, sir.
DEPARTMENT   COUNSEL:   Approximately  four  months  after  you  used
marijuana at the party.
APPLICANT: Yes, sir.
DEPARTMENT  COUNSEL: You did not list that marijuana use on this form.
Why not?
APPLICANT: Again, I’d  say it’s negligence, the  process, and  being  afraid of
what the  ramifications would be  if I were to  say yes on  this occurrence  in
October that I did use  marijuana for -- I did use marijuana.
So  again,  like  I’ve  said  before,  being  not  mature  to  the  process,  not
understanding the ramifications I would have behind that if I were to submit
fictitious or false information, or hide the information, what it would have on
my career.
So  going  back,  if  I  were  to  go  back,  if  I  had  the  ability,  I  would  say  yes,
absolutely, I did do that.
Because  again,  I  think  with  the  maturity  and  where  I’m  at  now  in
understanding  the  process,  that  is  my  due  diligence,  and  that’s  the  right
thing to do. But that’s my response, sir.
DEPARTMENT  COUNSEL: So just so you understand, we want to know if
your omission of that fact was deliberate or intentional. And it sounds like it
was deliberate that you, on purpose left that information off of this form. Is
that correct?
APPLICANT: Yes, sir.
DEPARTMENT   COUNSEL:   So your claims of  making mistakes, or being
negligent in filling out this form, aren't really accurate, then.
APPLICANT: I wouldn’t say that.
DEPARTMENT   COUNSEL:   Well,  we discussed earlier,  the first form  you
filled  out,  the  first  clearance  you  filled  out,  you  didn’t  list  the  information
about your college drug use, because you were afraid you would get the
clearance. Is that right?
APPLICANT: Yes, sir.
DEPARTMENT  COUNSEL: And then the second form you filled out, you
didn’t  list  the  fact  that  you  used  marijuana  at  a  party  while  holding  a
clearance, because you were afraid of the consequences.
APPLICANT: Yes, sir.
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Is that right?
APPLICANT: Yes, sir. That’s correct.
DEPARTMENT   COUNSEL:  So  it  was  a  willful  omission,  it  wasn’t  just
negligence. Is that correct?
APPLICANT: No.  It  was willful, but to  be  honest,  that’s  something  I  honestly
even   buried,  because   I  wasn’t   there  for  an   extended   use   of  time   using
marijuana.  I  literally,  I   buried   it.   And   is  that   the   right  thing   to   do?   No,   of
course  not.   But   was  it  intentional  to   leave   it  off   there,  to   answer  your
question, yes, I did intentionally leave it off there, off the form.
DEPARTMENT   COUNSEL:  And   do   you   understand   why  that’s  more
significant  to  us than  using marijuana three times in college?
APPLICANT: Yeah, absolutely. Because, I mean, while having  a  clearance,
and  if  you’re  going  to  lie  about  that,  I  mean,  that  doesn’t  show
trustworthiness and  that somebody who  holds a  clearance, like, what  else
am   I  going   to   lie   about,   right?   So   trust  me,  I   completely  understand   that
process now. So, yes, I understand.
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So why should we believe you now?
APPLICANT: Again, this is something  that I have  -- this has been  sitting  on
me  for  over  a  year  now, since  this  has gone down.  And I think  it goes back
to   my  maturity  of   understanding
the   process   and   having   more
responsibilities now. I’d  say it’s the  responsibility aspect of it and  where I’ve
grown professionally and  maturity-wise.
I  think  it’s  -- again,  that  was  something  that  I  should  have  disclosed,  of
course.  But  I  did  not.  And  that  was  just  due  to  being  afraid  of  the
ramifications and what’s going to happen after that. So that’s it. (Tr. 47-50.)
Applicant  stated  in  his  PSI,  in  his answer  to  the  amended  SOR,  and  during  his
testimony that he does not associate with people who use illegal drugs. (GX 2; Tr. 27.)
Applicant started  college  in 2016  at  a  private  then-college  now university,  in his
home   state.   In   describing   his  college   background   during   direct   examination,  Applicant
stated:
But,   yeah,  so   during   that  four  years,  I  played   baseball   in  college.  I  took
around  18  to  21  credit  hours a  semester because, obviously baseball, it’s
like  a  full-time  job  itself. And  then  also I did have  a  full-time  job  to  provide
for myself as well, because  obviously being  in  college, I mean, I never got
a handout, right. (Tr. 15-16.)
When   asked   by  his  attorney  what  year  he   graduated,  Applicant  stated,
“2019, May 2019.” (Tr. 16.)
The following exchange occurred during cross-examination:
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: What was your GPA [in college]?
APPLICANT: So my graduate GPA, I believe, was 3.5, 3.5 or 3.6.
DEPARTMENT   COUNSEL:  Did  you  maintain  a  3.5  GPA  while  playing
baseball all four years?
APPLICANT: Yes, sir. (Tr. 38.)
However, on  his 2019  and  2021  e-QIPs, Applicant listed  his  college  attendance
dates  as  August 2015  to  May  2019  and  answered  “No” in  response  to  the  question  that
asked  whether or not he  received  a  degree/diploma. Under the  heading  “EDUCATION”
in the  summary of Applicant’s March 2021  PSI,  it states that Applicant volunteered  that
he  attended the university he listed  on his e-QIPs from  August 2015 until May 2019, “but
was  issued   the   bachelor’s  degree   in  December 2020.” He   told   the   investigator   that he
was not sure why he listed this information incorrectly on  his e-QIP. (GX 3; GX 1; GX  3.)
Under  the   heading   “DEVELOPED  EDUCATION,”  the   PSI   summary  states   that
Applicant volunteered  that  from  June  2019  until December 2020  he  attended  an  online
university.   Applicant  explained   that  he   did   not  know  why  he   did  not  list  the   additional
university.  He  explained  that  he  took  courses  at the  online  university because  they  were
less expensive. He then transferred the credits to  his original University which issued  his
bachelor’s  degree.  He   completed   his  coursework  online   while   working   for  his  current
employer. Applicant’s resume lists his education as having received  a bachelor’s degree
from  the  original  university he  attended  but does not list  the  date  of  graduation. (GX  2;
AX D.)
Above   the   signature  line   on   the   e-QIPs  that   Applicant  completed   and   signed   in
2019   and   2021   is   a   paragraph   entitled   “Certification.”   The   paragraph   contains   the
following language:
My  statements  on   this  form,   and   on   any  attachments  to   it,  are   true,
complete,  and  correct to  the  best of my knowledge  and  belief  and  are made
in good  faith. . . . I understand  that a  knowing  and  willful false statement on
this  form   can   be   punished   by  a   fine   or  imprisonment  or  both   (18   U.S.C.
1001).
intentionally  withholding,  misrepresenting,
falsifying, or including  classified  information  may have  a  negative  effect on
my  security  clearance,  employment  prospects,   or  job   status,  up   to   and
including   denial   or  revocation   of  my   security  clearance,   or  removal  and
department from Federal service.
I  understand
that
The   chief  executive   officer,  who   also  serves  as  the   facility  security  officer  at
Applicant’s place  of employment,   strongly supports Applicant’s  maintaining  his security
clearance, citing  his exceptional performance  in servicing  the  company’s clients.  In  his
letter of recommendation, he states:
I  have   read   the   DOHA   report  and   that  [Applicant]  made   errors  in  his
reporting;  I  understand   the   errors  made   and   have   counseled   him   on
ensuring that his documentation is accurate  and  timely. (AX A.)
A  vice  president  for  over  13  years  at  Applicant’s  place  of  employment,  who
considers  himself  a  close  mentor  to  Applicant  who  has  guided  him  throughout  his
professional  career,  also  strongly  recommends  that  Applicant  maintain  his  security
clearance. In his letter of recommendation, the vice president states:
I’ve   seen   many  young   individuals  make   many  mistakes  similar  to   what
[Applicant]  did and  I have  had  the  opportunity to  assist them  in correcting
these   mistakes.  In   [Applicant’s]   case,  I   firmly  agree   that   it  was   a   simple
mistake that he  made  and  has learned a valuable lesson. (AX B.)
Applicant’s 2021 and 2022 annual performance reviews rated him as outstanding.
Since he informed his employer about the issues with his security clearance, Applicant
has been assigned the tasks of conducting security awareness training and of assisting
new-hires in completing their e-QIPs. (AX E; Tr. 21-22.)
Applicant’s fiancée stated in her letter of recommendation that she and Applicant
have been together for eight years and were soon to be married. She describes Applicant
as kind, considerate, thoughtful, and as a person who radiates care towards everyone he
encounters. She describes their daily life together and their hope for a family in the future
where they will fill their household with “honesty, integrity, and fulfillment.” (AX C.)
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. He is a high school graduate. He married in 2016 and
has  no  children.  He  was  employed  by  a  in  the  private  sector  from  2016  to  November
2021, when he was hired by a federal contractor.
Applicant completed a National Security Questionnaire (SF 86) in June 2022. In it
he  disclosed  that  from  January  through  May  2019,  he  used  a  vape  pen  containing
tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC),  a  federally  controlled  substance  that  is  the  principal
psychoactive  ingredient  in  marijuana.  He  occasionally  used  it  on  his  day  off  or  on  the
weekends to relax and sleep. He estimated that during this period he used it between 30
and 50 times. He reported that he enjoyed the relaxing aspect of the drug but did not like
the impact it had on his motivation and drive. He was also hiding it from his wife at the
time, and that ruined any enjoyment or relaxation he gained from using it. He does not
intend to use illegal drugs in the future. It was illegal where he was using it at the time.
(GE 3)
Applicant also disclosed on his SF 86 that from August 2021 to September 2021
he used his wife’s prescription of Flexeril, a muscle relaxant. He explained he injured his
back  while  doing  yard  work  and  used  two  to  three  pills  for  several  week  of  his  wife’s
prescription that she did not intend to use.  He used approximately 10-15 total pills. He
disclosed  to  the  government  investigator  In  July  2022,  that  he  previously  had  his own
prescription for the drug but ran out. In his SOR answer, he explained that although he
previously  had  a  prescription  for  this  drug,  he  understands  the  use  of  his  wife’s
prescription  was  unacceptable.  He  has  no  intention  to  ever  use  this  substance  again
without a valid prescription. (GE 2, 3, 4)
Applicant disclosed on his SF 86 that in May 2022, he used two pills of his wife’s
prescription for Tramadol over a two-day period when his allergies were bad. He stated
in  his  SOR  answer  that  at  one  time  he  had  a  valid  prescription  for  Tramadol  for  his
allergies and migraines so was aware of its benefits, but he understood that his use of his
wife’s  prescription  was  unacceptable.  He  has  sought  medical  treatment  for  his  severe
allergies. He has no intention of ever use this substance again without a valid prescription.
(GE 2, 3, 4)
",True
"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  His  admissions  are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 24 years old. He graduated from high school in 2017 and college in
2020. He is not married and has no children. He has worked for a federal contractor since
2020. (Tr. 106-107; GE 1)
Applicant was employed during the summers as an intern for different companies
while he was in college. Since he was a young boy, his dream was to work as an engineer
in  aerospace  and  be  on  the  cutting  edge  of  the  newest  technology.  He  was  focused
throughout high school to achieve that goal. He was valedictorian of his class and went
on to a prestigious college, where he graduated with a degree in aerospace engineering
Summa Cum Laude. He did not use drugs in high school and consumed alcohol on a
minimal basis. At college, he consumed alcohol in moderation and not to excess. (Tr. 83-
GE 3)
Applicant  completed  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
January 2020. As part of the process, he participated in a drug test, testing negative. He
did not report any drug use in his SF 86. He completed the SF 86 so he could work as an
intern for a federal contractor. (Tr. 84; Answer to SOR, Tab C)
In Applicant’s SOR answer and his testimony, he stated that during his sophomore
year of college he lived with three men, two of whom used marijuana daily. He was offered
it daily and declined. He estimated he declined their offers more than 300 times. (GE 2;
Answer to SOR, Tab C)
Applicant’s sister was using marijuana  daily. During  his senior year of college  in
March or April 2020, he and his mother went to visit his sister in another state where she
was  living.  His  sister  begged  him  to  try  marijuana  and  told  him  there  were  no
consequences. In an effort to reconnect with his sister, he used marijuana out of curiosity.
It was legal in the state where he used it. He did not enjoy it. (Tr. 85-86; GE 3; Answer to
SOR, Tab C)
In 2020, Applicant’s parents were going through a divorce. Due to the pandemic,
they were still living together in the family home. Applicant was also living at home at the
time and was unable to escape the conflict because of the lockdown. He felt pressured
by each parent. They were in the process of selling the family home where he grew up
and had his childhood memories. He  was eager to move back to school and did so in
September 2020. He intended on graduating early and because it was difficult to rent a
house for less than 12 months, he decided to live in the basement of a friend’s house.
When  he  arrived  and  moved  in,  sight  unseen,  he  realized  he  made  a  mistake.  The
basement was not finished and had concrete dust raining down from the ceiling, which
would wake him as it covered his nose and mouth. He moved out a week later and moved
in  with  a  good  friend  who  lived  in  another  town  and  had  three  roommates.  These
roommates  used  marijuana  extensively.  About  two  weeks  later,  Applicant  and  his
roommates were in lockdown due to one of the roommates testing positive for Covid. Two
weeks  later  another  tested  positive,  another  week  and  a  different  roommate  tested
positive.  Applicant  stated  there  was  nothing  to  do  during  lockdown  except  eat,  sleep,
study, and hang out. He admitted during this time, he gave into the pressure and used
marijuana with varying frequency (12-16 times) for about 13-15 weeks. He again used it
one time in December 2020, as he prepared to move to a new state. It was legal in the
state where he used it. (Tr. 86-90; GE 3; Answer to SOR, Tab C)
After graduating college in December 2020, Applicant moved to a new state eager
to  start  his  career,  but  he  found  out  that  the  position  he  had  accepted  was  no  longer
available, and he was placed in a different position. He was not provided a workstation
and  was  required to  work remotely.  He  was not given many tasks and  was  bored. He
began  to  seriously  question  whether  he  made  the  correct  career  choice  and  if  those
avenues even existed for him any longer. While taking full responsibility for his conduct,
he stated that these circumstances contributed to his poor judgment when, in July 2021,
he used marijuana again with his sister, on her birthday. It was legal in the state where
he used it. (Tr. 90-91, 104; Answer to SOR, Tab C)
In  October  2021,  Applicant  contracted  Covid.  Due  to  the  company’s  vaccine
requirements, he had two weeks to get the vaccine. He attempted to get a medical waiver
due to recently having  Covid, but  it was denied.  He got the  vaccine  but  had a  serious
negative reaction because he got it too close to having the virus. This incident made him
question  his  future  with  the  company  and  contributed  to  his  stress  level.  He  also  had
totaled his vehicle while driving from where he worked to his home state, which left him
stranded.  He  explained  that  these  stressors  contributed  to  him  using  marijuana  in
December 2021, when he used his sister’s marijuana vape pen. (Tr. 104; Answer to SOR,
Tab C)
Applicant was granted a secret security clearance in 2020 while he was working
as an intern. In late 2021, he was read into a special access program (SAP). At the time
he used marijuana in December 2021, he did not officially work in the program, but he
testified that the SAP involved access to classified information. He began working in the
program in January 2022. (Tr. 90-91)
Applicant’s perspective  changed  once  he  began  to  work in a  program  where he
was able to use his skills and was given responsibilities. He was realizing his childhood
dreams. He also began to understand the seriousness of handling sensitive and classified
information.  Before  then,  he  was  a  young  college  kid  with  a  clearance,  without  a  true
understanding of its importance. He was now a member of a program with a sworn duty
to protect secrets.  He testified that once he started working in the  SAP, he had a real
appreciation for the seriousness and importance of holding a security clearance. This was
not something that was emphasized when he was initially granted a clearance. (Tr. 91-
94; Answer to the SOR, Tab C)
Applicant  has  a  new perspective  and  understanding  of  the  highs  and  lows  of  a
career  path.  He  believes  a  myriad  of  circumstances  negatively  influenced  him  which
contributed  to  him  using  poor  judgment.  He  never  had  a  desire  to  use  marijuana,  but
circumstances influenced him. He is now in a position where he has more control over
where he lives and who he associates with. He credibly testified that he is shocked that
he used marijuana without considering the consequences. He has participated in therapy
regarding  his parents’  divorce.  He  felt  like  he  was  the  glue  holding  his family  together
when they were all living together during the pandemic. Both parents were leaning on him
and relying on him, which was stressful. (Tr. 94-97, 104-105; Answer to the SOR, Tab C)
Applicant’s sister  stopped  using  marijuana  when she became pregnant and has
not resumed since giving birth. He testified that she has abstained from drugs, alcohol,
and nicotine for over two years. His current roommate is also an employee with the same
federal  contractor  and  holds  a  security  clearance.  His  roommate  does  not  use  illegal
drugs and has not witnessed Applicant using any. Applicant started an initiative to cease
consumption  of  alcohol  for an  extended  period  and  did  so  for eight  months.  It  was  an
exercise in discipline. He did not overindulge before but wanted to challenge himself. He
sought drug counseling to evaluate whether he had any drug or alcohol-related issues.
None were detected and he was advised that no further treatment was recommended.
Most of his friends work for federal contractors and do not use illegal drugs. His few close
friends  from  high  school  do  not  use  illegal  drugs.  He  credibly  testified  that  he  never
intends to use illegal drugs again. (Tr. 97-98, 100-101, 108-112; Answer to SOR, Tabs D
and E)
In January 2022, Applicant completed another SF 86. In it he disclosed his prior
marijuana use. After submission of the SF 86, on his own volition, he took a drug test to
demonstrate  his  level  of  commitment  to  remain  drug-free.  The  test  was  negative.
Applicant  was  unaware  that  he  was  required  to  report his drug  use.  Once  he  became
aware, he notified his security manager. (Tr. 85, 99; GE 1; Answer to SOR, Tab E)
Five witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. They were his current roommate,
one whom he currently works for, and two with whom he has worked with, and a friend.
They have known him both professionally and personally. Essentially, they all provided
the  same  positive  comments,  noting  he  is  reliable,  trustworthy  and  exercises  good
judgment and provided examples. There is no evidence that he currently associates with
known drug users. They reported that he works well under pressure and manages stress
on  the  job  by  working  hard  to  find  a  solution  to  the  problem.  All,  except  one,  holds  a
security clearance. All recommended Applicant retain his. (Tr. 23-81, 99-101)
Applicant provided character letters, which stated he was a good citizen, patriot,
intelligent, mature, respectful, and trustworthy. He follows rules and regulations and is a
person of integrity. (Answer to SOR, Tab D)
Applicant provided a signed statement of intent not to use any illegal drugs in the
future and  any  violation  will constitute  grounds  for automatic  revocation of  his security
clearance. (Tr. 101-102; Answer to SOR, Tab E).

"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer, with explanations. He is
24  years  old.  As  of  his  May  2022  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  he  was  not
married,  he  did  not  have  any  children,  and  he  had  lived  with  his  parents  and  two
younger siblings since December 2021. He graduated from high school in 2017. While
in college, he interned for his employer, a DOD contractor, from May 2019 to July 2019,
May  2020  to  August  2020,  and  May  2021  to  August  2021.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s
degree  in  December  2021.  He  was  subsequently  briefly  unemployed  before  working
part-time in data entry for a recruiting agency from February 2022 to April 2022. He has
worked  as  a  cyber  systems  engineer  associate  for  his  current  employer  since  May
2022. He was first granted a security clearance  in approximately May 2020, as part of
his internships. (Items 1-3)
Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from  approximately  2017
through  May  2021.  He  continued  to  use  marijuana  through  May  2021,  after  he  was
granted  a  security  clearance  in  May  2020.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  He  began  using  marijuana  in
college in 2017. He smoked it weekly with his college roommates and friends to relax.
He contributed money towards the purchase of it. He did not use marijuana during his
summer breaks from college when he lived at home, before he began his internship with
his employer and passed a pre-employment drug screening, or during the summers of
his  internship.  He  stopped  using  marijuana  because  he  realized  he  had  grown  out  of
such  college  behavior,  and  he  did  not  want  to  use  it  anymore.  He  disclosed  this
information  during  his  July  2022  background  interview.  (Answer;  Items  1-2;  FORM
Response)
Applicant did not disclose his drug involvement in response to section 23 of both
his October 2019 SCA and his 2022 SCA, which inquired about illegal use of drugs or
drug activity. He marked “No,” and did not disclose his marijuana use in response to a
question  on  both  SCAs  that  inquired  whether  he  had  illegally  used  any  drug  or
controlled substances in the last seven years. He also marked “No” on his 2022 SCA, in
response  to  a  question  that  inquired  whether  he  had  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise
been illegally involved with a drug or controlled  substance while possessing a  security
clearance,  and  he  did  not  disclose  his  use  of  marijuana  while  holding  a  security
clearance.  He  disclosed  on  his  2022  SCA  that  he  had  a  security  clearance  that  was
granted to him in May 2020. (Answer; Item 3)
Applicant  indicated  during  his  background  interview  that  he  did  not  disclose  his
marijuana use on his 2019 SCA because he thought it would affect his ability to obtain a
security clearance. He also indicated that he intended to disclose his marijuana use on
his 2022 SCA by correcting his negative responses from his 2019 SCA, but he forgot to
do so. (Item 2)
In March 2023, Applicant signed a statement of intent stating, “I have no intention
of smoking marijuana, or consuming any other controlled substances, presently or in the
future.” He expressed his regret and remorse over his actions. He stated that he is more
mature  and  regrets  that  his  actions  have  jeopardized  his  work.  He  stated  that  he  no
longer  socializes  with  the  friends  from  college  with  whom  he  used  marijuana.  He
reiterated that he did not disclose his marijuana use on his 2019 SCA because he was
afraid that it would affect his chances of obtaining his internship. He admitted that he did
not disclose his marijuana use on his 2022 SCA because he was afraid it would affect
his job. He stated:

Two  individuals,  a  professional  associate  as  well  as  a  friend  from  college,
attested  to  Applicant’s  trustworthiness,  reliability,  and  judgment.  The  professional

"Applicant  admitted  all of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  His  admissions  have  been
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  37  years  old.  He  completed  training  as  an  emergency  medical
technician  in  2005  but  was  unable  to  find  a  job  in  his  field  because  he  did  not  have
experience.  He  was  married  from  2005  to  2006,  which  ended  in  divorce.  He  does  not
have children. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor. since January
2022. (Tr. 32-35; GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  in  about  2016,  after  his  father  passed  away,  he  began
consuming alcohol excessively. He would drink to intoxication regularly. He would go to
bars and have four to five drinks. He kept a bottle of liquor in his car in case he went out
and did not want to pay for expensive drinks at a bar. (Tr. 42-44, 59)
Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in March 2021.
He took a breathalyzer and recorded .216% and .221%. Applicant testified that he had
consumed liquor in his vehicle after a difficult day at work. He drank it in a parking lot.
While driving, there was a tire tread in the road, and he swerved and lost control of his
vehicle. He was told he hit a post but did not recall that he did. He was arrested a short
time later at a fast-food restaurant. He admitted he was intoxicated when he was arrested.
He also had in his possession some pills that were prescribed to him, but the prescription
was expired, and he had put them in a smaller container that was unmarked. (Tr. 44-48;
GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant  pled  guilty  to  the  DUI  offense,  and  the  charge  of  possession  of  an
unmarked expired prescription was withdrawn. He was given 18 months’ probation, a fine,
court-ordered alcohol and drug counseling, and he was required to have an interlock on
his vehicle for 12 months. He completed all the terms of the probation. (Tr. 48-49; GE 6;
AE B)
Applicant credibly testified that this was a wakeup call for him, and he never wanted
to spend another day in jail. He essentially stopped consuming alcohol after his arrest
and has only had three or four drinks since then at family gatherings. He no longer wants
to drink alcohol and has declined it numerous times when offered. He viewed his arrest
as a life-changing event. (Tr. 35-40)
Applicant participated and completed alcohol and drug counseling as  mandated
by the court. He was an outpatient and participated in group therapy. He found it very
helpful and was provided alternatives to handing stress. He does not crave alcohol. (Tr.
57-58; GE 5, 6)
Applicant  testified  that he  was  in a  toxic relationship  with  his fiancée  during  the
time he was drinking. His mother was ill and passed away in May 2022. He and his fiancée
broke up and that has had a positive effect on him. He is an only child, and he inherited
his mother’s  house.  He  spends his time  working  on  the  house.  He  also has been  in a
stable  relationship  for the  past  six months.  His  girlfriend  does  not  consume  alcohol  or
drugs.  Through  his  commitment  to  moderate  his  consumption  he  has  not  had  any
problems related to alcohol. He does not have any in his house, except some cooking
wine. He has had no other alcohol-related incidents and does not foresee any in his future
because of his abstinence. (Tr. 38-40, 49-52, 54)
In about June 2021, Applicant was prescribed medical marijuana, which is legal in
the state where he lives. He would purchase it about twice a month. When he completed
his security clearance application (SCA), he did not disclose his use because he viewed
it as a prescription drug, and it was not illegal in his state. When he was confronted by
the investigator, he readily admitted he used medical marijuana and was unaware that it
was illegal under federal law. He believed he was answering the drug questions on his
SCA  truthfully.  I  find  he  did  not  deliberately  fail  to  disclose  his  illegal  drug  use  under
federal law. (Tr. 40-42, 50-52; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  testified  that  he  had  been  using  medical  marijuana  regularly  for
relaxation, anxiety, to help him sleep, and pain management. He explained that at one
time he weighed more than 500 pounds and lost weight through surgery. He developed
back pain due to his weight and that was one of the reasons for his marijuana use. He
admitted he did not stop using it immediately after learning it was illegal because he was
weaning himself off it. During this March 2022 interview with a government investigator,
he said he would prefer not to relinquish his medical marijuana card, and he intended to
use marijuana in the future. He also said that he was willing to cease using it to keep his
job. At his hearing, he credibly stated that he will not use marijuana in the future and will
find  alternative means for controlling  his issues.  He  stopped using  it  about  six months
ago. He said he is willing to destroy his medical marijuana card and not renew it. He fully
understands the importance of remaining drug free.  Applicant credibly testified that his
life  has  turned  around,  and  he  is  ready  to  move  forward.  Post-hearing,  he  provided  a
shredded copy of his medical marijuana card to show in good faith he did not intend to
use marijuana again or renew his prescription. (Tr. 42, 50-51, 54-57; GE 2; AE C)
Two witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. Both have served extensively in law
enforcement  for  more  than  27  years  each,  including  as  detectives,  investigators,  and
police  officers.  Both  have  extensive  experience  in  investigating  narcotics  and  alcohol-
related offenses. One was his former supervisor before her retirement and the other is
the  current  supervisor  of  security  where  he  works.  They  were  both  aware  of  his  DUI
conviction. They describe Applicant as a model employee. He was never observed being
under  the  influence  of  drugs  or  alcohol.  He  is  a  punctual,  responsible,  reliable,
dependable, and trustworthy employee. They have seen his commitment to his lifestyle
change.  He  has  taken  full  responsibility  for his  conduct  and  has  learned  from  it.  They
believe that he made a mistake, and he is worthy of a second chance. (Tr. 17-30)
Applicant provided a letter from a coworker. She believes Applicant is professional,
reliable, punctual, honest, friendly, and trustworthy. He is serious and conscientious about
security and following the rules and policies of the employer. He willingly goes above and
beyond what is required in his duties. (AE A)

"Applicant  admitted  she  used  marijuana  on  one  occasion  in  about  the  spring  of
2020, SOR ¶ 1.a, and she denied both allegations of falsification of her 2022 SCA, SOR
¶¶  2.a  and  2.b,  in  her Answer  to  the  SOR.  After a  thorough  and  careful  review of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  32  years  old.  She  has  been  married  to  her  husband  since  June
2017.  She  does  not  have  any  children.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer
science  in  December  2013.  In  August  2016,  she  received  a  certificate  in  information
accessibility  and  design  policy.  She  was  previously  employed  by  a  government
contractor from June 2017 to February 2021 as a web developer. She has possessed a
secret  security  clearance  since  2018.  In  February  2021,  she  was  hired  by  her  current
employer,  also  a  government  contractor,  that  sold  the  contract  to  another  federal
contractor  in  September  2022.  She  discovered  that  she  needed  a  top  secret  security
clearance for her current position as software engineer, and she completed an SCA on
July 29, 2022. (Tr. 14-17, 31; GE 1, GE 2)
Drug Involvement and Falsification
In her July 2022 SCA, Applicant stated that she  inadvertently  failed  to disclose,
as required, that she had used marijuana on one occasion in about the spring of 2020,
which  was  during  the  time  she  possessed  a  secret  DOD  security  clearance.  She
testified at the hearing that when she completed the SCA online in July 2022, it took her
about  a  week  to  update  all  of  the  detailed  information.  After  it  was  completed,  she
submitted  the  SCA  and  then  she  printed  it  out.  Although  she  had  admitted  she  had
thoroughly  reviewed  the  form  online  for  accuracy  and  completeness,  it  was  not  until
after  she  had  printed  out  the  SCA  that  she  realized  that  she  had  gotten  an  address
wrong, and she had incorrectly answered two of the illegal drug questions. She did not
disclose  her  one-time  use  of  marijuana  in  2020  while  possessing  a  DOD  security
clearance  because  it  had  completely  slipped  her  mind.  (Tr.  15-20,  28;  GE  1,  GE  2)
When  her  attorney  asked  her  how  her  one-time  use  of  marijuana  could  have  been
momentarily forgotten, Applicant stated:
Well,  it’s  like  if  -- if  anyone  asks  me,  I’m  not  in  -- I’m  not  in  the  kind  of
social circles to -- around people that do that kind of thing all the time. So
if  anyone  asked  if  I  smoke  or  whatever,  no,  I  don’t.  That’s  not  for  me.
That’s  not   something   I  have   --  I   do   or  have   done.  I   mean,   I  have   to
reconcile   that   in  my  mind   of,   yes,   I   did  do   that  once,  and   that   was  a
mistake and  not something I plan to repeat.  (Tr. 20)
When   Applicant   realized   she   had   incorrectly   answered   the   drug   questions,   she
immediately  called   her  best  friend   and   asked   her   what   she   should  do   about  it.   After
some   discussion,  Applicant  decided   she   would  correct  her   mistake   when   she
participated  in  her background  subject  interview with  an  authorized  DOD investigator on
September 20, 2022.  Applicant started  off  the  interview by  providing  clarification  about
her  physical  location/updated   address.  She   did  not  disclose   her  omitted   drug
information  until the  investigator questioned  her about  illegal drug  use.  After the  enquiry
from the investigator,  Applicant admitted she had used  marijuana once during the spring
of 2020  when  she  shared  a  joint  with  her husband, and  she  took  “about two  puffs.”  She
stated   that  her  spouse   regularly  uses  marijuana,  and   he   had   applied   for  a   medical
marijuana  card. She  told the  investigator that he  uses marijuana  on  a  weekly basis, but
he  had   expressed   interest   in   stopping   marijuana   use   because   he   wanted   to   obtain  a
U.S. Coast Guard’s captain’s license. She  admitted  that she  had  also  drank a  couple of
alcoholic  drinks   at  the   time   she   tried   the   marijuana.  She   was  not  certain  if  she   held a
secret   security  clearance   at   the   time,  and   she   did   not   report  her  drug   use   to   her
employer because  she  was not aware  that she  was required  to  do  so.  She  clarified  to
the   investigator   that   she   had   overlooked   the   drug   questions   because   the   SCA  online
had  previously populated  the  answers from  her previous SCA,  and  she  had  only briefly
looked over the  2022  SCA before submitting it.  (Tr. 21-25;  GE 2)
During the hearing, Applicant admitted that her state of residence had legalized
the recreational use of marijuana in 2020. At the age of 29, she had taken one puff of
marijuana  in  approximately  the  spring  of  2020  with  her  spouse  and  regretted  her
decision immediately. She had never used marijuana, or any other illegal drug, before
or  after  that  incident.  She  also  denied  telling  the  investigator  during  her  background
interview that she was not certain she possessed a security clearance during the time
she had used marijuana. (Tr. 24-25, 32)
During   cross-examination,  Applicant  stated   that  when   she   applied   for  the  top
secret   security  clearance   by  submitting   the   July  2022   SCA,  she   discovered   from   her
employer  that  she   was  to   undergo   a   polygraph   examination.  She   was   fully  aware   that
marijuana   was  illegal  under  federal  law  and   incompatible  with   individuals  who
possessed   DOD  security  clearances.  Even   though   she   had   never  tried   marijuana
before,  she   was  asked   to   explain   why,  at  the   age   of  29   and   while   possessing   a   DOD
security  clearance,   she   decided   to   try  marijuana   for  the   first  time.  Applicant   admitted
that   it  was   a  “minor  lapse   in   judgment”   and   that  she   had   consumed   two   alcoholic
beverages   beforehand.   She   also   stated   that  even   though   she   spent   an   extensive
amount of time  completing  the  SCA, when  she  read  over the  drug  questions, her one-
time   use   of   marijuana   did   not  come   to   mind.  She   did  not   immediately  report  her
omissions   to   the   facility  security officer (FSO), because   at   the   time,  she   was not   even
aware  of  an  FSO. She  admitted  that  her program  supervisor had  emailed  her about  the
necessity   of   completing   a   new   SCA,  but  she   did  not  report  her  SCA  omissions   to   her
program  manager  either.  She  denied  that  she  was  aware  that  she  was  supposed  to
report any  illegal drug use  to  her employer while  possessing  a  security  clearance,  but
she readily admitted that she had received annual security briefings and was certain this
topic was discussed during those briefings. (Tr. 31-44)
I questioned  Applicant  about some  inconsistent statements  she  had  made  to  the
background  investigator and during  the hearing. She  had  told  the  investigator during her
September 2022 interview that she had overlooked the  drug  questions on the  2022  SCA
because  the  online  application  had  automatically populated  previous  answers  she  had
reported   on  an  earlier SCA  she   had   submitted. She   had   also   told  the   investigator that
she  had  only briefly  reviewed  the  July 2022  SCA before she  submitted  it.  Her testimony
was  that  she   had   taken   a   week   to   prepare   her  2022   SCA   and   she   had   specifically
answered   the   drug   questions   with   a   negative   response   because   she   did  not   recall,  at
that  time,   that  she   had   used   marijuana   in  2020   or  while  possessing   a   security
clearance.   Applicant  admitted   she   had   told  the   investigator  that   information   but  also
acknowledged  that  the  drug  questions on  her  2022  SCA did not automatically populate
–  she  had to  specifically answer  the illegal drug  questions.  (Tr. 42-47)
Applicant testified that her husband did not get a medical marijuana card, but he
had  obtained  marijuana  for  recreational  use  legally  in  2020.  She  said  he  had  used
marijuana  on  a  weekly  basis  until  “a  couple  of  months  ago”  because  he  recently
decided  to  apply  for  a  captain’s  license.  After  Applicant  admitted  that  her  husband
stopped  his  regular  use  of  marijuana  in  June  or  July  2023,  Department  Counsel
questioned her why she failed to indicate her husband’s regular use of marijuana on the
February  2023  interrogatory  question  – “8. Do  you  associate  with  individuals  who  use
marijuana, any product containing THC, or any illegal drug(s)?” Applicant had answered
this question “No.”  Applicant then testified that she was not certain of the dates of her
husband’s  marijuana  use,  but  that  in  September  2022,  at  the  time  of  her  background
interview,  he  was  using  marijuana  weekly,  by  February  2023,  the  time  she  completed
the  interrogatories,  he  had  quit,  and  then  sometime  afterwards  he  resumed  using
marijuana until June or July 2023, when he quit again. She said the longest time he has
refrained from using marijuana was six months. Applicant provided a signed statement
of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  illegal  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse  when  she
submitted her interrogatory response in February 2023. (Tr. 47-59; GE 2)
Applicant stated that she had told her best friend that she had used marijuana on
one occasion in 2020. Her best friend testified that she met Applicant on a camping trip
in  September  2021.  Since  that  time,  they  have  become  best  friends  and  talk  to  each
other every day. She recalled Applicant had called her in a panic when she received the
email  that  she  was  to  have  a  background  interview  with  an  investigator,  and  after
reviewing  the  July 2022  SCA,  she  realized  that  she  had  not  listed  her one-time  illegal
drug  use  on  the  application  because  she  had  thought  it  had  occurred  outside  the
question’s  scope  of  time.  The  witness  was  interviewed  during  Applicant’s  security
clearance  investigation  and  had  reported  to  the  investigator  that  Applicant  had  used
marijuana  once  in  college.  During  the  hearing,  the  witness  said  she  speculated  that
Applicant’s use of marijuana had occurred during her college years. (Tr. 25, 61-72, 77-
80)
",False
"Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. Her admissions are incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is  26  years old.  She  is  not married  but  cohabitates  with  her  boyfriend.
She  has  no  children. She  earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in  2019  and  a  master’s degree  in
2020. She  works for a  defense  contractor and  completed  a  security clearance  application
(SCA) in July 2022.
Applicant disclosed in her SCA that she started using marijuana when she was a
freshman in high school in about June 2013. She stated:
Started  experimenting  with  THC my freshman  year of high  school. Everyone
in  my  friend   group   smoked   THC  regularly   at  the   time.  In   college[,]  my
boyfriend  at the  time  smoked  THC everyday due  to  his chronic anxiety. I
dated him for four years and would join him at night before bed 4-5 times  a
week.
Since I started  using THC at 15 years old, I am  unable to know the  number
of times I used  THC. The  nature of use  was casual usually in a  friend  setting
at  night  or  on   the   weekends.  When   I  graduated   college   at  [X]   State
University my friend  group  drastically changed  since  I moved  to  [State  A],
and   I  did  not   use   THC  for  at  about  1   year  and   3   months.   (sic)  A   couple
weeks ago  I  had  visited  an  old  friend  who  still  used  THC  and  I smoked  once
with  her estimated  date  was 7/21/2022. This  was late  at night  and  at her
apartment complex.
I do  not  intend  to  use  THC  in the  future  because  I  believe  it to  be  a  bad  habit
of my past that is a part of my rebellious teenage years that has lingered in
my  life   far  too   long.   THC  is  not   important  to   me   and   my  memories
surrounding   it  are  a   mix  of  very  bad   and   very  good   experiences   neither
outweighing  the other. (Item  2)
Applicant  disclosed  that  she  purchased  THC  from  roommates  and  friends  that
she associated with in high school and lived with in college. She said she did not need
to purchase it often because her friends, boyfriend, or roommates always had it around.
However, when she did purchase it, it was never more than 1-3.5 grams. Occasionally,
her friends would not have THC and she would purchase it because it was “her turn” to
provide it. THC was illegal in the state where she attended high school and college and
continued to be so during her period of use and purchase. (Item 2)
Applicant further disclosed in her SCA other illegal drugs she used. She stated: “I
have  experimented  with  mushrooms  exactly  four  times.”  (Item  2)  She  noted  the  dates
were from October 2019 to March 2022. She explained the nature of her use as follows:
I have  experimented  with  mushroom  exactly four times. The  first time  was
with   my  roommate   in   college.   We   had   nothing   to   do   one   night,   and   she
asked   me   if  I   wanted   to   try  them.  I  got  sick,   threw  them   up   and   nothing
happened. The  second  was at my friend’s birthday party on  July 4th, 2021.
There was a  small  group  of six[,]  four of us, four of which  tried  mushrooms
while we kayaked  down  a  river in [State  C].  The  third  time  was with  a  friend
in graduate  school at [University]. He had  been  wanting  to  try them  for a
while  and   I  had   told  him   about  my  experience.  We   tried   them   at  my
apartment then  took a  short walk  at  a  trail  near my apartment  complex. The
fourth  was with  the  same  friend  2  weeks later.  We  still  had  some  from  the
last  time  and  used  them  at my apartment.  We  did  not  go  anywhere this time.
(Item  2)
Regarding  whether  Applicant  intended  to  use  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  in  the
future she stated:
Mushrooms make me want to throw up  every  time  I have  used  them. Also,
they feel no  different from  having  a  beer or two in my experience. There is
no real point in using  them in  my opinion. (Item 2)
Applicant disclosed  that when  she  used  mushrooms in March 2022  that she  and  a
friend  purchased  them  to  share. She  said: “I have  only purchased  mushrooms once[,]  any
other time  I have  tried  them  they were  given  to  me.” (Item  2) She  further stated: “My friend
had  never tried  them  before  and  asked  me  if  I would  be  able  to  get  them  for us.  I knew
someone who sold them, so we split the cost.” (Item  2)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2022. She told
the  investigator  that  when  she  initially  tried marijuana  as  a  freshman  in  high  school  in
June 2013 that she did not start using it regularly until 2015. She would smoke marijuana
about once a month in backyards of friends’ houses from 2015 to 2016. From 2016 to
2020, she vaped or ate edibles almost daily at friends’ houses. From 2020 until July 2022,
she  would  consume  marijuana  through  vape  or  edibles  twice  a  year  on  average.  She
purchased her drugs on occasion and it was freely provided at other times. She believed
her drug use was immature, and she used it for social reasons. She told the investigator
that she no longer socializes with anyone who uses drug illegally. She disclosed friends
with  whom  she  used  drugs.  She  said  she  stopped  smoking  marijuana  in  July  2022
because she felt like she had outgrown that phase of her life. (Item 3)
Applicant told the investigator that her use of hallucinogenic mushrooms began in
October 2019, and they were provided to her. She said in July 2021, she was at a birthday
party for a friend and her friend’s boyfriend provided her with mushrooms. In March 2022,
she and her friend used mushrooms together and two weeks later used them again. She
purchased the mushrooms. She did not believe her actions of using mushrooms was due
to immaturity, but rather she used them for social reason. She listed her friends who are
aware of her drug use, including her current boyfriend, and she revealed that at least two
of the people she listed used drugs with her in the past. (Item 3)
Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM. It is unknown if her boyfriend,
with  whom  she  cohabitates,  uses  illegal  drugs.  It  is  unknown  whether  she  continued
abstaining from using marijuana since she completed her SCA in July 2022.
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  be  considered  when  making  a  credibility
determination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
",False
"Applicant admitted  the Guideline H allegations, with explanations, in his answer
and denied the Guideline E allegations. His admissions are incorporated as findings of
fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  40  years  old.  He  is  being  sponsored  for  a  clearance  by  a  defense
contractor. He works in information technology. He has worked for defense contractors
since 2015 and has held a secret clearance since 2016. He holds an associate degree.
He  is  married,  has  two  children,  and  was  expecting  a  third  child  at  the  time  of  his
hearing. (Tr. at 6, 20-22; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant used and purchased marijuana. It further alleged he
used  and  purchased  marijuana  from  November  2015  to  about  August  2016,  while
granted  access  to  classified  information.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b)  It  also  alleged  he  falsified
information  in  response  to  two  questions  on  his  March  2022  security  clearance
application (SCA) when he failed to disclose his marijuana use, as alleged above. The
marijuana use allegations were also cross-alleged under Guideline E. (SOR ¶¶ 2a-2.c)
Applicant  testified   that   he   experimented   with   marijuana   while   in  high   school.  In
2015, he  was hired  by  a  defense  contractor located  in  another state  (State  A).  He and
his  family  moved   to   State   A  to   take   the   job.  At  the   time   of  his  move,  State   A   had
legalized   the   use   of  marijuana   and   the   purchase   of  marijuana   from   state-licensed
dispensaries. Sometime  in 2015, he  completed  an SCA  (this document was not put  into
evidence)  with   the   assistance   of  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO).   He   described   this
process  as  him   being   on   the   telephone   with   his  FSO,  answering   the   FSO’s  questions
from   the   SCA,  and   the   FSO   taking   those   answers   and  inputting   them   into   the   SCA
online   computer  program.  He  answered   “no”   to   the   questions  about  whether  he   used
any  illegal  substances.  He  did  this  because   he   believed   his  use   of   marijuana   in  2015
was not illegal because  it  was allowed  under  State  A’s law.  He  was unaware  that use,
possession,   and   purchasing   of  marijuana   was  in  violation   of  federal  law.  He  does  not
recall   receiving   any  information   from   his  employer  or  FSO  that   marijuana   use   was
prohibited   by   federal  law.   (Nothing   about  falsifying   his  2015   SCA   was  alleged   in   the
SOR,  so   I  will   not  use   that  information   for   disqualifying   purposes.  However,  I  may
consider  it for credibility, mitigation,  and  in  applying  the  whole-person  factors).  (Tr. 20-
23; SOR answer; AE A, p. 6)
Applicant  admitted   that  he   used,   purchased,  and   possessed   marijuana   in   the
form  of gummies  in approximately 2015  and  perhaps  into  2016. He used  the  marijuana-
gummies  between  50-100  times during  that timeframe.  He did it  to  relax.  It  also  helped
with  his migraine  headaches. In  approximately  August of 2016, he  attended  a   security
briefing   and   was  informed   that  use,  possession,  and   purchase   of   marijuana   violated
federal law. Armed with this knowledge, he approached his program manager and told
him  about  his  marijuana  use  and  his  mistaken  belief  about  the  law.  His  program
manager told him to stop using marijuana, but otherwise not to worry about it. Applicant
has  not  used,  purchased,  or  possessed  marijuana  since  told  to  stop  doing  so  in
approximately  August  2016.  While  he  worked  in  a  cleared  environment,  he  never
handled classified information during this time period.  (Tr. 23-25, 40; SOR answer; AE
A, p.6)
In March 2022, Applicant was selected by his employer to apply for a top secret
clearance. This required him to complete a new SCA, which he did on March 25, 2022.
During the process of completing his SCA, he contemplated the drug-related questions:
“In  the  last  seven  years,  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled
substances? and “Have you ever illegally used . .  . a controlled substance  while
possessing a security  clearance . . . .”  He answered  “no”  to both questions.  Before
completing his answers, he testified that he sought guidance from his FSO about how to
answer the questions because he was not sure if his last marijuana use was within the
seven-year  timeframe.  Applicant  did  not  address  the  difference  in  the  nature  of  the
questions. The first asking if he used within the last seven years and the second asking
if he ever used. His FSO told him to “do his best”  in completing the SCA and address
any questions he had in the follow-up interview with an investigator. He also asked his
senior colleagues about how he should answer the questions and they agreed with the
FSO that he should address any questions or ambiguities during his follow-up interview.
Applicant denied that he intentionally provided false information on his SCA. (Tr. 25-27,
37; GE 1; AE A, p. 6)
In May 2022, Applicant was interviewed as part of his background investigation.
The written summary of this investigation appears at GE 2. Applicant disputed some of
the  characterizations  made  by  the  interviewer  and  noted  them  in  an  email  to
Department  Counsel  (AE  A,  pp.  3-4)  in  August  2023.  Applicant  admitted  using
marijuana in the last seven years to the investigator without first being confronted with
knowledge  of his  prior use.  He  further  explained  the  circumstances of  his use  and  his
ignorance  of  federal  law  prohibiting  use  of  marijuana  until  his  enlightenment  in
approximately August 2016. Appellant disagrees with the investigator’s characterization
that Applicant said he did not know why he did not list his marijuana use on his SCA. He
maintains  that  he  told  the  investigator  about  his  confusion  concerning  the  seven-year
window to report drug use and he was not sure whether his situation required reporting.
He decided to wait to ask clarifying questions when he spoke to the investigator, which
he did. Overall, I found Applicant’s testimony and explanations credible. (Tr. 26, 37-38;
GE 2; SOR answer; AE A, pp. 3-4)
Applicant  submitted  a  letter  from  a  friend  who  has  rented  a  room  from  him  for
approximately  10  years.  The  friend  stated  that  he  has  not  witnessed  Applicant  use
marijuana since 2016. Applicant also submitted a written statement of intent not to use
marijuana or THC products in the future, that such use could result in the revocation of
his clearance, and that marijuana use is illegal under federal law. Applicant’s wife does
not use marijuana or THC products. (Tr. 30; AE B-C)
",True
"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in his Answer to the SOR. (¶¶ 1.a-f, and
2.a). After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  36  years  old.  In  May  2022,  he  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
computer  science.  He  has  not  married  and  does  not  have  any  children.  Since  early
2022,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  federal  contractor  as  a  software  engineer.  This  is
Applicant’s first application for a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 20-; GE 1, AE G, I, J)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  from  September  2006  to
March  2022Applicant  first  used  marijuana  in  2006  in  high  school  with  friends.  After
graduating, he moved into a house with three of his high school friends who also used
marijuana.  He  stayed  in  that  home  until  2008  and  moved  out  shortly  after  his  21st
birthday. He stated that his marijuana use was at least weekly while living in the home
with his friends. From 2008 to about 2012, he moved back home to live with his parents
and  his  20-year-old-brother.  He  used  marijuana  at  his  parents’  home  approximately
daily. This was his heaviest use of marijuana. He used it out of loneliness and boredom.
At  that  time,  he  felt  like  he  did  not  have  any  friends,  and  he  did  not  like  his  current
career path. He moved out of his parents’ home in approximately 2012. (Tr. 21-32; GE
1, 2)
In 2012, Applicant moved into a one-bedroom apartment by himself. He initially
used  marijuana,  but  he  then met  a  girlfriend,  and  he  felt  his life  changed  in  a  positive
manner. He started to make goals about going to school, and he started socializing with
friends  again.  His  use  of  marijuana  decreased,  and  he  was  more  productive  with  his
time.  In  early  2016,  he  enrolled  into  a  community  college.  He  applied  himself  to  his
studies  and  decided  he  wanted  to  pursue  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  science
and  software  engineering.  Applicant  testified,  “Smoking  marijuana  was  essentially
incompatible with my life at that time.” If he did smoke marijuana, it occurred about once
every two months. (Tr. 32-36, 57)
Applicant  last  used  marijuana  in  March  2022,  near  the  end  of  his  senior  year,
during a celebration at his parents’  home. He was also busy applying  for jobs, and he
decided  that  he  no  longer  wanted  marijuana  to  be  a  part  of  his  life.  After  making  his
decision, he informed his friends and family members that he no longer uses marijuana.
He was hired by a DOD contractor, and he understands how important it is to be placed
in  a  position  of  trust  and  responsibility  by  his  employer  and  the  federal  government.
Since March 2022, he has not used marijuana or any other illegal drug, and he does not
intend to use any illegal substances in the future. (Tr. 37-40; AE F; GE 1, 2)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleged  Applicant  used  mushrooms  from  February  2020  to  August
2021.  Applicant  testified  that  he  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  on  two  occasions,
once in February 2020 and the second time in August 2021. The first time he was on a
camping  trip,  his  brother  made  tea  with  the  mushrooms,  and  everyone  drank  the  tea.
The second time Applicant and his  girlfriend purchased mushrooms from a dispensary
and  used  it  together  before  saying  their  goodbyes  as  he  left  for  his  senior  year  in
college.  He  has  no  interest  or  future  intentions  to  use  hallucinogenic  mushrooms.  (Tr.
42-48, GE 1, 2)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleged  Applicant  used  opiates  in  2012.  He  stated  he  used  a
prescription  pill  that  is  considered  an  opiate,  but  he  actually  took  these  pills  with  his
friends in 2007, not 2012.  He used it on two or three occasions over the course of the
year. His friends provided the pills, and he did not like the nauseating effect from using
this drug. He has not used opiates since 2007, and he does not intend to use opiates in
the future. (Tr. 49-54; GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleged Applicant used cocaine in 2012. He explained that he did not
list opiate or cocaine use on his SCA because it had occurred outside the scope of the
question. He told the investigator that he had not used these drugs  “within the last ten
years,”  and  he  now  believes  that  is  how  the  date  “2012”  was  calculated.  He  actually
used cocaine on a few occasions in 2007 with these same friends, due to curiosity and
a desire to fit in with his friends. He never purchased cocaine. He has not used cocaine
since 2007, and he does not intend to use cocaine in the future. (Tr. 54-57; GE 2)
SOR ¶  1.e  alleged  in November 2014  Applicant was arrested  for (1) possession
of  25   grams  or  less   of   marijuana   and   (2)  possession   of  drug   paraphernalia.   He
explained   that  it   was  late  at  night,   and   he   was   pulled   over by  the  police   for having   an
expired registration  decal on  his license  plate. The  police  officer told  Applicant he  could
smell  the  odor  of  marijuana  coming  from  his car.  His car was  searched,  marijuana  was
found, and  Applicant  was arrested.  He  was held at the  police  station  for about  an  hour
and   released.  He  was   given   the   option   to   plead   guilty   to   count  (1)   and   pay  the   fine   in
full, which he did. He  was not ordered  to go  to substance abuse counseling  or placed  on
probation.  Count (2) was dismissed.  (Tr. 62-65; AE B, C; GE  3, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleged in February 2012 Applicant was  charged with (1) possession
of THC (marijuana) and three counts of possession of drug paraphernalia. He explained
that this incident took place while he was living with his parents, so it actually happened
between 2009-2011. This incident was not found during his criminal background check,
and he voluntarily provided this information during his July 2022 background interview.
His parents were having a verbal argument, and Applicant intervened and told his father
that he was being rude to his mother. The father said something to the effect that if you
are  so  concerned  about  your  mother,  why  don’t  you  call  the  police?  The  father  dialed
911, they heard the dispatcher come on the line, and then his father disconnected the
phone. The police arrived at the house, they searched Applicant’s bedroom and found a
small amount of marijuana, a pipe, and a grinder. They confiscated everything and gave
Applicant a citation. Applicant appeared in court and was told that if chose the option to
pay the fine in full, he would not have to go through a hearing and this incident would
not be reported on his criminal record. He paid the fine in full.  (Tr. 57-62)
Applicant  provided  a  drug  specimen  result  certificate  showing  that  in  August
2023, a drug test analysis of Applicant’s hair did not detect the presence of marijuana,
cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine, opiates, or PCP. Applicant also provided a
signed statement of intent to refrain from using any and all illegal drugs, and any future
involvement with drugs  would be grounds for revocation of his security clearance.  (AE
E, L)
Paragraph  2  of  the  SOR  alleged  Guideline  J  (Criminal  Conduct)  security
concerns,  and  it  cross-alleged  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f.  Applicant  admitted  both  SOR
allegations. He did not list his drug-related charges on the May 2022 SCA because he
thought  these  offenses  were  limited  to  a  seven-year  period.  He  voluntarily  disclosed
both  incidents  during  his  July  2022  background  interview  without  the  investigator
confronting him with this adverse information. (SOR response)
Four  witnesses   testified   on   Applicant’s  behalf.  Applicant  also  provided   his  work
achievements,  a   current   employer  peer  review,   and   numerous   character   reference
letters   from   his  college   professors,  co-workers,  team   manager,   previous  supervisor,
family,  and  friends  who  described  Applicant as an effective  leader,  honest,  trustworthy,
and   intelligent.   All   of  his  colleagues   had   no   reservations  about  Applicant’s  character,
responsibility,   or   patriotism.   Applicant  also   submitted   two   awards   from   his  employer   -
“recognizing   exceptional  performance,”   and   a   positive  employer  peer  review  that  was
completed in November 2022. (AE H, I, K)
",True
"Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  is  on  unpaid
leave pending the outcome of this adjudication. He attended college for a period without
earning a degree. He married in 2006, divorced in 2009, married for the second time in
2015,  and  divorced  in  2018.  He  lives  with  a  cohabitant  in  what  he  describes  as  a
common-law marriage. He has three children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17-21, 60-61; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  August  2007  until  he  was  honorably
discharged  for  medical  reasons  in  August  2008.  He  testified  that  he  served  “[a]  little
short of two years.” His DD-214 indicates that he served 11 months and 23 days. (Tr. at
19; AE A)
Applicant was still in a training command in March 2008 because of his medical
issues.  Two  soldiers  reported  that  Applicant  attempted  to  sell  them  ecstasy  (3,  4
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)), an illegal controlled substance. One of the
soldiers  stated  that  he  overheard  Applicant  tell  a  soldier that  he  had  two  more  to  sell.
Applicant then asked the soldier if he wanted some ecstasy. The soldier said, “hell no,”
and reported the incident to the sergeant first class on duty. (Tr. at 20, 41-42; GE 1, 7)
The  duty  sergeant  confronted  Applicant,  read  him  his  rights,  and  asked  him  to
empty his pockets and his wallet. The sergeant found two pills inside a plastic wrapper
in  Applicant’s  wallet  that  were  later  determined  to  be  MDMA.  The  sergeant  asked
Applicant  what  the  pills  were,  and  he  answered  ecstasy.  A  Criminal  Investigation
Command (CID) investigation was initiated in 2008. Applicant waived his right to remain
silent and provided a sworn statement. (GE 7)
In the sworn statement to the CID, Applicant stated that there was a song on that
was about ecstasy, and he asked the soldiers if either had used ecstasy before, but he
denied selling or attempting to sell ecstasy. He stated that he obtained the two pills in
January 2008 while at a strip club. Someone at the club  traded Applicant the two pills
for some beers. The individual said the pills were some kind of medication but  did not
say  what  medication.  Applicant  stated  that  he  assumed  they  were  some  kind  of  pain
pills. Applicant placed the pills in his wallet, where they were later discovered in March
2008 by the duty sergeant. Applicant specifically stated that he only received two pills,
and he never took any of the pills. He was given a urinalysis drug test that day, which
tested positive for MDMA. (GE 7)
The  CID  referred  the  investigation  to  Applicant’s  command  for  the  offenses  of
wrongful  possession  of  hallucinogens  with  intent  to  distribute,  wrongful  use  of
hallucinogens,  and  false  official  statement.  There  is  no  direct  evidence  of  any
disciplinary   action   against   Applicant,   and   he   was   discharged   with   an  honorable
discharge. I note  that the  CID reported  that he  was an  E-2  in March  2008, and  his  DD-
214 reported that he was an E-1 when  he was discharged.  (GE 7)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2021.  The
interview  was  summarized  in  a  report  of  investigation  (ROI).  Applicant  confirmed  the
accuracy  of  the  ROI  in  August  2022.  He  admitted  during  the  interview  that  several
soldiers reported that he was selling ecstasy to soldiers. He stated that people lied, that
the  military  was  a  hostile  environment,  and  he  was  not  liked.  He  stated  that  he  never
tried to sell drugs, and a drug was never obtained in the incident. (GE 2)
Applicant  provided  a  slightly  different  story  during  his  testimony.  He  denied
knowledge  that  the  pills  were  ecstasy,  and  he  denied  trying  to  sell  the  pills  to  other
soldiers.  He  stated  that  he  received  three  pills in  the  strip  club,  and  he took one  for a
headache, thinking it was pain medication. He  stated that he forgot he had the pills in
his wallet. He did not recall if he was given a urinalysis drug test, and he did not recall
being informed that he tested positive for ecstasy or MDMA. (Tr. at 41-46)
I did not find Applicant credible. I find the CID report to be far more reliable. I find
Applicant knowingly used ecstasy, had at least two ecstasy pills that he tried to sell, and
tested  positive  for  MDMA.  I  further  find  that he  intentionally  provided  false  information
about  the  incident  to  CID  (false  official  statement),  during  his  2021  background
interview, and during his testimony.
Applicant was driving with his two-year old child in a child seat in May 2019 when
he  was  stopped  by  the  police  for  defective  tail  lamps.  He  voluntarily  gave  the  police
consent  to  search  his  vehicle.  The  police  discovered  under  the  driver’s  side  seat  a
canister  of  white  powder  that  was  later  identified  through  analysis  to  be  about  three
grams  of  methamphetamine.  A  small  backpack  was  on  the  floor  by  the  front
passenger’s  seat.  There  was  a  canister  with  suspected  methamphetamine  residue  in
the backpack. A glass pipe of the type that is commonly used to smoke drugs was also
in  the  backpack.  Small  clear  baggies  were  found  in  the  driver’s  side  door  and  in  the
backpack. (Tr. at 32-41; GE 8)
When  he  was  arrested,  the  police  discovered  two  small  clear  baggies  with
methamphetamine  residue  in  his  right  front  pocket  and  a  container  with  .1  gram  of
methamphetamine  in  his  left  front  pocket.  A  med-kit  with  multiple  containers  of
suspected  THC  oil  was  found  under  the  passenger  seat.  Possession  of  marijuana  or
THC was not a violation of state law. (GE 8)
Applicant  was  charged  with  possession  of  a  controlled  substance  for  the
methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia. In June 2019, a warrant was
issued for his failure to appear at a court date, and he was arrested. He stated that he
had  moved  and  did  not  receive  notice  of  the  court date.  In  October  2019,  he  pleaded
guilty  to possession of a controlled substance, and the other charges  were dismissed.
He  was  sentenced  to  supervised  probation  for  two  years,  completion  of  a  substance
abuse evaluation with the requirement to follow any recommendations, and community
service.  He  passed  multiple  drug  tests  between  May  and  December  2019.  He
completed  the  terms  of  his  probation;  it  was  converted  to  unsupervised  probation  in
November 2020; and probation was terminated early in May 2021. (Tr. at 36, 46-49; GE
6, 8-10; AE E)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
June 2021. He reported the May 2019 arrest and subsequent conviction for possession
of  a  controlled  substance.  He  denied  illegally  using  any  illegal  drugs  or  controlled
substances in the last seven years. (GE 1)
When  he  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  August  2021,
Applicant stated that he was unaware there was methamphetamine in his car when he
was  arrested
in  May  2019.  He  denied  knowingly  using  or  possessing
methamphetamine. He stated that he let someone else use his vehicle, and the person
must  have  left  the  drugs  in  his  car  without  his  knowledge.  He  stated  that  he  did  not
know  the  friend’s  name,  and  he  no  longer  associated  with  him.  He  also  told  the
investigator that the June 2019 arrests for failure to appear were for the same incident.
(GE 2)
Applicant testified that he was going through a difficult time in his marriage, and
he used methamphetamine on one occasion before his arrest. He admitted that he had
baggies in his pocket that were from when he used methamphetamine. He continued to
deny  that  he  knew  there  was  methamphetamine  in  his  vehicle.  He  stated  he  lent  the
vehicle to the friend he used methamphetamine with, and that person must have left the
methamphetamine in the vehicle. He denied any additional drug involvement. He stated
that  he  took  responsibility  for  his  bad  decision  to  use  methamphetamine,  and  he
disassociated himself from anyone involved in illegal drugs. (Tr. at 32-40; AE E)
Applicant  denied  being  untruthful  during  his  2021  background  interview.  He
testified that he did not mention to the investigator that baggies were found in his pocket
because he did not remember that fact. (Tr. at 40-41, 49-50, 59; GE 2)
I  did  not  find  Applicant  credible.  I  find  he  knowingly  possessed  and  used
methamphetamine. I further find that he intentionally provided false information when he
failed  to  list  his  use  of  methamphetamine  on  his  SF  86,  during  his  2021  background
interview when he stated that he was unaware there was methamphetamine in his car
and  he  denied  knowingly  using  or  possessing  methamphetamine,  and  during  his
testimony.
The  SOR  alleges  a  $3,069  collection  account  to  a  bank  (SOR  ¶  1.a),  a  $483
collection  account  to  a  telecommunications  company  (SOR  ¶  1.b),  and  a  balance  of
$16,364 due on an auto loan after the vehicle was repossessed (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant
admitted owing the first two debts, but he stated that he paid the auto debt. The debts
are  listed  on  one  or  more  credit  reports.  Applicant  did  not  report  any  financial  issues
when he submitted his June 2021 SF 86, even though all the debts were delinquent by
then. (GE 1, 3-5)
Applicant  stated  that  the  $3,069  collection  account  to  a  bank  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  was
used to buy an engagement ring for his second wife. He stated that he tried to get the
ring back from her after they separated, but she told him that she lost the ring. He was
unable  to  get  her  to  pay  the  account,  so  he  unsuccessfully  disputed  it  with  the  credit
reporting  agencies.  He  stated  that  he  then  did  not  have  the  ability  to  pay  the  debt.  In
October 2023, he agreed to make partial payments of $100 a month for seven months,
with  the  first  payment  due  on  October  20,  2023.  He  testified  that  he  made  the  first
payment,  but  he  did  not  provide  any  documentary  evidence.  (Tr.  at  21-24;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B)
Applicant  stated  that  the  $483  collection  account  to  a  telecommunications
company  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  was  for  equipment  that  he  returned,  but  the  company  did  not
have  records  that  it  was  returned.  He  stated  that  if  he  was  given  a  receipt  for  the
returned  equipment, he  no  longer has  it. He unsuccessfully  disputed  the debt  with the
credit  reporting  agencies.  He  has  decided  to  pay  the  debt.  (Tr.  at  24-26;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-5)
SOR  ¶ 1.c alleges an unpaid  balance of $16,364 due on an auto loan after the
vehicle  was  repossessed.  Applicant  testified  that  the  vehicle  developed  transmission
problems,  and  he  was  told  he  needed  a  new  transmission.  He  had  an  extended
warranty on the vehicle, but the holder of the warranty told him that he did not need a
new transmission. He stopped paying the loan, and the vehicle was repossessed. The
vehicle was auctioned, and the creditor waived any deficiency, resulting in a $0 balance.
During  his  background  interview  in  July  2021,  he  stated  that  he  bought  a  more
expensive  vehicle  than  he  could  afford,  he  missed  payments,  and  the  vehicle  was
repossessed.  He  never  mentioned  transmission  problems.  (Tr.  at  26-30;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE C, D)
Applicant stated that his finances are now in order. He stated that he intends to
pay the remaining SOR debts. (Tr. at 21-32, 58)
Applicant  submitted   documents  and   letters  attesting   to   his  excellent  job
performance   and   strong   moral  character.  He  is  praised   for  his  work  ethic,   expertise,
trustworthiness,  professionalism, commitment  to  the  mission,  craftsmanship,  dedication,
leadership, reliability, and  integrity. He is recommended  for a  security clearance. (AE F-

",True
"Applicant admitted the sole allegation SOR ¶ 1.a. His admissions are incorporated
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked
since 2021. He received a master's degree in 2020, has been married since 2019, and
has one child. (Item 2 at 12-13, 14, 22.)
Guideline H
Applicant  admits  to  a  five-year  history  of  marijuana  use.  In  response  to  DOHA
interrogatories issued to him after his January 2023 security clearance interview, he listed
December 2022 as the  last time he used marijuana.  (Item 3 at 8.)  The window of use
extends several months after he submitted his September 2022 e-QIP. (Response; Item
3  at  4.).  In  his  Response  he  modified  his  prior  answers.  He  admitted  he  first  tried
marijuana  in  2017  but  because  he  was  a  football  player  and  did  not  want  to  lose  his
scholarship, he did not use marijuana from April 2017 until May  2020. (Response.) He
began using marijuana again in May 2020 to help mitigate the pains associated with a
2019 shoulder surgery and subsequent rehabilitation and exercises. He specified in his
Response:
…   I  only  used   it  for  extremely  painful  times  (i.e.,  once   every  couple  of
months).   From   May   of   2020   -  December   of   2020,  l   used   marijuana   once
(every)   3-4   months.  The   once   every  3-4   months  frequency  of   using
marijuana  is the  same  for January 2021  - December 2021. Lastly, January
2022  - December 2022  would follow the  same  frequency as years prior. As
mentioned  in my e-QlP, my last  intake  of marijuana  was December of  2022.
Prior to that date, I had not participated in  marijuana since July of  2022.
Applicant admits to ""vaping"" marijuana with friends with whom he still associates.
He volunteered he would mitigate his use of marijuana by changing his sleeping habits
and  seeking  other  medical  relief  for  his  pain  and  discomfort  as  well  as  stretching  and
modifying his workouts. (Item 3 at 4; Response.) There is no evidence of a prescription
in the record.
Applicant in his Response stated he believed he could be deemed trustworthy to
conduct his duties because his use of marijuana over the years between 2017 and 2022,
was infrequent. He affirms that that any participation in illegal drug use would “derail” him
from being able to complete his job. He states since his last use in December of 2022, he
has “disassociated” himself from the drug. (Response; Item 3 at 4, 8.)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  the  drug-related  allegations  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b.  He
admitted the delinquent debts alleged at SOR  ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b, 2.d, 2.e, and 2.f. He denied
SOR  ¶  2.c.  He  did  not  answer  the  cross-allegation  at  SOR  ¶  3.a,  so  I  construe  his
answer  as  a  denial.  He  denied  the  allegation  of  deliberate  falsification  of  his  SCA  at
SOR  ¶  3.b.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After a  thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  26  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2016.  He  held
several jobs in retail and as a security officer until he enlisted in the Navy. He served on
active duty in the Navy from February 2021 until March 2022, when he was discharged
after  he  tested  positive  for  THC.  He  was  then  unemployed  until  June  2022  when  he
began  working  for  his  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor,  a  defense  contractor.
(Item  2)  Applicant  was  married  in  February  2021  and  divorced  in  June  2022.  He
remarried two months later, in August 2022. (Item 2)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  used  THC  “on  various  occasions  between  at
least  approximately  November  2021  and  February  2022.”  Applicant  admitted  the
allegation without further comment. (Item 1) This is based on his disclosure of THC use
during  that  timeframe  on  his  September  2022  SCA.  However,  he  denied  knowingly
consuming THC, asserting that he thought he was vaping nicotine. (Item 2 at 35)
Applicant  explained  in  his  background  interview  that  he  tested  positive  for  THC
following  a  routine  drug  test,  in  November  2021.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  He  was  notified  of  the
positive test in February 2022. He went to “Chief’s Mast.” He was asked if he had ever
been  given  a  “blacklist”  of  “vape  shops”  he  was  ordered  not  to  frequent.  He  denied
being given  such  a  list.  He  was  given  the  list  during  the proceeding  and  recognized  a
vape  shop  he  had  visited.  He  said  he  purchased  and  ingested  a  substance  without
looking at the label. He  asserted that he did not  know he was ingesting THC.  He was
found guilty at Chief’s Mast and sent to Captain’s Mast, where he was also found guilty,
on  the  grounds  that  he  should  have  known  what  he  was  ingesting.  While  he  said  he
wanted  to  go  to  court  martial,  Applicant  chose  to  plead  guilty  and  accept  45  days  of
restricted  duty  as  non-judicial  punishment  and  a  general  discharge  under  honorable
conditions. (Item 2 at 34-36; Item 4 at 5-6)
Applicant adopted his background interview summary as accurate in a February
2023  interrogatory  response.  (Item  4)  In  answering  further  questions  about  his  drug
involvement,  he  denied  ever  using  or  purchasing  illegal  drugs,  such  as  marijuana.  He
acknowledged that “despite any state laws to the contrary, marijuana use remains illegal
under  Federal  law”  and  therefore  if  he  were  to  be  granted  a  clearance  or  public  trust
position,  any  future  use  of  marijuana  may  affect  his  eligibility.”  (Item  4)  He  disavowed
any future intent to use THC, marijuana, or “any other drugs illegally in the future.” (Item
4 at 13) He made a similar vow on his most recent SCA. (Item 2 at 35)
The  record  includes  several  credit  bureau  reports  (CBRs),  dated  November
2020,  September  2022,  and  March  2023.  (Items  5,  6,  and  7),  which  establish  the
delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR under Guideline F.
The six SOR debts total $10,803. Applicant provided no indication that any debts
have been, or are being, paid. The debts are detailed as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a ($396) is a debt placed for collection by an insurance company. SOR
¶ 1.b ($702) is a charged-off account with a bank. SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,194), which Applicant
denied, is a cell phone account that has been placed for collection. SOR ¶ 1.d ($5,395)
is  a  charged-off  account  with  a  bank.  SOR  ¶  1.e  ($1,995)  is  a  charged-off  credit  card
account. All of these accounts are listed as past due on CBRs in September 2022 and
March 2023. (Items 6, 7)
SOR  ¶  1.f  ($1,121)  is  a  credit  account  that  has  been  charged  off  by  a  jeweler.
(Item 6) On the March 2023 CBR, however, the account has a zero balance. (Item 7).
This account is resolved.
Applicant did not disclose any delinquent debts on his SCA. (Item 2 at 39-40) In
his background interview, he verified his negative answers to financial questions on his
SCA and was then confronted with evidence of his various delinquencies. (Item 4 at 6)
Once confronted, he agreed with the accounts. He did not recall some of them  but did
not dispute the listings on the credit report. He said he would look into the accounts and
obtain documentation. (Item 4 at 7)
Applicant asserted in his background interview that he did not disclose the debts
on  his  SCA  because  he  did  not  understand  the  questions.  In  answering  SOR  ¶  3.b,
which  alleges  that  he  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  the  debts  when  he  filled  out  his
SCA, he said, “I admit but I don’t remember answering this question as I gave my agent
all the account information that I had.” (SOR Response)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  Government’s  FORM,  so  no  more  recent
information about him is available.

"Applicant,  age  51,  is unmarried  with  a  minor child.  She  received  her bachelor’s
degree in 2007. She worked as a detective for a large metropolitan city police department
in  State  A  from  1993  to  2013.  Since  2013,  she  has  been  self-employed  as  a  private
investigator. She relocated her residence from State A to State B in 2016. In June 2021,
she  was  hired  into  a  contract  investigator  position  by  the  defense  contractor  who
sponsored her EQIP. The record did not address whether Applicant either submitted to a
preemployment drug test or was advised of a drug-free policy upon hire. DCSA granted
her interim eligibility for a secret clearance on August 8, 2022. As of September 27, 2022,
she had not yet begun employment in the position for which eligibility was granted. (Items
3-5)
Applicant did not disclose any drug use on her July 25, 2022 EQIP. She answered
“No”  to  all  questions  in  “Section  23  –  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity,”  including
whether she had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances within the last seven
years, while possessing a security clearance, or while employed as a law enforcement
officer.  The  opening  paragraph  of  Section  23  noted  that  all  questions  pertained  to  the
illegal  use  of  drugs  or  controlled  substances  “in  accordance  with  Federal  laws,  even
though  permissible  under  state  laws.”  The  question  about  “illegal  use  of  drugs  or
controlled  substances”  in  Section  23  noted,  “Use  of  a  drug  or  controlled  substance
includes  injecting,  snorting,  inhaling,  swallowing,  experimenting  with  or  otherwise
consuming any drug or controlled substance.” (Item 3)
During Applicant’s September 27, 2022 security clearance interview (SI), she self-
reported that she experimented with marijuana twice after completing the EQIP, on an
unspecified date in July 2022, and on an unspecified date in September 2022. On each
occasion, she inhaled one hit of marijuana from a vaping pen supplied by a friend while
attending a concert. She attributed her decision to use marijuana to the fact that it is legal
in State B. She claimed that, on the occasions when she used marijuana, she was not
aware that its use remains illegal under federal law. She maintained that she never used
any other illegal drugs or marijuana on any other occasions. She professed an intent not
to use marijuana in the future because it could affect her security clearance. (Item 2, 5)
Although not explicitly stated, information in the record implied that both concerts
Applicant attended were in State B. In her Answer, she reiterated that, to the best of her
knowledge,  her  marijuana  use  was  legal  under  State  B  law.  The  Government  did  not
proffer  evidence  to  the  contrary.  She  maintained  that  she  would  never  have  used
marijuana had she known that its use was illegal under federal law. The record did not
indicate when or how she acquired that knowledge. (Items 5)
",False
"In  Applicant's Answer to  the  SOR  and  in  her Response  to  the  FORM  including  the
additional SOR  allegations, she  denied  falsifying  her answers on  her  SCA,  SOR ¶¶  1.a-
1.d, and  denied  that she  had  been  terminated  by her previous employer,  SOR ¶  1.e. She
admitted  SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.b  and  denied  SOR  ¶  2.c.  She  admitted  SOR ¶  3.a. Her  admissions
are  incorporated   in  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a   thorough   and   careful  review  of  the
pleadings and  exhibits  submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 37-year-old welding inspector employed by a defense contractor.
since November 2021. Previously she had been employed by a defense contractor from
March 2011, subject to intermittent periods where her status was in dispute, until October
2021. (Answer at 22; Item 3 at 7, 13.) She earned a bachelor’s degree in August 2018.
She has never held a security clearance. She has never married. (Item 2 at 12, 17, and
32.)
In her July 2021 SCA, Applicant denied any illegal drug use or drug activity. She
listed a single employer from 2011 to the present. During her personal subject interview
(PSI), she admitted that she voluntarily used marijuana on several occasions in the seven
years  prior  to  certifying  her  SCA,  and  detailed  various  employers  and  breaks  in
employment not listed in her SCA.
SOR  ¶   1.a:  Falsified  material  facts  in  response  to  interrogatories  dated
October  27,  2022.  Applicant  asserted  in  her  interrogatory  response  that  the  positive
urinalyses alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b were the result of secondhand smoke inhalation.
She provided two Federal reports with her Answer to support her assertion, the first from
NIDA and the second from the CDC. The NIDA found it was possible in an unventilated
room to test positive urine assays in the hours directly following exposure and the CDC
considered that someone using marijuana in a child’s home could result in the child having
detectable levels of THC but the CDC does not address whether the THC is detectable
in the child’s blood or urine stating people exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke can
test positive on a urinalysis in the hours directly following exposure studies. (Answer at
13, 17.) She did not detail how her environment was akin to the studies she provided.
SOR ¶  1.b: Falsified material facts on an SCA dated July 14, 2021, pertaining
to  “Section  23-Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity”  when  you  stated  “No”  to
whether  you had illegally  used drugs  or controlled substances  in  the  last seven
years. Applicant in her Response wrote “Yes, I said no on my [SCA] because at the time
I didn't remember doing any kind of drug.” She notes she admitted to two occurrences of
drug use in her PSI which details the various instances where she smoked or consumed
marijuana. (Item 4 at 8-9.) In her Response she stated “I said no on my [SCA] because
at the time I didn’t remember doing any kind of drug. At the time of my interview on page
8 of the interrogatories I did in  fact mention 2 different occurrences.” (Response.)  She
also had tested positive for marijuana on a urinalysis conducted in March 2021. (Item 4
at 9, 17; Answer at 5.)
SOR ¶  1.c: Falsified material facts on an SCA dated July 14, 2021, pertaining
to  “Section  13A  –  Employment  Activities""  wherein  you  listed  your  dates  of
employment at Company A as continuous from March 2011 to the present. Applicant
denied  this  allegation.  Applicant  was  employed  by  Company  A  from  March  2011  until
September 2020, when she was terminated for having a firearm on company property.
She  failed  to  disclose  her  employment  with  Company  B  from  October  2020  to  March
2021. (Item 4 at 7.) In March 2021, she was hired by Company C. (Item 4 at 7.) In her
Answer she admits that she was also briefly employed by Company C, and in her PSI,
she details the events surrounding her brief time with Company C. (Answer at 5; Item 4
at 6, 17.) She provided a statement from Company C stating that she had been hired and
left after one week. (Response at 12.)  Also, in March 2021, her appeal with Company A
was resolved. She states that she was reinstated with Company A without backpay. (Item
4 at 6.) In her Response she explains that she was told by her union representative that
her  “time  would  be  bridged,  making  it  look  more  like  a  six-month  suspension.”
(Response.)
SOR  ¶   1.d:  Tested  positive   for  marijuana   in  March  2021,  during  a   pre-
employment  drug  screening/urinalysis  for  a  job with  Company  C, an employment
activity  that you  did not  disclose  on an SCA  executed by  you on or about  July  14,
2021.  In   her  Response   Applicant   denied   the   allegation   on   the   basis  it  was  a   not  a
company test but an  in-house  test.  (Response  at 2.)  She  explains in  her Answer  and  PSI
that  she  had  tested  positive during  the  preemployment screening  process for Company
C  due   to   exposure   to   secondhand   marijuana   smoke   and   that  Company  C   had   let  her
“come  on  board with  this explanation.” (Answer at 5; Item  4  at 9, 17.) The  investigator
noted   she   hesitated   when   asked   if  she   had   a   positive   urinalysis  test  and   then   she
responded  yes to  testing  positive  for marijuana. She  told the  investigator she  had  been
exposed to  secondhand marijuana  smoke.  (Item  4  at  9.) She  explained  in her Response
that  the  sample she  provided  showed  a  negative result  based  on  the  test’s standards,  but
her employer indicated  a  laboratory test could be  positive because  of faint  presence. (Item
4 at 9.)
SOR ¶  1.e: Terminated from employment at Company A in October 2021 after
testing positive for marijuana during a urinalysis administered by your employer
immediately after being involved in a motor vehicle accident on company grounds
in  September  2021.  Applicant  in  her Response  discusses  the  positive  urinalysis.  She
stated that she “hates the fact that it happened” and her choice to party showed less than
perfect judgment. (Response.) She offers that she does not party anymore and now she
goes to work and goes home but that “sometimes [she] might relax with close friends, but
not that often.” (Response.)
SOR ¶  2.a: On or about  March  2021, you tested positive  for marijuana  on a
urinalysis  test  administered by  your employer. Applicant  admitted  this allegation. In
her Answer she  stated  she  disclosed  to  Company C  she  might  test  positive  and  noted  the
urinalysis she  took “was barely  a  positive.”  (Answer at  5.)  She  claimed  that  she  had  tested
positive due  to  exposure to  secondhand  marijuana  smoke  and  that Company C had  let
her “come on  board with this explanation.” (Item  4  at 9, 17; Answer  at 5.)  She  provided a
statement from  Company C  stating:  “As per our organization's  policies and  procedures,
all  prospective  employees  are required  to  undergo  a  thorough  pre-employment screening,
which   includes  a   drug   screening.  However, in  the   case   of   [Applicant]   her   employment
duration  was  exceptionally short,  spanning  only from  March  8, 2021,  until March 15,  2021.
Given   the   brevity   of  her  employment   [Applicant]   did   not  require   or  undergo   the   pre-
employment drug screening process.” (Response  at 12.)
SOR ¶  2.b: On or about September 2021, you tested positive for marijuana
on a urinalysis test administered by your employer. Applicant admitted this allegation.
She  tested  positive  on  a  urinalysis  for marijuana  administered  after an  accident on  her
worksite. She  told the  labor relations representative  present at the  urinalysis that it was
likely she  would  be  testing  positive  for marijuana. (Item  4  at 18, 21-22.)  In  her Answer she
stated  it was possible  that she  may have  consumed  an  edible  at a  party. She  explained
that “at the  party people  can  bring  whatever they want,  it's not far-fetched  to  say that  some
of the  desserts and  food  served  had  a  little extra  something  in it, l  would never know,  I
didn't  feel  anything,  l  was  already   drinking.”  She   also  cited   her  “sweet  tooth”  and   a
fondness for brownies and  noted  that she  could “down a  whole cookie tray” (Answer at
5.)   She   added   that  she   was  around   people   who   were   smoking   marijuana   and   was
“breathing in contaminated air.” (Answer at 5.)
SOR ¶  2.c: From at least August 2014 to at least September 2021, you used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency.  Applicant  acknowledged  in  her  PSI  that  she  had
used  marijuana  on  at least “two  occasions she  could recall.” She acknowledged trying
marijuana edibles and a marijuana lollypop that her family brought back from Europe. She
described taking a marijuana cigarette from a neighbor when she was experiencing a very
bad migraine. (Item 4 at 9.) She tested positive on a urinalysis taken after a workplace
accident in September 2021. She completed her SCA in July 2021. (Item 3; Item 4 at 9;

SOR ¶  3.a: You are  indebted to  the  Federal  Government  for  delinquent  taxes
in  the   amount   of   $6,212.64   for  tax   year  2017.  As  of   the   date of   this   statement   of
Reasons,  the  taxes  remain unpaid.  In  her Answer, Applicant  admitted  the  allegation,
and  said that she  had  reduced  the  debt to  about  $1,800, that she  had  an  arrangement
with  the  IRS  to  apply her income  tax refunds to  the  debt,  that she  expected  to  significantly
reduce  or resolve the  remaining  debt with  her tax year 2022  refund, and  if the refund  was
insufficient to  resolve the  debt,  that she  would  pay the  remaining  balance. (Answer at 2,
6.) She  submitted  documentary evidence  that  her income  tax  overpayments for tax  years
2019  through  2022  were applied  by  the  IRS  to  her 2017  tax year debt including  accrued
penalties,  and  that  after the  IRS  applied  her $1,346  overpayment for tax year 2022. As of
her Response  her remaining  debt balance  was $499.  She  did not provide  documentary
evidence   of  voluntary  payments   or  of  an   arrangement   or  payment   plan   with   the   IRS.
(Answer at  6,  13; Item  4  at  10;  Item  5  at  11;  Response  at 3, 13.)  Based  solely upon  the
significant reduction  in  the  tax debt through  IRS recoupment of her tax refunds  I find  for
Applicant on  SOR ¶ 3.a.
Applicant cites the actions she has done to get her finances and lifestyle in order.
She acknowledges she made “a mistake and got stung” and she is “still feeling the pain
today.”  She  has  “kicked  out”  the  people  who  lived  in  her  home  that  were  smoking
marijuana. She  states she  “won't even  be  around  it or put myself into  a  situation  to  be
exposed again. I already know what it's like to lose just about everything you've worked
hard for behind marijuana.” (Answer at 6; Response.) She notes her finances are getting
better and that she had reduced her tax debt to just under $500 “even though everything
is getting costly.” She included multiple letters from friends in her Response attesting to
her  character,  as  well  as  a  letter  from  her  current  supervisor  who  noted  she  had
demonstrated integrity and trustworthiness. Her Response included two letters from her
treating  family  nurse  practitioner  dated  June  2022  and  May  2023.  Her  treating  family
nurse practitioner noted that she had cared for Applicant since April 2022, that she was
being treated for anxiety and psychoactive substance abuse, that it was her opinion that
the diagnosis of “’other psychoactive substance abuse’ [wa]s in remission,” that she was
compliant with  her treatment plan, and concurrently sees a therapist. (Response at 5-11,

"Applicant  is  a   46-year-old  senior  manager  of  pricing   and   estimating,   who   has

recent clearance in 2011.  Applicant seeks to  not  only  retain his eligibility for a clearance,
which  is a  requirement  of his continued  employment,  but also to  upgrade  his clearance
from   Secret  to   Top   Secret.   (GE   1;   Tr.  16-17,   23-24,  49,  60-61)   He  has   worked   in

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  self-reported  marijuana  use  on  his  February 22,  2022  SF-86. (GE  1; Tr.
46)  He   was   subsequently  interviewed   on   April  8,  2022,  by  an   Office  of  Personnel
Management   (OPM)   investigator  regarding   his  marijuana   use.   He   provided   additional
information   regarding  such   use   in   his  September  29,   2022   Response   to   DOHA
Interrogatories,  in  his  December 22, 2022  SOR Answer,  as well as  during his  testimony.
(SOR Answer; GE 2) The following  findings  summarize  that marijuana  use.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from
about May 1995 to about November 2020,  to include use after being granted a Secret
clearance by the Department of Defense in approximately January 2011.
He  admitted  this  allegation  in  part  and  denied  it  in  part.  In  his  SOR  Answer,
submitted through counsel, he stated:
[Applicant]   admits  to   using   marijuana   sparingly,  approximately   two  (2)
dozen  times  from  May  1995  to  his last and  most  recent use  in  November
2020.  [Applicant]   voluntarily   disclosed   his  past  marijuana   use   on   his   first
[Applicant’s]  personnel  subject
SF-86   application
in   2000,  During
interview,  he   was  subsequently  asked   about  his  drug   use.  Candidly,
[Applicant]  explained  that he  had  smoked  marijuana  approximately  two  (2)
dozen  times since  1995. [Applicant]  was forthright with  his responses and
also  indicated   that   he   had   not   used   any   other   illegal   drugs,  other  than
marijuana   and   had   never  tested   positive  on   any  drug   test.  Given   the
infrequent nature of [Applicant’s] use  over such  a  long  period  of  time  (over
20   years)  he   could   not  recall   the   specific  details  of  each   use.   [Applicant]
was also  candid  regarding  his most recent use  in November 2020.  During
this  time, it  was over Thanksgiving  weekend, and  he  smoked  marijuana  at
a  family gathering  with  his wife’s sister and  her husband. This was  a  lapse
in judgment  on  the  part  of  [Applicant]  and he  has not  used  any  drugs since
November 2020,  a  period  of  over two  (2) years. He also  has  no  intention
to  use  illegal drugs in the  future  as  shown  through  his signed statement  of
intent   and   negative   drug   tests.   [Applicant]   takes  full   responsibility   for  his
actions  and   poor  judgment  he   exhibited   over  two   (2)  years  ago   over
Thanksgiving   weekend.  He  has   taken   several  steps  to  ensure   similar
conduct  is not  repeated  in the  future through  a  favorable  substance  abuse
evaluation   and   taking   an   online   drug   and   alcohol   awareness  course.
(December  22, 2022 SOR Answer, pgs. 7-8)
Applicant  confirmed  his  marijuana  use  during  his  testimony.  His  first  marijuana
use  occurred  at  a  party  in  May  1995  when  he  was  18  years  old.  He  did  not  recall
specific  details  of  his  marijuana  use  over  the  years  given  the  time  lapses  between
infrequent  use.  Friends  or  acquaintances  provided  him  with  marijuana  on  the  rare
occasions that he did use it. (Tr. 25-27, 46-47, 56-58) Since he started working for his
current employer in 2009, Applicant estimated he used marijuana  “approximately once
every  other  year”  at  social  gatherings.  (Tr.  28-29,  47,  56-58)  Marijuana  is  legal  in
Applicant’s  state  of  residence  under state  law,  but  not  under federal law.  He  does  not
have  a  medical  marijuana  card,  nor  has  he  ever  purchased  marijuana  from  a
dispensary. He did not reimburse any of his friends or acquaintances for the marijuana
they provided him. (Tr. 48)
As  noted,  Applicant’s  last  use  of  marijuana  occurred  in  November  2020.  His
from  out  of  town  over
sister-in-law,  her  husband,  and  children  were  visiting
Thanksgiving weekend. Applicant’s wife and her sister have “a complicated relationship”
and  had  “a  pretty  intense  argument”  in  front  of  the  children  on  Thanksgiving  Day.
Applicant’s  in-laws  had  marijuana  in  their  possession  that  they  had  legally  purchased
from a dispensary. On the Saturday evening after Thanksgiving, the four adults smoked
marijuana  after  the  children  had  gone  to  bed.  Applicant  “unfortunately”  did  not  think
about  his  clearance  at  the  time  of  consumption.  He  had  not  worked  on  any  classified
projects up until that point. (Tr. 29-32)
Applicant has not been offered any marijuana since November 2020 and has no
intention  of  using  marijuana  in  the  future.  Since  then,  Applicant  has  not  been  in  any
environment  where  drugs  were  involved.  He  understands  holding  a  clearance  is  a
privilege  and  understands  that  those  who  are  extended  that  privilege  are  required  to
abide by all the rules and regulations. He further understands that clearance holders are
required  to  abide  by  all  the  rules  and  regulations  outside  of  work  as  well.  Applicant
stated that he will never use marijuana again. (Tr. 32-34) He elaborated:
The risks of using marijuana  again is just –  is –  the  consequences of doing
so   are  too   great.   I   have   a   much   –   much   firmer  understanding   of  the
consequences  of  what  –   of  what  doing  that  kind  of thing  will  do. It  will  be
detrimental to  my  career. It  will  be  detrimental to  my ability to  provide  for
my  family.  Furthermore,  I  am   on   a  program   right  now where  I  do   access
classified   information   on   a   need-to-know  basis.  The   responsibilities  that
you   just  outlined   that  come   with   the   privilege   of  having   a   security
clearance,  I   guess  they  are  –   they   are  in   the   forefront   of   my   mind   each
and   every   single   day.  I   –   I  am   reminded   on   a   daily  basis   that  I   am
accessing   classified   information,   that  I   have   a   responsibility   to   safeguard
that  information, so  nothing  to  –  I just  simply don’t want to  do  anything  that
could in  any  way,  shape  or form  jeopardize  my ability to  continue  growing
in my current career path. (Tr. 34)
Applicant’s wife does not use marijuana. She fully supports his abstinence from
marijuana. He does not have any friends or acquaintances who use marijuana. If any of
his  friends  or  acquaintances  ever  did  offer  him  marijuana,  his answer  would  be  a  firm
hard, “No. Please keep it away from me.” (Tr. 48-49, 55-56) He understands that even
though  marijuana  is  legal  in  his  state  of  residence,  its  possession  and  use  are  illegal
under federal law. (Tr. 52)
Applicant  was  queried  regarding  an  October  18,  1999  subject  interview
statement  in  which  he  stated  that  he  had  no  intentions  of  using  illegal  drugs  in  the
future.  He  was  22  years  old  in  October  1999.  (Tr.  35-36,  56;  GE  5)  He  confirmed  his
testimony that he does not intend to use drugs in the future and explained the difference
between “then and now”:
A  couple of things (are  different).  Number one, I just received  a  –  received
a   promotion   where  I  am   supporting   a   classified   program.  I  –   again,   I’m
accessing  classified  information  on  a daily basis. In  order to  keep  my job, I
need  to  be  granted  a  Top  Secret  clearance  to  get to  my next  caveat  [sic]
of  –   of   program   –
level  clearance.  The   consequences   of   –   the
consequences  of  not  doing  that –  that transgression  of  smoking  marijuana
could  cause   or  just   –   it’s  just   too   great  of   a   price   to   pay.  It’s  not  –   it  is
absolutely positively, no way worth the risk.
Other  thing  that has changed  between  then  and  now, I am  married. I now
have  a  family. I’m  the  sole breadwinner of  my family. So  providing  income
for my wife  and  three  children  is probably my –  my number one  priority in
life  and  doing  anything  to  jeopardize  my ability to  do  that is not something
I’m willing to do, especially something  like smoking  marijuana.
I  think  the   other –   the   other thing  that  has  changed   since   1999   to   today,
this  whole   experience,  reading   the   Statement   of   Reasons,   hiring   you,
coming   into   this  courtroom   for  this   –   this  hearing  today,   I  have   an
absolutely crystal  clear  understanding  of what the  consequences of  that –
of those  actions are going  to  be, I think. Past transgressions, I lost  sight of
the   consequences.   Being   so   firmly  aware   of  what   they  are  now,  I  –   I
cannot  imagine   ever  doing   it  again.   I  don’t  –   I  don’t  want   to   ever  do   this
again. I don’t want to  ever see  a  Statement  of  Reasons again. I  don’t want
to  ever be  in this courtroom again.  To be frank  with you.  (Tr. 36-37)
Applicant affirmed that he has grown as an individual over the past 30 years and
learned  from  his  past  mistakes.  (Tr.  37-38)  His  November  2020  use  of  marijuana
occurred as a result of a stressful family situation. Since then, he has adopted a more
disciplined approach to physical exercise, that he has “found is probably my single best
thing I do to help cope with stress,” and spends more time with his children. (Tr. 38-39)
Applicant  submitted  a  signed,  sworn,  statement  of  intent,  dated  November  11,
2022, to avoid any future drug use or other illegal drugs both presently and in the future,
with the understanding that any drug violation will result in the  automatic revocation of
clearance.  (Tr.  39-40;  AE  I)  He  completed  a  four-hour  drug  and  alcohol  awareness
class  on  December 9, 2022, a four-hour behavior modification  class  on December 10,
2022,  and  a  four-hour  marijuana  education  class  on  December  10,  2022.  (Tr.  40-41;
AE  K  - AE  M)  A  highly  credentialed  licensed  psychologist  (LP)  completed  a
comprehensive  substance  abuse  evaluation  of  Applicant.  LP’s  summary  of  the
psychological evaluation, dated December 14, 2022, states in part:
It   appears,  however,   that   the   Top   Secret   investigative   process  gave
[Applicant]  pause  to  reflect  on  his marijuana  use. He took time  to  process
the   matter   in  an   intentional  mindful   way  that  brought   him   to   new   insight
about  it.  He  then   acted   by  disclosing   his   past  drug   use   despite   the
possible   consequences  for  his  career.  As  the   process  progressed   to   an
SOR,  the  gravity of the  situation  seems to  have  set  in for him. In  colloquial
terms,   [Applicant]   is  sufficiently   “freaked   out”   by  the   potential   loss   of   his
clearance,  his job,  and  his financial security that it  now seems exceedingly
unlikely he will ever use marijuana again.
CONCLUSION: Based  on  all  the  available data, [Applicant]  does  not have
any  substance   use   condition   or  behavioral  tendencies  that  could  impact
his  reliability,   trustworthiness,   or   judgment   in   the   context   of   safeguarding
classified  information  or working  in  a  cleared  setting. (Tr. 41-42; AE  N, AE
O)
Applicant submitted negative drug tests for urine samples collected on December
6,  2022,  December  20,  2022,  February  13,  2023,  February  28,  2023,  and  March  13,
2023. (AE J, AE O) Applicant has never been disciplined by his employer. He considers
himself to be an honest and trustworthy person with high moral character. He does not
consider  himself  to  be  a  threat  to  national  security  and  could  not  be  coerced  into
divulging national security secrets based on the SOR allegations. Applicant’s employer
promotes a drug-free workplace. Apart from the entry level drug test he took in 2009, he
has not been drug tested by his employer. He has never used drugs while at work or on
company property. (Tr. 52-54; GE 4)
Character  Evidence
Applicant  submitted  his  most  recent  work  performance  reviews  from  2019  to
2021. Those reviews document sustained superior performance and rate him as a “top
performer.”  Management  views  him  as  a  subject  matter  expert  and  placed  him  in
leadership  roles  and  positions  of  responsibility.  Applicant  is  a  trusted  employee  within
his company as well as with his company’s customer base. (AE H)
Applicant  was  awarded  a  global  credential  in  project  management  professional
certificate  on  December  15,  2017.  He  was  also  awarded  a  professional  certificate  in
project management by a state university on December 13, 2018, for having completed
a curriculum of 210 hours of study. (AE G)
Applicant  submitted  six  work-related  reference  letters  from  managers  and
directors or former directors in his employer’s corporation.  All of these individuals are or
were senior company executives. They have worked with Applicant and know him well.
They  are  also  familiar  with  his  SOR  allegation  and  self-reported  marijuana  use.  The
collective sense of these letters conveys a number of positive attributes, to include his
integrity, trustworthiness, work ethic, value to the company, contribution to the national
fully  support  the
defense,  dedication,  and  valuable  service.  These
continuation and upgrade of Applicant’s security clearance. (AE C, AE P; Tr. 58-61)

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency
from about July 2005 to about September 2022. Applicant first used marijuana when she
was 16 years old. (Tr. 23) She stopped using marijuana from the age of 17 until she was
about 21. (Tr. 24-25, 27) In May and July 2011, the police went to Applicant’s residence
on two occasions in 2011 because of alcohol-related altercations Applicant had with her
boyfriend. (Tr. 31-32; AE B) She was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUI) in 2012. (Tr. 27) She enrolled in a drug and alcohol counseling program  in 2012,
and her first drug tests were positive for marijuana use. (Tr. 28)  She received deferred
adjudication for her DUI. (Tr. 28-29)
Applicant used  marijuana  about every four months  around  2012  or 2013. (Tr. 24,
33)  She  stopped  using  marijuana  from  2013  to  2016. (Tr. 34) She  was fired  from  three
jobs  from   2015   to   2018;  however,  marijuana   use   was  not  a   contributing   cause   of  the
terminations.  (Tr. 34-35)  In  2019  to  2020,  she  used  marijuana  about  once  a  week,  and  in

December 2020 to September 2022. (Tr. 39)
In  June  2022, Applicant was granted, and  in  July 2022, she  was informed  that she
was granted  a  security  clearance. (Tr. 42;  SOR response  at 2)  Her September 13,  2022
Office  of  Personnel Management (OPM)  summary  states  that  in  response  to  a  question
about her future marijuana  use,  Applicant said, “[She] intends  to  smoke  marijuana  on  a
rare occasion.” (Tr. 40; GE  2  at  4) Applicant said her comment to  the  OPM  investigator
was misconstrued  and  misunderstood, and  the  summary should have  said in the  past she
smoked  marijuana  on  a  rare occasion. (Tr. 40) She  used  marijuana  on  September 10,
2022, which  was one  week before her OPM  interview. (Tr. 41; SOR response  at 2) She
only took one  puff  on  the  marijuana  cigarette, and  she  instantly regretted  her marijuana
use. (Tr.  42) The  person  who  gave  her the  marijuana  left  the  state  where  she  lives.  (Tr.
41)  She disclosed the  September 2022 marijuana use to the OPM investigator. (GE 2)
Applicant did not use any illegal drugs after September 2022. (Tr. 42) She ended
her relationship and associations with persons who she knows to be marijuana users. (Tr.
42-43) The only illegal drug she has used is marijuana. (Tr. 43)
Applicant  “provid[ed]  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse
is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.” (GE 2 at 14)
Applicant  emphasized  that  she  voluntarily  reported  her  involvement  with
marijuana; her marijuana use is not recent; her marijuana use was not a pattern; she did
not have any drug paraphernalia; and she does not intend to use marijuana in the future.

Applicant  provided  nine  character  statements  including  from  a  project  leader,
foreman,  former  supervisor,  facility  security  officer,  and  other  coworkers.  (AE  B)  The
general  sense  of  her  character  statements  is  that  Applicant  is  diligent,  friendly,  family

employers. A physician assistant who has treated her for ten years indicated she is not
addicted  to  marijuana;  she  is  psychologically  stable;  and  her  marijuana  use  was  very
limited and primarily when she was a teenager. (AE C) Her character evidence supports
approval of her access to classified information.

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted one of the allegations in the SOR, except that
he  admitted  using  marijuana  only  up  until  “at  least  March  2022.”  (¶  1.a;  See  SOR
Answer  at  Item  3),  and  denied  the  other  allegation  (¶  1.b).  He  also  provided  some
explanation for his conduct.  I  adopt  his partial  admission  to  SOR ¶  1.a  as a  finding of
fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following additional findings of fact. (Items 1, 3)
Applicant is 25  years  old.  He  is single,  never has married,  and  has no  children.
He  has  worked   as   a   network  technician   for his  current  employer,   a   federal   contractor,
since  March  2022.  That contractor is subject  to  the  drug-free  workplace  provisions  of  41
U.S.C.  701   et  seq.   Applicant   completed   his  academic   requirements  for  his   bachelor’s
degree, but as of  May 2022, it had not been  awarded.  (Items  4,  5)
The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  H,  that  Applicant  used  and  purchased
marijuana  from  May  2015  to  at  least  May  2022  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  It  also  alleged  that
Applicant  used  marijuana  after  completing  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on
April 7, 2022 (SOR ¶ 1.b).
Applicant  admitted  his  marijuana  use  in  his  April  2022  SCA,  his  May  2022
personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an  investigator,  and  in  his  March  2023  SOR
answer. In his SOR answer, he denied using and purchasing marijuana after completing
his SCA in April 2022. As noted above, his admissions of marijuana use and purchasing
consistently used March 2022 as his cessation date. (Items 3-4)
During Applicant’s PSI, he stated that his marijuana use started in approximately
2014-2015 after he fell off a truck and injured his back.  He admitted not getting proper
medical  treatment  for  his  injury  and  instead  started  using  marijuana  for  pain
management. In approximately June 2015, he began getting marijuana from his friends
and smoking it to alleviate his back pain. He used marijuana irregularly from June 2015
to August 2016. He abstained from August 2016 to March 2017. After March 2017, he
started using marijuana on weekends sporadically. This frequency of use continued until
December 2018 when he stopped again. (Item 5)
In  June  2018,  Applicant  was  ticketed  for  possession  of  marijuana  because  his
passenger had lit up a marijuana joint just as the police officer arrived. The charge was
dismissed when his friend admitted ownership of the marijuana. (Item 5)
The  information  in  Applicant’s  PSI  summary  about  the  end  of  his  marijuana
activity  is  vague  and  contradictory  to  his  earlier  admissions  of  marijuana  use  and
purchasing from May 2015 to March 2022. The ambiguous language from his PSI is:
Since   03/2020   to   present,  the   Subject   no   longer  uses   marijuana   on
weekends  because   he   works  on   weekends.  He  occasionally   uses
marijuana   throughout  the   week  on   as  [sic]  a   needed   basis  to   help  with
pain management particularly  at night when  the  pain  causes  lack of  sleep.
(Item  5)
In his earlier SCA, Applicant stated his use frequency was, “Nightly or weekends
only.  1-2  joints.”  The  investigator  did  not  clarify  the  discrepancy  between  these  two
statements.  Additionally,  the  investigator  did  not  clarify  what  the  term  “to  present”
meant.  Was  Applicant  saying  he  used  marijuana  up  through  his  PSI  interview  in  May
2022?  Or  was  he  saying  that  his  use  was  up  until  he  began  working  for  his  current
employer in March 2022, which would be consistent with his earlier answers as to when
he  stopped  using  marijuana?  Because  of  these  ambiguities  in  his  PSI  interview
summary, which he did not authenticate, I find Applicant’s statements that he ended his
marijuana use in  March  2022 more credible than the  information  contained in his PSI.
(Items 4-5)
Applicant  provided  medical  information,  attached  to  his  SOR  answer,  that
described  his  back  pain  issues.  The  doctor  performing  the  most  recent  examination
(sometime in 2021) recommended?  that Applicant should seek a surgery consult, or if
no surgery was recommended, he should start physical therapy. No further information
was provided. (Item 3)
To  help  with  his  back  pain,  Applicant  avers  he  now  follows  his  doctor’s  advice
regarding pain management, performs yoga, wears a back brace, uses a massage gun,
meditates daily, uses CBD cream, and stretches. He longer associates with people who
are known drug users. (Items 3, 5)
",True
"Applicant is 41-year-old, married, and has a minor child and an adult stepchild. He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2011.  Since  April  2020  he  has  worked  for  two  federal
contractors as an engineer. He enlisted in the U.S. Army from 2003 to 2007 and then the
Army Reserve from 2007 to 2011. Applicant deployed to a war zone in about 2004 for
one  year  and  served  in  a  dangerous  part  of  that  country  as  a  part  of  the  Army’s
communications operations. He was honorably discharged from both the Army and the
Army  Reserve.  He  has  been  diagnosed  with  combat-related  post-traumatic  stress
disorder (PTSD) and has a 30 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA). He was granted a secret clearance in 2010 in connection with his military
service. His security clearance status in 2005 and before is discussed below under SOR
¶ 1.d. He applied for a security clearance in April 2020 (2020 SCA), and he submitted a
second application, the e-QIP, in March 2022. (Tr. at 14-18; GE 1 at 5, 8-9, 17-21, 28-29,
35-36; AE G.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for access to classified or sensitive information  because he has used illegal drugs and
had used illegal drugs in the past when he held a security clearance. In the Answer, he
admitted all the allegations under this paragraph of the original SOR with explanations.
Applicant wrote that in 2012 a physician gave him a card to permit him to purchase and
use medical marijuana under the laws of his state of residence (State 1) to help him with
his PTSD symptoms. He used marijuana a couple of times per week to relieve his anxiety
and  to  help  him  sleep.  He  claimed  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  in  2015  when  his
PTSD symptoms eased. Applicant’s wife also received a physician’s card permitting her
to purchase and use medical marijuana to help her deal with her own medical issue of
insomnia. (Answer at 1-2; Tr. at 19-21; AE C; AE D; AE T; AE U.)
SOR  ¶  1.a.   Purchases  of  Marijuana,  June  2012  to  July  2022.  During  the  dates
alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  purchased  medical  marijuana  in  State  1  through
dispensaries.  He  never  purchased  marijuana  illegally  under  the  laws  of  State  1.  He
purchased the marijuana for himself and his wife because he received a discount as a
veteran. He testified that he purchased medical marijuana for his own use until June 2015,
when he claimed that he stopped using marijuana. He continued purchasing marijuana
for his wife after June 2015 so that the purchases were less expensive with his discount.
His  wife  stopped  using  marijuana  in  July  2022,  and  Applicant  stopped  purchasing
marijuana at that time. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 22-25; GE 1 at 6-8; GE 2 at 14; GE 3 at 5-6,
16.)
SOR  ¶  1.b.   Use  of  Marijuana,  June  2012  to  about  June  2019.  In  the  Answer,
Applicant admitted using marijuana from 2012 until 2015. At the hearing, he testified that
his used marijuana from June 2012 to “about June 2015” to help him with his PTSD. He
denied any marijuana use at any subsequent time. Applicant’s wife provided a notarized
statement after the hearing confirming that Applicant’s last use of marijuana was in 2015.
He had prepared a security clearance application in April 2020 (2020 SCA), in which he
had disclosed marijuana use from June 2012  to June 2019. He testified  that the 2019
date was “a typo.” He said that the correct last date of marijuana use was in “about June
2015. He designated the month of June as an estimate because he was “pretty certain”
that he stopped using marijuana in the middle of 2015. He then testified, “So, June, 2015,
was the last time I used [marijuana].” (Answer at 2; Tr. at 19-21, 25-27; GE 2 at 14; AE
S.)
As  discussed  below  in  detail,  I  have  significant  concerns  about  Applicant’s
credibility  on  several  factual  issues.  In  this  instance,  I  find  that  Applicant’s  last  use  of
marijuana was in about June 2015, as he testified. The critical difference with respect to
this  issue  is  that  Applicant  provided  collaborating  evidence  in  the  form  of  his  wife’s
notarized statement.
SOR ¶ 1.c. Article 15, UCMJ, Wrongful Use and Possession of Marijuana in 2005.
Applicant failed a drug test conducted on  February 22, 2005, while serving in the U.S.
Army and deployed to a European country. He claimed that he used marijuana once in
December 2004 during his leave at Christmas 2004. He received non-judicial punishment
(NJP). The SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that his punishment for using marijuana
was a reduction in grade from E-3 to E-1, forfeiture of pay, and the imposition of extra
duty. Certain documents in the record incorrectly refer to the drug used by Applicant as
MDMA  (ecstasy)  rather  than  marijuana.  Applicant  made  the  same  mistake  during  his
background interviews because he did not understand that MDMA  and marijuana were
two  different,  unrelated  drugs.  He  testified  that  the  only  drug  he  has  ever  used  was
marijuana.  The  FBI  report  in  the  record  also  incorrectly  refers  to  MDMA  rather  than
marijuana.  The  Army  records  regarding  the  drug  test,  the  NJP,  and  the  investigative
report in the record all refer to Applicant’s positive test for marijuana and his punishment
for using marijuana. I find that all references in the record to MDMA are erroneous and
should have referred to marijuana. (Tr. at 28-29, 64; GE 3 at 5-7, 15-16; GE 4 at 1-4; GE
5 at 1-2)
SOR  ¶  1.d.  Use  of  Marijuana  in  2005  while  Granted  Access  to  Classified
Information. Prior to the 2005 incident in which Applicant was charged as alleged in SOR
¶  1.c,  above,  Applicant  had  been  granted  access  to  classified  information.  Applicant
acknowledged  at  the  hearing  that  prior  to  2005  he  had  prepared  a  security  clearance
application.  He  testified  he  was  unaware  whether  he  had  actually  been  granted  a
clearance. During cross examination, he acknowledged that during his deployment to a
war  zone  in  2004,  he  was  responsible  for  using  classified  communication  equipment,
which required a security clearance (and access to classified information, in this case, the
classified  equipment).  Applicant’s  admissions  are  sufficient  to  establish  by  substantial
evidence  the  fact  that  he  held  a  security  clearance  and  had  access  to  classified
information during his deployment. There was no evidence in the record that his clearance
was ever revoked upon his return on home leave to the United States or thereafter on his
deployment to a European country. Applicant testified that during his leave in the United
States   in  December  2004   he   used   marijuana.  He   subsequently  tested   positive   for  the
drug  in a  random  drug  test  after he  deployed  to  Europe.  (Hearing  Ex.  I;  Tr. at  23-24,  38-
40; GE 3 at 9, 11-12, 15-16.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for access to classified or sensitive information because he deliberately omitted in the e-
QIP his past uses and purchases of marijuana. In the Answer, Applicant admitted the two
allegations in this paragraph with explanations.
SOR ¶ ¶  2.a  and  2.b. Falsification  in  the  e-QIP  regarding  Applicant’s  Use (SOR ¶
2.a) and  Purchases  of  Marijuana  (SOR ¶  2.b)  in the  Last Seven  Years, as  alleged  in  SOR
¶¶ 1.b  and  1.a, respectively.  Section  23  of the  e-QIP  asks  whether  Applicant  has used  or
purchased  any illegal drugs in the  past seven  years. He answered  both  questions in the
negative, when  in  fact he  had  used  and  purchased  marijuana  within  seven  years of the
e-QIP, which  he  signed  and  certified  as “true,  complete, and  correct”  on  March 31, 2022.
He testified  that his last  use  of marijuana  was  in June  2015, which was less than  seven
years prior to  the  e-QIP  certification  date.  He also admitted  that  he  continued  to  purchase
marijuana  for his wife  until July 2022,  when  she  last used  medical marijuana. (Tr. at 19-
27; GE 1 at 33-34.)
Applicant claimed in his Answer that he mistakenly answered the e-QIP question
by  failing  to  disclose  that  he  used  marijuana  in  2015.  He  wrote  that  he  was  uncertain
whether his last use of marijuana was within the seven years prior to the date of the e-
QIP.  Applicant  also  claimed  in  his  August  2022  background  interview  that  he  had  not
used marijuana  since  December  2004  when  he  was  in  the  Army, as  discussed  above
under SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. In a follow-up interview on August 3, 2022, Applicant again
denied  that  he  had  used  marijuana  since  2004.  He  insisted  that  all  of  his  marijuana
purchases were solely for his wife’s medical use. He denied having PTSD. I note that the
VA awarded Applicant a 30% disability award in a letter dated January 10, 2022, about
seven months prior to the follow-up interview. As a result of his false statements in his
interview, DOHA in its interrogatories did not ask him when he last used marijuana. The
only question asked was simply whether he had used marijuana since August 2022. (GE
1 at 33-34, 59; GE 2 at 14; GE 3 at 5, 12, 16; AE C; AE D at 1.)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that “in [his] head” his last use of marijuana was
before  the  seven-year  reporting  period,  which  began  on  March  31,  2015.  This  was
inconsistent with his admission at the hearing that his last use was in about June 2015.
In  weighing  Applicant’s credibility on  the  factual issue  of why  he  omitted  his  marijuana
use  in  2015  from  the  e-QIP,  I  have  considered  his  success  in  earning  a  Bachelor  of
Science  degree  in  Networking  and  Communications  Management  and  working  in
responsible positions as an engineer for two U.S. Government contractors. Also, I have
weighed his demeanor at the hearing and his lack of credibility on several factual issues,
as discussed above and as set forth below. I find that Applicant’s testimony that he was
confused about the dates covered by the seven-year question regarding past drug use
lacked  credibility.  Accordingly,  I  conclude  that  Applicant  deliberately  omitted  material
information about his use of marijuana from the e-QIP. (Tr. at 30; GE 2 at 14; AE S; AE
T.)
Applicant  admitted purchasing marijuana for his wife  from  2012 to 2022,  yet  he
also failed to disclose these actions in the e-QIP. He testified that his incorrect answer
was due to being “mixed up” about what this question and the prior question about drug
use meant. He admitted at the hearing that he should have answered this question in the
affirmative. I note again that Applicant’s education and important work experience raise
serious  questions  about  the  credibility  of  his  claim  of  being  confused  by  the  simple
language in the e-QIP, as does his demeanor at the hearing. He alternatively explained
in his background interview that he did not list his purchases of marijuana because his
purchases were legal under the laws of State 1 and the e-QIP question asks whether he
has  “been  involved  in  the  illegal  purchase  .  .  .  of  any  drug?”  Applicant’s  inconsistent
excuses  for  his  patently  incorrect  answer  to  the  e-QIP  question  further  undercuts  his
credibility  about  his  e-QIP  omission.  I  conclude  that  Applicant  intentionally  failed  to
disclose that he had purchased marijuana during the seven-year period covered by the
question. (Tr. at 31; GE 3 at 16; AE L.)
During  the  security  clearance  background  investigation,  Applicant  did  not
voluntarily admit his positive drug test and NJP in 2005. The investigator had to confront
him about the 2004-2005 incidents. Also, he has offered two inconsistent versions of the
events surrounding his marijuana use in late 2004 after his return from deployment. In his
background interview, he reported that he attended a Christmas party with high school
friends  who  were  smoking  marijuana,  which  he  mistakenly  referred  to  as  MDMA,  not
knowing the difference between the two drugs. He stated that he was offered marijuana
by  a  friend  and  smoked  it.  At  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  did  not  know  that  the
cigarette that  he  was given  was  really  marijuana.  He presented to a  psychologist  who
prepared a report for this case the same story about his accidental use of marijuana and
told the  psychologist that  he  “immediately discontinued  using” what he  thought  was  an
ordinary cigarette. These inconsistencies further undermine Applicant’s credibility. (Tr. at
28, 46-49, 55-58; GE 3 at 9, 11; AE Q at 2.)
Applicant’s credibility is also strained by his contention in his background interview
that the only time he used marijuana (intentionally or accidentally) in the 2004 and 2005
timeframe was at the December 2004 Christmas party while on home leave in State 1 for
two  weeks. He failed to  mention his use  of marijuana during the 2012  to 2015 period.
With respect to his 2004 use of marijuana, he advised the investigator that he returned to
his overseas deployment location  in Europe shortly thereafter. He testified that he was
drug  tested  “as  soon  as  we  got  back  from  the  two-week  break.” He  tested positive for
marijuana. According to the Army’s records, the drug test was actually administered on
February 22, 2005, about two months later. In the Army investigative records, Applicant
is reported to have advised the investigators that he consumed marijuana on February
13, 2005, while in State 1. In fact, his leave had ended several weeks before that date.
These  inconsistencies  are  significant.  Although  there  is  no  evidence  in  the  record
regarding the time period for the drug to produce a positive drug test after consumption,
it  strains  credibility  that  Applicant’s  one-time  use  of  marijuana  in  late  December  2004
would produce a positive test result for THC in late February 2005. The SOR does not
allege this inconsistency regarding  the  date of Applicant’s use  of marijuana  prior to his
drug  test.  However,  the  inconsistency  raises  an  issue  regarding  Applicant’s  general
candor and credibility. (Tr. at 28-29, 62; GE 3 at 9,11; GE 4 at 3-4.)
Mitigation  and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant provided extensive evidence in mitigation and in support of a favorable
whole-person  assessment.  I  have  carefully  reviewed  all  of  the  evidence  and  note  the
following specific items: Applicant provided a written statement of his intent to never use
or possess an illegal drug in the future. He also provided his PTSD medical diagnosis and
his  30  percent  VA  disability  rating.  He  provided  his  DD  214  evidencing  his  honorable
discharge from the Army. The DD 214 also listed the various medals and commendations
he was awarded during his military service, copies of which were also provided. (AE A;
AE C; AE D; AE G; AE H.)
In addition, Applicant provided six character-reference letters and a notarized letter
from his wife. The letters state that he works as an engineer providing valuable expertise
with data and computer systems. In October 2022 he was promoted to a lead position.
Two Army veterans who served with Applicant in a war zone praised his work ethic and
loyalty to the United States. Applicant’s wife described her husband as “a dedicated family
man” and an “honorable, dependable U.S citizen.” (AE I; AE R; AE S.)
Applicant also submitted a Summary of Psychological Evaluation prepared by a
Board-Certified Psychologist. The psychologist concluded that despite Applicant’s history
of PTSD and use of medical marijuana in the past, his “current judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness are not negatively affected or impaired from any psychological condition,
substance use disorder, or underlying defect.” (AE Q at 6.)
",False
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b, and 3.a.  (HE 3) He
denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b.  (Id.)  He  also  provided  extenuating  and
mitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old systems engineer. (Tr. 7; SOR response at 25) In 2012,
he  graduated  from  high  school,  and  in  2020,  he  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
mechanical engineering. (Tr. 7) He has never married, and he does not have any children.
(Tr. 8)
Applicant  served  in the  Army National Guard  (ARNG) from  2016  to  2022. (Tr. 8,
28)  He   held   a   signal   military  occupational   specialty   (MOS)   in   the   ARNG.  He   was
discharged  as a  specialist (E-4), and  he  received  an  honorable discharge. (Tr. 8) He did
not serve  in a  combat  zone.  (Tr. 9) He did not receive any nonjudicial punishments  or
courts-martial  while in the  ARNG.  (Tr. 9)  He received  a  security clearance  in  2016  as part
of  his  ARNG  service.  (Tr.  26)   Information   about  his  education   and   professional
experience is detailed in his resume. (SOR response at 25)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Criminal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges from about March of 2013 to about May of 2019, Applicant used
cocaine with varying frequency. The first time he used cocaine was around March 2013
when he was a freshman in college. (Tr. 28-29) He used a small amount of cocaine, which
he referred to as a “bump.” (Tr. 29)
Prior to May 2019, Applicant most recently drilled with the ARNG in March 2019.
The next time he used cocaine after March of 2013 was in May of 2019. (Tr. 30) His older
brother provided the cocaine that he used. (Tr. 31) He snorted a single line of cocaine on
four different weekend nights in May 2019. (Tr. 33) He used cocaine because his brother
wanted  him  to  try  it;  however,  he  did  not  really  like  it.  (Tr.  34)  He  realized  that  using
cocaine was wrong, particularly because he held a security clearance. (Tr. 34) He does
not intend to use cocaine in the future. (Tr. 34) On August 31, 2023, he took a drug test,
which was negative for illegal substances. (Tr. 34; AE C) He visits his older brother, who
lives in a different state than Applicant, once or twice a year on holidays. (Tr. 35)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges in about June 2019, Applicant used the prescription medication
Xanax without a prescription.
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges in about June 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with
public  intoxication  and  possession  of  cocaine.  Applicant’s  brother  gave  him  a  bag
containing cocaine in May 2019, and he used some and placed the remainder in his wallet
behind a flap. (Tr. 57-58) The small bag contained cocaine residue, and Applicant forgot
that he put it in his wallet. (Tr. 44, 56, 58; SOR response) In June 2019, he consumed
one Xanax pill and sufficient alcohol to be intoxicated. (Tr. 53-54; SOR response) He went
to a concert and argued with a spectator about seating. (Tr. 54; SOR response) Applicant
was ejected from the concert. He tried to reenter the concert, and he was arrested for
public intoxication. (Tr. 54-55) The police found the cocaine in his wallet and charged him
with cocaine possession. (Tr. 44-45) Applicant received pretrial diversion. (Tr. 45) He was
required  to  complete 10  hours  of  community  service,  to attend  drug  education,  and  to
submit to urinalysis tests once a month for six months. (Tr. 46-47; SOR response) On
June 5, 2020, he completed a 12-hour drug and alcohol awareness class. (AE D) The
charges  were  subsequently  dismissed,  and  his  record  was  expunged.  (Tr.  45;  SOR
response) He did not receive any disciplinary action from the ARNG. (Tr. 48)
Applicant  never  failed  a  drug  test.  (Tr.  48)  He  emphasized  that  he  freely  and
voluntarily disclosed his history of cocaine involvement and abuse of Xanax without being
confronted with information about his drug involvement by security officials. (Tr. 50-51)
Alleged Falsification of SCAs
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on his September
8, 2016 SCA in Section 23, concerning illegal use of drugs or drug activity. His September
8,  2016  SCA  asked  in  the  last  seven  years  have  you  illegally  used  any  controlled
substance, for example, cocaine and crack cocaine? Applicant answered, “No,” and did
not disclose his use of cocaine in 2013.
In his SOR response for the alleged falsification of his September 8, 2016 SCA,
Applicant said he completed this SCA as part of a Military Entrance Processing Station
(MEPS) process when he was joining the ARNG. (HE 2 at 3) The SCA was completed
with the help of a government representative who rapidly asked him questions. (Id.) He
said, “I can only speculate that being rushed through the questions may have caused me
to overlook the single instance of illegal drug use (cocaine)  from March 2013.” (Id.) He
contended that the falsification was not deliberate, and it was isolated and not recent. (Id.)
He said he also “made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being
confronted with the facts.” (Id.) He disclosed the March 2013 cocaine use during his April
2022 OPM interview. (Id.)
Applicant’s  description  of  the  completion  of  his  September  8,  2016  SCA  at  his
hearing was consistent with his SOR response. (Tr. 36) In sum, the  MEPS interviewer
asked the questions so quickly he did not remember his single episode of cocaine use in
March of 2013. (Tr. 37-38) He said he did not deliberately or intentionally fail to disclose
that cocaine use on the SCA he completed in 2016. (Tr. 38-39)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant’s January 17, 2022 SCA asked in the last seven
years  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances,  and  have  you  ever
illegally  used  or  otherwise  been  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while
possessing  a  security  clearance?  It  also  asked  in  the  last  seven  years,  have  you
intentionally engaged in the misuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not
the drugs were prescribed for you or someone else? Applicant answered, “No,” to these
questions, and he did not disclose his involvement with cocaine in May 2019 and Xanax
in June 2019.
In  his  SOR  response  for  the  alleged  falsification  of  his  January  17,  2022  SCA,
Applicant said he was in a hurry when he completed his SCA because he had to catch a
flight.  He  said  he  completed  his  SCA  before  the  trip,  and  he  disclosed  his  history  of
cocaine use. (Tr. 40, 43) When he returned, he was required to complete the SCA, and
he erroneously believed the cocaine use was repopulated on the second SCA. (Tr. 40)
The information from the 2016 SCA may have partially repopulated on to the 2022 SCAs.
(Tr. 41-42) He reviewed the SCA quickly and did not notice his history of cocaine use was
not on the second SCA. He forgot to disclose his Xanax use on both SCAs. (Tr. 40) His
failure to disclose his cocaine and Xanax use was “due to accidental oversight” and not
deliberate;  and  he  said  he  “made  prompt,  good-faith  efforts  to  correct  the  falsification
before being confronted with the facts.” (HE 2 at 2)
When Applicant completed his January 17, 2022 SCA, he included his arrest for
public intoxication and cocaine possession in June 2019. (GE 2 at 33) He said,  “I was
arrested for public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance (Cocaine less
than  1  gram).  The  cocaine  offense  was  a  felony,  and  the  public  intoxication  was  a
misdemeanor.” (Id. at 34) These charges were dismissed and expunged. (Id. at 35; SOR
response) When he had his follow-up OPM interview on April 14, 2023, he disclosed his
use of cocaine on four occasions, once in 2013 and three times in May 2019, and his use
of Xanax in June 2019 before his arrest at the concert. (Tr. 43; GE 3-4 at 12-13) During
his hearing, he said he used cocaine a total of five time, once in 2013 and four times in
May 2019. (Tr. 33)
Character Evidence
On March 17, 2023, and August 11, 2023, Applicant received achievement awards
from  his  employer.  (SOR  response  at  23;  AE  B)  He  also  received  a  cash  award  for
exceptional performance and an undated exceptional performance certificate. (Id. at 24;
AE A) He provided six statements from coworkers and supervisors. (SOR response at
11-16)  The  general  sense  of  their  statements  is  that  he  is  helpful,  intelligent,  diligent,
conscientious about safeguarding sensitive information, and passionate about his work.
He has sound judgment; he contributes to mission accomplishment; and he is committed
to working as an engineer supporting DOD. (AE E; SOR response at 11-16)
",True
"In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  all  SOR  allegations.  Applicant’s
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. (Item 2)
Applicant is 23 years old. Since 2022, Applicant has been employed by a defense
contractor  and  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance.  He  attended  college  from  2018  to
2022, but did not graduate. He is single and has no children. (Item 3)
The   SOR  alleges   under  Guideline   H   that  Applicant   used   marijuana   (THC)  with
varying  frequency  from  March 2018  to  February 2023. (SOR ¶  1.a: Item  3  at 33; Item  4
at 6-7, 13); that Applicant used  mushrooms on  one  occasion  in November 2021  (SOR ¶
2.a:   Item   4   at  7);  and   that   Applicant   used   Lysergic  Acid  Diethylamide   (LSD)   on   two
occasions in March 2019 and  August 2020. (SOR ¶ 3.a: Item  4 at 7).
Applicant listed his illegal marijuana use on his September 2022 SCA in response
to Section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. He estimated he used marijuana on
numerous occasions between March 2018 and September 2022.  He further explained
that he used medical marijuana a few times a week since 2020. He indicated he intends
to use marijuana in the future. He states medical marijuana helps him with his stress and
anxiety.  He took a break from using marijuana in September 2022, but he may use it in
the future. (Item 3 at 33)
The  investigator  who  interviewed  Applicant  on  October  13,  2022,  prepared  an
unsworn  summary  of  Applicant’s  Personal  Subject  Interview.  On  March  15,  2023,
Applicant certified that the unsworn summary of his October 13, 2022, personal subject
interview was accurate in response to DOHA interrogatories. (Item 4) He indicated:
I swear (or affirm) that I have read the enclosed report of my interview(s)
conducted on October 13, 2022, October 18, 2022, and November 9, 2022,
and I either found the report to be accurate or amended the report so that it
is now accurate.
During his personal subject interview, Applicant confirmed that he used marijuana
recreationally between March 2018 and 2020, and that he used marijuana medically from
July 2020 to September 2022. He also used marijuana in October 2022 on two occasions.
(Item 4 at 6). He purchased marijuana for his personal use approximately once every two
weeks  from  July  2020  to  August  2020  and  July  2021  to  August  2021.  He  obtained  a
medical marijuana card in the state where he resides to help with anxiety and stress. He
was not aware that the use of marijuana remained illegal under federal law. He does not
plan to use marijuana in the future if he is granted a security clearance. (Item 4 at 7)
Applicant volunteered during the interview that he used hallucinogenics on three
occasions. He used mushrooms once in November 2021 and LSD twice – once in March
2019 and once in August 2020. He failed to list the use of hallucinogenics on his  SCA
due to oversight. He used drugs with his friends and sometimes by himself. He has not
attended drug treatment. (Item 4 at 7)
In April 2023, Applicant answered supplemental questions that were listed in the
interrogatories. One of the questions read as follows:
Have  you  used  marijuana  or  any  product  containing  THC  since  your
personal subject interview conducted on October 13, 2022?
He  responded  that  he  used  marijuana  “2/24/23  –  present  2-3  times  a  week.”  A
follow-up  question  asked  him  when  he  last  used  marijuana.  He  listed  2/24/2023.  This
conflicts with the answer to the first question. At the very least, Applicant used marijuana
between  October  13,  2022,  to  February  24,  2023,  on  average  of  two  to  three  times  a
week. 2023. He is aware that his employer has a drug free workplace policy. He believes
it prohibits the use of intoxicating substances at work. He answered that he did not intend
to use marijuana or any illegal drugs in the future. (Item 4 at 13-15)
Question 12 of the April 2023 Interrogatories asked:
Are you willing to provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all
drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future
involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  national  security
eligibility?
Applicant answered: “Not at this time.” (Item 4 at 15)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegation  in  ¶  2.a,  but  in  his  explanation,  he
essentially  denied  the  falsification allegation. He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.b, but essentially admitted the factual aspect except he disputed the timeline that
was  alleged.  He  denied  SOR  ¶  2.b.  His  partial  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2000 and a  master’s
degree  in 2010.  He married  in 2006 and has  two minor children. He  has  worked for a
federal contractor since 2013. He obtained a security clearance in approximately 2011.
(Items 2, 3)
In  March  2011,  Applicant  completed  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions (SF 86). Section 23 asked Applicant if in the last seven years he had used any
illegally controlled substances, such as marijuana. He responded “no.” (Item 6)
In  August 2021, Applicant  completed  another SF 86.  In  response to  Section  23
about any illegal drug use in the last seven years, he responded that from March 2014 to
July 2020 he used “THC.” He stated, “Recreational use. A few times in a year. Maybe 10-
20 times in the last 7 years.” He also admitted that he used marijuana while possessing
a security clearance. He stated that he no longer used it because he did not enjoy the
effect. (Item 2)
In October 2021, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He later
authenticated  and  adopted  the  summary  of  interview  in  his  interrogatories.  He  did  not
make any changes to the summary of interview. During the interview he was questioned
about his past drug usage. He was asked about his drug usage during the past seven
years, and he told the investigator that the only illegal drug he had used in the past was
marijuana. He said he only used it by himself. He said he only used marijuana for the
purpose of reducing joint pain and inflammation. He said because he is a long-distance
runner, the running leads to inflammation and  joint pain and that he used marijuana to
alleviate the pain and inflammation. He estimated that he only used marijuana about 10
to 20 times. He said he had never used any other drugs. He obtained the marijuana from
a former friend. He last used marijuana in July 2020. He has never been diagnosed for
drug abuse or participated in drug counseling or treatment. He said that his use had never
affected his behavior. He does not socialize or associate with individuals who use drug
illegally. He stated he is not likely to ever use or be involved with marijuana or any illegal
drugs in the future. He no longer enjoys marijuana because he had negative side effects
from his last use. (Item 4)
In October 2022, Applicant completed another SF 86. In response to the Section
23 question which asked if in the last seven years had Applicant illegally used any drugs
or controlled  substances, he  responded  “no.” Section  23  also  asked, “Have  you  EVER
illegally  used  or  otherwise  been  illegally  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance
while possessing a security clearance other than previously listed? Applicant responded
“no.” (Item 3)
Applicant was re-interviewed by a government investigator in January 2023. In his
interrogatories, he authenticated his statement to the investigator and did not make any
changes. He was asked if he had been involved with using illegal drugs in the past seven
years. He responded “no.” He was asked when he last used marijuana and he responded
it was more than seven years ago, so he was not required to report it on his SF 86. He
told  the  investigator that  his last  use  was  in  2014.  He  was  asked  if  he  held  a  security
clearance  when  he  used  marijuana  in  2014  and  he  responded  yes.  He  said  he  used
marijuana about three times between 2011 and 2014. He smoked dried flowers in a pipe.
He would use it for joint pain he experienced from being a long-distance runner. He told
the investigator that he did not use marijuana in any other form and  had not used any
other  illegal  substance  or  misused  prescription  medication  while  holding  a  security
clearance. He said he was provided the marijuana but could not recall by whom. (Item 4)
Applicant further told the investigator that he first used marijuana in 1996 while in
college and shortly after college about five times a year until 2011. He would smoke it
with a pipe. He told the investigator that he never used marijuana in any other form such
as oils or edibles. He is no longer in contact with any of  the people he used marijuana
with during this period. (Item 4)
Applicant told the investigator that he had not used marijuana since 2014 and had
no intention to use it in the future. He reiterated that he used it for joint pain. He said he
never used marijuana while working. He explained that he did not disclose his use on his
most recent SF 86 because he believed he only had to report his marijuana use for the
past seven years, not ever. He said his omission was unintentional. (Item 4)
In Applicant’s response to government interrogatories, he was asked the following
question:
Under FEDERAL  Law (understanding  that marijuana  is not legal Federally)
have   you   ever  illegally   USED  any   drug  or  control  substance   any
narcotic,  depressant,  stimulant,   hallucinogen   (to   include   LSD  or  PCP)
and/or any Cannabis (to include  marijuana, CBD and hashish) or misused
any prescription medication?
He  responded   “yes”  and   listed   his  marijuana   use   from   August   1996   to   April  2014.   He
reported   his  frequency   of  use   was  one   to   two   times  a   year.  He  did   not  intend   to   use
marijuana in  the future. He stated,
The  frequency  of  use  specified  above  does  not  apply to  all  years between
the  first and  last  use  dates, and  instead  represent  a  loose  estimate  of an
average   frequency  over  the   specified   time   period.  There  were,  in   fact,   a
number of years that involved zero marijuana  use. (Item 4)
This question specifically requests disclosure of  cannabidiols (CBD). He did not
disclose any CBD use.1
SOR  ¶ 1.a alleged Applicant used marijuana with  varying frequency  from about
1996 to about July 2020. SOR ¶ 1.b alleged he used marijuana with varying frequency
1  The  Security  Executive Agent for the  United  States  Government provided  clarifying  guidance concerning
marijuana on December 21, 2021. Part of that guidance addressed CBD products:
With  respect  to  the   use  of   CBD   products,  agencies   should  be  aware   that  using  these
cannabis   derivatives   may   be   relevant  to  adjudications   in  accordance  with  SEAD  4.
Although  the  passage  of  the Agricultural  Improvement  Act  of  2018  excluded  hemp  from
the   definition   of  marijuana   within  the  Controlled   Substances   Act,  products   containing
greater   than  a  0.3  percent  concentration   of   delta-9  tetrahydrocannabinol   (THC),  a
psychoactive  ingredient  in   marijuana,  do   not  meet the definition  of “hemp.” Accordingly,
products  labeled  as  hemp-derived  that contain  greater  than 0.3 percent  THC  continue  to
meet the  legal  definition of marijuana, and  therefore remain illegal  to use under  federal  law
and policy. Additionally, agencies  should be  aware that the  Federal  Drug Administration
does   not  certify   levels   of  THC  in  CBD  products,  so  the   percentage  of  THC  cannot  be
guaranteed, thus  posing  a  concern pertaining  to  the use of  a  CBD product  under  federal
law. Studies  have shown that some CBD products  exceed the 0.3  percent THC threshold
for hemp, notwithstanding  advertising  labels  (Reference F). Therefore, there  is  a  risk  that
using  these products  may  nonetheless  cause sufficiently  high  levels  of THC to result in a
positive  marijuana  test  under   agency-administered  employment  or  random   drug  testing
programs.  Should an  individual  test  positive,  they  will  be  subject to an  investigation  under
specific guidelines established by their home  agency.
The  Substance Abuse and  Mental  Health Services  Administration  (SAMSHA)  provided a warning
about CBD products on July 24, 2019:
Studies   have   shown  that   some   CBD  products’   labeling  does   not   accurately   reflect  their
content.  Cannabis   based   products   containing   a  THC  level   greater  than   0.3%   on   a  dry
weight basis do not fall under the Farm Bill’s definition  of hemp even if they are labeled as
such.  In   one   study,   the  amount  of  CBD   in   69%   of   the   84   tested   CBD   products   was
inconsistent with  that on  the label, and  some products  contained unlabeled  cannabinoids,
including   THC  in  amounts   up   to  6.4   mg/ml.  As   such,  an   employee’s   drug  test  may   be
positive  for   the  THC   metabolite,   delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic   acid  (THCA),
due to THC in the  CBD product.
SAMSHA further advised that “federal  agencies should make every  effort to inform applicants  and
employees  of the risk that using such products may result in a positive marijuana test.”
from about April 2011, to about July 2020, while granted access to classified information.
(Item 1)
Applicant denied  SOR ¶ 1.a  based  on  the  dates. He  admitted  to  using  marijuana
infrequently between  1996  and  2014. He stated  in his SOR answer that he  did not report
his use  on  his SF 86 because it was outside the seven-year period. He stated,
When  answering  the  e-QIP  questionnaire  in 2021, I collectively referred  to
both  marijuana  usage  in  2014  (which was within the  specified  7  year window
at that time) and  CBD marijuana  usage  for a  recurring  autoimmune  health
issue  that would periodically flare up  during  periods of intense  training  for
marathon   races  and   cause   severe  joint   pain.   This  continued   until
approximately July 2020. At that time,  I discontinued  CBD usage  and  sought
treatment from  a  rheumatoid specialist and  have  submitted  record  of one  of
several appointment. (Item 2)
Applicant further stated in his SOR answer the following:
Further,  I  did  not  include   CBD  marijuana   usage   because   the   general
perception  of,  and  stance  on, CBD marijuana  has been  continually evolving
in recent years.  Given  the  growing  popularity of CBD  usage  for  health  and
wellness, the  determination  of  how  to  distinguish between  it and  other forms
of marijuana  usage  has shifted  and  has made  answering  these  questions
challenging.  In  retrospect,  I  sincerely  regret  omitting  CBD usage  in  my 2022
e-QIP   questionnaire   and   2023   interview.   I  now  recognize  that  this
information   should  have   been   disclosed   in  the   interest   of  transparency.
(Item  2)
In his SOR answer, Applicant provided a timeline of his drug use:
1996-2002: Occasional marijuana usage while attending college and post-
graduation.
2003-2012: No usage of marijuana.
2012-2014:
ups.
2014-2020: Periodic usage of CBD during intense training and rheumatic
flare-ups.
Infrequent  usage  of marijuana  during  periods  of  rheumatic flare-
Applicant stated in his SOR answer to allegation ¶ 1.b the following:
Again,  I  deny this statement  due  to  the  end  date. As  explained  in  [¶] 1.a,  I
admit  to  using  marijuana  very infrequently from  2012  to  2014  while granted
access to  classified  information. This usage  was tied  to  periodic rheumatic
flare-ups that  occurred  during  intense  periods of training  for long-distance
running   races.  These   flare-ups  subsided   for  a   period   of  time   after   2014,
during  which I  ceased  usage  of marijuana. When  the  next flare-up  occurred,
I was able to  obtain  CBD marijuana  and  opted  for that as  I felt it was more
appropriate   therapy  for my  joint  pain  and   didn’t  have   the  unpleasant  and
undesirable aspect of smoke inhalation. By 2020, the CDB medication was
no  longer  effective  and  instead  causes some  dizziness  and  nausea. (Item
2)
SOR ¶ 2.a alleged Applicant falsified his October 2022 SF 86 when he failed to
disclose his marijuana use from 1996 to July 2020 and his use from April 2011 to July
2020, while granted access to classified information. Although he admitted the allegation,
he stated he did not include his CBD usage when responding to his October 2022 SF 86.
He said it was not with the intent to falsify but was an honest change in his understanding
of the classification of CBD. He said it was a judgment call because CDB did not meet
the qualification of a drug or controlled substance. He said his omission was not deliberate
or duplicitous, but instead a result of shifting sentiment towards CBD as a legitimate and
legal  health  and  wellness  treatment.  He  was  aware  that  his  2022  SF  86  would  be
compared to his 2021 SF 86. (Item 1, 2)
Applicant’s explanation in his SOR answer for why he failed to disclose if he had
ever used marijuana while having access to classified information in his October 2022 SF
86 was because the question was different than the one asked on his 2021 SF 86, which
he said only asked about the previous seven years. He said it was an honest oversight
and not an attempt to provide false information. He said he admitted the information when
it was brought to his attention in his 2023 interview. (Item 2)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleged Applicant deliberately falsified material facts during a personal
subject interview conducted in July 2023, when he stated he had not used illegal drugs
or  controlled  substances  in  the  past  seven  years.  Applicant  denied  the  allegation  and
stated  it  was  his  understanding  that  CBD  usage  did  not  qualify  as  an  illegal  drug  or
controlled substance. He said the focus of the interview “was on pure marijuana usage.”
It was only when it was pointed out to him by the investigator that the question asked if
he had “EVER” used marijuana while in possession of a security clearance, to which he
answered he had done so in 2014. Medicinal marijuana has been legal in the state where
Applicant lives since 2013. He did not provide evidence that he had a prescription for it.
(Item 2)
Applicant  provided  a  response  to  the  FORM.  He  disputed  the arguments  in  the
brief provided by Department Counsel.
In his FORM response, Applicant said he “was confused by a few questions that
are  open  to  interpretation,  legal  technicalities  concerning  CBD  and  some  fuzzy
recollections from decades in the past.” He further stated, “An indisputable fact present
in both interpretations is that I used marijuana and CBD a small number of times over a
number  of  years  while  in  possession  of  a  security  clearance.”  Applicant  provided
additional explanations and interpretations to his answer and interview statements.  He
said he should not have used the word “recreational” when describing his marijuana use
but should have said it was therapeutic. He said the interview focused on marijuana usage
such as smoking. He said he always mentioned he used it for joint pain. (AE A)
Applicant  unequivocally  reported  on  his  2021  SF  86  and  during  his  2021
background  interview,  which  was  not  corrected  when  he  responded  to  interrogatories,
that he used marijuana up through July 2020. His later self-serving statements that he
used CBDs, not marijuana, between 2014 and 2021 are not credible. I find that he used
marijuana up through July 2020.
Applicant provided numerous character letters in his SOR answer and response
to  the  FORM.  He  is  described  as  a  person  of  integrity.  He  is  dedicated,  professional,
responsive, dependable, honest, loyal, creative, productive, and reliable. He is tireless in
his work ethic. He is perpetually challenging himself to be a better person. The letters do
not  mention  if  they  are  aware  of  the  specific  allegations  in  the  SOR.  Those  providing
letters recommended that he retain his security clearance. (Item 2, AE B, C, D, E)

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,  and  he  denied  ¶  1.c.  After  a  thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in November 2000, and he
received  a  medical  discharge  in  March  2002.  He  earned  a  professional  certification  in
2013. He was previously married in 2007 and divorced in 2013. He married his current
wife  in  2019.  He  has  one  adult  son.  Since  March  2021,  he  has  been  employed  by  a
federal  contractor  as  a  manufacturing  technician.  He  had  previously  worked  for  this
employer on a temporary basis in 2020. Applicant currently possesses a DOD security
clearance that was issued in December 2020. (Tr. 16, 20; GE 1, GE 2; AE C)
In   Applicant’s   April   2022   SCA,  he   did   not   disclose   any  illegal  drug   use.   SOR   ¶
1.a  alleges  that Applicant used  marijuana with  varying  frequency from  September 1996
to  March 2023.  In  his Answer, Applicant stated  that he  used  marijuana  in high  school,
but he  did not use any marijuana  while he  served  in the  U.S. Navy.  In  2012, he  ruptured
his Achilles  tendon  which required  surgery.  He was prescribed  Lortab  and  Oxycodone
for pain  management.  He did  not  feel comfortable  taking  the prescribed  narcotics,  so  he
chose  marijuana  instead  to  treat his pain  from  2012-2015. In  2016  he  ruptured   his left
Achilles  tendon,  and  although  he  was  not required  to  have  surgery, he  again  chose  to
use  marijuana  to  manage  his pain. After the  pain went away, he  used  marijuana  to  treat
symptoms   of  depression.   In   2018,   his   state   of   residence   legalized   marijuana,   and   he
obtained   a   medical   marijuana   card   to   continue   to   treat  his  depression   and   his   post-
traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD).  (GE 1; Answer)
Applicant  testified that he applied  for a  permanent  position  with  his employer in
January  2021.  He  had  previously  worked  for this  employer  as  a  temporary  employee,
and  he  was  aware  that  he  would  be  required  to  take  a  drug  test  to  be  offered  a
permanent position. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that in February 2021, Applicant tested positive
for marijuana during a drug test given by his employer. An incident report disclosing a
positive  drug  test  was  filed  on  Applicant  in  March  2021.  In  the  SOR  Answer,  he
admitted he had used marijuana during the holidays due to depression and not working.
He had informed the federal contractor that he would test positive during the drug test
due to his medical marijuana use. He was required to show his medical marijuana card,
and he was offered a permanent position in March 2021. (Tr. 18-19; GE 2; Answer)
Applicant  provided  inconsistent  testimony  that  conflicted  with  his  Answer  when
he stated that he was prescribed a medical marijuana card in 2012 after his first Achilles
tendon  surgery.  He  stated  he  used  medical  marijuana  every  other  day  from  2012  to
January  2021.  His  medical  marijuana  card  expired  in  May  2021.  He  continued  to
purchase marijuana to treat his symptoms from another state he had moved to in  2020
that  had  also  legalized  marijuana  use  for  recreational  purposes.  According  to  his
Answer, he could not have obtained a medical marijuana card in 2012 since his state of
residence did not legalize medicinal use of marijuana until 2018. (Tr. 19-27; Answer)
Applicant  also  provided   conflicting   information   when   he   testified   that  he   was
completely   unaware   that   marijuana   use   was   illegal   under   federal   law,   and   therefore
incompatible   with   a   federal   government  contractor  employee   possessing   a   DOD
security  clearance.   He   did not   learn   that  this was  an   issue   until March  2023,  when   he
received  an  interrogatory  from  DOHA.  In  his  interrogatory  response  he  listed  that  he  last
used  marijuana  in March 2023, and  he  intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future. (SOR  ¶
1.c)   The   SOR   was  also  issued   in   March  2023,   and   in   his   Answer,  he   denied   that   he
intended  to  use  marijuana  in the  future.  He  had  no  intentions  of using  marijuana  as  long
as it could have  an  adverse effect on  his employment with  a  federal contractor.  (Tr. 27-
28; GE 3; Answer)
In  August  2022,  Applicant  participated  in  a  background  interview  with  an
authorized  DOD  investigator.  Applicant  was  asked  if  he  had  used  any  illegal  drugs  or
misused prescription drugs within the last seven years, which Applicant denied. He was
then confronted with the March 2021 incident report of his positive drug test. He told the
investigator that he was prescribed medical marijuana in 2012 after surgery to manage
his pain. He ended his medicinal use of marijuana in 2015, but he continued to maintain
his medical marijuana card in case he would need marijuana for pain in an emergency.
He told the investigator that he moved his family to another state in 2020, and he used
marijuana “a few times” due to lifting and carrying heavy items. He last used marijuana
in March 2020, and he had reported this to the federal contractor when he was required
to  undergo  a  drug  test  in  February  2021.  He  was  aware  of  a  co-worker  under
investigation  for  illegal  drug  use,  and  he  had  no  intent  to  use  marijuana  unless  it
became  legal  under  federal  law.  Applicant  read  the  investigative  report,  and  in  his
March  2023  interrogatory,  he  certified  that  the  information  was  accurate.  The
information  he  provided  during  his  August  2022  background  interview  is  inconsistent
with information he provided in his Answer and during his testimony. (GE 3)
Applicant provided two character reference letters from a co-worker and his wife.
They  described  Applicant  as  dedicated  and  responsible.  Although  neither  mentioned
Applicant’s  recent  use  of  marijuana,  they  held  no  reservations  about  Applicant’s
character or loyalty. (AE A and AE B)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.
(HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings
of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a 39-year-old corporate officer for a company, which provides highly
technical engineering products and services to DOD. (Tr. 6, 9-11) In 2002, he graduated
from  high  school.  (Tr.  7)  In  2006,  he  was  awarded  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  business
administration with majors in marketing and management of human resources. (Tr. 7) In
2010,  he  was  awarded  a  master’s  degree  in  business  administration  (MBA).  (Tr.  8)  In
2016, he was awarded a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering technologies, and in
2020, he received an associate degree in applied science. (Tr. 8) He has not served in
the military. (Tr. 9) In 2014, he married, and his children are ages 2 and 5. (Tr. 9)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency
from  about  September  2001  to  about  February  2022.  He  used  marijuana  three  to  five
times a week at the time he completed his March 14, 2022 SCA. (Tr. 32) From 2011 to
2022, he used marijuana about 500 times. (Tr. 27)  He purchases marijuana  in a state
where possession and use are legal. (Tr. 36, 39-40; GE 1) Applicant uses a vape and
edibles to consume marijuana. (Tr. 30, 33) He most recently used marijuana on August
5, 2023, which was five days before his hearing. (Tr. 33) He uses marijuana to help relieve
stress. (Tr. 35) He believes marijuana use should be an “inalienable right” because the
benefits  of  marijuana  use  far  outweigh  the  negatives.  (Tr.  41)  He  acknowledged
marijuana possession was illegal under federal law. (Tr. 42)
Applicant was honest about his marijuana involvement. He did not test positive on
a urinalysis test, and he does not have any drug-related arrests.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges he intends to continue to use marijuana in the future. Applicant
said at his hearing that he intends to continue to consume marijuana. (Tr. 42) He has not
attended any therapy or counseling for abuse of marijuana. (Tr. 48) Even if he receives a
security clearance, he would probably continue to use marijuana. (Tr. 48)
Department  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  SOR  to  allege  that  Applicant  used
marijuana from February 2022 to at least August 5, 2023. (Tr. 34) Applicant did not object,
and I granted the motion. (Tr. 34)
Applicant did not believe his marijuana use was relevant in a determination of his
trustworthiness. (Tr. 19) His marijuana use cannot be used to coerce or bribe him to obtain
classified or sensitive information. (Tr. 19-20, 23)

"Applicant  is  26  years  old.  He  is  not  married  and  has  no  children.  He  has  a
Bachelor’s  degree  in  Aerospace  Engineering  with  an  emphasis  in  Astronautics.  He
holds the position of Systems Engineer.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in
connection with his employment.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.
Applicant graduated from college with his Bachelor’s degree in May 2021.  After
graduating, he obtained a job working with the military.  He applied for and was granted
a security clearance in April 2021.  He continued working for the military from August 2,
2021, to June 20, 2022.  Wanting a new working environment, he applied for and was
hired by a defense contractor in June 2022.  At that time, he applied for a higher level
clearance which was granted in July 2022.  (Tr. p. 31.)
Applicant has a ten-year history of illegal drug involvement, including the use and
purchase  of  MDMA  (ecstasy),  LSD,  and  marijuana  on  various  occasions  from  about
2012  until  at  least  2022.  Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the
SOR.  Applicant  used  marijuana  daily,  almost  every  week  from  2012  until  May  2021.
(Applicant’s Exhibit A.)  He used marijuana after applying for a security clearance, while
possessing  a  security  clearance,  and  while  working  in  a  sensitive  position.  Applicant
testified that from January 2022 to February 2023, he used marijuana four times.  (Tr. p.
29.)
Applicant explained that he started smoking marijuana during his freshman year
in high school because he got mixed up with the wrong crowd of friends.  He explained
that his  best friend  suffers from  Chrons  Disease  and  the  use  of marijuana has  helped
him with his condition.  They have used marijuana together.  Applicant testified that he
last used marijuana in February 2023.  (Tr. p. 21.)  He stated that he has now stopped
using marijuana, but that he still had friends and family that use it.  (Tr. p. 22.)  Applicant
did not report his illegal use of marijuana to his company security office.
Applicant further admitted that he has also used illegal mind-altering substances
such  as  MDMA  (ecstasy)  on  13  separate  occasions,  and  LSD  on  six  separate
occasions,  during  the  period  from  2012  until  at  least  January  2022.  (Tr.  pp.  26-27.)
The last time he used MDMA was on February 12, 2023.  (Tr. 27.)  Applicant explained
that  on  this  occasion  when  he  used  MDMA,  he  was  trying  to  enjoy  himself  with  a
previous girlfriend who suggested that he use it to help him open up to his emotions.  At
the  time,  Applicant  was  working  for  a  defense  contractor,  possessed  a  security
clearance, and held a sensitive position.  Applicant knew that the use of this drug was
illegal,  that  it  was  against  company  security  policies,  and  against  Department  of
Defense security clearance regulations.  (Tr. p. 28.)
Applicant  completed  a  second  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing  dated  April  26,  2021.  Section  23  - Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity,
Illegal Use of Drugs or Controlled Substances, asked, “In the last seven years have you
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances?”  Applicant  answered,  “NO”.
(Government  Exhibit  2.)  This  was  a  false  answer.  Applicant  deliberately  failed  to
disclose his use and purchase of illegal drugs discussed above.
Applicant  completed  an  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigation  Processing
dated  July  5,  2022.  Section  23  - Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity,  Illegal  Use  of
Drugs or Controlled Substances, asked, “In the last seven years have you illegally used
any  drugs or controlled  substances?  And,  while  possessing  a  security  clearance  have
you ever illegally used or otherwise been  involved  with a drug or controlled substance
while  possessing  a  security  clearance  other  than  previously  listed?”  Applicant
answered, “NO,” to both questions.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  Applicant answered both
questions  falsely.  He  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  his  use  and  purchase  of  illegal
drugs discussed above.
Applicant stated that he lied in response to the questions on both of his security
clearance applications concerning his illegal drug involvement because he was worried
about  how  he  would  be  perceived.  He  was  afraid  to  reveal  the  truth.  Drug  use  was
something  that  he  was  not  open  with  anyone  about,  including  his  parents  and  his
grandfather.  He kept his drug use to himself, and he did not tell his family, friends, or
employers about it.  (Tr. p. 31-32.)
Applicant’s  year  end  performance  reviews  from  his  manager  for  2022,  and  his
mid-year review for 2023, reflect that Applicant has been an excellent performer.  He is
considered  to  be  a  key  team  member.  His  leads  can  rely  on  his  work  and  product
deliveries to the higher management.  He has demonstrated high ethics, reliability, and
responsibilities  in  his  leadership  skills  by  taking  ownership  of  his  tasks  immediately.
(Applicant’s Exhibits B and C.)
Letters  of  recommendation  from  team  members  of  the  Applicant  attest  to  his
reliability,  dependability,  and respectful character.  He  is a  hard  worker  with  a  positive
attitude who is always willing to help others despite being busy with his own work.  He
produces  high  quality,  consistent,  and  rule-compliant  work.  He  is  well-liked  and
considered to be an excellent engineer.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)

careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact. (Item 2)
Applicant  is  32   years   old.   He   married   in   2021,   and   has  no   children.  He  has
worked   as  a   business   manager   for  his  current  employer,  a   federal  contractor,   since
December 2021.  That contractor is subject  to  the  drug-free  workplace  provisions of 41

This  is  his  first   time   seeking   a   security  clearance.   He   completed   his  first   security
clearance application (SCA) in October 2022.  (Item  3)
The SOR alleged, under Guideline H, that Applicant:
-used and purchased marijuana, at various times,  from June 2010 to about April 2022
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b);
-used the prescription drug, alprazolam, without a prescription to him,  at various times
from September 2014 to about December 2021 (SOR ¶ 1.c);

2021 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.e);
-used  and  purchased  ecstasy  at  various  times  from  June  2010  to  about  April  2016,
concerning  his  use;  and  from  September  2010  to  about  April  2016,  concerning  his
purchases (SOR ¶¶ 1.f-1.g); and
-used Xanax, Oxycodone, and Hydrocodone, not prescribed for him, from August 2015
to about September 2015 (SOR ¶¶ 1.h-1.j). (Item 1)
The SOR alleged, under Guideline E, that Applicant:
-in  about  September  2015,  left  his  employment  at  a  pharmacy  by  mutual  agreement,
after  having  been  accused  of  stealing  Xanax,  Oxycodone,  and  Hydrocodone,  not
prescribed for him, from the pharmacy (SOR ¶ 2.a); and
-in  about  September 2015,  was  charged  with  petty  theft  of  prescription  drugs  listed  in
SOR ¶ 2.a, above (SOR ¶ 2.b). (Item 1)
Guideline H.
Marijuana   use   and   purchase.  Applicant  admitted  his  marijuana  use  and
purchases  in  his  October  2022  SCA,  his  November  2022  personal  subject  interview
(PSI) with an investigator, and in his July 2023 SOR answer. (Items 2-4)
Applicant stated that he began using marijuana while in college in approximately
2010.  He  lived  in  a  state  where  marijuana  is  legal  under  state  law.  He  had  a  medical
marijuana license from the state to treat insomnia. He also used marijuana because he
enjoyed  it.  He  estimated  that  he  used  marijuana  approximately  1000  times.  He  used
marijuana  by  smoking  it,  vaping  it,  and  ingesting  THC-laced  gummies.  His  most
frequent  use  was  during  his  college  years.  Since  2015  to  2016,  he  claims  to  have
significantly  decreased  his  use  of  marijuana.  He  claims  his  last  use  was  in  April  2022
and he no longer associates with people who use or sell marijuana. He claims his last
purchase  of  marijuana  was  in  October  2021.  He  claims  he  no  longer  associates  with
individuals involved with this drug. He listed his use and purchases on his SCA. (Items

Use   of   Alprazolam   without   a   prescription.  Applicant  admitted  using
Alprazolam  without  a  legal  prescription  on  under  20  occasions  between  September
2014 and December 2021. He claims he primarily used it due to his insomnia and stress
during his final year of college in 2015. He claims he no longer uses this drug because
he has found other ways to deal with his stress and insomnia. He claims he no longer
associates with individuals involved with this drug. He listed his use on his SCA. (Items
2-4)
Cocaine   use.   Applicant  admitted  using  cocaine  approximately  12-17  occasions
between  September  2014  and  March  2021.  He  claims  he  primarily  used  it  during  his
college years. He claims he no longer uses this drug and will not use it in the future. He
claims he no longer associates with individuals involved with this drug. He listed his use
on his SCA. (Items 2-4)
Cocaine   purchase.   Applicant  admitted  purchasing  cocaine  approximately  10
times  between  2014  and  March  2021.  He  claims  his  last  cocaine  purchase  was  in
March 2021, for his bachelor party. He claims he no longer uses this drug. He claims he
no  longer  associates  with  individuals  involved  with  this  drug.  He  listed  his  use  on  his
SCA. (Items 2-4)
Ecstasy   use.  Applicant  admitted  using  ecstasy  approximately  12-15  times
between June 2010 and April 2016. He claims he primarily used it while attending music
festivals.  He  claims  he  no  longer  uses  this  drug  and  will  not  use  it  in  the  future.  He

listed his use on his SCA. (Items 2-4)
Use  of  Xanax  without  a  prescription. Applicant admitted using Xanax between
August  2015  and  September  2015,  without  a  legal  prescription.  He  pointed  out  that
Xanax is the brand name for the drug Alprazolam. This conduct is the same conduct as
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, is duplicitous, and will be found in favor of Applicant. (Items 2-4)
Use   of   Oxycodone   without   a   prescription.  Applicant  admitted  using
Oxycodone between August 2015 and September 2015, without a legal prescription. He

Guideline E.
Applicant  admitted  the  Guideline  E  allegations.  He  admitted  that  he  stole  the
prescription  drugs  of  Xanax,  Oxycodone,  and  Hydrocodone,  while  employed  at  a
pharmacy  in  approximately  September  2015.  He  obtained  the  drugs  for  his  personal
use  without  an  authorized  prescription.  After  his  actions  came  to  light,  he  left  his
employment  by  mutual  agreement  because  of  his  theft  of  the  drugs.  He  listed  these
circumstances on his SCA. (Items 2-4)
In about September 2015, Applicant was charged by local authorities with petty
theft of the drugs described above. His case was disposed of through  a deferred entry
of judgment. He complied with all the conditions imposed by the court and the charges
were then dismissed. The underlying conduct for both SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b is the same
and the pleadings are therefore duplicitous. I find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR ¶
2.b. (Items 2-4)

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - 1.h  and  added  further  comments  in  his
Supplemental SOR response. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  29  years  old.  He  has  never  married,  and  he  has  no  children.  He
graduated from high school in 2012, and he attended college from 2012-2013 and again
from 2015-2019,  when he earned  his bachelor’s  degree.  After college, he founded his
own  company  building  and  maintaining  scientific  equipment.  He  has  never  held  a
clearance. (Item 2)
Applicant disclosed marijuana use and a wide variety of other illegal drug use on
his SCA and discussed it further in his background interview, months later. His drug use
is alleged as a security concern under Guideline H.
Applicant  began   using   marijuana,  or   THC,   in  high   school,  beginning   in   about
June 2010. He began using marijuana daily in college. He  disclosed  on  his August 2022
SCA  that  his   most  recent  marijuana   use   was  in  June   2022,  two   months   before  he
submitted  his SCA.  He used  it recreationally  and  to  relax, either  alone  or at parties. He
also purchased  it  either  from  a  local dealer,  or,  after  college, by driving  to  a  neighboring
state where  it  was legal to  do  so, and  then  returning  to  his home  state  to  use  it.  (SOR ¶
1.a)  (Items 2, 3)  Applicant stated  in  his Supplemental SOR  response  that his  last  use  of
marijuana  was in  June  2020,  not June 2022.  (Item  1) He  said  on  his SCA that  he  quit
using cannabis to pursue a security clearance. (Item 2) He gave no explanation, and no
further information, for the disparity in dates.
Applicant  also  experimented  with  other  drugs  during  college.  This  included
hallucinogens  such  as  LSD,  PCP,  and  psychedelic  mushrooms,  about  once  a  month
between  August  2013  and  April  2019.  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  He  used  cocaine  at  parties,  bars,
and concerts, every few  months between  August 2016 and August 2018. (SOR  ¶ 1.c)
He snorted ketamine on one occasion, between August and October 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.d)
He used and purchased Adderall, a prescription medication that was not prescribed to
him, to assist him in concentrating and studying better, between 2012 and 2019. (SOR
¶¶ 1.e, 1.h) (Items 2, 3)
In  addition  to  his  out-of-state  cannabis  purchases  for his own  use (SOR  ¶  1.a),
Applicant  also  cultivated  psychedelic  mushrooms  between  August  2013  and  October
2016  (SOR  ¶  1.f),  and  he  both  purchased  and  sold  LSD  between  about  August  2016
and August 2018 to support his own drug use. (SOR ¶ 1.g) (Items 2, 3)
In  his  Supplemental  SOR  response,  Applicant  stated  that  he  understood  that
marijuana  is  “federally  illegal,  regardless  of  state  laws.”  He  said  he  understood  that
“drug use is incompatible with holding a security clearance.” He said, “I do not intend to
use illegal drugs in the future.” (Item 1) Applicant did not respond to  the  Government’s
FORM  or  otherwise  offer  any  mitigating  evidence  beyond  what  he  had  previously
stated.

Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  September  2016.  He  was  granted  a
security clearance soon thereafter. He is unmarried and has no children. (TR at page 14

Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
1.a. Applicant admits that he smoked marijuana once in September of 2021. He
was at a Rave party. There, one of his friends overdosed on drugs and died. Applicant
smoked marijuana to help him cope with the death and sleep that night. (TR at page 18
lines 7~13, and at page 19 line 15 to page 23 line 9.) He held a security clearance at
that time. He also used marijuana and ecstasy in the distant past. (GX 3 at page 5.)

2.a.  Applicant answered, “No,”  to Section 23 on his February 2017 SF-86, as to
“Illegal Use of  Drugs or Drug  Activity  . .  . In the  last seven  (7) years,”  as he  “honestly
wasn’t sure if it (past use of marijuana and ecstasy) was before the seven years or not.”

2.b. Applicant answered, “No,”  to Section 23 on his February 2022 SF-86, as to
“Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity . . . In the last seven (7) years.” This was a willful
falsification since he had used it in September 2021.  (TR at page 23 line 10 to page 24

last usage in May of 2022, at a music festival. His use of Ketamine was exclusively at
music  festivals  with  a  group  of  former  friends.  Applicant  has  moved  away  from  those
friends, and no longer associates with them. (TR at page 16 line 18 to page 20 line 14,

1.b  and  1.c. Applicant admits using psychedelic mushrooms about six times from
April  of  2017  until  his  last  usage  in  May  of  2022,  at  a  music  festival.  Except  for  one
occasion,  when  he  mourned  the  loss  of  a  pet  dog,  Applicant’s  use  of  psychedelic
mushrooms was exclusively at music festivals with a group of former friends. Applicant
has moved away from those friends, and no longer associates with them. He purchased
psychedelic mushrooms twice, the last time in 2022, mourning the death of his pet dog.

his January 2023 SOR answer. He also admitted his positive drug test in 2009, which
prevented his enlistment in the Air Force, and his citations for possession of marijuana
in  2018  and  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  in  2010.  During  his  PSI,  he  told  an
investigator  that  when  he  was  using  and  purchasing  marijuana,  he  knew  it  was  illegal
under  federal  law  and  against  his  current  employer’s  policy.  He  also  testified  that  he
knew marijuana use was illegal under federal law. (Tr. 27, GE 1-2; SOR Answer)
Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana  over  the  years  for  recreational
purposes  and  as  pain  management  for  his  back  and  joints.  He  used  marijuana  by
smoking  it  and  consuming  edibles.  He  testified  that  he  still  uses  marijuana  on  a  less
than regular basis. He resides in a state where marijuana is legal under state law. He
testified that his most recent use of marijuana was in August 2023. He estimated that he
used marijuana “less than a dozen times” from January 2023 to August 2023. (I will not
use his admissions concerning his use of marijuana after April 2022, as alleged in the
SOR,  for  disqualification  purposes,  but  I  may  use  this  information  in  assessing
mitigation and in my whole-person analysis) (Tr. 20, 25, 30) He was asked if he planned
on continuing to use marijuana in the future, and he responded as follows:
It's very possible. I mean, if I go with this, if I get approved for this,  I will
definitely not be smoking until it’s legalized federally. (Tr. 27)
Guideline  F.
Federal and State Tax Return Filings.
In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his 2017-2018
federal  income  tax  returns.  He  claimed  he  was  unaware  of  not  filing  his  2016  federal
return  in  a  timely  manner,  and  he  claimed  he  filed  an  extension  for  his  2021  federal
return. He also claimed he filed an extension for his 2021 state income tax return. (SOR
answer)
Applicant  testified  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his  2017  and  2018  federal  tax
returns. In the past, his parents always reminded him to do his taxes, but he no longer
lived  with  them  and  no  one  reminded  him  to  do  so  for  these  years.  He  did  not  think
about his taxes again until he began the security clearance process. He claims that his
federal tax  returns  for 2016,  2017,  2018  and  2021  have  all been  filed.  He  also  claims
that  his  2021  state  tax  return  has  been  filed.  (Tr.  20-21,  23-24)  He  provided  some
copies of tax transcripts that show the following:
TY   2016-Federal-No  transcript  provided.  The  record  was  kept  open  for  two
months, but Applicant did not submit any additional information for this tax year;
TY 2017-Federal-No transcript provided. He claims he received a document from
the IRS stating that it was working on this year’s return, but he did not provide a copy of
the document. The record was kept open for two months, but Applicant did not submit
any additional information for this tax year;
TY  2018-Federal-A transcript indicates that this return was filed in April 2022;
TY   2021-Federal-A  transcript  indicates  that  this  return  was  filed  in  September
2022, within the allowed time frame if an extension was requested;
TY  2021-State-No transcript provided. The record was kept open for two months,
but Applicant did not submit any additional information for this tax year. (Tr. 23, 31, 36;

of  Lead  Artificial  Intelligence  Architect  with  a  defense  contractor.  He  is  seeking  to
obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Guideline E  – Personal Conduct
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.
Applicant has a history of illegal drug use from about June 2012 until June 2019.
He  admitted that he has  used and  purchased  marijuana and products  containing THC
on various occasions over this seven or eight year period.  While in college, during his
undergraduate  studies,  he  used  marijuana  about  once  or  twice  a  month.  After
graduating,  he  began consuming  THC  on  a weekly  basis.  His  weekly  pattern  of  THC
usage continued throughout graduate school and after graduation.  During an internship
in 2018, Applicant was still using marijuana regularly.  (Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
In 2018, Applicant began to seriously consider pursuing a career in the defense
industry.  Realizing that he would have to qualify for a security clearance, he decided to
quit using marijuana.  He also stopped associating with his drug using friends.  In June
2019,  Applicant  ingested  a  THC  gummy  while  visiting  his  brother  in  California.
Applicant  used  the  THC  gummy  with  the  thought  that  he  was  using  it  in  a  state  that
legalized  the  use  of  marijuana  for  recreational  purposes,  and  he  was  not  violating  the
law.  Applicant  specifically  remembers  the  date  of  June  2019,  as  his  last  use  of  any
illegal  drug  because  at  this  time  of  use  he  was  spending  time  with  his  brother  in
California.  Applicant  submitted  a  photograph  of  he  and  his  brother  on  this  occasion.
(Applicant’s Exhibit G.)
Applicant began working for defense contractor A in June 2019.  He applied for
and obtained his first security clearance about the same time.  Applicant contends that
since being hired by defense contractor A, and being granted a security clearance, he
has  completely  abstained  from  all  illegal  drug  use  and  has  no  intentions  of  ever
returning to it.  (Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
Applicant  also  admitted  that  he  used  cocaine  on  two  separate  occasions
between 2016 and 2018.  He states that he used cocaine once in the spring of 2016,
with  some  upperclassmen  at  his  university.  He  also  used  it  once  at  the  beginning  of
2018,  while  at  a  New  Year’s  Eve  party.  He  stated  that  he  has  no  intentions  of  ever
using cocaine again.  (Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  dated  July  31,  2019.
(Government Exhibit 2.)  In response to questions in Section 23, concerning Illegal Use
of Drugs or Drug Activity, Illegal Use of Drugs or Controlled Substances, he was asked,
“In  the  last  seven  years  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances?”
Applicant  answered,  “Yes”,  but  failed  to  disclose  the  information  set  forth  above,
specifically his full use of marijuana as well as his cocaine use.  Applicant subsequently
underwent a polygraph examination and divulged all of his prior drug use.  (Applicant’s
Answer to SOR.)
On March 24, 2021, Applicant completed another security clearance application.
(Government Exhibit 1.)  In response to the same questions in his previous application
in Section 23, concerning Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, Illegal Use of Drugs or
Controlled Substances, he was again asked, “In the last seven years, have you illegally
used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances?”  Applicant  answered,  “Yes,”  but  failed  to
disclose the information set forth above, specifically his full use of marijuana as well as
his  cocaine  use.  Again,  he  failed  to  disclose  his  full  use  of  marijuana  as  well  as  his
cocaine use.
Applicant denied that he deliberately attempted to conceal his illegal drug use on
his security clearance applications.  He stated that he was attempting to update his e-
QIP with the information he provided during a polygraph examination when he put down
the wrong date that he last used an illegal drug.  He stated that he made an error and
accidentally  listed that July 2020,  was his last  use of  an illegal drug  when  in actuality,
his last use of any illegal drug was in June 2019.  He stated that he now realizes that his
rush through the e-QIP was not wise, as he did not check or double check his answers
before submitting them.  (Applicant’s Answer to SOR)
Applicant  also  stated  that  in  2021,  when  he  completed  his  second  security
clearance application  for a  clearance upgrade,  he  thought  the  investigators would  use
the  previous  information  from  his  2019  security  clearance  investigation  to  supplement
the  current  investigation.  He  later  found  his  assumption  to  be  wrong.  Applicant  now
realizes  that  each  time  he  completes  the  application or  is interviewed  for any  purpose
during his security clearance investigation, he must give full and complete answers, and
not just a “Yes”  or “No”  answer, if the question requires more.  He now knows that he
should have disclosed all relevant information in response to all questions on his e-QIP
and be as detailed as possible.  Applicant contends that he did not deliberately attempt
to hide any material information from the Government in response to questions on either
of his security clearance applications.  (Applicant’s Answer to SOR)
Applicant  has  submitted  a  signed  Statement  of  Intent  to  abstain  from  all  illegal
drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse.

In  January  2023,  Applicant  was  hired  by  his  current  employer  as  a  Lead  Data
Scientist.  Since then, based upon his strong work ethic and excellent performance, he
has been promoted twice.  His most recent performance evaluation from his supervisor
dated  August  22,  2023,  reflects  that  Applicant  has  exceeded  all  expectation  of  his
position.  He  is  effective,  providing  technical  expertise,  and  helping  the  team  stay  on
track to meet critical milestones.  Overall he has made a significant impact in his short
time at the firm.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)
Applicant’s  Manager  nominated  Applicant  for  the  “Black  Engineer  of  the  Year
Award” representing the entire company.  (Applicant’s Exhibit E.)
Applicant’s  wife,  a  medical  student,  testified  that  she  has  been  married  to  the
Applicant since June 8, 2023.  She and her husband do not use illegal drugs of any sort
and  never  have.  Furthermore,  they  do  not  associate  with  anyone  who  uses  illegal
drugs.  She describes her husband as very ambitious, passionate about his career, and
sobriety  is  naturally  a  part  of  their  lifestyle.  She  stated  that  he  is  remorseful  for  not
being  as  thorough  as  he  could  have  been  when  he  filled  out  the  security  clearance
applications.  (Tr. pp. 29-32.)
Applicant’s  brother  testified  that  he  gave  the Applicant  the  THC  gummy  that  he
ingested in June 2019.  Applicant was visiting his brother in the state at the time.  This
was  the  same  month  he  either  started  or  was  interviewed  for  the  job  with  defense
contractor A.  (Tr. pp. 40, and 44-46.)
Letters  of  recommendation  from  professional  associates,  including  former
supervisors,  and  from  family  members,  including  his  brother,  mother,  and  wife,
collectively  attest  to  Applicant’s  overall  outstanding  character.  He  is  known  for  his
trustworthiness,  integrity,  honesty,  transparency,  and  supportive  nature.  He  is  also
described as being responsible, loyal, and helpful.  He is said to be a natural leader with
excellent technical skills, who is ambitious, well liked, and respected by those who know

Evidentiary Ruling on Personal Subject Interview
Applicant  objected  to  Government  Exhibit  6,  which  is  the  Applicant’s  personal
subject  interview  based  upon  the  fact  that  the  report  has  not  been  authenticated  by  a
Government  witness,  and  therefore  cannot  be  considered.  He  asserts  that  the

misinformation.  Based  upon  Applicant’s  objection  which  was  sustained,  Government
Exhibit 6 is not admissible, and was not considered in this determination.

Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant admits the allegations with explanations set forth in the SOR under this
guideline.  He admits that he has used hallucinogenic mushrooms in March 2020, while
granted  access  to  classified  information  or while  holding  a  sensitive  position.  He also
admitted that  from  July  2015  to  May  2017, he  used marijuana  with  varying  frequency.
(Applicant’s Answer to SOR)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  when  he  used  hallucinogenic
mushrooms  in  March  2020,  it  was  a  one-time  impulsive  occurrence  where  the
substance  was  offered  to  him  by  his  friends.  He  stated  that  he  “let  his  guard  down”
through a combination of rationalizations, namely a desire to share an experience with
his friends, and a genuine curiosity.  He further stated that after he experienced it and
reflected on his actions, he realized that he had been short-sighted and immature.  He
stated that he has no intentions to ever use it again.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
At the time he used the hallucinogenic mushrooms in March 2020, Applicant was
employed  with  a  defense  contractor  and  possessed  a  security  clearance  and  held  a
sensitive position. He rationalized his use of the illegal drug with the fact that he had not
been  given a  need  to know or any other direct  access to  classified  information  at  that
point.  He also told himself that it was not as much of a liability as it could have been if
he had information that could be disclosed in a compromised state.  He realizes that he
must own up to the mistake, be truthful if asked about it, and reinforce that he will never
put himself in the position again.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant  also  stated  that  while  in college  he  used  marijuana  from  July 2015  to
May 2017.  In 2015, the first time he used it, he was 19-years-old.  From then to about
2017,  he  used  marijuana  occasionally.  On  these  occasions,  he  received  marijuana
from his friend or roommate, and normally during academic breaks.  He stated that he
never had the urge to use it more frequently.  In August 2018, Applicant first applied for
a security clearance.  He was granted a Secret security clearance in November  2018.
He  stated  that  by  the  time  he  applied  for  his  internship  in  June  2018,  with  a  defense
contractor,  he  had  not  used  marijuana  for  about  a  year,  so  he  comfortably  tested
marijuana  free.  He  stated  that  he  has  not  used  marijuana  since  2017,  and  has  no
interest in ever using it again.  (Government Exhibit 3.)

"Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has

college  courses  without  earning  a  degree.  He  has  never  been  married  and  has  no
children. He served on active duty with the Army from June 2014 until April 2018, when
he earned an honorable discharge. (Items 2-5)
From  about  October  2006  through  September  2022,  Applicant  used  marijuana
with varying frequency. At all times relevant to this investigation, marijuana possession
(and therefore its use) has been illegal. Despite being required to do so, Applicant failed
to  disclose  this  illegal  drug  use  on  his  February  2022  Electronic  Questionnaires  for
Investigations Processing  (2022 e-QIP) or his  April  2020 Electronic  Questionnaires  for
Investigations  Processing  (2020  e-QIP).  He  possessed  a  security  clearance  at  certain
times  while  he  was  using  marijuana  but,  despite  being  required  to  do  so,  he  failed  to
also  disclose  on  his  2022  e-QIP  and  2020  e-QIP  that  his  use  of  marijuana  occurred
while holding a clearance.
After  Applicant  denied  marijuana  use  within seven  years of  submitting  his 2020
e-QIP,  the  DOD  authorized  investigator  who  conducted  his  August  2020  security
interview confronted him with information that he used marijuana with varying frequency
within  that  time  frame.  After  being  confronted,  he  lied  and  said  that  he  only  used
marijuana with varying frequency between 2011 and 2013. When the investigator asked
him about illegal drug use  while holding a security clearance, he also lied and told the
investigator  that he only used  “CBD  oil”  that did  not contain marijuana. He untruthfully
claimed that he did not list his illegal drug use on his 2020 e-QIP because it was longer
ago than seven years. (Items 2-5)
After failing  to  disclose  his illegal drug  use, to  include  his illegal drug  use  while
holding  a  clearance,  on  his  2022  e-QIP,  Applicant  had  another  interview  with  a  DOD
authorized  investigator  in  September  2022.  This  time,  when  the  investigator  asked
about  his  drug  use,  he  admitted  his  2006  through  2022  marijuana  use,  including  use
while he held a security clearance. When the investigator asked why he did not disclose
this information on his 2022 e-QIP, he admitted he intentionally omitted the information
because of a sense of fear. (Items 2-5)
Applicant  also  told  the  investigator  in  2022  the  truth  about  his  marijuana  usage
because  he  had  received  a  letter  in  February  2022,  asking  him  to  address
inconsistencies in his drug use reporting between his 2020 investigation and his 2022 e-
QIP.  He  therefore  did  not  voluntarily  divulge  his  illegal  drug  use  before  being
confronted.  He  also  continued  to  use  marijuana  after  receiving  this  letter.  He  claimed
that  he  told  his  supervisor  about  his  illegal  drug  use  and  intentional  falsifications.  He
also admitted to the investigator during his 2022 background interview that he made up
the story he told during his 2020 background interview, about using CBD oil, to cover for
his actual marijuana use. He clarified that he did not use marijuana while he was in the
military from 2014 to 2018, but he used it before and after those years. He claimed he
has  no  intention  of  using  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  volunteered  to  undergo  drug
testing, but there is no evidence that he has been tested. There is also no evidence that
he  has  undergone  any  drug  treatment.  He  acknowledged  using  marijuana  with  his
girlfriend and other friends and provided no evidence that he no longer associates with
these individuals, or that they no longer use marijuana. (Items 2-5)
In  August  2019,  after  a  night  out  drinking  alcohol,  Applicant  was  arrested  on
suspicion  of  misdemeanor  DUI.  He  failed  a field  sobriety  test  and,  after being  given  a
breathalyzer  test,  his  blood  alcohol  percentage  was  between  .14  and  .16  percent.  He
pleaded guilty to this DUI charge and the court suspended his driver’s license for up to
one year, required him to undergo impaired driver care management, install an ignition
interlock  device  in  his  car,  and  pay  fines  and  court  costs.  He  complied  with  his
sentencing requirements. He divulged this arrest and conviction on his 2020 e-QIP and
during the 2020 interview with a DOD authorized investigator. During that interview, he
claimed he would never drink and drive again. (Items 2-6)
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR, which were related
to  his  marijuana  use,  his  failure  to  divulge  his  marijuana  use  in  his  2020  and  2022  e-
QIPs, his lying to the DOD authorized investigator in 2020 about his marijuana use, and

wife for nine or ten years. He has one child with his wife. He has received a bachelor of
science degree. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his work
with the DoD. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Government Exhibit 1
at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance  because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  five  allegations
under this paragraph with explanations.
1.a.   Applicant  started  using  marijuana  in  approximately  January  2003.  From
2003  through  2010  his  use  was  daily.  From  approximately  2010  to  April  2019  his  use
was  weekly.  From  April  to  November  2019  Applicant’s  use  was  daily.  As  stated,
Applicant began working for his present employer in November 2019. From November
2019 through 2021 his use was weekly. His use was sporadic after that.  (Government
Exhibit 2 at 14.)
Applicant has given various dates for his last use of marijuana. In his March 17,
2022 e-QIP, Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23, he stated his last use was in January
2022. During a May 23, 2022 interview with a government investigator Applicant stated
that he  had  last used marijuana  earlier  in  May  2022.  (Government Exhibit  2 at  14.)  In
his responses to DOHA interrogatories he stated his marijuana use had ended in March
2022. (Government Exhibit 2 at 20.) His testimony was very vague about the extent of
his marijuana use. He was very unsure about when it ended, stating it was possibly late
2021 or early 2022. (Tr. 25-28, 36-39.)
Applicant’s  basic  explanation  for  continuing  to  use  marijuana  after  being
employed by a defense contractor was that he did not know that he could not use it. He
also  testified  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  (Government
Exhibit 2 at 14-15; Tr. 27-28, 36.)
1.b.  The  evidence  shows  that  Applicant  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  from
approximately  2005  through  January  2021.  He  has  made  several  contradictory
statements about his mushroom use. In his Answer he stated, “This [end] date [January
2021] was approximated. More likely it had not been during employment.” In his March
17,  2022  e-QIP,  Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  23,  he  stated  his  last  use  was  in
January 2021 and that he had used it 2 to 3 times a year before that. During a May 23,
2022  interview  with  a  government  investigator  Applicant  stated  that  he  had  last  used
mushrooms in January 2021. (Government Exhibit 2 at 14.) In his responses to DOHA
interrogatories  he  stated  that  his  mushroom  use  was  from  2006  to  January  2021.
(Government  Exhibit  2  at  20.)  His  testimony  was  very  vague  about  the  extent  of  his
mushroom  use.  He  was  very  unsure  about  when  it  ended,  stating  it  was  possibly  late
2019, but could also be 2021. (Tr. 28-31.)
1.c.  Applicant  admitted  using  cocaine  one  time  in  approximately  August  2019.
This  was  before  he  started  his  current  employment.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section
23, Exhibit 2 at 11-12, 20; Tr. 31-33.)
1.d. Applicant admitted using LSD one time in approximately August 2019. This
was  before  he  started  his  current  employment.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  23,
Exhibit 2 at 11-12, 20; Tr. 31-33.)
1.e. Applicant admitted that he had been charged with Possession of Cannabis in
approximately July 2009. The case  resulted in his paying a fine  and  serving probation
for  a  period  of  time.  He  continued  to  use  marijuana  for  more  than  ten  years  after  this
arrest. (Government Exhibit 2 at 9-10; Tr. 33-35.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
judgment,
that  shows  poor
in  conduct
clearance  because  he  has  engaged
untrustworthiness or unreliability.
2.a. The  Government alleges in  this subparagraph  that the  Applicant’s drug  use
history,  as  set  forth  under  Paragraph  1,  above,  is  also  cognizable  under  Guideline  E.
Applicant did not admit or deny this allegation. His silence is viewed as a denial.
2.b.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation,  which  concerns  his  wife’s  immigration
status, with an explanation.
Applicant’s  wife  is from  the  Philippines, but has  lived  in the  United States since
approximately  2001-2002.  They  were  married  in  2008,  and  informally  separated  in
2013. She lives in a different state from him. He is unsure of her immigration status, but
does  not  believe  she  is  a  citizen  of  the  United  States.  The  couple  have  no  plans  to
divorce. (Government Exhibit 2 at 22-23.)
The SOR states that Applicant has remained married to his spouse to assist her
in  qualifying  for  U.S.  citizenship  through  the  naturalization  process.  In  his  Answer  he
stated,  “We  remain  married.  No  reason  not  to  be.  Not  for  sole  purpose  of  citizenship.
Also  co-parenting  child  and  family ties.  No rule  says I have to divorce  someone I  was
with 10 years.”
Applicant  testified  that  he  does  not  know  his  wife’s  current  immigration  status.
The  most  he  would  say  is  that  she  might  “technically  be  considered  in  the  country
illegally.”  Once  again,  his  testimony  was  very  vague  as  to  his  wife’s  citizenship  status
and despite questioning by Department Counsel and myself did not clarify it. (Tr. 15-25.)
It is noted that neither side presented any direct evidence as to Applicant’s wife’s
current  immigration  status.  In  addition,  no  evidence  was  presented  by  either  side
indicating  why  Applicant  and  his  wife  remaining  married  during  the  pendency  of  any
naturalization issue would be legally significant.

"The  SOR  alleges  under  paragraph  1.a  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  at
different  frequencies  from  2002  to  the  present;  that  he  used  marijuana  with  a  security
clearance  since  September  2019;  that  he  tested  positive  for  marijuana  metabolites  in
2005 and 2008; and, that he was arrested in 2010 having marijuana in his possession,
and in 2012 by  violating the terms of his 2010 probation because he had marijuana in
his possession.
The  second  paragraph  of  the  SOR  alleges  personal  conduct  by  incorporating
the  information  alleged  under  SOR  ¶  1.  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  committed
sexual acts on a minor in 2005, and made a false statement, in violation of four Articles
of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ).  He  also  falsified  information  in  three
locations on his September 2019 e-QIP. The Applicant admitted all allegations listed in
the SOR, without explanations.
Applicant is 39 years old and has been divorced since February 2015. He has a
son from his former wife. His current girlfriend gave birth to a two-year-old daughter in
2021.  He  received  a  security  clearance  in  2019  when  he  began  working  for  his  then
employer.  From  June  2002  to  November  2002,  he  served  in  the  United  States  (U.S.)
Army on active duty. From November 2002 to September 2004, he served in the Army
Reserve,  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  returned  to  active  duty  in  the  U.S
Army from September 2004 to December 2009, when he received a general discharge
under  honorable  conditions  for  drug-related  conduct  and  positive  drug  tests.  He  has
been  living  in  Country  B  since  2014.  Applicant  seeks  security  clearance  eligibility.  In
August  2018,  he  began  working  as  a  senior  logistic  specialist,  and  was  recently
promoted to a senior analyst of stock control. (GE 1 at 9-28; GE 2 at 7; Tr. 7-8, 35, 38-
39, 40)
SOR ¶ 1.a –  Applicant testified that he has been using marijuana from 2002 to
the present. Since 2012 or 2013, he has been using marijuana to relax his urethra when
he urinates. In 2022, he began obtaining the marijuana by prescription because Country
B legalized marijuana use. Before the drug was legalized, he obtained the drug illegally
from  family  and  friends.  In  his  March  2021  PSI,  he  indicated  he  was  paying  between
$250 and $300 a month or every other month for the drug. He noted that the purchase
and  use  of  marijuana  was  legal  in  Country  B.  Applicant’s  last  drug  treatment  or
counseling  was  in  2022,  when  a  doctor,  featuring  alternative  treatment  methods,
provided him with a prescription for marijuana. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 20, 23, 43, 45, 47)
Applicant’s  girlfriend  uses  marijuana  occasionally.  His  longest  period  of
abstinence  was  in  2007  for  four  and  one-half  months  while  in  the  U.S.  Army.  He  has
never violated the laws of Country B. (Tr. 56-58)
SOR ¶ 1.b –  Applicant used marijuana after he was granted an interim security
clearance on September 26, 2019,  which was  removed  when he  received the SOR  in
April 2022. From 2015 through 2018, Applicant believed he had a public trust position.
(GE 8 at 1; 34-37)
In  his  March  2021  PSI,  Applicant  stated  that  he  intended  to  stop  using
marijuana  before  his  daughter  was  born  in  June  2021.  He  did  not  want  his  marijuana
use to impair his chances of promotion. (GE 2 at 8) He changed his mind because of his
ongoing  urethra  problem  causing  difficulty  urinating.  He  uses  marijuana  weekly  or
whenever he  needs the  drug.  He does not drive  a  car within  three hours of marijuana
use. He testified that he has not driven to work for two or three years since he has been
in  treatment  for  post  traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  from  nerve  damage  in  his
scrotum since surgery in 2006. (Tr. 43-47)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  –  Applicant  tested  positive  for  marijuana  metabolites  on  a  U.S.
Army  urinalysis,  conducted  on  March  16,  2005.  Following  a  field  grade  Article  15,  he
was  found  guilty  by  his  command  of  wrongful  possession  and  use  of  a  controlled
substance in violation of the UCMJ, reduced in rank, assigned to 45 extra days of duty,
and 45 days restriction.
Applicant believed that the 2005 positive drug test, and subsequent Article 15,
were caused by fellow service member rolling hash-laced cigars that Applicant smoked
daily  for  three  or  four  months.  He  was  not  used  to  the  hash  smell,  but  he  determined
that  the  smoke  produced  was  not  ordinary  cigar  smoke.  He  recalled  relaxing  after  he
smoked the hash. (GE 2 at 6-7; Tr.22)
On April 6, 2005, Applicant tested positive for marijuana metabolites. (GE 4 at
2;  Tr.  48)  This  urinalysis  is  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  and  cannot  be  used  for
disqualification purposes, but will be evaluated in the whole-person review of this case.
(Tr. 22)
SOR  ¶  1.d  –   On  August  27,  2008,  Applicant  tested  positive  for  marijuana
metabolites.  After  field  grade  Article  15,  he  was  found  guilty.  The  conditions  of  his
Article 15 punishment were the same as those identified in SOR ¶ 1.c. He believed the
positive drug test was caused by the hemp tea he was using to relax his urethra, but he
provided  no  evidence  to  support  his  claim.  He  received  a  general  discharge  from  the
U.S. Army in December 2009 for his drug use. He subsequently received an upgraded
honorable discharge. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 52-54)
SOR 1.e –  Applicant was arrested with possession of marijuana in September
2010.  The  police  came  to  his  residence  and  smelled  marijuana.  He  was  found  guilty,
fined, and placed on a period of at least two years of probation. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 54)
SOR  ¶  1.f  –  In  March  2012,  Applicant  was  driving  with  his  brother  to  another
location to celebrate the return of a friend from overseas when he was stopped by the
police for a traffic infraction. The police found marijuana in the car. Applicant’s claim that
he  was  not  driving  is  refuted  by  documentation  that  indicates  he  was  driving  on  a
suspended or revoked license. (GE 3 at 8) He was charged with violating his probation
imposed  in the  SOR  ¶ 1.e sentence.  For the probation  violation, he  was  sentenced  to
two  weeks  in  jail,  a fine  of  $1,776, and  an unidentified  number of hours  of  community
service. (GE 2 at 7)
SOR  ¶  2.b  –   in  December  2005,  Applicant  was  driving  three  other  service
members to a pool party. The same four individuals left the party with a 16-year-victim
that Applicant assumed was 18 or older. One of the occupants in the car agreed to take
the victim home if she performed fellatio on all four occupants. (Tr. 27) After the sexual
activity, they dropped her off at a gas station that had cameras in various locations. The
U.S.  Army  Criminal  Investigative  Division  (CID)  reviewed  the  videos,  and  a  month  or
two later, summoned Applicant to the CID station. Applicant was interrogated about the
incident,  and  he  initially  lied  to  protect  the  other  three  service  members  from  military
punishment  under  Article  15.  During  a  second  interrogation,  Applicant  divulged  the
complete account of sexual activity.
Applicant  was  charged  with  Forced  Sodomy,  Indecent  Acts  Upon  a  Child,  a
False  Statement, and Conspiracy,  in  violation  of  Articles  125,  134,  107,  and  81  of  the
UCMJ. Following a summary court-martial, he was found guilty of the offenses, ordered
to forfeit $1,128, and assigned to 45 days extra duty.
SOR  ¶¶  2.c  and  2.d  refer  to  Applicant’s  falsifications  of  material  facts  on  his
September 2019 e-QIP. First, in response to Section 22 (SOR ¶ 2.c), he answered that
he had never been involved in an offense involving alcohol or drugs, deliberately failing
to disclose the information set forth in SOR ¶1.e. Second, in response to Section 23 (¶
2.d),  Applicant  answered  that  he  had  not  illegally  used  drugs  in  the  past  seven  years,
deliberately failing to disclose the information set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a. He told the OPM
investigator  in  March  2021,  that  he  had  no  explanation  for  not  disclosing  the
information. (GE 2 at 7)
",False
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through
1.d,  and  1.f,  and  he  denied  the  remaining  SOR  allegations.  (HE  3)  He  admitted  the
allegations in the Amended SOR. He also provided mitigating information. His admissions
are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  maintenance  technician  who  has  worked  for  federal
contractors since 2009. (Tr. 25, 68-70; GE 1) In 1991, he graduated from high school.
(Id.)  In  2005,  he  completed  an  apprenticeship.  (Id.)  From  2017  to  2020,  he  was  self-
employed in addition to his employment by a contractor. (Id.) He has not served in the
military. (Id.) His resume and biography provide additional details about his background
and professional experience. (AE J; AE N)
For  many  years,  Applicant  was  an  elite  athlete  who  competed  in  international
competitions on behalf of the United States. (Tr. 18; AE L) As part of his sports career,
he  met  the  President and  First  Lady  at  the  White  House.  (AE  L; AE  M)  He  ended  his
competition in the sport three years ago. (Tr. 19)
In 2002, Applicant married, and in 2015, he was divorced. (Tr. 19; GE 1) One of
his children was born in 2002, and the other five children were born in 2006 (quintuplets).
(Tr. 20-21; GE 1; AE F; AE O) He has held a security clearance since 2009. (Tr. 71) He
has had access to a military base; however, he never had access to classified information.
(Tr. 26, 44, 71-72)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Criminal Conduct
Applicant said he  does  not currently use  illegal drugs. (Tr. 34, 42; AE  B; AE  M; AE
Q) He said he  ended  his use  of illegal drugs  when  he  was arrested  for driving  under the
influence of alcohol (DUI) in 2019. (Tr. 35)  He first used  marijuana  around 1994 or 1995.
(Tr. 75) In  March 1997, he  was  arrested  for  possession  of drug  paraphernalia.  (Tr. 73;
GE   2)   His  first  driving   under  the   influence   of  alcohol  arrest  was   in   1998.   (Tr.  75)  His
driver’s license  was suspended  for two  years. (Tr. 76) In  2000, he  received  a  ticket for
driving  with  a  suspended  driver’s license. (Tr. 76) In  2002, he  was arrested  for DUI,  and
he  pleaded  guilty to  negligent driving. (Tr. 77; GE  2) He said he  only used  marijuana  once
before 2005. (Tr. 74) Multiple  complaints and  allegations were  made  against  Applicant
from   2008   to   2016   from   a  neighbor,  church  members,   and   family  members   about  his
treatment of his former wife, children, or both;  however, none  of  the  complaints resulted
in  convictions.  (Tr.  78-85)  He  said   he   could  not  remember  half   of  his  arrests  and   “the
years all  run  together.”  (Tr. 77)  As  to  those  making  complaints  about  him,  he  said  “They’re
cop callers. They call them all the time  for nothing.” (Tr. 85)
Applicant had difficulty remembering dates of events and periods of sobriety. He
said,  “I have  no  recollection  of what year was what.  The  years, they’re  written  down.  I
could look at it and read them and know them. But that’s how I’d have to do it. If I’m just
picking it out of the air, out of the sky and trying to remember, I have no . . . recollection.”
(Tr. 98-99) The years were  “just a blur” to him. (Tr. 104) He said the SCAs are a good
source for dates of events. (Tr. 103)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used marijuana with  varying  frequency  from about
April 2005 to about May 2020. He occasionally used marijuana during these timeframes.
(Tr. 28) When he was in international sports competitions, he refrained from marijuana
use for extended periods of times, sometimes for five to seven years. (Tr. 29) He said his
actual marijuana usage  was “very minimal.” (SOR response)  A June 1, 2017 Chemical
Dependency Assessment Summary (CDAS) states Applicant “reports smoking marijuana
for the first time at age 18. Recent use is described as a few puffs three times a week.
His last reported use was February 2017.” (GE 13 at 1)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant used methamphetamine with varying frequency from
about April 2005 to about May 2020.  After his divorce in 2015, he was involved with a
woman  who  introduced  him  to  methamphetamine.  (Tr.  32-33,  106)  He  said  he  used
methamphetamine about two or three times. (Tr. 33, 107) He said the last time he used
methamphetamine was around the 2019 DUI arrest when methamphetamine were found
in  his  pocket.  (Tr.  107)  He  does  not  associate  with  the  woman  who  gave  him
methamphetamine. (Tr. 107)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  Applicant  used  cocaine  with  varying  frequency  from  about
December 1993 to about December 1996. He admitted the alleged cocaine usage, and
said he  was not using cocaine  “with  any frequency.” (SOR response) He has not used
cocaine after 1996. (Tr. 42) A June 1, 2017 CDAS states Applicant “reports occasional
snorting cocaine in his 30’s.” (GE 13 at 1)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant was arrested in about September 2020 and charged
with DUI. SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant tested positive on a urinalysis test in about May
2020 for marijuana, methamphetamine, and amphetamine. Department Counsel moved
to withdraw SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e because  more accurate  information was contained in
Amended SOR ¶ 2.b. (Tr. 112) Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion. (Tr.
112)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  Applicant  used  amphetamine,  methamphetamine,  and
marijuana from about January 2018 to about May 2019 while granted access to classified
information.  He  admitted  the  SOR  allegation,  and  he  said,  “I’m  not  an  everyday  every
month  user.  I  was  hanging  around  the  wrong  person  and  made  bad  choices  on  two
occasions. (SOR response)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  Applicant  received  alcohol  and  drug  counseling  from  about
September 2020, and he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder in early remission and
cannabis  use  disorder  in  early  remission.  (Tr.  38;  GE  11  at  7)  He  received  inpatient
treatment for five or six weeks. (Tr. 30)
Applicant provided urine samples on September 15, 2020, and August 25, 2023,
which  tested  negative  for  the  use  of  illegal  drugs;  however,  he  may  have  received
advance  notice  of  the  tests.  There  was  no  evidence  presented  about  the  detection
windows  for  use  of  marijuana  and  methamphetamine  related  to  these  two  drug  tests.
(SOR response; AE M)
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant engaged in criminal conduct as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.f. He is not currently attending drug or alcohol counseling or therapy. (Tr. 105)
Amended SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that on or about May 20, 2019, Applicant was arrested
and charged with DUI. “The blood test taken incident to [his] arrest revealed the presence
of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), methamphetamine, and amphetamine[s]. [He] pled guilty
to a lesser offense and was placed on probation for two years.” (Amended SOR ¶ 2.b)
The police report for the May 20, 2019 arrest states that the police officer noticed
the smell of marijuana emanating from Applicant’s vehicle; Applicant was not alone in the
vehicle; he asked Applicant when he last smoke marijuana; and Applicant told the police
officer that he “ha[d] a few hits from a joint” about five hours earlier. (GE 8 at 2) Applicant
said  he  had  marijuana  inside  the  vehicle.  (Id.)  The  police  officer  asked  Applicant  how
often he smoked marijuana, and Applicant initially said he smoked weekly, and then he
clarified,  “he  smoked  nightly  before  bed.”  (Id.)  The  police  report  does  not  indicate
marijuana was found in his vehicle. (GE 8)
A September 2, 2020 progress note from his drug and alcohol treatment, states
that Applicant said he “smokes nightly” and “started out smoking weed on weekends then
smokes before bedtime.” (GE 11 at 2, 4) He also indicated he stopped using marijuana.
(GE 11) The treatment summary states:
[Applicant]  reports  smoking  marijuana  for  the  first  time  at  age  18,  and
became  a  regular  user  at  age  20  when  he  would  use  cannabis  on
weekends. He reports his cannabis use to have decreased in the past  10
years. His last reported use was in May 2019 when he would occasionally
use cannabis at nighttime for relaxing. (GE 11 at 6)
Applicant  agreed
the  May  20,  2019  blood
test  results  reflected  THC,
methamphetamine, and amphetamines. (Tr. 38) He tried some drugs shortly before the
arrest. (Tr. 40) He was unsure of the disposition of the charges or allegations. (Tr. 40)
After the successful completion of probation and an eight-hour defensive driving course,
the DUI charge was reduced to negligent driving. (SOR response; AE C; AE D)
Amended SOR ¶ 2.c alleges on about March 23, 2017, Applicant was “arrested for
and charged with two counts of Domestic Violence Assault, 4th degree. [He] entered into
a Pre-Trial Diversion Agreement.” Applicant’s children called their mother and complained
that Applicant was assaulting them. (Tr. 36-37; 45-51, 86-90) His former spouse and her
boyfriend arrived, and a physical altercation between Applicant and the boyfriend of his
former  spouse  and  Applicant’s  former  spouse  ensued.  (Id.)  Applicant  said  his  former
spouse’s boyfriend was the aggressor. (Id.) He accused his former spouse, her boyfriend,
and his children of lying about his behavior. (Id.) The police arrested Applicant. (Tr. 37)
When  the  police  searched  him,  they  found  methamphetamine  in  his  pocket.  (Tr.  47)
Applicant said his girlfriend put the methamphetamine in his pocket. (Tr. 47) He pleaded
guilty  to the two domestic  violence  charges  in  return for having the methamphetamine
charge  dismissed.  (Tr.  55)  He  entered  a  diversion  program.  (Tr.  55)  He  successfully
completed a one-year anger management program and a 10-week parenting class. (Tr.
55; AE E) He is on good terms with his former spouse and children. (Tr. 56)
Amended SOR ¶ 2.d alleges on about October 6, 2014, Applicant was “arrested
for contacting [his] ex-wife in violation of a no-contact order then in place.” Applicant said
he  was  assisting  his  daughter,  and  he  was  falsely  accused  of  violating  the  restraining
order. (Tr. 59-60) The charge was dismissed. (Tr. 58, 61) There is currently no restraining
order on Applicant. (Tr. 61)
Applicant said he   “will  never misuse   substances in   the   future.   This shall   include
use  or possession  of  any illegal  drug  or the  use  of a  legal  prescription  drug  without  a  valid
prescription   or  in  a   manner  inconsistent  with   their   intended   purpose.”  (AE   A)  He
“acknowledge[d]  that  any  future  involvement  or  misuse   is  grounds  for  revocation   of
national security eligibility.” (Id.)
Personal Conduct
Applicant said he filled out five SCAs from 2018 to 2022. (Tr. 62) However, only
two SCAs were admitted into evidence. (GE 1; GE 2) Applicant said he did not report his
involvement with illegal drugs on his SCAs because he hurried through the SCAs, and he
was complacent.  (Tr. 63) He revealed  his arrests to  security when  they occurred. (Tr. 64)
He believed  he  did  not need  to  disclose  information  that  was  previously disclosed.  (Tr.
64)  He said he  was honestly trying  to  disclose  accurate  information  on  his SCAs. (Tr. 65)
Amended  SOR ¶ 3.a  supersedes and  replaces SOR ¶¶  3.a, 3.b, and  3.c.  (Tr. 113)
Amended  SOR ¶  3.a  alleges Applicant falsified  material facts on  his September 30, 2020
SCA when  he  responded  to  the  following  question  in  Section  23  –  Illegal Use  of  Drugs  or
Drug Activity  as follows:
“In the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled
substances?  Use  of  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  includes  injecting,
snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming
any  drug  or  controlled  substance.”  [He]  answered:  “No,”  and  thereby
deliberately failed to disclose that information as set forth in [SOR ¶¶] 1.a
through 1.f. above.
In   his  September  30,   2020   SCA,   Applicant   disclosed   that   in   March  2017,  the   police
arrested   him   for  possession   of   methamphetamine   (one   count),   and   domestic  violence
assault in  the  4th  degree (two counts). (GE 1  at 34) In October 2017, he was found guilty
of  the   two  assaults.  (Id.) The  methamphetamine   charge   was  dismissed.   (Id. at  35) He
completed  two  years of  probation.  (Id.) In  May 2019, he  was arrested  for DUI,  and  he  was
pending   trial,  which  was  scheduled   for   October  2020.   (Id.   at   36)   However,  he   did   not
disclose  any  possession  and  use  of  illegal  drugs which  was  unrelated  to  the  charges in
law enforcement and court records. (Id. at 37-38)
Amended SOR ¶ 3.b alleges Applicant falsified material facts on his April 19, 2018
SCA when he responded to the following question in Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or
Drug Activity as follows:
“In  the  last seven  (7) years, have  you  illegally used any drugs  or controlled
substances?   Use   of   a   drug   or  controlled   substance   includes  injecting,
snorting,  inhaling, swallowing, experimenting  with  or  otherwise consuming
any  drug   or  controlled   substance.”   [He]   answered:  “No,”  and   thereby
deliberately failed  to  disclose  that information  as set forth  in [SOR ¶¶] 1.a
through 1.f. above.
In his April 19, 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed the March 2017, arrest, charges,
and disposition in October 2017, as indicated on his September 30, 2020 SCA, supra.
(GE 2 at 31-32) He disclosed the following criminal charges: his March 1997 possession
of drug paraphernalia charge and conviction; his April 1998 DUI charge and conviction;
and  his  April  2002  “DUI  Possible  paraphernalia”  charge,  which  resulted  in  a  reckless
driving  conviction.  (Id.  at  33-36) He  disclosed  treatment  for  “THC  (Such  as  marijuana,
weed, pot, hashish, etc.)” in January 2005. (Id. at 37) However, he did not disclose any
possession  and  use  of  illegal  drugs  which  was  unrelated  to  the  charges  in  law
enforcement and court records and the 2005 drug treatment records. (Id. at 36-37)
Amended SOR ¶ 3.c alleges Applicant falsified material facts in his responses to
DOHA  Interrogatories,  signed  by  him  on  August  9,  2022,  in  response  to  the  following
question:
“Have  you  EVER … illegally used  any  drugs or controlled  substances?  Use
includes  injecting,  snorting,  inhaling,   swallowing,  experimenting   with,  or
otherwise  consuming   any  drug   or  controlled   substance?”  [He]   answered
for
“Yes,”  but  deliberately  provided   only  partial  dates  of  use
methamphetamine   and   marijuana,  and   deliberately   omitted   [his]  use   of
amphetamines and cocaine.
Applicant  wrote  in  his  response  to  the  DOHA  interrogatory  about  his  history  of  drug
involvement that he used methamphetamine twice in October 2017, and marijuana four
times in May 2019. (Tr. 92; GE 4 at 4) At his hearing, he said he went through the DOHA
interrogatory quickly because he was trying to get the document completed. (Tr. 92-93)
He believed the government already had the information about his drug involvement. (Tr.
93, 96)
For the  falsification allegations, Applicant said, “[i]t’s not done  on  purpose. It’s not
trying to say that I didn’t do anything. I’ve said that I’ve done all of these things. I own up
to  them. I had  a  lapse  of judgment at these  times. I’ve  done  the  wrong  thing, you  know,
when  I’ve done  stuff that I shouldn’t have done. . . . I’m  not trying  to cover it up.” (Tr. 96-
97)
Character Evidence
Applicant loves his job, and he would like to continue in his current employment.
(Tr.  67,  111)  He  received  a  coin  and  a  letter  of  appreciation  from  his  employer  for
voluntarily working overtime, showing initiative. and resolving problems. (Tr. 67-69, 109;
AE P) He is trustworthy, reliable, and responsible. (Tr. 67) He does not believe he is a
risk to security. (Tr. 67)
Applicant provided 12 character statements from friends, family, and coworkers.
(SOR response; AE F; AE O) The general sense of their statements is that he is friendly,
hardworking, honest, and family oriented.

"Applicant  denied  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b.  He  admitted  the  SOR
allegations in ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d.  His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36  years old.  He earned  associates degrees  in 2006  and  2013  and  a
bachelor’s  degree   in   2016.   He   married   in  2010   and   has   three   minor  children.  He   has
worked for his current  employer, a federal contractor,  since  July 2020. (Item 3)
In  January  2022,  Applicant  completed  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions (SF 86). Section 23 asked about prior illegal drug use or drug activity. Applicant
disclosed that he used marijuana daily from May 2001 to January 2022. In response if he
intended to use this drug or controlled substance in the future, he responded “yes.” He
provided comments as follows:
I have been smoking for a long time. I have the ability to stop smoking when
needed and can go without but I like the calming feeling in the evening after
a stressful day. It also greatly helps me sleep.
This  is  the  only  section  of  the  entire  process  I  am  worried  about.  I
understand  how  my  choice  to  smoke  will  weight  [sic]  in  as  part  of  the
decision. To be 100% honest, I would like to continue to smoke as I believe
it does not affect my integrity or patriotism. (Item 3)
Section 23 also asked if, in the past seven years, Applicant had been involved in
the illegal purchase of a drug or controlled substance. He responded that he purchased
marijuana from September 2001 to November 2021 every few months. He said his reason
for  purchasing  it  was  because,  “To  get  marijuana  to  smoke  to  help  stress  and  sleep.”
Section 23 also asked if Applicant intended to engage in this activity in the future, and he
responded, “yes.” He said, “I would like to continue smoking so I would have to continue
to purchase.” (Item 3)
Applicant disclosed that he participated in counseling as a result of his illegal use
of  drugs  or  a  controlled  substance.  He  reported  he  was  ordered  by  his  employer  to
complete an online drug course. He stated, “After a positive random test at my previous
employer,  I  had  to  take  an  online  course  about  drugs.  I  completed  the  course  and  no
further action was needed.” (Item 3)
Applicant disclosed on his SF 86 that he was arrested in 2005 for possession of
marijuana. He pleaded guilty and served a week in jail. He completed the terms of his
sentence. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant was interviewed under oath by a government investigator in March 2022.
In his response to government interrogatories in November 2022, he authenticated his
statement to the government investigator. (Item 4)
Applicant told the investigator that he began using marijuana in May 2001 and has
used it almost daily since then. He likes the way it makes him feel. From May 2001 to
2010 he used it with a friend and other random people at parties. From 2010 to the date
of  his  interview,  he  used  it  by  himself  or  with  his  wife  or  half-brother.  His  mother  also
smokes  marijuana,  and  he  uses  it  with  her.  He  does  not  use  it  with  any  others.  He
explained he uses it nightly to relax and aid with sleep. He believes it helps him sleep and
alleviates some of his asthma symptoms. (Item 4)
Applicant further disclosed that he purchases about an ounce of marijuana from
his half-brother every two months for about $200. His last purchase, at the time of the
interview, was February 2022. He explained his half-brother is not a marijuana dealer but
buys it for personal use and sells it to him. (Item 4)
Applicant  does  not  believe  he  experiences  any  specific  stressors  that  cause
tension and does not believe he suffers from any anxiety or other condition which could
be  treated  by  a  medical  professional  in  lieu  of  marijuana.  He  has not  attempted  to  try
other techniques to help him relax because marijuana is effective. He is not specifically
anxious without using marijuana but enjoys the relaxation he gets from using it. (Item 4)
Applicant explained that his prior place of employment conducted a random drug
test in February 2019, and he tested positive for marijuana use. He admitted his use when
the  positive  results  were  reported.  His  supervisor  expressed  surprise  at  the  positive
results. He took an online drug education course required by his employer because he
was worried he would be fired. He completed the course, and no further action was taken
by his employer. He has never received any drug treatment. The course he took did not
include a drug assessment, counseling, or treatment. (Item 4)
Applicant told the investigator that he does not use any other illegal drugs, except
marijuana.  He  does  not  associate  with  any  other  illegal  drug  users,  except  his  family
members.  Marijuana  use  has  not  negatively  impacted  his  work,  even  when  he  tested
positive  at  his  work.  It  does  not  impact  his  physical  or  emotional  health,  judgment,  or
reliability. He has never been diagnosed as drug dependent and has never felt dependent
on marijuana and he can stop when he wants to with no difficulties. (Item 4)
Applicant  further  reported  that  he  has  stopped  using  marijuana  on  multiple
occasions  for  approximately  three  months,  specifically  when  he  was  changing  jobs
because of  the potential he would have  to participate in a  drug  screening.  He told  the
investigator that he stopped using marijuana for seven to eight months before accepting
his current employment. Once he obtains the employment and successfully passes the
drug screen, he resumes his marijuana use. (Item 4)
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  would  like  to  continue  his  marijuana  use
while holding a security clearance, as he does not use it during the day and has never
used it in the workplace. If he was required to choose, he would cease using it to obtain
a security clearance. He said his wife would also stop using it, as she only occasionally
smokes marijuana with him. He would ensure he was not in the presence of his mother
or half-brother when they used it but would continue to interact with them because of his
family relationship. (Item 4)
Applicant said that he has considered whether he should stop using marijuana due
to his age and because his children are getting older, and the potential health risks. He
said he may stop using marijuana at some point in the long-term future but  he did not
have a date or a plan to actually stop. He is aware that his use and purchase of marijuana
are illegal, but he continues use and purchase marijuana because he likes the feeling he
gets from smoking it. (Item 4)
Applicant updated his responses regarding his marijuana use and purchase in his
government interrogatories of November 2022. He was asked if he had used marijuana
since March 16, 2022. He stated he had used marijuana from that date to mid-June 2022
almost  daily.  He  then  reported  he  used  marijuana  from  September  23,  2022,  to  the
present (November 3, 2022). He disclosed that on September 23,  2022, he purchased
marijuana from a legal dispensary in another state while visiting there. He said he stopped
purchasing marijuana over the summer for three and a half months because he did not
want to make illegal purchases anymore. A question asked if he had in his possession
any marijuana? His response was that he had “some flower and a bowl in my garage.”
He confirmed that he has been with his wife, mother, and half-brother, who all continued
to smoke marijuana. (Item 4)
Applicant’s  interrogatory  responses  also  included  his  present  employer’s  drug
policy that employees shall not be under the influence or in possession of a controlled
substance while on the job or on company property. He also disclosed he was drug tested
by his current employer as a new hire. He said he was not informed as to the results of
the test. (Item 4)
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  said  he  stopped  smoking  marijuana  in
November 2022. He disputed that he had access to classified information. He stated at
that time a decision had not been made about his security clearance eligibility. If he had
been granted a clearance, he would have stopped smoking immediately. He stated he
had stopped smoking for four months and did not plan to continue to use marijuana in the
future. He further stated he made marijuana purchases over the years and the last was
in  September  2022  from  a  legal  dispensary.  He  said  he  did  not  intend  to  purchase
marijuana in the future. (Item 2)
Marijuana was illegal in the state where Applicant lived and purchased it. In the
November 2023 election, the state voted to make it legal for recreational use beginning
in 2024. ([State] Revised Code Section 3780)
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  he  denied  having  access  to  classified
information. He stated he has been open and honest about his past marijuana use. He
said that during his interview process he expressed that he would stop smoking marijuana
as  a  condition  of  his  security  clearance  decision.  He  stated  that  he  stopped  using
marijuana in November 2022. He stated, “The combination of this process and my kids
getting  older  has  brought  much-needed  awareness  to  my  use.  Also,  not  smoking  for
several months has made me  realize  I  don’t need  it.” He  further stated, “I feel my past
use will not affect the future of my ability to handle secure information or my allegiance to
my country.” (AE A)

"In Applicant’s SOR  response, he denied SOR allegation ¶ 1.a, and he admitted
SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.b and 2.a. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Additional findings follow. (SOR response)
Applicant is a 29-year-old electrical hardware engineer who has worked for a DOD
contractor  since June 2017.  He acknowledged that  he  was drug tested before he  was
offered a position with his employer. He is unmarried and does not have any children. He
graduated with his bachelor’s degree in 2017. In approximately June 2023, he enrolled in
a graduate degree program. Applicant has held a DOD security clearance since February
2018. (Tr. 13-15, 22-23; GE 1)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used marijuana with  varying  frequency  from about
July  2017  to  about  October  2022,  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.  He
intends to continue using marijuana in the future. Applicant admitted in his SOR response
that he used marijuana during the specified period but denied that he ever stated he had
a clear intention to use marijuana in the future.
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  Applicant  purchased  marijuana  on  various  occasions  from
approximately July 2012 to January 2017. Applicant admitted this information in his SOR
response  but  clarified  that  he  purchased  marijuana  less  than  10  times  during  his  five
years in college. Both SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were cross-alleged under Guideline E. (SOR
¶ 2.a)
In  June  2017,  Applicant  completed  an  SCA  and  disclosed  that  he  had  used
marijuana  recreationally  from  July  2012  through  January  2017.  He  listed  too  that  he
planned to smoke marijuana for recreation in the future, but only if it became legal and
acceptable to do so. He did not plan to use marijuana while employed by the government
and while it remained unacceptable by law. (GE 2)
Applicant participated in a background interview in November 2017, with a DOD
authorized investigator during the course of his security clearance investigation. Applicant
discussed his use and purchase of marijuana from 2012 through 2017. He stated that he
will not use illegal drugs in the future because he did not want to jeopardize his security
clearance  and  employment  with  a  DOD  contractor.  He  was  issued  a  DOD  security
clearance in February 2018. In October 2022, he reviewed the investigator’s report and
confirmed the recounted information was true and accurate. (GE 3; Tr. 14, 18-19)
In August 2021, Applicant completed another SCA, and he disclosed that he had
used marijuana randomly for recreation from July 2012 through August 2020. He listed:
I do plan to randomly smoke marijuana for recreation in the future, only if it
becomes legal and acceptable to do so. I do not plan to partake in marijuana
use while unacceptable by law. (GE 1)
In October 2021, Applicant participated in another background interview. The DOD
authorized investigator asked him what his future intentions were for smoking marijuana
which is illegal under federal law. Applicant stated that he does not plan to use marijuana
in  the  future,  but  he  might  if  he  feels  like  smoking  it  in  the  moment.  He  has  smoked
marijuana recreationally and casually. He could not state with certainty what he may or
may not do in the future. He enjoys creating music and being involved in musical projects
where marijuana is usually involved, and he usually partakes in this type of environment.
In  October  2022,  Applicant  reviewed  the  investigator’s  report  and  confirmed  the
recounted information was true and accurate. (GE 3; Tr. 14, 19-20)
DOHA sent Applicant interrogatories about his illegal drug involvement. In October
2022, Applicant responded to the interrogatories, and he listed that from January 2002
through October 2022, he had used marijuana on approximately four or five occasions.
During the October 2023 hearing, Applicant stated that he last used marijuana in October
2022, and he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. (GE 4; Tr. 15-18)
Applicant testified during the hearing that he has matured over the past few years
by focusing more on his education and career. He does not intend to use marijuana in the
future. He admitted that he is still involved in the music scene and is frequently around
colleagues who use marijuana. Although he may not be able to avoid marijuana in that
environment, he has made his boundaries clear to his colleagues and he does not intend
to participate in the use of marijuana. (Tr. 20-22)
Applicant  admitted  that  his  employer  provided  annual  security  briefings,  but  he
could not recall specifically if there was any information provided about illegal drug use.
He acknowledged that he had learned from the training that if he were ever arrested for
violating the law, for example, he would need to report that adverse information to the
facility security officer (FSO). When asked if he had ever reported his use of marijuana to
the FSO after he received a security clearance in February 2018, he said he had not. He
denied ever participating in a substance abuse counseling program. (Tr. 23- 25)
During the hearing, the following relevant information was addressed:
ADMIN. JUDGE BENSON: Okay. Sir, in your subject interview in November
2017, you said you would not use marijuana in the future because you did
not want to jeopardize your security clearance or your job. But you used it
after 2017, you used it every year up until October 2022, is that correct?
APPLICANT: Yes, based on what I reported there, yes. And what I reported
is true.
ADMIN. JUDGE BENSON: So, every time you used it after that statement
you made, you knew it was wrong, correct?
APPLICANT: Yeah, after that statement, yeah, I have to take accountability
for any use that happened whether I initiated it or not. (Tr. 25)

"In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denies  all  allegations  in  the  SOR  with
explanations as mentioned below.
Applicant  is  a  23-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  who  seeks  a  security
clearance. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He has been employed
with  his  current  employer  full-time  since  graduating  from  high  school  in  2019.  In  high
school,  he  interned  during  summers  for  his employer.  He  initially  worked  at  a  location
where  a  security  clearance  is  not  required.  He  transferred  to  a  new  duty  position  and
location  which  requires  a  security  clearance.  He  has  some  college  credits,  but  no
degree. He is single and has no children. (GE 1, Tr.9, 14-17)
(Note: The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names
of  witnesses,  or  locations  in  order  to  protect  Applicant’s  and  his  family’s  privacy.  The
cited sources contain more specific information.)
The SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from January
2017  to  September  2022.  (SOR  ¶  1.a:  GE  1;  GE  2)  The  SOR  also  alleges  Applicant
intends to continue using marijuana. (SOR ¶ 1.b: GE 1 at 22; GE 2 at 7)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denies  the  allegation  under  SOR  ¶  1.a
because he did not start using marijuana until 2019. He obtained a medical marijuana
card  on  January  25,  2000.  It  expired  on  August  22,  2022.  (AE  A)  He  used  medical
marijuana for anxiety. He suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to
an  incident  that  happened  when  he  was  a  child.  He  would  use  marijuana  while  alone
about three evenings a week if he could not sleep. (Tr. 23; GE 1, GE 2 at 7)
On his March 3, 2022 security clearance application, in response to  section 23-
Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, “In the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used
any drugs or controlled substances?,” Applicant listed he used marijuana from January
2017  to  March  2022.  He  indicated  his  use  was  related  to  a  “medical  card.”  Applicant
also mentioned that when he was 19, he was pulled over and the police discovered 3.5
grams  of  marijuana  in  his  car.  (GE  1  at  21-22)  During  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified
that  he  put  the  incorrect  date  of  when  he  began  using  marijuana  on  his  security
clearance application. It was his first time applying for a security clearance and he made
mistakes  on  the  security  clearance  application.  He  had  a  difficult  time  completing  the
application and no one was very helpful while he was completing it. He actually began
using marijuana in 2019. (Tr. 20-21)
In May 2019, Applicant and his friend were driving to a concert. The police pulled
them over.  The police searched his car and discovered 3.5 grams of marijuana in the
car. The police confiscated the marijuana and issued Applicant a ticket. He resolved the
ticket  as  soon  as  he  could.  He  denies  that  he  ingested  marijuana  before  the  police
pulled him over. (Tr. 27-28)
A follow-up question under section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity on
his  March  2022  security  clearance  application  asked  “Provide  explanation  of  why  you
intend or do not intend to use this drug or controlled substance in the future?” Applicant
answered, “Medical card.”  During an interview with the investigator who conducted his
security  clearance  background  investigation  on  March  28,  2022,  Applicant  told  the
investigator  that  he  possessed  a  medical  marijuana  card  and  that  he  used  medical
marijuana  to  treat  his  anxiety  and  PTSD.  He  also  mentioned  that  he  intended  to  use
medical marijuana in the future. (Gov 2 at 7)
Applicant believed that there was no security issue with using medical marijuana.
He  did  not  understand  that  although  his  marijuana  use  was  legal  under  state  law,  it
remained  illegal  under  federal  law.  He  was  not  made  aware  of  this  until  his  family
members,  (especially  his  grandfather)  told  him  that  marijuana  use  remained  an  issue
when  applying  for  a  security  clearance.  He  now  understands  that  marijuana  remains
illegal under federal law. He stopped using marijuana about a month before his medical
marijuana card expired (July 2022) because he felt he did not need it anymore. He did
not reapply for a medical marijuana card when it expired in August 2022.  He now deals
with  his  anxiety  by  running  and  fishing.  He  does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the
future. He submitted a statement indicating he will abstain from all drug involvement and
substance  misuse.  He  acknowledged  any  future  involvement  or  misuse  may  result  in
the revocation of his security clearance. (Tr. 23-31; AE B)
Whole-Person  Factors
Mr. J.P. wrote a letter on Applicant’s behalf. He has known him for 11 years. He
describes him as hard-working. He is interested in cars and machinery. He likes to know
how things work.  Mr. J.P. says Applicant is capable and has the work ethic to make him
successful. (AE C at 1)
Mrs.  T.  B.  has  been  Applicant’s  step-grandmother  since  2019.  She  has  known
him  since 2017. She  is  aware  Applicant used  marijuana and had a  medical  card.  She
thought  it  was  a  poor  decision  on  his  part  and  marijuana  use  had  no  place  when
working  for  a  defense  contractor.  In  the  summer  2022,  he  assured  her  that  he  had
stopped  using  marijuana.  She  has  observed  a  change  in  his  judgment,  clarity,  and
presence  since  that  time.  She  has  talked  with  Applicant  about  his  future  and  he  is
committed to following rules and regulations.
Applicant occasionally takes his younger siblings on outings and drives them to
after  school  activities.  Mrs  T.B.  describes  him  as  trustworthy  and  responsible  for  the
safety of the children while in his care. Mrs. T.B. is writing a Letter of Recommendation
for  Applicant  because  he  has  “successfully  overcome  obstacles”  and  “demonstrated
good choices and judgment for well over a year.” (AE C at 2)

"In  Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted  the  SOR allegations  in ¶¶  1.a, 2.a, and

Applicant is a 40-year-old staff electrical engineer who has worked for his current
employer, a defense contractor, for five years. (Tr. 30, 32; AE H) In 2006, he received a

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges on at least three occasions in 2011 and 2012, Applicant stole
his mother’s or his father’s Vicodin (hydrocodone) and then used the medication. In 2011,
Applicant had two surgeries. (Tr. 43) He was prescribed hydrocodone for pain after both
surgeries. (Tr. 43) In 2011 or 2012, he took three hydrocodone pills from an old bottle in
the bathroom. (Tr. 43) The pills were prescribed for his father. (Tr. 43) He used the three
hydrocodone  pills on  three  occasions  in 2011  or 2012.  (Tr. 43) He took  the  three  pills
because he was coming off of his prescription for hydrocodone, and he believed he would
feel better. (Tr. 44) He had a valid prescription for hydrocodone on the first two occasions
in  which  he  used  his  father’s  prescription,  and  his father’s  prescription  was  at  a  lower
dosage  than  his  own  prescription.  (Tr.  44)  He  did  not  ask  for  his  father’s  permission
because he knew what he was doing was wrong, and he knew he would feel ashamed.
(Tr. 45) He rationalized that he was borrowing the pills, and then later after he took the
pills, he elected not to tell his father. He took the third pill after his prescription expired
because he was feeling a “bit sluggish” and wanted to feel better. (Tr. 46)
In  2016  and  2017,  Applicant was  prescribed  hydrocodone  after two  surgeries. (Tr.
46) He complied  with  the  terms of those  prescriptions. (Tr. 47) On  September 3,  2018,  he
completed  an  SCA,  which asked  two  questions relevant to  his Vicodin  use: (1) “Have  you
EVER  illegally  used   or  otherwise  been   illegally  involved   with   a   drug   or  controlled
substance  while possessing  a  security clearance  other than  previously listed?”; and  “In
the last seven years, have you intentionally engaged in the misuse  of prescription  drugs,
regardless of whether or not  the  drugs were   prescribed  for you  or someone  else?” He
answered,  “No,”  to   both   questions.  (GE  4   at  45)  He  failed   to   disclose   any  misuse   of
Vicodin  on this SCA. (Tr. 41)  Falsification of  his 2018 SCA was not alleged in the  SOR.

SOR ¶  1.a  alleges, and  Applicant  admitted,  in  about October  2020,  while granted
the   prescription   medication   Vicodin
access
(hydrocodone), th  at was not prescribed  to  him.  (Tr. 34)  SOR ¶  2.a alleges  and  Applicant
admitted  in about October 2020, he  stole his aunt’s Vicodin  (hydrocodone) and  then  used
the  Vicodin. (Tr. 35) In  October 2020, he went to  his aunt’s residence to water her plants
while she  was away.  (Tr. 55) He  went  to  the  bathroom  and  found  a  bottle  of  Vicodin.  He
took four Vicodin  pills out of  the  bottle. (Tr. 35) He was not thinking  about his security
clearance  when  he  used  the  Vicodin.  (Tr. 34) He was depressed  and  anxious because  of
problems in his relationships with  his spouse  and  parents,  and  due  to  isolation  during  the
pandemic. (Tr.  35, 53) He wanted  to  take  “some  kind  of mental  health  break.”  (Tr. 57) He
used   two   Vicodin  on   two  separate   days.  (Tr.  35-36,  56-57)  He  felt  more  relaxed;  his
anxiety   was   reduced;  he  felt   a   little dizzy; and  he   did   not   feel like   doing   anything   after
taking  the  Vicodin. (Tr. 56) He did  not drive  or go  to  work after taking  the  Vicodin.  (Tr. 57-
58) He was mostly teleworking  during  the  pandemic. (Tr. 57) He acknowledged  that he
made  a bad decision. (Tr. 35) He admitted what he did was wrong. (Tr. 37)
Every four or five weeks for the last three years, Applicant has met with a therapist.
(Tr.  49;  AE  R)  His  support  system  has  improved  in  the  last  three  years.  (Tr.  50)  His
relationships  with  his  spouse  and  brother  have  improved.  (Tr.  51)  On  April  3,  2023,  a
licensed social worker provided a chemical dependency assessment of Applicant. (AE A)
The social worker said:
Even though [Applicant’s] past use of pain medication is alarming and very
serious in  nature, given  he  has  not used  any opioids  in the  past 24  months,
I have  very few concerns about the  limited  scope  of medication  abuse  he
acknowledged. Having  carefully considered  the  drug  use  he  was  willing  to
admit  to  and  the  nature  by  which this substance abuse has been  revealed,
there  are  no  substance  abuse-focused  treatment  intervention  that  I feel are
essential for [Applicant’s] situation at this time.
* * *
Without any basis for a  DSM-5  alcohol or substance  use  disorder,  I have  no
treatment recommendations for [Applicant] at this time. (AE A  at 2-3)
In March 2023, Applicant told his aunt about taking her Vicodin pills. (Tr. 36-37)
She did not notice the pills were missing. (Tr. 38) She was very gracious about his theft
of her Vicodin, and she thanked him for telling her. (Tr. 38) He does not intend to use
Vicodin in the future because he believed his Vicodin use was unhealthy and contrary to
the best interests of his family and career. (Tr. 38)
Applicant  has  gone  to  counseling  and  concluded  that  his  relationship  with  his
parents  is  over.  (Tr.  39)  Applicant  and  his  spouse  disagree  with  his  parents’  political
views. (Tr. 52) His parents tend to lecture their children about why their political beliefs
are erroneous. (Tr. 52) Applicant is more mature now than he was in 2020. (Tr. 39) He
relies  on  coping  mechanisms  he  has  learned  and  on  his  faith  to  “live  every  day  with
purpose.” (Tr. 39-40)
In his August 5, 2022 SCA, Applicant said he did not misuse prescription drugs;
however,  in  the  comments  he  said  he  took  four  Vicodin  pills  from  his  aunt  while
housesitting. (GE 1) He indicated in his SCA that he did not believe this conduct raised a
security concern. (GE 1) In his response to DOHA interrogatories, he disclosed that he
took a few Vicodin pills  from  his parents in the  second half of 2011  and the  first three
months of 2012. (GE 2)
The reason Applicant answered, “No,” on his SCA was because he was in denial
about the seriousness of his misuse of Vicodin. (Tr. 41; GE 2 at 8) However, he wanted
to have a clean conscience and elected to disclose the misuse of the Vicodin on his SCA.
(Tr. 41)
On March 22, 2023, Applicant provided a statement in which he promised to “never
use or abuse non-prescribed drugs or any other drugs in the future.” (AE B) He continued,
“If  I  fail  to  adhere  to  this  statement,  I  consent  to  automatic  revocation  of  my  security
clearance.” (AE B) He does not associate with users of illegal drugs. (GE 2 at 8)
On July 21, 2023, Applicant provided a hair sample, which tested negative for the
presence  of evidence  of illegal drug  use. (AE  O) “Hair  drug  testing  can  typically detect
drug use up to 90 days in the past” starting seven to ten days after use.  (Id.)
On August 17, 2023, a psychologist evaluated Appellant’s mental health. (AE S)
The psychologist concluded that Applicant “does not present with evidence of behavioral
or  personality  patterns,  or  mental  health  conditions  that  could  reasonably  degrade  his
reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment in the context of protecting classified information
and/or working in a cleared settling.” (AE S at 8)
Applicant has not violated the terms of any prescriptions for use of drugs or used
someone else’s prescription drugs after October 2020. (Tr. 47-48) He assured he will not
violate the terms of prescription for use of drugs in the future because violating rules for
taking prescription drugs made him feel terrible, and he wants to be able to provide for
his  family  and  avoid  possible  adverse  health  effects.  (Tr.  47-49)  He  has  never  been
arrested, and  aside  from  the  SOR  allegations,  he has never used  an  illegal drug after
becoming an adult. (Tr. 59) He understands the responsibilities and obligations that come
with  holding  a  security  clearance,  and  he  considers  himself  to  be  an  honest  and
trustworthy person of high moral character. (Tr. 53-54)
Character Evidence
A  coworker,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  five  years,  described  him  as  highly
qualified,  diligent,  mission  oriented,  honest,  careful  with  classified
information,
professional, and an asset to his company. (Tr. 12-16; AE I) Applicant’s supervisor has
known Applicant for 30 months. (Tr. 23-24) He described Applicant as diligent, productive,
honest, and trustworthy. (Tr. 25-28; AE I; AE L) They recommended that Applicant retain
his security clearance. (Tr. 17, 29)
Applicant  provided  four  written  statements  from  coworkers  who  did  not  make
verbal statements on his behalf at his hearing. (AE I) The general sense of their letters is
that Applicant is professional, productive, reliable, trustworthy, and responsible. (AE I)
Applicant  received  outstanding  performance  reviews.  (AE  L)  He  completed
numerous  continuing  education  and  training  courses,  and  he  received  certificates  for
achievements and for completion of the courses. (AE F; AE K; AE P; AE Q) He received
cash awards, recognition awards, and recognition points for outstanding work on behalf
of his employer. (AE G; AE J; AE M)

"Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2016.  He  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance  for  the  first
time.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2015  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2020.  He  is
married without children. (Tr. at 27, 32, 40; GE 1, 3)
Applicant  started  using  marijuana  in  2015,  when  he  was  in  his  last  year  of
college.  It  increased  until  it  was  essentially  daily.  He  used  cocaine  on  about  10  to  15
occasions in 2015. He stopped using illegal drugs for about a year after he graduated
college. (Tr. at 15-16, 22-24; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3; AE A)
Applicant  resumed  using  marijuana  in  2016  after  he  was  hired  by  his  current
employer, which has a drug-free workplace policy. He lives in a state where marijuana
possession  and  use  do  not  violate  any  state  laws.  He  used  ecstasy  (3,  4-
methylenedioxy-methamphetamine or MDMA) on three occasions in 2019, and he used
cocaine and LSD in 2021. He justified his drug use to himself by never using it at work
or when it could affect his work. (Tr. at 16-19, 24-32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1, 3; AE A)
Applicant  started  using  marijuana  less  frequently  until  he  ended  all  illegal  drug
use in about February 2022. He regrets his past drug use. He became engaged, and he
and his wife married in August 2022. They plan to have children in the near future, and
he does not want drugs to be a part of their lives. He feels he has “matured away from
that lifestyle.” He admits that his application for a security clearance played some part in
his decision to stop using illegal drugs, but he stated that he would have stopped even if
he had never applied for a clearance. He is happy with his family life and his job, and he
does not intend to let drugs jeopardize either. He no longer associates outside of work
with the coworkers with whom he used drugs. He provided a signed statement of intent
to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any
future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr.

Applicant  received  a  substance  abuse  evaluation  from  a  certified  addiction
specialist  in  April 2023.  The evaluator reported  that  she  “did not find  any  indicators or
evidence  that  met  the  criteria  for  a  current  misuse,  abuse,  or  dependence  issue  of
substances at this time.” (Tr. at 33-36; AE B, D)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF-86)  in
April 2022. He meticulously reported his use of marijuana, cocaine, MDMA and LSD. He
fully discussed his illegal drug use during his background interview in May 2022. (Tr. at

Applicant called a witness, and he  submitted documents and letters attesting to
his  excellent  job  performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  work

"Applicant  is  a  24-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  working  as  an
inspector. He has worked for his current employer since 2017. He seeks to reestablish
his security clearance. He earned his high school diploma in 2017 and has completed
some apprentice courses but has not obtained a degree. He previously held a security
clearance from December 2017 until it was suspended in September 2021. He is single,
lives with his partner, and they have three young children. (GE 1 at 12, 14, and 21; Tr.
17-18.)
In  Applicant’s Answer to  the  SOR, he  admitted  the  three  Guideline  H allegations.
SOR  ¶   1.a,  that  he   purchased   and   used   marijuana   with   varying   frequency  from   about
January  2012  through January 2019.  SOR ¶ 1.b,  that he purchased  and  used  marijuana
as set forth  in subparagraph  1.a  after being  granted  access to  classified  information  in
2018.  SOR ¶  1.c, that  in  January  2019  he  was arrested  and  charged  with  (1) sell, give,  or
distribute  more  than  one-half ounce, but less than  five  pounds of marijuana, a  felony,  and
(2) carrying  concealed  weapon. He pled  no  contest to  a reduced  drug  charge  of sell, give,
or distribute  less than  one-half ounce  (misdemeanor). He  was  sentenced  to  12-months'
confinement (11  months suspended), and  three-years'  probation, which  ended  in October
2022.
Applicant stated he started to use marijuana when he was 13 and from 2012 to
2017 he smoked marijuana on a daily basis (Tr. at 18-19.) He stopped smoking marijuana
from March 2017 to about February 2018, which was around the time he was hired by his
employer, but he could not recall why he stopped. (Tr. at 20.)  In his security clearance
interview  he  told  the  investigator  he  stopped  to  prepare  for  attending  college  and
apprentice school where he knew he would be required to pass a drug screening. (GE 3
at 6.) After February 2018 he described his usage as “more of a weekly basis…not every
day.” (Tr. at 20.) He estimated he would probably purchase about an ounce of marijuana
a week. (Tr. at 20-21.) When he resumed smoking marijuana in February 2018 he held a
clearance;  had  been  granted  to  classified  information,  and  he  acknowledged  in  his
testimony it was not allowed. (Tr. at 21-22; GE 1 at 27.) He explained his duties generally
and generally what his security clearance had allowed him access to inspect until it was
suspended. (Tr. at 22.)
In January 2019, Applicant was pulled over and the officer smelled marijuana in
the vehicle. A search of the vehicle found about seven ounces of marijuana in a glass
cistern, which he purchased for about $1,000.  (Tr. at 24, 25-26; GE 5.) He denied any
intentions to sell the marijuana. (Tr. at 26.) He told the investigator he would purchase
enough  to  avoid  the  long  drive.  (GE  3  at  5.)  The  felony  charge  was  reduced  to  a
misdemeanor as  part of  a  plea  agreement. He  served  the  unsuspended  portion  of  his
sentence on weekends, paid a fine, and served probation for three years. (Tr. at 24.) The
carrying  a  concealed  weapon  charge  was  dismissed.  He  claimed  that  he  was  legally
carrying the weapon. He testified; “trying to do my due diligence in reading it upon the law
on how to carry my weapon. And, I believe I had it contained legally. It was in a bag that
was zipped up that I couldn’t reach in the back of the vehicle.” (Tr. at 27.) It was inside
the bag with the marijuana. (Tr. at 34.) The weapon was not registered in his name but
stated it was a gift to him  from his brother. (Tr. at 27, 34; GE 3 at 7.) He reported the
incident to his supervisor and no action was taken by his employer. (GE 3 at 7.)
Applicant  stated  he  stopped  using  marijuana  after  January  2019  because  the
arrest was “like a reality check, you know, how fast things can go wrong.” (Tr. at 28.) He
explained to the investigator that he has his children to live for now and cannot risk  being
fired because of illegal drugs. He does not want his children around illegal drugs. (GE 3
at 7.) He has not attended any substance abuse courses. He no longer associates with
people who use marijuana. He has never failed an employer drug test. (Tr. at 29.) There
are  no  further  terms  on  his  conviction.  (Tr.  at  39.)  He  stated  in  response  to  DOHA
interrogatories he had no intention of further use of marijuana. (GE 3 at 13.)
Applicant in his Answer denied SOR ¶ 2.a. Department Counsel queried Applicant
about the denial and pointed out this was a cross-allegation of SOR ¶ 1.c. In response to
Department Counsel’s question, Applicant responded he is not disputing the Guideline J
allegation. (Tr. at 28.)
SOR ¶  3.a cross-alleges the SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c, which Applicant denies but
admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c.  The  underlying  facts  were  discussed  above  under
Guideline H. I applied those facts discussed above to SOR ¶ 3.a.
Applicant denies SOR ¶ 3.b, that he: Falsified material facts on a  Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF-86) executed on August 18, 2021, by answering “No”
to:
Section  23-Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or
Controlled Substances: In the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used
any drugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance
includes  injecting  snorting  inhaling,  swallowing  experimenting  with  or
otherwise consuming any drug or controlled substance?
He testified  he  believed  it was a  clerical error and  “when  [he] first lied  about
it in 2017. When  [he] went back and  when  [he] went to  refill  this out, a  lot  of things
[he]   didn’t  change,   and   [he] believe[s]  this is   one   of  the   pages [he]   missed,  just
skipped through.” (Answer and  Tr. at 30-31.) He believed  he  was being  open and
honest  in   his  application   when   discussing   the   discrepancy  with   the   security
clearance investigator. (GE 3  at 6.)
Applicant denies  SOR ¶ 3.c, that he: Falsified material facts on an  SF-86 dated
August 18, 2021, by answering “No” to:
Section  22-Police  Record  Police  Record  (EVER):  Other  than  those
offenses already listed, have you EVER had the following happen to you?
Have  you  EVER  been  charged  with  an  offense  involving  firearms  or
explosives?.”
Applicant reported the incident in the drug section of the SF-86. (GE 1 at 27, 34.)
He testified “I didn’t state something, but I believe it was stated in another question, and
that’s why I didn’t restate it.” (Tr. at 16-17.)
Applicant admits SOR ¶ 3.d, that he: Falsified material facts on an SF-86 executed
on September 26, 2017, pertaining to “Section 23-Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity”
when he stated “No” to whether he had illegally used drugs or controlled substances in
the last seven years. (Answer and Tr. at 30-31.) He acknowledged the lie in his testimony,
“When I filled out the one in 2017, I did lie knowingly about my marijuana usage. I was
18, freshly coming out of high school, and really didn’t know  what I was getting into when
I done that one.” (Tr. at 16.) His reason for not revealing his marijuana use at the time; “I
thought it would affect my employment.” (Tr. at 31.)
Applicant very credibly described the difference between the man he was in 2019
and the man he has become. Four years ago, he would come home, smoke marijuana,
and go to sleep. He would get off work, smoke and sleep until about 1800, 1900, 2000,
then get up and eat, maybe smoke again, and just do nothing, lay around the house all
day. (Tr. at 38.) He is now a father of three, his oldest child was born in August 2020. He
normally works during the week from 0500 to 1300. When he gets home, he takes care
of the yard and works on his truck because the children are napping until 1600. When
they wake up he is with the children making them a snack and taking them to an activity
like a jump park, painting, or playing in the sprinkler and after that it would be dinnertime.
After dinner there is some more playtime and then it is time to  “change diapers, [and] get
ready to go to bed.”  (Tr. at 38.) Typically, the weekend is spent just trying to keep  the
children  busy  and  “not  making  a  mess  inside  the  house.”  (Tr.  at  36)  He  offered  as
examples attending group children’s readings at a local bookstore or going to the beach.
His hobby is working in the driveway on his two vehicles. Aside from a “cold beer on a hot
day” otherwise he does not drink. (Tr. at 37-38.)

findings  of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a 35-year-old software engineer who has worked for the same defense
contractor for 11 years. (Tr. 7, 8, 24) In 2006, he graduated from high school, and in 2013,

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
On  September  6,  2022,  Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  and
provided the recency and frequency in which he used various illegal drugs. (GE 2 at 2)
He agreed at his hearing that those answers were correct. (Tr. 25) The information about
his recency and frequency of his use of illegal drugs is detailed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through
1.f, infra.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used marijuana with  varying  frequency  from about
August 2002 to about July 2021. He used marijuana once or twice a year from 2016 to
July  2021.  (Tr.  25;  GE  1  at  49)  He  smoked  marijuana  once  and  ate  CBD  edibles  or
gummies  about  six  times  in  2021.  (Tr.  26,  28,  47)  He  was  unsure  if  the  CBD  edibles
contained  tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC).  (Tr.  26)  He  ate  Cannabidiol  (CBD)  edibles  on
several  weekends  because  he  had  pain  in  his  back,  and  the  CBD edibles  helped  him
sleep. (Tr. 27, 47) He has improved his office equipment and  received therapy to help
with his back pain. (Tr. 36) His most recent use of an illegal drug involved his consumption
of CBD in July 2021 or smoking a marijuana joint earlier in 2021.

frequency from about August 2014 to about July 2016. He said he used mushrooms three
times  while  hiking  with  others  in  the  woods.  (GE  1  at  50)  The  most  recent  use  of
mushrooms was in July 2016 while with friends camping. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant used cocaine with varying frequency from about May
2015 to about July 2018. He used cocaine a total of three times: once in 2015; once in
2016; and once in 2018. (Tr. 31-32) When he used cocaine the first two times, he ingested
four lines or bumps. (Tr. 31) The third time he ingested one line of cocaine at a friend’s
bachelor’s party in 2018. (Tr. 30-31)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant used 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)
or ecstasy on at least one occasion on approximately May 2016. He received a dose of
ecstasy from a friend at a music concert in May 2016, and he used the ecstasy. (GE 1 at
51; GE 2 at 2)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant misused the prescription medication, Xanax,  which
was  not  prescribed  to  him,  on  at  least  one  occasion  in  approximately  October  2015.
Applicant said a friend gave him one half of a Xanax pill when he was in a bar, and he
used the Xanax in October 2015. (GE 1 at 52; GE 2 at 2)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges Applicant used LSD on at least one occasion in approximately
May 2016. He said he used LSD at a music concert in May 2016. (GE 1 at 50; GE 2 at 2)
Applicant  voluntarily  and  truthfully  reported  his  use  of  illegal  drugs.  (Tr.  18)  He
regretted  his  poor  decisions  to  use  illegal  drugs.  (Tr.  17,  49)  At  the  time  he  was
experimenting with illegal drugs, he did not realize or appreciate the problematic nature
of  this  illegal  drug  use.  (Tr.  17)  Since  2021,  he  consumes  less  than  one  alcoholic
beverage per month. (Tr. 18)
Applicant  ended  his illegal drug  use  because  he  is more  mature.  (Tr.  34)  He  is
diligently  trying  to  improve  himself.  (Tr.  49)  He  ended  his  experimentation  with  illegal
drugs, and he does not attend parties and concerts where  drugs are used. (Tr. 36) He
has a good relationship with his girlfriend, and he wants to live a healthy lifestyle. (Tr. 34)

"Under  Guideline  H, the  SOR  alleged that  between  May  2017 and  at  least  June
2023,  Applicant  used  marijuana  “multiple  times  a  week”  (SOR  1.a);  that  between
December 2017 and at least April 2023, he used hallucinogenic mushrooms (SOR 1.b);
that  he  used  LSD once  in  2020  (SOR  1.c); and  that he  intends  to continue  his use of
marijuana  and  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  (SOR  1.d).  In  addition  to  admitting  each  of
those allegations, he provided the following statement:
[M]y use of recreational drugs on my personal time in no way reflects upon
my trustworthiness as a keeper of national secrets. I do not plan to change
my lifestyle because that would be absurd, and directly contradictory to the
first  sentence  of  this  statement.  If  the  DOD  wants  a  dog  who  has  no
personal principles, they can find one elsewhere. (FORM, Items 1 and 2)
In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by Applicant’s admissions, and based on my
review of the information presented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  27-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked as a software engineer since June 2016. In his e-QIP, he disclosed the drug use
listed  in  the  SOR.  Specifically,  he  disclosed  he  was  a  regular  (sometimes  daily)  and
ongoing user of marijuana, both by smoking and in edible form. He also disclosed he had
used LSD on one occasion in 2020, but that he would not use it again because he did not
have  a  good  experience  with  that  drug.  Finally,  he  disclosed  that  he  had  used
hallucinogenic,  or  “magic,”  mushrooms  in  2017  and  2018.  During  his  personal  subject
interview (PSI) with a government investigator in January 2023, and in a June 9, 2023,
response  to  interrogatories  propounded  by  DOHA  Department  Counsel,  he  confirmed
and updated the information about his drug use provided in his e-QIP. Notably, he told
the  investigator  that  he  had  purchased  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  just  before  he
submitted his e-QIP and that he had used them between then and the date of his PSI.
(FORM, Items 3 and 4)
The drugs in question –  marijuana containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), LSD,
and hallucinogenic “magic” mushrooms – are or contain federally controlled substances,
the unauthorized possession and use of which are  criminal violations of the Controlled
Substances  Act,  21  U.S.C.  §  801  et  seq.  During  his  PSI,  he  acknowledged  his
understanding that use of marijuana is still a violation of federal criminal law. Nonetheless,
he affirmed his intention to continue using marijuana and magic mushrooms. In response
to Department Counsel’s interrogatories, he stated he intends to continue using marijuana
and  hallucinogenic mushrooms because  they are “integral to  [his] artistic process.” He
has not provided any details regarding what that process might entail. He also relies on
the fact that use and possession of marijuana are generally legal in the state where he
lives. (FORM, Items 2 – 4)
Guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in
February  2013,  which  was  updated  by  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (DNI)  in
December  2021,  makes  clear  that  changes  in  the  laws  pertaining  to  marijuana  by  the
various states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the  current National
Security  Adjudicative  Guidelines.  Because  federal  law  supersedes  state  laws  on  this
issue, Applicant’s use of marijuana, regardless of location or even medical justification in
his state of residence, was illegal. Further, federal workplaces prohibit illegal drug use by
civilian federal employees and by persons employed for work on federal contracts.

The following are salient excerpts from Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI)
(Item 5 at 4-6):
Applicant used marijuana from about January 2004 to July 2020. He used it daily
from a pipe or a bong. He denied any adverse effects or that he became addicted to it.
His  usage  was  within  his  budget  and  cost  between  $20  to  $40  per  week.  In  about
February 2020, he decided to stop using for health and overall wellness reasons. He has
no plans to ever return to using marijuana.
Applicant  used  mushrooms  from  about  January  2010  to  August  2020.  He  used
infrequently,  probably  twice,  and  did  not  have  favorable  experiences.  He  did  not  get
addicted to the drug.
Applicant used cocaine from about January 2011 to January 2018 socially fewer
than five times. He did not get addicted to the drug and has no intention of using it in the
future.
Applicant used heroin and opium from about January 2017 to April 2017. He did
get addicted to heroin and was using it several times per day. It was costing him $1,000
to $1,500 per day. When he realized what was happening to him, he quit using the drug
“cold  turkey.”  It  was  causing  him  financial  stress,  and  that  was  one  of  the  reasons  he
stopped using the drug.
Applicant  used  Adderall  from  about  January  2017  to  January  2019.  He  had  a
prescription for about a month during that period (duration not stated) and knew its effects.
After that, he had a friend who had a prescription and who gave him some on perhaps
five occasions.
Applicant described himself as a free spirit when younger and was not afraid  to
experiment with illegal drugs. He was also curious about the effects of those drugs. He
has since realized the danger of that attitude. He has decided that illegal substances will
not help him have a brighter future and has made a conscious decision to stop all uses
of illegal drugs. He has not had any treatment or cessation programs but stopped all uses
on his own. He is adamantly against the use of any illegal drugs at this point in his life
and has no intentions of using in the future.
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
that  security
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability  for  a  security  clearance,  an
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. The guidelines are flexible
rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the whole-
person  concept.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available  and  reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  The  protection  of  the  national  security  is  the  paramount  consideration.  AG  ¶
2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under Directive ¶  E3.1.14, the  Government must present evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant  or proven  by Department  Counsel. . ..” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
Discussion
Under AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be  questioned or put into
doubt because  drug  use  can both  impair  judgment and  raise questions about a  person’s
ability or willingness to  with laws, rules and regulations:
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription
and  non-prescription  drugs,  and  the  use  of  other  substances  that  cause
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their
intended  purpose  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual's  reliability  and
trustworthiness,  both  because  such  behavior  may  lead  to  physical  or
psychological  impairment  and  because  it  raises  questions  about  a  person's
ability  or  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  Controlled
substance  means  any  ""controlled  substance""  as  defined  in  21  U.S.C.  802.
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any
of the behaviors listed above.
Marijuana,  hallucinogenic  mushrooms,  amphetamines,  cocaine,  heroin,  non-
prescribed  drugs,  heroin,  and  opium  are  “controlled  substances” listed  on  Schedules I
through V of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 812 (c).
AG  ¶  25  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be
disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and
(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including…purchase.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.i alleged Applicant’s years of a pattern of using (for heroin
and  marijuana  also  purchasing)  the  federally  controlled  drugs  listed  above.  He
unequivocally admitted those allegations.
Facts admitted by an applicant in an Answer to a SOR require s no further proof
from  the  Government.  ISCR  Case  No.  94-1159  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  4,  1995)  (“any
admissions [applicant] made to the SOR allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of
its burden of proof”); and Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (“[a]n
applicant’s  admissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal basis for an
Administrative  Judge’s  findings”).  Applicant  admitted  facts  that  trigger  disqualifying
conditions AG ¶¶ 25(a) through (c).
The  next  inquiry is whether Applicant’s  illegal drug use has been mitigated, The
following three mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 26: for drug involvement and substance
abuse may potentially apply:
(a)  the   behavior  happened   so   long   ago,  was  so   infrequent,  or  happened
under  such   circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely   to   recur  or  does  not  cast
doubt  on   the   individual’s  current  reliability,   trustworthiness,  or  good
judgment;
(b)  the  individual acknowledges  .  .  .  his drug  involvement and  substance
misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,
and has established a pattern of abstinence . . . ; and
(c)  abuse  of  prescription  drugs  was  after  a  severe  or  prolonged  illness
during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended.
I considered mitigating condition  AG ¶  26(a). Applicant’s  illegal use of a host of
drugs began in 2004 (marijuana). Although that is quite a while ago, it not only continued,
it  ultimately  branched  out  to  his  illegal  use  of  five  other  drugs.  That  train  of  usage  only
ended when for health and wellness reasons he decided to stop on his own in February
2020. Even so, the record shows that he continued to use marijuana until July 2020. His
2013 charge and conviction of possession of drug paraphernalia was just another episode
in what would continue to be a history of drug use. His decades of illegal drug use is not
mitigated under AG ¶ 26(a).
I considered mitigating condition AG ¶ 26(b). During the clearance investigation,
Applicant was completely forthright in detailing his long history of illegal drug use, thereby
satisfying the initial element of this mitigating condition. What is lacking, however, is any
evidence of his actions to overcome his problem, other than his word that he decided in
2020 (February or July) to cease illegal drug usage. This mitigating condition also requires
an applicant to show “a  pattern of abstinence.” After nearly 20 years of illegal drug use,
three years of abstinence is hardly a sufficient pattern of abstinence. His illegal drug use is
not mitigated under AG ¶ 26(b).
I considered mitigating condition AG ¶ 26(c). The record shows only that Applicant
had, for a time, a prescription for Adderall. After that expired, he accepted the drug from a
friend who had a prescription for that medication. Applicant’s misuse of that medication is
not mitigated by AG ¶ 26(c).
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
Under Guideline  E  for personal conduct,  the  concern is that “[c]onduct  involving
questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules
and regulations can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and
ability  to  protect  classified  or sensitive  information.”  AG  ¶  15.  More  specifically,  AG ¶
16(c) provides the following disqualifying condition:
credible  adverse  information  in  several  adjudicative  issue  areas
that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other
single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports
judgment,
a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable
untrustworthiness,  unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to
comply  with  rules  and  regulations,  or  other  characteristics
indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified
or sensitive information.
In this case, the SOR made two allegations under Guideline E. The first was that
in 2010 or 2011 during a drug test administrated by his employer, Applicant fraudulently
submitted someone else’s urine in place of his own. The second was that in about 2018
he was terminated from his employment for testing positive for illegal drugs. He admitted
those allegations. His admitted conduct triggers disqualifying condition AG ¶ 16(c).
I  have  reviewed  the  entire  record  and  the  seven  mitigating  conditions  in  AG  ¶¶
17(a) through (g). There are no facts that would support any of those mitigating conditions.
Whole-Person Concept
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance
must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful  consideration  of  the
guidelines  and  the  whole-person  concept.  AG  ¶¶  2(a)  and  (d)(1)-(9)  (explaining  the
“whole-person” concept and factors).  In my analysis above, I considered the potentially
disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  and  the  whole-person  concept  in  light  of  all  the
facts and circumstances surrounding this case.
Applicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security
clearance.  For  these  reasons,  I  conclude  that  Applicant  has  not  mitigated  the  security
concerns  arising  under  Guideline  H,  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,  and
Guideline E, personal conduct.
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs  1.a  –  1.i:
Against Applicant
Paragraph  2, (Personal Conduct)
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 2.a  –  2.b:
Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the
interests  of  national  security  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted using marijuana, but she denied
the allegation in part, denying that her prior legal use of medical marijuana “is any way
indicative of [her] ability to serve the national interest  in trustworthiness and  reliability.”
Her partial admission is incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old cybersecurity penetration tester employed by a defense
contractor since January 2022. She received an associate degree in September 2015, a
bachelor’s degree in August 2017, and  a master’s degree in August 2021. She married
in September 2017. She has never held a security clearance.
Applicant disclosed her marijuana use in her SCA. She disclosed that she used it
experimentally  once  in  2013,  abstained  until  2019,  used  it  both  recreationally  and
medically about seven times from 2019 to August 2021, and had abstained from about
August 2021 until April 2022. She stated that she intended to use it in the future, especially
in  legal  jurisdictions  permissible  by  ongoing  progressive  federal  and  state  cannabis
legislation  and  regulations.”  She  explained,  “When  the  controlled  substance  is  not
abused, there are numerous medical benefits for [her] dietary conditions . . . as well as
occasional stress-relief alternative benefits.”
When  Applicant was interviewed  by a  security  investigator in May 2022, she  stated
that she  did  not plan  to  continue  her marijuana  use  unless it becomes “federally legal”
and   she   received   a   medical  prescription   for  health   reasons.  (FORM   Item   5   at   5)  In
response   to   DOHA  interrogatories  on   May  4,  2023,  she   declined   to   provide   a   signed
statement  of  intent   to   abstain   from   all   drug   involvement  and   substance   misuse   and   to
acknowledge  that any future involvement or misuse  is grounds for revocation  of national
security eligibility.  (FORM  Item  5  at 11)  In  her response  to  the  FORM, she  submitted  a
copy of her state-issued  medical marijuana  card and  asked  for a  waiver, based  on  her
recent diagnosis of exocrine  pancreatic insufficiency and  fibromyalgia, and  promising  that
her use of cannabis would be strictly medical and not recreational. (AX A)

that he shared with the marijuana-smoking roommate and executed an affidavit expressing
his intent never to use marijuana again. (Item 2 at 2)
Applicant falsified a  security clearance application, completed in 2021, when he
failed to disclose his marijuana use and the fact that he used marijuana while possessing a
security clearance. (Item 2 at 1) In his SOR answer, he contends that he did not disclose
the marijuana use on his application because he did not remember the instances when he
used  it.  (Item  1  at  2)  During  an  investigative  interview  in  January  2022,  he  told  the
investigative  agent  that  he  did  not  disclose  the  marijuana  on  the  security  clearance
application because he thought he was only required to disclose hard drugs like heroin or

"Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana between May
2017 and April 2022 (SOR 1.a); and that he used marijuana after being granted a security
clearance in approximately March 2007 (SOR 1.b). (FORM, Item 1)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  made  false
statements of relevant and material facts to the government by failing to disclose his illegal
drug  use  as  required  by  e-QIPs  he  submitted  in  September  2006  (SOR  2.a)  and  in
January 2017 (SOR 2.b). Additionally, it was alleged he made false statements of relevant
and  material  facts  to  the  government  by  failing  to  disclose  his  illegal  drug  use  while
possessing a security clearance as required by his January 2017 e-QIP (SOR 2.c). The
SOR also cross-alleged as disqualifying personal conduct the illegal drug use addressed
in SOR 1.a and 1.b (SOR 2.d). (FORM, Item 1)
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  with
explanations. A review of his response to the allegations of intentional false statements,
he  also expressly denied  that he  “intended  to  make  false claims or falsify documents.”
(FORM, Item 2) Accordingly, I have interpreted his response as a denial of SOR 2.a, 2.b,
and 2.c. As such, those allegations presented controverted issues of fact and the burden
of  proof  for  those  facts  remained  with  the  Government.  (See  Directive  at  E3.1.14)  In
addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions to the remaining allegations,
and based on my review of the information presented in the FORM and AE A, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor  located  in  State  A,
where he has lived since September 2005. He has worked for that employer since August
2006. He graduated from high school in 2001 and received a college degree in May 2005.
He and his wife have been together since about 2003 and married in 2013. They have
two children under ten years old. (FORM, Item 3)
Applicant has held at least a secret-level security clearance for his entire tenure
with his current employer. He submitted an e-QIP in September 2006 to obtain eligibility
for a security clearance when he was first hired. He submitted another e-QIP in January
2017 to renew his eligibility. The e-QIP he submitted in March 2022 appears to have been
intended  to  qualify  him  for  a  top  secret-level  clearance.  In  response  to  the  FORM,
Applicant indicated he no longer requires eligibility at the top-secret level. (FORM, Items
3 – 5, 7; AE A).
Applicant first used marijuana in high school. He used it once in May 2001 and did
not  use  it  again  until  2009.  In  2009,  his  then  girlfriend  and  future  wife  was  receiving
chemotherapy as part of her cancer treatment. At the time, it was legal in State A to use
marijuana with a medical prescription, which she was given to help her tolerate the effects
of her cancer treatments. Applicant started using some of her medical marijuana with her
to help him cope with the stress of their situation. It was still illegal in State A for him to
do so at that time. (FORM, Items 2, 3 and 6; AE A)
In  November  2016,  State  A  legalized  the  personal  possession  and  use  of
marijuana  for  persons  over  21  years  of  age.  Subsequently,  Applicant  began  using
marijuana a few times monthly to alleviate back pain and other aches and pains he was
experiencing. (FORM, Items 2, 3 and 6; AE A)
On  April 21  and  May 11, 2022, Applicant completed  personal subject interviews
(PSI) with  a  government investigator as part of his current background  investigation. In
his April PSI,  he  affirmed  his intent  to  continue  using  marijuana  because  it  is legal in  State
A.  In   his  May   PSI,  he   was   confronted   with   the   fact   that   the   use   and   possession   of
marijuana  are still  illegal under  federal law, and  that as  a  federal  contractor  he  is required
to  follow federal law.  He  claimed  that  he  had  not been  made  aware  by his company of the
need  to  follow  federal laws regarding  marijuana  but stated  he  would  seek advice from  his
employer. (FORM, Item 6)
I take  administrative  notice  of  the  fact  that the  psychoactive  ingredient of  marijuana
is  tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC),  a   federally  controlled   substance,  the   unauthorized
possession  and  use  of  which  are  criminal violations  of  the  Controlled  Substances  Act,  21
U.S.C. §  802  et seq.  During  his May  PSI, he  acknowledged  his understanding  that  use  of
marijuana  is still  a  violation  of federal criminal law. Guidance  issued  by the  Office  of the
Assistant  Secretary  of   Defense   (OASD)   in  February  2013,  which   was  updated   by  the
Director of National Intelligence  (DNI) in December 2021, makes clear that changes  in
the   laws  pertaining   to   marijuana   by  the   various  states,  territories,   and   the   District  of
Columbia   do   not   alter   the   current  National  Security  Adjudicative   Guidelines.  Because
federal  law supersedes state  laws on  this issue, Applicant’s use  of marijuana, regardless
of  location   or  even   medical  justification   in  his  state   of  residence,  was  illegal.  Further,
federal workplaces prohibit illegal drug  use  by  civilian  federal employees and  by persons
employed for work on federal contracts.
Applicant has not used marijuana since April 2022. In his response to being asked
through DOHA interrogatories why he stopped, he stated:
I realized  I  was  making  a  mistake  and  that  federal  laws need  to  be  held  in
higher regard than  my  local state  laws.  I chose  to  find  another  method  for
pain relief that follows all  federal laws. My career is important to  me,  and  I
do   not  want  to   do   anything   to   jeopardize   that,   especially  not  when   other
means of pain relief are readily available. (FORM, Item 6)
When  Applicant  was  hired  by  his  employer  in  2006,  he  was  administered  a
urinalysis drug test, which he presumably passed. Thereafter, he submitted an e-QIP to
obtain  a  secret-level  security  clearance.  He  did  not  disclose  in  that  application,  as
required by questions in e-QIP Section 24 (Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity),
that  he  had  used  marijuana  in  high  school.  He  subsequently  received  a  security
clearance. (FORM, Items 5 and 7)
Applicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  was  renewed  in  2017
based, in part, on the information he submitted in a second e-QIP on January 11, 2017.
In that e-QIP, he again did not disclose his use of marijuana as required by questions in
Section  23  (Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity).  By  this  time,  he  had  been  using
marijuana with his wife since 2009 and once it became legal in late 2016, he was using it
several times a month. It was not until he submitted his most recent e-QIP in March 2022,
that  he  responded  “yes”  to  Section  23  questions,  thereby  disclosing  that  he  used
marijuana as discussed herein, above. (FORM, Items 3 – 5)
In response to the SOR, Applicant stated he “was a young kid who made a stupid
mistake”  in  omitting  his  drug  use  from  the  first  e-QIP.  He  also  stated  that  he  made
mistakes by completing the form too quickly. As to his second e-QIP, he stated he did not
think he needed to change any of the pre-populated information from his first e-QIP and
that he probably rushed his completion of that form as well. However,  in his second e-
QIP, he took enough time to provide new information about his passport, his residences,
personal  references,  his  marital  status,  foreign  travel,  and  his  prior  background
investigation. In response to the FORM, he admitted that he was “scared of what might
happen if [he] told the truth” when  he  submitted  his first e-QIP, and that he wishes he
“had been strong enough to be honest.” As to his second e-QIP, he avers he “failed to do
[his] due diligence 10 years later.” (FORM, Items 2, 4 and 5; AE A)
In response to the FORM, Applicant also provided a signed statement stating he
intends to abstain from all illegal drug use in the future, and with the understanding that
any future use could result in the loss of his security clearance. He further described his
efforts (e.g., yoga, exercise, dietary changes) at alternative pain and stress relief. His wife
provided a statement to the effect that she believes Applicant is “100% honest,” and she
corroborated the lifestyle changes he has made. (AE A)
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1997 and a master’s
degree in 2010. He married in 2008 and has no children. He began work for a federal
contractor in September 2022. (Item 4)
In September 2022, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).
In response to Section 23 about any illegal drug use in the last seven years, he responded
that he possessed a medical marijuana card issued to him by his state. He stated that he
periodically consumes “1/8 ML of CBD oil which contains the cannabinoid THC. The dose
of CBD/THC is less than 5 mg.” He takes this dose three to five times a week at bedtime.
He takes it for ailments related to his disability. He obtains the drug from a dispensary in
his  state.  He  stated  that  he  answered  “yes”  to  the  question  about  illegally  purchasing
drugs  because  he  believed  purchasing  Tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC)  from  a  state
dispensary is still considered illegal under federal law. He is aware that his use of THC is
legal  under  his  state’s  law  but  is  illegal  under  federal  law.  He  renewed  his  medical
marijuana card in May 2022. He indicated on his SCA that he intended to use this drug in
the future as prescribed by his doctor. (Item 4)
In  October  2022,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  He
disclosed to the investigator that he was prescribed medical marijuana by his doctor. His
appointments were online, and he will have annual appointments. His last appointment
was May 2022. He planned to continue to purchase and use medical marijuana. He used
it at home and around his spouse. He used it to help control anxiety and to help him sleep.
He has not participated in drug counseling or drug treatment. He has not been diagnosed
for drug abuse or dependency. He did not use any other illegal drugs to include the misuse
of prescription drugs. He did not associate with individuals who use drugs illegally. His
spouse and friends were aware he uses medical marijuana. His did not believe his use of
medical marijuana has contributed to any personal, financial, criminal, legal, security or
disciplinary  issues.  He  had  not  used  any  other  illegal  drugs  other  than  the  medical
marijuana.  He  planned  to  continue  to  use  medical  marijuana  until  another  course  of
treatment is prescribed. (Item 5)
In Applicant’s SOR answer, he admitted his use and purchase of THC with varying
degrees  from  May  2021  to  the  present  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b).  He  reaffirmed  that  he
intended to continue  using  CBD oil that  contains  THC that he  was prescribed  until his
doctor recommends another course of treatment (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant did not respond
to the FORM, so no new information was provided.1

"Applicant is 26 years old.  He has a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering
and  a  minor  in  Mathematics.  He  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  Project
Manager.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant has an extensive history of purchasing and using illegal drugs including
marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), and
the  use  of  prescription  drugs  not  prescribed  to  him  include  Adderall,  Vyvanse,
Tramadol, Vicodin and Xanax.  Applicant was hired by his current employer on July 8,
2021.  He  submitted  his  application  for  a  security  clearance  in  May  2022.  Applicant
admitted  to  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR  except  allegation  1.i.,
concerning the sale of marijuana.
1.a. and 1.b.   Applicant  attended  college  from  August  2015  to  December  2020.  He
stated  that  he  started  using  marijuana  in  college,  in  July  2015,  and  continued  using  it
until March 2022, consuming it about five to seven times a week.  (Tr. p. 38.)  Given the
seven years he has used marijuana, he admits to using it over 1,000 times.  (Tr. p. 63.)
He  would  normally  use  it  in  social  settings  with  his  friends.  During  the  years  he  used
marijuana he also purchased it about once or twice a month to supply his habit.  (Tr. p.
43.)
In  July  2021,  Applicant  began  working  for  a  defense  contractor  in  a  sensitive
position.  He continued to use marijuana while holding a sensitive position until at least
March  2022,  in  total  disregard  for his  security  responsibilities.  Applicant  testified  from
his  personal  knowledge  that  there  are  people  at  his  company  who  use  marijuana  and
who  hold  security  clearances.  Applicant  provided  the  names  of  two  of  these
employees.  (Tr. p.  72.)  He  mentioned  that there  are others,  but  he  has  only  learned
about them through the grapevine.
Applicant  stated  that  he  last  used  marijuana  in  March  2022.  He  stated  that  he
stopped  using  it  because  he  became  aware  of  its  potential  security  implications  and
because he wanted to change his lifestyle.
1.c.  and  1.d.   Applicant has used and purchased cocaine nine times from about 2015 to
April  2021.  He used cocaine in social  settings  with  his friends.  He  stated that he  did
not enjoy it.  He also used and purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms three times from
September  2016  to  about  March  2021.  He  did  not  particularly  enjoy  this  experience
either.  (Tr. p. 47-48.)
1.e.   Applicant  has  used  and  purchased  prescription  medications,  namely  Adderall
and  Vyvanse  not  prescribed  to  him,  from  about  August  2016  to  November  2018.  He
explained that he used it as a study aid.  He would usually use these drugs with friends
in his study group.
1.f.   Applicant used Tramadol on one occasion in October 2017.  He remembers that
he  had  pain  from  a  laceration  on  his  hand.  His  sister  had  a  pill  left  over  from  her
wisdom tooth removal, and she gave it to him.
1.g.   Applicant  used  Vicodin  on  one  occasion  in  about  July  2018.  He  suffered  a
hamstring injury while playing intramural football and a friend offered his Vicodin to him.
1.h.   Applicant  used  and  purchased  Lysergic  Acid  Diethylamide  (LSD)  on  two
occasions, once in March 2017, and again in May 2017.  He acknowledges that he was
young and naïve at the time.  He was outdoors in a nature setting or going on a hike at
the time he used it.  He stated that he did not really enjoy it, and he understood the risks
associated with the drug.
1.i.
Applicant  denied  that  he  ever  sold  marijuana.  However,  he  admitted  that  in
2017, on one occasion, he was the middleman responsible for taking the marijuana to a
friend of his, and then returning the money to another friend who owned the marijuana.
(Tr. p. 55-56.)  Applicant stated that he did not receive any money for his efforts.
Applicant used and purchased Xanax not prescribed to him on two occasions in
1.j.
about August 2015.
Applicant admitted  that he  made  a  knowing  and  conscious decision  to  use  these
drugs  when   he   did  so,  and   he   knew  that   he   was  violating   both   state   and   Federal   law
when   he   used   marijuana,  cocaine,  LSD,  and   hallucinogenic   mushrooms.     (Tr.   pp.  63-
66.)
Letters  of  recommendation
from  Applicant’s  Senior  Manager  and  other
professional  colleagues,  including  a  roommate,  attest  to  Applicant’s  high  level  of
maturity  and  job  responsibility.  Applicant  is  considered  to  be  a  highly  driven
professional  and  the  go-to  person  as  an  expert  in  certain  areas  as  an  Engineer  and
Data Analyst.  Applicant’s good character, work ethic, and commitment to the principles
of integrity and confidentiality are noted.  However, only one individual who provided a
letter  of  recommendation  for  Applicant  makes  any  reference  to  being  aware  of
Applicant’s  history  of  illegal  drug  use,  and  characterizes  it  as  occurring  prior  to  his
employment with the company, which is not accurate.  Applicant testified that he did not
show the SOR to any of those who submitted letters on his behalf, and although he only
verbally  discussed  some  of  the  allegations  with  them,  he  did  not  provide  them  with
specifics.  Applicant testified that his Senior Manager, who has supported him, told the
security officer that if Applicant were to be denied his security clearance, steps would be
taken to keep him on the program.  (Tr. p. 75, and Applicant’s Exhibits E and I.)
Hair Drug Test results dated March 1, 2023; March 24, 2023; May 11, 2023; and
June 8, 2023, were negative.  (Applicant’s Exhibits B and H.)
Applicant  submitted  a  statement  of  intent  dated  March  23,  2023,  declaring  that
he will never misuse substances in the future.  He stated that he plans to abstain from
all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse  and  acknowledges  that  any  future
involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  national  security  eligibility.
(Applicant’s Exhibit C.)
Notes  concerning  Applicant’s  performance  appraisals  indicate  that  he  was  an
excellent  performer  in  2021,  and  that  he  continues  to  be  impressive,  showing
outstanding  job  performance.  He  is  described  as  a  hard  worker  whose  skill  and
diligence has helped to make the projects successful.  He continues to be an extremely
valuable  member  of  the  team  as  he  continues  to  expand  his  knowledge  and
understanding of various aspects of his job responsibilities.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)

"The SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana in November 2020 (SOR ¶ 2.a),
that he falsified his SCA by failing to disclose his marijuana use (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that he
failed to disclose his marijuana use during an interview with a security investigator in May
2021 (SOR ¶ 1.b). In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR
¶¶ 1.a and 1.b but denied intentional falsification. His explanation of his conduct alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b amounts to a denial. His admission of the marijuana use alleged
in SOR ¶ 2.a is incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old security administrator employed by a defense contractor
since February 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from June 2011
to February 2015 and received an honorable discharge. He served in the inactive ready
reserve  from  February  2015  to  June  2018  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.  He
received a bachelor’s degree in May 2020. He is unmarried and has no children. His SCA
reflects that he received a security clearance in September 2012, while he was on active
duty  in  the  Marine  Corps,  and  again  in  November  2020,  while  employed  by  a  federal
contractor.
Applicant consumed two marijuana edibles in November 2020 after his roommate
suggested using them as a sleep aid. He was unhappy with his job and was considering
looking for non-federal employment. He submitted applications for several jobs, but his
applications  were  not  accepted  because  of  COVID.  He  was  stressed  about  finding
suitable employment and unable to sleep. He had tried melatonin without success. His
roommate suggested marijuana edibles and gave him two of them that were purchased
from a legal dispensary. They did not work, and he experienced a panic attack after taking
the second edible.
Applicant  changed  his  mind  about  leaving  federal  employment  when  he  was
offered a job by his current employer. He submitted an SCA in March 2021, but he did
not disclose his marijuana use. (FORM Item 3)
Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2021. The summary of
the May 2021 interview reflects that he was questioned about his college education, his
previous  employments,  his  military  service,  and  an  unusual  financial  transaction.
However, the summary does not reflect that he was asked about any drug involvement.
(FORM Item 4 at 10-11)
Applicant was interviewed again in November 2022. He told the investigator that
he self-reported his marijuana use in September 2022, after his roommate reminded him
of the panic attack he experienced after using it. (FORM Item 4 at 14)
In  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  May  2023,  Applicant  stated  that  the
summary of the  November 2022 was incorrect and that he  self-reported his marijuana
use in November 2021, not September 2022. (FORM Item 4 at 4) He also submitted a
statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,
acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse would be grounds for revocation of
his national security eligibility. (FORM Item 4 at 9)

"In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c,
2.b, and 2.c; and denied allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 2.a. Applicant’s admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is 23 years old. Born in Ghana, he arrived in the United States with his
parents in 2006 at the age of six. He attended schools in the United States and became
a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2016 at age 16.
Applicant received his high school diploma in May 2018. He attended an out-of-
state college after graduation from May 2018 to about December 2019, until he withdrew
from school as a result of the arrest alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c discussed below. In January
2020, he enrolled in a different college. In May 2023, he was awarded a bachelor’s degree
in business management and information systems. Applicant has never been married and
has no children. (GE 1; and Tr. 17-20)
Since  August  2022,  Applicant  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  as  an
administrative  support  technician.  His  duties  involve  work  accomplished  on  a  federal
installation. He previously held an interim secret security clearance, which was removed
when  he  did  not  initially  clear.  In  November 2023,  he  was  placed  in  an  administrative
leave status pending the outcome of this adjudication process. (Tr. 17-20)
Applicant was raised in State 1. In October 2019, while attending a college in State
2, he  was  arrested  by campus police  for possession of marijuana  after marijuana  was
found  in  his  dorm  room.  His  arrest  was  then  processed  by  local  police,  and  he  later
appeared in court. Applicant testified that all charges were subsequently dropped. (GE 1
and  GE 2; and Tr. 17-33)
As a result of the arrest, however, Applicant faced discipline from college officials.
He testified he was given the option to either leave the university voluntarily within a week,
or  risk  defending  himself  before  a  college  disciplinary  board  where  he  faced  formal
expulsion and an unfavorable student record. He chose the former and signed a voluntary
permanent separation from the college in November 2019. As a result, he was banned
from all campuses and unable to re-enroll. (GE 2 at 8; Tr. 26-30) As discussed above,
Applicant soon enrolled in college elsewhere, and eventually earned his degree.
When  Applicant  submitted  his May  2022  SCA, he  did not disclose  any prior drug
involvement; nor did  he  disclose  his 2019  arrest  for marijuana  possession. Specifically,
he  answered  “no” in  response  to  two  questions in Section  23, Illegal Use of  Drugs  or Drug
Activity, which  asked  whether, in the  last seven  years, Applicant  had: (1) illegally used
any drugs or controlled  substances;  and  (2) illegally purchased, received, handled, etc.,
any drug  or controlled   substance.   He   also   answered   “no”  in   response   to  a   question   in
Section   22,  Police   Record,  which   asked   whether   he   had   ever  been   charged   with   an
offense involving  alcohol or drugs.  (GE 1  pp. 27-29)  (SOR ¶¶  1.c, and  2.a  - 2.c)
In  Applicant’s  June  2022  interview  with  DOD  investigators,  authenticated  in
October 2022, he disclosed he first used marijuana in May 2018, and that he last used it
in June 2022, prior to his DOD interview. He also disclosed he acquired the marijuana by
either purchasing it from multiple dealers or receiving it as a gift from others. (GE 2 at 10;
Tr. at 26) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a  and 1.b)
In the hearing Applicant testified he subsequently used marijuana twice after his
June  2022  background  interview:  in  October  2022  before  completing  his  response  to
interrogatories; and in December 2022. This last use he stated was due to the depression
and sadness he felt after the death of his grandmother with whom he enjoyed a close
relationship. His December 2022 marijuana use occurred after the issuance date of the
SOR, November 9, 2022, though it is unclear if Applicant actually received it beforehand.
He testified that December 2022 was the last time he used marijuana, and that he has no
future intent to use it. (Tr. 23-29, 40-45)
During the hearing, Applicant admitted he deliberately falsified his answers to the
above  SCA  questions  because  he  was  concerned  that  admitting  his  illegal  drug
involvement, including his drug use, purchase, and his drug-related arrest for possession
of illegal drugs would hinder his ability to obtain a security clearance. He also testified his
employer has a drug-free workplace policy, and that he signed an agreement not to use
illegal drugs. (Tr. 18-19, 28, 35-36)
Applicant  testified  he  made  the  decision  to  “do  better”  after  his  grandmother
passed away. His grandmother’s passing and his current job motivated him to graduate
from college and to stop using marijuana. He discussed his feelings of depression with
his medical doctor, but was never clinically diagnosed with depression. He also disclosed
his use of marijuana to his doctor, but stated he was never prescribed medical marijuana.
He  used  marijuana  primarily  for  recreational  purposes.  (Tr.  32-34,  41-45)  Applicant
submitted two supplemental documents: a personal statement, and a copy of his job offer
from a federal agency, both of which were considered in this case. (AE A and AE B)

previously  held  a  security  clearance  while  on  active  duty.  He  was  separated  with  an
Under  Honorable  Conditions  (General)  discharge.  He  has  some  college  credit  but  no
degree. He is single and has no children. (Tr. 17-18, 33-35; GE 1; GE 3)
(Note: Some details were excluded to protect the privacy of Applicant and other
individuals  named  in  the  record.  Specific  information  is  available  in  the  cited  exhibits
and transcript.)
On  September  20,  2021,  Applicant  completed  an  electronic  questionnaire  for
investigations  processing  (e-QIP)  in  order  to  apply  for  a  security  clearance.  (GE  1)  A
subsequent background investigation raised the security concerns listed in the SOR.
Under  the  Guideline  H  - Drug  Involvement  security  concern,  the  SOR  alleged
Applicant:  used  the  prescription  drug  Xanax  on  or  around  June  2020,  even  though  it
was  not  prescribed  to  him.  (SOR  ¶  1.a:  Gov  2  at  5,  8);  from  about  January  2016  to
about December 2017, used cocaine with varying frequency (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 2 at 6-7);
and  from  about  January  2016  to  December  2016,  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency.  (SOR  ¶  1.c:  Gov  2  at  6)  All  three  allegations  allege  Applicant’s  drug  use
occurred after being granted access to classified information.
Under  the  personal  conduct  security  concern,  the  SOR  alleged:  Applicant
obstructed  justice  in  about  June  2020,  by  purposefully  removing  trash  from  the
dormitory room of an Airman who died of an accidental drug overdose with the intent to
conceal  evidence  of  his  illegal  drug  use.  (SOR  ¶  2.a:  Gov  2  at  5-6);  and  he  was
discharged  from  the  United  States  Air  Force  in  May  2021  for  misconduct:  drug  abuse
and  obstruction  of  justice,  receiving  an  Under  Honorable  Conditions  (General)
Discharge. (SOR ¶ 2.b:  Gov 2 at 4; Gov 3)
The criminal conduct concern alleged in April 2021, Applicant was convicted by
Summary Courts-Martial for violations of Article 112a, Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ),  wrongful  use  of  controlled  substances,  specifically,  Xanax,  cocaine,  and
marijuana  and  a  violation  of  Article  131b  of  the  UCMJ,  obstruction  of  justice.  He  was
sentenced  to  30  days  confinement,  reduction  to  the  rate  of  E-1,  and  issued  a  formal
written reprimand. (SOR ¶ 3.a: Gov 4)
Guideline H  - Drug  Involvement
In  November  2016,  while  Applicant  was  on  active  duty  in  the  United  States  Air
Force,  he  and  another  airman  went  on  leave  to  Amsterdam,  Netherlands.  Applicant
purchased  marijuana  from  a  shop  for  his  personal  use  and  smoked  the  marijuana
during  this  trip.  His  friend  did  not  use  the  marijuana  with  him.  Later  that  evening,
Applicant  was  approached  by  a  stranger  who  offered  to  sell him cocaine.  He  paid  the
stranger  70  Euros  for  cocaine  and  took  the  cocaine  back  to  his  hotel  room  where  he
used the cocaine by himself. He was drunk when he purchased the cocaine. (Tr. 19-21;
GE 2 at 7; GE 5 at 14)
In  July 2017, Applicant traveled  to  Spain with  three  friends who  were also in the
Air  Force.  When  they  were  at  the  airport,  someone  offered  to  give  them  a  ride  to  their
hotel.   During   the   ride,   Applicant  was offered   cocaine.  He purchased   some   cocaine   for
70 Euros. He used the cocaine  by himself in  his hotel room. (Tr. 19-20; GE 1; GE 2 at 7-
8; GE 5  at 14)
On  May  31,  2020,  Applicant  and  Airman  X  used  illegally  purchased  Xanax
together. Amn X offered him a Xanax pill and he took one. This is the only time he used
Xanax.  He  did  not  have  a  prescription  for  Xanax.  He  was  drinking  at  the  time  and
considers it a poor judgment call. (Tr. 20-21; GE 2 at 5-6, 8; GE 5 at 4, 14-15)
Applicant admits he was on active duty in the Air Force when he used the above
illegal drugs. He admits to holding a security clearance while serving on active duty  in
the Air Force. He admits he served in national security sensitive position while on active
duty  in  the  Air  Force  and  that  his  illegal  drug  use  described  above  occurred  while  he
held a security clearance and served in a national security sensitive position. (Tr. 19-21)
Applicant testified that the last time he used illegal drugs was on May 31, 2020.
(Tr. 20-21, 35)  He listed his illegal drug use on his e-QIP application dated September
20,  2021,  in  response  to  Section  23  –  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity.  He  also
listed  he  used  marijuana  on  approximately  ten  occasions  during  high  school  and
discussed  his  high  school  marijuana  use  during  his  December  2021  background
investigation interview. (GE 1 at 35-38; GE 2 at 7-8)
Applicant  never  attended  drug  counseling  or  treatment.  He  has  never  been
diagnosed  as  being  dependent  on  drugs.  He  has  no  future  intentions  of  using  illegal
drugs. (GE 2 at 8) He did not offer a signed, sworn statement of intent to abstain from
all drug involvement and substance misuse,  acknowledging that any future involvement
or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.
Personal Conduct
On June 2, 2020, around 11:30 pm Applicant went to Amn X’s dorm room. When
he arrived, he observed Amn X sitting in a recliner with several lines of a white powdery
substance on his iPad.  Amn X used his CAC card to cut the powdery substance. Amn
X  then  sniffed  several  lines  of  the  white  powdery  substance.  Applicant  claims  he
confronted Amn X saying: “Are you serious right now, you told me you were done with
that.” Amn X replied, “I‘m going to finish it up.” They started watching a television show.
Amn  X  fell  asleep  and  began  snoring.  Approximately  20  minutes  later,  he  began  to
wheeze  loudly  and  sounded  like  he  could  not  breathe.  Applicant  approached  him  and
attempted  to  wake  him  by  tapping  his  chest  and  smacking  his  face.  At  one  point,  he
rubbed an ice cube on Amn X’s face. He still did not wake up. Applicant saw Amn X’s
lips turn blue, purple and black. He placed his fingers on Amn X’s neck and noticed that
his  heart  was  racing  and  foam  began  to  come  out  of  his mouth.  Applicant  considered
calling 911 or his mother, but panicked and chose to leave. (Tr. 25-32; GE 5 at 4, 14-16)
Before  Applicant  left,  he  noticed  Amn  X’s  iPad  had  a  line  of  the  white  powdery
substance on it and Amn X’s CAC card was near the iPad. He picked up the iPad and
dumped  the  white  powdery  substance  into  a  sink  and  washed  it  down  the  drain.  He
wiped  the  iPad  and  the  CAC  card  with  a  towel  in  order to  remove  his fingerprints.  He
also  removed  his  garbage  from  the  room  to  include  a  water  bottle  and  tobacco  in  an
attempt  to  eliminate  his  presence  in  Amn  X’s  room.  He  left  and  drove  home.  While
driving home, he called Amn X and left a message stating that he had fallen asleep and
to call him. He later deleted all content form his phone before the OSI confiscated it. (Tr.
21; GE 5 at  16)
The next day, June 3, 2020, Applicant attempted to call Amn X around 1130. He
did not answer his phone. Applicant felt terrible because he did not help Amn X when he
overdosed. He was selfish and was scared he could get into trouble for letting Amn X
use narcotics. Applicant called another friend, Amn Z, who went to check on Amn X. He
saw  that  Amn  X  was  sitting  still  in  his  recliner  in  the  window  and  looked  pale.  He
contacted his chain of command. They obtained a master key and went into Amm X’ s
room. They discovered Amn X sitting on his recliner. He was deceased. (GE 5 at 16)
Later that day, special agents from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
(AFOSI)  interviewed  Applicant  about  Amn  X.  They  were  told  during  their  initial
investigation  that  Applicant  and  Amn  X  were  good  friends  and  co-workers.  Applicant
was initially evasive during the interview. He mentioned that he went to Amn X’s  room
the  evening  of  June  2,  2020.  Amn  X  appeared  fine.  They  were  watching  a  television
show.  Amn  X  fell  asleep  and  then  Applicant  went  home.  The  next  day  he  tried  to  call
Amn X and he would not answer. He called his friend Amn Z and asked him to check on
Amn  X.  Amn  Z  observed  Amn  X  through  the  window  and  observed  that  he  appeared
dead. (AE 5 at 13)
Applicant  told  AFOSI  that  he  usually  communicated  with  Amn  X  via  text
messages,  but  would  not  consent  to  AFOSI’s  request  to  search  his  cell  phone.  After
being  confronted  about  the  importance  of  getting  detailed  information  about  Amn  X’s
death  for  his  family.  Applicant  admitted  he  and  deceased  used  illegally  purchased
Xanax together on  May  31,  2020.  Applicant was  then  read his rights  under Article  31,
UCMJ.  He  waived  his  right  to  legal  counsel  and  elected  to  answer  questions.  He
admitted to his illegal purchase and use of marijuana and cocaine while on active duty
in the military and provided the full details of what occurred on the night of June 2, 2020.
(GE 5 at 14-16)
A search of the Amn X’s iPhone revealed texts from Applicant. On June 3, 2020,
Applicant  was  escorted  by  AFOSI  to  have  his  blood  and  urine  tested  pursuant  to  a
search  warrant.  While  driving  to  the  hospital,  Applicant  stated,  “I  watched  [Amn  X]
overdose  and  I  ran  away  like  a  coward.”  An  autopsy  was  performed  on  Amn  X.  His
cause  of  death  was  accidental  mixed  drug  intoxication.  He  had  cocaine,  fentanyl  and
Xanax  in  his body  at  the  time  of his  death.  (GE  2  at  6;  GE  5 at  46)  Applicant’s  urine
tested negative for illegal drugs. (GE 5 at 42)
The SOR also alleged Applicant was discharged in May 2021  from the  U.S. Air
Force  with  a  discharge  characterized  as  General  Discharge  (Under  Honorable
Conditions)  for  misconduct  involving  drug  abuse  and  obstruction  of  justice.  The  SOR
allegation  cross  –  referenced  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  -1c,  and  2.a.  Applicant’s  DD  Form  214
for  Misconduct  –  Drug  Abuse.  The  discharge
indicated  he  was  discharged
characterization was Under Honorable Conditions – (General).(Tr. 33-34; GE 2 at 5; GE

Criminal Conduct
On  April  13,  2021,  Applicant  pled  and  was  found  guilty  by  Summary  Courts-
Martial  of  the  following  criminal  offenses  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice
(UCMJ)  Charge  1:  Violation  of  Article  112a,  wrongfully  using  controlled  substances
including  cocaine,  and  marijuana  on  divers  occasions  between  January  1,  2016,  to
December 31, 2017;  and  wrongful use of alprazolam  (Xanax), a Schedule  IV  drug, on
May  31,  2021.  Charge  II:  violation  of  UCMJ,  Article  131b:  on  or  about  June  3,  2020,
Applicant  removed  trash  from  [Amn  X’s] dormitory  room  with the  intent  to  obstruct  the
due  administration  of  justice  in  his  case  because  he  believed  criminal  charges  were
pending against him. He was sentenced to 30 days confinement, reduction to the grade
of Airman Basic and a reprimand. (Tr. 18-21; GE 4)
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  states  that  he  was  honest,  truthful  and
cooperative when interviewed by special agents. He owned up to his mistakes. He was
released five days early from confinement for good behavior. He says his integrity and
core values are still intact. He would just like to put this behind him and “overcome the
weight that’s been on my back for 2 years now.” His supervisors can attest to his work
ethic  and  honesty.  He  is  responsible  for  his  past  mistakes  and  states  they  will  never
happen  again.  He  has  been  through  trials  and  tribulations  and  has  made  it  out  alive.

Whole-Person  Factors
Master  Sergeant  S.L.  prepared  a  character  statement  of  behalf  of  Applicant  in
April 2021.  He first met Applicant in 2017, when he was assigned to his unit. Applicant
was ahead of his peer group. He describes Applicant as the hardest working airman in
the  flight.  He  won  a  monthly  performance  award  ten  times  in  a  row.  He  describes  his
performance  as  great.  He  is  aware  of  the  charges  against  Applicant.  He  believes  he
should be given the most leniency possible. He believes he will learn from this and will
continue  his  great  work  performance  and  has  a  lot  of  potential  for  rehabilitation  to
become a productive member of society. (AE B at 2)
Mr.  S.,  the  Operations  Supervisor,  where  Applicant  currently  works  describes
Applicant  as  “hard-working,  dedicated  and  well-mannered.”  He  is  a  role-model  and
team-player.  He  has  relied  on  him  to  be  the  driving  force  to  motivate  the  crew  to
accomplish their daily goals. (AE B at 3)
Another current supervisor, Mr. S2, states Applicant has an amazing work ethic
and dedication to doing his best. He is a model employee and team leader. He is willing
to help others with their tasks as well completing his own. He describes Applicant as “a
respected, genuine and honest person who puts others before himself.” (AE B at 4)
Since  his  discharge  from  active  duty,  Applicant  has  been  able  to  purchase  a
house and a new car. (AE C).  On February 20, 2023, he took a drug test. The drug test
was negative for illegal substances. (AE D)

"Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a government contractor for which he has
worked  since  May  2019.  He  has  taken  some  college  courses  but  has  not  earned  an
undergraduate degree.  He has earned a firefighter and electrical-technician  certificate.
He has never married and has no children. (GE 1, 2)
Applicant has been involved with marijuana for many years. At all times relevant
to  this  security  clearance  investigation,  marijuana  purchase  and  possession  (and
therefore its use) has been illegal. From about 2006 through April 2022, he purchased
and  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency.  He  began  using  marijuana  when  he  was
about  16  years  old  to  self-medicate  his  depression  and  anxiety.  The  longest  he  went
without  using  marijuana  during  this  time  was  about  six  months.  In  about  March  2006
and  March  2008,  he  was  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana  and  pleaded  guilty  to
the  charges  both  times.  In  about  April  2019,  after  undergoing  employer-required
urinalysis testing, he tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a chemical found in
marijuana.  That  same  month,  his  employer,  Company  A,  terminated  his  employment
because  of  this  positive  urinalysis  test.  He  claimed  he  stopped  his  marijuana
involvement in April 2022 because he worked on a military base where  marijuana use
was prohibited. He asserted that he will not use marijuana in the future if it is prohibited
by  the  terms  of  his  employment,  but  otherwise  he  may  use  it  again.  (Tr.  22-26,  31;
Answer; GE 2-4)
Despite being required to do so, Applicant failed to disclose  his illegal drug use
and his April 2019 employment termination on his March 2022 Electronic Questionnaire
for Investigations Processing (SF 86). During his June 2022 security interview, he lied to
an  authorized  DOD  investigator,  telling  the  investigator  that  he  resigned  from  the
company  from  which  he  was  terminated.  Applicant  told  the  DOD  investigator  that  he
had  been  terminated  from  this  employment  only  after  the  investigator  confronted  him
with  that  information.  He  then  provided  truthful  information  concerning  his  marijuana
involvement  while  explaining  to  the  DOD  investigator  that  his  employment  termination
resulted  from  marijuana  use.  While  the  DOD  investigator  did  not  confront  him
specifically  about  his  marijuana  involvement,  Applicant  disclosed  this  marijuana
involvement  after  being  confronted  about  a  different  intentional misrepresentation.  (Tr.
26-30; Answer; GE 1-3)
In his Answer, Applicant admitted his marijuana purchase, use, criminal charges,
and  positive  urinalysis  test.  He  admitted  that  his  employment  with  Company  A  was
terminated because of his positive urinalysis test. He also admitted that he had falsified
material facts about his marijuana involvement and  employment termination on his SF
86,  and  that  he  had  lied  about  his  employment  termination  to  a  DOD  investigator.  He
admitted  that  he  certified  his  SF  86  knowing  that  he  misrepresented  material  facts  on
that  application.  He  claimed  that  he  omitted  this  information  because  he  was
embarrassed and  as a form of self-sabotage, because he did not think he would  keep
his job for very long. He has since realized that he enjoys his work and finds it fulfilling.
As  he  wants  to  keep  his  job,  he  is  now  more  interested  in  obtaining  a  security
clearance. He claimed he is not a dishonest person. He asserted that he self-sabotaged
himself by intentionally failing his urinalysis test because he hated his job with Company
A  and  thought  testing  positive  for  marijuana  would  get  him  fired.  (Tr.  16-21,  26-30;

Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant had used marijuana from about
Fall 2011 to about June 2022, and after being granted a DOD security clearance in March
2021.  (SOR ¶ 1.a) It also  alleged that he  purchased marijuana  with  varying  frequency
from January 2022 until June 2022. (SOR ¶ 1.b) Applicant admitted these allegations with
clarification.  He  testified  that  he  smoked  marijuana  once  in  the  Fall  of  2011;  he  used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  2014  through  2017;  and  then  he  used
marijuana  from  about January 2022  through June 2022,  while  he was  living  in  a  state
where  marijuana  use  was  legal  under  state  law.  He  was  not  aware  that  the  state  law
conflicted with federal law, and, in the context of DOD security clearances, that marijuana
use was considered illegal. He purchased marijuana from state-licensed vendors, and he
used marijuana occasionally. He stated, “Upon [my employment] resignation, I fully and
honestly believed my clearance ended with it.” He also noted in his Answer, “I have never
once seen or handled a classified document.” (Answer; Tr. 24-25)
Applicant explained that he did not undergo a full security clearance investigation
or  was  involved  in  a  background  interview  by  the  time  he  had  resigned  from  his
employment in late 2021. He neither knew the definition of a “federal contractor” nor the
rules,  laws,  and  regulations  that  went  along  with  this  concept  in  the  context  of  DOD
security clearances. He indicated in his November 2020 SCA that he never intended to
use marijuana again. He was truthful when he wrote that because he was living in a state
where marijuana use was illegal, and he assumed he would continue living in that state.
After he moved to a different state in January 2022, he was asked by his current employer
to  reapply  for  a  security  clearance.  In  June  2022,  Applicant  conducted  research  and
immediately stopped his use of marijuana after he discovered that such use, even in a
state where it is legal, is still considered an illegal controlled substance under federal law.
He disclosed his marijuana use on his January 2022 SCA. Applicant adamantly denied
that  he  had  been  put  on  notice  of  the  security  significance  of  marijuana  use  when  he
applied for a security clearance in late 2020. As soon as he became aware of how federal
law applied to him in a state where marijuana use is legal, his marijuana use ended. He
has not used marijuana since June 2022, and he does not intend to use it in the future.
(Answer; Tr. 24-26, 31-33 36, 39-40; GE 1 and 2)
In  August  2022,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  authorized  DOD  investigator
about his listed use of marijuana on the June 2022 SCA. Applicant told the investigator
that he had used marijuana weekly to monthly from January 2022 to June 2022. He also
explained  that  he  stopped  his  use  of  marijuana  after  he  learned  in  June  2022  of  the
application of federal law and the overall security significance of such use. He told the
investigator that he did  not  know that his  initial  security clearance could  continue from
one government contractor to the next. Applicant was remorseful about his recent use of
marijuana. (GE 1 and 3)
In August 2023, his employer’s facility security officer sent to employees the Office
of  the  Under Secretary of  Defense memorandum  “Guidance  Concerning  Marijuana  for
Agencies  Conducting  Adjudications.”  Applicant  provided  this document  as  evidence  to
show that it was sent to employees due to the confusion about marijuana use in a state
which had legalized its use and the consequence to DOD security clearance holders living
in those states. The Memorandum disclosed that government contractor employees are
to refrain from marijuana use upon initiation of the national security and vetting process.
Applicant contends that he has followed this guidance because he immediately stopped
his  use  of  marijuana  in  June  2022,  while  he  was  under  investigation  by  the  U.S.
Government. He discontinued  his use of marijuana when  he became aware of  current
federal law and the overall security significance. (AE A; Tr. 26-31, 36)

with  him. This  colleague  found  Applicant to  be  a  person  of unquestionable integrity,  goal-
oriented, and fully transparent. He also stated he was aware of the general confusion for
new hires when they reside in a state where marijuana use is legal while seeking a DOD
security clearance. He recommended Applicant be granted national security eligibility.

personal  use,  and  he  used  it  once  to  twice  weekly  in  the  evenings,  at  home,  to  relax
after  work  and  to  exercise  his  civil  liberties.  He  maintained  during  his  February  2022
background  interview  that  he  does  not  associate  with  individuals  who  use  drugs
illegally, and that he has never used marijuana in the presence of others.  He intends to
continue to use and purchase marijuana in the future. (SOR ¶ 1.d) He does not consider

Applicant denied that he used and purchased marijuana in February 2022, while
employed  in  a  sensitive  position,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  (Item  1)  In  his  Answer,  he
claimed that he was not employed in a sensitive position when he used and purchased
marijuana  in  February 2022.  The  record  does  not  contain  any  evidence  that Applicant
was employed in a sensitive position in February 2022. It only reflects that he has been

"Applicant admitted  the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. She denied the SOR
allegation  in  ¶  1.c.  Her  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2008. She married in
2014 and has two children ages seven and  four. She has worked for the same federal
contractor  since  2006.  Applicant  held  a  top  secret  clearance  with  access  to  sensitive
compartmented information (SCI), but it is unknown when she first was granted access.
Applicant completed a security clearance application  (SCA) in September 2020.
Section 23 asked if in the past seven years she had illegally used any drugs or controlled
substance. She answered “yes.” She said that from about June 2011 to the present, she
used marijuana. She stated:
In   the   past,   I’ve   occasionally  used   marijuana   for  recreational  purposes.
However,  since   the   COVID  lock  down   I’ve   started   taking   CBD/THC
gummies more regularly to  help ease  my anxiety and  insomnia.  Honestly,
the  transition  to  the  sole  caregiver of my infant  and  toddler has been  HARD!
I have found these help cope with being stuck in the  house all  day with two
crazy kids.  Some  people unwind  with  a  glass of wine, I like  to  unwind  with
a  gummy. However, I  have  NEVER used  marijuana  during  work hours or
while I’m working. (Item 4)
Applicant  further  stated  that  since  March  2020,  she  would  typically  take  one
gummy at 6:00 p.m. almost every day. She would occasionally smoke marijuana at night
on the weekends. She said her stress levels were “off the charts” being thrown into being
a full-time mother and marijuana helped her relax and sleep. She intended to continue to
use marijuana gummies to manage her anxiety and insomnia because of her challenging
circumstances “being stuck at home 24/7, no interaction with others, having no help.” She
reiterated that she had never been under the influence at work or during working hours.
She disclosed she used the drug while holding a security clearance, and she intended to
continue to do so. She did not report in this SCA that she believed her marijuana use was
legal under state law and therefore permissible. (Item 4)
Applicant also disclosed in her September 2020 SCA that during a 2018 polygraph
examination, when asked about her drug use, she reported that she occasionally used
marijuana. She said that this information did not align with her 2018 SCA because she
had  responded  “no”  to  the  question  that  asked  if  she  had  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled substances in the past seven years.  She  answered  “yes” to  the  question  on
her  2020  SCA  that  asked  if  she  ever  had  her  security  clearance  eligibility/access
authorization denied, suspended, or revoked. Apparently, her failure to disclose her illegal
drug use on her 2018 SCA caused her access to SCI to be suspended or revoked but
she continued to hold a top secret security clearance. She said she was given a written
letter  from  a  senior  adjudication  officer  but  did  not  believe  there  is  anything  in  her
employment record.
Applicant completed an SCA in November 2022. Under Section 23, which asked
if in the past seven years she had illegally used any drugs or controlled substance, she
stated  “yes”  and  disclosed  her  marijuana  use.  She  provided  essentially  the  same
information  about  her  past  marijuana  use  except  she  reported  her  last  use  was  in
November 2022. She stated that with the COVID lockdown over, she had cut back on her
use to about three times a week after her children  were asleep. She also continued to
smoke marijuana at night on the  weekends. She does  not drink  alcohol, so  she found
marijuana  helped  her relax  and sleep.  She  reported  that  she  continued  to  use  it  while
holding  a  security  clearance  and  that  she  intended  to  continue  to  use  the  marijuana
gummies and occasionally smoke marijuana in the future. She stated: “Living in [State A]
where marijuana is legal, I see it interchangeably with alcohol.” (Item 3)
Applicant reported on her November 2022 SCA  the following regarding whether
she  had  received  a  written  warning,  been  officially  reprimanded,  suspended,  or
disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security policy:
I was read  in on  a  government program, but it was rescinded  for failing  to
disclose   the   use   of   drugs  on   the   updated   security  paperwork.  I   never
received  a  written  warning,  and  I  don’t believe  anything  was  added  to  my
employee  file but thought I should mention it. I’m not sure if that falls under
a  violation  of the  security policy as I  still  have  an  active  TS DOD clearance.
(Item  3)
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  reiterated  that  she  used  marijuana  and
marijuana  gummies  during  the  pandemic  to  cope  with  her  children  and  professional
workload and to decompress at the end of the day. She further stated that she recently
submitted her security clearance paperwork and she said she intended to continue to use
marijuana gummies and smoke marijuana because she was under the impression it was
legal to do so. She stated that after conducting an internet search she learned the use of
marijuana was illegal under federal law which trumped state law. She said she made a
mistake  and  apologized.  She  stated  she  now  will  no  longer  use  marijuana  products
because it is illegal and puts her security clearance at risk. (Item 2)
Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM or any  information about her
marijuana use from 2011 until 2016 before it was legalized in her state, while holding a
security clearance, and after her SCI access was suspended or revoked in 2018 for failing
to disclose her prior use, which was discovered during a polygraph examination.

"Applicant is a 40-year-old, single man. For the past six years, he has been working
for a defense contractor as an engineer. Previously, he worked as a sales representative
for a tech company. (Item 2 at 13)
Applicant has been using marijuana weekly from about 2013 to 2022. (Item 1 at 3)
He buys marijuana from state dispensaries and uses it in both cigarette and edible form.
(Item 4 at 4) He enjoys using it because it makes him feel calm. (Item 4 at 4) He has used it
at different points in his career while he possessed either a security clearance or a position
of trust. (Item 4 at 6) On September 14, 2023, Applicant completed a set of interrogatories
that the Government propounded. Questions 13 and 14 asked the following:
13. Do  you  understand  that  marijuana  use  remains  illegal  under Federal law
and   that  any  future  use   of  marijuana   may  affect  your  security  clearance
eligibility?
14.   Do   you   intend   to   illegally  use   drugs   or   controlled   substances   in   the
future?
Applicant answered “Yes” to both questions. (Item 4 at 7)
In 2020, Applicant completed a security clearance application. He did not disclose
his marijuana involvement and his use of marijuana while possessing a security clearance.
(Item 2 at 24) In his Answer, he explained that he did not disclose his use because it was
obtained legally and used in a state where it was legal. (Item 1 at 4)  Section 23 of the
security  clearance  application,  which  contained  all  the  questions  related  to  drug
involvement, informs applicants to answer the questions “in accordance with Federal Laws,
even though permissible under state laws.”  (Item 4 at 24) Two months later, Applicant
disclosed his marijuana use during an investigative interview. (Item 4 at 10,11)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR except
SOR ¶ 1.b, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old aircraft servicer employed by a federal contractor since
August 2019. He has never held a security clearance.  He has never married. He has a
three-year-old son for whom he pays child support.
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  July  2011.  He  attended  college  from
August  2011  to  December  2015,  when  he  received  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  received
student  financial  aid  while  in  college.  He  worked  part  time  as  a  self-employed  party
promoter from August 2011 to August 2019, selling tickets to parties and social events for
a profit. He also worked for a beverage company from July 2011 to September 2017. He
worked for a collection agency from October 2017 to January 2018, but he quit because
he did not like the work, and he was unemployed until he was hired for his current position.
He testified that many of his debts were incurred when he was going to college and trying
to  support  himself.  (Tr.  13)  He  incurred  student  loans  while  in  college,  but  he  has  not
started  making  payments  on  them.  (Tr.  16)  The  SOR  does  not  allege  any  delinquent
student loans.
In May 2018, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana.
He  and  two  passengers  were  in  his  vehicle,  and  the  two  passengers  were  smoking
marijuana. Disposition of the charges was deferred, and Applicant was required to attend
a substance-abuse class, pay a fine of $286, and perform 24 hours of community service.
After he completed these requirements, the charges were dismissed. (GX 2 at 4; GX 3)
He  testified  that  he  started  smoking  marijuana  “every  couple  days”  while  he  was
unemployed. (Tr. 44). He stopped using marijuana after the May 2018 incident. (Tr. 47)
His drug involvement is alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 3.a.
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts reflected in credit reports dated February 16,
2022 (GX 5); April 15, 2021 (GX 6); and January 4, 2024 (GX 7). The evidence concerning
these debts is summarized below.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  default  judgment  entered  in  December  2020  for  unpaid
property taxes on a motor vehicle in the amount $421. (GX 4 at 1) In Applicant’s answer
to the SOR, he admitted this debt and stated that he had contacted the  tax authority to
establish a payment plan. At the hearing, he testified that he did not know anything about
this debt. (Tr. 20-21) The judgment has not been satisfied.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a judgment entered against Applicant in March 2019 for $3,680.
Court records reflect that the judgment was for unpaid rent. (GX 4 at 3) At the hearing,
Applicant testified that his apartment had flooded and damaged his personal property, and
his  landlord  promised  to  reimburse  him  for  the  damages  but  did  not  keep  his  promise.
Applicant  testified  that  he  stopped  paying  rent  and  was  evicted  after  one  month  of
nonpayment. (Tr. 23) When he was interviewed by a security investigator in November
2019,  he  said  that  he  moved  out  when  he  received  an  eviction  notice.  He  told  the
investigator that he did not intend to pay judgment. (GX 2 at 6) However, the court records
reflect that the judgment was satisfied by garnishment in February 2021. (GX 4 at 5)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges an account charged-off for $14,167. The delinquent amount is
the  deficiency  after  a  vehicle  was  repossessed  and  sold.  (GX  5  at  3)  Applicant  told  a
security investigator that the debt is valid, but that he did not intend to pay it because he
could not afford to. (GX 2 at 6) As of the date of the hearing, he had taken no action to
resolve it. (Tr. 25).
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a  credit-card account charged off for $3,505. Applicant told a
security investigator that the creditor offered to settle this debt for $1,400, but he did not
intend to pay it. (GX 4 at 7) As of the date of the hearing, he had taken no action to resolve
it. (Tr. 25)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  an  account  charged  off  for  $1,882.  Applicant  told  a  security
investigator that this debt was the deficiency after a vehicle repossession that preceded
the  repossession  on  which  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  was  based.  He  told  the
investigator that he did not intend to pay it. (GX 4 at 7) At the hearing, he testified that he
believed the debt was a personal loan. (Tr. 25) It is unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  a  medical  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $369.  Applicant  told  a
security investigator that he does not intend to pay it. (GX 4 at 6) At the hearing, he testified
that he had numerous unpaid medical debts, but he was unable to specifically identify this
debt. (Tr. 25, 34) It is unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  a  utility  bill  placed  for  collection  of  $227.  He  told  a  security
investigator that he would contact the creditor and resolve it. (GX 4 at 6) At the hearing,
he testified  that he had  lived in multiple apartments, and he  could not  determine which
unpaid utility bill was alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 26) It is unresolved.
Applicant currently earns about $28 per hour, and his take-home pay for each two-
week  pay  period  is  about  $1,500.  (Tr.  19)  He  testified  that  he  was  behind  on  his  rent
payments and his car payments at the time of the hearing. (Tr. 26-27) For the past two
years, he has been paying $720 per month for his child’s daycare. In November 2023, he
was ordered to pay child support of $846 per month, plus $100 per month to include his
child in his medical insurance. (Tr. 32)
Applicant does not keep current on his financial obligations in part because he does
not regularly monitor his mail. He testified that his mail goes to his grandfather’s house,
and sometimes it is weeks or months before he gets his mail. (Tr. 21-22) He submitted no
evidence of financial counseling. He has not disputed any of the debts.
",True
"Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with some explanations concerning the
drug use allegations. Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact.  After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 24 years old. In May 2021, she graduated from college with a degree
in mechanical engineering. She is single, never married, and has no children. (Tr. 20, 41;
GE 1-3)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying
frequency, from about February 2021 through about March 2021 (SOR ¶ 1.a); and that
she  used  marijuana  in  about  July  2021,  after  being  granted  eligibility  for  access  to
classified information. (SOR ¶ 1.b).
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  gave  false
information on her March 2021 security clearance application (SCA) when she failed to
disclose her illegal drug use as stated in SOR ¶¶1.a-1.b above (SOR ¶ 2.a); and that she
gave  false  information  during  her  June  16,  2021  and  July  27,  2021,  background
interviews, when she initially denied any use of illegal drugs. After being confronted with
information  about  her  marijuana  use,  she  admitted  it  as  described  in  SOR  ¶¶1.a-1.b
above. (SOR ¶ 2.b)
Applicant began working for her current employer, a  DOD contractor, in her full-
time  position  in  August  2021.  She  had  previously  worked  as  a  summer  intern  for  this
same employer from June to August 2020, the summer between her junior and senior
years of college. She completed an SCA for the internship in February 2020 (GE 1) and
was granted a security clearance in late July 2020, shortly before her internship ended.
She  also  signed  a  classified  nondisclosure  agreement  in  June  2020  (GE  4).  After  her
summer internship ended, she was asked to stay on with her employer through her last
year  of  school  as  a  part-time  intern.  All  the  work  she  performed  during  her  summer
internship and her part-time internship involved unclassified material. She agreed to take
the part-time position and worked in this capacity from August 2020 to June 2021. She
stopped working in July 2021 to have some time off before her full-time position started
in August 2021. (Tr. 18-19, 31, 34; GE1-2)
In  March  2021,  Applicant  completed  a  second  SCA.  In  Section  23  of  the  SCA
covering past drug use  or activity, Applicant answered  “No” to  the question  asking  if in
the past seven years, she had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances. She also
answered “No” to the question asking if she had ever used illegal drugs while possessing
a security clearance. (GE 2)
On June 16, 2021, Applicant was telephonically interviewed by an investigator as
part of her background check. She was asked about prior drug use and she answered
that she had no involvement with any illegal drugs, including marijuana, in her past. (GE
3)
On July 27, 2021, Applicant was reinterviewed telephonically by the investigator
about her drug activity. She was asked if within the past seven years she had used any
illegal  drugs  or  controlled  substances  and  she  responded,  “No.”  The  investigator  then
confronted  Applicant  with  information  developed  during  the  investigation  that  she  had
used marijuana edibles early in 2021. Applicant acknowledged that use and explained it
by saying she had blocked that time from her mind. She further explained that she went
through a breakup with her boyfriend and was home alone and upset. She decided to
ingest  several  marijuana  gummies  (2-4)  that  her  former  boyfriend  had  given  her.  She
went on to explain that earlier in her relationship with the former boyfriend, which started
in February 2021, she smoked marijuana with him one time. She also ate a marijuana
gummy on one other occasion. Her relationship with her former boyfriend ended in March
2023. Applicant claimed the reason she did not disclose this information when she was
first interviewed was because she was nervous about the questions and just blurted out
“No.” (GE 3)
The  investigator  asked  Applicant  about  any  other  drug  involvement  and  she
admitted  going  on  a  picnic  with  friends  in  early  July  2021,  where  she  ate  a  marijuana
edible offered by her friend. She acknowledged this use was after her initial interview with
the investigator on June 16, 2021. (GE 3)
On July 29, 2021, Applicant called the investigator to relay additional details about
her marijuana use. She  smoked marijuana about four times with her former boyfriend.
She ate edible forms of marijuana on two occasions. After her breakup with her boyfriend,
she consumed four edibles. All this marijuana use occurred in February and March 2021.
Applicant further described her claimed last use of marijuana with her friends in early July
2021.  She  also  told  the  investigator  that  she  initially  failed  to  disclose  this  information
because she “felt on the spot” and she feared losing her job. (GE 3)
Applicant’s  hearing  testimony  was  consistent  with  her  later  admissions  of
marijuana use in February, March, and July 2021, as described above. She claimed her
last use of Marijuana was in July 2021. She also claimed she no longer associates with
people who use drugs. She stated she had no intentions to use marijuana in the future.
She further stated that she failed to disclose this information because she was scared of
losing  her  job  and  she  did  not  want  to  disappoint  her  parents.  On  cross  examination,
Applicant admitted that, as early as her first summer internship, she knew marijuana use
was  prohibited  by  her  employer’s  drug  policy.  She  had  to  take  a  drug  test  before  she
started that internship. (Tr. 21-24, 26-28, 30, 33; GE 5)
Applicant testified that she has matured since she began her full-time employment
in August 2021. Specifically, she has better friends now who do not use illegal drugs. She
has a new boyfriend, and she has moved away from the location where her former friends
live. (Tr. 41)
Applicant’s  two  supervisors,  one  former  and  one  current,  testified  for  her  at  the
hearing. Her former supervisor was in that position during 2021. She believes Applicant
handled classified information in an appropriate manner. She also opined that Applicant
is reliable and trustworthy. Applicant’s current supervisor has been in that position since
November 2022. He considers Applicant a good employee and has had no conduct or
behavioral issues with her. She handled classified information in an appropriate manner.
He is aware of the circumstances in this case and despite those, he has confidence in
Applicant and believes that she should retain her security clearance. (Tr. 42-48, 62-64)

From  about  December  2021  to  July  2022,  Applicant  used  nitrous  oxide
(N2O) with varying frequency and purchased it on various occasions. (SOR
¶¶ 1.q and 1.r)
Regarding  his  future  intention  to  use  marijuana,  ecstasy,  mushrooms,  LSD,
Adderall  and  nitrous oxide  gas,  Applicant  stated  in  his SCA  that  he  would  discontinue
their uses in the future as per requirements of his employer’s policies and to maintain a
security clearance. Having a good job and workplace were more important. (Item 2)
Regarding his future use of DMT, Applicant said he did not intend to use it in the
future because “I got the experiences I sought from this substance; I have no desire to
use it again.” Regarding future use of benzodiazepine, he said, “I did not particularly enjoy
or  get  anything  out  of  using  this  substance  and  do  not  plan  on  using  it  ever  again.”
Regarding future use of cocaine, he said he did not intend on using it in the future because
“the last time I used it, I suffered a very painful reaction to it that resembled anaphylaxis,
it was the most horrible experience I have ever had, it lasted several hours.” He further
stated, “I am  very grateful to  be  alive  and  strive more than  ever to be  healthy after the
mistake I made of using this substance.” (Item 2)
Applicant made additional comments regarding his drug activity on his SCA. He
requested that his drug activity remain confidential and requested that anyone that wished
to speak to him about his drug use do so in a private setting because where he works the
walls are very easy to hear through. He stated, “I do not want any of my co-workers to
know any of this information that don’t absolutely have to.” (Item 2)
Applicant completed government interrogatories in June 2023. He affirmed that his
statement made to the investigator was essentially accurate, except for some spelling of
names,  biographical  information,  and  work  history.  In  addition,  he  noted  that  some
information from his SCA  was  incorrectly  copied  and  included  as part  of his interview.
Specifically,  the  quantity  of  cocaine  he  used  each  time  and  the  number  of  times  he
purchased  mushrooms.  I  have  noted  the  discrepancies  and  will  only  consider  the
information  regarding  these  facts  taken  from  the  SCA.  Including  in  the  interrogatories,
Applicant  reported  the  times  he  purchased  different  drugs,  from  whom,  and  the  price.
(Item 3)
Applicant  further  stated  that he  no  longer associates  with  anyone he  previously
used  illegal  drugs  with.  He  said  he  moved  to  a  new  location,  which  has  been  a  great
change for him. He enjoys his work environment, and his life is more peaceful and calm.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old senior avionics integration and test engineer employed
by a defense contractor since September 2022. He graduated from high school in May
2012 and received a bachelor’s degree in May 2016. He attended post-graduate courses
from January 2017 to August 2018 but did not receive a degree. He was employed as an
electrical engineer by several federal contractors from October 2017 until he was hired
by his current employer.
In October 2017, Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for non-sensitive
positions  (e-QIP)  (SF 85  format).  He  answered  “No”  to  the  question,  “In  the  last  year,
have you used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs?” He did not disclose
that he had used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and mushrooms on various occasions
between approximately 2013 and the date of his e-QIP and that he had used marijuana
from about August 2012 through the date of his e-QIP.
In September 2022, Applicant submitted another e-QIP (SF 86 format), seeking a
security clearance. In response to questions about illegal use of drugs or drug activity, he
disclosed that he regularly used marijuana in college about once a week between 2012
and September 2016 and that he used marijuana about one to three times a year between
2016 and 2021. He disclosed that he used hallucinogenic substances such as LSD and
mushrooms about two times a year while in college and about once a year until 2021. He
disclosed that he used Adderall as a study aid in college a few times a year. Finally, he
disclosed that he purchased marijuana illegally from 2012 to 2016 and that he purchased
it from legal dispensaries from 2016 to 2021.
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  his  previous  drug  use  was
infrequent, that he was not dependent on drugs, and that they had no negative effect on
his work or personal life. He decided to stop using illegal drugs in September 2021, when
he was offered a position that required a security clearance. He stated that he has not
used Adderall for seven years. He stated that he did not disclose his drug involvement in
his October 2017 e-QIP because he was young, “relatively fresh out of school,” and afraid
that he would be fired if he disclosed it. He declared that he will not use illegal drugs in
the future. He acknowledged that his falsification was wrong and that he now understands
that he needs to be candid and forthright in matters involving national security.
In Applicant’s response  to  the  FORM, he  pointed  out that his last  drug  use  was
more than two years ago and that it was his only drug involvement in the last four years.
He declared his intent to refrain from further illegal drug use and asked for consideration
of his change of behavior and full disclosure of past drug use.

"Applicant is a 24-year-old employee of a DOD contractor. He has worked for them
since January 2022. He received a bachelor’s degree in December 2021. He has never
been married and has no children. This is his first time applying for a security clearance.
(Item 2)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that Applicant used marijuana and other products containing
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with varying frequency from about March 2013 to about June
2023.  SOR  ¶  1.b  alleged  that  Applicant  purchased  marijuana  and  other  products
containing THC from about February 2023 until about June 2023. He admitted both SOR
allegations. His  SOR admissions are incorporated  as findings of fact. After a  thorough
review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
In his answers to Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his December
2022 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he illegally used marijuana
with varying frequency between March 2013 and July 2021. (Item 3 at 44) He described
his illegal marijuana use as follows:
I smoked marijuana a few times in college. It is not illegal in [state where I
currently live] but illegal in [state] where I went to school. (Item 3 at 44)
I had a year in high school where I used it frequently. And now I probably
use it twice a year. (Id.)
On February 13, 2023, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator conducting
his background investigation.  In response to DOHA interrogatories dated July 18, 2023,
he reviewed a summary of the interview and indicated that he found it to be accurate after
adding  some  additional  information.  During  the  background  investigation  interview,  he
was  questioned  about  his  illegal  use  of  marijuana.  He  indicated  that  his  last  use  of
marijuana was in February 2023, after he completed his security clearance application in
December 2022. From March 2013 to July 2021, Applicant did not purchase marijuana.
He  obtained  marijuana  from  his  friends.  He  began  using  marijuana  again  in  February
2023. He purchased marijuana from a dispensary. Marijuana is legal in the state where
he currently resides. He began using marijuana again because he is around friends who
smoke marijuana, and it is legal. He is willing to stop smoking marijuana if it affects his
security clearance. He told the investigator that he will likely use marijuana in the future.
(Item 4)
In his July 2023, interrogatory responses, Applicant indicated that the last time he
used marijuana was on June 10, 2023, but he no longer uses marijuana. (Item 4 at 3) In
his response to the SOR, Applicant indicated that a lot of his mistakes occurred when he
was  young  and  immature.  He  has  since  matured  and  become  more  responsible.  He
believes he can contribute to his country and community. (Item 2)

"Applicant  admitted  the  sole  allegation  in  the  SOR  (¶  1.a),  with  a  narrative
statement. His admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old. He has been married since 2002 and has several prior
marriages.  His  children  are  grown.  He  served  as  an  enlisted  soldier  in  the  Army  from
1987  to  1988  when  he  was  discharged  after  he  was  injured  during  training.  He  later
served as a commissioned Army officer, from 2000 to 2003. He has a bachelor’s degree
(1996), a master’s degree (2003), and a doctoral degree (2007). (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 36-38,
52-53)
Applicant’s  professional  expertise
fields  of  public  health  and
epidemiology. Among other positions during his career, he worked as a health research
analyst for a major defense contractor from 2009 to 2011 and again from 2012 to 2017,
while holding a security clearance. He worked in public health and disease control for a
major  corporation  from  2017  to  2022.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  and
clearance sponsor since February 2022. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 54-55)
the
in
is
Applicant  had  back  surgeries  in  2008,  2012,  2018  (twice),  2019,  and  2020.  He
has  chronic  back  pain  that  has  long  eluded  effective  medical  treatment.  His  pain
management  doctors  recommended  prescription  opiates,  but  Applicant,  relying  in  part
on his own professional background, has been wary of taking opioids as painkillers due
to their addictive properties. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 22-24)
Applicant lives in a state where marijuana use is approved for medical purposes.
In  February  2021,  he  applied  for  and  received  a  State  1  “Medical  Marijuana  Use
Registry”  identification  card.  His  registry  remains  valid  as  of  this  writing,  but  it  is  to
expire  within  weeks,  on  February  11,  2024.  (AE  J;  Tr.  24)  He  has  not  renewed  it  and
does not intend to do so. (Tr. 29)
Beginning in early 2021 (either February 2021 (GE 2 at 4) or late March or early
April  2021  (Tr.  39)),  Applicant  began  using  CBD  products  for  medical  purposes  to
alleviate his back pain, at the recommendation of his primary care physician. He said he
used one  “gummy”  every  night or every other night to help him sleep. He also used a
prescribed  topical  oil  or  balm  “applied  to  affected  areas  during  working  hours.”  The
products contained THC but he said they had only 0.2% THC content. (GE 2 at 4; Tr.
15-16, 24, 31-32;  Answer) He  said  in  his hearing  testimony  that  the  products  he  used
were CBD (cannabidiol) with a low amount of THC. (Tr. 55)
Post-hearing, Applicant submitted lab results for two of the THC gummy batches
he purchased. One batch, from February 2023, contained 0.079% THC, 0.077% CBD,
and  0.174%  total  cannabinoids.  A  second  batch,  from  June  2023,  contained  0.196%
THC, 0.424% CBD, and 0.662 total cannabinoids. (AE M, AE N
At  the  time  he  started  using  the  products,  Applicant  was  not  employed  in  the
defense  industry.  He did  not  disclose this  use  on his February 2022  SCA because he
did not believe his use was illegal. The “Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity” portion of
his SCA noted that:
The  following  questions  pertain  to  the  illegal  use  of  drugs  or  controlled
substances  or  drug  or  controlled  substance  activity  in  accordance  with
federal laws, even though permissible under state laws. (GE 1 at 34)
Applicant  voluntarily  disclosed  his  use  at  the  completion  of  his  background
interview,  on  March  28,  2022.  (GE  1,  GE  2  at  4;  Tr.  24,  34)  He  testified  that  the
interviewing  agent  told  him  that  his use  of  marijuana  was  illegal under  federal  law but
said use was being considered on a case-by-case basis. (Tr. 25, 41) He also said in his
interview that he was not aware that using the products would cause a problem with his
clearance. (GE 2 at 5) What the interviewer may have told him is not reflected in GE 2,
the interview summary. (Tr. 39-40) Applicant also testified that he promptly disclosed his
marijuana use to his employer’s facility security officer (FSO), Mr. S. He said Mr S. told
him  about  “the  guidance  not  being  exact  regarding  the  use  of  medical  marijuana  or
derivatives of cannabis.” (Tr. 25, 35)
After the hearing, Applicant provided the e-mail he sent to his FSO on March 29,
2022  (the  day  after  his  background  interview),  in  which  he  disclosed  his  medical
marijuana use. Days later, on April 4, 2022, his FSO advised him that he had forwarded
the  information  to  DOD,  and  as  a  result,  Applicant’s  interim  clearance  was  withdrawn.
He was also debriefed from access to classified information. (AE O, AE P)
In his e-mail to Applicant, his FSO said, in part,  “The investigation  [will] have to
run its course and be adjudicated before a final determination can be made.” Applicant
said he understood, and that, “[h]opefully the adjudication process will have a different
outcome.”  In  response,  the  FSO  said  he  himself  was  a  former  adjudicator,  and  that
“[e]verything is circumstantial now.” (AE P)
When   asked   during   his  hearing   why  he   continued   to   use   medical  marijuana   at
this point,  Applicant said  that this  was  because  of “the  guidance  not being  exact  on  how
medical  marijuana   usage   was  considered.  While   marijuana   itself  was  still   a   Schedule
One  substance,  there was not  clear guidance  on  products derived  from  marijuana.”  (Tr.
42) He cited  a memo from  the  Director  of National Intelligence  containing  “guidance  that
a  whole person  consideration  was to  be  made  in lieu  of just discounting  [sic] someone
for  marijuana  usage.  So, during  that time  I was letting  the  adjudication  process play out
to see  where  it landed.”  (Tr. 42-43)
In  June  2023,  Applicant  responded  to  a  interrogatory  from  the  DSCA  about  his
drug use. He answered YES to the following question:
1.  Do you currently illegally use any drugs or controlled substances?
Please  note:  marihuana  (marijuana)  and  extracts  of  marijuana  are
classified  as  Schedule  1  drugs  by  the  DEA  and  are  thus  illegal
federally.  Please  consider  all  forms  of  use,  such  as  cannabis  leaf,
flower,  kief,  hashish,  and  oil  (including  THC  and  CBD)  AND manners
of  use,  such  as  smoking,  inhaling  vapor,  infusing,  into  food  oils,  or
otherwise incorporated into food, applied topically or ingesting tincture,
or otherwise. (GE 3 at 3)
When asked for specifics, Applicant reported that he used 10 milligrams (mg) of
“Low-THC medical Marijuana,” that he did so “Daily,” most recently on June 8, 2023 (the
day  before  he  signed  the  interrogatory  response)  and  that  he  intended  “to  continue
future rate of illegal use.” (GE 3 at 4, 8) He explained that his use of medical marijuana
was  approved  by  his  state’s  “Office  of  Medical  Marijuana  Use”  following  examination
and review  of  his medical  records by a medical  doctor in April 2021  regarding chronic
pain  following  multiple  back  surgeries.  He  said  he  obtained  the  medication  from  a
licensed  dispensary  and  that  it  was  taken  orally  following  a  physician’s  direction.  He
said the marijuana relieves his back spasms and leaves him relaxed and drowsy. (GE 3
at 4-5, 9)
Applicant also acknowledged  that he understood that “marijuana remains  illegal
under  federal  law  and  that  any  future  use  of  marijuana  may  affect  your  security
clearance eligibility.” He nonetheless indicated that he intended “to illegally use drugs or
controlled substances in the future,” specifically, medical marijuana, to treat his chronic
pain, limited to “non-working times” as previously described. (GE 3 at 8)
In his testimony, Applicant said that he answered “Yes” because he had “learned
from the [interviewing] agent that any form of cannabis product is considered illegal.” He
also answered “Yes”  to “continued [future] use  since it still seemed that the content of
THC and medical direction were being, or might be, taken into consideration.” (Tr. 25)
Applicant  also  acknowledged  that  his  employer  had  a  drug  policy,  and  he
provided a copy of it. He signed each page of the policy. (GE 3 at 7, 10-15) During his
hearing, he said he found the policy online through his employer while responding to the
interrogatory. He said he had not been previously aware of it or been provided a copy of
it. (Tr. 43-45)
The  employer’s  “Drug-Free  Workplace  Policy”  notes  that  it  governs  the
company’s  compliance  with  the  federal  Drug-Free  Workplace  Act  of  1988.  It  includes
the following:
While the use of marijuana has been legalized under several state laws for
medicinal and/or recreational uses, it remains an illegal drug under federal
law,  and  its  use  as  it  impacts  the  workplace  is  prohibited  by  [company]
policy, and employees found to be in possession of or under the influence
of  alcohol  or  any  drug  may  be  subject  to  disciplinary  action  up  to  [and]
including termination. (GE 3 at 10)
The  company’s  policy  also  addresses  drug  and  alcohol  testing,  including  for
marijuana, based on reasonable suspicion, pre-employment drug testing for prospective
employees,  periodic  or  random  testing,  and  post-incident  testing.  (GE  3  at  11-12,  13)
Applicant said he was not required to participate in pre-employment drug testing before
he was hired. He said he has never been drug tested while employed there. (Tr. 32)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  has  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency
since  about  April  2021,  and  that  he  intends  to  continue  using  marijuana  in  the  future.
Applicant  answered  the  SOR  in  August  2023.  He  admitted  the  allegation  with  a
narrative  explanation. He  noted  that  he  “intend[s]  to  comply  with  the  National  Security
Adjudicative  Guidelines  and  will  consider  processes  to  obtain  approval  for  continued
use of medical cannabis.” (Answer)
On September 26, 2023, after he received Department Counsel’s discovery letter
(HE I), he provided a sworn statement of intent to immediately abstain from “marijuana,
medical  or  otherwise,  in  any  form.”  He  further  acknowledged  that  any  further
involvement  would  be  grounds  for  the  immediate  revocation  of  his  national  security
eligibility. (AE B; GE 4) He also said,
It  was  never  my  intent  to  disregard  any  laws  regarding  the  use  of
marijuana  and  I  had  wrongly  interpreted  the  issuance  of  a  medical
marijuana  card  in  [State  1]  to also  negate  any  federal prohibition against
the  use  of  marijuana  derivatives  for  that  purpose.  Now  that  I  have  that
clarification,  I  will  immediately  abstain  and  seek  out  other  treatment
options. (GE 4)
In later e-mails seeking a status update on his case, Applicant stated that he had
abstained  from  using  marijuana  in  any  form,  for  any  purpose,  as  of  September  24,
2023.  (GE  4)  He  confirmed  this  during  his  hearing  testimony,  and  said  he  intends  to
continue to abstain from any product derived from cannabis. (Tr. 26, 35, 39)
Since  June  2023,  Applicant  has
taken  prescription  medications,  under
appropriate  medical  supervision,  to  address  his  chronic  back  pain.  His  prescriptions
include  duloxetine  (Cymbalta),  lidocaine,  and  celecoxib  (Celebrex).  (Tr.  49-50,  53)  He
provided  photos  of  the  prescription  labels  after  the  hearing.  (AE  C,  AE  G,  H,  I)  along
with letters from his prescribing physicians. (AE K, AE L) He said his prescriptions have
proven “very effective” in managing his chronic pain. (Tr. 25, 34-35)
Applicant  testified  that while  his  marijuana  use  continued  after  he responded  to
the interrogatories in June 2023, he lessened his use so as  to wean himself off of the
marijuana, as he transitioned to  the prescription  pain medications. He continued using
marijuana  medicinally  until  September  24,  2023,  as  noted  above.  He  no  longer
possesses  any  THC  medications  or  gummies,  and  he  disposed  of  them  that  day.
Applicant specifically disavowed any future intent to “go back to using what I now know
to be a clearly illegal treatment.” Neither his wife nor his children use marijuana. (Tr. 29,
31, 46-49)
Applicant has never used marijuana or other illegal substance in the past except
in  this  circumstance.  (Tr.  39-40)  He  has  never  been  charged  with  any  drug-related  or
other  criminal  offense.  He  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  drug  abuse  or  drug
dependency. (Tr. 56)
When  asked  why  his  assertions  of  future  abstinence  should  be  considered
credible,  Applicant  said  he  has  “a  clearer  understanding  of  the  legalities  surrounding
products  derived  from  cannabis.”  He  said  he  has  strived  throughout  his  life  to
demonstrate respect for the law. He has a background in law enforcement and seeks to
be a role model for his children and grandchildren. (Tr. 51)
Applicant  provided  strong  character
from  several  personal  and
professional  references,  all  of  them  with  doctoral  degrees.  They  attested  that  he  is  a
dedicated  professional,  who  has  a  long  history  of  public  service.  They  wrote  that  he
demonstrates  the  utmost  integrity,  honesty,  sincerity,  and  ethical  conduct.  He  is
regarded  as  reliable  and  trustworthy,  and  his  references  recommend  him  for  security
clearance  eligibility.  (AE  D)  He  provided  annual  evaluations  noting  that  he  is  highly
effective and an expert in his field. (AE E)

Drug  Involvement and Substance Misuse
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  H  that  Applicant  had  used  and  purchased
marijuana from about November 2021 to about May 2022, after being granted access to
classified information by the DOD in 2019. (SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant admitted the allegation,
and stated at the time he was living in a state where marijuana use was legal under state
law. He was not aware that the state law conflicted with federal law, and, in the context
of  DOD  security  clearances,  that  marijuana  use  was  considered  illegal.  He  purchased
marijuana from state licensed vendors, and he only used marijuana “a handful of times in
7 months.” He was working full time and attending graduate school, and he had difficulty
falling asleep, so he used marijuana as a sleep aid. After the school year ended in May
2022, he stopped his use of marijuana. Applicant has not used marijuana since May 2022,
and he provided a statement of intent to abstain from marijuana use in the future. (Items
1-3; AE A)
Personal Conduct
Due to Applicant’s ignorance of state and federal laws, he did not disclose his use
of  marijuana  on  the  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  he  completed  in  December
2022. (SOR ¶ 2.a) He denied that his omission was intentional falsification.  During his
January 2023 background interview, he was completely candid about his marijuana use
when questioned by an investigator. He stated that he did not realize that using marijuana
was wrong. He used marijuana once about every one to two months as a sleep aid, and
he purchased marijuana from a dispensary spending no more than $10. He decided to
stop using marijuana in May 2022 because he did not believe it was helping him with his
sleep issues and because he also did not like the way it made him feel. He has never
reported to work under the influence of marijuana, he is not dependent on marijuana, and
he has never been arrested or needed counseling for illegal drug use. (Items 2, 3 and 5)

Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.

completed  a  security  clearance  application  on  September  15,  2022.  He  has  never
applied for or held a security clearance before.
Applicant  has  an  extensive  history  of  illegal  drug  use.  He  admits  each  of  the
allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR.  He  admits  that  he  has  used  marijuana,  with  varying
frequency, from approximately September 1982 to at least March 2022.  He admits that
he used ecstasy/MDMA, with varying frequency, from approximately August 1996 to at
least September 2019.  He admits that he used LSD, with varying frequency, from 1999
to  at  least  August  2019.  He  admits  that  he used  Psilocybin  mushrooms,  with  varying
frequency,  from  1999  to  at  least  2022.  He  also  admits  that  he  used  cocaine,  with
varying frequency, from about 2003 to at least 2018.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Applicant stated that he began using marijuana in high school.  He typically used
it  at  social  gatherings,  concerts,  or  just  to  relax.  He  remembers  that  there  would  be
several  months  to  years  between  his  usage.  After  high  school  and  in  his  30’s,  he
developed  migraines,  and  was  having  problems  sleeping.  Between  2013-2015,  he
obtained  a  marijuana  medical  card,  and  purchased  and  possessed  marijuana  through
the state approved dispensaries.  During this period he would only use marijuana about
two to four times per month.  Since 2018, he has only used marijuana sporadically.  His
use  has  gone  from  weekly  to  every  other  month  and  then  by  mid-2020,  he  stopped
using it regularly.  From 2020-2022, he used marijuana only a couple of times.  His last
use  of  marijuana  occurred  in  March  2022,  which  was  on  a  birthday  camping  trip.
(Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Applicant has used MDMA on five separate occasions over a period of 23 years,
on a purely experimental basis.  He used it at social events, music events, and parties.
It was provided to him by friends at these events.  He last used MDMA at a New Years
Eve party on December 31, 2018.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Applicant has used LSD on two occasions.  He first used it in 1999, and last used
it  in  August  2019.  He  explained  that  both  occasions,  the  use  was  experimental  in
nature, and occurred at a music concert and house party.  He stated that during his last
use of LSD in August 2019, he micro-dosed the drug so small that he experienced no
high or mind effect at all.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Applicant has used Psilocybin mushrooms three times to feel the high effects of
this  mind-altering  drug.  He  used  it  in  an  intimate  controlled  situation,  at  a  house  or
while camping with friends.  He last used psilocybin mushrooms in June 2022.  (Tr. p.
24.)
Applicant  has  also  used  cocaine  on  five  occasions.  The  majority  of  this  use
occurred  between  the  ages  of  25-35  (3  times)  and  then  in  2016  and  2019.  He  used
cocaine either at house parties or at a New Years Eve party where it was offered to him
and not purchased.  He did not like the effects of the drug.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Applicant  explained  that  in  November  2017,  he  had  a  major  medical  problem
occur resulting from a chiropractic adjustment.  The injury caused recurrent  stroke-like
symptoms  over  a  period  of  five  days  resulting  in  a  life-saving  surgery.  Post-surgery,
Applicant  had  an  actual  stroke  that  left  him  physically  debilitated.  He  was  diagnosed
with PTSD and general anxiety due to this traumatic life changing event.  The results of
the stroke also caused speech issues, an inability to walk and difficulty with fine motor
skills.  Applicant had to learn these things all over again.  He was not sure if he would
ever be employable again.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B, and Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)
During his first year and a half of recovery, he experimented more than he ever
had.  Applicant researched several drugs to find that Psilocybin is a positive and proven
use  to  treat  PTSD  and  trauma,  and  traumatic  brain  injuries.  He  also  discovered  that
psychedelics  have been effective for depression, PTSD, and  anxiety.  As he  began to
improve,  and  with  the  help  of  occupational,  speech,  and  physical  therapy,  he  was
eventually able to rejoin the work force in 2020.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
When  Applicant  applied  for  a  security  clearance  in  September  2022,  he  listed
that his last use of marijuana was in April 2020.  He continued to use marijuana and last
used it in March 2022.  He also used psilocybin mushrooms as recently as June 2022.

Applicant  submitted  a  letter  of  intent  dated  January  9,  2024,  indicating  that  he
has  no  intent  to  use  any  “drug  or  substance”  with  the  punishment  to  be  automatic
revocation  of  his  security  clearance.  He  did  not  reference  the  fact  that  the  drug  or
substance  he  is  referring  to  in  this  letter  refer  to  those  drugs  or  substances  that  are
illegal, however, it will be assumed.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)
Several witnesses from the company testified on Applicant’s behalf, including the
Director of Security, the Manager of Industrial Security, and a close friend who works for
the same company.  Collectively, they consider Applicant to be honest and trustworthy
and  describe  him  as  an  upstanding  person.  They  recommend  him  for  a  security
clearance.  (Tr. pp. 16- 50.)

"Applicant  is  37  years  old.  He  is  married  and  has  one  young  child.  He  has  a
Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor
as  a  Lead  Electrical  Engineer.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in
connection with his employment.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant has a history of illegal drug use involving marijuana and/or other THC
products from 2006 through July 2023.  He began using marijuana as a sophomore in
college in 2006.  In 2009, campus security caught him using marijuana and he got into
trouble.  In 2010, he applied for a job and was hired contingent on passing the drug test.
The  drug  test  involved  both  a  urine  test  and  a  hair  test.  Applicant  failed  the  hair  test
because marijuana was detected.  (Tr. p. 27, and Applicant’s Exhibit B.)  Applicant was
not  hired  by  the  company.  At  this  point,  Applicant  decided  to  move  to  California  for
more freedom, and where he could obtain marijuana, and have life be more lenient.  (Tr.
p. 28.)
Applicant  continued  to  use  marijuana  consistently,  with  varying  frequency,  from
daily, weekly, to monthly.
(Tr. p. 28.)  He was employed as an Electrical Engineer for
company A, from 2012 to 2016.  He does not recall if they had a drug policy, but they
did not drug test him.  In 2016, he began working for company B, a defense contractor,
as an Electronic Engineer.  He completed a security clearance application dated July 5,
2016.  The application asked  if in the past year he has used any illegal drugs, and he
responded,  “NO.”  This  response  was  not  truthful.  Applicant  was  subsequently  drug
tested  and  passed.  (Government  Exhibit  3.)  After  he  was  hired,  he  continued  using
marijuana with varying frequency.  (Tr. p. 30.)  He was aware of the company’s no drug
tolerance  policy.  (Tr.  p.  31.)  He  stated,  however,  that  the  way  he  sees  it,  he  never
used drugs at work or showed up under the influence of marijuana.  (Tr. p. 31.)
In  March  2022,  Applicant  began  working  for his  current  employer,  Company  C.
He believes that at the time he was hired, the company did not have a drug policy, but
they  later  established  one.  They  have  been  obtaining  Government  contracts  and
Applicant  was  required  to  apply  for  a  security  clearance.  He  completed  the  security
clearance  application  on  January  6,  2023.  He  underwent  a  voluntary  drug  test  on
December  5,  2023,  and  on  January  22,  2024,  and  the  results  were  negative.
(Applicant’s  Exhibit  A,  and  Applicant’s  Post-Hearing  Exhibit  A.)  Despite  the  policy  at
Company C that prohibits all illegal drug use, Applicant continued to use marijuana and
last used it on July 15, 2023.  (Tr. p. 33, and Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)
Applicant stated that he is now trying to be open and transparent about his past
use  of  marijuana.  In  September  2023,  he  discussed  the  situation  with  his  supervisor
and since then, he has taken the matter seriously.  He stated that despite his marijuana
use, he is trustworthy.  He realizes that he must not use marijuana in the future, and he
is ready to let it go forever.  (Tr. p. 41.)
Applicant submitted a Personal Summary, wherein he indicates that he will never
use  or  possess  any  type  of  illegal  drug  in  the  workplace  or  on  any  federal  land  or
property  and  will  refrain  from  using  any  type  of  these  illegal  drugs  or  substances
indefinitely, however, he does not acknowledge that any future involvement or misuse is
grounds  for revocation of national security eligibility.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit
A.)  He also seems to qualify his non-use of illegal drugs to the workplace, or on federal
land or property, when Federal law prohibits the use of marijuana anywhere at any time.

"In his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Paragraph
1  of  the  SOR,  but  denied  the  factual  allegations  in  Paragraph  2  of  the  SOR,  with
explanations.
Applicant  is  46  years  old,  divorced,  and  has  one  child.  (GX  1  at  pages  5  and
18~19.) He has worked for a defense contractor since September of 2022.
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement
1.a.  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  January  1992
until his last usage  in August  of  2022,  about 15 months  prior to his hearing.  Applicant
has taken a drug test to confirm his abstinence. (AppX C.) Prior to his application for a
security  clearance,  Applicant’s  usage  was  “a  couple  times  a  week.”  Because  of  a
snowboarding accident,  Applicant had a “Medical Marijuana Prescription  in  California,”
but  since  applying  for  a  security  clearance,  he  treats  his  pain  with  “Ibuprofen.”  (TR  at
page 24 line 20 to page 28 line 15.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Applicant blames his past financial difficulties, including failure to file Federal and
state  income  tax  returns,  to  periods  of  unemployment  and  underemployment.  He  also
misunderstood  the  obligation  to  file  income  taxes,  thinking  that  he  had  withheld  more
than enough income to cover his income taxes that were due. (TR at page 30 line 21 to
page 32 line 19.)
2.a. Applicant has filed his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2015~2023,
as evidenced by those filings. (TR at page 30 line 21 to page 34 line 16, and AppXs A

"Applicant is a 23-year-old prospective employee of a government contractor. The
relevant  government  contractor  offered  him  a  job  in  June  2022  that  was  conditioned
upon  him  graduating  from  college  and  obtaining  a  security  clearance.  He  earned  an
undergraduate  degree  in  December  2022  with  a  3.69  grade  point  average  (GPA),
including  a  4.0  GPA  during  his  last  two  semesters.  He  has  never married  and  has  no
children. (Tr. 18-19, 25-26; GE 1, 2; AE D, E)
From  about  June  2021  until  about  March  2023,  Applicant  used  marijuana  with
varying frequency. He purchased it once from a dispensary in State A in June 2021. He
estimated  that  he  used  it  socially  with  friends  about  20  times  during  this  period.  At  all
times  relevant  to  this  security  clearance  investigation,  marijuana  purchase  and
possession  (and  therefore  its  use)  has  been  illegal  under  federal  law.  However,
pursuant to state laws in State A, where he resided while he used marijuana, its use has
been legal. In July 2022, while he was still in college, Applicant completed and certified
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF 86). He continued to use
marijuana for several months after completing the SF 86 and after his September 2022
security interview with a DOD investigator. (Tr. 17, 19-26, 32-35; Answer; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  stopped  using  marijuana  after  he  received
the  Government’s
interrogatories in March 2023, as he realized that marijuana use was incompatible with
holding a security clearance. Prior to then, he thought using marijuana was acceptable
because  it  was  legal  pursuant  to  the  laws  in  State  A,  because  he  had  not  started
working  for  a  government  contractor,  and  he  did  not  have  access  to  any  classified
information. While he used marijuana after being granted an interim security clearance,
he was not notified that he had earned one. (Tr. 17, 19-26, 32-35; Answer; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  now  understands  that  marijuana  is  not  compatible  with  holding  a
security clearance and will hinder his career development. Now that he is out of college,
he  has  shifted  his focus  to  obtaining  his first  post-college  job  and  being  a  responsible
adult. He also now understands that being involved with marijuana is illegal, regardless
of  what  state  laws  seem  to  indicate.  He  acknowledged  that  he  was  immature  and  did
not understand the seriousness of illegal drug use. He has no future intent to purchase,
possess,  or  use  marijuana  or  other  illegal  drugs  and  provided  a  signed  statement  of
intent  to  that  effect.  He  also  no  longer  associates  with  anyone  who  is  involved  with
illegal drugs. I observed him testify and found him to be credible. (Tr. 17, 24-30, 32-33;
Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A-C)
Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  a  January  2024  urinalysis  test  result  that  was
negative  for  several  illegal  drugs,  including  marijuana.  He  received  a  leadership  and
community engagement award from his university in the fall of 2022. He also provided
character-reference letters from a former work colleague and friends who wrote that he
is trustworthy, loyal, hardworking, and a leader. One  of these friends is a veteran who
holds a security clearance. All those who submitted character-reference letters believe
he  should be  entrusted  with  a  security clearance.  (Tr.  17,  24-30, 32-33;  Answer;  GE  1,

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c
and denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings
of fact.
Applicant is a 37-year-old business analyst employed by a federal contractor since
July  2020.  She  has  taken  college-level  courses  but  has  not  received  a  degree.  She
married in 2012 and divorced in 2021. She has three children, ages 16, 13, and 11.
Applicant  has  worked  for  federal  contractors  since  April  2006,  with  periods  of
unemployment  from  August  to  October  2011,  November  2018  to  February  2019,  and
January to July 2020. She has held a security clearance throughout this employment.
When Applicant submitted her SCA in February 2012, she answered “No” to the
question,  “In  the  last  seven  (7)  years,  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled
substances?”  (GX  1  at  42)  When  she  submitted  another  SCA  in  October  2021,  she
answered  “Yes”  to  the  same  question.  In  response  to  the  question  about  the  nature,
frequency, and number of times used, she stated, “It reduces my anxiety. Usage is once
a year at most.” She estimated that she first used it in May 2002 and that her most recent
use  was  in  October  2020.  When  asked  if  she  intended  to  use  it  in  the  future,  she
responded, “To reduce anxiety, no intent to use it again.” (GX 2 at 50-51)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in January 2022, she
admitted that she used marijuana from May 2002 to October 2020 “with various friends
and acquaintances,” such as a female friend and an ex-boyfriend. When she responded
to DOHA interrogatories in March 2023, she stated that her first use of marijuana was in
May 2002 and her last use was in October 2020. She described her frequency of use as
“rarely.” She stated that she did not intend to use it in the future. (GX 3 at 2-3)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that she was not sure why she did not disclose
her marijuana use in 2002 in her 2012 SCA. She testified that she used marijuana only
twice in her lifetime, once in 2002 and once in 2020. (Tr. 18, 22)  Her use in 2002 was
outside  the  seven-year  window for  the  question  in  the  SCA.  (Tr.  15)  She  was  only 16
years old at the time, and her 18-year-old sister, who lived in her own apartment, offered
her  marijuana.  After  Applicant’s  parents  found  out  about  her  marijuana  use,  they
prohibited her from going to her sister’s apartment. (Tr. 43) Applicant testified that, after
the incident with her older sister, she did not use it again, because she was playing sports,
went on to college, and then was raising children. (Tr. 43-44) She decided to disclose her
marijuana  use  in  her  2021  SCA,  even  though  she  knew  there  could  be  adverse
consequences, because she wanted “to be honest.” (Tr. 16)
Applicant testified that when she used marijuana in 2020, she was finalizing her
divorce, her children were at home because of COVID, and she was working at home. All
these circumstances caused her “a lot of anxiety,” and she thought the marijuana would
alleviate her anxiety, but it did not. (Tr. 20)
When   Applicant   used  marijuana   in 2020,  she   was  with   a   female friend   that  she
lived  with  for about  a  month  while  she  was going  through  her divorce and  her boyfriend
whom   she   had   dated   for  about  three   and   a   half  years.  Her  boyfriend   used   marijuana
regularly, and  he  provided  the  marijuana  that she  used  on  this  one  occasion  in 2020. (Tr.
31-33)   She   testified   that  her  boyfriend   usually  did  not  use   marijuana   in  her  presence,
because he  knew that she did not like  the  smell  and  how people  acted after using  it. (Tr.
34)  She  is no  longer involved  with  her marijuana-using  boyfriend. She  still  speaks  with
her female  friend, but she  has no  personal contact because  her friend moved  to  another
area. (Tr. 31)
At the hearing, Department Counsel cross-examined Applicant about her use of
the  word, “rarely,” in her response  to  DOHA interrogatories about the  frequency of her
marijuana  use. She  explained  that she  could  not say “never”  because  she  had  used  it
twice, and she did not say “frequent” because it would be incorrect, so she chose to say
she used it “rarely” because it was “a rare time” when she used it. (Tr. 22) She testified
that her description of her marijuana use was “just poorly worded.” (Tr. 37)
Applicant did not report her use of marijuana to her facility security officer (FSO).
She testified, “I knew it was an issue, but I didn’t know it was something that I had to go
report to my FSO.” (Tr. 34, 53) She is willing to submit to counseling or drug testing at
any time. (Tr. 42) She testified that she now deals with anxiety by exercising. (Tr. 27) She
has not sought any treatment from a medical professional for her anxiety. (Tr. 35)
When  Applicant  used  marijuana  in  October  2020,  she  held  an  active  secret
clearance, but her job did not involve handling classified materials. She testified that she
had not had access to classified information for a “very long time.” However, she holds a
public trust position and has access to sensitive information. (Tr. 45-47)
A former coworker submitted a letter attesting to Applicant’s dedication, attention
to  detail,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness.  (AX  A)  Applicant’s  close  friend  for  20  years
considers her a dedicated mentor, with exceptional judgment and “unwavering dedication
to  upholding  the  highest  standards  of  integrity,  honesty,  and  professionalism.”  (AX  B)
Applicant’s FSO, who is also her close friend, describes her as “a trustworthy and honest
person who is loyal to her work with the government.” (AX C)

integrity,  reliability,  and  kindness.  The  friend states that  Applicant  is  a  devoted mother

The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and

marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), and
the  use  of  prescription  drugs  not  prescribed  to  him  include  Adderall,  Vyvanse,
Tramadol, Vicodin and Xanax.  Applicant was hired by his current employer on July 8,
2021.  He  submitted  his  application  for  a  security  clearance  in  May  2022.  Applicant
admitted  to  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR  except  allegation  1.i.,
concerning the sale of marijuana.

stated  that  he  started  using  marijuana  in  college,  in  July  2015,  and  continued  using  it
until March 2022, consuming it about five to seven times a week.  (Tr. p. 38.)  Given the
seven years he has used marijuana, he admits to using it over 1,000 times.  (Tr. p. 63.)
He  would  normally  use  it  in  social  settings  with  his  friends.  During  the  years  he  used
marijuana he also purchased it about once or twice a month to supply his habit.  (Tr. p.
43.)
After beginning employment  with the defense  contractor,  Applicant continued to
use marijuana until March 2022.  He stated that he stopped using it because he became
aware  of  its  potential  security  implications  and  because  he  wanted  to  change  his
lifestyle.  Applicant  testified  from  his  personal  knowledge  that  there  are  people  at  his
company who use marijuana and who hold security clearances.  Applicant provided the
names of two of these employees.  (Tr. p. 72.)  He mentioned that there are others, but

April  2021.  He used cocaine in social  settings  with  his friends.  He  stated that he  did
not enjoy it.  He also used and purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms three times from
September  2016  to  about  March  2021.  He  did  not  particularly  enjoy  this  experience
either.  (Tr. p. 47- 48.)

occasions, once in March 2017, and again in May 2017.  He acknowledges that he was
young and naïve at the time.  He was outdoors in a nature setting or going on a hike at
the time he used it.  He stated that he did not really enjoy it, and he understood the risks
associated with the drug.
1.i.
Applicant  denied  that  he  ever  sold  marijuana.  However,  he  admitted  that  in
2017, on one occasion, he was the middleman responsible for taking the marijuana to a
friend of his, and then returning the money to another friend who owned the marijuana.
(Tr. p. 55-56.)  Applicant stated that he did not receive any money for his efforts.
Applicant used and purchased Xanax not prescribed to him on two occasions in
1.j.
about August 2015.

earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in 2005  and  a  master’s degree  in 2011. He has worked  for
his present employer, a federal contractor,  since January 2018. (Item  3; AE A)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2019. In it, he
disclosed he was granted a security clearance in 2013 by another agency. In March 2023,
he  completed  government  interrogatories.  He  disclosed  that  he  has  used  medical
cannabis in edible form from March 2022 to April 2, 2023, the date before he completed
the interrogatory response. He stated he intended to continue using the marijuana in the
future, acknowledging that it is illegal under federal law. He provided a certificate to show
he is permitted to use medicinal marijuana in his state, where it is legal. He provided a
statement that the medical marijuana is prescribed to him for a medical condition; that he
follows the recommended dosage; and he only uses it as prescribed for symptom relief.
He  uses  it  two  to  four  times  a  week,  usually  in  the  evening  before  going  to  bed.  He
provided a document showing that he first applied for a marijuana certificate in October
2021, and it was granted in December 2021. (Items 3, 4 5, 6)
In Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR, he  stated  that he  uses marijuana  for medical
reasons for a diagnosed health condition, and its use was recommended by his health
care  provider.  He  obtains  the  marijuana  legally  in  his  state  from  a  licensed  medical
cannabis dispensary. He intends to use the marijuana until his medical condition improves
and his doctor modifies his treatment plan. He is aware that his state’s laws conflict with
federal  law.  He  has  tried  other  medications  with  mixed  results  and  marijuana  has  a
positive impact on his health. He stated he hoped by self-reporting his use of marijuana
that  his  trustworthiness,  reliability,  and  good  judgment  would  not  be  in  question.  He
understood he may no longer be eligible for a security clearance but chooses to focus on
his personal health. (Item 2)
In his response to the FORM, Applicant  stated his intent when self-reporting his
marijuana  use  was  to  be  honest,  transparent,  and  responsible  because  he  takes  his

through online forums. Some of the individuals knew he worked for a federal contractor,
but  he  did  not  discuss  his  work.  He  believes  his  sexual  activities  were  related  to  his
childhood trauma. (Tr. at 18-19, 32-35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  used  marijuana  as  a  youth,  and  then  went  decades  without  using
marijuana.  He  resumed  his  use  in  about  September  2019,  about  the  same  time  he
became  involved  with  BDSM.  His  marijuana  use  was  also  connected  to  his  childhood
trauma.  A  friend  who  was  a  Vietnam  veteran  told  him  that  marijuana  helped  with  his
PTSD  symptoms.  Applicant  used  marijuana  in  various  forms  almost  every  night.  He
usually  used  it  alone,  but  he  also  used  it  occasionally  during  his  extramarital
encounters.  At  the  time,  medical  marijuana  did  not  violate  state  law,  but  recreational
marijuana had not yet become permitted under state law. Applicant knew that marijuana
use  violated  federal  law,  was  against  his  employer’s  drug-free  workplace  policy,  and
was  inconsistent  with  his  responsibilities  as  a  clearance  holder.  He  held  a  security
clearance at  the  time, but  he  did not have  access  to  classified  information.  He  initially
bought marijuana from individuals who received it from medical marijuana dispensaries.
After  his  state  law  changed  to  permit  recreational  marijuana  use,  he  bought  the
marijuana from dispensaries himself. (Tr. at 12, 18-27, 32, 42; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant  was  stopped  by  the  police  for  driving  through  a  red  light  in  late  May
2022. The police officer noted what appeared to be marijuana and paraphernalia in the
car.  After  a  sobriety  test,  the  police  drew  blood  to  be  tested,  and  charged  him  with
driving under the influence (DUI) of liquor, drugs, or vapors. Applicant stated that he had
nothing to drink. He used marijuana the night before but nothing the day he was driving.
He  stated  that  the  blood  test  detected  no  alcohol,  and  it  was  not  tested  for  THC.  The
charge was dismissed. (Tr. at 12, 24-25; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant  reported  his  DUI  charge  to  his  employer  about  two  days  after  the
incident.  The  description  he  provided  to  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  is  consistent
with his testimony and is accepted as fact. (Tr. at 12, 24-25; GE 3) The FSO reported
the incident to the DoD in an incident report that contained the following narrative:
[Applicant]  stated  that he  realizes that he  will  have  to  change  his approach
to   treatment  for  his   PTSD  as  long   as   cannabis  is  not   federally  legal.  He
has  been   through   two   years  of  therapy   and   is   now   much   improved.
[Applicant] stated that he went to a  meeting Friday night and  got a sponsor
and  plan[s]  to  do  a  treatment  intensive [sic] as soon  as he  can  arrange  it.
Employee will report future status.  (GE 3)
Applicant  continued  to  use  marijuana  for  about  two  weeks  after  he  reported
himself. He stated that it was difficult to stop immediately. He has not used any illegal
drugs  since  he  last  used  marijuana  in  June  2022.  He  informed  his  wife  about  his
marijuana use, his extramarital activities, and his involvement in BDSM shortly after his
DUI  arrest.  He  also  informed  people  at  work,  his  church,  and  his  family.  He  has  not
been involved in any extramarital activities since he told his wife. (Tr. at 13-14, 24-26,
34-41; Applicant’s response to SOR: GE 1, 2)
Applicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and
Sex  Addicts  Anonymous  (SAA)  meetings.  He  and  his  wife  receive  therapy  from  a
certified sex addiction therapist. Applicant is actively involved with an online community
of men who are in recovery; he attends in-person meetings once a week; and he sees a
counselor  once  a  week.  He  embraced  his  faith,  and  he  has  turned  to  meditation  and
prayer instead of sex and marijuana. He no longer associates with any of the individuals
with whom he used illegal drugs. (Tr. at 13-14, 27-31, 41; Applicant’s response to SOR:

Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF-86)  in
August 2022. He reported his marijuana use and his DUI arrest. He fully discussed his
marijuana  use  and  his  extramarital  activities  during  his  background  interview  in
February 2023. (GE 1, 2)
Applicant called a witness who has worked with him for about eight to nine years.
He described Applicant as “a very honest guy to a fault actually.” Applicant informed him

graduate. He has no military service. He is single and has no children. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  H  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  (THC)  with
varying frequency from January 2020 to June 2023. (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 3 at 20; Item 4 at
3-4, 8); and that Applicant intends to use marijuana in the future. (SOR ¶ 1.b: Item 4 at 7)
Applicant  listed  his  illegal  marijuana  use  on  his  July  2022  SCA  in  response  to
Section  23  - Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity.  He  estimated  he  used  marijuana
recreationally one or two times a month on the weekend. He uses it in social settings to
relax after the work week. He indicated his intent to use marijuana in the future. (Item 3

In response to DOHA Interrogatories, dated June 14, 2023, Applicant listed that
he used THC edibles on a weekly basis. The amount of THC in the edibles was 5 mg. He
intends  to  continue  to  use  THC  edibles  in  the  future.  He  indicated  his  state  legalized
edibles with 5 mg THC. He uses it to relax at night and to help him sleep. He has taken
THC edibles for over a year. He buys the edibles at stores in the area. They improve his
mood, help with body pain, improve his sleep, and reduce his anxiety. (Item 4 at 3-4) He
intends to continue his weekly use of THC edibles. (Item 4 at 7)
Applicant does not use drugs at work. His use of edibles on the weekend has not
affected  his  ability  to  do  his  job.  He  has  never  been  in  trouble  with  the  law  or  had
disciplinary issues. He claims low-dose THC has far more benefits than alcohol without
the hangovers. It does not affect his ability to keep national security a top priority. (Item 4

Applicant’s company has a Drug-Free Workplace Policy. The policy mentions that
all federal state and local laws must be followed. Even if Applicant’s state has legalized
the use of marijuana/THC, it remains illegal under federal law. (Item 4 at 9-14)

Applicant used marijuana when he was young, and then did not use it again for
an  extended  period.  He  started  smoking  marijuana  again  in  2015  in  a  state  where
marijuana possession and use did not violate state law. He used marijuana about 10 to
12 times between about January 2015 and August 2017. He did not work for a defense
contractor,  and  he  did  not  hold  a  security  clearance  at  the  time.  (Tr.  at  34-35;

Applicant  went  to  work  for  a  defense  contractor  (not  his  current  employer)  in
February  2018.  He  applied  for  a  security  clearance,  and  it  was  granted  in  about  May
2019. The Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) he submitted to obtain
his clearance is not in evidence, but Applicant stated that he submitted one, and he was
interviewed  for  his  background  investigation.  He  reported  his  marijuana  use  and
discussed  it  during  his  background  interview.  He  admitted  at  his hearing  that  he  likely
told the investigator that he would not use marijuana while holding a security clearance.

Applicant  moved  to  another  state  to  accept  his  current  job  with  a  defense
contractor  in  2021.  Marijuana  possession  and  use  does  not  violate  state  law  in  this
state.  His  security  clearance  transferred  with  him.  His  employer  has  a  drug-free
workplace policy. He used marijuana about six times between about January 2022 and
June  2022.  He  held  a  security  clearance  at  the  time,  but  he  did  not  have  access  to
classified  information.  He  was  going  through  a  stressful  time  with  the  move  to  a  new

possession violated federal law, but he justified the use to himself by the fact that it did
not violate state law. (Tr. at 30-31, 36-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE H)

state law. He had a prescription and license for its use because of a variety of medical
conditions.  He renews his marijuana license annually. (Item 5 at 3.) He states his usage
depends on pain triggers, which occurred a few times a month. His use takes place at
home,  and  he  used  a  variety  of  forms  of  marijuana.  He  states  the  reason  he  did  not
disclose on his SCA that he had bought illegal drugs was because he misunderstood the
question and thought since he was buying it in a state where it was legal and that he had
a license and prescription he did not have to report it. (Item 5 at 4.)
In  his  response  to  Government  interrogatories,  Applicant  said  his  prescription
began in 2012 and his last use was in February 2023. (Item 4 at 4.) He added that he did
not use marijuana unless he was in pain. (Item 4 at 4.) He said that he planned to continue
to use marijuana to mitigate his pain, but he added his use could be stopped if it hindered
his security clearance and he cited other medication he would use. (Item 4 at 4, 10.)

"Applicant admitted the sole SOR allegation. Her admission is incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2004. She married in
2006 and divorced in 2018. She has 17-year-old child from the marriage. She is being
sponsored for a security clearance for the first time. (Item 3)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in  March 2023. In it
she disclosed her drug use. She indicated that she uses “THC (such as marijuana, weed,
pot, hashish, etc.” She stated: “I have an active medical marijuana card for the state of
[X].” She estimated she began using marijuana in March 2022 and her most recent use
was March 2023. She further disclosed:
I have  anxiety,  and  it is  at its peak when  I’m  trying  to  fall  asleep. My doctor
recommended   trying   medical  marijuana,  as  I  have   tried   medication,
reading, exercises, melatonin, etc. I use the  medical marijuana before bed,
and  it has been  a  great help. I have  not used  marijuana  outside  of the  use
under the medical marijuana card.
I plan to continue use  before bed as a sleep  aid, I am willing to  discontinue
use   and   not   renew  my  medical  marijuana   card  if  that  will   help  me
obtain/maintain security clearances.  (Item  3)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in May 2023. In August
2023,  she  verified  the  accuracy  of  her  summary  of  interview  and  did  not  make  any
changes or additions. She confirmed that she continues to use  medicinal marijuana to
help her sleep. She uses at home and has a valid prescription. It does not violate state
law where she lives. She has never participated in drug counseling. She said she does
not associate or socialize with individuals who use illegal drugs. She is likely to continue
to use marijuana as she prefers natural prescriptions as a sleep aid but is willing to figure
out another avenue if it is required to obtain and maintain a security clearance. (Item 4)
As  part  of  her  interrogatories,  Applicant  was  asked  if  she  continued  to  use  any
controlled  substance  since  her  background  interview  in  May  2023.  She  indicated  she
continued to use medical marijuana nightly since then. She purchases it in her state where
it does not violate state law. In response to whether she intended to use this drug in the
future, she stated: “will cease use if required to do so to obtain a clearance.” (Item 4)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted she uses medicinal marijuana on
the recommendation of her doctor to help her sleep. She further stated:
I have  stated,  and  I  maintain, that  I  will  forfeit/destroy  my [State  X]  medical
marijuana  certification  to  be  in compliance  with  U.S. Government  security
clearance  if so  required. I am  a  responsible, law-abiding  citizen, and  have
never/would never use any medication outside of its intended use. Outside
of medical  marijuana, I  have  never engaged  in  illegal drug  use,  or misuse
of any controlled substance.

I take my career seriously and  would not  engage  in behavior that  would be
detrimental to  the company I worked for, or my own reputation.

contractor from March 2005 through May 2016. (GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 12, 30-35)
Applicant testified he has completed a total of three SCAs since he began working
with  defense  contractors:  in  2002,  2012,  and  2022.  He  has  held  a  secret  security
clearance since 2002. In March 2004, he signed a DOD nondisclosure agreement. During
his testimony, he acknowledged participating in regular security clearance briefings, and
training required to maintain his secret security clearance. He stated he is seeking a top-
secret  security  clearance  to  enhance  his  professional  opportunities  as  a  program
engineer.  He testified he  routinely  participates  in  classified meetings  as  part  of his  job
responsibilities since at least 2016, and he verified he works in a sensitive position. (GE

Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant purchased and used marijuana with
varying  frequency  from  January  2016  through  October  2022  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  after  being
granted access to classified information or while holding a sensitive position (SOR ¶ 1.b);
and that he intended to use marijuana in the future (SOR ¶1.c).
In  his March 2022  SCA, Applicant  denied  he  illegally used  or purchased  any drugs
or  controlled   substances   in   his  March   2022   SCA   (SOR   ¶¶   2.a   -  2.c).   Specifically,   he
answered  “no” in response to  three  questions  in Section  23, Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug
Activity, which  asked  whether, in  the  last  seven  years, he  had:  (1) illegally used  any drugs
or  controlled   substances;   (2)  illegally  purchased,  received,   handled,  etc.,   any  drug   or
controlled  substance,  and;  (3)  whether  he  had  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been
illegally involved with drugs while possessing a security clearance. (GE 1 pp. 31-32)
During his April 2022 investigative interview, Applicant, after being administered
an oath, was asked whether he had used any illegal drugs in the past seven years, to
which he responded “yes.” He first disclosed he purchased and used “chocolate edible”
marijuana in January 2022 while vacationing in a South American country. He stated he
consumed one marijuana edible per day over the course of five days during the trip. Next,
he disclosed he smoked marijuana in March 2021 after the funeral of a beloved relative.
He  stated  other persons  provided  him  with  the marijuana  on that occasion;  he did  not
purchase it himself. (GE 3 pp.3, 5-6; Tr. 36-39)
Applicant then summarized his pattern of marijuana use to the investigator, stating
he  used  marijuana  recreationally  about  twice  a  year  since  2016,  typically  on  special
occasions like birthdays or big events. He described feeling relaxed, and less anxious or
socially awkward after consuming marijuana. When the investigator asked why he did not
disclose  his  marijuana  use  in  his  SCA,  he  stated  he  “just  forgot  about  it.”  When  the
investigator asked about his future intent concerning marijuana use, he stated he would
still use it, but would reserve his use to when he was in a safe environment. He further
stated he would not let marijuana compromise the quality of his job;  and that he would
not  become  dependent  upon  it.  Applicant  confirmed  to  the  investigator  that  he  knew
marijuana was federally illegal, as discussed infra. (GE 3 pp. 5-6; Tr. 36-39, 55-60)
In his November 2022 response to government interrogatories, Applicant provided
more details about his marijuana involvement. He disclosed the exact date, place, and
occasion  he  first  used  marijuana:  on  January  23,  2016,  in  State  1,  to  celebrate  his
birthday. He last used marijuana on October 29, 2022, in State 2, to celebrate Halloween
weekend events. He stated he purchased marijuana edibles a few times a year from a
local smoke shop near his residence in State 2. He last purchased marijuana on October
28,  2022,  the  day  before  his  Halloween  weekend  events.  During  his  testimony,  he
described his marijuana use as sporadic and stated he probably used it less than 25 total
times  during  the  six-year  period.  He  reiterated  that  he  used  marijuana  in  “safe”
environments like his home, with a brother, cousins, or others he trusted. (GE 3 pp. 5-14;
Tr.  39- 47)  When  asked  when,  if  ever,  he  had  decided  to  stop  using  marijuana,  he
responded:
I suspend  use  of (marijuana) during  work hours or when  I don’t feel safe.
Last  use   was  Halloween   weekend   (10/29/2022).  Can   and   will   stop   if
required  to  maintain  clearance  and/or perform  work duties responsibly.  (GE
3 at 10)
When asked the reason he decided to use marijuana in January 2016 in the first
place, Applicant stated:
The  national  conversation  around  THC and  marijuana,  especially  in  (State
1), had  come  to  a  place  where a  lot  of the  stigma  had  been  dying  down.  It
was easily accessible, and  when  I say easily accessible,  I don't mean  that I
bought it. I mean  that people around  me  would  use  it.  And  I made  a  decision,
on  my  birthday,  safe  in  my  home, with  people  I trusted  that, okay,  I guess,
I'll  give this a shot.  … It had been decriminalized in (State 1).  (Tr. 36-37)
Applicant also testified that COVID-19 presented lots of stressors and challenges
for him. He eventually became the caretaker of his mother who has dementia, and who
currently resides with him. He stated that, although he was in counseling while living in
another state, he had not been successful at finding a counselor in his current state of
residence,  primarily,  because  he  wanted  a  counselor  to  work  with  him  in-person  vice
online. (Tr. 72-74)
Applicant testified he was well-educated on the federal illegality of marijuana in the
United States. When asked whether he ever had any reason to believe marijuana was
ever federally legalized, he responded:
I had  reason  to  believe  that it  wasn't as severe. And  when  I say  reason  to
believe,   it   doesn't  mean   I  was  right,   it   just  means   that  this  was  the
impression  that I was  getting  from  the  climate  of  the  country that, in  other
words, it would be  possible  to  assess one's capability to  hold a  clearance
and   be   a   responsible,   contributing   member  to   this  United   States  society,
even if they've used  marijuana.  (Tr. 49-50)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  the  investigator  asked  whether  he  knew
marijuana  was  still  classified  as  a  Schedule  I  drug,  to  which  he  responded,  “I  do.”  He
stated his conversation with the investigator ended on that point, and that, looking back,
he wished the investigator had told him to stop using marijuana. He explained his belief
that the investigator’s verification of his knowledge about the federal illegality of marijuana
to  him  meant  that,  if  he  was  being  responsible  while  using  marijuana,  this  was  okay.
Applicant was aware of his employer’s drug policy prohibiting the use of illegal drugs, and
stated he was subject to random drug urinalysis testing as  a condition of employment.
When asked if he was concerned about being randomly drug tested, he said “no” he was
not concerned.  (Tr. 55-60)
The  language  at the  beginning  of Section  23, Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug  Activity,
instructs applicants  on  the  scope  and  context  of  questions  asked  in  the  section.  It  reads
in pertinent part:  “The  following  questions pertain to  the  illegal use  of  drugs or controlled
substances  or drug  or  controlled  substance  activities in accordance  with  Federal laws,
even   though   permissible  under  state   laws   (emphasis  added).”  Applicant  testified   he
overlooked  this language  when  he  completed  his SCA. He stated  he  denied  allegations
in SOR ¶¶  2.a  –  2.c  because  he  did  not believe  his use  and  purchase  of marijuana  on
various  occasion   were   illegal   at   the   time   he   completed   his  SCA.  He   asserted   such
activities  had   been   decriminalized   in  State   1   and   State   2   at  the   time   he   used   and
purchased  marijuana. However, Applicant did  not provide  a  copy  of,  nor did he  reference,
the laws in State 1 and State 2 that he proclaimed legalized or de-criminalized his drug
activities during the relevant periods in each state. Towards the end of his testimony at
the hearing, Applicant requested to change his answer regarding his intent to continue
using marijuana, to state that he “would just discontinue use.” He further commented “it’s
not worth losing my job over, or my clearance. I’m not going to die on this hill.” (GE 1 at
31; Tr. 59-65)
Applicant  made  inconsistent  statements  concerning  his  failure  to  disclose  his
illegal drug use or drug activities in his March 2022 SCA. In his April 2022 interview, he
told  the  investigator  he  “just  forgot  about  it.”  In  his  SOR  response  and  during  his
testimony, he asserted he did not disclose his illegal drug use or drug activities because
he believed his activities were not illegal. During the hearing, he repeatedly commented
on his desire to be honest. (GE 3 at 3; Tr. 14, 53-56, 62, 69-72)
Applicant testified he was highly successful at work. He stated he was generally
rated in the “B-range,” exceeding expectations. He received on the spot awards for work
performed  in  2002  and  2021,  but  stated  that  he  was  just  doing  his  job  but  something
“stuck out.” (Tr. 74-78)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  the  sole  SOR  allegation  in  his  Answer.  He  is  36  years  old,
married, and he has a one-year-old child. He graduated from high school in 2006 and he
earned a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering in 2012 and a master’s degree in
2016. He worked as a DOD contractor from 2012 to 2015, when he was hired as a DOD
civilian. Since March 2022, he has worked as a senior professional staff member for his
employer,  another  DOD  contractor.  He  conducts  artificial  intelligence  research  and
engineering for combat-related platforms, a position that requires a security clearance.
He was first granted a clearance in 2015. (Tr. 6, 19-33, 50-53, 80-81, 84-85; GE 1-3; AE
H)
Applicant used marijuana on three occasions from April 2021 to December 2021,
while he was granted access to classified information. (SOR ¶ 1.a) On each occasion, he
was at a social gathering and he had consumed alcohol. In the spring of 2021, he was at
a friend’s party and he ate a portion of a marijuana brownie. In the fall of 2021, he was at
a  party  and  he  took  one  puff  of  a  marijuana  cigarette  that  was  passed  around  by  his
spouse’s friend. On the third occasion, he was out of state at a New Year’s party hosted
by his in-laws and he took one puff of a marijuana cigarette that was passed around by
his brother-in-law. (Tr. 33-41, 53-78, 83-84; GE 1-2; AE B-C)
These were the only occasions in which Applicant used marijuana. He described
his use as experimental in nature, and he regretfully did not consider the implications that
his  marijuana  use  would  have  on  his  security  clearance.  Although  he  did  not  access
classified  information  as  part  of  his  day-to-day  job  duties,  he  acknowledged  that  he
attended optional, classified seminars between April 2021 and December 2021 and his
security clearance enabled him to do so. (Tr. 33-41, 53-78, 83-84; GE 1-2; AE B-C)
Applicant did not think to report his marijuana use until he voluntarily disclosed it
on his March 2022 security clearance application (SCA). He did so, despite the potential
consequences  on  his security  clearance,  because  he  wanted  to  be  honest.  He  further
discussed it in his December 2022 response to interrogatories. He took responsibility for
his marijuana use. He also acknowledged that he violated federal law and the rules and
regulations  governing  individuals  with  security  clearances,  having  received  annual
security trainings since 2015. (Tr. 41-50, 52, 68, 71-80, 83; GE 1-2; AE B-C)
Applicant stated that his marijuana uses were extraordinary lapses of judgment.
He  stated  that  it  permanently  stained  his  personal  integrity  and  he  is  committed  to
rehabilitation.  He  voluntarily  completed  a  drug  and  alcohol  education  course  in  March
2022. He also voluntarily submitted to drug screens, testing negative for marijuana and
other illegal drugs, in April 2022, November 2022, February 2023, April 2023, July 2023,
and  October  2023.  He  also  chose  to  stop  consuming  alcohol  in  the  summer  of  2023,
because he felt that his alcohol use contributed to his poor decision-making in 2021. He
has  no  intention  of using  marijuana  in the  future. (Tr. 41-50, 52, 68,  71-80, 83; GE  1-2;
AE B-C)
Applicant does not socialize with anyone involved with drugs. His spouse is aware
of his marijuana use. They are  committed  to  Applicant’s decision  to  refrain from illegal
drug use. He also informed his family and friends of his intent to refrain from any illegal
drug use and they are supportive of his decision. If he were to find himself in a situation
where  illegal  drugs  are  being  used,  he  would  leave.  In  December  2022,  he  signed  a
statement of intent to never use any illegal drugs in the future and that any violation would
result in him losing his security clearance. (Tr. 46-47, 61-62, 65-68, 71-73, 81-83; GE 2;
AE A)
In  addition  to  Applicant’s  impressive  educational  background,  he  has  made
valuable contributions as an aerospace engineer since he first started working as a DOD
contractor in 2012. He was awarded for his exceptional work in 2012, 2018, 2019, and
2022. He is an esteemed member of his team, as evidenced by his stellar performance
evaluations  from  2016  to  2021.  He  also  continues  to  contribute  to  his  community.  He
provided numerous letters of support from close friends, colleagues, a former supervisor,
and former colleagues, some of whom were aware of his past marijuana use. All of these
individuals vouched for his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. (GE 2; AE D-G)

"Applicant is a 28-year-old industrial engineer with a defense contractor. She has
worked for the company since 2018. She is single. Applicant has a bachelor of science
degree.  She  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security  clearance  granted  in  approximately  March
2019 in connection with her work with the DoD. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12,
13A, 17, and 25.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  she  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  five  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
1.a.   Applicant  admitted  purchasing  and  using  marijuana  with  various  frequency
from approximately 2013 to at least April 2022.
The  evidence  is  mixed  as  to  how  many  times  Applicant  used  marijuana.  She
testified that she believed she used marijuana about 20 times, with the period of greatest
use being between 2019 and 2022. However, she also testified that she was unclear as
to the number of times she used it. (Tr. 47-48.)
Applicant later testified  concerning  her marijuana  use, “I would  say three  to  four
times a month maybe at the most with that not being the case every month. I previously
mentioned  that  from  maybe  2020  to  2021  it  was  a  little  bit  more  regular  just  with  the
situation  of  the  pandemic.”  She  further  testified  that  she  would  purchase  marijuana  at
various legal marijuana dispensaries less than five times a year during the same period.
She was unable to quantify her use of marijuana any further. (Tr. 50-51, 79-81, 88.)
In  Applicant’s 2022  e-QIP  (Government Exhibit  1 at Section 25) she  stated that
she intended to continue to use marijuana in the future. She has since stated that she no
longer  has  an  intention  to  use  marijuana  or  any  other  drugs.  She  further  submitted  a
signed  statement  of  intent  not  to  use  or  be  involved  with  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.
(Applicant Exhibit I; Tr. 52-53.)
1.b. Applicant admitted using hallucinogenic mushrooms twice. Once in 2015 and
the second time in 2022. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 25; Tr. 54, 78-79.)
1.c. Applicant admitted using cocaine approximately ten times between April 2019
and March 2022. She admitted that she used cocaine after being employed and having
a security clearance because, “I wanted to try it.” She further testified that she did think
about the fact she held a security clearance at the time she was using it, but that fact did
not stop her. She indicated that she now knows her judgment was not sound at that time.
Finally, she admitted about her use of cocaine, “I liked  the  experience.” (Tr. 57-58, 78,
81-82, 88-89.)
1.d. Applicant admitted using illegal stimulants such as ecstasy about five times
between February 2021 and March 2022. (Tr. 58-59, 79, 82.)
1.e.   As  stated,  Applicant  received  a  security  clearance  in  March  2019.  A
substantial  portion  of  drug  use  history  as  described  above  occurred  during  the  period
after she received her security clearance. She felt that her drug use before 2022 while
holding a security clearance was not impactful on her job. She now states that this belief
was wrong. (Tr. 78-79, 90-91.)
Applicant has stated  that she  has no  intent of using  marijuana  or other illegal drugs
in the  future. She  testified  that one  of the  reasons she  has stopped  using  drugs was,  “I
would say it’s not worth  the  fun.” She  further  stated  that drug  use  no  longer aligns with
her  values.  She   has  taken   several  steps  to   assure  the   Government  that  she   is  being
proactive  in preventing  a  future  problem. Applicant has  taken  courses  in drug  and  alcohol
awareness,  behavior  modification,  and   marijuana   education.  She   has  taken   several
negative  drug  tests. (Applicant  Exhibits H, J, K, L,  and  N;  Tr. 64, 71-72, 74-75, 86,  91-
92.)
Applicant received an evaluation  dated February 15, 2023, from a psychologist.
The  report  covered  the  area  of  drug  abuse.  (Applicant  Exhibit  M.)  He  conducted  a
thorough examination of Applicant that included an interview, various psychological tests,
and review of relevant documentation. The psychologist opined, “Psychological testing
suggested  she  [Applicant]  is  free  of  indicators  of  substance  use  problems  and  clinical
interview and observation confirmed the same.” (Applicant Exhibit M at 5; Tr. 64.)
As stated, Applicant has also submitted a signed statement of intent “not to use or
be  involved with illegal drugs in the  future.” The  statement also  declared that Applicant
understood  that  such  involvement “may be  grounds for revocation or denial of national
security eligibility.” (Applicant Exhibit I.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because she has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or
unreliability.  Applicant  admitted  both  the  allegations  under  this  paragraph  with
explanations.
2.a. Applicant filled out her initial e-QIP in September 2018. (Government Exhibit
the
2.) Section 23 of the questionnaire asked about her drug use history. Specifically,
question asked whether she had used controlled substances during the previous seven
years. She stated, “No.” This was a false answer to a relevant question about Applicant’s
drug use history. (Tr. 77-78.)
Applicant testified that she gave a false answer because:
I was scared.  I  was immature, I saw that  as  are you  a  serious  drug, do  we
have   a   problem,   and   I   had   barely  used   marijuana   in  the   past  and   I  had
barely, I  don’t think  I ever felt  a  high.  It  was more  of  a  social thing  to  fit  in
that  I had  done   it,  and   so   I  didn’t  feel the   need   to  disclose   it  and   have   it
impact me, and I was scared. And I know that was wrong. (Tr. 67.)
Applicant filled out a second e-QIP in May 2022. (Government Exhibit 1.) She was
more forthcoming about her use of illegal drugs on that document and in a subsequent
interview. (Government Exhibit 4.) She testified that between 2018 and 2022 she did not
tell anyone at her employer about her drug use history. (Tr. 68-69.)
2.b.  The  Government alleges in  this subparagraph  that the  Applicant’s drug  use
history  after  being  granted  a  security  clearance,  as  set  forth  under  subparagraph  1.e,
above, is also cognizable under Guideline E.
Mitigation
Applicant’s  direct  supervisor  testified  on  her  behalf  and  provided  a  written
statement. His recent evaluation of Applicant was also provided. He has known her since
she began work for her employer in 2018, and has been her supervisor for a little over a
year as  of the date  of the  hearing.  He  has a  security  clearance and  is knowledgeable
about the allegations in the SOR. He testified that Applicant is a person of integrity and
trustworthiness,  that  she  is  one  of  his  top  performers,  and  that  he  continues  to  have
confidence in her. He recommends her for a position of trust. (Applicant Exhibits C at 2
and P; Tr. 19-42.)
Additional  letters  of  recommendation  were  submitted  by  two  coworkers  and
Applicant’s former manager. Each of them has known Applicant for about a year. All of
them  have  knowledge  of  the  allegations  in  this  case.  They  all  state  that  Applicant  is
trustworthy  and  believable.  They  find  her  to  be  a  hard-working  person  of  integrity  and
recommend her for a position of trust. (Applicant Exhibits C at 1, 3 and N.)
Applicant is viewed as an excellent performer by her employer in her most recent
annual  evaluation.  She  has  repeatedly  received  recognition  for  her  job  performance.

"Applicant,  through  counsel,  admitted  the  sole  allegation  alleged  under  SOR  ¶
1.a,  with  explanations.  (SOR  Answer)  His  admission  is  incorporated  or  adopted  as  a
finding of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Background Information
Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  senior  acquisition  specialist   two   employed  by  a
defense contractor since October 2017. (GE  1; Tr.  11-13) He  is a first-time applicant  for
a secret  security clearance. Obtaining a clearance would enhance  his employability  and
upward mobility  within  his company.  (GE 1; Tr. 13-14, 18, 52-53)
Applicant  received   his   high  school   diploma  in   1986.  He   was  awarded  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  international   business  in   2006,   and   was  awarded   a  master’s
degree in   system  engineering in 2011.  (GE 1;  Tr.  14-15)  Applicant  married in  January
1997, and  has an adult son and  an adult daughter;  both are currently attending college
and  live at home. Applicant’s wife  is a  homemaker and  assists the elderly on a part-time
volunteer basis through their local church.  (GE 1; Tr. 16-18, 58-59)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR  ¶  1.a   alleged   that  Applicant   used  marijuana/THC  with  varying  frequency
from   1980  to  at  least  April  2019.  (SOR)   Applicant  was  introduced  to  marijuana  as  a
teenager  while  growing  up  in   a  large  metropolitan  area  on  the  East  Coast.   Marijuana
was  readily  available   in   Applicant’s  neighborhood  and  “was  part  of  the  community  or
environment.” Applicant’s marijuana  usage  transitioned from  teenage  peer pressure to  a
coping mechanism to deal with an anxiety disorder. To cope with  his anxiety disorder,
Applicant estimated that he used  marijuana “about two or three times a  week” during a
40-year span. (Tr. 19-23, 45, 61)
Applicant did not seek professional help to deal with his anxiety disorder until his
early  30s  in  the  1995  to  1996  timeframe.  His  doctor  at  the  time  prescribed  Klonopin,
which  was  prescribed  to  him  to  alleviate  the  “heavy  brain  activity  [he]  experienced,
which  overwhelmed  [his]  thought  process  and  created  the  physiological  changes  that
were  very  uncomfortable  to  deal  with  and  manage  through  this  anxiety  disorder.”  (Tr.
23-24,  34,  67-68)  Over  time,  Applicant  learned  that  Klonopin  had  some  undesirable
long-term side effects such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease and proved to be more
addictive  than  marijuana.  In  consultation  with  his  doctor,  he  reduced  his  Klonopin
dosage.  For  example,  Applicant’s  prescription  indicated  a  consumption  rate  of  two
tablets  a  day;  however,  he  took  Klonopin  on  average  two  days  a  week.  His  usage
depended on work demands such as making a presentation. Applicant stated Klonopin
physiologically reduces brain activity and allows him to breath. By doing so, he is able to
formulate better  planning. Marijuana had  “very similar effects  in  some form or  fashion.”
When  Applicant  used  marijuana,  he   did  so  by  smoking  it   during  the  evenings  in   the
privacy  of  his  home.  No   one   in  Applicant’s  immediate  family  uses  marijuana.  After
marijuana was legalized in  his state of residence, he obtained  a marijuana card in  about
2011  and  purchased  marijuana  at  state-sanctioned  dispensaries.  Before  that,   he
obtained  marijuana from individuals with similar needs. (Tr. 24-26, 34-42, 44, 59-63, 65,
69)
Overcoming Applicant’s  anxiety  disorder  was  a process  that occurred over time
and involved shifting from prescription drugs or marijuana to a faith-based platform. He
became involved with his church and its men’s  bible study group. Applicant explained,
“So,  I  made  a  promise  to  my  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  I  communicated  to  him  that  I
wanted  to  get  away  from  these  artificial  medications  and  work  and  build  an
infrastructure that would help me with his grace, mercy and love on my life, to help me
establish something better than I had tried to establish.” He found his bible study peers
to  be  excellent  role  models,  role  models  he  never  had  growing  up.  (Tr.  27-28)  In
addition  to  his  men’s  bible  study  group,  Applicant  is  involved  in  other  aspects  of  his
church’s ministry such as hospitality and ushering, and feeding and providing clothing to
the  homeless.  He  also  assists  with  a  local  community  project  rebuilding  schools  and
provides assistance where needed. (Tr. 27-29)
Applicant  made  his  commitment  to  stop  using  marijuana  and  become  sober  on
April 21, 2019, Easter Sunday. He stated:
I made a deep, deep commitment to my Father in heaven that I was going
to  pursue  this  [with]  even  more  diligence;  with  more  firmer  [resolve],  you
know, that I was serious and that I needed His help and I needed Him to
guide me, to provide me with the wisdom to interface me with the people
that I needed to build this infrastructure that, in my mind, was to alleviate
me from having to medicate with these medications. (Tr. 29-30, 45-46, 59)
In  addition  to  a  faith-based  platform,  Applicant  pursues  a  regimen  of  good
nutrition and exercise. He has been seeing a forensic psychologist on a frequent basis
since  June  2020,  and  remains  open  to  seeking  help,  as  needed.  His  psychologist
prepared  an  extensive  substance  abuse  evaluation,  discussed  below.  Applicant  also
attended  Narcotics  Anonymous  in  August  or  September  2020,  it  is  now  almost  two
years after he stopped using marijuana. He did so to reinforce his infrastructure to stay
on  a  path  of  sobriety.  (Tr.  30-31,  42-52)  Applicant  credibly  testified  that  he  can  be
trusted  to  no  longer  use  marijuana.  He  referred  to  his  proven  career  track  record  of
dependability  and  reliability  with  his  colleagues  and  client  customers.  He  has  always
given  them  advice  and  service  to  the  best of  his  ability.  Applicant  is very  proud  of  the
service he provides to the country and hopes to continue that service. In short, he wants
to  leave a legacy that  he did what  he needed to  do for  his  family,  friends,  colleagues,
and society. (Tr. 31-33)
Applicant completed his security clearance application on October 30, 2017, after
he  began  his  employment  with  his  current  company.  He  disclosed  his  past  marijuana
use  on  that  application.  When  he  applied  for  a  position  with  his  current  employer,  the
requirement  to  have  a  security  clearance  was  not  clear.  Applicant  had  no  experience
with the security clearance process during his previous 25-plus years in the aerospace
industry.  (Tr.  53-55)  During  Applicant’s  November  20,  2018,  Office  of  Personnel
Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI), he informed the investigator of his
marijuana  use  up  until  the  time  of  his  OPM  PSI.  His  use  of  marijuana  continued  for
about six months after that interview. Applicant stated this marijuana use was on an “as
needed” basis, that he was not dependent on marijuana, and  that its use was a “more
natural way to medicate.” (Tr. 55-56; GE 2)
When  Applicant  realized  that  using  marijuana  was  incompatible  with  holding  a
security  clearance,  he  realized  “marijuana  had   to   go.”  (Tr.   40)  Applicant’s   OPM   PSI
definitely  had  an  impact  on  him.   With   coordinated   treatment  from  his  health  care
professionals as well  as support  received  from his faith-based men’s bible  study group,
Applicant  was able to bridge the gap  that marijuana provided  in dealing with his anxiety
disorder. (Tr. 56-57)
Applicant  does  not  associate  with  anyone  who  uses  marijuana.  Applicant
understands  that  any  use  of  illegal  drugs   is  not  tolerated  at  his  workplace   or  while
holding  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  63-64)   This  is  the   first  time  in   Applicant’s  working
career that he encountered a zero  tolerance drug-free policy as it applies to the security
clearance  process. (Tr. 70)  Applicant submitted three negative drug tests  dated October
7, 2020;  September 11, 2020;  and August 21, 2019. (Tr. 70-71; AE A, AE B, AE C)
Of  particular  note  is  a  comprehensive  Substance  Abuse  Evaluation  dated
November  9,  2020  that  Applicant  submitted.  The  report  was  prepared  by  a  very  well
credentialed forensic psychologist (Ph.D.), who has significant experience in evaluating
security  clearance  applicants  under  the  auspices  of  the  CIA,  NSA,  and  DOD.  Ph.D.
diagnosed Applicant with a Social Anxiety Disorder (DSM-5 300.23). Ph.D. did not give
Applicant  a  diagnosis  of  Cannabis  Use  Disorder.  He  explained  that  Applicant  did  not
meet any of the 11 criteria for a substance use disorder, and added that Applicant “used
cannabis  as  an  alternative  to  the  benzodiazepine  prescription  he  received  for  his
anxiety  disorder  for  many  years.”  Ph.D.  stated,  “To  a  great  degree  of  psychological
certainty, I have concluded that [Applicant] is free from any problems of drug or alcohol
use and pose[s] no risk to the national security as a result of his prior usage.” (Tr. 71-72;
AE D)
In  addition  to  Ph.D.’s  Substance  Abuse  Evaluation,  Applicant  submitted  a  letter
from  his  licensed  marriage  and  family  therapist  (LMFT)  dated  November  11,  2020.
LMFT stated Applicant has been under her care since June 28, 2020, with a diagnosis
of  Anxiety  Disorder  (F41.9)  in  order  to  increase  his  coping  and  to  get  support  for  his
sobriety  from  cannabis.  She  noted  that  Applicant  has  shown  high  motivation,  insight,
and  dependability  in  a  consistent  manner.  (Tr.  72-73;  AE  E)  Applicant  submitted  a
signed, sworn statement of intent, dated October 23, 2020, to avoid any future drug use
or other illegal use of drugs both presently and in the future, with the understanding that
any drug violation will result in the automatic revocation of clearance. (AE F) Applicant
submitted  a  gym  membership  contract  dated  February  11,  2020,  further  documenting
his commitment to engage in a healthy lifestyle. (AE H)
Character Evidence
Applicant submitted a character letter dated November 10, 2020, from one of his

described  Applicant  as  “a  diligent  worker,  constant  learner,  and  man  of  integrity.”  He

"Applicant is 28 years old.  He has two Bachelor’s degrees.  He is employed by a
defense  contractor  as  a  Manufacturing  Engineer.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance in connection with his employment.  Applicant has no military service.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  admits  the  single  allegation  under  this  guideline.  He  has  used
marijuana  off  and  on  for  seven  years  from  approximately  April  2011  to  approximately
November 2018.  Applicant began using marijuana sporadically in college, at first about
once every  four or five months or  so.  (Tr. p. 27)  From  2015  until mid-2016,  he used
marijuana  weekly.  By  2016,  toward  the  end  of  college,  he  was  using  it  on  a  monthly
basis.  He did not use it again until March 2017 when he used it on a weekly basis until
November 2018 when he stopped.  (Government Exhibit 1.)
In  March  2017,  Applicant  was  hired  by   his  current  employer  as  a  Facilities
Engineer.     At  that  time,   Applicant   was  given  a  company  handbook  that  set  forth   the
rules  and   regulations   prohibiting  illegal  drug   use.     Applicant  also  understood  that   all
employees   were  subject  to  random  drug  testing.    Despite  receiving  this  information,
Applicant  continued  to  use  marijuana  from  March  2017  until   November   2018.     He
testified that he used  marijuana  to relax  and  for recreation  because he enjoyed it.  (Tr.
p. 22.)   He  also described  an ankle surgery he had  in  August 2017 where he obtained  a
medical   marijuana  card  in   order  to  purchase   it.    He   contends  that  he  purchased
marijuana  legally  from  marijuana  dispensaries.     He   normally  used  marijuana  at  his
residence  with  apartment   mates  while  playing  video   games.     (Tr.   p.  23.)     Applicant
testified  that he  continues  to associate with his friends who  use marijuana.  (Tr.  p. 24.)
He   currently   lives  with  his  best  friend   who   uses  marijuana   in   their  apartment  several
times a week.  When other friends come over to Applicant’s home,  they use marijuana
with  Applicant’s  roommate  in   Applicant’s  presence.    (Tr.   p.  26.)    Applicant  has  never
asked his friends or his roommate to avoid using marijuana in  his presence.  Applicant
last used marijuana in November 2018.   (Tr. p. 24.)
In  December  2017,  due  to  company  lay-offs,  Applicant  was  transferred  to  his
current position.  In April 2018, he learned that the new position would require a security

clearance.
(Government  Exhibit  1.)
In  response  to  Section  23  of  the  application,  Applicant  was
asked if in the last seven years he had used any illegal drugs or controlled substance?
In  response  to  Section  23,  Applicant  responded,  “Yes.”  (Government  Exhibit  1.)  On
page  35  of  the  same  questionnaire,  Applicant  explained  that  he  intends  to  use
marijuana  in  the  future  because  it  is  now  legal  in  the  state  where  he  resides.
(Government Exhibit 1.)
In November 2018, Applicant met with an OPM investigator and was asked about
his  future  intent  to  use  marijuana.  Applicant  initially  told  the  investigator  that  he
intended to continue using and purchasing marijuana in the future.  (Government Exhibit
2.)  Applicant  stated  that  he  changed  his  intent  during  the  interview  when  the
investigator told him that although marijuana use is legal in his state, it remains illegal
under  Federal  law.  Applicant  testified  that  he  now  has  no  intent  to  use  or  purchase
marijuana in the future due to the fact that his job requires a federal security clearance.

"Applicant  is  a  49-year-old,  married   man.  He   has  a  six-year-old   child  from  his
marriage  and  an adult child from a prior relationship. He  earned a bachelor’s degree in
1995. Currently, he  is  a  federal  contractor who  works  in  the  information  technology  field. He
has been working for  the same company since 2005, and  was promoted to his current
position  as a supervisor  in 2010. He has held a top secret clearance since 2011. (Tr. 36)
Applicant is  highly  respected  on  the  job. According  to  a  coworker,  Applicant is  a  “fair,
unbiased, even-tempered, conscientious,  and  hardworking”  employee  who  goes  above  and
beyond  in   mentoring his  subordinates.  (AE D1   at  1)  According   to  a former   supervisor,
Applicant “continuously demonstrated sound judgment at work.” (AE D2 at 1)
Applicant began smoking marijuana in  1989 while in  high school, using it once  per
week. In college, he used it a few times per week. (Tr. 32) In 1995, Applicant was charged
with possession of marijuana, and was sentenced to six months of probation. (Tr. 32-33)
He  continued to use marijuana for  three years after his arrest.  In 1998, Applicant came to
realize that his marijuana-smoking habit was not productive. (Tr.  34)  Consequently, he  quit
using it.
In late 2014, Applicant was diagnosed with Stage 3  rectal  cancer.  (AE K)  He  had  to
undergo chemotherapy. The chemotherapy medications made him extremely nauseated
and  miserable. (Tr.  21) In response, his doctor prescribed  anti-nausea medications, but
they proved to be unsuccessful. (Answer at 3; Tr.  20, 36)  Applicant was afraid that he was
going to die. (Tr. 21)  One of his friends suggested that he use marijuana to alleviate his
nausea. (Tr. 21) Applicant then resumed his marijuana  use. He  used  marijuana  throughout
his chemotherapy treatment,  which  lasted from December 2014  to  March  2015. He  was  on
short-term disability leave from work when he was using marijuana.
By March 2015, Applicant’s cancer had  gone into remission. He  discontinued his
marijuana use. Approximately three years later,  in  July 2018, Applicant used marijuana
again  on two occasions. (Tr. 21)  He  used it with his brother  who was living with him at the
time,  and  who had  purchased  it in  a jurisdiction where it was legal. (Tr. 21) When Applicant
used marijuana in  2018, he was not undergoing chemotherapy treatment,  as his  cancer
was still  in  remission. (Tr. 22) Applicant recognizes that he made “a terrible mistake,”  and
that regardless of whether it is legal  in  some state jurisdictions, it remains illegal  under
federal law, and is prohibited for people holding security clearances. (Tr. 22)
In February 2020, Applicant completed a drug and alcohol awareness class. (AE J)
In October 2020, Applicant underwent a mental health and substance abuse assessment.
(AE M)  Part  of the assessment included a Brief Addiction Monitor,  “an evidence-based
measurement  used  to  establish  a  baseline  of  substance  use  and  risk  and  protective
factors.”  Based on the assessment, Applicant did not meet any of the minimum criteria for
substance use concerns. (AE M)
Applicant has not smoked marijuana since July 2018. His brother no longer smokes
marijuana and no longer lives with him. (Tr. 24) Applicant does not intend to use marijuana
in the future even if his cancer recurs. (Tr. 28) On February 11, 2020, Applicant executed
an affidavit expressing his intent not to use marijuana again, and acknowledging that any
future use is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (AE I) Applicant stated on
a security clearance application completed in 2011 that he would not resume his marijuana
use, and he reiterated his intent not to resume marijuana use on his security clearance
application completed in January 2018. (GE 1 at 31)

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  he  denied  SOR  ¶  1.b.  His  admission  is
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 51 years old. He is divorced and has no children. (Tr. 40-41) He has
a high school diploma and vocational training. He has worked for the same employer in
the  defense  industry  for  about  20  years,  since  January  2001.  He  is  a  network
administrator.  He  works  at  his  employer’s  computer  “help  desk.”  (Tr.  39,  47,  GE  1)
Applicant has had a clearance for his whole career. (Tr. 11-12, 27, 40; GE 1) He has an
annual salary of about $85,000 or $90,000. (Tr. 63)
The  SOR  concerns  Applicant’s  history  of  marijuana  use  and  his  alleged  future
intentions.  SOR  ¶  1.a  reads,  “You  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about
March  2013  to  about  July  2017,  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.”
Applicant offered no clarification or additional explanation when he admitted SOR ¶ 1.a.
In  denying  SOR  ¶  1.b,  regarding  his  future  intentions,  he  also  made  no  further
comment.
The basis of both SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b is set forth in Applicant’s December 2017
SCA  and  in  the  summaries  of  his  background  interviews  of  December  2017  and
January  2018,  both  of  which  he  authenticated,  with  some  corrections,  in  an  August
2019 interrogatory response. (GE 1, GE 2) The details of what Applicant reported and
said  in  these  two  documents  about  his  drug  involvement  are  addressed  at  length,
followed by his hearing testimony.
On  his  February  2017  SCA,  Applicant  answered  “Yes”  to  the  question,  “In  the
last  seven  (7)  years,  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances?”  He
stated,
I  have  smoked  pot  and  experimented  with  Dope  again.  I  put  down  the
dope even though it was more than 7 years ago because I was asked this
question before, when I was asked why I did not put that down I replied it
was more than 7 years ago. (GE 1 at 26)
When asked to provide the type of drug or controlled substance used, Applicant
listed:
THC  (Such  as  marijuana,  weed,  pot,  hashish,  etc.)  Also  codeine,
Morphine  and   Vicodin  when  I  was  in   a  sickle  cell   crisis.  For  medical
reasons. The  pot was about a year ago  and  I had  a  SC  [sickle  cell] crisis
last year also. The  experiment with dope was more than 7 years ago  but [I
am] being honest in case it comes up.” (GE 1 at 26)
Applicant  listed   a  month   of  first   use  as  “03/2013  (Estimated)”  and  most   recent
use as “11/2016 (Estimated).” He   then stated, “I  used   the pot on   my birthday and   at a
cookout,  other drugs when I was  sick.” (GE  1 at 26) Applicant’s birthday is in  November.
(GE 1 at 5)
Applicant  answered  “Yes”  to  the  question,  “Was  your  use  while  possessing  a
security  clearance?”  As  to  the  question,  “Do  you  intend  to  use  this  drug  or  controlled
substance in the future?,” he answered “Yes,” and explained:
I  answered  yes  because  of  my  sickle  cell  but  I  am  trying  other  drugs
prescribed  by  my  Dr.  to  try  and  not  to.  For  now  this  seems  like  the  only
thing that helps SC. [I] don’t have crises all the time, maybe once or twice
a year.” (GE 1 at 26)
Applicant  discussed  his  history  of  illegal  drug  use  during  his  first  background
interview, in December 2017. He said he first used THC when he was 17. (GE 1 at 26;
Tr. 45) He said he believed he started using it again in March 2013. Then he said words
to the effect of:
Within  the  last  7  years,  [Applicant]  has  used  4-6  times.  [Applicant]  does
not purchase THC and only uses when it is available and offered to him.
[Applicant]  last  used  in  7/17  with  his  cousin,  while  possessing  a  security
[Applicant]  has  used  with  ex-girlfriends,  and  friends  at

cookouts,  fishing  trips,  and  people’s  houses.  .  .  .  [Applicant]  uses  THC
medically  for  his  sickle  cell  anemia.  Outside  of  this,  [Applicant]  generally
takes 1-2 hits of the THC socially and obtains it from other people, mainly
his cousin. . . . (GE 2 at 10)
Applicant also stated words to the effect of, “[w]ith regard to future intentions, [he]
does not intend to seek out THC but if he it [sic] is offered to him, he does not plan to
turn  it  down.”  (GE  2  at  10)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  had  used  THC  with  a
clearance.  Applicant  also  acknowledged  in  his  interview  that  he  used  heroin  about  20
years ago. He relapsed about 15 years ago (in about 2005) and went to treatment. (GE
2 at 11)
In his second interview, in January 2018, Applicant clarified the details of his prior
drug use. He said he never used THC medically, only socially. He also clarified that his
use  of  codeine,  morphine,  and  Vicodin  was  not  illegal,  as  he  was  given  those  drugs
intravenously in hospitals. (GE 2 at 16; Tr. 41)
With respect to his use of THC, Applicant clarified that he put March 2013 as his
start date on his SCA because “prior to 3/13, his use was much less frequent.” GE 2 at
16  (emphasis  added)  Since  March  2013,  Applicant  “has  used  THC  approximately  4-6
times. [Applicant] most recently used THC in 7/17.” (GE 2 at 16) Applicant stated in his
interview that he “is aware that the use of THC is illegal and that usage could jeopardize
his clearance. [Applicant] does not use THC regularly and has no intentions [of] seeking
out  the  drug  to  use  it.”  (GE  2  at  16)  Applicant  also  addressed  his  prior  use  of  heroin,
most recently in 2005. (GE 2 at 16)
Applicant was given the opportunity to review, edit, and correct the OPM agent’s
summaries of his two interviews in an interrogatory response that he returned to DOHA
in  August  2019.  (GE  2)  In  reviewing  the  interview  summaries,  Applicant  corrected  the
status  of  certain  financial  matters,  his  father’s  citizenship,  and  the  name  or  location  of
his high school. Applicant did not make any corrections to the portions of the interview
summaries concerning his THC use. (GE 2 at 2-3; Tr. 55)
In a separate section, the DOHA interrogatory also asked about Applicant’s drug
use.  To  a  question  asking  “Have  you  engaged  in  any  additional  drug  use  since  July
2017?,”  he  answered  “No”  and  wrote,  “I  don’t  recall.”  To  a  question  asking  “Have  you
EVER  used  ANY  illegal  drug  in  addition  to  marijuana?,”  (emphasis  in  original)  he
answered,  “Yes”  and  reported  his  prior  heroin  use,  noting  that  he  had  previously
indicated the dates to the best of his knowledge. (GE 2 at 4)
Applicant  began  his  hearing  testimony  by  acknowledging  that  he  had  made  a
mistake. He asserted that he is an honest person. He has worked for his employer for
21 years and does not get into trouble. (Tr. 25-26, 31)
Applicant  denied  using  any  marijuana  between  2006  and  2013.  (Tr.  46)  He
repeatedly  asserted  during  his  testimony  that  during  the  timeframe  in  question  (March
2013 to July 2017, as alleged), he had used marijuana twice. Once was on a fishing trip,
in 2013, and once was at a cousin’s wedding in another state, in 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 27-
29,  38,  49-51)  Both  times  he  was  offered  marijuana  by  someone  else.  (Tr.   29-30)  He
denied using marijuana more frequently, such as on weekends or “every day.” (Tr. 28,
30)  Under questioning, he specifically denied using marijuana four to six  times between
2013 and 2017. “I remember two,” he said several times. (Tr. 42, 43)
When  confronted  at  his  hearing  about  what  he  reported  on  his  SCA  about  his
prior drug use (“I used the pot on my birthday and at a cookout. . . ”), Applicant testified,
“I  don’t  remember.”  (Tr.  52)  When  pressed  further  about  whether  he  might  have  used
marijuana  at  least  four  times  (the  birthday,  the  cookout,  the  fishing  trip  and  the
wedding), Applicant acknowledged, “I think that that’s accurate.” (Tr. 53)
Applicant  testified  that  “I can’t hardly  remember  what  happened,  you know,  last
year, last month.” (Tr. 53)  He asserted several times more that he had a poor memory
for dates and other specifics. (Tr. 55, 56, 57)
With  respect  to  the  timing  of  his  most  recent  use,  Applicant  denied  using
marijuana  or  THC  since  filling  out  his  SCA  in  February  2017.  (Tr.  57)  He  said  his
interview  statements  that  he  used  marijuana  as  recently  as  July  2017  were  not
accurate.  (Tr.  57)  He  later  said,  “And,  like  I  said,  it  could  have  been  before  that  .  .  .
.”)(Tr. 67)
Applicant denied any prior use of marijuana for  medicinal  purposes. (Tr. 36,  48-
49) He  denied any intention to use marijuana in  the future (Tr. 33-34, 60)  He  is aware
that  he  could  get  a  doctor  to   prescribe  medical  marijuana  to  treat  the  pain  from   his
sickle  cell  anemia,  but  “because  of  my  job,   because  of  my  clearance,  I  can’t  do  that.”
(Tr.  33-34,   35-36)  Applicant   is  subject  to  drug  testing  at  work,   though   he  said   he  has
never  been  tested.  (Tr.  36-37,  63)  He   has  never  had   counseling  concerning   his
marijuana use. (Tr. 46)
Applicant said he is no longer in regular contact with his cousin who gave him the
marijuana.  Applicant  testified  that  he  no  longer  socializes  with  people  who  use
marijuana. He does not really socialize with anyone. Some of this is attributable to his
personal habits; he said he is a “workaholic” and has no real hobbies. He acknowledged
that some of this is also due to the ongoing pandemic, which  limits everyone’s interest
and ability to socialize with others. (Tr. 43-44, 47, 68)
Applicant’s  post-hearing  materials  included  a  letter  in  which  he  expressed
“sincere  remorse  for  my  irresponsible  actions.”  He  offered  “no  excuse”  and  accepted
“full  responsibility.”  He  further  stated,  “I  know  for  a  fact  I  will  never  take  illegal
substances, for I don’t associate with those people who provided it anymore.” (AE A)

"Applicant  is 27  years old.  She is single and has no children.  She obtained her
undergraduate  degree  in  2016.  She  is  employed  as  a  systems  engineer  and  has
worked  for  her  current  employer  since  April  2017.  (Tr.  26).  Applicant  completed  her
latest security clearance application (SCA) on February 4, 2019. (GX 3)
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying
frequency,  from  about  October  2011  until  about  April  2018  (1.a);  that  she  used
marijuana  while  granted  access  to  classified  information  (1.b)  and  that  she  intends  to
use  marijuana  in  the  future  (1.c).  The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  E  that  Applicant
falsified  her  November  20,  2017  SCA  when  she  answered  “No”  to  Section  23:  which
asks  whether  she  possessed  or  used  illegal  drugs  in  the  previous  seven  years  (2.a).
Applicant admitted the allegations under 1.a and 1.b, and she denied 1.c and 2.a.
Applicant testified that she participated in the professional development program
and rotated positions in the company that she is currently employed with for about four
years. (Tr.15) She elaborated that she had a “really good understanding of the defense
industry  and  expand[ed]  her  knowledge.”  (Tr.  15)  She  explained  that  she  is  a  natural
leader and has been a good example for  women.”  (Tr. 17) Applicant admitted that she
took  initial  training  for  security,  but  she  could  not  recall  training  on  how  to  complete  a
security  clearance  application.  (Tr.  18)  It  was  when  she  received  the  SOR  that  she
realized that she had  “triggered” the security concerns under Guidelines H and  E. She
acknowledged she received counseling from her attorney.
Applicant  began  smoking  marijuana  in  2011  when  she  was  in  college.  (GX  3)
She  admitted  this  in  her  subject  interview  and  stated  that  she  used  it  to  calm  her
anxiety.  The  usage  was  approximately  twice  a  week.  She  admitted  that  she  used  the
marijuana  in  California  because  it  was  legal  in  that  state.  (GX  3)  When  she  came  to
Maryland, she knew it was illegal under Maryland law, and she stopped using marijuana
in  April  2018.  In  her  March  2019,  subject  interview  Applicant  stated  that  she  did  use
marijuana  while  holding  her  security  clearance  in  2017.  (GX  4)  She  denied  this
allegation at the hearing, stating that she did not understand the question. She said she
had  a  security  clearance,  but  she  did  not  actually  have  access  to  any  classified
information.  (Tr. 27) She stated if it became federally legalized, she would continue to
use marijuana.  In 2019, she had never sought treatment for anxiety.
At  the  hearing  Applicant  presented  a  multitude  of  reasons  why  she  used
marijuana,  which  did  not  conform  to  her  answers  in  her  2019  subject  interview.  After
receiving  the  SOR  and  seeking  advice  of  counsel,  she  explained  that  the  use  of
marijuana  was  due  to  her  high  levels  of  anxiety,  family  background,  financial  issues,
and  stressful  relationship.  (AX  C).  She  stopped  associating  with  people  who  use
marijuana,  obtained  an  evaluation,  and  signed  an  intent  not  to  use  marijuana  in  the
future.  (Tr.  23)  She  also  stated  that  she  is  extremely  sorry.  (Tr.  25)  At  one  point,  she
stated that she did not understand the difference between federal and state law despite
her security training.
In  October  2020,  Applicant  obtained  an  evaluation  from  a  psychologist  who
concluded  Applicant  did  not  appear  to  be  in  acute  emotional  distress.  (AX  E)  She
admitted to episodic bouts of anxiety or depression. In that report it was recommended
that  she  establish  and  maintain  outpatient  treatment  for  psychiatry  and  psychiatric
treatment  since  her  relocation  to  Maryland.  (AX  E)  The  psychologist  noted  that
Applicant has an inclination toward adventuresome behavior and risk taking which might
suggest  a  higher  propensity  to  alcohol  and  drug  abuse  when  compared  to  sample
norms. (AX E)
Applicant completed a SCA in November 2017. (GX 2) She did not disclose her
use  of  illegal  drugs  and  answered  “No”  to  Section  23,  which  asked  whether  she
possessed or used illegal drugs in the last seven years. In her answer, she denied the
allegation  stating  that  there  were  many  parts  to  the  application,  and  it  took  her  a  long
time to complete it. She stated that she asked her peer and no one mentioned that she
should list the marijuana use. (Tr. 29)  She stated at the hearing that she answered, no,
to illegal drug use but she knew she had used marijuana and countered that by saying
she did not read the question thoroughly. (Tr. 30) Applicant also blamed it on her belief
that  using  marijuana  in  California  was  not  illegal  because  marijuana  use  was  legal
under  California  state  law.  She  stated  that  from  a  federal  perspective  she  did  not
understand that marijuana was illegal. This is hard to find credible given her work in the
defense field and her program training. (Tr. 32-33)
Applicant changed her answer in her February 4, 2019 SCA, with respect to drug
use in the  past  seven years.  She said she  spoke to some  people,  but  did not  think to
check with her facility security officer (FSO) for advice.  (Tr. 35-36) She elaborated that
she answered she would use marijuana in the future, but that was before she engaged
a  psychologist  or  attorney.  (Tr.  37)  She  also  stated  that  she  was  confused  when  she
received her security clearance.
The  Government,  in  a  post-hearing  submission  presented  proof  that  Applicant
received  her  security  clearance  on  December  12,  2017.  Applicant  was  adamant  that
she  would  no  longer  use  marijuana  but  stated  that  the  fear  of  losing  her  security
clearance really made her stop smoking marijuana. (Tr. 49)  The Applicant submitted a
clarification  stating  that  some  peers  told  her  not  to  report  the  marijuana  use  on  the
second application, and she was confused. (AX F) She did not provide the names of the

testified that he was told  by the Human Resources manager that his employer’s policy
was to allow drug use that was legal in the state of employment. (Tr. 21-23.)
