"Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the  following
findings  of  fact:  Applicant  is  40  years  old.  He  has  never  been  married  and  does  not
have any children. Since 1985, Applicant has resided with his family and grandmother in
his  grandmother’s  house.  In  2004,  he  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  electrical
engineering, and in 2012, he earned his master’s degree in the same field. In 2015, he
was hired by a defense contractor, but his employment is contingent on him obtaining a
DOD security clearance. (GE 1, GE 4)
SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  allege  that  Applicant  participated  in  a
psychological evaluation in March 2018 in which he was diagnosed as exhibiting signs
of  Paranoid  Personality  Disorder,  Autism  Spectrum  Disorder,  and  Unspecified  Anxiety
Disorder.  The  doctor  concluded  that  Applicant  suffers  from  interfering  mental  health
conditions  that  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  his  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness when handling classified information or performing sensitive tasks in the
future.  Applicant  had  been  asked  to  participate  in  a  psychological  evaluation  after
reports  of  his  questionable  behavior  and  poor  judgment  in  the  workplace  surfaced
during  the  course  of  his  security  clearance  investigation.  Applicant  denied  both  SOR
allegations, and testified that the doctor’s diagnosis and conclusion were in error due, in
part, to lack of information. (Tr. 65, GE 4; SOR Response “B”)
The  doctor,  a  licensed  psychologist,  used  Applicant’s  background  information
provided  by  the  DOD  CAF,  and  administered  the  Personality  Assessment  Inventory
during  the  psychological  evaluation.  He  also  conducted  a  clinical  interview  and
personally observed Applicant. Applicant reported that he was wrongfully terminated by
a  DOD  government  employer  in  2011  because  he  had  witnessed  and  reported
nefarious  activities  in  the  workplace,  to  include  inappropriate  handling  of  classified
information,  co-worker  connections  to  the  Mexican  drug  cartel,  deliberate  espionage,
and  the  framing  of  an  innocent  employee  supposedly  involved  in  child  pornography.
After his job termination, he claimed the defense contractor’s employees then made him
the  subject  of  their  surveillance  and  the  eventual  victim  of  arson  in  2012.  These  acts
were committed against Applicant in retaliation for his disclosure of these events to the
FBI  and  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Special  Investigations  (AFOSI).  The  doctor  concluded
that Applicant’s paranoid personality disorder involved a global mistrust and suspicion of
others’ motives. The events Applicant described are certainly possible events, but in the
context  of  the  psychological  evaluation,  those  events  were  likely  improbable.  He
recommended  Applicant  participate  in  psychiatric  treatment.  As  of  the  date  of  the
hearing, Applicant had not received any treatment for his present mental status. (Tr. 67-
76, 123-124; GE 4; AE E; SOR response “B, D-G”)
Applicant’s  response  to  the  SOR  stated  that  the  doctor’s  diagnosis  was  biased
and  skewed.  Applicant’s  grandmother  had  passed  away  less  than  six  months  prior  to
the date of his psychological evaluation, and he had asked the doctor if his grief would
adversely affect the test results. The doctor stated it would not, but Applicant does not
agree  with  that  assessment.  Applicant  had  inquired  whether  the  doctor  had  received
verification  and  validation  from  the  FBI  and  AFOSI  regarding  his  experiences  at  his
former workplace and  the  following repercussions,  to which  the  doctor  replied he had.
During  the  course  of  the  evaluation,  Applicant  revealed  that  he  had  an  extensive
personal engineering library and that he was sexually inactive, which he asserted was
information  that  was  inappropriately  considered  by  the  doctor.  Overall,  he  felt  that  the
doctor’s  diagnosis  of  him  exhibiting  signs  of  Paranoid  Personality  Disorder,  Autism
Spectrum  Disorder,  and  Unspecified  Anxiety  Disorder
incomplete,  biased,
unprofessional, as well as personally insulting. (Tr. 30-31, SOR response “B, F”)
is
Applicant requested the FBI conduct a polygraph examination on him to validate
his  reported  incidents  and  to  show  the  government  that  he  is  not  a  threat  to  the  U.S.,
but the FBI denied that request. He also requested through the Freedom of Information
Act, and by a direct request to the FBI, that portions of his 2015 investigative report from
the  OPM  be  unredacted,  which  was  also  denied.  Applicant  claimed  the  FBI  could  not
provide  the  redacted  portions  of  his  investigative  records  due  to  a  current  and
aggressively ongoing criminal investigation to apprehend the criminals he had identified
from  his  former  place  of  employment.  (Tr.  138-139;  AE  cover  letter;  AE  E;  SOR
response “B, D, E”)
In June 2011, Applicant was terminated from a government employer located on
a  military  installation.  His  job  termination  was  related  to  his  personal  conduct  and
inability to follow policies and procedures. (SOR ¶ 2.b) The concerns included: multiple
late  arrivals  to  work  and  work  meetings;  demonstrating  a  lack  of  respect  to  his  co-
workers;  attempting  to  gain  unauthorized  entry  to  the  Sensitive  Compartmented
Information  Facility  (SCIF);  attempting  to  query  an  unknown  foreign  national,  who  he
found  via  an  online  software  forum,  for  assistance  with  his  work;  and  for  bringing  a
prohibited  USB  drive  into  the  SCIF  and  failing  to  properly  report  the  security  violation.
Based  on  the  foregoing  security-related  incidents,  Applicant’s  access  to  classified
information was suspended in April 2011. This allegation was also cross-referenced as
SOR ¶ 3.a under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information). (GE 6; SOR response
“B, D-G”)
Applicant denied this allegation in his response to the SOR. He claimed that he
had unreliable transportation due to mechanical issues with his car, which caused him
to  be  late.  He  remedied  this  situation  by  notifying  his  employer  of  the  problem,  and
having  his  car  repaired.  He  has  “always  shown  respect”  to  all  of  his  co-workers  and
supervisors.  He  admitted  he  had  an  unpleasant  incident  with  a  former  co-worker,  but
only after he learned that he missed a meeting that was not previously communicated to
him.  He  apologized  to  her  for  being  abrupt,  and  she  accepted  his  apology.  Applicant
acknowledged an attempted entry into the SCIF, but this was only due to the fact that
the  door  was  not  labeled  TOP  SECRET  SCIF.  As  to  the  foreign  national  allegation,
Applicant had been told by a supervisor that employees were permitted to post generic
questions  on  the  internet  to  gain  information  about  work-related  material.  When
Applicant had asked if he could contact a foreign national to obtain information, he was
immediately  told  not  to  do  so.  Applicant  stated  that  he  followed  proper  procedures  by
first  asking  if  he  could  contact  the  foreign  national,  and  then  immediately  disregarding
making contact once he was told to do so. His carrying a prohibited device into a SCIF
was unintentional. He had previously placed a USB drive in his wallet, and it accidently
fell  out  after  he  opened  his  wallet  to  pay  for  a  snack  in  the  SCIF  area.  He  claimed  to
have  followed  proper  security  protocols  by  handing  over  the  USB  drive  to  the
appropriate individual to safeguard the device. The USB was  reviewed by the security
office and no classified files were found on it. Applicant stated this was an inadvertent
mistake  that  will  never  be repeated.  (Tr.  95-104,  106-122,  127,  130-137;  GE  1,  GE  2,
GE 3; AE C; SOR response “B, D-G”)
In October 2014, Applicant was terminated from a different employer due to his
inability to follow project guidelines, meet requirements to produce tangible work results
within  reasonable  deadlines,  and  his  inability  to  follow  clear  instructions  and  stay  on
task. (SOR ¶ 2.a) Applicant denied this allegation and blamed his former employer for
instituting  unreasonable  timelines  for  the  completion  of  assigned  projects.  In  addition,
his former employer failed to provide the proper equipment and software he needed to
complete  the  task.  Applicant  raised  awareness  in  the  workplace  that  the  employer’s
software could cause human injuries and electrical fires. Shortly thereafter, he asserted
he was wrongly terminated by this employer. Applicant claimed that the fact that he was
awarded  unemployment  benefits  from  the  state  is  evidence  that  his  former  employer
was found to be dishonest in their business and the state is currently investigating his
former employer for their corrupt actions. (Tr. 88-94, 140-143; GE 1; SOR response “B
and H”) After his job termination in October 2014, Applicant sent e-mail communications
to his former employer. The title of one particular e-mail; “I am still enjoying the money
from (employer) having to pay unemployment.” He told his former boss that he was the
“worst god-forsaken and despicable employer” that he had ever encountered. Applicant
threatened to reveal adverse information to their business client. He also requested that
his former boss stop harassing a co-worker who was involved in a romantic relationship
with  a  foreign  national.  Applicant  wholly  supported  the  co-worker’s  position  that  “all
American women are despicable lying females who are only capable of falsely accusing
men  of  RAPE  and  SEXUAL  ASSAULT.”  He  identified  a  female  co-worker  that  fit  this
description, and told his former boss that maybe she would accuse him of such a crime.
(Tr. 86, 88-92, 140-148; GE 5; AE B; SOR response “B and H”)
to
from  any
immediately  cease  and  desist
An attorney representing the former employer sent Applicant a letter dated June
2,  2015,  notifying  him
further
communications. In response to Applicant’s threat to contact the business client, it was
noted  that  he  had  previously  signed  a  confidentiality  agreement,  a  copy  of  which  was
attached  to  the  letter.  If  Applicant  violated  this  agreement,  the  former  employer  would
consider  pursuing  legal  remedies  against  him.  Applicant  sent  an  e-mail  to  his  former
boss the next day. He also contacted an attorney to determine whether he could contact
the  business  client,  whether  his  former  employer  would  sue  him,  and  if  so,  would  his
former employer be able to stop his unemployment benefits. Applicant claimed that this
former employer “blacklisted” him by providing negative reviews to potential employers
inquiring about his possible employment. (Tr. 149-150; GE 5; AE B, AE D, AE F; SOR
response “B and H”)
Applicant  had  been  previously  employed  by  a  government  contractor  and  was
laid  off  in  approximately  2008.  Applicant  admitted  in  an  e-mail  that  he  made  serious
mistakes during his employment. He contacted his former supervisor after he suspected
that  he  had  been  “blacklisted”  due  to  his  inability  to  find  subsequent  employment.  He
also  suspected  that  his  former  employer  was  embezzling  money  from  one  of  their
customers. Applicant’s SOR does not allege this information. Applicant testified that the
official  reason  he  was  let  go  from  this  employer  was  because  the  employer’s  defense
project  was  terminated  by  Congress.  Applicant  claims  the  unofficial  reason  he  was  let
go by his  employer was for him making terrorist threats.  (Tr. 153-159; GE 2; AE A) In
ISCR  Case  No.  03-20327  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Oct.  26,  2006),  the  Appeal  Board  listed  five
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:
(a)  to  assess  an  applicant’s  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s
evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines
is  applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for  whole  person  analysis  under
Directive Section 6.3.
Applicant’s  father  was  both  a  personal  representative  and  a  witness  at  the
hearing.  He  verified  several  unusual  events,  to  include  the  home  survelliance  that
occurred from August 2011 to April 7, 2012, the date of the suspicious house fire that he
claimed was still under investigation by the fire department for arson. No one was able
to make any contact with the individuals who participated in the surveillance, or obtain
the  license  plate  numbers  from  the  blackened  vehicles  used  in  that  endeavor.  He
participated  in  the  meetings  with  the  FBI  and  AFOSI.  Applicant  also  provided  three
character reference letters. It appears that all four individuals have worked with him in
some  capacity,  and  all  characterized  Applicant  as  a  trusted,  gifted,  and  dedicated
individual.  None  of  these  individuals  mentioned  that  they  were  aware  of  the  security
concerns alleged in his SOR.  (TR. 25-64, 76-85; SOR response “C and I”)
",False
"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old, has never married, and has no children. He earned his
bachelor’s  degree  in  mathematics  in  September  2010,  and  his  master’s  degree  in
computational  science,  engineering,  and  mathematics  in  August  2012.  He  took  some
courses online from January 2014 to January 2017, and earned a graduate certificate. He
has worked for the same defense contractor since  August 2012, after interning for the
company in the summer of 2011, and he is currently a senior research associate. Applicant
indicated on a July 2014 security clearance application that he  was granted an interim
secret-level clearance in July 2014, although he has not worked on any classified projects.
(GEs 1-2, AE A; Tr. 24.)
Psychological Conditions
Applicant first sought mental health treatment in 2000, when he was 13 years old.
He was struggling with depression, had low self-esteem, and lacked motivation. He was
prescribed a mood-stabilizer medication at that time because of his family history of bipolar
disorder,  and  he  has  been  voluntarily  receiving  outpatient  psychiatric  treatment  and
counseling since then. (GEs 3-4.)
At age 17, in December 2003, Applicant had a manic episode after he ran out of his
Lamictal medication while on a family vacation. Over the course of two weeks, he became
extremely talkative with rapid speech, grandiose ideas, insomnia, and held a delusional
belief. His mother took him to an emergency room, and he was admitted to a hospital for
two weeks in January 2004 and treated for diagnosed depression. (GE 4; Tr. 25.) On his
discharge from the inpatient psychiatric treatment, Applicant was prescribed Lithium, and
he resumed his mental health treatment under the care of a psychiatrist and psychologist
for diagnosed bipolar I disorder. (GE 4; Tr. 26-27.)
Clinical  notes  from  his  then  treating  psychiatrist  in  August  2010  indicate  that
Applicant’s bipolar I symptoms were under good control on the antidepressants Zoloft and
Sertraline,  and  the  mood-stabilizers  Lamictal  and  Lamotrigine.  During  a  psychiatric
evaluation at the university health services for a transfer of providers when he moved for
graduate  school in  September 2010,  Applicant  related that he was consuming alcohol
three nights a week, three to four drinks per occasion, and six drinks on the weekend days.
He stated he was not using any illegal drugs. He reported feeling “definitely depressed,”
and worrying excessively. Applicant reported some improvement in functioning over the
previous  two  years.  He  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  I  disorder,  most  recent  episode
depressed, moderate. Applicant was started on Abilify medication, and he began weekly
therapy with a psychologist in the community while continuing to meet with a psychiatrist at
the  university’s  health  services  department.  Applicant  continued  to  struggle  with
depression, with some exacerbation of symptoms around academic examinations. (GE 4.)
During a session with his university health services’ psychiatrist on March 2, 2011,
Applicant  reported  a  significant  improvement  in  mood  since  his  previous  session  in
December  2010.  He  was  taking  Lamictal  and  Zoloft  medication  with  good  effect,
experiencing  no  mood  swings,  and  continuing  in  therapy  with  a  psychologist  in  the
community. During his next session, which occurred in May 2011, Applicant reported no
mania or severe depression, although he had downward turns of mood lasting several
hours or days and moderate generalized anxiety. He had a pattern of relying on alcohol to
medicate for his anxiety. He was advised to obtain care from a psychiatrist in the local
community. (GE 4.)
In September 2011, Applicant had a final session at university health services. He
advised that he had not found a new psychiatrist and was running low on his medications.
He  was  given  a  14-day  supply  of  Zoloft  and  contact  information  for  some  local
psychiatrists. His mental health was assessed as fairly stable. (GE 4.) The psychologist
who treated Applicant on a regular basis from September 2010 to December 2011 for
diagnosed bipolar disorder indicates that their sessions focused primarily on managing
Applicant’s depression and related issues. Applicant exhibited no serious problems with
judgment or impulse control, and no serious behavioral or psychiatric issues. (GE 5.)
After earning his master’s degree in August 2012, Applicant began working for his
current employer. (GE 1.) Life stress led Applicant to retreat into a very depressive episode
in late 2013. He missed approximately one month of work because of his depression and
checked himself into a three-week partial hospitalization program. The treatment consisted
primarily of talk therapy, medication adjustments as needed, and support to regain his
stability after the depressive episode. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 29-30.)
Over the years, Applicant’s medication dosages have been adjusted to address his
mental health issues. He continues to experience depression and intense anxiety, but he
has  not  had  any  symptoms  of  mania  since  2003.  (Tr.  25-26.)  He  currently  takes
Lamotrigine  (a  mood-stabilizer),  Lexapro,  Ativan,  and  Wellbutrin  for  his  mental  health
issues.  (Tr.  27-28.)  He  sees  his  psychiatrist  once  every  two  months  for  medication
management and his psychologist every two weeks for counseling. (GEs 6-7; Tr. 29.)
Applicant began a therapeutic relationship with his current psychiatrist in April 2013
(GE  6)  and  with  his  psychologist  in  March  2015.  (GEs  2,  7.)  Applicant’s  psychiatrist
diagnosed  him  with  bipolar  I  disorder  (single  manic  episode,  most  recent  episode
depressed); social anxiety disorder; and generalized anxiety disorder. Between April 2013
and March 2016, Applicant experienced four episodes of depression but no hypomania or
mania. Applicant took his medications as prescribed and had extended psychotherapy.
(GE 6.) During his intake with his current psychologist, Applicant presented with episodic
depression and problems with social anxiety. The psychologist diagnosed him with major
depressive disorder, moderate, recurrent, and with social anxiety disorder. As of March
2016, Applicant had attended 41 sessions with his psychologist. He was actively committed
to working on ways to manage his symptoms and keep them from interfering with his life.
His treating psychologist indicated that Applicant was particularly responsive to cognitive-
behavioral interventions  to  decrease  problematic  thoughts,  and  he made considerable
progress in the area of being more active in pursuing social interactions and confronting his
anxieties. His mood was stable and bright for several months as of March 2016. (GE 7.)
On October 6, 2018, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation by a clinical
psychologist  at  the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF.  Applicant  reported  that  he  continues  to
experience  approximately  four  depressive  episodes  of  varying  intensity  per  year.  He
reported  experiencing  symptoms  of  anxiety,  especially  in  social  settings,  although  he
exhibited  no  observable  signs  of  anxiety.  He  expressed  an  understanding  of  the
seriousness of his condition and of the importance of taking his psychiatric medications as
prescribed. The psychologist assessed Applicant’s judgment as good and his insight as
intact. Clinical testing revealed no marked elevations indicative of psychopathology, but
some potential problems with regard to his anxiety, albeit still within the normal range. The
psychologist  noted  that  Applicant’s  single  manic  episode  at  age  17  could  have  been
triggered by the anti-depressant medication he was taking at the time, and she gave him a
good prognosis as to the risk of another manic episode. Depression was more prominent,
but the psychologist noted that his depressive symptoms had not negatively interfered with
his work environment since 2014. Applicant showed that he is able to identify triggers for a
depressive  episode  (i.e.,  that  they  are  more  likely  to  occur  in  the  winter,  after  the
dissolution of a romantic relationship, or when he is overwhelmed at work), but this insight
was considered to be a strength in that it allows him to be proactive in utilizing his coping
skills,  and  taking  measures  to  minimize  the  impact  of  his  symptoms.  The  clinical
psychologist assessed his prognosis for future depressive episodes as poor in that they are
likely to occur throughout his life, but the chronicity of his depression has a fairly predicable
pattern  that  makes  his  condition  “quite  stable.”  Applicant’s  ongoing  anxiety  could
exacerbate or serve as a trigger for his depressive episodes, although it could serve as “a
protective  factor when  it  comes  to  judgment  and  impulsivity.” The  clinical  psychologist
concluded about his mental health conditions as follows:
[Applicant] does have chronic mental health conditions, including Bipolar I
Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder, that are being appropriately managed
and treated, and they are currently stable. Even when symptomatic, it is not
believed  that  these  conditions  pose  any  significant  risks  to his judgment,
reliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified information. Additionally,
the risk to judgment and reliability of any future mental health problems is
low.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant used marijuana regularly in high school, initially once or twice a month
starting at age 16 in approximately 2002. After his hospitalization for his manic episode in
2003,  Applicant  began  to  consider  ceasing  his marijuana  use.  He  understood  that  his
marijuana use contributed to his lack of motivation and caused him intense anxiety. Yet, by
age 18, he was using marijuana daily and sometimes multiple times per day. His marijuana
use was social with friends, and he used marijuana because his friends were using it. (GEs
2-3;  Tr.  30-31.)  Applicant  reported  to  a  psychiatrist  in  September  2010  that  he  was
“consistently high” from smoking marijuana between the ages of 18 and 20 (between 2004
and 2006). (GE 4.)
Initially, Applicant used marijuana shared by his friends, occasionally contributing
money  for marijuana  or splitting  the  cost  of  marijuana  with  others. By age 18, he was
purchasing marijuana once or twice a week at a cost of $40 each time. Approximately once
every couple of months, Applicant sold some of his marijuana to friends, but not for profit.
(GE 2.)
Applicant decided to reduce his marijuana use because it made him feel paranoid
and interfered with his productivity. He no longer purchased marijuana after 2005, but he
continued to use marijuana once a year to once every couple of years to at least 2016.
(GEs 2, 4; Tr. 31.) During a session with his then treating psychiatrist in late May 2011,
Applicant reported that he was using marijuana rarely, less than once a month. (GE 4.)
During  his personal subject  interview  with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
investigator on May 3, 2017, Applicant indicated that he used marijuana once every couple
of  years.  (GE  2.)  At  his  March  2020  hearing,  he  described  his  marijuana  use  since
approximately 2005 as “once a year tops.” (Tr. 32.)
On  July  24,  2014,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86.) In response to an inquiry concerning
any illegal drug use in the last seven years, Applicant responded that he used marijuana
between  September  2002  and  November  2011,  stating,  “In  high  school  I  smoked
marijuana recreationally with some periods of heavy use. In college, I used it on the rare
occasion.” Applicant responded “No” to whether he intended to use marijuana in the future
and explained that he used the drug as a teenager and was no longer interested in using it.
Applicant answered “No” to a question concerning any illegal drug purchase in the last
seven years. He responded “Yes” to an inquiry into whether he had intentionally misused a
prescription  drug  in  the  last  seven  years,  and  disclosed  that  he  had  used  “Concerta”
between January 2007 and January 2008 “as a stimulant for pulling all night study sessions
in college.” (GE 1.)
Applicant used marijuana after he completed his SF 86. He used marijuana while
vacationing with college friends in June 2015, and another time in 2016. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 31-
32.) About his use in June 2015, he told the OPM investigator in May 2017 that he wanted
to confirm that he no longer liked the drug, and that after taking two hits of marijuana from
a bowl, he felt uncomfortable and stoned. (GE 2.) Applicant held a “misguided notion” that
his  drug  involvement  would  not  be  disqualifying  because  he  was  truthful  about  his
marijuana use, did not have a serious addiction problem, and his use was restricted to
“lighter substances such as marijuana or Adderall.” (Tr. 35-36, 44.) Applicant states that he
would not have used marijuana if he understood it was a problem for his security clearance
eligibility. (Tr. 44.)
As  of  March  2016,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  by  his  treating  psychiatrist  with
cannabis  use  disorder, severe,  but  in  remission.  (GE  6.)  During  his May  2017  subject
interview, Applicant admitted that he has friends who currently use marijuana, and that his
roommates use marijuana in their home, but not in his presence. He indicated that he
made a personal choice to stop using marijuana, but when asked about his future intent,
he expressed “a reasonable expectation” that he may smoke marijuana in the future, once
every few years, depending on the situation. (GE 2.) During his psychological evaluation for
the DOD in October 2018, Applicant admitted to the evaluating psychologist that he used
marijuana as recently as 2016 and would be open to using marijuana again. He also stated
that, although his friends use marijuana, he has been able to refrain from using it. (GE 3.)
Applicant knew that marijuana use remains illegal under federal law, notwithstanding the
state’s decriminalization of recreational use of marijuana. (Tr. 46.)
At his hearing in March 2020, Applicant expressed a willingness to abstain from
marijuana  use  if  he  is  granted  a  clearance.  (Tr.  34,  44.)  He  testified  that  he  would
“potentially” use marijuana in the future if he does not have a clearance. (Tr. 34.) Applicant
lived with persons who used marijuana from September 2016 to September 2018. Within a
few  months  of  his  March  2020  security  clearance  hearing,  he  was  at  a  small  social
gathering  with  persons  who  smoked  marijuana  in  his  presence.  He  did  not  use  any
marijuana at that time because he had no desire to use it, as he “generally” does not enjoy
it at this point in his life. (Tr. 45-46.) As to why then he would then consider the possibility
of future marijuana use, especially given its illegality under federal law, Applicant testified:
That’s a legitimate question. Part of it is just out of curiosity, just to see if [it]
still affects me in the way that it does right now, in the way that provokes just
anxiety. (Tr. 46.)
Applicant used Adderall without a prescription about once every two to three months
from 2002 to 2005. He obtained the drug from friends. (GE 2.) While he was in college,
Applicant used Adderall or Concerta “a handful of times” from January 2007 to January
2008 as a study aid. The drugs were not prescribed for him. (GEs 1-2.) During his May
2017 subject interview with the OPM investigator, he denied any intention to misuse either
Adderall or Concerta in the future. (GE 2.) Yet, he used Adderall recreationally at a party in
July 2018 while socializing with some friends from college. The drug was given to him by a
friend who had a prescription. (GE 3; Tr. 35.) Applicant did not think his substance misuse
was a problem for his clearance eligibility because he did not have a serious drug problem
and his use was of a “lighter substance.” In hindsight, he would not have used it had he
realized it posed a problem for his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 35-36.) Applicant knew that
taking a drug not legally prescribed for him was against the law, but he did not think much
of it because “[it] was in a controlled environment, private environment. And there was no
potential of harm to [himself] or others at the time.” (Tr. 53.)
The licensed clinical psychologist, who evaluated Applicant for the DOD in October
2018, expressed her belief that his marijuana use poses no significant risk to his judgment,
reliability, or trustworthiness, given he had not used the drug with any regularity since 2005.
His use of Adderall in July 2018 was “a moment of poor judgment, especially considering
his mental health conditions and the fact that he is in the process of undergoing a security
clearance determination. The psychologist opined that Applicant’s drug use did not meet a
clinical level of pathology, and that more often than not, Applicant is able to make good
decisions. However, she deferred to the adjudicators as to whether his recent misuse of a
stimulant in July 2018 is relevant to his security worthiness. (GE 3.)
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant drank alcohol a few times in high school, but he did not enjoy it. After two
years at a community college, he transferred to a four-year university in January 2007. He
was pulled over in 2009 and failed a field sobriety test, but he was not charged with an
alcohol offense. (GE 3.) While at the university, Applicant began drinking six or more beers
on the weekends at bars to be social. In September 2010, he started graduate school. He
socialized  with  others  who  drank  alcohol,  and  over  the  next  two  years,  his  drinking
increased to five to seven days per week, three to four beers on weeknights and five to six
beers on the weekends. As of March 2011, Applicant reported drinking alcohol two days
during the work week, up to three drinks per day, and six drinks on both weekend nights.
(GE 4.) In February 2011, Applicant had been advised by his psychologist that his drinking
was likely exacerbating his depression. Applicant was reportedly mildly defensive with his
psychologist about his drinking, and expressed that it was the only really bright spot in his
week in that alcohol helped him feel less anxious. Despite being advised of the risk that
alcohol posed for his bipolar disorder, Applicant did not plan to quit drinking, although he
told his psychologist he would consider reducing his weekday consumption. (GE 5.)  In late
May  2011,  Applicant  admitted  to  his  then  treating  psychiatrist  that  he  was  consuming
seven to eight drinks on Friday and Saturday nights regularly to get drunk, and three to four
drinks two other nights of the week. (GE 4.)
In October 2011, Applicant acknowledged to his mental health providers that he was
drinking too much. He was drinking daily up to five beers at a sitting during the week and
more on the weekends. Applicant expressed no interest in ceasing his alcohol use. (GE 5.)
In March 2016, Applicant’s current psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use
disorder, moderate. Applicant regularly engaged in binge drinking (in excess of six drinks in
an evening) since he began treatment with the psychiatrist in 2013. (GE 6.) However, the
psychiatrist told the DOD-contracted clinical psychologist in October 2018 that Applicant
has shown an ability to control his alcohol use, as demonstrated by periods of voluntary
sobriety for a couple of months at a time, and that he had never recommended to Applicant
that he refrain from all alcohol use. Given Applicant uses alcohol to alleviate his anxiety in
social situations, his treatment with his psychiatrist has focused on strengthening other
coping skills. (GE 3.)
The clinical psychologist, who evaluated Applicant for the DOD in October 2018,
indicated that Applicant’s use of alcohol is of concern because it exceeds general medical
recommendations for the use of alcohol per the National Institute of Health’s guidelines,
and he may be self-medicating his anxiety with alcohol instead of relying on psychological
or pharmacological methods. She diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, mild, but
expressed  her  opinion  that  Applicant’s  alcohol  use  did  not  present  an  acute  security
concern because the amount Applicant consumes is “mediated by age-normative social
experiences in which alcohol is commonly seen as a social lubricant;” his alcohol use has
not impaired his work; and it is not contrary to his treating psychiatrist’s recommendations.
The psychologist found that Applicant did not minimize his alcohol use and concluded that
his use of alcohol did not rise to the point of impaired judgment. (GE 3.)
Applicant testified that his treating psychiatrist has recommended that he consume
less alcohol. (Tr. 41.) About 90% of Applicant’s drinking has been social, but he also drinks
alcohol to relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression. Since at least May 2017, Applicant
has played trivia at a bar on Tuesday nights with friends. (GE 2.) As of October 2018,
Applicant reported that he was drinking alcohol (usually beer) five to seven days per week,
in  quantities  of  three  to  five  beers  on  weeknights  and  six  beers  at  a  sitting  on  the
weekends. He had hangovers a few times per month. He expressed his belief that he
drinks too much, but it helps him to feel more confident and less anxious. (GE 3; Tr. 41.)
As of March 2020, Applicant was playing “bar trivia” and billiards at a bar. He started doing
trivia as an undergraduate in college and has been playing in a pool league for about a
year. (GE 2; Tr. 37-38, 47-48.) He had a “dry January” in 2020 where he abstained from
alcohol  for  one  month.  He  had  no  intention  to  maintain  abstinence  from  alcohol  and
resumed drinking (usually beer) in his previous pattern of two or three drinks almost every
night  and  five  to  six  drinks  on  the  weekends  over  a  course  of  about  five  hours  while
socializing  with  friends,  frequently  at  his  apartment.  (Tr.  50-52.)  As  of  March  2020,
Applicant was drinking to intoxication “not each night of the week, but more so than not
probably.” (Tr. 39-40.) Applicant now believes his alcohol use is having a negative health
effect in terms of long-term disadvantages should he continue to use alcohol to alleviate
symptoms  of  depression  and  anxiety.  (Tr.  41-42.)  He  has  been  trying  to  reduce  his
consumption for years, but the motivation to change is “not super strong.” (Tr. 49.) He
considers his alcohol use a “personal concern” that does not impact his professionalism or
ability to handle classified information. (Tr. 44.)
Work Reference
Applicant enjoys his job. He has missed work at times due to his depression, but his
supervisor is supportive.  (GE 3.) Applicant has had the same supervisor since August
2012.  Applicant’s  supervisor  described  Applicant  as  “a  dependable  and  dedicated
coworker with keen insights, great analytic skills, and a terrific knack for working in a team.”
Applicant is willing to assist his coworkers, and is a mentor to junior staff. He has good time
management skills, is diligent about his work, and takes project objectives seriously, often
working beyond regular hours to meet tight deadlines. Applicant always represents their
employer well when interacting with clients. His supervisor expressed complete confidence
in Applicant and his character.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations except SOR ¶
1.f, which he denied. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in
my findings of fact. The facts alleged in the SOR are identified by parenthetical citations
to the SOR in italics and bold print.
Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  information  technology  (IT)  specialist  employed  by  a
defense contractor. He is a site lead and supervises an eight-member team. (Tr. 23-24.)
He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  November  2012  to  March  2019  and
received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  was  discharged  early  after  a  medical  evaluation
board  determined  that  he  was  suffering  from  fibromyalgia,  a  musculoskeletal  disorder
often accompanied by  fatigue,  sleep issues,  and mood issues.1  (Tr.  23-24.)  He  held a
security  clearance  while  on  active  duty  and  retained  it  as  the  employee  of  a  defense
contractor. (Tr. 6.) He married in May 2011 and has two children and two stepchildren.
(Tr. 23.) He has taken college classes online but does not have a degree. (GX 2 at 5.)
In  February  2014,  while  deployed  overseas,  Applicant  complained  of  daily
headaches and chest pain. He was sent back to the United States before completing his
tour of duty. (Tr. 25.) In the United States, he underwent a CT scan of his head and brain
to determine the cause of more than two months of daily headaches and dizziness. The
scan reflected “no appreciable parenchymal mass, hemorrhage, or edema” and no acute
intracranial abnormality. The medical report recommended that an MRI be conducted if
clinical  concerns  persisted.  (AX  B.)  He  received  no  treatment,  except  for  injections  of
Botox to relieve his headaches. (Tr. 27.)
1 The fibromyalgia definition is at www.mayoclinic.org/diseases/conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms-causes.
In  early  2017,  Applicant  was  again  deployed  overseas  and  separated  from  his
family.  In April and  May  2017,  Applicant  went  to  his  unit’s  behavioral health clinic and
reported that he was irritable and tired and experiencing stress to due poor leadership in
his  unit.  He  was  diagnosed  with  an  adjustment  disorder  with  anxiety  and  depressed
mood. (GX 4 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he experienced recurrent and severe
headaches. He was in a high-pressure job, working 12-hour shifts, and unable to sleep.
He  testified  that  he  sought  medical  help,  but  his  supervisors  made  him  cancel  his
appointments. He told his superiors that he had considered suicide. (Tr. 28.) (SOR ¶ 1.a)
He threatened his detachment sergeant and platoon sergeant, because he believed they
were the cause of his continuous pain. (Tr. 29) (SOR ¶ 1.b) An incident report reflects
that he threatened to “kill/injure” them, but he testified at the hearing that he wanted to
hurt  them  but  not  kill  them.  (GX  3;  Tr.  29-30.)  He  was  admitted  as  an  inpatient  in  a
psychiatric  unit  during  June  and  July  2017  and  was  prescribed  sleep  medication  and
psychotropic medications. (SOR ¶ 1.c) He was moved to a less stressful job, where he
quickly established himself as a solid worker and a natural leader. His commander, an
Army  captain,  described  him  as  one  of  the  top  performers  in  his  command  and
recommended him for promotion. (AX F.)
In  August  2017,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  a  major  depressive  disorder  in
partial remission. (SOR ¶ 1.g) He received “maintenance therapy” until December 2017.
In  March  2018,  Applicant  was  evaluated  at  a  behavioral  health  clinic  and
diagnosed with an adjustment disorder. A psychiatrist reported that he had “limited coping
skills,  persistent  depression,  and  work-related  stressors  for  which  he  has  few  coping
skills.”  (SOR  ¶  1.h)  In  January  2019,  a  psychiatrist  diagnosed  him  with  persistent
depressive disorder with work-related stress, few coping skills and adjustment disorder
with disturbance of emotions and conduct. (GX 4 at 2.) (SOR ¶ 1.i.)
In  February  2019,  after  Applicant  returned  to  the  United  States,  a  psychologist
evaluated him while was on terminal leave pending the results of a medical evaluation
board. In her report, the psychologist expressed concern about the accuracy of the tests
that she administered because she believed Applicant presented himself in an extremely
positive  light  by  denying  many  minor  faults  and  shortcomings  that  most  people
acknowledge. However, she also noted that during the psychological interview that “he
was forthcoming and did not appear to be attempting to portray himself in a positive light.”
(GX 4 at 5.)
The  psychologist  noted  Applicant’s  history  of  suicidal  ideation  and  threatening
behavior. She found significant thought dysfunction, based on persecutory ideation such
as  believing  that  others  seek  to  harm  him.  She  noted  that  Applicant  believed  that  his
noncommissioned  officer  (NCO)  followed  him  to  make  sure  that  he  kept  his  medical
appointments, that his NCO punished him without cause, that his NCO stole his work and
presented it as his own, and that his NCO “talked trash” about him. She also noted that
Applicant made his own appointment in violation of normal protocol, after being told that
the evaluation could only be scheduled through his security officer, and she concluded
that his violation of the scheduling protocol evidenced an unwillingness to follow rules and
a disregard for instructions.
The  psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with  dysthymic  disorder,  a  form  of
depression, but ruled out a personality disorder. (SOR ¶ 1.d) She concluded that, based
on his history of high risk, irresponsible, aggressive, antisocial, or emotionally unstable
behavior, there may be a material deficit in his ability or willingness to properly safeguard
classified information or perform sensitive duties, especially if he was not happy with his
assignment  or  believed  he  knew  a  better  way  to  perform  his  duties.  (SOR  ¶  1.e)  She
concluded

trustworthiness  and  could  cause  unwillingness  or  resistance  to  follow  rules  and

The  psychologist  apparently  based  her  conclusion  about  Applicant’s  inability  or
unwillingness to follow rule and regulations solely on his failure to follow the protocol for
scheduling  a  mental  health  evaluation.  The  record  reflects  no  disciplinary  or
administrative  measures  imposed  on  him  during  his  military  service  for  failure  to  obey
orders, follow instructions, or obey regulations.
The psychologist found that Applicant’s psychological functioning was stable and
that he did not report any significant symptoms of depression or anxiety at the time of her
evaluation. She concluded that his social functioning and occupational functioning were
good. However, she also concluded that her interview of Applicant revealed deficits or
problems  with  judgment  and  revealed  traits  that  could  affect  his  reliability  or
trustworthiness.  She  concluded  from  the  psychological  interview  that  his  current
psychiatric condition was stable, but that he likely has a chronic mood disorder that affects
his ability to cope with stressful situations.
Based  on  Applicant’s  record  of  seeking  assistance  from  behavioral  health
professionals, the psychologist concluded that he likely will seek help again if he feels the
need. She noted that Applicant reported that he is compliant with his medications, but she
expressed concern that noncompliance might cause him to decompensate to his previous
level  of  self-injury  or  threatening  behaviors.  Her  prognosis  was  “guarded”  because  of
Applicant’s  “inability  to  adequately  cope  with  his  personal  and  professional  stressors,
even though he seeks help when he feels that he needs it.” (GX 4 at 6-7.)
Applicant returned to the United States in early 2018. An Army staff sergeant who
was Applicant’s supervisor from February 2018 to March 2019 observed that he provided
“immaculate communications support” to his unit and that he demonstrated exceptional
leadership and decision-making and earned the trust of the command’s senior leadership
as well as his co-workers and immediate supervisor. (AX E.)
After Applicant’s discharge in March 2019, he sought medical treatment from the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He testified that his headaches returned but that the
VA medical personnel kept giving him intravenous injections and sending him home. (Tr.
21.)
At  some  time  in  2019,  VA  medical  personnel  discovered  a  mass  growing  in
Applicant’s brain. In December 29, 2019, Applicant underwent a CT scan and an MRI, to
determine whether a pituitary mass growing in his brain was a pituitary adenoma (a slow-
growing  tumor  on  the  pituitary  gland).  (AX  A.)  The  MRI  reflected  a  “sellar  mass  with
suprasellar extension and areas of internal high density which may represent hemorrhage
and  pituitary  apoplexy.  (AX  L  at  4.)  He  was  admitted  to  a  hospital  immediately,  with
indications of “pituitary apoplexy with pituitary adenoma.” He underwent surgery, which
found hemorrhagic pituitary macro adenoma, and the pituitary mass was removed.  He
was released from the hospital on January 2, 2020. (AX M; AX O at 18.) A follow-up MRI
in March 2020 indicated that the surgery was successful and the mass was gone. (AX M;
AX O at 5; Tr. 32.) Applicant testified that the doctors told him that mass was at least
three or four years old. (Tr. 31.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  presented  medical  literature  reflecting  that  pituitary
adenomas  can  cause  recurrent  headaches,  anxiety,  decreased  concentration,  fatigue,
depression, and hormonal dysregulation that causes mood disorders. (AX C and D.) A
medical professional from the VA opined that Applicant’s depression, anxiety, and anger
were likely exacerbated by a brain tumor. (AX G.)
Applicant’s treatment plan provides for annual CT scans for the next five years.
(Tr.  47.)  He  is  also  being  treated  by  an  endocrinologist,  because  the  pituitary  gland
dysfunction  damaged  his  hormonal  system.  He  testified  that  his  headaches  are  less
severe, and he treats them with over-the-counter drugs instead of the stronger drugs that
he received previously. His mood is “happier.” (Tr. 32-33.)
Applicant  continues  to  receive  treatment  for  his  mental  health.  He  takes
Propranolol  (an  anti-anxiety  drug)  and  Cymbalta  (an  antidepressant).  He  sees  a
behavioral health professional from the VA once a month. (Tr. 37.) His VA provider states
that he has been compliant with his treatment. (AX G.)
Two co-workers who have observed Applicant during the past year attested to his
technical skill, leadership skill, and his trustworthiness under pressure, which led to his
promotion to a leadership position one month after beginning his current job,. One co-
worker commented specifically on his communication skills and management style that
make customers and his team members feel important and valued. (AX I; AX J.)
An Air Force senior master sergeant who is Applicant’s government office manager
describes him as motivated, hard-working, and skilled. He states: “I have been impressed
by his strong communication skills and his ability to establish a comfortable rapport with
others. He comes across as confident, mature, and highly capable to handle short notice
taskers. . . . ” (AX K.)

Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  of  science  degree  in accounting in 2011, and he
earned a master’s degree in the same field in 2014. (Tr. 17) He has been working as a
consultant for an accounting firm since June 2016. (GE 1 at 11)
In August 2016, Applicant’s girlfriend caught him cheating on her. (Answer at 5)
Applicant had engaged in infidelity, with random strangers whom he met online, 20 to 30
times in the previous 12 months before  his girlfriend discovered it. (Tr. 30) Applicant’s
“feeling of powerlessness to stop [his] behavior drove [him] to attempt” suicide by ingesting
three bottles of prescription medicines. (Answer at 5) Fortunately, Applicant began vomiting
immediately after ingesting the pills, and was admitted into a ten-day inpatient psychiatric
program.  (Answer  at  4)  Upon  discharge,  he  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  disorder  and
prescribed  various  medications.  Since  then,  Applicant  has  been  attending  therapy
approximately every two weeks and seeing a psychiatrist every two months to monitor his
medication. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 21)) In addition, he began attending a sexual-addictions support
group  for  his  promiscuous  behavior.  He  attended  the  support  group  meetings  for
approximately 18 months.
Applicant’s  mental-health  condition  is characterized  by  manic behavior.  (Tr. 22)
When Applicant is in a manic state he becomes “overly energetic” and anxious, prompting
him to engage in impulsive behavior in an attempt to calm himself, such as promiscuous,
risky sex with strangers and excessive shopping. (Tr. 22, 30; GE 6 at 4) From 2002 to
2009, Applicant drank alcohol excessively to manage his symptoms. (Tr. 22) Excessive
alcohol consumption is no longer a problem.
Ascertaining the proper balance of medications was challenging. Specifically, if the
daily amount of Applicant’s anti-anxiety prescription was too small, he would continue to
experience anxiety. Conversely, if the prescribed dosage was too high, Applicant would
become depressed. Things “finally clicked” for Applicant with respect to a proper balance of
medication approximately a year and a half ago. (Tr. 41- 42)
Applicant has been taking his medication “religiously, every morning and night.” (Tr.
35) His therapist taught him coping strategies for dealing with his bipolar disorder. He has
not cheated on his girlfriend since the 2016 episode that prompted his suicide attempt, and
he  has  not  engaged  in  any  other  risky,  impulsive  behavior.  Now,  when  Applicant
occasionally experiences manic feelings, he responds by “hyperfocus[ing] on work and
walking his dog. (GE 5 at 1) His work history shows a pattern of stability. (GE 6)
In  September  2018,  Applicant  underwent  a  psychological  evaluation  from  an
independent medical examiner. (GE 6) Per the psychologist, although Applicant “appears
to be on a positive trajectory in terms of remediating what has been a longstanding mental-
health condition,  he still has a medical condition that could negatively impact his judgment,
reliability,  and  trustworthiness  in  the  context  of  safeguarding  sensitive  information  and
working in a cleared setting.”(GE 6 at 6-7) Specifically, Applicant, during his consultation,
demonstrated limited self-awareness and only minimally monitored what he was saying,
leading the psychologist to conclude that “[Applicant’s] talkativeness along with residual
impulsivity led [the psychologist] to believe that a nefarious person could extract sensitive
information from [Applicant] with little effort.” (GE 6 at 6)
Approximately  a  year  after  the  psychological  examination  with  the  independent
medical  examiner,  Applicant’s  treating  therapist  prepared  a  report.    Applicant  began
receiving treatment from her in April 2018 and he continued to consistently attend therapy
sessions through August 19, 2019, when she prepared her report. (GE 5) Per the therapist,
Applicant  still  experienced  manic  episodes;  however,  he  was  engaged  in  the  therapy
sessions, which focused on coping strategies for his manic and depressive symptoms. (GE
5) Her report does not address whether his mental-health disorder could affect his ability to
safeguard sensitive information.
Applicant has approximately $150,000 of delinquent debt. The majority of the debt
consists of delinquent income taxes ($27,730) and delinquent student loans ($119,000).
Applicant’s  financial  problems  began  in  2012  after  relocating  from  State  1  to  State  2.
Applicant was briefly responsible for two lease payments, as his girlfriend remained in their
State 1 residence for approximately a year until their lease expired. Shortly after Applicant
moved to State 2, his  ex-wife, a military member who had physical custody of their then
teenage daughter since the divorce, was deployed abroad, prompting Applicant who had
never previous had physical custody of his daughter more than two weeks per year, now
had to assume physical custody of the daughter during his ex-wife’s deployment. (Tr. 25)
Applicant recognized that continuing to support his girlfriend financially until she relocated
to  his  new  home  in  State  2,  while  at  the  same  time  taking  in  his  daughter  posed  a
tremendous financial burden; however, “in [his] particular manic state, [he] felt like [he]
could do it all.” (Tr. 25)
Overwhelmed, Applicant increased his income tax withholdings to generate more
take-home income. (Tr. 73) By 2017, he owed $15,800 in delinquent federal income taxes
from tax years 2012 through 2016, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 2.a, and he owed
approximately $14,000 in delinquent state income taxes. (Answer at 1) In 2017, Applicant
began satisfying his federal income-tax debt through a payment plan, under which he paid
the IRS $220 per month. (Tr. 79) Applicant has missed half of the scheduled payments,
and he has not made a payment in the past six months. (Tr. 80, 82) Recently, the IRS
applied a $2,000 refund from Applicant’s 2019 income tax return to the delinquency. (Tr.
27) The current debt totals $13,575. (AE A)
Applicant owes approximately $14,155 in delinquent state income taxes, as alleged
in SOR subparagraph 2.b. When he researched the delinquency, he realized that he had
not filed his tax returns for 2012 and 2014. After he filed these returns, the tax burden was
reduced to $7,140, as the refunds were applied to the delinquency. (Tr. 27; AE B) He then
set up a payment plan. He has not made any payments in more than a year. (Tr. 83-84)
The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraphs  2.c,  2.e,  2.f,  and  2.i  through  2.m  are
delinquent credit-card accounts, totaling approximately $6,200. Applicant has made no
payments  and  they  remain  outstanding.  (Tr.  88-89)  These  bills  became  delinquent  in
September  2017  after  Applicant  “drew  the  line”  and  concluded  that  he  could  not
simultaneously pay for mental-health treatment and meet his debt payments. (Tr. 97)
SOR subparagraph 2.d, totaling $2,275, is owed to a company that publishes study
materials for accountants. (Tr. 86; GE 1 at 13) Applicant disputes this bill, contending that
his then employer was supposed to have satisfied it. (Tr. 86) He provided no evidence in
support of this contention.
The debts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.g and 2.h are student-loan accounts.
They  total  approximately  $119,000.  In  April  2019,  Applicant  entered  a  rehabilitation
agreement to satisfy the loans. Under the plan, he was to pay $345 monthly for a ten-
month probationary period. (Tr. 90) If Applicant were to conform to the agreement, the
creditor would no longer consider the loan to be in delinquent status. (Tr. 90) Applicant
made  payments  for  the  first  three  months,  as  agreed,  but  he  missed  the  payment  for
August 2019. He provided evidence of a September 2019 payment, but he did not provide
any proof that he made the payments for October through December of 2019.
Applicant  earns  $114,000  per  year.  (Tr.  65)  He  has  $3,000  invested  in  a  401k
account. (Tr. 72) He has not attended any credit counseling. (Tr. 90) There is no record

Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  logistics  management  specialist  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  since  March  2006.  He  married  in  2015,  after  cohabitating  since
2012.  He  divorced  in  2016.  He  has  a  six-year-old  child,  and  he  shares  custody  of  the
child with his ex-wife. He currently lives with his fiancée, who has two children, ages 8
and 10. He received a security clearance in August 2009.
In 1997, while Applicant was in high school, he and some friends were at a party,
and they were mixing  liquid drain cleaner with aluminum foil in  two-liter plastic bottles.
The  chemical  reaction  made  the  bottles  explode.  Someone  was  alarmed  by  the  loud
noise  and  called  the  police,  and  Applicant  and  five  others  were  taken  into  custody.
Applicant’s  five  companions  were  released  to  their  parents.  Because  his  father  was
traveling and his mother did not want to drive at night on the highway, Applicant spent
the night in juvenile detention. (Tr. 83-84.)
Applicant attended  college from 1997  to  2001  but  did  not  graduate.  He  testified
that  he  was  very  sheltered  at  home,  to  the  extent  that  he  did  not  know  how  to  do
laundry or balance a checkbook. (Tr. 129.) Around 2000, he began consuming alcohol
infrequently,  but  he  quickly  increased  his  consumption  to  the  point  of  frequent
intoxication, regularly consuming 7-9 beers at a sitting. (Tr. 84.)
On  September  22,  2001,  Applicant  had  been  drinking  with  friends,  and  he  was
heavily intoxicated. A friend dropped Applicant off at his apartment. While walking to the
apartment, Applicant flicked a lighted cigarette into the bed of a pickup truck parked in a
carport and started a fire. The fire spread to the carport and four adjoining residences.
The truck and all four residences were destroyed. (GX 9 at 1-2; Tr. 85.)
On October 10, 2001, after another night of heavy drinking with friends, Applicant
flicked  a  cigarette  onto  the  carpet  in  a  hallway  of  his  apartment  building  and  ignited  a
small fire that he quickly extinguished. About a week later, he poured hair spray from a
pump bottle into a beer can and ignited it. He stumbled and ignited a fire in the hallway.
He  was  unable  to  extinguish  the  fire,  and  the  fire  department  was  summoned.  A  day
later, he dropped a lighted match onto a bed comforter and ignited it. (GX 9 at 2; tr. 85-
86.)
In  November  2001,  Applicant’s  father,  who  was  on  active  duty  at  the  time,
arranged to have him evaluated by a psychologist in the Navy Addictions Rehabilitation
Department. Applicant told the psychologist that he  had been diagnosed with attention
deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a child and treated with medication. He also
told the psychologist that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2000 and was
prescribed medication, but that he stopped taking the medication because he could not
drink  alcohol  while  on  the  medication.  He  told  the  psychologist  that  he  had  difficulty
controlling anger because of his bipolar disorder. The psychologist did not believe that
Applicant  was  open  and  forthcoming  during  their  interview.  He  commented  that
Applicant appeared to be seeking help in order to present himself in a positive light in
court.  The  Navy  psychologist  diagnosed  him  with  alcohol  abuse  but  did  not  diagnose
him with bipolar disorder. (GX 6.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that he was never
diagnosed  as  bipolar,  but  he  assumed  that  he  was  bipolar,  because  he  was  given  a
prescription for a drug used to treat bipolar disorder while he was in college. (Tr. 104-
05, 110.)
After  the  November  2001  evaluation,  Applicant  completed  a  two-week  alcohol-
awareness  program,  followed  by  a  third  week  of  intensive  treatment.  (Tr.  89-90.)  The
Navy  psychologist  recommended  that  he  abstain  from  alcohol.  Applicant  testified  that
he complied with the recommendation.  (Tr. 111.) The record does not reflect when he
resumed drinking or his level of consumption.  He now limits his consumption to one or
two drinks when he and his fiancée have a dinner “date” twice a month. (Tr. 123.) In his
2014  SCA,  he  was  asked,  “Have  you  EVER  received  counseling  or  treatment  as  a
result  of  your use  of  alcohol in  addition to  what  you  have  already  listed on  this form?”
He answered “No” and did not disclose his treatment in the Navy program. (GX 1 at 35.)
In  September  2002,  Applicant  was  tried  for  the  four  fire-related  events.  He
pleaded guilty to two felony counts of risking a catastrophe, two misdemeanor counts of
reckless endangerment, and two misdemeanor counts of criminal mischief. Two felony
counts  of  arson  were  nolle  prosequi  in  accordance  with  a  plea  agreement.  In  October
2002, he was sentenced to jail for four consecutive sentences of 3-6 months (totaling 12
to  24  months)  for  the  two  counts  of  risking  a  catastrophe  and  two  counts  of  reckless
endangerment,  and  he  was  sentenced  to  probation  for  the  two  counts  of  criminal
mischief. He was in jail until October 2003. (GX 1 at 32-33; GX 7.)
While Applicant was awaiting trial, he was employed as a cook in a local tavern.
The tavern owner’s son accused Applicant of damaging a restroom. When the owner’s
son kept questioning Applicant and “got in his face,” Applicant pushed him away, and an
altercation ensued. Applicant had not been drinking because he was at work. Applicant
was  “asked  to  leave,”  but  two  days  later  he  was  rehired.  (Tr.  87-88.)  No  criminal
charges were filed.
In June 2003, while in jail, Applicant completed an alcohol and drug educational
seminar and a 30-hour wellness-education program presented by the state department
of  corrections.  (AX  B;  AX  C.)  In  May  2011,  he  received  an  associate’s  degree  in
business management. In November 2012, he was on the dean’s list for the winter term,
and  he  was  inducted  into  a  national  technical  honor  society.  In  December  2013,  he
received an associate’s degree in information security technology. (AX D-H.)
Applicant started seeking psychotherapy around 2011-2012, after he learned that
his ex-wife was pregnant by her ex-husband. (Tr. 97.) He started having panic attacks,
and  his  psychotherapist  prescribed  an  anti-anxiety  medication.  (Tr.  93.)  He  did  not
disclose his treatment for anxiety in his 2014 SCA, apparently because it was related to
his marital problems. (GX 1 at 29.)
In  May  2014,  Applicant  was  involved  in  an  altercation  with  a  fellow  worker  that
was  triggered  when  his  fellow  worker  played  a  practical  joke  by  disconnecting  all  the
cables  from  Applicant’s  computer.  Applicant  was  convicted  of  assault  and  battery.  He
was  fined,  placed  on  administrative  leave,  and  was  permanently  barred  from  entering
the  military  installation  where  he  had  been  working.  The  permanent  bar  was  later
reduced to six months. (Tr. 108-09; GX 2; GX 3 at 20. In August 2014, he completed a
12-week psycho-educational program in anger management. (AX A.)
In February 2018, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist at
the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF.  The  psychologist  commented  that  Applicant  was  not
truthful  and  forthcoming  during  the  evaluation.  She  noted  that  he  denied  ever  having
symptoms of ADHD, and that he did not disclose his treatment for anxiety in his SCA.
She  administered  a  personality  assessment  inventory  but  found  that  the  results  were
not interpretable because the validity scales indicated that he was presenting himself in
an unrealistically favorable light. She reported that Applicant admitted starting only one
fire  and  claimed  that  he  was  present  at  the  other  fires  but  did  not  start  them.  She
reviewed  his  medical  records,  which  reflected  that  a  psychiatrist  diagnosed  Applicant
with  bipolar  disorder  in  2000.  She  also  commented  that  Applicant’s  medical  records
reflect  that  he  frequently  admitted  that  he  was  diagnosed  as  bipolar.  She  stated  her
ability to make a definitive diagnosis was limited, because Applicant appeared to have
withheld information about his mental health history. She concluded that Applicant “has
mental,  emotional,  or  personality  conditions  that  could  impair  judgment,  reliability,  or
trustworthiness.” Her diagnosis was (1) alcohol use disorder, remission status unknown;
(2)  bipolar  disorder,  most  recent  episode  depressed;  and  (3)  anxiety  disorder,
unspecified. (GX 4.)
A  long-time  friend  and  former  co-worker  describes  Applicant  as  sincere,  kind-
hearted, trustworthy, and hardworking. She describes him as a “doting father and caring
friend.” (AX J.) A deputy sheriff and former classmate considers Applicant trustworthy,
committed,  and  hardworking.  (AX  K.)  A  friend  who  has  known  him  for  more  than  25
years  considers  him  trustworthy,  dedicated,  hardworking,  compassionate,  and  a
wonderful father. (AX L.) A friend who has known him for more than 30 years considers
him caring, determined, and hardworking. (AX M.) Applicant’s fiancée knows him as an
honest and hardworking person and a loving father for his daughter as well as her two
children. (AX N.)
A psychologist, who has known Applicant for about nine years, submitted a letter
attesting to his positive attitude and integrity through difficult times and his honesty and
loyalty  to  family  and  country.  The  psychologist’s  relationship  with  Applicant  has  been
one of friendship rather than professional. (AX O.)
Applicant’s father, a retired U.S. Navy officer, is a co-owner and vice-president of
the  company  for  whom  Applicant  works.  He  submitted  a  statement  describing
Applicant’s  discovery  that  his  daughter  was  molested  by  her  half-brother,  his
subsequent  divorce,  and  the  contentious  custody  battle  that  followed  the  divorce.  He
states  that  Applicant  was  diagnosed  as  a  child  with  ADHD  without  hyperactivity.  He
states  that  Applicant  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  bi-polar  disorder  or  alcohol
dependence.  He  describes  Applicant  as  a  loving  father,  and  he  describes  Applicant’s
fiancée as a “wonderful woman.” (AX P.)
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  qualified  medical  health
professional  and  was  administered  a  substance-abuse  subtle-screening  inventory
(SASSI-4) and determined to have a low probability of a substance-abuse disorder. The
SASSI  reflected  a  “moderate  clinical  issue  with  defensiveness,”  but  the  clinician  who
administered  the  SASSI  did  not  observe  any  remarkable  defensiveness  during  the
administration of the SASSI or the biopsychosocial assessment. The evaluator did not
recommend substance-abuse treatment. (AX Q.)
Applicant  received  psychotherapy  from  three  medical  professionals  between
November  2017  and  March  2019.  He  saw  the  first  therapist  15  times  and  was
diagnosed  with  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),
and adjustment disorder with anxiety. He was transferred to another therapist after the
first therapist starting seeing his daughter, who had accused her half-brother of sexually
molesting her.
Starting in August 2018, the second therapist saw him  six times and diagnosed
him with generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and major depressive disorder, recurrent
and  moderate.  This  therapist  attributed  his  PTSD  in  large  part  to  trauma  during  his
previous  marriage  and  the  contentious  divorce  that  followed.  He  is  now  considered
emotionally stable, but occasionally is affected by stress and depression, mostly when
he  and  his  ex-wife  have  conflicts  in  their  co-parenting.  He  continues  to  receive
psychotherapy for anger management. He is in the clinical range for anxiety and PTSD,
but  his  aggressive  tendencies  and  anger  are  in  the  non-clinical  range.  He  has  no
indication  of  an  alcohol-abuse  disorder  and  is  not  bipolar.  This  therapist  concludes  by
stating that Applicant’s “current mental health assessments, observations, mental health
treatment,  and  his  personal  commitment  to  change  via  training  place  [him]  in  a
favorable light.” She continues to treat Applicant and sees him every two or three weeks
for about an hour. (Tr. 19-20.) She has never seen symptoms of a bipolar disorder. She
gives him a “good” prognosis. (Tr. 20-23.)
A third therapist evaluated Applicant in December 2018. He diagnosed Applicant
with  adjustment  disorder  with  mixed  disturbance  of  emotions  and  conduct,  which  was
considered an improvement from the two previous evaluations. (AX R.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  takes  an  anti-anxiety  medication  every  morning.
Although  his  prescription  allows  him  to  take  the  medication  “as  needed,”  he  has  not
needed  to  take  a  second  dose  during  the  day.  If  he  feels  a  sense  of  conflict,  he  has
learned to walk away, talk to himself, and ask himself how he should handle it. He no
longer needs to “harbor everything inside anymore.” Instead, he talks to one of his close
friends. (Tr. 93-94.)
The  co-owner  of  the  company  by  whom  Applicant  is  employed  has  known  him
since  he  was  first  employed  in  2006.  She  owns  51%  of  the  company  and  Applicant’s
father  owns  49%.  She  is  aware  of  the  Applicant’s  incarceration  in  2002  and  his
altercation  with  a  fellow  employee  in  2014.  She  believes  that  the  co-worker,  a  known
trouble-maker who is no longer employed by the company, was partly to blame for the
2014  incident.  She  believes  that  Applicant  has  matured  since  he  was  first  hired.  She
considers  him  emotionally  stable,  honest,  reliable,  and  trustworthy.  She  has  seen  no
signs of alcohol abuse. (Tr. 39-45.)
A  close  friend  of  Applicant,  who  served  on  active  duty  in  the  Navy  with
Applicant’s father, has known Applicant since 2000. She visited Applicant when he was
incarcerated.  For the past  three  years,  they  have  had  monthly  job-related  contact  and
personal  contact  about  every  other  month.  She  considers  Applicant  honest,  reliable,
and  hardworking.  She  believes  he  has  good  judgment.  She  has  never  observed  any
emotional  instability  or  excessive  alcohol  consumption.  She  believes  Applicant  was
remorseful about his mistakes and has worked hard to turn his life around. She testified
she would hire him “in a minute without hesitation. (Tr. 50-56,)
A  co-worker,  who  is  a  retired  master  chief  petty  officer,  has  had  daily  personal
and  professional  contact  with  Applicant  since  September  2018.  They  have  become
close  friends.  They  have  discussed  Applicant’s  past  conduct,  including  the  arson
incidents in 2002, the altercation in 2014, and his current mental health treatment. The
co-worker testified that he considers Applicant’s reliability “above reproach,” and he has
complete trust in his judgment. He has no doubts about Applicant’s emotional stability.
(Tr. 62-72.)
Applicant  has  held  a  second  job  as  a  contractor,  on  an  “as  needed”  basis,  for
about  four  years  for  a  company  that  owns  four  radio  stations.  His  supervisor  has
professional contact with him “every month at least” and social contact every month or
two.  His  supervisor browsed  the SOR but  did  not  read  it  carefully.  He  has  never seen
Applicant intoxicated. He considers Applicant mature, trustworthy, reliable, “honest to a
fault,” and a person with good judgment. He testified that Applicant had “some issues”
during his divorce proceedings, but he is usually “very even-keeled.” (Tr. 73-81.)
",False
"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant partially admitted, with comments, three of the
factual  allegations  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.c.).  He  denied  the  remaining
allegations. Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  maintenance  control  lead  with  his  current  employer  since  February  2010.  He
previously served as a product handler with a chemical company from March 2008 until
February  2010.  He  is  a  1996  high  school  graduate,  with  some  college  credits,  but  no
degree. Appellant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in October 2001, and he served on active
duty until August 2007, when he was honorably discharged as an airman 1st class (E-3).
Several  months  before  his  discharge,  Applicant  was  disciplined  by  Article  15,  Uniform
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violating a no-contact order with his estranged wife,
and he was reduced in grade from senior airman (E-4). (AE A; GE 2, at 15-19) Applicant
was married in 2001, and divorced in 2008. He remarried in 2008. He has two children,
born in 2004 and 2016. He was granted a top secret clearance in 2003.
Military Awards and Decorations
During his military career, Appellant received the Air Force Achievement Medal,
Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on
Terrorism Service Medal, the Air Force Longevity Service Award; the Air Force Training
Ribbon,  and  the  Air  Force  Outstanding  Unit  Award.  (AE  A  (Certificate  of  Release  or
Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214)) He was also the recipient of numerous letters
of  appreciation  issued  by  his  commanders  during  the  period  2003  to  2006.  He  was
repeatedly recognized as the staff professional of his squadron and group. (AE C)
Psychological Conditions
In April 2003, Applicant was diagnosed by the flight commander of the Life Skills
Support Center (LSSC) – a member of the Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) – as having
an  adjustment  disorder  with  mixed  anxiety  and  depressed  mood,  in  part  because  of
marital issues involving his wife’s $200 bar bill and a traumatic incident, described by his
wife as an assault upon her by an instructor during a business trip. Applicant was referred
to a family practice physician, and prescribed Xanax, a sedative used to treat anxiety and
panic disorder. His case was closed on April 14, 2003, with no follow-up required. (GE 5
(Medical Records), at 25-30)
During 2004, Applicant and his pregnant wife were in the midst of marital discord
and hostility, which eventually erupted into an ugly divorce and continuing child custody
battles involving the police, the courts, the command, and military medical personnel. On
May 12, 2004, Applicant started experiencing panic attacks, blurred vision, and dizziness,
so he sought emergency medical assistance. He was diagnosed with panic attack and
administered a low dose of Temazepam – used to treat anxiety and insomnia. He was
released. (GE 6 (Medical Records), at 79-90)
The following day, Applicant voluntarily went to the Life Skills Support Clinic at the
base, where he was diagnosed by another LSSC flight commander as having Axis I: panic
disorder without  agoraphobia  (fear of  places  and  situations),  and V61.1  problems  with
social environment – partner relationship problem, and he was scheduled for inquiry and
counseling  for  marital  conflict.  He  was  prescribed  Paxil  and  Ativan  as  needed  –  both
antidepressant medications approved for the treatment of anxiety. (GE 5, at 19-24) On
May 19, 2004, after a 45-minute interview for marital and partner problems, unspecified,
he was again diagnosed with the same Axis I disorders, and he was again released. He
was seen again for the same issues on June 2, 2004 (for 50 minutes); June 15, 2004 (for
35  minutes);  and  again  on  July  6,  2004  (for  35  minutes),  and  was  released  without
limitations. The July 6th diagnosis noted that the Axis I panic disorder without agoraphobia
was improved. Applicant needed no further follow up and the case was closed. (GE 5, at
15-18; GE 6, at 109-113)
There is one medical record in evidence that is inaccurate. It states that an incident
occurred on November 28, 2004, when Applicant was 28 years old (that encounter and
record could not have taken place in 2004, because Applicant was only 26-years old on
that  date).  On  that  date,  Applicant’s  1st  sergeant  supposedly  referred  him  to  the  chief,
social  work  services,  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker,  because  of  allegations  that
Applicant had threatened to kill his wife and daughter, as well as kill himself. Applicant
denied  the  allegations,  and  noted  that  he  and  his  wife  were  separated,  and  she  was
having an affair with a former friend. When he reported the situation to his commander,
the  commander  issued  a  no-contact  order  against  him.  However,  no  such  order  was
issued in 2004. A No Contact Order was issued against Applicant on February 13, 2007,
and again on April 30, 2007. (AE Y) Regardless of the date in issue, Applicant denied any
suicidal or homicidal ideations. Despite the nature of the allegations, no immediate follow-
up was ordered in the record, and Applicant was released. (GE 5, at 13)
On  November  29,  2006,  a  command-directed  evaluation  was  ordered,  and
Applicant went to the Mental Health Clinic. He was reportedly evaluated on that date and
on  December  1,  2006,  when  he  was  seen  for  45  minutes  regarding  the  adjustment
disorder  issues.  Although  Applicant  denied  any  suicidal  or  homicidal  ideations,  “given
incongruent  corroborating  information,  he  was  determined  to  be  at  significant  risk  of
potential  suicidal  and/or  homicidal action.”  The  “incongruent  corroborating  information”
was  not  described  or  identified.  The  licensed  clinical  psychologist  and  the  life  skills
element  chief  concluded  that  Applicant  “reflected  delusions  of  persecution  but  no
hallucinations.”  The  specifics  of  the  “delusions”  were  not  described  or  identified.  They
reported  a  diagnosis  of  Axis  I:  300.01,  V61.1,  as  well  as  rule  out  delusional  disorder,
persecutory  type  –  an  illness  characterized  by  at  least  one month  of  delusions  but  no
other psychotic symptoms. His Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale was 50,
lowered to 45: serious symptoms. (GE 5, at 9-12) At some point, Applicant was prescribed
Effexor  –  used  to  treat  depression,  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  and  panic  disorder.
Applicant  chose  to  not  attend  a  follow-up  appointment  with  the  licensed  clinical
psychologist. (GE 5, at 8) On December 19-20, 2006, he was again seen by the clinical
social worker regarding administrative purposes. (GE 6, at 75-89)
On February 26, 2007, Applicant presented himself at the clinic to be evaluated for
allegedly  making  statements  regarding  killing  his  wife  and  child,  comments  he  denied
making,  in  anticipation  of  appearing  in  court  the  following  day.  Despite  displaying  no
psychotic signs or paranoia, and denying any suicidal intent or plan, and having intact
judgment,  it  was  determined  that  he  was  “a  moderate  risk  to  self  and/or  others  based
upon  the  apparent  discrepancy  in  reports and  history  even  though he  currently  denies
[suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation],” and he was diagnosed as follows: Axis I: V61.12
physical abuse of adult. The previous disorder 300.01 was not mentioned. The specifics
of the “apparent discrepancy in reports and history” as well as the basis for the V61.12
diagnosis  were  not  described  or  identified.  Despite  the  moderate  risk  that  Applicant
supposedly displayed, he was not scheduled to be seen in a follow up for another week.
(GE 5, at 7)
On  March  23,  2007,  Applicant  was  seen  in  the  Family  Advocacy  Center  for  a
follow-up appointment. He reported that he had been disciplined and deemed ineligible
for  reenlistment,  and  was  scheduled  to  separate  from  active  duty  in  August  2007.
Apparently despondent over the entire turn of events, he said that the Air Force had failed
him and he no longer had any use for it.  He also said that “hitting a woman or child is
intolerable.” (GE 5, at 5) The record reports that in a previous visit, without specifying the
date of that visit, Applicant said that “this uniform and his daughter keep him from harming
his wife and her alleged boyfriend.” A report of such comments does not appear in any of
the  medical  records  submitted  to  me.  Upon  being  questioned  by  the  family  advocacy
officer, Applicant reportedly made several comments about his past as a member of the
Italian mafia, harming various individuals and intimidating others, but he later disputed
that scenario, claiming that he was merely discussing a television show, The Sopranos,
and song lyrics. (Tr. at 91-94, 115-116) When asked if he wanted to harm his wife and
her alleged boyfriend, he responded that if he wanted to do so, “they’d be gone already.”
He was diagnosed as follows: Axis I: V61.12 perpetrator of spouse abuse, and Axis II:
301.81  narcissistic  personality  disorder,  meets  criteria  1  (grandiose  sense  of  self-
importance), 2 (preoccupied with fantasies), 5 (sense of entitlement), 7 (lacks empathy),
and  9  (shows  arrogant,  haughty  behaviors  or  attitudes).  (GE  5,  at  6;  Diagnostic  and
Statistical  Manual  of  Disorders,  4th  Edition  –  Text  Revision  (DSM-IV-TR),  at  717)  The
previous disorder 300.01 was not mentioned. There is no explanation regarding the basis
of the source of the diagnosis “perpetrator of spouse abuse,” or the conclusions pertaining
to the criteria supporting the Axis II disorder. Despite the comments made, Applicant was
not  deemed  to  be  suicidal  or  homicidal,  and  the  risk  remained  moderate.  He  was
scheduled to return in two weeks for a risk assessment.
Thereafter, on three different occasions in April 2007, May 2007, and August 2007,
Applicant  was  reportedly  seen  by  the  same  licensed  clinical  psychologist.  The  same
diagnoses were carried over without any new evaluations. The April 2007 mental health
record indicated that a Treatment Team Meeting (TTM) was conducted, and that a full
Family Advocacy (FA) report was attached. No such report was in the file. (GE 5, at 4)
During the May 2007 session, one week before Applicant was scheduled to commence
his  terminal  leave  (May  11,  2007),  Applicant  stated  that  during  his  last  session  with  a
particular provider, he “finally talked about his real issues.” There is no medical record in
evidence to reflect that particular session. No diagnostic changes were made. (GE 5, at
2-3) Although there was no session conducted thereafter, there is a Mental Health Record
made by the licensed clinical psychologist that the record was being closed. That record
contains  the  following  statement:  “the  impact  of  the  treatment  of  military  was
administratively  discharged  from  active  duty  service  based  on  the  results  of  the
[Command Directed Evaluation] and diagnosis of personality disorder.” (GE 5, at 1) That
characterization  is  patently  false,  and  without  any  basis  in  fact,  and  the  source  of  the
comment is not known. Separation action was never initiated, and the Separation Code
on Applicant’s DD Form 214 was expiration of term of service, and his Reentry Code was
serving suspended punishment to Art. 15. (AE A; Tr. at 99-100)
Despite  a  plethora  of  clinical  notes  and  session  reports,  none  of  the  Air  Force
healthcare providers who interviewed, evaluated, diagnosed, or treated Applicant actually
performed a mental health evaluation as described in DOD Instruction  (DODI) 6490.4,
Requirements for Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the  Armed Forces (August
28, 1997); DOD Instruction 6490.1, Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Armed
Forces  (October  1,  1997);  or  The  American  Psychiatric  Association  (APA)  Practice
Guideline for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults, 2nd Edition (June 2006). A mental health
evaluation under DODI 6490.4 shall consist of, at a minimum:
A  clinical  interview  and  mental  status  examination  and  may  include,
additionally: a review of medical records; a review of other records, such as
the  Service  personnel  record;  information  forwarded  by  the  Service
member’s commanding officer; psychological testing; physical examination;
and laboratory and/or other specialized testing. Interviews conducted by
the  Family  Advocacy  Program  .  .  .  are  not considered  mental health
evaluations  for  the  purpose  of  [DODI  6490.1  .  .  .  and  [DODI  6490.4].
(Emphasis supplied) (DODI 6490.4, Enc. 2, § E2.1.6)
There  are  the  repeated  presence  of  terms  such  as  suicidal  ideation,  homicidal
ideation,  and  depression  in  the  clinical  records,  but  not  one  of  the  clinical  records  in
evidence indicates that any psychological testing was administered. There is no mention
of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, 2nd revised version (MMPI-2), used
for  measuring  adult  psychopathology;  the  Columbia  Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale  (C-
SSRS) to gather lifetime history of suicidality as well as any recent suicidal ideation or
behavior;  the  Personality  Assessment  Inventory  (PAI)  to  assess  emotional  and
personality functioning; the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale - 24 (BASIS – 24)
to assess the outcome of mental health or substance abuse treatment from the client’s
perspective; the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, 3rd Edition (MCMI-III) to measure 24
personality  disorders  in  assisting  clinicians  in  psychiatric  diagnoses,  developing  a
treatment approach, and guiding treatment decisions; the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-2)  to  screen,  diagnose,  monitor,  and  measure  the  severity  of  depression;  the
Patient  Health  Questionnaire  (PHQ-9)  to  screen,  diagnose,  monitor,  and  measure  the
severity of depression; the Screening for Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 2 (GAD - 2), to
screen generalized anxiety; or the Screening for Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD
- 7) to screen generalized anxiety.
Moreover, while there are several diagnoses, the clinicians failed to indicate why
or how those impressions were specifically reached. Applicant repeatedly denied suicidal
ideations  despite  constant  probing  about  his  reported  disorders.  He  felt  that  he  was
wrongfully suspected of having suicidal ideations or homicidal ideations, as well as what
he considered false allegations against him by his wife and her boyfriend, and he was
disappointed that the Air Force had failed him in summarily believing the worst about him,
and disciplining him. At that point, he simply quit and started discussing the Italian mafia,
a television show, and some song lyrics. His position was seen as reluctance, sometimes
referred  to  as  resistance,  and  was  considered  unacceptable,  and  it  was  not  otherwise
examined  or  analyzed  by  the  clinicians,  although  such  an  action  is  acknowledged  in
psychoanalysis.
Sigmund Freud defined resistance as “whatever interrupts the progress of analytic
work,” such as being late, missing a session, “holding back” your thoughts in the moment
(i.e., refusing to speak about them) or avoiding a particular issue. In its most simple and
practical sense, resistance results from fear. On the other hand, Jacques Lacan, a French
psychoanalyst  and  psychiatrist,  warned  not  to  confuse  resistance  with  defense and
formulated the famous statement that “there is no other resistance to analysis than that
of  the  analyst  himself.”  In  other  words,  if  the  psychotherapist  makes  interpretations  or
interventions  that  are  clinically  inaccurate,  the  client  will  get  defensive,  and  that  will
interrupt the therapeutic work. In plain English, this means that a client will only explore
therapeutic  material  so  far  as  is  comfortable  in  the  moment;  the  psychotherapist,
therefore, must always be aware of just how far the client is willing to go and not “push”
the client beyond these temporary limits. Imprudent attempts to push a client can end up
pushing the client right out of psychotherapy, which seems to be the reason why Applicant
chose not to fully participate in it. (http://www.guidetopsychology.com/btypes.htm, citing

As noted above, Applicant’s relationship with his wife eventually erupted into an
ugly  divorce  and  continuing  child  custody  battles  involving  the  police,  the  courts,  the
command,  and  military  medical  personnel.  His  wife  started  filing  actions  against  him
shortly  before  she  filed  for  divorce.  First  there  were  allegations  that  Applicant  had
threatened her and their daughter as well as a report that Applicant had threatened his
wife’s boyfriend, both of which severely limited Applicant’s access to his daughter, and
resulted  in  the  issuance  of  protective  orders  against  Applicant,  as  well  as  his  being
diagnosed for physical abuse of an adult. There are no statements from either Applicant’s
wife or her boyfriend in evidence to support any of those actions. The Military Protective
Order  cites  as  the  sole  basis  for  the  issuance  of  the  order  that  Applicant’s  wife  “is
concerned for her safety and [Applicant has] shown behavior that could be interpreted as
threatening.” (AE  Y).  Applicant  was  subsequently  disciplined  and reduced  in  grade for
reportedly violating the no-contact orders, despite his assertions that her allegations were
baseless. Without substantially more information, there is nothing upon which to interpret
threatening behavior, or violations. Likewise, there is no information, statement, or police
report to support the basis for the issuance of no-contact orders, temporary injunctions,
or the disciplinary punishment.
During 2006 and 2007, there were a number of temporary injunctions for protection
against domestic violence with minor children filed against Applicant (AE H; AE J; AE L),
as  well  as  an  attempt  to  acquire  child  custody  (AE  I);  and  motions  for  extensions  of
injunction from protection against domestic violence. (AE K; AE Q) Applicant had to file a
motion for contempt and imposition of sanctions against his wife in 2007, because she
refused to comply with his child visitation rights. (AE P) The Final Judgment of Divorce
was  entered  January  16,  2008.  (AE  G)  Applicant’s  ex-wife  filed  three  motions  for  civil
contempt against Applicant in 2012, but all of them were denied, including one for a late
payment of $5.25 as part of a check that she refused to accept. (AE W) She also claimed
that  Applicant  had  sexually  abused  their  daughter  in  2012,  but  that  charge  was
subsequently dropped.
On October 2, 2012, on January 23, 2013, and again on March 20, 2013, Applicant
attended a Deprivation Hearing, based on a complaint filed on behalf of Applicant’s ex-
wife. During that hearing, Applicant’s ex-wife testified that before their divorce, Applicant
purchased a handgun and threatened to shoot her with it and take their daughter away.
She reported the threat and the military took his weapon away. When he did it a second
time, another handgun was taken from him, and under the local Baker Act – an existing
law that provides for temporary institutionalization of individuals who meet certain criteria.
It  can  only  be  used  by  specific  authorized  persons,  including  judges,  mental  health
professionals,  law  enforcement  personnel,  and  doctors.  More  importantly,  the  law  is
limited  by  the  fact  that  those  officials  must  have  sound  evidence  suggesting  that  the
individual might meet the Act’s definition for mental illness. In addition, he must pose a
risk of harm to himself or others – or demonstrate self-neglect. It should be noted that the
statutory criteria require more than mere suspicion of mental illness or potential risk. The
statute specifically calls for “substantial” evidence, which is much higher bar than simple
suspicion.  As  a  result,  people  cannot  be  involuntarily  institutionalized  simply  because
they’re  acting  strangely,  refuse  to  seek  psychiatric  examinations,  or  have  occasional
mood swings or outbursts.
Applicant’s ex-wife described their daughter as always crying before, during, and
after her interactions with Applicant. However, the guardian ad litem expressed that she
had no concerns about the child being around Applicant or his weapons. Nevertheless,
Applicant’s  ex-wife  argued  that  Applicant  should  be  disqualified  from  possessing  a
concealed weapon because he had been in a mental hospital. (AE W) The matter was
finally dropped, and Applicant was, once again, granted full visitation rights.
In 2017, the DOD CAF referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation. He was
interviewed for an unspecified period and administered only one psychological test: the
PAI,  but  the  results  of  that  test  were  deemed  invalid.  In  a  psychological  report,  dated
November  21,  2017,  that  clinician  noted  that  she  had  reviewed  “the  medical  record,”
without  identifying  any  of  the  specific  documents,  and  she  discounted  several  of
Applicant’s  comments  as  being  at  odds  with  information  that  was  in  the  unidentified
materials furnished to her by the DOD CAF: that he has a history of hospitalization for
suicidal  and  homicidal  ideation;  that  he  had  been  discharged  due  to  the  results  of  a
command  directed  evaluation  and  diagnosis  of  personality  disorder;  that  a  review  of
medical  records  indicates  scenarios  involving  threats  to  his  ex-wife’s  boyfriend;  that
Applicant’s denials regarding threats of violence to his ex-wife and her now-husband are
inconsistent with the accounts of events in the records furnished; that Applicant’s denials
of any history of suicidal or homicidal ideation are refuted by the records to the contrary;
that  he  denied  other  events  that  are  noted  within  the  record;  that  he  tends  to  portray
himself as being exceptionally free of common shortcomings to which most individuals
will admit; and that Applicant’s comments regarding disputed information is considered to
be of questionable validity. (GE 3) The psychologist concluded:
Applicant has a documented history of narcissistic personality disorder, but
interestingly  also  shows  some  of  the  atypical  thinking  (unusual  beliefs,
paranoia), odd speech, and social skill deficits (lack of close friends, social
awkwardness) commonly seen in an individual with schizotypal personality
disorder.
The diagnosis in this case would render the patient in need of consistent
treatment (until symptoms remit, which is uncommon with diagnosis of this
nature), but this has clearly not occurred at this point. My prognosis is poor,
given the ingrained nature of his issues and poor likelihood for treatment
compliance.  His  psychological  symptoms  could  certainly  impede  his
judgment. . . Based upon his legal history, volatile mood and behaviors, and
his history of interpersonal conflicts, it appears that [Applicant] is likely to
have impaired reliability. (GE 3)
Because  of  the  lack  of  specificity  in  the  psychological  report,  especially  when  it
comes to source documentation upon which Applicant’s comments were not accepted,
as well as to the source documentation or other information upon which the psychologist
relied  to  find  the  presence  of  unusual  beliefs,  paranoia,  odd  speech,  and  social  skill
deficits  (lack  of  close  friends,  social  awkwardness),  and  the  absence  of  psychological
testing, it is unclear if the psychologist complied with the requirements of DODI 6490.4,
Mental  Health  Evaluations  of  Members  of  the  Military  Services  (March  4,  2013);  DOD
Instruction 6490.1, Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Armed Forces (October
1, 1997); or even the APA Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults –
3rd Edition (2016). In this regard, while Applicant is not currently a member of the military
services, it remains unclear if the DODIs have been adopted for DOD CAF purposes with
respect to government contractors. Accordingly, the thoroughness and accuracy of the
evaluation report remain open to question.
Work Performance and Character References
The former officer-in charge of the unit where Applicant served between October
2004 and July 2006, stated that Applicant displayed exceptional positive characteristics
in duty performance, leadership qualities and in his personal life. His dedication to the
mission  was  always  exhibited  through  outstanding  performance.  He  volunteered  for
several  events.  Off  duty,  Applicant  attended  church  and  played  softball  for  his  church
team. Applicant was one of his hardest-working, knowledgeable troops that he would not
only want working in his section, but one day running it. (AE B)
The former operations officer of the squadron considered Applicant to be a critical
member of the unit whose performance was never less than exceptional. Applicant’s duty
performance,  military  bearing,  and  professionalism  were  of  the  highest  level.  Not  only
was he skilled in his primary duties, but he continuously  sought additional workload to
ease the burden on fellow colleagues. He would, without hesitation, bank on Applicant’s
ability to accomplish any task presented to him.  (AE B)
The  former  superintendent  of  the  maintenance  operations  flight  described
Applicant’s professionalism, military bearing and duty performance to be of the highest
level. He supported the squadron booster club by donating his time to help raise funds
for the  squadron’s holiday  party  and  other activities,  and  was  an avid  supporter  of  the
local community, helping to build homes for Habitat for Humanity. (AE B)
Current coworkers, including the president of the local union, have described him
in stressful and complicated situations requiring high levels of patience, intelligence, and
understanding,  and  Applicant  met  every  challenge,  deadline,  and  goal  presented  and
tackled every problem with grace and ease. Many of Applicant’s solutions were insightful
and  practical,  and  he  showed  a  remarkable  capacity  for  breaking  large  issues  into
manageable  segments.  Applicant  is  also  a  cooperative  and  attentive  team  player.  His
actions consistently inspired and motivated other employees in the office. Applicant was
instrumental in assisting members who are out of work, as well as assisting those affected
by a hurricane. He has always been honest and forthcoming. (AE B)
One  character  witness  met  Applicant  in  2002  when  the  witness  was  newly
stationed at the same base. Applicant opened his home to the new arrival and invited him
to the house for the 4th of July celebrations. He noted that Applicant was always receiving
awards because he was a top airman.  Applicant was always willing to give his shirt off
his back for people. He never saw Applicant become angry or enraged. As time went on,
the  witness  and  Applicant  and  his  wife  did  many  things  together,  and  Applicant’s
relationship with his wife seemed normal. Things changed when Applicant’s wife started
dating another individual who was residing in their home. It was the witness’s impression
that Applicant’s wife would “cry wolf” and be vengeful. At one point, while the witness was
residing in Applicant’s house, Applicant’s wife  lied when she  said that the witness had
cornered her in the kitchen – something that never happened – so he immediately moved
out of the house. Applicant’s wife’s boyfriend kept threatening Applicant for years, saying
that  he  was  going  to  “kick  his  butt.”  As  Applicant’s  marital  situation  became  more
antagonistic, it was the witness’s impression that the unit leadership was supportive of
Applicant, but the Command was simply trying to cover themselves by following protocol.
The  witness  has  never  seen  Applicant  display  any  suicidal  or  homicidal  ideation.  He
believes Applicant is trustworthy and has integrity. (Tr. at 22-20)
One character witness has known Applicant since they were in the same military
unit. After Applicant relocated, they met one day at a local store, and Applicant told him
about  an  employment  opening,  and  they  have  been  with  the  same  employer  since
November 2010.  Before  joining  the  same organization,  the  witness  served  as  a police
officer. The witness was aware of Applicant’s marital situation, hearing about it from other
people, and seeing Applicant’s reactions. There were threats, legal action, unnecessary
legal action, and going after money by the ex-wife and her now husband. He has never
seen Applicant lose his temper or act irrationally. Applicant has come to his aid and helped
move the witness’s mother. About 12 or 13 years ago, the Command issued a be-on-the
lookout (BOLO) flyer on Applicant. Applicant’s reputation as a coworker is spectacular.

",True
"Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact: Applicant is 35 years old. In 2013, he earned several certifications and
two associate’s degrees in computer information technology and security. He has never
married,  and  he  is  a  father  of  a  10-year-old  daughter.  He  received  full  custody  of  his
daughter  when  she  was  entering  first  grade,  which  occurred  shortly  after  her  mother
passed away. Applicant was on Social Security disability from about 2002 to 2010. His
parents applied for his disability in 2002 when Applicant was hospitalized a second time
for mental health issues. He was hired by a DOD contractor in March 2015. Applicant is
a field services technician, and he makes approximately $46,000 annually. He does not
currently  possess  a  DOD  security  clearance,  but his  employer is sponsoring  him for a
security  clearance  in  order  for  him  to  perform  specific  employment  duties.  (Tr.  15-17,
30, 33-35, 38-39; GE 1)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege that Applicant was hospitalized in 1999, and again in
2002, due to suicide ideation and manic behavior. Applicant denied these allegations. In
his  response  to  the  SOR.  He  admitted  that  he  was  hospitalized,  but  stated  that  this
information  should  not  be  used  against  him  in  consideration  of  his  security  clearance
eligibility. He was forced into the hospital against his will by his parents who, although
meaning  well,  were  severely  misguided  in  their  actions.  This  caused  him  to  suffer
extreme emotional distress. (Tr. 35)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  in  2006,  Applicant  was  treated  for  Bipolar  Disorder,
General Anxiety  Disorder, and  Severe  Psychotic  tendencies.  In  2008, he  discontinued
mental  health  treatment  and  stopped  taking  his  prescribed  medications.  Applicant
denied  this  allegation  in  his  response  to  the  SOR.  He  stated  the  diagnosis  was  a
continuation  of  the  original  misguided  diagnosis  made  in  1997,  which  was  based  on
exaggerated  input  by  his  parents  to  medical  personnel.  He  claimed  the  prescribed
medications  administered  to  him  caused  most  of  the  issues  addressed  during  his
background investigation. (Tr. 25, 35)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that in 2010, Applicant was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder,
General Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia, Alcohol Dependence, Cannabis Dependence,
and Polysubstance Dependence. Applicant’s prognosis was poor after he discontinued
treatment. Applicant denied this allegation in his response to the SOR. He stated that he
was  in  extreme  emotional distress following  the  death  of his father, and his fiancée  of
five years left him and took his daughter with her. He claimed the diagnosing agency did
not perform a new evaluation, but only continued his original diagnosis from 1997. The
medical facility and staff also had financial reasons to keep him in treatment. Applicant
did not recall his use of marijuana in 2010, and that is the reason he did not disclose it
on his 2015 SCA. (Tr. 26-28)
The  last  allegation  under  Guideline  I,  (SOR  ¶  1.e),  alleges  in  December  2017,
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  Bipolar  I  Disorder,  most  recent  episode  depressed,  in
partial remission,  Alcohol  Use  Disorder, Severe,  in  remission,  Cannabis Use  Disorder,
Mild, and Social Anxiety Disorder (with associated panic attacks). In the opinion of the
duly  qualified  mental  health  professional,  Applicant’s  present  mental  status  and
interpersonal  style  appeared  to  negatively  impact  his  judgment  and  trustworthiness.
Applicant  denied  this  allegation  in  his  response  to  the  SOR.  He  claimed  the  licensed
psychologist  hired  by  DOD  was  not  impartial  and  simply  reconfirmed  the  original
diagnosis based  on  a brief  interview.  Applicant  noted at  the  time  of  the  evaluation,  he
was  awaiting  back  surgery  and  was  under  the  influence  of  prescribed  medications.
Finally,  he  claimed  the  psychologist  was  offended  by  Applicant’s  distrust  of  all  mental
health professionals, and especially after Applicant discounted the value of  the field of
psychology since it is purely based on opinion. (Tr. 24, 30-33)
The  2017  psychological  evaluation  was  requested  by  the  DOD  CAF  after
Applicant’s background investigation revealed he was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder,
General Anxiety Disorder, and Severe Psychotic tendencies. In addition, there was also
evidence of cannabis and alcohol abuse. The DOD CAF requested Applicant participate
in a psychological exam. Applicant complied with the request and he was evaluated in
August  2017.  Applicant  told  the  licensed  psychologist  that  he  was  in  treatment
beginning around the age of eight.  Since 2011, he stopped taking all of his prescribed
medications and has not received any  additional mental health treatment. He reported
that as a child, he did not get along with his parents, who were strict practitioners of the
Mormon faith. Due to his rebellion, his parents thought he had mental health issues, and
he  was  prescribed  numerous  medications.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  recently
experienced a panic attack in advance of the present evaluation. His panic attacks are
almost always related to a stressful event in his life. (Tr. 32; GE 2)
In  2002,  when  Applicant  was  19  years  old,  he  was  hospitalized  multiple  times
due  to  suicide  ideation  and  manic  behaviors.  He  reported  to  the  psychologist  that  the
primary reason for treatment in 2002 involved his use of alcohol. Applicant moved away
from  his  parents,  and  in  2006,  at  the  age  of  23,  he  voluntarily  sought  mental  health
treatment.  The  records  indicate  that  he  was  diagnosed  with  Bipolar  Disorder,  General
Anxiety  Disorder,  and  Severe  Psychotic  tendencies.  He  soon  stopped  all  medication
and  counseling,  and  sought  “alternative  treatments”  instead  of  taking  prescribed
medications.  Nevertheless,  Applicant  sought  mental  health  care  again  in  2010,  at  the
age  of  27.  He  was  contemplating  suicide  and  had  a  plan  to  potentially  use  a  knife  to
commit suicide. The 2010 treatment records showed that he was diagnosed with Bipolar
Disorder,  Psychotic  Disorder  NOS,  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder,  Social  Phobia,
Alcohol Dependence, Cannabis Dependence, and Polysubstance Dependence. He was
prescribed  Lexapro,  Depakote,  Klonopin,  and  Zyprexa.  Additionally,  a  history  of
paranoia,  visual  hallucinations,  and  delusional  and  disorganized  thinking  was  noted  in
his treatment records. (GE 2)
The  psychologist  noted  that  Applicant  was  evasive  in  reporting  his  past  use  of
alcohol and marijuana during the interview. Applicant admitted that alcohol was more of
a problem for him, and said, “I drank a half gallon of Vodka a day from the time I was 17
until  I  was  27.”  The  psychologist  noted  that  Applicant  exhibited  a  more  stable  lifestyle
since  2011.  Nonetheless,  the  present  evaluation  revealed  that  Applicant,  by  his  own
admission, continued to suffer from psychiatric symptoms which interfered with his life.
It was also likely that Applicant continued to use alcohol and/or cannabis based on his
previous  history,  and  his  reluctance  to  frankly  discuss  the  topic  during  his  interview.
Based on the review of past treatment records, clinical interview and observations, and
personality  assessment,  the  psychologist  determined  Applicant  appears  to  meet  the
criteria for the following past and current DSM-5 disorders:
Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode depressed, in partial remission;
Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, in remission;
Cannabis Use Disorder, Mild
Social Anxiety Disorder (with associated panic attacks).
“CONCLUSION: Applicant’s present mental status and interpersonal style appear
to  negatively  impact  his  judgment  and  trustworthiness.  Furthermore,  if  his  historical
mental  health  symptoms  were  to  reemerge,  his  stability  and  reliability  would  almost
certainly be negatively impacted as well.” (Tr. 29; GE 2)
The  SOR  also  alleges  adverse  financial  information.  Applicant  attributed  his
financial  problems  due  to  the  absence  of  financial  aid  during  his  last  semester  of
college.  In  addition,  he  is  a  single  parent,  and  he  injured  his  back  in  2016.  His  injury
caused  him  to  suffer  financially  due  to  medical  expenses  and  ultimately,  expenses
related to his back surgery in 2017. (Tr. 22)
SOR  ¶¶  2.a-d  allege  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  Department  of  Education
for four defaulted student loans totaling $23,246. Applicant denied all SOR allegations in
his  response  to  the  SOR  since  he  does  not  believe  the  DOD  should  hold  any  unpaid
debt  against  him  in  the  evaluation  of  his  security  clearance  eligibility.  At  the  hearing,
Applicant  admitted  he  currently  owed  approximately  $34,000  for  his  defaulted  student
loans,  even  after  his  2018  tax  refund  of  $3,800  was  involuntarily  intercepted  by  the
Internal  Revenue  Service  toward  payment  of  this  debt.  He  was  supposed  to  start
repaying  his  loans  in  2015.  He  made  a  few  payments,  but  admitted  that  he  had  not
recently made any payments on his loans. Instead, Applicant has been saving money in
the  event  he  does  not  receive  his  security  clearance  and  he  is  terminated  by  his
employer. The student loan debt is not currently being paid and is unresolved. (Tr. 17-
19, 38; GE 3)
SOR  ¶  2.e  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  an  apartment  complex  in  the
amount of $1,895. Applicant stated that this debt originated from him breaking his lease
on an apartment while he was enrolled in college. Applicant has not resolved this debt.
(Tr. 19-20; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 2.f alleges that Applicant is indebted to a collection agency in the amount
of $493. Applicant denied this account and explained that due to the Equifax breach of
personal  information,  the  financial  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR  could  be  the  result  of
the security breach. He did not do any research concerning this account to determine if
he was responsible for the debt. This account has not been resolved. (Tr. 20; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 2.g alleges that Applicant is indebted for an unpaid utility account in the
amount of $275. This debt  surfaced about the same time Applicant broke his lease on
the  apartment,  noted  above.  He  acknowledged  this  debt  and  stated  that  he  had  not
taken any steps to pay this account. This debt remains unsatisfied and unresolved. (Tr.
20-21; GE 3)
SOR  ¶¶  2.h  and  2.i  allege  that  Applicant  is  indebted  for  two  unpaid  medical
accounts in the approximate amount of $390. Applicant denied these accounts since he
provided the medical provider with his correct insurance information. He has not taken
any  other  action  with  the  creditor  to  obtain  a  final  resolution  of  these  unpaid  medical
accounts,  nor  did  he  provide  any  mitigating  financial  documentation  with  his  SOR
response, during the hearing, or when the record was held open for one month after his
hearing. These medical debts are unresolved. (Tr. 21, 37; GE 3)
Applicant provided four character reference letters during the hearing. (AE A-D) It
appears that  all four individuals have  worked  with  him,  and all  characterized  Applicant
as a trusted, dedicated employee. Only one of these individuals commented that he was
aware  of  Applicant’s  adverse  financial  issues  in  relation  to  his  security  clearance
eligibility.  (AE  B)  None  of  the  individuals,  however,  seemed  to  be  aware  of  the
psychological  conditions  security  concerns  alleged  in  the  SOR.  All  four  character
references recommended Applicant be granted a security clearance.

"Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  She  has  an
associate’s  degree  and  additional  college  credits.  She  is  married,  but  separated,  with
three children.
Applicant  has  had  minor  employment,  financial,  interpersonal,  and  legal  issues,
none  of  which  were  significant  enough  to  be  a  security  concern.  She  went  to  a  new
doctor in December 2014, but she did not like how she was treated, and she left shortly
after she arrived for her first visit. She filed a complaint against the doctor. The doctor
was  apparently  interviewed  for  Applicant’s  background  investigation  and  provided
derogatory information, which spurred the DOD to request a psychological evaluation.
Applicant was evaluated at the DOD’s request by a licensed clinical psychologist
on January 24, 2018. The report of the evaluation was completed on February 2, 2018.
The  psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with  “Histrionic,  borderline,  and  narcissistic
personality traits (Cluster B).” The psychologist wrote that Applicant “does not endorse
or  display  obvious  symptoms  of  mood  disorder  at  this  time  .  .  .  .  She  does  display
obvious signs of a characterological disorder . . . .” The psychologist also wrote:
traits  are
Among the problematic issues that can arise in individuals with Cluster B
personality
irresponsibility  and  selfish
behaviors,  unprovoked  aggressive  outbursts  that  can  be  verbal  and/or
physical in nature, and many other inappropriate behavior (e.g., behaving
in provocative or attention seeking ways).

The  psychologist  questioned  Applicant’s  judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness,  and
opined  that  “[g]iven  the  longstanding  legal,  occupational,  and  family  difficulties  in  this
case, and her lack of insight or interest in treatment, the prognosis for this applicant is
poor.”
Applicant presented a letter from her treating physician whose medical opinion is
that  Applicant  “is  mentally  well.”  She  also  presented  an  evaluation  from  a  licensed
clinical  social  worker  (LCSW)  who  found  no  diagnosis  and  that  Applicant  “does  not
present  with  the  ‘Cluster  B’  Personality  Disorders,  nor  does  she  present  with  any
emotional,  mental  and  personality  condition  that  impair[s]  her  judgment,  reliability,  or
trustworthiness.”  Applicant  also  presented  substantial  character  evidence  attesting  to
her  excellent  job  performance,  emotional  stability,  honesty,  dedication,  loyalty,  work
ethic, and integrity.

"Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a. He denied the allegations in SOR
¶¶  1.b  through  1.d  and  2.a.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He has a bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees.
He has never married and has no children. He has worked for a federal contractor since
2005.2
In  about  June  2014,  Applicant  attempted  suicide.  After  receiving  treatment  for
physical  injuries,  he  was  voluntarily  admitted  to  an  inpatient  mental-health  facility  for
evaluation  and  treatment.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  working  long  hours,  going  to
work in the morning in the dark and coming home in the evening in the dark. His home
needed  repairs  and  he  was  trying  to  keep  his  homeowners’  association  happy.  He
testified that he had a multitude of stressors that were increasing. He said he turned into
a robot. He was alone, sad, and lost sight of what was important. He was dealing with
these emotional issues without professional help. He was performance-oriented, and that
attitude overrode what he should have been doing, which was to take care of himself. He
lost touch with his personal needs. He was gaunt at the time and not eating healthy foods.
When be felt overwhelmed by stress, he cut his wrists. He admitted himself to the hospital
where he was treated, and then voluntarily admitted himself to inpatient treatment for two
weeks.3
Applicant testified that he was treated by a psychiatrist after he was released from
treatment in 2014. He saw the psychiatrist monthly and was prescribed medication. His
treatment with this psychiatrist ceased in March 2015. In early 2016 Applicant was treated
by a nurse practitioner, who was part of the psychiatrist’s practice, through the middle of
2016.4
While  in  treatment,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  a  major  depressive  disorder-
single episode. He was prescribed antidepressant drugs, but had a negative reaction to
the first medication. It was then changed to one he could tolerate. He remained on the
medication until August 2016 when he was told by the nurse practitioner that he could

reduce the medication based on his own determination of his needs. He no longer takes
this medication.5
In February 2018, Applicant participated in a government-requested psychological
evaluation conducted by a duly qualified mental health professional, a neuropsychologist.
A series of psychological tests were conducted. He was diagnosed with major depressive
disorder, recurrent severe, with psychotic symptoms.6
Applicant’s  prognosis  by  the  neuropsychologist  is  guarded  due  to  untreated
symptoms  of  mood  disturbance  and  psychosis,  and  limited  awareness  of  his  mental
status.  She  noted  that  Applicant’s  reliability,  judgment,  and  trustworthiness  could  be
affected by his psychiatric symptoms.7 Applicant disagreed with the diagnosis.8
Applicant returned to the psychiatrist who previously treated him in 2014 to 2015.
He  wanted  the  psychiatrist  to  evaluate  the  government’s  mental  health  professional’s
opinion. Applicant provided a two-page medical record from the psychiatrist. The report
provided the following information. The last time Applicant was seen by the psychiatrist
was in March 2015. He said Applicant did well until July 2016, when he returned to the
practice  and  was  seen  by  a  nurse  practitioner.  He  was  restarted  on  medication  for
depression. He took the medication until February 2017. Applicant told the psychiatrist
that  he  was  feeling  better  at  that  time  and  stopped  psychiatric  treatment.  Since  then
Applicant did not have additional contact with the psychiatrist. The report stated that on
October  21,  2018, Applicant  came  to see him  because  he  had  received  an  evaluation
from a neuropsychologist and was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, recurrent,
severe with psychotic features. He told the psychiatrist that he was worried about his job.
He told the psychiatrist that he had done well at his job and denied issues with depression,
severe anxiety, paranoia, sleep disturbance or other symptoms. He further disclosed he
had a girlfriend of four years, and he was close with his parents. He denied any current
stressors.9
The  medical  report  further  stated  that  the  psychiatrist  reviewed  the  government
neuropsychologist’s opinion. He stated that he did not doubt the report about Applicant’s
past history content, but he may have a different conclusion. He further stated that judging
by  current  symptoms,  the  psychiatrist  would  opine  that  Applicant  suffers  from  anxiety
disorder not otherwise specified. Applicant may also have obsessive compulsive traits.
The psychiatrist stated he did not see any current evidence of a major depressive disorder
or psychotic symptomatology. He further stated: “I want to clarify that this does not mean

that  it  was  not  true  before.”10  Applicant  testified  that  when  he  returned  to  see  the
psychiatrist in October 2018, the psychiatrist did not perform nor did he participate in any
new or updated tests.11
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2015.
Section 21-Psycholgical and Emotional Health, asked in the last seven years have you
consulted  with  a  health  care  professional  regarding  an  emotional  or  mental  health
condition or were you hospitalized for such a condition. The question stated: “Answer ‘No’
if any of the counseling was for any of the following reasons and was not court ordered:
strictly marital, family or grief not related to violence by you.” Applicant answered “no” to
the question and failed to disclose his 2014 hospitalization; his mental-health treatment
after  his  suicide  attempt;  his  subsequent  mental-health  treatment  where  he  was
diagnosed  with  a  major  depressive  disorder,  initial  episode  with  psychotic  features;
prescribed anti-depressant medication; and received subsequent treatment at a different
mental health and counseling facility through at least March 2015.
Applicant was asked by Department Counsel if the word “hospitalize” triggered a
thought that maybe he should disclose his hospitalization. He testified:
I did not know who to ask and so I thought I was answering appropriately at
the time, given the answer no if I –not everyone knows what happened to
me and that was my personal privacy right I felt. I did the best I could to
answer the question honestly and truthfully and I signed the medical release
forms, you know, at the end willingly.12
Applicant was asked by Department Counsel if he reported his hospitalization after
the  June  2014  incident.  Applicant  testified:  “They  knew  I  was  hospitalized.  They  don’t
know why I was hospitalized. But HR was contacted and then security, so.” When further
questioned  about  whether  anyone
for  Applicant’s
hospitalization,  he  testified:  “They  respected  personal  privacy,  you  know.  They  knew  I
was  out  and  I  was,  you  know,  receiving  treatment  at  a  facility.”13  He  confirmed  his
employer knew he was at a mental-health facility. He was on short-term disability while
he was an outpatient until November 2014 and then he worked part time in December.
He resumed ful- time employment in January 2015.14
inquired  as
the  reason
to
Applicant’s explanation for his failure to disclose the above requested information
was because he misinterpreted the question. He said he interpreted “grief” to mean he
did not have to disclose the information because the reason he attempted suicide was

because  he  was  grieving.  He  also  said  he  was  dealing  with  a  multitude  of  stressors.
During his background interview with a government investigator in December 2016, he
explained he considered his treatment as being grief-related following a breakup with his
girlfriend. He also explained he was feeling depressed and overwhelmed because he was
working long hours and his father was having health issues. He said the combination of
these stressors resulted in his suicide attempt.15
The SCA specifically asked about hospitalization, highlighting the need to disclose
this type of information. It is not believable that 15 months after Applicant was voluntarily
hospitalized for two weeks after a suicide attempt that he did not think he had to disclose
it. When Applicant completed the SCA in September 2015, he had previously stopped
seeing his psychiatrist in March 2015, and he was still on medication for depression. He
spent  months  as  an  outpatient  and  was  on  short-term  disability  due  to  mental-health
issues. Although he told the investigator that there were many stressors that caused him
to attempt suicide and one of them was grief, he described many others. I did not find
Applicant’s  explanation  credible.  Applicant  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  his  mental-
health conditions on his SCA as required.
Applicant provided character letters from a friend and his girlfriend that describe
him  as  professional,  intelligent,  funny,  steadfast,  optimistic,  encouraging,  proud,  and
loyal. He testified that his girlfriend is part of his support system. He provided performance
evaluations from 2015 and 2016. His overall scores were 3.4 and 3.8 out of 5.0. He also
provided  a  2017  performance  form  indicating  with  comments  from  supervisors  and
leaders noting he had done an outstanding job.16

"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old and has an associate’s degree in paralegal studies earned
in May 1994. (GEs 1, 3; Tr. 65.) She obtained licenses as a certified nurse assistant in
1995, and as a licensed nurse assistant in 2013. She then attended a technical institute
part time at night from September 2013 to December 2013. She has been employed by a
defense contractor since late March 2015 and seeks a security clearance for her duties.
(GEs 1, 4; AE C.)
Applicant and her first husband married in November 1988, had a daughter in 1989,
and then divorced in January 1993. They  remarried in August 1996 and had two more
daughters before divorcing in May 2003. (GEs 1, 3.) As of February 2019, Applicant’s ex-
husband  was  serving  a  50-year  prison  sentence  for  sexually  assaulting  their  oldest
daughter. (GE 3; Tr. 58.) Applicant married her second husband in June 2004, and they
divorced in October 2009. In February 2015, Applicant began a cohabitant relationship.
(GE 1.) She was no longer in that relationship as of February 2019. (Tr. 66.) None of her
three daughters currently live with her. (Tr. 67.)
Applicant  was  sexually  abused  by  her  stepfather  as  a  child.  She  has  received
mental-health services from her current provider (clinic X) on and off since age 13, when
she overdosed on Tylenol and sleeping pills. She was psychiatrically hospitalized and then
placed in foster care. After several hospitalizations for suicidal ideations, she married her
first husband. He was abusive, and she was hospitalized at age 18 and then again at age
20 in 1991 following an overdose.  In August 2002, a psychiatrist at clinic X prescribed
Topamax  for  Applicant,  and  he  diagnosed  her  with  bipolar  disorder,  PTSD,  and  “a
substantial” Axis II borderline personality disorder. (GE 3.)
Around  the  time  of  her  second  divorce  from  her  first  husband,  Applicant  was
hospitalized  for  psychiatric  reasons.  In  early  September  2003,  Applicant  intentionally
overdosed on her daughter’s Vicodin prescription. In April 2004, she returned to treatment
at clinic X because of the stress of her ex-husband’s upcoming trial on charges of sexual
assault and its impact on their oldest daughter. Applicant reported symptoms of depression
and anxiety. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and she began cognitive behavioral
and interpersonal therapy sessions. (GE 3.)
In May 2005, Applicant was hospitalized for six days for depression and suicidal
ideation. At discharge, she was placed on Topamax and amitriptyline and referred to clinic
X. On May 16, 2005, Applicant was admitted to clinic X’s crisis stabilization program. She
reported  rapid  cycling  between  depression  or isolation  and manic episodes as well as
auditory  hallucinations.  At  a  session  on  June  22,  2005,  Applicant  reported  auditory
hallucinations and racing thoughts, which she attributed to the stress of her ex-husband’s
lengthy prison sentence for molesting their daughter. She was diagnosed on Axis I with
bipolar disorder and PTSD, and on Axis II with borderline personality disorder, and advised
to continue with individual therapy. (GE 3.)
In June 2005, Applicant was on suspension for missed time when she left her job of
five years. She then held temporary assignments until April 2006 when she landed an
administrative position with a realty company. In September 2006 she went on extended
disability  after  she  hurt  her  wrist.  (GEs  1-2.)  It  is  unclear  what  treatment,  if  any,  she
received for her mental health from June 2005 to March 2007.
As of late March 2007, Applicant was living with her two younger daughters and
separated from her second husband. Her eldest daughter was living with her parents in
another state. Applicant sought support at clinic X, reporting worsening symptoms and
increased stress over the previous few months. She described manic behavior, impulsive
and risky behavior, rapid speech, and mood swings consistent with bipolar I disorder, and a
significant pattern of relationship difficulties, frequent and chronic suicidal ideation and
intent, and lack of personal identity consistent with borderline personality disorder. She
also  reported  panic  attacks  in  public  places.  She  indicated  that  her  symptoms  were
impacting  her  personal  relationships  and  her  ability  to  work,  and  she  expressed  a
readiness  to  engage  in  treatment.  Applicant  was  diagnosed  on  Axis  I  with  bipolar  I
disorder, most recent episode depression, severe; eating disorder; and panic disorder with
agoraphobia.  On  Axis  II,  she  was  diagnosed  with  borderline  personality  disorder.
Treatment recommendations included psychiatric evaluation, medication monitoring, and
individual and group therapy. (GE 3.)
On April 20, 2007, Applicant began  seeing her current psychiatrist at clinic X. A
friend was managing her Topamax and amitriptyline medications for her so that she did not
overdose. Applicant indicated that she had significant depression, but she was reluctant to
try mood stabilizers because of their side effects. Her psychiatrist assessed her judgment
and insight as adequate, although her affect was restricted. He diagnosed her on Axis I
with bipolar disorder, not otherwise specified, and PTSD, delayed onset, chronic type, and
on Axis II with borderline personality disorder. She agreed to a trial of Lamictal medication
for her bipolar disorder, and was advised to return to the clinic in four to five weeks. (GE 3.)
From  August  2007  until  July  2008,  Applicant  lived  in  another  state.  She  was
hospitalized  for  two  weeks  in  May  2008  following  an  intentional  overdose  on  Elavil.
Applicant moved back to her current locale in July 2008, and on September 5, 2008, she
returned  to  clinic  X  for  treatment  of  diagnosed  bipolar disorder, PTSD,  and  borderline
personality disorder. She reported current symptoms of depression and anxiety with panic
attacks, sometimes with no identifiable precipitant. She denied any current suicidal ideation
or intention, although she acknowledged thinking about self-harmful behavior in response
to stressors and to changes in her environment. Applicant indicated that she was feeling
very stressed due to the pressure to find a job after being unemployed for 2.5 years. She
acknowledged that alcohol and other drugs (marijuana) were having severe effects on her
life.  Therapeutic  behavioral  services  and  weekly  individual  psychotherapy  were
recommended to improve her overall functioning. During a session with her psychiatrist in
October  2008,  Applicant  reported  her  mood  as  stable,  and  she  denied  a  history  of
substance use requiring treatment. (GE 3.)
Applicant continued in treatment with clinic X.  Over the next year, she exhibited
tangential speech and needed redirection in therapy. As of September 2009, she reported
increased symptoms of mania and difficulty managing activities of daily living. She was
given  diagnoses  on  Axis  I  of  bipolar  disorder,  currently  hypomanic,  and  on  Axis  II
borderline personality disorder. Applicant was well-engaged with her service providers and
showed good insight into her current symptoms of hypomania. (GE 3.)
In June 2010, Applicant was hospitalized for suicidal ideation with plan and intent.
She self-reported her fear that she might harm her daughters, and as a consequence, the
Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) placed her daughters in foster care.
That  summer,  Applicant  began  attending  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  for  a  social
environment free of alcohol. In August 2010, social workers at clinic X noted that Applicant
continued to attend her therapy appointments, but she had difficulty following through with
treatment  recommendations.  During  a  medication-management  session  with  her
psychiatrist  on  November  4,  2010,  Applicant  reported  sobriety  of  2.5  months  with  AA
attendance. She acknowledged that she had been withholding information from him about
her substance use over the years. She stated that she relapsed after nine years of sobriety
into drinking from two to six drinks per day until 2.5 months ago. She reported increased
anxiety related to a plan for her children to be placed back with her in December 2010.
Applicant  agreed  to  a  short-term  use  of  Vistaril  in  lieu  of  Lamictal.  She  was  given
diagnoses  on  Axis  I  of  bipolar  disorder  type  II,  PTSD,  and  alcohol  abuse  in  early  full
remission, and on Axis II of borderline personality disorder. (GE 3.)
Applicant resumed working in April 2011, although her schedule as a factory worker
made it difficult for her to attend her therapy appointments. By May 2011, Applicant was
using Ativan prescribed by her primary care physician as a sleep aid. During a session with
her psychiatrist in early May 2011, she reluctantly agreed that she was hypomanic, but she
declined  to  take  prescribed  risperidone.  Her  insight  and  judgment  were  assessed  as
adequate. She was advised that should her manic symptoms worsen, she should consider
the use of mood-stabilizing medications. (GE 3.)
As of August 2011, Applicant was experiencing emotional dysregulation and anger,
including  at  DCYF,  although  one  of  her  children  had  returned  home  from  foster  care.
Through AA’s support, Applicant was able to stay sober for the past year. She reported
suicidal ideation in the past year, but not in recent months. (GE 3.)
In April 2012, Applicant hit her head in an automobile accident, which exacerbated
her mental health issues. Her psychiatrist diagnosed her with post-concussion syndrome.
By August 2012, her two teenage daughters were living with her, which was a source of
stress. Applicant reported an increase in anxiety, moods “all over the place,” and a difficulty
focusing. She experienced panic attacks and had auditory hallucinations, but she had been
sober for over two years and had no suicidal or homicidal ideations. Borderline personality
disorder remained her primary diagnosis with a secondary diagnosis of bipolar I disorder,
moderate. (GE 3.)
In July 2012, Applicant left her factory job by mutual agreement following notice of
unsatisfactory performance. She had been having trouble performing her duties after her
car accident. (GE 4.)  Between August 2012 and August 2013, Applicant had a number of
changes and losses in her life, including loss of her driver’s license, ending her relationship
with her then fiancé, and the death of a friend from AA. Applicant attended therapy and
medication-management  appointments  at  clinic  X,  but  she  was  not  consistent  in  her
attendance with therapy after her therapist retired. Over the year, Applicant presented for
treatment with increased mood dysregulation, lability, anxiety, decreased energy, sleep
disturbances due to panic symptoms and intrusive thoughts. She reported one incident of
suicidal ideation with plan and intent, but she did not require psychiatric hospitalization.
Applicant maintained sobriety throughout the year with ongoing, regular participation in AA
with a sponsor. (GE 3.)
Applicant was rehired by her former employer in October 2013. In February 2015,
she was involuntarily terminated after she did not report for two shifts when she was ill.
After she proved that she had reported her absence, she was offered her old job, but she
chose instead to work for her current employer. (GEs 1, 4.)
On  March  12,  2015,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an inquiry concerning
any  counseling  for  an  emotional  or  mental  health  condition  in  the  last  seven  years,
Applicant indicated that she has had treatment from 1991 to present at clinic X. (GE 1.)
Applicant began working for her current employer on March 30, 2015. (AE C.)
A clinic X staff-activity log covering June 16, 2015, through September 25, 2018,
shows that Applicant had 45-minute individual therapy sessions at the clinic approximately
every  two  weeks  from  June  2015  to  April  2016  and  from  August  2016  through  mid-
February 2017. She attended one therapy session in the spring of 2017. From June 2017
through  November  2017,  she  attended  therapy  once  every  three  months.  There  is no
evidence of any therapy sessions in December 2017 and January 2018. She was absent
from a service scheduled for January 24, 2018. (AE B.)
At  the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed  clinical
psychologist on February 12, 2018. The assessment included a clinical interview; review of
documentation showing a history of long-term mental health treatment for bipolar disorder
and borderline personality disorder since 1991; and testing consisting of the Substance
Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI-3), and the Million Clinical Multiaxial Inventory
(MCMI-III).3  The  psychologist  noted  Applicant’s  ongoing  medication  management  with
Topamax under the care of her psychiatrist at clinic X and her individual therapy with a
social worker at clinic X, but also that Applicant had discontinued her use of Ativan and had

presence of psychopathology. (GE 2.)
stated that she no longer needs psychotherapy. Applicant indicated that she only sees her
therapist  “sometimes  for  support.”  Applicant  denied  any  current  suicidal  or  homicidal
ideation. In the opinion of the psychologist, Applicant “dramatically minimized her history of
such [ideation].” Applicant reported that she was attending five to ten AA meetings a week,
and she insisted that it was AA that was keeping her stable. The psychologist diagnosed
Applicant on Axis I with alcohol dependence, full remission, most recent relapse in October
2015,  and  bipolar  disorder,  by  history.  No  present  symptoms  of  bipolar  disorder  were
evidenced  in  the  assessment.  She  gave  Applicant  a  diagnosis  on  Axis  II  of  cluster  B
personality disorder, histrionic and/or borderline personality disorder.4 The psychologist
summarized her assessment, as follows:
Clinical  psychopathology  is  present  in  [Applicant’s]  presentation,  her
dramatic minimization and unwillingness to be forthcoming and realistic with
regard to both her history of symptoms and her vulnerability to experiencing
negative emotions certainly is evidence that her judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness is impaired with regard to the protection of national security.
.  .  .  Ongoing prognosis for [Applicant] is Poor. Her status is very likely to be
negatively impacted by the presence of stressful life events and any alcohol
use.  She  is  likely  to  struggle  with  emotional  lability,  with  bouts  of  angry
outbursts and periods of isolation. She insisted that her relationship with AA
is what keeps her stable and reported that she does not feel she is in need of
individual psychotherapy “anymore.” Her minimization of need for ongoing
treatment and her reliance on AA as her sole source of stability renders her
highly vulnerable to episodes of emotional dysregulation. These personality
characteristics undermine [Applicant’s] ability to maintain with certainty the
judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  necessary  to  protect  national
security.
The psychologist subsequently concluded that Applicant is “likely unable to consistently
and reliably remain stable and well over the long term.” (GE 2.)
Applicant attended therapy once in February 2018, and approximately every two
weeks from April through mid-July 2018. There is no indication of any therapy sessions in
August 2018. She had a 45-minute session on September 10, 2018, and had reportedly
“confirmed”  for  September  25,  2018.  (AE  B.)  No  information  was  provided  about  her
clinical presentation or progress in staff logs. She testified that she now sees her therapist
4 Under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), borderline personality disorder is
defined  by  a  pattern  of  instability  in  interpersonal  relationships,  self-image,  and  affects,  and  marked
impulsivity.  Histrionic  personality  disorder  is  a  pattern  of  excessive  emotionality  and  attention  seeking.
Personality disorders are grouped into three clusters based on similarities. Cluster B includes the antisocial,
borderline,  histrionic,  and  narcissistic  personality  disorders.  Persons  with  these  disorders  often  appear
dramatic, emotional, or erratic. Personality disorders are diagnosed when there is an enduring pattern present
in a variety of contexts that appeared before early adulthood, and they are typical of an individual’s long-term
functioning. Impulsive behavior in at least two areas and recurrent suicidal behavior are characteristics of
borderline  personality  disorder.  There  is  considerable  variability  in  the  course  of  borderline  personality
disorder. The risk of suicide gradually wanes with advancing age, although the tendency towards intense
emotions, impulsivity, and intensity in relationships is often lifelong.
every three months and that her most recent session was in December 2018. (Tr. 56.) She
provided no documentation to corroborate that she had therapy.
Applicant testified that she goes to a psychologist, a psychiatrist, and a therapist,
and has them available to monitor her,5 but she then stated, “I just take care of myself
really well these days.” (Tr. 48.) Applicant indicated that she is able to manage her mental
health by taking her medication, eating right, and not drinking alcohol or using illegal drugs.
She explained that it took her some time to change her negative thought process, and that
AA is a daily reminder for her to work on her “thinking problem” on a daily basis. (Tr.  51-
53.) Applicant denied any panic attacks in the last year, although she admitted that “there
probably was an instance within the last year” when she felt really overwhelmed. She did
not tell her therapist about it. She would not tell her therapist “unless it gets bad.” She
copes with panic attacks by “just breathing, just meditating and relaxing.” (Tr. 62-64.)
Documents submitted after her hearing included a progress note of a 15-minute
medication-management  session  with  her psychiatrist  at  clinic X  in  mid-January 2019.
Applicant reported doing well on her Topamax medication. She had some stressors over
the  recent  holidays  and  some  work  stressors,  but  she  reported  that  she  was  able  to
manage them. She exhibited no psychotic or suicidal symptoms, no lability or constriction
of  mood,  and  adequate  insight  and  judgment.  Her  psychiatrist  assessed  her  with
unspecified  bipolar  disorder,  in  remission;  alcohol  use  disorder,  in  remission;  and
unspecified personality disorder with cluster B features by history. She was continued on
Topamax medication and advised to return to the clinic in three months. (AE A.) Applicant
testified that she takes her medication regularly. (Tr. 69.)
Applicant  did  not  provide  the  February  2018  report  of  the  psychologist  to  her
psychiatrist for his review, even though she had a copy. She apparently mentioned the
assessment to her psychiatrist because she was “very upset about it.” She  claims that
some information in the psychologist’s report to the DOD was inaccurate, although she did
not elaborate about any errors. (Tr. 72-74.)
Applicant has not consumed any alcohol since 2015. She attends between seven
and ten AA meetings a week and learned in AA some coping skills that she “can use” in
every aspect of her life. (Tr. 48, 50-51.)
Applicant has had no disciplinary issues with her current employer. (AE C.) She has
enjoyed her work over the last four years and considers it an honor to work there. In late
2015, she transferred to a more stressful position, which she held for almost three years. It
helped her learn how to remain calm and cope with difficult situations. She has been in her
current assignment since November 2018. (Tr. 47-48, 71.)
5 Available records show that Applicant has had her present therapist since June 2017 (AE B), but she has
been under the care of her psychiatrist since April 2007. (GE 3.)

A co-worker, who serves as a union steward and was previously employed in the
same  department  as  Applicant,  has  always  known  Applicant  to  be  calm  at  work.  She
managed a situation that could have been very stressful for her. She had counted on a
union official to represent her at her hearing. He had the documentation she intended to
present at her hearing but then called that morning and indicated he would be unable to
accompany her.6  Traffic issues led Applicant and her witness to change their plans and
take public transportation, which was delayed. Applicant remained “in good spirits.” (Tr. 33-
40.) The witness is aware that Applicant was “a heavy drinker at one time.” Yet, he would
like to see her obtain a security clearance. He considers her to be “a great American.”
When  asked  whether  his  opinion  would  change  if  he  knew  that  of  her  mental  health
diagnoses, he responded that he had never seen any evidence of those issues. (Tr. 41-
43.)
Three co-workers provided character reference letters for Applicant. A co-worker
who has known Applicant for almost four years described her “a kind and caring soul who
is always thinking of others.” In their time together outside of work, Applicant has acted
very responsibly. Applicant takes her sobriety seriously and “attends meetings regularly as
required.”  At  work,  Applicant  has  been  very  focused  and  dependable.  The  co-worker
believes that it would be detrimental to their employer as well as to Applicant’s well-being if
she is not allowed to continue her work. (AE D1.) The other co-workers have known her for
less than two years. In their experience, Applicant is committed to her work, and she is
willing to help when needed. Applicant works overtime on a regular basis. They consider
her to be an asset. (AEs D2-D3.)
Applicant’s AA sponsor, who has been in the AA program for 30 years, has known
Applicant for three years. She attests that Applicant attends daily meetings and volunteers
in AA, going above and beyond what is asked of her. The sponsor has not known Applicant
to relapse in the past three years. In her opinion, Applicant “handles difficult situations with
grace and dignity.” She is well respected and trusted by her peers in AA, and she is always
seeking new ways to improve herself. (AE D4.)
Two friends who have known Applicant through a women’s group provided positive
reference  letters.  They  have  witnessed  Applicant  become  a  leader  in  planning  and
organizing group outings. A friend of eight years described Applicant’s temperament as
“always balanced even with chaos around her.” (AE D5.) A friend of the past four years,
who has also been involved in the planning and organization of their group’s activities,
admires Applicant’s “quiet and self-confident demeanor.” Applicant has shown herself to be
a reliable and dependable friend. (AE D6.)
6 Applicant confirmed that this union official was supposed to act as her personal representative.  I advised her
that I would not continue with the hearing and that we would reconvene at some future date. Alternatively, she
could continue to represent herself and submit documentation after the hearing. Applicant chose the latter.

"Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2014.  He  previously  worked  for  the  same  employer  from
2008 to 2009 and 2010 to 2012. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has
held  since  about  2008.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree,  which  was  awarded  in  2009.  He
married  and  divorced  in  2010.  He  married  again  in  2014.  He  has  two  children.
(Transcript (Tr.) at 17-19, 38-41; GE 1; AE D)
Applicant  regularly  used  marijuana  from  about  2010  through  November  2013
while holding a security clearance. His brother was a marijuana user and lived with him
during  that  period.  Applicant’s  father  moved  in  with  them  in  about  2012.  His  father
suffers  from  mental  illness,  dementia,  and  possibly  post-traumatic  stress  disorder
(PTSD)  from  his  service  in  Vietnam.  His  father  engaged  in  erratic  behavior,  including
exposing  himself.  Applicant  stated  that  he  and  his  brother  were  under  a  great  deal  of
stress  from  caring  for  his father,  which  significantly  contributed  to  their  marijuana  use.
(Tr. at 38-39, 46-50, 62-67, 75; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant provided an inconsistent history of his marijuana use. He reported his
marijuana use on his February 2015 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF
86). He wrote that he periodically used marijuana as a “stress reliever,” with the first use
in  1998  and  the  most  recent  use  in  “08/2012  (Estimated).”  In  response  to  DOHA
interrogatories,  he  wrote  that  he  used  marijuana  monthly  from  1998  to  2000;  no  use
from  2000  to  2010;  and  weekly  from  2010  to  2013.  Upon  his  hospitalization,  as
discussed  below,  he  reported  that  he  was  smoking  marijuana  on  a  daily  basis.  He
testified  that  he  started  using  marijuana  regularly  in  2013,  then  later  admitted  that  he
smoked  marijuana  with  his  brother  since  2010.  He  stated  that  he  used  it  on  a  weekly
basis,  and  then  admitted  using  it  almost  daily  in  2013.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any
illegal  drug  use  after  his  hospitalization  in  2013.  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to
abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr. at 50-
51, 62-63, 66, 75; Applicant’s response to SOR, enclosure (encl) 4; GE 1, 2)
Applicant stated that any discrepancies about his marijuana use were due to his
bad  memory.  He  asserted  that  his  memory  problems  could  be  from  head  trauma  he
suffered  when  he  was  younger  during  gymnastics  and  wrestling.  He  also  believes  it
could be associated with  stress and his attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
(Tr. at 63-64).
Applicant was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility on November 24, 2013.
He  was  accompanied  by  his  family.  His  family  told  the  staff  that  he  had  expressed
suicidal  ideation.  During  his  intake  interview,  it  was  reported  that  he  was  cooperative,
but  it  was  also  reported  that  he  was  “very  grossly  psychotic  and  delusional,
disorganized, loose, incoherent, [and] making bizarre statements.” He had been running
in  the  streets  and  entering  the  homes  of  strangers  without  permission.  The  admission
diagnosis  by  a  psychiatrist  was  bipolar  affective  disorder,  not  otherwise  specified,
currently  depressed  with  psychosis  and  in  acute  exacerbation;  and  marijuana  abuse,
intermittent. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant was placed on medication. His mood stabilized, and his thoughts were
more  composed.  He  was  motivated  to  seek  outpatient  counseling  and  to  take  his
medications. He was discharged home to resume outpatient care on December 2, 2013.
Upon his discharge “no suicidal thoughts [were] noted; [and] no psychosis [was] noted.”
The discharge diagnosis by the attending psychiatrist was bipolar affective disorder, not
otherwise  specified,  currently  manic  with  psychosis;  and  marijuana  abuse,  severe.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant  continued  to  be  seen  by  the  psychiatrist  for  a  period  after  his
discharge,  and  he  continued  with  his  medication.  He  did  not  feel  that  the  medication
was necessary, and he discontinued  seeing the psychiatrist and taking the medication
in  about  2014.  He  stated  that  the  psychiatrist  wanted  him  to  continue  with  the
medication, but he did not feel that she was listening to him; that she was not acting in
his best interest; and that “she didn’t truly care about [him] as a patient.” (Tr. at 68-71;
Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant was evaluated at the DOD’s request by a licensed clinical psychologist
in  February  2017.  The  diagnosis  was  bipolar  I  disorder,  current  episode,  hypomanic;
and cannabis use disorder, in prolonged remission. The prognosis was “[p]oor, without
treatment compliance.” The psychologist wrote:
I  expressed  to  [Applicant]  that  I  believed  that  his  diagnosis  from  the
hospital  was  probably  correct,  and  that  it  would  be  wise  to  consider
returning  to  his  psychiatrist  for  follow-up  treatment.  His  face  immediately
fell, and he became serious and sad for the only time in the interview. He
was  not  convinced  that  he did  indeed  have a mental  health  problem that
could compromise his judgment, but stated that he would return to see his
psychiatrist  for  medication.  However,  because  hypomanic  episodes  are
to  medicated  states,
pleasant  and  enjoyable,  especially
compliance  with  medication  is  often  poor  early  in  the  disorder,  just  as  it
has been with [Applicant]. Until he has demonstrated a good track record
relative
of  compliance  with  treatment,  he  is  at  risk  for  another  manic  episode,
during which his judgment and reliability will be severely impaired. (GE 4)
Applicant does not agree with the diagnosis. He feels the psychologist rushed the
evaluation.  He  has  received  regular  counseling  from  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker
since  April  2018.  He  was  diagnosed  with  adjustment  disorder,  unspecified.  (Tr.  at  44,
52-59, 71-74) The LCSW reported:
In  my  observation  of  [Applicant]  over  the  past  several  months  I  see  no
reason he should not continue to work at his present job and continue to
function at a high-level. I see no reason from my sessions and interaction
with  [Applicant]  that  a  security  clearance  should  be  revoked  and  do  not
think  he  poses  a  risk  to  national  security.  .  .  .  I  see  no  evidence  of  the
psychotic  episode  or  bipolar  affective  disorder,  depression  or  psychosis.
[Applicant] has not been taking medications according to the records since
2014  and  it  has  not  been  indicated  since  I  have  been  working  with  him
since April of 2018. I have not needed to refer [Applicant] for a medication
consult  for  bipolar  disorder  or  any  other  psychiatric  diagnosis  since  I’ve
been  seeing  him.  I  have  seen  [Applicant]  several  times  a  month  since
April, 2018. I believe he  is emotionally stable and is an asset to his work
place and  [is] a  productive  team  member.  (Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,
encl 5)
Applicant  sought  his own  evaluation  from  a  psychologist  and  a  licensed  clinical
psychologist
in  October  2018.  They  diagnosed  him  with  adjustment  disorder,
unspecified. They recommended therapy, stimulating self-care activities, a healthy diet,
regular exercise, and a proper amount of sleep in order to promote a more even mood
and better focus. The evaluation further noted:
It  is  plausible  that  [Applicant]  may  have  been  experiencing  significantly
distressing thoughts and feelings associated with anxiety and panic when
he  was  hospitalized  in  2013  due  to  situational  stressors  at  that  time,
however  his  functional  abilities  across  domains  seem  to  be  considerably
stable in recent years. [Applicant] may be experiencing some symptoms of
anxiety  related  to  his  current  adjudicative  proceedings,  however  not  to  a
clinical  or  otherwise  abnormal  level  compared  to  other  individuals  in  his
age category. (Applicant’s response to SOR, encl 6)
Applicant  married  in  2014  and  has  two  young  children.  His  father  and  brother
moved  out  in  about  2014.  His  father  is  living  in  an  assisted  living  facility.  There  is  no
evidence of recurrence of psychotic or delusional behavior. He is an active member of
his church. He has received guidance and counseling through his church, and his faith
has played a significant role in his development. His wife does not believe he is bipolar,
and  she  has  seen  no  evidence  of  erratic  behavior.  She  described  Applicant  as  calm,
even-keel, and a very peaceful person. (Tr. at 37-46, 55-56, 71, 75)
Applicant called witnesses and presented documents and letters attesting to his
strong moral character and outstanding job performance. He is praised for his emotional
stability, character, trustworthiness, and honesty. (Tr. at 16-36; Applicant’s response to
SOR)

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e) without comment.
I have incorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful
review  of  the  pleadings,  Applicant’s  testimony  and  the  exhibits,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is 26  years old.  He  is not married  and  has no  children.  He  graduated
from  high  school  in  2011.  Since  June  2013,  he  has  worked  at  a  naval  shipyard  for  a
defense contractor. (SCA) He previously had an interim clearance, but does not hold a
clearance currently. He earns about $27 an hour. (Tr. 16, 27, 49)
The  SOR  concerns  allegations  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  diagnosed
psychological  conditions  and  has  failed  to  follow  the  treatment  recommendations  of
medical professionals in addressing them responsibly, resulting in a poor prognosis.
In  March  2018,  in  connection  with  the  adjudication  of  his  clearance  application,
Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed  clinical  psychologist  (Ph.D.)  at  the  DOD  CAF’s
request, to determine if Applicant had any mental, emotional, or personality conditions
that  could  impair  his  judgment,  reliability,  or  trustworthiness.  The  evaluation  also
addressed  Applicant’s  history  of  irresponsible  behavior  and  his  problems  with  impulse
control, including a police record and delinquent debts. (GE 2)
In the summary of the evaluation, the “BLUF,” or “bottom line up front,” the DOD
evaluator found  that  Applicant  “displays  characteristics  that  could  impair  his judgment,
reliability, or trustworthiness. He has been diagnosed with ADHD, combined type, and is
not currently taking the medication recommended to him by his treating provider.” (GE 2
at  1)  The  evaluator  also  noted  Applicant’s  prior  aggressive  behavior,  and  evasion  of
responsibility, in both criminal and financial contexts. The evaluator found that Applicant
did  not  display  the  insight  and  commitment  to  treatment  that  are  prerequisites  for  real
change, resulting in a poor prognosis. (GE 2 at 1)
In  2011,  the  year  he  graduated  high  school,  Applicant  was  charged  with
misdemeanor reckless driving and felony eluding a police officer, after he “spun tires” in
a parking lot and drove away from an approaching police car. He may also have been
street racing. (GE 1 at 24-25; GE 2 at 3; Tr. 30-31) The police report regarding this charge
is not in the record, and this conduct is not alleged in the SOR.
In 2014, Applicant was involved in an altercation between his mother and her then-
husband,  his  stepfather.  Applicant  reported  that  his  stepfather  “tried  to  kill  her.”  In
response, Applicant pulled out a handgun and fired a warning shot into the ground in an
effort to protect his mother from physical harm. Applicant was charged with brandishing
a firearm. The charge was dismissed after he attended anger management counseling
and a gun safety class. (Tr. 29-30; GE 2 at 3) The police report regarding this charge is
not in the record, and this conduct is not alleged in the SOR.
The  2018  DOD  evaluation  notes  that,  in  about  October  2014,  Applicant  was
diagnosed  with  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  combined  type,  and
adjustment  disorder  with  anxiety  and  depressed  mood.  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  The  diagnosing
provider, Mr. G, is described as an “LPC” (licensed professional counselor). (GE 2 at 4)
Elsewhere  in  the  evaluation,  it  is  noted  that  the  diagnosis  was  made  by  Mr.  B,  a
physician’s assistant. (GE 2 at 3)
Applicant acknowledged at hearing that he sought treatment from his physician in
October 2014, after he found himself losing focus at work. He was diagnosed with ADHD
and prescribed medication. (Tr. 52) He said he stopped taking his medication after a few
months because he was having financial trouble and could not afford it. (Tr. 37-40, 52-
54; GE 2 at 2)
Earlier, Applicant sought treatment from his primary care physician for anxiety in
2012, after he was terminated from a job. (SOR ¶ 1.a) (Tr. 32-33; GE 2 at 1, 2) The anxiety
diagnosis  itself  is  not  specifically  referenced  in  the  DOD  CAF  evaluation,  or otherwise
documented. Applicant attended one therapy session and was prescribed medication. He
stopped taking the medication on his own after about two weeks because it was affecting
his sleep. (Tr. 28-29, 33-35, 56)
The fact that Applicant discontinued treatment and stopped taking his medication
in  the  past  on  these  two  occasions  is  alleged  at  SOR  ¶  1.d.  Applicant’s  courses  of
treatment  and  medication  regimen  on  both  occasions  are  undocumented,  except  as
referenced in the DOD evaluation.
On his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had once been “admitted as inpatient” for
mental health treatment. (GE 1) He clarified at hearing that this was a misunderstanding,
and that all of his treatment and counseling had been “outpatient.” (Tr. 63-65)
The  DOD  evaluator  noted  that  Applicant  “appears  to  have  a  valid  diagnosis  of
ADHD, based on a pattern of impulsivity and neglect of responsibilities, as documented
in his record.” (Emphasis added). Applicant denied experiencing ADHD symptoms in his
interview, so the evaluator found that “an independent diagnosis cannot be definitively
made.” The evaluator’s conclusion was based largely on a review of Applicant’s records,
since Applicant denied any current issues during his evaluation and was skeptical that
the prior recommendations for treatment he had received were necessary or appropriate.
The evaluator found that the information in the interview was not sufficient to overcome
the diagnoses of his past providers. (GE 2 at 3, 4)
The evaluator concluded that Applicant “could address his ADHD with treatment
compliance  and  could  potentially  decrease  his  aggression  and  irresponsibility  with
appropriate  treatment.  But  first,  he  needs  “insight  that  his  impulsivity,  aggression,  and
irresponsibility are problematic and [needs to] comply with treatment consistently, for  a
number of  years.”  The  evaluator concluded  that  were  Applicant to demonstrate  two  or
more years of treatment compliance, that might lead to a good prognosis by a treatment
provider  or  independent  evaluator.  However,  Applicant  has  yet  to  demonstrate  the
necessary  level  of  insight  or  treatment  compliance.  (GE  3  at  5)  Nevertheless,  the
evaluator did not specifically diagnose Applicant with ADHD.
The evaluator diagnosed Applicant with attention deficit disorder (ADD), combined
type, by history, with a poor prognosis. (GE 2 at 5)  (SOR ¶ 1.d) The evaluator did not
note a diagnostic code from the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-V) to clarify whether the ADD diagnosis was mild, moderate, or severe. (See DSM-
V at 60-61)
As  noted  in  the  summary,  the  evaluator  found  that  Applicant  had  other
psychological  characteristics  that  interfere  with  his  judgment,  trustworthiness,  and
reliability, including his “history of impulsive aggression, poor judgment in evading police,
and evasion of financial responsibilities.” (GE 3 at 5) But the evaluator did not conclude
that Applicant’s ADD was sufficient to impact his judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.
Applicant testified that he loves his job at the shipyard. Without a clearance, he is
significantly  restricted  on  what  he  can  do  and  where  he  can  go  at  work.  He  wants  to
advance professionally and is willing to do what is necessary to do that. (Tr. 48-49)
In January 2019, after receiving the SOR, Applicant  sought out his primary care
physician. (Tr. 44-48) The progress notes from their March 2019 treatment session (post-
hearing)  reflect  that  Applicant  had  presented  with  a  past  history  of  ADD  and  was
requesting  assistance  with  his  appeal  for  a  government  security  clearance.  He  was
prescribed  ADD  medications  as  a  child.  Some  medications  were  more  effective  than
others. Applicant expressed a willingness to see a clinical psychologist for counseling and
would like to try medication. (AE A at 6) Applicant’s primary care doctor diagnosed him
with adult ADD, referred him to counseling, and prescribed Wellbutrin. (AE A at 1, 8)
Applicant later reported that he had been unable to locate a psychiatrist with new
patient  openings  or  with  office  hours  outside  of  his  work  schedule.  He  meets  with  an
informal counselor at his church once or twice a week. (AE B, AE C)
",True
"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old senior software engineer, who has been employed by a
defense contractor since January 1, 2015.1 He previously worked as a subcontractor for the
company.  Applicant  began  cohabiting  with  his spouse  in  approximately October 2013.
They married in October 2017. In May 2011, Applicant was awarded a bachelor’s degree in
computational  mathematics  and  an  “All  but  Thesis”  master’s  degree  in  applied
mathematics. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 20-21.)
Applicant began suffering from depression as a teenager. He attempted suicide in
2006. (Tr. 22-23.) At age 18, he had suicidal thoughts that led to some psychotherapy and
medication management. He found the psychotherapy unhelpful and did not continue after
some initial contacts. (GE 2.)
1 Applicant testified that he worked as a subcontractor for his employer “right out of college in 2011 or 2012.”
(Tr. 20.) He provided dates for that employment on his SF 86 of February 2012 to December 2013, and
indicated that he started at another company (company X) in January 2014. At his hearing, he testified that he
worked for company X for about a year before becoming a direct hire of his current employer on January 1,
2014. The dates on his SF 86 would indicate a start date instead of January 2015 for his current employment.
The SF 86 of record was signed on January 6, 2015. (GE 1.)
While  in  college  from  August  2007  to  August  2011,  Applicant  experienced
depression that went untreated. In 2010, he attempted suicide while stressed because of
school demands. He did not pursue mental health treatment at that time. It was a wake-up
call for him. He left college in August 2011 before finishing his thesis, and he voluntarily
sought psychiatric treatment from December 2011 to March 2012. He took medication for
his depression for about six months with some improvement in his condition. Apparently in
consultation with his then treating psychiatrist, Applicant stopped taking the medication with
no apparent adverse impacts on his mental health for the next two years. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 22-
23.)
Applicant worked as an online sales manager for a computer hardware reseller and
then as an associate software developer, where he was placed as a subcontractor with his
current employer starting in February 2012. (GE 2.) In approximately 2014, Applicant was
diagnosed  with  a  medical  condition  that  can  cause  chronic  pain.  In  May  2014,  he
purchased his current residence. Stressed financially, often in a great deal of pain, and
very  depressed,  Applicant  had  impaired  functionality  and  was  unable  to  work  for
approximately one year. (Tr. 24.) He was not yet on appropriate medications. (Tr. 19, 25.)
He attempted suicide one time in 2014, but he has not had any suicide attempts since
then. (Tr. 29.) Applicant attributes his poor mental health at that time to his physical illness.
(Tr. 25.) His spouse held the household together while he spent much of the year in bed.
She had a small business. She paid the bills, purchased the groceries, and took care of
him. (GE 2.)
In mid-May 2014, Applicant began treatment from his primary care physician for
diagnosed depression and for some medical conditions, including a longstanding seizure
disorder, well controlled with medication. Applicant was placed on Zoloft to be reevaluated
in one month. He experienced moderate improvement in his depression by mid-June 2014,
and reported no substance abuse or suicidal ideation, but he continued to lack energy and
enthusiasm. He complained of some fatigue over the summer, and recurrent seizures led
to changes in his anti-depressant medication. By late August 2014, his depression had
increased to where he had some passive suicidal thoughts. Several medication changes
led to some improvement in his mood, but he continued to experience fatigue and pain. As
of late September 2014, his anxiety was interfering with his concentration, and he had
moderate depression but no substance abuse or suicidal ideation. By November 2014, he
was able to work from home. His depression was stable, and he had moderate control of
his medical condition that causes him chronic pain. (GE 3.)
Applicant experienced increased anxiety in late 2014 and early 2015 related to his
return to work. (Tr. 26.) From December 3, 2014, through March 24, 2015, Applicant had
nine counseling sessions with a licensed psychologist for treatment of diagnosed moderate
depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Applicant presented as moderately
to  severely  depressed,  chronic  and  recurrent,  and  he  described  overwhelming  panic
attacks that became debilitating and compromised his functionality. In the opinion of the
psychologist, Applicant’s symptoms were serious and interfered with his productivity at
work and home. His concentration and decision-making ability were impaired, and he was
at ongoing risk of suicide. Throughout their sessions, Applicant’s progress and prognosis
were assessed as poor. (GE 4.)
On  December  22,  2014,  Applicant  completed  and  electronically  certified  to  the
accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions that he signed on January 6,
2015. He disclosed that he had mental health counseling from December 2011 to March
2012  and  was  currently  in  treatment  with  his  primary  care  physician  and  the  licensed
psychologist. (GE 1.)
During an office visit with his primary care physician in mid-March 2015, Applicant
reported less pain on his medication regimen. His fatigue issues were in moderate control,
but  his  depression  was  in  poor  control.  He  was  placed  on  Cymbalta  to  address  his
depression primarily with a hoped for positive effect on his chronic pain and fatigue. As of
June 2015, the Cymbalta was no longer effective in controlling Applicant’s depression. He
complained  of  more  fatigue  and  worsening  musculoskeletal  pain  with  no  relief  from
narcotics. His primary care physician referred him to a psychiatrist. (GE 3.) Applicant began
seeing a psychiatrist monthly, although he did not follow through on her recommendation
that he obtain psychotherapy because he did not have the time, money, or energy. (GE 2.)
At the recommendation of a friend, Applicant began smoking marijuana in 2015 to
treat his chronic pain. Over the next three years, he smoked a bowl of marijuana twice
weekly. He found marijuana to be an effective pain medication, and he continued to use it,
knowing that it was illegal. After six months of using the drug illegally, he informed his
primary care physician about his marijuana use. His physician provided him information
about how to obtain medical marijuana in the state. Applicant did not apply for a medical
marijuana  card  at  that  time  because  it  was  cost  prohibitive  for  him.  He  continued  to
purchase marijuana illegally from an acquaintance. Applicant did not use any marijuana at
work. (GE 2; Tr. 17-18, 32-33.)
In early 2016, Applicant experienced debilitating pain from his medical condition. At
the suggestion of his psychiatrist, Applicant received treatment at a psychiatric hospital
from February 24, 2016, through March 18, 2016, for diagnosed major depressive disorder,
recurrent; generalized anxiety disorder; and unspecified cannabis-related disorder. He was
treated initially in a partial hospitalization program and then at the intensive outpatient level
of care. At discharge, he was referred to a psychiatric practice and prescribed medications,
including Lithium for suicidal thoughts, Nortriptyline for his depression, and Buspar and
Xanax (as needed) for anxiety. Nortriptyline improved his depression and pain sufficiently
so that he could return to work. (GE 2; Tr. 26-27.)
Applicant began psychotherapy for “severe depression and severe anxiety” with a
licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) in December 2017 after his psychiatrist told him that
he had to participate in psychotherapy if he wanted to continue in treatment with her. For
financial reasons, Applicant took a break from his psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW
from January 2018 until late February 2018. (GE 2.)
Applicant was denied interim security-clearance eligibility in February 2018. It had
no impact on his present duties. He discussed the declination of his interim clearance with
his  current  supervisors,  and  they  want  to  retain  him  if  he  is  denied  security-clearance
eligibility, but it could have future impacts as to project assignments. (Tr. 21-22.) Applicant
did not indicate to what extent, if any, he discussed the issues  that generated security
concern with his supervisors.
At the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant had a psychological evaluation by a
licensed psychologist on March 4, 2018.  Applicant’s diagnosis was complicated by his
medical problems and multiple medications, but his depression and anxiety appeared to be
prominent issues. Applicant disclosed his illegal marijuana use for pain, and he expressed
a plan to continue his marijuana use. He expressed uncertainty about whether he would
stop  using  marijuana,  even  if  required  for  his  security  clearance.  The  psychologist
diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe; generalized anxiety
disorder; and cannabis use disorder, mild, and concluded that Applicant has a condition
that could negatively impact his judgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness. In his
clinical  opinion,  Applicant’s  condition  is being  partially  treated,  but  Applicant’s “chronic
suicidal thoughts and recent ultimatum from his prescriber about starting psychotherapy
are concerns.” (GE 2.) He gave Applicant a guarded prognosis, despite finding it likely that
Applicant would continue in treatment with his present providers. The psychologist opined
that should Applicant discontinue mental health treatment, his reliability, judgment, and
stability would be negatively impacted. (GE 2.) Applicant had suicidal thoughts in 2018
because of financial issues, which have since been resolved with some financial help from
family members. (Tr. 19, 28, 47.)
In  May  2018,  Applicant  and  his  spouse  obtained  medical  marijuana  cards
authorizing them to use marijuana legally in their state.2 (Tr. 17-18, 40.) The drug alleviates
Applicant’s  insomnia  and  acute  anxiety  attacks.  (Tr.  31.)  Since  obtaining  his  medical
marijuana card, Applicant has used marijuana “pretty much on a daily basis,” although not
before reporting to work or before driving a vehicle.  (Tr. 33, 41.) He used marijuana the
night before his security clearance hearing, knowing that marijuana is illegal under federal
law. Before obtaining their medical marijuana cards, Applicant and his spouse discussed
the  possible  impact  on  his job.  Applicant  suspected,  but  did  not  know  for certain,  that
medical marijuana use is against DOD policy. Applicant admitted at his hearing that he is
‘probably not” willing to stop using marijuana to obtain a security clearance. Applicant has
tried  alternative  therapies  to  marijuana,  including  dietary  changes,  legal  medications,
tobacco, exercise, and cannabidiol, but they have not been as effective as marijuana in
addressing  his  pain  or  his  anxiety.  (Tr.  34-36,  45-46.)  Since  acquiring  their  medical
2 On October 1, 2012, Applicant’s state passed an act concerning the palliative use of marijuana, allowing a
licensed  physician  to  certify  an  adult  patient’s  use  of  marijuana  after  determining  that  the  patient  has  a
debilitating medical condition as defined by the act or subsequently approved by the state’s Department of
Consumer Protection and that the potential benefits of the palliative use of marijuana would likely outweigh its
health risk. Patients are required to have a written certification by a physician, which is valid for one year, and
are required to obtain their marijuana from a state-licensed dispensary. A qualifying patient who has a valid
registration certificate from the state’s Department of Consumer Protection is not authorized to possess an
amount  of  usable  marijuana  in  quantity  exceeding  that  reasonably  necessary  to  ensure  uninterrupted
availability for one month.
marijuana cards, Applicant and his spouse have obtained their marijuana solely from state-
licensed dispensaries. (Tr. 41.)
Applicant did not have any suicidal thoughts in the six months preceding his April
2019 hearing, but suicidal thoughts have been a recurring issue for him his entire adult life.
(Tr.  30.)  He  has  been  taking  a  new  medication  in  the  past  few  months  that  has  been
helpful. (Tr. 28.) Applicant has been under the care of his current psychotherapist since
January 2019. (Tr. 31.)
Applicant’s spouse testified that she has seen a marked improvement in Applicant’s
mental health in the last year. (Tr. 38.) In her opinion, his depression has lessened as he
has been able to get his physical pain under control. (Tr. 39.)
Applicant showed his spouse his latest work performance evaluation, which was
very positive. He obtained a raise and a promotion in January 2019 to senior software
engineer. (Tr. 42-43.)

"SOR 1.a alleges that Applicant was hospitalized from October to November 2014
on  an  emergency  basis  for  depression  and  suicidal  thoughts.  He  was  diagnosed  with
Bipolar Disorder. Applicant admitted this allegation. SOR 1.b alleges that Applicant was
diagnosed  with  Bipolar  Disorder  II  in  May  2018  in  an  evaluation  conducted  by  the
Department of Defense. Though the evaluator determined that the condition was in full
remission, the evaluator opined that Applicant’s lack of candor during the evaluation led
him to conclude that Applicant would not likely seek treatment if his symptoms recurred.
In his September 2018 answer, he denied this allegation. In his October 2018 answer, he
indicated that he could neither admit nor deny the allegation because the Government
psychologist did not disclose the diagnosis to him. The second reason is that Applicant
denies  that  he  was  not  candid  during  the  examination  and  that  he  would  not  seek
treatment if his symptoms recurred. (GE 1; GE 3 at 25; GE 4; September 2018 response
to SOR)
Applicant is 70 years old. He has been married for 46 years and has five adult-
aged children. From 1969 until his honorable discharge in 1975, Applicant served in the
U.S. Army on active duty and in the Reserve. In 1974, Applicant received an Associate’s
of  Arts  degree.  In  1976,  he  received  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in  mechanical
engineering.  He  received  a  professional  engineer’s  license  in  1983.  He  has  held  a
security clearance since 1969. Applicant has been employed as an integration engineer
for a defense contractor since 2004. From October 2014 through February 2015 (when
he submitted his most recent e-QIP), Applicant was on medical leave. (GE 2 at 7-28; AE
A; AE C at 5; Tr. 23-27, 28-34)
In  1983,  Applicant  began  working  for  a  pharmaceutical  company  as  a  project
engineer. In 1984 or 1985, he started to become depressed and suicidal. This was the
first time he could remember having depressive symptoms. He sought treatment during
his employment at the company, though in 1984, he declined advice to seek treatment.
In 1993, he terminated his employment with the company rather than comply with advice
to seek treatment. Applicant started working on his relative’s farm because his family was
worth  more  to  him  than  his  job  at  the  company.  He  worked  there  until  2004.  Then,
Applicant  began  working  as  an  integration  engineer for  the  predecessor  of  his  current
employer. He is still working for the same company at the same location at the present
time. (GE 3 at 80; Tr. 35-40, 54-58) See also, AE C, attachment.
Applicant voluntarily entered inpatient treatment (for the first time) in October 2014
at the hospital identified in SOR 1.a. During his hospitalization for suicidal thoughts and
depression  over  the  next  three  weeks,  he  met  with  a  psychologist  regularly  and  was
prescribed medication. Though he could not remember informing the medical staff that
he had two contradictory personalities or that he was a prophet, he did recall telling them
he  had  the  power  to  move  storms,  but  had  not  moved  any  in  over  three  years.  At  his
discharge, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After his discharge in November 2014,
he  received  outpatient  treatment,  including  medication.  He  has  had  no  subsequent
treatment or medication since July 2015. He has not had a relapse of his condition since
his November 2014 discharge. (GE 3 at 80; Tr. 40-43, 48, 65-69, 70)
Other  than  the  inpatient  treatment  in  October  2014,  Applicant  recalled  seeking
outpatient  psychological  and  psychiatric  counseling,  electroconvulsive  therapy,  and
psychotropic  medication  periodically  over  the  years  since  1985.  The  consults  and
medications would work temporarily. When the treatment worked, he enjoyed life and was
not depressed. When the treatment stopped working, Applicant’s symptoms returned and
he discontinued treatment. Sometimes the side effects of the prescribed medication were
worse than the mental condition itself. (Tr. 51-52, 59-61) See also, AE C, attachment.
A  Government  psychologist  (Dr.  D)  was  asked  by  the  DOD  CAF  to  evaluate
Applicant for the purpose of determining whether Applicant’s reliability or judgment posed
a threat to his proper handling of classified information grounded on the belief that he may
have  a  condition  or diagnosis which,  if  left  untreated,  may  disqualify  him from  security
clearance  eligibility.  In  May  2018,  Dr.  D  conducted  an  online  evaluation  at  Applicant’s
home.  The  evaluation  included  a  clinical  interview.  The  online  evaluation,  which  was
conducted using Applicant’s computer and his cell phone, made Applicant uncomfortable
because he did not believe he could trust the Government psychologist. In addition, he
did  not  want  to  experience  the  emotional  pain  associated  with  talking  about  his  past
psychological  history,  and  even  though  the  government  psychologist  explained  to  him
that not talking about the history could have an adverse impact on his security clearance
application. (Tr. 43-47)
Dr.  D  prepared and  submitted  a  “DOD CAF  EVALUATION”  in  May  2018. The
sources  for  Dr.  D’s  ultimate  opinions  were  an  online  administered  clinical  interview  of
Applicant, a review of his medical records and a personal assessment inventory (PAI).
The  evaluation  included  an  interview  with  Applicant’s  wife  who  informed  Dr.  D  that
Applicant was much better currently and had worked through his issues. Dr. D noted that
Applicant  was  unwilling  to  discuss  triggers  and  causes  of  his  depression.  He  denied
discussing  the  dynamics  of  his  historically  depressive  events  and  would  reply  to  the
doctor’s questions into his psychological history  with statements instead of answers to
the  questions.  One  such  statement  was  citing  his  core  issues  without  explaining  what
those core issues were. Another statement he used to field several of Dr. D’s questions
was  replying  that  he  did  not  remember  his  psychological  history.  During  Applicant’s
discussion  of  his  treatment  history  to  Dr.  D,  Applicant  indicated  he  had  seen  many
psychiatrists and psychologists over a 30-year period, but was not currently in treatment.
Dr. D did not indicate how long Applicant had not been participating in treatment. (GE 4
at 1-3)
In  the  mental  status  examination  of  his  May  2018  evaluation,  Dr.  D  did  not
observe  any  signs  of  agitation.  There  was  no  consistent  evidence  of  a  loosening  of
associations  and  his  long-term  memory  was  not  considered  intact.  Applicant  denied
psychotic symptoms and visual hallucinations. Dr. D observed no evidence of “paranoia
or ideas of reference, although direct questions about this topic were deflected.”  There
was no evidence of mania. The PAI results disclosed that there was no psychopathology
that would be considered serious or damaging. The clinical interview and PAI indicated a
lack  of  current  psychological  symptoms  that  would  disqualify  him  from  possessing  a
security clearance. Dr. D’s diagnosis, based on Applicant’s previous psychiatric history of
Bipolar  Disorder  diagnosed  during  the  SOR  1.a  hospitalization,  was  Hx  (based  on
previous history): Bipolar Disorder, in full remission. (GE 4 at 3-4)
In the prognosis section of his evaluation, Dr. D opined that Applicant’s refusal
to provide a forthright discussion into his mental health history showed a lack of judgment,
particularly  because  the  potential  negative  impact  on  Applicant’s  employment  would
usually  persuade  an  uncooperative  applicant  to  reveal  the  requested  information.  If,
according to Dr. D, Applicant has a mental condition, then it likely will never be treated.
Based on Applicant’s resistance to treatment, Dr. D was unable to recommend Applicant
for a security clearance. (GE 4 at 3-4; AE C, attachment)
In  December  2018,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  psychiatrist  (Dr.  E)  at  the
request of Applicant’s attorney. (The qualifications of Dr. E to testify in forensic psychiatry
were stipulated by the parties.) Applicant was very cooperative with Dr. E because the
face-to-face contact nurtured Applicant’s trust in the doctor. (Tr. 48-49, 77-78)
Dr. E prepared and submitted an evaluation of Applicant in December 2018. The
basis  for  his  opinion  were  DOD  records,  inpatient  medical  records  from  the  SOR  1.a
hospitalization, Dr. D’s evaluation, and Applicant’s seven-page statement chronicling his
psychiatric  treatment.  Dr.  E  conducted  a  four-hour  face-to  face  clinical  interview  with
Applicant. He administered a PAI that was interpreted by a Ph.D (field not identified). Dr.
E also interviewed Applicant’s wife for 30 minutes, and reviewed the SOR. (AE C at 1,
and attachment; Tr. 80-82)
According  to  Dr.  E’s  evaluation,  Applicant  suffered  from  depression  from  the
middle 1980s through 2015. Applicant’s depression was characterized by loss of energy,
loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with focus. Before Applicant’s hospitalization in
October 2014 (SOR 1.a), he had electroconvulsive surgery. Since 2015, he has had no
clinically significant depression. Applicant never had a problem with alcohol although he
drank  more  when  he  was  in  a  depressed  mood.  Applicant’s  wife  informed  Dr.  E  that
Applicant  has  been  psychologically  stable  since  2015,  with  no  serious  depression  or
mania. Applicant’s mental status exam revealed coherent speech with no abnormalities
in speech. His affective responses disclosed “no current evidence of depression, anxiety,
hypomania,  mania  or  inappropriate  affect.”  Applicant  indicated  that  he  feels  sad
sometimes, but has not had severe depression in more than three years. Dr. E observed
no attention or concentration problems and Applicant denied sleep and eating problems.
Overall,  Dr.  E  found  intact  Applicant’s  cognitive  functioning  with  no  mood  problems  or
psychosis. Drs. D and E found no evidence of psychopathology in their review of the PAI
results. (AE C at 2-8)
Following  his  complete  examination  of  all  the  information  presented  concerning
Applicant,  Dr.  E  found  that  Applicant  was  cooperative  in  discussing  all  areas  of  his
psychiatric  history.  His  decision  to  refuse  medical  treatment  was  not  caused  by  a
“‘resistance to treatment’” as expressed by Dr. D, but a lack of continuous improvement,
or reaching the conclusion that the treatment did not work. Dr. E’s diagnosis of Applicant
was recurrent major depression in full remission. Dr. E believed that based on Applicant’s
clinical interview and his wife’s observations, his condition had been in remission for at
least three years. Unlike Dr. D, Dr. E did not believe Applicant had a condition or diagnosis
that would impact his reliability or judgment in a manner that could present a threat for
mishandling  classified  information.  Dr.  E  indicated  “I  found  nothing  to  suggest  that
[Applicant’s] current condition would impair his ability to be reliable, trustworthy, of good
conduct  and  character,  honest,  with  integrity  and  loyal  to  the  United  States.”  Dr.  E
determined  that  Applicant  would  comply  with  security  regulations.  Dr.  E  believes  that
Applicant’s condition is treatable. Because of the statistical likelihood of a recurrence of
a  major  depressive  episode  in  the  future,  Dr.  E  recommended  a  psychiatrist  monitor
Applicant regularly. (AE C at 9-10; Tr. 85, 92-97)
At  the  hearing,  Dr.  E  was  asked  to  comment  on  statements  made  by  Applicant
during his hospitalization in October 2014. (SOR 1.a) Those statements included hitting
himself in the head with a hammer, stating he was a prophet, and having  the power to
move  storms.  Dr.  E  explained  those  events  were  psychotic  symptoms,  which  are
delusional or false  beliefs,  and  occur with  individuals who  have  a bipolar disorder in  a
manic  state. When  those  delusions  or false  beliefs  go  into  remission,  the  false  beliefs
disappear.  If  Applicant  had  reported  those  delusions  or  false  beliefs,  Dr.  E  may  have
changed  his  diagnosis  to  schizoaffective  personality  disorder,  depending  on  the
persistence of the delusion or false belief. If the belief was transient and not fixed, then
Dr. E would consider a schizotypal disorder where the individual is not psychotic, but they
have an odd belief that is not a delusion. In Dr. E’s opinion, a power to move storms in
the context of a normal mood that was not revealed in the medical records or Applicant’s
mental examination,  could  support a  diagnosis of  schizotypal personality  disorder.  (Tr.
85-89)
Dr. E considered the October 2014 (SOR 1.a) bipolar diagnosis was actually an
episode  of  agitated  depression  that  was  more  consistent  with  a  30-year  history  of
depressive  symptoms.  Even  though  a  schizotypal  personality  disorder  may  be  more
difficult  to  treat,  a  peculiar  belief  (in  the  context  of  a  normal  mood)  may  not  need
treatment. Dr. E believes that Applicant’s wife will ensure that Applicant pursues treatment
in the future as he has done in the past. (Tr. 100-108)

Psychological Conditions
The SOR alleges psychological conditions security concerns based on Applicant’s
diagnosis in approximately 2005 of delusional disorder – chronic, paranoid type. In May
2018,  she  was  diagnosed  with  delusional  disorder  chronic  -  paranoid  type;  major
depressive disorder, severe, in partial remission; and unspecified anxiety disorder. Her
prognosis was listed as poor.
In 2004, Applicant was advised by her general practitioner to see a psychiatrist.
She had been diagnosed in 2002 with two sexually transmitted diseases (STD), which
caused  her  severe  anxiety.  She  had  thoughts  about  dying  of  cancer,  feelings  of
depression,  and  her  condition  caused  her  to  excessively  pick  at  her  skin.  She  also
believed  people  were  talking  negatively  about  her.  She  began  seeing  a  psychiatrist  in
2004, who referred her to a psychologist in 2005. Applicant claimed she was diagnosed
with  anxiety  and  depression  only,  and  denied  being  aware  of  the  delusional  disorder
diagnosis. She claimed she learned that she had been diagnosed with that condition after
she received the SOR in September 2018. Applicant was prescribed an anti-depressant,
an anti-seizure medication for her fear of flight, and an anti-psychotic drug. She believed
the medications prescribed were to treat her anxiety and depression. She stopped seeing
the psychologist in 2006, but continued her appointments with the psychiatrist.2
Beginning  in  2007,  Applicant  started  to  wean  herself  from  her  prescribed
medications without consulting or notifying her psychiatrist. She claimed she had asked
her psychiatrist why she was taking an anti-psychotic drug, but he stated he could not
remember.  She  asked  him  how  long  she  would  continue  taking  all  of  the  prescribed
medications, and his reply was that she would most likely remain on the medication for
the rest of her life. Applicant believed the medication caused her to feel obsessive, sad,
and added stress. She began to taper off from her medications over a period of time.  She
1 Tr. 17-18.
2 Tr. 21-23, 26, 40, 52-56; GE 3, GE 5; AE Q.
also  attributed  her  weight  gain  -  almost  100  pounds,  to  the  medication.  In  September
2008, Applicant informed her psychiatrist that she had completely weaned herself from
the prescribed medications. She also let him know that she would not continue further
treatment with him.3
Since  September  2008,  Applicant  has  not  treated  with  any  other  mental  health
practitioner,  nor  has  she  taken  any  prescribed  medication  for  her  mental  health
conditions. She attended a one-day self-help seminar in 2007. It was a 12-step program
entitled Self Abuse Finally Ends (SAFE). Applicant was attending church at the time, and
she correlated Bible stories with the information she learned from the SAFE seminar. She
asked her minister if she could start a 12-week group at the church to connect with people
who had similar issues. Beginning in 2008, she led five 12-week self-help sessions. One
or two other people attended the support sessions. The sessions ended in approximately
2009. Applicant attended a Christian-based recovery program through a different church.
Within six months, another minister asked her to lead the group. This support group ended
in 2011. Applicant feels that her life is good, she is supported by her husband, and she
claims that she no longer suffers from any mental health-related issues.4
Applicant applied for a DOD security clearance in 2007. During her background
interview, she reported that her psychiatrist approved of her tapering off of her prescribed
medications. Shortly after the interview, her investigation was terminated since Applicant
no longer worked for the employer who sponsored her for the security clearance.5
In May 2018, in connection with her current application, Applicant was asked by
DOD to undergo an evaluation with a licensed clinical psychologist, during the course of
her  investigation  for  a  position  of  trust.  After  the  evaluation  and  psychological  testing,
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  delusional  disorder,  chronic,  paranoid  type;  major
depressive disorder, severe, in partial remission; and unspecified anxiety disorder. During
the  evaluation,  she  again  expressed  thoughts  that  others  were  talking  about  her  in  a
negative manner. Although she has been diagnosed with a STD that can lead to cancer,
the  psychologist  noted  her  preoccupation  with  having  cancer  bordered  on  delusional.
Applicant discontinued her hobbies of exercising and going to church, which had helped
improve her mental health status in the past. Applicant’s previous treatment records were
also  considered  in  the  evaluation.  The  DOD  psychologist  determined  that  given
Applicant’s mental health history, lack of treatment, lack of engagement of activities that
reportedly helped stabilize her mood, and her limited insight, Applicant’s prognosis was
poor. The psychologist  opined that  her mental  health  status may  impair her  judgment,
reliability, or ability to properly safeguard classified information.6

On December 27, 2018, Applicant participated a psychological evaluation via video
teleconference at her counsel’s request. The examination showed Applicant had logical,
clear thought patterns, rational ideation, and normal perceptive processing. The evaluator
determined that Applicant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to a
traumatic break-up of a relationship and the resulting STD.7 Applicant was found to be a
well-adjusted  wife,  stepmother,  and  employee,  and  has  successfully  overcome  the
trauma  from  the  past  that  negatively  impacted  her  life.  Applicant  has  not  had  any
depressive or self-harming incidents within the last decade. Applicant’s diagnosis by the
credentialed licensed clinical social worker, certified substance abuse counselor, master
addiction  counselor,  and  substance  abuse  professional,  was  “no  disorder”  with”  no
treatment recommended.”8 The social worker did not have Applicant’s previous medical
records, but she did have a copy of the SOR.
Applicant’s previous psychologist, who had treated her in 2005-2006, provided a
letter dated January 19, 2019.9 It pertinent part, it reads as follows:
“I am writing this treatment summary letter at the request of (Applicant). …I
saw her for a total of 52 visits between (January 2005) and (July 2006). …She
reported that she was finally terminated because she sent a ‘paranoid’ email,
which was deemed inappropriate. …She indicated that she had difficulties at
that
job  because  she  complained  that  other  team  members  were
surreptitiously reading the documents she was working on. As (Applicant)
and I continued to work together, she began to reveal more overtly paranoid
ideation.  For  example,  she  complained  of  being watched  in  her  home  and
that there were cameras in her house. Because of this she felt compelled to
dress  in  the  dark.  …she  reported  that  she  overheard  people  talking  about
her in the places she was interviewing. …she seemed to misinterpret far off
conversations. In June 2005, she told me that she no longer wanted to see
(psychiatrist) because she heard him playing a tape recording of herself very
loudly  in  his  office  (while  she  was  in  the  waiting  room).  …In  July  2005,
(Applicant) reported that she was fearful she would be fired at work because
she  contacted  her  supervisor  and  complained  that  people  at  work  were
talking about her. (Psychiatrist) increased her medication (Seroquel) in July
2005. By August 2005, her thinking had become much more frankly paranoid.
She asked me directly if I had discussed our meetings with other people. She
also asked me if my office was ‘bugged’ or if I electronically recorded our
sessions.  …In  the  same  session,  she  indicated  that  she  felt  the  City  of
[Redacted] was going to pay her money because of all the ‘torment’ she had
been through.
Her delusions had crystalized around a woman named ‘Karen’, who she felt
was orchestrating all the difficulties she was experiencing. She continued to
believe  that  people  were  watching  her  and  talking  about  her  at  work.  She

thought  they  were  taking  pictures  of  her  …and  circulating  them.  …
(Applicant)  began  to  become  more  concerned  that  her  neighbors  were
talking about her and that they had microphones and cameras in her house.
She reported that at one point she went outside and yelled at them. In March
2006, (Applicant) got a job in [State 1]. She was there for a week and quit.
She  told  me  she  thought  ‘Karen’  was  there  and  was  ‘passing  pictures
around,  trying  to  get  me  fired.’  Similarly,  she  got  a  job  in  [State  2]  and
returned within a month with similar concerns. I last saw her on July 19, 2006.
…we worked on identifying her delusional thoughts and dismissing them as
‘faulty  processing.’  …During  therapy,  I  felt  (Applicant)  made  marginal
progress in dealing with her distressing thoughts, as is common with such
patients  because  of  the  intractability  of  their  belief  system.  The  working
diagnosis  in  her  treatment  was  DSM  5  Delusional  Disorder  (297.1).
Delusional Disorder is characterized by at least one month of delusions, but
no other psychotic symptoms. Delusions are false beliefs based on incorrect
inferences  about  external  reality  that  persist  despite  the  evidence  to  the
contrary.  Since  I  have  not  seen  (Applicant)  since  July  2006,  her  condition
and/or her circumstances may have substantially changed.”

master’s  degree  that  was  awarded  in  2012,  and  additional  educational  certifications.
She has never married, and she has no children.1
Applicant is an honest, intelligent woman who displayed issues at her work in late
2015 and early 2016. She was off work for a period. She sent an e-mail to a co-worker
in January 2016 in which she explained her problems:
Following  the  discussion  we  had  prior  to  the  Holidays,  I  am  seriously
concerned  about  my  safety  at  the  office.  I  don't  care  if  the  whole  world
thinks  I  am  crazy.  Below  are  my  experiences  at  the  office  for  the  past
several months. I believe:
1.  My  eye  movements  are  being  tracked  while  I  am  working.  I  believe  it
tracks your emotions such as Anger, Happy, Hatred etc.
2.  They  are  watching  what  I  eat,  the  time  it  takes  (the  duration  of  every
task that I do), the frequency of my restroom breaks, etc.
3. What really bothers me is the fact that I am being monitored while I am
off work, when I am at home or in my car, the conversations that I have at
home and in my car.
I don't care if you think I am totally crazy, but this has been my experience
at  the  office.  I  am  sick  to  my  stomach.  The  thought  of  being  tracked  of
every  move  I  make  is  draining  me  out  mentally,  physically  and
emotionally. I cannot eat, I cannot sleep and I can't even function properly
not  knowing  what  is  going  on.  There  is  definitely  something  going  on  at
the  office.  No  person  just  simply  thinks  that  these  kinds  of  things  are
happening to them. I have been calling in sick because I am truly terrified
to go to work not knowing what is going on. They are doing something to
harm me. They will hurt me for sure. I am truly concerned about my safety
at the office. . . .2
Applicant’s employer placed her on involuntary leave and recommended that she
see  a  psychiatrist  and  attend  counseling  through  the  employee  assistance  program
(EAP).  She  saw  a  psychiatrist  and  attended  about  nine  sessions  with  a  licensed
professional  counselor  (LPC).  Her  psychiatrist  wrote  a  letter  in  February  2016  and
stated  that  on  examination,  he  “could  confirm  no  psychiatric  contraindication  to

[Applicant] performing her job,” and she was “released psychiatrically to return to work
full-time, without restriction.” She returned to work in early March 2016.3
Applicant was evaluated at the DOD’s request by a licensed psychologist in April
2018. The psychologist wrote:
[Applicant]  struggles  with  the  symptoms  of  a  serious  mental  illness.  She
qualifies  for  a  diagnosis  of  Schizophrenia,  First  Episode,  currently  in
partial remission. Additionally, she qualifies for a diagnosis of Schizotypal
Personality  Disorder.  Her  primary  symptoms  include  bizarre  delusions  of
reference and paranoia (she was being watched by eye-tracking software,
her  mood  was  monitored,  and  she  was  an  unwilling  participant  in  a
research study; she developed delusions about “black projects” funded by
shadow  budgets  and  staffed  by  people  with  aliases  who  were  hidden  by
talking  about  her,
[Employer])  and  auditory  hallucinations  (women
discussing  her,  conducting  a  commentary  about  her
life).  Her
hallucinations  are  a  classic  auditory  type  hallucination  in  that  they  come
from outside of her body (she identified a location), they were generally in
a fixed point of reference (she identified the source as an empty cubicle),
they  were  same-gender  voices  (women),  and  they  were  carrying  on  a
running  commentary  that  was  consistent  with  her  delusions  and  did  not
interact with her.
The psychologist concluded:
Reliability,  Judgment,  Stability,  and  Trustworthiness:  Due  to  the
nature  of  her  mental  illness  and  personality  disorder,  and  due  to  her
inconsistent level of insight and demonstrated ability to be evasive during
an  interview,  it  is  my  clinical  and  professional  opinion  that  [Applicant’s]
Schizophrenia symptom potential and her ongoing Schizotypal Personality
Disorder  symptoms  significantly  impair  her  reliability,  judgment,  stability,
and  trustworthiness.  It  is  clear  that  she  has  no  specific  malicious  intent
and  she  is  most  likely  uninterested  in  any  financial  or  personal  gain  that
could arise from violating her position of trust. However, when dealing with
her delusions,  and  when  in  environments  that  activate  distress  related  to
her  schizotypal  features,  she  is  at  high  risk  for  inappropriately  using,
disclosing,  or  otherwise  compromising  classified  or  secure  information  or
systems. Although she presents as a sympathetic case, the risk posed by
her mental illness and personality disorder cannot be ignored.
The prognosis was poor to guarded:
Although  her  symptoms  are  generally  mild  and  controllable  with  effort,
they can be magnified to the moderate range, as indicated by the events
of  September  2015  to  December  2015,  especially  if  she  is  in  an
3 Tr. at 22, 50-54, 58, 60; GE 1, 3; AE E.
unfavorable  or  stressful  environment.  Even  with  her  high  level  skills  and
advanced technical education, there is no guarantee that she will not find
herself  in  an  environment  she  does  not  find  favorable.  If  she  does  find
herself  transferred  to such  an  environment  (such  as  where  she  was  with
[defense  project]) the  likelihood  of  relapse  is  very  high.  This likelihood  of
relapse is magnified by her refusal to get treatment or follow through with
recommendations for psychiatric care.
The psychologist opined that Applicant presented an unacceptable security risk.
However, he also emphasized that “no part of this report or recommendations should be
taken to indicate that [Applicant] is not an appropriate and trustworthy employee under
typical  circumstances.”  He  concluded  that  she  “should  be  allowed  to  continue  work  in
her  current  environment  and  there  is  no  indication  that  she  would  not  be  an  effective
and productive employee in a non-classified military or Government environment.”
Applicant believes that she was targeted and monitored by cyber security at her
office,  at  a  conference,  in  her  car,  and  at  home  for  about  four  to  five  months  through
early  2016.  She  would  overhear  co-workers  at  work  discussing  what  she  did  at  home
the  night before.  She submitted evidence, and  I find,  that there  is technology  that  can
monitor her in the way that she described.4
Applicant has not experienced direct evidence of the monitoring since early 2016.
However, in July 2016, she recorded people in her apartment who were supposed to be
pest control. It was suspicious because there are three distinct voices, two females and
a male, on the recording, and an actual pest control person had come by earlier  in the
day.  She  also  indicated  that  the  apartment  complex  had  three  maintenance  workers
who were all male. Applicant played the recording at the hearing, and her description of
the voices is accurate. She did not ask the apartment complex if additional maintenance
workers were in her apartment. Instead, she reported it to the FBI in September 2016.
She never heard anything back from the FBI. She does not know if she has continued to
be  monitored  without  her  knowledge.  She  moved  to  a  house,  which  has  more  privacy
than an apartment.5
Applicant disagrees with the psychological evaluation. She asserted that there is
information in the evaluation that is inaccurate, and she is quoted with statements that
she  never said.  She  is  not  resistant  to  treatment  if  she  felt  it  necessary,  but  she does
not believe it is necessary.6

"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 56-year-old senior designer, who has been employed by a defense
contractor since August 1990. He was granted a confidential-level security clearance in
July 1991, and he has held a secret-level clearance since September 1996. His clearance
was renewed most recently in August 2008. (GE 2; Tr. 44-45.)
Applicant has had several ex-wives and girlfriends. He and his fourth wife remarried
in August 2019. (Tr. 79.) Applicant has an adult daughter from his first marriage and two
adopted adult children from his second marriage. (GEs 2-3, 15-16, 19.)
Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in June 1981 (SOR ¶
2.a). He had consumed 12 beers while driving around. He was fined $50 and ordered to
attend a DWI school. In August 1982, he was charged with public intoxication after sharing
24 beers with a friend (SOR ¶ 2.b). He forfeited a $35 bond for being drunk in public. (GEs
6, 20- 21.)
In April 1988, Applicant and his first wife divorced after three years of marriage,
partially because of his drinking. On May 15, 1988, his ex-wife complained to the police
that he had assaulted her (pushed her, struck her across the face, knocked her to the
ground, and threatened to kill her). The police noticed scratches on her neck and other
signs that she had been assaulted. Two days later, Applicant was arrested and booked into
the county jail on a peace bond complaint of intent to murder his ex-wife (SOR ¶ 2.c). In
the jail, he exhibited signs of polysubstance abuse, and he admitted he had consumed 24
beers before his arrest (SOR ¶ 4.a). He posted a bond of $2,000 on May 23, 1988, and
was released from custody. On June 8, 1988, he pled guilty to assault by contact on his ex-
wife and was fined $200 plus costs. (GEs 6, 21.) Applicant testified at his hearing that his
ex-wife “broke into the house.” (Tr. 62.)
In September 1988, Applicant married his second wife, and one month later, he
enlisted in the U.S. military. On April 22, 1989, he was arrested for breach of peace and
third degree assault after he started a fight with another person at a local motel (SOR ¶
2.d). Applicant was intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol when he was arrested. (GE
7.) During a subject interview with a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) special agent in
May  1989,  Applicant  volunteered  that  he  had  consumed  eight  to  ten  mixed  drinks
containing vodka before the incident and that he was fined $35. He also reported an arrest
in May 1989 for malicious damage (SOR ¶ 2.e). After consuming a gallon of vodka at a
concert,  he  started  an  argument  and  dented  the  hood  of  the  victim’s  vehicle.  He  was
required to pay $200 in restitution and $43 in court fees. (GE 21.)
At  the  request  of  his  military  command,  Applicant  was  evaluated  at  his  base’s
counseling and assistance center on May 22, 1989. He acknowledged responsibility for two
pre-service alcohol-related incidents for which he had a pre-service waiver. He indicated
that he had been drinking regularly since age 16, and that his drinking had doubled while in
the military. He expressed a desire to abstain from alcohol, and reported drinking more
than intended, loss of control, increasing tolerance, and some withdrawal symptoms. The
screener opined that Applicant was “psychologically dependent” on alcohol and that he
was likely to continue to abuse alcohol unless he completed Level III inpatient treatment. It
was  recommended  that  he  attend  a  minimum  of  three  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings  per  week  and  be  placed  on  a  supervised  Antabuse  program  in  the  interim.
Applicant satisfactorily completed a 36-hour alcohol and drug education course on June
23,  1989.  On  June  29,  1989,  he  was  processed  for  disqualification  from  his  military
program because of his alcohol problem and was advised that failure to complete the Level
III drug and alcohol abuse program would be grounds for his separation from the military.
(GE 5.)
On his admission to the Level III program in July 1989, Applicant was diagnosed
with substance abuse disorder (SOR ¶ 4.b). He reported a significant increase in tolerance
since January 1989. He was admitted to a structured program of group therapy, individual
counseling, and education with a strong AA component. He was cautious at first but was
later able to identify factors impacting his alcohol use and to initiate actions to address his
problem. He was active in developing his aftercare plan, which included meeting with his
command’s drug and alcohol program advisor on a weekly basis for one year; participating
in a 12-step program; submitting to urinalysis screening at least four times per month for
one year; and attending a formal aftercare group two hours a week for 12 weeks. He was
returned to active duty in August 1989 with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. (GE 5.)
Applicant and his second wife divorced in early November 1989. (GEs 1-2.) On
November 9, 1989, Applicant was evaluated by a military clinical psychologist because of
suicidal ideation. He reported abstinence from alcohol since August 1989 with the help of
nightly AA meetings, but admitted that he had started thinking about suicide about two
months prior. He exhibited a depressed mood with a constricted affect. He was diagnosed
with alcohol dependence (alcoholism) in remission, and avoidant personality traits, but
found fit for full duty. He was advised to obtain an AA sponsor and to receive group and
individual  therapy  through  the  command’s  psychiatry  department.  In  December  1989,
Applicant  was  dis-enrolled  from  his  weekly  aftercare  group  for  failing  to  show  for  a
scheduled session for the second time. (GE 5.) Applicant was discharged from his military
service obligation in March 1990. (GE 1.)
Applicant was married to his third wife from June 1992 to October 1995. (GEs 1-2.)
There is no evidence that he had any legal or substance abuse problems during that time.
In December 1995, Applicant was arrested for threatening, breach of peace, bigotry, and
assault  on  a  police  officer  (SOR  ¶  2.f).  (GE  8.)  No  details  are  in  evidence  about  the
offense.
Applicant  and  his  fourth  wife  married  in  June  1997,  but  they  separated  around
October 2000 or 2001 and were divorced in approximately 2006. (GEs 1, 22.) In February
2005,  he  was  arrested  for  his  own  safety  following  an  incident  involving  a  girlfriend.
Applicant appeared to be suicidal. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital (SOR ¶ 1.b),
where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He indicated during a June 2006 interview
with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he spent four days in the
hospital (GE 22), although he reported to a clinical provider in 2012 that he was in the
hospitalized for two weeks in 2005. (GE 17.) Applicant was charged with possession of a
loaded handgun and domestic violence for the incident involving his girlfriend (SOR ¶ 2.g),
but the charges were nolle prossed in March 2005. (GEs 3, 22.)
While on a temporary work assignment for his current employer in approximately
July 2005, a co-worker told Applicant that he should try marijuana to relax.  Applicant took
one or two puffs from a marijuana cigarette offered him by the co-worker. From November
2005 to 2006, Applicant used marijuana with the son of his current spouse. Applicant liked
the effect, but did not use any marijuana for the next three years. (GE 22.)
To renew his security clearance, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National
Security Positions (SF 86) on December 5, 2005. He indicated that he had consulted with a
mental  health  professional  from  February  2005  to  June  2005,  and  that  he  had  been
arrested in February 2005 for possession of a loaded handgun and domestic violence for
which  he  had  to  complete  violence  education  classes.  He  responded  negatively  to  an
inquiry concerning whether he had illegally used any controlled substance in the last seven
years (SOR ¶ 5.b). (GE 1.) When he answered the SOR, Applicant denied falsifying his SF
86, stating that he had not used marijuana in the seven years preceding the application.
After it was pointed out to Applicant at his hearing that his reported use of marijuana in July
2005 predated his December 2005 SF 86, Applicant explained that he “was thinking it was
backwards,” i.e., that his drug use occurred after he completed his SF 86. (Tr. 70.)
From 2009 to the spring of 2015, Applicant used marijuana with acquaintances he
met  while  playing  disc  golf.  Between  the  spring  of  2015  and  February  2016,  he  used
marijuana  with  his  wife’s  son  on  four  occasions.  Applicant  was  usually  provided  the
marijuana that he used, but a few times he contributed money towards its cost. (GE 22.)
In January 2012, Applicant began taking several psychiatric medications prescribed
for him by his primary care physician. On October 19, 2012, Applicant sought treatment
from  a  behavioral  health  service,  complaining  of  anxiety  and  depression.  He  reported
sobriety from alcohol for the past 23 years. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and
referred for treatment at a psychiatric hospital. (GE 19; Tr. 50-51.)  Applicant was formally
discharged from the behavioral health service on January 3, 2013, for failure to attend any
sessions beyond the initial assessment. (GE 20.)
Applicant began treatment at the psychiatric hospital on November 12, 2012, four
days after the death of his sister (SOR ¶ 1.b). He reported a history of depression with
outbursts  of  anger  and  deterioration  of  his  condition  for  about  a  year.  He  denied  any
drinking  since  1989,  but  admitted  experiencing  suicidal  ideation  daily.  Applicant  was
treated for four days in the facility’s partial hospitalization program (PHP) and twelve days
in its intensive outpatient program (IOP). Random screens were negative for alcohol (he
reported attending AA) but positive for marijuana (SOR ¶ 3.b). After acknowledging that he
needed to stop seeing his friends who use marijuana, he reported a relapse of marijuana
use  on  December  19,  2012.  At  his  discharge  on  December  21,  2012,  Applicant  was
diagnosed on Axis I with bipolar I disorder – severe without psychotic feat – depressed;
PTSD;  cannabis  abuse  –  unspecified;  ADHD  not  otherwise  specified;  and  alcohol
dependence  in  sustained  full  remission.  He  was  diagnosed  on  Axis  II  with  antisocial
personality disorder. At discharge, Applicant was assessed at low risk for harm to self or
others.  Aftercare  plans  included  follow-up  with  the  behavioral  health  service  and
pharmacological management. (GE 17.) There is no evidence that he engaged in aftercare
treatment at that time other than medication management by his primary care doctor.
On  January  13,  2014,  Applicant  sought  treatment  in  a  hospital’s  emergency
department for depression and thoughts of suicide. He was discharged to follow up in the
hospital’s PHP, where he received treatment from January 16, 2014, to March 7, 2014, for
his diagnosed bipolar disorder I, PTSD, and attention deficit disorder (ADD). He reported
on admission to the PHP that he had been using marijuana for eight years, although not
within the past ten days. His attendance in the program was sporadic, but he reported no
use of marijuana while in the program. On his discharge, he was given a good prognosis
provided he followed up with recommended counseling. (GE 15.)
On March 20, 2014, he began psychotherapy three times a week with a licensed
clinical social worker (LCSW), who diagnosed him on Axis I with major depressive affective
disorder  –  recurrent  episode,  moderate  degree;  PTSD;  and  alcohol  dependence  in
remission. Applicant told the LCSW he was not using any marijuana and had abstained
from alcohol for the last 25 years. (GE 14.)
Applicant had developed a close relationship with a girlfriend’s grandson. After their
relationship ended, his ex-girlfriend threatened to prevent him from seeing her grandson.
Applicant  reacted  by  attempting  suicide,  overdosing on his prescription Xanax and his
insulin drug on April 1, 2014. (Tr. 52-53.) He was administered Narcan at the emergency
room of a local hospital, where he became very agitated, tried to hit emergency room staff
and hospital security, and threatened to kill one of the security officers. (GEs 3, 10, 13, 22.)
He tested positive for benzodiazepine, amphetamines, cannabis, and opiates, and was
admitted to the intensive care unit, where he continued to express threats toward his ex-
girlfriend. He was diagnosed with multiple drug overdose, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, and
transferred on April 3, 2014, to the hospital’s inpatient psychiatric unit on an involuntary
legal status (SOR ¶ 1.b). He had good behavioral control on the unit and explained that he
overdosed as a test of his ex-girlfriend’s love, i.e., would she obtain medical attention for
him.  On  April 7,  2014,  Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  hospital with  a  diagnosis of
bipolar disorder – recurrent, severe, mixed with psychosis, to follow up with his outpatient
counseling and medication management. (GE 13.)
While Applicant was in the hospital, his ex-girlfriend served him with a restraining
order. After his discharge, Applicant relapsed on alcohol and marijuana for a couple of
days because he was depressed. He started texting and leaving voice messages on his ex-
girlfriend’s cellular phone and drove by her house. On April 12, 2014, he was arrested for
violating the protective order. (GEs 9, 12, 14, 22.) On April 15, 2014, Applicant was treated
in a hospital emergency room after state police, in responding to a welfare check, found
Applicant in an agitated and belligerent state. He had called his supervisor and expressed
a  threat  of  suicide.  A  urine  screen  was  positive  for  cannabinoids.    Applicant  was
discharged  from  the  emergency  room  after  declining  treatment,  but  he  continued  his
outpatient counseling with the LCSW. (GEs 14-15, 22.)
On May 2, 2014, Applicant had an argument with his current spouse (then fourth ex-
wife) over Applicant’s ex-girlfriend taking “his grandson” from him. Applicant’s spouse told
the police Applicant had pulled her hair, but he had not assaulted her. A witness stated that
Applicant had pinned his spouse to the ground. Applicant was arrested and charged with
disorderly conduct (SOR ¶ 2.j). (GEs 11-12, 22.) On February 10, 2015, the disorderly
conduct  charge  was  nolle  prossed.  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  violating  a  condition  of  his
release  for  violating  the  protective  order  obtained  by  his  ex-girlfriend,  and  he  was
sentenced to one year in jail (execution suspended), and two years of probation. (GE 12.)
He was also required to attend 26 weeks of anger management classes, which he began in
June 2015. (GE 18.)
An  arrest  warrant  was  issued for Applicant for breach of peace because of his
combative and threatening behavior in the hospital emergency room on April 1, 2014 (SOR
¶ 2.h). Applicant turned himself in to the police when he learned of the warrant on May 8,
2014. He was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail, execution suspended, and
placed on probation for two years. (GEs 10-12.)
The incidents of April and May 2014 occurred despite counseling and medication
management.  (GEs  14, 22.) On July 3, 2014, Applicant entered a PHP where he was
treated for bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation. He expressed on admission that he had
some auditory hallucinations. His anti-depressant medication was adjusted with positive
effect, and he was “stepped down” to the hospital’s intensive outpatient program on July
21, 2014. He was discharged on August 6, 2014, to aftercare counseling with his therapist
three  times  per  week,  and  medication  management  by  his  physician.  Applicant  was
clinically stable, and his prognosis was assessed as good as he was able to recognize his
triggers and his unhealthy behaviors. (GE 15.)
Applicant resumed his psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW on August 8, 2014.
His mood remained stable for the most part, although he was tearful over the loss of his
relationship  with  his ex-girlfriend’s grandson.  As  of  November 26,  2014,  he  was  using
marijuana occasionally as a sleep aid against the clinical advice of his therapist. (GE 14.)
Applicant reported his recent psychiatric treatment and his psychotherapy with the
LCSW on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) completed on February
13,  2015.  He  also  indicated  that  he  was  on  probation  for  two  years  for  violating  the
conditions of his release and for breach of peace. He falsely responded “No” to whether he
had used any illegal drug in the last seven years. He admits that he lied on his SF 86. (GE
1; Tr. 70.)
As of March 2015, Applicant was attending psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW
once a week. He had demonstrated increased insight and ability to make decisions in his
best interest. Inconsistent compliance with his medications and distress over being denied
a  promotion  at  work  led  to  an  increase  in  his  depression  in  July  2015,  although  his
condition improved once he took his medications as prescribed. Applicant married his fifth
wife  in  September  2015,  but  she  left  him  in  October  2015.  Applicant’s  mental  health
deteriorated after the breakup, and he missed two weeks of work because of his mental
state. He presented for a session with his treating LCSW in a decompensated state in late
October 2015. At the LCSW’s recommendation, Applicant was taken by his son to a local
hospital. (GEs 14, 22.)
Applicant received treatment the hospital from October 26 – 27, 2015, for diagnosed
bipolar disorder – most recent episode depressed; cannabis use disorder – moderate; and
alcohol use disorder in full remission. He tested positive for amphetamines and cannabis,
and admitted that he had used cannabis on 15 out of the last 30 days. He was transferred
from the emergency room to a psychiatric unit, where he was discharged at his request, to
obtain treatment elsewhere. He was advised to avoid alcohol and illegal drugs. (GEs 16,
22.)
On November 4, 2015, Applicant was assessed for treatment by a behavioral health
service. He had experienced multiple losses over the previous two years, to include the
suicide of a nephew. Applicant reported no current suicidal ideation, and no alcohol use for
the past 25 years. He admitted that he had used marijuana on October 21, 2015, but none
otherwise in the last 30 days. Applicant was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder – current or
most recent episode depressed, severe; and with PTSD. On November 9, 2015, Applicant
was admitted to a PHP five days per week. He was reminded of the risks of using alcohol
or illegal drugs and the risk of combining alcohol or other substances with his prescription
medications.  He  was  an  active  participant  in  group  therapy,  and  reported  regular
attendance at AA with no drinking. He was discharged in January 2016, having completed
the PHP and an IOP, to follow up with his therapist. (GE 18.) The last available progress
note of his treatment with the LCSW is dated February 23, 2016, although that progress
note does not reflect that he was discharged. (GE 14.) Applicant recalls having sessions
with  the  LCSW  in  2017  and  in  2018.  (Tr.  55.)  Of  all  his  treatments,  he  considers  his
sessions with the LCSW to have been the most beneficial for him. (Tr. 66.)
Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) on February 22, 2016. He detailed his involvement with marijuana,
including  on  four  occasions  since  the  spring  of  2015.  He  admitted  knowing  that  using
marijuana was not allowed because of his security clearance. His recent drug involvement
had been with his current wife’s son, and he contributed funds to pay for the drug two or
three times. Applicant added that he would never use marijuana at work. He expressed an
intention to continue using marijuana on his personal time because it helps him to cope. He
claimed his co-workers, family, and friends know about his marijuana use and denied it
could be a source of blackmail. (GE 22.)
On September 11, 2016, Applicant was arrested for felony unlawful restraint in the
first degree following a domestic violence incident involving an ex-girlfriend. (GE 3.) His ex-
girlfriend, who wanted to get drunk with him, bought a bottle of whiskey. After getting “very
wasted” with her, he tried to choke her during an argument. (GE 4; Tr. 71-72.) The offense
was in violation of his probation for the April 2014 protective order violation. On November
1, 2017, he was sentenced  to three years in jail, execution suspended, and placed on
probation  for  three  years.  (GE  9.)  Applicant  was  also  required  to  attend  a  six-month
domestic  violence  program,  which  he  completed.  (Tr.  72-73.)  He  testified  that  his  ex-
girlfriend indicated that she would write a positive letter to the court to end his probation
early  in  2019.  (Tr.  73.)  He  presented  no  record  showing  that  his  probation  has  been
terminated.
At  the  request  of  the  DOD,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed  clinical
psychologist on May 6, 2018. He reported to the psychologist that he had been attending
anger management classes twice per week since January 2018. He explained that he had
stopped his psychotherapy with the LCSW at the latter’s request. He claimed without any
corroboration that the LCSW told him he was on the cusp of recovery and his coping skills
were good, although he then admitted that he got bored with the therapy and had no plans
to resume it. He was taking medications prescribed by his primary care physician, and he
expressed an intention to continue taking them for his mental stability. Applicant described
current symptoms of low esteem, sadness, attention and concentration issues, and missing
his ex-girlfriend’s grandson. He reported a supportive relationship with his fourth ex-wife
(spouse  as  of  August  2019).  He  denied  any  episodes  of  mania  since  2014.  When
discussing his past treatments, Applicant generally indicated that they were beneficial.
Regarding substance abuse, he stated that he had been abstinent from alcohol from May
1989  to  September  2016,  when  he  relapsed  for  one  day.  He  stated  that  he  was  not
currently using any illegal drugs, and while he had used marijuana occasionally to help him
calm down from approximately 2005 through 2014, he only used it with friends at parties.
He acknowledged knowing that he was not supposed to use marijuana while holding a
security clearance. Applicant also admitted that he was currently on probation after he
choked an ex-girlfriend. (GE 4.)
During the evaluation, Applicant appeared guarded when discussing clinical issues;
demonstrated loss associations; and needed repeated, direct, and specific questions to
disclose information that did not portray him in a positive manner. He was not involved in
any psychotherapy. In the opinion of the psychologist, Applicant’s judgment and reliability
appeared  poor,  and  his  insight  appeared  fair.  He  diagnosed  Applicant  with  bipolar  I
disorder  –  unspecified,  ADHD  –  combined  presentation;  and  borderline  personality
disorder.  Applicant  did  not  report  any  current  PTSD  symptoms  or  substance  abuse,
although the psychologist opined that Applicant likely met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis
as  well.  He  found  it  concerning  that  Applicant  had  used  marijuana  while  holding  a
clearance and indicated that he would be very concerned if Applicant resumed drinking. He
assessed  Applicant’s  prognosis as guarded and opined that  the bipolar I disorder and
10
borderline personality disorder are conditions that negatively impact Applicant’s reliability,
judgment,  stability,  and  trustworthiness.  If  Applicant  became  noncompliant  with  his
medications,  it  would  have a significant negative impact on his reliability, stability, and
judgment. The psychologist considered Applicant’s disengagement from his psychotherapy
to be ill-advised. Applicant’s longtime employment since 1990, his dedication to his job,
and  the  fact  that  Applicant  felt  much  better  than  in  the  past,  were  favorable  issues
warranting consideration in the opinion of the psychologist. (GE 4.)
Applicant testified that he obtained a medical marijuana card in January 2017. (Tr.
64.) He denies any use of marijuana since his last use sometime during the spring of 2019.
(Tr.  67.)  He  explained  that  he  had  used  marijuana  in  the  past  when  he  “was  in  total
breakdown.” (Tr. 63-64, 67-68.) He admitted that he lied on his February 2015 SF 86 form
by denying that he used any illegal drug in the last seven years. (Tr. 70.) He knew that
marijuana use was not allowed while he held a DOD clearance. (Tr. 67.) Applicant does not
currently attend AA. He denies any current consumption of alcohol and any intention to
drink in the future. (Tr. 73.) He realizes that drinking any alcohol will not help him because
he loses control when he drinks. (Tr. 74.)
Applicant is grateful to the DOD for granting him the privilege of having a clearance,
which has allowed him to continue his work over the years. He does not believe that he has
worked on any classified projects. Some of his co-workers do not have security clearances.
Applicant believes he has done his job well. He is passionate about his work and has had
no trouble focusing on his work. (Tr. 46-49.) He continues to struggle on a daily basis with
controlling  his  emotions.  (Tr.  54.)  He  is  currently  prescribed  Lamictal  (for  his  bipolar
disorder),  Adderall,  and  a  new  anti-depressant.  He  does  not  always  take  the  Adderall
because it impairs his ability to sleep, and he does not think the Lamictal is helping him.
(Tr. 56-57.) He sought counseling for anxiety and depression through his EAP in late spring
2019, and he was referred to a local psychiatric hospital where they wanted to admit him to
an inpatient substance abuse treatment program. He was using marijuana at that time,
although he denies he was drinking alcohol. He did not pursue treatment because he did
not want to take more time away from his work. (Tr. 58-59.) Applicant testified that he is
“holding  it  together,”  and  learning  to  not  allow  his  emotions  to  get  the  better  of  his
judgment. (Tr. 59-60.)
Applicant’s current spouse has known Applicant for over 25 years. She testified that
he has stopped drinking; that they have no alcohol in their house; and that they do not go
to bars or to alcohol stores. She has not seen him with any alcohol since September 2016.
(Tr. 76-78.) She is aware that he obtained a medical marijuana card in 2017 and that he
last used marijuana in the spring of 2019 when “he was having an episode.” (Tr. 81-82.) To
her knowledge, Applicant “only uses it when he has an issue.” She does not know how
Applicant obtained the marijuana that he used earlier this year. (Tr. 82.) In all the years that
she has known him, Applicant has not talked about his work with her. (Tr. 83-84.)
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  2004  to  August  2015  attests  that  Applicant
demonstrated a high level of proficiency working on very complex products. This former
supervisor never witnessed Applicant intoxicated or impaired at their workplace. Applicant
11
always put full effort into his duties and cared about his work. The supervisor knows of “no
professional reason” why Applicant should lose his security clearance. (AE A.)
A co-worker of Applicant’s for the last 15 years, who has become a close friend,
indicated that he understands the concerns, but he trusts Applicant with his life. In his
experience,  Applicant  has  been  committed  to  providing  a  quality  product  for  the  U.S.
military. As a friend, Applicant has been reliable, consistent, and trustworthy. (AE B.)
Applicant’s supervisor since 2014 has known Applicant since 2001. They graduated
from  apprenticeship  school  together  and  worked  on  the  same  crew  on  and  off.  This
supervisor indicated that he has not witnessed or suspected Applicant of coming to work
under the influence of any substance. He vouched for Applicant’s integrity as a trusted
employee and patriot. Applicant continues to be a “valuable and necessary asset to [his]
crew.” (AE C.)
",False
"Applicant is a 30-year-old man. He graduated from college in 2012, majoring in
history. (GE 2 at 2) He and his wife married the year he finished college. Since 2016, he
has  been  working  for  a  defense  contractor  as  a  test  engineer.  Specifically,  he  tests
software to ascertain whether it is functioning properly. (Tr. 15)
Applicant has been struggling with depression and anxiety since 2008 when he was
in high school. (Tr. 18) For the first few years that he experienced these symptoms, he did
not seek treatment because he thought his symptoms were part of his “normal . . . day-to-
day” life. (Tr. 19) By 2013, he began to suspect that his depressed and anxious feelings
had  a  clinical  dimension.  Consequently,  he  consulted  a  therapist  and  began  receiving
treatment.
Applicant saw the therapist three times that year, then stopped because he could
not afford the treatment.  (Tr. 20) In 2013, Applicant’s wife became seriously ill. At or about
this time, Applicant’s symptoms worsened. In February 2014, he attempted to hang himself
in his closet, surviving only after the closet bar to which he had tied the make-shift noose
could not support his weight and broke. (GE 2 at 3; GE 4 at 53)
At Applicant’s wife’s prompting, he began seeing a psychiatrist. (GE 4 at 53) He
received treatment from the psychiatrist approximately once per week for two months until
he relocated with his wife to another state. In July 2014, after relocating, Applicant met with
a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with depression and anxiety. The doctor prescribed him
antidepressants  and  anti-anxiety  medications,  and  recommended  that  he  attend
psychotherapy. (GE 3 at 8; Tr. 19)
Applicant’s symptoms continued to worsen. One day in early December 2014, while
driving a school bus (his job at the time), Applicant wet his pants. Embarrassed and angry
with himself, Applicant returned home after finishing his route, and took a shower. While in
the shower, he began to have suicidal thoughts. (Tr. 33) He called his psychiatrist who told
him to go to the hospital as soon as Applicant’s wife returned home. Applicant followed his
psychiatrist’s advice.
While at the hospital, Applicant was evaluated and diagnosed with major depressive
disorder. Subsequently, he was admitted, staying in the hospital for four days. (Tr. 34)
Upon discharge, Applicant was prescribed another medication to supplement the ones that
he had already been taking. (Tr. 28)
Applicant continued to receive treatment from his psychiatrist approximately three to
four times between the date of his discharge and his psychiatrist’s retirement in 2015. (Tr.
29, 34) During this time, he also met regularly with his pastor. (Tr. 30)
In January 2016, Applicant began seeing psychiatrists through a practice affiliated
with his current insurance company. (AE H) There was an approximate three-month gap in
treatment from the time Applicant’s previous psychiatrist retired and the time Applicant
began receiving treatment from the practice that is currently serving him. (Tr. 36) According
to  Applicant’s  psychiatrist,  he  does not currently have any psychiatric or psychological
conditions that impair his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. (AE H at 2)
Applicant excels on the job, succeeding in a highly stressful environment. (GEs G,
I - K) He has an extensive network of friends through his church where he serves as a
worship leader, the top elected position for a layperson. (AE E at 2) Applicant continues to
meet with his pastor approximately once per month for counseling. (AE C) Per the pastor,
Applicant is dependable and reliable, and has consistently demonstrated trustworthiness
and stability. (AE C)
One of Applicant’s friends from church is a retired military officer with significant
experience working with subordinates struggling with mental health issues. (AE D at 2) Per
the  retired  officer,  Applicant  was  forthcoming  with  the  church  about  his  mental  health
problems, and has the “special trust and confidence” of the pastor. (AE D at 2) In sum, he
expressed absolute confidence in Applicant’s trustworthiness and reliability. (AE D at 2)
",True
"SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  was  “diagnosed  with  possible  Psychosis,  possible
Bipolar Disorder, and possible Borderline or Antisocial Personality Disorder based in part
on [her] history of high-risk behaviors, including assuming other people’s identities, self-
harm, thoughts of harming others, and taking out a $20,000 loan in your mother’s name
without her permission.”
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  in  December  2018,  a  licensed  psychologist  “diagnosed
[Applicant]  with  Other  Specified  Personality  Disorder  (mixed  personality  features)  and
Generalized Anxiety Disorder.”
In Applicant’s SOR response, she denied SOR ¶ 1.a and admitted SOR ¶ 1.b. (HE
3) She also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are
accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is 34 years old, and she is a senior consultant and program management
office software development team lead. (Tr. 6, 29; GE 1) In 2002, she graduated from
high school. (Tr. 6) In 2012, she received a bachelor’s degree with a major in political
science with a focus in international affairs. (Tr. 6-7, 28) In 2019, she received a master’s
degree in international security. (Tr. 6-7) She has never married, and she does not have
any children. (Tr. 7) Her parents divorced when she was six years old. (Tr. 76) She has
no siblings; however, she is close to her stepbrother. (Tr. 77) She has not served in the
U.S. armed forces. (Tr. 7)
Psychological Conditions
When Applicant was 10 years old, she received treatment for autism-related issues
because she had anxiety and difficulty reading social cues. (Tr. 31) From age 10 to 12,
she did not receive treatment, and then treatment resumed when she was 13, stopped
when she was 14, and resumed again when she was 15. (Tr. 32) She was occasionally
prescribed antidepressants. (Tr. 32)
When Applicant was 16 years old, her 20-year-old team lead during an internship
sexually assaulted her. (Tr. 33, 39, 59-62; AE J at 2-3) Applicant described it as a “date
rape.” (Tr. 61) She made a police report about the assault about four years later; however,
he  was  never  charged.  (Tr.  61)  She  received  mental-health  treatment  for  about  six
months. (Tr. 33, 62)
Dr. K’s Treatment and Notes
Dr. K’s treatment notes are a combination of brief handwritten notes and checklists.
(GE 4) The notes are a series of conclusions with few supporting details or facts about
Applicant’s past conduct and behavior. (GE 4)
During therapy after the sexual  assault occurring about 18 years ago, Applicant
wondered whether she had been previously sexually assaulted by her father or someone
else. (Tr. 39) She had some flashes or dreams about being sexually assaulted. (Tr. 40)
She was confident that her father had not sexually assaulted her. (Tr. 40) She regretted
telling Dr. K years later about her previous suspicions about her father sexually molesting
her. (Tr. 40-41) She was able to rule out the possibility that her father sexually assaulted
her. (Tr. 41) She believed a babysitter may have sexually assaulted her when she was
about  three  years  old  based  on  “vague  impressions.”  (Tr.  41)  Applicant’s  mother
described the sexual assault in her statement. (AE J at 3)
In  December  2012  and  January  2013,  Applicant  sought  and  received  treatment
from  Dr.  K  because  she  was  upset,  embarrassed,  and  ashamed  about  having  an  18-
month affair with an older, married coworker. (Tr. 22, 34, 36, 62-65) It was against her
employer’s informal unofficial rules; however, she denied that she engaged in the affair
to  obtain  any  professional  advantage.  (Tr.  22,  64-65;  AE  J  at  4)  She  ended  the  affair
because she knew it was morally wrong and they were “lying to everybody.” (Tr. 62) She
may have exaggerated her faults in the way she described her behavior to Dr. K because
she wanted accountability. (Tr. 22, 24, 67; AE J at 1) She was highly anxious, and she
wanted  Dr.  K  to  take  her  concerns  seriously.  (Tr.  22-23)  She  wanted  him  to  help  her
address the underlying cause of her bad decisions. (Tr. 23, 34-35, 67) She met with Dr.
K six times, and then he retired. (Tr. 23, 45) Her treatment was transferred to Dr. M, and
she saw him once or twice, and then she stopped seeking counseling. (Tr. 23, 45-46)
Dr. K’s treatment notes indicate “‘when I script or pattern after others’ boyfriend in
martial arts, tried to appear as martial artist.” (GE 4 at 1) His notes indicate she assumed
the identities of other people and portrayed different personalities. (GE 4 at 1) However,
Dr. K did not explain how she said she manifested these behaviors other than his note
about Applicant’s involvement in martial arts. He does indicate Applicant explained that
sometimes she adopted mannerisms of friends; however, she denied that she assumed
their identities. (Tr. 68) She was in a two-year relationship with a man who showed her
some martial arts. (Tr. 68) He complimented her athletic ability in martial arts, and she
told Dr. K that she was good in martial arts. (Tr. 69) This was an exaggeration because
she did not have any formal training in martial arts. (Tr. 69) She denied that she has ever
lied about her name, occupation, or educational background. (Tr. 69) Dr. K said she was
a  “pathological  liar”  and  “made  up  stories”  (GE  4  at  1);  however,  he  did  not  give  an
example or provide a basis for these conclusions.
Applicant  experimented  with  cutting  herself  when  she  was  19  or  20  years  old;
however, the cutting was slight and so insignificant that she did not bleed. (Tr. 70) She
tried it because some of her friends were doing it. (Tr. 70) Dr. K described her admission
of self-harm or cutting.  Applicant’s mother denied that Applicant engaged in self-harm.
(AE J at 3) He also indicated she engaged in other high-risk behaviors including assuming
other’s identities, homicidal ideation, taking out a loan in her mother’s name, and noted
his diagnosis of possible Psychosis, possible Bipolar Disorder, and possible Borderline
or Antisocial Personality Disorder.
Dr. K indicated in his medical records that Applicant forged her mother’s signature
on a $20,000 student loan application. (Tr. 51) Applicant said she signed her mother’s
name on the application for a $7,000 student loan  because her mother was out of the
country. (Tr. 51; SOR response) Applicant’s mother corroborated Applicant’s statement
about  the  circumstances  of  Applicant  signing  her  mother’s  name.  (AE  J  at  2)  When
Applicant’s  mother  returned,  Applicant  told  her  that  she  signed  her  name  on  the
application. (Tr. 52) Her mother asked her not to sign her name without informing her first.
(Tr. 52) Applicant repaid the student loan. (Tr. 51; AE J at 2) Applicant never intended to
commit theft or deceive her mother about the loan. (Tr. 53)
Dr.  K  said  Applicant  disclosed  that  she  shoplifted  a  necklace  when  she  was  in
college. Applicant admitted the theft to her mother. (AE J at 2)
Dr.  K  advised  her  that  she  needed  medication  to  calm  her  and  slow  her  racing
thoughts,  and  not  to  address  bipolar  disorder.  (Tr.  24)  Dr.  K  said  he  was  not  going  to
formally diagnose Applicant. (Tr. 37) “He said that the medication would help [her with]
anxiety and the rapid cycling of things.” (Tr. 39) She took the medication as directed but
gradually reduced the dosage. (Tr. 25) On December 12, 2012, Dr. K completed “history”
and a checklist of Applicant’s mental health. (GE 4 at 1-7) Dr. K wrote rule out Bipolar
and  rule  out  Borderline  or  other  personality  disorder  i.e.  antisocial  during  his  intake
“impression.”  (GE 4 at  7) He  repeated  these  impressions  on  December  27, 2012, and
added Psychosis Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). (GE 4 at 8) On January 8, 2013, Dr. K
and Applicant discussed her relationship with a married man at work, and Dr. K said “she
had  [an]  affair  to  gain  advantage  in  workplace”  and  for  “impression”  he  wrote  simply
“Psychosis NOS.” (GE 4 at 9) On January 15, 2013, Dr. K wrote about Applicant’s desire
to  appear  attractive  and  desirable,  and  under  “impression”  he  again  wrote  “Psychosis
NOS.” (GE 4 at 10) On January 22, 2013, Dr. K discussed Applicant’s relationship with
her mother and described Applicant as emotionally needy, and highly disorganized, and
his “impression” was again “Psychosis NOS” and “Borderline” personality disorder. (GE
4 at 11) Dr. K did not provide his final conclusions or diagnosis.
Applicant received prescriptions from Dr. K, Dr. M, and general practitioners  for
Seroquel, and it helped because it slowed her racing thoughts and reduced her anxiety.
(Tr. 42-44, 46) However, it was “pretty flattening” and “blunted” her reactions to others.
(Tr.  42)  Applicant  was  aware  that  Seroquel  “is  used  to  treat  certain  mental/mood
conditions  (such  as  schizophrenia,  bipolar  disorder,  sudden  episodes  of  mania  or
depression associated with bipolar disorder).” (Tr. 43-44; See also “Seroquel” webpage,
WebMD  website,  https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-4718/seroquel-oral/details)  Dr.
K  told  her  that  he  was  prescribing  Seroquel  to  help  her  with  anxiety  and  to  slow  her
emotions, and he never told her it was for the serious mental illnesses such as bipolar
disorder. (Tr. 44) Around March of 2018, she stopped taking Seroquel. (Tr. 44-45)
Evaluation of Dr. B
In  December  2018,  Dr.  B,  a  psychologist,  reviewed  Applicant’s  medical  and
security  records,  conducted  a  Personality  Assessment  Inventory  (PAI)  test,  and
interviewed Applicant and her mother. (GE 2) Dr. B did not provide therapy or counseling
to Applicant. Dr. B said:
neuropsychiatric notes from [Dr. K in] 2012 show that she has a history of:
“pathological  lying,  being  manipulative,  making  up  stories,  assuming
identities of others, portraying different personalities, telling people she was
a rape victim (accusing her father), telling people she had PTSD, trying to
prove she was gay . . . sleeping with others’ spouses to gain advantage in
the  workplace  .  .  .    preoccupation  with  image  and  needing  to  appear
attractive,  rapidly  developing  fantasy  personas  .  .  .  thoughts  of  harming
others and self-harm.” (GE 2 at 3-4)
When Dr. B called Applicant’s mother, her mother said the loan Applicant applied
for was for $500. (GE 2 at 4)
During Dr. B’s interview of Applicant, Dr. B described Applicant in generally normal
and  positive  terms.  However, Dr.  B  said,  “Her insight,  judgment,  and memory  seemed
poor, and many of her recollections seemed vague.” (GE 2 at 5) For example, Applicant
denied past self-harm and homicidal ideation. Applicant’s guardedness was attributed to
“a combination of denial, concealment, and intentional lack of full candor.” (GE 2 at 5)
When  Dr.  B  interviewed Applicant,  she denied any  history  of  self-harm.  (Tr. 70)
She did not disclose that she told Dr. K about cutting herself. (Tr. 34, 70) She believed
Dr.  B’s  question  about  self-harm  was  more  focused  on  whether  she  was  currently
considering self-harm than on her conduct more than 10 years ago. (Tr. 70) She denied
having any thoughts of self-injury or to harm others. (Tr. 70-71) Applicant has never been
a mental health inpatient. (Tr. 71)
Applicant  denied  that  she  was  a  “pathological  liar,”  and  she  denied  that  she
admitted to Dr. K that she was a pathological liar. (Tr. 39) She denied that she assumed
the identity of another. (Tr. 39) Dr. B noted that based on Applicant’s self-report and her
PAI, which she described as “valid,” “it would seem she was grappling with mild anxiety.”
(GE 2 at 7) However, Dr. B concluded because of background information, her clinical
interview, and observations and PAI “she may meet criteria for a personality disorder.”
(GE 2 at 7)
Dr.  B  concluded  that  Applicant’s  “behavioral  health  history  suggests  numerous
behaviors that cast doubt on her judgment, reliability and/or trustworthiness; as such, it
may  be  imprudent  to  grant  her  access  to  classified  information.  Based  on  previous
medical opinions and current diagnoses, she presents with conditions that could pose a
significant risk to national security.” (GE 2 at 8)
Dr.  Y’s Evaluation and Treatment
After  Dr.  M’s  sessions,  Applicant  did  not  see  a  psychologist  or psychiatrist  until
December 2018. (Tr. 47-48) Documentation from Dr. M’s sessions is not included in the
file.  (GE  4)  She  frequently  attended  church  and  she  received  some  spiritual  guidance
between 2013 and 2018. (Tr. 47-48) She resumed treatment with Dr. Y, a psychologist,
in December 2018 to help her with relationships. (Tr. 49-50) She had 23 appointments
with Dr. Y from December 2018 to July 2019. (Tr. 50; AE G)
Dr. Y said he had read and assessed the reports by Dr. K and Dr. B, provided to
Applicant  in  relation  to  her  clearance  hearing.  Dr.  Y  described  Applicant’s  mental
condition as follows:
[S]he has a custom of seeking professional counseling, which comes from
her  family  culture  which  views  mental  health  similarly  to  physical  health.
to  personal  growth,  mental  health  and  strong
[Her]  commitment
relationships leads her to a healthy pattern of counseling and other healthy
behaviors.  I  have  worked  with  [her]  weekly  since  December of  2018  and
have found her to be responsible, candid, and discerning. I recommend her
for clearance at the Secret level.
[She]  voluntarily  began  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  sessions  with  me  in
December 2018, and she has seen me regularly about once per week since
then.  My  overall  assessment  of  [her]  is  that  she  is  a  woman  who  is
voluntarily  and  earnestly  seeking  to  improve  on  a  few  primitive  defense
mechanisms  that  impact  her  immediate,  primary  relationships  (e.g.,  her
mother, a past serious boyfriend). She is consistently clear, alert, aware and
coherent;  she  is  successful  professionally  and  academically,  builds  and
maintains  positive  relationships  with  colleagues,  supervisors,  clients,
friends and acquaintances. Her home life has been consistent and stable
for  nearly  seven  years.  She  is  dedicated  to  and  motivated  by  issues  of
national  security  and  is  a  strong  patriot;  she  is  intelligent,  sensitive  to
information sharing violations, and a sensible professional. It is my view of
[Applicant] that:
  She is aware of her shortcomings and faults and earnest in her desire
and attempts at improving[.]
  She  does  not  display  or  report  criminal,  harmful,  violent  or  erratic
thoughts or behaviors[.]
  She is forthcoming when discussing her goals for improvement[.]
  She has displayed and maintained a strong and consistent sense of
identity throughout our sessions.
  She generally maintains a consistent, steady demeanor.
  She  builds  stable,  positive  and  mature  relationships  with  friends,
colleagues, family, and partners.
I have not seen any of the very concerning behaviors referred to by Dr. [K]
from 2013.
[Applicant]  has  not  shown  any  paranoid  or  bizarre  behaviors,  delusional
thinking, hallucinations, no self-harming or thoughts of harming others. She
has been engaging in healthy dating of men and has been doing well in her
relationship with her mother.
Seven  years  is  a  long  time  and  [Applicant]  has  been  and  continues  to
mature as a responsible adult woman.
It  is  my  professional  opinion  that  she  can  be  trusted  with  classified
information at the sensitive but unclassified and Secret levels and that she
will be an asset to national security.
(AE I)
Applicant has excellent credit, has never been arrested, has no record of violence
against others, and an excellent work history. (Tr. 74; AE D; AE G; AE H) She has solid
relationships with family and friends. (Tr. 74)
",True
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  25  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2012  and  began
working for a federal contractor the same year. He was granted a security clearance in
2012. He married in 2016. He and his wife are expecting a child.
In February 2017, Applicant and his wife purchased home and it caused financial
strain and led to a conflict with his wife. They began seeing a marriage counselor, who
referred  Applicant  to  a  psychiatrist.  In  October  2017,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  by  the
psychiatrist with moderate bipolar disorder. He was prescribed a medication as a mood
stabilizer. The psychiatrist discussed the importance of Applicant being compliant with his
treatment plan, including taking his medication. (Items 6, 7)
In November 2017, Applicant had an argument with his wife, during which he threw
a bottle and punched a wall. He denied he hit his wife. He told his wife he was going to
kill  himself.  She  called  the  police  because  she  was  concerned  for  his  safety.  He  was
arrested and transported voluntarily to a hospital. During the psychiatric evaluation at the
hospital,  he  admitted  to  a  recent  suicide  gesture  that  involved  putting  a  handful  of  his
prescribed medication  for bipolar disorder in  his mouth,  but  then  spitting  them  out.  He
described to the psychiatrist that this was a cry for attention from his wife and that he had
no actual intent on killing himself. He also disclosed to the psychiatrist that he had used
marijuana occasionally since he was 15 years old, and he had last used it several weeks
prior to his hospitalization (November 2017). (Items 6, 7)
The  arrest  in  November  2017  resulted  in  a  disorderly  conduct  charge  and  a
protective  order  barring  him  from  assaulting,  threatening,  abusing,  harassing,  or
otherwise harming his wife. He was not prevented from having contact with his wife. He
was also ordered to attend a nine-week course on family violence. He was advised the
matter would be expunged from his record since it was his first offense. In January 2018,
he was ordered by the court to continue his mental health counseling.  When Applicant
was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  May  2018,  the  matter  had  not  been
expunged, but Applicant resumed living with his wife without incident. (Item 8)
Due to the above incident, which was reported by Applicant to his employer, he
was required to complete a new security clearance application (SCA) in December 2017.
In his SCA, Applicant reported his arrest and bipolar diagnosis. He answered “no” to the
questions asking if he had used any illegal drugs in the past seven years or while holding
a  security  clearance.  He  was  interviewed  under  oath  by  a  government  investigator  on
May 9, 2018. He told the investigator that he had not used illegal drugs or a controlled
substance in the past seven years. On May 29, 2019, he was interviewed again under
oath by a government investigator. He was confronted with his November 2017 disclosure
to the psychiatrist about his marijuana use, where he self-reported that he used marijuana
since he was 15 years old, and his last use was a few weeks prior to his hospitalization.
He also self-reported to the psychiatrist that he occasionally used marijuana on a monthly
or less than monthly basis. Applicant told the government investigator that if that was the
information on record, then yes, he had used marijuana. (Items 3, 5, 9)
When asked by the investigator how often Applicant used marijuana, he stated he
had not used it since before November 2017, and he seldom used it before then. He told
the investigator he could not recall his prior uses. When confronted with why he failed to
disclose  his  marijuana  use  on  his  December  2017  SCA  and  during  his  May  9,  2018
interview, he stated he omitted this information because he was afraid of losing his job.
He  stated  he  used  marijuana  once  or  twice  a  year  with  his  sister-in-law.  He  never
purchased it and only used it when it was offered to him by her and two other friends. He
used marijuana because it made him feel calm and relaxed. When asked why he used
marijuana while holding a security clearance, he did not have an explanation. He told the
investigator that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. Applicant used marijuana
with  varying  frequency  after  being  granted  a  security  clearance  from  2012  until  2017.
(Item 5)
The DOD CAF requested Applicant submit to a psychological evaluation. He was
evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist (LCP) in January 2019. During his evaluation
he disclosed that he intentionally omitted his marijuana use when he completed his SCA
because  he  was  afraid  of  losing  his  job.  Due  to  discrepancies  the  LCP  opined  that  it
appeared Applicant continued to evidence poor candor when discussing his marijuana
use. Applicant disclosed that he previously was treated by a psychiatrist who prescribed
him a “mood stabilizer.” He could not recall the name of the medicine. He took it for about
a year, but said that while using it he felt “out of it” and often fatigued. He decided to stop
taking the medicine on his accord, and did not return to his psychiatrist to taper off the
medication. (Item 4)
The LCP evaluation concluded that she did not find evidence of bipolar disorder,
but found Applicant clearly evinces signs of poor anger control and impulsive behaviors.
She  noted  Applicant  used  poor  judgment  by  unilaterally  discontinuing  his  medication
regimen prescribed for his mood lability. She noted that “it appears more likely that his
mood lability is part of a personality disorder, rather than a manic episode, per se, mood
stabilizers  are  often  used  to  assist  individuals  with  personality  disorders  manage  their
mood states.” (Item 4)
The LCP further noted that Applicant was not forthcoming with information, which
limited her ability to clearly determine the diagnosis, but she noted there were notable
indications, specifically, “he displays impairments in affectivity, difficulties in interpersonal
function, lack of remorse for his actions, deceitfulness, aggressiveness, and poor impulse
control.” (Item 4) She concluded the following:
[Applicant] did not divulge that the mental health treatment he received was
ordered  by  the  court.  He  also  did  not  report  a  psychiatric  hospitalization,
only  that  he  was  briefly  evaluated  at  a  hospital  following  an  arrest  for
domestic  violence.  He  down  played  his  domestic  violence  history,  and
anger  management  issues.  He  did  not  report  the  rate  of  marijuana  use
noted within the investigation records. He was generally guarded, and his
insight into his problematic behaviors was poor. He is not in treatment for
the issues that have led to violent outbursts in the past, making him a risk
for  future  outbursts.  In  sum,  the  aforementioned  behaviors  of  concern
indicate that [Applicant’s] psychological condition impairs his judgment and
reliability;  his  personality  disturbance  makes  him  a  security  risk;  and  his
prognosis is guarded. (Item 4)
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  FORM,  he  stated  that  he  has  been  a  diligent
employee  for  seven  years.  He  has  applied  for  a  new  position  to  better  himself.  He
voluntarily disclosed his arrest to his supervisor. He completed the requirements imposed
by the court after his arrest. He and his wife attended marriage counseling for a couple of
months.  He  has  noticed  a  change  in  his  life  for  the  better.  He  has  learned  to  control
himself and home life has improved. (AE A)

"Applicant is 59 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is married,
with  no  children.  Applicant  was  honorably  retired  from  the  Air  Force  as  a  technical
sergeant  (E-6)  in  2001,  and  has  an  Associate  of  Arts  degree.  He  is  seeking  to  retain
national  security  eligibility  for  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  employment.
(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13C, 15, 17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he suffers from an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair his
judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR
with  explanations.  He  also  submitted  additional  documentation  to  support  a  finding  of
national security eligibility.
Applicant’s mental health issues were first identified when he attempted to commit
suicide  on  November  14,  2009.  He  changed  his  mind,  called  the  police,  and  was
committed  to  a  hospital  for  observation  and  mental  health  treatment.  (Government
Exhibits 6, 7; Tr. 31.)
Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  hospital  on  November  25,  2009,  with  a
diagnosis  of  Major  Depressive  Disorder,  Recurrent,  Severe,  With  Psychotic  Features.
Progress notes from his hospitalization are found in Government Exhibit 8. The notes are
replete with statements by Applicant that he felt he was being covertly observed, even
while he was in the hospital. (See Tr. 33.)
Pertinent  excerpts  from  his  Discharge  Summary  (Government  Exhibit  9)  are  as
follows:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old Caucasian male
with no past psychiatric diagnosis. He was brought in by police on a 5150
for danger to self after patient [Applicant] cut both of his wrists superficially
and  was  observed  to  be  sitting  in  warm  water  in  a  bathtub.  The  patient
stated, “I cut a little more initially, but it didn’t work. I got scared and called
the  police.” The patient  stated  that  he had been feeling  that  people  were
following him for the last year and a half. The patient believed they  were
military personnel. The patient was unsure why they were following him, but
they  were  looking  at  him  in  the  home  as  well  as  following  him  around
wherever he went. The patient stated he believed he was being monitored,
“Because I stare at children too long.” . . . The patient denied auditory or
visual  hallucinations.  The  patient  however  was  preoccupied  with  his
delusions to the point of feeling that people were following him even in the
hospital. The patient reported history of recurrent episodes of depression,
but no psychosis in the past. . . The patient stated that he felt that he needed
to kill himself to save his wife.
The hospital records further state, under “COURSE OF HOSPITALIZATION”:
The  patient  demonstrated  gradual  improvement  to  his  symptoms  with
treatment. . . The patient reported significant decrease in the intensity and
frequency  of  his  paranoid  delusions.  The  patient  states  that  he  was  no
longer bothered by them. The patient initially had thoughts of ending his life
to save his wife. The patient, however, reported resolution of any suicidal or
homicidal ideations.
Applicant  was  prescribed  drugs,  and  also  advised  to  obtain  counseling.  He
continues  on  a  drug  regimen,  as  well  as  counseling,  as  further  described  below.
(Applicant Exhibits A and B.)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  for  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  on  September  11,  2014.  The  investigator  prepared  a  Report  of
Investigation
Applicant’s
“PSYCHOLOGICAL/EMOTIONAL HEALTH”:
(ROI),  which
concerning
follows
stated
as
The  subject’s  anxiety  stems  from  the  constant  feeling  that  people  are
watching him, at work, going to the bathroom, at home, when he is driving,
to “suggest he is doing things he isn’t supposed to do” in order to get rid of
him. The subject could not elaborate on what he meant by “things he isn’t
supposed to do.” These feelings first started in about 2003 date not recalled,
at home, then in about 2005, date not recalled, at work. The subject has
spoken with his supervisor about his belief that people are watching him to
get him on something. The subject’s supervisor has told the subject that no
one is trying to watch him or get things on him. The subject thinks that his
supervisor thinks he is “a bit off.” The subject has not had any disciplinary
actions or confrontations. (See Tr. 26-27.)
The  subject’s  counseling  and  medication  have  helped  him  to  understand
that people are not out to get him, but he still can’t help getting the feeling
that people are watching him. (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.)
Based in part on this interview a staff psychologist at the DoD CAF recommended
that Applicant receive a medical evaluation. The psychologist stated, “Even in the face of
the  very  limited  favorable  medical  testimony,  a  concern  exists  about  the  subject’s
judgment and reliability based upon his intrusive thoughts/anxieties he expressed to the
OPM investigator during his 11 SEP 14 PSI [Personal Subject Interview].” (Government
Exhibit 4.)
Applicant received a psychological evaluation from a licensed psychologist/clinical
neuropsychologist  (Evaluator)  on  November  3  and  10,  2017.  (See  Tr.  36.)  The
Evaluator’s report is Government Exhibit 3. Pertinent excerpts from this document are as
follows:
COLLATERAL INTERVIEWS (CONDUCTED BY PHONE):
[Applicant] provided a signed authorization for this evaluator to speak with
his treating psychiatrist Dr. [A]. On November 8, 2017, Dr. [A] reported that
[Applicant]  is  being  treated  for  Major  Depressive  Disorder,  recurrent,
severe,  with  psychotic  features  and  Delusional  Disorder.  He  has  been
treating  [Applicant]  since  December  2009.  Dr.  [A]  first  began  providing
treatment on a monthly basis and reduced it to one time every two months.
[Applicant]  is reported  to  be  consistent  with  is appointments. The current
prescribed  psychotropic  medications  are  as  follows:  Risperdal  .5  mg,
Wellbutrin 150 mg, Lexapro 20 mg, and Klonopin .5 mg. Dr. [A] is aware of
[Applicant’s] persecutory/paranoid delusions, and reports Risperdal .5 mg
is a low dose, but he has been unable to increase the dose due to reported
side-effects.  Dr.  [A],  reports  Risperdal  is  about  the  only  antipsychotic
medication that [Applicant] will tolerate. Some of the paranoid delusions that
Dr. [A] is aware of are as follows: Co-workers are talking about him, playing
games with him, his work is trying to fire him, he is being monitored by his
computer and his telephone. Dr. [A] reports that [Applicant] is guarded and
does not go into detail about the paranoid delusions. Dr. [A] reports that he
does not believe that there would be a problem in [Applicant’s] judgment or
reliability  in  safeguarding  secret/confidential  information  because  of  the
following: He has known [Applicant] for so long, he is able to perform his
job, has been relatively free of disciplinary actions, has not been fired from
his job, and [Applicant] is at baseline/not deteriorating.
BRIEF HISTORY OF RELEVENT ISSUES:
.
.
.
.
Although he continues to work as a . . . Assistant Site Manager, and
has been with the same company for many years, [Applicant] reports having
the  following  complaints  (persecutory/paranoid  delusions):  His  work  is
trying  to  fire  him  because  he  stares  at  women  too  long;  co-workers  are
talking  about  him,  playing  games  with  him;  he  is  being  monitored  by  his
computer and his telephone, “People are working on getting me fired; they
track  how  many  times  I  look  at  women;  security  guards  on  the base  can
read  my  mind  or  put  things  in  my  mind.”  [Applicant]  reports  ongoing
treatment with Dr. [A], psychiatrist, for medication management, and [Dr. B],
PhD, MFCC, for individual therapy. [Applicant] reports ongoing discussions,
on the above ideations, with both treatment providers. Dr. [A] reports he is
aware of the above delusions.
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION/TESTING RESULTS:
Mental Status Exam: . . . [Applicant] reported suffering stress due to people
at  his  work  trying  to  get  him  fired  .  .  .  No  obvious  or  unusual  anxiety
symptoms were noticed, beyond closing his eyes when reporting paranoid
ideations. [Applicant’s] thought process was linear; his thought content was
irrational when discussing paranoid delusions; thought content was relevant
to the topic being discussed. . . .
Personality  Assessment  Inventory  (PAI):  This  evaluator  administered  the
PAI to [Applicant], which resulted in a valid profile, validity indices were well
within  the  normal  range,  suggesting  that  he  answered  in  a  consistent
manner, attended appropriately  to  the  item  content, and  had an ability  to
identify positive and negative qualities/attributes about himself.
[Applicant] elevated several of the clinical scales, indicating that he suffers
from  significant  anxiety,  depression,  and  psychotic  symptoms.  The  most
significantly elevated clinical scales suggest that [Applicant] is hypervigilant
and overly suspicious; he spends much time monitoring his environment for
evidence  that  others  are  trying  to  harm  or  discredit  him.  He  also  has
persecutory  beliefs  that  people  are  plotting  against  him  in  some  sort  of
conspiracy  (e.g.,  “People  want  to fire me”). People may  view  him as  odd
and  eccentric,  due  to  his  hypervigilance  and  unconventional  ideas.  As  a
result of his paranoid ideations (e.g., “Security guards on base can read my
mind and put things in my mind”) and related anxiety, he socially isolates
and detaches, which may serve to decrease his social discomfort.
.
.
.
.
Although he is not aware that many of his thoughts are delusional in nature,
he acknowledges that he has major emotional difficulties and believes he
needs help.
Based  on  the  foregoing,  under  the  section  “DIAGNOSTIC  IMPRESSIONS,”  the
Evaluator found  the  following  diagnoses,  which  are  consistent  with  those  of  Dr.  A,  set
forth above: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with psychotic features; and,
Delusional Disorder, Persecutory Type.
The report concludes:
IMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS
in  Risperdal
Long-term  prognosis  is  fair  if  [Applicant]  is  willing/able  to  tolerate  an
(or  another  antipsychotic  medication  as
increase
recommended by Dr. [A]). In the past, [Applicant] adhered to a higher dose
of Risperdal, resulting in an improved mental state and stability. However,
at this time, [Applicant’s] immediate prognosis is poor. He continues to have
significant  paranoid  delusions,  depressed  mood,  anxiety,  and  periodic
suicide  ideation.  Insight  into  his  delusions  is  currently  poor.  There  is
currently significant interpersonal functional impairment in [Applicant’s] life.
He also has a history of occupational difficulties (e.g., Unable to work as a
result of psychiatric hospitalization in 2009, security clearance was revoked
in 2009) without mental health treatment. Without an increase in Risperdal
(or another antipsychotic), his prognosis is likely to remain poor.
CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS
At this time, [Applicant’s] current mental state and functioning impacts his
ability,  reliability,  judgment,  stability  and  trustworthiness  in  handling  or
safeguarding classified information. I agree with Dr. [A] that [Applicant] is
able to perform his job, and does not have a history of aggression or being
fired from his place of employment. However, [Applicant] is not in touch with
reality, at this time, due to his continued paranoid delusions; furthermore,
he  continues  to  experience  depression  and  anxiety,  and  periodic  suicide
ideation;  this  dysregulation  of  neurotransmitters  could  affect  the  frontal
lobes, and areas involved in decision making and metacognition. As a result
of his current mental state, and poor insight, there is significant concern that
[Applicant] could pose a risk of unauthorized disclosure or mishandling of
classified information.
Applicant’s treating psychiatrist, Dr. A, provided a written statement dated April 23,
2018. It is Applicant Exhibit A and reads as follows:
Please be advised that [Applicant] has been under my psychiatric care since
12/15/2009  for  the  medication  management  of  major  depression  with
psychotic features and the delusional disorder, persecutory type. He is seen
every  one  to  two  months  for  medication  management  and  his  current
medications are Lexapro 20 mg at bedtime, Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime and
Klonopin 0.5 mg as needed.2  [Applicant] attends his sessions regularly and
has  been  compliant  with
for  medication
management.
recommendations
the
Applicant testified that his psychiatrist had changed his prescription from Risperdal
to Zyprexa because of some suicidal thoughts he was having. He also thought that Dr. A
put him on Zyprexa because of the recommendation from the Evaluator that Applicant’s
medication either be changed or increased. (Tr. 37-38.)
Applicant  also  has  a  treating  psychologist,  Dr.  B,  who  also  submitted  a  written
statement,  dated  March  22,  2018.  He  has  been  seeing  Applicant  since  approximately
2005. (Tr. 25, 38-39.) The statement is Applicant Exhibit B and reads as follows:
I  am  writing  this  letter  to  confirm  that  [Applicant]  has  been  in  individual
counseling with me. [Applicant] has been showing good progress in dealing
with  his  anxiety  issues.  We  have  been  utilizing  Cognitive  Behavioral
Therapy and Solution Focused Therapy as the basis for affecting change in
his life. [Applicant] reports improvement in dealing with the stressors of his
life.  He  is  a  very  willing  and  cooperative  client  who  has  an  excellent
prognosis.
Applicant  testified  concerning  his  issues  at  some  length.  He  confirmed  that  his
issues began in 2004 or 2005 with a constant feeling that people were watching him at
work, while going to the bathroom, at home, while he was driving, and suggesting that he
was doing things he wasn’t supposed to be doing. Applicant testified that he continued to
have these feelings today about his fellow workers. He also believed  at the time of the
hearing  that  such  observation  was  being  done  covertly  by  his  management  and
investigators, though not as much as during earlier days. (Tr. 24-32.)
2  I take administrative notice of the following facts concerning  the drugs that are currently prescribed for
Applicant.  Lexapro  is  an  anti-depressant.  (WebMD,  Lexapro,  https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-
63990/lexapro-oral/details  (accessed  December  28,  2018).)  Zyprexa  is  an  anti-psychotic.  (WebMD,
Zyprexa,  https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1699/zyprexa-oral/details
(accessed  December  28,
2018).)    Klonopin is used to treat panic disorder and anxiety. (WebMD, Klonopin, https://www.webmd.com/
drugs/2/drug-920-6006/klonopin-oral/clonazepam-oral/details (accessed December 28, 2018).)
Applicant testified that he did not believe the security guards at work were reading
his mind and putting thoughts in his head. He further testified:
There’s this one Security outfit that has some kind of device or something,
if you’ve seen on the news and whatnot. They’ve had ways where they can
go, where people can go and use hearing – brain-connecting hearing aids
– to brain waves so deaf people can hear and whatnot. So, it’s not really a
stretch for those same waves to be – if they have the right frequency – could
go and listen and understand them. (Tr. 46.)
He  was  asked  by  me,  “And  you  believe  this  is  happening  with  you?”  Applicant
responded, “It happened yes.” I also asked him, “Is it currently happening, or in the past?”
Applicant stated, “In the past, yes, Your Honor.” (Ibid.)
Applicant provided  a  letter  of  recommendation from  a  retired member of the  Air
Force who knows Applicant well. The writer met Applicant at church, believes Applicant
to be a trustworthy person, and recommends him to receive national security eligibility.
(Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 39-40.)

"Applicant is  53  years old.  He  has worked for  a major aerospace  company since
March  2014  as  a  mission  systems  engineer,  and   applied  for   a  security  clearance  in
connection  with that employment. He  graduated from  high school in 1985, and  earned a
bachelor   of  science  degree  in   1999.  He   completed  his  master’s  degree  in  electrical
engineering in  2013, and  suspended his participation  in  an engineering  Ph.D. program
when  he  relocated  to   accept  his  current  position.  He   is  recently  married   and   has  no
children. (Answer;  Response;  GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 87, 104, 113.)
Applicant’s parents divorced when he was an adolescent. They, and Applicant’s
siblings, all moved away and left him to live with family friends until he graduated from
high school in 1985. He joined the Army shortly thereafter, but was separated from the
service  with  an  uncharacterized  entry-level  discharge  for  “failure  to  adapt,”  before
completing his initial training. For the next six or seven years he was unemployed and
homeless,  surviving  through  public  assistance  and  crime  while  increasingly  abusing
various drugs. He does not remember specific dates and details of this period of his life,
but   confirmed  that   it  included   several  periods  of  incarceration,  several  inpatient
admissions   in   a  psychiatric  hospital  unit   for   mental  health  treatment,   and   a  year  of
residence in a large “unlocked residential   facility . . . for adults with mental illness . . .
[where] residents are allowed to come and go freely and are afforded the same rights as
all other Americans.”  It  was  only  in  that  residential  facility  that he was  ever  diagnosed,
vaguely,  with a  schizoaffective disorder; and  he paid for this  arrangement by  signing over
all of  his resulting Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  disability benefits,  while  receiving
back a small  stipend.  After  living there for  a year,  he moved into a motel  across the street
where he could retain a larger portion of his SSI funds. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; AE A; AE  D;
AE E; Tr. 43-45, 108-113.)
Applicant reported that he lived in California from  2002 to 2008, then  in  Arizona
from  2008 to  March 2014, all in  Federally subsidized Section 8  rental  housing.  From 2002
to 2010, he was unemployed or  worked  in  short-term temporary-placement-agency jobs.
He  then  entered graduate  school  at a major state university,  pursuing a master’s degree.
His drug  abuse  stopped  when  he  obtained the  Section 8  housing, but  he continued  to
pursue  mental health  treatment, which allowed him  to  qualify  for  vocational rehabilitation
program benefits and  to continue receiving  SSI.  In Arizona, during 2008, he  started with
a  new   outpatient  mental  health   counseling  service  so  he  could  continue   to  receive
medications.  In  2010,  he was diagnosed with bipolar  disorder by his treating psychiatric
nurse  practitioner  (NP).  His  medical   records  reflect  continuous  and   successful
participation   in   treatment  until   2013,  when  the   time   demands  of   finishing  his  master’s
degree prevented his regular attendance. (Answer;  Response;   AE D;  AE  G;  Tr.  23, 52-
53, 61, 66, 72, 78-79,  97,  113-121,  128.)
During a therapy session in 2013, Applicant discussed the emerging technologies
that  permit   “smart”  televisions  to  collect  and   send  information  about  people  to  data-
collection  companies.   This  was   a  subject  that  had   come  up  during  his  electrical
engineering  studies.  He   did  not   consider  it  to   be  a  personal   problem,   because  he
considered  himself not to be important enough for  anyone to be spying on him,  and  it did
not lead to a diagnosis  of,  or treatment for, paranoia. He adamantly denied ever having,
or  reporting,  thoughts  of  harming  himself,   as  alleged  in   the  SOR.  The   record  medical
evidence corroborates the absence  of any such reports. (GE 3;  GE 4; AE  D; AE  G;  Tr.
70-78, 91-92, 122-125.)
After completing his master’s degree, Applicant was accepted into the engineering
Ph.D. program at the same university. Again, academic demands on his time prevented
him from fully participating in continued treatment at the counselling service. However,
the service’s records indicate that he returned for significant periods of counselling until
he decided to leave school for his current employment in 2014. As part of his decision-
making  process,  and  aware  that  he  would  need  to  apply  for  a  security  clearance,  he
consulted  with  NP  concerning  the  potential  for  psychological  issues  to  raise  security
concerns. She assured him that his mental health was under good control and that she
would certify that there was no current basis for such concerns. She, in fact, did provide
a  positive  prognosis  to  that  effect.  Before  that  time  and  under  her  direction,  he  had
stopped  taking  any  psychiatric  medications.  (Answer;  Response;  AE  G;  Tr.  60-62,  70,

On April 8, 2018, at the request of the DoD CAF, a licensed clinical psychologist
performed  a  psychological  evaluation  of  Applicant.  She  issued  her  report  on  April  18,
2018.  (GE   4)  She  based  this  report  and   her  opinions  on  some   investigatory  records
provided by the DoD CAF, her clinical interview and observations, and  the results of the
Personality Assessment Inventory  (PAI)  that she had  Applicant  complete. Although she
was provided Applicant’s release of  information authorization to speak with NP, she chose
not to contact NP  because she considered her review  of the records provided by the DoD
CAF to be sufficient for  purposes of her assessment. Most of the allegations in the SOR
are  based   on  comments  in   this  report,  several  of  which   are  factually  incorrect.  For
instance, she states that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic features,
which  appears nowhere else in his extensive medical  records. (GE 4; AE  C; AE D; AE  G;
Tr. 52, 56, 62-72, 90-91, 121.)
A  complete  analysis   of  GE  4  reveals  that  the  selectively  quoted  language
contained in the SOR  portrays a  misunderstanding of the evaluation’s results and report.
Pertinent sections of the report state:
Overall,  [Applicant’s]  clinical  profile   on  the   PAI  did  not  result  in   any
elevations  that  would   be  indicative  of  clinically  significant  mental  health
issues, despite his mental health and  treatment history. Due to [Applicant’s]
apparent guardedness and  positive impression management . . . diagnostic
impressions were unable to be yielded  through the PAI.  . . . The  validity of
is  subsequently  questionable,  and   diagnostic
personality
impressions were unable to be determined.
testing
Nevertheless, the psychologist neither performed any additional  testing nor contacted NP
to  discuss  Applicant’s   most  recent  course  of  mental  health  treatment.  She  expressed
concern that Applicant’s symptoms might  recur in  the  absence of ongoing psychotropic
medication,   although  he   had   been  functioning  well  without  any   formal  treatment  or
recurrence   of  symptoms  since  2014.  Her   formally  stated  diagnosis,   “(per  applicant
report),”  was: Schizoaffective Disorder,  Bipolar Type, Multiple Episodes, currently in  full
remission R/O Bipolar Disorder,  with Psychotic Features, currently in  full remission. (Note:
R/O  (Rule  Out)  is  a  common,  but  not  formally  proper,  way  of  saying  that  there  is  not
sufficient evidence  to make the diagnosis but it might be worth exploring  further  to rule it
out.)   She  concluded  that  his  prognosis  was   guarded,  given  his  current  lack  of  mental
health services. (GE 4.)
Although  he  continued  to  function  well,  both  personally  and  professionally,
Applicant sought mental health treatment from a highly qualified psychiatrist starting June
4,  2019,  to  address  the  DoD  CAF’s  concerns  regarding  his  national  security  eligibility.
She diagnosed Applicant with Adjustment Disorder with anxious features, stemming from
fear of losing his job. She reported that she does not believe he has a thought disorder
(schizophrenia  or  schizoaffective  disorder),  or  bipolar  affective  disorder.  She  found  no
symptoms of  a thought disorder  or  mood disorder  and  that  any earlier,  probably  drug-
related,  psychiatric  issues  were  in  remission.  She  reported  that  he  was  undergoing  a
regular course of treatment with her, and had been fully compliant. She concluded that
there is no indication of a current problem, and does not foresee him relapsing. (AE F.)
Applicant has continued a regular and successful course of treatment with this psychiatrist
every two weeks since June 2019. (AE H; Tr. 79-80, 129-130.)
Applicant’s performance evaluations reflect excellent performance with no mention
of any behavioral or psychological issues. He is now married, owns a home, and lives a
stable and responsible life. (Answer; Response; AE F.)
",True
"Applicant is a 56-year-old personal computer technician for a defense contractor,
employed  since  December  2018.  He  received  a  high  school  equivalency  certificate  in
1983 and earned some college credits and information technology (IT) certificates. He
was married in 2013 and divorced in 2014, but they continue to cohabitate. Applicant has
one adult daughter that lives with him and two adult stepchildren. Applicant served in the
Army National Guard and Army Reserve from 1990 to 2017, some of which was in the
individual ready reserve. From 2005 to 2017, Applicant was on active duty as a volunteer
Active Guard and Reserve (AGR). He was honorably discharged at the expiration of his
military enlistment contracts.
The  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  I  that  Applicant  was  twice  evaluated  in  2015
(SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  2018  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  by  mental  health  professionals  who  called  into
question his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness and mental stability.  Applicant denied
the allegations. Under Guideline F, the amended SOR also alleged that Applicant has 17
delinquent debts totaling about $37,484. Applicant admitted all of the financial allegations.
Applicant deployed to Afghanistan from 2013 to 2014, and served as an IT analyst
and on occasion, in a personal security detail. He returned to his National Guard unit, but
soon  thereafter  volunteered  for  a  one-year  assignment  with  the  active  duty  Army  in
another state. He served in a dual role, filling a position of a sergeant major (E-9) while
holding the rank of staff sergeant (E-6). This caused several conflicts when he attempted
to protect his junior soldiers, and also a conflict with an Army officer that accused him of
chest-bumping him. He felt that he had not decompressed for his deployment, and took
on additional stress in this position.
Applicant was referred for a psychological evaluation at an Army medical center in
March 2015. Applicant reported  that he was treated in 2011 with Ambien for insomnia
and that he and his spouse had marriage counseling in 2014. He reported the dispute
with the officer that resulted in his referral and the difficulty he was experiencing in the
job.  Applicant’s  personal  problems  checklist  assessment  showed  no  stressors.  The
licensed clinical psychologist noted that this is highly unusual and uncommon in healthy
individuals. His personality assessment inventory (PAI) suggested that Applicant may not
have  answered  in  a  forthright  manner  and  showed  that  he  was  defensive  and  viewed
himself to be free of any shortcomings. The clinical assessment was that he was reflecting
anti-social behavior. Despite this, the psychologist made no diagnosis and noted that he
does not require treatment. His prognosis was “good,” based on no problems reported.
She  noted  however  that  there  does  appear  to  be  significant  defects  in  psychological,
social, or occupational functioning that could impair this judgment, reliability, or stability.
She gave him an unfavorable security clearance recommendation.
After  returning  from  assignment  in  about  2016,  Applicant  received  orders  for
another assignment with active duty troops after being home about one to two months.
He also received notice that he would be medically boarded for injuries he sustained in
Afghanistan. This again increased his stress. He filled a position of a sergeant first class,
while he retained the  rank  of  staff  sergeant.  He believed the  previous  occupant  of  the
position was derelict in her duties and did not properly train the 20 subordinate soldiers
for whom she was responsible. Applicant believed the job was stressful, and added to his
eventual diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Applicant stated that he attended private counseling from about 2014 to November
2017. He was discharged from the Army in 2017 with a medical separation, and he began
employment as a civilian contractor about four days later. He performed his job well and
had no incidents with coworkers. He spent about three years in physical therapy for neck
and  back  injuries,  and  continues  to  be  in  pain  from  these  injuries.  He  was  prescribed
Zoloft by his primary care physician for PTSD that keeps him calm and content.
In March 2018, Applicant was re-evaluated by a private licensed psychologist at
the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF.  Applicant  had  difficulty  arriving  at  his  scheduled
appointments  on  time,  or  making  them  altogether.  He  believes  the  doctor  was  biased
against  him  for  this  reason.  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  PTSD.  Although  the  doctor
could not make conclusions based on her meetings with Applicant, she opined that based
on his record, he demonstrated certain personality difficulties. She noted that Applicant
“plays  by  his  own  set  of  rules.”  She  noted  that  besides  PTSD,  Applicant  did  not  meet
diagnostic  criteria  for  any  other  psychiatric  condition.  However,  she  determined  that
Applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are impaired, based on his history of
anti-social behavior, his tendency to be evasive regarding his legal history, and his limited
insight  into  the  ways  he  may  have  contributed  to  conflict  in  his  relationships.  She
assessed  his  mental  health  prognosis  as  “poor”  and  requiring  intensive,  long-term
therapy.
Applicant  testified  that  since  his  2018  evaluation,  he  has  been  taking  his
medication and has not had any confrontations except for a time where he protected his
daughter from a violent boyfriend. Applicant claimed the man was at his home when he
became violent with his daughter. Applicant asked him to leave, and the man approached
him with a knife. Applicant stated that he calmly disabled the man and led him to the end
of  his  driveway  to  wait  for  police  to  arrive.  The  man  was  arrested  and  Applicant  was
praised for his response.
Applicant has not taken action to address the SOR debts. He stated he was current
on  his  mortgage  after  a  loan  modification.  He  has  not  attended  formal  financial
counseling,  but  has  read  writings  of  a  well-known  financial  manager  who  advises
addressing the smallest debts first. At the time of the hearing, he had not filed his 2017
income tax return because he is unable to determine how to report his overseas earnings
while deployed. Applicant has about $400 in savings, and earns about $60,000 per year.
He noted that he has no net remainder after paying monthly expenses.
Applicant received a $60,000 medical separation payment in 2017 and used the
money left over after taxes to buy a 47-acre ranch. He rescues horses and other animals,
but  has  been  generally  unable  to  place  them  in  new  homes.  He  has  had  to  learn
regenerative farming techniques so that he can grow sufficient grass to feed his animals.
Applicant  has  also  taken  over  his  step-son’s  car  expenses.  He  has  a  budget  and  his
daughter and grandson live with him and his ex-wife.
Applicant has an 80% disability rating from the Veteran’s Administration (VA). He
sees a primary care physician at the VA who treats his anxiety, but he has not requested
psychological counseling or PTSD treatment. Applicant noted that he learned from past
counseling how to handle stress. He does not believe he has a current recommendation
to attend counseling and does not feel a need for counseling while he is on his medication.
He noted he has “great” reviews by his employer and has not had any law enforcement
interactions  in  the  past  two  years.  No  evidence  of  civilian  employment  problems  or
manifested psychological issues since the 2018 assessment was offered into evidence. I
found Applicant’s testimony to be straightforward, forthcoming, clear, calm, and sincere.

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations, except SOR ¶ 1.e,
which  she  denied  with  explanations.  (AE  at  12-15)  She  also  provided  mitigating
information. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  technical  report  writer  who  has  been  employed  by  a

master’s degree. (Tr. 20; GE 1 at 13-14; AE at 28) Her bachelor’s degree was cum laude
with distinction. (Tr. 20)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges and Applicant admitted that in approximately October 2010, she
was hospitalized for suicidal ideations, depression, anxiety, and an emotional breakdown.
Prior to her inpatient treatment, Applicant was receiving counseling, but not medication.
(Tr.  23)  In  2010,  Applicant  was  under  stress  from  classes  and  her  relationship  with  a
boyfriend, and she became depressed. (Tr. 22) She had a plan to end her life, either by
jumping from a balcony or getting hit by a vehicle. (Tr. 65) A classmate reported her to a
school counselor, who arranged to have her admitted for inpatient treatment. (Tr. 65) She
received about one week of inpatient and one week of intensive outpatient treatment. (Tr.
23, 65) She was diagnosed as having depression and anxiety, and she was prescribed
psychotropic medication. (Tr. 23) She followed treatment advice; however, her medication
was not as effective as it should have been, and she was hospitalized in February 2011.
(Tr. 24)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges and Applicant admitted that in approximately February 2011,
she  was  hospitalized  for  psychiatric  treatment,  a  suicide  attempt,  suicidal  ideations,
depression,  anxiety,  and  medication  adjustments.  Applicant  attempted  to  hang  herself
with a scarf. (Tr. 66) She explained that the following stressors affected her mental status:
she graduated early from college; her relationship with her boyfriend ended; she was in
a  car  accident;  and  she  needed  her  medications  adjusted.  (Tr.  24-26)  She  voluntarily
sought inpatient treatment. (Tr. 25) The medication she received in 2010 caused “rapid
cycling” or going from depression to a kind of hypomania. (Tr. 25-26) Her medication was
changed to Zoloft for depression and Wellbutrin for mood stabilization. (Tr. 25-26) She
received post inpatient follow-up treatment from two psychiatrists and a therapist. (Tr. 26)
She received multiple medication changes or adjustments. (Tr. 27)
SOR ¶ 1.c  alleges and Applicant  admitted that in approximately November 2014,
she  was  hospitalized   for   psychiatric  treatment,   depression,  anxiety,   general  mental
breakdown, and  medication adjustments.  She was under stress  because of difficulty in
the  completion  of  her  thesis  for   her  master’s  program.   (Tr.  27)  She  did  not  have   any
friends in  graduate school, and  she had  suicidal  ideation and  engaged in  self  harm. (Tr.
27) She cut herself;  however,  the cuts were shallow  and  not sufficiently harmful for  her to
seek medical attention for  them. (Tr. 66-67) She also took six  extra pills; however, she
did not seek medical  attention for  the overdose. (Tr. 67) In 2014, her father picked her up
at graduate school  and brought her to her home state for inpatient  treatment. (Tr.  67-68)
She was hospitalized to monitor her reactions from medication changes and to enable
her  to  receive  more  intensive  counseling.   (Tr.  28)  She  was  prescribed  Prozac,  her
Wellbutrin dosage was adjusted upward, and she received Klonopin  to treat her anxiety.
(Tr. 29)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  and  Applicant  admits  that  she  received  a  psychological
evaluation from a licensed clinical psychologist, Dr. K, in December 2017. (GE 3a) Dr. K
diagnosed  her  with:  Major  Depressive  Disorder,  severe,  without  psychotic  features;
Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Attention-Deficit Disorder (ADD) without hyperactivity; and
Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  (PTSD).  (GE  3a  at  4)  Applicant  agreed  with  Dr.  K’s
diagnoses. (Tr. 30) She was prescribed the following medications: Adderall XR (15 mg);
Wellbutrin  (200  mg);  Klonopin  (0.5  mg);  and  Prozac  (40  mg).  (GE  3a  at  4)  Dr.  K
interviewed  her  for  two  hours,  and  two  hours  of  tests  were  conducted.  (Tr.  30)  Dr.  K
recommended that she receive psychiatric medication and medication management, and
he indicated she would benefit from a variety of individual therapies. (Tr. 31) Dr. K said:
With  respect  to  suicidal  ideation,  she  reports  experiencing  intense  and
recurrent suicidal thoughts, hence, potential for suicide should be evaluated
regularly  by  her  therapist  and  appropriate  interventions  should  be
implemented, as needed. Data also indicates that [Applicant] may also, at
times, be somewhat emotionally labile, manifesting fairly rapid and extreme
mood  swings,  which  may  also  include  intense  emotional  (i.e.  anger)
outbursts. [She] also endorsed the following symptoms of depression on the
[Beck's  Depression  Inventory]:  feeling  sad  all  the  time,  sense  of  failure,
feeling  discouraged  about
feeling
dissatisfied  or  bored  with  everything,  feelings  of  guilt,  self-hate,  self-
criticism,  loss  of  interest  in  others,  trouble  making  decisions,  reduced
interest  in  socializing,  negative  self-image,  crying  more  than  usual,  self-
annoyance  and  irritability,  trouble  with  concentration,  sleep  and  appetite
disturbances,  fatigue,  suicidal  ideations  without  intent  or  plan,  .  .  .  and
psychosomatic complaints. (GE 3a at 6)
future,  reduced  satisfaction,
the
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges that on May 18, 2019, the CAF sent Applicant for an evaluation
by Dr. W, a psychologist, who considered her background information, a clinical interview,
observations, and psychological testing.  Applicant said Dr. W interviewed her for about
an hour, and she was tested for about an hour. (Tr. 32) Dr. W concluded that Applicant
met the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder recurrent, moderate; PTSD, chronic; and
Generalized Anxiety Disorder. (GE 4 at 7) Dr. W said:
With  respect  to  suicidal  ideation,  [Applicant]  reports  experiencing  intense
and  recurrent  suicidal  thoughts  at  a  level  typical  of  individuals  who  are
placed on suicide precautions. Whereas she denied suicidal ideation during
the  interview,  a  careful  follow-up  regarding  the  details  of  her  suicidal
thoughts and the potential for suicidal behavior is warranted, along with an
evaluation  of  her  life  circumstances  and  available  support  systems  as
potential mediating factors. (GE 4 at 6)
Dr. W concluded that suicidal thoughts continue to pose a concern for Applicant,
and that there is a risk of future mental health problems based on difficulties with anxiety,
insomnia,  and  PTSD  symptoms.  Dr.  W  concluded  that  Applicant  was  not  engaged  in
enough of the right type of counseling or other medical treatment, and that her conditions
and  symptoms  may  impact  her  judgment,  reliability,  or  trustworthiness,  and  that  her
prognosis is guarded. (GE 4 at 7) Dr. W did not advise Applicant of the type of counseling
or  therapy  that  she  needed.  (Tr.  70)  At  the  time  of  Dr.  W’s  evaluation,  Applicant  was
receiving therapy every two weeks, and a psychiatrist managed her medications. (Tr. 33)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that from January 2016 to present Applicant received treatment
from Dr. F for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent
episode, moderate. Applicant met with Dr. F every two or three months to ascertain the
effectiveness of her medications, and when she became pregnant, the frequency of her
appointments  was  increased  to  a  monthly  basis.  (Tr.  35)  Dr.  F repeatedly  indicated  in
Applicant’s  medical  records  “Negative  for  agitation,  behavioral  problems,  decreased
concentration, dysphoric mood, hallucinations, self-injury, sleep disturbance and suicidal
ideas.” (GE 3b) In May 2020, her Zoloft dosage was reduced from 100 milligrams to 50
milligrams, she stopped taking Vibryd, another antidepressant, Wellbutrin, and Klonopin
because of her pregnancy. (Tr. 35-36) After her baby was born, she remained exclusively
on  Zoloft,  and  she  has  not  suffered  from  depression.  (Tr.  36)  Her  doctor  has  been
considering changing her medications. (Tr. 37)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  that  from  November  2017  to  present  Applicant  received
treatment from Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) J for Major Depressive Disorder
Moderate, PTSD, and General Anxiety. Initially, she met with LPC J every week for 45
minutes,  and  then  in  2018  and  2019,  she  met  LPC  J  every  two  weeks  for  45-minute
therapy sessions involving “talk and cognitive behavioral therapy to allow [Applicant] to
talk  through  potential  stressors  and  provide  [her]  with  coping  mechanisms  that  enable
[her] to successfully manage her mental health.”  (Tr. 43; SOR response at 5-6) LPC J
also provided dialectical behavioral therapy to Applicant. (Tr. 43) The frequency of LPC
J’s sessions was reduced to every two weeks based on  LPC J’s recommendation. (Tr.
43-44)
On  January  31,  2020,  LPC  J  wrote  that  Applicant  had  increased  feelings  of
depression and Dr. F increased her antidepressant dosage. (Tr. 58; AE at 62) Applicant
told LPC J that “work has been stressful and she had to be spoken to by her supervisor
because she has made multiple mistakes. She also added that she feels unorganized.”
(Tr. 58-59; AE at 62) At the next session with LPC J on February 14, 2020, Applicant’s
“mood  appeared  to  be  Anxious,  Depressed  and  Irritable,  Full  range/appropriate  and
reactive and tearful.” (AE at 64) LPC J wrote in Applicant’s medical record that Applicant
disclosed that her “‘brain shut off’ and she started to self harm while at work. [Applicant]
reported she made mistakes at work and felt disappointed and embarrassed of herself.
Therapist helped [Applicant] explore her feelings and patient shared she self harmed to
punish herself and to relieve her anger.” (Tr. 60; AE at 64)
After   COVID-19  became  a  national  problem  around  March  2020,  Applicant’s
appointments were by telephone or video telephone and  not in  person with LPC J. (Tr.
71) Her next four sessions after the February 14, 2020 session with LPC J were on March
7, 2020; April  15, 2020; June 19, 2020; and  July 1, 2020.  (Tr. 60-62; AE  at 66, 72, 78, 80)
Applicant did not recall  meeting with LPC J  after  July 1, 2020, and  her medical  records
do not reflect meeting with a therapist after July 1, 2020. (Tr. 62, 75)
Applicant said she reduced her sessions with LPC J because she thought some of
LPC J’s comments relating to her pregnancy and  the prospective birth of her daughter
were inappropriate and less professional than her previous counseling sessions. (Tr. 72,
78,  113)  Applicant  did  not  tell  LPC  J  that  she  was  uncomfortable  because  of  LPC  J’s
comments. (Tr. 75) LPC J left her practice in 2020, and Applicant has been looking for a
new therapist since then. (Tr. 41, 45) She attempted to employ one therapist; however,
due to an insurance issue, it did not work out. (Tr. 76) She hopes to resume appointments
with a therapist in the next month after her hearing. (Tr. 42, 114)
From November 2019 to December 2020, Applicant and her husband met with a
couple’s counselor about once a month. (Tr. 73) She told the counselor about her mental-
health history. (Tr. 77) She did not indicate whether the couple’s counselor assessed her
for work-related stress, suicidal ideations, and the need for medication adjustments.
At her December 9, 2020 session with Dr. F, she informed him that she was not
seeing a therapist, and he “strongly encouraged [her] to resume counseling/therapy.” (Tr.
63-64; AE at 91) At her February 16, 2021 session with Dr. F, he concluded Applicant “is
feeling  more  anxious  and  somewhat  low.  This  may  very  well  be  a  result  of  sleep
deprivation. Since she is no longer nursing therefore the dose of Zoloft will be increased
to  treat  the  residual  symptoms.  .  .  .  She  was  strongly  encouraged  to  resume
counseling/therapy.”  (Tr.  64;  AE  at  95)  At  her  March  2021  appointment  with  Dr.  F,  he
gave her a list of suggested therapists to see. (Tr. 64)
Applicant is active in her church, volunteers in youth education, and as a church
officer. (Tr. 54; AE at 28) She also plays an instrument on a symphony orchestra and in
a musical capacity for her church. (Tr. 54; AE at 28)
Applicant first had suicidal ideations at age 13. (GE 4 at 2) She has been working
with various therapists since 2007 or 2008. (Tr. 40) Over the last  11 years, Applicant’s
medications have been changed about 20 times. (Tr. 37) At age 23, she “was violently
raped.” (GE 4 at 3) “[A]fter she was raped, she experienced flashbacks, hypervigilance,
increased  startle,  feelings  of  guilt,  anger,  shame  and  blame  and  she  avoided  sexual
encounters.”  (Id.)  Based  on  genetic  testing  about  two  years  ago,  her  medications  and
dosages have been more effective because they are specifically designed for her body
chemistry. (Tr. 37-39) She increased the frequency of her meetings with Dr. F mostly for
medication management. (Tr. 41-42, 51) She said she always complied with treatment
recommendations.  (Tr.  46)  Her  treatment  has  always  been  voluntary.  (Tr.  46)  She  is
feeling  much  better  than  she  did  several  years  ago.  (Tr.  47)  She  has  not  had  a  panic
attack  since  2019.  (Tr.  47)  The  most  stressful  part  of  Applicant’s  life  was  her  work
environment.  (Tr.  73-74)  She  worked  in  a  large  room  with  about  50  employees  in  the
same  room,  and  they  worked  from  their  cubicles.  (Tr.  74)  Circumstances  beyond  her
control adversely affected her productivity, and supervisors became upset. (Tr. 74) She
believed that she could return to her work environment after the pandemic, and she could
handle the stress and her anxiety. (Tr. 75)
Applicant  said  she  has  been  doing  better  for  the  last  18  months.  (Tr.  55)  She
believed her prognosis was good so long as she keeps going to therapy and complies
with  medication  recommendations.  (Tr.  47)  Her  stress  level  is  lower;  she  is  happily
married; she has a baby; and she has the support of her family and church. (Tr. 48, 50)
If she felt stress from work, she planned to talk to her therapist and family and take actions
to manage the stress. (Tr. 48-49) Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she is able to work at
home “a lot better,” and the stress from work is less. (Tr. 69) Her family support network
is closer now than it was in 2014 when she sought her most recent inpatient treatment.
(Tr. 49) Dr. F, Applicant’s husband, and her parents monitored her for signs of depression
during her pregnancy and after the birth of her baby. (Tr. 51)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s  supervisor  for  the  last  42  months  described  Applicant  as  dedicated,
friendly, having good judgment, reliable, and trustworthy. (Tr. 82-85) Her mental health
issues  have  not  affected  her  judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness.  (Tr.  85)  She
recommended approval of Applicant’s access to classified information. (Tr. 86)
A friend from church and a colleague at work described Applicant as reliable and
trustworthy, and as having good judgment. (Tr. 127-130) He recommended that Applicant
receive access to classified information. (Tr. 130)
Applicant’s  mother  indicated  Applicant’s  mood  and  mental  state  have  stabilized
and improved with her marriage, pregnancy, and birth of her daughter. (Tr. 95) Applicant
has  a  happy  marriage,  and  she  is  happier  now  than  she  was  before  2016  when  she
married. (Tr. 96, 103) She had some problems with stress at work when she was moved
from writing technical reports to purchasing because she was not getting enough support
or information to be successful. (Tr. 104) Applicant’s husband said:
[Applicant] has never been a rule breaker and is not the type of person to
[be] disrespect[ful to] authority. If she were to be put in a position of trust
with the U.S. Government, I have no doubt that she would be a valuable
asset in protecting our national secrets. She is very reliable and certainly
would not be considered dysfunctional. She has a strong moral character
and always wants to do the right thing. . . . I would not hesitate to trust [her]
with company-confidential information, and in the event that she is granted
a clearance, any classified information in which she has a need to know.

Applicant’s  mother  and  spouse  described  her  as  trustworthy,  reliable,  and
intelligent, honest, and as having good judgment. (Tr. 97, 101, 116-119; AE at 37-39) She
receives  support  from  her  family,  friends,  and  psychiatrist.  (Tr.  119)  Her  mother  and
spouse recommended that Applicant receive access to classified information. (Tr. 101,

"The   SOR  (Item  1)  alleges  under  Guideline  I   that  Applicant  was  diagnosed by a
licensed psychologist in  January 2019 with high functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder
without accompanying  intellectual  impairment and  with  generalized  anxiety; that  Applicant’s
condition  affects  his  judgment,   reliability,   and   trustworthiness;  and   that  he  has  a  fair
prognosis (SOR ¶ 1.a).  When he responded to the SOR, Applicant did  not dispute the
diagnosis, which  he stated was “in line with previous diagnoses,” but he indicated that his
condition should not in  and  of itself disqualify him from security clearance eligibility. He
indicated that he makes “multiple  careful judgment calls  in  a  workplace  environment where
tools  are  delicate,”   and   that  he  continues  to  have   no  issues  with  keeping  confidential
matters that come to his attention. (Item 3.)
After considering the FORM and Applicant’s rebuttal to the FORM (AE A), I make
the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 29-year-old unmarried college graduate who has worked for a defense
contractor since March 2015 as a groundskeeper at a defense agency. He seeks a security
clearance for duties as a mail clerk, where he would be handling classified information. He
earned his bachelor’s degree with honors in May 2013. (Items 3-6.)
Applicant was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome  as a youth. That condition is
currently  diagnosed  as  Autism  Spectrum  Disorder  (ASD)  under  the  Diagnostic  and
Statistical  Manual  of Mental Disorders,  5th  Edition  (DSM-5). ASD is properly diagnosed
when there are persistent deficits in  social communication and  social interaction across
multiple contexts,  as manifested by deficits in  social-emotional  reciprocity (e.g., abnormal
social approach; reduced sharing of interests,  emotions, or affect;  or failure to respond to
social interactions), and  restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior,  interest,  or activities, as
manifested by two or more of stereotyped  or repetitive motor movements;  insistence on
sameness,  inflexible  adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of nonverbal behavior;
highly restricted, fixated interests abnormal  in  intensity or focus; or hyper- or hypo-activity
to  sensory  input or unusual  interest in  sensory  aspects  of the  environment.  According  to  the
DSM-5, symptoms of ASD cause clinically significant impairment in  social, occupational,
other important areas of current functioning. Even those persons whose symptoms are
least  severe  (Level   1)  require  some  support   to  manage  their  deficits  in  social
communication  or their restricted, repetitive  behaviors, which  cause  significant interference
with  functioning  in   one   or  more  contexts.   See   the  American  Psychiatric  Association’s
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th  Edition (May 2013).  As a high-
functioning individual  with ASD without accompanying intellectual impairment, Applicant
prefers the DSM-4’s designation of Asperger’s Syndrome for his  disability  and  submits  that
it can be compensated for throughout life. (AE A.)
Applicant’s ASD has manifested itself in part in limited social interactions and few
friendships. He considers his married sister to be his closest friend. (Item 6.) He lives with
his mother in her home. (Items 2-4.) His father died in October 2019 following a period of
declining health that started in December 2018. (AE A.)
Applicant lived on campus during academic semesters while in college from August
2009  to  May  2013.  (Item  5.)  He  had  counseling  in  college,  reportedly  due  to  his  “odd
behaviors” and for not performing up to his perfectionist expectations. (Item 6.) He held
summer internships in 2010 and 2012 with his county’s board of elections where his father
worked. He worked as a receptionist and then associate in his college’s art gallery to fulfill a
work-study scholarship requirement during the academic semesters from 2010 to 2013. He
moved back in with his parents after he graduated from college in May 2013 and was
unemployed until he began working as a groundskeeper for his current employer in March
2015. He also volunteered part time at a bird sanctuary starting in July 2014. (Items 4, 6.)
On May 22, 2015, Applicant completed and executed a Questionnaire for National
Security Positions (SF 86) in application for a security clearance for a position as a mail
clerk for his employer. He responded negatively to whether he had consulted with a health
care professional for an emotional or mental health condition in the last seven years. (Item
4.)
On May 2, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for  the
Office of Personnel  Management (OPM).  Applicant disclosed that he had  received  written
reprimands  from  his  employer  in   2016  for   being  chronically  late  to  work;   that  he  was
reprimanded   after  he  intentionally  banged   his  head  on  a  dumpster  when  he  lost  or
misplaced his identification badge; and  that he was suspended  from work after becoming
upset about retrieving a leaf blower near the end  of his shift.  He  explained  that he felt
stressed  at  the  time,   which   he  attributed  to  his  Asperger’s  Syndrome.   Applicant  also
disclosed that he had  consulted with a counselor during his  senior year of college. During  a
subsequent  contact  with  the  investigator  on May  5,  2017,  Applicant  explained   that  the
counseling  in   college   was  for   anxiety  related  to  school   and   social  issues.  When  re-
contacted by the investigator on  May 12, 2017, Applicant explained  about his  work  incident
involving the leaf blower that he became upset because it was  near the  end  of his  shift, and
the weather was deteriorating. (Item  5.)
At the request of the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF), Applicant
was evaluated by an independent licensed psychologist on January 18, 2019, after records
showed some inappropriate behavior by Applicant in college (excessive questioning and
inability to control that behavior) and  at his workplace (angry outbursts, head-banging,
running through the workplace, and emotional dysregulation in front of customers), and
counseling  in  college  for  anxiety,  poor  sleep  patterns,  and  help  with  social  skills.  The
psychologist reviewed some records provided by the DOD CAF, interviewed Applicant, and
administered a Psychological Assessment Inventory to him. (Item 6.)
Applicant told the psychologist that he had not had any counseling for his ASD since
college, but that he has been taking an anti-depressant for the past several years to help
him  with  his  moods  and  behavioral  outbursts.  Applicant  acknowledged  his  history  of
reprimands at work for tardiness and emotional outbursts, although he also reported some
improvement lately on those issues. The psychologist observed that Applicant had some
difficulty  articulating  his  thoughts,  and  while  he  was  pleasant,  he  was  anxious  and
frequently requested her feedback about his performance. When asked whether he had a
mental  health  problem,  Applicant  admitted  he  had  social  anxiety  and  some  addictive
behaviors. He disclosed that when he becomes upset with himself, he feels stressed, and
that he had engaged in self-harming behaviors in the past, including banging his head and
poking himself with a sharp object. Applicant denied attempting any self-injurious behavior
since the incident at work where he was reprimanded by his employer. He reported that he
is easily distracted, has experienced anxiety about his future, and does not cope well when
his routine is disrupted or when he feels uncomfortable. The results of the Psychological
Assessment Inventory were consistent with “significant problems with [Applicant’s] thinking
and  concentration,  as  well  as  ruminative  worry  and  distress.”  by  Applicant.  The
psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with  high  functioning  ASD  without  accompanying
intellectual impairment and with generalized anxiety. She opined that Applicant’s ASD is a
condition that affects his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and explained:
His  high  functioning  autism  affects  how  he  perceives  information  and
communicates with others, and his coping mechanism is to ask questions
until he feels sufficiently reassured that he understands and his uncertainty
and  anxiety  about  being  perfect  is  alleviated.  Given  that  [ASD]  is  a
permanent condition and he does not have an intellectual impairment, his
prognosis is fair. Although [Applicant] is capable of following directions and
he  has  an  awareness  of  his  symptoms,  he  will  likely  continue  to  have
problems  with  his  psychosocial  functioning,  perceptions,  and  decision
making.
Yet the psychologist also found Applicant’s condition to be relatively stable at the time, and
she concluded he was not in immediate need of treatment. (Item 6.)
Applicant strongly denies that his ASD should disqualify him from having a security
clearance. He maintains that he has demonstrated his trustworthiness and reliability on the
job by making “multiple careful judgment calls in a workplace environment where tools are
delicate and there are watchful eyes on all parts of the premises;” and by calmly completing
his tasks. He denies having had any problems with keeping confidential matters about his
job, and there is no evidence to the contrary. (Item 3.) Applicant presented no evidence
from others about his judgment and reliability on the job.
In  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  claims  made  of  his  “odd
behaviors” and physical outbursts in class in college were “exaggerated and un-nuanced,”
and he was not ordered to counseling for such behaviors. He explained that his counseling
was voluntary for stresses in his life as a student and that at most he asked more questions
than his peers or talked more in group discussions. Applicant did not dispute the workplace
incidents, which he explained happened during a particularly stressful time at home due to
his father’s “ill-tempered behavior,”  including “open fits of rage” about being forced into
early  retirement.  His  father’s  impatience  and  verbal  anger  directed  at  Applicant  in  the
evenings “would become the baggage that [Applicant would] carry into the workplace the
following mornings.” Applicant described the incidents as “deeply isolated” and  “particular
to substantially stressful and unique situations at the workplace, when [he] was still in the
midst  of  then-newer  routines  a  few  years  ago  and  made  more  vulnerable  by  [his]
Asperger’s – a condition that can put an inordinate amount of importance on routine and
order.”  He  became  upset  about  the  leaf  blower  because  his  “perfectionist-self”  was
stressed by finding things out of order, and he feared reprisal for not having a “major tool
accounted for at that time.” He surmised that his head-banging on a metal dumpster at
work was “an overreaction to something that a newer then-on-site supervisor said, likely a
joke that [he] took too seriously.” (AE A.)
When his father was hospitalized in December 2018, Applicant began to pursue
some solutions to deal with the stress at home. He began to drive himself to work after
having relied on his father to drive him to work for the previous two years. In June 2019, his
family had a counseling session, but Applicant primarily found support through a program at
work for people with disabilities where he had meetings with a job coach and other staff “to
process  other  issues  and  otherwise  decompress.”  Throughout  the  summer  2019,  he
engaged in an exercise routine at a fitness center at his worksite to relieve some of his daily
stresses as his father’s health declined. He submits that these efforts “bore frequent and
fruitful  results”  in  his  employment,”  and  that  he  has  learned  to  be  more  accepting  of
unpredictable  situations  or  react  in  calmer  ways  (AE  A.)  He  provided  no  details  or
corroboration from management or co-workers in that regard. Applicant submits that he can
continue to make strides in compensating for his ASD, and learn to suppress repetitive
behaviors in public. His job is of vital importance to him. He plans to seek counseling after
the current virus pandemic is resolved, but he was not specific as to the source or nature of
the counseling. (AE A.)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  admitted  the  factual  allegation  in  Sub
Paragraph 1.a. of the SOR, but denied the factual allegation of Sub Paragraph 2.b., with
explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility
for a security clearance.
Applicant  is  29  years  old,  and  married.  He  has  a  Bachelor’s  degree  in  science
and electrical engineering. He works for a defense contractor. (TR at page 30 line 19 to
page 38 line 3, and GX 1 at page 5.)
Guideline I –  Psychological Conditions
1.a.  In  November  of  2013,  more  than  seven  years  ago,  Applicant  received
voluntary,  inpatient  psychiatric  treatment  for  a  condition  diagnosed  as  “Schizophrenia,
paranoid type.” (TR at page 19 line 3 to page 24 line 3, at page 40 line 23 to page 42
line 2, at page 44 line 17 to page 46 line 7, and GX 2 at page 4.)
1.b.  In  June  of  2019,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed  psychologist.
Although  this  psychologist  could  not  “confirm  his  [Applicant’s]  former  diagnosis  of
Schizophrenia,”  she  found  that  Applicant  “has  experienced  unusual  perception
experiences,  distortions  in  thinking,  and  functional  impairment,  which  support  a
diagnosis of Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder.” (GX 3
at  page  9.)  This  psychologist  further  concluded  that  there  was  “concern  regarding  his
[Applicant’s] trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment.” (GX 3 at page 10.)
To counter this assessment, Applicant has offered a March 2020 evaluation of a
licensed  clinical  psychologist.  She  discounts  any  history  of  Schizophrenia,  but  rather
attributes any mental-health symptoms to withdrawal from a prescribed drug he used to
treat Depression. (AppX F at page 7, see also TR at page 46 line 16 to page 47 line 11.)
Her  “Diagnostic  Impressions”  are,  “Persistent  Depressive  Disorder,  with  Anxious
Distress, early onset, in full remission,” and a “History of Major Depressive Disorder, in
full remission.” (Id.) Furthermore, this psychologist opined that, “At this time, it appears .
. . [Applicant] does not pose a threat to receiving classified status based on his current
psychological functioning.”
Applicant  is  also  currently  receiving  “weekly  psychotherapy  sessions  .  .  .  for
symptoms of anxiety and depression.” (AppX A.)
",False
"Applicant  is  a  27-year-old  laborer,  employed  by  a  government  contractor  since
November 2017. He graduated from high school in 2012 and completed some college
courses. He served in the U.S. Navy from 2013 to 2015. While on active duty, Applicant
was  disciplined  for  falsifying  logs  in  2015,  and  reduced  in  rate.  He  was  honorably
discharged. He is unmarried.
The SOR alleges under Guideline I that Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized in
June 2015 based on referral from his Navy command after he showed a noose he created
to  his  supervisor  with  suicidal  threats.  He  was  diagnosed  with  adjustment  disorder,
dependent  personality  disorder,  and  borderline  personality  disorder.  The  SOR  also
alleges Applicant was evaluated by a psychologist in February 2020, and diagnosed with
untreated  borderline  personality  disorder  and  major  depressive  disorder,  recurrent,
moderate. The psychologist noted that Applicant has a history of suicidal ideations and
self-harm  when  presented  with  significant  stressors,  coupled  with  a  lack  of  recent
psychiatric  treatment  or  robust  support  structure.  He  opined  that  Applicant  posed  a
significant  risk  to  protecting  classified  information  due  to  his  judgment,  reliability  and
trustworthiness. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations.
Applicant  was  first  referred  to  a  mental  health  professional  on  May  8,  2013,  for
screening after completing a submarine screening questionnaire. The provider noted no
evidence  of  a  clinically  significant  disorder  of  thought,  mood,  or  anxiety  based  on  the
Applicant’s  answers  to  screening  questions,  and  he  was  found  to  be  suitable  for
submarine duty. Applicant returned to the mental health facility for a follow-up on May 14
and  June  12,  2015.  In  June  2015,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  adjustment  disorder,
dependent personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder. He was referred for
additional treatment.
The  DCSA  CAF  referred  Applicant  for  a  psychiatric  evaluation  on  February  7,
2020. During the evaluation, Applicant described the incident on his submarine with the
noose  and  stated  that  as  a  result,  he  was  hospitalized  for  two  to  three  weeks.  He
superficially  cut  himself  during  his  hospitalization  and  again  in  2017  after  his  fiancée
reported to him that she had been raped. Applicant saw his psychologist for outpatient
medication management  but did  not  seek psychiatric  treatment  after  being discharged
from the Navy in 2015. Applicant expressed that medications typically work on a placebo
effect, and that one has to believe in them to work saying “the mind has a lot of healing.”
Applicant was fired from a fast-food employment in 2017 after failing a drug test.
He  admitted  to  using  marijuana  to  assist  with  his  sleep  and  to  manage  migraine
headaches. He stated that he stopped using marijuana after being fired.
Applicant was diagnosed by the DCSA CAF’s evaluating psychologist with major
depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate, and borderline personality disorder. Applicant
attempts to control his condition with self-help methods, and does not believe he needs
ongoing professional care. Applicant’s prognosis is “guarded,” and Applicant’s judgment
and reliability may be impaired if his mental health problems are not treated. The evaluator
suggested Applicant seek psychiatric treatment and education on coping and emotional
management skills.
In  his Answer to  the SOR,  Applicant agreed with  the  psychological  assessment
and  stated  that  he  was  dealing  with  his  issues  and  has  been  continuously  improving.
Although Applicant has access to free mental health counseling from his employer, he
has  not  seen  a  professional  since  2015.  He  acknowledged  that  he  is  dealing  with
depression and that his moods can change rapidly, but his 2015 counseling was helpful
and he has a family that he lives with and other people to help him. He noted that he was
working hard to improve himself and as an employee, and has taken the initiative to learn
the skills necessary to gain a supervisory position.

"Applicant  admitted  all  allegations  in  the  SOR  without  explanation.  He  did  not
address  the  paragraphs  (¶¶  2.e,  2.i,  2.m,  2.o,  and  4.b)  that  cross-alleged  conduct
alleged  under  other  guidelines,  but  since  the  underlying  allegations  were  admitted,  I
consider  the  cross-allegations  admitted  as  well.  The  admissions  are  incorporated  into
the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  was  born  in October 1990.  He  is 30  years  old.  He  has  never married
and  he  has  no  children.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  spring  2008.  He  started
college that fall and earned a bachelor’s degree in 2014. He has worked for his current
employer and  clearance  sponsor, a  large  defense  contractor,  since  April 2017.  During
most  of   the   time   since   he   graduated   from   college,  Applicant  worked   for  other
contractors at  the  same  location,  with  some  gaps in employment when  contracts ended.
(Item  3)
Guidelines J &  G:
During   Applicant’s  time   in  college,  he   incurred   multiple   infractions,   allegedly   for
alcohol-related   conduct,  resulting   in  discipline   from   university   authorities.   He  also
incurred  multiple  alcohol-related  arrests  both  during and after his time in college.
The   first  infraction   was  in  October  2008,   after  Applicant   and   his  college
roommate   were  allegedly   playing   a   drinking   game   in  their   dorm   room.  Applicant
explained  in  his  background  interview  that they  had  been  playing  the  game  with  water,
and  not  with  beer.  Nevertheless,  he  was ordered  to  participate  in  an  alcohol-awareness
class,  which  he   did.   (Item   4   at  2-3)  The   university   registrar’s   office  recorded   an
infraction   for  possession   of  “alcohol  paraphernalia”  for  which  Applicant   was  found
“responsible,”  and   that  he   completed   an   “educational  paper”   as  a   sanction.  (Item   8)
(SOR ¶ 2.b)
On  three  additional occasions over the  next  two  years (March 2009, September
2010, and  November 2010), Applicant engaged  in  drinking  in  his dorm  room. (Item  4  at
3)  These   instances  violated   university   policy   prohibiting   underage   drinking.  He  was
ultimately  placed  on  disciplinary  probation  and  removed  from  student housing. (Item  8)
(SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.d, and  2.f)
In   September  2010,  also  while   underage,  Applicant  was  driving   home   after  a
night  out  drinking   with   friends   when   he   was  pulled   over for   speeding.  He  was  given   a
breathalyzer   and   registered   a   0.07   blood   alcohol content  (BAC).  He  was  arrested   and
charged   with   a   misdemeanor offense   of   having   an   unlawful blood   alcohol level (under
21)  of  0.05   or  higher,  while   operating   a   motor  vehicle.  He   pleaded   no   contest  in
December 2010, and  he  was ordered  to  attend  alcohol  counseling  and  a  DUI  program.
His driver’s license  was also  suspended  for a  month. (Item  3  at 39-40; Item  4  at 6)(SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 2.e)
Applicant reported on his SCA that he attended alcohol counseling, with Ms. W,
from  January  to  April  2011,  and  noted  that  it  was  court  ordered.  (Item  4  at  46)  In  his
PSI, he generally referenced his counseling with Ms. W, and noted that she had advised
him  to  abstain  from  alcohol.  (Item  4  at  7)  SOR  ¶  2.g,  which  Applicant  admitted,  also
alleges  that  he  was  diagnosed  at  the  time  with  alcohol  abuse.  Notwithstanding  the
admission,  there  is  no  documented  record  evidence  of  either  the  diagnosis  or  the
treatment in 2011.
On or about September 8, 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving
under  the  influence  (DUI)  with  a  0.14  BAC.  He  reported  in  his  PSI  that  he  and  his
girlfriend had a disagreement in a campus parking lot because they had to move the car
to another lot, and Applicant had been drinking and did not want to drive. (Item 4 at 3)
University police came to the scene and detained him before turning him over to county
police. He spent the night in jail. (Item 4 at 10) Applicant went to court in March 2013,
and entered a no contest plea to the DUI charge. He was convicted, ordered to attend
alcohol  treatment,  a  DUI  program,  and  a  victim-impact  panel,  and  his  driver’s  license
was suspended for a year. (Item 3 at 41-42; Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at 8; Item 7)(SOR ¶¶
1.b, 2.i)
In  addition  to  the  criminal sanctions  resulting  from  this event,  Applicant was  also
found   responsible   by   university   authorities   for  violating   university   policy   regarding
individuals under the  age  of  21  concerning  possession  and/or consumption  of  alcohol,
among   other university   policy   violations  regarding   student  conduct.   University   records,
as  reviewed   by   an   employee   of   the   registrar’s  office,  indicate   that  he   received
disciplinary   probation,   participated   in  a   counseling   assessment,   and   completed   court
sanctions. (Item  8 at 2) (SOR ¶ 2.h)
SOR ¶  2.j, which is also  based  on  review  of  university  records,  alleges that on  or
about  September   17,  2012,  Applicant  was  found   responsible,  sanctioned,  and
suspended   for  non-compliance   with   an   official  request,   complicity   in  violating   the
student code of  conduct,  disruptive  conduct, and hazing. (Item  8) SOR ¶  2.j also alleges
that  Applicant  “had  consumed  alcohol prior to  this  offense.” This  “offense”  is not detailed
anywhere in the  record, even  in Applicant’s PSI,  unless  it is already  covered  in SOR ¶
2.i. (Item  4  at  3)  Notwithstanding  Applicant’s admission  to  SOR ¶  2.j, it is  unclear what
“conduct” or “offense” is addressed  in  the  allegation, and  the details of  the  sanctions  are
undocumented.
Applicant reported on his SCA that he attended additional court-ordered alcohol
counseling  with  Ms.  W  from  January  to  May  2013.  (Item  45-46).  This  was  part  of  his
sentence for the September 2012 DUI offense discussed above. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.i) In his
PSI, Applicant generally referenced his counseling with Ms. W, and noted that she had
advised him to abstain from alcohol. (Item 4 at 7) SOR ¶ 2.k, which Applicant admitted,
also alleges that he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Notwithstanding the admission,
there  is  no  documented  record  evidence  of  either  the  diagnosis  or  the  treatment  in
2013.
In  September  2013,  Applicant  was  again  found  responsible  by  university
authorities for violation of university policy regarding guests and alcohol, and complicity
in  violating  the  student  code  of  conduct.  He  was  required  to  take  a  course  and  was
reprimanded.  (Item  8)  Applicant  reported  in  his  PSI  that  this  concerned  a  party  in  his
dorm  room  that  was  broken  up  by  the  RA.  (Item  4  at  3)  (SOR  ¶  2.l)  While  Applicant
admitted  the  allegation,  there  is  no  documentation  in  the  record  to  detail  the
circumstances  of  this  incident,  alcohol-related  or  otherwise.  There  is  nothing  in  the
record to reflect that Applicant himself was drinking at the time.
In  January 2014,  Applicant  was  detained  by university police  after an argument
with  his  girlfriend.  He  had  been  drinking.  (Item  4  at  9)  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  2.m)  The  record
does  not  reflect  that  he  was  arrested  as  a  result.  He  was  again  disciplined  by  the
university for his disruptive conduct, and placed on probation. (Item 8 at 2)(SOR ¶ 2.n)
Applicant graduated from the university in spring 2014.
In November 2016, Applicant was driving home when he fell asleep at a red light.
He was awakened by police, and arrested for DUI after he refused a field sobriety test
and a breathalyzer. (Item 4 at 6) In May 2017, Applicant pleaded no contest to the DUI
charge  and  was  convicted.  He  was  sentenced  to  10  days  of  confinement,  ordered  to
attend  a  16-week  substance  abuse  program,  a  DUI  program,  and  weekly  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA) meetings.  He  received  one  year of  probation,  was  required  to  install
an  ignition  interlock  device  on  his  car,  and  his  driver’s  license  was  revoked  for  five
years. (Item 3 at 42-43; Item 6 at 6-7; Item 7)(SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.o)
After spending two days in jail, Applicant spent eight days in an inpatient alcohol
facility in May 2017. His initial assessment by the counselor, Mr. S, was a diagnosis of
severe alcohol use disorder. Applicant disclosed prior marijuana use that ended several
years before, and drinking several times a week from age 18 until the time of his most
recent  DUI  arrest,  in  November  2016.  On  discharge  from  the  16-week  program
(including  outpatient  treatment)  in  August  2017,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with
polysubstance  use  disorder,  in  early,  partial  remission.  He  was  advised  to  maintain
abstinence from drugs and alcohol. (Item 5 at 17-22) (SOR ¶ 2.p)
Guideline E
Applicant submitted  his SCA in  September 2017,  and  had  his initial background
interview  (PSI)  in March  2018. The  summary of  his  PSI reflects that Applicant discussed
his  high   school,  community   college,  and   undergraduate   education.   It   also  states  that
“after the Subject [Applicant] provided  he had  no disciplinary issues while at [his college,
identified   by   name],   the   Subject  was  confronted”  with   his  numerous  disciplinary
incidents, including  those  alleged  at SOR ¶¶  2.b, 2.c, 2.d, 2.h, 2.l, and  2.n. (Item  3  at 2-
4) SOR ¶  4.a  alleged  that Applicant falsified  material facts when  he  stated  to  the  OPM
investigator that  he  had  no  disciplinary  actions at  his university, when  in  fact  he  did,  and
deliberately   sought  to   conceal  that   information.  Applicant  admitted   SOR  ¶   4.a   without
explanation.
In March 2019, the DOD CAF sent Applicant an interrogatory about his history of
alcohol  involvement.  (Item  5)  He  reported  drinking  one  to  six beers,  twice  a  week,  on
weekends, between November 2016 (his most recent DUI) and Christmas 2017. (Item 5
at  3-4)  Applicant’s  acknowledged  drinking  up  to  at  least  Christmas  2017  was  after  he
was advised to abstain from alcohol use as recently as August 2017, by Mr. S., in the
substance abuse program. (SOR ¶ 2.q)
Guideline I
In  January  2020,  DOD  CAF  referred  Applicant  for  a  psychological  evaluation.
The  evaluator,  Dr.  B,  a  Ph.D.  licensed  clinical  psychologist  and  board-certified
neuropsychologist, reviewed Applicant’s 2017 counseling records and his 2018 report of
investigation  (ROI)  from  2018,  including  his  background  interview  summaries.  The
evaluation  report  reflects  that  Applicant  reported  his  most  recent  use  of  alcohol  was
Christmas 2018, not Christmas 2017; he said he consumed five or six drinks  at a time
which he also estimated as the “normal” amount of consumption  for the average person.
(Item  6 at 6-7)
In her report (Item 6 at 8), Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder,
severe (provisional). (SOR ¶ 2.r) She concluded as follows:
While  I  cannot  confirm   a   personality   disorder  in  this  case,  it  is  worth   of
note   that  I  identified   this  applicant  as  having   an   overly   inflated   sense   of
self-worth   and   lack  of  acceptance   for  his  inappropriate   illegal  behaviors
historically,  which  could   be   indicative   of   the   very   diagnosis  of   antisocial
personality   disorder  indicated   by   his  psychological  testing.  However,
based  on  the  medical records and  history  of  this applicant,  a  diagnosis of
alcohol  use   disorder,  severe,  is  certainly   likely.  Though   he   reports  not
drinking   for  a   little  over  a   year,  he   has  a   recent  history   of   giving   varying
information  about his alcohol intake  and  his  general  lack of insight into  the
problematic  behavior is concerning   to   me   as   a   clinician.  I  have   concerns
regarding   his  risk  of  relapse.  He   is  not  in   treatment,  and   has   received
treatment  only   when   mandated   by   this  [sic]  courts   and   his  inconsistent
reporting   of  use   leads  me   to   believe   he   still   may   be   abusing   alcohol;
however, at minimum  it raises  concerns  about his  candor  and  as  such  his
reliability/judgment/trustworthiness.  His  insight  is   poor.  (Item   6   at  8)
(Emphasis added)
When  Applicant  answered  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations  without
providing  any  explanation  or  comment.  He  also  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  He
therefore did not offer any evidence to mitigate any security concerns established by the
Government.
",False
"The SOR alleges under Guideline I (SOR ¶ 1.a) that Applicant received mental-
health treatment from approximately May 2017 to December 2018 for  diagnosed major
depressive  disorder-single  episode,  other specified  anxiety disorders, cannabis abuse,
and  alcohol  dependence  in  remission;  under  Guideline  G  that  Applicant  consumed
alcohol at times to excess and intoxication, from age 20 to at least February 2020 (SOR
¶  2.a)  and  that  a  licensed  psychologist  determined  in  February  2020  that  Applicant’s
current  and  continued  level  of  alcohol  use  could  impact  his  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness (SOR ¶ 2.b); under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana from age
18 to at least February 2020 (SOR ¶ 3.a) and that he abused non-prescribed Ativan in
January 2017 and was fired from his job after testing positive for the drug (SOR ¶ 3.b);
and under Guideline F that, as of the issuance of the SOR on October 27, 2020, Applicant
owed  charged-off  debt  totaling  $24,444  on  four  accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  4.a-4.d);  a  $406
collection debt (SOR ¶ 4.e); a mortgage debt of $152,484 in foreclosure and $25,239 past
due (SOR ¶ 4.f); and a $25 medical collection debt (SOR ¶ 4.g).
When Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations except
for the mortgage delinquency (SOR ¶ 4.f) and possibly the medical collection debt, which
he had been unable to confirm. He indicated that the mortgage loan was refinanced in
October  2020   and   is   no   longer  in  foreclosure  proceedings.  Regarding   the   Guideline   I
concern,   he   explained   that  he   was  currently   in  mental-health   treatment.   As  for   the
Guideline   G  concerns,  Applicant  stated   that  he   tries  to   drink  responsibly   when   he
consumes alcohol,  and  that if  he  had  continued  drinking  at the  same  level as February
2020,  it  “could  have   an   impact   on   [his]  judgment   and   reliability,  but  not  concerning
classified  information.”  He acknowledged  that he  has used  cannabis from  about age  18
to   the   present,   at  a   level  and   frequency   that  has   fluctuated   over   the   years,  but  he
explained   that  he   is  now   a   medical  marijuana   patient.   Applicant  admitted   that  he   had
taken  the  Ativan  to  relax  while  being  unaware  of the  possible  consequences for his non-
prescribed  use. About  his financial issues,  Applicant explained  that   he  and  his spouse
needed  to  settle  their  mortgage  foreclosure  situation  before  resolving  other debts and  that
they  are seeking  legal advice as to  the  best course of  action  to  settle  their  debts.  He cited
several  factors  (loss  of   employment,   an   unplanned   pregnancy,   a   knee   injury,  his
underemployment, his spouse’s car  accident  and  her drug  rehabilitation)  as  causes  of his
financial difficulties.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old, married, and the father of two sons, ages six and eight.
A high school graduate, he completed Class A commercial driver training in December
2014 and took a five-week design/drafting course in 2018. He was employed full time by
a defense contractor as a mechanical draftsman learner for about 11 days from April 2018
to May 2018, when he was laid off for lack of a security clearance while his application
for security clearance eligibility was pending. He indicates that he is subject to rehire if
his clearance eligibility is adjudicated favorably. (GE 1; Tr. 25.)
Substance Use  and Psychological Issues
Applicant started drinking alcohol in high school and using cannabis shortly after
graduating  from  high  school  at  age  18.  (Tr.  37.)  He  has  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency since then, including four times a week from ages 18 to 38. (GE 3.) However,
there were also times of abstention from marijuana for as long as three or four years. (Tr.
39.) Applicant purchased marijuana for his own consumption, at times on a weekly basis.
(Tr. 39.) He has continued to use marijuana, albeit now with a medical marijuana card,
and  to  use  alcohol.  He  engaged  in heavy drinking from ages  20 to  25, although  there
have been times when he has abstained, and also times of responsible consumption. (GE
3; Tr. 47.)
In June 1993, after Applicant consumed 12 beers to intoxication while socializing
with friends, he and his friends stole some items from unlocked vehicles and garages.
Felony  burglary  and  larceny  charges  were  filed  against  Applicant  but  eventually  not
prosecuted.  After  Applicant  consumed  ten  beers  at  a  bar  in  October  1997,  he  was
involved in an altercation with two men. He paid a fine for misdemeanor assault. In July
1999, Applicant was arrested for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin).
The drug had been left in his vehicle by a friend in May 1999. Applicant admitted illegal
possession, and  in December 1999, he  was sentenced  to  six  months in jail (deferred),
one   year  of  probation,  and   a   $500   fine.   (GEs  1-2,  6.)   Applicant   refrained   from   any
marijuana  use  while  he  was on  probation  because  he  was subject  to  random  urinalysis.
A  year or two  later, he  resumed  using  marijuana  with  a  new  roommate, whom  Applicant
indicates was “a regular smoker.” (Tr. 38.)
Applicant was employed as a dealer and table games supervisor at a casino from
October 1996 to March 2001 and again from September 2001 to March 2014 when he
was terminated following a few incidents involving co-workers or patrons. In September
2015,  Applicant  began  working  as  a  commercial  truck  driver.  Applicant  refrained  from
using any marijuana for close to three years while in training for, and then working as a
truck driver. (Tr. 41-42.) He was terminated from that job in January 2017 after he failed
a random urinalysis. He tested positive for taking Ativan that his spouse gave him from
her  prescription.  He  had  been  experiencing  considerable  anxiety  related  to  some
accidents on the job, and neither he nor his spouse realized it was a banned substance.
(GEs 1, 6.) He had used the Ativan as a sleep aid approximately three times in December
2016. (Tr. 46.)
Depressed and experiencing anxiety to the point where his spouse was concerned
about his mental health, Applicant voluntarily received outpatient mental-health treatment
from  late  May  2017  to  mid-December  2018  for  diagnosed  major  depressive  disorder-
single  episode,  other  specified  anxiety  disorders,  cannabis  abuse-uncomplicated,  and
alcohol dependence, in remission. He reported on intake that he drank about six beers
per week and was “self-medicating” with marijuana four times a week. (Tr. 40.) He was
prescribed  Zoloft  and  advised  to  cease  using  marijuana  and  to  continue  sobriety  with
respect to his alcohol use. The clinical records do not expressly indicate that he was told
to cease using alcohol. However, Applicant testified that the psychiatrist told him to stop
drinking.  (Tr.  60.)  During  a  session  on  June  7,  2017,  Applicant  complained  of  anger
management  issues  and  worry  about  finances.  He  reported  medical  marijuana  use  to
treat a physical condition and occasional alcohol use. At each session, the psychiatrist
advised him to decrease and stop using marijuana, and discussed “the risks of marijuana
with mood worsening [in the] long run.” With adjustments to his Zoloft and the additions
of Trazodone and Buspar to his medication regimen, Applicant’s mental health improved.
During a session on September 18, 2017, Applicant reported that he had decreased his
marijuana use in that he had smoked the drug only once in the last month. He declined
therapy beyond an initial session because of his finances. (GEs 2-3, 6.) Applicant asserts
that  he  reduced  his  consumption  of  alcohol  “quite  a  bit”  while  in  treatment  with  the
psychiatrist because he was taking psychiatric medications. (Tr. 35.)
Applicant refrained from marijuana use while looking for work and then in training
to work for a defense contractor because he did not want it to be held against him by a
future  employer.  He  passed  a  hair  follicle  test  administered  for  employment  with  the
defense contractor. (Tr. 43-44.) On March 29, 2018, Applicant completed a Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF 86) to work for a defense contractor. He disclosed that
he  had  been  in  treatment  since  approximately  June  2017  for  “borderline  personality
disorder”  and  that  he  had  been  arrested  in  1993,  1997,  and  1999.  In  response  to  an
inquiry concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years, Applicant reported that he
had failed a random drug test after taking some of his spouse’s anti-anxiety medication
three  or  four  times  in  a  week  in  December  2016  while  struggling  with  major  anxiety
because he had recently witnessed a suicide by a man stepping out in front of a truck
ahead of him, and, on another occasion, he had locked the brakes on his truck when cut
off by another vehicle on the highway. He denied any other illegal use of a drug in the
previous seven years. (GE 1.)
On June 12, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he had received medication
management  for  “borderline  personality  disorder”  with  symptoms  of  depression  and
anxiety  for  the  past  year,  and  that  he  had  attended  one  session  of  therapy  at  the
recommendation of his psychiatrist. (GE 6.) The session occurred on June 8, 2017. (GE
2.) There is no indication that  Applicant told the OPM investigator about his marijuana
use  or  that  he  was  asked  about  any  use  of  cannabis.  Applicant  explained  to  the
investigator  that  he  elected  not  to  pursue  therapy  because  he  felt  better  on  his
medications, and it was expensive. Applicant discussed his use of his spouse’s Ativan in
December  2016,  and  his  positive  drug  screen  that  led  to  the  loss  of  his  commercial
driver’s license and employment as a truck driver. (GE 6.)
Applicant stopped seeing the psychiatrist after December 2018. He elected instead
to  have  his  psychiatric  medications  prescribed  and  monitored  by  his  primary  care
physician.  His  primary  care  physician  suggested  that  he  apply  for  the  state’s  medical
marijuana program  to  address some physical  ailments. Applicant  obtained his medical
marijuana  card  in  August  2019,  which  allows  him  to  purchase  up  to  2½  ounces  of
marijuana  per  month  from  state-authorized  dispensaries.  (Tr.  35,  40,  66-67.)  His
physician  has  to  annually  recertify  his  need  for  marijuana.  (Tr.  40.)  Applicant  is  in  his
second year of the program. (Tr. 66.)
During the course of its background investigation, the OPM obtained the records
of  Applicant’s  treatment  with  his  former  psychiatrist.  In  early  2020,  the  DCSA  CAF
referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation to a licensed psychologist because of
his history of alcohol and cannabis use and his mental-health treatment reflected in the
psychiatrist’s records. During the February 29, 2020 psychological evaluation, Applicant
reported using both tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD for medical issues under his
state’s medical marijuana program, about three times a day, as prescribed by his primary
care  physician  “as  needed  for  any  symptoms  that  may  arise.”  (Tr.  43.)  Applicant’s
judgment  and  insight  were  assessed  as  adequate,  and  he  appeared  relaxed  for  his
interview. He reported no current issues with symptoms of depression, euphoria, mood
disturbance,  or  anxiety,  but  he  indicated  that  he  had  stress  because  of  some  life
circumstances, including involving his spouse, who, after totaling his car in an accident in
August  2019,  checked  herself  into  a  rehabilitation  program.  He  reported  that  he  was
working for his uncle at the time, but had to quit to care for his sons. (GE 2.)
During the evaluation, Applicant admitted that he had consumed alcohol on a daily
basis before his spouse went into rehabilitation. His uncle kept beer at work, and he would
sometimes drink with  his uncle at the  end  of the  work day. Applicant  would then  drink at
home  with  his wife, a  half  to  a  full  pint  of liquor per night.  Following  his spouse’s return
from   her  rehabilitation   program   in   mid-November  2019,  Applicant  limited   his  alcohol
consumption   to   once  every   two   weeks,  and   generally   beer rather than  hard  liquor. He
refrained  from  drinking  in his spouse’s presence, but a  friend  would share a  six-pack with
him  when  his spouse  was out of  the  house. Applicant reported  having  consumed  three
beers  and  two  nips  of liquor with  his brother the  night  before  his  February  2020  evaluation,
but no  drinking  for 1½  weeks before that. He stated  that had  abstained  for two  or three
weeks before  his use  1½  weeks prior to his evaluation.  He explained  that  he  did  not find
it  difficult   to   maintain  that   level  of  consumption.  As  for  his  use   of  medical  marijuana,
Applicant  indicated   he   generally   smoked   or  vaped   three   times  a   day:  first  thing   in   the
morning,  after  work,  and   before  going   to   sleep   at  night.   The   psychologist  opined   that
Applicant did  not currently  meet  the  diagnostic criteria  for a  diagnosable mental-health
condition  and  that  the symptoms  that led  him  to  seek psychiatric treatment in  2017  were
sufficiently   managed   with   medication.  The   alcohol  dependence   diagnosis  of   2017
appeared   to   be  based   on   Applicant’s previous heavy  drinking   when  he  was in his 20s.
The   psychologist  nonetheless  expressed   some   concern   about  Applicant’s  recent  daily
drinking.  Although   noting   the   absence   of   any   alcohol-related   consequences   and   the
reduction  in  Applicant’s drinking  since  November  2019,  the  psychologist opined  that  “his
continued  use  of alcohol does not reflect good  judgment  in light of his history  of  alcohol
dependence, and  this could be  detrimental to  his judgment,  reliability  or trustworthiness
concerning   classified   information.”  As  for  Applicant’s  use   of   medical  marijuana,  “while
permitted  under the laws of his state, [it] is exclusionary for granting a security clearance
under federal guidelines.” (GE 2.)
In May 2020, Applicant’s brother passed away. Applicant “got into a bad habit of
drinking.” (Tr. 61-62.) After drinking heavily that summer, including up to 12 to 15 drinks
of beer and a few nips over the course of a day while on vacation, he realized that he had
to  get  his drinking under control.  (Tr.  62-63.) Applicant  began  weekly treatment with  a
licensed professional mental-health counselor in November 2020. (AE D; tr. 37.) In May
2021, the counselor opined that Applicant had not previously truly addressed his trauma
and mood-related history before now, and that his reported “co-existing issues such as
alcohol  use,  excessive  spending  of  money,  etc.  are  all  symptoms  of  this.”  She
acknowledged  the  DOD’s  concerns  “regarding  the  issues  outlined  that  could  impact
[Applicant’s]  judgment,
truthfulness  regarding  classified
information,” and  indicated  that  he  has  started  the  process,  “with  a  genuine  intent,”  to
work  on  improving  his  situation.  She  noted  that  some  of  the  DOD’s  concerns  had
improved, although she did not elaborate in that regard about which issues. She did not
provide a diagnosis but addressed his current need for time in therapy and medication
management to address his issues, including his substance-use issues. (AE D.)
impulses,  reliability,  and
As  of  his  May  2021  hearing,  Applicant’s  psychiatric  medications  were  being
monitored by a nurse practitioner. (Tr. 33-34.) Applicant testified that he has worked on
his drinking, and that he does not consume as much alcohol as he had in the past. (Tr.
31.) About his current consumption, Applicant testified:
I might have  about five  drinks a  week. My  wife  doesn’t allow  me  to  have
drinks at the  house  here very much. But every once  in awhile, I’ll  meet a
friend out and we’ll have a beer or two. Maybe a beer and a nip – fishing or
something. (Tr. 48.)
As  to   why  he   continues  to   consume   alcohol  despite   his  previous  diagnosis  of
alcohol dependence  –  in remission  and  being  advised  to  stop  drinking  by  a  psychiatrist,
Applicant responded,  “Don’t know. I’ve  always drank just casually. I’ve  never seen  it as
being  a  problem  if  I only  have  two  or three  drinks. It’s when  I get carried  away.” (Tr. 60-
61.)  Sometime  in  April 2021, Applicant  consumed  nine  or ten  beers  while  socializing  with
friends in his own  home. He admits that he  “definitely  was over the  legal limit at some
point during the day.” (Tr. 64-65.) Applicant believes that he can control his drinking. (Tr.
65.)
Applicant  continues  to  consume  cannabis  three  times  a  day  as  a  medical
marijuana card holder in his state. (Tr. 31, 42-43.) He knows that the defense contractor
has a drug policy. However, he also testified that he knows that there are people working
for  the  defense  contractor  with  their  medical  marijuana  certifications.  (Tr.  44-45.)  He
believes that “there’s a strong possibility” that he can work for the defense contractor and
still use marijuana as long as he has a medical marijuana card. (Tr. 44.) However, he also
testified that if it is not possible to use marijuana and work for a defense contractor, he
could stop using and attempt to find alternative treatment for his medical conditions. (Tr.
44.) He would like to continue his medical marijuana use. (Tr. 45.)
Finances
Applicant opened some credit card accounts early on in his marriage to establish
credit so that he and his spouse could buy a house. (Tr. 49.) He and his spouse did not
always spend wisely, and she did not return to work immediately after the birth of their
first child in March 2013 due to postpartum depression. (Tr. 49.) After losing his job at the
casino in March 2014, Applicant was unemployed until September 2015. He spent the
time caring for his then infant son, and he collected unemployment compensation during
that  time.  (GE  6.)  From  October  2014  until  December  2014,  Applicant  attended  and
completed a commercial driver training course. (GEs 1-2, 6.) For about 12 to 18 months,
he and his spouse were “treading water,” but it got to the point where they relied on credit
to pay their utility bills and purchase groceries. (Tr. 49.) His spouse spent irresponsibly,
and their financial situation “got out of control.” (Tr. 50.)
After testing  positive  for Ativan  in December 2016, Applicant lost  his commercial
driver’s  license.  He  struggled   to   find   suitable   employment,   and   was  unemployed   from
January   2017   to   May   2017.  During   that  time,  he   attended   school  for  bartending.  His
spouse  took  $20,000  from  her  retirement funds to  support  their  family. (GE 6.)  Applicant
worked  as a  traffic controller for a  security  company  from  May  2017  to  July  2017,  when
he   was  laid   off   for  lack  of   work.   In   August  2017,  Applicant  began   working   at  a   pizza
restaurant.  After only  three  or four days on  the  job, he  injured  his knee. He filed  a  worker’s
compensation claim, and he elected not to return to that job. (GEs 1, 6.) He received a
settlement of $9,500 for his injury. (GE 6.)
Applicant was unemployed from August 2017 to January 2018. He held temporary
employment  for  a  short  time  in  January  2018,  but  he  was  terminated  when  he  was
observed wearing a knee brace to work. Through his state, he enrolled in a manufacturing
pipeline  design  program  at  a  community  college  in  March  2018.  Two  weeks  into  his
training, he received a conditional offer of employment from a defense contractor, pending
his successful completion of the training, which ended on March 28, 2018. (GEs 1, 6.)
At  the  end  of  his  training,  Applicant  completed  his  March  29,  2018  SF  86.  He
reported some financial difficulties involving routine accounts: $1,500 in hospital bills in
collection;  unresolved  credit-card  delinquencies  of  $9,946  (SOR  ¶  4.a).  $2,731  (not
alleged), $3,526 (SOR ¶ 4.d), $4,690 (SOR ¶ 4.c), and $5,815 (SOR ¶ 4.b); his mortgage
that was past due for $4,016 (allegation withdrawn); and an $876 energy bill (not alleged).
Applicant explained that he fell behind on the accounts because he was injured at work
in August 2017, lost his job, and was unable to get new work. He was appealing denial of
a worker’s compensation claim. He added that he was working with his mortgage lender
to remodify his loan and arrange a payment plan to bring his loan current, and that he
was in a program with the energy company to spread out his debt so that he could bring
his account up to date. He explained that he was presently unable to make any payments
on the credit-card delinquencies. (GE 1.)
Applicant started working for the  defense contractor as a mechanical draftsman
learner  in  April  2018.  He  was  laid  off  only  weeks  later  because  of  a  lack  of  security
clearance. He understands he would return to work for the employer if his clearance is
adjudicated favorably. (GE 6.) Applicant went to work for a family member. (Tr. 50.)
As of May 2018, Applicant’s credit report showed that he owed credit-card charged
off balance of $9,945, $4,689, $6,284, and $3,536, and a medical collection debt of $25.
(GE 4.) When asked about his finances during his June 12, 2018 interview with the OPM
investigator,  Applicant  stated  that  he  had used  credit  cards  to  support himself  and his
family,  and  he  stopped  making  even  the  monthly  minimum  payments  on  some  of  the
accounts (a $1,500 hospital debt and those accounts in SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.e). He explained
that he tried to establish repayment plans with the creditors in November 2017 but none
would agree on a payment that he could afford. He volunteered that the creditor in SOR
¶ 4.a had filed for judgment in February 2018, and that he had yet to receive a court date.
Additionally, he and his spouse had consulted with a bankruptcy attorney in January 2018
to resolve their debt. They had not filed a bankruptcy petition because he did not want a
bankruptcy to negatively impact his chance of being rehired by the defense contractor.
He expressed an intention is to file after he is rehired. He added that he had rectified his
mortgage  issues  and  was  making  timely  payments  following  a  loan  modification.
Applicant  did  not  recognize  the  $25  medical  collection  debt  (SOR  ¶  4.g)  on  his  credit
record. He stated that he had taken an online credit-counseling course and attended a
mortgage crisis job training program to improve his financial situation. (GE 6.)
In October 2019, Applicant lost his job with his uncle because he had to stay at
home to care for his two young children. His spouse gave him two days notice before she
left for a rehabilitation program located out of state. Applicant was unemployed until late
January 2020, when he began working for a manufacturing machine company. (Tr. 50,
56.)  He  left  that  job  in  May  2020,  when  his  brother  died.  Applicant  was  emotionally
distraught and unable to work without compromising his and others’ safety. (Tr. 57.)  As
of May 2020, the credit bureaus were reporting no progress on Applicant resolving the
credit-card delinquencies in SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.d. Additionally, a $406 satellite television debt
was in collection (SOR ¶ 4.e), and his mortgage loan was in foreclosure. (GE 5.) Applicant
and his spouse were approved for a mortgage loan modification in October 2020, which
lowered  their  monthly  payment  from  $985  to  $886.  (GE  4.)  They  have  made  timely
mortgage  payments  since  then.  (AEs  A-C,  E.) However,  as  of  May 2021,  the  debts  in
SOR ¶¶ 4.a and 4.c-4.e were still on his credit record as unpaid. (AEs A-C.) The creditor
for the debt in SOR ¶ 4.a had offered to settle Applicant’s balance for $2,000. Applicant
has not been able to reach the creditor about the proposed settlement. (Tr. 26.) There is
no evidence of record showing that the debt in SOR ¶ 4.b has been resolved, although it
is no longer listed on his credit report.
Applicant has been unemployed for a year as of his May 2021 hearing.  (Tr. 26,
51.) He has been collecting unemployment compensation for the last year. It is currently
the minimum of $200 per week plus the $300 stimulus. (Tr. 57-58.) His spouse has been
employed as a dealer at a casino since 2006, with the exception of a brief furlough and
time  off  after the  birth  of  their  children.  (Tr. 57.)  She  works  four  days  a  week  and  her
earnings fluctuate depending on tips. She  averages about $25 to $35 per hour in tips,
and brings home about $850 per week. (Tr. 51, 59.) He and his spouse have “just under
$10,000 in [their] savings account.” (Tr. 26, 52.) Applicant has had some credit counseling
because he and his spouse are contemplating filing for bankruptcy.  He would like to gain
stable employment so he can negotiate with his creditors and bring his accounts current.
His spouse is looking into a loan from her 401(k) to address some of the debts. (Tr. 55.)
",True
"Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the  following
findings  of  fact:  Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  enlisted  in  the  Army  National  Guard
(ARNG)  in  July  2012,  where  he  served  as  a  signal  support  systems  specialist.  He
received an honorable discharge due to a medical condition (seizure disorder) in August
2014. Since October 2017, he has worked for a DOD contractor and recently accepted
a  promotion  as  a  numerical  control  programmer  making  approximately  $59,000  per
year. He is currently married and has an 11-month old son. His wife is a stay-at-home
mother. He does not currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 21-24, 27-30, 83;
GE 1)
The  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  determined  Applicant’s  military  disability  was
approximately 10 percent following his ARNG discharge. In early 2020 the VA decided
Applicant had a 100 percent total and permanent disability. In July 2020 he received a
lump-sum back-payment of $17,000 from the VA due to the increased percentage of his
disability.  Since  November  2020  Applicant  has  received  $3,450  per  month  for  his
military service disability. (Tr. 21-24, 27-30; AE F)
Psychological Conditions  and Financial Considerations
SOR  allegation  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  was  diagnosed  in  2019  with  major
depressive disorder and gambling disorder. The therapist noted that Applicant struggled
to control his gambling; he lied to his fiancé (now wife) about his gambling; and although
his  gambling  adversely  impacted  his  finances,  he  was  not  ready  to  completely  stop
gambling. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR response. (GE 8)
SOR  allegation  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  Applicant  visited  a  therapist  in  August  2020,
and  he  admitted  that  he  continued  to  gamble.  The  therapist  opined  that  there  was  a
potential  for  Applicant’s  condition  to  adversely  impact  his  judgment  and  reliability
because  he  suffered  from  a  lack  of  impulse  control  and  did  not  continue  any
recommended treatment for this condition. Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (AE
E)
In  March  2013,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  which  was  later
converted  to  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  December  2019.  The  bankruptcy  was
discharged  in  April  2020.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  and  testified
that  he  was  not  good  at  managing  money.  He  also  admitted  that  beginning  in  about
2017, he started gambling. His gambling increased to the point where he was going to
the  casino  one  or  two  times  weekly,  spending  approximately  $400  on  each  occasion.
Applicant’s  gambling  losses  eventually  prevented  him  from  continuing  the  Chapter  13
payments  to  the  trustee,  and  a  change  was  initiated  by  his  attorney  to  deduct  the
payments  directly  from  Applicant’s  paychecks.  Applicant  started  relying  on  credit  card
cash advances and using speedy loans to pay for his gambling and living expenses. His
financial  situation  steadily  worsened  and  he  made  the  decision  to  convert  his  current
Chapter 13 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2019. (Tr. 30-36, 87-88;
GE 5, GE 6, GE 7; AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  student  loans  totaling  about  $6,732  were
delinquent.  (SOR  ¶¶ 2.b,  2.c,  and  2.d) Applicant  provided  post-hearing documentation
dated  March  2021  showing  that  the  combined  total  of  his  student  loans  was  $15,210.
The VA also notified the U.S. Department of Education that Applicant was eligible for a
total and permanent disability discharge of his federal student loans, which canceled his
obligation to repay the remaining student loan balances. (Tr. 36-38, 40; GE 3, GE 4; AE
F)
The SOR alleged that Applicant owed two  First Premier credit cards in the total
amount of $1,910 that had been charged off. (SOR ¶¶ 2.e, and 2.f.) These allegations
were  withdrawn  by  Department  Counsel  as  the  debts  were  included  in  the  Chapter  7
bankruptcy discharge. This information was also verified  by the December 2020 credit
report in evidence that listed both accounts with a zero balance. (Tr. 38-41; GE 3, GE 4;
AE B, AE C)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  a  Credit  One  Bank  credit  card  in  the
approximate  amount  of  $858.  (SOR  ¶  2.g)  This  debt  was  also  included  in  the
bankruptcy discharge. (Tr. 41-43; GE 4; AE B, AE C)
SOR  ¶  2.h  alleged  that  Applicant  continued  to  gamble  despite  his  delinquent
accounts and pending bankruptcy, which he admitted in his SOR response. He testified
that  while  the  bankruptcy  was  pending,  he  was  experiencing  some  depression,  and
gambling made him feel better about himself. Applicant’s stated his last visit to a casino
occurred in July 2020. (Tr. 33-36, 48)
In 2019, Applicant’s fiancée confronted him about his gambling problem. He lied
to  her  and  denied  he  was  gambling,  but  she  threatened  to  call  off  their  upcoming
wedding unless he sought  professional counseling. Applicant agreed and enrolled in a
treatment  program  from  June  6,  2019  through  July  30,  2019.  He  was  diagnosed  with
major depressive disorder and gambling disorder. He admitted to the counselor that he
had  just  recently  lost  $1,000  at  the  casino.  His  family  doctor  prescribed  an
antidepressant medication (name unrecalled), but he quickly discontinued taking it after
a couple of months as he did not like how the medication made him feel. Despite being
in  treatment, in  part for his gambling addiction,  Applicant  continued  gambling because
he  enjoyed  it  and  believed  he  could  responsibly  control  his  gambling.  He  visited  the
casino one to two times weekly, and he told his counselor he only wished to reduce, not
eliminate, his gambling visits. Applicant testified at the hearing he had permission from
his therapist to continue visiting the casino to see if he really could control his gambling.
He went to the casino with only $100 to see if he could control it, and he continued this
pattern until he acknowledged  to the counselor that he could not control  his gambling.
His counselor advised him that he needed to completely stop gambling and to continue
counseling to help him overcome his gambling addiction. After July 30, 2019, Applicant
did not see a counselor for his gambling disorder for over a year because his counselor
was on an indefinite leave of absence, and he did not want to see any other therapist for
his treatment. (Tr. 34, 64-65, 67-71, 84-86, 89-90; AE E)
During  Applicant’s  June  22,  2020  background  interview,  he  volunteered  to  the
investigator that he had a gambling addiction. Applicant reported that from August 2018
through  July 2019 he  lost  on average  $300 to  $1,000  weekly  due to  gambling.  During
his Chapter 13  bankruptcy  when  the monthly payments  were  being deducted from his
paychecks, Applicant opened about six to eight credit card accounts and payday loans
to help pay for his gambling. The credit card cash advances and payday loans  totaled
about $14,000, and he eventually included these debts in his December 2019 Chapter 7
bankruptcy  conversion.  Applicant  also  spent  approximately  $9,000  of  his  personal
savings  to  support  his  gambling  addiction.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  received
treatment  for  his  gambling  addiction  from  July  2019  through  December  2019.
Applicant’s actual  dates of treatment  occurred  from  June  6,  2019  to  July  30, 2019. He
also reported that he stopped gambling in July 2019, and he did not anticipate that he
would gamble in the future. (Tr. 30-31, 34-36, 60-62, 87; GE 2, GE 8)
In July 2020, Applicant received a lump-sum disability back-payment of $17,000
from  the  VA.  Applicant  testified  that  he  had  resumed  gambling  in  May  or  June  2020,
and  it  was  not  until  July  2020  that  he  realized  that  he  did  have  an  uncontrollable
gambling problem, and he could never visit a casino again. He went to the casino to fill
out an exclusionary ticket in July 2020, but he also took about $300 with him to gamble
one last time before filling out the paperwork. He won $200, completed the exclusionary
ticket, and the casino personnel escorted him to the parking lot. In August 2020, he took
out a loan from his 401k in the amount of approximately $2,124. He could not recall the
reason why he took out that loan, but thought possibly to purchase items for the birth of
his son. He is current on the bi-weekly loan payments of $56.26 since it is taken directly
out  of  his  paychecks.  Applicant  reiterated  that  the  last  time  he  gambled  was  in  July
2020. (Tr. 67-69, 73-75, 87-88; SOR response; AE G)
On August 22, 2020, Applicant visited another counselor because he stated that
he needed help to control his gambling addiction. He reported to the counselor that he
had started gambling again a few months ago. The 2019 treatment he received was not
successful.  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  major  depression  disorder,  active,  and
gambling  disorder,  active.  The  treatment  objective  was  to  explore  and  resolve  issues
related  to  his  addictive  behavior,  including  gambling,  and  for  Applicant  to  stay
completely  free  of  gambling.  He  was  also  to  be  referred  to  a  psychiatrist  due  to  his
underlying depression that could be contributing to his addictive behavior. Applicant was
supposed to contact the therapist to set up his next appointment, but he did not like this
therapist, and he did not return for additional treatment. The therapist opined that there
was a potential for Applicant’s condition to adversely impact his judgment and reliability
because  he  suffered  from  a  lack  of  impulse  control  and  did  not  continue  any
recommended treatment for this condition.  (Tr. 29, 32, 56-58, 65, 70-71; AE E)
Applicant testified that in July 2020 he stopped gambling cold turkey, and without
the benefit of continued counseling or a gambling support group. After questioning, he
admitted that he had contacted the treatment center  again in early 2021. When asked
why he made this contact since he reportedly stopped gambling in July 2020, he said he
did  so  because  he does  not  like being told he  cannot do  something or that  he  cannot
overcome  a  personal  problem,  such  as  gambling.  This  all  started  after  Applicant  was
having  a  conversation  with  his  brother-in-law,  an  alcoholic,  and  he  asked  him  why  he
could  not  just  have  one  beer?  Applicant’s  brother-in-law  told  him  the  reason  he  could
not have a beer is due to the same reason Applicant could not gamble again; they were
both  addicts.  Applicant  stated  that  a  part  of  him  wanted  to  prove  his  brother-in-law
wrong and show him he could control his gambling. So in early 2021 Applicant called a
therapist  to  see  if  this  was  a  good  idea,  but  after  he  could  not  get  in  touch  with  the
therapist,  he  decided  it  was  not  worth  it.  He  does  not  intend  to  participate  in  any
additional  counseling  for  his  gambling  problem  because  he  does  not  think  about
gambling anymore. He estimated that overall he lost about $10,000 over the years due
to gambling. (Tr. 71-72, 89-94)
Personal Conduct:
The SOR alleged that Applicant falsified information on his January 2020 security
clearance application (SCA) when he answered “No” to the following question: “Section
21- Psychological  and  Emotional  Health  –  Adversely  Affected:  Do  you  have  a  mental
health  or  other  health  condition  that  substantially  adversely  affects  your  judgment,
reliability,  or  trustworthiness  even  if  you  are  not  experiencing  such  symptoms  today?”
Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his 2019 diagnoses of major depressive disorder
and  gambling  disorder.  (SOR  ¶  3.a)  In  his  SOR  response,  Applicant  denied  this
allegation,  stating  that  he  never  agreed  with  his  therapist’s  diagnosis  of  major
depressive  disorder.  He  was  merely  going  through  an  emotional  period  of  his  life.
Applicant did not address or explain why he failed to disclose his diagnosis of gambling
disorder on the SCA. (Tr. 23-24, 63, 76-78; GE 1, GE 2, GE 8; SOR response)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant falsified  information  on
his January 2020 SCA in his response to the following question: “Section 26- Financial
Record – Gambling: Have you EVER experienced financial problems due to gambling?”
Applicant answered this question “No” and deliberately failed to disclose that he opened
multiple  lines  of  credit  totaling  $14,000  and  also  spent  approximately  $9,000  of  his
savings  to  support  his  gambling,  which  ultimately  led  to  his  filing  for  Chapter  7
bankruptcy  in  December  2019.  (SOR  ¶  3.b)  Applicant  admitted  this  information  in  his
SOR response, but he denied that he answered the question with the intent to deceive
the government. He made a mistake when he  read the question and failed to disclose
his financial issues developed from his gambling problem.  At the hearing, he admitted
he filled out the SCA before he made the decision to quit gambling altogether. (Tr. 75,
78-79; GE 1; SOR response)

"In  her  Answer to  the  SOR Applicant admitted  the factual allegations  in Paragraph
1.a.  of the  SOR,  and  denied  the  factual  allegations in  Paragraph  1.b.  of the  SOR,  with
explanations.   She  also   provided   additional  information   to   support  her   request  for
eligibility for a  security clearance.
Applicant  is  35   years  old,   married,  and   has  two   children.  She   has  a   General
Education  Degree  (GED). Applicant  has been  working  for a  defense  contractor  for “just
over three  years.”  She  currently  does not hold  a  security  clearance.  (TR at page  17  line
21 to page 20 line 7.)
Guideline I  –  Psychological Conditions
1.a. and 1.b. In December of 2019, Applicant was diagnosed as having “a history
of  Stimulant  Use  Disorder,  Severe,  In  Sustained  Remission,  due  to  her  previous
dependence  on  methamphetamine.”  (GX  3  at  page  9.)  The  Licensed  Clinical
Psychologist  (LCP)  based  this  diagnosis  on  Applicant’s  “history  of  methamphetamine
dependence”  following  her  father’s  death,  prior  to  her  “completing  treatment  in  2007,”
and  Applicant’s  one-time  relapse  “during  the  course  of  her  wedding  celebration  in
2017.”  (Id.) This LCP concluded, in part, the following: “While . . . [Applicant] does not
demonstrate current or imminent concerns about her trustworthiness and reliability, she
demonstrates  a  longstanding  history  of  emotional  and  behavioral  dysregulation,  with
historical  lapses  in  impulse  control  and  judgment.  .  .  .  As  such  her  prognosis  is
considered to be guarded.” (GX 3 at page 10.)
Applicant  takes  issue  with  the  above  LCP’s  conclusions,  and  has  offered  the
August  2021  Psychological  Evaluation  of  another  Licensed  Psychologist  (LP).  (TR  at
page 20 line 16 to page 26 line 2, and AppX C.)  This LP “summarized” her findings as
follows:  “1.  .  .  .  [Applicant]  does  not  currently  have  symptoms  of  any  mental  health
disorder.  Her  mood  is  currently  stable.  2.  .  .  .  she  no  longer  meets  criteria  for  mental
health  disorder.  3.  .  .  .  [Applicant]  is  not  currently  prescribed  any  psychotropic
medications.  4.  It  is  highly  likely  that  .  .  .  [Applicant]  will  manage  a  stressful  work
situation  effectively.”  (AppX  C  at  page  9.)  Finally,  this  LP  opined  “Ultimately,  it  is  my
opinion that . . . [Applicant] should receive psychological clearance.”  (AppX C at page
10.)
",True
"The  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  I,  that  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  a
pedophilic disorder (with a questionable prognosis) in January 2020. Under Guideline D,
it alleged, and cross-alleged under Guideline E, that Applicant engaged in downloading
and viewing child pornography from approximately 2011 to 2017, and that he currently
reads  erotic  textual  stories  involving  children.  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR
allegations with comments in mitigation.
Applicant’s  SOR  admissions  and  those  at  his  hearing  are  incorporated  into  my
findings of fact. After a thorough review of all the record evidence, I make the following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant,  41,  has  been  working  for  federal  contractors  since  2003,  and  for  his
current employer and clearance sponsor since March 2016. He was granted clearance
eligibility  up  to  sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI)  by  another  Federal  agency
(Agency) in about 2005. He married in 2008, and has one son, age eight. He graduated
from  high  school  with  a  large  number  of  college  courses  completed,  and  attended
college for some time, but never completed his bachelor’s degree.
Applicant  has  done  well  in  his  area  of  expertise.  He  has  established  a  strong
reputation  and  is  respected  by  peers  and  employers  for  his  acumen,  dedication,
leadership,  and  professionalism.  His  performance  evaluations  show  he  has  been
consistently  rated  as  an  exceptional  employee  who  exceeds  expectations,  and  has
earned yearly awards recognizing him as the best among peers. (AE A and B)
In 2013, Applicant participated in several polygraph assisted interviews. (GEs 3 –
8,  and  10,  11)  He  disclosed  that  in  mid-2011,  he  began  downloading,  storing,  and
viewing child pornography on his personal computer once every two weeks. He viewed
videos  depicting  females  ranging  from  8  to  17  years  of  age  exposing  their  genitals,
masturbating,  and  having  sexual  contact  with  each  other  and  adults.  He  masturbated
during these  sessions.  He  also  reported  that in  2012, he had thought  about  amassing
enough classified information to give to Russia or the Ukraine in exchange for a harem
of little girls. He denied ever acting on it. (Tr. 55)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  stopped  viewing  child  pornography  in  about  October
2012  after  discussing  his  behavior  in  detail  with  his  wife  and  promising  her  that  he
would  stop.  He  had  his  wife  set  the  passwords  of  his  home  computer  to  prevent  him
from searching for child pornography. At his hearing, he admitted that he was able to go
around  the  passwords  and  use  the  computers.  He  attributed  his  child  pornography
viewing habits to the death of a close female friend in 2009.
During a May 2014 polygraph assisted interview, Applicant described himself as
a  pedophile  because  he  is  sexually  attracted  to  underage  girls.  He  claimed  he  has
never acted on his desires. Between the spring of 2013 and March 2014, Applicant read
erotic  stories  featuring  underage  females  engaging  in  sexual  acts  with  adults.  He
claimed he stopped reading these stories in March 2014, because they made his sexual
urges  stronger.  He  stated  that  he  was  masturbating  once  per  month  to  the  thought  of
engaging in sexual acts with underage females. He told his interviewers that having and
maintaining  a  clearance  was  a  strong  deterrent  to  keep  him  from  viewing  child
pornography.
After  the  interview,  Applicant  participated  in  counseling  with  his  own  therapist
and  an  Agency  therapist.  After  a  psychological  evaluation,  the  Agency  therapist
diagnosed  Applicant  with  Pedophilic  Disorder.  Notwithstanding  this  diagnosis,  the
Agency  therapist  recommended  Applicant  continue  his  work.  During  a  following
interview  in  August  2015,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  searched  for,  downloaded,
stored on his computer, and viewed child pornography on six to seven occasions from
one month after his Agency’s psychological evaluation in June 2014, to most recently in
June  2015.  He  also  used  his  cell  phone  to  search  for  child  pornography.  After  the
interview, the Agency suspended his clearance and SCI eligibility.
Applicant’s  appeal to  the  Agency’s decision  included a psychological  evaluation
in  December  2015,  performed  by  his  treating  psychologist,  Dr.  C,  a  licensed
psychologist  (Psy.D).  He  was  diagnosed  with:  1)  Pedophilic  Disorder,  Nonexclusive
Type, Sexually Attracted to Females (so the attraction to underage females will always
be present); 2) Bipolar Disorder, Most Recent Episode Depressed, Mild; and 3) Alcohol
Dependence  in  Sustained  Full  Remission.  Based  on  the  evaluation  report,  it  appears
that  the  psychologist  believed  that  Applicant  had  only  sought  and  viewed  child
pornography between 2011 and 2012, with a one-time relapse in 2015. (GE 4)
Applicant’s  evidence  fails  to  establish  that  Dr.  C  was  aware  that  between  the
spring  of  2013  and  March  2014,  he  read  erotic  stories  featuring  underage  females
engaging in sexual acts with adults. It is also not clear whether Dr. C knew that between
June 2014 (one month after his Agency’s psychological evaluation) and  June 2015, he
viewed child pornography on six to seven occasions, and not just one time. (GE 10) The
Agency revoked Applicant’s clearance in February 2016. (GE 6)
After  submitting  his  2017  SCA,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  investigators from
the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM)  in July, September, and November 2017,
and  answered  a  set  of  interrogatories  from  the  DOHA,  in  about  May  2020.  (GE  2).  In
substance,  Applicant  reiterated  his prior statements  to Agency investigators  during his
interviews with OPM investigators.
In  January  2020,  the  CAF  referred  Applicant  for  a  psychological  evaluation,
which  was performed by Dr. W, a licensed Doctor of  Clinical Psychology (Psy.D). The
evaluation  report  was  completed  in  February  2020.  (GE  13)  During  the  evaluation,
Applicant  told  Dr. W  that  the  last  time  he  viewed  child  pornography  was  in  2018.  She
noted  that  via  a  post-interview  email,  Applicant  re-stated  that  he  last  viewed  child
pornography  in  late  2017,  towards  the  end  of  his  therapy  sessions  with  Dr.  C.
Applicant’s counseling records show that he ended his therapy with Dr. C in November
2018. (GE 12) During the evaluation process, Dr. W spoke with Dr. C. Dr. W noted that
Dr. C believed Applicant last viewed child pornography in 2013, with a relapse in 2015.
(See  AE  G;  GE  13)  Applicant’s  counseling  records  reflect  that  he  told  Dr.  C  he
“relapsed” once in 2016.
Dr. W diagnosed Applicant as follows: (GE 13)
296.56 Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode depressed, in full remission
F65.4 Pedophilic Disorder (Nonexclusive type, sexually attracted to females)
In  her  opinion,  Applicant’s  symptoms  of  Bipolar  Disorder  appear  to  be  well
controlled  by  his  adherence  to  psychiatric  medications.  Concerning  Applicant’s
Pedophilic  Disorder,  she  stated:  [Applicant]  presents  with  a  condition  (Pedophilic
Disorder) that could pose a significant risk to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness
concerning classified information. In her opinion, Applicant’s prognosis is questionable.
At  his hearing,  Applicant  presented his  own psychological  evaluation performed
by Dr. C, in March 2001. (AE G) Dr. C diagnosed Applicant with:
F31.31 Bipolar Disorder, most recent episode  depressed, mild
F65.4 Pedophilic Disorder (Nonexclusive type, sexually attracted  to  females)
Dr. C’s evaluation is favorable to Applicant. She noted that he denied acting on
his fantasies by sexually assaulting children, and that he consistently expressed severe
emotional  distress  related  to  his  unwanted  sexual  fantasies.  She  highlighted  that  he
outed himself as a consumer of child pornography to family members and some friends,
and  that  he  has  received  “overwhelming  support”  from  them  in  his  efforts  towards
abstinence  and  controlling  his  sexual  urges.  Dr.  C  believes  that  during  his  course  of
therapy, Applicant abstained from viewing child pornography entirely with the exception
of  a  relapse  that  occurred  in  June  2015.  Dr.  C  failed  to  note  Applicant’s  relapse  of
February 2016, which was documented in her counseling notes. (GE 12)
that  he  engaged
Applicant  admitted
in  downloading  and  viewing  child
pornography from approximately 2011 to  2018. He  stated that  his last  viewing of  child
pornography occurred shortly before he stopped his treatment with Dr. C in November
2018.  (GE  12;  SOR  answer;  Tr.  26)  Applicant  stated  that  if  his  counseling  records  do
not state the times he relapsed it was likely  an oversight that he does not understand,
and  volunteer  to  bring  the  information  to  Dr.  C  and  have  her  amend  her  evaluation
letter. (Tr. 92)
Based  on  Applicant’s  treatment  records  and  Dr.  C’s  March  2021  evaluation,  it
appears she  was unaware of Applicant’s relapses  after  February 2016. At his hearing,
when  questioned  about  how  frequently  he  viewed  child  pornography  after  2015,  and
when was the last time he did so, Applicant was evasive, and stated that it has been so
long ago he no longer recalls. He admitted that he relapsed more than once during his
treatment between 2014 and 2018. (Tr. 38)
In  his  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  (GE  2)  and  at  his  hearing,  Applicant
stated that he had been reading erotic textual stories involving children. He claimed that
reading  these  erotic  stories  helps  prevent  him  from  engaging  in  any  illegal  activity
(searching, downloading, and viewing child pornography). He testified that reading such
stories became part of his coping mechanism and therapy. It was his way of addressing
that  aspect  of  sexuality  in  a  way  that  was  both  legal  and  ethical.  He  believes  such
behavior is legal and ethical. (Tr. 27)
There  is  no  information  in  his  counseling  records  or  in  Dr.  C’s  evaluations
showing  that  she  was  aware  he  was  reading  erotic  textual  stories  involving  children.  I
note that he told Agency investigators that in 2013-2014 he had to stop reading erotic
stories  involving  young  girls  engaging  in  sexual  acts  because  such  stories  make  his
sexual urges stronger. (GE 8; Tr. 103-104)
Applicant  testified  that  after  his  treatment  discharge  in  November  2018,  he  has
not  felt  the  urge  to  look  at  child  pornography.  (Tr.  50)  He  claimed  that  viewing  child
pornography is behind him, and that he has had no relapses since November 2018. (Tr.
52)
Attached to his SOR answer, Applicant included favorable reference statements
from  his  wife,  mother,  father,  two  co-workers,  and  a  supervisor.  (AE  E)  Most  of  the
letters were apparently prepared for his appeal of the Agency’s clearance revocation in
2015-2016.  Only  one  letter  was  dated  in  2019;  only  one  writer  indicated  he  believed
Applicant’s clearance was revoked as a result of a “self-reported violation of his security
agreement.” None of the references stated their knowledge about the child pornography
allegations against Applicant.
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  presented  three  favorable  reference  letters,  recently
dated,  from  friends  and  a  colleague.  (AE  I  and  K)  None  of  the  references  state  with
specificity their actual knowledge of the SOR allegations.
Based  on  the  record  evidence,  only  Applicant’s  wife  seems  to  be  aware  of  the
reasons  behind  Applicant’s  clearance  revocation  by  the  Agency  in  2016  –  his
involvement with child pornography. It is not clear whether she is aware of the pending
SOR allegations or the totality of Applicant’s criminal behavior.
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 51 years old. He attended college, but did not earn a diploma. He was
married twice, both ending in divorce. He is in a long-term relationship and lives with his
fiancée. They have been together for about 10 years. He has no children. Applicant has
worked for his present employer since June 2018. (Transcript (Tr.) 13-15)
Applicant testified that he began drinking alcohol to excess when he was about 30
years old.  He would  consume alcohol every day.  He continued this  pattern until about
2010, when he reduced his drinking to three to four beers a day or every other day. He
continued this pattern until about 2016. (Tr. 21-23)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  been  on  medication  since  about  2005  for
depression, which he said runs in his family. From 2012 to 2015, he was seen at a mental
health clinic for his depression. He was not being seen for his alcohol issues. He began
seeing  a  psychiatrist-psychologist  (Dr.  G)  in  2015.  This  was  the  first  time  his  alcohol
issues were addressed along with his depression. He had been advised by Dr. G to not
consume alcohol while on prescribed medication. He did not follow his Dr. G’s advice and
continued to consume alcohol. (Tr. 27-30, 39-40)
In January 2016, reacting to the death of David Bowie, Applicant brought alcohol
(vodka) to work with him to drink. He said he did not normally bring alcohol to work. Later
in the day, he purchased beer and brought it back to the office. He drank the vodka and
about 12 beers. He became intoxicated and drove his car, which he crashed into a pole
after falling asleep. He was uninjured and his fiancée drove him home. The police were
not notified. (Tr. 23-27)
Applicant stated that prior to 2016, he consumed alcohol at work on a couple of
occasions. He would bring the alcohol to work with him. He remembered drinking at work
one day in the summer of 2015 as a coping mechanism because his mother was in the
hospital. He had about three beers. A month later he did the same thing for the same
reason. He estimated from 2015 to 2016, he consumed alcohol at work about four times.
(Tr. 36-38)
In  2016,  Applicant  was  advised  by  Dr.  G  to  stop  consuming  alcohol.  Applicant
testified that Dr. G referred to him as a “drunk.” He said that this was the first time he was
ever told to stop drinking. He said he attempted to abstain, could not, but reduced his
consumption. Dr. G diagnosed Applicant with unspecified Alcohol Use Disorder. Applicant
consumed alcohol before a couple of his appointments with Dr. G. On one occasion, he
was told to wait for transportation to be arranged because it was unsafe for Applicant to
drive.  He  left  the  office  without  waiting.  Applicant  was  also  seeing  a  therapist  once  a
month in conjunction with Dr. G. Applicant testified that in 2017 he stopped seeing Dr. G
because he did not have a good rapport with him and was unhappy with being referred
to  as  a  “drunk”  instead  of  an  alcoholic.  He  also  stopped  seeing  the  therapist.  Dr.  G’s
medical notes state that Applicant was terminated as a patient in November 2017, due to
a pattern of noncompliance with treatment recommendations, multiple relapses of alcohol
abuse,  not  seeking  a  12-step  program,  not  seeking  psychotherapy,  and  leaving  the
waiting room when mildly intoxicated after agreeing that his fiancée would come pick him
up because he should not be driving. (Tr. 27-30, 39-41; GE 3)
Applicant testified that the accident was a wake-up call to him regarding his alcohol
abuse.  He  attempted  to  stop  drinking,  but  could  abstain  for  only  short  periods.  He
continued  to  consume  alcohol  daily  from  2016  until  he  started  his  current  job  in  June
2018.  He  said  he  cut  back  on  his  daily  drinking  because  it  was  inconsistent  with  his
employment.  He  testified  he  was  only  drinking  on  the  weekends  during  this  time.
Applicant  testified  that  in  late  2019,  he  abstained  from  alcohol  consumption  for  nine
months. He felt his prescribed medication was working, and he was enjoying life. He said
he did not plan to abstain from alcohol consumption forever and thought he would resume
consumption  at  some  point.  In  2021,  he  resumed  consuming  alcohol.  He  testified  he
drinks on the weekends during football season and perhaps on a few special occasions
such  as birthdays.  He  consumes  about a  six-pack  of  beer on  Saturdays  and Sundays
with his fiancée. (Tr. 18-20, 27-35)
Applicant testified that in 2018, he began seeing Dr. Z about every two to three
months to have his prescriptions refilled for his depression. He was advised by Dr. Z to
not consume alcohol while taking the depression medications. Dr. Z would ask him “where
his brain was at?” (Tr. 42) He said he was prescribed Antabuse by Dr. Z. He took it for six
months  and  stopped  drinking.  He  said  that  Dr.  Z  decided  in  early  2021  to  stop  the
Antabuse because Applicant was not drinking. Applicant testified that he told Dr. Z that
he had resumed consuming alcohol, but it was controlled. He admitted he has attempted
to abstain from alcohol consumption on several occasions in the past, but would always
resume drinking. (Tr. 15, 41-46)
Applicant  testified  that  he  believed  in  the  past  he  resorted  to  alcohol  use  when
under stress, but does not do this any longer. He said he is in a different place now than
when the  security clearance process started. His  believes his brain is sharper, and he
solves problems better. He is not willing to abstain from alcohol consumption because he
enjoys drinking while watching football on the weekends. He said he has been seeing a
therapist since mid-2020 about once a month due to his mother’s passing. He consumed
alcohol when his mother and sister passed away in 2019 and 2020. He explained, he had
a couple of bad days. During this time, he was drinking about 12 beers on each day of
the weekend. (Tr. 16-18, 46-50)
DOD CAF requested a psychological evaluation of Applicant and it was conducted
licensed  clinical  psychologist  and  board-certified
in  February  2020  by  a
neuropsychologist. Applicant told the psychologist that after his 2016 car accident it was
a wake-up call and he stopped drinking alcohol completely for a few years, but in the last
six  months  he  and  his  fiancée  occasionally  have  a  couple  of  glasses  of  wine  on  the
weekends. He said he is not addicted to alcohol anymore. He did not freely report that he
had seen his psychiatrist after consuming alcohol. He told the psychologist that he only
drank beer. He was confronted with Dr. G’s medical records from October 2017, where it
was noted he was drinking a fifth of vodka or rum per  day. He admitted that he did so
briefly after his sister’s passing. (Tr. 52-54; GE 2)
The psychologist noted during the evaluation that Applicant was not defensive, but
was  not  forthcoming  with  information.  When  directly  questioned  about  information,  he
never denied the incidents, but seemed to minimize them. During the testing process, she
noted that he also was not completely forthcoming in his responses. She indicated that
given his response style and tendency to withhold information during the interview unless
directly  confronted,  his  test  results  are  unlikely  to  capture  any  true  psychological
conditions and reflect only his own self-description. She noted that his profile indicates
poor insight into his history of alcohol misuse, or the difficulties alcohol use has had in his
life. His interest in and motivation for treatment is below average compared to adults who
are not being seen in a therapeutic setting, and a great deal lower than those in treatment
settings. She  stated: “This indicates that he is satisfied with himself as he is, and sees
little need for changes in his behavior. As such, he is likely to be reluctant to commit to
therapy.” (GE 2)
I
The  psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with  Alcohol  Use  Disorder-Severe;
-
Major  Depressive  Disorder,  Recurrent,  Moderate.  She  found  that  Applicant
-
continues  to consume  alcohol  and  has  not  undergone  treatment  for  alcohol  use
disorder.  She  has concerns  that  he  is  a  high  risk  for  relapse.  She  observed
that  during  their interview,  Applicant  either  lacked  insight  into  his  problematic
alcohol  use  or  was intentionally  attempting
Applicant’s  prognosis
likely  to  be  impaired.  (Tr. 52-54; GE 2)
is guarded  and  his  judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  is
to  downplay  his  alcohol  use.
During his hearing, Applicant admitted that he was not truthful to the psychologist
during his interview. He said he was embarrassed to admit his alcohol use. When asked
what  has  changed,  he  said  he  is  getting  older  and  more  honest.  He  does  not  think
alcohol impacts his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. He said he tried Alcoholics
Anonymous  in  2018,  but  does  not  like  the  religious  connotations.  He  now  practices
meditation and yoga. (Tr. 52-54)
Applicant  consumes  alcohol  on  the  weekends  with  his  fiancée.  She  consumes
about the same amount of alcohol as he does. During a typical month during the football
season, they will watch games at their house on two weekends and the other two they
go
to one of his sisters’ houses, which are about ten miles away. Either his fiancée or he will
drive home after they have consumed alcohol. Applicant said he will wait about an hour
after  drinking  before  driving.  He  said  I’m  not  super  intoxicated,  I’m  just  sort  of  a  little
buzzed.”  (Tr. 58) He admitted he would likely be over the legal limit. When asked why
would he risk driving, he said they just want to get home. He estimated he has done this
about four or five times. He believes he had an alcohol problem in the past, but no longer
does. He does not intend to abstain from alcohol consumption because he enjoys it. He
stated  that when football season  is over, he will stop  drinking.  However, he  intends  to
resume when the new season starts. I did not find Applicant credible (Tr. 46-47, 54-60)
Applicant  testified  that  he  is  embarrassed  about  not  being  forthright  about  his
drinking. He is stronger now and is not going to let alcohol take over his life. He loves his
job and has been taking classes to improve his chances for professional advancement.
(Tr. 52-54)
",False
"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, the hearing testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is   43   years old.   He   enlisted   in   the   U.S.   Navy   following   his  graduation
from  high  school in 1996. He served  in the  Navy  until 2005. He has worked  as a  mechanic
for three  U.S.  Government contractors since  2006.  He  testified  that  he  has never held  a
security  clearance  because  he  was never required  to  have  one  to  access the  military  base
at which he works. He now requires a clearance,  and his current employer is sponsoring
him  to  meet  the  requirements for base  access. He has never married  and  has no  children.
In  2018,  he purchased  a  home  with  the  help of  his parents, who  live  with  him.  (Tr. at  37-
39, 88.)
Applicant has suffered from social anxiety since he was in high school. He began
drinking alcohol when he was a senior in high school. He self-medicated with alcohol to
try to control his anxiety. He has a history of  drinking to excess followed by periods of
sobriety. (Tr. at 41-42, 47-49.)
SOR Allegations
Paragraph  1,  Guideline  I  - The  SOR  sets  forth  five  allegations  regarding
Applicant’s psychological condition. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations with
explanations.  The  details  regarding  each  of  the  allegations  under  this  adjudicative
guideline (AG) are as follows:
1.a  Mental  health treatment from June 2009  to  about  March 2010  –  By  mid-
2009, Applicant’s anxiety  “was out of control.” He was drinking  alcohol heavily  at the  time.
He  experienced  additional stress due  to  an  arrest for driving  under the  influence  of  alcohol
(DUI) in November 2008  (SOR subparagraph  2.c). His relationship with  his girlfriend  was
also causing  him  stress. From  June  2009  to  June  2010,  he received  outpatient  mental
health  treatment for his anxiety.  He was prescribed  multiple  medications  for his condition.
His medical records note that he has a history of social anxiety disorder. (Answer at 2; Tr.
at 48-49; GE 4 at 3; GE 6 at 20, 24, 29.)
1.b  Involuntary  mental  health treatment  beginning in  August  2010, following
an episode of  anxiety  and hallucinations  –  A couple of months later, Applicant was
involuntarily hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and hallucinations. He reported
hearing “many voices” saying they will “kill him.” He was using alcohol excessively at the
time to self-medicate. Applicant was hospitalized after he searched in the area near his
home looking for the sources of the voices. When he could not find them, he experienced
suicidal thoughts and cut his arms several times. His roommate became concerned and
called an ambulance. His therapist diagnosed Applicant with “depression/psychosis” and
“alcohol induced psychosis.” When his involuntary commitment terminated, he continued
voluntary  inpatient  treatment  for  about  a  week.  He  then  continued  with  outpatient
treatment until February 2011. He was prescribed medications for depression, but he did
not want to stay on the drugs. He testified that his therapist at the time agreed that he
should stop taking prescription drugs, and he did. He also stopped his treatment with his
therapist due to his loss of insurance coverage because of a change of employers. At that
time, he was not drinking alcohol. (Tr. at 50-59; GE 4 at 3; GE 6 at 10, 15, 16.)
1.c   Mental   health  treatment  from  about   July   2014   to   October  2014   for  a
condition  diagnosed   as   social  anxiety   –   Applicant  continued  without  counseling  or
medication until July 2014. He does not recall why he sought mental health treatment at
that time. He testified that he might have been having difficulties with co-workers. He also
admitted that he had started drinking alcohol in early 2014. He decided to seek treatment
for his social anxiety. He did not explain why he stopped this treatment in October 2014.
As discussed below, he was arrested and charged with his third DUI in October 2014. He
stopped his mental health treatment that same month. (Tr. at 56-60, 71; Answer at 3.)
1.d  Inpatient   mental   health  treatment  from  March  2018   to   April   2018   for
alcohol detoxification  and treatment for hallucinations –  From  October 2014  to  March
2018, Applicant received  no  mental-health  treatment, although  he  participated  in  an  18-
month  court-ordered  alcohol  program  as  a  result of his October  2014  DUI. For a  period
prior to  March  2018, he  resumed  using  alcohol to  self-medicate.  He  was under stress at
work due  to  an  allegation  made  against  him  by  a  female  co-worker. In  March  2018,  he
voluntarily  admitted  himself  into  a  treatment facility  for alcohol  detoxification  because  he
realized  he  was drinking  “a little  too  much” and  was starting  to  hear voices again, though
he   testified   that  the   voices  were  not  as   loud   as   in  2010.   He  remained   hospitalized   for
seven  days and  then  was referred  to  an  outpatient program for   aftercare. According  to
the   records,   he   was  diagnosed   with   alcohol   use   disorder  and   alcohol   withdrawal.  He
testified, however,  that his use  of  alcohol was never discussed  when  he  was hospitalized.
He testified  that he  was only  treated  for  social anxiety. He was prescribed  medications
and  saw  his  physician  monthly  for several months  and  then  once  every  three  months. He
returned   to   working   a   night  shift at his job, which  helped   relieve   his social  anxiety.  He
believed  that he  no  longer needed  the  medications.  He did  not like  how  they  made  him
feel.  He testified that the drugs made  him  lose  his  motivation.  (Answer at 3;  Tr. at  61-66,
85; GE 4 at 4.)
Applicant  stayed  on  the  medications,  though,  until March  2020,  the  beginning  of
the  Covid-19  pandemic and  restrictions  on  certain activities. He  testified  that the  Covid-
19  restrictions in his state  made  it difficult for him  to  obtain  his medications.  He was feeling
better  so   he   did  not  “fight”  to   get  the   drugs.   He  did   not  want  to   take   the   drugs  for  his
anxiety. He  testified:
[W]hen  you  have  anxiety, you’re  gonna  get worked  up  at certain times and
that’s   the  only   times   you  need   that medication  and  that’s   the  only   - - you
know, ideal medication, that  would be  the  perfect time  and  it would just kick
in and work and calm  me  down. But it does that constantly.
You  take  it every  day  so  you’re  calm  and  even  calmer when  you  are  already
calm, so there goes your energy.
(Tr. at 76.)
After he stopped taking his medication in 2020, he began drinking again. He would
drink a beer or two at home with his father. He stopped drinking two or three months prior
to the hearing. He started going to the gym about the same time. He has not sought any
counseling  for  his  anxiety.  Now  that  he  understands  that  his  job  is  at  risk  without  a
clearance, he does not intend to drink alcohol. He is dealing with his anxiety as best as
he can. He admitted that he was extremely stressed learning about the date of the hearing
in  this  case.  Without  medication  or  counseling,  he  does  not  have  a  specific  plan  for
dealing with future stressful situations that cause him anxiety. He does better now with
his  parents  living  with  him  and  working  a  night  shift  when  there  are  fewer  co-workers
around him. He testified that drinking alcohol is not a good solution to his anxiety, though
in a moment of complete candor, he admitted that drinking helps temporarily after a day
full of stress. He testified that it was not difficult for him to stop drinking in the past. He
claimed that drinking is not an important part of his life. He further testified that if he cannot
deal with his anxiety, he has no problem seeking help from a mental health counselor “as
long as they’re not trying to push medication.” He also admitted that he has never been
given the option to participate in extended periods of individual counseling for his mental
health condition. (Tr. at 66-73, 86-92.)
1.e  November 2020  mental health evaluation by  a  licensed psychologist with
a  diagnosis  of  social  anxiety  disorder  and alcohol use  disorder, mild/moderate –
The  CAF requested  Applicant  submit to  a  psychological evaluation  in  connection  with  his
application  for a  security  clearance.  The  evaluation  by  a  licensed  psychologist  took place
in  November 2020. The  psychologist diagnosed  Applicant with  social  anxiety  disorder and
alcohol use  disorder, mild/moderate. He noted  that Applicant “has suffered  from  anxiety
since  adolescence,  which has developed  into  a  disorder.”  The  psychologist  noted  in his
prognosis  that “medication  treatment has largely  been  ineffective  and  [Applicant]  had  not
exhibited  a  pattern of stability  outside  of  working  during  the  night shifts.”  The  psychologist
concluded his prognosis with  the following  opinion: “[Applicant’s]  judgment and  reliability
are clearly  impacted  by  his diagnoses.”  Applicant offered  no  professional opinion  about
his mental health  in response  to  the  opinion  of  the  Government’s psychologist.  Applicant’s
counsel noted though that the Government’s expert had not discussed Applicant’s case
with his work colleagues who know him well. (Tr. at 104; GE 6 at 4-6; Answer at 3.)
Paragraph  2,  Guideline   G   -  The  SOR  sets  forth  seven  allegations  regarding
Applicant’s alcohol consumption. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations, with
one exception (SOR subparagraph 2.e), and provided additional information. The details
regarding each of the allegations under this adjudicative guideline (AG) are as follows:
2.a  Consumed alcohol, at times  in excess  and to  the  point  of   intoxication,
from  1996  to  at least November 2020  –
Applicant began drinking alcohol on the day of
his graduation from high school in 1996. He drank excessively and blacked out. After he
enlisted in the Navy, he started binge drinking following his initial training when he was
19 or 20 years old. He continued on and off  drinking, often to the point of intoxication,
until  two  of  three  months  prior  to  the  hearing.  He  has  also  had  extended  periods  of
sobriety  over  the  past  25  years,  typically  while  he  was  participating  in  court-ordered
classes and while seeing a therapist. (Tr. at 66-74; GE 2 at 4-5; Answer at 4.)
2.b November 2002  arrested for DUI  – Applicant’s first of three arrests for DUI
occurred  in  November 2002.  His  BAC  was  .15%.  He  was  convicted  and  sentenced  to
attend  an  alcohol  education  class  and  six  months  of  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings. Applicant was uncomfortable in the group setting of AA meetings, and he did
not  have  a  sponsor.  He  was  also  sentenced  to  five  years  of  probation  and  fined.  He
completed all of the requirements of his sentence. (SCA at 32; Tr. at 75-76; GE 3 at 3;
GE 4 at 2; Answer at 4.)
2.c   November  2008   arrested  for  DUI  –   After  the  completion  of  his  probation,
Applicant was arrested again for DUI. His BAC was .24%. He was again convicted. The
court sentenced Applicant to serve four days in jail and five years on probation. He was
also ordered to attend an 18-month DUI program and AA meetings and was fined. His
driver’s license was suspended for one year. (SCA at 33; Tr. at 76-77; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at

2.d October 2014  arrested for DUI –  Prior to his third DUI arrest, Applicant was
drinking  alone  at  his  residence  when  his  girlfriend  arrived.  He  was  drinking  alcohol  to
relieve stress and anxiety. He had completed his probation from his second arrest.  He
had an argument with his girlfriend and left the home in his car. His vehicle hit a telephone
pole and stopped. The police arrived and arrested him. He was convicted and sentenced
to  serve  four  days  in  jail,  to  attend  an  alcohol  education  program,  and  an  18-month
counseling  program.  He  was  also  ordered  to  attend  AA  meetings.  He  was  again
sentenced to serve five years on probation and was fined. He was on probation at the
time he submitted his application for a clearance. (SCA at 29-31; Tr. at 77-78; GE 2 at 4;
GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 2-3; Answer at 4.)
2.e  February  2015  arrested for DUI –  The FBI report for Applicant in the record
lists  a  DUI  arrest  of  Applicant  on  February  13,  2015.  Applicant  testified  that  this
information is incorrect and that he was not arrested for DUI a fourth time. The record
contains no  additional evidence  to  establish  that the  Government’s evidence  is correct.
(Tr. at  78, 82-83;  GE 2 at 4;  GE 3  at 4; Answer at 4.)
2.f Subparagraph 1.e,  above, cross-alleged  under Guideline  G –  As noted, the
psychologist’s diagnosis of Applicant included  “alcohol use disorder, mild/moderate.”  In
his Answer, Applicant’s attorney wrote that Applicant “does not dispute his diagnosis and
recognizes  that  the  consumption  of  alcohol places  his judgment  and  reliability at  risk.”
The  psychologist  viewed  Applicant’s  history  of  alcohol  use  as  “likely  a  form  of  self-
medication for his anxiety.” He commented further that Applicant’s “previous alcohol use
was likely significant enough to warrant a ‘severe’ modifier,” rather than “mild/moderate.”
He  noted  Applicant’s  three  DUI  convictions  and  repeated  periods  of  probation.  In  his
prognosis,  the  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant  continued  to  drink  alcohol  even
though Applicant “recognizes that alcohol may have a deleterious effect on him.” He wrote
further:
[Applicant] continues to consume alcohol and while this may be a response
to  his  heightened  anxiety,  it  still  places  him  at  risk  and  likely  hinders  his
engagement in treatment that could actually produce a sustainable effect.
As  such,  [I]  believe  that  [Applicant’s]  judgment  and  reliability  are  clearly
impacted by his diagnoses.
(Answer at 5; GE 4 at 6.)
2.g Continued drinking of  alcohol,  notwithstanding treatment  for a  condition
diagnosed as  alcohol  use  disorder, as  set forth  in subparagraph  1.d,  above  – In his
July  2021  Answer,  Applicant’s  attorney  wrote  that  Applicant  is  committed  to  a  life  of
sobriety. Applicant had advised the psychologist in November 2020 that he had reduced
his drinking to weekends. He also reported that he no longer consumes stronger alcoholic
drinks.  The  psychologist  correctly  noted  that  Applicant  had  advised  the  background
investigator who conducted his security clearance interview in April 2018 that he would
never consume alcohol again. In the investigator’s interview report, Applicant stated that
he has sought professional help to make sure that he does not drink again. Applicant also
testified that he was never ordered by a court to remain sober and that sobriety was never
a requirement of the DUI programs that he was required  by three courts to attend. He
stopped  drinking  on  his  own  during  the  periods  of  the  three  mandatory  DUI  classes.
(Answer at 5; Tr. at 79-80; GE 2 at 4; GE 4 at 3.)
Mitigation and Whole Person Evidence
Since 1996, when he was a Navy enlistee, Applicant has performed the same or
similar work. He is proud of his skills and work ethic. His current and former supervisors
praised his work and dedication to his job as a civilian contractor for the  military. They
have never experienced any difficulties due to Applicant’s consumption of alcohol or due
to his mental health issues. He has always been reliable. Other co-workers noted in letters
appearing in the record Applicant’s positive  attitude  and commented that he effectively
trains less experienced employees. His team lead wrote that Applicant “is an exemplary
employee and individual.” (Tr. at 19-35; AE C-F.)
Applicant provided his DD 214, which reflects that he was awarded several medals
and ribbons during his nine years of  military service. He noted proudly on his resume,
which is also in the record, that he received a Letter of Commendation from his squadron
in 2005 and a Letter of Appreciation from his Commanding Officer in 1998, as well as two
achievement medals. (AE A at 3; AE B.)
",False
"Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 50 years old. He earned an associate’s degree in 1994, a bachelor’s
degree  in  2000,  and  a  master’s  in  business  in  2018.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the
military  from  1994  to  2004  and  then  was  in  the  inactive  Reserve  until  2006.  He  was
honorably discharged as an E-6. He served in combat and earned a bronze star for valor.
After his discharge, he worked for federal contractors. He held a security clearance until
2014. He has never married. He has a 24-year-old son. (Tr. 25-27, 58; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  conduct.  In  May  1990,  he  was  arrested  and
charged with disorderly conduct, carrying a concealed weapon  (mace), and damage to
property-criminal  mischief.  He  was  found  guilty  of  the  misdemeanor  offenses.  No
information was provided regarding his sentence. (GE 3, 4)
Applicant was arrested in March 1991 and charged with disorderly conduct and
resisting an officer. He was acquitted of the charges. (GE 3)
Applicant was arrested in September 1993 and charged with carrying a concealed
weapon, resisting an officer, and obstruction. The charges were dismissed. (GE 3, 4)
Applicant was arrested in November 2002 and charged with disorderly intoxication,
public place cause disturbance, misdemeanor second degree. The charges were nolle
prossed.
In February 2006, Applicant was detained by law enforcement for several hours in
London, England, for being involved in a minor altercation. He was not arrested. (GE 2)
In June 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony aggravated battery
with a deadly weapon and armed burglary of a dwelling firearm possession. He had an
altercation with the ex-husband of his girlfriend, when they were picking up her two small
children.  Applicant  testified  at  his  hearing  that  his  girlfriend’s  children  were  with  their
father. Applicant and their mother, his girlfriend, went to pick them up. The children came
out of the house, and Applicant buckled the kids into their car seats, and then heard his
girlfriend scream from inside the house. He went inside and saw her ex-husband with a
sawed off shotgun. He wrestled it away from him. Applicant was terrified. He grabbed a
ceremonial sword from the wall and used it to hit the man’s arm. Applicant testified that
he reported the incident to the police and Applicant was arrested. The charges against
him were later dismissed. (Tr. 134-146, 154; GE 2, 5)
In 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault. He testified
that he was at a bar, having a private discussion with his friend, when a man intervened
and  they  got  into  an  argument.  Then  the  man  threw  a  wet  napkin  at  him.  Applicant
retaliated by throwing a napkin holder at the man and striking him in the face. Applicant
said he regretted his conduct and should not have thrown the object. (Tr. 118-119)
Applicant made a statement to police at the time of his arrest. He told them he and
a friend were walking by a bar and an employee of the bar singled him out and began
yelling at him. He began to yell back. He told the police he never went inside the bar and
remained outside during the verbal altercation.  He said the men from the bar began to
chase him and his friend. Applicant told the police he observed a hand gun. He said one
of them had brass knuckles with a knife attached and was waving it at him saying “come
on” in a threatening manner. He said he was in fear of his life. He testified that he lied to
the police. (Tr. 117-123; GE 2, 6, 7)
Witness  statements  and  a  surveillance  video  differ  from  Applicant’s  version  of
events. Applicant was inside the bar, and he began yelling at one of the employees, who
was later identified as the manager of the bar. Applicant gave him the middle finger and
the manager responded in kind. Applicant picked up a plastic napkin holder and threw it
at  the  manager,  striking  him  on  the  left  side  of  his  head.  The  manager  and  another
employee began chasing Applicant and his friend outside the bar and down the street.
While in pursuit, the manager called the police. Applicant had pepper spray and pointed
it at the manager, who turned away, and Applicant sprayed his back. The police arrived
and confiscated brass knuckles from the employee who ran with the manager. There was
no gun. (GE 2, 6, 7)
The  police  reviewed  the  videotape  and  noted  that  the manager was  behind  the
bar,  and  Applicant  walked  up  to  it  and  began  yelling  at  him.  Applicant  then  gave  the
manager the middle finger. The manager gave it back and then Applicant threw the napkin
holder at the manager, striking him on the side of the head. Applicant would not leave the
bar. The manager then called the police and he and his employee chased Applicant and
his  friend. Applicant  admitted  he  lied  to  the police  because  he  was  afraid  of  getting in
trouble. He said he later told the truth to the judge. He testified that the state decided not
to prosecute the charge in exchange for Applicant completing community service, which
he did. The charges were nolle prossed. He believed he also paid a fine. There were no
probation requirements. (Tr. 123-134, 151-152; GE 2, 6, 7)
In June 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery, aggravated assault
with  a  deadly  weapon,  a  firearm,  child  neglect  and  possession  of  a  firearm  in  the
commission of a felony. These charges were the result of an incident involving road rage.
Applicant’s testimony differs greatly from police reports and witness statements of what
transpired. Applicant claimed he was the victim. His son, 16 years old at the time, was in
the car with him. Applicant testified that the other vehicle tried to run him off the road. He
and the occupants of the other vehicle were cursing at each other back and forth while
driving. They met at a traffic light. He said his vehicle was blocked in by the other cars.
He testified that he got out of the vehicle and saw two men approaching his vehicle. He
asked them to leave and was attacked by two men. He pepper sprayed them. He thought
one had a knife because he was stabbed. Applicant then ran back to his car to retrieve
his  gun,  and  chambered  a  round.  The  man  was  crawling  away  from  Applicant  on  his
hands and feet, retreating. Applicant estimated he was maybe 10-15 feet away, but still
a threat. Applicant then walked over to the man and pointed the gun at him and asked
him where the knife was. The man ignored his command. Applicant then left the area and
was later stopped by the police. (Tr. 29-32, 76 -117, 158-172)
Applicant told the police that when he stopped his car, two men came to his vehicle
and tried to grab his son from the interior of the car and tried to fight him. Applicant was
defending himself. He went crazy when they tried to hit his son. He used pepper spray on
them to get them away. He took out his gun to hold them back. He was in fear for his and
his son’s lives. He told the police that after he stopped the car, a man who was not an
occupant of the other vehicles, who had been sitting on the curb, walked up to Applicant’s
vehicle and attacked him. Applicant pepper sprayed him, and they began to fight. Another
person, also not involved in the road rage, also began attacking him. Applicant told police
because these men were now chasing him he ran and got his gun from his car. He pointed
it at them. He said he feared for his life. When he realized they were no longer chasing
him, he left the scene. (GE 8)
Applicant’s son provided a statement to the police after the incident. He confirmed
there was a mutual road rage incident that occurred. While driving, his father retrieved
pepper spray and a hand gun from the glove box of the vehicle. When they stopped, a
woman  exited  the  other  vehicle  and  said  she  was  calling  the  police.  His  father  made
harassing statements to the woman. Then a man, not involved in the road rage, who his
son and others believed was trying to diffuse the situation, walked up to Applicant’s car
and his father reached into the vehicle and grabbed the pepper spray and spayed the
man. Then his father attacked the man, took him to the ground, and began fighting him.
His son stated this man did not attempt to attack his father. While on the ground, another
man came to the man’s assistance, and kicked Applicant in the face. Applicant and the
man on the ground continued fighting. The son was yelling at his father to stop fighting.
His father then kicked the man in the head. This man was able to get away and crossed
the street in retreat, where he collapsed. (GE 8)
Applicant’s  son  said  his  father  then  went  back  to  his  car,  retrieved  his  gun  and
pointed it at the second man who intervened and then pointed it at the first man. Applicant
admitted that when he went back for the gun there was a magazine in it with rounds and
he  chambered  one  round. He admitted  seeing  the  man  crawling  away  on  his hands and
knees.  He  walked  up  to  him  and  could  not  see  a  knife,  but yelled  at  him  to  drop  it, while
pointing  the  gun  at him. He then  kicked  the  man  in the  head. Applicant was wearing  boots
that had  4  one-inch  plastic spikes  in the  toe. Applicant  testified  he  wears the  boots for
protection. He  claimed  that even  though  the  man  was crawling  away  he  was still  a  threat.
His son’s statement said that Applicant then  ran  back to  the  car, put the  gun  between  the
driver’s seat and  the  console  and  the  pepper  spray  on  the  front  seat and  told  his son  they
needed  to leave the area before the police arrive.  (Tr. 76-117, 156-172; GE 8)
Numerous witness statements, including those with no direct interest in the case,
contradict  Applicant’s  version  of  what  happened  and  essentially  corroborate  his  son’s
statement. Applicant admitted that his initial statement to police was false. He denied that
he  got  pepper  spray  and  the  gun  out  of  the  car  console  while  they  were  still  driving,
contradicting what his son said. He believes the police coached or influenced his son’s
statement. I did not find Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 34, 76-117; GE 8)
Any  derogatory  information  that  was  not  alleged  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualifying  purposes,  however,  it  may  be  considered  in  making  a  credibility
determination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
A search of Applicant and his vehicle revealed one 40 caliber hollow-point bullet,
black gloves, three cans of mace, steel boots with spikes, a semi-automatic Glock gun,
and two Glock magazines, one with 12 rounds and one with 13 rounds. Applicant testified
that he has hollow-point bullets because they will do the most damage. A regular bullet is
not as accurate or efficient. He explained the hollow-point bullet is the standard to protect
your life. (Tr. 174-175; GE 8)
There were a total of nine charges against Applicant. He testified his bail was over
a million dollars. He was in jail for two months and under house arrest for another eight
months.  In  March  2015,  he  accepted  a  best-interest  guilty  plea  to  felony  aggravated
assault with a deadly weapon, and firearm possession. Adjudication was withheld on this
charge. The charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, a firearm, and improper
exhibition  of  a  dangerous  weapon  or  firearm,  were  nolle  prossed.  Applicant  was
sentenced to four years of probation, ordered to meet with his probation officer monthly,
50 hours of community service, and to pay $100 a month of court costs. He completed
his  community  service  and  his  probation  was  terminated  early  in  May  2017.  Although
Applicant’s probation  was terminated, no  court documents were produced  to  show  the
final adjudication of the charge. It likely was dismissed, but I do not have the documents
to corroborate the final disposition. Applicant testified that he pleaded guilty because he
ran out of money. He said he regretted the incident. He stated in his answer to the SOR:
“After  weighing  all  of  the  facts  of  the  case  carefully,  the  judge  elected  to  withhold
adjudication of guilt, although I admitted to pointing the firearm at the aggressor. I was
not found guilty of the alleged charges.” (Tr. 35-40, 74; Answer to the SOR; GE 9)
After Applicant completed  his probation, he  went back to  school, volunteered  at
the   VFW   and   created   a   veterans’  nonprofit   organization.  He   testified   he   sits   on   the
governing board for a charity and participates in other philanthropic projects. Tr. 37, 40-
43)
The  SOR  ¶  1.i  alleges  that  in  2017,  there  was  an  incident  report  made  to  the
university police   department,  where Applicant   was  attending  classes,  alleging he   had
made  a  threat  of  violence against   one  of  his  classmates.  The  incident  report  was  not
provided as evidence. Applicant denied he threatened a classmate. Without the incident
report  or  any  other  information  about  what  allegedly  occurred,  there  is  insufficient
evidence to corroborate a threat was made. I  find in Applicant’s favor on this allegation.
(Tr. 49-56, 60-74, 151)
In January 2017, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. His debts ($107,061) were
discharged in May 2017. He attributed his financial difficulties to his 2014 arrest. He lost
his job while he was in jail and was unable to pay his debts. He testified that he is now a
small business owner and works in real estate. No additional financial issues have been
raised. (Tr. 48-49, 146-149, 155-156; GE 11)
The  government  requested Applicant   undergo  a  psychological evaluation.   One
was conducted in October 2019 by a government-approved licensed clinical psychologist
who  is  a  board  certified  neuropsychologist.  As  part of   Applicant’s medical  history,  he
disclosed that he has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but did not seek treatment
for it until 2018. He underwent exposure therapy through the Veterans Affairs and found
it effective. He did not feel he would engage in any further violent interactions with others.
Applicant disclosed to the psychologist the 2011 incident at the bar where he threw
the napkin holder at the manager. He told the psychologist that the incident was his fault.
The  manager was  an Arab and  the  incident occurred  during the Arab up rising events.
When he saw something on the television, he became enraged and threw the object at
the manager. He said he attended individual and group anger management training and
learned how to calm himself.
Applicant also gave his version of the facts of the 2014 aggravated assault with a
deadly weapon incident. He said after a road rage incident, he was assaulted by two men,
who  he  assumed  were  part  of the   traffic  incident.  He  later  learned they   were  good
Samaritans. He said he pepper sprayed them and told them to stay back, but they did
not. He said they then assaulted him. He said that he eventually got away from the men
and went back to his car and pulled his gun out. The men ran away, and Applicant left
the scene. He denied he pulled the gun out  while he  was driving. After  discussing the
with the psychologist  he stated  “I used less violenc e than I could have in all of
ev
these situations.” (GE 10)
ents
The psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with  antisocial  personality  disorder  with
narcissistic traits.  She  did  not  see  any  signs  of  PTSD  at  present.  Based  on  his
background, she  concluded  that  his  personality  disorder  and  narcissistic  traits  are  a
security concern,  and  she  has  concerns  about  his  judgment,  trustworthiness,  and
reliability. His condition is pervasive and unlikely to improve, and his prognosis is poor.
(GE 10)
Applicant  apologized   for  the   mistakes   he   made.   He   said   he   had   to   make   split-
second  decisions and  he  made  some  wrong  ones. He was emotional at the  time. (Tr. 57-
58)
Applicant’s evidence included his medical record supporting his PTSD diagnosis.
He  also  provided  an  article  from  the  American  Journal  of  Psychiatry  from  2015  on
narcissistic personality disorder, copies of potential job offers, and documents from his
military  service  record.  He  provided  excerpts  from  his  performance  evaluations
throughout his military and civilian career, character statements from friends and family,
and certificates of completion, training, and transcripts. He is described as intelligent, a
team player, devoted, tenacious, respected, a leader, a person with integrity, a patriot,
and loyal. He is a small business owner and a realtor. (Tr. 150; Answer to the SOR; AE

",True
"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  with  explanations.  I  have
incorporated  those  admissions  into  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  38  years  old.  He  is  unmarried  and  has  no  children.  He  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in 2006 and has worked for a federal contractor since May 2017. (Tr.
72-73; GE 1)
In approximately 2000, Applicant was diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) when he was 16 years old. He had a decreased attention span and an
inability  to  focus.  He was  treated  with  Adderall  and  continued  to  see  a  doctor while  in
college.  In  about  2005,  when  he  was  21  years  old,  he  was  diagnosed  with  Bipolar
Disorder. His doctor prescribed various mood stabilizers, including lithium. (Answer to the
SOR)
In  2007,  Applicant  was  voluntarily  admitted  to  a  hospital  for  mental  health
treatment. He was given a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, Manic, Adderall Dependence,
and Cannabis Dependence. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He testified that he took Adderall as prescribed
and did not abuse it. His history of marijuana use will be discussed below. (Answer to the
SOR)
Applicant  found  that  lithium  was  the  most  effective  medication  for  his  bipolar
symptoms, and he took it regularly, as prescribed, beginning in about 2008. From 2010
to 2014, he was voluntarily under the care of Dr. K for mental health treatment (SOR ¶
1.c). Around June 2013, Dr. K became concerned about Applicant’s kidney function due
to long-term use of lithium and discontinued it and another prescription he was on. After
discontinuing  lithium  and  trying  other  prescribed  medications,  Applicant  experienced
mood destabilization and was hospitalized several times for medicine management. (Tr.
35-36; Answer to the SOR)
Applicant was voluntarily admitted to the hospital in about June 2013, for mental
health  medication  stabilization  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  The  SOR  alleges  that  it  was  because  he
discontinued  use  of  his  medication  two  months  before  and  was  experiencing  paranoia
and delusions. The discontinuation of his medicine, lithium, was pursuant to his doctor’s
orders.  The  discharge  diagnosis  from  the  hospital  was  Bipolar  Disorder  and  Attention
Deficit Disorder by History. (Tr. 35-36; Answer to SOR)
Applicant voluntarily admitted himself to the hospital in about May 2014. He was
traveling at the time and was in a different state. He began to experience adverse effects
from the recent changes to his medication and went to the emergency room. He advised
the  medical  professionals  that  he  was  having  problems  with  his  medication  and  was
concerned for his well-being. He contacted his family, his emergency contact, and told
them his concerns. Changes were made to his medication, but he indicated it was only
temporarily successful at that time. His discharge diagnosis was Bipolar I Disorder, Manic,
Severe with Psychotic Behavior, and Attention Deficit Disorder (SOR ¶ 1.d). (Answer to
SOR)
Later  in  2014,  Applicant  moved  to  a  new  state  and  received  treatment  for  his
bipolar disorder from Dr. S, a psychiatrist, from about August 2014 to January 2015 (SOR
¶ 1.e). Dr. S tried different medications with limited success. Applicant stated in his SOR
answer  that  this  was  the  first  time  he  had  a  relatively  short  period  of  treatment  with  a
doctor because he had moved to a new city. (Answer to SOR)
Applicant voluntarily admitted himself to a hospital in January 2015 under the care
of Dr. S. He felt his move to a new state had exacerbated his bipolar disorder (SOR ¶
1.g).  The  discharged  diagnosis  was  Bipolar  I  Disorder,  most  recent  episode  manic,
severe,  without  psychotic  features,  and  Cannabis  Abuse.  Applicant  stated  in  his  SOR
answer that he did not feel like it was an acute diagnosis or that Dr. S’s course of treatment
was sufficiently managing his disorder. (SOR ¶ 1.g). He then decided to move back to his
home  state  where  there  were  more  medical  options,  and  he  had  a  stronger  support
system. (Answer to SOR)
From August 2014 to February 2015, while Applicant was being treated by Dr. S,
he was also seeing a non-psychiatric mental health professional, Ms. H. He found she
presented a different approach to treating his condition and made him consider the non-
medical and psychological aspects of his disorder, which he found beneficial (SOR ¶ 1.f).
(Answer to SOR)
Applicant  moved  back  to  his  home  state  and  in  approximately  April  2015,  he
voluntarily  admitted  himself  to  the  hospital  for  mental  health  medication  management.
(SOR ¶ 1.h). He had completed the dosages of the medication prescribed by Dr. S. He
was provided by the hospital medical professionals with three months of medication and
was referred to a directory of local psychiatrists who took his health insurance. He found
the hospital stay productive and beneficial. (Answer to SOR)
From the directory of local psychiatrists, Applicant sought mental health treatment
from Dr. F and saw her from July 2015 to November 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.i). He selected this
provider because the practice accepted his health insurance, and he wanted to go to a
general medical practice. He stated in his SOR answer that it was a horrible experience.
He was prescribed a high  dose of a strong medication that had potential adverse side
effects. He had a strong physical reaction to the medicine, which led him to believe he
had been misdiagnosed and mistreated. Because of his experience, he changed doctors.
Dr. F diagnosed him with Other Stimulant Abuse, Schizoaffective Disorder Bipolar Type,
Cannabis Dependence, and Alcohol Abuse. Applicant stated in his SOR answer that he
does not know what “other stimulant abuse” means and that he does not believe he has
a schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. He said he would not be able to function at his
job with that condition.  He stated that he did not misuse medications or take ones  not
prescribed. He does not abuse alcohol. He testified that Dr. F misdiagnosed him and put
him on so much medication that he felt like a zombie. Shortly after his treatment with her,
he saw Dr. C. He admitted he was using cannabis before he began treatment with Dr. F,
but had not used it since before he applied for a security clearance. He admits he uses
alcohol, but it has never been a problem, in terms of his mental or physical health, his
career, or his personal life. (Tr. 29-31; Answer to SOR)
Applicant began seeing Dr. C in December 2015 and has  continued to see him
(SOR ¶ 1.j). He stated in his SOR answer that the treatment under Dr. C’s care has been
a “game changer” for him and successful. He has had no major issues and his bipolar
disorder  and  ADHD  are  under  control.  He  takes  his  medication  as  prescribed  and
maintains regular appointments with Dr. C. He has developed a strong relationship with
Dr. C, who is responsive to his medical issues. Applicant is confident that he will continue
to have success with Dr. C. (Answer to SOR)
Applicant stated in his SOR answer and his testimony that he takes treatment for
his bipolar disorder seriously. He takes responsibility for all of his conduct. He stated his
bipolar disorder has not and will not cause a significant defect in his psychological, social,
and occupational functioning.  He  has  been  under Dr.  C’s  continuous  care  since  2015,
and his condition has been under control and stable. Dr. C has not diagnosed him with
Schizoaffective Bipolar Disorder during his course of care since 2015. (Tr. 32-34; AE A;
Answer to SOR)
A letter from Dr. C confirms Applicant is his patient. He stated Applicant has been
attending his monthly appointments and taking his medications as prescribed. He stated
that Applicant’s condition has been stable in recent years. (AE A; Answer to SOR)
Applicant admitted he began using marijuana when he was 15 years old and was
using it daily for a significant period of time. He used it regularly throughout college. From
2007 to 2015, marijuana was a significant part of his life, and he used it to self-medicate.
His medical records note that marijuana use was a treatment concern. Applicant reduced
his use in 2015 because it was no longer part of his lifestyle and he had concerns about
its use and his mental health. Eventually, he stopped using it. He credibly testified that he
has not used marijuana since 2017. Some of the states where Applicant used marijuana
had legalized it’s use under their state laws. (Tr. 25-26; GE 8
Applicant was not honest during his background interview about his marijuana use.
When confronted by the investigator, he disclosed he started using it in 2013, which was
untrue. At some point, he was told by doctors to stop using marijuana as it could increase
his bipolar symptoms. During his testimony, Applicant initially attempted to minimize the
severity  of  his  prior  use,  but  he  admitted  he  used  it  throughout  high  school,  but  not
regularly. He used it frequently in college. He reduced his use in 2006, and continued to
use it on a regular basis until 2015. He used it a couple of times in 2016 and 2017. (Tr.
49-62; GE 8)
A psychological evaluation was conducted in April 2020 by a government approved
licensed  clinical  psychologist,  Dr.  B.  She  based  her  opinion  on  Applicant’s  medical
records  showing  he  had  been  in  and  out  of  treatment  for  bipolar  disorder  and
schizoaffective disorder, and he had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations. She noted
that Dr. F, one of Applicant’s previous treating physicians, provided this diagnosis in 2015,
after seeing him for five months in 2015. None of his other treating physicians diagnosed
him  with  schizoaffective  disorder.  In  addition,  Dr.  B  noted  that  “although  his  current
psychiatrist  gave  a  favorable  medical  opinion,  three  previous  doctors/therapist  did  not
recommend  that  he  be  adjudicated  favorably,  and  they  noted  that  [Applicant]  has  a
condition that could impair his judgment, reliability, and/or ability to safeguard classified
information.” (Tr. 29; GE 7)
Dr.  B  did  not  identify  the  providers who  made  those  recommendations  or when
they were made. Applicant does not know which providers are being referred to by Dr. B.
According to his record, Dr. S, a previous mental health provider, opined that Applicant’s
prognosis was good, if he complied with his treatment plan. Ms. H. opined that Applicant’s
condition could interfere with his  judgment, if he did not follow his treatment plan.  The
third  referenced provider is unknown, but may  be  the doctor  Applicant  saw  in  January
2015, during a hospital stay, who included in his notes “judgment remains impaired due
to current mental state.” (Tr. 29-32; GE 7, 8)
The medical records and evidence noted in GE 2, 3, 4 ,5, 6, and 8, do not contain
any  statements  by  mental  health  providers  corroborating  Dr.  B’s  assertion  that  other
providers  did  not  recommend  Applicant’s  security  clearance  be  adjudicated  favorably
because  he  has  a  condition  that  impaired  his  judgment,  reliability,  and/or  ability  to
safeguard classified information.
Applicant  reported  in his response  to  government  interrogatories and  during  his
testimony that Dr. B said she would contact Dr. C, his treating physician for the past seven
years for information about his medical history. He said that he had spoken to Dr. C in
July 2020, and Dr. B had not contacted him before she issued her report. (Tr. 28; GE 8)
Applicant  testified  that  Dr.  B’s  report  reflects  inaccuracies  from  information  he
provided to her. He clarified that his current diagnosis is bipolar disorder and ADHD. He
disputes that he misused medications. Dr. B noted that her opinion was also based on
Applicant’s  financial  problems,  adverse  opinions  from  three  previous  providers,  and
insubordination and personality conflicts with colleagues and supervisors at work, among
other things. (Tr. 20)
Applicant explained that he told Dr. B that he was prescribed one to two tablets of
a medication to take in the morning and one tablet at night.  Sometimes he  took a half
tablet in the morning and one tablet at night. If he felt he was under acute stress, he would
take a whole tablet in the morning, as prescribed. Dr. B indicated in her report that he
slipped up and sometimes took more medicine than prescribed. Applicant disagrees with
her statement. (Tr. 26-27; GE 7)
During Applicant’s February 2018 interview with a government investigator, it was
brought to his attention that in 2016 he had two delinquent debts in collection. One credit
card debt for $500 and another medical bill for $107. He was unaware of the debts and
when the credit card company contacted him, he paid the debt. He also was unaware of
the medical debt because it was sent to the wrong address. He paid it. He has no other
financial issues. It is unknown what financial problems Dr. B is referring to. (GE 8)
Dr. B reported in her opinion that Applicant had issues at work with colleagues and
a former supervisor. During Applicant’s 2018 background interview, he disclosed he had
a  personality  conflict  with  a  supervisor  where  he  was  employed  in  2016.  He  did  not
receive  a  bad  performance  evaluation,  but  he  believes  his  request  for  a  raise  had
something to do with him leaving. He testified that his supervisor embarrassed him in front
of colleagues, which caused him to act emotionally. He walked into her office one day,
and she commented that he smelled and made her want to vomit. Applicant explained
that at the time he was a smoker. He was never disciplined for his conduct and he never
disclosed  confidential  information.  He  left  this  employment  by  mutual  agreement.  He
concurred that he had some challenges at this company. Dr. B noted that Applicant has
been employed with his current company since May 2017, almost three years at the time
of his evaluation. (Tr. 21-25, 67)
Applicant also disputed Dr. B’s references that Applicant reported a family history
of involvement with the KKK and other racist organizations in June 2013. The medical
record reflects the following entry for past history: “He has a family history of suicide-both
mom and dad (racism, KKK, attempts).” The entry was made by a doctor during a hospital
stay. No additional information is provided about this entry. (GE 7, 8). Applicant testified
that  he  has  no  involvement  with  hate  groups  and  that  his  family  is  Jewish  and  this
reference is untrue. (Tr. 66)
Dr.  B  had  Applicant  complete  a  Personality  Assessment  Inventory  test  and  a
Positive Impression Management test. Applicant testified that he is not Dr. B’s patient and
he had a short interview with Dr. B one time by videoconference. His treating physician
continues to be Dr. C. (GE 7)
Based  on  the  above  psychological  testing,  interview,  and  review  of  Applicant’s
medical records, Dr. B opined in her April 2020 evaluation that Applicant had diagnosable
mental  health  conditions:  Bipolar  I  Disorder  (severe,  with  psychotic  features),  ADHD
(combined presentation), and Cannabis Use Disorder (by history, moderate, in sustained
remission. She concluded:
treatment  provider  gave  a
Taken  together,  the  risk  of  future  hospitalizations  seems  moderate.
Although  [Applicant’s]  current
favorable
prognosis, his current presentation, as well as his personal and behavioral
health  history  must  be  taken  into  account  (e.g.  numerous  psychiatric
hospitalizations,  adverse  medical  opinions  from  three  former  providers,
abuse of prescription medications, deny history of illegal drug use, financial
problems,
insubordination/personality  conflicts  with  colleagues  and
supervisors at work, etc.). (GE 7)
Dr. B acknowledged that in recent years Applicant seems to have gained some
insight  and  is  balanced  of  late,  but  his  previous  pattern  of  behavior  must  not  be
overlooked.  She  concluded  that  Applicant  presents  with  conditions  that  could  pose  a
significant risk to national security. (GE 7)
In December 2021, Applicant’s attorneys requested Dr. NS, a forensic and board
certified  general  psychiatrist,  conduct  an  evaluation  of  Applicant  with  the  purpose  of
answering the following questions: Does Applicant present with any condition that could
pose  a  significant  risk  to  national  security?;  Does  Applicant  have  any  medical,
psychological, psychiatric, emotional, or substance use conditions which could impair his
judgment,  reliability,  or  trustworthiness;  and  Whether  Applicant  has  a  propensity  for
behavior  that  could  pose  a  risk  to  national  security,  such  as  disclosing  confidential
information to unauthorized persons due to his mental health conditions.
Dr. NS advised Applicant that she was conducting a psychiatric evaluation and no
doctor-patient relationship would be established. She also said that information Applicant
conveyed  could  be  either beneficial  or detrimental  and  could be  included  in her  report
which  would  be  forwarded  to  his  attorneys.  She  told  him  she  was  providing  an
independent evaluation. (Tr. 42; AE H)
In formulating her evaluation and report, Dr. NS noted her sources of information
as follows:
-In  person  clinical  interview  of  Applicant  (December  11,  2021)  of  1.5  hours’
duration.
-Clinical  interview  via  videoconference  of  Applicant  (December  28,  2021)  of  35
minutes’ duration.
-Phone interview with Mr. K, Applicant’s current supervisor (December 28, 2021).
-Phone interview with Dr. C, Applicant’s treating physician (December 20, 2021).
-Phone interview with both parents of Applicant (December 17, 2021).
-Outpatient  mental  health  progress  notes  from  Dr.  C  from  December  2015  to
August 2021.
-Letter from DOHA Department Counsel (April 21, 2021).
-Summary of Psychological Evaluation by Dr. B (April 9, 2020).
-Records of DOD CAF subject interview investigation (May 11, 2018 until June 6,
2018).
-Current employer performance appraisals from May 2020-April 2021; May 2019
to May 2020; May 2018-May 2019; May 2017 to June 2018.
-Outpatient mental health progress notes from Dr. S from August 2014 to January
2015.
-Medical records from Applicant’s psychiatric hospitalizations from 2007 to 2015.
Dr. NS noted that during her interview with Applicant, he acknowledged his past
marijuana use starting when he was 15 and at one point using it daily. He has not used
marijuana since 2017. One hospital record notes his misuse of Adderall during periods of
bipolar  disorder.  Applicant  reported  he  has  complied  with  his  prescribed  medicine
regiment and Dr. C verified this. He reported he drank alcohol heavily in college, and his
current rate of consumption is two drinks per week. (AE H)
Applicant disclosed his past psychiatric history, which is consistent with his prior
medical records. The records report as follow: He was diagnosed with ADHD when he
was 16 and treated with Adderall; diagnosed with a bipolar disorder when he was 21 and
prescribed  several  medications,  including  lithium,  which  was  effective  in  treating  his
symptoms;  treated  by  Dr.  K  from  2010  to  2014,  and  taken  off  lithium  due  to  renal
complications;  destabilization  and  several  hospitalizations;  under  the  care  of  various
physicians  in  three  different  states;  began  seeing  Dr.  C  in  December  2015;  stable  on
medications and has not required further hospitalizations. He sees Dr. C 11-13 times a
year. (AE H)
Dr. NS reviewed treatment notes from doctors and medical records from each of
Applicant’s  past  hospitalizations,  which  included  the  diagnoses  made  at  the  time  of
admission; the drugs he was prescribed; his state of being; observations of Applicant’s
behavior at the time; and opinions of the providers. Dr. NS noted that both Dr. S and Ms.
H treatment notes reflected that Applicant’s prognosis was good if he  remained on his
treatment plan. (AE H)
Dr.  NS  reviewed  Dr.  C’s  treatment  notes  from  December  2015,  which  reflected
Applicant was being prescribed different medicines to stabilize his condition. In February
2016, he noted Applicant was stable. Dr. C considered a diagnosis of major depression
as  a  primary  concern,  along  with  ADHD,  and  cannabis  use  disorder.  In  May  2016,  he
noted Applicant reduced his marijuana use and his medications were adjusted. In June
2016, Applicant had mild depression. In July 2016, Dr. C noted euthymic and stable mood,
and diagnosed him with Bipolar Disorder, type 2. Notes from 2019 report that Applicant’s
mood was stable, but his alcohol intake had increased. He was advised to reduce it. He
was  not  diagnosed  with  an  alcohol  use  disorder.  In  2020,  Applicant  had  seven
appointments  with  Dr.  C  from  February  through  October.  The  records  reflect  stable
moods, no evidence of safety concerns, no evidence of psychosis, and no evidence of
substance abuse. The last available note from Dr. C was from August 2021, which noted
that Applicant’s mood was stable and no medication change was recommended. (AE H)
Dr. NS’s December 2021 report includes a section titled - History of Present Illness.
It  states  that  Applicant  does  not  present  with  any  symptoms  of  depression,  bipolar
disorder, psychosis, anxiety or panic attacks. His previous symptoms are well managed
with his current medication program. There was no evidence of interpersonal difficulties,
work-related  concerns,  self-injurious  behavior,  or  safety  concerns.  His  ADHD  is  under
control  with  medication.  There  is  no  evidence  of  a  personality  disorder  that  can  be
manifested as maladaptive and rigid patterns of thinking, impulsive actions, self-harming
behaviors, chaotic inter-personal relationships. Applicant has not demonstrated behavior
consistent with these. (AE H)
Dr. NS noted that a diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder was considered early in
Applicant’s illness, but was ruled out. Also ruled out were other psychiatric disorders and
phobias. Applicant’s current state of being is positive, and he derives satisfaction from his
work accomplishments  despite  having  bipolar disorder-related  challenges  earlier  in his
life. He believes having to overcome these challenges has taught him valuable lessons.
He is on the board of directors of a family foundation. He acknowledges he is a bit cocky
and can brag about himself. (AE H)
Dr.  NS  conducted  a  mental  status  examination  of  Applicant.  She  observed  his
thought processes were logical, rational and cohesive.  The examination did not reveal
any expansive ideations, grandiosity, impulsivity or delusional thinking. He did not display
deficits in his cognitive processes. Applicant’s insight was excellent. He understood his
illness  and  his  need  for  treatment.  His  judgment  was  excellent  as  evidenced  by  his
continued adherence with medications, sobriety from substances and interpersonal and
occupational performance. (AE H)
Dr. NS spoke with Mr. K, Applicant’s current supervisor, who described Applicant
as  an  exemplary  employee  and  his  work  performance  has  been  stellar.  He  has  never
known Applicant to have oppositional behaviors or having an inability to work in a team
setting or for being disruptive at work. He never felt Applicant had problems with authority
or been distracted or late with assignments. He had no concerns about Applicant’s ability
to maintain  confidentiality.  Applicant’s performant appraisals since  May  2017  indicated
excellence and initiative at work. (AE H)
Dr. NS’s opinion and recommendation regarding Applicant’s current mental health
conditions based on the security clearance requirements are as follows:
Applicant meets the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
Edition  (DSM-5)  criteria  for  Bipolar  Disorder,  type  1,  most  recent  episode  depressed
without psychotic features in full remission. Dr. NS  reported this diagnosis is based on
historical symptoms, noting Applicant’s past episodes and hospitalizations for medicine
management. Applicant achieved stability in late 2015, had some depressive symptoms
in  2016,  and  has  had  no  mood  episodes  since.  Applicant  has  a  history  of  recognizing
early  sign  of  issues  and  reaching  out  to  providers  when  needed.  He  has  maintained
medication  adherence  and  stability  since  2015.  He  has  excelled  in  his  career,
demonstrated  excellent  work  performance  without  any  derogatory  behavior  and
maintains healthy relationships. His diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder has had no negative
impact on his occupational or interpersonal relationships in over five years. “As long as
[Applicant]  maintains  medication  adherence  and  good  communication  with  his  treating
providers, his prognosis is good.” (AE H)
Applicant  meets  the  DSM-5  criteria  for  ADHD,  predominantly  inattention
presentation.  Dr.  NS  noted  that  Applicant  has  been  on  two  medications  for  it  and  his
condition is stable. The only misuse of Adderall was during adolescence. Since then he
has  been  compliant  with  good  effect  and  good  adherence.  Dr.  NS  noted  that  this
diagnosis  is  based  on  historical  symptomatology,  as  Applicant  is  clinically  stable  on
medications.  She  noted  that,  when  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  ADHD  as  an
adolescent,  he  did  not  manifest  behavior  disinhibition,  impulsivity,  or  novelty  seeking
behaviors. Instead, he demonstrated good behavior, attendance, peer acceptance, and
good academic attainment in school. (AE H)
Applicant  meets  the  DSM-5  criteria  for  Cannabis  Use  Disorder,  mild,  in  full
sustained remission. Dr. NS noted that Applicant has not used marijuana for years. He
used it to cope with symptoms of  his bipolar disorder after lithium was discontinued in
2013. Applicant does not endorse  heavy  alcohol use  or any  other drugs.  Based on  all
available information, Applicant does not meet the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder. (AE
H)
Applicant meets the DSM-5 criteria for Tobacco Use Disorder, moderate. Dr. NS
noted  that  this  has  no  bearing  on  Applicant’s  mental  health  conditions  based  on  all
available records. (AE H)
Dr. NS found that Applicant has demonstrated emotional and psychiatric stability
for  over  five  years,  medication  adherence,  abstinence  from  cannabis,  consistency  of
treatment with Dr. C, excellent work performance  since 2017, and stable interpersonal
relationships. She concluded:
Thus, he does not pose any risks to national security based on his mental
health conditions at this time. However, it is recommended that he continue
to  follow  up  with  his  psychiatrist  regularly  and  continue  to  adhere  with
medications and abstain from Cannabis and Alcohol to maintain remission
of his conditions. (AE H)
Applicant included copies of performance evaluations from 2017 through 2021. His
2017 through 2020 overall rating was “exceeds expectations,” the second highest rating.
10
His  2021  rating  was  “exceptional,”  the  highest  rating.  In  2019,  Applicant  received  his
company’s “major sustained performance award” for his superlative efforts in establishing
a corporate program management office. In 2020, he was recognized as an outstanding
team member for achievement and contributions to his team. (AE B, C, D, E, F, G)
Applicant’s current supervisor testified on his behalf. Applicant has worked for him
since  2018  and  has  daily  interaction  with  him.  He  describes  him  as  an  outstanding
employee and is one of his top employees. He is professional and has exhibited good
demeanor. He holds himself accountable and is able to handle all of the issues that arise.
He believes Applicant is trustworthy and can protect classified and sensitive information.
Applicant testified that he has an excellent relationship with is supervisor and considers
him a mentor. (Tr. 41, 74-79)
The corporate support manager, who serves as the facility security officer and is
the human resource manager, testified. She worked with hiring Applicant five years ago
and  they  are  on  the  same  team.  She  interacts  with  Applicant  at  least  weekly  and
sometimes daily. She described him as a dedicated employee focused on improving the
company.  He  is  enthusiastic  in  his  work.  He  is  passionate,  driven,  accountable  and
responsible. She believes he is trustworthy and capable of protecting information. (Tr. 80-
85)
Applicant’s  mother  testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  She  has  noticed  a  significant
change in Applicant’s demeanor since 2015. He is happier, responsible, and has found a
career he is excited about. In the past years he has become stronger. He is committed to
his  own  well-being.  She  believes  the  changes  are  due  to  finding  the  right  doctor  and
maintaining compliance with his medication requirements. She noticed that he is proud
of the work he is doing and is motivated to do well. He feels appreciated and valued. (Tr.
86-92)
Applicant’s brother testified on behalf of Applicant. He is a retired military member
with  29  years  of  service  and  holds  a  Top  Secret  security  clearance.  He  works  as  a
program manager for a military component. In the past few years, since his retirement
from the military,  he  and  Applicant have  had  more  interaction.  He has  seen  a  positive
change in his brother in the last several years. Based on his background and experience
dealing with classified information, he believes Applicant can maintain the requirements
to hold a security clearance. (Tr. 92-97)
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  he  has  been consistently  treated  by  Dr.  C since
2015, and he is following the prescribed treatment plan. He stated: “It’s very important to
me, I take it very seriously. The success that I’ve achieved, the impact of following the
treatment has been monumental in positive outcomes for my life that I take very seriously
and  maintain.”  (Tr.  32)  He  intends  to  follow  his  doctor’s  treatment  plans.  He  does  not
intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He believes he is capable of protecting classified
and sensitive information. (Tr. 32, 41; 43-44; AE A)

"Applicant  is  a  31-year-old,  single  man.  He  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in
electrical  engineering  and  computer  engineering  in  2014,  and  he  earned  a  bachelor’s
degree in computer networking in 2016. (Tr. 78) Since 2017, he has been working for a
defense contractor as a technical writer. (GE 2 at 7) In August 2010, Applicant received
a two-year appointment to the position of student trainee at a government agency. (GE 5
at 1) Per the terms of the appointment, Applicant was eligible to be hired full time after
completing the internship.
On July 21, 2011, at an off-site  party that  Applicant’s agency  organized for their
interns, Applicant and some fellow interns discussed the imminent visit to a local college
by  the  President  of  the  United  States  (POTUS).  (GE  4  at  1)  During  the  conversation,
Applicant  said  that  security  would  not  be  stringent  enough  to  protect  the  president
because there were multiple ways to make homemade bombs that could be used against
him. He then retrieved his personal laptop to show the other interns a manual about how
to make explosives. (GE 4 at 1)
The  following  month,  the  base  police  where  Applicant  and  the  interns  worked
received  a  complaint  about  Applicant’s  comments  at  the  party,  which  prompted  an
investigation. (GE 4 at 1) The U.S. Secret Service were briefed on the incident. The base
investigators interviewed Applicant who advised that he was not threatening the base, the
president, or anyone else, and was just interested in chemistry and explosives. Applicant
agreed  to  a  forensic  examination  and  review  of  his  laptop  computer.  The  subsequent
inspection found several files related to weapons, but “no notable files . . . identified which
indicate[d]  an  aspiration  to  construct  explosive  devices  or  indicate  a  threat  against  a
person or structure.” (GE 4 at 2)
The investigator also interviewed the student interns at the party who had engaged
in the conversation with Applicant.  (GE 4 at 1) Per the  investigator, “no one perceived
[Applicant’s] comments or actions as threatening or as a specified threat to POTUS or a
government  facility.”  (GE  4  at  2)  Applicant’s  supervisor  was  interviewed.  He  told  the
investigator  that  Applicant  “was  not  believed  to  be  a  threat,  due  to  his  involvement  in
conducting  mathematical  data  and  inert  explosives  after  testing  as  part  of  his  work
assisting . . . various programs” at work. (GE 4 at 1) Subsequently, in October 2011, the
investigation determined that no threats that had been made against a person or facility,
nor had any criminal violations occurred, and the case was closed. (GE 4 at 2)
Applicant completed  the  internship  that summer. (GE 2  at 7)  In  November  2011,
Applicant e-mailed  his employer and  asked  about  work over the  holiday  break. (GE D)  In
an e-mail response, Applicant’s  employer replied, “I just want to inform you that we don’t
have  any  work for you  this winter[,]  and  that  we  would not be  able  to  bring  you  back   at
this  time.”  (GE  D)   Applicant  then   received   a   closeout  packet  with   instructions  on
transferring  his thrift savings plan, and  instructions on  how  to  return  his CAC card. (Tr.
85)  Applicant’s  former  supervisor  then   called   him.   During   their   conversation,  the
supervisor did not say  anything  to  give  Applicant a  reason  to  think  that he  was terminated
for any reason other than that which was stated in  the email. (Tr. 86)
Six years later, during an investigative interview, the investigative agent confronted
Applicant about the circumstances of his departure from the 2011 internship, alleging that
he was terminated for making inappropriate comments which caused other employees to
feel  uncomfortable  working  with  him.  (GE  2  at  6)  Applicant  denied  this  allegation,
contending that he did not recall making any inappropriate comments to coworkers, and
that  he  never  received  any  follow-up  correspondence  about  the  circumstances  of  his
termination after receiving the November 2011 e-mail, as referenced above. (GE 2 at 6;
Tr.  87)  He  has  come  to  understand  since  the  2017  investigative  interview  that  the
comments that precipitated the base police investigation contributed to his dismissal. (Tr.
110)
The  record  evidence  contains  a  termination  letter,  dated  December  1,  2011,
referencing inappropriate comments to other employees. (GE 5) Its certification of receipt
block is unsigned and undated. (GE 5 at 2)
The  Government  initiated  Applicant’s  current  security  clearance  investigative
process  in  2017.  (GE  1  at  1)  As  part  of  the  process,  Applicant  was  referred  to  a
psychologist  for an  evaluation  “to  clarify  his current  mental  health  status.”  (GE  3  at  5)
After a one-hour interview, she characterized  him  as “an  eccentric,  self-absorbed man
with  poor  social  skills.”  (GE  3  at  5)  Moreover,  when  he  denied  making  inappropriate
comments at his internship, she characterized him as “blindly unaware and uncritical of
any faults or imperfections,” and concluded that this was “extremely concerning.” (GE 3
at 6) Ultimately, she concluded that his behavior cast doubt on his judgement, reliability,
and trustworthiness. (GE 3)
The psychologist also criticized Applicant for being “extremely guarded about the
details of his internship” during the evaluation. (GE 3 at 5) She interviewed Applicant in a
café at a bookstore with several patrons sitting at tables nearby. (Tr. 53, 55) Failure to
conduct  psychological  evaluations  in  a  private  setting  is a  violation  of  a  psychologist’s
ethical obligation to ensure privacy and confidentiality during consultations. (GE A at 15)
I
Applicant  has  been  attending  therapy  in  the  two  years  since  the  psychologist
evaluated him. (Tr. 43) When asked on direct examination if this changed her opinion, the
psychologist responded that “a lot can change psychologically in two years,” and that her
assessment was “a snapshot of the individual at the time” it was conducted. (Tr. 43)
In August 2021, two years after Applicant was evaluated by the psychologist at the
bookstore café, he was evaluated by a licensed  clinical social worker (LCSW). (GE A)
She conducted the evaluation in a secured, encrypted, video teleconference platform to
ensure  confidentiality.  (AE  A  at  2)  The  session  lasted  four  hours.  She  concluded  that
Applicant  had  “a  strong  indication  of  Asperger’s  syndrome,  a  neurodevelopmental
disorder  characterized  by  significant  difficulties  in  social  interaction  and  nonverbal
communication.  (AE  A  at  10)  Being  homeschooled,  without  the  benefits  of  typical
childhood  socialization and  group  dynamics, may have  exacerbated  his problems  with
social  interactions.  (AE  A  at  10)  She  concluded  that  his  disorder  “does  not  have  any
medical, psychological, psychiatric, emotional, or substance use conditions which would
impair his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.” (AE A at 15) She recommended that
he attend therapy to work on his conversational skills. (Tr. 120) Applicant followed her
advice,  and  has  been  attending  therapy  once  per  week  since  the  social  worker’s
evaluation. (Tr. 101, 104)
At the Government’s request, Applicant was examined by another psychologist on
December 11, 2021.  After reviewing the available records and analyzing psychological
test results the psychologist diagnosed Applicant with the following:
Social pragmatic communication disorder vs. autism spectrum disorder;
Bipolar II disorder . .  . [and];
Unspecified anxiety disorder. (GE  7 at 6)
Based   on   this  information,  the   psychologist  determined   that  Applicant’s  judgment,
reliability, and  trustworthiness  are  questionable,  that  he  posed  a  risk  to  national security
if   granted   a   security   clearance,  and   that  his  prognosis  was  guarded.   (GE  7   at  6)   In
reaching  this conclusion, she  relied, in part, on  controverted  allegations, not included  in
the  SOR,  from  unidentified  coworkers  on  a  job  where he  worked  more than  ten  years ago.
Moreover,  her  report  does  not   reflect   the   conclusion   of  the   base   police   investigation
because she never received it.
On December 31, 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a psychologist that he retained.
(AE L) Before the evaluation, she conducted a comprehensive, three-day assessment on
November  1,  November  2,  and  December  31,  2021.  The  psychologist  diagnosed
Applicant with bipolar disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder. She recommended that
he participate in weekly individual therapy for managing depressive episodes, and in role-
playing or practicing conversational skills. (AE L at 8)
According to Applicant’s company’s  human resource director, with whom he has
worked  since  2017,  he  is  “an  extremely  intelligent,  loyal,  and  appreciated  part  of  [the]
team  [who]  understands  business  rules  and  policy,  asks  questions  when  unsure  of
something, and never hesitates to contribute where he can or educate himself if it benefits
the  company  and/or  the  client.”  (AE  I)  Applicant  has  received  multiple  verbal
commendations and e-mail commendations from persons involved with projects that he
has worked with over the years since beginning his current job in 2017. (Tr. 82)
SOR  subparagraph  2.b  alleges  that  Applicant  falsified  Section  13A  of  his  2017
security  clearance  application  by  not  providing  the  reason  for  leaving  the  internship  in
2011. Applicant testified that he was never informed that he was fired for cause. (Tr. 85),
SOR  subparagraph  2.c  alleges  that  Applicant  falsified  the  circumstances
surrounding the  base police  investigation. Applicant told the investigator that two  base
police officers came to his place of employment two days after the intern party, and asked
to search his laptop. (GE 2 at 8) Also, they interviewed him and asked if he had an interest
in  any  terrorist  activity  or  other  improper  behavior.  Subject  answered,  “no,”  and  the
subsequent laptop search revealed nothing derogatory, whereupon, it was returned. (GE
2 at 9)

"Applicant  is almost 44  years old, divorced, and  has no  children. In  December 2001,
she   received   a   Bachelor  of   Science   in  computer  science,  with   a   computer  information
system’s  option.  In   May   2006,  she   received   a  Master  of   Science   in  management
information   systems.  Applicant   has  worked   for  her  current   employer,  a   Defense
contractor,  since   April  2016.  At  the   time   of   the   hearing,  Applicant   was  working   as  an
information  systems  security  officer.  Prior to  the  revocation  of  her  interim  secret  security
clearance  in November  2019,  she  supported  her company’s classified  computer systems.
This  is her first security clearance  application.  (GE  1;  GE  4; AE  C; AE  D; Tr.  at 12-14, 26-
28)
The SOR alleges that Applicant was evaluated in September 2018, by a licensed
clinical psychologist and was subsequently diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, most recent
episode  with  psychotic  features;  alcohol use disorder, severe;  and unspecified  anxiety
disorder. Additionally, the SOR alleged that the psychologist determined that an absence
of any clear medical indication that Applicant’s consumption of alcohol was in accordance
with  medical  recommendations,  it  could  adversely  affect  her  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness due to her psychological condition. The alcohol use disorder was cross-
alleged under Guideline G. The SOR also alleged that when Applicant was discharged in
April 2015 from an inpatient treatment program for her bipolar I disorder, she received a
medical recommendation that she abstain from alcohol, yet she continued to consume
alcohol. (SOR; GE 5)
Applicant admitted in her Answer to the SOR that her current diagnosis is bipolar
I disorder, for which she receives regular treatment. However, she denied the alcohol use
disorder, severe diagnosis,  and stated that in  2015  she stopped taking the  medication
that  was  contraindicated  with  alcohol  use.  Additionally,  she  indicated  that  she  has
voluntarily abstained from alcohol since November 2019. (SOR; Answer; AE A; AE B)
From  a  young  age, Applicant suffered  from  sporadic depression  issues, and  her
drinking,  in  part,   was  the   result  of   her  depression   and   undiagnosed   mental  health
conditions.  She   started   drinking   alcohol   in  high   school  at   the   age   of  15   or  16.  Her
depression   worsened   while  she   was  in  college,   and   consequently,   her  alcohol
consumption  increased after she  started college  in 1996. (GE 4  at 4;  GE 5;  Tr. at  29, 44-
45, 59-60; Tr. 2  at 20)
In 2000, while still in college, Applicant was “very depressed” and started “drinking
heavily.” She consumed alcohol three to four times a week to the point of intoxication. In
September  2000,  she  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  of
alcohol (DUI) after attending a party. Applicant pled guilty and paid the relevant fines. She
was not court ordered to receive treatment, nor did she voluntarily seek treatment for her
alcohol consumption at that time. (GE 4 at 3-4; GE 5; Tr. 37-39, 59-60; Tr. 2 at 20)
In July 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with a second DUI. Following
this arrest, she voluntary attended alcohol-related treatment from August to September
2001.  She  received  inpatient  treatment  for  approximately 10  days  and  then  outpatient
treatment for two to three months. According to Applicant, the treatment she received was
helpful, but she does not recall what her diagnosis was at that time. (Applicant attempted
to  obtain  a  copy  of  these  treatment  records,  but  they  had  been  destroyed.)  It  was
recommended  that  following  her  treatment,  she  discontinue  consuming  alcohol  and
continue attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (AA meetings were part of her
outpatient treatment.) She voluntarily attended AA meetings for approximately three years
after the July 2001 DUI. She found that the AA meetings fell in line with her personal faith,
and they were very helpful overall in her life. (GE 4 at 4; GE 5; Tr. at 38-42, 61-62; Tr. 2
at 21, 23)
Applicant was unaware of how significant her depression or mental health issues
were  until  approximately  2004,  when  she  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  disorder
(unspecified) by her then primary care physician. He also treated her older sister, who
had previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It was stressed to Applicant that she
take her medication regularly; however, after her initial diagnosis, she freely admits that
she was inconsistent with taking her medications for about a year. She later realized that
she needed her medication and was mostly compliant for approximately ten years, until
about 2014. (Tr. at 29, 40, 43-46, 61)
In approximately 2004, when Applicant resumed consuming alcohol, she disclosed
to her primary care physician that she was drinking again in moderation. He asked her to
watch her levels of alcohol consumption, but he never told her not to drink or gave her
instructions as to how much she should or should not drink. She testified that she resumed
consuming  alcohol,  because  she  believed  she  had  dealt  with  her  underlying  mental-
health issues and did not consider herself to be an alcoholic, alcohol dependent, nor have
an  alcohol-related  condition.  She  also  described  her  drinking  as  responsible,  due  to
having matured. Between 2004, when Applicant resumed consuming alcohol, and 2019,
when  she  discontinued  consuming  alcohol,  as  further  discussed  below,  she  had  no
alcohol-related incidents. (GE 4; Tr. at 42-43, 46-47, 62-66; Tr. 2 at 24)
In August 2011, Applicant sought treatment from her primary care physician, due
to a crying spell. (She received treatment from him from 2009 to 2015.) He referred her
to  a  local  hospital  where  she  received  three  days  of  inpatient  treatment  for  a  bipolar
episode.  She  could  provide  no  additional  details  regarding  the  circumstances  of  this
incident. (GE 4; Tr. at 64, 66-68)
In April 2015, Applicant noticed her medications were no longer working, as she
was hearing voices and having paranoid and suicidal ideations. She went to her parents’
home  for  support  and  later  contacted  her  primary  care  physician.  She  was  ultimately
referred  to  an  inpatient  facility  for  five  days  of  treatment.  At  that  time,  she  was
experiencing  a  manic  episode  and  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  I  disorder,  recurrent,
severe depression with psychotic features, and anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified.
Following this diagnosis and treatment, she felt like her medications were working, but
due to the effect the situation had on her, she voluntarily did not drink for approximately
eight months, as she wanted to allow her brain time to rest and heal. (GE 2; GE 4; GE 5;
Tr. at 30-31, 47-51)
Applicant did not recall if the inpatient facility recommended that she abstain from
alcohol and drugs. Nor did she read the medication instructions for the prescriptions that
she  received.  According  to  the  records  that  she  provided  in  her  response  to
interrogatories, at least one of the medications she was prescribed in April 2015, indicated
that a person taking the prescription should “[a]void alcoholic drinks.” (More than one of
the medications she was prescribed at that time, also indicated that it was recommended,
“Give your health care provider a list of all the medicines, herbs, non-prescription drugs,
or dietary supplements you use. Also tell them if you smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal
drugs. Some items may interact with your medicine.) As stated above, for approximately
eight months after her hospitalization, Applicant voluntarily abstained from alcohol. She
does not recall receiving any specific recommendations from her treating physicians to
abstain from alcohol. (GE 2; GE 4; GE 5; Tr. at 30-31, 47-51; Tr. 2 at 24)
After Applicant was discharged from the inpatient facility in April 2015, she started
receiving  treatment  from  Facility  X,  which  is  an  outpatient  facility  specializing  in
psychotherapy, substance use disorders, and other related therapies. She has received
consistent treatment from this facility up until at least the reconvened hearing.
I did not expect to have a manic episode. But it ended up being a blessing.
…[O]nce  I got to  [Facility  X], and  ultimately  ended  up  following  up  with  them,
they  just  really  know  what they’re  doing.   … [T]hey’re  experts in their  field
and   it’s been   a  great  thing. And  I  did  follow  up  with  my  psychiatrist every
three  months, I believe. And  of  course,  I can  always call  and  get in sooner
if I need  to. (Tr. at 31-32)
At Facility  X,  Applicant  primarily  saw  Dr. A, a  psychiatrist,  from April 2015  to  February
2017, when  her treating  psychiatrist became Dr. B. In  Applicant’s medical records, Dr. B
noted  that in October 2018, Applicant had  bipolar II  disorder, generalized  anxiety disorder,
and   ADHD.  She   found   Applicant’s  thought   process,  at  that  time,  to   be   logical  and
coherent.  (GE 3)
Applicant’s medical records from Facility X reflect that she became more compliant
with taking her medication the longer she received treatment from this specialized facility.
Additionally, her prognosis improved and the frequency of her appointments decreased.
Throughout the notes in the records, it is apparent that Applicant self-reported periods of
non-compliance with various prescribed medications. In her February 2018 appointment,
Applicant disclosed that she had discontinued taking Zoloft due to its side effects, and
she  and  Dr.  B  developed  a  new  treatment  plan.  At  various  points  in  her  treatment,
Applicant discussed discontinuing other medications with Dr. B based upon side effects
she was experiencing. Her most significant non-compliance with taking medications was
noted in February 2017, when she discontinued taking her medications for three weeks,
but she self-reported this to Dr. B. At the hearing, Applicant explained that she stopped
taking one of her prescriptions, because it would get stuck in her throat. Applicant was
required to undergo a procedure under general anesthesia, as the medication had burned
her throat. She did not like taking this medication, and at the hearing could only recall
discontinuing this specific medication. (GE 3; Tr. at 45-46; Tr. 2 at 20-21)
Following  her  2015  manic  episode  and  bipolar  I  disorder  diagnosis,  Applicant
slowly resumed consuming alcohol again in approximately 2016, while she was receiving
treatment at Facility X. She explained that she felt comfortable drinking because she was
in  a  good  place  with  her  psychotropic  medication.  Applicant  disclosed  that  she  was
consuming  alcohol  to  both  Dr.  A  and  Dr.  B.  Applicant’s  records  reflect  that  she  also
disclosed  to  Dr.  B,  her  prior  DUIs  and  her  earlier  history  of  drinking  related  to  her
depression. Dr. B did not diagnose Applicant with an alcohol-related disorder nor did she
note that Applicant should discontinue drinking due to her prescribed medication. (GE 3
at 25, 27; GE 5; AE A; AE N; AE O; Tr. at 52-53; Tr. 2 at 24-25)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  her  current  mental  health  condition  is
positive. She been receiving treatment every three months by her treating psychiatrist,
Dr. B.  Since  receiving  treatment at  Facility  X,  where she  received  specialized  treatment
for the  first time  since  she  was diagnosed  with  a  psychological condition, she  has received
better medications, has realized how much she  needs them, and how important they are
to  her wellbeing. Her medications  are  currently  working  for her. She  saw  her psychiatrist
the  week before the  first hearing. She  takes her medications as prescribed  and  has  no
intention of discontinuing  them..  (Answer; GE  3; GE 5; AE  A; AE  O; Tr. at 32, 45-46, 56-
57)
On  September  26,  2018,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  board  certified
neuropsychologist hired by the DOD CAF to perform an evaluation. Applicant met with
the psychologist once for approximately two to three hours. The psychologist noted that
Applicant  was  punctual,  friendly,  open,  exhibited  poor  recall,  showed  no  signs  of
psychosis,  and  she  had  normal  affect.  The  psychologist  administered  the  Personality
Assessment Inventory (PAI) test. Applicant’s results indicated that her clinical profile was
entirely within normal limits, and there were no indications of significant psychopathology.
“Her profile  indicates that she  is generally a  confident,  resilient,  and  optimistic person.”
(Tr. at 68; GE 5)
The psychologist reviewed records provided to her by the DOD CAF, but her report
did not provide a detailed list of the documents she reviewed. Based upon statements in
her report, she reviewed records that were not offered into evidence at the hearing by the
Government,  as  various  statements  and  references  are  not  corroborated  by  the
Government’s exhibits that are in the record. Applicant signed multiple releases for her
treatment records at Facility X. However, the psychologist completed her evaluation on
October  23,  2018,  less  than  a  month  after  interviewing  Applicant.  The  Government
received a copy of Applicant’s  records from Facility X on January 21, 2019, but did not
apparently  submit  them  to  the  psychologist  for  an  updated  report.  Additionally,  in  her
September 2019 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a copy of the April
2015 treatment records from the inpatient treatment facility mentioned above. Based upon
her report,  it  is unclear if the DOD CAF  psychologist  reviewed  a  summary of  the  April
2015 records from the Report of Investigation (ROI) or the actual records. (GE 3; GE 5)
Based upon the documents available  to her,  her interview of  Applicant, and the
results of the PAI test, the DOD CAF psychologist determined that as of October 2018
Applicant’s:
Bipolar Disorder is quite  severe and  likely  to  require  medical management
for the  foreseeable future. She  maintains that she  has been  consistently  on
her mood  stabilizing  medications  for three  years though  this could not be
verified   by   her  current  prescribers….  Assuming   [Applicant’s]  report  is
accurate  that she  is fully  adherent  to  her medication  regiment,  that is clearly
favorable to  her and  additionally, she  seems to  have  a  supportive  family  that
helps her when  she  has a  symptom  breakthrough  of  her disorder, which is
quite  favorable.  However, through  the  clinical interview, it is apparent that it
is not uncommon  for her to  have  some  breakthrough  symptoms of mania
on  occasion,  despite  her claims  of medication  compliance.  Again,  given  the
lack  of  any  substantiating  records,  it  is  unclear  whether  [Applicant]  is
disclosing  these  breakthrough  symptoms  to  her  treating  psychiatrists  or
whether they have considered titrating her medications accordingly. (GE 5)
The DOD CAF psychologist noted that regarding Applicant’s alcohol consumption:
Of   greatest   concern  is   applicant’s  clear  history   of   Alcohol  Use  Disorder,
particularly   given   her  concomitant  Bipolar  I  Disorder.  My   aforementioned
inability   to   obtain   any   contemporaneous   records  from   her  treating
psychiatrists  or  discuss  [Applicant’s]  case   with   them   has  not  allayed
concerns  about  her  alcohol consumption  or determine  if her  treating  doctors
are even  aware she  consumes alcohol while  on  her specified  medication
regimen.  While  the  amount of alcohol [Applicant]  claims to  consume  may
be relatively moderate  for individuals without a concomitant serious mental
illness, I am  concerned  that any  amount of  alcohol consumption  in light of
her co-occurring  Bipolar Disorder may  be  contraindicated, given  the  severe
nature  of her symptoms as discussed  above. As such, these  factors indicate
a guarded prognosis. (GE 5)
The psychologist’s 2018 report opined that at some point, Applicant’s drinking may have
become somewhat problematic again for a period, following a traumatic incident when
she  was  30.  However,  after  speaking  to  her  mother,  she  reduced  her  consumption.
Ultimately, the psychologist determined that, “Applicant’s psychological condition and her
alcohol  consumption  may  have  an  untoward  effect  on  her  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness. (GE 5; Tr. 2 at 21)
Applicant  discontinued  drinking  alcohol  after  she  received  the  SOR  in  early
December 2019. She attended 47 AA meetings from December 2019 until March 2020,
when in-person meetings were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From March
2020 until the time of the hearing,  she has been  reading AA  literature and the AA Big
Book  three  to  four  times  a  week,  and  she  has  been  attending  church.  She  intends  to
continue to abstain from alcohol. Since she started working for her current employer in
2016 until 2019, when she discontinued drinking, she drank two or three times a week,
but would typically consume less than one beer. When she was interviewed May 2017,
by  a  Government  investigator,  Applicant  indicated  that  she  did  not  believe  she  had  a
problem with alcohol. At the hearing, she reiterated that she does not consider herself to
be an alcoholic but recognizes that “alcohol has caused enough problems in [her] life  –
with two DUIS, and now with the SOR – it’s best to just leave it alone at this point.” (GE
4; AE B; Tr. at 33-36, 57-59, 72)
The DOD CAF psychologist also indicated that Applicant had trouble remembering
things  during  the  interview;  therefore,  she  concluded  that  Applicant  was  not  as  well
stabilized as she claimed. At the reconvened hearing in May 2021, Applicant explained
that she was nervous and anxious about the evaluation due to its importance. In , addition,
she  suffers  from  Attention-deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD),  which  could  have
affected  her  recall  ability  during  her  interview  with  DOD  CAF  psychologist.  Applicant
underscored that she was not having a manic episode at the time of her interview, which
the DOD CAF psychologist suggested in her report. (GE 5; Tr. 2 at 18-20)
At the  reconvened  hearing, Applicant testified  that she  had  issues with  the  CAF’s
2018  psychology  report. When  she  met with  the  psychologist, the  psychologist, told her
that she  did not have  any  of  Applicant’s medical records.  Prior to  meeting  with  the  CAF
psychologist, Applicant  had  signed  release  forms for all  of  her medical records.  She  asked
the   CAF  psychologist  if   they   could  call   Facility   X   together  to   try   to   get  copies  of   her
records.  They  spent 45  minutes  on  the  phone  together trying  to  get the  records faxed  to
the  CAF psychologist. A  week later, Applicant  followed  up  with  the  CAF psychologist, who
told her that  she  had  not received  the  records  yet.  Applicant  contacted  Facility  X  again to
try to get the records to  the CAF psychologist. (Tr. 2 at 15-16)
Applicant’s treating   psychiatrist,  Dr. B, wrote   medical status letters in November
2019, December 2020, and April 2021  for her. Dr. B’s November 2019 letter, stating  that
Applicant  has  been   compliant  with   her  appointments  and   medication   regimen   and   her
“mental  illness   has   been   stable.  She   showed   good   insight  and   judgement  toward  her
condition   and   necessary   steps  to   maintain  remission   of   her  illness.”  In   her  December
2020  letter, Dr.  B  reiterated  that  Applicant’s  “mental health  condition  has been  stable  and
in  remission   in  the   past  year  and   a   half   with   no   medication   adjustments   needed.
[Applicant] has been  sober from alcohol for over a  year now  and  denied  having  cravings
for alcohol. She has continued  using AA philosophy to maintain sobriety. [She] has been
compliant  with   her  medications  and   appointments  and   has  been   seen   by   psychiatrist
every three  months for the  past year.” (Answer; AE  A; AE N; Tr. at 32; Tr. 2 at 24-25)
At  the  reconvened  hearing,  Applicant  provided  an  updated  letter  from  Dr.  B,  to
respond  to  the  issues  raised  in  the  2018  DOD  CAF  report.  In  it,  Dr.  B’s  reported
Applicant’s current diagnoses, which considered the findings of the DOD psychological
evalution from 2018:
[Applicant] has been seen by several [Facility X] psychiatrists since 2015.
She  has  been  followed  by  this  provider  since  February  2017  for  Other
Schizoaffective  Disorder  (F25.8),  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  (F41.1),
Attention-deficit  Hyperactivity Disorder, combined type  (F90.2), History of
Alcohol abuse, currently in remission.
[Applicant]  has  been  having  her  symptoms  well  controlled  after  last
medication adjustments on 6/20/2019. [Applicant] has been showing good
insight in her condition and has been compliant with her medications and
appointments.  [Applicant]  has  been  showing  determination  and  ability  to
stay  sober  and  maintain  her  best  ability  to  function.  She  has  not  been  a
threat  to  herself  or  others.  PDMP  has  been  monitored  and  no  concerns
about filling habits were found.
Of   note,   Dr.  B,   indicated   that  Applicant’s  history   of  alcohol  abuse   disorder  was  in
remission. Additionally, she  changed  Applicant’s diagnosis from  bipolar I disorder to  Other
Schizoaffective Disorder. (AE O;  Tr. 2  at 24-25)
At  the  first  hearing  in  April  2021,  seven  work-related  witnesses  testified  for
Applicant. They are aware of the allegations in the SOR, and they all possess either secret
or  top  secret  security  clearances.  None  of  them  have  concerns  regarding  Applicant
having access to classified material. (Tr. at 71-72)
Witness  1  (W1)  has  known  Applicant  since  April  2016,  and  is  her  current
supervisor.  They  have  socialized  outside  of  work,  and  she  has  never  observed  her
consume  alcohol.  According  to  WI,  Applicant  does  great  work,  she’s  very  thorough,
people love working with her, and she is a great employee. W1 is aware of the issues
raised  in  the  SOR  and  has  never  witnessed  “at  any  point…anything  that  made  [her]
hesitant in any way either as an employee or as a friend.” (Answer; Tr. 77-84)
Witness 2 (W2) has known Applicant since April 2016. They are part of the same
security team and work closely together. He considers her to be very conscientious. She
has a great reputation and is known for thoroughness. He has held a top secret security
clearance for three years and held a secret security clearance for approximately fifteen
prior  years.  W2  has  never  observed  Applicant  exhibit  any  behavior  that  caused  him
concern. They have only interacted outside of work a couple of times, and he has never
observed her consume alcohol. (Tr. 84-90)
Witness 3 (W3) has held a top secret security clearance for approximately fifteen
years.  He  has  known  Applicant  since  April  2016,  and  interacts  with  her  daily.  She  is
always timely, reliable, dependable, a very fast learner, and “an absolute energetic team
player.” W3 has never observed Applicant exhibit behavior that caused him concern. (Tr.
91-96)
Witness 4 (W4) has held a security clearance since 1999, and currently holds a
top secret security clearance. He is a retired combat Marine. Applicant works for him on
his security team, and he as her senior rater; they interact daily. He wishes that he “had
ten  of  her.  She  does  amazing  work,  outstanding  work,  and  she’s  relied  upon  heavily
because  she  gets  the  job  done,  right,  on  time,  every  time.”  He  has  never  observed
Applicant exhibit behavior that caused him concern, or  seen any indications of alcohol
abuse. (Tr. 96-101)
Witness  5  (W5)  has held a  security  clearance  since  2007,  and  currently  holds  a
top  secret  security  clearance.  She  has known  Applicant since  2018, has been  her direct
supervisor since  2020, and  interacts  with  her daily. Applicant is one  of the  her most  valued
team  members and   “goes  way   above   and  beyond.”  W5   has  never observed   Applicant
exhibit behavior that caused  her concern, or any  indications of  alcohol abuse.  (Tr. 102-
106)
Witness 6  (W6)  is a  retired  U.S. Army  officer. He has held a  security  clearance  his
entire professional career. He has known  Applicant since  approximately  2017, and  works
with  her daily. He considers Applicant to  be  an  excellent worker and  has received  nothing
but  compliments  regarding   her  work  performance.  W6   has  never  observed   Applicant
exhibit behavior that  caused  him  concern, or any  indications  of  alcohol abuse.  (Tr. at 106-
112)
Witness  7  (W7)  has  known  Applicant  since  2019.  They  have  been  co-workers
since 2020, and interact daily. He stated, “She  is an  impeccable addition to this team.
She  saves  our  backsides  more  often  than  we  save  hers.”  W7  has  never  observed
Applicant exhibit behavior that caused him concern, or any indications of alcohol abuse.
(Tr. at 112-116)
Witness  8  (W8)  has  been  Applicant’s  boyfriend  since  2015.  He  is  aware  of  the
SOR allegations. He has no concerns regarding her mental health and considers her to
be well-adjusted. She regularly visits her physician and takes her medication. She has
never  expressed  a  desire  to  discontinue  taking  her  medication  with  him.  Prior  to  the
issuance of the SOR, W8 knew Applicant consumed alcohol, but never observed it being
a problem or saw her drinking to excess. Since December 2019, he has not observed her
consume alcohol. (Tr. at 116-124)
The  DOD  CAF  psychologist  also  opined  that  although  it  is  “not  uncommon  for
patients to have difficulty recalling specific events surrounding manic/psychotic episodes,
[Applicant’s] confusion for recall of  other major life  events was particularly concerning.”
Department Counsel, who was the only person at the original hearing who had read GE
5, did not question Applicant’s witnesses to determine if any of them had ever observed
Applicant acting confused or scattered either at work or outside or work. However, none
of Applicant’s witnesses testified that she was prone to confusion or scattered thinking.
(GE 5)
Applicant’s performance evaluations and numerous awards demonstrate that she
is  a  highly  valued  employee  of  her  company  who  “greatly  exceeds  expectations.”  As
noted in one of her awards, she:
“[r]egularly  achieves  highly  impressive  results  that  surpass  agreed
outcome-based  goals”;  “[d]emonstrates  initiative  and  willingness  to  go
beyond own job requirements”; [and has] “[s]trong interpersonal skills and
organizational  knowledge  which  contributes  success  to  the  team  and
[company].”
Applicant’s current credit score is 825. (Answer; AE E-L; AE N; AE M)

"Applicant  is  33  years  old.  She  is not  married  and  has  no  children.  She  has a
Bachelor’s  degree.  Applicant holds a full time position  with  a  defense  contractor as  a
Software Engineer.  She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with this
employment.  The  SOR  alleges  security  concerns  under  three  of  the  following  four
guidelines:
Guideline  I –  Psychological Condition:   The Government alleges that Applicant has
an emotional, mental, and personality condition that can impair judgment, reliability, or
trustworthiness.  Applicant denies the allegation set forth under this allegation.
Guideline   G  –   Alcohol  Consumption:  The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant
engages in excessive alcohol consumption that can lead to the exercise of questionable
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about her reliability
and  trustworthiness.  The  SOR  refers  to  allegation  1.b.,  which  does  not  exist.
Accordingly, there is no finding for or against the Applicant under this guideline.
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:   The  Government alleges  that
Applicant has used controlled substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are
used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their  intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions
about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.  Applicant admits with explanation the
allegations  set  forth  in  3.a.,  and  3.b.  The  SOR  refers  to  allegation  3.c.,  which  does  not
exist.  Accordingly, there is no finding for or against the Applicant for 3.c.
Guideline   E   –   Personal   Conduct:   The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has
engaged  in  conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or
unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  that  can  raise  questions  about  her
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  The
Applicant admits with explanation the allegations set forth under this guideline.
Applicant  began  working  for  her  current  employer  in  March  2015.  Applicant
completed a security clearance application dated September 21, 2016.  In response to
questions  in  Section  23,  Applicant  was  asked.  “In  the  last  seven  years,  have  you
illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances?”  The  Applicant  answered,  “NO.”
Applicant deliberately failed to disclose that she used marijuana with varying frequency
from  about  high  school  to  at  least  2015.  She  also  failed  to  list  her  use  of  ecstasy  in
2018, while granted a security clearance.  Furthermore, Applicant did not report to her
facility  security  officer  that  she  used  ecstasy  in  2018  as  required  by  DoD  policy  and
procedure.  During  her  interview  with  an  investigator  from  OPM  on  August  21,  2018,
Applicant  was  asked  why  she  did  not  tell  the  truth  about  her  illegal  drug  use  on  her
security clearance application. Applicant stated that she was afraid of losing her security
clearance.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
In regard to the use of illegal drugs, Applicant initially stated that she has never
used  any  illegal  drugs.
(Government  Exhibit  4.)  She  later  admitted  that  she  used
marijuana in high school; about once a week for the last few months of her senior year.
Then,  in  college  her  use  of  marijuana  continued  until  she  quit,  during  the  second
semester.  Applicant did not use marijuana again until 2015, when she visited Colorado
on  two  separate  occasions.  While  in  Colorado,  Applicant  smoked  marijuana  and  ate
marijuana  gummy  bears  one  or  two  times  on  each  trip.  Applicant  decided  to  use
marijuana  since  it  was  legal  in  Colorado,  and  because  she  was  on  vacation.  The
marijuana made her feel loopy, lazy, and dumb.  Applicant stated that the effects of the
gummy  bears  lasted  longer  than  when  she  would  smoke  marijuana.  Applicant  states
that she no longer uses marijuana.  (Answer to SOR.)  Applicant also admitted that in
2018,  she  used  ecstasy  at  a  music festival  in  Ireland  with  a  friend.  She  stated  that a
stranger offered it to her and she tried it.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
Applicant also stated that since April 2017, she has been seeing a mental health
counselor for general anxiety and depression.  Her therapy has continued on a weekly
basis since then.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
In  September  2019,  Applicant  was  referred  for  a  psychological  evaluation  in
relation  to  her  security  clearance  application.
(Government  Exhibit  5.)  During  the
evaluation,  Applicant  discussed  her  difficulty  managing  her  alcohol  consumption,  and
how  she  has  used  alcohol  to  cope  with  stressors  and  stressful  situations.  Applicant
stated that her work with her therapist “focuses on curtailing her drinking.”  In describing
her drinking pattern, Applicant stated that she currently does not drink during the work
week, but drinks wine on Friday and Saturdays.  She has never had a period of drinking
daily, but has “binged” in social situations.  She does not know if she has been formally
diagnosed with  depression  and anxiety,  but she  reported that  she is sad and anxious.
The last time she drank more than she wanted to was October 28, 2019.  She reported
that she had three beers.  Prior to that she drank too much around Valentines day while
on a ski trip.  She consumed about three seltzers and whiskey (about 5-6 drinks).  She
does  not  remember  everything  from  that  night,  but  knows  that  she  had  too  much  to
drink.  She  states  that  she  currently  drinks  heavily  every  couple  of  months  while  at
home.  During those times, she has said things to her roommate that she does not want
to say, and has done things she does not want to do.  For about a two-month period in
2017, she stopped drinking alcohol, and found  that she experienced increased energy
and motivation.  She then returned to her regular drinking pattern.  Applicant has never
attended  Alcoholics Anonymous  or any rehabilitation program for her alcohol problem.
(Government Exhibit 5.)
Applicant explained that in social situations, she becomes very anxious.  At least
once a month she has to leave work early because of her emotions.  Applicant admitted
that  her  alcohol  consumption  has  helped  her  connect  with  people,  but  also
acknowledged  that  it  has  made  things  worse  for  her  most  of  the  time.  (Government
Exhibit 5.)  Applicant believes that she has control over her alcohol consumption since
she tries to follow moderation management.  (Answer to SOR.)
During  the  evaluation,  Applicant  discussed  her  struggle  with  Attention  Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, reflected by an ongoing pattern of impulsivity and poor decision
making.  For  about  a  year,  Applicant  has  been  taking  a  medication  prescribed  by  her
primary  care  physician  for  her  attention  deficit  related  difficulties.  Applicant  explained
that she was having difficulty accomplishing anything at work, and felt like she was not
quite hearing what people were talking to her about.  She feels that she does not listen
well and felt overwhelmed.  She feels that overall, the medication has helped her, but it
can make her feel sick and anxious in the mornings.  (Government Exhibit 5.)
The psychologist  stated that Applicant’s above-described conditions  have led to
episodes  of  poor  judgment  and  failure  to  consider  her  behavior  and  decisions  in  the
face of her obligations related to her security clearance.  Her poor decisions  can place
her in unsafe situations that could make her a target for blackmail or at risk of coercion,
particularly when she is drinking heavily.  She is unable to stop drinking altogether and
says things she wishes she did not say to her roommate when she is home drinking on
the  weekends.  Her alcohol use  places  her  judgment  and  reliability  at  risk  as  she  has
placed  herself  in  dangerous  situations  when  drunk  or  impaired  by  alcohol,  and  later
reports that she cannot report the details.  (Government Exhibit 5.)
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder,  Major  Depressive
Disorder  and  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,  Moderate.  The  psychologist  concluded  that
Applicant’s overall prognosis is poor.  She continues to struggle to eliminate episodes of
heavy drinking, continues to experience impairing levels of depression and anxiety, and
appears insufficiently motivated to put the requirements of her security clearance before
her own desires, even when recognizing the possible security concerns of her actions.
It is also noted that given her ongoing pattern of alcohol use, her ongoing symptoms of
depression  and  anxiety,  as  well  as  her  impulsive  decision  making,  her  judgment,
reliability  and  trustworthiness  appear  impaired  which  impacts  her  capacity  to  properly
safeguard classified information.  (Government Exhibit 5.)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted most of the information in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.e. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted
as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a 38-year-old deputy program manager for a Defense contractor. (Tr.
18, 38; GE 1) In 2002, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 19) In 2006, he received a
bachelor’s degree in business. (Tr. 19; AE G) He has a master’s degree in aeronautical
science and a project management professional certification. (Tr. 45; AE E; AE F) He
has been married for eight years, and his children are ages seven and four years old.
(Tr. 18, 85; GE 1) His father is a retired Air Force officer, and both of his grandfathers
served in the military. (Tr. 19, 102) His resume provides details of his professional training
and experience. (AE Q) He has held a security clearance continuously since he was age
18. (Tr. 8)
Applicant  was  commissioned  through  ROTC  in  the  Air  Force  as  a  second
lieutenant. (Tr. 19-22) He successfully completed pilot training and was assigned to fly
KC-10s, which are large air-to-air refuelers about the size of a 747. (Tr. 21, 23-24) He
successfully  completed  survival  training.  (Tr.  23)  He  completed  three  combat-zone
deployments as a copilot and one combat-zone deployment as an aircraft commander.
He  has  more  than  1,000  combat-flight  hours.  (Tr.  24-25)  Some  of  the  flights  were
dangerous because of flying in bad weather with old aircraft. (Tr. 25-26) Once during a
flight, his aircraft caught on fire and was filled with smoke. (Tr. 27) He had a three-year
follow-on assignment as an instructor pilot, and being continuously alert was paramount
because  there  was  some  risk  involved  as  trainee  pilots  sometimes  make  dangerous
mistakes. (Tr. 28)
Psychological Conditions
SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.c  allege  Applicant  received  inpatient  care  in  a  military
mental-health facility in August 2014, August 2015, and October 2015, following bipolar
episodes.
In 2014, Applicant volunteered to be a pilot for a highly specialized aircraft that
costs the government more than $300 million. (Tr. 29) He had trouble sleeping; his Air
Force duties were stressful; and there was a new baby in his home. (Tr. 31, 47, 88) He
went to a flight surgeon on a Friday, and he received a prescription for Restoril. (Tr. 31-
32, 47) He took the medication over the weekend. (Tr. 47) On Monday, he went back to
the doctor, and the doctor noticed Applicant’s speech was odd. (Tr. 48) He was referred
to a psychiatrist in the same clinic, who observed his comments were nonsensical. (Tr.
48)  He  received  a  referral  to  a  military  mental-health  facility.  (Tr.  32,  48)  However,
Applicant thought he was going to the hospital for a sleep study. (Tr. 89, 94) In August
2014, he was an inpatient at a military mental-health facility for seven days, and he was
diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. (Tr. 32) He received two weeks of outpatient follow-up
appointments. (Tr. 89) Applicant believed he had stress-related trouble sleeping, and he
disagreed with the Bipolar disorder diagnosis. (Tr. 32, 49, 55) He was extremely worried
that his lifetime dream of continuing his career as an Air Force pilot of high performance
aircraft was in jeopardy due to the Bipolar diagnosis. (Tr. 49)
On  September  5,  2014,  a  psychiatrist,  Major  B,  prescribed  1,000  milligrams  of
Depakote a day, which is a mood stabilizer.  (GE 3) On September 15,  2014, Major B
increased  the  dosage  to  1,500  milligrams  a  day.  (Tr.  53;  GE  3)  Applicant  took  the
prescribed medications. (Tr. 53) In October 2014, Major B said Applicant’s diagnosis of
Bipolar I disorder, and use of psychoactive medication made him unfit for continued Air
Force  duty.  (Tr.  56)  Applicant  was  concerned  about  the  diagnosis,  and  in  November
2014, he started seeing a flight doctor, Colonel S, who was Major B’s supervisor. (Tr. 53)
Colonel S was Applicant’s friend, and he was also a pilot, and a psychiatrist. (Tr. 33, 90)
Colonel S suggested the Bipolar diagnosis might be incorrect. (Tr. 55) Colonel S gave
Applicant false hope that he might not have Bipolar disorder. (Tr. 89) Colonel S continued
the Depakote; however, he reduced the dosage. (Tr. 58) Colonel S wanted to carefully
observe Applicant’s reaction to the reduced dosage. (Tr. 59) In January 2015, Applicant
stopped  taking  the  medication  completely.  (Tr.  60)  Applicant  continued  to  believe  the
August 2014 episode was an isolated event, and he could continue his Air Force career.
(Tr. 90)
At  Applicant’s  June  2015  medical  board,  Colonel  S  conceded  he  was  unsure
about  Applicant’s  diagnosis.  (Tr.  58)  Applicant’s  mother  is  a  nurse.  (Tr.  68)  He  was
unaware  that  his  mother  had  Bipolar  disorder.  (Tr.  32-33,  104-105)  She  has  been
asymptomatic for years. (Tr. 104) Around August to October 2015, Applicant learned of
his mother’s Bipolar disorder. (Tr. 63, 96) His parents did not reveal her Bipolar diagnosis
because  his  symptoms  were  not  similar  to  her  symptoms.  (Tr.  110)  He  did  not
immediately disclose his mother’s Bipolar diagnosis to his treating psychiatrist because
he  was  unsure  whether  it  was  relevant  to  his  own  diagnosis,  which  he  continued  to
believe  was  not  Bipolar  disease.  (Tr.  63)  In  August  2015,  Applicant  had  been  off
medication for 10 months, or he may have recently restarted taking medications. (Tr. 62,
64, 95-96) He was having trouble sleeping, and he had manic-like symptoms that he was
a genius, and he was having an epiphany. (Tr. 34, 64) His father took him to see Colonel
S. (Tr. 63, 91, 109) Colonel S decided, and Applicant and his father agreed, that he had
Bipolar disorder. (Tr. 34) In August 2015, he was an inpatient at a military mental-health
facility for seven days. (Tr. 34)
In October 2015, Applicant was upset about the loss of his Air Force career, and
during an Air Force weigh in, he slammed and kicked a door and started yelling that he
needed an ambulance and wanted to “check in.” (Tr. 35-36) The military police came into
the area, tackled Applicant, and used a Taser on him. (Tr. 36) Mental-health personnel
concluded he was under medicated in October 2015. (Tr. 36) In October 2015, he spent
a  week  as  an  inpatient  in  a  military  mental-health  facility,  and  then  he  was  medically
retired at a 50 percent level from the Air Force as a captain. (Tr. 37, 80) He is eligible for
military medical care as a retiree. (Tr. 80) The October 2015 episode removed all doubt
from Applicant, his spouse, and his parents about the accuracy of his Bipolar disorder
diagnosis. (Tr. 34, 62, 91, 107, 109) He continued seeing Dr. S until he left the Air Force.
(Tr. 67)  He  said  he  was  completely compliant  with  medical  directions  after  December
2015. (Tr. 64)
When  Applicant  learned  he  was  being  medically  retired  from  the  Air  Force,  he
called the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for a mental-health appointment. (Tr. 67)
He received a 90 percent disability rating from the VA with 70 percent for Bipolar disorder
and 20 percent for other disabilities. (Tr. 37; AE A) The Federal Aviation Administration
revoked his private pilot’s license. (Tr. 80-81)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant has received treatment for Bipolar disorder from the
VA  since  August  2014.  However,  his  VA  treatment  began  in  December  2015,  and
Applicant has subsequently received mental-health care from the VA. (Tr. 39) He sees a
psychiatrist every 90 days and a counselor or psychologist every 30 days. (Tr. 39, 72)
He is also able to seek assistance on an as needed basis. (Tr. 98) Applicant’s spouse is
a nurse, and she is watchful for any symptoms of Bipolar disorder or the beginnings of
any  manic  episodes.  (Tr.  34,  39,  85)  He  has  not  received  inpatient  treatment  since
October 2015. (Tr. 40) He takes his medication every night at 9:00 pm. (Tr. 40)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a licensed psychologist (H) evaluated Applicant in December
2020. Psychologist H diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar I disorder, full remission. SOR ¶
1.e continues:
With  continued  adherence  with  prescribed  medication,  your  prognosis  is
good.  However, your ongoing pattern to attempt  to  conceal the truth and
minimize  your  condition  arouses  concern  about  either  your  judgment  (if
minimizing)  or  trustworthiness  (if  attempting  to  conceal  the  truth).  The
discrepant  information  you  continue  to  provide,  and  in  the  absence  of
medical  oversight,  what  may  otherwise  be  minor  concerns  about  your
judgment and trustworthiness are more significant.
Applicant  disagreed  with  Dr.  H’s  comment  that  he  has  an  “ongoing  pattern  to
attempt to conceal the truth and minimize your condition.” (Tr. 42) Dr. H said Applicant
omitted or minimized the following details: “His mother’s history of Bipolar Disorder, the
extent of his sleep deficits, and his history of amphetamine use were relevant details he
did not share openly with his physician. It is clear [Applicant] was motivated to conceal
these facts when he contested his diagnosis.” (GE 2 at 11) According to Dr. H’s report,
the  use  of  amphetamines  was  not  disclosed  in  his  background  information  or
acknowledged  on  the  objective  Psychological  Screening  Inventory  (PSI).  (GE  2  at  5)
However,  Dr.  H’s  report  states,  “unstructured  interview  revealed  tandem  use  of
stimulants  and  Ambient  to  manage  extremely  long  flight  duty  when  he  was  in  the  Air
Force. While he initially drank Red Bull, he was later given Dexedrine or other forms of
amphetamine for long missions and Ambien to rest between flights.” Id. Applicant may
not  have  recognized  that  the  PSI  was  seeking  any  amphetamine  use  and  not
amphetamine use not prescribed by medical personnel.
Dr.  H believed  Applicant  answered  some  questions  in  the  PSI  with  excessively
positive  responses.  GE  2  at  5  At  his  hearing,  he  described  himself  as  an  optimistic
person, and he believed while his condition is serious and challenging, with the excellent
care he is receiving from the VA, his outlook is good. (Tr. 42) He denied that he minimized
his  mental-health  issues.  (Tr.  43)  He  noted  that  he  fully  disclosed  his  mental-health
diagnosis on his SCA, and he included the hospitals where he received treatment. He
said Dr. H did not review any medical records after 2016. (Tr. 43) She did not review his
VA medical records. (Tr. 43)
Dr. H concluded her evaluation:
With  continued  adherence  with  prescribed  medication,  his  prognosis  is
considered good. Without medication, he would be at risk for another manic
episode. Consultation with his current medical providers at the VA would be
helpful  to  verify  his  compliance.  With  the  discrepant  information  he
continues  to  provide  and  in  the  absence  of  medical  oversight,  what  may
otherwise be minor concerns about his judgment and trustworthiness are
more significant. (GE 2 at 11)
Applicant’s VA records indicate that he continues to received regular therapy. (Tr.
44)  He  is  treatment  compliant  and  invested  in  management  and  resolution  of  his
symptoms. (Tr. 45) He is currently taking 375 milligrams of Seroquel and 400 milligrams
of Lamictal daily, which are mood stabilizers. (Tr. 69-70) He has been taking them for
about two years, and they are effective in the maintenance of his stability. (Tr. 71) If he
feels excessive stress or anxiety, he seeks help. (Tr. 71) For example, in 2018, he had a
difficult  boss and  was  upset,  and  he  sought help from  the  VA.  (Tr. 73)  He  received  a
prescription for anxiety,  which  he  took for a  short period  of  time.  He  has  not  had  any
episodes of mania, depression, or hospitalizations since October 2015. (Tr. 71-72, 75)
He believed his Bipolar disorder was readily controllable with treatment, and he is diligent
with his compliance with the VA’s treatment recommendations. (Tr. 76, 92)
On April 15, 2022, a VA licensed clinical social worker (LCSW  F) wrote that he
provided counseling to Applicant. (AE R) LCSW F said “Veteran has been under my care
since  January 2021  and  continues  to  seek  regular  individual  therapy.  Next  scheduled
appointment is on 5/19/22. Veteran is treatment compliant and invested in management
and resolution of symptoms. Veteran does not have any work restrictions or limitations
related to mental health diagnosis.” (AE R)
On  May  3,  2022,  LCSW  F  said  Applicant  “voluntarily  entered  a  counseling  or
treatment program”; his “identified  condition  [is] readily  controllable with  treatment”; he
“demonstrated  ongoing  and  consistent  compliance  with  the  treatment  plan”;  his
“condition  [is]  amenable  to  treatment”;  and  he  “is  currently  receiving  counseling  or
treatment with a favorable prognosis.” (AE S)
Applicant  receives  support  from  his  church  and  family.  (Tr.  45-46)  His  spouse
carefully observes his behavior, is familiar with the symptoms of a manic episode, and
will ensure that if symptoms start to appear, she will contact the VA to seek help. (Tr. 93,
97-989) He helps coach soccer and is a leader in another organization helping the youth
in the community. (Tr. 92, 115)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s father, mother, and  spouse  are familiar with his medical history and
his reluctant but eventual acceptance of his Bipolar disorder. He is stable and compliant
with his medical recommendations. (Tr. 110) They indicated he is responsible, reliable,
and  trustworthy.  Their  statements  along  with  two  additional  witnesses  supported
reinstatement of his security clearance.

"In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations.
The admissions are adopted as findings of fact.  After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  29  years  old.  He  is  married  and  has  four  young  children,  all  under
age  seven.  He  worked  for a  federal  contractor  as  an  information  technology specialist
starting  in  April  2019,  but  recently  left  their  employment  to  pursue  other  job
opportunities. As stated above, he is subject to rehire by this contractor if his clearance
is  granted.  He  served  in  the  Army  for  eight  years  before  receiving  an  honorable
discharge at the end of his enlistment. He holds a bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 5, 17-19; GE

The SOR alleged Applicant: (1) voluntarily sought inpatient treatment in October
2018 and received a working diagnosis of major depressive disorder, severe, and was
considered a high safety risk because he presented with suicide ideations; (2) was seen
in a triage clinic after his inpatient hospitalization in October 2018 and reported having
hallucinations  by  seeing  apparitions;  (3)  was  evaluated  in  July  2021  by  a  clinical
psychologist  who  diagnosed  him  with  persistent  depressive  disorder,  with  mood
congruent  psychotic  features  and  schizoaffective  disorder,  depressive  type;  he  further
gave  a  guarded  prognosis  to  Applicant.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  - 1.f)  (Note:  as  indicated  above,
SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.c are decided in favor of Applicant and will not be further addressed).
Applicant  reported   a   history   of   psychological  issues   that   started   when   he   was
approximately   8   to   10   years  old.   He  testified   that  at   that  age,  he   first  saw   apparitions
that   he   described   as   “spiritual  beings”  that  were  sometimes   solid   and   sometimes
floating.  He   also   saw   a   self-described   demon   with   horns   who   spoke   to   him.  He   stated
that both  his mother and  grandmother experienced  seeing  such  apparitions. He claims
that  last   time   he   saw   a   spiritual  being   was  in  2018,   when   his  wife   was  in  the   hospital
having   their   second   child.  While   in  the   hospital,  he   claims  that  he   saw   a   girl  walk
through  a  closed  elevator. He also admitted  that he  had  suicidal ideations starting  when
he  was 10  or 11  years old.  These  were mostly  thoughts about committing  suicide,  but
on   two   occasions he  acted  out his thoughts   by   cutting   his  wrists  and   by   jumping   off   a
bridge. He claims  not to  have  acted  upon  similar thoughts since  he  was a  child. (Tr. 27-
30, 33, 35, 38-39)
More  recently,  his  psychological  issues  presented  themselves  in  2018,  when
Applicant was still in the Army. In February 2018, Applicant self-referred to the behavior
health clinic (BHC) because he was having passive suicidal thoughts  since October or
November  2017.  He  continued  seeing  providers  in  the  BHC  in  the  following  months.
Medical  records  from  March  21,  2018,  show  that  he  was  diagnosed  with  major
depressive disorder. During Applicant’s continuing BHC appointments,  in August 2018,
he was evaluated for an alcohol use disorder, which was confirmed by a diagnosis, in a
mild state. However, Applicant had no duty restrictions. Applicant was seen in the BHC
in  September  2018  with  no  significant  changes  to  his  situation.  On  October  11,  2018,
Applicant  self-referred  to  the  BHC  triage  clinic  and  described  that  he  believed  his unit
was not taking care of him by forcing him to participate in training rather than  allowing
him to get surgery on his injured shoulder.  He told the BHC staff that if  he did not get
admitted  to  the  hospital,  he  would  cut  his  wrists.  Thereafter,  he  was  escorted  to  the
hospital  emergency  room.  Upon  evaluation,  Applicant  indicated  that  he  had  suicidal
thoughts once a week and they extended back over the last month. He was admitted to
the psychiatric ward of the hospital. During his October 16, 2018 safety check after his
discharge from the psychiatric ward, Applicant told his provider that he sees apparitions
in  the  form  of  a  boy  or  a  girl.  He  claimed  to  have  seen  one  apparition  that  day.
Applicant’s provider characterized him as having a high risk of self-harm. Applicant has
not  sought  counseling, therapy,  or treatment since  he  left  the  Army in  2018.  When  he
was asked why he had not sought treatment or counseling when he could easily do so
from  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  he  responded  “I  honestly  can’t  answer
that, sir, I don’t know myself.” He claimed not to have had suicide ideations since 2018.
(Tr. 31-32, 39; GE 3)
In July 2021, Applicant underwent a psychological assessment at the request of
the DOD CAF. A licensed psychologist (Dr. X) performed the assessment and issued a
written  report.  The  assessment  consisted  of  a  records  review,  a  one-hour  clinical
interview,  and three hours of  psychological  testing and  interpretation.  Dr.  X diagnosed
Applicant  with  persistent  depressive  disorder,  with  intermittent  major  depressive
episodes; with  mood  congruent  psychotic features (Diagnostic and  Statistical  Manual of
Mental  Disorders,  5th  edition   (DSM-5)  300.4)  and   with   schizoaffective   disorder,
depressive  type  (DSM-5  250.1).  Applicant’s prognosis was characterized  as “guarded.”
His  psychological  testing   suggested   that  he   is  likely   to   be   “highly   treatment   resistant.”
Applicant agreed  with  Dr. X’s assessment.  Dr. X  concluded  that “subject’s mental health
seems  precarious enough  to  create  a  potential risk to  national security.”  (Tr. 39-40; GE

"Applicant admitted the two SOR allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) with brief comments.
I have incorporated her admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful
review  of  the  pleadings,  Applicant’s  testimony  and  the  exhibits,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  36   years  old.   She   has  a   high   school  diploma  and   some   technical
training. (Tr. 26) She  has never married. She  has two  22-year-old twin sons, born when
she  was 14  years old.  One  son  lives with  her, and  one  son  lives in another state. (Tr. 40-
41)  Since  May  2016, Applicant has worked  as a  custodian  for a  defense  contractor. Her
job  involves cleaning  offices on  a  U.S. military  facility. She  needs a  security  clearance  so
she  can  access  certain secure areas  on  the  facility  in order to  do  her job.  (GE  1;  Tr. 25-
29)   Applicant  also   works  a   night  shift   job,   with   her  son,   as   a   custodian   with   another
employer. (Tr. 41-42)
In   February   2017,  Applicant  received   a   psychosocial  assessment   at  behavioral
institute   W.   She   was  assessed   by   a   licensed   master   social  worker  (LMSW).  Records
indicated  that she  had  received  “OP” (Outpatient) treatment  at  the  same  facility  in 2014-
2015.   The   2017   assessment  noted   that  Applicant  returned   to   W   after  she   reported
“hearing  voices and  seeing  things.” Her symptoms grew  more severe in the  previous three
months.  (SOR ¶  1.a)  She noted  depression and said she could not read due to dyslexia.
She  reported  that she  had  been  physically  abused  by  a  boyfriend  as a  teen, and  reported
nightmares about prior abuse. (GE 5)
In the February 2017 assessment, Applicant noted significant trauma in her history.
She was molested at age 5 by a family friend; her mother went to jail for murder when
Applicant was 12. She was then raised by her aunt, but lived largely in group homes and
foster homes. She became sexually active at 12 and pregnant with twins at 14. At the
time  of  the  assessment,  her  children  lived  elsewhere,  and  she  lived  with  her  father.
Applicant  was  referred  to  outpatient  psychotherapy.  She  did  not  appear  for  her
appointment in March 2017, despite a call from the provider the day before. (GE 5) The
February 2017 assessment did not include a specific diagnosis.
On   her  May   2017   SCA,   Applicant  disclosed   unspecified,  lifelong   mental  health
treatment, noting that she had  been “Admitted as inpatient.”  (GE  1 at 24)
In September 2019, during the course of Applicant’s background investigation, the
DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) requested that she participate in a
psychological  evaluation.  After  a  brief  delay,  Applicant  scheduled  an  appointment  for
October 2019 and participated as requested. (GE 2, GE 3).
The psychological assessment was conducted by Dr. L, a Ph.D. licensed clinical
psychologist  and  board-certified  neuropsychologist.  (GE  3,  GE  4)  The  assessment
included an interview of Applicant, as well as review of available records and analysis of
current  psychological  results.  Only  an  oral  clinical  interview  was  conducted  because
Applicant said she could not read or write. (GE 3)
Dr.  L  diagnosed  Applicant  with  “schizophrenia,  multiple  episodes.”  She  noted
Applicant has a documented history of hallucinations and displays the negative symptoms
of  schizophrenia,  including  lack  of  facial  expression,  apathy,  and  dysphoria.  Further,
“although  not  observed  to  be  psychotic  during  this  evaluation,  [Applicant]  has  a  clear
history of psychotic disorder, for which she is not being treated.” (GE 3) (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Dr. L concluded her report as follows:
As  such,  [Applicant]   does  have   a   condition   that  could  impede   her
trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. Her prognosis is guarded,  as she
indicated   she   is unwilling   to   undergo   mental health   treatment.  Therefore,
there  is   a   significant  likelihood   of   recurrence/exacerbation   of   psychotic
symptoms. (GE 3) (SOR ¶ 1.b)
In answering the SOR in May 2020, Applicant admitted both allegations. As to SOR
¶ 1.a (the 2017 assessment), she wrote, “I agree. I sometimes  see shadows of things.”
As to SOR ¶ 1.b, she wrote, “I agree. I have scheduled appointments with a psychologist
to help with my condition will resume after shutdown.” (Answer to SOR)
Applicant testified that she went for the first assessment in 2017 because she told
her family doctor that she was depressed and her doctor referred her for the assessment.
(Tr. 32-33) She acknowledged that she did not go to the follow-up appointment; she said
they  wanted  her  to  take  pills  and  she  did  not  want  to  do  that  because  pills  make  her
drowsy. They offered counseling instead but Applicant could not afford it since she did
not  have  health  insurance.  (Tr.  33)  Applicant  did  not  receive  mental  health  treatment
between 2011 and 2017. (Tr. 35)
As to the 2017 evaluation, Applicant acknowledged that in 2017 she was hearing
voices  and  seeing  shadows,  but  said  she  did  not  experience  those  sensations  before
2017. (Tr. 36) Applicant recalled meeting Dr. L one time, for about 30 minutes.; “She was
just asking me a lot of questions.” Applicant had not read the report prior to the hearing,
because she cannot read. (Tr. 37) (The hearing was recessed for about 25 minutes so
that Applicant’s personal representative could review the report with her) (Tr. 38-39)
Applicant  confirmed  her  answer  to  SOR  ¶  1.b,  that  she  had  scheduled  an
appointment with a counselor and would pursue scheduling after the COVID-19 shutdown
ended. She was continuing to pursue that counseling or assessment with W at the time
of  the  hearing,  and  said  she  had  an  appointment  for  June  25,  2022.  (Tr.  44-45)  That
appointment did not occur, as her personal representative later advised (as noted above).
Applicant  said   she   has  been   dyslexic  since   she   as   a   child.   She   acknowledged
“comprehension   problems.” (Tr. 39) She   said   she   prepared   her written   SOR  response
with   help  from   her  personal  representative.  (Tr.  43)  She   also   testified   that  she   has   a
driver’s  license   and   drives  onto   the   facility   where  she   works.  (Tr.  28,  49-51)  She
recognizes street signs  and stop signs. She also said she can read  at a third-grade level
at most,  and  can  recognize  words like  “Secret,” “Classified,” and  “Unclassified.” (Tr. 48)
She said she has to see words “over and over again” to comprehend them. (Tr. 49)
At her hearing, Applicant said she is still working at the military facility, but is not
allowed  to  enter  secure  areas.  (Tr.  47-48,  53-55)  She  said  she  has  been  told  by  her
supervisor that if she has contact with classified information, “I [am not] supposed to touch
it,  look  at  it,  none  of  that.” (Tr. 47) “If  it’s classified,  we  usually  don’t  even  go  in  those
areas.  .  .  I  really  don’t  have  a  problem  with  that  because  we  [are]  not  allowed  .  .  .  as
custodians are not allowed  in those  areas.” (Tr. 47) “If I had a  clearance,  it’s different.”
(Tr. 48) She has gotten in trouble for attendance issues but not for security issues. (Tr.
29-31) Applicant described the process by which she checks in on the base and in her
assigned office, before proceeding to her duties. She said, “I love my job because I love
to clean.” (Tr. 52)
Applicant testified that she understood what her case was about. (Tr. 55-56) She
said she has meetings with counselors every two or three months, and that it was hard to
keep regular sessions because of her work schedule. (Tr. 57)
Applicant is not on any medication for her condition currently. She does not like
the way the medication makes her feel, since it makes her drowsy, which impacts her
work.  Her  doctor  offered  her  counseling  as  an  alternative.  The  last  time  she  saw  a
counselor, however was in 2019. (Tr. 58) Applicant acknowledged that her condition was
something she has to deal with, either through counseling or medication. (Tr. 59) Contrary
to  Dr.  L’s  conclusion,  Applicant  indicated  that  she  is  willing  to  pursue  mental  health
treatment to show that her condition is under control. (Tr. 59-60)
Applicant also wanted  to  convey  that she  is a  nice person, and  is outgoing  and
personable.  She  enjoys being  around  the  people she  works with  because  they  “sharpen”
(i.e. stimulate) her. (Tr. 62) She  wanted  to  join the  Army  but was not  able to  do  so  because
of her disability. (Tr. 62)
Applicant’s personal representative also testified, both about her interactions with
Applicant  and  as  the  employer’s  FSO.  She  has  been  the  FSO  for  15-20  years.  She
assisted  Applicant  with  answering  the  SOR,  and  believes  the  assistant  FSO  aided
Applicant in completing the SCA. Applicant does not need a clearance to get on the base,
but needs a clearance to access certain buildings without an escort. (Tr. 63-68) Applicant
has not had any reportable security incidents. (Tr. 71)
Applicant was referred to her employer through a state employment program for
people with disabilities. (Tr. 69) Applicant’s personal representative and FSO testified that
Applicant is “very nice, very positive, and very easy-going. So she is the nice person that
she says she is.” (Tr. 70)

"In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d, and  1.f. (HE
3)  He  denied   SOR  ¶¶   1.e   and   1.g.  He  also  provided   mitigating   information.  His
admissions are accepted as  findings of fact.  Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a   29-year-old  software  engineer,  who   has   worked   for  a   DOD
contractor  since  early  2019. (Tr. 21-22; GE  1)  He is not  married, and  he  does  not have
any  children.  (Tr.  22-23) In  2011, he  graduated  from  high  school,  and  President and  Mrs.
Obama  signed  a  letter  congratulating  Applicant for his  Eagle Boy  Scout  award. (Tr.  24-
25;  AE   R)   In   2016,   he   received   a   bachelor’s  degree   in  aerospace   engineering   with   a
minor   in  mathematics;   and   in   2022,  he   completed   seven   of  ten   courses   towards  a
master’s degree  in  aerospace  systems engineering.  (Tr. 26-28; AE A; AE  C)  He is in an
engineering  honor society  which is limited  to  the  top  20  percent of  the  engineering  class.
(Tr.  28;  AE   B)   His  resume   provides  additional  details  about  his  employment  and
accomplishments. (AE  J)
Psychological Conditions
Applicant was hospitalized the first time from May 6, 2011, to May 18, 2011, after
he demonstrated bizarre and aggressive behavior. (SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant believed that
his behavior was a reaction to stress during his senior year of high school, which included
schoolwork, movement to a different house, completion of his Eagle Boy Scout project,
and testing for college admission. (Tr. 29, 86-87; SOR response) He was living with a
friend  while  his  parents  were  in  the  process  of  moving  into  a  different  house.  (SOR
Response at 2) The psychosis appeared for the first time in 2011 when he was 17 years
old, and Applicant contended the psychosis may have been related to lack of sleep. (Tr.
29, 91) Applicant was living with a friend, and he was not returning his mother’s telephone
calls.  (Tr.  88)  The  guidance  counselor  at  Applicant’s  high  school  observed  Applicant,
who  had  an  unusual  breathing  tic.  (Tr.  30-32,  87)  The  guidance  counselor  asked
Applicant questions, and he responded with his odd breathing tic. (Tr. 89) The guidance
counselor called for an ambulance, and Applicant struggled to avoid being placed on a
stretcher. (Tr. 32, 89) The hospital could not diagnose the problem,  but recommended
that he remain in the hospital. (Tr. 32, 90-91) At Applicant’s request and with his parents’
support, the hospital sent Applicant home. (Tr. 32, 89)
While Applicant  was at his home,  he  was having  suicidal ideations.   “He  said  he
wanted  to  kill himself.” (Tr. 110) He was standing  in the  front yard and  not saying  anything
else.  (Tr. 112) He was depressed  about his health, not being  at school, and  worried  about
his future.  (Tr. 3  2)  His mother called  an  ambulance,  and  they  called the  police. (Tr. 110,
113) Applicant was returned  to  the  hospital for the  second  time  and  remained  an  inpatient
from   May   19,   2011,   to   June   2,  2011.  (Tr.  92;  SOR  ¶   1.b)  He  was  diagnosed   with   a
psychosis.  Id.  He was prescribed  Zyprexa (olanzapine is the generic name). (Tr. 33)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  allege  Applicant  was  hospitalized  to  treat  his  Psychotic
Disorder for the third time from February 23, 2012, to March 5, 2012, and for the fourth
time  from  March  12,  2012,  to  March  30,  2012.  The  context  of  the hospitalization  was
medication noncompliance. He was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, Disorganized Type.
In 2012, Applicant was 18 years old and a freshman in college. (Tr. 36) He was
receiving mental-health treatment. (Tr. 92) His grades for the first semester were As and
Bs. (SOR response at 2) He decided on his own, without informing his parents or mental-
health  provider,  to  stop  taking  his  medication.  (Tr.  36,  94)  He  told  his  mental-health
provider that he was in fact taking his medications. (Tr. 48) He rationalized that he did
not like the stigma of having a mental-health disorder; he did not like the side effects of
the medication; and he believed he would be fine without the medication. (Tr. 36, 52) He
believed if he was fine without the medication, then this would prove he did not need it.
(Tr. 48) In 2012, his mother slapped him, and Applicant slapped her back. (Tr. 69, 113)
She was not knocked down, and she did not seek hospitalization. (Tr. 114) The police
were not called. (Tr. 69) His grades were poor, and he was withdrawn. (Tr. 94)
After his release from inpatient treatment on March 30, 2012, Applicant  said he
complied with the treatment recommendations of his mental-health provider from 2012
to 2017. (Tr. 37, 108)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant was hospitalized for the fifth time from July 9, 2017,
to  July  27,  2017,  after  he  reduced  his  antipsychotic  medication  against  his  doctor’s
recommendation.  He  began  displaying  symptoms  of  psychosis,  including  homicidal
ideations. He was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, disorganized, chronic.
After  Applicant  received  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2016,  he  was  doing  well
professionally, and he was stable. (Tr. 39) He was living with his parents. (Tr. 96)  His
primary side effects from his medication were some drowsiness and a little weight gain.
(Tr. 52-53) The main reason he wanted to stop taking the medication was because of the
stigma  associated  with  his  mental-health  disorder.  (Tr.  54)  His  treating  physician
recommended no change in his medication; however, Applicant wanted to see whether
the medication was necessary. (Tr. 39) He gradually reduced his medication level until
he had completely stopped taking his medication. (Tr. 39) The previous time he stopped
taking his medication abruptly, and he believed if he gradually tapered off his medication,
he  might  not  have  any  problems.  (Tr.  51)  He  started  the  tapering  process  with  the
assistance of his doctor, and then he quit “cold turkey” without his doctor’s agreement.
(Tr. 108)
In  July 2017,  Applicant  was unable to sleep  for five consecutive days. (Tr. 39) He
had  a  delusion  that his  cat  could  talk to  him.  (Tr. 56) He  asked  God  what he  should  do,
and  “the  thought occurred  to  [him] - - for some  reason, to  shoot  up  a  mall.” (Tr.  40, 68,
97) He realized “that didn’t make any sense at all.” He described his  thoughts as “weird”
and   things  would  “blur   together.”   (Tr.  56)  He   told  his  parents  about   his  thought   about
shooting  up  a  mall. (Tr.  40) Applicant does not  own  any  firearms,  and  he  did not take  any
steps,  such  as purchase  of a  firearm,  to  effectuate  the  shooting. (Tr. 40)  He went to  the
emergency  room, and  told the  doctor about his homicidal thought.  He was admitted  for
mental-health  treatment on  July  9, 2017,  for  the  fifth  time.  (Tr.  40)  He said  he  has  been
taking  15  to  20  milligrams of  Zyprexa  daily  ever since  July  2017. (Tr. 41, 49-50, 73) He
might miss a  day  occasionally  because  he  wants to  ensure he  wakes up  on  time  and  is
not drowsy. (Tr. 73) He is  currently  taking  15  milligrams of  Zyprexa  at night.  (Tr. 50) He
has not been hospitalized  for mental-health treatment since 2017. (Tr. 41)
Applicant’s  mother  characterized  his  thoughts  about  shooting  up  a  mall  as  a
“passive  ideation”  because  he  lacked  a  firearm,  ammunition,  and  a  detailed  plan  to
effectuate this objective. (Tr. 98) He has not had any suicidal or homicidal ideations since
July 2017. (Tr. 41) Applicant has analyzed the benefits and risks or costs of not taking
prescribed medications, and he has determined it is best for him to continue taking his
medications. (Tr. 99) His mental-health provider indicated it is not unusual for patients
diagnosed with a mental-health disorder not to accept the diagnosis and to stop taking
their  medications  until  they  are  convinced  it  is  in  their  best  interests  to  take  their
medications. (Tr. 106-107)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges and Applicant agreed that in April 2019, Doctor D diagnosed
Applicant  with  Schizophrenia  (by  history).  (SOR  response)  In  April  2019,  Nurse
Practitioner W diagnosed Applicant with Delusional Disorder. Id.
SOR  ¶  1.g alleges  in October  2019,  Dr.  B, a  psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant
with Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type. Applicant’s prognosis was guarded because
he had stopped taking his medications in the past and Dr. B was not confident that he
was receiving proper treatment for Schizophrenic and Bipolar symptoms.
The DCSA CAF asked Dr. B to provide a mental-health assessment of Applicant.
(GE 2) Dr. B is a licensed clinical psychologist and a board-certified neuropsychologist.
Id.  at  4.  Dr.  B  reviewed  Applicant’s  mental-health  records,  conducted  a  Personality
Assessment
treating  nurse  practitioner,  and
interviewed Applicant. Id. at 1. Dr. B concluded:
interviewed  Applicant’s
Inventory,
Although   [Applicant]   was  pleasant  and   seemed   honest  in  his  report  of
symptoms  (and  in his honest  inability  to  report his own  history, at times), my
interview  of his treating  provider suggests [that]  he  has  not fully  disclosed
his history  to  her. She  has diagnosed  him  only  with  delusional  disorder, and
was unaware of  a  history  of  hallucinations,  mania,  or homicidal  ideation. Of
course,  I  am  not  certain if this  was an  intentional  effort to  hide  information
or if  his provider did not  thoroughly  gather historical information. His treating
provider  also indicated  that he  is medication  compliant and  symptom-free,
but  his  presentation   suggests  he   still   has   some   slightly   cloudiness  of
thought that is likely  a symptom. He stated  that he  is medication  compliant,
but is prescribed  only  Zyprexa. I would classify  his prognosis as guarded  at
this time  because  he has stopped  his medications in the past and  I am  not
confident that he  is receiving  proper treatment  for schizophrenia and  bipolar
symptoms  (rather he  is  only  being  treated  for  delusion  disorder). Therefore,
judgment,   reliability,  or
I  do   have   some   concerns  regarding   his
trustworthiness. (GE 2  at 4)
Dr. B believed Applicant had not fully disclosed his symptoms, including mania,
hallucinations,  and  homicidal  ideation  to  his  current  mental-health  provider.  (Tr.  61)
Applicant said he provided his 1500-page mental-health record to Nurse Practitioner W;
however, Nurse Practitioner W said she did not read all of it. (Tr. 61) She said she read
enough  to  understand  Applicant’s  mental-health  needs.  (Tr.  61)  Applicant  was  “pretty
sure”  he told her about his mania, homicidal ideation, other symptoms, and treatment.
(Tr. 62)
Applicant was seeing a mental-health provider, including Nurse Practitioner W, for
several  years  before  April  2022.  (Tr.  42)  Applicant  was  studying  late  at  night  for  his
master’s degree, and his medication made him sleepy. (Tr. 43) He overslept and missed
three appointments without warning his Mental-health provider. (Tr. 43, 59) The mental-
health provider terminated treatment because he missed three scheduled appointments.
(Tr. 43, 59-60) He claimed that he “rescheduled the appointments, and [he] still got the
treatment.” (Tr. 43) He said he made up every one of his appointments as soon as an
appointment  became  available.  (Tr.  59-60)  He  has  been  taking  the  same  medication
since 2017. (Tr. 43) He has not considered tapering himself off of his medication without
medical approval since 2017. (Tr. 44-45) He schedules his appointments in the afternoon
to ensure he goes to his appointments. (Tr. 60)
On April 21, 2022, Applicant began seeing a new mental-health provider, Nurse
S, and she is a Board Certified Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP-
BC). (Tr. 58; AE K) On April 22, 2022, Nurse S said:
[Applicant]   presented   as  stable,   admits   to   psychiatric  hx   of  psychosis.
History  also includes inpatient care due  to  acuity  of  symptoms. [Applicant]
has  consistently   been   stable  while   taking   medication,  currently  taking
zyprexa   (olanzapine)  15   mg   daily,  a   medication   also  indicated   for
depression   and   a   common   choice  when   insomnia   or  poor  sleep   is  also
observed.   Speech   was  normal,  displayed   appropriate   mood   and   affect,
thought  process  were  logical,  relevant.   Thought  content  was  normal,  no
psychotic  thoughts.   Displays  realistic  judgment  and   normal   insight  into
condition.  Normal  recent  and   remote   memory,  normal  attention   span.
Normal language ability. Fund of knowledge included normal awareness of
past and present events.
Initial impression:  Unspecified  psychosis not  due  to  a  substance  or known
physical condition (in  full remission) (f29)
To  meet criteria  for schizophrenia or a  mood  disorder, client was questioned
regarding   history   of   negative   symptoms,  manic   episodes,   depressive
episodes. Client was negative  for history  of  symptoms to  meet criteria  for
schizophrenia or a  mood d/o, such  as bipolar disorder.
Although   the   client  admits  to   history   of   delusional  behavior,  symptoms
emerged   briefly   during   periods  of  elevated   anxiety   and   disturbed   sleep.
Differential   diagnosis   includes   insomnia/anxiety   disorder,   disturbed   sleep
leading   to  presentation   of   psychotic features.   [Applicant]  has  consistently
taken  medication  since  2011  (senior in HS), zyprexa's mechanism  of  action
causes sedation  and  attempt to  taper and  discontinue  medication  must be
monitored  for  rebound  insomnia  and  other common  symptoms  of tapering
medication.
is  excellent,   based   on   clinical
assessment and history.  (AE K)
[Applicant’s]   prognosis
Applicant  was  unsure  whether  he   mentioned   his  homicidal  ideation   in  2017   to
Nurse  S. (Tr. 57) Mania  is a  symptom  of  Bipolar disorder. Applicant claimed  that Nurse
S  was aware of  Applicant’s mania; however, she  did not mention  his disclosure of  mania.
(Tr. 57) Applicant provided  his mental-health  records to  Nurse  S. (Tr. 57) Applicant  did
not know  why  Nurse  S  said,  “[Applicant]  has consistently  taken  medication  since  2011
(senior  in  HS),”  and   Applicant  acknowledged   that   Nurse   S   was  incorrect.   (Tr.   57)
Applicant believed his most accurate diagnosis is “Psychosis, Not Otherwise Specified.”
(Tr.  60-61)  He  did  not  believe   schizophrenia   was  correct  because   he   did  not  have
catatonia.  (Tr. 61)  He  believed  his psychosis  surfaced  when  he  was under  stress.  (Tr.
62)  However,  he   did  not  have   symptoms  when   he   was  under  stress  and   taking   his
prescribed  medication. (Tr. 63)
Applicant believes he has a good job, is doing well in his master’s degree program,
and enjoys his social community. (Tr. 46; SOR response at 3-4) In 2019 and 2020, his
employer  lauded  his  performance  in  his  evaluations.  (AE  D;  AE  E)  He  has  assisted
multiple volunteer organizations in his community. (AE F-AE I; AE L; AE M; AE Q) He
plays several sports, and he attends church. (Tr. 64, 109; AE N; AE O) He is a gifted
musician. (Tr. 109; SOR response at 3-4)
Applicant  realizes  now   that  there   is  much   less  of   a   stigma   associated   with   his
mental-health  disorder now  as  opposed  to  his belief of  a  significant  stigma  in 2017.  (Tr.
55)  If  he  has  a  mental-health  problem or a  side-effect issue  with  his  medication, he  will
seek advice and  assistance  from  his mental-health  provider. (Tr. 58)  His support  system
is to regularly telephone his parents,  and he has a large network of friends. (Tr. 63, 100,
109) His closest  friends  are  aware of his  mental-health  history  of psychosis, but  not about
the  homicidal ideation. (Tr. 64) His mother believes that Applicant’s best friend  would call
her if  Applicant had  a  mental-health  issue. (Tr. 101)  His employer and  facility  security
officer are aware of  his mental-health  issue. (Tr. 65) He  is not  currently  in a  relationship
with  anyone. (Tr. 64)  His mother believes Applicant will comply with  medical advice,  and
he   is   nonviolent,   is   a   good   person   and   diligent  employee.   (Tr.  115-116)  She
recommended approval of  his security clearance. (Tr. 115-116)
I requested  a  list of all  of  Applicant’s appointments  for the  previous  year. (Tr.  70,
128)  In  a  post-hearing  submission, Applicant  provided  evidence  of his appointments  from
2019  to 2022.  (AE  S)  In  2019, Applicant  went  to  four appointments on April 17,  April 29,
July  23, and  October 21. Id. In  2020, he  went to  four appointments on  January  13,  April
6, June  26,  and  September  5.  Id. In  2021,  he  went to  five  appointments  on  January  11,
March 1, April 5, July  20, and  October 11. Id. He missed  appointments on  October 15,
2019; January  10, 2022; and  January  25, 2022. Id. He did  not attend  any  appointments
from   October  12,  2021,  until  receiving   an   evaluation   from   Nurse   S   in  April  2022.  His
billings  for  appointments  do   not  support  his   claim   that  he   made   up   all   of   the   missed
appointments with  later appointments.  Id. He continued  to  received  his prescriptions for
Zyprexa   (olanzapine)  15   mg   daily   despite   not  going   to   appointments  with   his  mental-
health provider. (AE  T)
",False
"In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  that  he  received  the  diagnoses
described in  SOR ¶¶ 1.a  and 1.b. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is a  44-year-old  senior field  test engineer,  and he has worked  for  his
current employer, a DOD contractor, managing laboratories developing simulators and
fielding manuals for devices for the Army for six years. (Tr. 86-87; GE 1) He served in
the  Army  National  Guard  from  1996  to  2005,  and  he  was  honorably  discharged  as  a
Chief  Warrant  Officer  2  in  2005.  (Tr.  81,  84;  GE  1)  He  was  an  Apache  helicopter
mechanic and pilot. (Tr. 81) He received a physical and mental evaluation from the Army
which did not indicate any mental-health disqualifying issues. (Tr. 81) He injured his knee
and received surgeries in 2003 and 2004. (Tr. 83) He is not receiving disability from the
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  (Tr.  129)  He  has  not  served  in  a  combat  zone;
however, he served a tour in Kuwait from 1999 to 2000. (Tr. 129; GE 2 at 2) In 2007, he
attended college; however, he did not receive a degree. (GE 1 at 10) In 2010, he married,
and he does not have any children. (Tr. 129)
From  2005  to  2013,  Applicant  worked  for  DOD  contractors  training  helicopter
pilots  on  simulators.  (Tr.  84-85)  From  2013  to  2014,  he  supported  engineers  in  a
development environment. (Tr. 85) From 2014  to 2015, he worked with  simulators for
another  DOD  contractor.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  1997.  (Tr.  87)  His
periodic reinvestigation was in 2007. (Tr. 87) There is no evidence of security violations.
He  has  never  received  any  adverse  employment  actions  such  as  reprimands  or
suspensions. (Tr. 88)
Psychological Conditions
Applicant’s medical records indicate he first experienced bipolar symptoms when
he was six years old. (AE L at 145) Applicant denied any mental-health issues before
2005;  however,  he  was  the  victim  of  sexual  abuse  around  age  six.  (Tr.  107,  129)
Applicant’s grandmother was schizophrenic. (Tr. 128) Both of his parents have suffered
from depression. (GE 3 at 4)
In 2004, Applicant’s grandfather died, and  friends who were military aviators died
in accidents  at  Fort Hood, Texas and  Iraq. (Tr. 89)  Applicant  was engaged; however, the
engagement was not going  well. (Tr. 89) He was taking  pain medications after his knee
surgery.  (Tr.  89)  He  was  also  dissatisfied   with   his  employment.   (GE  2   at   3)  In   2005,
Applicant  sought help from   a   general practitioner and   was  diagnosed   with   depression
and   Attention   Deficit   Disorder  (ADD),  and   he   was  prescribed   Cymbalta,   an   anti-
depressant.  (Tr.  88, 106-108;  GE  2  at  3) He  took Cymbalta  for a  week or two. (Tr.  108)
He  began  to  think about committing  suicide. (Tr. 90, 130) His father took him  back to  see
his doctor. (GE 2  at 3) He learned  when  he  went back to  see  his treating  physician  that
he  mistakenly  received  an  excessively  large  dose  of  Cymbalta. (Tr. 91) A  flight surgeon
advised  him  to  stop  taking  Cymbalta  and  then  to  see  how  he  felt. (Tr. 91)  He  complied
with the  flight surgeon’s advice.
In  2006,  Applicant  was  feeling  lethargic  and  tired,  and  he  went  to  see  another
general practitioner. (Tr. 91; AE L at 45) He was diagnosed with depression and possibly
ADD. (Tr. 91) He was prescribed antidepressants and Ritalin for ADD. (Tr. 91, 110) The
side  effects  of  the  medications  made  Applicant  feel  worse,  and  despite  medication
changes, he was not improving.
Later in 2006, Applicant went to see Dr. D, a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with
a Bipolar Disorder. (Tr. 93) Applicant said for the first time he experienced episodes of
mania. (Tr. 111-112) He tried multiple mood stabilizers. (Tr. 112) He slept about three
hours over a four-day period, and he said his inability to sleep was due to taking Ritalin
medication.  (Tr.  112-113;  GE  2  at  3)  Applicant  believed  the  idea  that  he  was  manic
originated from his reaction to Ritalin. (Tr. 131) He felt “like Superman.” (Tr. 131) Dr. D
described Applicant as honest, candid, and reliable. (Tr. 92-93; AE L at 45, 154) Dr. D
said Applicant does not have a condition or treatment that could impair his judgment or
reliability, particularly in the context of safeguarding national security information. (AE L
at 154) Dr. D retired in 2008, and Applicant next saw Dr. E for about nine months. (Tr.
93; AE L at 45) The record does not contain Dr. E’s diagnosis.
From 2009 to 2010, Dr. F treated Applicant and he continued the Bipolar Disorder
diagnosis  and prescribed  Lamictal. (Tr. 114) Applicant  said  Dr.  F told  him he  was not
really sure the correct diagnosis was Bipolar Disorder. (Tr. 114) Applicant continued to
feel tired and lethargic; however, he did not feel depressed. (Tr. 115) Dr. F continued to
prescribe Lamictal, and Applicant took the medication because he was doing well with
this medication. (Tr. 114; GE 2 at 3) Dr. F recommended follow-up appointments every
six months or so to monitor how he was doing, and Applicant complied with this treatment
recommendation. (Tr. 115) In November 2010, he stopped seeing Dr. F because he was
moved  to  a  different  state.  Medical  records  from  Dr.  F  were  not  introduced  into  the
security record.
Dr. M, a psychiatrist, treated Applicant from April 2011 to October 2016. (Tr. 93;
AE L at 45) In April 2011, Dr. M wrote in Applicant’s medical records that he
presented   with   life   long   history   of   episodes  of   irritable  &   happy   mood,
excessive   [e]nergy,  decreased   need   for  sleep   and   increase[d]  sex   drive.
[Patient  (Pt)]  also  had   episodes  of   getting   depressed   and   irritable.   Pt
reported  having  disturbed  sleep  and  appetite, loss of  interest  in activity  of
daily   living,  lack  of   motivation,  multiple   episodes   of  anxiety   attacks,  and
multiple   episodes  of   crying   spells.  .  .  .  Pt  also  presented   with   history   of
feeling  anxious and  having  frequent  panic attacks. Pt  has also  a  long  history
of  paying  attention  to  details, difficulty  completing  prolonged  tasks, difficulty
initiating complex tasks, easily frustrated, and easily bored. (GE 4 at 1)
Dr. M diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar I Disorder (mixed type) in remission, ADD,
in  remission,  and  Obsessive
Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder,  Major  Depression
Compulsive  Personality  (OCP)  traits.  (Tr.  93-94,  116;  AE  L  at  45;  SOR  ¶  1.a)  Dr.  M
prescribed Lamictal for mood stabilization and Vyvanse for Attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). (Tr. 116)
On  July 25,  2013,  Dr.  M  noted  that  Applicant  “is  doing  well.  Anxiety  and  mood
level is great. Illness history of Bipolar course was reviewed with [Applicant] with clear
history  of  manic  or  hypomanic  episodes  but  ocp  traits  and  anxiety  and  recurrent
depressive episodes. No side effects from meds. Supportive and individual therapy was
provided.”  He  changed  his  diagnosis  to  Major  Depression  in  remission,  ADHD,  and
Obsessive Compulsive Personality (OCP) traits. (Tr. 95; GE 4 at 17) Dr. M reduced the
Lamictal  prescription  from  150  mg  to  100  mg  for  mood  stabilization  and  Adderall  for
ADHD. (Tr. 117; GE 4 at 17) Dr. M noted Applicant’s judgment was logical and his mood
was  stable.  (Tr. 96;  GE  4  at 17)  Dr.  M advised  the  OPM investigator  that  he  was  not
confident  about  the  Bipolar  Disorder  diagnosis  and  the  correct  diagnosis  might  be
Anxiety, Depression, ADD, and OCD traits. (AE L at 45)
Applicant followed   all  prescribed   or recommended  treatment  from  April 2011   to
October 2014,   and  from   October 2014   to   February   2016.  (Id. at  46)   Applicant did  not
receive  any  treatment  from  October 2014  to  February  2016, and  Dr. M  did not remember
why  Applicant stopped  treatment.  (Id.) Applicant had  the  following  appointments with  Dr.
M: six  in 2011,  eight in  2012, one  in  2013,  three  in  2014, and  two   in  2016.  (Id.) Dr. M
believed  Applicant  would  carefully  safeguard  classified  information  because  he  is  a
perfectionist, anxious, and has OCD. (Id.) His last treatment with Dr. M was in October
2016. (Tr. 97; GE 4 at 22)
Medical  records  generated  by  Dr.  M’s  recommends  follow-up  appointments  as
shown in the following table.

Applicant said that even though the medical records in some instances said to see
Dr.  M  every  couple  of  weeks,  Dr.  M  told  Applicant  that  he  needed  to  see  him  when
needed or to renew a prescription. (Tr. 117-118) Dr. M kept him on Lamictal even after
Applicant told Dr. M that he was taking vitamins and Chinese medicine. (Tr. 118) Dr. M
never told him to stop taking Lamictal. (Tr. 118) In 2017, Applicant saw Dr. M’s spouse
because Dr. M was out of the office; however, he did not provide the dates when he saw
Dr. M’s spouse. (Tr. 119)
In November 2017, Applicant went to Europe with his spouse, and he forgot his
medications. (Tr. 97) He discovered he felt better without his medications. (Tr. 97; SOR
response,  ¶  D.II) Without  his  medications,  he  felt  stable  and  less  groggy.  (Tr.  98)  He
believes his mental health can be stable through a low carbohydrate diet and exercise.
(Tr. 99, 127; GE 2 at 2) When he cheats on his diet, symptoms of tiredness and lethargy
return, which has occurred five or six times. (Tr. 127-128)
The DOD CAF asked Dr. B, a licensed clinical psychologist, to evaluate Applicant
for continued access to classified information. (GE 2 at 1) In April 2020, Dr. B generated
a psychological report for the DOD CAF. (GE 2) Dr. B considered Applicant’s background
information,  her  clinical  interview  and  observations  of  Applicant,  and  Applicant’s
Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). Dr. B provided a detailed mental-health history
of  Applicant,  and  she  diagnosed  him  with  Bipolar  II  Disorder,  Depressive  Disorder
(moderate, recurrent, in partial remission), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive
Compulsive Personality traits. (SOR ¶ 1.b; GE 2 at 5) Dr. B did not interview Applicant’s
spouse  or  coworkers.  (Tr.  99-101)  Dr.  B  explained  the  reasons  for  her  diagnosis  as
follows:
Applicant’s presentation  was inconsistent with  his psychological test results,
as he certainly is quite anxious, ruminative, and possibly hypomanic at this
time. His insight is clearly  lacking  and  his fixation  on  “blood  sugar issues”
and  diet  as  opposed  to  voicing  awareness of his psychiatric diagnoses is
concerning. He describes a  history  of  at least one  hypomanic episode  that
he   claims   was  the   result  of   taking   Ritalin   as   prescribed,  although   that  is
highly   unlikely.  He  also   describes   numerous  episodes  of   depression.
Therefore, I find  that the  prior diagnosis of  bipolar disorder is appropriate. It
does not seem  plausible that  he  has ADHD in my  opinion, as  he  does not
describe   his  attention   as  being   problematic  until  adulthood.  I  suspect  his
attentional issues are related  to  his other psychiatric conditions.  GE  2  at 5-
6.
Dr. B’s prognosis is as follows:
The   [A]pplicant’s  prognosis  is  poor,   based   on   his  limited   insight  and   the
absence  of ongoing  care for psychiatric conditions. This suggests increased
risk for instability, which can lead to impairment in judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness. (GE  2 at 5-6)
Dr. S  assessed  Applicant’s mental-health  at  Applicant’s request. (Tr. 25-31) Dr. S
is a  licensed  clinical social worker who  has  a  Ph.D. in psychology. He  has never held  an
active  license  in  psychology  “because  I  can’t make  [any] money  doing  that.”  (Tr. 32)  His
only  testimony  involved  cases about the  need  for longer stays in hospitals.  (Tr.  32)   He
said  he   has  seen   Applicant  regularly   about  once   a   week   since   December 1,  2020,  or
perhaps it was about 20  times over 18  months. (Tr. 28-29) From  December 1, 2020, to
January  6, 2021, he  said “[s]even  sessions have  been  completed  and  no  symptoms of
Bipolar  Disorder  have   been   detected   during   this  time.   Neither   have   any   other   serious
symptoms  been  uncovered during  our sessions.” (AE  F) Applicant said Dr. S’s sessions
were  about   every   two   to   four  weeks.  (Tr.  126)  Dr.  S   did   not   review   Applicant’s   past
medical records.  (Tr.  36, 41) He was unaware that Applicant experienced  symptoms  of
Bipolar and   Major   Depressive   Disorder  for several  years. (Tr.   38)   Applicant   told   Dr.   S
about  a   depressive   episode   in  2005   and   suicidal  thoughts.   (Tr.  39)  He  was  aware
Applicant  went  four  days  with  only  three  hours  of  sleep.  (Tr.  40)  In  response  to
Department Counsel’s question about not sleeping much for four days, Dr. S said he was
aware of this fact “but I don’t see that – I’ve done that, nobody is labeling me bipolar.”
(Tr. 40)
Dr. S most recently saw Applicant for a 50-minute clinical appointment on May 11,
2022, or May 13, 2022. (Tr. 34) He also saw Applicant on April 15, 2022, and on May 5,
2022.  (Tr.  51)  He  based  his  diagnosis  of  “almost  perfectionistic”  on  his  interview  of
Applicant, his spouse, and his coworkers. (Tr. 33, 36) He noted in his report that Applicant
“discontinued his prescriptions for bipolar three years ago due to visiting out of country
and, serendipitously, having forgotten to bring his medications. No symptoms of bipolar
appeared when the medications were not taken. This is attested to by his above average
performance  and  being  symptom  free  at  work  and  at  home.”  (Tr.  44;  AE  F)  Dr.  S
suggested that Applicant was inconsistent about going to his appointments from 2011 to
2016  because  Applicant  “thinks  he’s  found  the  cause  and  a  solution.  He  stopped  the
meds, I know that . . . I don’t know the details of why he would do that, I have no idea. I
didn’t know that, but I can’t imagine being worried about it when you’re doing fine.” (Tr.
46)
Dr. S’s diagnosis is that Applicant does not meet the criteria for Bipolar Disorder.
(AE  F)  He  is  almost  perfectionistic.  (Tr.  35,  46-47)  He  did  not  talk  to  anyone  who
previously diagnosed Applicant. (Tr. 34) He does not  provide  “a serious diagnosis like
bipolar or schizophrenic, [he] always asks for a second opinion.” (Tr. 35) Applicant is not
taking  any  medications.  (Tr.  28)  Applicant  is  “doing  beautifully.”  (Tr.  29)  He
recommended that Applicant continue with talk therapy and psychotherapy because he
believes “all  folks could  continue with talk therapy.”  (Tr. 34-35) He recommended that
Applicant see a mental-health provider every 15 to 30 days “for his own mental growth,
if he chooses, not because he really needs it, because he’s trying to grow, to understand
himself.”  (Tr.  49)  His  recommendation  is  that  Applicant  see  a  mental-health  provider
whenever Applicant deems it necessary or “as needed.” (Tr. 50) He believes Applicant
is  trustworthy.  (Tr.  29)  Applicant  received  inconsistent  diagnoses  over  the  years,  and
bipolar disease is frequently incorrectly diagnosed. (Tr. 30) Incorrect prescriptions can
have adverse medical effects. (Tr. 30) Cymbalta is prescribed for depression; however,
it can trigger suicidal tendencies. (Tr. 31)
Dr. S was focused on Applicant’s current behavior and how he was performing at
work,  and  not  on  his  mental-health  history.  (Tr.  41)  He  said  he  did  not  care  about
Applicant’s  diagnosis  from  three  years  ago.  (Tr.  41)  He  acknowledged  that  “there’s  a
possibility that  they [will]  fall back  to  where  they  were,  but  there’s somebody  trying  to
survive now. That’s what I’m concerned with is now and the behavior.” (Tr. 41)
Applicant does not have any concerns about his mental health, and he  has not
taken any medications for his mental health since November 2017. (Tr. 104, 119; SOR
response, ¶ D.III) He does not believe he has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. (Tr. 130)
He does not believe he has a chronic mental illness, and he does not believe he needs
psychiatric  care.  (Tr.  106,  120)  He  decided  not  to  return  to  see  Dr.  M  in  2017  after
consulting with  his spouse  who  does not  have  any training  in  psychology.  (Tr. 120) If
problems develop, he plans to seek help from a mental-health practitioner. (Tr. 105) He
is  willing  to  see  a  mental-health  provider  once  a  month  if  it  will  satisfy  security
requirements. (Tr. 132)
Applicant  said  security  officials  told  him  the  security  issue  was  the  Bipolar
Diagnosis,  and  he  believed  his  security  issue  was  resolved  when  Dr.  M  changed  his
diagnosis from Bipolar to Depression. (Tr. 121-122) He wanted to do whatever he needed
to  do  to  resolve  security  concerns.  (Tr.  122)  He  told  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)
when  the  issue  of  his  mental  health  first  arose,  and  Applicant  said  “[e]ssentially  that
before he had a diagnosis that he later attributed to blood sugar and not the diagnosis
he  was  given.”  (Tr.  60)  Applicant  told  his  FSO  that  he  stopped  following  treatment
recommendations and taking his medications without communicating with his treatment
provider.  (Tr.  61-62)  The  FSO  did  not  recommend  whether  he  should  follow  medical
advice or tell him that he needed to communicate with his treatment provider about not
taking his medications. (Tr. 62) He relied upon his FSO for advice on security matters.
(Tr. 122) His FSO did not consider him a threat to national security. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant did not know what to do when he received the SOR. (Tr. 123) He sought
advice  from  supervisors  in  his  company.  (Tr.  123-124)  They  suggested  he  seek  an
opinion from a third party, and he sought assistance from Dr. S. (Tr. 124) He provided
his  medical  records  to  Dr.  S.  (Tr.  125)  Dr.  S  told  Applicant  he  might  have  situational
depression in 2005 because of stress. (Tr. 125-126)
Character Evidence
Applicant  presented  three  character  witnesses  at  his  hearing  and  16  written
statements  from  his  coworkers,  friends,  pastor  and  spouse.  (Tr.  53-79;  AE  G)  The
general  sense  of  their  statements  is  that  Applicant  is  friendly,  reliable,  diligent,
professional, responsible, detail oriented, and trustworthy. (Id.) They did not provide any
negative information about his mental health, work performance, and disciplinary actions.
(Id.)  He  is  a  valued  asset  to  his  company  who  makes  important  contributions  to  his
company. (Id.) He supports his spouse and his community. (Id.) His work performance is
outstanding. (Id.) Their statements support his continued access to classified information.

"In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  in  part  and  denied  in  part  the  SOR
allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  2.a,  2.b,  2.c,  and  2.d.  (HE  3)  He  also  provided  mitigating
information.  (Id.)  His  admissions  are  accepted  as  findings  of  fact.  Additional  findings
follow.
Applicant is a 40-year-old senior technical management lead over a team of three,
soon to be five employees, and they perform laboratory work in the area of logistics data
for a DOD contractor. (Tr. 19, 21) He has worked for his current employer since 2014.
(Tr. 19, 21) In 2000, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 21) In 2003, he married, and his
three children are ages 11, 16, and 18 years old. (Tr. 20-21) His spouse was diagnosed
with bipolar disorder and depression, and she sees a counselor and takes mental-health
medication. (Tr. 51)
In 2000, Applicant joined the Army National Guard (ARNG), and in 2003, he was
activated and sent to Iraq for almost 12 months.  (Tr. 22,  24) His military occupational
specialty  (MOS)  was  information  systems  analyst  operator.  (Tr.  22-23,  64)  In  2008,
Applicant received an honorable discharge from the ARNG. (Tr. 46) Shortly after leaving
the ARNG, he joined the Army Reserve, where he honorably served until his discharge
due to expiration of his term of service (ETS) in 2018. (Tr. 27, 47-48)
Applicant’s  Army Reserve  unit  had a  large  number of  senior noncommissioned
officers, and Applicant as a sergeant (E-5) was required to do work that he considered
inappropriate  for  someone  of  his  rank  and  experience.  (Tr.  27-29)  Applicant  had  a
medical profile and was unable to pass a physical training test. (Tr. 29) When he left the
Army, he had 17 years of service towards retirement, and he was a sergeant. (Tr. 45-46,
75-76)
Psychological Conditions
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant received mental-health treatment from October 2015
to  May  2017.  He  was  diagnosed  with  Opioid  Abuse,  uncomplicated,  and  Major
Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate. (GE 3 at 38; HE 2) He was prescribed Zoloft,
Trazadone, and Wellbutrin. (Id.) His prognosis vacillated between guarded and good. He
decided to end his treatment shortly after a change in his medications.
Applicant admitted he received the treatment described in SOR ¶ 1.a.  (HE 3) In
about  2014,  he  consumed  his  spouse’s  prescription  anxiety  medication  three  or  four
times a week until 2016 because he was feeling anxious. (Tr. 52-53) He did not have a
prescription for his own anxiety medication. (Tr. 52) About four years ago, he also used
his  mother-in-law’s  prescription  migraine  pain  medication  because  he  had  pain  from
doing pushups and physical training in the Army. (Tr. 56-57)
In  2015,  Applicant  was  having  difficulties  in  his  marriage,  and  he  said  he  had
unrealistic expectations about the quality of the housework his spouse was supposed to
perform. (Tr. 28) At his initial mental-health appointment in October 2015, the provider
noted  that  Applicant  described  chronic  pain  and  self-medication  using  his  spouse’s
Klonopin  and  Loratabs.  (GE  3  at  37)  “He  admitted  to  occasional  alcohol  abuse,  but
denied  any  history  of  blackouts,  cravings  or  withdrawals.  He  reported  chronic  anxiety
[with] weekly panic attack.” (Id.) He attributed his depression to issues in his marriage.
(HE 3) In 2015, he said he went to counseling once or twice a month. (Tr. 30)
Applicant’s medical records reflect that he  saw a mental-health practitioner from
October  2015,  to  May  2017.  (GE  3)  His  May  2017  progress  note  states  “Today’s
symptoms  include  concentration  difficulty  or  mind  going  blank,  difficulty  handling
uncertainty or indecisiveness, excessive worry, feelings of loss of control, restless/keyed
up, sense of dread/fear, tense.” (GE  3  at  1) The  Assessments  were Major depressive
disorder, recurrent, moderate; Anxiety disorder, unspecified; Insomnia, unspecified; and
very depressed and increase in anxiety. (Id. at 2) The treatment recommendation was to
continue  Wellbutrin  (depression),  start  Zyprexa  (depression),  start  Trintellix  (anxiety),
and  stop  Zoloft  (anxiety).  (Id.)  The  prognosis was  good  and  continued  psychotherapy
was recommended as needed. (Id.)
At his hearing, Applicant said his marriage improved and is much better now than
it  was  in  2015.  (Tr.  33;  HE  3)  His  children  are  doing  well  in  school  and  enjoy
extracurricular activities. (Tr. 34-36)
Applicant ended his opioid abuse after he received shoulder surgery in  2019. (Tr.
69) His shoulder surgery ended his chronic pain and his need  for opioids. (Tr. 69)
In July 2019, Dr. L, a psychologist, evaluated Applicant at the request of the DCSA
CAF.  (SOR  ¶  1.b;  HE  2)  Dr.  L  diagnosed  him  with  Unspecified  Anxiety  Disorder,
Unspecified Depressive Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate. (GE 4 at 4) Dr.
L said:
[Applicant]  either lacked  insight  into  his  problematic alcohol  use  and  drug
misuse, or was intentionally attempting to downplay his history. He has not
received   proper  interventions  for  his  mental   health   conditions,  and   has
opted   to   discontinue   treatment  on   his  own.   Given   his  minimization   of   his
history, lack of sufficient treatment,  minimal  social support, and  continued
relationship  with  the  individual that he  identifies as  the  culprit for his past
inappropriate  behaviors, his prognosis is  guarded.  [Applicant’s]  judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness are likely to be impaired. (GE 4  at 4)
Applicant said his diagnosis and prognosis may have resulted from anxiety due to
his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and concern about losing his
security clearance. (HE 3) At the time of his evaluation in 2019, he was taking CBD oil.
(Tr.  58)  He  asked  his  supervisor  about  using  CBD  oil,  and  based  on  his  supervisor’s
response,  he  stopped  using  it.  (Tr.  59)  His  use  of  CBD  oil  does  not  raise  a  security
concern.
Dr. L said Applicant “seemed to minimize his problematic history.” (GE 4 at 3) He
had physical signs of depression, hostility, and bitterness. (Id.) At his hearing, Applicant
suggested he was probably feeling some agitation and hostility because of the length of
time the process was taking, and he believed he was doing a good job at work. (Tr. 71)
Dr.  L  said  Applicant  had  “a  history  of  antisocial  behavior,”  (GE  4  at  3)  and  Applicant
believed Dr. L was referring to his lack of attendance at social activities and his orientation
towards  his family.  (Tr. 72)  Applicant disagreed  with  Dr.  L’s  statement that his friends
and family were “unsupportive.” (Tr. 72; GE 4 at 3) His mother-in-law and father-in-law
have been particularly supportive of him. (Tr. 72)  Dr. L said she was concerned about
Applicant’s “continued relationship with the individual that he identifies as the culprit for
his past inappropriate  behaviors.” (Tr. 73-74; GE 4 at 4) Applicant believed Dr. L was
referring to his spouse. (Tr. 74)
Applicant took Zoloft until November 2016. (GE 2 at 2) He is not currently taking
any medication for his anxiety and depression. (Tr. 62) He has not had any mental-health
counseling or treatment since November 2016. (Tr. 62; GE 2 at 2)
Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and the point
of intoxication, from about 2016 to at least July 2019. (HE 2) Applicant said his period of
heaviest alcohol consumption was when he was having marital issues from 2014 through
2016. (Tr. 49)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges Applicant was arrested in March 2016, and charged with DUI.
(HE 2) He drank two bottles of wine and six beers; he consumed his wife’s prescribed
Klonopin, and he had a blackout or loss of memory. (Tr. 55-56; GE 2 at 1) He locked
himself in his children’s bedroom, and his spouse called the police. (Tr. 60; GE 2 at 1)
He went outside and sat in his vehicle, and the police arrested him for DUI. (GE 2 at 1)
His  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  was  .14.  (GE  5)  He  did  not  receive  any  adverse  or
disciplinary  action  from  the  Army.  (Tr.  65)  His  supervisor  said  no  adverse  action  was
necessary because he was not on duty. (Tr. 65)
When Applicant went to court, he pleaded guilty and received pretrial diversion.
(Tr. 68; GE 2 at 1) He attended the required driving classes, paid the court-ordered fines
and  fees  totaling  $1,250,  and  he  successfully  completed  two  years  of  unsupervised
probation. (Tr. 68; GE 2 at 1-2; GE 5; GE  5) He  did not receive  a conviction, and his
record was expunged. (Tr. 68)
SOR  ¶  2.c  alleges  Applicant  received  treatment  at  an  Army  Alcohol  and
Substance  Abuse  Program  (ASAP)  from  March  2016,  to  July  2016,  for  a  condition
diagnosed, in part, as Alcohol Abuse Disorder, Mild. (HE 2) He attended two classes or
counseling sessions a week in ASAP during the four months of ASAP treatment. (Tr. 65)
He was advised that he should not drink alcohol in the future; however, he was unsure
whether this recommendation was limited to his time in ASAP or forever. (Tr. 66)
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges Applicant continued to consume alcohol, notwithstanding his
treatment for Alcohol User Disorder, Mild or Moderate, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 2.c.
(HE  2)  He  disagreed  with  the  diagnosis  of  Alcohol  Use  Disorder.  (Tr.  73)  He  said  he
rarely consumes alcohol, and when he does, it is usually to a moderate degree at social
functions. (Tr. 37-38) He may not consume any alcohol for four to six months. (Tr. 39)
He usually limits his alcohol consumption to two beers. (Tr. 38-39)
Applicant  attended   about  25   Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings,  and   he
received  a  chip.  (Tr. 66) He was unsure whether the  chip was for six  months or one  year
of  sobriety. (Tr. 67) He stopped  attending  AA  meetings in May  2017,  because  he  did not
believe  he  was an  alcoholic. (Tr. 63, 73) He found  the  AA  meetings and  the  stories of
others with  drinking  problems to  be  depressing. (Tr. 73) He does not crave  alcohol. (Tr.
73) His  support group  consists of his family,  coworkers, and  pastor. (Tr. 40) If  he  has
difficulties,  he can talk to his support group  and seek their assistance. (Tr. 41)
Character Evidence
A program manager who has worked closely with Applicant for almost four years
intelligent,  professional,  diligent,  responsible,  and
described  him  as
conscientious.  (Tr.  82,  85.)  He  is  dedicated  to  his  family.  (Tr.  85)  At  social  events,
Applicant consumes alcohol at a responsible level. (Tr. 84)
friendly,
A  deputy  director  of  a  business  unit,  program  manager,  and  senior  network
engineer where Applicant is employed has known Applicant since Applicant was 17 years
old.  (Tr.  89-90) When  the  deputy  director  was  in  the  Army,  he  assisted  in  Applicant’s
transfer from the ARNG to the Army Reserve. (Tr. 91) The deputy director worked for the
DOD contractor after retiring from the Army, and he recruited Applicant to work for him.
(Tr.  91)  Applicant  works  in  his  section  and  has  been  promoted  to  team  lead.  (Tr. 91)
Applicant is competent, productive, and trustworthy. (Tr. 92, 96) He considers Applicant’s
current level of alcohol consumption to be responsible. (Tr. 94-95)
Applicant received outstanding performance evaluations from the DOD contractor
for 2020 and 2021. (AE A-AE B) He has excellent performance evaluations as an Army
noncommissioned  officer,  except  some  of  the  performance  reports  note  that  he  was
unable  to  pass  the  Army  physical  fitness  test.  (AE  C-AE  N)  His  character  evidence
supports his continued access to classified information.

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  except  ¶  2.d,  which  he  denied.
Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2005. He does not
have  children.  He  earned  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2017.  He  began  work  for  a  federal
contractor in April 2019. He worked at various jobs from 2013 to 2019, including working
in food service, at liquor stores, retail stores and computer repair. He had long sketches
of unemployment with periods of short, contract jobs from 2009 to 2013. (Item 3)
Applicant  received  treatment,  with  varying  frequency,  at  a  health  and  human
services center, from about June 2006 to about June 2009, for Bipolar Mood Disorder.
His  treatment  consisted  mostly  of  obtaining  free  samples  of  medication.  His  mental
health  and  substance  abuse  history  shows  he  received  outpatient  psychological
treatment and tried a myriad of medications. (Items 2, 3, 5)
In  September  2020,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  duly  qualified  licensed
psychologist  (LP)  approved  by  the  Government.  Based  on  an  interview,  a  review  of
available records, and an analysis of his current psychological results, the LP diagnosed
Applicant  with  Bipolar  II  Disorder,  in  remission,  and  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,  severe,
currently in remission. He advised the LP that he was not currently abusing alcohol, but
still  consumed  beer  despite  the  severe  difficulties  it  had  caused  him  in  the  past.  His
consumption would increase during football season. He told the LP that in 2008 he had
stopped drinking heavily when he moved back into his parents’ house, but admitted that
he continued to consume alcohol and hid his drinking from his parents while living there.
Applicant  did  not  desire  to  undergo  formal  treatment  for  his  psychological  disorders.
(Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
The  LP  found  that  Applicant’s  psychiatric  conditions  and  lack  of  ongoing
treatment  could  ultimately  lead  to  compromised  reliability,  judgment,  stability,  and
trustworthiness. She concluded Applicant’s prognosis is guarded. (Item 5)
Applicant  consumed alcohol,  at  times  in excess  and  to  the  point of  intoxication,
from  about  1994  to  at  least  September  2020.  He  continued  to  consume  alcohol,  but
decreased his drinking in 2008. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the psychological
condition  allegations and  stated:  “I have  stopped  drinking  completely  as  the  pandemic
progressed  and  am  open  to  formal  treatment.”  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  alcohol-
related incidents since 2005 or that he has consumed alcohol since 2020. (Items 2, 3, 4)
Applicant was arrested in about 2005 and charged with operating a vehicle while
intoxicated,  first  offense.  In  his  June  2019  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  he
disclosed  that  the  final  disposition  ordered  by  the  court  was:  “Alcohol  and  Other  Drug
Abuse  (AODA)  assessment  after  an  Operating While  Intoxication  offense.  Referred  to
group dynamics for driver safety. Completed March of 2019, 14 years after the offense.”
He provided no explanation for his delay. (Items 2, 3, 5)
Applicant  used  marijuana  from  about  June  1996  to  at  least  May  2017.  He  was
arrested  in  1999  for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia.  He  was  found  guilty,  and  was
given  a  six-month  suspended  jail  sentence,  and  had  his  license  suspended.  He  was
arrested  in  March  2001  for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  and  possession  of
marijuana. He was found guilty. He was arrested in about July 2005 for possession of
drug paraphernalia. He was found guilty and was given a $323 fine. (Items 2, 6, 10, 11)
Applicant  was  arrested   twice  in  2006   (May   and   August)   for  operating   a   vehicle
while   his  license   was  revoked   (3rd   offense).  He  was  found   guilty   both   times  and
sentenced to one day in jail. (Items 2, 8, 9)
Applicant was arrested in March 2007 for possession of drug paraphernalia and
possession of marijuana. He was found guilty and given a four-month jail sentences that
was suspended, a six-month suspended license, and one year of probation with no use
of drugs or alcohol, and to attend substance abuse treatment. (Items 2, 7)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2012  for  obstruction  of  justice,  or  congress,  or
legislative, or commission. He stated in his SOR answer that he was obstructing a street
that was closed by police barricades during a permitted protest. In June 2013, Applicant
was  arrested  for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  and  possession  of  marijuana.  He
was found guilty and sentenced to five days in jail and a $400 fine. (Items 2, 6, 12)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in July 2019. During his
interview,  he  acknowledged  his  past  drug  use.  He  indicated  his  likelihood  of  being
involved in illegal drugs in the future was very low. He said he had switched to craft beer
and  was  learning  how  to  lead  a  more  responsible  life  without  indulging  in  the  use  of
marijuana.  He  had  moved  to  a  new  city  and  no  longer  socialized  with  the  people  he
used drugs with. (Item 4)

"Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the  following
findings  of  fact:  Applicant  is  48  years  old.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1996  in
physics  and  mathematics,  and  a  master’s  degree  in  1998.  He  earned  his doctorate  in
condensed matter physics in 2002. After he graduated with his Ph.D., he was hired by a
federal  contractor.  His  job  title  is  senior  research  scientist.  Applicant  is  reportedly
considered a highly valued employee by his employer. In 2014, his employer permitted
him  to  return  to  his  home  state,  and  set-up  an  approved  facility  for  storing  and
processing  classified  information  in  his  home  office.  Applicant  married  his  spouse  in
2000 and they have a daughter, age 12. (Tr. 19-20, 27-30; SOR response; GE 1, GE 4;
AE E, AE F)
In   March  2016,  Applicant  and   his  family   became   aware  that  he   was  suffering
from  a  mental health  condition. He was in a  manic state  and  he  was acting  peculiar. He
visited   his  primary   care  physician   and   was  prescribed   an   antipsychotic  medication.  In
April 2016, Applicant was involuntarily  admitted  for inpatient psychiatric hospitalization.
He  stayed   in  the   hospital  for  six   days,  and   he   was  diagnosed   with   Psychosis  and
Bipolar I Disorder, currently manic, with psychotic features and anxious distress.  (SOR ¶
1.a) He left  the  hospital with  a  different medication, Risperdal, which  helped  him  come
out of  his manic state, and  he  was referred  to  a  mental health  professional. (Tr. 21- 25,
34-35)
Applicant  received  treatment  from  a  mental  health  professional  from  May  2016
through June 2016, for his bipolar disorder. (SOR ¶ 1.b) Medical records reflect that he
was advised to abstain from alcohol use. He also visited a psychiatrist from July 2016 to
June  2018.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  Applicant  was  repeatedly  advised  during  sessions  to
immediately  stop  drinking  alcohol.  He  did  not  want  to  follow  this  recommendation.  He
was  informed  that  drinking  any  alcohol  was  dangerous  for  someone  with  an  unstable
mood  disturbance.  He  changed  his  therapy  treatment  to  another  facility.  In  2018,
Applicant  wanted  to  change  his  psychiatrist  because  he  did  not  consider  the  medical
professional a  “good fit” unless his treating psychiatrist would continue  his medications
and not challenge his right to drink alcohol. Applicant also started therapy in about July
2016,  at  a  different  clinic.  He  has  continued  treatment  at  this  facility  to  at  least  June
2022.  (SOR  ¶  1.d)  Applicant  expressed  some  concerns  about  his  alcohol  use  during
therapy. (Tr. 25-27, 34-35; GE 5, GE 6; SOR response, AE A, AE K)
In  April  2017,  following  a  suicide  attempt,  Applicant  was  admitted  for  inpatient
psychiatric  hospitalization.  He  was  diagnosed  with  suicide  ideation  and  severe
depressed Bipolar I Disorder without psychotic features.  (SOR ¶ 1.e) Applicant’s  DOD
security  clearance  was  suspended  following  this  hospitalization,  and  a  background
investigation was initiated. All classified material at his home office was returned to his
employer. (Tr. 28-31,
Applicant was admitted  in June  2018  for inpatient  psychiatric hospitalization  for a
condition   diagnosed   as  Bipolar  Affective   Disorder,  currently   manic,   moderate.  (SOR  ¶
1.f)  He tested  positive  for alcohol  at the  time  of  his admission. His wife  reported  that he
appeared   to   be   in   a   manic  phase,  and   she   was  particularly   concerned   about   his
increased  consumption  of alcohol.  The  medical records  report  that  from March to  June
2018, Applicant was drinking  4  to  5  alcoholic drinks per day.  He left the  hospital against
medical advice.  He  later told  his therapist  he  was “held  against  his  will” and  was angry
with  his wife  for taking  him  to  the  hospital.  (Tr. 39-43;  AE  B, AE  J; GE  4, GE  5,  GE  8;
SOR response)
In July 2018, Applicant started receiving mental health treatment from a different
doctor who is board-certified in psychiatry. His psychiatrist stated in a June 2022 letter
that  beginning  in  2019,  Applicant’s  symptoms  have  remained  stable  with  medication
management  and  psychotherapy.  He  is compliant  with  his treatment  plan  and  has  not
suffered any manic episodes since 2018. The treatment records reflect that his current
psychiatrist “strongly encouraged”  Applicant to refrain from alcohol use. (Tr. 39-43; AE
B, AE J; GE 4, GE 5, GE 8; SOR response)
The  DCSA  CAF requested  Applicant undergo  a  mental health  evaluation  after  he
had  been  hospitalized  for psychiatric issues in  2016,  2017, and  2018. Applicant agreed
to  the  evaluation, and  on  November 15, 2019, he  met with  a  licensed  psychologist. The
psychologist  reviewed   his   medical   records,  his  security   investigation,   and   she
conducted   a   clinical  interview   with   Applicant.   She   also  administered   the   Structured
Clinical Interview  for Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual for Mental  Disorders 5th  Edition
(SCID-5-CV),  Beck  Depression   Inventory   (BDI-II),   Beck  Anxiety   Inventory   (BAI),
Minnesota   Multiphasic  Personality   Inventory  –   2  –   Restructured   Form   (MMPI-2-RF),
Mood  Disorder Questionnaire  (MDQ), and  the  Alcohol Use  Disorders Identification  Test
(AUDIT). The combined information was used  for her assessment.  (GE 3)
The  clinical  psychologist  noted  that  Applicant’s  scored  very  high  on  the  AUDIT
test with a score of 15; a score of 8 or more is indicative of harmful drinking behavior in
men.  She  diagnosed  Applicant  with  an  Alcohol  Use  Disorder,  mild.  He  reported  mild
depression  starting  in  his  early  20s  and  increasing  in  severity  and  being  intermittent
since  that  time.  He  last  experienced  a  depressive  episode  in  2017.  His  symptoms
appeared  to  be  managed  well  with  his  current  psychotropic  medications.  He  also

engages  in  regular  outpatient  mental  health  counseling  to  manage  his  Bipolar
Disorder. Despite the fact that he was functioning well at the time of the evaluation, the
mental  health  professional  reported  that  there  is  a  moderate  to  high  probability  that
Applicant will experience another manic/hypomanic or depressive episode in the future.
His  prognosis  is  guarded  given  the  evidence  of  his  three  most  recent  hospitalizations
and due to the chronic nature of Bipolar I Disorder; the high probability of reoccurrence
of manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes; and his problematic use of alcohol. She
also  noted  the  interactive  effects  of  alcohol  used  with  his  listed  psychotropic
medications was worrisome. Applicant admitted to drinking more than intended at least
one  time  per  month.  His  current  use  of  alcohol  could  have  a  negative  effect  in  the
management of his Bipolar I Disorder. (GE 3)
The clinical psychologist endorsed Applicant’s continuation of current psychiatric
treatment  and  mental  health  counseling.  She  recommended  that  he  reduce  and
preferably  abstain  from  all  alcohol  use,  especially  since  he  is  taking  psychotropic
medications.  His  current  Bipolar  I  Disorder  and  Alcohol  Use  Disorder  appear  to  make
him  vulnerable  to  blackmail,  pressure  or  coercion,  and  therefore  concluded  that
Applicant is an unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. (GE 3)
Applicant  admitted  that  during  some  of  his  counseling  sessions  discussions
concerning  his  alcohol  use  had  been  initiated.  During  his  manic  episodes  he  drank
alcohol more frequently, and at times daily. He abstained from drinking alcohol after his
2016  hospital  discharge,  as  his  treating  doctor  at  that  time,  advised  him  to  stop.  He
returned  to  drinking  alcohol  in  early  2018,  when  he  was  in  the  beginning  stages  of  a
manic episode. After his discharge from the hospital in 2018, he was again advised to
abstain from using alcohol. Applicant testified that he did not abstain but chose instead
to moderate his use of alcohol. He currently drinks alcohol on a regular basis, usually 6
to 8 drinks during the week. He testified that his current use of alcohol does not cause a
problem  in  his  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  He  also  acknowledged,  after
receiving  the  SOR  in  September  2020,  his  awareness  of  the  Government’s  concern
about  his  current  use  of  alcohol  against  medical  advice.  Even  though  he  has  been
advised  by  multiple  medical  professionals  to  abstain  from  using  alcohol,  it  is  his
intention to continue to limit his use of alcohol in the future. (GE 6; Tr. 27, 32-33, 37-49)
Applicant provided employee performance evaluations covering 2017, 2018, and
2019.  All  of  his  assessments  described  him  as  a  valued  employee  and  critical
contributor. He is viewed as one of the leaders in the industry for innovative ideas and
mathematical approaches to complex physics. Applicant’s endeavors support the needs
of the customer and organization. (AE I)
The  technical  director  at  his  employment  and  a  former  co-worker  appeared  as
witnesses  for  Applicant.  They  both  knew  him  when  he  was  first  hired  by  his  current
employer in 2002. Both witnesses testified that Applicant is brilliant and  an exceptional
asset to the company. They testified that they were aware of his mental health issues,
but  overall,  they  believe  he  is  reliable  and  trustworthy,  and  recommended  that  his
security clearance be reinstated. During cross examination, the witnesses were asked if
they  would  be  concerned  to  discover  that  Applicant  was  not  complying  with  his
psychiatrist’s recommendation; specifically, if he was told to abstain from alcohol but he
continued to consume it.  Both witnesses agreed that Applicant should be following his
doctor’s orders. (Tr. 67-91)

"In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  allegations in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and
1.b   and   denied   the   allegation   in  SOR  ¶   1.c.   His   admissions  in   his   answer  and   at  the
hearing  are incorporated in  my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 48-year-old security guard employed by a federal contractor since
February 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1993 to February
2006  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.  There  is  no  evidence  that  he  had  any
disciplinary  problems  in  the  Army.  He  was  a  federal  counter-terrorism  agent  from
September  2006  to  September  2007.  He  worked  for  various  non-federal  employers  in
various capacities involving law enforcement and physical security from July 2010 until
he was hired by his current employer. There is no evidence of unusual behavior since
July 2010. He currently is a site supervisor for three security agents. He testified that he
held  a  security  clearance  in  2006  while  employed  by  another  government  agency.  At
present, he does not have an active clearance. (Tr. 22.)
Applicant married in 2004 and divorced in 2006 due to cultural differences. His ex-
wife wanted to live with her parents in a foreign country, and he wanted to return to the
United States after his discharge from the Army. He has no children.
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  his  employment  as  a  federal
counter-terrorism agent was terminated under the pretense that he suffered from a mental
disorder. He claimed that he was a victim of organized gang stalking by subversive agents
using space-based satellite weapons systems. His answer included 100 case studies of
individuals claiming that they were victims of organized stalking, torture and abuse using
directed energy and neurological weapons that resulted in disruption of senses and bodily
functions, and relentless thought control, all controlled remotely by radio frequency.1 The
1 Applicant  refers  to the  Space Preservation  Act  of  2001  in  his  answer  and  attached  a copy  of  the Act to  his
answer. The Act was introduced in the House of Representatives in 2001, 2002, and 2005. In each case it
was   referred   to  committee  and  no  further  action  ensued.  The   legislative  history   can   be   found   at
sourcewatch.org/index.php.space__Space_Preservation_Act.
case  studies  were compiled  by  an  organization  engaged  in efforts  to  protect individuals
from covert harassment and surveillance. (Tr. 58.)
Applicant  testified  that  after  a  work  trip  in  2007,  he  told  a  fellow  agent  that  he
noticed  “hard  surveillance,”  consisting  of  an  unusual  number  of  agents  at  the  airport
where they landed. After returning from the work trip, he was questioned about what he
had observed, and he filed a report about his observations. He also reported that other
agents were spreading false rumors about him. He was taken to a medical facility but he
refused to voluntarily admit himself. (Tr. 34-40)
In 2007, Applicant telephonically contacted the local field office of a federal  law-
enforcement  agency  several  times  and  reported  that  there  were  subversive  activities
going on in his agency. He then went to the headquarters of the law-enforcement agency,
hoping to talk personally with an agent, but he was turned away by the security guard at
the entrance. At the hearing, he testified that, as he was leaving the headquarters office
in his vehicle, he was stopped by several law-enforcement agents, briefly detained, and
then allowed to leave. (Tr. 25-28)
Applicant was living with his father and stepmother when he was terminated from
his counter-terrorism position. He testified that when he tried to explain to his father and
stepmother why he was terminated, his stepmother became concerned about his mental
health.  After  his stepmother  called  his employer  and  inquired  about  the  reason for his
termination,  she  notified
law-enforcement  authorities,  and  Applicant  was
involuntarily  hospitalized  for  four  or  five  days.  The  record  does  not  contain  any
documentary evidence of his diagnosis or treatment. He testified that hospital personnel
told him that he was hospitalized because he was delusional.  He testified that he was
given  a  medication  to  help  him  sleep  while  he  was  hospitalized  and  was  advised  to
continue using the medication after discharge. He did not continue taking the medication.
He did not receive any other treatment recommendations. (Tr. 28-32.)

Applicant  testified  that  some  of  his  coworkers  are  “home-grown  terrorists”  who
engage  in  organized  stalking.  (Tr.  45-46.)  He  believes  that  these  coworkers  were
surveilling him and using electronic technology to transmit sounds and thoughts into his
head. (Tr. 52.) He testified that he continues to be targeted daily. He has experienced
muscular  weakness  and  has  been  targeted  with  misinformation.  He  testified  that  “you
basically live almost like a slave inside the United States . . . for the duration of the time
that you’re sitting under the satellite.” (Tr. 64.)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  continued  to  tell  federal
agencies  and  members  of  the  intelligence  community  that  he  was  still  a federal agent
because  he  was  falsely  terminated  from  his  position.  He  stated  that  he  had  never
“brandished” his title after he was terminated. He testified that “technically” he was still a
federal agent because his termination was accomplished by a criminal act against him.

that  Applicant’s
In  March  2020,  DOD  CAF  referred  Applicant  to  a  licensed  psychologist  for
evaluation. The psychologist diagnosed Applicant with a “delusional disorder, persecutory
type.”  She  concluded
inpatient
hospitalization,  encounter  with  a  law-enforcement  agency,  and  lack  of  mental-health
treatment make it likely that additional lapses of judgment due to delusional thinking may
continue to occur. She also concluded that, because Applicant does not believe he has a
psychiatric  problem,  it  is  unlikely  that  he  will  voluntarily  seek  professional  help  in  the
future.  His  current  prognosis  is  “poor,”  and  she  believes  that  his  condition  poses  a
significant  risk  to  his  judgment  regarding  classified  information,  and  the  risk  of  future
mental health concerns is high without adequate psychiatric care. (GX 2 at 5-6.)
termination  of  employment,
The psychologist’s clinical observations noted that Applicant arrived early for his
evaluation,  was  alert,  and  fully  oriented.  His  attention  was  focused  and  normal.  His
comprehension  was  normal.  He  appeared  neat  and  clean.  He  displayed  no  unusual
mannerisms.  His  affect  was  appropriate  for  the  setting.  He  smiled  regularly  and  was
cooperative. (GX 2 at 4.)
The diagnostic criteria for a delusional disorder are described in DSM-5 as follows:
A.   The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month or
longer.
B.   Criteria A for schizophrenia has never been met. Note: Hallucinations, if
present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme (e.g.,
the sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of
infestation.)
C.  Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning
is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd.
D.  If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been
brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods.
E.   The  disturbance  is  not  attributable  to  the  physiological  effects  of  a
substance or another medical condition and is not better explained by
another  mental  disorder,  such  as  body  dysmorphic  disorder  or
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
The DSM-5 notes that the functional impairment of delusional disorder “is usually
more circumscribed than that seen with other psychotic disorders. It also notes that, “A
common characteristic of individuals with delusional disorder is the apparent normality of
their behavior and appearance when their delusional ideas are not being discussed or
acted on.”
Applicant’s  behavior  fits  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  a  persecutory  delusional
disorder. It is consistent with his apparently normal behavior most of the time, his lack of
disciplinary   action   during   his  military   service   and   his  civilian   employment,  and   his
demeanor during the  psychological evaluation and during the  hearing.

"Applicant  is  44  years  old.  He  is  unmarried  and  has  no  children.  He  has  a
bachelor’s degree.  He holds the position of Senior Systems Engineer II.  He is seeking
to retain his security clearance in connection with his employment.
Guideline  I  –  Psychological Conditions
The  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  is ineligible  for a  clearance  because  he
has certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions that can impair his judgment,
reliability and trustworthiness.
The SOR alleged that Applicant has been hospitalized on at least three separate
occasions  over  the  past  ten  years  for  symptoms  related  to  Bi-Polar  Disorder  II  and  I.
First,  in  August  2013;  second,  in  May  2019;  and  third,  sometime  after  his  previous
hospitalization, as the record contains no further detail.  In March 2021, Applicant was
evaluated  by  a  licensed  DoD-approved  psychologist,  at  which  time  it  was  determined
that  Applicant’s  mental  health  prognosis  was  poor,  and  that  his  psychiatric  disorder
could  contribute  to  impairment  in  judgment,  reliability  and  trustworthiness.  Applicant
admitted the  allegations  set forth  in the  SOR  under subparagraphs  1.a, 1.b.,  1.c., and
denied subparagraphs 1.d., and 1.e. with qualifications.  Applicant began working for his
current employer in July 2001.  He was granted a security clearance in June 2004.
1.a.    In   August  2013,  Applicant   voluntarily   admitted   himself   into   the   hospital  for
depression,  anxiety  and  suicidal  ideation.   He  reported  being  stressed  at  work, and  had
feelings of  being  stuck  in his position,  work,  and  personal life.  Medical records disclose
that he  felt hopeless and  worthless,  and  had  frequent passing  thoughts of doing  harm  to
himself like  using  a  knife,  or lying  in the  middle  of the  street,  or  jumping  off  of  a  building,
or driving  off  the  side  of  the  road, but he  would  push  them  out of  his mind  and  suppress
them.    He   also   had   problems  sleeping.     He   was  prescribed   different   medications,
including   Wellbutrin,   Depakote,   Klonopin,  and   Restoril  to   help   him   sleep.    He   spent
seven   days  in   the   hospital.     Following   this   hospitalization,   he   was  referred   to   an
Intensive  Outpatient Program  for his mental health  conditions, and  was diagnosed  with
Bi-polar Disorder II.   Sometime  in 2014,  Applicant  discontinued  all  of his outpatient care
services, including  therapy  and  medication,  against  medical advice.  He  perceived  that
he  was no  longer in need  of  treatment.   (Government Exhibits  3  and  4.)   He  stated  that
the  side  effects of  the  medication  caused  him  to  gain 70  pounds of  weight,  and  he  saw
little to  no change in his mood  or disposition.  (Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
1.b.   From  May  19,  2019,  through  June  5,  2019,  Applicant  was hospitalized for  episodes
of  paranoid  ideation  and  confusion.   Medical  records reveal that  Applicant was visiting
New   York  when   he   experienced   an  episode   of  paranoid  ideation   and   confusion.
Applicant  described  being  on  a  subway  platform  in  Times Square  when  a  young  woman
standing  with  her back  to  the  tracks, turning  in  his direction,  on  her phone  texting, was
looking  directly  at him.   She  continued  starring  at him, and  it  made  him  uncomfortable.
He moved  away  from  her,  but she  followed  him.  This same  situation  happened   again
with   a   second   girl.    Applicant  testified   that  he   thought  he   could   have   been   drugged,
without  knowing   it,  and   he  did not  feel safe.     He   wanted   to   get   to  the   Brooklyn   Bridge
but could not locate  it.   He wandered  the  streets  of  New  York for some  time  before he
came   across  a   couple   of   police   officers,   who   took   him   to   the   hospital.    Applicant  was
hospitalized   for  three   weeks  and   treated   for   Bi-Polar  II   Disorder.     Applicant’s   treating
psychiatrist  reported   that  Applicant  has  a   past  diagnosis  of   Bipolar  II   disorder,  and   is
recovering  from  an  episode  of  paranoid ideations and  some  other psychotic symptoms
after  being   stressed   at  work,   not  getting   adequate   amounts  of  sleep,   and   drinking
excessive   amount  of   caffeine.     Upon   his  release,   it  was  recommended   that   Applicant
see his mental health  provider  and  follow up  with his treatment.
1.c.   Not  long  after returning  to  his home  state, Applicant was hospitalized  again,  due  to
earlier patterns  of deterioration  in  functioning  associated  with  his  sleeplessness,  stress
and  guilt.   As a  result  of  this incident,  Applicant started  receiving  outpatient  psychiatric
and   psychotherapy   services.     There  is   no   further  information   about  this  hospital   stay.
(Government   Exhibit  3.)     Applicant  stated   that   he   needed   this   hospitalization   because
the   doctor  had   changed   his  medication,   which  exacerbated   his  sleeplessness,  stress,
and guilt  and  anxiety.  (Applicant’s Answer to  SOR.)
1.d.   Medical records reveal that in  or  around  2019,  Applicant’s  psychiatrist documented
Applicant’s   psychotic   experiences  included   paranoid  ideation,   including   the   feeling   of
being   watched,  and   that  Applicant  felt  he   was  on   “some   sort  of  mission”,  and   was
“hearing voices.”  (Government Exhibit 3.)  Applicant testified that this did occur while he
was  visiting   New   York.    He   felt  he   was  being   watched,  he   heard  voices  from   people
speaking   in   a   foreign   language,  he   was  scared,  and   on   a   mission   to   find   safety.
Applicant  stated   that  there  were  no   additional  paranoid  ideations  or  feelings  of   being
watched apart from this experience.   (Tr. pp.104-109.)
Applicant  stated  that  since  June  2019,  he  has  complied  with  and  followed
through with all of his recommended treatment and appointments that were laid out for
him by his providers.  He has also followed  the medication regime given  to him by his
physicians.  Applicant believes that his mental health has stabilized and has been on an
upward trend as of December 2020.  Applicant believes that much of his past problems
have  been  due  to  finding  the  right  combination  and  dosage  of  medication  to  be
effective.  Applicant has also been working with his clinical psychotherapist to learn how
to avoid stressors and other threats to his mental health and to proactively stabilize his
life and relationships.  (Tr. pp. 128-133.)
In November 2020, Applicant took vacation in response to stressors at work and
difficulty coping.  He then took an unpaid leave with permission of his department lead
who  agreed  that  he  should  take  time  away  from  work.  Applicant took  a  road  trip  and
stated that he felt that it helped him to heal his mind and body.
1.e.  In  March 2021, Applicant was evaluated  by  a  licensed  DoD approved  psychologist.
Her   written  report details the  psychological history  and   current mental health   condition
of  the  Applicant.  She stated  that during  her  evaluation of  the Applicant, he  reported that
his  prescribed   psychotherapy   is  infrequent  and   inconsistent,  and   that  his  therapy
services  entail   an   estimation   of   seeing   his  therapist  once   every   two   or  three   months.
She   determined   that  given   Applicant’s   recent  period   of   overwhelmed   and   heightened
anxiety, which necessitated  an  extended  vacation  to  regulate, Applicant  is likely  in need
more consistent psychotherapy services to ensure his stability.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
The  psychologist’s  evaluation  of
the  Applicant  further  indicates  that  for
psychotropic  medication,  Applicant  is  currently  being  prescribed  Lithium  and  Lamictal,
which  he  takes  twice  daily.  He  also  takes  Ativan  for  anxiety.  Applicant  is  currently
taking  this  medication  to  help  regulate  his  mood.  The  evaluation  also  indicates  that
Applicant’s psychotic symptoms are still present, but have been improving since he was
hospitalized at the hospital in New York and started on Haldol. She concluded that the
Applicant  continued  to  meet  the  criteria  for  Bipolar  II  Disorder,  with  anxious  distress,
and  with  mood-congruent  psychotic  features.  Due  to  irregular  engagement  in
psychotherapy,  propensity  to  be  overwhelmed  in  response  to  minor  stressors,  and
recent  decompensation
is
considered  to  be  poor.  She  believed  his  psychiatric  disorder  could  contribute  to
impairment in judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.  (Government Exhibit 3.)

Five  witnesses  testified  on  behalf  of  the  Applicant.  Four of  the  witnesses  were
friends,  professional  associates,  or  colleagues,  of  the  Applicant.  Each  of  these
individuals  find  the  Applicant  to  be  a  man  of  integrity  who  is  extremely  reliable  and
trustworthy.  They all recommend him for a security clearance.  (Tr. pp. 26-98.)
Medical  records  of  the   Applicant  reveal   that  in   2020,  he   was  diagnosed   with   a
number  of  mental  health   issues.    (Applicant’s  Exhibit  C.)    Applicant’s   psychiatrist
testified   and   explained   Applicant’s  Bi-Polar  mental  disorder  as  being   one   of   the   major
disorders  in  mental  health.     (Tr.   pp.  50-76.)    He   testified   from   Applicant’s  medical
records that  on  January  2, 2020, Applicant was diagnosed  with  Bi-Polar Disorder II,  in
partial remission.   On  March 3,  2020,  Applicant was  diagnosed  with  Bi-Polar  Disorder I,
depressed  episodes, in partial remission.   The  psychiatrist remembers a  discussion  with
the   Applicant  about  his  concerns  with   the   side   effects  and   dosages   of   the   medication
and  Applicant’s gastro-intestinal symptoms he  suffered  from  taking  the  medication.  (Tr.
p. 59.)  Two  days before the  hearing, he  diagnosed  Applicant with  Bi-polar Disorder I,
depressed   episode,   in   full   remission.    (Tr.   p.  60.)    He   further   testified   that  he   does
believe   that  Applicant   has  a   condition   that   could  impair   his  judgment,   reliability,  or
trustworthiness.    (Tr.  pp.  62   and   63.)    If  not  controlled,   his  Bi-Polar  Condition   could
cause   problems.   (Tr.  P.  63.)    He   also   stated   that   Applicant   has had  no   symptoms  for
several  months.     (Tr.  p.  65.)    In   his  opinion,  if  Applicant  continues  his  treatment  and
compliance  with  prescribed  medications, as  well  as  support  through  family,  friends, and
professionals,  his diagnosis should remain stable.  (Tr. p. 66.)
A
letter  from  Applicant’s  most  recent  treating  psychotherapist,  who  is  a
psychologist,  (not  his  psychiatrist)  dated  July  13,  2022,  indicates  that  Applicant
contacted  him for psychotherapy  services  in  March  2022,  about  six  months  ago.  The
psychotherapist has seen the Applicant for more than three months in one-hour weekly
psychotherapy  sessions  since  March  2022.  In  his  opinion,  Applicant  has  for  decades
has  been  trying  to  find  adequate  ways  for  coping  with  a  severely  dysfunctional  family
system,  which  he  only  recently  started  to  manage  properly.  Based  upon  his  clinical
observation,  the  medication  that  Applicant  is  currently  taking  for  his  Bipolar  II  mood
disorder  is  totally  managing  his  condition.  However,  Applicant  must  regularly  and
consistently  take  this  medication.  In  his  opinion,  Applicant’s  prognosis  was  excellent,
and he has no concerns regarding any perceived concern that could impair  Applicant’s
judgment,  reliability,  or trustworthiness.  The  therapist  states  that  Applicant  is  a  highly
functional, holistically healthy, fully capable individual who can confidently carry on his
usual job demands, the way he faithfully has done for so many years.  He recommends
that Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information be continued.  (Applicant’s

"In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegation contained in SOR ¶ 1.a and denied
the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b. He admitted in part and denied in part the allegation in SOR
¶  2.a,  and  he  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.b.  His  admissions  are  accepted  as
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  53  years old.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  works  for  a  defense
contractor (DC) as a systems engineer. He started this position in June 2017. Prior to that
position, he worked for another defense contractor (UBT) from June 2014 to April 2017,
at which time he was fired. He obtained a secret security clearance in 2015. (Tr. 22-25;
GE 1; AE D) In July 2017, he submitted his pending SCA. (GE 1)
Applicant  married  his  wife  in  1999.  Applicant  described  their  marriage  as
contentious at times.  On  March  3,  2016, they became  embroiled in  a  serious physical
altercation, which resulted in his arrest for assault and domestic violence.  His wife filed
for divorce later in March 2016. The divorce was finalized in January 2017. They have
two sons, ages 20 and 18. (Tr. 22-23; AE J)
Psychological Conditions
In  accordance  with  his  divorce  attorney’s  recommendation,  on  April  11,  2016,
Applicant started counseling with Dr. B., a licensed psychologist. He told Dr. B. that he
was seeking treatment to address a recent incident that occurred between him and his
wife of 16 years. He explained that his wife has had uncontrolled spending problems over
the years, much of which occurred without his knowledge. On March 3, 2016, he made a
comment to his wife about her weight, and she then ran after him and hit him in the ear.
He then slapped her. When the police arrived and saw the red mark on her face, they
arrested him and took him to jail for two nights. He denied having any sadness or remorse
about  his  wife’s  filing  for  divorce.  He  wanted  to  know  if  he  had  an  anger  problem  or
whether his angry responses were reasonable given her spending problem. He admitted
that he made angry remarks to her and lost his temper, but denied that it was an ongoing
issue. He told Dr. B. that “when he has that reaction (rx) it is well justified.” (Tr. 27; GE 4)
Dr. B. preliminarily diagnosed Applicant with an adjustment disorder, unspecified;
and rule out impulse control disorder; need more information. She recommended that he
participate in psychotherapy once a week. Subsequently, Dr. B saw Applicant 13 times
for therapy between April 25 and December 5, 2016. (GE 4)
In October 2016, the court dismissed the charges of assault and domestic violence
based  on  Applicant’s current participation  in counseling. (GE 7) Applicant reported that
the judge recommended that he participate in an anger management course.  He declined
to do that because he felt the situation was not his fault. (GE 2 at 18)
On May 23, 2019, Applicant participated in a psychological evaluation requested
by  DOD  CAF  for  purposes  of  determining  his  security  eligibility.  Dr.  G.,  a  clinical
psychologist, performed the evaluation. Dr. G. interviewed Applicant, reviewed his 2017
SCA,  and  other  DOD  documents.  Applicant  completed  a  Personality  Assessment
Inventory (PAI), which is a psychological test used to measure a test taker’s attitude. (GE
3 at 5)
During the clinical interview  with Dr. G., Applicant discussed his 17-year marriage
and   his  wife’s  exorbitant  spending.  He  disclosed   that  he   went  to   jail  for  a   weekend
because  he   slapped  his wife   in  the  face.   He   said   they   had   a   large   argument  when  he
learned,  after  he was in an  automobile  accident,  that he  did not have insurance because
she  had  canceled  it. (GE  3  at 3) According  to  Applicant,  the  argument about insurance
arose on  March 2, 2016.  (GE 2 at 17)
In  response  to  Dr.  G.’s  inquiry  about  problems  with  prior  employers,  Applicant
disclosed  that  in  2004  he  was  fired  from  a  cellular  company  after  he  encountered  an
issue, which he tried to resolve with management, with whom he did not get along. He
said he had also left a nasty note on an employee’s car that was parked in a manner such
that he could not move his car in the parking lot. He mentioned that he ran into a problem
with  a  woman  who  was  critical  of  him  at  UBT,  and  was  probably  involved  with  his
termination from there. (Tr. 103, 81-82, GE 3 at 4) (The derogatory information about his
employment with the cellular company is not alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, it will not
be discussed in the analysis of disqualifying conditions, but may be analyzed under the
section of mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept.)
In discussing the results of the PAI, Dr. G. opined that Applicant’s defensive profile
suggests that he is unable to acknowledge common problems. “He shows difficulties in
the area of impulse control and behavior.” (GE 3 at 6) He also “shows an elevation in the
area of aggressive behaviors” and is “quick-tempered when frustrated or confronted.” (Id.)
In  the  Diagnostic Impression  and  Prognosis section  of  his report, Dr. G.  stated  that
Applicant  “presents   as  having   features  that  show   moderate   security   concerns.   His
presentation  suggests that he  does not respond  effectively  or appropriately  to  feedback
or appraisal of his work behaviors. He appears to  respond  with  rationalization.” (GE 3  at
7) He  diagnosed  Applicant  with  Personality  Disorder, unspecified, based  on  his “limited
insight into  behaviors, risk taking, rationalization  of behaviors and  externalization  of blame
as well  as other test results.” (Id).  Dr. G.  gave  Applicant a  “somewhat  guarded” prognosis.
(Id.)
On January 31, 2021, Applicant voluntarily participated in a second psychological
evaluation  with  Dr.  W.,  a  clinical  psychologist.  Dr.  W.  performed  a  clinical  interview,
reviewed  records,  including  Dr.  C.’s  evaluation,  and  had  Applicant  complete  the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF), which is
another form of psychological testing.
During the clinical interview, Applicant described his former wife’s secret spending
habits  and  stated  that  she  hid  about  “$250,000  from  me.”  (AE  M  at  3)  He  related  the
March 3, 2016  incident in which the  police  were  called  because  she  attacked  him  and
came  “at me with a knife,”   and he defended  “himself by  grabbing  her hands and  leaving
marks.”  (Id.)  The  police  put him  in jail for the  weekend, and  he  subsequently  did not have
access to  his children  for about  six  months.  The  charges were later dismissed. (Id.;  AE  M
at 5)  Dr. W.  said  the  MMPI-2-RF  suggested  that  at this time  Applicant had  an   “above-
average  level of  emotional adjustment  and  life  satisfaction.” (AE  M at 4)  There were no
elevations in  personality  scales associated with aggression. (Id.)
Dr.  W.   concluded   that  Applicant  currently   does  not  demonstrate   aggressive
threats.  “His personality   profile  indicates no  antisocial tendencies or proneness toward
acting-out  behaviorally.”  (AE   M   at  5)  He  stated   that  Applicant’s  primary   “defense
mechanisms  of   intellectualization   and   rationalization   seem  to   influence   his interactions
and  how  he  separates ideas.” (AE  M  at 6)  “Past negative  incidents with  employers appear
to   have   resulted   because   of   personality   idiosyncrasies  rather  than   illegal,  deceitful,  or
predetermined  malice.”  (AE  M  at 5)  He opined  that Applicant’s “profile  presents as having
low   security   concerns  as  he   appears  to   have   adapted   to   the   environment  since   the
previous assessment (2019) when  he  first came  to  the  attention  of  superiors.”  (AE  M  at
6)  Dr. W.  did not report a diagnosis.
Personal Conduct
(a) Termination from UBT
In  April  2017,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  a  position  with  UBT,  a  federal
contractor, for violating its rules and policies from 2016 to 2017. The company found that:
[Subject]  had  violated  several base  policies including  using  a  government
furnished   computer  for  personal   use   (emails,  dating   websites,   group
forums, and  comics). Along  with  this, the  customer reported  that the  subject
had  been  spending  extended  periods of time  making  personal phone  calls
discussing   personal  matters  including   his  divorce.   The   Subject   was  also
observed  to  be  viewing  inappropriate  material on  his  personal  phone. (GE
5)
Applicant  disclosed  his  termination  from  UBT  in  Section  13A-Employment
Activities of his July 2017 SCA. He stated that he was “fired over use of private cell phone
which somebody considered inappropriate.” (GE 2 at 14) He explained that:
I was going  through  a  divorce,  my  cell  phone  usage  was necessary  during
the   day   and   I  still   got  more  work  done   than   any   of   my   peers.  I  was  also
warned   for   having   a   game   screenshot   as   my   background,   but  plenty   of
government folks around  me  were gaming  far more than  I ever did and  far
more openly.
On January 30, 2018, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about the
above termination and other matters. The investigator  drafted a report of that interview
(ROI). DOHA subsequently sent Applicant a copy of the ROI and asked him to review it
and submit corrections. At the end of September 2019, Applicant returned his copy with
two pages of comments and notations next to certain paragraphs of the ROI. (GE 2)
During  his  investigative  interview,  Applicant  was  asked  questions  related  to  the
reasons why he was terminated from UBT. He said no one told him why he was fired, but
he  knew it  related  to  his  cell  phone  use  for  making  calls,  texting,  emailing  his  divorce
lawyer, and receiving texts and group messages from friends. (GE 2 at 8-9). He denied
that he had work performance issues at his job. (GE 2 at 11)
Applicant  admitted  to  the  investigator  that  he  used  his  government  phone  and
laptop for email and calls to his lawyer, and denied any other uses. (GE 2 at 9) Later in
the  interview,  he  admitted  that  he  used  his  government  laptop  for  reading  comics,
accessing hobby groups,  news  sites, and for personal matters. He said there  were  no
restrictions against doing that when he was on his break.  (GE 2 at 10)
When  asked  by  the  investigator  if  he  had  viewed  pornography  while  at  work,
Applicant initially failed to answer the question, but then stated that he did not deny it. He
had  viewed  it,  on  his cell  phone,  after  receiving  anonymous  texts  or  pranks  with  such
content  from  other  employees  and  women  he  was  dating.  He  said  examples  of  those
texts  included  videos,  links  to  websites,  or  phone  calls.  (GE  2  at  10)  He  did  not
intentionally show those materials to anyone else. Someone who intruded on his space
could have viewed them however. (GE 2 at 11)
Applicant told the investigator that he did not believe that his use of government
equipment for some of the purposes previously stated was prohibited, as long as it did
not  interfere  with  his  work.  He  was  aware  that  there  were  restrictions  on  viewing
pornographic  material  while  at  work.  He  stated  that  using  government  equipment  to
access pornographic websites would be wrong, and that he never did that. (GE 2 at 12)
In his annotations to a paragraph on GE 2 at 11, he denied that he ever engaged in sexual
misconduct at work. (GE 2 at 4)
Applicant testified that he used his work computer to check his personal emails, as
do other employees. He used it to read comics. He said employees were allowed to do
those activities before work and during their lunch. He denied that he used the computer
for dating websites. He said it would have been impossible because of the government’s
firewall.  (Tr.  47-51,  84-85)  On  a  few  occasions  while  at  work,  Applicant  viewed
pornographic material on his phone that was sent to him by friends and a few women he
was dating. Some of his work friends also sent him texts or videos. (Tr. 86-89)
On cross-examination, Department Counsel noted that the investigator reported
on page 11 of GE 2 that Applicant told him that he had used his cell phone to visit websites
that had pornographic content two or three times a day between April 2016 and March
2017,  while  at  work.  Department  Counsel  remarked  that  Applicant  did  not  make  any
corrections to that statement in the ROI. Applicant responded, stating that he must not
have read that statement correctly. (Tr. 93, 97; GE 2 at 11) He admitted that he visited
pornographic  websites  at  home,  but  denied  visiting  them  while  at  work.  However,  he
testified  that  if  he  did  view  such  content  at  work,  he  might  have  done  so  while  in  the
bathroom where he did not consider himself to be at work. (Tr. 90-91)
Applicant testified that when he was terminated in April 2017, he did not know the
reason  for  the  termination  other  than  his  cell  phone  usage.  He  did  not  receive  a
termination  letter.  (Tr.  46,  79,  82)  He  has  not  been  fired  from  an  employer  since  this
incident. (Tr. 53) He took a four-hour behavior modification course in January 2020, in
response to his termination. (Tr. 60; AE I)
(b) March 2016 Arrest for Misdemeanor Assault
During his January 2018 background investigation, Applicant discussed with the
investigator his marriage and 2016 arrest.  He told the investigator that on March 2, 2016,
he  was  in  an  automobile  accident  and  learned  that  he  did  not  have  auto  insurance
because his wife failed to renew it. He and his wife then became embroiled in a verbal
argument, as they were discussing the issue with their insurance agent. (GE 2 at 17)
On the following evening of March 3, 2016, Applicant confronted his wife about her
spending habits after reviewing their bank statements. This argument lead to a physical
altercation in which his wife punched him several times. He tried to hold her arms down,
and he slapped her twice. When the police arrived, they noticed that she had red marks
on her face and arm. His  wife pressed charges against him, and he was arrested and
charged with misdemeanor assault and domestic violence. (GE 2)
While  testifying,  Applicant  emphasized  that  the  argument  on  March  3,  2016,
started because he discovered that his wife had recently spent a lot of money and lied to
him about it. After he confronted her about the bills he found, the fight escalated to yelling
and hostility, including his commenting on her weight. At some point, she approached him
and he tried to disengage from her, but she ran after him and hit his ear. He said she was
pushing him into the kitchen where she grabbed a knife from the cutting block and started
to swing it at him. He grabbed her wrist hard and got the knife out of her hand. She then
came after him again, at which point he struck her. After she left the house, a neighbor
called the police. (Tr. 54-55, 68-74)
Department  Counsel  cross-examined  Applicant  about  the  fact  that  he  never
mentioned that his wife grabbed a knife during their physical altercation on March 3, 2016,
when he recounted the fight to Dr. B. in April 2016; when he spoke to the investigator in
January 2018; or during his evaluation with Dr. G. in January 2019. The first mention of
his wife holding a knife was during his interview with Dr. W. in January 2021. In response,
Applicant said he was sure he mentioned the knife whenever the issue came up, and was
certain he told the police. (Tr. 75) He appeared surprised by that inquiry.
Applicant said that his overall mood and mental health  have improved  since his
divorce became final in 2017. Both of his children live with him fulltime.  (Tr. 38-39) He
said his previous diagnosis of adjustment disorder was related to his divorce and loss of
children at the time he saw Dr. B. in April 2016. (Tr. 45) He has not been charged with
any crime since the domestic violence allegation. (Tr. 60) He maintains a relationship with
his former wife, who comes over to his house periodically. (Tr. 39)
Letters of Recommendation and Performance Evaluations
Applicant  submitted  a  letter  from  his  former  supervisor.  Mr.  H.  stated  Applicant
worked for him from 2012 through 2017. He was not at the office on the day Applicant
was  terminated.  He  was  aware  that  employees  use  their  cell  phones  at  work  and
government laptops for personal issues throughout the day. He never observed a problem
with Applicant while he worked for him. (AE E) Two authors complimented Applicant for
his volunteer work as a soccer coach and as a father. (AE E, AE O)
Applicant  submitted  his  Employment  Performance  Evaluations  for  2018,  2019,
2020, and 2021. They generally rated Applicant as a solid performer. (AE G, AE N)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He
admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 2.a, and 3.a in part and denied them in
part.  He  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 58-year-old aeronautical engineer employed by a defense contractor
since August 2004. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from May 1984 to October
2004,  retired  as  a  chief  petty  officer  (pay  grade  E-7),  and  received  an  honorable
discharge. He started working for his current employer while on terminal leave from the
Navy.  (Tr.  32.)  While  on  active  duty,  he  was  awarded  the  Navy  and  Marine  Corps
Commendation Medal twice, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal six times,
the Navy Good Conduct Medal five times, and various service awards. (AX E.) He held a
security clearance in the Navy and retained it as an employee of a defense contractor.
Applicant married in February 1988  and divorced in April 2012. He remarried in
July 2019. He has two adult children.
Applicant earned an associate’s degree from an online university in July 2005. (AX
D.)  He  attended  a  university  from  October  2007  to  March  2012  but  did  not  receive  a
degree. (GX 1 at 12.)
Applicant began consuming alcohol in high school. In March 1986, while he was
on  active  duty  in  the  Navy,  he  was  convicted  of  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI)  and
sentenced to probation for two years. (GX 1 at 30-31.) He was required to complete a six-
week  alcohol rehabilitation program. He  did not resume  consuming alcohol until 1993.
(Tr. 27-28.)
Applicant  testified that when  he  returned from a deployment to Iraq in  2003, he
was depressed and distant. He turned to alcohol in an unsuccessful attempt to escape
from his depression. He started seeing a counselor in 2005, because he was struggling
with his feelings about his role in the taking of lives. After a shore duty assignment, he
volunteered  to  deploy  again  with  his  old  unit. When  he  returned,  he  talked  to  his  wife
about his depression, and her response was, “Don’t expect me to feel sorry for you; you
volunteered for this.” (Tr. 30-31.) Between 2005 and 2010, he sometimes drank to excess,
and he believed he was an alcoholic. (Tr. 33.)
In May 2011, Applicant’s wife left him. He thought about suicide. When he told his
primary physician about his suicidal thoughts, his physician told him he needed treatment.
He completed a four-day inpatient program that he did not find helpful. His wife moved
back into the home for a few days and then left again. In June 2011, he overdosed on a
prescription  sleep  medication  combined  with  alcohol.  His  wife  found  him  unconscious
when she came to the house on the following morning, and she took him to a hospital.
Applicant  was  voluntarily  admitted  to  a  psychiatric  hospital  in  July  2011  for
psychiatric  stabilization.  He  was  discharged  a  week  later  and  diagnosed  with  a  major
depressive disorder, recurrent, and alcohol abuse. He was prescribed a drug to reduce
his craving for alcohol and a drug for his depression. His prognosis was “fair if compliant
with the medicine.” (GX 3 at 11.)
During 2011 and 2012, Applicant was drinking  one or two drinks in the evening
every day. His consumption on weekends was heavier. At the same time, he was taking
medications for depression, even though he was advised to not consume alcohol while
taking the antidepressants. (Tr. 35.) His depression and alcohol abuse worsened after his
divorce. (Tr. 21-22.) He saw a psychologist regularly until July 2012, when he moved to
another location. (Tr. 37-38.)
Applicant’s alcohol consumption increased to five or six drinks at day. (Tr. 41.) In
October  2015,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DWI.  (GX  1  at  28.)  He  reported  his
arrest  to  his employer, as  required.  (GX  2  at  6.)  His  case  was  referred  to  a  Veteran’s
Court, where he pleaded guilty. He was required to compete a nine-month program that
began in September 2016 and involved wearing an ankle monitor for alcohol, mentoring,
counseling, random urinalysis, and victim impact panels. He was required to attend the
program  for  three  additional  months  because  he  consumed  alcohol  once  during  the
program.  He  completed  the  program  in  May  2017.  (AX  J.)  After  he  completed  the
program, the charges against him were dismissed, and record of his arrest and conviction
was expunged. (GX 1 at 26 and 28; AX K; AX L; AX M.)
In  early  2017,  Applicant  went  to  his  employee  assistance  program  (EAP)  and
asked  for  help.  He  was  enrolled  in  an  inpatient  program  for  five  or  six  weeks  and
completed it in April 2017. (AX L.) In late 2017, he resumed his alcohol consumption. (Tr.
31.)
On  February  14,  2018,  Applicant  was  self-admitted  to  a  psychiatric  hospital  for
outpatient  treatment  after  he  developed  suicidal  ideation  while  intoxicated.  He  was
diagnosed with  a major depressive  disorder.  After two  days,  he was  discharged at his
request, because the treatment was not covered by his insurance. (GX 5; Tr. 52.)
On February 19, 2018, which would have been Applicant’s 30th  anniversary with
his ex-wife, he began feeling severely depressed. He told his son how he was feeling,
and his son took him to a hospital for outpatient treatment. He was discharged on March
9, 2018, at his request so that he could return to work. (GX 6.) He was advised to seek a
mental health professional and to stop consuming alcohol. (Tr. 55.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in August 2018, he told
the investigator that he and the woman who became his second wife both enjoyed going
to draft breweries on weekends, and he usually consumed about two beers at one of the
breweries. (GX 2 at 5; Tr. 56.) As they approached the date of their marriage, Applicant
increased his alcohol consumption due to the stress of merging households.
In  July  2019,  the  CAF  requested  that  Applicant  undergo  a  mental  health
evaluation.  He  was  evaluated  in  November  2019  by  a  licensed  psychologist.  He  was
diagnosed  with  a  major  depressive  disorder,  in  partial  remission,  and  an  alcohol  use
disorder,  moderate.  The  psychologist’s  diagnostic  impressions  included  the  following
comments:
Clinical interview, psychological testing, and  medical records converge  to
suggest  [Applicant]   experienced   intermittent  depressive   symptoms  for
approximately  17  years. At times, since  2011, these  symptoms have  been
coupled   with   suicidal  ideation   after  his  ex-wife   moved   out  of  their   home.
More severe depressive symptoms  apparently  tended  to  occur annually  in
February, the  date  of  his previous anniversary  with  his ex-wife. However,
he  denies experiencing  any  significant symptoms of  anxiety  or depression
at  the   present  time.   His  psychological  testing   does   not  indicate   any
significant  distress.   His  mental  health   symptoms  appear  to   be   managed
presently  with  [a  prescription  drug], and  he  has apparently  gained  insight
and   coping   skills  through   therapy.  Any   depressive   symptoms  he   may   be
experiencing   presently   do   not   appear  to   be   significantly   impacting   his
occupational or social functioning.
The psychologist stated, however, that Applicant’s decision to consume beer gave
her pause, “given his history of alcohol abuse in conjunction with his previous treatment
provider’s recommendation of abstinence.” (GX 7 at 6.)  She concluded that Applicant’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are impaired, “as evidenced by his decision to
continue   to   consume   alcohol  on   a   weekly   basis,  despite   historically   experiencing
significant  consequences  as  a   result  of  his  alcohol  use,  and   in   contradiction   to   his
treatment  provider’s  recommendations.”  The   psychologist’s  prognosis  was  “fair.”  She
commented  that if  Applicant “could provide  information  from  a  mental health  practitioner
familiar with  his history of alcohol  use  disorder and  related  treatment  which indicates  his
alcohol  consumption   falls  within  their   recommended   levels,  this   could  improve   his
prognosis as well. . . .” (GX 7 at  6.)
On December 7, 2020, Applicant was evaluated by a another medical professional
who is a licensed clinical social worker, certified substance abuse counselor, and licensed
substance abuse professional. Her evaluation states:
The   results  of   standardized   testing   revealed   the   client   to   have   a   low
probability  of  an  alcohol use  disorder. The  client has no  problematic use,
nor is there  a  pattern to  the  use. There  are  no  clinical  effects,  and  there is
no  interference  in  the  patient’s life.  The  client has  ceased  all  consumption
of alcohol.
This evaluator determined that Applicant has no alcohol use disorder and that no
treatment is warranted. (AX R.) Although Department Counsel objected to consideration
of her evaluation on the ground that she was not qualified to make it, I am satisfied that
her credentials are sufficient to warrant consideration of her evaluation, although she may
have  exceeded  the  limits  of  her  qualifications  by  expressing  opinions  about  the
applicability of the adjudicative guidelines.
In  late  December  2020,  Applicant  completed  an  online  four-hour  behavior
modification course and an online four-hour drug and alcohol awareness course. (AX P;
AX Q.) In June 2022, he took a PETH test to determine the presence of alcohol in his
blood, and it was negative. (AX R.)
Applicant suffered a stroke on February 12, 2022, which he believes was due in
part  to  his  alcohol  abuse,  failure  to  control  his  diabetes,  and  hypertension.  Since  his
stroke,  he  has  changed  his  dietary  and  exercise  habits,  takes  his  medicines  as
prescribed, and has not consumed alcohol. (Tr. 21-24.) He testified that his primary care
physician  since  the  summer  of  2013  had  warned  him  that  he  had  two  choices:  “stop
drinking and live or keep drinking and die.” When Applicant saw his primary care physician
after the stroke, she told him, “I told you so, and I’m only going to say that once.” (Tr. 59.
At the hearing, Applicant testified that his last drink was on February 11, 2022, the
night before his stroke. He did not describe the circumstances of his alcohol consumption
on that date. (Tr. 66.) His vision and hearing were still impaired by the consequences of
the stoke.
Applicant has started seeing a new counselor. He has changed his diet, started
exercising, and consistently takes his medications. He tried Alcoholics Anonymous in the
past and found that it did not help him. To the contrary, he left the AA meetings wanting
to drink more than when he walked into the meeting. (Tr. 71.) He has two close friends,
one  of  whom  is  a  recovering  alcoholic  and  the  other  recovering  from  addiction  to
methamphetamine,  who  have  helped  him.  (Tr.  67-68.)  Applicant’s  wife  continues  to
consume alcohol, and they keep it in their home, but he testified that he is not tempted
by it. He testified that the thought of how close he came to death during his stroke is with
him every day. He believes that every alcoholic has “a bottom,” and he hit bottom when
he had a stroke. (Tr. 71-72.).
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he submitted a sworn statement declaring his
intent to not use alcohol in the future. He agreed that any future involvement in alcohol
use may be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (AX O.)
Applicant’s immediate supervisor submitted a letter supporting reinstatement of his
security clearance. His supervisor has worked with him for 15 years and is familiar with
his struggles with  depression  and  alcohol abuse.  He states that  Applicant  “has  earned
the respect of his work community, especially the pilot community, due to his honesty,
accountability, and integrity.” Applicant is regularly requested by name for tasks requiring
a  high  degree  of  trust.  The  supervisor  states,  “He  does  not  accept  failure  lightly,  and
works very hard to overcome failures at work and in his personal life.” (AX F at 1-2.)
Applicant’s  team  members  share  his  supervisor’s  high  regard  for  his  technical
skills, integrity, and honesty. (AX F at 3-31.) He has received numerous awards for his
achievements and technical skills. (AX G; AX H.)
Applicant’s performance evaluation for 2017 rated him as exceeding expectations
for technical execution and integrity and achieving expectations in all other performance
categories.  (AX  I  at  1-7.)  His  2018  performance  evaluation  rated  him  as  exceeding
expectations in all categories. (AX I at 8-14.) His performance evaluation for 2019 rated
him  as  exceeding expectations  in  performance  and achieving expectations  in  all other
categories. (AX I at 15-20.)

"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 2.a. He admits and
denies portions of SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e and 2.b. He denies SOR ¶ 3.a. His admissions are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1999. He is not married
and has no children. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since
2021. From 2012 to 2021, he was employed by a different federal contractor. He has held
a security clearance at various times during the past 22 years and uninterrupted for the
past ten years. (Transcript (Tr.) 27-30, GE 1)
Applicant acknowledged that he is a recovering alcoholic.  He began consuming
alcohol around age 14 and continued to January 2019. (SOR  ¶ 2.a) He has never had
any alcohol-related incidents away from work or at work. He has never been arrested or
charged  with  an  alcohol-related  offense.  He  has  never  been  disciplined  for  anything
alcohol-related. In the past, he had issues with his ability to sleep and that caused him to
be late for work on occasion. He testified these were not alcohol-related. (Tr. 30-35)
Applicant acknowledged  that in 2012  he  was using  alcohol excessively. In  2013,
on his own accord, he  admitted  himself to a  5-day inpatient detoxification program  (SOR
¶  1.a). He explained  that at that time, he  loosely  had  a  plan  that he  would abstain  from
drinking  for a  while, but he  did  not  plan  to  stop  drinking  alcohol  forever.  When  he  was
discharged  from  inpatient treatment,  he  was  diagnosed  with  anxiety  and  not otherwise
specified   alcohol  dependence.  For  the   next  two   and   half   years,  he   did  not  consume
alcohol.  He  then  began  drinking  and  gradually  increased  his  consumption.  (Tr.  32-33,  42-
45, 76-78; GE 3)
In 2017, Applicant realized he was drinking too much and again admitted himself
to a 5-day inpatient detoxification program to get help.  He was diagnosed with  anxiety
disorder, mood disorder, and alcohol dependence (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c). He acknowledged
his consumption level was not normal and was harmful. He was referred to a therapist
and a psychiatrist, who prescribed medication to help with anxiety associated with alcohol
withdrawal.  He  was  told  to  abstain  from  alcohol  consumption.  He was  told  to  take  the
medication as needed. Lethargy was a side effect of one of the medications. He credibly
testified that he told his psychiatrist that his anxiety was better, and she agreed he could
cease taking the medication. He credibly testified that he has always followed his doctors’
orders regarding taking prescribed  medications.  He  did  not  stop  taking the  medication
contrary to medical advice. He was taking medication to relieve the anxiety associated
with  withdrawal  symptoms  and  believed  he  was  to  take  the  drugs  “as  needed.”  He
disputes  he  was  noncompliant.  He  saw the psychiatrist for two  visits  and  the therapist
twice a month for six months. He testified that the medication he was prescribed was to
temporarily  treat  his  acute  anxiety.  When  the  anxiety  ceased,  he  no  longer  took  the
medication. I found Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 45-49, 78-85, 105-108; GE 4)
Applicant abstained from consuming alcohol for about six months until 2018 when
he resumed. Then he felt he was consuming too much alcohol and it was not normal. He
again  referred himself  for treatment as  an inpatient  in  a detoxification  program for five
days. (SOR ¶ 1.d) He had two visits with a psychiatrist and he did not recall if he saw a
therapist.  After  completing  the  program  in  the  latter  part  of  2018,  he  began  attending
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). (Tr. 49-51, 85-90; GE 5)
Applicant acknowledged that he has been repeatedly told to abstain from alcohol
consumption.  He  testified  that  his  family  and  friends  recommended  he  attend  AA.  He
credibly testified that AA was more helpful than therapy, which was general and focused
on trying to find an event that triggered his alcohol consumption. He was open to talking
with a therapist, but it was the different approach that AA offered that made a difference.
Being  with  a  group  of  people  with  similar  issues  who  could  relate  and  understand  his
challenges  was  instrumental  to  his  commitment  to  sobriety.  They  offered  him  different
approaches  to  staying  sober.  He  stated  that  after  attending  AA,  he  started  to  see  a
different aspect to his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 51-54, 103)
Applicant acknowledged that when he began participating in AA, he was ready to
make a lifelong commitment to abstaining from alcohol consumption. His attitude shifted.
Before, his commitment was to be sober for a period-of-time, but not forever. Since he
began attending AA, his commitment  is for life.  He testified that  his  date  of  sobriety is
January 25, 2019. He credibly testified that he has not consumed any alcohol since then.
He provided photos of his sobriety chips, which included his three-year chip  and other
milestone chips. (Tr. 51-55, 59-60; AE D)
Applicant  attends  AA  meetings  weekly.  He  has  a  sponsor  with  whom he  meets
regularly and who guides him through the 12-step program and the “Big Book,” which is
the handbook for AA. His sponsor has moved and no longer attends the same meeting,
but  is  geographically close  so  Applicant  and he  meet  outside  of  the  AA  meetings  and
discuss  how to proceed  with  his sobriety.  Applicant provided  copies  of  the attendance
logs for his meetings since September 2020. He testified he attended weekly meetings
before then. Applicant has also taken on a leadership role in the meetings by being the
chairperson. He testified that the last three steps of the 12-step program are ones that
are worked on in perpetuity. He detailed each step. The last step is to spread the message
to others and be a sponsor. He has reached out to be a sponsor to a person and is waiting
for this person to respond. He goes to his AA meetings early to help setup and brings
refreshments. He also will mentor new participants to the group. (Tr.53-62; AE C)
Applicant testified that he no longer suffers from anxiety. His previous anxiety was
associated with his alcohol withdrawal. He does not take medication for anxiety and no
one has suggested he seek treatment for any disorder. He has adopted a healthy lifestyle
by going to the gym five days a week. He provided a copy of the attendance log from his
gym. (Tr. 40-41, 62-65 100-101; AE F)
Applicant acknowledged that in the past he was embarrassed about his alcohol
use. Now he does not have difficulty talking about it. Part of AA is to accept his condition
and freely discuss his experience and abuse of alcohol. (Tr. 65-66, 102-103)
In January 2021 Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist and
board certified neuropsychologist (LP), requested and approved by the government. She
administered psychological tests. She diagnosed him with alcohol abuse disorder, severe
in  current  remission  and  unspecified  anxiety  disorder.  She  opined  that  Applicant’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness could be compromised based on his conditions.
She  noted  that  Applicant  lacked  candor  during  his  interview,  which  suggested
guardedness  and  possibly  poor  insight  into  his  conditions.  She  opined  that  his
psychological profile suggested that he was not open to treatment, which increased the
likelihood of relapse. Therefore, her prognosis was guarded. (SOR ¶ 1.e). (GE 2)
Applicant provided context about his interview with LP. He explained that LP took
issue with the amount and frequency of his alcohol use. He explained to her it was difficult
to explain how much alcohol he consumed at different times because the amount and
frequency varied and it was difficult to quantify. He believed he was open and honest with
her. He believed that she thought he was being inconsistent because of his answer. He
also believed that he no longer suffered from an anxiety disorder, which was associated
with his alcohol abuse. (Tr. 66-67)
Applicant  was  evaluated  by  Dr.  W  who  has  a  Ph.D.  in  psychology  and  has
practiced in the field since 1976 and as a forensic and clinical psychologist since 1993.
He  is  a  Fellow  of  the  American  Psychological  Association.  He  is  licensed  in  several
jurisdictions and has been qualified as an expert witness in different disciplines. He has
an  extensive  curriculum  vitae,  which  includes  numerous  articles  he  authored  for
professional publications and presentations. He is an expert in his field. (Tr. 111; AE H)
Dr.  W.   evaluated   Applicant  in  November  2021   with   the   understanding   that   his
evaluation  would be objective. He noted  LP’s diagnosis  was that Applicant  was at  risk of
relapse   for  his   prior  alcohol  use   disorder,   especially   because   he   suffers  from   anxiety,
which LP  believed  could  lead  to  alcohol relapse. Dr. W.  diagnosed  Applicant  with  Alcohol
Use Disorder, severe, in sustained  remission. His prognosis was good. (Tr. 111-112; GE
2; AE G)
Dr. W reported that Applicant advised him that he occasionally experiences some
degree  of  anxiety,  but  he  does  not  think  of  alcohol  as  a  needed  solution.  Applicant
explained that alcohol was something he formerly used to help with insomnia, but he has
maintained a consistent sleep schedule for the past three years, which has eliminated his
insomnia  and  need  for  alcohol.  Dr.  W  conducted  psychological  tests,  which  were
significant in that they indicated that Applicant made no effort to minimize his mental or
emotional problems and that he completed the test honestly and accurately, which is an
indication of overall honesty on the part of Applicant. (AE G)
Dr.  W  reviewed  the  known  and  reported  history,  psychological  testing,  clinical
interview and mental status examination of Applicant. He determined that Applicant had
a  history  of  alcohol  abuse  and  dependence  and  that  he  had  to  undergo  detoxification
three times. Dr. W noted that “In Sustained Remission,” indicates that the individual has
not met the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder in at least 12 months. In Applicant’s case, he
reported that he has abstained for over three years. Dr. W noted:
Abstinence  is not required  for an  individual to  be  considered  In  Sustained
Remission.  All  that is  required  is for the  individual not  to  have  met  the  criteria
for the  Alcohol Use Disorder Diagnosis during  a  12-month  period. However,
for members of  [AA] to  be  considered  sober and  compliant with  the  program
of AA, they are required to  be continually abstinent. (AE G)
Dr. W  noted  inconsistencies in LP’s report. LP  first determined  that  Applicant did
not suffer from a  mood disorder, but then stated that he had “minimal effective treatment
for Alcohol Use Disorder nor his mood  disorder.”  (GE 2  at page  5). LP’s report references
no  mood  disorder other than  Bipolar Disorder,  which LP  indicated  Applicant did not suffer
from. Dr. W  noted  that  LP  concurrently  stated  that Applicant does and  does not suffer
from  a  mood  disorder. Dr. W  agreed  with  LP’s conclusion  that there  was no  evidence  of
Bipolar Disorder and  he  did  not  see  any  evidence  of any  other mood  disorder.  (Tr.  112-
115, 121-122; AE G)
Dr. W noted that LP asserted that Applicant had minimal effective treatment for his
alcohol use disorder. Dr. W emphatically disagreed with this, as Applicant has participated
in AA, which in his opinion is the “most effective and widespread treatment for [Alcohol
Use Disorder] in existence.” (Tr. 112-115; AE G)
Dr. W noted that LP opined that Applicant was not fully candid in his interview. Dr.
W found the opposite and noted that Applicant revealed information that was not flattering
and went far beyond the questions posed to him. He noted that LP’s administration of a
psychological test was valid and indicated that Applicant was honest, which implies that
he was inclined to be honest throughout his assessment with LP. (Tr. 115-118; AE G)
Dr. W’s conclusions are that Applicant has suffered from alcohol problems during
his adult life. He chose to discontinue alcohol use twice without obtaining the necessary
follow-up intervention for his addictive behavior. On this third attempt, he followed up with
the medical detoxification program with an acceptance of the AA program. Applicant has
fully accepted the full scope of the AA program. He does more than just document  his
attendance. He has a sponsor, has completed the 12-step program, and has volunteered
his service for the program. This indicates Applicant accepts his need for sobriety and is
not merely going through the motions to placate an outside authority. (Tr. 112-117; AE G)
Dr. W  noted  that   Applicant’s alcohol problem   is familiar in that many   individuals
with  alcohol problems repeatedly  deny  the  seriousness and  repeatedly  tell  themselves
they   can   manage   the   problem   on   their   own   without   a   treatment   program.   Applicant
believed  this  on  two  occasions following  his medical detoxification. He ultimately  arrived
at the  conclusion  that he  needed  help to  stay  sober,  and  he  could  not resolve  the  problem
on  his own  using  will  power  alone. Dr. W  noted  that in AA, the  final realization  that an
individual has an  alcohol problem  and  needs outside  help  occurs when  the  individual hits
“rock bottom.” In  Applicant’s case,  hitting  rock bottom  took the  form  of  his realization  that
he  was powerless over alcohol and  that every  medical detoxification  was just  going  to
lead to another medical detoxification  unless  he got help for his addiction. Dr. W  stated:
It  should be  noted  that  [Applicant]  has attained  his current stability  through
his  participation   in   AA.  Every   professional   alcohol  treatment  program,
whether residential or outpatient,  always concludes treatment with  a  referral
of  patients to  AA  for long  term, continuous follow  up. Although  [Applicant]
did not participate  in  a  residential  alcohol treatment program, his final step
towards recovery  by  attending  and  participating  in the  program  of  AA  fits
the  pattern of those  who  successfully  recover from  alcohol use  disorders.
(AE G)
Dr. W concluded in his report the following:
[Applicant]   is approaching   three   years of   sobriety   and   participation   in  the
program   of  AA.   To   a   great  degree   of  psychological  certainty,  I  consider
[Applicant]  to  be  fit to  continue  to  hold a  security  clearance  and  to  be  free
from  his former alcohol problem. (AE G)
Dr. W  testified  at Applicant’s hearing  and  reiterated  his prognosis and  conclusions.
He stated  that Applicant’s full  participation  in AA  is the  strongest predictor of  whether he
will  relapse. He noted  that LP  stated  that Applicant lacked  insight into  the  severity  of  his
condition. Dr. W  disagreed  stating,  if  that were  the  case, Applicant  would not be  attending
AA, have  a  sponsor, or continue  to  work the  12-step  program. LP  found  that  Applicant
had  an  unspecified  anxiety  disorder. Dr. W  found  that Applicant did  not have  an  anxiety
disorder;  rather his  past reflected  that  when he had  anxiety  he  turned to  alcohol. Anxiety
is a  contributing  factor with  anyone  who  abuses alcohol. People find  alcohol  diminishes
the   anxiety.  Applicant’s  participation   in AA   helps  him   handle  anxiety   and   gives  him   an
alternative approach. (Tr. 112-113, 121-128)
Applicant took two PETH tests to detect for alcohol consumption. Dr. W testified
that  PETH  is  a  test  that  is  required  by  many  professional  organizations  in  order  for  a
member to regain a professional license after having an alcohol-related incident. It is not
a conventional blood alcohol test, but one that looks for a metabolite for alcohol and it can
detect if a person had consumed any alcohol in the past month. Applicant took the tests
on September 2nd and 26th, 2022, and tested negative for alcohol on both. (Tr. 62-63;
118-121; AE E)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  falsified  material  facts  on  his  December  2017
security  clearance  application  (SCA).  Section  24  asked  if  he  sought  counseling  or
treatment  as  a  result  of  his  alcohol  use.  He  answered  “yes”  and  disclosed  his  2017
inpatient  treatment,  but  did  not  disclose  he  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  in  2013  for
complaints of anxiety and heavy drinking. (GE 1)
Applicant testified that he approached his 2013 detoxification as merely taking a
break from using alcohol. He explained that he rushed through the SCA and focused on
his  2017  treatment.  He  said  that  he  did  not  deliberately  attempt  to  deceive  the
government. Applicant said that in hindsight and now as a recovering alcohol, he would
consider his 2013 treatment as a significant event, but when he completed his 2017 SCA,
he did not focus on that event. He realized his error when it was brought to his attention
by the government investigator during a background interview in 2018. Applicant admitted
that his past alcohol abuse embarrassed him. Now that he has been an active member
in AA, he is no longer feels inhibited about discussing his past issues with alcohol. (Tr.
67-75, 90-98)
Applicant’s  AA  sponsor  (TH)  provided  a  letter  on  his  behalf.  He  met  Applicant
almost four years ago when Applicant began attending weekly AA meetings. It became
clear to TH that Applicant was serious about his sobriety and learning the AA program.
TH offered to guide him through the steps and work the program with him. TH stated that
Applicant was willing to do the work. They worked together after weekly meetings and
weekend  mornings.  They  completed  the  action  steps  of  the  program,  and  Applicant
continues  to  work the steps  that  require  ongoing efforts (Step 10  through  12). He  and
Applicant communicate regularly. TH stated: “Due to [Applicant’s] step work, consistent
meeting  attendance,  willingness,  and  honesty,  I  believe  [Applicant]  is  recovered  as
defined by the Big Book.” (AE I)
Applicant provided a character letter from JA. They have been friends for 35 years.
Applicant and JA were college roommates, and Applicant was in his wedding. JA is aware
of Applicant’s past struggles with alcohol and the SOR allegations. JA lived with Applicant
from  December  2020  to  March  2021.  He  stated  that  Applicant  did  not  consume  any
alcohol when they lived together. He described Applicant as a caring, giving, and honest
person.  Applicant  sticks  to  his  schedule  and  leads  a  healthy  lifestyle.  JA  believes
Applicant  did  the  right  thing  by  seeking  help  when  he  needed  it  and  noted  he  was
successful, which is the goal of treatment. He believes Applicant has overcome his past
issues. He described Applicant has an amazing man, friend, and a patriot. (AE A)
Applicant provided a character letter from JH, who has known him for 19 years. JH
has been Applicant’s direct and indirect supervisor, and they have shared an office. He
considers Applicant a responsible, honest, and reliable person. He is a professional and
works well with his customers. He completes his assignments in a timely manner. When
Applicant recognized he had a problem with alcohol, he sought help and there were never
any negative implications regarding his work. JH noted that Applicant has demonstrated
a  commitment  to  his  recovery  and  remaining  sober.  Applicant  reached  out  to  his
supervisors candidly explaining his struggles. JH believes Applicant can be trusted to hold
a security clearance. (Tr. 37-39; AE B)
Applicant provided a copy of his current performance evaluation from his employer.
He received marks of “meets expectations” and “exceeds expectations.” (Tr. 39-40; AE

Applicant  received  treatment  at  a  military  medical  center,  including  hospitalization  in
December 2015. SOR ¶ 1.e alleges and Applicant admitted from May 2016 to January
2017, he received treatment at a civilian medical care provider. (Tr1. 124; HE 2, HE 3)
He said he was unaware that he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, social
anxiety disorder, schizotypal personal disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. (HE 2,
HE 3)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  in  December  2020,  a  licensed
psychologist evaluated him. (HE 2; HE 3) He said he was unaware of the psychologist’s
diagnosis  of  major  depressive  disorder,  unspecified  anxiety  disorder,  and  schizotypal
personality  disorder.  (HE  3)  The  psychologist  concluded  his  condition  may  impair  his
judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. (HE 2)
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  software  engineer  who  worked  for  a  DOD  contractor
initially in 2019 as an intern. (Tr1. 54, 74) He worked full time for the DOD contractor since
August 2020. (Tr1. 86) He has never married, and he does not have children. (Tr1. 138)
Applicant described his own personality as “highly introverted.” (Tr1. 137)
When  Applicant  was  a  teenager,  he  participated  in  4H.  He  achieved  a  second-
degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do (Korean karate). (Tr1. 56) In 2008, he was awarded a
bachelor’s degree in business administration. (Tr1. 56, 79) While he was in college, he
put cigarettes out on his hand three or four times to show how tough he was. (Tr1. 90-91)
After graduating from college with a 4.0 grade point average, he was unemployed from
May of 2008 to September 2010. (Tr1. 79) From 2010 to 2012, a store employed him as
a security guard for about 30 months. (Tr1. 57, 70, 79-80; GE 1) Applicant described two
physical  altercations  he  had  with  a  female  employee.  In  the  first  one,  he  was  injured;
however, he did not report her for shoving him. In the second altercation, she pushed him
first, and he pushed her back. (Tr1. 58) His employer fired him for engaging in a physical
altercation with her. (Tr1. 57-59) On his February 12, 2019 SCA, he said he was fired for
a “verbal dispute” with a coworker. (GE 1 at 17) The woman in the altercation was taller
and heavier than Applicant. (Tr1. 59-60) He was unemployed from May 2012 to July 2014.
(Tr1. 83)
Applicant has numerous relatives who were veterans of the U.S. military. (Tr1. 61)
In 2014, he joined the Army when he was 30 years old. (Tr1. 60-61) In basic training, he
had  suicidal  thoughts,  felt  depressed,  and  had  panic  attacks.  (Tr1.  93-94)  In  basic
training, he was awarded the expert marksman badge, and he was promoted to specialist
(E-4) because he had a bachelor’s degree. (Tr1. 62, 92) At his personal appearance, he
denied that he cut himself or did anything to hurt himself while he was in basic training.
(Tr1. 94, 96) However, his medical records reflect that he began cutting himself while he
was in basic training. (GE 5 at 114) Applicant said the person who made the comment in
his  medical  records  about  him  cutting  himself  may  have  misinterpreted  something  he
said. (Tr1. 96)
After basic training, Applicant went to Officers Candidate School (OCS). (Tr1. 62)
OCS  was  stressful for him, and he had suicidal ideations, panic attacks, and probably
depression. (Tr1. 63, 97) He disclosed the suicidal ideations to student leadership; they
took him to the duty officer; and then he went to the hospital. (Tr1. 64, 97-98) He was
under observation at the hospital for an hour or two, and then he was sent back to OCS.
(Tr1. 64) The next morning, he was terminated from OCS. (Tr1. 64) He remained in a
holding  company  after  being  discharged  from  the  OCS  course.  (Tr1.  65)  He  initially
refused antidepressants because he was worried that they would increase his suicidal
ideations.  (Tr1.  64)  Later  he  tried  several  medications  to  treat  anxiety.  (Tr1.  98)  One
medication was changed because he had nightmares. (Tr1. 65)
Applicant was transferred from his OCS installation to an installation in the United
States  for  advanced  individual  training  (AIT),  where  he  was  trained  to  be  a  chaplain’s
assistant. (Tr1. 99) While in AIT, he finished his anxiety medication, and he did not seek
a refill of his anxiety medication. (Tr1. 101) In AIT, he had suicidal ideations, anxiety, and
depression.  (Tr1.  99)  As  for  his  method  of  committing  suicide,  he  considered  using  a
Gerber knife to cut his femoral or brachial arteries. (Tr1. 142)
In January or February 2015, Applicant went to his first non-training assignment,
which  was  at  an  installation  in  the  United  States.  (Tr1.  102)  Early  in  2015,  he  sought
mental-health treatment for suicidal ideations, anxiety, and depression. (Tr1. 102) He had
difficulties with stress caused by being on an Army installation. (Tr1. 102) He felt anxiety
when  he  was  responsible  for  making  arrangements  for  events  such  as  meetings  and
prayer luncheons. (Tr1. 107) He felt anxiety most days, and sometimes he experienced
spikes of anxiety throughout the day. (Tr1. 107) The anxiety spikes would last from a few
minutes to more than an hour, and he felt squeezing in his chest and brain, an increased
heart rate, jitteriness, and occasionally he bit the inside of his cheek. (Tr1. 108) He was
prescribed Paxil, Buspar, Abilify, and propranolol. (Tr1. 102-103, 109) He took all of these
medications every day. (Tr1. 109)
In 2015, Applicant was superficially cutting his chest and his back with his Gerber
knife,  and  he  had  audio  and  visual  hallucinations  (AVH).  (Tr1.  103-106,  143)  In
September 2015, a noncommissioned officer observed the cuts on his back, and he took
Applicant to the emergency room.  (Tr1. 111, 113) The emergency room examined the
cuts and released him. (Tr1. 113) He did not receive stiches. (Tr1. 113) He was unsure
why  he  cut  himself;  however,  he  suggested  the  cuttings  could  be  a  side  effect  from
medications  or  possibly  situational.  (Tr1.  104-105)  It  could  also  have  been  because
cutting himself was something he could control, or perhaps he was replacing emotional
pain with physical pain. (Tr1. 105)
Applicant’s visual hallucinations were of the pony character from a cartoon called
My Little Pony, and the pony’s name was Rainbow Dash. (Tr1. 109) He told his providers
that the Rainbow Dash image was soothing. (Tr1. 110) Sometimes Rainbow Dash would
talk to him. (Tr1. 110) In July 2015, he had a “distressing” vision of the face of the Joker
from  Batman  coming  at  him.  (Tr1.  110)  Applicant’s  medical  records  indicate  on
September 11, 2015, Applicant forgot to take his Paxil and Buspar, and he had “paranoid
delusions  about  bombs  being  planted  in  trailers.”  (Tr1.  114-115;  GE  5  at  14)  At  his
hearing,  Applicant   denied   having   a   memory   about   bombs   in   a   trailer.  (Tr1.  115)   He
remembered  a  vision  of a  lion  biting  his head,  and  he  heard a  voice from  the  Spiderman
2  movie,  which said “they  hate  you, you  should die,  they  will be  better off  without you.”
(Tr1.  116)  Applicant   found   this  voice  to   be   “disconcerting,”  and   he   felt  an   urge   to   kill
himself. (Tr1. 116-117)  He took his Buspar, and  he  was able to  calm  down  and  sleep  that
night despite  the  AVH. (Tr1. 117)
On December 22, 2015, Applicant saw a man with a woman he liked. (Tr1 117) He
felt  suicidal,  and  he  had  a  friend  take  him  to  the  emergency  room.  (Tr1.  117)  In  his
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  medical  records,  he  said,  “‘I  was  seeing  rainbow
dash and heard voice at that time, had plan to use a knife to cut wrist or brachial arteries.’”
The  records  note  a  “[diagnosis  including]  schizotypal  personality  disorder  and  social
anxiety.” (GE 6  at 23) Applicant was an inpatient for a week in a military mental health
facility following his visit to the emergency room. (Tr1. 119)
On  December  29,  2015,  the  Army’s  primary  diagnoses  were  Anxiety  Disorder
unspecified, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder. (GE 5 at 115)
The December 29, 2015 note states:
SM  endorses  AVH 2-3  times a  week. SM  elaborates  that  he  often  sees a
character  from   a   popular  children’s  animated   TV   show,  and   says  the
character is benign  and  gives him  encouragement and  positive  feedback.
SM   acknowledges  this  character  is  not  real,   and   adds  that  it  sometimes
worries  him   that  he   is  seeing   and   hearing   it.  SM   denies   command
encouraging   him   to   self-harm,  but  recounts  an   instance   when   he   did  not
take  his medication  and  experienced  AVH which  were “scary, and  told me
to  do  bad  stuff”. . . SM  endorses self-harm  behavior, and  elaborates he  cuts
himself  superficially  on  the  chest back about once  a  week using  a  Gerber
tool.  SM  says his cutting  gives him  a  sense  of  release  and  that he  began
cutting during basic training. (GE 5  at 114)
On January 26, 2016, Applicant completed a checklist and indicated he had special
powers. (GE 5 at 69-70) At his hearing, he said he could not remember anything about
the special powers. (Tr1. 122-123) In April 2016, he was administratively discharged from
the Army. (Tr1. 66, 84) He could not remember the specific reason for the administrative
discharge; however, it could have been for a personality disorder. (Tr1. 141) When he left
the Army, he was taking Paxil, Buspar, Abilify, and propranolol. (Tr1. 123) He continued
to take these four medication for several months after being discharged from the Army.
(Tr1. 124) He did not receive a medical discharge or medical retirement from the Army,
and he is not receiving VA disability pay. (Tr1. 123) After he left the Army, the AVH ended.
(Tr1. 123)
After leaving the Army, Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in computer science
with a 3.9 grade point average, which he received in May 2020. (Tr1. 69-70, 84-85) He
received mental-health counseling from the VA. (Tr1. 67) The VA gradually reduced his
medications,  and  he  said  the  hallucinations  decreased.  (Tr1.  67)  In  2017,  the  AVH
stopped. (Tr1. 68, 134)
At his hearing, Applicant denied that he ever cut his wrist. (Tr1. 111-112) On May
9, 2016, Applicant told a VA psychiatrist that he showed a suicidal ideation and cut his
wrist in July 2015. (GE 6 at 23) The VA psychiatrist’s note  quotes Applicant as stating
“Because  of  too  much  stress  from  training  and  loneliness,  I  cried,  was  feeling  kind  of
helpless, did a superficial wrist cut, then received a mental health assessment. The doctor
thought I was making it up. He didn’t give me medication.” (Tr1. 112; GE 6 at 22)
On May 9, 2016, Applicant had a VA appointment, and he said he was taking Paxil,
Buspar, Abilify, and propranolol. (GE 6 at 22) Applicant said he was stable and did not
have AVH. (Id.) At that time, his VA diagnosis was: Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent,
unspecified; Anxiety Disorder, unspecified; rule out personality disorder. (Id. at 25)
Applicant’s last visit with a VA psychiatrist was on January 31, 2017, and at that
time, he had NOT taken his medications for more than two months. (Tr1. 125-126; GE 6
at  4,  7)  He  told  the  VA  doctor  that  he  had  not  had  problems  in  the  last  two  months;
however, he said he was having visual hallucinations of Rainbow Dash a few times each
week. (Tr1. 126-127, 142; GE 6 at 4) The VA treatment plan was for him to return to the
clinic in the event that his symptoms worsen. (GE 6 at 7) A January 31, 2017 VA treatment
note indicates, “coping with symptoms, risk of relapse off medications.” (GE 6 at 4) The
diagnosis was “Social anxiety disorder.” (GE 6 at 6)
In June of 2018, Applicant did not get a good grade on an examination while he
was  in  college.  He  waited  for  about  month,  and  he  slashed  two  tires  on  a  neighbor’s
vehicle. Applicant described the incident as follows:
Well,  there  was  a  neighbor  across  the  street,  they  had  an  SUV  with  an
overly  sensitive  alarm.  Sometimes  they  go  off  for  no  reason.  And  well,
during that class, I had an exam, and it went off three times in one hour the
night before the exam, and in that exam, I got a D. The first time I've ever
got a grade even close to that low in higher education. So that night, you
know, it was going off again, I was upset, drunk, and I made the horribly
regrettable decision to go across the street and slash two of their tires. (Tr.
72)
Applicant said he felt guilty about what he had done, and he paid for the repairs for the
vehicle plus a couple hundred dollars. (Tr. 73) His neighbor did not report the incident to
the  police.  (Tr1.  128-129)  During  his  June  18,  2019  Office  of  Personnel  Management
(OPM) interview, he said he was still having brief suicidal thoughts. (Tr1. 129)
On January 11, 2021, Dr. B, who is a licensed clinical psychologist, issued a report
relating to Applicant’s mental health at the request of the DOD CAF. (GE 3 at 1) Applicant
told Dr. B that he was discharged from the Army for “requiring a prescription for a non-
deployable  medication.”  (Id.  at  2)  He  was  not  currently  prescribed  mental-health
medications. (Id.) He had not had mental-health treatment or counseling since leaving VA
treatment, and he did not believe he needed treatment. (Id. at 3) He most recently had
thoughts of suicide after receiving a B in a course in 2018. (Id.) As for the AVH, Applicant
told Dr. B:
During 2015, [Applicant] had some psychotic symptoms. He would see a
My Little Pony character, Rainbow Dash, most of the time. He reported that
he enjoyed watching My Little Ponies because he found it calming. When
stressed, he would see this pony out of the corner of his eye, and the pony
would tell him calming/reassuring things and then disappear. There were,
however, a couple [of] incidents where he heard voices telling him to hurt
himself and once he saw something biting his head. (GE 3 at 3)
Dr. B’s  diagnoses were  as follows: “Major depressive  disorder, recurrent,  severe
with   psychotic  features  in full   remission;  Unspecified   anxiety   disorder; and   Schizotypal
personality  disorder.”  (GE  3  at 5) She  explained  the  schizotypal personality  disorder as
follows:
This  included  unusual  thinking,  perceptions,  and  beliefs;  lack  of  close
friends  outside  of  his  family  of  origin;  unusual  emotional  responses;  and
excessive  social  discomfort.  While  some  of  his  personality  traits  are
unusual, they would not preclude his ability to maintain security of sensitive
information  appropriately.  He  does  appear  quite  anxious,  and  could  be
persuaded to share information through manipulation. His depression is in
remission,  and  might  remain  so,  given  that  it  occurred  only  during  his
military experience; however, it is plausible that it would recur during other
times of stress.
[Applicant’s]  prognosis   is  guarded   overall.  He  is  doing   well   compared   to
prior  times  of  great  emotional   distress.   Still,  he   does  have   conditions  of
anxiety   and   depression   that  have   been   quite   severe  at   times  and   might
recur. Therefore,  if  not  in treatment,  I would have  concerns regarding  his
judgment,  stability, and  trustworthiness. . . . [Applicant]  would benefit from
regular treatment for his emotional distress and  personality  disorder. This
would mitigate  my  concerns that his conditions could  impede  his  functioning
with regard to possessing protected information. (GE 3 at 5)
Dr. D was a  witness on  Applicant’s behalf  at  his hearing. Dr. D  is a clinical and
forensic psychologist who is board certified in clinical psychology. (Tr1. 27-28) He served
on active duty in the Navy for five years, and he has been in private practice since 2008.
(Tr1.  28)  He  has  done  thousands  of  security-related  evaluations  for  federal  entities,
including DOD and the Navy, states, municipalities, and private companies. (Tr1. 29-30)
He spent at least three hours interviewing Applicant, and he examined medical records,
Dr. B’s report, and the results of psychological tests. (Tr1. 32-33, Tr2. 27)
Dr. D informed Applicant before the interview that there was no confidentiality, and
if Applicant said anything negative, he would have to report the information. (Tr2. 27) Dr.
D noted that Applicant had, “A distinct tendency toward avoiding self disclosure [which]
is evident in this patient's response style.” (AE A at 7) Nevertheless, Dr. D believed that
Applicant’s  self-report  to  him  of  the  current  absence  of  hallucinations  was  accurate
because usually hallucinations are accompanied by body language such as scanning the
room  with  eyes  due  to  paranoia,  and  Applicant  did  not  show  behavior  consistent  with
paranoia. (Tr2. 26) A person with hallucinations usually believes hallucinations are real;
however, when Applicant previously had hallucinations, he was aware they were not real.
(Tr2.  26)  Dr.  D  did  not  explain  why  Applicant  would  be  paranoid  if  he  believed  the
hallucinations about Rainbow Dash were not real and were soothing.
Dr. D said the  psychological tests showed  Applicant was minimally  depressed  and
he  had  low  anxiety. (Tr1. 34) There was no  evidence  of  alcohol use  or abuse  of  illegal
drugs.  (Tr1.  34)  The   Millon   Clinical  Multiaxial  Inventory-IV   (MCMI-IV)  test  showed
“somewhat of  a  defensive  profile;” however, the  test was still  valid. (Tr1. 35) The  MCMI-
IV  test did  not indicate  a  personality  disorder. (Tr1.  35) He had  some  peaks  during  the
test; however, he  considered  Applicant to  be  in the  normal,  healthy  range. (Tr1. 36)  His
Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) showed a  “very  defensive”  profile; however, this
profile  was not significant enough  to  invalidate  the  test.  (Tr1. 38; Tr2. 10-11, 17) He was
“two  standard  deviations above  the  mean  for  defensiveness.” (Tr2. 17) Dr. D  concluded
Applicant’s high  level of compulsiveness enabled  Dr. D  to  validate  Applicant’s  PAI. (Tr2.
18) The  PAI showed no  psychopathology  and  the  results were within normal  limits.  (Tr1.
38) However, the  defensiveness indicated  a  reluctance  to  disclose  information, and  the
PAI administered  for Dr. B’s evaluation  did  not report this defensiveness. (Tr2. 14-15, 18)
He  readily   disclosed   information   to   the   Army   about  his dreams  and   hallucinations  that
most people would not freely disclose. (Tr2. 15)
Dr. D reviewed Dr. B’s report, and he disagreed with her findings and conclusions.
(Tr1. 40) Dr. D believed Dr. B was influenced by “diagnostic momentum phenomenon” in
which she “basically rubber stamped” the diagnosis in Applicant’s medical records. (Tr1.
39-40; AE A at 6-7) Dr. D concluded that there was a “strong possibility” that Applicant
experienced  “serotonin  syndrome,”  which  was  caused  by  the  interaction  of  three
psychotropic medications, and serotonin syndrome contributed to or caused Applicant’s
mood changes and hallucinations. (Tr1. 41, 46; AE A at 7) The other causes could be
due  to  his  medications  or  suicidal  thoughts.  (Tr1.  46)  Serotonin  could  accentuate  the
negative effects of other medications such as Paxil and Buspar. (Tr1. 41-42) He believed
Applicant’s perceptual disturbances started due to taking serotonin. (Tr1. 43) Dr. D did
not diagnose Applicant with serotonin syndrome because he is not Applicant’s prescribing
psychologist or psychiatrist. (Tr2. 7)
Applicant told Dr. D that “since leaving the Army, he has not seen Rainbow Dash
again. Applicant said once he left the Army things rapidly improved for him.” (GE A at 3)
However,  the  VA  medical  records  indicate  Applicant  continued  to  see  Rainbow  Dash
throughout his VA treatment. In a subsequent visit with Dr. D, Applicant said that he had
the visual hallucinations for a couple of weeks after he stopped taking the medications;
however, later in the interview, he told Dr. D “that all hallucinations he had were isolated
to his military experience.” (GE A at 13)
After Applicant stopped taking serotonin the disturbances decreased, and a month
or so later, the disturbances ended. (Tr1. 43) His hallucinations were brief and episodic
and  “only  occurred  while  he  was  on  the  medication.”  (Tr1.  44)  Applicant  told  Dr.  D  in
October 2021 that he was still having brief suicidal thoughts when he was feeling stress.
(Tr1. 130, 131) Dr. D said that serotonin continues to affect a person for one or two weeks
after the person stops taking it. (Tr2. 5) Serotonin syndrome can also occur from taking a
combination of other medications. (Tr2. 5)
Dr. D did not observe  that Applicant’s hallucinations were worse when  he  forgot to
take  his medications. (Tr2. 8)  Dr. D did not indicate  in his report that Applicant slashed
his  neighbor’s  tires.   (Tr2.  11)   Dr.   D  decided   the   tire-slashing   incident  was  an   outlier
because there were no other alcohol-related incidents. (Tr2. 12, 19) He does not believe
Applicant needs mental-health treatment. (Tr2. 24)
Dr.  D  described   Applicant  as  having   “a  rigid,   compulsive,  socially-anxious
personality.”  (Tr2.  19;   GE   A   at  8)  He  had   a   significant  adjustment  disorder  and   an
unspecified  anxiety  disorder when  he  was in the  Army. (Tr2. 20, 23) Dr. D did not believe
Applicant had  a  schizotypal diagnosis because  he  did not  have  magical  thinking. (Tr2.
22) Dr. D did not agree  with  the  diagnosis of  depression  because  Applicant did  not exhibit
depression  in a  recurring  fashion, that is, it did not occur pre-Army  service or after his
discharge.  (Tr2.  22)  Dr.  D  was  unable  to   diagnose   Applicant  with   a   mental-health   or
personality  disorder. (Tr2. 5-6,  20-21) He  found  Applicant  to  be  psychologically  fit to  have
access to classified information. (Tr2. 7) Dr. D concluded:
Moreover, I found no evidence of him having a major depressive disorder,
a  psychotic  disorder,  or  a  schizotypal  personality  disorder,  and  to  in  fact
present  very  similarly  to  those  in  the  computer  science  field  working  as
software  engineers.  These  individuals  are  often  introverted  and  less
interpersonally  skilled.  To  be  clear,  I  found  no  evidence  to  suggest  any
concerns about his reliability, judgment, stability, or trustworthiness. I find
him  psychologically  suitable  to  handle,  manage,  and  maintain  classified
information. (AE A at 15)
Applicant lives alone. (Tr1. 86) He does not have family living in the state where
he lives. (Tr1. 86) He plans to move to the state where his family lives. (Tr1. 87-88) He
does not have a significant other in his life, and he has not had an intimate relationship
with a significant other for about 10 years. (Tr1. 137)
Applicant said in about  2019, the  suicidal ideations stopped. (Tr1. 68-69; AE  A  at
13) He   said   he  had   zero  suicidal thoughts  in   2022.  (Tr1.   130)   He   has   not   had   serious
anxiety  since  May  of 2020.  (Tr1.  135) He  does not  experience  problems  sleeping. (Tr1.
135) He  has not  cut  himself for several years. (Tr1. 106) He  has not had  any  homicidal
ideations.  (Tr1.  120)   He  has  not   received   mental-health   treatment  since   January   31,
2017. (Tr1. 127)  He does not  believe  his  current employment  is  stressful. (Tr1. 76) He
has good relationships with his coworkers. (Tr1. 76)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s performance evaluation working for his current employer is excellent.
(AE F) His first and second level supervisors, four coworkers, his mother, and his brother
provided statements supporting Applicant’s access to classified information. (AE H) The
general sense of their statements is that Applicant is reliable, responsible, diligent, and
professional. (Id.) His second level supervisor said Applicant is a “reliable and trustworthy
employee that is accountable,” and he said:
[Applicant] is dedicated to the team’s mission and can be counted on to get
the job done no matter the task. Over the past few months, I have been able
to observe [him] grow professionally and work through the learning curve of
transitioning  from  being  a  software  developer  to  a  software  quality
assurance  engineer.  I  have  no  doubt  that  [he]  will  continue  to  grow  and
progress as he further develops and hones his skillset moving forward. (AE

"Applicant is  45  years old  and  married  with  two  children. He  has  a  bachelor’s degree
and  a  master’s degree. He retired  from the Navy in 2019 as a lieutenant commander (O-
4).  Applicant  is   employed   by   a   defense   contractor  as  a   program   manager   and   is
attempting   to   retain   a   security   clearance   in   relation   to   his  employment.   (Government
Exhibit 1 at Sections  12,  13A, 15, and  17; Applicant Exhibits J, K, L, and N.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions)
The DoD CAF alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is not eligible
for access because he has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair
his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness.
Paragraph 2 (Guideline D: Sexual Behavior)
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for clearance because he has engaged in sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense;
reflects  a  lack  of  judgment  or  discretion;  or  may  subject  Applicant  to  undue  influence,
coercion, exploitation, or duress.
The  following  discussion  will  be  primarily  chronological.  During  a  period  of
psychological treatment discussed below Applicant was engaging in several extra-marital
affairs and other addictive sexual activities.
The   Government   stated   at   the   hearing   that   they   were   not  proceeding   on   SOR
allegations   1.a,  1.b,  and   1.d.   Those   allegations  solely   concerned   mental  health
counseling  obtained  by  Applicant.  Paragraph  27  of  the  AG,  which sets forth  the  concern
under  this  guideline,  states  in   pertinent  part,  “No   negative   inference   concerning   the
standards in this guideline  may  be  raised  solely  on  the  basis of mental health  counseling.”
Based on  the  Government’s representation, SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, and  1.d  are found
for Applicant.  Allegation  2.b  is hereby  amended  to  conform  with  the  above  findings. It  now
reads, “That information set forth in subparagraph 1.c, above.” (Tr. 8.)
Applicant had a series of sexual relationships with women who were not his wife
starting in 2016 and ending in 2018. Three of these were “one-night stands.” A fourth was
a  long-term  emotional and  sexual  relationship  that  lasted  several  months.  All  of  these
incidents occurred while Applicant was on active duty with the Navy. He has stated that
he has not engaged in extra-marital sexual activity since 2018.
Applicant has also stated that he has a long-term addiction to pornography, which
he  is  unable,  or  unwilling,  to  stop.  As  described  further  below,  he  has  been  receiving
therapy for these issues since 2017. He also  participates in a 12-step program for sex
addiction.
Government Exhibit 2 consists of Applicant’s response  to  DOHA interrogatories.
Specifically,  the  exhibit  includes  the  Reports  of  Investigation  (ROI)  of  Applicant’s
interviews with authorized investigators from the Office of Personnel Management. Those
interviews will be discussed as appropriate.
Applicant’s  first  affair   began   in   approximately   October  2016   and   continued   into
2017.   He  became   emotionally   as  well   as   sexually   involved   with   this  person.  They
corresponded   on   social  media,  and   met  several  times  for  sex.   He  described   this
relationship  in an  ROI dated  April 5, 2019. (Government Exhibit 2  at 10; Tr. 36-37, 57-
58.)
Applicant began voluntary psychiatric and psychological treatment while he was
on active duty in the Navy on March 21, 2017. In his initial intake interview he stated a
desire to receive treatment for anxiety and depression symptoms. He also stated that he
had  issues  with  pornography.  He  was  diagnosed  with  “Adjustment  Disorder  with
depressed  mood.”  There  is  no  indication  that  he  discussed  his  extra-marital  sexual
relationship with his therapist at this time. (Government Exhibit 7 at 1-11.)
Applicant’s second affair involved a single incident with a woman he met on work-
related travel in 2017. He stated in his testimony that there was an additional one-night
incident with a different woman, also in 2017. This incident was not otherwise revealed
until the hearing. (Government Exhibit 2 at 11; Tr. 37-38.)
Applicant joined a 12-step program (Sex Addicts Anonymous) in December 2017.
His  sponsor  from  this  program  provided  a  letter  in  support  of  Applicant.  (Government
Exhibit 2 at 10-12; Applicant Exhibit E at 2; Tr. 30-31.)
Applicant’s fourth sexual liaison was a one-night stand with a different woman that
occurred  sometime  in  2018.  He  further  testified  that  he  contacted  his  12-step  group
sponsor the day after this happened. (Government Exhibit 2 at 11; Tr. 37-38, 45-46.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  realized  his  extra-marital  sexual  activity  amounted  to
commission of the offense of Adultery under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
He did not tell his command or security officer about his conduct. (Tr. 46.)
The next note in the Navy medical file is from March 22, 2018. The note includes
a diagnosis that Applicant continues to suffer from “Adjustment Disorder with depressed
mood.”  Pertinent  excerpts from  the  Progress Notes are  as follows,  “Patient  [Applicant]
reported that he had a period of almost one month with no social media. During that time
however, patient appears to have reverted back to many his old habits (i.e. drinking more
than agreed-upon;  talking to  old  flings). Patient  eventually re-downloaded many of  the
social  media  apps.”  There  is  no  indication  that  he  discussed  his  extra-marital  sexual
relationships with his therapist at this time. (Government Exhibit 7 at 13-18.)
Applicant filled out an e-QIP on April 5, 2018. (Government Exhibit 1.) Section 21
of  the  questionnaire  asked  Applicant  about  mental  health  treatment.  Under  “Optional
Comment” he stated, “I have sought out and continue to receive medical mental health
treatment  and  counseling  for  Anxiety,  depression,  and  PTSD  symptoms  relating  to
traumatic experiences growing up in a region with high rates of violent crime, as well as
deployment to Iraq in 2013-2014.”
The  next  note  in  the  Navy  medical  file  is  from  May  29,  2018.  The  diagnosis
continues  to  be  “Adjustment  Disorder with  depressed mood.”  It appears that Applicant
has told his providers of his extra-marital affairs by this time. Pertinent excerpt from the
Progress Notes are as follows:
Patient reported  that he  failed  with  his goal of nonsexual behavior outside
of  his work responsibilities (while  on  travel). Patient reported  that he called
his  sponsor  after  the   behavior.  Patient   stated   that   he   has  started   to
recognize  how  “addicted” he  is to  sexual pursuits. Patient reported  that  his
sponsor taught him  about the  3  circles of  addiction. Patient talked  about the
correlation   between   his  drinking   behavior  and   his  acting   out  sexually.
Patient  talked   about  the   benefits  of   continuing   to   go   to   SA   [Sex   Addicts
Anonymous] meetings. (Government Exhibit 7 at 19-24;  Tr. 39.)
Applicant was interviewed on June 5, 2018. The ROI stated, “There is nothing in
the Subject’s background that can be used against him for blackmail or coercion.” There
is no mention in the ROI that Applicant discussed his history of sexual activity outside of
marriage or his problems with pornography with the investigator. (Government Exhibit 2
at 3-8.)
The  next  note  in  the  Navy  medical  file  is  from  August  24,  2018.  This  meeting
appears  to  have  been  precipitated  by  his  two  primary  providers  (Dr.  F  and  Dr.  R).
Pertinent excerpts from the Note are as follows:
Patient  informed that he  was  being rescreened for his security clearance
(TS/SCI) and that different investigators had approached both of us about
his  treatment.  It  was  discussed  with  the  patient  that  we  both  had
reservations about not making the proper authorities aware of his apparent
addiction to sexually related behavior/environments. Patient was informed
that both providers would be making comments on his reevaluation of his
security  clearance  in  regards  to  his  treatment  of  his  sexually  related
behavior.
Patient  has  been  compliant  with  all  treatment  recommendations  to  date.
Patient  has  been  significantly  involved  in  the  SA  community  and  has  a
sponsor that  he  checks  in  with  regularly.  Patient  routinely meets  with  his
pastor, attends therapy and is managed with medication by Psychiatry for
his sexual addiction. (Government Exhibit 7 at 25.)
Applicant was asked by me whether he told his command or security officer that
his therapists were going to notify Federal investigators of his sex addiction. He stated, “I
did not. And, truth be told, when I was at that particular Command, I was only operating
at a Secret Clearance. I did not even know who the FSO [Facility Security Officer] was. I
think my intent was just to be honest with the background investigation.” (Tr. 56-57.)
The next note in the Navy medical file is from September 21, 2018. The diagnosis
changed at this point to be “Other Sexual Disorders, Sex Addiction.” Pertinent excerpts
from the Progress Notes are as follows, “Patient and therapist talked about his impulsive
sexual behavior. Patient talked about the concept of seeing his addiction as ‘an enemy’
and how he needed to approach like ‘a battle.’ Patient talked about the importance of not
making excuses for his behavior or why he has not made more progress with his 12-step
SA program.” (Government Exhibit 7 at 27-32.)
The next note in the Navy medical file is from December 13, 2018. Applicant had
a change in providers at this time. The diagnosis changed at this point to “Generalized
Anxiety Disorder and Dysthymic Disorder.” Pertinent excerpts from the Intake Notes are
as follows:
Overuse   of   pornography   &   sexual  behavior  incompatible   with   personal
ethics. Patient believes that his struggles with  pornography  are related, as
alcohol  is,  to   his  proclivity   to   “distract   myself”  from   personal  discomfort.
Believes he  was exposed  early  in life  to  pornography, that it was normalized
by  other men, and  believes that it has been  destructive  for him  in that it often
insidiously  takes up  greater amounts of time  than  he  plans. Further,  it has
invited  his actual acting  out (consensual extramarital sex) with  women  he
meets either while  traveling  or through  Tinder/online  “hook-up” sites. Has
wanted to stop watching porn and couldn’t control his use of it over time (up
to several hours per day in more remote hx [history]). Seems to evaluate
women  physically  (my  wife  is  really  beautiful,  but  this  other  woman  was
beautiful  too)  and  sees  porn  as  primarily  a  problem  for  men  (i.e.  lack  of
empathy for the women involved).
He struggles with monogamy (even w/in the past year has had a 6 month
affair and can’t stop “checking out what’s on Tinder”) as well and feels guilty
about  his  behavior.  Says  wife  is  not  OK  with  him  having  extramarital
sex/relationships, that she knows about “some” of this activity, and that she
is willing to stay with him “as long as she believes I’m working on it.”
Personal inadequacy  and  career disappointments:  Pt got passed  over twice
for CDR, says “I got derailed,” and  he’ll  be  retiring  after this tour at 20  years.
.  .   .   He   feels  left   out   and   left  behind,   as  his  friends  are  “SEALS   and
astronauts.” He feels profoundly   inadequate,  like   a  failure  personally  and
professionally.  He  admits  he   has  little  insight  about  how   this,  along   with
early   attachment  issues,  may   contribute   to  his psychiatric  symptoms  and
dysfunctional behavior. (Government Exhibit 7 at 33-42;  Tr. 39-40.)
Applicant and his wife deny that he had a six-month affair in the 2017/2018-time
frame with yet another woman. (Applicant Exhibit R; Tr. 38-40.)
As stated, Applicant was interviewed by a DoD investigator on April 5, 2019. The
investigator reported in pertinent part:
Subject   was  told   that   the   initial  complaint   for  medical   and   psychiatric
treatment  was  overuse   of  porn  and   sexual   behavior  incompatible  with
personal ethics. The  provider does not trust Subject’s behavior due  to  his
impulsive   sexual  behavior  and   feels   the   condition   may   impair   Subject’s
judgment  and   reliability.  Subject   is  treated/counseled   for  this  behavior.
Subject feels the  provider may  feel that way  because  Subject had an  affair
and   considers  himself  a   sex   addict.  Subject  provided   Dr.  [R]  may   be
concerned  about  Subject being  blackmailed  because  of the  behavior which
he  struggled  with  outside  of  his marriage  with  meeting  other women  which
started  two  years ago. Subject is not proud  of  it and  got  the  help himself
when  he  started  this behavior two  years ago.  (Government Exhibit 2  at 10.)
The ROI continued:
Subject does agree with his judgment and reliability is not optimal and that
he  engaged  in  extramarital  sexual  activity  when  he  travels  which  was
discussed  earlier  in  the  interview.  Subject  feels  that  he  agrees  with  the
provider stating that his impulsive sexual behavior and feels his condition
may  impact Subject’s judgment and  reliability on  his personal matters but
has no  effect on his professional life. (Government Exhibit 2 at 12.)
The last note in the Navy medical file is from April 17, 2019. The diagnosis
changed  to  “Other  Sexual  Disorders,  Sex  Addiction  and  Narcissistic  Traits.”
Pertinent excerpts from the Progress Notes are as follows:
SA Meetings: multiple times per week (tele-meeting by phone or in-person.)
. . . Patient stated that he is due to get his one-month chip soon. Patient
talked about his frustration with his background investigation. Patient talked
about boundaries at work since finding out that 2 women have now blocked
him  on  social  media.  Patient  talked  about  his  relationship  with  his  wife.
(Government Exhibit 7 at 43-48.)
Applicant  stated  that  he  received  counseling  from  his  mental  health  medical
providers concerning his conduct with co-workers discussed immediately above. He was
not counseled by his command. (Tr. 42-45.)
Applicant  testified that he believed  that he has  or did have  Generalized  Anxiety
Disorder and Depression as described by his  Navy providers above.  He further stated
that he believed the conditions are controlled  by psychiatric treatment and medication.
(Tr. 25.)
As  noted,  Applicant  retired  from  the  Navy  in  2019.  He  then  began  receiving
treatment from a Dr. J at the VA starting in November 2019. The Progress Notes from the
VA are Government Exhibit 8. They begin on June 5, 2020.
The Progress Note of September 11, 2020, stated in part, “He [Applicant] reported
relapse on his sexual compulsion maybe 4 times in two weeks.” (Government Exhibit 8
at 7.)
Applicant testified  that the  above  probably  referred  to  his looking  at pornography.
He also conceded  that it might have  been  his conduct in “checking” women  out on  social
media. (Tr. 41-42.)
The same Progress Note also stated under “Assessment/Plan,” “After 3 months of
no  compulsive  sexual behavior he  relapsed acouple  [sic] of  weeks  ago.” (Government
Exhibit 8 at 10.)
Applicant testified that the above incident involved pornography. The date of the
Note  is  stated  incorrectly  as,  “June  5,  2021,”  in  the  question  asked  by  Department
Counsel. (Tr. 40-41.)
Applicant and  his wife  began  couple’s  therapy  with  Dr.  M  in  January  2021.  The
therapy was for “Process Addiction/Sex Addiction.” He began individual therapy in August
2021. Dr. M provided a letter dated February 8, 2022. (Applicant Exhibit P.) The provider
wrote  that both  Applicant and  his  wife  were cooperative  in the  process. The  letter goes
on  to  state, “Both  [Applicant and  his wife] have  made  progress and  there has been  better
communication  and  less conflict in the  relationship. [Applicant]  has  also made  progress
with   his  individual  treatment  and   been   able   to   decrease   and   eventually   eliminate   the
behaviors for which he was seeking help.”
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  DoD  psychiatric  consultant  (Dr.  S)  on  May  10,
2021. His report is Government Exhibit 5. Applicant’s history as related by him to Dr. S
basically tracks with other documents in the record and is not repeated here. Dr. S also
spoke to three coworkers of Applicant and one of his current mental health providers.
Mr.  H  was  interviewed   by   Dr.  S.  He   is  a   supervisor  of  Applicant   for  Applicant’s
employer. He stated  that Applicant is a  “diligent worker who  is a   highly   engaged  team
player.”   He  further stated   that he   does not believe   Applicant has any   mental health   or
substance  abuse  issues. Finally, he  stated,  “Source [Mr. H] believes that the  Subject’s
judgment,   reliability,  and   trustworthiness  are  intact  and   highly   recommends  him.”
(Government Exhibit 5  at 5.)
A second supervisor of Applicant, Mr. M, was also interviewed. He is the program
manager  for a military program that works with Applicant’s employer. Mr. M  had  a  different
view  of  Applicant,  stating  that he  would often react emotionally  when  receiving  feedback
or  direction.  He   also   discussed   a   particular  issue   he   had   concerning   Applicant’s
interactions with  Ms. V, further discussed  below. Mr. M  felt that  Applicant displayed  poor
judgment in his interactions  with  Ms. V  and  Mr. M  about the  issue.  Mr. M  concluded  by
saying:
Source [Mr. M] stated  that he  has concerns about Subject’s judgment based
upon   the   incidents  discussed.   Source  denied   any   concern  about  the
Subject’s  reliability. Source believes that   the  Subject   is mostly  honest but
will   omit  details  or   information.  Source   was  initially   ambivalent   about
recommending   the   Subject   but   eventually  confirmed   that   he   would
recommend   him   if   there  were  an   abundant  amount  of   oversights  and
controls  in  place   to   scaffold  the   Subject.  Source  stated   that  the   Subject
currently   works  with   several  constraints  and   boundaries  within  his  role
which were placed  there out of necessity. (Government Exhibit 5 at 5-6.)
Ms.  V   is  the   security   officer  for  a   military   program   that  works  with   Applicant’s
employer. She  is not his company’s security officer. She  discussed  a  particular incident
with   Applicant  that   she   felt  was  not  handled   properly   by   Applicant.   The   incident   is  not
related  to  the  mental health  or  sexual misconduct  issues  discussed  in this  decision,  but
she   and   Mr.  M   believe   it   showed   poor  judgment  on   Applicant’s   part  on   that  particular
occasion. Speaking in  general about Applicant Ms. V stated:
Source credited the Subject with making improvements with coaching and
appropriate  changes  when  corrected.  However,  Source  also  expressed
concerns about the  Subject’s emotional stability  and  believes that there is
an  ever-present possibility that he may react aggressively to  situations that
are  not  favorable  to   him.  Source   confirmed   that  there   were  interpersonal
issues between  him  and  other workers but  would  not  go  into  further  detail.
Source  deferred  on  speaking  to  the  Subject’s ability  to  have  good  judgment
as  she   has   significant   reservations.  Source   denied   any   concerns  about
Subject’s reliability. Subject deferred speaking about the Subject’s honesty
and   trustworthiness  due   to   omissions.  Source  stated   that  she   would
recommend  him  with  similar caveats as  Mr. [M].  (Government  Exhibit 5  at
6.)
Applicant denied that he had ever acted in the way described by Mr. M and Ms. V
in  their  interviews  with  Dr.  S.  He  believes  that  their  incorrect  statements  are  due  to
personality conflicts between the three of them. (Tr. 49-52.)
Dr. S also talked to Dr. C, who is Applicant’s psychologist. She has been treating
Applicant since January 2021. She stated:
Subject  has weekly  sessions and  has engaged  in  EMDR  [Eye  Movement
Desensitization  and  Reprocessing  Therapy]  and  is currently  working  on  a
book on  sex  addiction.  Source  reported  that the  Subject presented  with  a
variety   of  psychological  and   behavioral  issues  that  were  rooted   in  his
upbringing. Subject seeks validation  and  is susceptible to  anything  that he
perceives  as  rejection.  Subject  may   respond   to   perceived   rejection   with
anger,  anxiety,  or  mood   lability.  Subject  may   act  out  or  become
confrontational  with   those   involved   in  such   instances  as  well.  Source
confirmed  that  the  Subject  may  also seek validation  from  other  pursuits or
people.   Source  denied   that  [sic]  any   knowledge   of   affairs  beyond   those
already  discussed  by  the  Subject.  Subject has shown  improvement through
the  EMDR  and  is  more insightful  towards his triggers but is vulnerable to
personalizing   and   emotional  reasoning.  Source  believes  that  the   Subject
has good  judgment in  regard to  national security  work and  stated  that his
issues  with   judgment   are  mainly   in  regard  to   his  personal  life.  Source
believes that the  Subject is reliable and  is a  trustworthy  and  moral individual.
(Government Exhibit 5  at 6-7;  Tr. 54-55.)
Dr. S  gave  the  following  Diagnostic Impression, Diagnosis,  and  Prognosis on  page
7 of  Government Exhibit 5. The Diagnostic Impression is as follows:
The   Subject   was  referred   for  evaluation   to   determine   if   his  previous
diagnoses  or behaviors impair  his judgment,  reliability, or trustworthiness.
The  Subject  has been previously  diagnosed with  depressive  disorders and
self-reported  anxiety  in  the  context of  performance  or perception  of others.
While the  Evaluator  concurs that the  Subject  has suffered  from  both  kinds
of   symptoms  in   the   past,   the   symptoms   are  better  explained   through   the
lens  of  a   personality   disorder.  The   Subject’s  internal  drive   for  validation,
negative  self-image,  and  affective  sensitivity  appear  to  have  been
developed over the course of his childhood and adolescence and have been
present  across  his  lifespan.  The  majority  of  the  maladaptive  issues
previously discussed  were  the  direct  result of  him experiencing rejection,
needing  validation,  being  affectively  triggered  by  external  events,  or
questioning his identity/purpose in life. The behavioral expression of these
issues were the affairs, increased use of pornography, and increased use
of alcohol. The diagnoses below attempt to best capture his expression of
psychological issues over the reported timeline.
The Diagnoses are, “Other specified personality disorder, mixed cluster B traits;
History of social exclusion or rejection; and History of parent/child relational problem.”
Dr. S provided the following Prognosis:
The  presence  of a  personality  disorder with  these  traits  will inherently  place
the  Subject at a varying amount of risk in terms of judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness.  That   level  of   risk  will  depend   heavily   upon   the   Subject’s
perception   of  stability  and   self-worth   across  personal  and   professional
areas and   his ability   to   manage   his emotional reactivity. When   balanced,
the  Subject  with  likely  perform  well. When  unbalanced, the  Subject  will likely
express  the   aggressive/labile   traits  mentioned   by   his  references.  The
events  previously   discussed   and   the   collateral  information   gathered   over
the  course of  this evaluation  show  explicit examples of how  his emotional
reactivity  and  perception  of  rejection  can  result in impulsive  behaviors and
unfavorable decisions. Credit should  be  given  to  the  Subject  who  responded
to  his previous affairs by  initiating  counseling, being  dedicated  to  treatment,
and  searching  for  ways to  avoid future unfaithfulness. This illustrates that
the   Subject   is  willing   to   adapt  and   seek  answers  to   his  problem   with   the
correct motivation, boundaries, and  consequences. However, it should be
underscored  that such  adjustments occurred  after he  acted  in  ways, that  he
admits,  were  against   his  values,  impulsive,  and   had   the   possibility   of
causing  irreparable  damage  to  his family. It  should  also  be  noted  that the
Subject   had   already   been   engaged   in  both   counseling   and   medication
treatment when  the  affairs occurred. While  his last  indiscretion  occurred  in
2018,  he   still   struggles  with   emotional  reactivity   as  evidenced   by   the
testimony   provided   by   his  therapist  and   references.   The   feedback  from
those   who   have   regular  contact  with   him   in   a   professional  environment
should   be   taken   very  seriously   as  positive   impression   management  is
always a factor during cross-sectional evaluations.
A Progress Note dated January 11, 2022, from the VA stated that Applicant had
attended a program aimed at reducing his compulsive sexual behaviors. The Progress
Note also stated, “He [Applicant] reported relapsing on sexual compulsive behavior but
not drinking.” (Government Exhibits 6 and 8 at 6.)
10
The last VA Progress Note available is from February 16, 2022. Applicant told his
therapist that there had been a “slight exacerbation of his sexual obsession. But he has
not acted on them.” (Government Exhibit 8 at 1.)
Applicant Exhibit Q is a letter February 28, 2022, from Dr. J about Applicant. In
part the letter says, “He [Applicant] is taking his medications and comes to his follow-up
appointments  regularly.  He  has  been  seeking  help  and  has  agreed  with  different
treatment modalities and he has been noticing an improvement in his symptoms.”
Dr. J submitted an additional letter dated June 3, 2022. The letter states in pertinent
part, “He [Applicant] is compliant with the treatment plan. He is taking his medications and
he comes to his follow-up appointments regularly. He is very motivated to seek help and
has agreed with different treatment options including medication, different psychotherapy
modalities, and  rehab programs. Based on his report and my evaluation it  sounds  like
that [sic] he is improving.” (Applicant Exhibit U.)
Applicant testified that he is following Dr. J’s advice “to the letter.” Applicant also
testified that he believed he had obtained adequate skills  to curtail the adverse sexual
activity  that  was  alleged,  particularly  that  caused  by  professional  or  personal
disappointments.  He  stated  that  there  have  been  several  contributors  to  his  ability  to
control his behaviors, “The skills and treatment I have received in counseling, my support
group and support of my wife, and accountability and accountability partners.” (Tr. 25-27,
48-49.)
With regard to adverse sexual activity, Applicant testified that there were several
factors that would prevent him from engaging in such conduct again, “Number one, the
fact that I do not want to do that. Number two, that immediately when I started manifesting
that behavior, I recognized that this was not something I wanted to do, and I sought help
for it. Number three, my support group. Number four, the support of my family.” (Tr. 32.)
Applicant testified that his last relapse of sexual compulsion was several months
before  the  hearing,  sometime  in  2021  or  early  2022.  He  stated  that  those  behaviors
include  “looking  at  pornography,  contacting  women  with  the  intent  to  flirt  or  otherwise
make liaisons.” He further stated that his wife is aware of this activity. (Tr. 47-48.)
Applicant’s wife  submitted  two  declarations on  his behalf. In  Applicant Exhibit A
she stated that she is aware of the allegations contained in the SOR and that the two of
them  are  attending  counseling.  She  believes  Applicant  has  shown  “significant
improvements and no longer participates in the concerned conduct.” (Tr. 46-47.)
After the  hearing  Applicant’s  wife  prepared  Applicant  Exhibit  R.  In  it  she  stated,
“He  has  been  totally  forthcoming  and  honest  with  me,  his  support  group  SG,  and  his
therapist about his activities. He will even share with me an incident when he would use
11
his browser on  the  computer for searches. This is an  activity  that has abated  for some
time.” She  ended  her statement,  “Our marriage  has  never been  better. The  change  in my
husband   over  the   last   four   (4)  years  is  remarkable.   I  totally   support   his  efforts   and
appreciate  the  discipline  that he  has shown  to  improve  his behavior, our marriage, and
our family life.”  (Tr. 27.)
Mitigation
Applicant had a successful military career, as shown by documentation from the
Navy. (Applicant Exhibits D, F, G, and I.)
Applicant received positive recommendations from a fellow Sailor who served with
Applicant. He stated, “Having known [Applicant] for over 20 years now, I have consistently
known  him  to  be  a  loyal  friend,  competent  professional,  and  dedicated  patriot  of
impeccable  integrity  with  an  overwhelming  devotion  to  serving  the  country  he  loves.”
(Applicant Exhibit E at 1; Tr. 29.)
A former supervisor of Applicant during his time in the Navy also submitted a letter
stating, “I absolutely know he exceeds every standard for trustworthiness and character
both  interpersonally  and  with  regard  to  national  security.  In  the  five  years  I’ve  known
[Applicant], he can be relied on to perform all duties with integrity and honesty.” (Applicant
Exhibit E at 3; Tr. 31.)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the defense  contractor since 2019.  Applicant  has  never  held  a  security
clearance.  He is  not married, and has  no children.  (TR at page 6 at line 21 to page 7

"Applicant  is  47  years  old  and  divorced  He  currently  has  a  partner.  He  has  a
bachelor’s degree. Applicant served in the Army Reserve from 1993 to 1994 when he left
the  service  with  an  Honorable  Discharge  for  medical  reasons.  He  was  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  between  2003  and  2015.  He  held  a  security  clearance  during  that
employment  without  difficulty.  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  another  defense
contractor  since  2016  as  a  software  engineer  and  is  attempting  to  retain  a  security
clearance in relation to his employment. (Government Exhibit 2 at Sections 12, 13A, 15,
17, and 25; Attachment F.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions)
The DoD CAF alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is not eligible
for access because he has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair
his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. Applicant admitted SOR 1.a. He admitted in
part  and  denied  in  part  SOR  1.b.  He  denied  SOR  1.c.  He  admitted  SOR  1.d  with
reservations. He admitted the factual allegations in SOR 1.e, but denied that he currently
has impaired judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.
Several  of  the  SOR  paragraphs  reference  Applicant’s  being  hospitalized  or
receiving mental health treatment as part of the factual statements. (SOR 1.b, 1.c, and
1.d.)  Paragraph  27  of  the  Adjudicative  Guidelines  (AG),  which  sets  forth  the  concern
under  this  guideline,  states  in  pertinent  part,  “No  negative  inference  concerning  the
standards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental health counseling.”
In  addition,  Applicant  referred  Department  Counsel  and  me
the  Defense
Counterintelligence  and  Security  Agency  factsheet,  “Mental  Health  and  Security
Clearances.” (Attachment C.) It states in part, “Seeking mental health services does not
to
affect  one’s  ability  to  gain  or  hold  security  eligibility.  Adjudicators  regard  seeking
necessary mental health treatment as a positive step in the security clearance process.”
The following discussion will be primarily chronological. In general terms, Applicant
has been suffering from severe and chronic depression for approximately 30 years. This
depression  first  manifested  itself  when  he  was  in  the  Army,  specifically  during  his
Advanced  Individual  Training  cycle  in  1993.  Applicant  eventually  was  hospitalized  for
several months at a military medical facility and then discharged from the Army. During
that time his depression manifested itself in auditory hallucinations and incidents of self
harm. These hallucinations would continue on an occasional basis. Applicant testified that
he last had auditory hallucinations before moving to his current state of residence in 2016.
(Tr. 19-23.)
The  Government  submitted  Applicant’s  Department  of  Veteran’s  Affairs  (VA)
medical records from 1996 to 2015. (Government Exhibit 9.) The records indicate that he
has been suffering from suicidal ideation for many years. He agrees that there were many
occasions when he would obsessively think about suicide. He moved from the thought
stage to suicidal gestures at least five times (sometime between 1992 and 1996, 1999,
2012,  2013,  and  2014).  During  all  of  these  occasions  he  was  receiving  treatment  at
several VA facilities and suicide prevention measures were taken by his mental health
providers.  Applicant  testified  that  he  has  not  made  any  suicide  gestures  since  2014.
However, he continued to have suicidal ideation until at least 2020. Applicant testified that
the  therapy  he  is  undergoing  has  helped  him  “to  manage  when  things  start  to  get  to  a
point, you know, how to navigate through those feelings.” (Tr. 26-32, 40.)
Applicant specifically denied in his Answer that he was hospitalized in 1996 at a
VA hospital after a suicide attempt as alleged in SOR 1.c. The available medical records
do not show any such hospitalization, but they are incomplete or unclear because of age.
Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator on January 3, 2018. A Report of
Investigation (ROI) was prepared after the interview. The investigator reported Applicant
stated, “At an unrecalled point between 1992 and 1995 (discrepant), he [Applicant] was
hospitalized for two days at . . . V.A. Clinic.” Applicant testified that he was evaluated at
the VA facility and released, but was not hospitalized. (Government Exhibit 8 at 7; Tr. 26.)
Applicant has received active treatment at various VA facilities for various mental
health issues including major depressive disorder, psychosis, dysthymic disorder, bipolar
disorder, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol
dependence. This treatment started in 1996 and continues to the present. The medical
records show gaps in Applicant’s treatment ranging from months to years. For example,
Applicant  received  no  treatment  at  the  VA  from  2005  to  2009.  Applicant  has  been  on
medication  therapy  repeatedly  during  his  treatment.  However,  he  has  repeatedly
discontinued the treatment over the years due to severe side effects. (Government Exhibit
9; Attachment I; Applicant Exhibits C and D; Tr. 25.)
Applicant  received   an   evaluation   from   a   DoD  mental  health   consultant   in  April
2020.  The   consultant   interviewed   Applicant,  conducted   various  screening   tests,   and
reviewed   Applicant’s  mental  health   records.   He  diagnosed   Applicant  as  suffering   from
Major Depressive  Disorder, recurrent,  in  partial remission;  Posttraumatic  Stress  Disorder;
and  Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild.  (Government Exhibits 6 and  7.)
The consultant’s report stated the following:
PROGNOSIS
The  prognosis for [Applicant’s] full  recovery from  major depressive disorder
is guarded.  [Applicant]  reports  a  partial  improvement  after ongoing  mental
health  treatment  since  1996  and  intermittent compliance  with  regimen  and
medications. Given  the  chronicity of symptoms, the  course is expected  to
continue  to   be   chronic and   fluctuating   with   remissions   and   exacerbations
because  his symptoms  continue  to  cause  some  disruption  in  daily function.
The prognosis for [Applicant’s] full recovery from PTSD symptoms is fair to
good.  His symptoms remain persistent and  disruptive, however, he  has not
completed  a  course of evidence-based  trauma  therapy. Thus, it  is unknown
how his symptoms will respond to trauma-focused  treatment.
[Applicant]  is moderately motivated  to  resume  mental health  treatment.  He
verbalized  his pessimism  that his symptoms will  improve  significantly given
his  long   history  of  mental  health   treatment  to   include   psychotherapy  and
multiple  psychotropic medication  in the  past  that he  often  stopped  due  to
negative  side  effects that were  not tolerated.  He is primarily motivated  by
his chronic psychic pain,  but at the  same  time  remains pessimistic about
symptom   reduction   and   relief.   [Applicant]  has  no   financial,  logistical,
cultural,  or intellectual barriers. His pessimism  about  the  efficacy  of  mental
health   treatment  may   be   a   barrier  to   his   efforts  in   therapy   and   making
changes   as   well  as   compliance   with   psychotropic   medication.   There  is   a
high   potential   of   recurrence   of  major  depressive  symptoms  and   PTSD,
particularly as he is not engaged in  mental health treatment at his time.
The   prognosis  for  [Applicant’s]  alcohol  use   disorder  is  guarded.   He  has
experienced   three   episodes   of   drinking   in  the   last   12  months, has   a   long
history  of  maladaptive   use   of  alcohol   (binge   drinking),  and   has  been
recommended   for  alcohol  treatment  multiple   times  throughout  his  VA
treatment.  His most  recent referral of alcohol treatment per VA  records was
November 2019. He has no  history of substance  abuse  treatment.  He has
not demonstrated  a  recent pattern of abstinence. He drinks responsibly (at
home).  He  does  acknowledge   his  issues   of   alcohol  abuse.  His  use   is
expected   to   recur  during   major  depressive   episodes.  His  previous  binge
drinking   has   impaired   his  judgment   as   evidenced   by   alcohol  intoxication
during  a previous suicide attempt.
CONCLUSIONS
Based  upon  the  available information, [Applicant]  does  evidence  a  material
defect in stability due  to  his chronic mood  instability, chronic and  repeated
maladaptive  use  of  alcohol  without follow-through  on  recommended  alcohol
treatment,  minimal improvement  in his major depressive  disorder and  PTSD
diagnosis  since   1996,   intermittent  adherence   to   mental  health   treatment
regimen,  and   lifetime   and   recent  history  of  suicidal  ideation   and   multiple
suicide  attempts.  There  is a  potential security  concern that he  is not actively
addressing   his  co-occurring   mental  and   substance   use   disorders.  Of
particular concern  is the  recent suicidal ideation  and  lack of help-seeking  as
evidenced  by not resuming  mental health  treatment  since  November 2019
(last therapy session). Continued  mental health  treatment is recommended
as well as substance  abuse  treatment given  his recurrent maladaptive  use
of  alcohol.  It   is  unlikely  that  education   alone   will   adequately  address  his
problematic   use   of   alcohol   and   treatment   should   include   some   form   of
addictions therapy  and  exposure to  appropriate  community support groups.
It  appears that [Applicant]  finds much  meaning  and  purpose  in his work and
this seems to  motivate him and  [is] a  major factor that seems to  propel him
to   maintain   his   work  attendance,   efficiency,   and   performance.   He   was
reluctant  to  seek alcohol treatment  after being  referred  in  November 2019
because   of  concern  about   divulging   his  need   for  treatment  to   his  work
supervisor, but would likely be  highly motivated  to  seek both  mental health
and  alcohol treatment to  maintain his security clearance  and  continue  to  be
employed   at  [his  employer].  The   acknowledgment  of  the   nature  of  the
previous concerns and  positive  feedback from  his current  work supervisor
on   [Applicant’s]  work   performance   without   concerns   of  his  reliability,
stability,  and   trustworthiness  from   his  perspective   are  favorable   to   the
subject   [Applicant]   (Government  Exhibit  6   at   9-10.)  (All   emphasis  in
original.)
In  August  2021  Applicant  contacted  his  VA  psychologist.  She  wrote  a  progress
note based on his message and her response. (Attachment D.) He referenced the part of
Government Exhibit 6 where the consultant stated that Applicant’s condition may impair
his “judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.” Applicant then stated:
I wanted  to  use my medical record  to  show that his isn’t  the  case,  however
there are several areas in which  you  noted  that “insight and  judgment were
poor.”   I’m  certainly not   disagreeing  with  the  diagnosis. I’m  trying  to   figure
out  how  to   mitigate   this  for  the   administrative   judge   handling   my  case.  It
seems impossible  but if you  have any ideas, I’d appreciate it.
The psychologist spoke to Applicant and reported the following in Attachment D:
Veteran   [Applicant]   returned   writer’s  call   and   he   was  reached.   Discussed
concept insight/judgment that he  had  mentioned  in his email  –  let Veteran
know  that   most  [people]  who   are   acutely   symptomatic  (e.g.,   with   severe
depression,  PTSD)   will   have   poor  insight  and   judgment  but  that  this  is
changeable with  treatment.  Veteran  verbalized  understanding. Writer asked
if it would be  helpful for me  to  provide  documentation  stating  that Veteran
has been attending sessions and  motivated for care.
Applicant’s VA psychologist submitted a letter on his behalf dated August 23, 2021,
which stated:
This letter serves to  confirm  that [Applicant] has been  an  active  participant
in  mental  health   treatment  through   the   VA   .  .  .   Healthcare  System.  He
attended   a   group   treatment  which   emphasized   skills  designed   to   broadly
improve  emotional regulation  and  tolerance  of distress (February 2021  until
May 2021). [Applicant]  then  elected  to  enroll  in  individual treatment with  me
in order to  receive more  tailored, specific care  to  his mental health  problems
(May 2021  until August  2021). During  our time  working  together, [Applicant]
was always  responsive  to  treatment suggestions and  willing  to  implement
new  strategies.   It   is  my  belief  that  [Applicant]   is  absolutely  motivated   to
continue  mental health treatment. (Attachment E.)
VA records show, and Applicant’s testimony confirmed, that he was working with
a  VA  Primary  Care  Mental  Health  Integration  (PC-MHI)  team  beginning  in  December
2020 through August 2021 and May 2022 to at least July 2022. These meetings are on a
weekly or bi-weekly basis. The VA explained, “PC-MHI integrates mental health staff into
each PACT [Patient Aligned Care Team], allowing your care team to provide services for
depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use without needing a separate consult with
mental health providers outside of the PACT clinic area.” (Department of Veterans Affairs,
Patient  Care  Services:  Primary  Care  –  Mental  Health
Integration  (PC–MHI),
https://www.patientcare.va.gov/primarycare/PCMHI.asp  (last  updated  Sep.  19,  2022.)
(Applicant Exhibits C and D; Tr. 25, 33-35, 47-52.)
Applicant finds his current work very fulfilling. He testified that his current mental
health situation is good, stating, “To be honest, I think this is the best I have felt in a long
time.  Particularly,  this  year  has  been  really  good.  I‘m  not  sure  what  exactly  changed.
Yeah, it’s been good.” (Tr. 40-41, 47.)
In  conclusion  Applicant  stated, “I  don’t see  how I should be  punished. I am  seeking
–  and  continue  to  seek –  mental health  treatment.  I don’t think it’s a  punishable action. As
I mentioned  previously,  I would  never compromise national security if  I ever were  exposed
to  classified  information. It’s not even  a  thought in my head  to  do  any  of those  things.” (Tr.
54.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption)
The  Government alleged  in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for clearance
because  he  abuses intoxicants  to  excess. He  admitted  in part and  denied  in part SOR
2.a. He denied SOR 2.b and 2.c with  explanations.
Applicant has consumed alcohol on an occasional basis since 2006. Occasionally
he has used alcohol to excess in terms of binge drinking. In 2010 he would drink a bottle
of liquor every two weeks or so when he was depressed. Applicant testified that he last
drank what he considers a binge amount of alcohol in early 2022. (Tr. 27-29, 36.)
On at least two occasions Applicant consumed alcohol and took pills in aborted
suicide  attempts.  Binge  drinking  was  also  related  to  occasions  when  he  would  have
obsessional  thoughts  about  suicide.  These  incidents  continued  through  at  least  2014.
(Government Exhibit 9 at 45, 73, 78-79; Tr. 28-30.)
Applicant  admitted  that  in  2019  the  VA  recommended  that  he  attend  alcohol
treatment. Applicant declined the offer because of work-related concerns and concerns
related  to  a  previous  psychiatric  hospitalization.  He  admitted  that  treatment  may  have
been recommended to him in approximately 2016. He further testified that he does not
feel  he  has  an  alcohol  problem.  In  his  2016  questionnaire  he  stated,  “Treatment  was
suggested but never became required. Since I knew the situation was manageable, I did
not take action to seek treatment.” (Government Exhibit 2 at Section 24; Attachment G;
Tr. 38-40.)
Applicant told the DoD mental health consultant that he had three binge drinking
episodes  in  2019.  Based  on  his  evaluation  the  consultant  diagnosed  Applicant  with
Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild. (Government Exhibit 6 at 6-7, 9-10.)
Mitigation
Applicant  was elected as a member of his local school board  in 2020. His  term
expires in 2024, unless he decides to run for reelection. He finds this job very fulfilling. In
his  Answer  at  page  2  he  stated,  “Dealing  with  personnel,  financial,  and  educational
matters that affect parents, students, faculty, and the surrounding community requires a
high-degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.” He further testified about serving
on the school board, “Something I can engage in with the community is always helpful. I
think it makes me feel a part of something more involved.” (Tr. 43-44.)
Applicant’s  department  manager  submitted   a   letter  on   his  behalf.   The   manager
has known Applicant since   2016,  when  Applicant began  work  there. The  writer  stated,
“Since  the  moment I met [Applicant],  he  has  always conducted  himself in a  professional
and courteous manner and  has been  a privilege to work with, he  has a strong work ethic
and   has  always  worked  well with   leadership  and   his colleagues.”  (Applicant Exhibit  A.)
(See   the   department   manager’s  interview   with   the   DoD  mental  health   consultant,
Government Exhibit 6  at 9.)
Applicant’s group  supervisor submitted  a  letter. He has also known  Applicant  for
six years. He stated:
[Applicant]   inspires  the   team   with   his  extraordinary  work  ethic  and
innovative  solutions  he  brings  to  our work. He is someone  who  projects a
real  sense   of  self-confidence   and   assurance,  without   coming   across  as
arrogant or dismissive  of others. [Applicant] is someone  I can  trust to  rise  to
challenges  and   deal  with   difficult  situations.  As  I  grew  into   my  current
position   as   the  supervisor of   the  group, [Applicant’s] behavior has stayed
consistent   throughout,   making   it   easy   to   earn  my   trust.  (Applicant  Exhibit
B.)

Mental Health Treatment
Military Behavioral Health Center
Applicant  sought  treatment  at  the  military  behavioral  health  center  in  about
October 2014. His medical records indicate that he felt targeted by his squadron since
he received an Article 15. He was attempting to use a program that would allow him to
transfer  from  active  duty  to  the  reserve.  He  appeared  desperate  to  use  any  means  to
get  off  active  duty.  He  reported  that  he  often  became  so  angry  that  he  could  feel  his
temperature  rise.  He  was  provided  an  anger  management  notebook  and  given
homework.  He  did  not  complete  the  assigned  homework.  He  did  not  appear  for  two
appointments, and a termination note was completed in March 2015.  (Tr. at 36-38, 68;

Applicant  returned  to  treatment  at  the  military  behavioral  health  center  in  June
2015. His parents were both diagnosed with cancer, and his mother has since passed
away. His mother was visiting, and his family had an “intervention” with him and told him
how different he had become. Applicant reported that he was having increased anxiety,
social  withdrawal,   increased   depressed   mood,  hypersensitivity  to   surroundings,  and
severe  nightmares  with   homicidal  themes  of  killing   his  family  members.  He   denied
suicidal or  homicidal ideation, plan,  or  intent. He  noted  that  he  “jokes” on  occasion  to  his
wife about shooting  himself,  and he  placed a gun to his head at one point, but he  denied
that  he  had  any  active  thoughts  to  end  his  life. His  wife   removed  all weapons  from  the
home.  He  thought  that  inpatient  psychiatric treatment would be  helpful to  him.   He was
voluntarily admitted  to  a  civilian  inpatient  psychiatric hospital the  next day on  June  10,
2015.  (Tr. at 39-42, 68-70, 75, 77; Applicant’s response to SOR;  GE  1-3; AE B)
Inpatient Treatment
Applicant was an inpatient at a civilian psychiatric hospital from June 10, 2015, to
June  22,  2015.  His  discharge  diagnosis  was  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD),  single
episode,  moderate  to  severe,  with  mild  psychotic  symptoms;  posttraumatic  stress
to
disorder  (PTSD);  generalized  anxiety  disorder  (GAD);
depression  and  anxiety;  partner  relational  problems,  moderate;  and  job-related
problems. (Tr. at 41-42, 70; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4, 5; AE B, K)

Applicant  was  prescribed  medication  at  the  hospital  and  for  his  aftercare.  The
hospital reported:
In   combination   with   individual,   group,   and   milieu   activities   his  mood   and
outlook  significantly  improved.   He  was   very  much   engaged   in   treatment,
and   by  discharge   he   was  no   longer  having   any  further  depressive,
suicidal,  or  homicidal  ideations.  He  was  compliant  with   medications  and
had   no   side   effects.   His  aftercare   was   coordinated   with   [military  base}
representatives.  (GE 5)
Military Behavioral Health Center
Applicant  received  treatment  at  the  military  behavioral  health  center  after  his
discharge  from  the  civilian  hospital.  (Tr.  at  43-44,  73)  His  medical  records  show  the
following clinical impression/summary:
The  patient voluntarily  presented  for medication  management after recent
hospitalization  for depression, anxiety, and  nightmares.  He  was  diagnosed
with   MDD,  GAD,   and   PTSD  at  the   inpatient   facility;  however,   the   patient
does   not  spontaneously  offer   sufficient   symptoms   to   meet  criteria   for
PTSD or GAD. Further, the  depressive symptoms he  reports appear  to  be
directly tied  to  work-related  stress,  and  the  patient  has previously  divulged
a  belief that  his symptoms would  be  entirely resolved  if  he  were  removed
from   the   work  environment.  Psychological  testing   has   demonstrated
symptom  exaggeration  and/or feigning  on  tests (SIMS,  MMPI [invalid  due
to  over-endorsement], MCMI  [valid  but demonstrated  over-endorsement]).
Diagnostically,   these   results  complicate   the   clinical   picture  and   render  it
difficult  to   determine   what,   if  anything,   he   endorses  can   or  should  be
targeted  by treatment.  The  patient continues  to  maintain that his report is

likely  does   experience   some   degree   of
psychological distress,  but it appears that this distress is the  result of poor
coping   and   maladaptive   personality
instability,
inappropriate  and  intense  anger, recurrent suicidality). He  was started  on
his  current  medication   regimen   while   inpatient.   We   will   continue   these
medications  for  now,  as  we  continue   to   gather  data   and   determine   what
symptoms   are   truly  present  and   amenable   to   treatment.   Regarding   the
personality features, it is likely that the  use of quetiapine can target anxiety
and  sleep  disturbance,  and  prazosin  can  decrease  autonomic arousal. We
will  add  a  small  daytime  dose  to  see if this  alleviates  his endorsement of
significant   daytime   hyperarousal.  Other  medication   changes   will  be
deferred  until diagnostic clarity can  be  attained. He  does not  present with
acute  safety concerns and  is appropriate  for outpatient management.  (GE

The  DSM-5  diagnoses  were  unspecified  personality  disorder,  malingering,  and
rule  out  adjustment  disorder  with  mixed  anxiety  and  depressed  mood.  Under  the  risk
assessment section, which primarily dealt with suicide and homicide, the medical record
reported:
Hospitalization  is  not  deemed  necessary at this time, as the  patient does
not   present  a   clear  or  imminent  danger   to   self   or  others.  There   is  no
current
level   of   care.   Outpatient
management  is  currently   most  appropriate   and   least  restrictive   level  of
care. The  patient  is  deemed  to  be  a  reliable reporter and  is  competent  to
make healthcare decisions. (emphasis in original)  (GE 3)

Applicant  went  on  terminal  leave  shortly  after  the  last  entry.  He  was  honorably
discharged as an E-4. The reason for the discharge was reduction in force because of

Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. at 34, 45, 67, 74-75, 81; GE 1, 2; AE B, F)
VA Treatment
Applicant  worked  in  Afghanistan  from  about  January  2016  to  June  2016.  He
returned  to  Afghanistan  in  about  July  2016.  From  2016  to  2018,  he  worked  in
Afghanistan seven times. He has received counseling and treatment from the VA since
2016.  Applicant  stated  that  it  is  for  PTSD,  anxiety,  and  depression.  He  would  see  the
therapist  when  he  was  in  the  United  States.  The  VA  reported  that  he  was  seen  for  a
total  of  32  visits  from  August  2018  to  September  2019  for  PTSD-related  issues.  His
treatment  at  that  facility  concluded  because  he  moved  to  another  state.  (Tr.  at  47-51,
80; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6; AE B, L)
Applicant  has  been  treated  at  the  VA  at  his current  location  since  2019.  (Tr.  at
52AE J, M, O) The VA psychiatrist reported:
Again,  he  has shown consistency while  dutifully fulfilling  his obligations as
a   patient.  This  includes  good   attendance   with   scheduled   appointments,
being   truthful  and   forthcoming   when   expressing   his  concerns,  and
cooperating  and  adhering  to  the  agreed-upon  treatment plan. Throughout
this time, he   has not  demonstrated  any  disruptive   behaviors to   myself  or
clinic staff. [Applicant]  has been a  model patient in our clinic.  (AE  N)
Applicant  stated  that  his  mental  health  is  stable.  He  sees  the  VA  psychiatrist
once a month. He takes his medication. He has coping mechanisms, such as going to
the gym, listening to music and going to the dog park.  He finds it helpful to talk with a
friend who was also a sensor operator. The friend understands what they dealt with. He
credibly stated that he will seek additional help  if he needs it. (Tr. at 55, 58-63, 78-79,
82)
DOD CAF Psychological Evaluation - July  2021
The DOD CAF requested that Applicant undergo a psychological evaluation. The
evaluation  was  conducted  on  July  16,  2021,  by  a  licensed  psychologist  (hereinafter
referred to as psychologist or DOD CAF psychologist) who was contracted from private
practice  by  the  DOD  CAF.  A  report  of  the  evaluation  was  prepared  on  July  26,  2021.
(GE 7)
The  psychologist  utilized  a  clinical
interview,  self-report  questionnaires,
structured  personality  assessment  (Minnesota  Multiphasic  Personality  Inventory-2
Restructured  Form-MMPI-2-RF),  and  medical  records.  The  psychologist  indicated  that
Applicant  “exhibited  a  pattern  of  responding  that  raises  questions  regarding  validity  of
the  results,” and  that Applicant “produced a profile that shows evidence of inconsistent
responding and over-reporting of symptoms throughout the protocol.” (GE 7)
The   psychologist  found   that  based   on   Applicant’s  “presentation   and   recent
history,  his  judgment  and   impulse  control  were  good.   But   there  is  some   evidence   to
suggest  a   history  of   difficulties  with   judgment  and   impulse  control.”  The   diagnostic
impression was:
indicate
inconsistencies   regarding
interview,   review  of  his  medical  records,   and   self-report
Clinical
questionnaires,
the   presence   or
absence  of  current psychiatric symptoms. Review of his completed  MMPI-
2-RF   shows  [Applicant]   answered   all   questions  on   the   assessment
measure,  but   exhibited   a   pattern  of  responding   that  raises   questions
regarding  validity  of  the  results. [Applicant]  produced  a  profile that  shows
evidence   of  inconsistent   responding   and   over-reporting   of  symptoms
throughout the  protocol. While  there are  elevations on  a  number of  clinical
scales,   including   somatic/cognitive   dysfunction,  emotional  dysfunction,
thought  dysfunction,  interpersonal  functioning   scales  and   interest   scales,
there   is  sufficient  evidence   to   suggest   these   results  are  invalid   and   not
interpretable  at  this  time.   Of   note,  this  pattern  of   inconsistent   responding
and   over-reporting   of   symptoms  is  consistent  throughout  a   number  of
records  and   may   be   reflective   of   a   personality  disorder  or   other   chronic
disorder;  additional  evaluation   is  recommended   if  [Applicant]   would  be
interested in  treatment to address these concerns.
Regarding   [Applicant’s]  self-report  questionnaires,   there   is   evidence   to
suggest  the   presence   of  psychiatric  symptoms.  However,  based   on   the
results  of  the   validity   scales  of  the   MMPI-2-RF   indicating   inconsistent
responding  and  over-reporting  of symptoms,  the  accuracy of [Applicant’s]
self-report measures should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  . .  . Based  on  his
MMPI-2-RF   and   self-report  measures,   [Applicant]   does  appear  to   be
experiencing   clinical  distress,  but  due   to   questions  regarding   validity  and
inconsistency  between   the   clinical  interview  and   self-report   measures,  a
specific diagnostic impression is not available at this time. (GE 7)
In the summary and prognosis section, the psychologist wrote:
As  a   result   of  the   above   assessment,   it  is   the   undersigned   clinician’s
opinion  that [Applicant’s] judgment,   reliability, and  trustworthiness are not
appropriately  intact,   as  evidenced   by  inconsistencies  in  the   clinical
interview,  self-report  measures,   patient  history,  and   review   of  records.
Based  on  a  review of National Security Adjudicative Guidelines and  DoD
Personnel  Security  Policy,  there  is  evidence   to   suggest  [Applicant]
displays  a   pattern   of   being   unreliable   with   his  behavior,  which   would
impair  his  judgment,  reliability, and  ability to  properly safeguard classified
national  security  information.   It   is  recommended   [Applicant]   engage   in   a
thorough personality assessment to  determine  the  presence  or absence of
characterological   conditions  and   engage   in   evidence-based   treatment  to
address his difficulties with self and  others.  (GE 7)
The  psychologist  then  listed  as  the  DSM-5  diagnosis,  “Unspecified  Personality
Disorder.” (GE 7)
Applicant’s  Psychological Evaluation - February  2022
Applicant  sought  his  own  evaluation  from  a  licensed  clinical  psychologist
(hereinafter psychologist or Applicant’s  psychologist) in February 2022. The diagnoses
were  posttraumatic  stress  disorder,  chronic;  generalized  anxiety  disorder;  and
dependent,  compulsive,  and  avoidant  personality  traits.  The  psychologist  provided  the
following diagnostic impressions:
[Applicant]   reports   a   history  of   multiple   mood   disorders,  including
depression, bipolar disorder (unknown type), anxiety, and  PTSD. There is
also  a   past  diagnosis   of  unspecified   personality   disorder;  however,  the
applicant  feels  this  was  a   misdiagnosis  and   the   problematic  traits  were
actually symptoms of untreated  bipolar disorder. He stated  that he  is now
being treated  effectively for bipolar disorder by a psychiatrist.
Based   on   my  clinical   interview  of  the   applicant,   it   is  plausible   that  he
suffers  from   manic  depression;  however,  his  insomnia  may   have   also
been   due   to   other  factors,  including   varied   work  shifts,   nightmares,
anxiety,  and  other symptoms of PTSD.  During  this examination,  he  did not
describe  any manic behaviors, other  than  insomnia. His psychological  test
results do  not  suggest  bipolar disorder,  but do  indicate  a  moderate  level of
ongoing   anxiety.  Dependent,   compulsive,  and   avoidant  personality  traits
are  also   noted  on  the  MCMI-IV,  which  may  be   the   traits   implied  by  other
clinicians under the  vague  diagnosis  of  “unspecified  personality  disorder.”
Still, it should be noted that I have  not reviewed those providers’ records.
Regardless   of   the   exact  diagnoses   in  this  case,   it  is   apparent  that
[Applicant’s]   symptoms  are
largely   under  control   with   his   current
medication   regimen,  even   while  working   in  the   same   field  that  led   to   his
initial  psychiatric  treatment.   He  is  aware   of  his  chronic  mental  health
that  he   will   require   ongoing   medicinal
issues,  and   acknowledges
treatment.  He indicated  that is open  to  returning  to  therapy, if needed. He
stated  that he  is asymptomatic at this time  and  has a  good  social  support
system.  His home  life  is stable now that  he  is divorced  and he  has  custody
of his children. He  maintained  that  he  will  remain  compliant with  any and
all treatment modalities, as  needed. He  does  not  feel he  needs counseling
at this time.
Empirical  data   suggest  that   individuals  with   chronic  mood   disorders  and
personality  disorders   should
(therapy  and/or
pharmacotherapy)  as   long   as  symptomatic.  If   [Applicant]   follows   these
guidelines,  my  clinical  opinion   in   this  case   is  that  he   would   have   a   fair
prognosis.  (AE  L)

Character  Evidence
Applicant  is  active  in  his  children’s  lives,  and  he  volunteers  in  his  community,
including  coaching  youth  sports.  He  called  witnesses  and  submitted  documents  and

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
Major Depressive Disorder
The  criterion  symptoms  for  major  depressive  disorder  must  be  present  nearly
every  day  to  be  considered  present,  with  the  exception  of  weight  change  and  suicidal
ideation.  Fatigue  and  sleep  disturbance  are  present  in  a  high  proportion  of  cases;
psychomotor disturbances  are much  less common but are  indicative  of greater overall
severity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt.
The  essential  feature  of  a  major  depressive  episode  is  a  period  of  at  least  two
weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in
nearly  all  activities.  Many  individuals  report  or  exhibit  increased  irritability  (e.g.,
persistent  anger,  a  tendency  to  respond  to  events  with  angry  outbursts  or  blaming
others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor events).
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
The  essential  feature  of  PTSD  is  the  development  of  characteristic  symptoms
following  exposure  to  one  or  more  traumatic  events.  Individuals  with  PTSD  may  be
quick  tempered  and  may  even  engage  in  aggressive  verbal  and/or  physical  behavior
with  little  or  no  provocation.  They  may  also  engage  in  reckless  or  self-destructive
behavior such as dangerous driving, excessive alcohol or drug use, or self injurious or
suicidal behavior.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder
The  key  feature  of  generalized  anxiety  disorders  is  persistent  and  excessive
anxiety and worry about various domains, including work and school performance, that
the individual finds difficult to control.
Personality Disorder
The  general  definition  of  personality  disorder  that  applies  to  each  of  the  ten
specific personality disorders is “an  enduring  pattern of inner experience and behavior
that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture, is pervasive and
inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads
to  distress  or  impairment.”  Unspecified  personality  disorder  is  used  when  “symptoms
characteristic  of  a  personality  disorder  that  cause  clinically  significant  distress  or
impairment  in  social,  occupational,  or  other  important  area  of  functioning  predominate
but  do  not  meet  the  full  criteria  for  any  of  the  disorders  in  the  personality  disorders
diagnostic class.”
",True
"Applicant  is  62  years  old,  divorced,  and  has  three  adult  children.  He  earned  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  1989.  He  has  worked  as  an  engineer  for  his  security  clearance
sponsor  since  September 2020. Applicant has  held a  secret  clearance  for most  of  the
period  from  1992  to  the  present.  He  seeks  to  retain his security  clearance  eligibility  in
connection with his employment. (Tr. at 13-15; GE 1 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 17, 18, and
25, AE E.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption
The  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a  security  clearance
because he has a long history of excessive alcohol consumption and he failed to follow
treatment advice after he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (severe). In his Answer
Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d and 1.f and 1.g, and he admitted in part and
denied in part SOR ¶ 1.e. He provided additional information to clarify his admissions to
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g.
The  details  of  each  of  the  SOR  allegations  and  related  record  evidence  is  as
follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a   2007   arrest  and   charge   for  Driving   Under  the   Influence   -  Alcohol.
Applicant has little recollection of what happened the night of his arrest aside from waking
up  in  the  county  jail’s  “drunk  tank.”  In  an  interview  in  connection  with  a  prior  security
clearance investigation, he disclosed that he hit a pedestrian in an intersection. He told
the  investigator  that  there  were  no  injuries.  He  pled  no  contest  to  Driving  Under  the
Influence - Alcohol (DUI) and was sentenced to five years of probation. (Tr. at 15, 22-23;
GE 1, Sections 22, 24; GE 3 at 25; GE 4 at 1-2; GE 5 at 3.)
SOR ¶ 1.b  March  to  May 2010  outpatient counseling  for condition  diagnosed  as
alcohol dependence.  Applicant was terminated from a job in early 2010 for showing up
for  work  intoxicated.  He  voluntarily  admitted  himself  into  this  two-month  outpatient
program. He fully complied with the conditions of the program. Appellant started drinking
alcohol when he was in his forties. He started drinking more heavily in the 2007 to 2010
period. In the outpatient program, he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent (Tr. at 15-16,
28-29; GE 3 at 9, 25.)
SOR  ¶  1.c   September  to   October  2010   inpatient  treatment  for   a   condition
diagnosed  as  alcohol dependence. Applicant’s marriage “fell apart” in 2010 when he and
his wife separated, and the stress following the breakup caused Applicant to relapse and
start drinking excessively again. He voluntarily admitted himself into a 30-day inpatient
treatment program. (Tr. at 16-17, 29-33; GE 1, Section 24.)
SOR  ¶  1.d   Between   2010   and   June   2015,   multiple  periods  of  inpatient  and
outpatient  treatment  for  a   condition   diagnosed   as  alcohol   dependence.  Applicant  had
periods of sobriety after his 2010 inpatient treatment. The longest was about 18 months.
He  had  several  relapses.  Sometimes  he  voluntarily  entered  an  inpatient  treatment
program for about seven days, and on other occasions he decided to pursue outpatient
treatment. He stated that he was not taking his condition seriously and did not realize that
he had crossed the line between being a social drinker into being an alcoholic. He did not
appreciate the seriousness of the disease of alcoholism. Applicant and his wife divorced
in January 2014. (Tr. at 17; 32-33; GE 1, Sections 17, 24.)
SOR  ¶  1.e   May  2014   arrest  and   charges  with   DUI  and   Failure  to   Stop   after  an
Accident. Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and Failure to Stop, as alleged in
the SOR. He denied, however, the allegation that he was sentenced to four days in jail.
He testified that after his arrest he was put in the “drunk tank” overnight until he regained
his sobriety and then was released.  The  FBI report and  the  local sheriff’s report in  the
record support the allegation that he was sentenced to four days in jail. He described the
incident as a relapse and after drinking alcohol he drove to a store to buy groceries. He
had a minor accident and, due to the nature of the incident, he pulled his car into a parking
space to get his car off the road. The police treated his actions as a “hit and  run.” This
charge was eventually dropped. He testified that the accident was caused by the careless
driving of the other party involved, but Applicant took full responsibility for the accident
because  he  was  intoxicated.  His  BAC  was  0.19%.  He  plead  guilty  to  DUI  and  was
sentenced to five years of probation. He believes that the reference in his criminal record
to  five  days  in  jail  may  have  been  a  suspended  sentence.  He  was  also  sentenced  to
attend an 18-month alcohol education program. He fully complied with the terms of his
sentence. He voluntarily entered an outpatient treatment program, as described in SOR
¶ 1.d, above. (Tr. at 17-18, 23, 33-39; GE 1, Sections 22, 24; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 6, 24;
GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 5.)
SOR ¶ 1.f  August to  September 2017  inpatient treatment  for conditions  diagnosed
as Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe) and  Depression. Applicant testified that his depression
was not long-term, but rather was “incidental to  the  alcohol.” He was depressed  by  his
living conditions in a desert area that was not agreeable to him and his lingering negative
feelings following his divorce.  He was experiencing stress related to his job and family
situation. His abuse of alcohol also acted as a depressant. He voluntarily entered into a
30-day inpatient program. He testified that at this point, his longest period of sobriety was
sixteen months, starting in January 2016 and ending in May 2017. He was discharged
with  a  diagnosis  of  Substance  Abuse  Disorder  –  Alcohol,  Severe  with  a  co-occurring
mental  disorder  of  Depression.  He  was  given  a  guarded  prognosis.  After  he  left  the
treatment facility in September 2017, he relocated to another city and lived in a shared
community home that was dedicated to alcohol-free living. He did well there until 2019
when he had a relapse and lost his job due to his failure to contact his supervisor and to
show up for work. (Tr. at 18-19, 42-50; GE 1, Section 24; GE 2 at 2-3; GE 3 at 9; GE 7 at
7-8.)
SOR ¶ 1.g  January to  February 2021  inpatient treatment for conditions diagnosed
as Alcohol Use Disorder (Moderate  or Severe) and  Major Depressive  Disorder (Single
Episode,  Severe).  Applicant  had  a  “short  relapse”  in  January  2021.  He  voluntarily
checked himself into an inpatient program. He was intoxicated at the time, and his BAC
measured at 0.183%. He only intended to stay long enough to detox. The SOR allegation
stated  that  he  left  the  treatment  facility  before  completing  his  Continuing  Recovery
Discharge Plan. He explained that was true, but his early departure from the program was
the result of a misunderstanding. Due to his intoxicated condition at the time he entered
the program, he did not understand that he was expected to remain at the facility for 30
days. He could not stay there for more than a brief period because that would have kept
him away from his new job. He stayed for about five days; long enough, in his view, to
safely  detox  from  his  condition.  The  treatment  facility’s  discharge  summary  lists
Applicant’s  diagnosis  on  arrival  was  Alcohol  Intoxication  with  moderate  or  severe  use
disorder.  The  summary  reflects  that  he  made  no  progress  in  treatment  and  left  the
program before any planning could be done or any referrals provided. Applicant failed to
list this treatment in his February 5, 2021 e-QIP because he was tired of filling out the e-
QIP and he felt that the treatment was not significant, rather it was just a “quick detox.”
(Tr. at 19, 51-58, 66; GE 3 at 10; GE 6 at 1, 18.)
The last time Applicant drank alcohol was in July 2022. He purchased alcohol and
consumed it at his residence. He was not fully engaged in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) at
the time. He described his attendance at AA meetings prior to July 2022 as “spotty.”  As
a  result of  his relapse, he  was required  to renew his sobriety  date at  AA.  On  May  26,
2022, Applicant signed a statement “under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United
States that he intended to never drink alcohol again and never to drive after drinking. His
statement  also  expressed  his  understanding  that  “any  inappropriate  involvement  with
alcohol use may be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.” At the hearing
in  December  2022,  Applicant  strongly  emphasized  this  he  wants  “to  lick  this  thing,”
referring to his alcoholism, and to live an alcohol-free life. This is his top priority now. He
feels that his alcoholism is ruining his life, his health, and possibly his career. (Tr. at 53,
55-65; AE A.)
Paragraph 2, Guideline I, Psychological Conditions
The Government cross-alleged under Guideline I the SOR allegations set forth in
¶¶ 1.b through 1.d, 1.f and 1.g. Applicant did not separately respond to these allegations
in his Answer.
Mitigation
Applicant described  his  alcohol consumption,  until he  was  about  45,  as social.    He
blames the  beginning  of his excessive  drinking  on  his  “bad  marriage.” He  was  opposed
to  divorcing  for religious reasons. Instead,  he turned  to  alcohol.  Applicant acknowledged
that   he   is   an   alcoholic.  He   now   attends   meetings  of   Alcoholics  Anonymous   (AA)   most
mornings, and  he  intends to  continue  to  do  so. He has  a  sponsor. Applicant believes  that
alcohol is a  “tricky disease,” because  it misleads you  to  believing  that it is not a  disease
and  is not a  problem.  It has taken  him  a  long  time  to  realize  that he  is an  alcoholic and
that he  needs to  do  whatever the  AA  program  requires. He is actively involved  in the  AA
12-step  program. He  is  presently at Step  8. He  intends  to  actively participate  in  AA  for the
rest   of  his  life.  He  rents   a   room   from   an   individual  who   is  also  in  AA.  They  have   an
agreement that  there will  be  no  drinking  of alcohol in  the  residence. Applicant  explained
that he  has now fully accepted  his disease  of  alcoholism  and  treats his disease  with  AA
and by seriously practicing  his religious faith. He also receives counseling  from  the  pastor
at his church. He understands now that he can no longer turn to alcohol to help him  deal
with  stress in his life.  After his last  relapse  he  has a  new sponsor. He speaks  with  the
sponsor weekly.  His prior sponsor lived  too  far from  Applicant, and  he  recommended  to
Applicant that he  should find  a  sponsor who  lives near Applicant. (Tr. at 16-17, 19-24, 27,
60-61; AE  I.)
Applicant’s  AA  sponsor  wrote  in  a  character reference  letter  that  he  has  known
Applicant  for  about  six  years  through  their  attendance  at  AA  meetings.  He  praised
Applicant for “reworking” the 12 steps of AA. He commented that Applicant has held an
administrative  position  in  his church and now  has  a  similar position  with  a  social club.
Applicant  also  submitted  four  other  character  reference  letters.  His  former  sponsor,  a
former  neighbor,  a  former  supervisor,  and  his  church  pastor  all  praised  Applicant’s
character and his dedication to maintaining sobriety. (AE C; AE I.)
",False
"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c, with clarifications.
His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  44  years  old.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  is  working  on  a
master’s  degree.  He  was  married  from  2004  to  2014.  He  has  two  children  from  the
marriage, ages 24 and 15. He has shared custody of the younger child, who lives with
him. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since 2017 and has
held  a  security  clearance  during  his  employment.  He  has  owned  his  own  home  since
2020. (Tr. 30-32, 49-50
Applicant  began  his  military  service  with  the  Army  National  Guard  in  2004  and
transferred to  the regular Army where he  served until he was honorably discharged  in
March  2012.  He  was  involved  in  combat  operations  in  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom  from
October 2009 to October 2010. He is authorized to wear the Army Commendation Medal,
Army Achievement Medal, Meritorious Unit Commendation, Army Good Conduct Medal,
National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service
Ribbon, and the Overseas Service Ribbon. (Tr. 32-35, 55-56; GE 1; AE E)
In 2012, while still in the Army, Applicant was diagnosed with post traumatic stress
disorder  (PTSD).  He  was  experiencing  depression  and  suicidal  ideations  due  to  his
combat experiences and a struggling marriage. He had been trained to seek help and
guidance from his chain of command if he needed it or felt suicidal. He sought help and
was referred to the mental health clinic at the military hospital. He self-admitted for in-
patient mental health care. He was there a few days and was released with instructions
on how to cope with his negative feelings from combat operations which resulted in PTSD.
He was attending both group and individual therapy through Veterans Affairs (VA) through
2016. (SOR 1.a). (Tr. 35-37, 56, 75-77)
In 2016, Applicant was struggling again with depression and suicidal ideations after
his  divorce,  toxic  romantic  relationships,  and  multiple  periods  of  unemployment.  He
acknowledged that during  this time he had an altercation with his former girlfriend who
was unfaithful. He was arrested and charged with battery and destruction of property. His
case  was  adjudicated  in  the  state’s  veteran  court.  He  completed  all  the  terms  and
requirements imposed and the charges were dismissed. (Tr. 39-41, 57, 60, 78-82)
During  that  time,  Applicant  self-reported  that  he  was  struggling  and  voluntarily
admitted himself for inpatient treatment.  He participated in counseling and therapy.  He
learned new coping techniques and skills for his PTSD, which he has continued to apply
to  the  present.  At  the  time  of  the  incident  with  his  girlfriend,  the  medication  he  was
prescribed was not helping his PTSD. After inpatient treatment, he was prescribed a new
medication, which is effective, and he continues to take it. (Tr. 36-39, 60-61)
In  October  2020,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  government-approved  licensed
psychologist  (LP)  during  a  virtual  telemedicine  appointment.  Based  on  background
information,  clinical  interview,  observations,  and  a  psychological  test,  Applicant  was
diagnosed with PTSD. LP reported in her evaluation and findings for his mental status
and behavioral observations that he had good insight and appeared open and honest in
his  report.  She  also  noted  that  his  psychological  test  results  suggested  a  degree  of
defensiveness in his responses. She said, “Given this positive impressive management,
the  information  garnered  upon  interview  and  his  test  results  may  be  an  inaccurate
representation  of  the  applicant’s  current  mental  health  status,  likely  underestimating
concerns.” (GE 2)
LP had Applicant complete a personality assessment inventory (PAI). She noted
problem  areas  that  could  merit  further  inquiry,  such  as  a  high  level  of  defensiveness,
which could likely reflect significant distortion, and minimization of difficulties in certain
areas. She opined that regardless of the cause, the PAI results are unlikely to be a valid
reflection  of  his  current  experience  and  mental  health  status.  She  said  that  all  clinical
scales fell within the normal limits, with no elevations suggesting a psychological disorder.
(GE 2)
LP  noted  that  Applicant  appeared  to  have  a  generally  stable  and  positive  self-
evaluation, which are valuable characteristics because they allow him to be resilient and
adaptive  in  the  face  of  most  stressors.  Further  she  stated  that  Applicant’s  social
environment, with respect to perceived stressor and the availability of social support with
which to deal the stressors, and his responses indicated that both his recent level of stress
and  his  perceived  level  of  social  support  are  about  average  in  comparison  to  normal
adults. She opined, “The reasonably low stress environment and the intact social support
system are both favorable prognostic signs for future adjustment.” (GE 2)
LP  said  that  Applicant’s  reported  mood  swings  that  ranged  from  “fine”  to
“depressed” had significantly improved. He was compliant with his medication and did not
have recent suicidal ideations. She said:
He does appear to have good insight into his symptoms and overall mental
health status, seeking treatment when needed and advocating for his own
mental health. In addition, the legal concerns. . . have been resolved and
he is actually now volunteering with the veterans’ treatment court. (GE 2)
LP’s concerns were due to Applicant’s psychological testing being rendered invalid
due  to  indications  of  defensiveness/positive  impression  management.  She  said  that
Applicant’s scores showed  problems of  greater intensity that those  of typical defensive
respondents.  The  problems  areas  were  moodiness,  poor  control  over  anger,  and
unsupportive  family  and  friends.  Because  of  this  defensive  psychological  profile,  she
opined that “there were apparent limitations to [Applicant’s] reliability, stability and good
judgment.”  She  concluded,  “Therefore,  although  his  mental  health  status  is  presently
stable  and  he  appeared  to  be  forthright  and  honest  in  his  interview,  his  prognosis  is
considered guarded.” (GE 2)
In September 2021, Applicant sought another opinion regarding his mental health
status. He was seen by a psychiatrist. Applicant said he told the psychiatrist his whole
history,  his treatment,  including  medications he  has  taken.  He testified  the psychiatrist
said  his  current  treatment  was  effective.  He  provided  an  assessment  report  from  the
psychiatrist diagnosing him with PTSD, chronic; other long term (current) drug therapy;
and other psychosocial and environmental problems. The psychiatrist opined: “We don’t
see any reason today that the patient should not maintain his security clearance.” (Tr. 42,
66; AE A)
In January 2023, Applicant sought a more recent mental health evaluation, and it
was conduct by a licensed psychologist, Dr. F. He used data from clinical and collateral
interviews; general and behavioral observations; checklist of adaptive living skills; mental
status  examination;  mini-mental  state  examination;  Wechsler  Abbreviated  Scale  of
Intelligence; wide range achievement test; Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test; SPECTRA
Indices of Psychopathology; and Combat Exposure Scale. (Tr. 67-68; AE J)
Applicant provided Dr. F with a history of his background consistent with what was
provided to LP and the psychiatrist. Applicant testified that he discussed with DR. F his
previous  diagnoses.  Numerous  psychological  tests  were  administered,  and  he  was
interviewed. Dr. F’s conclusions were that Applicant did not have any learning disorders
which  could  impact  the  tests.  There  were  no  indications  that  Applicant  experiences
significant neuropsychological impairment.  He  did score “moderate-to-heavy” exposure
to  combat  fire,  consistent  with  notable  PTSD  symptoms.  His  responses  on  a
comprehensive, standardized inventory of adult psychopathology “suggested significant
high  levels  of  PTSD  symptoms,  moderate  anxiety,  and  notable  grandiose  ideation
suggestive  of  high  self-esteem  and  confidence.”  There  was  no  evidence  of  significant
depression, alcohol or drug use, aggression, paranoia, psychosis, anti-social tendencies,
obsessions  or  compulsions,  mania,  cognitive  dysfunction,  psychosocial  impairment,  or
suicidal ideation. Dr. F opined: “Evaluative findings suggest [Applicant] can learn, execute
and perform duties within his scope of comprehension without reservation or difficulty.”
(Tr. 47-49; AE J)
Applicant disclosed both mental health incidents and his arrest on his July 2017
security clearance application (SCA). He credibly testified that he has been treated for
PTSD since his military discharge. Through his treatment, he has learned valuable coping
skills and is cognizant of emotional triggers that may affect his judgment or mental well-
being.  He  remains  on  medication  and  is  compliant.  He  sees  his doctor annually  to  be
evaluated for his medication regime and mental health status updates. He has learned
coping skills and has hobbies that help him. He is aware of options if he feels the need to
seek help, such as the Veterans’ Affairs hotline, members of his family,  his ex-wife with
whom he remains close, and other veterans’ services. He has not had any mental health
issues  since  2016.  He  has  been  open  and  honest  with  his employer  about his mental
health, and they are aware of his diagnoses. (Tr. 58-63)
Applicant is involved  in  mentoring  others who  suffer with  PTSD at the  Veterans’
Treatment  Center.  He  has  a  background  in  art,  so  he  volunteers  as  a  teacher  in  art
therapy. He teaches different mediums that help with coping skills. (Tr. 61, 70-72)
Applicant testified that in his current position, he has served as the custodian for
classified hard drives. His office is transitioning to digital. It is evolving technology and he
had to obtain multiple certifications to be compliant. (Tr. 53-54)
Applicant’s former supervisor, who is now retired, testified on his behalf. He is the
person who hired Applicant in 2017. He observed him daily for five years. He stated that
Applicant is conscientious, and when he sees a problem, he fixes it without being told to
do so. He is service-oriented and can be trusted to get the job done without oversight
from  supervisors.  He  is  excellent  with  dealing  customers.  He  was  responsible  for
managing 800-900 classified hard drives. He is responsible for knowing where each hard
drive is located in their physical spaces at all times. His work is independently audited to
ensure the classified hard drives are being properly managed and secured. It is a tedious
and thankless responsibility, and he was hand-picked for it because he understood the
seriousness  of  the  responsibility.  The  witness  personally  selected  Applicant  for  this
responsibility as a replacement for himself. It is the most important job  in the company
because  failure  to  comply  with  the  rules  could  shut  the  site  down.  It  is  a  high-risk
responsibility, and Applicant has completed it flawlessly. (Tr. 16-29)
The witness stated that Applicant told him about his mental health issues and has
been completely honest with him. He was confident that Applicant would report any issues
that he was experiencing, which he thought would impact the job. The witness has no
hesitation at all about Applicant continuing to hold a security clearance and have access
to  classified  information.  He  exercises  sound  judgment  and  can  handle  any  of  the
technical or rules pertaining to classified information. He has not been  involved in any
security  violations,  behavioral  issues,  or  performance  concerns.  He  is  reliable,
trustworthy,  and  exercises  good  judgment.  Applicant  took  over  the  hard  drive
accountability job about four to five months before the witness retired  in late 2021 and
has had sole responsibility for it since then. (Tr. 16-29)
Applicant  provided  character  letters  from  friends,  coworkers,  and  family.  They
stated that Applicant is trustworthy, loyal, dedicated, professional, responsible, valuable,
diligent, and a patriot. His ex-wife who has known him for 28 years stated he is a hard-
worker, goal-oriented, and positive role model for their children. (Tr. 42-44; AE B)

must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,
",True
"Applicant admitted and denied parts of the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.a. He denied the
allegations in SOR ¶ 1.b and 1.c. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  25  years  old.  He  is  not  married  and  has  no  children.  In  2015,  he
received two high school graduation diplomas. One was from his mainstream high school
and another from a high school that specialized in math and science. He graduated from
college in 2019 and then began work for his present employer, a federal contractor. (Tr.
18-19, 21-22; AE E, F)
Applicant  testified  that  looking  back  on  2015,  he  now  believes  he  was  having
mental health issues, but did not know it at the time. He believed he was on the spectrum
for  autism  and  also  had  attention  deficient  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  but  no  one
believed him  because it  was  thought  that  these  two  mental health issues  contradicted
each other. He testified that after he graduated from high school and began his first year
of college, he continued to have issues with autism, ADHD, and he began experiencing
depression.  He  chose  the  specific  college  he  attended  because  it  had  the  major  he
wanted,  which  was  a  specialized  and  highly  challenging  curriculum.  He  did  well  his
freshman and sophomore year. (Tr. 19-21)
In   late   2017,   Applicant’s   junior  year   of  college,  the   curriculum   became   very
demanding,  and  he  began  having  mental health  issues  due  to  stress  and  lack of sleep.
He reached  out  for help. He went to  his college’s health  services  and  was told  because
he  had  medical insurance  through  his parents,  he  needed  to  seek  private  health  services.
He spent months  trying  to  find  medical care  from  a  provider  that  accepted  his parents’
out-of-state  insurance.  He was  on  waiting  lists for different psychiatric providers.  (Tr. 24-
25, 30, 32-34)
Applicant’s  medical  records  reflect  that  sometime  in  2018,  his  friends  at  school
took him to a hospital emergency room because they were concerned about his mental
health. They convinced his parents that he needed treatment and should receive it close
to his home. In May 2018, due to the stresses from school, Applicant  self-referred and
was  hospitalized  for  ten  days.  He  said  he  was  told  by  the  doctor  that  they  could  only
diagnose surface-level issues and not the underlying problems or causes. (Tr. 24-25, 30,
32-34)
Applicant admitted that on three occasions he had attempted suicide and a fourth
time he had a suicide ideation. His first attempt was while in high school and then in 2017
and 2018. He explained that on the outside he appeared to be fine, but what was going
on inside of him was not always apparent. These issues became more pronounced when
external symptoms began to manifest. (Tr. 24-25, 30, 32-34)
Hospital  records  reflect  Applicant  was  not  having  current  homicidal  ideations  at
that time. He testified that he never had homicidal ideations, but he admits that he has
difficulty recalling this period of his hospitalization as that time remains foggy to him. He
credibly testified that he does not deny that he reported homicidal ideations at the time,
but he just could not recall it. He did not believe his ideation was homicidal but did believe
his ideation was violent. His hospital records reflect he did have an episode of homicidal
ideation,  which  involved  holding  someone  against  their  will  so  they  could  watch  him
commit suicide. (Tr. 27-29, 35, 63-69; GE 4).
Applicant was prescribed medication, released from the hospital, and transitioned
to an outpatient psychiatric clinic. His discharge diagnosis was major depressive disorder
recurrent severe with psychotic symptoms. During his outpatient follow-up treatment, he
went through a full-scale psychiatric evaluation with a behavioral therapist and follow-up
appointments.  He  began  seeing  a  psychiatrist  at  a  psychiatric  clinic  who  then  left  the
practice, and his new practice did not take Applicant’s insurance. He was diagnosed with
depression, social anxiety, panic attacks, autism and ADHD. At this point, he began being
treated for ADHD and depression. He then transitioned as a patient to Dr. Z in 2021. Dr.
Z  prescribed  medication  to  help  Applicant’s  mental  health  issues.  Applicant  has  been
compliant. He provided medical records that show since he has been seeing Dr. Z, his
symptoms have stabilized. The medical records also show a progression of improvement
and compliance with medication management. (Tr.25-28, 31, 35-39, 81-83; AE P, Q, R)
Dr. Z’s assessment in April 2021 was major depressive disorder recurrent without
psychotic features, social anxiety disorder, panic attacks, ADHD combined type, history
of mild autism. Medical records show that Applicant consistently followed up with regular
appointments with Dr. Z throughout 2021 and 2022. Dr. Z’s March 2022 report shows the
same diagnostic assessment as the initial one. It also noted that Applicant’s depression
was improving, and they discussed coping skills and acknowledging limitations. His notes
stated that he educates Applicant about the nature of his illness, symptoms, course of
illness and ways to treat and also deal with unwanted consequences of the illness on his
relationships, at work and other functional abilities. Dr. Z’s supportive therapy focused on
improving  self-esteem,  ameliorating  symptoms,  and  maximizing  Applicant’s  adaptive
capabilities  by  encouragement,  education,  guidance,  and  reassurance.  They  also
examined  the  nature  of  relationships  and  emotional  responses  or  behaviors  to  make
Applicant  more  aware.  Applicant’s  progress  towards  his  goals  were  good.  Dr.  Z’s  last
report from September 2022 provides the same assessment and that Applicant has been
compliant  with  his  medication  management.  Medical  records  show  that  Applicant  has
consistently followed up with regular appointments throughout 2022  and his prescribed
medication  is  reviewed  each  time.  Applicant  credibly  testified  that  he  has  been  and
continues to be compliant with his prescribed medication. How often Applicant sees Dr.
Z is dependent on his medical opinion and indications from Applicant about his mental
health. (Tr. 38-41, 81-83; AE P, Q, R)
Applicant testified that Mr. K is his therapist. Mr. K testified he has been a licensed
professional counselor since 2003. Applicant began seeing  Mr. K in late 2017, and he
had weekly appointments. He continued into 2018 and towards the end he saw him every
other week until late 2019 when he saw him monthly. In 2020, due to the pandemic the
appointments were virtual, and he saw him five times. In 2021 he saw him four times. He
saw him twice in 2022, the last time in March. Their sessions are usually an hour long.
They  would  discuss  any  problems  Applicant  was  experiencing  and  potential  solutions.
Mr. K diagnosed Applicant with major depression, moderate, anxiety disorder, and panic
disorder. He is not aware of a present psychotic diagnosis but was aware of a diagnosis
in 2018. (Tr. 30-34, 41-43, 71-73, 106-123)
During their last meeting in March 2022, Mr. K and Applicant jointly decided they
would meet on an as needed basis. Applicant had no major stressor at that time and Mr.
K  told  him  that  he  is welcome  to  reach  out if  he  needed  anything.  This  was  left  up  to
Applicant.  At  their  last  appointment,  Applicant  was  managing  fine  and  there  were  no
depression  symptoms.  Mr.  K  does  not  prescribe  medication.  He  remains  Applicant’s
current therapist. (Tr. 41-43, 106-123)
Applicant  testified  that  he  believes  his  original  diagnosis  that  included  “with
psychosis”  was  because  his  ADHD  was  manifesting  him  being  fixated  on  something,
which is also a symptom of ADHD. (Tr. 58-59)
In  November  2021,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  Dr.  B,  a  licensed  psychologist
approved by DOD. She diagnosed him with major depressive disorder (recurrent, severe),
panic  disorder  without  agoraphobia,  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  and  schizoid
personality traits. She indicated his prognosis was guarded and concluded his reliability,
judgment,  stability,  and  trustworthiness are  in  question.  She  reported  that he had  only
undergone  sporadic  counseling  since  his  2018  hospitalization.  He  required  numerous
alterations in medications due to poor management of symptoms. He had limited social
support and his treatment history was far from appropriate to manage his conditions. She
opined that his psychological tests suggest that he is not willing to make a commitment
to therapy and that he either lacked insight into his past or was unwilling to acknowledge
it, which led her to her poor prognosis. (GE 2)
Dr. B reported she contacted Mr. K. She reported that Applicant saw Mr. K monthly
in 2018 and 2019, but only twice in 2020 and 2021. This is inconsistent with both Mr. K’s
testimony  and  Applicant’s  as  noted  above.  Mr.  K  opined  that  he  had  no  concerns
regarding Applicant from a security perspective, so long as he remained in treatment. (Tr.
71-72; GE 2)
Dr. B reported she contacted Dr. Z’s office to confirm Applicant’s medication and
treatment compliance. His office returned her call a week later and she reported that she
waited for a follow up from Dr. Z, which never materialized. (GE 2)
Applicant testified that he was evaluated through a Zoom meeting with Dr. B. They
talked for less than an hour and then there was an hour of questions, which he said were
focused  on  him  being  schizophrenic.  He  credibly  testified  that  she  was  aggressive
towards  him,  so  he  kept  his  distance  because  he  does  not  like  being  yelled  at.  He
contacted both Dr. Z and Mr. K. to advise them Dr. B would be contacting them. Applicant
testified  that  Dr.  Z  told  him  that  Dr.  B  never  provided  the  appropriate  documentation
required  by  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPPA)  to  release
information. Applicant stated  he did not oppose  Dr.  B  having access  to  his psychiatric
records from Dr. Z. He personally contacted Dr. B after his evaluation because he wanted
to make sure she contacted Dr. Z. She told him she was working on it. Applicant testified
Dr. B was hostile towards him for contacting her about ensuring she contacted Dr. Z. He
stated when he received Dr. B’s report, he analyzed it and concluded her facts “were so
far distant from everything.” (Tr. 45-48)
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  he  would  continue  to  be  compliant  with  Dr.  Z’s
recommendations  and  medicine  management.  He  does  not  want  to  go  back  to  his
previous mental health issues. He likes being a proper functioning member of society. He
continues to see Dr. Z every one to three months as needed. He sees Dr. Z for medication
management and any side effects. He sees Mr. K for therapy and counseling as needed.
He has learned to manage stress through different practices and coping skills. He has
also learned to channel his stress into being more productive at work. He has discussed
this with Mr. K. He does not have any stressor related to his mental health at work or with
his supervisors or coworkers or outside of work. He lives alone but got a rescue dog about
a year ago. He feels he is in a stable environment. He has a strong support system, which
includes his parents, friends, and former and present coworkers. He stated, “I’m just trying
to live my life with this mental health issue and go on existing and do the best I can.” (Tr.
48-49, 51-52, 83-87)
Applicant’s mother testified on his behalf. She stated that she always believed that
he  was  on  the  autism  spectrum,  but  he  did  not  necessarily  fit  the  criterion.  She  also
believed before he was diagnosed that he had ADHD, but he was able to mask it because
he was a good student and also was an Eagle Scout. She described 2018 as a difficult
year  because  it  was  his  junior  year,  which  is  a  demanding  curriculum  for  engineering
majors.  Another  factor  was  that  his  grandfather  passed  away.  She  was  concerned
Applicant was depressed. She went to his school to check on him and observed a major
panic attack. She said it was very difficult to get him mental health treatment because
their insurance was out-of-state, and they did not have a diagnosis at the time. They could
not get an appointment for weeks. She is much more aware of what signs to look for now.
(Tr. 88-105)
Applicant’s mother noted he is now more communicative and is very protective of
his mental health. He is cognizant of the importance of sleep and structure. She believes
in 2018 he was not getting sufficient sleep. He has learned good coping mechanisms and
will contact people for support. She noticed that after his medications stabilized for his
ADHD, he is more resilient to normal stressors. He has progressively gotten better. He
has a lot of trust in the doctor and therapist who are treating him. (Tr. 88-105)
Mr. F is Applicant’s supervisor and testified on his behalf. He has known Applicant
for about five or six years and in the past three years has been his direct supervisor. He
is  aware  of  the  security  concerns  that  were raised,  including  the  suicide  attempts  and
homicide ideation. He is aware of some of Applicant’s nervous habits associated with his
autism  and  has  helped  him  to  develop  better  social  skills.  Applicant  is  adaptable  and
flexible to various tasks and is always available. He has had no issues with Applicant as
far as an employee or handling critical information. He is very good at his job and has had
access to controlled protected information without incident. He is aware Applicant is under
treatment. He believes Applicant would act responsibly in handling classified information.
(Tr. 124-132)
Mr. L has had a security clearance for 40 years. He works with Applicant and has
daily interaction. He believes that most engineers have a certain personality type and that
some  of  their  social  skills  are  impacted  by  their  analytical  and  technical  skills.  He  has
reviewed the SOR and has not seen any conduct by Applicant that would cause him to
be concerned about protecting classified information. (Tr. 133-138)
Mr. T testified  on  Applicant’s behalf. He  is responsible for DOD contracts for his
company.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  1986.  He  has  frequent  contact  with
Applicant  and  described  him  as  a  great  employee.  He  assesses  him  as  extremely
intelligent, bright, diligent and a positive impact on their program. Applicant has been open
and honest with him about his past suicide attempts and managing his current condition.
He is receptive to being mentored by Mr. T both professionally and socially. Mr. T has no
concerns  about  Applicant’s  ability  to  responsibly  handle  classified  information.  He
described Applicant as a rule follower. (Tr. 139-144)
Mr. A testified on Applicant’s behalf. He has held a security clearance since 2006.
He and Applicant previously worked together, do not anymore, but remain friends. He is
aware of the government’s security concerns. He described Applicant as brilliant. He said
Applicant  self-reported  that  he  was  receiving  mental  health  treatment.  He  stated  that
Applicant has a solid group of friends who he can talk to and if he has any concerns, they
will help him address them. (Tr. 145-151)
Applicant provided performance evaluations from 2020 and 2021 reflecting marks
of  outstanding  and  exceeds  expectations.  He  graduated  cum  laude  with  an  honors
diploma  from  college  in  2019.  He  also  provided  certificates  of  achievement  for  his
expertise in math and science and in an internship program. In 2016, he was awarded his
Eagle Scout badge. He also provided certificates of merit for different achievements and
awards. (AE A-O)

"Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b.  He  denied  the  SOR
allegations  in ¶¶ 1.c, 2.a and 2.b.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into the findings of
fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old. He married in 2015 for the fourth time. He has one adult
child from his first marriage and two minor children from  his third marriage. He shares
parental custody with his ex-wife. He has been employed by a federal contractor since
April 2020. (Transcript (Tr.) 14-19, 60-62)
In  February  1995,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while  ability
impaired  with  a  blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  over  .05%  but  less  than  .08%  and
driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was found guilty of DUI. Applicant testified
that he was with friends watching a football game over three to four hours and consumed
some alcohol. He then drove and another car lost control and collided with Applicant head
on.  He  admitted  to  the  police  that  he  had  consumed  alcohol  and  a  breathalyzer  was
administered, which recorded his BAC. The actual BAC is unknown, but it was less than
.08%. Applicant has not had any other alcohol-related incidents. (Tr. 20-21)
Applicant saw his same family doctor from 2010 to 2020 until he moved to a new
state. In approximately 2014, Applicant began experiencing anxiety. He was in a stressful
job that required him to dismiss other employees. He said it was not the job he had agreed
to when he was hired. The stress of the job was affecting his health. He was treated by
his family doctor and diagnosed with general anxiety. He was prescribed medication in
2014, which helped relieve his symptoms. When the stressors diminished, he felt better.
Although he saw his family doctor on a regular basis, his appointments were not always
related to stress, but were also for other medical reasons. Applicant credibly testified that
he was not treated for anxiety from 2014 to 2019 as is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, but rather
acute situations periodically created stress and anxiety which were then treated. These
were not chronic conditions but more related to situational factors. When the stressors
decreased, his anxiety diminished. (Tr. 31-33)
In  May  2017,  Applicant  recognized  he  was  consuming  too  much  alcohol  and
voluntarily sought treatment. He attributed his consumption to a period when he and his
ex-wife were dealing with custody of their children. He shared custody of his children with
his ex-wife and had the children every other week. For a period, his older child lived with
him. His ex-wife’s husband was transferred to a new location and visitation became more
difficult for him. Applicant was close to his children and missed them. He credibly testified
that the family court ruled that both parents were fit to have legal custody of the children.
However,  due  to  his  ex-wife’s  geographical  move,  he  asked  his  children  where  they
wanted to live, and they chose to stay with their mother. Applicant continues to visit them
regularly, and they have a good relationship. (Tr. 22-25, 38; GE 4, 5)
Applicant voluntarily admitted himself into a five-day detoxification program in May
2017.  He  was  diagnosed  with  Alcohol  Dependence.  He  testified  that  he  started
consuming alcohol and he gradually increased the amount he was consuming up to a full
bottle of alcohol a day before he sought treatment. He admitted he was a heavy drinker
for about a year before admitting himself to the detoxification program. He testified that
he was physically dependent on alcohol when he entered the program.  He said that at
the recommendation of the treatment center, he participated in outpatient treatment for
six  months  until  the  program  was  completed.  He  participated  in  Alcoholic  Anonymous
(AA) as part of the after-care program. He went to two to three meetings a week at the
time. He has not participated in AA since then. He said it was not the right program for
him. He stated that as the physical dependence decreased, his depression improved, and
alcohol was no longer an issue. (Tr. 25-26, 38-44, 54-55; GE 4, 5)
Applicant testified that he abstained from alcohol consumption for about six months
after the detoxification program. He then occasionally had a drink if he was on vacation
or having a special dinner, but he was not consuming it daily. He no longer craved it. He
established a moderate drinking pattern. (Tr. 26)
Applicant was on medical leave from his job for anxiety prior to May 2016.When
his medical leave was terminated, he was unemployed until May 2017. He said he did not
drink  while  he  was  working.  He  was  terminated  from  his  job  because  he  was  taking
medical leave related to anxiety and the stressors associated with the expectations of the
job, which he could not perform. He admitted that when he was denied further medical
leave, it likely had an impact on his drinking. (Tr. 44-45)
In 2019, Applicant requested medical leave from his employer related to the stress
and anxiety  that he  was  experiencing due to  custody issues with his children.  He was
also moving to a new state for a position that was a significant distance from where his
children were living. He attempted to work remotely to be closer to his children, but his
request was denied. Applicant testified that in the past he has used alcohol to manage
depression,  anxiety,  stress,  and  physical  pain.  He  has  learned  from  his past  mistakes
when he tried to resolve his problems by himself. He now knows when he needs to reach
out for help. He recognizes the triggers that impact his decisions and he attended therapy
during his child custody case. He is presently not participating in treatment. (Tr. 30-31,
56-57)
In late 2021, Applicant was experiencing a serious physical medical condition and
he was using alcohol to relieve the pain for about two to three months in the evenings to
help him sleep. He admitted he was self-medicating. He said his doctor was aware that
he  was  consuming  alcohol.  His  doctor  did  not  believe  he  was  becoming  physically
dependent on alcohol but concurred the amount of alcohol he was consuming at the time
was excessive. (Tr. 47-50, 62-65; GE 3)
In  December  2021,  Applicant  had  surgery  for  his  medical  condition.  He  did  not
consume  alcohol  for  four  months  after  the  surgery.  Upon  a  follow-up  medical
appointment, he was told by his doctor that he could consume alcohol periodically, but
not on a regular basis because it would have a negative effect on his medical condition.
He  subsequently  consumed  alcohol  while  on  vacation.  He  testified  that  he  had  also
consumed one drink on a few other occasions, and it was a low alcohol-content beer. He
later  had  additional  medical  tests,  and  the  doctor  told  him  that  given  his  autoimmune
disorder, it would be better for his health to completely abstain from alcohol consumption.
Subsequently,  he  has  not  had  alcohol  since  May  2022.  His  wife  no  longer  consumes
alcohol. They do not have alcohol in the house. (Tr. 27-31, 50-52, 58-60; GE 3)
Applicant testified that he has found outlets to help him reduce stress. He now lives
in an area that is not as demanding. He and his wife have found a core group of friends
that are a support group, which he previously did not have. They are  also an important
social circle for him and his wife. He can talk to intimately to this group, which helps him
from internalizing issues. He has taken up woodworking and other hobbies which provide
significant help in reducing his stress. (Tr. 68-70)
Applicant testified that he does not believe he is an alcoholic, but admits he abused
alcohol in the past, and his excessive use was triggered by stressful events in his life, for
which he sought help. (Tr. 38-39)
In November 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist, Dr. B. She
indicated that based on her interview, available medical records, a security investigation
file, and psychological screening that Applicant met the criteria for alcohol use disorder,
mild; major depressive disorder; panic disorder; anxiety; and narcissistic personality. The
latter she noted likely contributed to work-related difficulties. She noted he had a history
of severe alcohol use disorder, continued to consume alcohol, and he was not currently
participating  in  treatment.  She  noted  that  Applicant’s  statements  suggested  he  was
unwilling  to  acknowledge  the  psychological  components  of  his  use  disorder,  despite
statements that it was a “coping mechanism.” She opined that Applicant was unlikely to
be able to safeguard sensitive information and his judgment was poor. She opined that
Applicant appeared deceptive and dishonest and his prognosis was poor. (GE 2)
Applicant credibly testified  that  Dr. B.’s medical evaluation  consisted  of a  60-to-90-
minute  ZOOM  conference  call  during  which  the  video  connection  was disrupted, jumpy
and  choppy,  and  would  break  up  several times.  The  audio  on  the  ZOOM  call  did  not work,
so  Dr. B  had  Applicant call  her on  the  telephone. Dr. B  made  no  mention  of the  intermittent
difficulties  with   the   video   or  audio   connection   during   the   evaluation   and   its  potential
negative impact on her personal observations  of Applicant.  (Tr. 34-35, 70-71)  Of interest
was Dr. B’s comment:
He was observed to take long pauses and reduce eye contact once he was
repeatedly asked to respond to the question at hand. He also chuckled at
nearly  all  questions  presented,  despite  the  fact  that  the  questions  were
direct  and  non-humorous.  His  presentation  was  consistent  with  that  of
patients  attempting  to  present  as  self-assured,  though  actually  quite
insecure and manipulative to those around him. (GE 2)
Applicant testified that due to the connectivity difficulty with the ZOOM evaluation
and being generally nervous about having a psychological evaluation that he likely was
not his normal self. (Tr. 35-37)
Dr. B had Applicant take the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). She stated
the following:
Validity scales indicated  that [Applicant]  was consistent and  honest  in his
response  style.  This indicated  that the  consequent profile is a   reasonable
depiction   of  the   applicant’s  self-appraisal.  There  were   no   indications  of
psychological impairment on  the  PAI clinical profile. His responses indicate
that  [Applicant’s] interests/motivation  for treatment is  comparable  to  that  of
adults who  are  not being  seen  in a  therapeutic setting.  Moreover, his level
of  treatment  motivation   is  somewhat  lower  than   is  typical  of  individuals
being  seen  in  treatment settings.  His responses suggest  that he  is satisfied
with himself as he is, that he is not experiencing marked distress, and that,
as a result, he sees little need  for changes in  his behavior.
Based on his responses, his interpersonal style seems best characterized
as  self-assured,  confident,  and  dominant.  Although  not  unfriendly,  he  is
likely  to  be  described  by  others  as  ambitious  and  having  a  “leader-like”
demeanor.  He  is  comfortable  in  social  settings,  but  is  not  likely  to  mix
indiscriminately, preferring to interact with others in situations over which he
can exercise some measure of control. (GE 2)
Dr.  B  noted  in  her  report  that  Applicant  was  not  able  to  obtain  custody  of  his
children. Her statement is inaccurate. Applicant has always had joint legal custody of his
children and continues to do so. He is involved in their lives and  participates with their
mother in decision-making for the children. (Tr. 35-36; GE 2).
Dr. B’s comments under her diagnostic impressions, note that Applicant met the
criteria for alcohol use disorder, mild, and commented “at the very least.” She noted that
it was based  on  Applicant’s self-assessment, but she found he lacked candor. He was
not  in  treatment  and  did  not  acknowledge  he  was  an  alcoholic.  She  believed  he  was
unwilling to acknowledge the components of his alcohol use disorder and his insight was
limited. She found he was “unlikely to be a reliable employee, as his work history shows.”
She determined his judgment was poor and he “appears deceptive and dishonest, putting
his trustworthiness in question” and his prognosis is “very poor.” (GE 2)
Applicant’s wife testified on his behalf. She has known Applicant since 2014. She
confirmed that Applicant does not have a current issue with alcohol. They have attempted
to reduce their stress and since moving to a new state they have been successful. She
confirmed  he  has  found  activities  to  help  him.  In  2017,  she  was  concerned  about  his
alcohol consumption, but was satisfied when he voluntarily went through detoxification.
She recognized that he had issues with anxiety, depression, and alcohol in the past, but
stated that he has addressed them. She has read the psychological report by Dr. B and
emphatically  disagrees  with  her  assessment,  especially  the  narcissism  diagnosis.  She
said the Applicant goes out of his way to be nice and puts her before himself. He strives
to do the right thing. They have a happy home and take care of each other. She and her
husband no longer consume alcohol and there is none in their home. (Tr. 74-85)
Applicant’s father testified. He acknowledged that Applicant addressed his issues
with  alcohol,  and  it  has  not  been  a  problem  in  the  past  couple  of  years.  He  believes
Applicant’s mental health  is good. He was aware  that Applicant went through a difficult
time when he was dealing with custody issues. (Tr. 87-90)
A  friend  of Applicant’s  testified  on  his behalf. They worked together at one time
and are good friends. He is aware that Applicant is applying for a security clearance. He
has no concerns about granting him access. (Tr. 91-95)
",True
"Applicant is 52 years old. She married in 1996 and separated in 2009. She has not
divorced. She and her husband have an adult child. She earned a bachelor’s degree in
1995  and  technical  certifications  in  2001  and  2014.  She  is  a  first-time  applicant  for  a
security clearance. Since March 2021, Applicant has been employed as an information
technology analyst by a major U.S Government contractor. She seeks national security
eligibility in connection with her employment. (Tr. at 11-19; GE 1 at 7, 13-15, 24, 26-31,
46-47; AE B; AE E; AE F; AE J.)
Paragraph 1 - Guideline I, Psychological Conditions
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security
clearance  because  she  has  a  psychological  condition  that  raises  security  concerns.
Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant has experienced multiple hospitalizations for
psychiatric issues and has been diagnosed with a number of mental health conditions.
The SOR allegations and the relevant record evidence are as follows:
1.a. Hospitalization for psychiatric issues. The SOR alleged that between 1997
and  2015,  Applicant  has  been  hospitalized  several  times  due  to  her  mental  health
condition.  In  her  Answer,  she  admitted  the  allegation  and  explained  that  she  sought
treatment  for  trauma  during  her  childhood  consisting  of  physical  and  emotional  abuse
from her father. She also experienced additional stressors due to her failed marriage and
raising a child with Asperger’s Syndrome. (Answer at 1-2.)
Applicant testified that she experienced more than five voluntary and  involuntary
hospitalizations  due  to  her mental health  condition  in  the  past.  Her  last  hospitalization
was in March 2016. The hospitalization started out voluntary but ended up as a 72-hour
involuntary hold  due  to  Applicant  expressing  suicidal thoughts.  She  explained  that her
mental health problems were due to her physical and emotional abuse from her father
from age 4 to 14. She developed a fear that her decisions would result in  punishment.
Her last contact with her father was seven years  ago, when she was 45. She believes
that her mental-health condition has greatly improved since she cut ties witih her father
and became her own person. (Tr. at 17-27, 39-40.)
1.b. 2015 diagnosis of several mental health conditions. The SOR alleged that
Applicant  was  diagnosed  in  2015  with  Major  Depressive  Disorder,  recurrent,  severe
without psychosis; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); Personal History of Attention
Deficit Disorder and Hyperactivity Disorder; and Dependent Personality Disorder. In the
Answer,  she  admitted  the  allegation  but  questioned  whether  she  had  ever  been
diagnosed with Dependent Personality Disorder. She testified that she first learned about
these diagnoses by reading the Government’s evidence. She explained that psychiatrists
do  not  like  to  share  their  technical  diagnosis  with  her  as  the  patient,  they  just  provide
general  terms  about  her  condition.  She  is  currently  taking  four  medications  and  her
primary care physician manages her  prescriptions. She has been taking this particular
combination of medications since 2015 or 2016, and she believes they are very effective
in managing her health. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 29-30, 47.)
1.c  Treatment  at  medical  center  from  2014  to  2020.  The  SOR  alleged  that
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  Insomnia,  Depressive  Disorder,  Anxiety  State,  Attention
Deficit  Disorder  and  Hyper-Activity  Disorder,  and  History  of  Borderline  Personality
Disorder. In the Answer, Applicant admitted that her primary care physician works at the
medical  center  and  provides  refills  of  the  prescriptions  she  has  been  given  by  a
psychiatrist  at  the  center.  She  explained  further  that  she  has  not  sought  psychiatric
treatment or psychological counseling  since  2015  due  to  her psychiatrist’s opinion  that
she has managed her mental health well since 2015 by complying with her medication
treatment. She takes her medications “like clockwork.” She does not currently receive any
counseling, but she would not hesitate to seek counseling if she needed it. She has had
no  inpatient  or  outpatient  hospitalizations  since  March  2016.  Her  last  outpatient  “talk”
therapy was in 2016. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 30-34, 51.)
1.d Opinion of a DoD-selected psychologist. On January 26, 2022, Applicant
submitted  to  a  mental-health  evaluation  by  a  psychologist  working  for  DoD  (DoD
Psychologist). In her evaluation of Applicant, the DoD Psychologist diagnosed her with
Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, in full remission; other specific trauma and
stressor related disorder; and History of Attention Deficit Disorder, combined type. The
psychologist concluded that despite Applicant’s current status of being in remission, her
diagnosis  creates  a  risk  of  impaired  judgment  and  reliability.  She  also  concluded  that
Applicant’s risk of “any future mental health problems is elevated due to these diagnoses
and current presentation.” (GE 2 at 9, 11.)
In   the   Answer,  Applicant  admitted   this  allegation   in  part  but  disagreed   with   the
psychologist’s conclusion.   Applicant’s  primary  care  physician   for   the   past  ten   years
provided a  different opinion in a letter, dated July 8, 2022. She wrote:
[Applicant’s] mental  health  history was tumultuous  for  many  years  with  the
last  bout of psychiatric treatment being  in 2013. She  relates much  of  these
difficulties to  an  abusive relationship with  her father and  to  a  lesser extent,
stressors of a failed marriage and raising a child with Asperger’s.
*
*
*
In  2015,  she  cut  ties  with  her  abusive  father.  Since  then,  she  has  done
exceptionally well to the point that I have managed her medications since
2015  and  she  no  longer  needs  to  see  a  psychiatrist.  She  has  been
completely  stable  with  no  exacerbations.  She  is  medically  compliant  and
comes  in  regularly  for  her  prescriptions.  [Applicant]  has  excelled  in  her
employment with more responsibilities and promotions. Additionally, she is
a single mother and has raised a son, [name deleted], who is now 19.
*
*
*
I  have  no  reservations  in  recommending  her  for  reconsideration  of  her
security clearance.
(AE A.) Applicant has also had a recent mental-health evaluation by a psychologist, who
is a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Medical Services Corps and holds a Top
Secret clearance (Evaluator). The Evaluator had reviewed the DoD Psychologist’s Report
when he interviewed Applicant. (Tr. at 38-43, 62.)
The Evaluator wrote in his report, dated February 22, 2023:
[Applicant]   appears  to   have   [made]  significant  efforts  in  remediating   her
psychological issues such  as distancing  herself from  her parents,  applying
herself in her career, maintaining  lawful behaviors, and  staying  compliant
with   her  treatment  recommendations   and   medication   regimen.   These
behaviors  and   interventions  have   resulted   in  a   remission   of  many  of  her
previously identified  issues that appear to  have  been  sustained  over several
years. The  diagnoses  below attempt to  capture the  Subject’s current level
of   functioning   as   well  as  acknowledging   her   history  as  it   pertains  to   this
evaluation.
The Evaluator provided the following diagnosis:
DIAGNOSIS:
ADHD, combined type (F90.2)
Persistent depressive disorder, with anxious distress, in full remission (F34.1)
Posttraumatic stress, resolved (F43.10)
Opioid use disorder, moderate, in full remission (F11.20)
Anxiolytic use disorder, severe, in full remission (F13.20)
In his conclusion, he wrote:
The  chaotic  presentation  that  occurred  between  the  years  of  1997  and  2016
would  certainly  have   resulted   in  an   adverse  outcome,  had   she   been
evaluated   then.  However,  since   that  time,  it  appears  that  she   has   made
significant   improvements  across   all   major  areas   of  her  life;  personal,
professional,  and   relational.  As  a   result   of  these   actions,  and   her
compliance  with  medical treatment,  she  appears to  have  mitigated  the  worst
of her symptoms which  would have  prevented  a  favorable recommendation.
There   does   not   appear  to   be   any   current  evidence   of   disqualifying
symptoms   or   behaviors   and   she   has   exhibited  stability   over  the
course   of   at  least  6   years.   She   has  maintained   compliance   with   her
medical  treatment  team   and   does  not  appear  to   have   any  reservations
about utilizing  them  when  complications arise.  Lastly, there does not appear
to   be   any  concerns  from   her  professional  references  about   her  ability  to
perform  in her required  duties. As such, this Evaluator believes  that the
Subject’s   judgement,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness   are   currently
intact.
(AE O at 8 (emphasis added.))
Mitigation
Applicant  has  received  multiple recognitions and  new positions since  starting  to
work for her current employer in 2021. She enjoys a good reputation and has earned a
lot  of  credibility  with  her  superiors  and  co-workers.  She  has  never  experienced  any
discipline  or  received  any  negative  comments  or  concerns  from  her  employer.  Her
performance reviews are highly favorable. (Tr. at 40-42; AE C.)
Applicant works remotely from her home. She manages her stress by exercise and
walking her dog. She likes to ride horses and has earned a black belt in martial arts. (Tr.at

"Applicant is 41 years old, divorced, and has one minor child. He graduated from
high school and attended some college classes. Since September 2019 he has worked
for a DoD contractor performing inventory duties. He is a first-time applicant for national
security  eligibility.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment. (Tr. at 7, 20-24.)
Paragraph 1 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations
is
financially  overextended  and
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
lists one medical debt and two tax debts, both for tax year (TY) 2017 (Federal and state).
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) and denied the two tax
debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c). (Answer at 1-2.)
Applicant  testified   about  his  income   and   expenses.  He  is  able   to   pay  all   of  his
monthly  expenses   and   child   support.  He   tries  to   save   about   $800   per  month.   He   has
about $3,000  in savings and  about $14,000  in his employer’s 401K  account.  (Tr. at 24-
28.)
The current status of the debts alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR is as follows:
1.a.   Medical   debt   in   collection   in   the   approximate   amount   of   $31,688.  This
debt arose  after Applicant was in  a  car accident in 2016. He was taken  by helicopter from
the   accident   scene   to   a   large   city  hospital  for   emergency  care.  The   cost  of  the
transportation  expense  was not covered  by his insurance. In  2020  Applicant  settled  the
debt for $6,000 and paid it with monthly payments.  In November 2020 he  made an initial
payment  of  $265.  Thereafter, he  made  weekly payments  of  $65. He  provided  a  record
from   the   creditor  evidencing   each   payment,   along   with   a   final  payment  of  $2,953   on
November 5,  2021.  He   made   the   final payment  with   funds   from   a  tax  refund.  His  total
payments  were  $6,338. He also  provided  a  letter from  the  creditor stating  that this debt
had  been  paid  in full  and  the  account was closed. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 29-34;  GE
3 at 4; GE 4 at 2; AE B; AE C.)
1.b.  Federal  tax  debt  for  TY  2017  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $4,961.
Applicant acknowledged that he owed the IRS additional taxes for TY 2017. He testified
that this debt was paid through his tax refunds in subsequent years. He provided letters
from his tax preparer bearing the date  of December 29, 2022, which was the date the
letters were reprinted for purposes of submission in this security clearance proceeding.
The annual letters summarize Applicant’s tax status and cover TYs 2014 through 2021.
The letters state that Applicant was due refunds from the IRS for every year except TY
2017,  when  he  owed  an  additional  tax  of  $4,637.  Applicant  volunteered  in  his  initial
security interview on March 21, 2019, that he owed the IRS about $4,000 for TY 2017.
Additional taxes were owed that year because he withdrew funds from his 401K due to
losing his job in 2017 and he was unemployed for a period. Applicant relied upon his 401k
trustee to withhold sufficient taxes at the time of the withdrawal and the  funds withheld
and paid to the IRS and the state proved to be insufficient. As of the date of his security
interview, Applicant had not paid the tax, but he subsequently learned that his tax refunds
for TYs 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, which totaled about $6,300, were applied to his TY
2017 tax debt rather than paid to him as refunds. Applicant believes that this tax debt has
been  fully  satisfied.  He  was  unable  to  provide  an  account  transcript  from  the  IRS  to
confirm  the  payment  of  this  tax  debt  because  he  does  not  possess  the  necessary
identifying information, such as a credit card or any other required document, to open an
online account with the IRS. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 34-42; GE 2 at 6; AE A at 2-6.)
1.c.   State  tax   debt   for  TY   2017   in  the   approximate  amount   of   $1,944.
Applicant’s  state  issued  a  garnishment  of  his  wages  in  August  2019  to  pay  this  debt.
Applicant decided  to  pay the  debt through  deductions from  his paycheck. The  debt was
initially  paid by wage  garnishments. At some  point, Applicant entered  into  a  payment plan
with  the  state  to  pay the  balance  of his tax debt.  He  paid  it off  before  2022. He  presented
a  copy of a  state  tax refund  check, dated  October 25, 2022, he  received  for TY 2021,
which  evidences that he  owed  no  additional taxes to  the  state  at that point. This debt is
resolved.  (Tr. at 41-43; GE 7; AE A at 1.)
Paragraph 2 - Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant has a history of excessive
alcohol consumption, which raises security concerns because his drinking can lead to the
exercise  of  questionable  judgment  or  the  failure  to  control  impulses.  The  Government
also alleged that Applicant’s alcohol consumption can raise questions about his reliability
and  trustworthiness.  Specifically,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  consumed
alcohol during a period he was also taking Hydrocodone, a pain killer, which was against
medical advice; that he was treated at a medical facility after a possible suicide attempt
that  involved  alcohol;  that  he  was  charged  with  Driving  Under  the  Influence  (DUI)  of
alcohol; and that he continued to drink alcohol to intoxication. In the Answer, Applicant
admitted the four allegations (SOR ¶¶ 2.a- 2.d) with two explanations.
Applicant  testified   that  he   stopped   drinking   alcohol  on   January  30,   2022,  He
stopped drinking “cold turkey” because  he felt that alcohol was toxic and  he did not want
to  consume  it any more. He also stopped  dating  a  woman  who  wanted  to  go  out  to  bars
and  drink alcohol. He is happier and  his child  is happier that  he  has stopped  drinking. He
has no intention of ever drinking  alcohol again. (Tr. at 43-44.)
2.a. Alcohol consumption with Hydrocodone. Applicant admitted in the Answer
that during the period from August 2012 to June 2015, he drank alcohol while taking the
prescription medication Hydrocodone even though that was against his doctor’s advice.
He explained that during that time period, he had two back surgeries and was suffering
from a lot of pain. He found that combining alcohol with this painkiller medication helped
reduce  his  pain  and  made  him  more  mobile.  In  or  about  late  2015  or  2016,  Applicant
stopped taking Hydrocodone. As discussed below, he was in a bad car accident in 2016
and he refused to take any pain killers. He testified that he presently only takes two Advil
capsules for pain. (Tr. at 44-45, 50.)
2.b.  Suicide   attempt  while   intoxicated.   In   August  2016,  Applicant   had   a   bad
evening  at home  due  to  being  upset  about  his recent divorce and  being  unhappy with  his
relationship  with  a  woman  he  was  dating.  Applicant’s brother came  to  check  on  him  and
found him intoxicated  and with  a knife in his hand. He had self-inflicted cuts on  his arms.
His brother called  the  police, and  Applicant testified  that he  agreed  to  go  with  them  to  a
stabilization  facility for  a  brief hold  to  make  sure he  would not  commit  any serious self
harm.  Applicant  does  not  believe   than   any  prescription   pain  pills  were   involved   in  this
incident, just  alcohol. Applicant has  subsequently committed  himself to  eliminating  toxicity
in his life  and  the  people  around  him  who  cause  it. He has had  no  suicidal ideations since
that evening  and has not engaged in any  further self harm.  (Tr. at 45-47, 50-51.)
2.c.  DUI  arrest  and  charges.  In  October  2016,  Applicant  was  arrested  and
charged with DUI. His girlfriend at that time was driving, and she had a bad accident. Her
driver’s license had been suspended, and she had been drinking. She told the police that
Applicant was driving. He was intoxicated at the time and went along with the girlfriend’s
story. He was actually in the passenger seat at the time of the accident and hit his head
the front windshield so hard, he lost consciousness. He was taken by helicopter to a large
city hospital where he regained consciousness. He hired a lawyer and a collision expert.
The expert convinced the prosecutor that Applicant was in the passenger seat at the time
of the accident. The charges were dropped. (Tr. at 47-50.)
2.d. Continued  excessive  alcohol consumption. The  Government alleged  that
Applicant continued  to  drink excessively until at least December 2020. Applicant admitted
in  the   Answer that   he  did  continue  to  drink,  but only “a   couple   of   beers”   at  a   time.   He
denied  any  excessive drinking  in  recent  years, and,  as  noted,  he  stopped  drinking  entirely
in January 2022. (Tr.at 48-49.)
Paragraph 3 – Guideline I, Psychological Conditions
3.a. Alcohol consumption with Hydrocodone. The Government cross-alleged
its allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a in SOR ¶ 3.a under Guideline I. Department Counsel was at a
loss to explain the Government’s theory of this allegation and did not ask any questions
or make any argument based upon the alleged facts under this guideline. (Tr. at 55, 65,
71.)
Paragraph 4 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct
In paragraph 4 of the SOR, the Government alleged numerous acts of misconduct
by Applicant, including four falsification allegations. In his Answer, Applicant denied the
falsification allegations with one exception. The Government also cross-alleged his debts
set forth in paragraph 1 and the alcohol consumption allegations in paragraph 2. (Answer
at 3.)
The details regarding each of the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 4 are as
follows:
4.a.  Falsification  of  e-QIP  question  in  Section  26  regarding  unpaid  taxes.
Applicant testified that to his knowledge, he was paying his Federal and state taxes and
the appropriate answer was to write “No,” he did not fail to pay his taxes. He thought he
was answering the question truthfully. During his security interview about one month after
he  submitted the e-QIP,  Applicant  “volunteered” that he  had  a  federal tax  bill of about
$4,000 and that he had plans to pay the past-due taxes. In a follow-up interview, he stated
that he had not failed to pay his taxes, he merely “short paid,” i.e., under withheld the full
amount of the taxes due. (Tr. at 54, 58-59; GE 2 at 6, 9.)
4.b.  Falsification  of  e-QIP  Question  regarding  financial  delinquencies.
Applicant admitted this allegation. He testified that when he prepared the e-QIP he was
told by others to only provide what he had to. The co-workers who gave him that advice
were older employees who had worked at this company for a long time and had retired.
Applicant was told that he was just an entry-level laborer, and he did not need to worry
about the details like listing his debts. He admitted he did not take the process seriously.
He  has   since   received   a   promotion   and   has  a   better  understanding   of  the   security
clearance  process  and  the  importance  of total honesty in preparing  a  security clearance
application.  He  learned  from  the  security interview process  that  the  advice  he  was  given
was wrong   and  that “even  if  you   are  at the  bottom  of the   food   chain,  it’s very serious.”
With  his promotion  and  his work  in the  inventory field,  he  understands the  sensitivity of
the   information   with   which  he   works.  He  said,  “I  100%  get   it.”  If   he   was  filling   out   the
application  for a  security clearance  today,  he  would provide  even  more information  than
what was asked. (Tr.at 54-57.)
In  his  initial  security  interview  about  one  month  after  he  submitted  his  e-QIP,
Applicant “volunteered” that he had two tax debts and a debt in collection for helicopter
transportation services following a serious accident in 2016. (GE 2 at 6-7.)
4.c.  Falsification of  e-QIP  Section 24  question regarding alcohol treatment or
counseling. Applicant was advised  by older workers that he  should  not disclose  his  brief
stay at the  stabilization  facility  in response  to  the  questions in Section  24  about alcohol
treatment.   He   did   not   want   to   disclose   that   experience,   but   he   also   did   not   view   the
services he  received  there as counseling  or treatment.  He  thought he  was  there to  “just
sleep  it off.” When  he  woke  up  there, he  thought the  facility was just  a  “drunk tank”  to  hold
people while they sober up.  He was only there  overnight and  was released  in  the  morning.
The  reason  Applicant was being  held  at  the   stabilization  facility was to  determine  if he
potentially posed  a  threat  to  himself.  If  he  was not a  threat,  the  facility had  to  release  him,
which   is  what  happened   the   next  morning.  He  did  not  understand   that  this  was  a
counseling  or treatment facility.  He  thought  his answer was  truthful.  (Tr. at  58-59,  61-62.)
4.d.  Deliberate Omission during March 21, 2019  security  interview regarding
treatment at  the  stabilization facility. In  his Answer  Applicant denied  the  allegation  and
wrote  I  “did  not deliberately omit  [this information],  I  wasn’t  aware  that I  had  to  [disclose
it.].”  The   information   he   failed   to   disclose   was  the   self-inflicted   cuts  and   his   suicidal
ideation  that  evening. At his security interview, he  came  to  realize  that his experience  at
the  stabilization  facility could be  viewed  as  a  hospitalization  for a  mental health  condition,
and  he  volunteered  information  to  the  investigator about what happened  to  him  that night
at  his   home   and   at   the   stabilization   facility.  Department  Counsel  conceded   that
Applicant’s  disclosures  were  significant  and  that  any  facts not  discussed  did  not  rise  to
the  level of  a  security-significant  omission  of  material facts  (Answer at 3; Tr.  at  59-66;  GE
2 at 3-4.)
.
4.e.  Cross-allegation  of  the  financial considerations  allegations in paragraph
1. Department  Counsel  did  not pursue  this allegation  at  the  hearing.  The  allegation  has
no   merit.   The   issues  relating   to   Applicant’s  financial  consideration   are  fully  addressed
under  Guideline   F  and   do   not  raise   separate   issues  of   misconduct  cognizable  under
Guideline E.  (Tr. at 61-65.)
4.f. Cross-allegation of  the  alcohol  consumption allegations in  paragraph 2.
Department Counsel  did not pursue  this allegation  at the  hearing. The  allegation  has no
merit.  The  issues  relating  to  Applicant’s  past  alcohol  consumption  are  fully  addressed
under  Guideline  G  and  do  not  raise  separate  issues  of  misconduct  cognizable  under
Guideline E. (Tr. at 61-65.)
",True
"Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a. She admitted and denied different
aspects of SOR ¶ 1.b. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. She served in the military on active duty from 1989 to
1993  and  was  in  the  reserves  until  1996.  She  received  an  honorable  discharge.  She
earned a bachelor’s degree in 2001 and a master’s degree in 2008. She has been married
since 1995 and has an adult stepson. She worked for federal contractors since 2007 and
held a security clearance throughout her employment. She started working for her present
employer in January 2022. At the time of her hearing, Applicant was on medical leave
until February 5, 2023. (GE 1; Tr. 19-26, 68-71)
Applicant has had a myriad of medical issues. In June 2017, she was hospitalized
with  encephalitis-like  symptoms.  Her  symptoms  were  severe  headache,  nausea,  and
neck  pain.  She  was  provided  different  treatments  that  she  said  did  not  work  and  was
originally hospitalized for a week, released, and then hospitalized again.  She returned to
work in September 2017. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Flu-like symptoms
are possible  and  in more  severe cases people may experience  problems with  speech  and
hearing, hallucinations, personality  changes,  loss of  consciousness,  loss of  sensation  in
some  parts of the  body,  muscle weakness, partial paralysis in the  arms and  legs, impaired
judgment,  seizures,  and  memory loss.1  (Tr. Tr. 28-29; AE-AO,  AE-AP, AE-AQ,  AE-AR;
HE  VIII)
In April 2018, Applicant was hospitalized. Her medical records reflect that she had
a  long  history  of  encephalopathy  of  unknown  origin  and  was  diagnosed  with  acute
encephalopathy, pneumonia, and sepsis. Encephalopathy is a term for any disease of the
brain that alters brain function or structure. It may be caused by other medical issues. The
hallmark of it is an altered mental state. Common neurological symptoms are progressive
loss of memory and cognitive abilities, subtle personality changes, inability to concentrate,
lethargy,  and  progressive  loss  of  consciousness.2  At  the  time  of  her  admission  to  the
hospital her husband reported she had a cough, fever, and confusion and was not making
sense. She testified that at that time, the doctors did not know if the encephalopathy or
sepsis was the cause of her symptoms. She was discharged several days later, returned
to work for ten days, and then relapsed. She was taken to a university hospital and was
admitted  for  encephalopathy  and  psychosis.  She  was  an  inpatient  for  a  week  and
discharged. She tried to work the month of May but was having recurring headaches and
went to the community hospital two more times in May 2018. (Tr. 29-31; AE-AO, AE-AQ,
AE-AR, HE VIII)
In June 2018, Applicant voluntarily went to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
hospital and was admitted. She made comments of a suicide nature to one of the resident
physicians and the admission was converted to an involuntary admission. She explained
she became frustrated and should not have made the comments she did. She was tired
of  the  probing  and  said  she  was  sick of  being  questioned  and  said  if  the  window  was
open, she would jump out of it. They were on the second floor. She did not mean this as
a suicidal statement, but more one of frustration. She spent four days in the hospital. (Tr.
31-34; GE 5; AE-AR)
In June 2018, when  Applicant went to the VA hospital because she was having
chest pains, foggy vision and altered mental status. She said she lost voluntary control at
the time and felt like she was at the bottom of a pool and unable to respond to stimuli
around  her.  She  acknowledged  having  impaired  reality  testing  (such  as  auditory  and
visual  hallucinations  and  delusional  beliefs).  She  had  periods  of  severe  confusion,
cognitive problems or forgetfulness, distractibility, losing her train of thought, slow thinking
and word finding difficulties. She indicated that beginning in May 2018 she was perceiving
things that were not real. Applicant was on medical leave from her employment from June
2018 to June 2019. (Tr.94-95; GE 5 at 34-35, 93; AE-AR)

2 HE VIII; https://www.ninhs.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/encephalopathy
After  Applicant’s  discharge  from  the  VA  hospital,  she  began  seeing  Dr.  D,  a
psychiatrist with the VA. She has been Dr. D’s patient since June 2018. It is reported that
Applicant began having confusion, disorientation, inability to communicate and seizures
in  late  2018.  She  was  diagnosed  with  epilepsy  in  approximately  June  2019  and  takes
anti-seizure medication for the epilepsy. (Tr. 34-39, 45-46; AE U)
Dr.  D  provided  a  letter from  June  2019  stating  she  had  been  treating  Applicant
since  June  2018  for  depression  disorder  and  anxiety  disorder.  Applicant  had  been
compliant  with  treatment  and  recommendations  and  had  achieved  her  baseline.  She
stated that Applicant would benefit from returning to work part-time. In April 2021, Dr. D
provided  another  letter  to  provide  a  summary  of  Applicant’s  care.  She  indicated  that
Applicant  initially  had  an  altered  mental  status  secondary  to  an  infection  of  unknown
source and not from a primary psychiatric disorder. She noted that Applicant should not
have been  admitted involuntarily to  the  psychiatric  floor in  June 2018  but  should have
been  placed  on  the  medical  floor.  After  an  extensive  medical  work  up,  Applicant  was
diagnosed  with  epilepsy,  double  pneumonia,  sepsis,  and  encephalopathy.  These  all
affected her cognitive ability. She has been somewhat depressed due to her cognitive
decline, short term memory loss, seizures, and lifestyle modifications. Dr. D noted that
her  neurologist  helped control  her seizures. She  returned  to  work in  September 2019.
She was discharged from Dr. D’s care in approximately January 2020. Applicant reached
out to Dr. D again after receiving the SOR and throughout 2021 and in the beginning of
2022. (Tr. 46-48, 132-136; AE S, T)
In December 2020, Applicant participated in a mental health evaluation with Dr. B,
a psychologist approved by the government. Dr. B administered psychological tests to
there  was  no  significant
Applicant.  The  results  were  considered  normal  and
psychopathology. Applicant’s responses were below average for motivation for treatment.
Dr.  B  diagnosed  Applicant  with  unspecified  anxiety  disorder,  unspecified  depressive
disorder, and functional neurologic disorder (previously referred to as conversion disorder
in prior versions of the DSM). She noted that Applicant was compliant with medications
prescribed by her physicians  for anxiety and depression.  Dr. B  reported  that Applicant
had not continued treatment with a psychiatrist or therapist, which contradicts Applicant’s
testimony.  Dr.  B  had  concerns  that  Applicant  could  have  a  recurrence  of  conversion
symptoms  due  to  her  lack  of  ongoing  treatment  for  anxiety  and  depression.  She
recommended  Applicant  continue  her  psychiatric/psychological  treatment,  despite  her
psychological test results that indicated Applicant is not interested in doing so, and her
treatment  recommendations.
history
Consequently, Dr. B stated that her prognosis is guarded. Applicant’s history of psychotic
episodes leads Dr. B to be concerned about Applicant’s reliability, judgment, stability, and
trustworthiness.  Applicant  testified  that  her  meeting  with  Dr.  B  was  through  the  Zoom
platform and lasted one hour. (Tr. 43-44; GE 4)

Medical records show that in July 2021, Applicant met with Dr. T, a rheumatologist,
for follow-up treatment. Applicant reported to Dr. T that she continued to have memory
problems and impaired cognitive ability, such that she could not even play Bingo. She
had difficulty  with  recall and  word-finding.  She  realized she was  incorrectly  performing
some tasks, like putting cereal in the dog bowl. (Tr. 119-120, 130; AE-AR)
On  March  28,  2022,  Applicant  was  admitted  to  the  hospital.  She  had  been
experiencing neurological symptoms like Bell’s palsy and dizziness in early March. It was
determined to be a virus. At the end of March, Applicant experienced severe headaches
that worsened over several days and she exhibited confusion. Her husband took her to
the  hospital  where  she  was  involuntarily  admitted.  She  testified  she  was  involuntarily
admitted into the psychiatric ward due to suffering from encephalopathy. Her symptoms
included confusion, psychosis and  “she  was not making  sense.” Her treating  physician
Dr.  T  communicated  with  the  admitting  hospital,  and  she  was  started  on  high  dose  of
steroids.  She  was  discharged  and  remained  on  a  five-day  regiment  of  intravenous
steroids. (Tr. 50-53, 141-142; AE-AR) When asked if Dr. T had diagnosed her, Applicant’s
testimony was as follows:
[Dr.  T]  suspected   that   it  was  autoimmune   encephalopathy.  And   she   also
consulted   with   a   neurologist   in  the   community  because   I   had   responded
with  the  high  dose  of steroids, that’s always been  her diagnosis has been
autoimmune  encephalopathy, steroid  responsive.  (Tr. 53)
At the bottom of the July 2021 medical report, Dr. T wrote a note dated March 31, 2022,
which stated:
I have  sent  this note  for her MD to  review  as I have  been  informed  of  her
admission  for mental health  status changes.  Please  consider a  Neurology
eval[uation]  for  encephalopathy  of  all   etiologies.   Her  Sjogren’s  dx
predisposes her to  autoimmune CNS involvement. (AE V)
Applicant remained  in the  hospital from  March 28, 2022,  until the  third  week of April
2022. She  reached  out  again to  Dr. D, and  she  is now seeing  her every four to  six weeks.
Applicant  testified   that  Dr.  D  strongly   ruled   out  any   type   of  conversion/functional
neurological disorder as mentioned  by Dr.  B. Dr. D provided  letters from  August 2021  and
October  2021,  which   specifically  rule   out  a  conversion   disorder.  In   her  October  2021
letter,   Dr.  D noted   that  she   has   been   treating   Applicant  since   June   2018   and   she   has
followed  all  treatment recommendations. Based  on  her treatment of Applicant,  she  did
not have  concerns regarding  her reliability, judgment, stability, and  trustworthiness and
did not have  reservations recommending  her for a  security clearance. (Tr. 48-50, 136-
141; AE  W, AE X, AE-AQ, AE-AR)
Applicant testified that a neurologist was consulted during her March 2022 hospital
admission  about  her  diagnosis  of  autoimmune  encephalopathy  steroid-responsive.
Applicant was discharged from the hospital on April 19, 2022. Applicant was treated with
antipsychotics  and  Lorazepam.  She  testified  that  when  she  was  discharged  from  the
hospital, she was struggling with short-term memory loss, but was uncertain if it was due
to  the  drugs  she  was  prescribed,  including  the  antipsychotic  drug.  She  said  she  had
similar symptoms in June 2021 after she stopped taking the drugs. The antipsychotic drug
was discontinued in July 2022. (Tr. 54-58, 119-125; AE-AQ)
Applicant testified that Dr. D believed her episodes were due to medical and not
psychiatric  causes.  Applicant  testified  that  in  April  2022  she  was  diagnosed  with
autoimmune encephalopathy that is steroid responsive. Applicant stated that she had not
yet been diagnosed with autoimmune encephalopathy with steroid-responsive when she
met with Dr. B. (Tr. 38-44)
Dr. D provided another letter from May 2022. She  confirmed that Applicant  was
admitted to the VA hospital in March 2022 with altered mental status and was transferred
to  another  hospital.  She  was  treated  with  antipsychotics  and  Lorazepam  for  possible
catatonia.  She  was  diagnosed  with  encephalopathy  associated  with  autoimmune
thyroiditis that responded to steroids. Dr. D expected Applicant to make a full recovery in
the next 9 to 12 months. She noted that the last episode Applicant had was three years
ago and it lasted 14 months. She said Applicant would be monitored and her medications
adjusted accordingly. (AE Y)
Applicant  admitted  that  until  July  2022  she  was  taking  prescribed  antipsychotic
drugs that were prescribed to her, presumably during her last admission to the hospital.
She explained that when she was admitted to the hospital in March 2022, she exhibited
an altered mental status that presented as confusion, catatonic behavior, and emotionally
detached. She said neither Dr. T nor Dr. D had been consulted while she was admitted.
(Tr. 73, 77)
Applicant testified that the course of treatment for encephalopathy was determined
to  be  immunosuppressant  theory.  In  September  2022,  she  had  not  yet  begun
immunosuppressant therapy to know if it is an effective treatment for her condition. There
are  four  drugs  potentially  to  treat  her  condition,  and  she  began  taking  one  in  October
2022. She continues to be on it and will need it or a similar drug for the rest of her life to
control her condition. (Tr. 143-146)
Dr. D provided an updated letter on January 11, 2023. She stated that Applicant
was  successfully  tapered  off  her  antipsychotics  and  mood  stabilizers.  Her  Lorazepam
daily dose has been decreased. She has followed up with her doctor for encephalopathy
associated with autoimmune thyroiditis that has successfully responded to steroids. She
noted Applicant’s mental status examination is intact as well as her character, judgment,
reliability, and integrity. The recommended treatment plan is for her to continue to take
immunosuppressive  medication,  which  will  help  prevent
the
encephalopathy. She should have a good prognosis if she continues to follow up as she
has  done  in  the  past.  Dr.  D  had  no  reservations  about  recommending  Applicant  for  a
security clearance. (Tr. 144; AE Z)
recurrence  of
Dr. T provided a letter from January 2023. She said she has been taking care of
Applicant  since  November  2018.  She  stated  that  Applicant  suffers  from  recurrent
encephalopathy,  which  is  presumed  to  be  autoimmune  secondary  to  Sjogren’s
syndrome.3  She   noted   that  her  condition   is  steroid   responsive.   She   is  on   a   daily
preventive  treatment  with  immunosuppressants  that  “should  limit  or  fully  prevent  any
recurrence of her encephalopathic manifestations.” Her condition  in  Dr. T’s  opinion  does
not affect her  character, integrity,  or judgment “when  it is under control, as it  currently is
and should not prevent her from continuing with her job.” (Tr. 53-54,  146; AE-AA)
Applicant  testified  that  her  recovery  is  going  well.  Dr.  T  has  eliminated  some
medications and is prescribing other medications for long-term care to prevent recurrence
of the issues related to autoimmune encephalopathy. Dr. T and Applicant are working out
a strategy for a long-term treatment plan. She and her husband are aware of what to look
out for if she begins experiencing symptoms that raise concerns that the encephalopathy
is  recurring.  She  noted  that  stress  is  a  factor  that  triggers  her  symptoms  and  the
autoimmune disorders. She acknowledges that she experienced anxiety and depressive
disorders in the past. She disagreed with Dr. B’s diagnosis of conversion  disorder. She
understands  that  Dr.  T  is  attempting  to  find  the  right  dosage  of  medication  for  her
continued treatment. She understands that this is an ongoing process. She explained that
her symptoms are documented in her medical records, but there is no way she can say
definitively that future problems will not recur. She does not think they will and trusts that
they  will  not,  but  she  cannot  say  with  certainty;  however,  she  knows  what  to  do  if
symptoms recur. (Tr. 57-67; 147-151)
At the time of her hearing, Applicant  had not yet been cleared to return to work  by
Dr. D. Applicant testified  that she  did not have  current  symptoms of short-term  memory
loss or altered  mental  state.  She  anticipated  seeing  Dr. T or another specialist for the  rest
of her life. She  also  said she  will  continue  to  see  Dr.  D until she  discharges  her and  will
follow  her  recommended   treatment   plan.   Applicant  is   not  on   antipsychotic  drugs   at
present.  She   further  testified   that  she   has  a   medical  diagnosis  that  has  psychiatric
symptoms   that   she   is being   treated   for.  Although   she   was  diagnosed   with   anxiety   and
depression, she  does not believe  it affects  her ability to  perform  her  job. Since  the  doctors
have  determined  the  underlying  cause  of  her symptoms,  she  has  noticed  an  improvement
in her condition  because  she  has  a  better  understanding  of her issues.  (Tr. 57-67,  147-
153)
Applicant provided numerous character letters. Many of them were written before
her most recent hospitalization in March 2022. She testified that she reached out to those
providing letters to make them aware of her hospitalization and inquired if any of them
wanted  to  revoke  their  letters.  None  of  them  wanted  to  revoke  their  letters.  She  is
described  as  dynamic,  confident,  generous,  thoughtful,  composed,  professional,  fair,
strong,  steady,  resilient,  determined,  honorably,  disciplined,  honest,  loyal,  smart,
talented,  positive,  compassionate,  patriotic,  reliable,  respected,  trustworthy,  and
responsible. She possesses technical, leadership and business-related skills. Her past
work performance is described as exceptional. She possesses a high level of trust and
integrity and a strong work ethic. (AE A through AE R, AE-AB)

produce tears and saliva. https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1025/sjogren-syndrome
Medical Record Review
A  review of Applicant’s medical records from  2018  through  2022  reflect that  in April
2018  it was noted  that  she  had  a  long  history of encephalopathy with  unclear origin  and
a   diagnosis  of  acute   encephalopathy  secondary  to   sepsis.  She   was  experiencing
confusion at the time.
On  March  30,  2022,  Applicant  was  involuntarily  hospitalized  at  the  VA  hospital.
Her medical records noted that she had a history of present illness for depression, anxiety,
Sjogren’s  disorder,  seizure  disorder,  hypothyroidism,  PCOS  (polycystic  ovarian
syndrome) and neurogenic bladder. She was admitted to inpatient psychiatry for acute
psychosis. She was placed in restraints due to disruptive behavior that posed a risk of
injury to herself and others. She was climbing on the windowsill, removing her hospital
scrubs,  pacing,  banging  on  a  chair  and  bedside  table  and  unable  to  follow  simple
directions. Later, she admitted to the medical staff that she had been bad, and she was
responsible for the use of restraints but was unable to give a coherent answer as to what
she meant but acknowledged there was a safety issue. She reported seeing things that
were not present in reality. The medical records reflect that there was concern from Dr. T
that  her  symptoms  were  the  result  of  medical  problems,  and  she  was  transferred  to  a
medical
floor.  Multiple  doctors  considered  Dr.  T’s  diagnosis  of  autoimmune
encephalopathy and recommended further medical testing. A VA psychiatrist noted that
Applicant  was  transferred  to  the  medical  floor  for  a  workup  for  the  medical  etiology  of
symptoms which was unrevealing. Other neurologists discussed the use of steroids on
patients suspected of having immune mediated encephalopathy. Worsening psychosis
was  discussed with  the  neurology  team, and  it  was  felt that a  lumbar puncture  should
precede a steroid trial. This procedure was declined by Applicant’s family. The VA doctors
considered Dr. T’s diagnosis of autoimmune encephalopathy but none of the diagnostic
tests confirmed abnormalities. She was treated with high dose steroids but the precise
cause for her medical problems are unclear. (AE-AR)
According   to   the   medical  records  when   Applicant  was  discharged   from   the   VA
hospital on  April 9,  2022.  Dr. P’s diagnosis on  discharge  was  acute  psychosis. Tests had
been  performed  with  no  acute  findings. Dr. P  noted  that  if there was  a  plausible  diagnosis
for  metabolic/autoimmune/Hashimoto’s   encephalopathy  then   he   supported   treatment
with  high  dose  steroids, but he  did not find  either clinically or biochemically that Applicant
had   encephalopathy.   He  recommended   ancillary  testing   to   formally  diagnose   Anti-N-
methyl D-aspartate  (NMDC) encephalitis or to  rule  out an  infectious source.  He noted  the
family refused  the  procedure of lumbar puncture to  make  this determination,  so  neurology
empirically  treated   her  with   high   dose   steroids  for a   working   diagnosis  of  autoimmune
encephalitis. (AE- AO,  AE-AR)
On April 12, 2022, Applicant was again hospitalized. Her prior history noted that
she had seizure disorder, anxiety, depression, and prior reported encephalitis and recent
multiple hospitalizations for decline in cognitive status and altered mental status. At the
time  of admission,  she  was  having  ongoing altered  mental status  issues.  The  medical
record again noted that there was suspicion of possible Hashimoto’s encephalopathy and
neurology had recommended she be placed on high dose steroids. It was also noted that
acute  encephalopathy  had  an  unclear  etiology.  She  was  subsequently  discharged  on
April 19, 2022. (AE-AQ)

degree.  She  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  2017  as  a  software
engineer and is attempting to retain a security clearance in relation to her employment.
She has worked in the defense industry since approximately 1987 and has held a security
clearance since approximately 1999. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and
25; Applicant Exhibits E and I.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions)
The DoD CAF alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is not eligible
for access because she has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair
her judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. Applicant admitted both subparagraphs with
explanations.
As a preliminary matter, Applicant admits being under mental health treatment for
about 30  to 40 years, beginning when she was in college. This treatment consisted  of
both medication treatment and mental-health therapy. However, the record is sparse as
to the extent of any treatment before 2020. Applicant was very vague during her testimony
about her mental health condition and therapy. She admitted having a psychiatrist and
psychologist  treating  her  in  State  A  before  moving  to  State  B,  her  current  state  of
residence, in 2017. However, her testimony ended at that point. She also admitted that
she was getting prescribed medication from a medical provider in State B before the 2020
incident  described  below,  but  was  unable  to  tell  me  whether  this  person  was  a
psychiatrist. Much of the information about her prior mental health history was obtained
by a DoD mental health consultant  (MHC) and is contained in her report,  Government
Exhibit 2, further discussed under Paragraph 2, below. (Tr. 31-33, 43.)
1.a.  Applicant  was  involuntarily  hospitalized  for  mental-health  treatment  for  two
weeks starting January 22, 2020. She had been arrested by police on that day because
she  had  been  knocking  on  random  peoples’  doors  attempting  to  gain  entry.  She  was
threatening to “stomp” the wife of an ex-boyfriend of hers from 40 years before and teach
that person a  lesson. During  the  course of the hospitalization  she was  diagnosed with
Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type. After two weeks she was able to be discharged
in fair condition. (Government Exhibit 2 at 5-6, Exhibit 3; Tr. 30-31, 33-37.)
The intake notes stated the following:
During  the  interview  the  patient  [Applicant]  was  hyperverbal,  quite
disorganized with labile mood, laughing inappropriately, continued to make
threatening  remarks  to  others  and  at  this  point  is  too  unpredictable  and
confused  to  be  safely  managed  at  the  lower  level  of  care.  (Government
Exhibit 3 at 1.)
Applicant testified that she had little to no memory of the incidents that led to her
involuntary hospitalization. She testified that before those incidents she had been feeling
ill  and  believes  she  threw  up  her  medications.  She  also  did  not  describe  in  detail  the
course of hospitalization. (Tr. 26-27, 33, 38-42.)
1.b. Applicant received an evaluation from MHC in November 2021. The consultant
interviewed  Applicant,  conducted  a  screening  test,  and  reviewed  her  mental  health
records.  She  diagnosed  Applicant  as  suffering  from  a  Schizoaffective  Disorder.
(Government Exhibit 2.)
MHC’s
OBSERVATIONS:
report  stated
the
following  under
the  heading  BEHAVIORAL
Upon  initiation  of  the  interview,  [Applicant]  presented  with  an  upbeat,
chipper, and  playful  tone.  Her demeanor  was  highly  childlike,  particularly
apparent through her use of language. Her affect was incongruent with what
would  be  expected  given  the  circumstances  for  the  assessment.  She
appeared  disoriented  and  disconnected  at  various  points  throughout  the
interview,  and  her  thoughts  were  highly disorganized.  Her  thoughts  were
often difficult to follow, and many of her narratives required clarification.
While  [Applicant]  expressed  a  history  of  engagement  in  therapy,  self-
reflection,  and  healing,  she  appears  to  present  with  limited  insight
surrounding her mental health functioning. Though she spoke openly about
a trauma history, her awareness of her history of psychotic symptoms was
minimal. She has a history of impaired judgment, stemming from apparent
distortions in perception, information gathered through the clinical interview
was  disorganized  and  periodically  incoherent,  contributing  to  difficulty
establishing  a  clear  understanding  of  [Applicant’s]  mental  health  history.
(Government Exhibit 2 at 8.)
MHC stated the following under the heading DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS AND
PROGNOSIS:
The   assessment  sought  to   clarify  [Applicant’s]  current  level  of   emotional
functioning,  given   her  recent  inpatient  hospitalization   in  2020.   While
[Applicant’s]  mental  health   appeared   to   decompensate   in   response   to
increasing  stressors surrounding  the  COVID-19  pandemic, the  assessment
revealed   longstanding   patterns   of  instability  in  mood,   distortion   in
perception, and  interpersonal issues for [Applicant]. She  is currently actively
engaged   in   psychiatric  care   with   a   nurse   practitioner,   and   [Applicant]   is
taking   her  medications  as  prescribed   in  order  to   manage   her  mood   and
psychotic   symptoms.   It   is   noteworthy   that   she   presents   with   incredibly
limited   insight  around   her   history  of  psychosis,  which   is  common   for
individuals   with   delusional   ideation.   At  present,   [Applicant]   denied   any
current  symptoms   to   suggest  an   active   mood   episode,  such   as  a
depressive,  manic,  or  hypomanic  state.  As   psychotic  symptoms   were
evident in  the  absence  of a  mood  episode, the  current assessment supports
her previous   diagnosis   of   Schizoaffective   Disorder.  Though   she   does  not
appear to  be  at  an  acute  risk for acting  erratically or harming  herself,  she
continues to  present with  disorganized  thinking  and  distortions in perception
that warrant concern regarding  her current functioning. Her prognosis  is fair,
given the nature of her mental health issues.  (Government Exhibit 2  at 10.)
(Emphasis in original.)
MHC stated her CONSLUSIONS:
Based  on  information  gathered  through  the  assessment,  [Applicant]
presents with a  significant mental health history with active  indications  of
delusional ideation and disorganization in thinking. Due to her distortions in
perception, there are considerable concerns about her judgment, reliability,
and  trustworthiness  at  this  time,  as  well  as  her  long-term  prognosis.
(Government Exhibit 2 at 10.)
Applicant began seeing an Adult Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (NP)
after her discharge from the mental hospital in January 2020. NP’s CV is Applicant Exhibit
K. NP prescribes medication for Applicant to attempt to control her condition. NP sees
Applicant every one to two months for medication control and therapy. (Tr. 37, 43-44.)
NP submitted  a written statement dated  September 1, 2022. (Applicant Exhibit J.)
She  stated, “In  the  time  that I have  been  working  with  her [Applicant],  she  has  maintained
psychiatric stability on  the  current medication  regimen.” She  concludes  that her  working
diagnosis for Applicant  is: “Posttraumatic  Stress Disorder.”  (Emphasis in original.)
NP’s statement goes on:
Symptom  history  includes:  unwanted  persistent  memories,  emotional
distress after exposure to traumatic reminders, avoidance of trauma related
thoughts or feelings and external reminders, negative affect, exaggerated
blame  of  self  for  causing  the  trauma,  hypervigilance,  heightened  startle
reaction,  destructive  behavior,  and  dissociation.  These  symptoms  have
persisted since childhood in varying capacities.
She has been treated for these symptoms with  psychotropic medications
and individual therapy and has developed great insight over time. She has
learned  to  manage  her  symptoms,  many  of  which  have  completely
subsided, in a way that has allowed her to live a comfortable and successful
life with no known deficits in her employment or personal life to date.
NP  submitted  a  second  statement  after  the  hearing.  (Applicant  Exhibit  L.)  The
document stated in pertinent part:
After review of document Guideline I, it is in my assessment that [Applicant]
has  maintained  steady  medication  and  treatment  compliance  voluntarily
since  her  release  from  the  hospital  in  January  2020.  Her  psychiatric
symptoms have remained well controlled and in remission because of her
commitment to this treatment. She meets with me monthly and prognosis is
good.
Based on her presentation and treatment progress over the past 2½ years,
I  have  no  reason  to  believe  that  she  would  experience  a  relapse  of
symptoms similar to the episode experienced in January 2020 as long as
she maintains compliance with medications and mental health treatment.
Applicant testified  that the  incident in January 2020  was a  “Singular incident.  One-
time   thing.”  She   further  testified   that  nothing   like   that  had   occurred   before  or  after  the
incident. (Tr. 44.)
In  conclusion  Applicant  stated,  “I  believe  I  deserve a  Security Clearance.  I’ve  done
nothing   wrong,  and   I’m   a   credit  to   having   a   Security  Clearance.   And   I’m   safe   with
classified information. I’m trustworthy with classified information.” (Tr. 45.)
Mitigation
Applicant submitted  documentation  showing  that she  is a  respected  and  effective
software   engineer.  Her  evaluations  show  ratings  of  “Successful  Performer.”   She   has
received  performance  awards from  her employer. (Applicant Exhibits A, B, C, D,  F, and

"In Applicant’s answer, he denied the sole SOR  allegation. After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is 63 years old. He is single, has never married and he has no children.
He has worked for a federal contractor since 2015 as an electronics technician. He was
granted a  security  clearance in 2016.  He  served  in the  U.S. Marine  Corps  (active and
reserve) from 1978-1983. He also served in the U.S. Army reserve from 1990 to 1996.
He received honorable discharges for all this service. He holds two associate’s degrees
in computer science and networking. (Tr.2 at 5, 17-19, 59, 62; GE 1)
The SOR alleged that in December 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed
psychologist who opined that Applicant’s history of delusional beliefs, persecutory ideas,
and limited insight may impair his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. (SOR ¶ 1.a)
In March 2020, Applicant reported to his employer that while he was at a casino,
he  believed  his  truck  was  broken  into  and  his  backpack  containing  his  security
credentials  was  ransacked.  Nothing  was  taken,  but  he  was  concerned  that  his
credentials  had  been  compromised,  which  is  why  he  reported  it.  No  evidence  of  a
break-in  was  discovered  by  the  law  enforcement  agency  investigating  this  incident.
Because  Applicant  had  reported  other  break-ins  to  both  his  residence  and  his  truck
previously,  which  were  unsubstantiated,  his  employer  sent  him  for  a  fitness  for  duty
examination In May 2020. (GE 5)
Applicant’s  fitness  for  duty  examination  was  conducted  by  Dr.  K,  a  doctor  of
osteopath  (DO).  Ten  days  before  the  fitness  for  duty  physical  examination,  a
psychological  evaluation  was  conducted  that  apparently  did  not  detect  evidence  of  a
psychotic  disorder.  There  is  no  information  about  who  conducted  this  examination.
Applicant  described for Dr.  K  an  incident that  occurred  in 2016  where  he  had an IRS-
issued  refund  check  stolen  from  him  that  was  later  cashed.  The  check  was  replaced
and he cashed  it.  He claimed that the IRS told  him  they  would continue  to investigate
this  incident.  Since  then,  he  believed  that  his  truck  and  home  have  been  broken  into
several times, although he found nothing taken each time. (GE 5)
Dr. K listed the following clinical impressions he made about Applicant regarding
his mental health: Applicant suffered from minor post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
which Dr. K found to be stable with no effect on Applicant’s work environment. He also
thought  Applicant  suffered  from  mild  paranoid/compulsive  thought  process  without
psychiatric illness. He concluded that Applicant was fit for duty. (GE 5)
Applicant  also  sent  a  letter  to  his  employer  after  the  alleged  March  2020  truck
break-in  wherein  he  specifically  alleged  that  employees  of  a  local  security  company
were the ones that broke into his truck. He went on to allege that this security company
had  been  harassing  him  for  the  past  two  years.  He  wrote  that  the  company  has
“continued  harassing,  bullying,  tormenting,  threatening  and  terrorizing  me  on  a  daily
bases  [sic].”  He  also  accused  this  company  of  sending  someone  to  scare  his  elderly
mother  who  lives  in  another  state.  He  further  claimed  that  the  local  police  would  not
investigate his allegation without some proof of wrongdoing by the company. Applicant
provided  no  proof  of  the  security  company’s  involvement  in  any  of  these  allegations.
(Tr.2  at  72;  GE  3,  5  (Note:  in  Applicant’s  letter  to  his  employer,  he  described  that  the
March 2020, truck break-in occurred at a grocery store, but during his interview with Dr.
K, he described the same event as happening at a casino))
After receiving the letter from Applicant, his employer asked local enforcement to
conduct a health and welfare check of him at his residence. The check was conducted
and  Applicant  informed  the  officers  that  he  believed  his  neighbors  upstairs,  who  he
alleged  worked  for  the  security  company,  were  conducting  surveillance  on  him  and
breaking into his truck and apartment. The officers questioned the neighbors but found
nothing to connect them with Applicant’s allegations. (Tr.2 at 73-75; GE 2)
Applicant  testified  that  his  truck  was  broken  into  every  day  for  two  years,  or
approximately 700 times. He knew this because he noticed small differences when he
got into his truck like the mirrors’ different positions, the visor’s position, and the position
of  his  handicap  placard.  He  did  not  file  police  reports  about  these  break-ins.  He  also
believes his apartment was broken into in 2018, while he visited his mother. He testified
that  he  believes  his  mother  was  surveilled  and  harassed  in  2018.  He  believes  the
security company is behind all these incidents, but admitted he had no proof supporting
his beliefs. He admitted placing “posters” over all of his light switches in his apartment in
order to block any cameras that might be imbedded in them.  (Tr.2  at 80, 83, 123-124,
158-159)
In the processing of this security clearance adjudication, the DOD requested that
Applicant  participate  in  a  psychological  examination.  In  December  2021,  Dr.  S,  a
licensed  psychologist  with  a  doctor  of  psychology  degree  (PsyD),  and  who  is  board
certified  in  behavior  and  cognitive  psychology,  conducted  a  semi-structured  clinical
interview with Applicant, reviewed self-report questionnaires, reviewed medical records,
and  conducted  clinical  testing  (including  the  Minnesota  Multiphasic  Personality
Inventory-28  (MMPI)).  Dr.  S  prepared  a  report  of  the  evaluation  dated  December  20,
2021. ( GE 7)
Applicant  disclosed  to  Dr.  S  the  triggering  incident  leading  to  his  suspicions,
which  was  the  allegedly  stolen  IRS  check  in  2016,  and  which  led  to  his  belief  that  he
and his family was being investigated and harassed by the IRS or their agents through
2020. He related his concern about his truck break-in, his apartment break-in, concerns
about  his  upstairs  neighbors  who  he  believed  placed  sensors  in  his  carpet,  controlled
his television set (although Applicant testified that he did not own a television), and that
his water faucets were turned on randomly at night to disrupt his sleep. He also claimed
his mother was being harassed. In his hearing testimony, he denied that he told Dr. S
any of these things. He also claimed that his interview only lasted about 15 minutes. He
admitted during cross-examination that he did not file a complaint against Dr. S for lying
in her report about what comprised his clinical interview. (Tr.2 at 100-105, 143; GE 7)
Based upon Applicant’s clinical interview, his test results, and his medical history,
Dr. S opined the following:
1.  Review  of  Applicant’s  MMPI  results  revealed  a  pattern  of  underreporting
suggesting he answered the questions in such a way to put a positive light by denying
common faults or shortcomings;
2.  Based  upon  his  MMPI  results  and  other  self-report  measures,  Applicant
appears to exhibit a pattern of avoidance and denial of symptoms or limited insight into
the presence of symptoms; and
3.  Based  upon  Applicant’s  history  of  delusional  beliefs,  persecutory  ideas,  and
limited insight, his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are impaired.
Dr.  S  formally  diagnosed  Applicant,  under  the  Diagnostic  and  Statical  Manual-fifth
edition  (DSM-5)  with  Delusional  Disorder,  persecutory  type  (DSM-5  297.1).  She
recommended  that  Applicant  engage  in  a  thorough  personality  assessment  and/or
neuropsychological  evaluation  to  determine  the  specific  mental  health  condition  likely
contributing  to  his  paranoid  thinking  and  ongoing  fixed  belief  structure.  Since  the
evaluations by Dr. K, Dr. S, and Dr. T (see below), Applicant has not participated in any
counseling. (Tr.2 at 157; GE 7)
On  December 12, 2022,  Applicant’s  attorney referred him  to  Dr.  T for their own
psychological assessment. Dr. T has a Ph.D. in counseling and is a licensed marriage
and  family  therapist  (LMFT),  and  a  certified  employee  assistance  professional.  Dr.  T
conducted a two-hour interview with Applicant and reviewed Dr. K’s and Dr. S’s reports.
Dr.  T  did  not  review  any  of  Applicant’s  medical  records,  background  investigation
records,  or  conduct  any  psychological  testing.  Dr.  T  prepared  a  report  reflecting  her
findings and opinions. (Tr.2 at 23-24, 28, 40-48; GE 5, 7; AE A)
During Applicant’s interview with Dr. T, he reported several events to her that he
denied  telling  Dr.  S  about  during  her  clinical  interview.  These  events  included  his
assertion that he was the victim of a home break-in by the IRS or a security company
working for the IRS, that the security company people moved into an apartment above
his  apartment,  and  that  he  had  his  truck  broken  into  multiple  times.  (Tr.2  at  100-101,
104; GE 7; GE 7; AE A)
Based upon Applicant’s clinical interview, and a review of both Dr. K’s, fitness for
duty  evaluation,  Dr.  S’s  report,  and  her  training  and  experience,  Dr.  T  opined  the
following:
1. Applicant does not appear to present with psychological symptoms that would
impair his judgment at this time or working within his scope of practice and knowledge;
2.  Applicant  denied  a  history  of  delusional  or  psychotic  process,  and  none  is
currently evident;
3.  Applicant  demonstrated  no  “fixed  beliefs”  regarding  whether  the  IRS  had
surveilled  him,  rather,  he  posited  that  as  the  only  possibility  that  came  to  him,  which
could explain the events that transpired.
Dr.  T  opined  that  Applicant’s  mental  state  was  healthy,  although  he  appeared  naïve
concerning his beliefs about his view of the IRS surveilling him. She also did not believe
Applicant  fit  the  diagnosis  for  paranoia  because  he  only  expressed  his  paranoia
regarding his concern about the IRS and not everything else in his life. (Tr.2 at 27-28,
30-32, 34)
Character  Evidence.
Applicant presented a letter from his supervisor for the last five years, who stated
that  Applicant  “has  never  given  him  a  reason  to  believe  he  is  a  threat  to  national
security.”  He  does  not  state  whether  he  was  aware  of  the  reasons  why  Applicant’s
clearance was being reviewed. (AE B)
Applicant  presented  a  letter  from  a  coworker  who  has  worked  with  him  for  four

clearances.”  He  also  views  Applicant  as  a  dependable  and  stable  man.  He  does  not
state  whether  he  was  aware  of  the  reasons  why  Applicant’s  clearance  was  being
reviewed. (AE C)

"Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about July 2019. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2016. He
married in 1995 and divorced in 2016. He and his ex-wife reconciled about a year later
and  have  lived  together  since,  but  they  have  not  remarried.  They  have  four  children,
including  one  that  was  born  after  they  reconciled.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  at  17-19,  33-35;
Applicant’s response to SOR: GE 1, 2)
Applicant  indicated  that he  was battling  untreated  depression  for  about ten  years
before   2016.   He  started   receiving   counseling   in   about  August   2016.  His   marriage   was
extremely troubled  at the  time. He and  his then  wife  lived  in the  same house  but  were
essentially  separated   and   were  dating   other   people.  On   September  3,  2016,  he   came
home  and  had  sexual intercourse with  his then  wife  without  her  consent.  (Tr. at 16, 20-
23, 27-28; GE  2-5)  Applicant testified  about  the incident  at his hearing:
DEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Do you recall it happening?
APPLICANT: I did. I do. All right. At the time, my recollection of it is that, like she
said, I got home late. I was sleeping on the couch at the time, and she came out
to the living room where I was. She had -- all she had on was her underwear and
a V-Neck T-shirt, a V-Neck shirt. And she had just gotten out of the shower, and
she sat down right next to me. And I realize that, yes if she was saying no -- that I
should  have  stopped  but  I  didn't.  But,  at  that  time,  I  believe  I  felt  like  she  was
giving me an invitation because of the way she was dressed.
DEPARTMENT  COUNSEL:  All right. I don't think I’m in a position where I need to
Mirandize you. But is it possible that she may have said no?
APPLICANT: Yes. I believe she did, yes. Yes. (Tr. at 28-29)
On  September  4,  2016,  Applicant’s  wife  at  the  time  went  to  a  hotel.  On
September  5,  2016,  she  went  to  their  house  to  pack  items  to  take  to  her  mother’s
house, Applicant helped her by carrying some items out to her car. She reported that he
suddenly  got  angry  and  broke  a  dresser.  He  stated  that  he  accidentally  dropped  the
dresser. (Tr. at 27-28; GE 2-5)
On September 6, 2016, Applicant was “in the middle of a mental break,” and he
was brought to a mental health clinic by a woman that he was dating and his then wife.
His conduct and words were bizarre. He told the APN (advanced practice nurse) that he
hated his then wife and thought about killing her. He thought about shooting her in the
face or stabbing her. The assessments were psychosis, rule out fixed delusions; major
depression,  recurrent;  and  other  sexual  dysfunction  not  due  to  a  substance  or  known
psychological condition. Applicant was transported to a hospital, and his then wife was
informed of his threats against her and issued a strong recommendation that she seek a
protection  order  for  herself  and  her  children.  She  received  a  temporary  order  of
protection from the court on September 6, 2016. (Tr. at 23-26; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 3-5)
Applicant admitted during his hearing testimony that when he was at the mental
health  clinic,  he  threatened  suicide,  and  he  threatened  to  kill  his  then  wife.  He  also
admitted that he was “hearing voices” for a short period. He stated that it sounded like
somebody  was  talking  in  the  next  room,  but  he  could  not  hear  specific  words  or  what
was being said. He has not heard voices since that period. (Tr. at 27, 32-33)
Applicant was hospitalized as an inpatient at a psychiatric facility from September
7,  2016,  through  September  14,  2016.  During  his  intake  evaluation,  he  admitted  that
before he was hospitalized, he wanted to kill himself and his then wife, but that was no
longer true. He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, severe without psychotic
features. (Tr. at 26; GE 6, 7)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
July 2019. He reported his mental health treatment and hospitalization. He added, “My
wife  and  I  were  going  through  a  divorce.  I  was  at  my  counselor  and  indicated  that  I
wanted  to  kill  myself.  I  was  subsequently  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder.”
(GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  November  2019.
They  discussed  his  mental  health  treatment.  He  stated  that  he  had  been  battling
depression for ten years. He admitted that he told a counselor in September 2016 that
he had thoughts of harming himself and his then spouse. He told the investigator that he
did not believe he forced his then wife to have sexual relations with him. He stated that
she told him that she did not want to have sex, but she did not stop him. He stated that
he made no threats and committed no acts of violence. He stated that he did not throw
a dresser; he accidentally dropped it. (GE 2)
A psychological evaluation was conducted at the DOD’s request on February 16,
2022,  by  a  licensed  clinical  psychologist  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  psychologist).  A
report  of  the  evaluation  was  prepared  on  February  24,  2022.  They  discussed  his
hospitalization  in  2016.  He  stated  that  he  told  the  provider  in  2016  that  he  was  not
having  thoughts  of  hurting  himself  or  someone  else.  He  stated  that  the  provider  then
asked him, if he could kill his spouse, how would he commit the act, to which he said, “I
guess  I’ll  stab  her.”  He  told  the  psychologist  that  he  did  not  have  any  intent  to  do  so.
Regarding  the  incident  with  his  then  wife,  he  told  the  psychologist  that  they  began
“touching each other”  and eventually had intercourse. He stated that he thought it was
consensual, and that he did not think it was rape because she never said “no.” (GE 8)
The psychologist diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder, severe, in
partial remission. She concluded:
Regardless  of  the  diagnosis, it  is clear that [Applicant] lacks  insight  into his
condition and his need for treatment. He expressed  multiple risk factors for
relapse   of  depressive   symptoms,  including   limited   hobbies  of  interest,
poor  sleep   quality,   relocation   from   his  “home   town”   of  approximately  40
years at the  request of his spouse, significant physical ailments, and  lack
of personal friendships  in the  area  that he  has lived  for over two  years. He
has  not  undergone   appropriate   mental  health   treatment,   to   date,  for  the
condition   that   [led]   to   legal  issues  and   psychiatric  hospitalization.
Therefore,  he  does  possess  a  mental health   condition   that  could  impede
his  reliability,  judgment,   stability,  and   trustworthiness.  His  prognosis  is
guarded.  (GE 8)
Applicant continued in counseling and therapy after his 2016 hospitalization until
about 2017. He has remained on anti-depressant medication. He stated that he has not
had  any  issues  since  the  events  leading  up  to  his  hospitalization.  He  stated  that  he
would seek help if he “ever felt like [he] was heading down that road again.” (Tr. at 17,
23, 29-31, 35-36)
Applicant’s employee evaluations for the last three years reflect outstanding job
performance.  His  supervisor  for  the  last  three  and  a  half  years  wrote  that  Applicant  is
“simply amazing.” He further stated that Applicant “handles himself with an exceedingly
high level of decorum and professionalism. I have absolute faith and trust in his integrity
and personal accountability.” (AE A, B)
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
Major Depressive Disorder
The  criterion  symptoms  for  major  depressive  disorder  must  be  present  nearly
every  day  to  be  considered  present,  with  the  exception  of  weight  change  and  suicidal
ideation. . . . Fatigue and sleep disturbance are  present in a high proportion of cases;
psychomotor disturbances  are much  less common but are  indicative  of greater overall
severity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt.
The  essential  feature  of  a  major  depressive  episode  is  a  period  of  at  least  2
weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in
nearly  all  activities  .  .  .  .  Many  individuals  report  or  exhibit  increased  irritability  (e.g.,
persistent  anger,  a  tendency  to  respond  to  events  with  angry  outbursts  or  blaming
others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor events).

"Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  October  2019.  He  received  a  high  school  diploma  in  2003.  He  has  not
been married and has no  children. He  served  on active  reserve duty  with  the  U.S.  Air
Force from 2005 to 2013 and received an honorable discharge. (Items 3, 8)
Applicant has a history of mental health issues and inpatient hospitalizations. He
has  been  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  and  unspecified  psychotic  disorder  by  a  duly
qualified  mental  health  professional.  His  mental-health  disorders  cause  periods  of
psychosis where he suffers from delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and memory loss.
He began experiencing these symptoms in about 2010. (Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8)
In  late  November  2019,  Applicant  checked  himself  into  an  inpatient  hospital  for
mental  health  treatment  because  he  was  suffering  from  an  increase  in  audio-visual
hallucinations, high  anxiety,  and insomnia.  During  this inpatient  treatment, he  reported
that,  for  years,  he  had  been  misusing  prescription  Xanax  and  prescription  Ambien  by
taking  more  than  the  amount  he  was  prescribed.  He  also  reported  that  he  had  been
binge  drinking  about  a  pint  of  liquor  one  to  two  times  per  week  to  help  him  sleep.
According  to  his  medical  records  form  this  hospital,  combining  alcohol  with  several  of
the  prescription  drugs  he  was  taking  is  a  misuse  of  those  prescription  drugs.  This
inpatient treatment lasted for about a week. During this treatment, a certified psychiatric
nurse practitioner diagnosed him with an unspecified schizophrenic spectrum and other
psychotic disorder, and an unspecified stimulant use disorder (moderate). (Items 2, 3, 5,
7, 8)
In  January  2020,  Applicant  reported  that  he  voluntarily  checked  himself  in  to
another inpatient hospital because he was again suffering from psychosis. There is no
evidence  in  the  record  as  to  how  long  this  second  inpatient  hospitalization  lasted,  the
specific  treatment  he  received,  or  whether  he  was  diagnosed  with  a  mental  health
disorder. (Items 2, 3, 7)
Applicant was evaluated at the DOD’s request by a licensed psychiatrist, and the
report of the evaluation was issued on March 8, 2022. After meeting with him virtually,
reviewing the results of an online psychological inventory, and reviewing Items 3, 5, 6,
and  8,  the  DOD’s  licensed  psychiatrist  found  his  condition  to  be  “suspicious  for
schizophrenia,”  but  diagnosed  him  with  an  unspecified  psychotic  disorder  and
polysubstance  abuse  of  alcohol  and  prescription  medication.  She  opined  that  his
conditions are likely to impair his reliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness, and
that his prognosis was guarded. Her prognosis was partly based upon the premise that
he  was  not  receiving  psychiatric  treatment,  but  he  had  made  an  appointment  to  start
doing so. According to a letter from his treatment provider dated October 20, 2022, he
received  psychiatric  treatment  from  a  licensed  psychiatric  nurse  practitioner  since
March  28,  2022,  and  he  remained  stable  on  his  current  medication  and  treatment
regimen. This licensed psychiatric nurse practitioner diagnosed him with schizophrenia
and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). (Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  made  poor decisions  and  has  shown  poor
judgment  when  he  is suffering  from  psychosis.  For  example,  in  March  2020,  when  he
was  suffering  from  psychosis,  he  drove  while  he  was  intoxicated.  He  claimed  that  he
would not have driven while intoxicated if he had not been suffering from psychosis. He
also claimed that he has only abused his prescription medications and alcohol when he
was  in  a  period  of  psychosis  and  claimed  that  he  would  not  have  abused  those
substances otherwise. (Items 2-8)
Applicant claimed that he is feeling better mentally. He claimed that his treatment
with a licensed psychiatric nurse practitioner has helped, and that he plans to continue
that  treatment,  including  following  her  advice  regarding  prescription  medication.  He
claimed  he  has  had  no  episodes  of  psychosis  after  his  January  2020  inpatient
hospitalization. He claimed that he has learned better coping mechanisms. At the time
of his meeting with the DOD psychiatrist, he had recently moved in with his father and
lived  closer  to  his  siblings  and  one  of  his  good  friends.  He  noted  that  he  has  sought
inpatient treatment whenever he has a period of psychosis. He did not indicate whether
he  still  suffers  from  audio  or  visual  hallucinations  or  paranoia.  He  has  not  received
substance  abuse  counseling  other  than  detoxification.  The  DOD  licensed  psychiatrist
opined that he should be receiving treatment for substance abuse. She also noted that
he  had  a  lower-than-average  motivation  for  treatment  level  compared  to  others  with
mental  health  issues  and  that  he  sees  little  need  for  changes  in  his  behavior.  She
opined that these qualities are poor prognostic indicators. (Items 2, 3, 7, 8)
In  February  2008,  Applicant  drove  while  intoxicated.  He  was  stopped  by  police
and  arrested  for  aggravated  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  He  was
convicted of this crime. He spent four days in jail and had to pay fines. (Items 2-4, 7)
In  March  2020,  Applicant  was  consuming  alcohol  while  in  a  state  of  psychosis.
His dog got out of his house and went missing. Applicant drove his car while intoxicated
to attempt to find his dog. While he was driving while intoxicated, he struck a power line
pole  with  his  vehicle.  Police  arrested  him  and  charged  him  with  extreme  DUI  (.15  per
cent blood alcohol content (BAC) or higher). He spent the night in jail. In July 2021, he
pleaded guilty  to a  lesser charge of  reckless driving.  The court suspended  his  driver’s
license  for  90  days  and  ordered  him  to  pay  about  $1,300  in  fines.  The  court  also
ordered  him  to  undergo  an  online  drug  and  alcohol  screening.  As  of  his  June  2020
security  interview,  he  had  not  taken  this  online  screening  and  has  not  provided  any
evidence that he has since completed it. (Items 2-4, 6-8)
Applicant  provided  inconsistent  information  about  his  alcohol  consumption.
During  his  2019  inpatient  hospitalization,  Applicant  reported  his  aforementioned
consumption of a pint of liquor one to two times per week. During his June 2020 security
interview,  he  told  the  investigator  that  he  drinks  four  beers  about  four  to  five  hours
before  he  takes  his prescription  medications.  He  told  the  DOD  licensed  psychiatrist  in
March 2022 that he had not consumed alcohol since his 2020 DUI arrest. He also told
her that he had not consumed alcohol in about eight months. He later told her that it had
been a year since he last had alcohol. In his response to the SOR, he claimed that  he
now rarely drinks alcohol and only has a couple of drinks when he does. He provided no
evidence  that  he  is  permitted  to  consume  alcohol  while  on  his  current  prescription
medication regimen. (Items 2, 5, 7, 8)
Beginning in about June 2013, for a little  over two years, Applicant misused his
employer-issued  company  credit  card  by  using  it  to  pay  about  $86,000  for  personal
expenses. In April 2016, his employer fired him for this credit card misuse. He claimed
that he thought there was an unwritten rule that he could use the company credit card
for personal expenses if he timely paid off his balance. However, he did not timely pay
off  the balance.  He claimed  that he  has  since  satisfied the account  after paying  about
$20,000 on it over two years. He provided no documentary evidence of this resolution.
He claimed that he now understands this misuse was wrong and he has not misused a
company credit card since 2015. (Items 2, 3, 7, 8)

"In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶ 1.b,  1.c, and
1.d. (HE 3)  He denied  the  allegations in SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.e.  He also  provided  mitigating
information.  His admissions  are  accepted as findings  of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  technician  for  various  training  devices  for  complex
aviation systems. (Tr. 6, 9) In 1999, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) In 2017, he
received an associate degree in programming and game design, and in 2001, he received
a bachelor’s degree in electronics engineering. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1) He served in the Air Force
from  2002  to  2014,  and  he  received  an  honorable  discharge.  (Tr.  7)  When  he  was

punishments while in the Air Force. (Tr. 7) He did not receive a medical discharge from
the  Air  Force.  (Tr. 8) The  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA) has  awarded  him  a  70
percent disability rating, which includes 50 percent for adjustment disorder and anxiety
disorder. (Tr. 8)
Psychological Conditions
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant has a history of being unable to control his anger and
having angry outbursts, including at work. Applicant disagreed with SOR ¶ 1.a because
he can control his anger and has never physically attacked anyone. (SOR response) His
angry  outbursts  are  not  random.  (Tr.  81)  The  angry  outbursts  were  caused  by  an
argument  with  someone.  (Tr.  81)  He  said  he  has  an  exaggerated  response  to  real
provocation. (Tr. 83) He believes he has the tools to enable him to respond appropriately
to provocations. (Tr. 83)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant experienced suicidal ideations on various occasions
between at least about 1998 and 2018. He said suicidal ideations are common, and he
has successfully overcome these issues. (SOR response) He was 17 years old in 1998,
and  he  had  some  issues  relating  to  being  verbally  bullied  in  high  school.  (Tr.  21)  His
symptoms of depression and suicidality dissipated when he left high school and entered
college. (Tr. 21)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges in about 2004, Applicant received a letter of reprimand and was
referred for mental-health treatment after he told his Air Force supervisor that he thought
about killing him and that he should have killed him.
Applicant’s argument with his supervisor, a technical sergeant (E-7), began with a
discussion of the proper drill bit to use to remove rivets. (Tr. 25) After a brief discussion,
the technical sergeant told Applicant, who was a senior airman (E-4), to come into the
office. (Tr. 25) Applicant’s immediate supervisor, a staff sergeant (E-5) was in the office
as an observer. (Tr. 27) Once they were in the office, the argument became heated, and
Applicant threatened to “take his supervisor out now.” (Tr. 23-24, 27) Applicant said he
was inconsolable; however, he did not actually intend to kill his supervisor. (Tr. 28) His
supervisor suggested that he obtain counseling. (Tr. 30) He received counseling, and he
was  prescribed  Wellbutrin  for  anxiety.  (Tr.  33-34)  He  took  Wellbutrin  for  about  two
months.  (Tr.  33-34)  He  had  side  effects,  including  headaches,  and  he  had  another
outburst in the middle of a physical training session. (Tr. 34) He was advised to stop taking
it.  (Tr.  30,  34)  He  was  not  prescribed  anything  to  replace  the  Wellbutrin.  (Tr.  35)  He
attended counseling twice a month for about three months. (Tr. 33) During his follow-up
treatment, he was possibly diagnosed with Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. (Tr. 31)
In March 2010, Applicant was assigned to an Air Force base in the United States,
and he was scheduled to deploy overseas. (Tr. 37-38) He was worried that he might have
a nervous breakdown if he was around the wrong people, and he advised his command
that he may have problems if he is deployed. (Tr. 37-39) A March 2, 2010 medical note
states:
Pt stated his anxiety interferes with his everyday activities. He stated he is
social[ly]  isolated  from  everyday  activities.  Member  prefers  to  stay  at  his
residence for fear of anxiety of what others will think. Pt stated his anxiety
is so severe he cannot go into a store by himself. . . . Pt reported he was
taking psychotropic medications for his issues but felt they did not work and
gave him headaches. Pt reported he did not have a very close relationship
with his family. . . . Pt reported having severe anger issues to the point of
kick[ing] and throwing stuff. His last reported episode of getting angry was
a few weeks ago at a fellow co-worker. Pt reported sleeping 2-3 hrs a night
and eating only one meal a day. Pt stated he has passive [suicidal ideation]
(not  currently)  but  denies  any  suicidal  plan,  intent  or  urges.  Pt  denied
homicidal ideation/plan/intent/urges. (Tr. 44; GE 6 at 46)
Applicant said the March 2, 2010 medical note was accurate. (Tr. 45) In June 2010, his
treating  physician  prescribed  Zoloft;  however,  it  was  not  effective,  and  Applicant  had
headaches. (Tr. 45-46; GE 6 at 21) Applicant did not accept and comply with the medical
advice. (Tr. 45) He received a mental-health evaluation, and his command removed him
from the list of personnel being deployed because of anxiety. (Tr. 37-38, 41-42)
Applicant took Celexa for two years; however, he believed he did not remember
when he took Celexa. (Tr. 48-49; GE 6 at 22) He did not have any negative side effects
from Celexa; however, he did not believe he received any positive effects from it. (Tr. 50)
A September 15, 2010 medical note indicates he was prescribed Prozac; however, he
never picked up his Prozac because he does not like taking psychiatric medications. (Tr.
47;  GE  6  at  16)  He  did  not  take  any  medications  after  September  2010.  (Tr.  50)  He
stopped seeing a mental-health practitioner in October 2010. (Tr. 51)
On  October  17,  2010,  Applicant  called  the  mental-health  clinic  and  advised  his
anxiety symptoms were returning and he wanted an appointment. (GE 6 at 5) He received
an appointment on October 29, 2010, and an October 29, 2010 medical note states, “Pt
[states] he no longer wishes to continue mental health treatment, despite no change in
his poorly controlled social anxiety [signs and symptoms]. Strongly recommend to pt that
he reconsider his decision. Pt [states] he is sure about his current decision to terminate
treatment.” (Tr. 53; GE 6 at 7)
On  October  29,  2012,  Applicant  went  to  the  mental-health  clinic,  and  he  was
diagnosed with Social Anxiety. (GE 6 at 3) The treatment plan was for him to return to the
clinic on a weekly basis for 10 weeks. (Id.) The next medical note is Applicant was a “no
show” for an appointment on November 8, 2012. (Id. at 1) At his hearing, Applicant said
he did not remember why he sought treatment in October 2012. (Tr. 55)
Anger  management  was  suggested  for  Applicant;  however,  he  never  received
anger management counseling. (Tr. 59) He said, “My anger outbursts always coincided
with quite a bit of hostility towards me or pressure or something along those lines. I just
don’t get randomly angry.” (Tr. 59) He described his outbursts as a defensive response
or  mechanism  to  being  patronized  or  “ganged  up  on.”  (Tr.  76)  His  response  is  to
“randomly say stuff.” (Tr. 76) His responses are primarily verbal outbursts, and  he  has
never harmed anyone. (Tr. 77-78)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges in about November 2018, Applicant attempted suicide. During
his  follow-up  hospitalization,  he  was  diagnosed  with  Adjustment  Disorder,  Unspecified
Personality  Disorder  with  Borderline  Traits,  and  Social  Anxiety  Disorder.  In  his  SOR
response, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.d without any elaboration or explanation.
Applicant  has experienced  suicidal ideations  periodically from  high  school to  the
present  day. (Tr. 64-65) In  November 2018, Applicant’s long-term  girlfriend  (five  years)
texted   him   that  their   relationship   was  over,   and   he   went  home   and   discovered   her
belongings were  gone  as well as most of the  household items. (Tr. 60; GE  5  at 1)  He
videotaped a 10-minute will. (GE 4 at 5) He was overwhelmed  and triggered. (Tr. 60) He
went to  sleep, and  when  he  woke  up, he  took a  steak knife  and  superficially cut his wrists.
(Tr. 61;  GE  5  at  1) He  sent  a  message  on  the  Internet,  and  a  police  officer took him  to  the
hospital, where he  was  admitted  as an  inpatient  from  November 28  to  30, 2018.  (Tr. 61-
62; GE 5)  Medical records for November 2018  reflect the  diagnosis in SOR ¶  1.d. (GE 5
at 7)
On June 20, 2022, S, Ph.D., evaluated Applicant on behalf of the CAF. (GE 3) Dr.
S  diagnosed  him  with:  (1)  Social  Anxiety  Disorder,  (2)  Rule  Out  Major  Depressive
Disorder,  recurrent,  unspecified;  (3)  Personality  Disorder,  Unspecified  with  Borderline
Features (by history); and (4) Rule Out Psychotic Disorder (per MMPI-3 item responses).
(GE 3 at 5; SOR ¶ 1.e) Dr. S concluded his suicidal ideation, depression, and possible
personality disorder “could negatively impact his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness
in safeguarding classified information or working in a cleared setting.” (GE 3 at 5) Dr. S
said he had “high confidence” in the accuracy of the information received from Applicant.
He summarized his report as follows:
[Applicant’s]  recurring  suicidal  ideation  depression,  poor  engagement  in,
and  follow  through  with  psychiatric  treatment,  and  his  endorsement  of
severe psychopathology on the MMPI-3 indicate the presence of significant
mental health concerns and the need for current, ongoing, engagement in
mental health services (i.e. therapy, medication management, etc.). (GE 3
at 5)
Applicant  disagreed  with  Rule  Out  Major  Depressive  Disorder  and  Rule  Out
Psychotic Disorder because those diagnoses were preliminary and not established. (SOR
response) He was dissatisfied with previous mental-health counseling because when he
received  counseling,  the  mental-health  professional  “just  wants  to  toss  medication”  at
him. (Id.) He was advised that treatment was voluntary, and he was not told his security
clearance  was  jeopardized  by  not  accepting  medication.  (Id.)  He  requested  a  second
evaluation. (Id.)
When   Applicant   is  in   unfamiliar  surroundings  or  is   engaged   in  something
unplanned, he  gets  “very shaky and  nervous,”  and  his voice slurs and  he  slightly  stutters.
(Tr.  40)  He  avoids  situations  where  he   feels  stress.  (Tr.  40)   His   most  recent  verbal
outburst was in late 2018 or early 2019 when  he  made comments to  his boss. (Tr. 79)
Applicant   decided   not to   seek  professional assistance   in  dealing   with   his stress
and  anxiety  after he  received  the  SOR because  he  “needed  to  handle  it” himself. (Tr. 69,
73)  After he  received  the  SOR, he  was concerned  seeking  help might be  viewed  as his
acceptance   that   he   had   “psychopathy,”  that  he   was  “weak  minded,”  or   that  he   was
“regressing” because  of the  timing. (Tr. 74-75) He plans to  seek counseling  in the  future
because  his security clearance  issue  has prompted  him  to  resume  treatment  in the  future.
(Tr. 70-71)  He  said  he  intends to  seek  “validation  for what  I’m  doing  or to  see  if there’s
something  that I’m  doing  wrong  or what have  you.” (Tr. 72) If  he  really needed  help,  he
would seek it. (Tr. 70)

"Consistent with his January 23, 2020 SCA, Applicant admitted all allegations. His
admissions in his Answer are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He is married to his third spouse and has two children
and three adult stepchildren. He has worked for his sponsor since 2007 as an inspector.
He earned an associate’s degree in 2007. He has never held a security clearance. (Item
3 at 7, 12, 16-18, 20-23, and 36.)
Guideline I  –  Psychological Conditions
SOR ¶  1.a:  On  July  29,  2022,  at  the  request of  the  DoD,  Applicant underwent  a
psychological  evaluation.  The   DoD  psychologist  concurred   with   the   diagnosis  of  his
treating  physicians that  he  had  major depressive  disorder, recurrent, mild, and  an  alcohol
use  disorder.  (Item 4 at 6.)
SOR  ¶   1.e:   Applicant’s  history   of   suicidality   goes   back   to   1993,   when   he
His most recent
intentionally overdosed  on  Tylenol with  codeine. (Item  4  at 7.)  SOR ¶  1.c:
suicide  attempt  occurred  in the  summer of 2018, after a domestic disturbance, when  he
intentionally overdosed  on  a  prescription  muscle relaxer,  Baclofen.  (Item  3  at 35  and  Item
5  at 26.)  As a  result of the  overdose, he  was  placed  in a  medically induced  coma. SOR ¶
1.b:  After  the   2018   suicide   attempt,   he   underwent  psychiatric  treatment  and   was
diagnosed  with  major depression, recurrent,  severe, without psychosis, and  alcohol use
disorder,   severe.   (Item   5   at   4-5.)  SOR  ¶   1.f:  During   treatment   after  his   2018   suicide
attempt,  he   reported   five   suicide   attempts  since   the   age   of  16.   (Item   5   at  5.)   He
acknowledged   to   the  DoD  psychologist  to  planning   and  attempting   suicide   three   times
since  age  16. (Item  4  at 4.) SOR ¶  1.d:  In a domestic disturbance in 2005 he placed a
revolver to his head before ultimately discharging the weapon into the ceiling. (Item 4 at
4.)
Applicant  first  sought  treatment  for  depression  in  the  early  2000s,  after  his  first
divorce.  He  was  prescribed  a  series  of  medications,  which  in  short  term  use  proved
ineffective at reducing his symptoms. (Item 4 at 2.) He discontinued treatment within a
few months and did not resume treatment until 2012. He stopped the 2012 treatment after
two weeks. (Item 4 at 2.)
After his 2018 suicide attempt, he was prescribed Zoloft. The medication has been
effective in moderating his depression, and he continues taking it. Zoloft is his primary
means for treating his mental health issues. (Item 4 at 2 and Item 5 at 5.) However, the
DoD psychologist noted continued alcohol consumption negates the effectiveness of the
medications for his depression. (Item 4 at 6.) Applicant reports his use of medication at
approximately “one time a week” and described its use to address stress management,
procrastination, and to change his attitude. (Item 4 at 2-3.)
Guideline G – Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶¶  2.a  and 2.c: Applicant, even after the events alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and
1.d, admits in his Answer, and contrary to medical advice, his continued alcohol use. (Item
4 at 4.) He notes in his Answer his doctor is aware of his continued alcohol use.  In his
2020 security clearance interview he told the investigator as of July 2018 he no longer
used  alcohol.  (Item  7 at  8.)  During  his  July 2022  psychological  evaluation,  he  told  the
DoD  psychologist  he  consumed  “alcohol  approximately  four  times  weekly,  drinking
between two and five alcoholic beverages each setting, and only drinking more than six
alcoholic drinks approximately monthly.” (Item 4 at 7.)
SOR ¶¶ 2.d-2.f allege alcohol-related arrests. Applicant admits to each incident:
the  2015  incident  resulted  in  him  being  charged  with  fourth-degree  assault;  the  2009
incident  resulted  in  an  arrest  for  fourth-degree  assault  and  second-degree  disorderly
conduct; and the 2004 DUI arrest. (Item 3 at 29-32, Item 6, and Item 7 at 4-5.)
SOR ¶ 2.b states Applicant has experienced adverse personal, professional, and
financial consequences because of alcohol consumption since at least 2003. In addition
to the three alcohol-related arrests discussed in SOR ¶¶  2.d-2.f, the record shows several
other  professional  and  personal  consequences.  He  attributes alcohol  consumption  to
missing  work  due  to  being  hungover;  his  two  suicide  attempts  in  2005  and  2018;  his
second divorce; and his financial problems, including a  2014 foreclosure. (Item 4 at 3;

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 60 years old. She was married from 1988 to 1993. She remarried in
2020. She has an adult daughter. She has been employed by a federal contractor since
August 2019.
In approximately May 2016, Applicant recognized she had issues with alcohol and
began  attending  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA).  Between  May  2016  and  late  2017,  she
relapsed about once a quarter by drinking one to two bottles of wine on each occasion.
She then abstained from alcohol consumption between late 2017 and March 2019. (Item
6)
In March 2019, while working at a military retail facility on a military base, Applicant
consumed three small bottles of wine that she had brought to work with her in her purse.
She told the investigator that she had been under a lot of  stress due to her  upcoming
wedding and because she was offended that one of her co-workers wore his pants low,
and she was able to see his buttocks. She had previously registered a complaint with her
manager about how her coworkers dressed but was told there was nothing that could be
done about it. Applicant became intoxicated while at work. A coworker approached and
told her she was being relieved from her shift. Applicant went home because she was
intoxicated. She told the investigator that the next day she contacted her manager and
told him she was resigning from her position because she was a recovering alcoholic and
she had relapsed. She said she would not be returning to work because she needed to
focus on herself and her recovery. Her manager agreed with her, and she never returned
to work. She denied she was fired. (Item 6)
Applicant completed a security clearance application in August 2019. She did not
disclose that she left her position in May 2019 after being relieved from her shift for being
intoxicated, and then resigned. (Item 4)
In October 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. During
her interview, she disclosed that in 2013,  she had gastric-bypass surgery. Around that
time, she began consuming alcohol. She said she replaced her food addiction with alcohol
addiction. Her father passed away in 2013. Due to grief, loneliness, and stress, she began
consuming one to two bottles of wine a day and became intoxicated each time. She would
occasionally have hallucinations while intoxicated. (Items 6 and 7)
Applicant was asked by the government investigator why she failed to disclose that
she left her employment in March 2019 due to her alcohol incident and relapse, and she
said  she  was  embarrassed.  She  admitted  that  alcohol  had  a  negative  impact  on  her
professional  life  because  she  had  to  leave  her  position.  Her  alcohol  consumption
impacted  her  relationship  with  her  daughter  and  her  daughter’s  fiancé.  Her  daughter
bought breathalyzers to monitor Applicant’s consumption. She told the investigator that
she will always be a recovering alcoholic, and she will continue to attend AA meetings.
(Item 6)
There is no evidence that Applicant has participated in alcohol counseling, but she
reported to the investigator that she attended AA in May 2016 until August 2019 twice a
day, and she reported that she attended about three times a week from August 2019 to
October 2019. During her interview with the government investigator, she stated she had
been  sober  since  August  2019.  In  May  2022,  Applicant  completed  government
interrogatories and confirmed the accuracy of her statement to the investigator. She did
not provide any updated information about whether she continues to attend AA; whether
she has sought alcohol counseling; whether she has continually abstained from alcohol
consumption; and whether she has had any relapses. (Item 6)
In  October  2020,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  government-approved,  licensed
psychologist,  Dr.  L.  Applicant  disclosed  to  the  psychologist  that  she  had  a  history  of
depression and had attempted suicide twice in the past three years. Her first attempt in
2017 involved an overdose of pills, and she was taken to the hospital by ambulance. The
second attempt was after she lost her job in 2019 for drinking alcohol. She reported that
she  attempted  to  slice  her  wrists,  which  required  a  home  visit  from  a  mental  health
agency. The psychologist noted that Applicant reported that she had been diagnosed with
depression  in  the  past  and  was  presently  prescribed  psychotropic  medications.  She
receives medicine management through her general physician, though at the time of her
psychological evaluation, she had been referred to a psychiatrist, whom she had not yet
seen.  Applicant  also  reported  that  she  had  been  in  recovery  from  alcohol  use  for
approximately  18-19  months.  She  described  her  support  in  managing  her  alcohol
addiction was through AA and her husband and daughter. (Item 7)
Dr. L diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder (moderate) and alcohol
abuse  disorder,  in  remission.  Her  psychological  evaluation  noted  that  Applicant  had
persistent mental health issues and potential neurocognitive challenges that warranted
concern about her overall functioning. Dr. L noted  that Applicant’s issue  with  her mood
appears to be influenced by complicated and unprocessed grief surrounding her father’s
passing. In addition, Dr. L opined that while Applicant’s alcohol addiction is in sustained
remission,  Applicant  continued  to  demonstrate  limited  coping  capacity  to  manage
psychosocial  stressors.  As  such,  her  risk  for  relapse  and  emotional  dysregulation  in
response to situational stressors in her environment remained a concern. (Item 7)
Dr.  L  also  noted  that  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  her  mental  health  issues  and
addiction issues on her SCA. Applicant reported to the government investigator that she
was  embarrassed  about  her  alcohol  issues.  Dr.  L  opined  that  her  embarrassment  is
consistent with Applicant’s immense shame surrounding her mental health and recovery.
She stated that her level of shame and associated vulnerability warrant concern around
potential implications as it pertains to holding a security clearance, as Applicant’s lack of
candor and forthcomingness indicate unprocessed issues that may make her susceptible
to manipulation. (Item 7)
Dr.  L  opined  that  Applicant’s  current  level  of  functioning  may  interfere  with  her
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She also noted that Applicant’s alcohol abuse
was  being  managed  presently  with  a  prolonged  period  of  sobriety  and  consistent
engagement in AA. (Item 7)
",True
"Applicant  admitted  some  of  the SOR  allegations,  with  explanations,  and  denied
other allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact.  After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. He is currently unemployed, but he is being sponsored
for a security clearance by a federal contractor. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 2013
to 2019, when he was discharged with a general discharge, under honorable conditions.
He holds an associate degree and is taking additional courses. He is divorced and has
no children. He held a clearance while in the Air Force until it was suspended in December
2018. (Tr. 6, 37-38; GE 1, 6)
Under Guideline I, the SOR alleged: (1) Applicant received psychiatric treatment
for  depression  and  anxiety  in  November  2018.  He  expressed  suicidal  ideations  while
hospitalized; (2) Applicant received treatment at a military medical clinic from December
7, 2018, to about April 22, 2019, after expressing suicidal ideations. He was diagnosed
with conditions identified as adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood
and  an  unspecified  personality  disorder.  He  was  given  a  poor  prognosis.  He  was
evaluated  by  a  licensed  psychologist  in  December  2021,  who  affirmed  the  earlier
diagnoses  of  mood  disorder  and  adjustment  disorder,  and  also  characterized  his
prognosis as poor. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c)
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged: (1) Applicant received nonjudicial punishment
under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  Article  15,  in  February  2019  for
wrongful  use  of  testosterone;  (2)  Applicant  received  nonjudicial  punishment  under  the
UCMJ, Article 15, in April 2019 for wrongful use of letrozole; (3) Applicant was charged
with  engaging  in  abusive  sexual  contact  under  UCMJ  Article  120;  and  (4)  Applicant
received a general discharge from the Air Force in May 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.d)
Under Guideline H, the SOR cross-alleged the two drug abuse allegations in SOR
¶¶ 2.a-2.b.
Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.d. The
SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false information on his August 2019
security clearance application (SCA) when he failed to disclose: (1) his hospitalization in
November 2018; (2) his illegal drug use in SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.b above; (3) his illegal drug use,
while  possessing  a  security  clearance;  and  (4)  that  he  had  his  security  clearance
suspended in December 2018. (SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.e)
Phycological Conditions  (Guideline I).
Applicant  was interviewed  by a background  investigator in August 2019.  During
that interview, he admitted that he sought treatment for anxiety and depression and was
hospitalized at a military facility in November 2018. He sought this treatment after he had
moved out from living with his girlfriend in October 2018. He remained hospitalized for
approximately  36  hours.  Applicant  admitted  this  hospitalization  during  his  hearing
testimony. There are no medical records that document this hospitalization. There is also
no evidence supporting Applicant’s suicidal ideations at this point in time. (Tr. 54-56 ; GE
2 (p. 6), GE 4 (no reference to November 2018 hospitalization))
Applicant  voluntarily sought outpatient  counseling at an Air Force mental health
clinic from approximately December 2018 to  May 2019. The treatment stopped when he
was  discharged  from  the  Air  Force  in  May  2019.  His  medical  care  during  this  time  is
documented by the 120 pages of records contained in GE 4. Applicant’s primary mental
health provider during his sessions was Dr. C, a licensed clinical psychologist. Applicant
had one session with Dr. K, a psychiatrist. (GE 4 (pp. 14, 45-50, 112))
Dr.  C’s  initial  diagnoses  for  Applicant  in  December  2018  were:  (1)  adjustment
disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (DSM-5 F43.23), and (2) unspecified
disorder of adult personality and behavior (DSM-5 F69). During the course of the next
several months, Dr. C continued to see Applicant in the clinical setting and documented
the following observations:
Applicant’s  first  session   on   December  7,   2018:  He  was   hostile   and
uncooperative  with  treatment.  He made  little eye  contact, which  challenges
his  credibility.   A   personality  disorder   is  suspect  of  interfering   with   his
accessibility to  treatment. He is scheduled for psychological testing.
Applicant’s  session   on   December  14,  2018:  He  was  uncooperative   with
treatment and  would rather talk about himself,  he  related  he  felt victimized
by a  woman  who raised a sexual assault allegation against him (see below
under  criminal conduct  discussion). He seems unwilling  to  engage  in  any
authentic therapeutic interventions;
Applicant’s session on  December 17, 2018: He may be  opening up but it is
hard for him to let go of blaming  his girlfriend;
Applicant’s  session   on   December  27,  2018:  He   is  forming   tenuous
therapeutic  alliance  after each  session  after he  initially enters  with  a  hostile,
irritable  attitude.  Once   he   opens  up   he   impresses  as  more  credible   and
empathy  for him  comes easier. He  is  beginning  to  talk   more authentically
about  his  conflicts   and   feelings   of  aloneness.  He   has   not   had   suicidal
ideations for at least a  month.
Applicant’s  session   on   January  4,  2019:   He  did   not   enter   session   with
hostility.  He talked  a  lot  about himself. He opened  up  about growing  up  with
guns and  they are a  part of his culture. He  expressed  that  no  one  ever being
there   for   him  and   this statement  might   offer an  opening   into   his personal
life.
Applicant’s  session   on   January  11,  2019:   He   presents  for  the   supportive
aspects  of  treatment  and   tends  to   become   argumentative   when   he   is
challenged.  He seems to  be  disinterested  in  real change  that can  come  from
psychotherapy.  However,  his  symptoms   have   reduced   dramatically  since
he   has  presented   himself  as  a   victim   regarding   the   sexual  contact
allegations.  He is  unauthentic and  he  is not  aware  that he  is presenting  that
way;
Applicant’s  session   on   January   14,  2019:   He  wants   to   come   off   his
medications  because  he  feels he  is underweight.  He  is  more focused  on  his
appearance  than  on  his current emotions.  He  is opening  up  to  some  degree
in therapy and  is gaining  some  minimal insight into  how his own behavior
has affected  his current  situation.   He  is   very   focused   on  the   women   who
have  wronged  him.  He wishes to  continue  treatment,  despite  his resistance
to it;
Applicant’s  session   on   February  22,   2019:   He  panicked   over  his  sexual
assault  charges,  so   his  reading   of   one   [Dr.  C’s]  notes   in  which   he   was
deemed  not credible  has weighted  meaning  at this time. He stated  that if he
lost  his sexual assault case  he  would kill himself. He also called  his mother
and told her the same  thing. He is contradictory in his reports of confirming
at the  same  time  denying  his suicidality.  (Note, on  this same  day, Dr. C was
informed   by   Applicant’s  First  Sergeant  that   Applicant   had   a   plan   to   kill
himself  with  a  gun  if  he  was  not discharged  from  the  Air  Force in  15  days.
Applicant had written a suicide  note.);
Applicant’s session  on  March 15,  2019: He  is  completely disengaged  from
treatment, is argumentative, and cannot be  pleased.
Applicant’s session  on   April 22, 2019: He attended  therapy  today despite
his complaint  that his treatment  is lacking.  He  seemed  lost  and  spoke  as if
treatment was his last  resort. He presented well-groomed and confident as
usual but he  seems confounded  about why he  is alone  and  what needs to
be  done  to  remedy his feelings of loneliness. He is distressed  about  leaving
the  Air  Force  which  is indicative of considerable ambivalence  on  his part as
he  also  complains  about   the   Air   Force  bitterly.  He  has  been   off   his
medications  for two  months. This was  the  last session  Applicant  attended
before his discharge from  the  Air Force. (GE  4 (pp. 33-37))
Dr. C’s final diagnosis was that Applicant presented with adjustment disorder with
depressed mood and anxiety. She summarized his overall progress during his sessions
as follows: “Patient  did  not improve  in  treatment and  was only checking  in  because  he
refused treatment but he was on the HIL (high interest list) and was required to check in.”
He did not have suicidal ideations at the beginning or the end of his sessions. She also
stated his prognosis is poor and that Applicant was unreliable and dishonest during the
course of treatment. (GE 4 (pp. 12-14)
In  Applicant’s  SOR  answer,  he  denied  that he  expressed  any  suicidal ideations
while  treated  at  the  Air  Force  mental  health  clinic  between  December  2018  and  April
2019. He also explained that he believed the prescription medication he was taking was
causing  “negative  feedback.”  In  his  hearing  testimony,  Applicant  admitted  he  had  a
difficult  relationship  with  Dr.  C.  He  believes  she  took  things  out  of  context.  He  also
disagreed with the medications she prescribed for him. He denied  telling Dr. C that he
would kill himself if he lost his sexual assault case. He denied telling Dr. C that he called
his mother and told her the same thing. He denied writing a suicide note that his First
Sergeant  disclosed.  I  do  not  find  Applicant’s  denials  credible  when viewed against  the
conflicting record evidence. (Tr. 77-78, 89-91; SOR answer)
In December 2021, Applicant consented to a psychological evaluation arranged by
the DOD. Dr. M, a board certified, licensed clinical psychologist, approved by the DOD,
was retained to conduct the evaluation on December 4 and December 21, 2021. Dr. M
conducted clinical interviews of Applicant, reviewed the medical records contained in GE
4,  reviewed  Applicant’s  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  medical  records,  and
conducted  psychological  testing,  including  The  Million  Clinical  Multiaxial  Inventory  4th
edition  (MCMI-IV)  and  the  Minnesota  Multiphasic  Personality  Inventory  3rd  edition
(MMPI-3). (GE 3)
Applicant’s MCMI-IV test produced a profile of a response style in need of social
approval  with  a  tendency  to  present  himself  in  a  favorable  light.  The  testing  results
showed  significant elevations  on  scales  related  to  histrionic,  turbulent,  and  narcissistic
personality patterns. The test showed that he also expressed general anxiety. The test
indicated  evidence  of  a  moderate  degree  of  emotional  lability  in  his  personality,  and
although  he  is  typically  able  to  function  adequately,  periods  of  marked  emotional,
cognitive, and behavior dysfunction are likely. (GE 3)
Applicant’s MMPI-3 test showed that the test’s validity scale raised concerns about
possible underreporting by him. However, the test was deemed valid. He presented as
well-adjusted, despite evidence to the contrary. The test revealed he likely engages in
compulsive behavior and displays a rigid, perfectionistic demeanor. The test showed no
evidence of disordered thinking or maladaptive behavior, but because of the possibility of
his underreporting, such behavior could not  be ruled out. (GE 3)
Based upon her overall evaluation, Dr. M concluded, “[Applicant] has a consistent
history of Mood Disorder and Adjustment Disorder, and although he does not currently
endorse any mental health symptoms, it is likely that he is minimizing due to the nature
of this evaluation.” Dr. M gave  the following prognosis: “[Applicant’s] prognosis is poor.
He lacks insight into his mental health condition, and he is unable to admit even minor
flaws.” Additionally, she stated that the inconsistencies between Applicant’s self-report of
his  mental  health  history  and  his  current  condition  contrasted  to  the  documented
treatment history call into question his judgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness.
(GE 3)
In  his SOR answer, Applicant indicated  that at the  time  of Dr. M’s evaluation  he
had  been  off  his  anti-depressant  medications  for  about  six  months.  Without  stating  it
directly, he implied that this had some impact on him at the time of the evaluation. He
denied suffering from bi-polar mood disorder, however, Dr. M did not specifically diagnose
him  with  that  disorder.  She  stated  that  without  further  testing  (a  neuropsychological
evaluation), the diagnostic picture was complicated. He has seen a therapist through the
VA two times in the past year. He provided some medical records from the VA, but none
contained any diagnoses or prognosis. He does not have any future sessions scheduled.
(Tr. 115-116; GE 3; AE D; SOR answer)
Criminal  Conduct  (Guideline   J)   and  Drug  Involvement   and   Substance   Abuse
(Guideline H)
In  October  2018,  while  Applicant  was  in  the  Air  Force,  he  tested  positive  for
testosterone,  a  schedule  III  controlled  substance,  during  a  urinalysis  test.  Further
investigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) discovered three
witnesses who either saw Applicant inject himself with testosterone or other steroids, or
to whom Applicant admitted that he used such substances. A residential search revealed
that Applicant possessed a box of unused 31-gauge syringes and a vial of bacteriostatic
water. Based upon the foregoing, in January 2019, Applicant was administered Article 15
UCMJ proceedings by his commander for a violation of UCMJ Article 112a, wrongful use
of a controlled substance. After consulting with a lawyer, Applicant accepted the Article
15  proceedings,  rather  than  requesting  trial  by  court-martial.  After  making  a  written
presentation to his commander, his commander found him guilty of the offense and issued
punishment of a one grade reduction-in-rank and a reprimand. (GE 2, 7-8)
In January 2019, Applicant tested positive during another urinalysis for letrozole,
another controlled substance. Applicant was again offered Article 15 punishment, which
he accepted. His commander found him guilty of the offense and issued punishment of a
one grade reduction-in-rank and a reprimand. (GE 2, 7, 9)
In explaining these two drug incidents, Applicant claimed he took over-the-counter
boosters and was unaware that they may have contained prohibited substances. He also
claimed  that he  never received  the  actual urinalysis test  results, so  he  was  unsure how
the   substances  could   have   been   in  his  body.  In   his  hearing   testimony,  he   denied
knowingly using  illegal steroids and  injecting  himself with  any type  of steroid. He admitted
testing  positive  on  the  two  urinalyses.  I  did  not find  Applicant’s  testimony  credible  given
the  corroboration  evidence  for  the  positive  tests results  (three  witnesses and  the  search
results). (Tr. 69-70, 72; GE 2; SOR answer)
In  February 2019, Applicant’s former girlfriend  reported  to  the  AFOSI that when
she  and  Applicant  were  living  together  in  October  2018,  he  touched  her  in  a  sexual
manner on three occasions. She claimed she told him to stop on each occasion. Applicant
was  later  questioned  by  the  AFOSI  and  he  denied  any  nonconsensual  touching.  The
investigation  was  forwarded  to  Applicant’s  command  for  potential  criminal  action.  The
command decided that there was  insufficient evidence to act upon. During his hearing
testimony, he denied this allegation. Additionally, he claimed he was a victim of sexual
assault by his former girlfriend. (Tr. 45-48; GE 10)
Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  Air  Force  in  May  2019,  at  the  end  of  his
enlistment.  His  discharge  was  characterized  as  a  general  discharge,  under  honorable
conditions. (GE 1-2)
Personal Conduct (Guideline  E)
Applicant filled out an SCA in August 2019. In Section 21 of the SCA, he was asked
if  he  had  ever  been  hospitalized  for  a  mental  health  condition.  He  answered  “no.”
Applicant admitted he was voluntarily hospitalized in November 2018, for a 36-hour period
in a behavioral health facility. He claimed in his SOR answer that it was not related to
mental  health  issues.  Earlier  during  his  background  investigation,  he  admitted  the
treatment was for anxiety and depression issues. He told the investigator he was not sure
he should list it. (Tr. 55-56, GE 1-2; SOR answer)
In Section 23 of the SCA, Applicant was asked if, within the last seven years, he
had  used  any  illegal  drugs  or  controlled  substances.  He  was  also  asked  if,  within  the
same  time  period,  he  used  illegal  drugs  or  controlled  substances  while  possessing  a
security clearance. He answered “no” to both questions. That answer was false because
Applicant was used illegal steroids between July and October 2018 and December 2018
and January 2019. He held a security clearance at the time of these uses. In Section 15
of  the  SCA,  Applicant  listed  information  about  his  military  history.  In  the  subsection
inquiring about discipline, Applicant disclosed his discipline under Article 15 for positive
drug tests. This is similar information that should have been disclosed in Section 23, as
described above. (GE1)
In  Section  25  of the  SCA,  Applicant was asked  if he  ever had  a  security clearance
eligibility/access  authorization  denied,  suspended, or revoked?  He  answered  “no.” This
answer was false because  on December 3, 2018, his military commander issued a letter
suspending  Applicant’s access to  classified information. Applicant acknowledged  receipt
of   this   letter  and   signed   for  it  on   December   4,  2018.  In   his  SOR  response,  Applicant
admitted  improperly  answering  this  question.  He  did  not  provide  a  reason  why  he
answered improperly. (GE 1; SOR answer)
Applicant provided a letter of support from his current girlfriend. She stated that
when they started dating in May 2020, he disclosed a mood disorder to her resulting from
the death of his fiancée in January 2020. He was taking medication  at that time. After
about a year, he decided to come off his medications. After doing his own research, he
stopped taking the prescribed medications. She further stated that since coming off the
medications, he is a new man. She feels coming off his medication was the best choice
for him. (AE A-B)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  with  explanations.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 32  years old.  He earned two bachelor’s degrees and  earned credits
towards a master’s degree. He was married to his first wife from December 2016 until she
passed  away  in  2019.  He  remarried  in  March  2023.  He  has  worked  for  his  current
employer, a federal contractor, since 2015. (Tr. 20; GE 1)
During Applicant’s first marriage, his wife suffered from mental illness. She had a
child from a previous relationship, and Applicant treated his stepdaughter like his own.
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  aware  his  wife  had  experienced  significant  and  intense
trauma in her past. She was abused by a previous boyfriend and had childhood trauma.
She was participating in talk therapy, cognitive therapy, and was on medication. He and
his first wife were together for about two and a half years before they married. He raised
his stepdaughter almost by himself from the age of three until she was seven years. His
wife was a flight attendant and would be gone for extended periods of time, and Applicant
would care for the child. He and his stepdaughter had a close relationship. In early 2017,
he  and  his  wife  attended  marriage  counseling  to  address  communication  issues.  The
counselor recommended he seek individual counseling. (Tr. 21-27, 79)
Applicant sought mental health treatment from a health center (HC) in April 2017.
He reported to the mental health professional (MHP) that he was having difficulty focusing
and  concentrating.  He  was  diagnosed  with  attention  deficient/hyperactivity  disorder
(ADHD). He was prescribed medication. He stated that he also participated in treatment
brought on by his relationship with his wife who was undergoing treatment for depression
and  extreme  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD).  He  said  she  had  an  ongoing
diagnosis  of  alcoholism  and  borderline  personality  disorder.  He  explained  that  as  her
partner and a person who loved her, these conditions led to stress and trauma in dealing
with  her  behavior.  While  attending  therapy,  he  was  also  evaluated  for  various  mental
health issues to ensure a bipolar condition was ruled out, which it was. Applicant testified
that he now manages his ADHD through diet, sleep, and exercise  and is no longer on
medication. (Tr. 22, 25-27, 42, 51-54; Answer to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant testified that his wife was  prescribed  medication for her mental health
issues and was experiencing side effects, such as hallucinations and delusions. She was
also abusing alcohol. She had participated in alcohol detoxification a couple of times. Her
medications  were  changed,  but her symptoms  and  side  effects  worsened.  He  testified
that he was arrested in August 2017 on charges of domestic violence. He testified that
his  wife  was  not  taking  her  prescribed  medication,  and  he  thought  she  was  having
flashbacks. He said that his wife attacked him, and he defended himself by wrapping his
arms around her. He had injuries to his face. He was arrested for domestic violence but
the charges were later dropped. (Tr. 29-30, 45-47, 55-59)
Applicant testified that in August 2017, his wife left him, and she left her daughter
in his care. He was the sole provider for his stepdaughter until November 2017 when the
police arrived at his home on Thanksgiving Day and escorted his stepdaughter from the
premises. He understood that he had no legal rights to her, and he only ever saw her a
few more times. Applicant was distraught and grieving at the loss of his stepdaughter. In
November  2017,  he  reported  to  his  MHP  that  he  was  experiencing  anxiety  due  to  his
separation  from  his  wife  and  loss  of  contact  with  his  stepdaughter.  He  continued  his
regular appointments. (Tr. 22-25, 30, 62; Answer to the SOR)
In  late  December 2017, he  learned  that his wife  had  aborted  their  child. They had
tried  to  conceive  for two  years but struggled  due  to  his wife’s physical health  issues  and
were  unsuccessful. The  combination  of losing  access to  his  stepdaughter and  learning  of
the  abortion  made  him  more depressed  and  mired  in grief.  In  January 2018, he  sought
treatment and  was admitted  to  a  mental health  facility for suicidal  ideations. He  continued
his therapy  to  approximately April 2018  for  grief because  of the  loss of  his  stepdaughter
and  familial stress.  (Tr. 28-30, 66; Answer to the SOR)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  January  2018  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions  (SF 86)  that  in  January 2018  he purchased  and used marijuana  three  times
during one weekend while living in a state where it is legal. He had a security clearance
at the time but did not have access to classified information. He testified that because of
all of the family issues he was experiencing, with the loss of custody of his stepdaughter,
and the separation from his wife, he thought he would try marijuana to relieve the stress.
He believed because it was legal under state law, he was permitted to use it. He credibly
testified that he was unaware that he was not permitted to use marijuana under federal
law, but also acknowledged he should have known better. He has not used marijuana
since that weekend and does not intend to use it in the future. He provided a signed letter
of  intent  to never use or possess  illegal drugs  or misuse  legal drugs  in  the future  and
agreed that his security clearance could be revoked if he violated his promise. (Tr. 43-45,
64-66, 113-118; Answer to the SOR; AE B)
Applicant provided the results of drug tests administered on June 3, 2022, March
25,  2023,  and  April  5,  2023,  which  showed  he  tested  negative  for  illegal  drugs.  He
provided a letter from his mother who said she had visited her son in June 2018, and he
disclosed to her that he had used marijuana to help cope with the separation from his wife
and stepdaughter. She had concerns about the policy of his employer because marijuana
was legal in the state where he lived. She said her son told her that he believed it was
permissible to use. (Tr. 47; AE D, H, I, P)
In  July  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  domestic  violence  against  his  wife.
Applicant denied he committed any act of violence. He believed it was a plot devised by
his  wife  so  he  would  be  in  jail  and  she  could  obtain  items  from  the  marital  home.  He
indicated the incident was entirely fabricated and he had an alibi to her accusations in
that he was not where she claimed he was located. He believed the allegation was made
to obtain legal leverage for their pending divorce or were attributed to his wife’s mental
health  issues  because  he  believed  she  was  not  taking  her  medications  and  was
consuming  alcohol.  He  attributed  her  obtaining  restraining  orders  against  him  in
September 2018 and May 2019 to the same purposes as noted above. The charges and
orders were all dismissed when Applicant’s wife failed to appear in court. (Tr. 29-30, 41,
45-47, 77; Answer to the SOR)
During  marriage  counseling,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  depressed  and
mentioned  he  had  suicidal  ideations.  In  December  2018,  Applicant  was  at  home  and
asleep. His wife tried to contact him by telephone and when he did not answer, she called
the police. He explained to the police that he was seeking treatment for grief and was
dealing with depression, but it was being handled through his private MHP. For reasons
unbeknownst to him they admitted him under the Baker Act to a mental health facility.
Applicant believes this was an attempt by his wife to ruin his reputation and gain leverage
in  their  divorce  proceeding.  Applicant  admitted  he  had  suicidal  ideations  but  did  not
attempt suicide. (Tr. 31,37-41, 66, 82-87)
Applicant’s discharge summary from his December 2018 hospitalization notes that
he was communicating with his ex-wife and was venting and instead of her calming him,
she began screaming at him. He attempted to tell her that because of the way she treated
him and interacted with him, he had become suicidal in the past. That was the end of the
conversation,  until  the  police  arrived  at  his  door.  He  denied  he  had  attempted  to
deliberately harm himself. He had positives in this life and was gainfully employed. He
was receiving support from his mother and brother and had strong religious beliefs. He
was looking forward to a trip to India. He was discharged in January 2019 with a diagnosis
by a medical doctor of depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified, major depressive
disorder, single episode, unspecified, and unspecified depressive disorder. He testified
that he was told to continue seeing his therapist. (Tr. 30, 40-41; GE 3)
Applicant was moving from one state to another and during the period of late 2018
to 2019, and he was traveling back and forth between the states. Also at some point, his
wife  had  move  to  the  new  state.  He  testified  that  he  followed  up  with  a  health  care
professional in the new state. Applicant provided a letter from Dr. MS, a licensed married
and   family therapist  (LMF)   and   licensed  mental health   counselor, who  practiced   in   the
new state. She  provided  a  letter from  October 2020  that stated  she  had  treated  Applicant
since   November 2018   and   diagnosed  him   with   adjustment   disorder with   anxiety   as he
was  transitioning   through   divorce.   She   last   saw  him   in   December  2019   when   they
mutually decided  to  terminate  services.  He testified  that they agreed  he  had  continued
therapy  to  the  point  where it  was no  longer necessary, and  at that  point he  had  a  game
plan  to  address any issues that may occur or bouts of grief he  may  experience. (Tr. 34-
35, 66-75, 80-82, 87; AE C)
Applicant  testified  that  his  wife  attempted  suicide  five  times  while  they  were
married. In September 2019, she succeeded. She left a suicide note, hung herself, and
was  found  weeks  later  at  her  house.  It  was  determined  that  her  cause  of  death  was
suicide. (Tr. 45)
On  January  17,  2022,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  government-approved
psychologist, Dr. B. Based on her clinical interview, available medical and mental health
treatment  records,  testing  observations,  and  results  of  the  Personality  Assessment
Inventory (PAI), she determined Applicant met the criteria for major depressive disorder,
recurrent, severe in remission, bipolar disorder R/O1 and Cluster B personality traits.2 She
noted Applicant had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and domestic violence issues.
He  also  had  episodes  of  increased  energy  and  activity  as  well  as  episodes  of  major
depression.  He  was  not  in  treatment  for  these  conditions  because  she  noted  that
Applicant felt he did not need mental health treatment. His prognosis was poor because
he  was  not  interested  in  treatment,  which  Dr.  B  noted  would  need  to  be  regular  and
ongoing  to  prevent  relapses  of  depression  and  possibly  mania.  She  said  due  to
inconsistencies  she  noted  in  information  he  provided  to  her  and  to  the  government
investigator regarding his security clearance application it suggested he was dishonest.
She  noted  his  use  of  marijuana  while  he  had  a  security  clearance,  which  he
acknowledged, also gave her concerns, although she did not discuss this as impacting
judgment,
his  psychological
trustworthiness, and reliability. (GE 4)
issues.  She  had  significant  concerns  about  his
Applicant testified that he disagreed with many things Dr. B stated in her report
noting they were inaccurate. He noted that his virtual evaluation was between one and
two hours. Her conclusions that he perpetrated acts of domestic violence were not true.
He noted she opined that he had unpredictable and violent behavior, which was untrue
and  based  on  false  reports  from  his  ex-wife.  He  said  Dr.  B  saw  this  as  inconsistent
reporting and dishonest. He adamantly disagreed with her interpretation and willingness
to accept these accusations without considering his information. Dr B. concluded that he
had  episodes  of  increased  energy  and  activity,  such  as  formulating  a  plan  to  travel  to

consideration. For example, a normal chest x-ray may “rule out” pneumonia.

erratic  cluster,  include  Borderline  Personality  Disorder,  Narcissistic  Personality  Disorder,  Histrionic
Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder.
India, which were a concern. Applicant had planned a trip to India for a wedding that was
subsequently canceled because the wedding was canceled. He took a trip to Aruba after
he  had  completed  his  two  bachelor’s  degrees  because  he  was  exhausted  and  not
because he was using sleep as a coping mechanism for a manic episode. He denied he
exhibited  unpredictable  and  erratic  behavior.  He  denied  he  lied  and  had  recurring
problems with the law, was aggressive, violent, and impulsive. He also disagreed with her
evaluation that he was dishonest. Dr. B noted that he was in a tumultuous relationship
with his wife and had suicidal ideations during this time, which prompted a diagnosis of
major depressive disorder, and she had concerns that he was not currently in treatment.
When  he  was  evaluated  by  Dr.  B,  he  was  no  longer  married  as  his  wife  had  been
deceased since 2019. She noted that he reported on his security clearance application
(January 2020) that he was going through some hard times but was in therapy and doing
better. She said if he did have some insight for treatment, he did not have it at the time of
the evaluation and therefore his prognosis was poor. (Tr. 32-33, 102-112; GE 4)
Applicant was re-evaluated in June  2022 by a licensed psychologist (LC). The LC
noted   that  she   had   experience   treating   various  disorders,  particularly  depressive
disorders. They discussed  his past suicidal  ideations, Baker Act hospitalization, the  loss
of  his  stepdaughter  and   ex-wife.  They  also   discussed   his  history  of  grief  and   his  past
counseling  with  Dr.  MS. LC  noted  that Applicant  reported  that  he  was previously given
the  Personality Assessment Inventory and  the  screening  yielded  Bipolar  Disorder. (This
is  incorrect  according   to   Dr.  B   Bipolar  Disorder  had   to   be   ruled   out.)  LC   administered
assessments   for  anxiety  and   depression.  His   scores  were   nonsignificant  in   the   “none-
minimal”   range.  She   also  reviewed   the   DSM-5   criteria   for  Bipolar  I,   II,  and   Major
Depressive  Disorder.  Of   the   three   disorders,  Applicant  only  “endorsed   1   symptom   of
Major  Depressive  Disorder  (diminished   ability  to   concentrate/think)  and   the   diagnosis
requires  5   or  more  symptoms  to   be   endorsed.”  (AE   A)  In   LC’s  professional  opinion,
Applicant does not currently meet the  criteria  for Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar I
or Bipolar II Disorders. (Tr. 34, 89-102; AE A)
Applicant testified that he loved his first wife, despite their tumultuous relationship,
which he attributed to her PTSD and trauma she experienced, along with her abuse of
alcohol.  The  loss  of  custody  of  his  stepdaughter  had  a  devastating  impact  on  him
emotionally  and  mentally.  When  he  learned  his  wife  committed  suicide,  she  had  been
deceased  for  several  weeks  before  her  body  was  found.  Although  their  marriage  had
failed, she had been his best friend and he loved her. He could not understand why she
would not take her medication. (Tr. 29)
Applicant remarried in 2023. He provided a letter from his new wife who is aware
of the allegations in the SOR. She has known Applicant for four years. She has noticed
positive  changes  in  how  he  copes  with  his  grief  and  loss.  She  noticed  a  substantial
change in the first year of knowing him and continued consistency in the three subsequent
years. She supports him in his goals. She described him as patient and understanding.
(AE J, O)
Applicant testified that he has a good support system with his wife and family. He
is looking forward to his future and starting a family. He has developed coping skills and
participating in therapy has helped him. The loss of his wife and stepdaughter will always
be with him, but its impact has diminished, and he has learned the proper way to deal
with his loss. (Tr. 112)
Applicant provided performance evaluations from 2016 to 2021. He consistently
took on additional responsibilities and successfully added value to various projects. His
evaluations ranked him as “exceeded” and “significantly exceeded” goals. (AE F)
Applicant provided character letters describing him as a mentor, a leader, reliable,
focused, respected, and dependable. He has a strong work ethic and is a vital member
of the team. (Tr. 47-49; AE G, J)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old calibration technician employed by defense contractors
since October 2010. He was employed as an electrician by another defense contractor
from September 2009 until he was hired by his current employer.
Applicant served in the Army National Guard from June 1988 to January 1990 and
received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from
February 1990 to September 2009 and received an honorable discharge.
Applicant  married  in  December  1992  and  has  four  adult  children.  Three  are
biological  children  and  one  is  adopted.  (Tr.  20)  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
criminal justice in June 2013. He held a security clearance in the Navy, and he retained
it as an employee of a defense contractor.
In  2008,  while Applicant  was  on active duty in  the  Navy, he  was  involved  in an
argument  and  threatened  to  choke  a  coworker who  blamed  him  for shoddy  work on  a
project that was found to be deficient. (Tr. 23) In 2009, he had an altercation with another
coworker, choked him, and hit him repeatedly. (Tr. 24) He was sent to a Navy hospital for
assessment,  assigned  an  anger-management  counselor,  and  required  to  attend  six
anger-management sessions over a period of two months. (GX 3 at 2; Tr. 22)
Applicant was assessed in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facility
during his out-processing from the Navy. He was questioned about the incident in 2008,
and was diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder and suicidal tendencies. (Tr. 25; GX 4) He
was prescribed medication for depression, but discontinued it because it caused lethargy,
agitation, anxiety, and irritability, and made him difficult to focus on his tasks at work. He
informed  the  VA  providers  of  these  symptoms,  and  they  advised  him  to  monitor  his
depressive symptoms and restart the medications if needed. (GX 3 at 2.)
At the hearing, Applicant described the period from 2011 to 2013 as “probably the
darkest times of [his] life.” His father’s health  began to decline in 2012, and he passed
away in 2013. After Applicant’s father passed  away in 2013, he experienced  increased
depression, and he started having auditory hallucinations of his father’s voice, questioning
his  worth  and  telling  him  to  kill  himself.  His  VA  health  providers  diagnosed  him  with
paranoid  personality  disorder  and  recommended  inpatient  admission,  but  he  declined.
Eventually, His VA health providers prescribed a medication that reduced his depressive
mood and auditory hallucinations. (GX 3 at 2; Tr. 29-30) When Applicant’s assigned VA
physician was assigned to a different location, Applicant stopped taking his medication
for a while, hoping to  see his assigned physician again or receive the same treatment
from another VA physician. (Tr. 32)
In February 2014, Applicant was at a gas station when another driver accused him
of cutting him off at the  gas pump. Applicant, who was still in his vehicle, rolled up his
window, trying to avoid conflict. The other driver was infuriated and began hitting the hood
of Applicant’s car. At this point, Applicant exited his car and had an altercation with the
other driver, which was quickly broken up.
After the altercation, Applicant was upset and heard voices telling him to look out
for himself. He went into a Navy Exchange store, attempted to shoplift some expensive
headphones and two candy bars, and was arrested. While awaiting trial, he self-admitted
himself  into  a  VA  mental  health  facility  and  was  diagnosed  with  mood  adjustment
disorder, moderate to severe depression, and borderline bipolar disorder. In June 2014,
he was convicted of stealing government property, a misdemeanor, fined $250, placed
on probation for six months, and required to continue mental health treatment as directed
by his probation officer. (GX 5; GX 6; GX 7) The VA diagnosis is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
The court-ordered mental-health treatment is alleged twice in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c.
In March 2014, Applicant and his wife had an argument as he attempted to explain
to her that his medications made him feel less social when he was in public. After his wife
told him  to  “just  man  up,” he  went for a  drive  in his truck and was beset with negative
thoughts and hallucinations that told him to drive off the road. He drove into a ditch and
suffered minor injuries. Highway Patrol officers saw the vehicle in the ditch and issued
him a warning, but he was not charged. This incident is not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant notified his VA providers of the March 2014 incident, and they prescribed
a  medication  that  helped  alleviate  his  auditory  hallucinations.  (GX  3  at  3)  During  an
evaluation in June 2014, he told his providers that his angry outbursts began in his early
20s and were occurring two or three times a week and that he had homicidal thoughts
about people who had wronged him. (Tr. 33-36)
In April 2016, Applicant stole baseball and football cards from a military exchange
that then took them to the customer service office for a refund. At the hearing, he testified
that  he  did  not  know  why  his  took  the  cards.  He  denied  that  it  was  prompted  by
hallucinations.  He  was  not  on  medications  at  the  time.  (Tr.  41)  He  was  charged  with
stealing government property of a value less than $1,000. On motion of the government
attorney, the charges were dismissed. (GX 6) This incident is not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant stopped taking medications or receiving treatment for almost three years.
He went to a VA medical center in early 2019 and was diagnosed with adjustment disorder
with mixed features of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. He attended monthly therapy
sessions for about nine months, when the funding for the program was cut. (Tr. 43) He
began seeing a VA provider every three to six months until February 2021, when he was
unable to obtain appointments for further face-to-face treatment. He was offered virtual
appointments but declined them. (Tr. 44). He continued to have short telephonic sessions
in which the VA provider confirmed that he had the correct prescription and renewed it.
His  treatment  in VA medical  facilities  from  April 2011  to  September 2019  is alleged  in
SOR ¶ 1.d.
At  the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed
psychologist in February 2022. The psychologist concluded that Applicant’s temperament
is  more  stable  when  he  takes  his  medications,  which  reduce  his  depressive  mood
symptoms and tendency toward aggressive reactions. He noted that Applicant was mostly
compliant  with  his  medications  but  that  he  occasionally  forgot  to  take  them  or
procrastinated when a refill was needed. Applicant told the psychologist that he stopped
taking his medications for long periods of time during 2015 and 2016. The psychologist
found that Applicant has mild depressive episodes that may last for several hours up to
three or four days, but they are manageable and do not cause functional impairment. He
also found that Applicant’s auditory hallucinations were remitted when he was placed on
medication.
The psychologist considered whether Applicant suffers from a bipolar disorder, and
he concluded that Applicant does not have the manic episodes that are an element of a
bipolar  disorder.  He  noted  that  Applicant  shows  insight  and  awareness  of  his
psychological  problems  and  has  been  able  to  clearly  identify  how  they  have  caused
impairments in his personal and occupational environments. He diagnosed Applicant with
intermittent  explosive  disorder  and  persistent  depressive  disorder,  mild  to  moderate.
According to DSM-5, aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder have a rapid
onset and typically last less than 30 minutes. The outbursts commonly occur in response
to a minor provocation by a close intimate or associate.
The   psychologist   contacted   two   of   Applicant’s  supervisors.   One   has   known
Applicant  for  8-9   years  and   the   other  has  known   him   for  more   than   10   years.   Both
supervisors  spoke   highly  of  Applicant’s  competence   and   dependability.  Neither  was
aware  of any interpersonal issues between  Applicant and  his coworkers. Both  believed
that  Applicant’s  judgment,  reliability, and  trustworthiness  were  intact and  recommended
that Applicant be  allowed to retain his security clearance. (GX 3 at 6)
The  psychologist  concluded
reliability,  and
trustworthiness  were  currently  intact,  but  that  “his  emotional  stability  was  highly
vulnerable to external pressures or circumstances.” He also concluded that  Applicant’s
that  Applicant’s
judgment,
stability  was  “not  likely to  be  highly resilient or  capable of  enduring  through  significant
stressors and may result in him either experiencing deepening depression or aggressive
behaviors in the future.” (GX 3 at 7) The evaluation by the psychologist is alleged in SOR
¶ 1.e.
In March 2023, Applicant visited a VA facility and announced that he wanted to
restore his self-confidence, decrease angry thoughts, and have better motivation to stop
his aggressive behavior that had been escalating over the past year. (GX 9 at 16) His “VA
Problem  List”  reflected  treatment  for  “adjustment  disorder  with  depressed  mood.”  His
treatment  notes  for  April  2023  stated,  “The  patient  reported  some  symptoms  of
depression; symptoms are not consistent with a major depressive episode.” (GX 9 at 9)
Applicant  testified  that  the  last  time  he  thought  about  harming  himself  was  in
December 2018. He admitted that he had “at least three” angry episodes,  over the past
year. He described these episodes as “being  angry for at least a  minimum  of 15  to  20
minutes.” His angry periods sometimes last three or four days, but they cycle on and off
rather than run continuously. Many of his angry episodes are prompted by his inability to
perform  to  the  standards  he  has  set  for  himself.  He  testified  that  during  his  angry
episodes, he stops talking, becomes reclusive, and does not engage with others. He has
learned to channel his anger in a different direction by talking out loud, writing, walking,
and focusing on positive events. (Tr. 48-52)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  decided  that  “sitting  and  contemplating  hurting
yourself  and  hurting  others  is  no  way  to  live.”  He  now  focuses  on  a  good  marriage,  a
“fairly decent” job, and  his “beautiful granddaughter.”  Regarding  his  granddaughter,  he
testified,
It’s pretty joyous to  get  to  come  home  and  see  her. And  you  know, when  I
see   my  granddaughter,  no   matter  what  I’ve   gone   through   today,  [it]   just
melts away all that anger and  angst for me. She is pretty amazing. And the
stuff   that  I’ve   gone   through   pales  in   comparison   to   seeing   her  grow  and
learn and  just  experience  life. And  I’d  like  to  be  there and  experience  a  little
more life with her.

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.d,  mostly  with
explanations. He admitted SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b, 3.a, 3.b, and 4.a-4.c, without comment. He
did not answer the cross-allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.c and 4.d. I construe those answers
as  denials.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  29  years  old.  He  has  never  married  and  he  has  no  children.  He
earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  2012  and  has  taken  some  college  courses.  He  has
been employed by a federal contractor as an information technology (IT) specialist since
August  2014.  He  testified  that  he  has  held  a  secret  or  interim  secret  clearance  since
2014, though he asserted  that he did not have  actual access to  classified  information.
He has held his current position as an IT team lead since May 2019. He has an annual
salary of about $96,000. He works on a military base. (GE 1; Tr. 12, 27-32, 61-65, 105)
In  March  2013,  Dr.  S  diagnosed  Applicant  with  major  depressive  disorder  and
atypical  depressive  disorder.  Dr.  S’s  notes  indicate  that  Applicant  “has  clinical
depression;  has  not  been  on  meds  for  several  months,  having  anxiety  attacks,  sleep
deprivation.”  He  was  brought  for  medical  attention  by  his  mother.  (GE  9)  He  did  not
seek medical approval before ceasing his medication at the time. (Tr. 68-70)
GE 8 is comprised of treatment records for Applicant from Dr. M and Dr. J from
September  2013  to  January  2019.  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  generalized  anxiety
disorder and atypical depressive disorder. He acknowledged experiencing symptoms of
depression and anxiety since age 12. (Tr. 65-67, 71-78, 80-81)
On or about September 27, 2017, Applicant then age 23, went to the emergency
room  (ER)  of  Hospital  C  complaining  of  depression  and  anxiety.  He  reported  drinking
alcohol and using cocaine as coping mechanisms, and that he had consumed a fifth of
alcohol and used cocaine the night before. He reported intermittent thoughts of suicide
(though  not  at  that  time)  but  has  never  had  a  plan.  (GE  5  at  1-2;  Tr.  83-85)  He  was
admitted to the hospital due to “suicidal ideation” (i.e., thoughts of suicide). (GE 2 at 13)
(SOR ¶ 1.a)
At  Hospital  C,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder,
recurrent,  moderate.  (GE  2  at  15)  He  was  discharged  from  Hospital  C  on  October  2,
2017 and referred to Treatment Center P for inpatient substance abuse treatment. (GE
2 at 15; Tr. 83-85) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 3.a) He was diagnosed at Treatment Center P with
alcohol  use  disorder,  severe;  cocaine  use  disorder,  severe;  cannabis  use  disorder,
severe, tobacco use disorder, mild; and major depressive disorder. (GE 6 at 2)
Treatment  Center  P  records  reflect  that  Applicant  reported  first using  alcohol  at
17. He was found to be severely dependent on alcohol, with daily reported use over the
previous three years. He reported drinking a fifth of alcohol 20 of the previous 30 days,
and  using  cocaine  five  of  the  previous  30  days,  before  his  ER  admission.  He  began
using marijuana at age 16 and used it for four years regularly. (GE 6 at 2; Tr. 79, 86-87)
(SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b)  During  his  testimony,  Applicant  asserted  that  the  frequency  of  his
cocaine  use,  as  reflected  in  GE  6,  is  inaccurate  as  he  only  recalled  or  acknowledged
using  cocaine  twice.  (Tr.  86-87)  He  denied  marijuana  use  within  30  days  of  entering
treatment. (Tr. 88; GE 6 at 2)
Applicant  did  not  complete  inpatient  treatment  at  Treatment  Center  P.  He  left
abruptly on October 14, 2017, reportedly because he did not want to be there anymore.
His  prognosis  was  poor  due  to  his  inability  to  successfully  complete  treatment.  It  was
noted that he  would benefit from readmission to residential treatment and involvement
in  a  12-step  program.  (GE  6  at  3;  Tr.  89)  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  It  was  recommended  that
Applicant  continue  to  abstain  from  alcohol  and  drugs;  that  he  consider  outpatient
psychiatric  treatment  and  behavioral  counseling;  attend  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA),
Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  or  other  meetings  daily;  and  submit  to  random  urinalysis
and  breath  analysis  as  directed.  (GE  6  at  1)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  not
done any of these things. (Tr. 90)
In December 2017, Applicant went to the ER at Hospital C due to insomnia and
acute anxiety after running out of his medication, Wellbutrin. He was not admitted. (GE
2 at 3. GE 7; Tr. 95-97) (SOR ¶ 3.b) Afterwards, his mother wrote a letter to his primary
care physician, Dr. J, about Applicant’s anxiety. (GE 8 at 8-9; Tr. 97)
Applicant  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  had  been  treated  for  depression  at
Hospital C in about September 2017 and needed to get on the right medication. (GE 1
at 24-25; Tr. 83) He reported being treated for alcohol use at Treatment Center P from
September to October 2017. (GE 1 at 27-28) He  did not report any  illegal drug use  in
the previous seven years; he reported no illegal drug involvement while in possession of
a clearance; and he reported no drug treatment. (GE 1 at 26-27) (SOR ¶¶ 4.a, 4.b) He
reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  had  been  previously  granted  a  clearance  by  DOD  but
provided no details. (GE 1 at 28-29)
Applicant  had  background  interviews  relating  to  his  SCA  in  September  2018,
May 2019, and July 2019. In his first interview, he verified his reported hospitalization at
Hospital C and said it was for depression. He also discussed his history of alcohol use.
He said he had not been diagnosed as abusing alcohol or being alcohol dependent. He
did not disclose any other issues of substance abuse. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 90)
In Applicant’s May 2019 interview, he said he was hospitalized at Hospital C for
one week for medication maintenance after his primary care physician, Dr. J, changed
his anti-depression medication. He said he was not hospitalized for any other condition.
He  discussed his substance abuse  counseling at Treatment Center  P, and his alcohol
involvement  and  history  at  the  time.  He  was  asked  if  he  had  used  illegal  drugs  in  the
past  seven  years,  to  include marijuana, and he  said  no.  (GE  2 at 8-10;  Tr.  83,  91-92)
(SOR ¶ 4.c) He acknowledged at his hearing that his time at Treatment Center P would
be considered drug counseling. (Tr. 92)
Applicant was interviewed a third time, in July 2019. He was confronted about his
prior marijuana and cocaine use. He said he had used cocaine once in 2017, then said
he used it once or twice between June 2011 and the present. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b) (Tr. 60)
He denied being a habitual user of cocaine and said his cocaine use was experimental.
He  said  he  used  marijuana  between  2008  and  late  2011  about  10  times  a  year,  with
varying frequency. He used it to help him sleep and to cope with depression. He said he
had  not used  marijuana  since  2011  and  had  not  used  cocaine  since  2017.  He  denied
intentionally omitting his illegal drug use from his SCA. Earlier in the interview, he said
he did not list his drug use because he believed it was not on record anywhere and was
not a problem. (GE 2 at 10-11; Tr. 92-93) (SOR ¶ 4.c)
Applicant also disclosed that the real reason for his hospitalization at Hospital C
in  2017  was  for  both  medication  maintenance  and  alcohol  treatment.  (GE  2  at  11-12)
He  authenticated  the  three  interview  summaries  as  accurate  in  a  signed  but  undated
interrogatory response. (GE 2)
In  November 2020,  Applicant participated  in a  psychological  evaluation  ordered
by  the  DOD  CAF  related  to  his  security  clearance  investigation.  The  evaluation  was
conducted  by  Dr.  B,  a  Ph.D.  licensed  clinical  psychologist.  She  reviewed  medical
records  provided  by  the  DOD  CAF,  as  well  as  his  SCA  and  background  interview
summaries.  She  also  conducted  a  clinical  interview,  testing  observations,  and  a
personality assessment inventory (PAI). (GE 3 at 1-2, GE 4) (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 3.c)
Applicant  told  Dr.  B  that  he  had  always  been  a  “casual”  drinker  and  had  never
engaged  in  binge  drinking.  He  drank  more  prior  to  his  2017  hospitalization  and  was
mixing  alcohol  with  his  prescribed  medications.  He  said  he  had  reduced  his  drinking
significantly since 2018, consuming a bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer a week. (GE 3
at 4) (SOR ¶ 1.d) He said he took Zoloft as needed and that he meets with his primary
care doctor every three months for refills. (GE  3 at 3, 4)
With respect to drug use, Applicant told Dr. B that he stopped smoking marijuana
at age 22. He acknowledged trying cocaine on “a couple of occasions in my past,” and
said he had only used cocaine twice in 2018. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b) He said his three-day
hospitalization in 2017 was due to switching medications and was “just to be safe.” He
did not disclose his 2017 substance abuse treatment at Center P or his subsequent ER
visit in 2017. It was noted that records from 2019 indicated that he has a history of not
being  fully  candid  about  his  cocaine  and  marijuana  use  during  interviews  and  in  his
case paperwork. (GE 3 at 4)
Dr.  B  found  that  Applicant  acknowledged  his  history  of  depression  and  anxiety
but tended to minimize  his symptoms. He “severely downplayed his history of alcohol,
cocaine,  and  marijuana  use  and  he  was  not  fully  candid  about  his  struggles  with
substances. His lack of candor “appears to be a pattern.” (GE 3 at 6)
Dr. B found Applicant’s lack of honesty regarding his history of substance abuse
“particularly concerning” since he failed to complete his residential treatment program in
2017;  he  was  given  a  poor  prognosis  by  counselors;  he  failed  to  follow  through  on
discharge  instructions;  had  not  received  mental  health  or  substance  abuse  treatment
since  2017  and  continued  to  consume  alcohol  at  a  fairly  high  level.  Dr.  B  found  that
Applicant’s  demonstrated  lack  of  honesty  impacted  the  credibility  of  his  self-reporting
about his prior drug use. His prognosis was “guarded, at best.” (GE 3 at 6)
Dr.  B.  diagnosed  Applicant  with  (1)  major  depressive  disorder  (moderate,
recurrent) (DSM 296.32); (2) alcohol use disorder, severe (DSM 303.90); (3) cannabis
disorder (severe) (DSM 304.30); and (4) stimulant use disorder (severe) (DSM 304.40).
(GE 3 at 6) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Dr.  B.  found  that  major  depressive  disorder  tends  to  be  a  chronic  and  highly
recurrent condition. Applicant has experienced symptoms since childhood. His tendency
to self-medicate, coupled with ongoing alcohol use, inadequate treatment and, “perhaps
most importantly, limited insight and transparency, point to a guarded prognosis. At this
time,  [Applicant’s]  diagnoses  could  pose  a  risk  to  his  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness concerning classified information.” (GE 3 at 6) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a,  because  he  said  he  never  had  or  expressed
thoughts  of  suicide.  (Tr.  33-34)  He  denied  SOR  ¶  1.b  because  he  said  he  abstained
from alcohol for a year, and sought therapy, but the doctor he consulted in late 2017 did
not  carry  his  insurance.  (Tr.  110)  He  did  not  pursue  mental  health  treatment  or
counseling after that or during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not done so since then.
(Tr. 110-111) He has consulted his primary care physician whom he has seen for many
years.  (Tr.  110-112)  He  is  currently  prescribed  propranolol  (anti-anxiety)  and  Zoloft
(anti-depressant).  (Answer;  Tr.  34-39)  He  said  he  continues  to  experience  “sundown
syndrome” (the worsening of his anxiety or depression at night). (Tr, 97-98; GE 8 at 8)
He denied mental health issues at work necessitating treatment. (Tr. 99)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  before  his  2017  treatment,  his  drinking  had
increased to four times a week, which he acknowledged was “binge drinking” and self-
medication, where “one day would lead to the next day.” (Tr. 42) He was consuming a
bottle of wine or a fifth of liquor per occasion. (Tr. 45-47, 78) He said it “took a while” to
realize what he was doing. He knows now that he cannot do that. This led him to self-
refer, with some family assistance, to Hospital C in 2017 for treatment and “so I can get
on the right medication.” (Tr. 43)
Applicant  said  he  left  Treatment  Center  P  because  of  anxiety  and  unfamiliarity
with  being  around  a  lot  of  people.  He  said  his  departure  did  not  relate  to  alcohol.  He
now  sees  that  he  should  have  completed  the  program.  He  recognizes  that  he  was  at
“rock-bottom” at the time and does not want to feel that way again. (Tr. 44-45)
Applicant said he resumed drinking socially after about a year of sobriety in about
2018  or  2019  but  consumed  less  alcohol.  (Tr.  39-41)  He  said  “I  knew  myself  enough
that, in a social capacity, I could be able to continue consuming alcohol.”  (Tr. 42) He did
so unilaterally, “coming [to] a personal moment, trying to, you know, see how I do.”  (Tr.
100)  He  acknowledged  that  this  was  “probably  not”   recommended.  He  found  it  a  “big
step”   that he could have one drink and then stop. (Tr. 101) Later, however, during the
COVID-19  pandemic,  when  he  was  at  home  teleworking  full  time,  he  on  occasion
consumed  a  whole  bottle  of  wine  or  a  12-pack  of  beer  at  home  at  one  sitting.  “Every
now and then throughout 2020 I did that,” he said. (Tr. 102)
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.c,  which  asserts  that  he  engages  in  ongoing  severe
substance  abuse.  (Answer;  Tr.  47-48)  He  testified  that  he  has  made  an  “agreement”
with himself to know his limits. He said he can go months without drinking. He continues
to have one or two drinks on dates or social occasions. He last had a drink three weeks
before the hearing, one or two drinks on a golf course, and then two months before that.
He said he had not been intoxicated in a year or more, when he had “a couple glasses
of mixed drinks” at his brother’s birthday party. (Tr. 49-51, 100)
Applicant  has  never  received  a  medical  opinion  that  he  could  drink  again.  (Tr.
102)  Since  2018,  he  has  sought  no  mental  health  counseling,  except  from  Dr.  J,  his
primary  care  physician.  He  sees  her  every  three  to  four  months  for  medication  refills
and for primary care treatment. He said he has “for the most part”  kept to his medication
regimen since his 2017 treatment, though he has continued drinking on days he took his
medication. He has not sought treatment in the ER since then. (Tr. 102-105)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  any  drug  or  alcohol  counseling  or  treatment
since  he  left  Treatment  Center  P.  He  has  not  participated  in  AA  meetings.  (Tr.  51-52,
112-113) He said he drinks alcohol less than once a week, and no longer consumes a
bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer at one sitting, as he did in 2020, at the time of  his
DOD evaluation by Dr. B. (Tr. 99-100)
Applicant said he had not used marijuana since 2011 and had not used cocaine
since  2017.  He  had  a  clearance  in  2017  when  he  used  cocaine.  He  used  it  twice,  in
social situations like at a bar. He acknowledged that cocaine and marijuana are illegal
under federal law and inconsistent with holding a clearance. He believes he is subject to
random drug testing at work. (Tr. 53-54, 88, 93-94, 105-107)
Applicant acknowledged that Dr. B’s report shows he used cocaine twice in 2018,
not  2017,  but  he  thinks  he  may  have  meant  2017.  (Tr.  107-108;  GE  3  at  4)  He  also
asserted that statements in Treatment Center P’s records that he used cocaine starting
at age 23 and used cocaine regularly for one year, including five of the past 3 days prior
to  September  26,  2017,  were  “not  accurate.”  Similarly,  he  denied  that  he  had  used
marijuana for four years regularly, asserting that he had not used marijuana since high
school.  (Tr.  108-109;  GE  6  at  2)  He  was  unable  to  explain  why  his  testimony
contradicted Dr. B’s records. (Tr. 109-110)
As to Guideline E, Applicant testified that he first applied for a clearance at age
20, and he was young and did not get good advice from his company on how to fill out
the SCA. He asserted that he did not disclose his 2011 marijuana use on his first SCA
(in 2014) due to naivety and because it occurred in high school, before he turned 18. He
graduated from high school in 2012. (Tr. 27-28, 55-59)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  did  not  disclose  his  2017  cocaine  use  or  his
2011 marijuana use on his 2018 SCA. (Tr. 54) He said he held a clearance at the time,
granted  sometime  after  2014.  (Tr.  57-58)  He  testified  that  he  did  not  input  any  new
information on his 2018 SCA. He was just told to “review this and just hit Okay.”  (Tr. 27-
28, 31) He did disclose  his treatments at Hospital C and Treatment  Center P  in 2017,
both  of  which  were  after  his  first  SCA.  (Tr.  32)  He  did  not  intend  to  mislead  the
government.  (Tr.  32)  He  said  he  came  clean  because  he  was  confronted  by  the
interviewer, who had evidence of his cocaine use in his medical records. (Tr. 56-57, 59-
60)
Applicant asserted that his future intention as to illegal drug use is “never to use.”
He  believes  he  is  “well  past  the  dependency  for  it  and  the  self-medication.”  He  will
continue drinking socially but will continue working on cutting back on his drinking. (Tr.
113-115) he said he always uses a ride-share service when he is out drinking and has
never had a DUI or been pulled over by the police. (Tr. 113-115)
Applicant has worked at his DOD job for his whole career. He cannot change the
past but can continue  to  work on  improving himself. He has had  no  criminal issues or
workplace issues. His personal issues have never affected his work life. (Tr. 28-30) He
closed his testimony by stating  that he has presented himself as best he can and has
come a long way in the last eight years. He feels blessed to be where he is today. He
loves his job and wants to continue his career. (Tr. 116-118)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  retained  counsel,  and  he  submitted  additional
exhibits.  In  a  post-hearing  Declaration,  he  said  he  wished  he  had  completed  the
program  at  Treatment  Center  P  in  2017,  but  still  learned  from  the  experience.  He
reaffirmed that he had not used cocaine or marijuana since leaving the facility. He said
that since his hearing, he has attended AA meetings. He did not see himself as “having
a problem” in the past but now acknowledges that “any use is [too] much.” He has dealt
with  clinical  depression  and  anxiety  for  most  of  his  adult  life  and  has  taken  them
seriously. He has begun vetting therapists so he can pursue regular care and continue
progressing. (AE C) Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent not to use illegal
drugs  in  the  future  and  acknowledged  that  any  violation  was  grounds  for  automatic
revocation of his clearance. (AE E)
Applicant  submitted  character  letters  from  two  longtime  friends  and  from  an
executive  with his employer.  They attest that  Applicant cares about  his job, his family,
his  friends,  and  his  career.  He  has  worked  hard  to  improve  himself.  He  is  very
trustworthy  personally  and  professionally.  He  is  more  mature  and  responsible  than  he
was earlier in his career. He is reliable, trustworthy, and emotionally stable. He should
retain his clearance. (AE D)
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard
",True
"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.d and 2.f. He partially admitted and
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 2.a
through 2.c, 2.e, 2.g, and 3.a. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees. He married
in  2004  and  divorced  in  2015.  He  has  a  15-year-old  child  from  the  marriage.  He  has
worked  for  federal  contractors  since  approximately  2007  and  for  the  same  federal
contractor since 2011. He has held a security clearance during this time without incident.
He was also employed part-time as an adjunct instructor for a college from 2006 to 2019.
(Tr. 41-43; GE 1)
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant started college when he was 18 years old, and he pledged a fraternity.
Alcohol use  was  part of  the  culture of  fraternity  membership  and  the  first  time  he  was
intoxicated was on pledge day in 1993. Before then he had experimented with alcohol
use infrequently but was never intoxicated. He lived in the fraternity house as a freshman
and every event at the fraternity house involved alcohol. He testified that while in college
he  regularly  used  alcohol  and  became  intoxicated.  He  said  that  while  he  was  married
from 2004 to 2015 he used alcohol on a limited basis but there were times he used it in
excess and to the point of intoxication. (Tr. 43-46)
In 1993, at the age of 18, Applicant was arrested and charged with consumption
of alcohol by a minor. He was a passenger in a car when it was pulled over by the police.
He was given a field sobriety test and failed. He pleaded no contest and was required to
attend a class for those charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and to
perform community service. He completed both requirements. (Tr. 46-47; GE 3)
In 1995, Applicant was driving from a club to his fraternity house. He was stopped
by  the  police,  given  a  field  sobriety  test,  and  failed.  A  blood  alcohol  test  was  not
administered. He was charged with DUI. He pleaded guilty, was required to attend DUI
school, perform community service, and was on probation. He completed the terms of the
sentence. (Tr. 47-48; GE 3)
In  1999,  Applicant  was  driving  to  his  fraternity  house  after  leaving  a  party.  He
completed a U-turn too fast and was stopped by police. He completed a field sobriety test
and was arrested because he was impaired. He was 24 years old at the time. He was
charged with DUI. He pleaded guilty. As part of his sentence, he was required to complete
a 12-week alcohol abuse treatment program, perform community service, and he was on
probation. Applicant credibly testified that since his 1999 DUI arrest and conviction, he
has had no additional police involvement regarding his alcohol use. He testified that he
was young and made some bad decisions. (Tr. 48-51; GE 3)
Applicant testified that to comply with his sentence, from April 2000 to September
2000, he attended the court-ordered group therapy as an outpatient. He said the therapy
was not specific to alcohol abuse. He successfully completed the program and did not
receive a diagnosis. There was no aftercare required. He testified that at that time he did
not feel like he needed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He said he tempered his
alcohol consumption but continued to drink. He finished college and moved on with his
life and left the fraternity scene. (Tr. 51-53, 130)
Applicant  testified  that  in  February  2019  he  changed  his  alcohol  consumption
because he thought he had a problem. He discussed it with his fiancée. He made the
decision  that  day  to  attend  an  alcohol  recovery  program  and  entered  the  program  the
same day. He said that he and his fiancée had arguments that were fueled by alcohol.
When they moved in together his alcohol consumption increased. She would drink two to
four  drinks  a  night  and  alcohol  was  part  of  their  relationship.  His  decision  to  attend
treatment ended their relationship. He said he did not think she wanted to live in a sober
house. He was in treatment for 30 days. During that time, she ended the relationship and
told him not to return to the house. They had been together for three years. He said the
break-up was emotionally crushing. (Tr. 55-58, 125-128)
After completion of the program, he was aware that he should not consume alcohol
and it was recommended he attend AA. He attended AA and leaned on the community
during his breakup and attended additional meetings. He said it was difficult to stay sober.
When he completed the rehabilitation program, he said he was never told of any type of
diagnosis. He attended AA for about a year until approximately March 2020 and stopped
because  he  was  not  comfortable  with  the  spiritual  aspect  of  AA.  Instead,  he  began  to
participate in Smart Recovery, which is an alternative to AA that has more of a cognitive
psychological  and scientific  approach  to  sobriety.  Participants  develop a  community of
people and meet regularly to analyze behavior and actions. He started by attending three
meetings a week, and since the spring of 2020, he attends weekly meetings. He finds it
is  easier  for  him  to  subscribe  to  their  program  than  to  AA.  He  did  not  receive  an
independent  evaluation  regarding  a  diagnosis  of  bipolar  disorder  while  in  treatment.
Applicant testified he told the treatment facility that he was being treated for the condition.
(Tr. 58-68, 139-144; AE E)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  April  2019.  He
questioned  some  of  the  information  the  investigator  included  in  the  summary  of  his
interview.  He  said  he  does  not  think  he  would  have  been  able  to  estimate  how  many
drinks he had per occasion while in college. He denied 6 to 12 beers every weekend. He
admitted that from December 2017 to February 2019 he was consuming alcohol three to
six times a week and towards the end of this period it was between 50-75 ml of vodka
each time. (Tr. 53-55, 132)
Applicant  admitted   he   relapsed   in  July  2021.  He  testified   that  he   had   not  really
accepted  that he  had  a  problem  or that he  was an  alcoholic. He was going  through  the
motions to  see  if he  could control himself. He started to  drink and  was unable to  stop for
several  days.  In   September  2021,  he   tried   to   drink  again  because   he   was  still   not
convinced that he did  not have control. He  binge  drank for several days.  (Tr. 68-72, 138-
139)
Applicant testified that on September 13, 2021, he had an epiphany and realized
he could not keep doing what he was doing. He committed to complete sobriety that day.
He acknowledged that he tested the waters before because he did not want to believe he
had no control over his alcohol consumption. He thought he could control it but could not.
He testified that he knows he can totally abstain, but if he has one drink, he cannot stop.
He  credibly  testified  that  he  will not  consume  alcohol  ever  again. He  accepts he  is an
alcoholic, and he will always be in recovery. He signed a letter of intent never to consume
alcohol  again.  He  admitted  that  in  the  past  he  may  have  said  he  would  not  consume
alcohol again and did, but when he made those statements, he had not accepted the fact
that he is not in control and is an alcoholic. He now has. (Tr. 68-76; AE K)
Psychological Conditions
From  about  August  2017  to  May  2018,  Applicant  received  treatment  from  a
counseling center. He was seen by Dr. T.S., a psychologist. He said he was in a new
relationship  and  was  having  anxiety.  Dr.  T.S.  diagnosed  him  with  adjustment  disorder
with  mixed  anxiety,  and  depressed  mood.  He  saw  her  minimally  once  a  month  and
sometimes twice a month. (Tr. 76-78, 82, 118-119; AE D)
Applicant testified that he received  treatment from J.A., a  nurse practitioner with  a
psychiatric  specialty,   from   about  April  2018   to   November  2020.  He  disputes  that  he
refused  medication  and  said  he  took all  prescribed  medication  as  required. He  said J.A.
diagnosed  him  with  bipolar disorder and  prescribed  him  between  10  and  15  medications.
He testified  that  some  of medications had  serious side  effects,  others  required  monitoring
through  blood  work; and  some  made  him  feel catatonic. His fiancée  at the  time  told him
he  needed  to  have  J.A. check his medications. J.A. conducted  her  work through  email
and changed  his medication  multiple times. He decided he could not accept her trial and
error approach. He and  J.A. frequently discussed  his medications and  dosages.  When
J.A. diagnosed  him  with  bipolar disorder,  he  said it was a  surprise  because  he  had  never
had   a   manic  episode.   He  researched   the   different  levels  of  bipolar   disorder,   and   he
believed   his  symptoms  could   be   attributed   to   other  psychological   disorders.  He   was
skeptical of  the  diagnosis but  agreed  to  continue  on  medication.  He testified  that J.A.  was
aware  that  he  consumed  alcohol but  not that  he  had  a  problem.  She  never mentioned
that a  potential alcohol  use  disorder could possibly mimic symptoms of bipolar disorder.
(Tr. 60, 78-83, 93, 119-125, 135-137; GE  4)
Applicant testified that he informed Dr. T.S. of J.A.’s diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
He  said  she  was  surprised  and  warned  him  to  be  cautious.  He  considered  getting  a
second opinion but thought he would give the medication a try. He testified  he always
followed J.A.’s directions when she changed his medications. He said he would continue
to  take  the  prescribed  medications  until  something  new  was  prescribed.  In  2020,  he
stopped seeing J.A. because she left the practice, and her new practice did not accept
his insurance. (Tr. 78-83)
In   December  2020,  Applicant  began   seeing   R.J.,   a   nurse  practitioner  with   a
psychiatric specialty. He  said she  did not believe  he  had  a  bipolar disorder,  and  she  did
not  treat   him   for  it.  Her  concern  was   his  insomnia.  She   prescribed   medication   for  his
insomnia.  He  testified  that  she  never diagnosed  him  with  bipolar disorder. He  informed
R.J. that he  had  gone  to  alcohol treatment  and  that he  had  an  alcohol use  disorder. He is
on  two  medications she  prescribed  that are not habit  forming  and  do  not interfere  with  his
commitment  to  sobriety. In  June  2021,  R.J.  left  the  practice  and  Applicant was transferred
as a  patient to M.B, a  nurse practitioner with  a psychiatric specialty.  (Tr. 83-89)
Applicant  continues   to   take   two   medications   prescribed   by  M.B.   and   she   has
changed   his  dosage   because   he   wants   to   take   as   little  medication   as   possible   and
minimize side effects.  He testified  that M.B. has not diagnosed him  with bipolar disorder.
She  is aware  of his past alcohol abuse.  A statement  was  provided  by M.B.  (March  18,
2022) verifying  that  Applicant  has  been  under her  care  since  June  2021  and  meets  with
her monthly. He has been  consistently compliant with  his treatment plan  and  reports long-
term   stability  at  current  medication   dosages.   He  has  diagnoses   of   sleep   disorder  and
generalized  anxiety disorder. She  described  him  as asymptomatic  for  several consecutive
months.  He is steadily cooperative, euthymic, clear, alert, insightful and  organized.  She
also noted  Applicant had  granted  permission  to release  his medical information,  and  she
was available to  provide  additional information. He plans to  continue  his treatment with
M.B. (Tr. 89-95, 148; AE C)
Applicant testified that when he was being treated by J.A. he felt terrible. He said
since being treated by M.B. he is able to function and feels balanced. He described his
functioning level as the difference between night and day, from when he was being treated
by J.A. He now has his issues under control with the treatment provided by M.B. He has
followed  her  treatment  plan  and  credibly  testified  that  he  would  not  discontinue  any
medication without consultation from a medical professional. (Tr. 89-95)
Since September 2022, Applicant also has been a patient of J.B, a licensed clinical
social worker. He meets with her at least monthly and sometimes twice a month. He sees
her about dealing with his sobriety and how to lead a sober life and potentially having a
romantic  relationship  in  the  future.  She  provided  a  letter  stating  Applicant  has  been
consistently compliant with his treatment plan and attendance. He is engaged in therapy
to better himself in both his personal and professional life and relationships. He continues
to exhibit long-term stability in his sobriety and medication compliance. (AE J)
Applicant testified that he is not afraid to seek help and has been proactive since
2017 with regards to his mental health. He is committed to maintaining his medication
and treatment. If he believed he was bipolar he would seek the necessary treatment and
follow prescribed protocol. (Tr. 108-110)
The  DOD requested  that Applicant participate  in a  psychological evaluation  by  a
government-approved  psychologist. In  June  2021,  he  was evaluated  by Dr.  B. Applicant
testified that he  had a  43-minute virtual meeting using  the Zoom  platform.  Dr. B  sent him
a   computer   link  to   complete   a   multiple   choice   test  that  took   approximately  an   hour  to
complete. He described  her as clinical and  not open. He did  not feel comfortable with  her
because  of her demeanor, so  he  was not comfortable discussing  private  matters in his
life  with  her. She  made  no  attempt to  make  him  feel comfortable.  Her questions were  not
open   ended,   but  rather  required   a   yes   or no   answer,   so   that   is  the   type   of   answer  he
provided. He  said  he  told Dr. B  that J.A.  had  diagnosed  him  with  bipolar disorder, but  later
R.J.  did   not  agree   with   the   diagnosis.   He  testified   that  Dr.   B   did   not  discuss  bipolar
disorder with  him.  He  said he  was honest,  but not  open  because  of the  way  she  conducted
the  interview. He answered the questions she asked. He disputed several of the facts as
inaccurate that Dr. B used in  her evaluation. (Tr. 95-104)
Dr. B noted that Applicant was cooperative but his answers were inconsistent with
medical documentation. She administered the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).
The  validity  scales  indicated  considerable  defensiveness.  She  said,  “[H]e  appears
motivated to portray himself as being exceptionally free of common shortcomings to which
most individuals will admit.” She believed due to this, his PAI clinical scale is unlikely to
be a valid reflection of his current level of functioning. She found his treatment motivation
is a great deal lower than of typical individuals being seen in treatment settings. (GE 5)
Dr. B diagnosed Applicant based on her interview, a review of available records
and an analysis of current psychological results as follows: bipolar disorder, unspecific;
generalized anxiety disorder; and alcohol use disorder, severe. She could not determine
if  he  had  type  I  or  type  II  bipolar  disorder. She  noted  he  had  been  noncompliant  with
treatment for both anxiety and bipolar disorder. She noted he was not forthcoming with
information about his alcohol use, which suggested he is unlikely to be fully in recovery.
She noted his lack of candor. She believed he was at high risk of relapse for his alcohol
use disorder, as well as manic and/or depressive episodes. She believed he has been
dishonest, making his trustworthiness questionable. She found he may not follow rules
and regulations and had multiple conditions that could impact his conduct. She found he
could display poor judgment and reliability and that he was at risk for impulsive behavior.
His  ability  to  safeguard  classified  information  is  likely  to  be  compromised  and  his
prognosis is poor. It does not appear she contacted Applicant’s treating therapist or nurse
practitioner or any of the others. (GE 5)
On February 10, 2023, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. C, a licensed psychologist.
She noted that she was privy to the SOR allegations and a reported diagnosis of bipolar
disorder, general anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder. She also noted that it was
alleged  that  Applicant  reportedly  had  been  dishonest  to  Dr.  B  about  his mental health
treatment  and  alcohol  use  that  called  into  question  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and
good  judgment.  Dr.  C conducted  her  examination  through  video-teleconference.  Dr.  C
asked Applicant his perspective about the allegations in the SOR, and he indicated that
it all started when he checked himself in for alcohol rehabilitation and it was required to
be reported to DOD. (Tr. 104; AE A)
Dr. C reviewed the SOR, documents from his counseling services, Dr. B’s report,
behavioral recovery certificate, and miscellaneous records and letters from his previous
treatment  providers.  She  also  conducted  a  semi-structured  clinical
interview,
observations, administration of objective personality measure, PAI, and subjective report
symptoms  via  the  Clinically  Useful  Depression  Outcome  scale,  Post-traumatic  Stress
Disorder checklist, drug abuse screening test, mood disorder questionnaire, and alcohol
use disorder identification kit, among other tests. (AE A)
Dr. C noted that J.A. diagnosed Applicant with bipolar disorder in April 2018 but
noted  that  diagnostically  it  was  unclear  from  the  medical  record  why  J.A.  believed
Applicant  met  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  bipolar  as  it  does  not  appear  he  specifically
endorsed  symptoms  of  mania  or  hypomania.  She  noted,  however,  that  Applicant  did
endorse excessive use of alcohol in June 2018 and that J.A. should have re-evaluated
her  diagnostic  impression.  Dr.  C  noted  that  Applicant  saw  J.A.  monthly  and  reported
concerns  of  depression  and  alcohol misuse  secondary  to  relationship  distress  until  he
self-referred to alcohol treatment in February 2019. (AE A)
Dr. C noted that Applicant reported he was coping with stress through alcohol and
he was becoming a person he did not want to be. He was drinking a fifth of vodka or more
daily. He reported his fiancée broke up with him during treatment and he also lost friends
who took her side. He said while participating in treatment he was diagnosed with bipolar
disorder II, generalized anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. Dr. C asked Applicant
why  he  believed  he  was  diagnosed  with  bipolar  disorder,  and  he  indicated  “well  I  told
them I was diagnosed with it and they had to keep me on my medication because you
can’t just  go  off  that medication.” After he  completed treatment, he returned to therapy
with  J.A.  who  subsequently  left  the  practice.  Applicant  told  Dr.  C  after  he  completed
alcohol  treatment,  he  wondered  if  he  met  the  criteria  for  bipolar  disorder  and  said  he
asked  to  be  re-evaluated  because  he  had  discontinued  use  of  alcohol.  When  he  was
transferred to R.J. she re-evaluated him and diagnosed him with primary insomnia and
alcohol use disorder in remission until May 2021. (AE A)
Dr. C noted that in June 2021, Applicant began treatment with M.B., and continues
to  see  her  monthly  to  this  day.  She  has  never  diagnosed  him  with  mood  disorder  but
instead with generalized anxiety disorder and sleep disorder. He is prescribed medication
and has reportedly been compliant with all treatment sessions and medication. (AE A)
Dr. C also noted that Applicant sees J.B., a licensed clinical social worker. He has
seen her biweekly since approximately September 2022 with care focused predominately
on  increased  anxiety  in  social  interactions  since  COVID.  Applicant  reported  that  the
majority of his treatment is focused on what his social life will look like now that he is sober
and trying not to be a hermit. (Tr. 107; AE A)
Applicant disclosed to Dr. C that he has been sober since September 13, 2021,
and  that  he  relapsed  twice  when  he  tested  the  waters  to  see  if  he  could  control  his
drinking. (AE A)
Dr. C specifically and thoroughly focused her clinical interview and questions about
symptoms  of  bipolar  disorder.  She  stated:  “Upon  further  inquiry,  it  is  possible  that  his
previous  provider,  [J.A.]  misidentified  his  symptoms  of  substance  use  with  those  of
hypomania  and  failed  to  appropriately  reevaluate  his  symptom  presentation  upon  his
sobriety.” (AE A page 5)
Dr. C had Applicant complete several psychological screeners. The results of the
tests are as follows:
Clinically Useful Depressive Outcome Scale = 1, not suggestive of depression.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 = 0, not suggestive of anxiety.
PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 = 5, not suggestive of trauma disorder.
Alcohol  Use  Disorders  Identification   Test  =   2,  suggestive  of  low  risk  alcohol
consumption at this time.
Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 = 0, not suggestive of problematic drug use.
Mood Disorder Questionnaire  = not indicative of a mood disorder diagnosis.
Dr. C concluded:
Collectively,  [Applicant’s]   scores  on   these   screeners  reflect  an   individual
who  is not experiencing  significant symptoms of psychological distress at
this  time   but   has  had   difficulties   with   alcohol  misuse   in   the   distant  past.
Consistent  with   self-report,  [Applicant]   endorsed   a   pronounced   history  of
alcohol use  since  college  but not understanding  the  true  impact of alcohol
use on his functioning  until approximately 2018. (AE A)
Dr. C was asked whether she agreed or disagreed with Dr. B’s findings. She stated:
In   general,  as   an   objective   third   party  to   [Dr.  B’s]  report,  I   found   the
evaluation  to  be  lacking  in thoroughness  and  objectivity given  the  gravity of
the  circumstances for which  the  evaluation  was conducted.  This ultimately
casts doubt on  the  reliability and  validity of the  findings. [Dr.  B] repeatedly
relied   on   historical  data   without  providing   context  or  an   opportunity  for
[Applicant]  to  provide  insight into  the  factors that contributed  to  conflicting
information.  (AE  A)
Dr.  C  provided  specific  details  of  why  she  questioned  Dr.  B’s  findings.  She
specially  noted  that  Dr.  B’s  diagnoses  of  bipolar  disorder,  unspecified;  alcohol  use
disorder, severe were primarily based on historical data with limited current behavioral
examples  that  would  have  helped  to  understand  how  she  arrived  at  these  diagnostic
conclusions. Dr. C stated:
There  was  also  no   evidence   that  she   conducted   a   contemporaneous,
structured   or  semi-structured   review  of  bipolar  disorder  (to   include
hypomanic  or  manic)   symptoms   before  labeling   [Applicant]   with   this
condition  that he  denied  having  at the  time  of her evaluation. It  appears [Dr.
B] relied  heavily on  a  combination  of inaccurate  historical medical data  and
the   results  of  the   Personality  Assessment   Inventory  (PAI),  which   was
notably lacking in elevations and specificity. (AE A  page 7)
Dr.  C  concluded  that  in  her  opinion  Dr.  B’s  evaluation  lacks  rigor  and  specificity  and
should  not  be  used  as  a  primary  aid  in  making  decisions  about  [Applicant’s]  security
clearance eligibility. (AE A)
Dr. C diagnosed Applicant with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia Disorder,
and  Alcohol Use  Disorder, Moderate, in  Sustained  Remission.  She did not find  evidence
to  support a  diagnosis of  Bipolar Disorder II.  She  noted  that  Applicant has  a  history of
symptoms  that  could  be  misconstrued  as  hypomanic in  the  context of an  active  substance
use   disorder.  She   noted   his  previous  provider  failed   to   adequately  and   appropriately
reevaluate  his symptom  presentation  based  on  his subsequent sobriety.  She  also noted
that   Dr. B   continued   to  fail   to   adequately evaluate  [Applicant’s] presentation   during   her
evaluation,   instead   relying   on   erroneous  historical  data   and   PAI   results  that  failed   to
provide rationale for the diagnoses offered. (AE A)
Dr. C stated Applicant’s prognosis is good. She found Applicant presently met the
diagnostic  criteria  for  mental  health  conditions  that  are  well  controlled  or  currently  in
sustained remission. Although he meets the criteria for several mental health conditions,
he  is  receiving  appropriate  mental  health  care  for  these  conditions  and  is  actively
implement
engaged,  receptive
interventions offered by his treating providers. She found he does not currently have a
mental health condition that could cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment,
or ability to safeguard sensitive or classified information or that would impair his reliability,
trustworthiness or judgment in protecting sensitive or classified information. (AE A page

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c,
2.a-2.f, 3.a, 3.c, and 4.d. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 3.b, 4.b, 4.c, 4.e, and 4.f.
On September 21, 2022, Department Counsel amended SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.c, 3.a, and 4.a.
The  amendment  purported  to  amend  SOR  ¶  5.f,  but  there  was  no  paragraph  5  in  the
original SOR. Applicant admitted all the amended allegations. At the hearing, Department
Counsel  corrected  the  erroneous  references  to  SOR  ¶¶  5.f  and  5.g  and  submitted  a
corrected amendment with the amended language in italics. The corrected version of the
SOR as amended before and during the hearing, with the changes in italics, is attached
to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. Applicant indicated on the record that he understood
the amendments and corrections of the SOR. (Tr. 8) His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant is  31  years  old. He  has been  offered  a  position  with  a  defense  contractor,
contingent  on   obtaining   a   security  clearance.   He   married   in   December   2014,  and   they
had  two  children, now ages 6  and  7. He divorced  his first wife  on  a  date  not reflected  in
the  record. He  married  his current wife  in November 2020, with  whom  he  has a  10-month-
old daughter.
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  June  2014  to  November
2016 and received an other than honorable discharge. He received a security clearance
while on active duty.
In April 2015, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform
Code  of  Military  Justice,  10  U.S.C.  §  815,  for  assaulting  another  sailor.  The  incident
involved a fist fight that occurred when Applicant asked a fellow sailor to help out on a
project and the fellow sailor did not respond. (GX 6 at 12) His punishment was restriction
for 30 days, extra duties for 30 days, reduction in rate, and forfeiture of one half of his
basic pay per month for two months. (GX 8 at 8)
In August 2016, Applicant and his wife had an altercation over his text messages
with another woman. At the hearing, he testified that his wife choked him, and he slapped
her to stop her from choking him. (Tr. 35-36) Applicant received nonjudicial punishment
for this incident, which consisted of reduction in rate, and forfeiture of one half of his pay
per month for two months, suspended for six months. (GX 8 at 2)
In November 2016, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery
on a family member. This incident occurred when Applicant  was playing a video game
when his wife was talking to him. When he ignored her, she broke the game controller,
and he responded by smashing the television screen. (GX 6 at 9) His wife claimed that
he struck her in the face and head, knocking her to the floor. At the hearing, he denied
hitting her, but admitted that he pushed her. He was charged by civilian authorities with
misdemeanor  assault  and  battery  on  a  family  member.  The  civilian  prosecution  was
deferred in February 2019 to enable Applicant to complete court-ordered counseling.  (GX
7 at 6; Tr. 40-41)
During  the  November  2016  altercation,  Applicant’s  wife  was  holding  their  baby
daughter. A protective order was issued against Applicant, and in January 2017, he was
listed as a child abuser in the state child abuse and neglect registry. (GX 11; GX 12) He
will remain on the registry until November 2023. (Tr. 41)
Applicant testified that he did not tell his commanding officer or the police that his
wife was the aggressor in the domestic incidents. His wife was on active duty in the Navy
and he kept silent in an effort to enable her to retain her military benefits. (Tr. 43)
On the day after the November 2016 altercation, Applicant attempted to commit
suicide by overdosing a prescribed muscle relaxant. He called his wife and told her that
he  had  ingested  the  drugs.  His  wife  called  an  ambulance,  and  he  was  taken  to  an
emergency room and then admitted to a military hospital. He received medical treatment
and  was  diagnosed  with  an  adjustment  disorder  with  depressed  mood.  He  was
hospitalized for two or three days and discharged. The medical authorities recommended
that he attend outpatient psychotherapy. He testified that he did not obtain psychotherapy
as  recommended,  but  he  began  obtaining  therapy  about  six  months  later  and  was
diagnosed with anxiety. He stopped the therapy when his therapist retired around 2019.
He resumed therapy for about six months in 2020 but stopped when his insurance would
no longer cover it. (Tr. 43-47; GX 5; GX 6 at 9)
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2012 to 2013. He resumed
his marijuana use in 2017, after he was discharged from the Navy, using it once or twice
a month. (GX 6 at 20). He testified that he has not smoked marijuana since 2020, because
most of his friends with whom he smoked marijuana are married and have children, and
several are DOD employees. (Tr. 66)
In  April  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  of  drugs,
possession of marijuana, tampering with evidence, driving with defective equipment, and
operation of a vehicle with an expired license tag. The evidence tampering charge was
based  on  a  police  officer  accusing  him  of  attempting  to  eat  marijuana  that  was  in  the
vehicle when he and an acquaintance were stopped by police. (GX 6 at 14)
The  police  report for the  April 2017  incident recites that the  police  were  operating
a   driver’s  license   checkpoint,   and   they  observed   Applicant’s  vehicle  turn  around   in  a
parking   lot   in  an   apparent  attempt  to   avoid  the   checkpoint.   At  the   hearing,  Applicant
admitted avoiding the checkpoint because he knew that his license tags were expired.
(Tr. 52)
When the police officer stopped Applicant’s vehicle, he noticed a strong smell of
marijuana, and observed that Applicant’s eyes were glassy and he seemed “out of it.” He
observed small pieces  of  what appeared  to  be  marijuana  in  Appellant’s lap  and  on  his
shirt. When Applicant exited the car, the piece of marijuana that was on his lap fell onto
the ground. The police officer asked Applicant to open his mouth and he saw small pieces
of  marijuana  on  his  tongue,  and  his  tongue  was  covered  with  a  green  film.  Applicant
declined to be tested for drugs. (GX 13)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  believed  he  was  innocent  of  the  drug
charges,  but  he  was  told  that  his  trial  would  not  be  until  eight  months  later  unless  he
pleaded guilty. (Tr. 57-58) In June 2017, he pleaded guilty, was convicted of driving under
the influence of drugs, and was sentenced to eight days in jail and community service.
He was placed on probation for 60 months. For the marijuana possession, he was fined
$1,200 and placed on probation for 12 months. For tampering with evidence, he was fined
$750 and placed on probation for 12 months. (GX 7 at 9; GX 9)
In  January 2019, Applicant failed  to  report to  his probation  officer as  required. (GX
10) At  the  hearing, he  testified  that  he  failed  to  report because  he  was unsuccessful in
trying  to  contact the  new probation  officer who  was assigned  to  his case. (Tr. 60-61) The
probation  officer’s affidavit, dated  January 24,  2019, recited  that the  probation  officer had
called Applicant at least twice at a telephone  number that is the same  telephone number
as Applicant  provided  in  his answer to  the  SOR. As of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant
had  not contacted  his probation  officer. As  a  result, the  running  of his time  on  probation
has been tolled  since January 24, 2019, and  he  is still on  probation. (Tr. 63)
At  the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  psychologist  in
October 2021. The psychologist concluded that Applicant “does not appear to have any
mental  health  conditions  that  would  negatively  impact  his  ability  or  willingness  to
safeguard  classified  information.”  However,  the  psychologist  also  noted  that  Applicant
“has personality  characteristics and  behavioral tendencies that  could negatively impact
his judgment and trustworthiness.” (GX 3 at 8)
When Applicant submitted his SCAs in December 2013 and September 2018, he
did not disclose that he used marijuana with varying frequency between 2012 and 2013.
(GX 1 at  30-31; GX 2 at 19) In his answer to the SOR amendment and at the hearing,
He admitted intentionally not disclosing it in both SCAs. He testified that a military recruiter
advised him not to disclose it. (Tr. 14, 67)
Applicant admitted that he did not disclose his arrest for assault and battery in his
September 2018 SCA, because he believed it was not reflected in his record. (Tr. 68) He
disclosed his arrest for DUI and stated that he was awaiting trial. He did not disclose that
he was also charged with possession of marijuana, was convicted and sentenced, and
that  he  was  on  probation.  When  he  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in
December  2018,  he  admitted  that  he  did  not  disclose  his  probation  because  he  was
concerned that it would affect his application for a security clearance. (GX 6 at 15) When
he  was  evaluated  by  a  psychologist  in  October  2021,  he  admitted  that  he  thought  he
might be able to get by with not disclosing his probation. (GX 3 at 5)
When  Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  May  2022,  he  disclosed
that he used marijuana a few times in 2017. He did not disclose that he used marijuana
in 2020. (GX 6 at 20) During his psychological evaluation, he disclosed that he last used
marijuana in 2020, and he confirmed that disclosure at the hearing. (GX 3 at 5; Tr. 66) At
the hearing, he testified that he did not know why he did not fully disclose his marijuana
use in 2020 but he “probably didn’t think about it too hard.” (Tr. 72)
Applicant’s spouse submitted a statement describing him as an exceptional father
and husband with unwavering commitment to the wellbeing of his family. (AX A) A friend
of Applicant for more than eight years describes him as a gifted manager who is forthright,
fair, discreet, and “supremely knowledgeable.” (AX B) A former shipmate describes him
as  a  hardworking,  self-driven,  and  effective  leader.  (AX  C)  A  joint  statement  from  14
sailors  with  ratings  and  ranks  ranging  from  petty  officer  second  class  to  lieutenant
describes Applicant as an outstanding sailor and lists his multiple accomplishments while
in  the  Navy.  (AX  D;  AX  E)  A  retired  sailor  who  has  known  Applicant  for  nine  years
describes him as very respectful of privacy, classified information, rules, and restrictions.
(AX F). A petty officer second class with nine years of Navy service admires Applicant for
his exemplary work ethic, innate generosity, steadfastness, and dependability. (AX G)

since  June  2012. He was unemployed  from  June  to  November 2014  when  he  left  a  job
by  mutual  agreement  after  he   was  accused   of  making   a   racial  comment  to   a   female
servicemember and  touching  her hair  without consent.  He served  on  active  duty  in the
U.S.  Navy  from   August  2004   to   May  2012   and   received   a   general  discharge   under
honorable conditions.
Applicant has never married. He  lived  with  a  cohabitant  from  November  2017  to
April 2020. Before they  separated, he  and  his cohabitant had  difficulties due  in part to
his sexually suggestive text message exchanges with five other women. (GX 12 at 2; Tr.
57) He has a  four-year-old son, and  he  shares custody of his son  with  his son’s mother,
his  former cohabitant. (Tr. 56)
Applicant received a security clearance in January 2006, while he was on active
duty in the Navy. His clearance was revalidated in 2013, while he was employed by a
defense contractor.
In  January  2002,  Applicant  was  charged  with  underage  possession  of  alcohol.
He  was  fined  and  his driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six  months.  (GX  1  at  43-44;
GX 13 at 2)
In  January  2003,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  reckless  driving  resulting  in  an
accident. (GX 11) The accident occurred when he drove too fast around a curve and hit
a  guardrail.  No  other  vehicles  were  involved.  He  had  not  been  consuming  alcohol
before driving. (Tr. 58)
In  August 2003, Applicant  was  convicted of  reckless  driving by  driving  92 miles
per  hour (mph)  in  a  55-mph  zone.  The  record  reflects  that  the  maximum  sentence  for
this offense was six months in jail, but it does not reflect the sentence that was imposed.
(GX 10)
In  December  2007,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  driving  under  the  influence  of
intoxicants  (DWI).  His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was  .24, well above the  legal limit.
He  was  fined  $350,  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six  months,  and  he  was
required to attend alcohol safety classes. (Tr. 59-60; GX 5 at 7-8)
In November 2009, Applicant was again convicted of DWI. He was sentenced to
jail  for  12  months  and  five  days,  all  of  which  was  suspended.  He  was  placed  on
unsupervised probation,  and his driver’s  license  was  suspended  for one  year. He  was
required to attend alcohol safety classes. (Tr. 60-61; GX 5 at 5)
In  October 2011, Applicant was charged  with  DWI,  2nd  offense  within five  years
and  refusal to  submit to  a breath  test.  He was convicted of DWI and  sentenced  to  jail for
12  months  and  five  days, with  11  months  and  15  days suspended.   His driver’s license
was suspended  for 36  months, and  he  was required  to  complete  alcohol safety classes.
(GX 5  at  5-6;  Tr. 62) Disposition  of  the  charge  of refusing  to  submit  to  a  breath  test  was
deferred and then dismissed in March 2013. (Tr. 66; GX 5  at 6)
While  Applicant  was  in  jail,  he  missed  the  sailing  of  his  ship,  and  he  received
nonjudicial  punishment  for  unauthorized  absence,  missing  movement,  and  violating  a
general  order  or  regulation.  (Tr.  64)  In  May  2012,  he  received  a  general  discharge
under honorable conditions, based on a pattern of misconduct. (GX 1 at 22)
While  Applicant  was  pending  discharge  from  the  Navy,  he  self-referred  to  the
Navy  Substance  Abuse  Rehabilitation  Program  (SARP)  and  completed  a  31-day
inpatient  rehabilitation  program.  His  alcohol  use  declined  after  he  completed  the
program. He stopped drinking between 2014 and 2016. (GX 3 at 4)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  job  for  making  a  racially
insensitive comment to a coworker, an enlisted woman in the Air Force. He considered
the coworker a good friend. While off-duty he offered his coworker a drink because he
had  two  drinks  in  front  of  him.  She  declined,  and  he  made  a  comment  that  she
interpreted  as  racial  profiling.  She  complained  to  their  supervisor,  and  he  was
terminated. Applicant disclosed this incident in his SCA as follows:
Formal  complaint  regarding  professionalism  was  submitted  by  Air  Force
member  against  me.  Terminated  by  company  without  being
fully
investigated. . . . Formal complaint stated I made racial comments towards
Air  Force  member  and  touched  her  hair  without  consent.  Air  Force
member  attempted  to  take  complaint  back  during  investigation  however
company found it easier to terminate than continue with investigation.
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  January  2021,  he
told the investigator that he offered his coworker a red fruit punch drink and, when she
declined,  he   told   her  that   everyone   loves  red   fruit  punch.   (GX  12   at  2).  He   told   the
investigator  that  he   was  called   into   his  manager’s  office  on   the   following   morning   and
told  that   he   was   terminated   effective   immediately.   He  told  the   investigator  that  his
employer  did   not  conduct  an   investigation   because   the   Air   Force   member  no   longer
worked   in  the   building.  However,  when   the   Air   Force  investigated   the   incident,   they
found   that  the   Air   Force   member’s  complaint  was  “incorrect.”  He   told  the   investigator
that  his   employer  later  determined   that  the   coworker’s  complaint   was  unfounded   and
offered   him   another  job   within  the   company,   but  he   no   longer  wanted   to   work  for  the
company.  (GX 12  at 2)  The  record  does not contain  any  documentation  of  the  complaint
against  Applicant,  the   investigation   of  that   complaint,  or   the   termination   of   Applicant’s
employment.
In August 2019, Applicant and his cohabitant hosted a joint birthday party for him
and  her  son,  which  was  attended  by  about  30  guests,  including  Applicant’s  neighbor
and his neighbor’s granddaughter. The party ended at about 2:00 am. Applicant testified
that  he  consumed  three  or  four  beers  during  the  day  but  did  not  believe  he  was
intoxicated. (Tr. 76)
Applicant  testified  that,  while  cleaning  up  after  the  party,  he  noticed  that  his
cohabitant’s son was not in his room, and he could not find him anywhere in the house.
He knew that some of the children who had attended the party were spending the night
in his neighbor’s house. He texted his neighbor, asking if his cohabitant’s son was at the
neighbor’s house. When the neighbor did not respond to the text, Applicant went to the
neighbor’s  house  and  knocked  on  the  door,  but  no  one  responded.  Applicant  then
entered the house through an unlocked back door and asked a friend of the cohabitant’s
son  if  he  was  in  the  house,  and  the  friend  stated  that  he  was  “in  the  back.”  Applicant
looked  in  one  bedroom,  but  the  cohabitant’s  son  was  not  there.  He  then  went  to  a
second bedroom and saw a person in bed who had blonde hair similar to the son’s hair.
He testified that he “just kind of peeked in,” “might have had one foot in the door to peek
around  the  door,”  and  softly  called  out  the  cohabitant’s  son’s  name.  The  neighbor’s
granddaughter, who was sleeping in the bed, was startled. He apologized and told the
granddaughter that he was looking for his cohabitant’s son, and she responded that the
son  was  “on  the  couch.”  (Tr.  42-43,  50)  He  found  his  cohabitant’s  son  under  some
blankets.  At  about  this  time,  the  neighbor  came  out  of  his  bedroom  and  confronted
Applicant. Applicant apologized, explained why he was there, and left.
The neighbor’s granddaughter called the police and told them that Applicant had
attempted  to  kiss her, caressed  her hips,  and  invited  her  to  “do  some  coke”  with  him.
The  granddaughter  also  told  the  police  that  Applicant  had  touched  her  breasts  during
the party on the previous day.
Applicant was charged with felony breaking and entering with intent to commit a
misdemeanor  and  sexual  battery.  He  was  represented  by  an  attorney  at  the  trial.
Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to trespassing and assault and battery,
both  misdemeanors.  He  was  sentenced  to  one  year  in  jail,  suspended  for  five  years,
conditioned on good behavior, completing a ten-week alcohol-abuse treatment program,
and having no contact with the victim or the victim’s family. He will be on probation until
November 2024. In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he admitted trespassing,
but he maintained that he was not guilty of the assault and battery and that he pleaded
guilty to avoid jail time.
Applicant’s neighbor testified  on  his behalf at the  hearing.  His neighbor testified
that  they  continued  to  have  casual  contact  with  each  other  after  the  August  2019
incident.  His  neighbor  also  testified  that  his  granddaughter  had  several  “traumatic
issues” in her life and that at the time of the incident, “she was seeking a lot of attention
and  known  to  tell  fibs.”  (Tr.  28)  He  stopped  short  of  testifying  that  his  granddaughter
was  lying,  but  said  that  he  was  skeptical  about  her  accusation  against  Applicant.  (Tr.
28-29, 33-34)
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  January  2021,  he
told  the  investigator  that  before  his  last  DUI,  he  drank  six  to  twelve  beers  about  four
times a  week,  but he stopped drinking for two  years beginning in 2014. At  the time of
the interview, he had resuming drinking. He told the investigator that he consumed two
or three beers about once a week, but that about once a year he drank about six beers
and became intoxicated. (GX 12 at 3)
In  November  2021,  Applicant  underwent  a  psychological  evaluation  at  the
request of the DOD CAF. The evaluation was conducted by video teleconference.  The
psychologist  noted  that  he  “presented  in  this  evaluation  with  a  moderately  antisocial
manner,” “appeared to minimize his responsibility in the problem situations described in
his  background  information,”  and  “blamed  others  in  instances  that  appeared  to  be
matters  of  his  own  lack  of  behavioral  control.”  The  psychologist  concluded  that
Applicant attempted to mislead him about the details of past events to cast himself in a
more positive light than may have been warranted by his actions.
Applicant  told  the  psychologist  that  he  suffered  an  estimated  20  instances  of
broken  bones  in  his  lifetime,  engaging  in  sky  diving,  riding  an  off-road  four-wheeler,
playing  basketball,  and  being  punched  in  the  face.  (GX  3  at  3)  At  the  hearing,  he
admitted that he has always been a high-energy, adventuresome person. (Tr. 51)
The  psychologist  found  that  if  Applicant  entered  his  neighbor’s  home  for  the
purpose  of  sexual  encounter  with  the  neighbor’s  granddaughter,  and  touched  her  and
confined  her  in  her  room  for  a  time,  particularly  if  he  was  intoxicated,  “then  this  act
would represent a nexus between his alcohol use problems, antisocial style, impulsivity,
and  stimulus  seeking  tendencies.”  He  diagnosed  Applicant  with  “alcohol-use  disorder,
severe,  in  sustained  remission  (by  subject  report).”  He  suggested  the  following  as
“diagnostic  possibilities,”  stopping  short  of  a
formal  diagnosis:  attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominately hyperactive/impulsive presentation;
and other specified personality disorder (with features of antisocial personality disorder).
The  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant’s  ADHD  symptoms  and  a  history  of
alcohol  use  did  not  present  a  significant  risk  to  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and
judgment,  but  that  “his  personality  condition  certainly  could  contribute  to  a  lack  of
trustworthiness
information.”  The  psychologist
concluded  that  Applicant’s  prognosis  “is  uncertain  given  that  he  did  not  seem  to  be
entirely forthright with [him].” (GX 3 at 9)
in  safeguarding  national  security
The  psychologist  listed  the  following  examples  of  inconsistencies  in  information
provided by Applicant that suggested a lack of candor:
•  Applicant told him that he could not remember when he last drank
more  than  three  beers,  but  he  told  an  investigator in  2021  that  he
drinks six or more beers and becomes intoxicated once a year.
•  Applicant used  the  term  “retired” to  describe  his departure from  the
Navy even though he  was discharged  for misconduct.
•  Applicant  said   that   he   “left”  a   job   in  2014   when   in  fact   he   was
terminated  because  of  a  racially related  comment, and  he  provided
an  exculpatory explanation  of the  event,  when  the  records reflected
that he “very likely” made racially offensive remarks.
•  Applicant pleaded guilty to a crime but told the psychologist that he
did not sexually assault the victim.
•  Applicant told him that he had consumed some alcohol but was not
intoxicated on the night of the alleged sexual assault in 2019.
The psychologist’s conclusion that Applicant was not “entirely forthright” appears
to  be  based  on  the  psychologist’s  conclusion  that  all  the  allegations  against  Applicant
probably  were  supported  by  the  evidence.  While  Applicant’s  guilty  pleas  at  his  trial
would justify a conclusion that he trespassed into his neighbor’s home and touched the
neighbor’s  granddaughter,  the  psychologist  apparently  believed  that  Applicant  groped
his neighbor’s granddaughter at the party, touched her inappropriately after he entered
his neighbor’s house, looking for his cohabitant’s son, and invited her to “do coke” with
him.  The  civil  authorities  did  not  charge  Applicant  with  groping  the  granddaughter  or
offering cocaine to her, and these acts were not alleged in the SOR.
The psychologist also appeared to believe that Applicant made an inappropriate
remark to a coworker that caused him to be fired.  The psychologist stated in his report
that  he  was  told  by  Applicant’s  mother  that  he  made  a  comment  such  as  “all  black
people like Kool-Aid.” (GX 3 at 3) There is no statement from Applicant’s mother in the
record.  There  is  no  record  of  the  investigation  of  the  complaint.  The  psychologist
determined  that  Applicant’s  description  of  what  he  said  to  a  coworker  was  untrue,
because  Applicant’s  mother  described  the  comment  differently.  It  is  not  clear  whether
the  psychologist  knew  that  the  complaint  was  investigated  and  determined  to  be
unfounded, or that he knew that Applicant’s employer offered to give him another job in
the company.
The  psychologist  also  concluded  that  Applicant  falsely  claimed  that  he  was  not
intoxicated on the night of the party, because Applicant admitted to his supervisor that
he  was  intoxicated.  The  psychologist’s  report  lists  a  document  from  Applicant’s
supervisor  as  one  of  the  documents  he  reviewed,  but  at  the  hearing,  Department
Counsel stated, “We weren’t able to  look at that report because  of our rules.” (Tr. 115)
The  security  investigator’s  report  does  not  include  a  statement  from  Applicant’s
employer.  There  is no documentary evidence  in  the  hearing  record  of  any  admissions
by  Applicant  to  his  supervisor  regarding  this  event,  and  no  evidence  from  other
witnesses that Applicant was intoxicated at the party.
Finally,  although  there  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  ever  was  involved  with
cocaine, the psychologist appears to have accepted the granddaughter’s assertions that
Applicant  touched  her inappropriately  and  offered  to  “do  some  coke”  with  her  as  true,
and  he  concluded  that  Applicant  was  not  being  truthful  with  him  when  he  denied  her
accusation.
Applicant  decided  to  stop  drinking  in  2022,  when  his  son  was  born.  His
cohabitant left him shortly after the birth, but they share custody of their son. (Tr. 56) He
testified that he last consumed alcohol on July 2, 2022. (Tr. 67) Applicant’s older brother
corroborated  his testimony about his decision  to  stop drinking and  the effect  it  had on
his behavior. (Tr. 98-100; 103-05)
Applicant is receiving counseling from a therapist once a week, and he receives
prescriptions from  a  nurse practitioner in the  counselor’s office.  (Tr. 72, 83) In a report
dated  August  8,  2022,  the  nurse  practitioner  stated  that  Applicant  had  abstained  from
alcohol  for  ten  weeks.  Applicant  receives  prescription  drugs  for  ADHD,  anxiety,
depressive  disorder,  and  panic  disorder.  (AX  J)  He  testified  that  he  stopped  taking
drugs  for  anxiety  and  panic  attacks  about  a  year  ago.  (Tr.  84)  Although  he  was
evaluated  for  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),  he  and  his  counselor  have
determined that he does not have PTSD. (Tr. 81, AX J
Applicant attends AA meetings once or twice a month, but he has not found the
“right group.” He testified that he has completed all of the 12-Step Program. (Tr. 74) He
sees a therapist regularly, and he realizes the negative effect of alcohol on his life. (Tr.
71-72)
Applicant  has  become  more  active  in  his  community  and  has  started  coaching
baseball. He testified, “I’m trying to be a person that I should have been a long time ago,
and it just took me way too long to get here.” (Tr. 72)
Applicant testified that he started having panic attacks in July 2022. He and his
cohabitant  had  started  seeing  each  other  again,  but  when  he  returned  from  a  30-day
deployment, he learned that she was seeing someone else and he was no longer part
of  her  life,  even  though  they  had  three  children  together. (Tr.  79)  He  admitted  that  he
still  suffers  from  panic  attacks  and  depression,  which  he  attributed  to  abstaining  from
alcohol.  He testified, “It's definitely a little harder when you have to face things  face to
face and not just hide them or drown them.” (Tr. 51)
A  friend  of  Applicant  who  has  known  him  for  ten  years  and  was  at  the  party  in
August  2019  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  good  character.  The  friend  also
stated that he did not observe any inappropriate interaction between Applicant and the
neighbor’s granddaughter. (AX G)
Applicant’s
father,  a  retired  Navy  petty  officer,
that  Applicant
meticulously  complied  with  the  revocation  of  his  driver’s  license.  Applicant’s  father,
mother, sister, and some friends drove him to and from work each day. (Tr. 91-92) His
father is proud of the progress he has made in turning his life around. (Tr. 89)
testified
A  Navy  commander  serving  as  the  combat  systems  officer  on  a  U.S.  Navy
combatant  ship,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  three  years  and  served  with  him  on
multiple  ships,  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  skill  as  a  fleet  systems  engineer
and his personal trustworthiness and integrity. She has observed Applicant’s change in
behavior during the past year. She states, “[Applicant’s] mindset has shifted away from
destructive  thought  and  behaviors  and  has  been  laser  focused  on  good  decisions,
personal growth, and impacting others by sharing wisdom he has gained on his journey
and providing motivation through all circumstances.” (AX I at 1)
A  retired  master  chief  petty  officer  who  has  known  and  served  with  Applicant
since  2020  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  technical  expertise,  dedication,
honesty, and integrity. (AX I at 2) An active-duty lieutenant commander who has known
Applicant since August 2022 describes him as a loving and doting father, who is full of
life,  energy,  and  positivity.  (AX  I  at  4)  An  active-duty  chief  petty  officer  has  watched
Applicant make  significant changes in his lifestyle and become a great father and  role
model  for  his  son  and  an  exceptionally  skilled  fleet  engineer.  (AX  I  at  3)  A  former
shipmate  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2006  believes  that  he  has  overcome  his
“personal  demons”  and  “found  love,  purpose,  and  a  peace  that  .  .  .  that  has  forever
changed  him.” He  states  that  Applicant  is  now “patient,  more  measured  when  speaks,
and  most importantly, he  thinks before [he] acts.” (AX  I at 5) A  neighbor for  two years
who has known Applicant for seven years describes him as “very dependable, selfless,
giving, trustworthy, and a joy to be around.” (AX I at 6)
The parents of Applicant’s former cohabitant are both retired sailors. Her mother
is  a  retired  Navy  limited-duty  lieutenant  with  20  years  of  service,  and  her  father  is  a
retired  senior  chief  petty  officer  with  26  years  of  service.  They  consider  Applicant  a
devoted  father  to  his  own  biological  child  as  well  as  two  of  his  former  cohabitant’s
children, treating them as his own. They have remained in contact with Applicant after
he  and  cohabitant  separated,  and  they  have  the  “utmost  respect”  for  him  and  are
confident that he has turned his life around. (AX I at 7)

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations and
clarifications,  except  for  SOR  ¶  1.d.  The  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  60  years  old.  He  married  in  January  1994  and  divorced  in  August
2017  (he  and  his  wife  were  separated  at  various  times  between  2013  and  2017).  He
and his wife adopted two daughters who are now ages 24 and 21. The oldest daughter
(D1)  has  special  needs  and  is  unable  to  live  independently.  Applicant  provides  her
approximately  $1,200  in  monthly  support  payments.  Applicant’s  ex-wife  is  D1’s  legal
guardian  and  custodian.  Applicant  was  granted  weekend  visitation  privileges  and  D1
spends the weekends with him. (Tr. 53-55, 65-66, 87; GE 1)
Applicant  holds  a  master’s  degree.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a
federal  contractor,  for  five  years.  He  is  a  senior  software  engineer.  He  has  previously
worked  for  federal  contractors,  including  his  current  employer.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since 1996. (Tr. 54-55; GE 1)
Under  Guideline  I,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant: (1) in  about 2002, was treated  by
Dr.  R,   who   diagnosed   him   with   depression   and   prescribed   antidepressant  medication;
(2) in  June   2013,  attempted   suicide   by  using   a   pressurized   nail   gun;  (3)  in  May  2017,
ceased  taking  his prescribed  antidepressant medication, without medical authorization,
and   thereafter  experienced   suicide   ideations   involving   use   of  a   nail   gun;  and   in  June
2021,  was  evaluated   by   a   licensed   psychologist  who   diagnosed   him   with   Major
Depressive  Disorder, recurrent, and  Autism Spectrum  Disorder, mild, without  intellectual
impairment. The  psychologist  opined  that  Applicant  exercised  questionable or impaired
judgment  when   in   an   emotionally  charged   social  and   interpersonal  situation.  (SOR  ¶¶
1.a  - 1.d)
Under Guideline  K,  the  SOR alleged  five  separate  security infractions  as follows:
(1)   in  May  2009   and   (2)   in  June   2015,  Applicant  brought  a   personal  cell   phone   into   a
secured  area; (3)  in May 2016, he  failed  to  properly log-off  of  a  classified  computer  in a
secured  area; (4) between  March  2018  and  December 2018, he brought unauthorized
electronic  devices  into a  secured  area  on  four separate occasions;  and (5) in  October
2019, he failed to properly secure a closed area. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a - 2.e)
Under Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  in  June  2014,  Applicant  was  involved  in  a
domestic  issue  where  the  police  became  involved  when  there  was  physical  contact
between Applicant and his wife; in June 2015,  Applicant was questioned by the police
about  stalking  a  member  of  his  medical  care  team;  and  in  October  2016,  he  was
arrested  and  charged  with  assaulting  his  wife  and  committing  child  abuse  on  his
daughter. All the  allegations  listed under  Guidelines  I  and  K  were-cross  alleged  under
Guideline E. (SOR ¶¶ 3.a - 3.e)
Psychological Conditions.
Applicant admitted being diagnosed in 2002 with depression. He was prescribed
antidepressant medication by a doctor. During his June 2021, mental health evaluation
conducted  by  Dr.  N,  at  the  request  of  the  DOD,  he  indicated  he  was  prescribed
medication for depression as early as 1985 or 1986. (Tr. 59-60; GE 4)
Applicant attempted to commit suicide in 2013 after he had been diagnosed with
cancer in 2010 and believed he only had a few years to live. He explained that he was
concerned  about  his  family  and  thought  that  a  $350,000  life  insurance  policy,  which
expired in a few days, could provide financial support for his family upon his death. He
used a pressured nail gun in this instance. He further stated that his equipment failed.
He testified that he never actually pointed the gun at himself, but he thought about doing
so. In his September 2013 security clearance application (SCA), he used the words “my
failed suicide attempt” to describe his actions that day. (Tr. 60-61, 89-90; GE 3)
During  his  December  2017  background  interview,  Applicant  admitted  to  having
suicidal ideations using his nail gun. He was concerned enough about his thoughts that
he gave the nail gun to a friend to hold for him.  In his interview, he stated that he had
these thoughts because he had stopped taking his medication. He did so by not getting
his  prescriptions  refilled.  He  was  consciously  trying  to  see  how  he  could  get  along
without the medication.  During his testimony, he  claimed that his medication stoppage
was due to a mix-up by his insurance company. He stated this one-month stoppage was
unintentional  by  him.  Applicant  believes  these  circumstances  occurred  in  2018,  as
opposed to May 2017, as alleged in the SOR. His belief is based upon an email he sent
to his employer advising that he had called a suicide prevention hotline. He continues to
take the medications listed in AE S. (Tr. 61-64; GE 7; AE S-T)
In   June   2021,  Applicant  was  evaluated   by  a   licensed   psychologist,  Dr.  N,  who
was  approved   by   the   DOD.  For  his  assessment,   Dr.  N   reviewed   Applicant’s   record,
conducted  testing,  and  performed  a  two-hour  clinical interview  with  Applicant. Applicant
told  Dr.  N  of  his  2013   aborted   suicide   attempt.  He  also  described   his  2017   suicidal
ideations  when he  intentionally went off  his antidepressant medication.  Applicant denied
any current suicidal ideations or depressive symptoms.  Dr. N diagnosed  Applicant using
the   Diagnostic  and   Statistical   Manual   of  Mental  Disorders,  5th  edition   (DSM-5)  with
“Major  Depressive  Disorder,  recurrent”;  “Autism  Spectrum  Disorder,  mild,  without
accompanying  intellectual  impairment.”  Dr.  N  concluded  absent  effective  therapy,  it
would  be  reasonable  to  expect  that  Applicant  might  demonstrate  impaired  judgment
when  his  emotions  run  high  in  the  future,  as  has  occurred  in  the  past  in  social  and
interpersonal  situations.  Applicant  last  saw  a  counselor  in  2019  for  approximately  two
months when he was going through the guardianship issue with his ex-wife. Dr. N gave
Applicant a “fair” prognosis. (Tr. 67, 112-113, 118; GE 4)
In December 2021, Applicant participated in and paid for a second psychological
evaluation. This evaluation was conduct by Dr. B, a licensed psychologist. There is no
evidence  to  indicate  whether  Dr.  B  was  “acceptable  to  and  approved  by  the  U.S.
Government.”  Dr.  B  conducted  a  clinical  interview  with  Applicant,  put  him  through  a
series of tests, and conducted a chart review. Applicant reported current difficulties with
anger  and  irritability.  This  anger  is  directed  at  others.  Dr.  B  diagnosed  Applicant  with
Persistent  Depressive  Disorder,  Social  Anxiety  Disorder,  and  Complex  Trauma  (by
history). Dr. B encouraged Applicant to consider counseling services, which would help
the re-orientation of depression, self-esteem issues, and functional difficulties. Dr. B did
not  offer  a  prognosis  for  Applicant.  In  April  2023,  Dr.  B  supplemented  her  earlier
assessment by clarifying that while Applicant could benefit from life skills coaching and
ongoing executive function, it was not a “necessity” for him to do so. (Tr. 68; AE I, X)
Protected Information.
Applicant  admitted  that  between  2009  and  2019,  he  committed  eight  different
security  violations.  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.b,  2.d) Six  of  the  violations  involved  similar  conduct
when  he  inadvertently  took  his  cell  phone,  or  similar  electronic  device,  into  a  secure
area  without  proper  authorization  in  2009,  2015,  and  four  times  between  March  and
December  2018.  The  violations  did  not  involve  disclosure  of  classified  information.
Applicant  self-reported  all  these  violations.  He  received  retraining  after  the  violations.
After  the  last  2018  violation,  he  was  given  a  written  warning  that  additional  violations
could result in disciplinary action. (Tr. 68, 71; GE 6; SOR answer; AE U)
The two remaining security violations occurred when Applicant failed to properly
log-off  a  classified  computer  in  May  2016.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  distracted
away  from  the  logged-in  computer  and  forgot  to  come  back  to  log-out.  This  was  an
inadvertent  violation  and  no  spillage  occurred.  In  October  2019,  Applicant  was
responsible  for  securing  a  closed  lab  area.  He  set  the  alarm  but  failed  to  properly
secure  the  door.  He  told  a  background  investigator  that  he  must  have  “spaced  out”
securing the door. This violation was discovered by security personnel. He has not had
another security incident since the one in October 2019. (Tr. 68, 74, 114; GE 7 (p. 20);
SOR answer; AE U)
Applicant  explained  that  his  behavior  that  resulted  in  these  eight  security
incidents was heavily influenced by various distractions going on in his personal life at
the  time.  These  distractions  included  his divorce  proceedings,  which  initially  started  in
2013,  but  were  protracted,  and  ended  in  his  final  divorce  in  September  2017.
Additionally, he was involved in a contentious guardianship battle with  his ex-wife over
physical  custody  of  his  adult  special-needs  daughter.  He  sought  the  services  of  a
counselor  when  he  was  going  through  the  guardianship  process.  The  guardianship
action began sometime in 2019 and ended with a judge’s order naming Applicant’s ex-
wife the primary legal guardian for their daughter in February 2020. He testified that he
does  not  have  these  distractions  present  in  his  life  now  and  is  confident  that  future
security incidents will not occur. (Tr. 75, 115-116, 118)
Personal Conduct.
SOR  ¶¶  3.a-3.b  cross-allege  conduct  also  alleged  under  the  psychological
conditions  and  handling  protected  information  guidelines.  The  facts  involving  those
allegations are stated above and will not be repeated here.
Applicant admitted that the police were called to his home in June 2014. He was
not  arrested  and  no  charges  resulted.  He  was  brushing  D1’s  teeth  when  he  and  his
then-wife  got  into  an  argument.  He  claims  that  she  slapped  him  and  he  pushed  her
down.  He  made  sure  he  protected  her  landing  using  his  hands  and  body.  (Tr.  75-77,
SOR answer)
In   June   2015,  Applicant  was  questioned   by   the   police   looking   into   a   complaint
that   he   was  stalking   or  harassing   a   hospital   staff   member   who   had   previously  treated
him. Applicant admitted  this happened. He  received  treatment at a  local hospital in June
2015  and  noticed  one  of the  female  treatment team  members.  He decided  he  wanted  to
talk with   her and   possibly   have   coffee   or lunch   with   her.  He   did   not  approach  her   that
day. A  few days later, he  returned  to  the  hospital with  the  intent  to  talk  with  this woman.
After waiting  for about   an   hour, he   was  approached   by a   nurse   seeking   to   assist  him.
He   explained   he   wanted   to   talk   to   the   female.   The   nurse  explained   that  the   other
woman   was  happily  married   and   Applicant   left  the   hospital.  Sometime   later,  he   wrote
the  woman  a  letter where he  expressed  his  feelings  for  her  and  explained  that  he  was  in
a  loveless marriage. He delivered  it to  the  hospital and  left.  A  few days later he  received
a  call  from  a  police  officer. The  officer explained  the  law regarding  stalking  and  warned
him  from  contacting the  women again. After a  few more days,  Applicant decided  to  write
the  women  an  apology  letter. He met  with  the  police  officer again and  the  officer refused
to  take  the  women  his  apology letter and  advised  him  not to  send  it. The  woman  sent
Applicant a  text  and  in  no  uncertain  terms told  him  that  she  never wanted  to  see  or  hear
from  him  again.  Since  that time, there has been  no  further interaction  with  her. (Tr. 77-
78, 98; GE 7  (  pp. 16-17))
Applicant admitted that in October 2016, he was  arrested for assaulting his wife
and committing child abuse-no injury toward his youngest daughter (D2). Applicant and
his then-wife got into an argument concerning a note he had written. She possessed the
note  in  her  hand  and  he  tried  to  wrestle  it  away.  He  eventually  bit  her  hand.  D2  was
present  during  this  altercation  and  called  the  police.  Applicant  was  arrested  and
charged  with  assault  and  non-injury  child  abuse  (because  D2  was  present  and
witnessed his assault). He pleaded guilty to a lesser assault charge and the remaining
charges  were  dropped.  His  sentence  included  12  months  of  unsupervised  probation,
mandatory attendance at 12 anger management classes, 8 parenting classes, fines and
fees.  He  completed  his  probation  requirements  without  any  violations.  He  has  had  no
other incidents involving his ex-wife or daughters. (Tr. 78-82, 104; GE 7 (pp. 9-10); AE
D)
Character Evidence/Performance Reviews.
Applicant  presented   the   testimony   of   two   witnesses   who   were  coworkers   (who
also  wrote   letters  of   support)  and   letters  of   support  from   two   of   his  sisters  and   one
additional  coworker.  One   coworker  and   former  supervisor  worked   with   Applicant   from
2019  to  2020. He is aware  of all  the  SOR allegations.  He held a  clearance  for 33  years
before he  retired  in 2021.  He  stated  that Applicant is a  very good  software  engineer. He
believes  that  the  security  incidents  were  minor and  Applicant  has learned  from  them  so
that  they  should   not   happen   in   the   future.  He  believes   Applicant  is  honest  and
trustworthy  and  has no  concerns with  him  possessing  a security  clearance.  (Tr. 16, 20-
25; AE E)
Applicant’s  second  witness  worked  with  Applicant  from  1997  to  2013.  He  has
held a clearance for 35 years. He is also a retired naval reserve officer. He is aware of
the SOR allegations. During his work experience with Applicant, he was professional in
his  job  performance,  very  intelligent,  and  always  protected  classified  information.  He
was  not  concerned  about  Applicant’s  past  security  infractions  because  he  was  going
through  personal  events  at  the  time  that  are  no  longer  present.  He  is  aware  that
Applicant’s  care  and  concern  for  D1  caused  additional  stress  in  his  life.  He  has  not
worked with Applicant since 2013. (Tr. 39-40, 43-47, 51; AE E)
Applicant’s  third  coworker wrote  that  during  the  time  they  worked  together from
2004 to 2007, Applicant had no security incidents. His two sisters wrote that Applicant is
very intelligent and honest. He has never revealed any work details to them. (AE E)
Applicant provided three years of his work performance appraisals (2020-2022).
In 2020, he was given an overall rating of “achieved/substantially achieved.” In 2021, his
supervisor noted that Applicant improved his relationships with coworkers and managed
his time better. In 2022, his supervisor noted that Applicant was directed to apologize to
a  team  member  for  comments  he  made.  His  supervisor  also  noted  his  concern  over
Applicant’s  “attitude  behavior.”  Applicant  was  also  asked  to  prioritize  his  life  situations
so outside pressures or situations are not projected into his work environment. (AE F)
Applicant  provided  information  about  coworkers’  positive  comments  during  his
current employment. He also provided information on other aspects of his personal life
reflected in many of his exhibits. (AE A, C, G, J-R, V-X)
",False
"Applicant admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a,  1.c, 2.a,  2.c, and  3.a. She  denied  SOR ¶¶  1.b  and
2.b.  After  a   thorough   and   careful  review   of  the   pleadings,  testimony,   and   exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. She earned some college credits but not a degree. She
married  in  2007  and  divorced  in  2010.  She  remarried  in  2012.  She  has  six  children
ranging from 20 years old to 5 years old. She has worked for a federal contractor since
2006 and has held a security clearance since then. (Tr. 33-37; GE 1)
Applicant testified that her family has a history of mental health issues. Due to the
stigma associated with mental illness in the past, she was raised by her family to deny
the issues if a problem existed because it was embarrassing and brought shame on the
family.  Applicant  testified  that  she  was  in  denial  for  years  about  her  mental  health
problems. (Tr. 38-39)
Applicant  testified  that  for  many  years  she  was  misdiagnosed  with  post-partum
depression.  She  believed  she  never was  properly  treated  for her more  serious mental
health issues because of the misdiagnosis and her state of denial. (Tr. 38-39)
Applicant  testified  that  she  began  consuming  alcohol  in  about  2002.  She  never
consumed alcohol while she was pregnant or breast feeding. In 2004, she was working
as  a  bartender  and  the  management  encouraged  the  bartenders to  let  customers buy
them drinks to increase business. She said she would often get drunk while working at
the bar. After she married in 2006, she moved to a new state with her husband, and she
did not consume alcohol because she was at home and did not socialize. Gradually she
made friends and became more social. She testified that she never felt like she needed
or craved alcohol but when she did drink,  she had no control and could not stop. She
found  her  body  reacted  differently  when  she  consumed  alcohol  than  it  does  for  other
people, in that instead of acting as a depressant, it energized her. (Tr. 45-49)
Applicant  testified  that  after  she  remarried,  she  and  her  husband  both  drank
alcohol, and it would fuel fights between them. In 2016, while talking on the phone with a
friend, she consumed a 750 ml bottle of rum. Her husband was in bed and got up and
confronted her. She was belligerent. She blacked out and does not recall what happened
but was told she was combatant with her husband and her father who had been contacted
and came to their house. (Tr. 39-41)
Applicant  was  taken  to  CC,  a  hospital,  and  was  admitted  to  the  behavioral  unit
where  she  stayed  for  three  days.  She  described  the  facility  as  horrible,  and  she  was
terrified while there. She was placed in a room with a woman who talked to herself and
was told that the woman was aggressive. Applicant testified she met with a psychiatrist
for five minutes. There was concern that because there were scratches on her wrists that
she had made a suicide attempt. The scratches were superficial. This was also fueled by
the  fact  that  her  husband  could  not  find  his  medication,  and  it  was  believed  she  had
consumed it. She denied she attempted to commit suicide. All of her toxicology tests were
negative,  and  her  husband  eventually  found  his  medication,  refuting  that  she  made  a
suicide attempt. (Tr. 39-41, 47; GE 3)
Applicant testified  that  her experience  with  the  medical personnel raised  concerns
about  the   quality  of  the   facility.  She   said   she   met  with   a  nurse  practitioner who   vaped
during  her  entire  interview. She  was  prescribed  Zoloft and  the  nurse  believed  because
Applicant had  a  busy  life  with  five  children  at  the  time  that  she  was  suffering  from  post-
partum   depression. Applicant   testified  that   she   believed   she   did   have   depression  after
her child  was  born,  but  it was  not  to  the  level of post-partum.  She also candidly  admitted
that she  was in denial on  acknowledging  she  had  other serious mental health  issues. She
met   with   a   psychiatrist  and   was  diagnosed   with   adjustment  disorder,  with   depressed
mood,  and  alcohol intoxication  delirium, with  mild  use  disorder. After  her release  from  the
unit,  she  felt good  but continued  to  consume  alcohol. She  did not believe  at that time  that
she  had  a  problem  with  alcohol. She  attributed  her diagnoses to  others who  believed  that
she   had   swallowed   pills,  despite   evidence   to   the   contrary. Applicant  continued   to   take
Zoloft which helped her.  (Tr 47-51)
Applicant became pregnant in 2017 and stopped drinking. She also discontinued
taking the Zoloft upon her obstetrician’s  recommendation. She did not consult with any
other doctors about the consequences of stopping Zoloft. Her son was born in July 2018
and Applicant nursed him until February 2019. She experienced stress due to the baby
having  some  special  medical  needs,  some  financial  issues,  and  she  was  not  on  any
medication. When she stopped breast-feeding, she started to drink alcohol again.  She
also explained after the lockdown due to the pandemic the children were all home, and it
was also more stressful. (Tr. 42-44, 57-60)
Applicant testified  that once  she  starts to  drink alcohol,  she  does not  have  control.
She   becomes  belligerent  and   argumentative.  From   February  2019   to   April  2020,   she
consumed  alcohol sporadically but when  she  did,  it was to  intoxication. Her husband  tried
to  limit her to  three  drinks,  but  she  said  she  threw the  restriction  back at  him because  he
consumed   alcohol  and   said  that  he   had   the   problem   with   alcohol  and   not  her.  She
admitted they were  both  in  denial regarding  their  problems  with  alcohol.  (Tr. 44-46, 60-
61)
In April 2020, Applicant and her family were celebrating her daughter’s  birthday.
Applicant was consuming alcohol. She was upset at her husband for spending money for
something  she  did  not  approve  of.  Later  in  the  evening,  she  and  her  husband  were
arguing. Applicant testified she blacked out and does not remember what happened. She
only knows what was told to her. She called the police and accused her husband of hitting
her  son,  which  was  not  true.  The  police  came,  and  her  husband  went  to  his mother’s
house. Her mother stayed with her and the children. Applicant went to take a shower and
her mother-in-law came over to the house to retrieve Applicant’s husband’s medication.
Because Applicant had been in the bathroom for a long time and was unresponsive, her
son  unlocked  the  door.  Applicant  was  on  the  floor  and  was  blue.  An  ambulance  was
called, and she was taken to the hospital and intubated. It was determined that she had
taken her husband’s entire prescription of Xanax and some hydrocodone that had been
prescribed to her after an operation. (Tr. 51, 61-64)
Applicant testified she woke up in the hospital a few days later unaware of what
had transpired or how long she had been in the hospital. She was then transferred to the
behavior wing at RL, a hospital. She met with a psychiatrist and a therapist for the three
days she was there. She discussed with the psychiatrist her family history and what had
happened. He explained to her that her condition was not temporary and would not go
away. He explained that they needed to fix her brain, and she would be on medication for
the rest of her life. He specifically said she was not suffering from post-partum depression.
Instead, he diagnosed her with Major Depressive Disorder. She was put back on Zoloft,
which has provided good results. She said she was sad and angry because she blamed
her family for teaching her to deny mental health issues and leave them untreated. She
explained that her grandmother had committed suicide and she later learned her aunt has
the same diagnoses as her. (Tr. 64-68, 89-90; GE 4; AE A, B, N)
Applicant recognizes that her use of alcohol exacerbated her other mental health
issues.  She  testified  that  her  current  diagnosis  is  Major  Depressive  Disorder  severe
without psychotic episodes and she is also being treated for Alcohol Use Disorder. The
psychiatrist at RL referred Applicant to her primary care doctor for medicine management
of her Zoloft dosage. Since April 2020, Applicant’s dosage has increased from 50mg to
100mg  and  in  late  2022  it  was  increased  again  to  150mg  when  Applicant  was
experiencing stress due to her security clearance being under review. The increases were
all under the care of her doctor. (Tr. 69-71, 91-92, 95-96; GE 4; AE B, N)
While at RL, Applicant also met with a psychologist and was to meet with her for a
year. She did not have a good rapport with her. She participated in talk therapy and initially
they met twice a week, then once a week, then bi-weekly. Applicant discontinued seeing
the psychologist because she did not find it helpful, and they would often sit together and
not talk. She stopped seeing the psychologist around June or July 2020. She continued
to take her medicine as prescribed. She admitted that she was not happy with the care
she  had  initially  received  at  CC  where  the  psychologist  was  affiliated  because  she
believed they mishandled her care. She tried to meet again with the psychiatrist from RL
who  diagnosed  her,  but  he  had  left  the  hospital’s  employment  and  she  was  unable  to
arrange an appointment. (Tr. 68-69, 71-74, 77, 92-94; GE 3, 4; AE A, B, N)
Before  being  discharged  from  RL,  Applicant  worked  on  a  recovery plan  with  the
psychiatrist and  his nurse.  Her family participated  in the  discussions regarding  support
through  a  virtual meeting  to  ensure everyone  was aware  of it. Almost immediately after
Applicant’s  discharge  from  RL, she  began  participating  in  “In  the  Room.” This is an  online
treatment program  that offers Alcoholics  Anonymous (AA) meetings  and  other activities
that  are always available. She  learned  about this group  while  at  RL.  Her recovery was
happening   during   the   pandemic,   so   the   use   of  online   groups  was   the   norm.  Also,   it
allowed  her flexibility to  seek a  meeting  when  it met her schedule as there are meetings
offered   every  two   hours.  The   AA   program   required   that  she   attend   meetings  for  90
consecutive   days.  AA   offered   meetings,   communicating   with   others,  reflections,   and
sponsors. There is also  a  subdivision  at  “In  the  Room”  that offers a  community for those
with  more than  one  diagnosis. The  group  is called  Dual Diagnoses. Applicant feels very
comfortable  participating  in  this community  because  it  is not just about  being addicted  to
alcohol   but also   addresses  other   mental health   diagnoses.   Applicant   works   on   the   12-
steps of AA  and  has a  sponsor. When  she  first started,  she  participated  more often  in the
group,  but the  frequency has been  reduced  now that her mental health  and  alcohol issues
are  under  control.  She   continues  to   participate   in   the   program.   She   continues  to   be
medication  compliant,  reads the  daily reflections from  the  group  and  posts her gratitudes
weekly. (Tr. 74-83, 94, 98; AE M)
Applicant  testified that she  has a robust support group. Her husband supports  her
sobriety.  After Applicant’s hospitalization, he  was in denial about his alcohol problem,  but
in about  June  2020,  he  recognized  that  he  too  is an  alcoholic. They support each  other.
There is no  alcohol in  the  house. Both  testified  that Applicant has  not consumed  alcohol
since   the   April 2020   incident  and  hospitalization.  Applicant’s  family  and   her   husband’s
family  live   close   by   and   are there   to   support   her. She   has   a   church   community and   is
involved  as a  girl scout  leader  with  her daughters. She  recognizes  triggers that  may raise
concerns  and  addresses them  immediately. Her husband  is  also  vigilant in  monitoring  her
moods and stresses. Although she is vigilant about taking her medication, he is mindful
of ensuring she does also. (Tr. 85-86)
Due to the stress associated with the retention of her security clearance, Applicant
went to see a therapist in August 2022 to help her. She participated in cognitive therapy
with him. He gave her the same diagnoses as noted above. He is a licensed clinical social
worker. She saw him until January 2023. (Tr. 84-85)
Applicant  reported  her  2016  hospitalization  incident  to  her  employer’s  facility
security  officer (FSO) but  was told  because it  was  due to post-partum depression  she
was not required to do so. She reported her April 2020 incident to her FSO. She admitted
that when she completed her security clearance application in March 2020, she did not
disclose alcohol or mental health issues because she was in denial. (Tr. 99-100; GE 2)
Applicant’s coworker for the past 13 years and friend testified on her behalf. She
is aware  of  Applicant’s mental health  hospitalizations and  addiction  to  alcohol. She  did
not  observe  Applicant  drink  alcohol  when  they  were  at  a  company  happy  hour.  She
described  Applicant  as  reliable,  trustworthy,  dependable,  always  willing  to  help,  and  a
vital member of the team. (Tr. 105-109)
Applicant’s  sister-in-law  testified.  She  was  aware  that  in  the  past  Applicant  was
diagnosed  with  post-partum  depression.  Since  April  2020  she  has  never  observed
Applicant consume alcohol. She is available, as is her whole family that lives very close,
to  provide  any  support  Applicant  may  need.  She  has  noticed  a  change  in  Applicant’s
behavior  since  she  has  abstained  from  alcohol  consumption.  Applicant  is  calm  and
organized.  She  describes  Applicant  as  a  loving  mother,  daughter,  and  aunt.  She  has
found new hobbies and is very involved in girl scouts with her daughters, is a homeroom
parent, gardens, and is enrolled in college. (Tr. 109-115)
Applicant’s  husband  testified  and  acknowledged  that  since  both  have  stopped
consuming  alcohol,  their  marriage  and  life  has  improved.  He  described  himself  as  a
recovering alcoholic. He is aware that his wife recognizes her triggers that may impact
her mental health. He believes the last alcohol episode in April 2020, where she almost
died, scared her about what could have happened. She is managing her mental health
through medication. She has constant family support, and they support each other. (Tr.
115-122)
Applicant provided her excellent performance evaluations and performance goals
from her employer. She is committed to her sobriety and mental health. She intends to
remain  vigilant  in  taking  her  prescribed  medication  and  recognizing  triggers  that  may
impact  her  mental  health.  She  admits  she  is  a  recovering  alcoholic.  She  has  not
consumed alcohol since April 2020 and does not intend to ever again. She understands
that she will remain on medication for her mental health for the rest of her life. (AE C, D,

"Applicant  is  41  years  old  and  married  with  two  children.  He  has  a  bachelor’s
degree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor (Company A) since March
2020 as a release engineer and is attempting to obtain a security clearance in relation to
his employment. (Tr. 35-36; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17; Applicant
Exhibit A.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he abuses intoxicants to excess. He denied both allegations in this paragraph
with explanations.
Applicant has worked consistently as a software engineer since graduating from
college in 2006. He worked for Company B, a major IT company, from February 2015 to
March  2020.  Up through  2017 his work was exemplary, and his evaluations  stated he
“meets  all  expectations.”  Beginning  in  2018,  however,  he  began  receiving  marginal
evaluations. He stated that at this point in time he began to use alcohol and marijuana to
cope  with  job  stress.  His  actions  did  not  relieve  the  job  stress.  By  early  2019  he  was
having  serious  emotional problems due to  job  and  home  stress, and  the  impact  of his
increased alcohol and marijuana use. This description of his use is attested to by both
Applicant and his wife. At this point he voluntarily took a 30-day leave of absence from
Company  B  to  attend  an  outpatient  treatment  program  for  a  stress-induced  mood
disorder, as well as alcohol and marijuana use. While worthwhile, he did not feel that he
had  received  sufficient  treatment  to  resolve  his  issues.  Accordingly,  he  received  an
additional 60 days of outpatient treatment. He feels that the treatment was successful.
(Tr. 16-18, 22. 28-30, 37, 61, 73-74; Applicant Exhibit D.)
Soon  after  returning  to  Company  B  after  his  three-month  leave  of  absence
Applicant  received  a  job  offer  from  Company  A.  As  stated,  he  began  working  there  in
early 2020. He testified that he enjoys the work and finds it very fulfilling. His evaluations
at this job have been outstanding, according to his current and former supervisors.  (Tr.
75-88; Applicant Exhibit F at 1-2, 6.)
The programs Applicant attended recommended that he not drink alcohol. He did
not drink alcohol for several months after finishing his program. He eventually began to
drink  again and  continued to drink  some amount of alcohol several times a week until
November 2022. At that point he made the decision to stop drinking altogether and began
attending  a  recovery  program.  He  testified  that  the  program  is  assisting  him  in  his
recovery. (Tr. 18-19, 42-46, 62, 68-70; Applicant Exhibits J and K.)
Applicant continues to experience stress, even in the new job. He began seeing a
psychiatric nurse practitioner (PNP) in January 2022 due to depression and anxiety.  In
May  2022  the  therapist  reported,  “Patient  [Applicant]  states  that  he  stayed  sober  for
several days, but then would binge drink on a bottle of whiskey or pack of beer at a sitting.
Patient continues to report cravings for alcohol.”  (Tr. 63-65; Government Exhibit 4 at 4;
Applicant Exhibit I at 2.)
Applicant Exhibit I has additional treatment notes from September 2022 at page 2.
The PNP stated:
Patient [Applicant] remained on  Pristiq, no longer taking  naltrexone. States
that  it worked  well at  first, then  it  seemed  to  stop  working  for etoh  [alcohol]
cravings. Has had  some  nights  where he  drank more than  he  desired, but
not getting  overly intoxicated.  Feeling  much  better with  mood, denies any
down  days  like   he   used   to   have.   [Reports]   working   full   time,  busy  with
family. Some  anxiety with life stress –  able to tolerate.
Applicant testified  that  he  does not feel he  currently has a  problem  with  alcohol.
He further testified  that  he  never told the  therapist that he  engaged  in  binge drinking. He
admitted  drinking  a  fifth  of whiskey  within  three  days.  He  did  make  an  arrangement  with
his wife  that she  would  tell  him  if she  felt that he  was drinking  too much. She  did tell  him
several times  about excessive drinking  last  year up  to  about  August  2022. (Tr. 23-26,  44-
45, 47-48, 66-68, 70-71.)
Applicant received  an  evaluation  from  a  DoD  psychological  consultant  (Dr. One).
His report is dated  July 6, 2022,  and  is Government Exhibit 3.  (Tr. 46-47.)  That report
stated the following:
DIAGNOSTIC  IMPRESSION:   The   Subject   [Applicant]   was  referred   for
evaluation  to  determine  if he  meets criteria  for any condition  which  would
jeopardize   his   judgment,   reliability,  or  trustworthiness.   Specifically,  his
history  of  marijuana   and   alcohol  use   was  of  concern.  Based   upon   the
increased  frequency and  amount used  prior to  his voluntary admission  to
treatment,  the  Subject likely met criteria  for an  alcohol use  disorder and  a
cannabis use  disorder.  He currently does  not appear to  meet criteria  for the
marijuana  use  disorder  since  his reported  abstinence  during  the  application
process  for  his  current  position   in  early  2020.  However,  according   to   his
current medical records, Subject  continues to  suffer from  alcohol cravings
and  engages in binge  drinking  to  cope  with  work stress despite  his stated
desire  to  be  sober. Personal restraint has not appeared  to  be sufficient to
curb  his  consumption   behaviors  and   he   was  most  recently  prescribed
Naltroxone  to  mitigate  cravings. As such, it appears that the  diagnosis of
alcohol use  disorder is  still  current and  applicable to  the  Subject’s profile.
The   diagnoses  below   attempt  to   capture  the   Subject’s  present  level  of
functioning.
DIAGNOSIS:
Alcohol use disorder, moderate
Unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress
Cannabis use disorder, moderate, in sustained remission
(F10.20)
(F32.9)
(F12.20)
PROGNOSIS: The Subject’s prior history of alcohol and marijuana use and
subsequent  treatment  raised  concerns  over  the  Subject’s  ability  to  have
good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Having an active diagnosis
of either would bring inherent risk to those factors. The evaluation did not
reveal that the Subject is suffering from any ongoing marijuana use. If his
reporting of abstinence is accurate, then it is not likely a risk factor and can
be dismissed as a matter of consideration. However, the information from
his  current  prescriber  indicated  that  he  still  struggles  with  binge  drinking,
cravings, and has difficulty staying sober. His consumption appears to be
for similar reasons now as it was when he submitted himself for voluntary
treatment  (ie.  [sic]  work  reviews).  This  information  indicates  that  the
Subject’s  alcohol  use  disorder  is  current,  without  a  sustained  period  of
abstinence,  and  therefore  represents  an  inherent  risk  to  his  judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness.
Applicant was  also  evaluated  by a  psychologist  (Dr. Two), who  was  retained  by
Applicant.  (Tr. 48-49.)  He  submitted  a  report dated  December 5, 2022. (Applicant Exhibit
E.)  That  report stated:
Conclusion:
[Applicant] has enjoyed mild to moderate drinking of beer and whiskey for
much of his adult life. It became a problem for him three years ago, when
his drinking increased, and combined with cannabis use, sleep deprivation
(due  to  his  youngest  child  having  sleep  problems  and  requiring  care  at
night)  and  stress  at  work,  he  developed  a  mood  disorder  for  which  he
sought  and  received  successful  treatment.  It  is  unlikely  that  this  mood
disorder (Substance Induced Mood Disorder) will reoccur. He sleeps well,
his  child  is  doing  well,  he  no  longer  smokes  marijuana,  and  his  work
situation has dramatically improved.
Treatment  three  years  ago  was  successful.  He  has  learned  to  maintain
regular mild to moderate use of alcohol. He currently drinks mildly, between
one and three times a week, on or two drinks on each occasion. To have a
diagnosed  alcohol  condition,  a  person  must  meet  at  last  two  of  eleven
criteria  over the  last twelve  months.  The  only sign  that  [Applicant] shows
are occasional cravings, his drinking has never affected any important life
functions,  and  he  has  never  developed  tolerance  or  suffered  withdrawal
symptoms.  Mild  to  moderate  alcohol  consumption,  without  any  other
challenges, is not an alcohol problem and does not cause other difficulties.
Dr. Two submitted an Addendum dated January 20, 2023. (Applicant Exhibit G.)
It states:
I would like to clarify that I reviewed that entire record, including notes from
[PNP]  [Applicant  Exhibit  I).  In  February 2022,  she  noted  that  alcohol use
was  not  affecting  any  significant  life  function.  In  May  2022,  she  noted
increased alcohol use, that again did not affect work or any other important
life functions. This does not qualify as a disorder. At this time, she also used
the term binge drink, which is incorrect, as [Applicant] emphatically states
that this was incorrect, that he would not drink an entire bottle in one sitting,
but over the course of several days. In September 2022, she also reported
some  alcohol  use,  again  not  affecting  work,  relationships  or  any  other
important  life  skill.  Throughout  her  record,  she  reports  that  medication
helped him maintain his mood. I stand by my impression that he has never
qualified  as  having  an  alcohol  disorder  based  on  the  DSM  5  definition.
Though he drinks sometimes to excess, this is at home, not at work, does
not  affect  his  relationships,  work  or  any  other  life  function,  he  is  not
dependent, has never developed withdrawal symptoms, has never missed
work due to alcohol use, does not currently experience cravings.
Paragraph 2 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions)
The DoD CAF alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is not eligible
for access because he has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair
his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. He denied SOR 2.a. He admitted in part and
denied in part SOR 2.b. He denied SOR 2.c.
SOR paragraph 2.a. references Applicant’s receiving mental health treatment as
part of the factual statement.  Paragraph 27 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which
sets forth the concern under this guideline, states in pertinent part, “No negative inference
concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental
health  counseling.”  In  addition,  the  Defense  Counterintelligence  and  Security  Agency
factsheet, “Mental Health and Security Clearances,” states in part, “Seeking mental health
services does not affect one’s ability to gain or hold security eligibility. Adjudicators regard
seeking necessary mental health treatment as a positive step in the security clearance
process.” (Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Mental Health and Security
Clearances, https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/91/Documents/  pv/DODCAF/resources/DCSA-
FactSheet  Mental-Health  SecurityClearances-Oct21.pdf
(accessed  September  5,
2023.)
2.a.  There  is  little  to  no  support  for  the  allegation  that  Applicant  has  been
diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The only evidence is an affirmative statement by him in
answer to Section 21 “Psychological and Emotional Health” on Government Exhibit 1 that
asked whether he had “EVER been diagnosed by a physician . . . with . . . bipolar mood
disorder.” He stated that he answered the question this way because of a statement made
to him by one of his therapists during his first 30-day outpatient treatment that some of
his conduct could indicate a bipolar disorder. However, there is no diagnosis of bipolar
disorder found anywhere in the available medical records. He testified that both Dr. One
and  Dr.  Two  stated  they  did  not  believe  Applicant  suffered  from  a  bipolar  disorder.
(Government Exhibit 1; Tr. 20, 49-52.)
2.b. Applicant admitted, and the available medical records confirm, that he suffers
from depression and anxiety. He is receiving therapy for it, and is also on medication. He
further stated that therapy and medication are helping control his depression and anxiety.
He  is  also  attempting to  obtain  additional  individual  therapy  with  a  psychologist.  He  is
currently on a waitlist for this provider. (Tr. 52-56; Government Exhibits 3 and 4; Applicant
Exhibits I and L.)
2.c. The Government alleged that Doctor One’s diagnosis of Applicant as currently
suffering from Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate, is cognizable under this guideline as well.
Applicant denied this allegation.
Mitigation
Applicant has been a successful employee at Company A. His current supervisor
testified  and  supplied  a  letter  on  his  behalf.  He  has  known  Applicant  since  2015  at
Company A and Company B, and has been his supervisor at both companies for more
than three years. He described Applicant as a “great” employee. He further testified that
he has not seen any evidence of alcohol or mental health issues with Applicant. He further
stated that he has entrusted Applicant with large projects and stated he trusts Applicant
not to reveal classified or proprietary data. (Tr. 77-88; Applicant Exhibit F at 6.)
Another supervisor of Applicant’s at both Company A and Company B submitted
a  very  laudatory  letter  on  his  behalf.  He  described  Applicant  as  having  “the  highest
integrity.” (Applicant Exhibit F at 1-2.)
Peer  feedback  from  fellow  employees  of  Company  A  in  2022  was  extremely
favorable. (Tr. 56-59; Applicant Exhibit B.)
",False
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted part of SOR ¶ 1.a; and he admitted SOR
¶¶ 2.b through 2.j and 3.a through 3.d. (HE 3) He denied part of SOR ¶ 1.a; and he denied
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 2.k. He did not admit or deny SOR ¶ 2.a. He also provided mitigating
information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  information  technology  specialist.  (Tr.  6,  9)  He  has
worked for his current employer for about one year. (Tr. 9) In 1996, he graduated from
high school. (Tr. 6) In 2003, he received an associate degree in computer networking.
(Tr. 7) He was married from 2008 to 2017. (Tr. 7, 24) His children are ages 9 and 11, and
he is current on his $738 monthly child support. (Tr. 8) He has never served in the military.
(Tr. 8) There is no evidence of criminal offenses, drug abuse, or security violations.
Alcohol Consumption and Psychological Conditions
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  on  February  1,  2022,  a  psychologist,  Dr.  G,  interviewed
Applicant, reviewed his medical records, and diagnosed him with Alcohol Use Disorder,
Anxiety Disorder, unspecified, and Depressive Disorder, unspecified. He said Applicant
was defensive about his alcohol consumption, and he concluded Applicant exhibits issues
with  reliability  and  trustworthiness  which  may  impair  his  ability  to  protect  classified
information. Dr. G’s evaluation  referenced a March 2017 treatment note, which states,
“His history of drinking included one pint of vodka daily or more for nine years. He had a
history of blackouts. His longest period of sobriety was seven days in 2016 due to pain in
the  abdomen.”  (GE  2  at  4)  Dr.  G  concluded  that  his  mental-health  conditions  pose  a
significant risk to his judgment and stability in the future unless he obtains treatment and
maintains sobriety.
Applicant’s first panic attack occurred  around  2000  when  he  was about 22  years
old.   (Tr.  25)  He  has  received   medication   for  anxiety  since   2006.  (Tr.  26)  He  said  he
consistently takes his anxiety medication, and  it has helped  him  “tremendously.” (Tr. 26)
He disagreed with Dr. G’s diagnosis of Depressive Disorder. (Tr. 26) He described himself
as a “very happy go lucky person.” (Tr. 27)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  on  or  about  February  22,  2017,  Applicant  was  admitted  for
inpatient treatment after consuming about 200 tablets of the prescription drug Xanax and
one pint of vodka in an attempted suicide. In his SOR response, he denied SOR ¶ 1.b,
and he said he did not intend to commit suicide or take 200 Xanax tablets.
Applicant said  in February 2017, he  consumed  about a  pint of vodka, and  he  was
intoxicated.  (Tr. 30, 33)  He took  about  10,  .25  milligram  doses  of Xanax. (Tr. 30) Applicant
said he  did not remember why he  consumed  the  Xanax; however, he  was not attempting
suicide.  (Tr.  30)  He  said  an   emergency  room   (ER)   note   indicating   he   took  about  200
Xanax  tablets  is an exaggeration. (Tr. 31)  He  did not have  a  prescription for such  a large
amount of Xanax. (Tr. 31) He did not remember what he  said  in the  emergency room. (Tr.
31)  He  denied   that  he   would  have   knowingly  exaggerated   the   amount  of  Xanax  he
consumed, and  he  suggested  his former spouse  may have  told  someone  in  the  ER that
he  took 200  Xanax. (Tr. 32) He  denied  that he  ever experienced  suicidal ideations  or that
he   attempted   suicide.   (Tr.  32)  In   2017,  he   was  drinking   a   pint   of   vodka   about   twice   a
week.  (Tr.   33)   In   2017,   he   went   to   “rehab”  for   about  10   days,  and   to   Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) meetings for about a month.  (Tr. 40, 51, 52; GE  5 at 5)
SOR  ¶  2.a  cross  alleges  the  information  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  as  an  alcohol
consumption security concern. SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c allege, and Applicant admits that on
January 26, 2011, and on January 4, 2012, Dr. L diagnosed him with Alcohol Abuse, not
otherwise specified (NOS). (Tr. 35-36) When he first sought help, he was drinking four or
five days a week and about “a few glasses of wine [and] a half a pint of vodka.” (Tr. 36)
Applicant  said  on  January  4,  2012,  Dr.  L  advised  him  to  decrease  his  alcohol
consumption. (Tr. 37) She said he was supposed to “slow down at the very least” on his
alcohol consumption.  (Tr.  37)  Dr.  L  did  not  tell  him  to  abstain  completely from  alcohol
consumption. SOR ¶ 2.d alleges and Applicant admits that on August 28, 2012, he told
Dr.  L  that  he  continued  to  consume  alcohol,  and  Dr.  L  recommended  he  receive
substance abuse counseling. In August 2012, he was consuming a pint of alcohol four
times a week. (Tr. 38; GE 3 at 116) At his hearing, he said he did not remember that Dr.
L recommended that he obtain substance abuse counseling. (Tr. 37, 40) He was sober
for a while, and then he resumed his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 38) Sometimes he hid his
alcohol  consumption  from  his  spouse.  (Tr.  39-40;  GE  3  at  116)  He  did  not  remember
specific  information  about  his  level  of  alcohol  consumption  or  his  behavior  with  his
spouse. (Tr. 40) Dr. L. prescribed Campral for him; however, he did not continue taking it
because he was worried it would make him sick if he drank alcohol. (Tr. 41)
SOR ¶ 2.e alleges and Applicant admits that he received inpatient treatment from
October 14 to October 16, 2013, for renal colic and alcohol abuse. (SOR response) Upon
discharge  he  was  advised  to  cease  consuming  alcohol  due  to  potential  adverse
interactions with prescribed anxiety medication. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 2.f alleges and Applicant admits that on April 17, 2015, he told Dr. K that
he  had  alcoholism  for  10  years  and  experienced  marital  discord  due  to  alcohol
consumption.  (SOR  response)  Dr.  K  diagnosed  him  with  Alcohol  Abuse,  NOS,  and
encouraged him to join a substance abuse support group and advised to abstain from
further  alcohol  consumption.  (Id.)  At  his  hearing,  Applicant  said  he  did  not  remember
hiding his alcohol consumption from his spouse. (Tr. 42) He did not remember meeting
with Dr. K; however, he accepted that the meeting and diagnosis occurred because it is
in his medical record. (Tr. 42-43)
SOR ¶ 2.g alleges and Applicant admits that on March 31, 2016, he told Dr. F he
increased  his  alcohol  consumption.  (SOR  response)  He  drank  almost  every  day,  and
sometimes to intoxication. (Tr. 44) Dr. F diagnosed him with Alcohol Abuse, encouraged
him to join a substance abuse support group, and advised him to abstain from alcohol
consumption. (Tr. 44) He briefly stopped his alcohol consumption, and then, he resumed
his  alcohol  consumption.  (Tr.  44)  SOR  ¶  2.h  alleges  and  Applicant  admits  that  on
September  12,  2016,  Dr.  F  advised  him  to  abstain  from  alcohol  consumption.  (SOR
response) SOR ¶ 2.i alleges and Applicant admits that on September 19, 2017, he told
Dr. F he resumed his alcohol consumption after being hospitalized from October 14 to
October 16, 2013. (Id.) Dr. F diagnosed him with Alcohol Abuse, encouraged him to join
a substance abuse support group, and advised him to abstain from alcohol consumption.
(Tr. 45; SOR response)
SOR ¶ 2.j alleges and Applicant admits that on February 28, 2020, Dr. S diagnosed
him with Alcohol Abuse, Acute alcoholic gastritis without hemorrhage, and Hepatomegalia
(enlarged  liver),  likely  resulting  from  his  alcohol  consumption.  (Tr.  46;  SOR  response)
However,  at  his  hearing  Applicant  said  he  did  not  remember  the  Hepatomegalia
diagnosis, and recent tests showed his liver was normal. (Tr. 46) Dr. S encouraged him
to reduce his alcohol consumption and to join a substance abuse support group. He was
prescribed benzodiazepines to reduce withdrawal symptoms, until complete cessation.
At his hearing, he said he remembered being prescribed benzodiazepines; however, he
did not remember being advised to stop drinking alcohol. (Tr. 46)
In his SOR response, Applicant denied SOR ¶ 2.k, which alleges that he continued
to consume alcohol contrary to treatment recommendations described in SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.e,
2.f, 2.g, 2.h, 2.i, and 2.j, supra.  For SOR ¶ 2.c, Applicant said Dr. L recommended that
he reduce his alcohol consumption and not that he cease all alcohol consumption.  For
SOR ¶ 2.j he did not remember being advised to stop drinking alcohol.
From 1999 to about 2006, Applicant drank alcohol to help him cope with anxiety.
(Tr.  34)  He  received  medication  which  helped  with  his  anxiety.  (Tr.  34)  His  alcohol
consumption  gradually  increased,  and  it  peaked  around  2015  or  2016.  (Tr.  35)  He
stopped  drinking  alcohol  around  May  of  2021,  except  for  occasional  sips  from  other
people’s  drinks.  (Tr.  47,  49)  He  completely  stopped  drinking  alcohol  in  about  2021  or
2022.  (Tr.  49)  He  has  a  history  of  consumption  of  alcohol  contrary  to
the
recommendations  of  health  practitioners.  (Tr.  50)  He  does  not  attend  any  alcohol
counseling such as AA meetings. (Tr. 51) He relies on the support of family and friends.
(Tr. 51) He does not receive any mental-health counseling or treatment beyond renewal
of his prescriptions. (Tr. 54)
Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.d  allege  and  Applicant  admits  that  he  failed  to  disclose
information on his December 14, 2016 SCA about his mental-health and suggestions that
he receive alcohol counseling. The SCA asked him in the previous seven years: whether
he had consulted with a health-care professional regarding an emotional or mental-health
condition; and whether alcohol had a negative impact on his professional and personal
relationships. His SCA also asked whether he had: ever been ordered, advised, or asked
to seek counseling or treatment because of his use of alcohol; and ever sought counseling
and  treatment  because  of  his  use  of  alcohol.  Applicant  answered,  no,  to  these  four
questions.
Applicant understood  the  questions  on  his SCA.  (Tr. 59) He  did  not disclose  his
history of mental health  and  alcohol treatment on  his SCA because  he  did  not think  it was
an  issue  for him  or in  the  alternative, he  said  he  did  not remember why he  did not  disclose
the  requested  information. (Tr. 55) His alcohol consumption  did  not  affect his work and
did  not   involve   law   enforcement.  (Tr.  55)   He  admitted   his  alcohol   consumption   had   a
negative  impact  on  his  marriage.  (Tr. 56) He did not  remember  the wording  in  the  SCA’s
question  about being  advised  to  seek alcohol treatment, and  he  may  have  considered  the
question  to  be  asking  whether he  was ordered  to  seek alcohol treatment  as opposed  to
a  suggestion.  (Tr. 56) He answered,  no, to  the  question  about  mental-health  treatment
because  he  believed  his mental health  “was under control.” (Tr. 57)  He was unsure about
his state  of mind  at  the  time  he  answered  the  questions  on  his SCA. (Tr. 58) His best
recollection was that he answered  no because he “just didn’t think it was a  big deal.” (Tr.

SOR ¶ 1.g. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old fiber optics technician employed by a defense contractor
since September 2020 (Tr. 15) He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant attended a community college from July 2010 to May 2013 and January
2016 to May 2016, but he has not obtained a degree. He married in November 2012 and
separated on a date not reflected in the record. He testified that he was divorced but could
not recall when it occurred. (Tr. 14).
When Applicant submitted his SCA in April 2019, he disclosed that he illegally used
Oxycontin between September 2013 and December  2017. He did not disclose  illegally
using any other controlled substances.
In response to DOHA interrogatories in September 2022, Applicant admitted using
marijuana  twice  a  month  from  January  2006  to  January  2007.  He  admitted  using
Oxycontin once a week from September 2013 to January 2014 and three times a week
in December 2017. (GX 3 at 4.) He declared that he did not intend to use marijuana in
the  future.  (GX  3  at  6) At  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  last  used  marijuana  around
2020. (Tr. 16)
In Applicant’s response to the SOR in December 2022, he admitted using opioids,
including Oxycontin, Percocet, and Roxicodone on various occasions between 2007 and
December  2017,  using  cocaine  in  2007,  abusing  Adderall  in  2012,  and  using  LSD  on
various  occasions  until  2017.  He  also  admitted  using  mushrooms  on  one  occasion  in
2006.  He  denied  using  phencyclidine  (PCP),  but  he  admitted  that  it  was  possible  that
other drugs were laced with PCP. He admitted that in October 2012, he was diagnosed
in  December  2017  he  was  diagnosed  with
with  cannabis  dependence,
opiate/benzodiazepine  dependence  and  sedative/hypnotic  dependence,
that  his
dependence was continuous and severe, and that his prognosis was fair.
that
Applicant testified that he used Adderall in high school in greater quantities than
prescribed, and he continued to use it in college.  He also started stealing opioids from
his father, who had a prescription for them, and used them to counteract the Adderall. (Tr.
18)
In 2007, Applicant “threw a fit” because his parents would not give him the keys to
the family car. His parents called the police, and he was charged with disorderly conduct.
The charges were dismissed. (Tr. 21-22; GX 9 at 5) He was admitted into a behavioral
health  center  for  three  days  and  diagnosed  with  a  major  depressive  disorder,  single
episode, severe; cocaine abuse; opiate abuse; and cannabis abuse. His prognosis was
“good with adequate follow up and support.” (GX 5)
In 2012, Applicant punched his father in the face because of something that  his
father said. His father was in a wheelchair at the time. (Tr. 39) Applicant was charged with
assault  and  battery  on  a  family  member.  He  spent  a  week  in  jail.  He  was  convicted,
adjudication was deferred, and he was required to complete anger management training.
(GX 9 at 5)
In  October  2012,  after  the  incident  with  his  father,  Applicant  was  involuntarily
admitted  to  a  psychiatric  center  and  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder,
generalized  anxiety  disorder,  and  cannabis  dependence.  He  did  not  complete  this
treatment  program.  He  was discharged  in August 2013  because he  stopped attending
appointments and did not respond to efforts to contact him. (GX 6)  The records of the
psychiatric center do not include a prognosis.
In May 2013, Applicant was charged with destruction of property. He testified that
after he and his father had an argument, he broke a handrail in the house. He testified
that at that time, he would sometimes break something when he was angry. (Tr. 43) He
failed to appear in court, was convicted of contempt of court, and was sentenced to 90
days in jail, suspended for 90 days. (GX 4 at 6)
In  mid-2016,  Applicant’s  father  committed  suicide.  Applicant  went  into  “deep
depression” and resumed use of opioids. On December 15, 2017, he self-admitted into a
psychiatric center for opioid detoxication. On admission, he was diagnosed with opioid
withdrawal,  sedative  hypnotic  withdrawal,  opioid  use  disorder,  benzodiazepine  use
disorder, sedative hypnotic use disorder, substance induced mood disorder, and anxiety
disorder not otherwise specified. (GX 7 at 4) He was discharged on December 29, 2017,
and  diagnosed  with  opiate  dependence,  continuous,  severe;  sedative  and  hypnotic
dependence,  continuous,  severe;  and  generalized  anxiety  disorder.  (GX  7  at  41)  His
prognosis was “fair.” (GX 7 at 6)
After Applicant was discharged from the psychiatric center, he was referred to a
psychiatric  nurse  practitioner,  and  he  began  participating  in  group  therapy  in  January
2018.  His  diagnosis  upon  admission  was  opioid  dependance,  uncomplicated;  and
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic dependence, uncomplicated. (GX 8 at 2) A progress note
from June 2018, reflected that he continued to exhibit symptoms of an emotional disorder
and  substance  abuse  disorder.  (GX  8  at  47)  Group  members  were  required  to  attend
meetings  of  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  or  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  three  times  a
week. In November 2018, the psychiatric nurse practitioner suspected that some of the
signatures on his NA attendance sheets appeared to have been forged. Applicant denied
forging signatures, and  the  issue  was not  resolved. (GX 8  at  80)  During  the  treatment
program,  he  tested  positive  for  marijuana  at  least  twice.  (GX  8  at  48)  He  actively
participated  in  the  group  therapy  sessions.  The  group  therapy  records  reflect  that
Applicant was admonished frequently to follow medication instructions and advised him
against premature tapering off the use of drugs to control the craving for opioids. (GX 8
at 82) At the hearing, Applicant admitted that he stopped taking the drugs sooner than his
therapist  recommended  and  contrary  to  the  advice  of  his  peer  support  group.  He
considers himself “completely clean.” (Tr. 32) The records of the group therapy facility do
not include a prognosis.
In  June  2022,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  board-certified  psychologist  at  the
request  of  the  DCSA  CAS.  (GX  4)  The  psychologist  had  him  complete  a  personality
assessment inventory (PAI). The psychologist noted that Applicant responded to items
carelessly  and  did  not  pay  attention  to  the  content  of  the  questions.  He  attributed
Applicant’s  answers  in  the  PAI  were  due  to  “general  carelessness,  reading  problems,
attention  problems,  or idiosyncratic thinking.”  The  psychologist  concluded  that  the  PAI
was invalid because Applicant’s responses to questions were “indicative of respondents
who attempt to portray themselves in the most positive light and exceptionally free of the
common shortcomings to which most others will admit.”
The psychologist also noted that Applicant “was not highly motivated to put forth
the  mental  energy  needed  to  provide  a  detailed  accounting  of  his  mental  health  and
substance us history and treatment history.” Instead, Applicant simply referred to his SCA
and  report  of  investigation  multiple  times  as  the  source  of  information  that  the
psychologist asked for.
Applicant told the psychologist that he stopped using marijuana when he was hired
by his current employer in September 2020, but later in the interview he admitted that he
had “smoked weed here and there” since he was hired. (GX 4 at 4) He admitted to the
psychologist that he stopped taking the opioid-withdrawal drugs sooner than his therapist
recommended  and  contrary  to  the  advice  of  his  peer  support  group.  The  psychologist
reported  that  it  was  difficult  to  fully  understand  Applicant’s  current  substance-abuse
status, because the information he provided during the assessment was inconsistent with
past records (such as his SCA and responses to interrogatories) and his own statements
during  the  assessment.  He  noted  that  there  was  “hard  evidence”  that  Applicant  had
recovered from his last episode of opioid abuse, but there was also evidence that he did
not follow the treatment recommendations from his last treatment that ended in December
2018. The psychologist concluded:
At best, [Applicant] has abstained from opioid and other drug use since 2017
and from marijuana use since 2020. At worst, he misrepresented himself to
me and he continues to use illegal drugs and/or misuse prescription drugs
with an unknown frequency and intensity. . . . At best, [Applicant] is free of
interfering  mental  health  symptoms  at  this time.  At  worst,  he  continues  to
suffer  from  a  range  of  symptoms  to  a  degree  that  interferes  with  his
interpersonal and work life. I am simply unable to tell.
The psychologist concluded, “The results of the present evaluation are inconclusive
regarding whether [Applicant] has any active mental health or substance abuse condition
that could negatively impact his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment in safeguarding
national security information.” (GX 4 at 6-7)
Applicant’s girlfriend since December 2020 met him while they were both working
for his current employer. She  regards him  as a  kind  and  loving  person  who  is “always
trying to improve himself despite the things he did in the past.” She believes that he has
grown into a “healthy and reliable person, coworker, and future husband.” (AX A)
Applicant’s lifelong friend, who now shares an apartment with him, has known him
since they were teenagers. He witnessed  Applicant’s “blatant disregard  for himself and
others around him, destructive behavior, and rampant substance abuse.” He believes that
Applicant has “both figuratively and literally turned his life around in roaring totality for the
better.”  Although  Applicant  was  told  that  he  would  “never  be  employed,  never  free  of
drugs, and never worth of affection,” he now “has a great job, is long-term free of drugs,
and is in a health relationship.” (AX C)
Applicant’s younger brother believes that the turning point in Applicant’s life was
the passing of their father. He describes the changes in Applicant’s behavior as “someone
that  was  on  the  path  of  self-destruction  to  someone  [who]  leads  the  path  of  self-
improvement.”  He  considers  Applicant  a  role  model  to  any  who  wishes  to  better
themselves and enjoy a happy, successful adulthood. (AX D)
Applicant’s mother states that she has watched him  completely transform during
the past ten years, when her view of him was “murky at best” to the present. He now talks
about  things  that  she never dreamed possible  for him.  (AX  E) Applicant’s  former wife,
who maintains a “strong friendship” with him, believes that he has undergone a significant
positive  transformation  after  the  passing  of  his  father.  He  now  handles  his  mother’s
financial matters and has shown no interest in drugs. (AX G)
One of Applicant’s coworkers, who has known him for the past year, describes him
as “an individual who shows up earlier than asked, works hard, and carries [himself] in a
polite, respectable manner. (AX H) Applicant’s project lead describes him as a kind and
generous person with a strong sense of duty and high integrity. (AX B) Applicant’s current
project manager describes him as an upstanding and reliable key employee, who plays
a  critical  role  in  the  fiber  optic  installation  team.  He  strongly  recommends  approval  of
Applicant’s application for a security clearance. (AX F)

"In Applicant’s  answer to the SOR, he denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d and admitted
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor seeking to maintain  a
security  clearance.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  January  2021.  He
previously worked for another contractor from 2015 to 2021. Prior to that he served on
active  duty  in  the  United  States  Army  from  March  11,  2008,  to  October  6,  2014.  He
deployed to Iraq from August 2009 to July 2010. He received an Honorable Discharge.
He served in the Army Reserve after separating from active duty from 2014 to February
2020. He held a security clearance in the Army. He has a high school diploma and some
college credit. He is divorced and has no children. (Tr. 15-21; Response to SOR; GE 1;
AE B; AE I)
The SOR alleges that Applicant has a history of mental health issues which raise
a security concern, to include:
1.a   In  September  2017,  Applicant  was  admitted  for  mental  health  treatment  at
[Redacted  for  Privacy]  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  Medical  Center  for  five  days  inpatient
treatment.  He  was  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder,  recurrent,  moderate;
suicidal ideation; and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic. (GE 1 at 37-38; GE
2 at 8)
1.b     Applicant  received  mental  health  treatment  at  the  VA  Medical  Center  from
September  2017  to  April  2019  for  treatment  related  to  suicidal  ideation  and  major
depressive disorder. The record evidence indicates this was outpatient treatment. (GE 2
at 5, 8; GE 6; GE 7)
1.c  In December 2017, Applicant was admitted to [Redacted for Privacy] Hospital
for  three  days  for  depression  and  suicidal  ideation.  He  was  diagnosed  with  major
depressive disorder, severe, recurrent, without psychotic features. He was discharged in
good condition. (GE 1 at 38; GE 2 at 8; GE 5)
1.d   Finally, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist on June 14, 2021.
The  psychologist  determined  he  had  a  history  of  persistent  depression  and  emotional
dysregulation, which seems to worsen in response to significant psychological stressors.
There  was  concern  he  was  not  engaged  in  psychotherapy  nor  receiving  medication
management although he was open and eager to receive services. If Applicant was able
to receive consistent therapeutic support, his prognosis would be favorable. His emotional
functioning  appeared  to  be  contingent  on  the  level  of  stability  in  his  environment,  as
disruptions in attachment have precipitated his emotional and behavioral dysregulation,
leading  to  impulsive  behaviors  and  safety  concerns.  At  the  time  of  the  evaluation,  he
presented with stability in mood, with absence of clinically significant difficulties that would
interfere with his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. However, to ensure his stability
over time, engagement in treatment is recommended. (GE 3; GE 4)
Applicant and his wife married in 2008. His deployment in 2010 was not good for
his marriage. He and his wife had poor communication.  Applicant was unfaithful to his
wife. His wife discovered he was unfaithful in April 2017. She moved out of the house in
December 2017.  The divorce was final in October 2019.  Applicant became depressed
because  of  the  break-up  of  his  marriage  and  sought  treatment  in  September  2017
because  he  was  having  suicidal  ideations.  He  made  two  unsuccessful  attempts  to  kill
himself  and  realized  he  needed  help.  He  was  inpatient  for  five  days  and  was  put  on
medication.  He  claims  he  never  received  a  formal  diagnosis,  but  admits  he  was
depressed.  The  medical  records  indicate  he  was  diagnosed  with  major  depressive
disorder, recurrent moderate; suicidal ideation; and PTSD, chronic. (Tr. 21-27; GE 2 at 5,
8; GE 6: GE 7)
Upon  his  discharge,  Applicant  attended  outpatient  treatment  through  the  VA
medical center from September 2017 to April 2019. He met with Ms. R., a therapist with
the VA. He also attended group meetings, Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings, and was
also prescribed anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication. He attended weekly single
and group therapy. On occasion, he would attend bi-weekly. He felt the therapy was very
beneficial to him. It helped him move on from a period in his life when he felt isolated and
depressed. It also helped him deal with his divorce. The medication helped him stabilize
his mood and thoughts. (Tr. 27-29)
On December 24, 2017, Applicant was admitted to the hospital for depression and
suicidal  ideation.  He  was  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder  severe,  recurrent,
without psychotic features. Applicant testified he does not remember what happened on
December 24th, other than it was a bad day. He woke up in the hospital. The episode was
described  by  medical  personnel  as  transient  global  amnesia.  The  medical  records
indicate  Applicant  came  to  the  hospital because  he  was  depressed  about  his pending
divorce from his wife. At some point before going to the hospital, he texted his wife that
he was going to hang himself. He also believes he contacted his sister but does not recall
what he told her. His sister called 911 and the police took him to the emergency room of
another hospital.  He was transported to the treating hospital via ambulance. (GE 5 at 2,
4; GE 6 at 43-49) He stayed in the hospital for three days. During his stay he spoke to a
doctor on two occasions and attended group therapy sessions. He was also prescribed
medication to stabilize him. He was discharged after three nights in good condition. Ms.
R, his therapist at the VA, was told about this incident. His treatment remained the same.
(Tr. 29-32; GE 5; GE 6 at 43-49)
Applicant’s therapy sessions at the VA taught him strategies on how to cope with
his  depression  and  anxiety  to  include  daily  exercise  and  getting  involved  in  outside
activities. He works out every day. Exercise keeps him motivated and stable. (Tr. 32-33;
AE G; AE T). He is a member of an adult baseball team. (AE R) He also started attending
church services again and participates in young adult gatherings to include barbeques.
He credits his brother and sister with providing support.  (Tr. 33-35, 39; AE F; AE S) In
2017, he did not have a good support network, he has worked on becoming more involved
and now has a good support network. He also has a new girlfriend whom he has known
since 2019 but started dating in 2023. (Tr. 37, 46; AE Q)
During his first hospitalization in September 2017, Applicant lost his right to own
firearms.  In  September 2017,  Applicant petitioned  the  court for Restoration of  Right  to
Own, Possess, Control, Receive or Purchase Firearms. Before the hearing date, he met
with  Dr G., a licensed psychologist,  at least twice.  Dr.  G. assessed  Applicant’s  mental
health  to  determine  whether  he  was  capable  of  safely  possessing  and  using  firearms.
She  prepared  a  report  which  was  submitted  to  the  court.  The  court  found  by  a
preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  Applicant  was  able  to  use  firearms  in  a  safe  and
lawful  manner  and  that  there  was  no  current  danger  to  himself  or  others.  The  court
granted Applicant’s petition on June 5, 2018. (Tr. 77; AE N)
Applicant self-reported his mental health issues on his electronic questionnaire for
investigations  processing  (e-QIP)  on  May  23,  2018.  (GE  1)  He  provided  additional
information  about  his  mental  health  issues  and  treatment  in  response  to  DOHA
Interrogatories, dated June 17, 2022. (GE 2)
Psychological Evaluations and Therapy
At the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. M.L., a licensed
clinical  psychologist,  on  June  14,  2021.  The  evaluation  was  conducted  on-line  since
Applicant is currently located overseas. The psychologist noted Applicant said he was in
good health and was not taking any form of medication at the time of the interview. He
was also not actively engaged in mental health services, though he reported interest in
pursuing  psychotherapy  supports.  He  stopped  going  to  therapy  in  July  2018  when  he
relocated  to  a  new  city  and  had  difficulty  accessing  services.  He  was  previously
prescribed sertraline and fluoxetine for mood, and hydroxyzine as needed for sleep. He
no longer takes medication. (GE 3; GE 4)
Applicant reported a history of sexual addiction, which began in adolescence with
pornography. He spent approximately four hours per day online. From 2011 to 2013, he
received  treatment  with  a  social  worker.  His  sex  addiction  later  escalated.  He  began
having affairs during his marriage, which ultimately led to his divorce. He reported he has
been “clean and sober” from his sexual addiction for at least three years. He credits his
meetings  with  Sex  Addicts  Anonymous  as  “a  big  part  of  his  recovery.”  He  no  longer
attends  meetings  but  has  developed  insight  surrounding  his  patterns  of  addiction  and
their association with trauma and suppression. (GE 3)
Applicant was described as “open and engaged during the clinical interview.” His
current judgment was assessed to be  clear. His narratives during the clinical interview
and documentation provided by the CAF were highly consistent. Dr. M. L. concluded the
information provided during the assessment is thought to be a valid representation of his
current functioning. (GE 3 at 8)
Applicant completed the Personal Assessment Inventory (PAI), a 344 item, self-
administered objective inventory of adult personality. Applicant’s responses did not result
in any clinically significant elevations across domains that would be suggestive of current
clinical  psychopathology.  His  results  reflected  mid-to-moderate  areas  of  difficulty  in
regard to maladaptive behavior patterns aimed at controlling anxiety. It is consistent with
what would be expected for an individual who experienced a disturbing traumatic event
that contributes to periods of distress and recurrent periods of anxiety. (GE 3 at 8)
Dr.  M.L.  concluded  Applicant  did  not  currently  meet  criteria  for  PTSD,  though
complex  trauma  is  an  important  consideration  in  his  diagnostic  presentation.  Dr.  M.L.
noted  some  indications  of  borderline  personality  traits,  but  she  would  have  to  conduct
additional  tests  to  make  a  conclusion.  His  prolonged  emotional  stability  appears  to  be
contingent on the stability of his environment and relationships which warrants concern
around his propensity for coping in response to stressors. (GE 3 at 10)
Dr.  M.L.  concluded  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  persistent  depression  and
emotional dysregulation, which seems to worsen in response to significant psychosocial
stressors.  Dr. M.L was concerned that he was not engaged in psychotherapy or receiving
any medication management, though he reported being quite open and eager to receive
services  and  has  experienced  barriers  to  accessing  consistent  care.  With  consistent
therapeutic  supports  in  place  to  be  able  to  manage  his  response  to  stressors  in  his
environment,  his  prognosis  is  favorable.  His  emotional  functioning  appears  to  be
contingent on the level of stability in his environment, as disruptions in attachment have
precipitated his emotional and behavioral dysregulation, leading to impulsive behaviors
and  safety  concerns.  Applicant  presents  with  stability  in  mood,  with  an  absence  of
clinically  significant  difficulties  that  would  interfere  with  his  judgment,  reliability,  or
trustworthiness at this time. However, to ensure  his stability  over time, engagement in
treatment is strongly recommended. (GE 3 at 10)
In May 2023, Applicant started attending online counseling sessions with Mr. C.,
Master of Science (MS), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). Applicant meets with
Mr. C. once a week, provided it does not interfere with his work schedule. He is working
with  Mr.  C.  on  three  goals.  First,  understanding  and  distinguishing  past  relationship
dynamics  to  develop  healthier  relationship  patterns  in  the  future.  Second,  discussing
ways  to  cope  and  manage  current  relationship  challenges  in  his  life.  Third,  identify
strategies to help through various life changes and transitions. (Tr. 39-42; AE U)
Mr.  C.  provided  a  statement  indicating  that  Applicant  continues  to  engage  in
therapy.  He  has  reviewed  and  discussed  tools  to  reduce  frequency  and  intensity  of
emotions, create daily self-care routines, ways to build/maintain healthy relationships, and
identifying  specific  needs  during  times  of  transitions  such  as  relocation,  relationship
development, and job changes. He has counseled Applicant on strategies related to self-
care  assessment,  values:  self-exploration,  meaningful
relationships,  grounding
techniques, sleep hygiene, and setting boundaries (communication techniques). (AE U)
Applicant was provided a self-care assessment, Generalized Anxiety Disorder – 7
(GAD-7).  He  measured  on  the  GAD-7  assessment  as  “no  to  minimal”  anxiety  range.
Individuals within this range demonstrate minimal to no daily anxiety symptoms that would
impact  their  daily  or  executive  functioning.  He  was  also  given  a  Patient  Health
Questionnaire-9 related to depression. He measured in the  “no to minimal”  depression
range.  This  range  would  indicate  an  individual  has  minimal  difficulties  with  elevated
moods  being  directly  related  to  situational  and/or  expected  stressors  (e.g  strained
relationships, work, society/cultural conflict.) (AE U)
Mr. C. indicated Applicant has made moderate progress since starting therapy. He
states  adjustment  disorder  with  minor  depressive  traits  would  be  most  aligned  with
Applicant’s  reported  symptoms.  He  recommends  Applicant  to  continue  to  engage  in
weekly/bi-weekly  therapy  sessions,  addressing  ongoing  reported  strain  with  stress,
difficulties  with  social/relationship  situations, and professional challenges  which  impact
mood and relate to transitions. (AE U) Applicant testified that he has a great relationship
with  Mr.  C.  He  meets  with  him  between  45  minutes  to  an  hour  each  week  if  his  work
schedule permits.  So  far, he  spent about 11  hours total in counseling  sessions  with  Mr.
C.  and  intends to  keep  seeing  him  even  when  he  transfers  to  his new job  location.  (Tr.
40-41)
On  August  28,  2023,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  Dr.  J.B.C.,  a  licensed
psychologist.  The  evaluation  was  conducted  on-line.  She  reviewed  Applicant’s
background  history  which  is  consistent  with  the  record  evidence  and  Applicant’s
testimony.  She  also  reviewed  the  2021  psychological  evaluation  of  Dr.  M.L.,  who  was
hired by the DOD to assess Applicant’s mental health situation. Dr. J.B.C. states:
As of this evaluation  in  2023, the  client does  not present with  any clinically
significant  difficulties,  maintains  a  stable  mood,  engages in  numerous self-
care techniques to  maintain proper diet,  sleep  hygiene, physical fitness and
emotional  and   spiritual  wellness.  Additionally,  he
routine
psychotherapy and  is engaged  in  a  new relationship.  He  has  gained  a  great
deal of insight  into  his own behaviors and  how those  affect  others as well
as insight into what precipitates depressive symptoms.  (AE  V)

is
During the clinical interview, Dr. J.B.C. noted Applicant’s judgment is adequate and
insight is good. He was cooperative and friendly and did not appear to be making efforts
at  deception.  (AE  U  at  3)  Applicant  completed  the  PAI,  a  344  item,  self-administered
objective test of personality and psychopathology. His PAI clinical profile is entirely within
normal limits. According to his self-report, Applicant reported no significant problems in
the  following  areas:  unusual  thoughts  or  peculiar  experiences;  antisocial  behavior;
problems  with  empathy;  undue  suspiciousness  or  hostility;  extreme  moodiness  and
impulsivity; unhappiness and depression; unusually elevated mood or heightened activity;
marked  anxiety;  problematic  behaviors  used  to  manage  anxiety;  and  difficulties  with
health or physical functioning. He also reported no significant problems with alcohol or
drug abuse or dependence.  (AE V at 3)
Dr.  J.B.C.  notes  there  was  an  elevation  on  the  anxiety-related  disorder  scale-
traumatic  stress.  She notes it  is a  one  scale elevation  and  not an overall pattern.  She
discussed  lingering  traumatic  stressors  with  Applicant,  specifically  some  of  the  events
that  occurred  during  his  deployment  to  Iraq  which  trouble  him  at  times.  While  not
physically  injured,  he  was  exposed  to  nearly  daily  rocket  attacks.  He  had  a  close  call
when one landed just outside the entrance to the dining hall while he was finishing lunch.
(AE V at 4)
Applicant also completed  the  SPECTRA:  Indices of Psychopathology, a  brief 96-
item   self-administered,  multiscale   measure  of  psychopathology  and   functioning.  His
score was within normal limits. (AE  V  at 4)
Dr.  J.B.C.  concludes  that  based  on  available  past  medical  and  current  data,
Applicant qualifies for a diagnosis of major depressive order, recurrent, in full remission.
She opines Applicant does not present with any conditions at this time that could pose a
significant risk to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. He has gained a great deal
of insight into what precipitates his depressive episodes and is able to  identify themes
and  behaviors  that  would  indicate  that  he  may  be  experiencing  another  episode,
therefore, he can prevent that from happening in the future. Applicant is actively engaged
in routine psychotherapy and understands the importance of that type of support. The risk
to judgment and reliability for any future mental health problems is low. (AE V at 4)
Applicant has had no incidents since December 2017. He is still working on issues
related to his divorce, but believes he is doing well. He believes treatment has helped a
lot. (Tr. 41-42)
Matters Not Alleged in the SOR
Department  Counsel  questioned  Applicant  about  several  matters  that  were  not
alleged  in  the SOR.  Because  they  are  not alleged  in  the SOR,  these  matters are  not
considered as disqualifying conduct, though they may be considered to evaluate evidence
of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, to consider whether an applicant
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation, or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR
Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2016). I will consider these unalleged matters,
accordingly.
In  2014,  while  on  active  duty,  a  new  First  Sergeant  came  to  Applicant’s  unit.
Applicant did not get along with him. The First Sergeant wrote him up for failure to obey
orders. Applicant had an agreement with the previous First Sergeant that he could leave
work early on Wednesdays to attend his bowling league. He continued to leave early on
Wednesdays. It is not clear whether he sought authorization from his new First Sergeant.
He was written up for leaving work early without prior authorization. (GE 1 at 17; GE 2 at
7)
In April 2018, Applicant was written up at his civilian job for performing an action
without a verifier present. The action required a person to take the action and another
person  to  verify  the  action.  Applicant  had  just  started  a  new  medication  and  was
experiencing side effects including drowsiness.  He performed the action on his own. He
admits his actions could have caused damage. He received a warning for this violation.
Applicant  switched  medications  and  became  more  careful  with  following  policies  and
regulations. (Tr. 49; GE 1 at 15; GE 2 at 7)
In May 2018, Applicant and three co-workers were written up and suspended from
work for not clicking  on  the  satellite  prompt  that said “enable.”  He  and  his  co-workers
read the prompt as saying “enabled.” He was suspended for three days. He is now more
careful  when  reading  satellite  prompts.  He  understands  the  importance  of  his  job  and
takes his job seriously. (Tr. 50-51; GE 2 at 8)
In December 2020, Applicant received a letter from the commander of his reserve
unit informing him that he accumulated nine or more unexcused absences in a one-year
period,  failed  to  attend  or  complete  Annual  Training,  or  failed  to  obtain  a  unit  of
assignment during a leave of absence. He was declared an unsatisfactory participant, in
other words, he had a bad year. As a result, Applicant was transferred from the Selected
Reserve  (SELRES)  to  the  Individual  Ready  Reserve  (IRR).  This  is  an  administrative
action taken against reservists who do not fulfill all of their required training days in a one-
year period. Applicant had the opportunity to appeal this action but opted to be transferred
to the IRR. (GE 8) Applicant testified that he stopped attending drills when he moved to
another city and his work schedule conflicted with drill weekends. (Tr. 52-53) I conclude
this action does not have security significance.
Whole-Person Evidence
Several  friends  and  colleagues  wrote  letters  of  support  for  Applicant.  Mr.  J.C.,
Applicant’s  current  supervisor,  has  worked  with  him  since  March  2021.  He  notes  that
Applicant  has  been  recognized  on  two  occasions  for his  outstanding  performance.  He
achieved  a  satisfactory  score  for  a  COMSEC  folder  inspection.  The  inspecting  unit
mentioned that “The [Unit] team maintains an exemplary COMSEC program.” He was a
member  of  a  two-person  team  which  successfully  implemented  a  “Milstar  Network
Cutover event”.  His efforts ensured the network event transitioned on schedule with no
impact to the mission critical communications system.  Mr. J.C. concludes by saying that
Applicant exemplifies what it means to be dedicated to the mission and takes extreme
pride in his work. He has become a valuable asset to the team in a short amount of time.
(AE A)
Dr. B. is executive director of a facility that works with males who are homeless,
suffer from mental health issues, in probation/parole, and/or struggle with drug addiction.
He has known Applicant for 30 years.  They attended the same elementary school and
high  school.  They  know  each  other’s  families.  At  one  point,  they  were  married  to  two
sisters until Applicant and his wife divorced. He is aware of many of the details of what
Applicant went through during the divorce, but he and his spouse designated him to be
one of three individuals to manage their assets and care for their three daughters should
something happen to them. They chose him because they wanted a person who would
do the right thing for their children. Applicant is honest, responsible and trustworthy. (AE
A)
The pastor of Applicant’s church has known Applicant since May 2021. He attends
Sunday services regularly. He participates in after service barbeques, and attends weekly
Bible  study  sessions  on  Wednesday  evenings  if  his  work  schedule  permits.  He  looks
forward to his spiritual growth and further involvement in the congregation. (AE E)
Applicant’s most recent performance evaluation for the period from May 2022 to
is  “Generally  Meets
April  2023,  is  favorable.  His  overall  performance  rating
Requirements.”  His was noted for maintaining his employer’s high standards of quality
assurance  and  functional area management. He  is consistently  early for all scheduled
work shifts and willing to come in on non-scheduled days if needed. He routinely asks for
things to do or items to accomplish. (AE P) His performance evaluation from May 2021
to April 2022 is equally favorable. (AE D) Applicant’s NCO Evaluation  Reports while in
the reserves met or exceeded standards.  (AE C)
Applicant’s  awards  and   decorations  while  on   active   duty  include   the   Army
Commendation   Medal;  the   Army  Achievement  Medal  (2nd   Award);  Meritorious  Unit
Commendation  Medal; Army Good  Conduct Medal (2nd  Award); National Defense  Service

Psychological Conditions  and Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that  in about November 2006, Applicant was diagnosed with
PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and Alcohol Dependence. He received alcohol detoxification
from a clinic. In 2002, he drank excessively when his first marriage ended. (Tr1. 105, 108;
GE 5 at 11) He was feeling nervous and anxious after his deployment to Egypt, and he
decided to discuss it with a mental-health counselor. (Tr1. 64-65, 103) He was diagnosed
with PTSD. (Tr1. 63) He was prescribed Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, Decampere, anti-
alcohol, and Trazodone to help him sleep. (Tr1. 65-66) He also received psychotherapy
for  three  to  ten  days.  (Tr1.  66)  He  frequently  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings in  the 2004 to  2006 timeframe. (Tr1.  67, 105,  109) Both of  his parents  were
alcoholics, and he indicated he may have a genetic predisposition towards alcoholism.
(Tr1. 104) After each alcohol treatment, he was “pretty much [told] don’t drink alcohol, go
to [AA] meetings.” (Tr1. 109)
SOR  ¶   1.b   alleges  that  in  about  2012,  Applicant  completed   alcohol-related
treatment,  and  in  2013, he  relapsed. He  attended  some  group  meetings at  a  clinic and
some  AA  meetings. (Tr1.  68) He believed  the  treatment he  was receiving  was ineffective
and  a  waste  of time. (Tr1.  69, 118) His marriage  fell  apart, and  he  lost  his job. (Tr1.  69-
70,  119)  These   factors  contributed   to   his  relapse.  (Tr1.   69)  He  used   alcohol  to   self-
medicate. (Tr1.  70)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that in about October 2013, Applicant received alcohol-related
treatment and completed detoxification at a clinic. The alcohol-related treatment was on
an outpatient basis, and he went every couple of weeks. (Tr1. 71, 120) He went to the
treatment primarily for medication management. (Tr1. 71) An April 23, 2014 VA progress
note  states  that  Appellant  said  he  had  a  relapse  in  October  2013.  (GE  5  at  11)  “The
incident  led  his  employer  to  require  him  to  complete  an  alcohol  rehabilitation  program
prior to returning to work. He completed [a program] and is currently active in Alcoholics
Anonymous.”  (Id.)  The  note  does  not  describe  “the  incident.”  The  April  23,  2014  VA
progress  note  states  Applicant  had  consumed  alcohol  before  his  VA  appointment  and
Applicant believed it was unsafe for him to drive home in his vehicle. (Id. at 16) The VA
called a cab, which took him from the VA to his residence. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that from November 20 to 25, 2013, Applicant received alcohol-
related inpatient treatment from a clinic, and he was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder
(moderate,  in  early  remission),  Major  Depressive  Disorder,  and  Cluster  B  personality
traits. Applicant agreed with the summary in SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr1. 73, 121; SOR response)
The  therapy  at  the  clinic  entailed  attending  classes  and  AA  meetings.  (Tr1.  74)  He
indicated  that  he  was sober for two  years in November 2013.  (Tr1.  121;  AE  M (check
cite)) A VA progress note states that Applicant had a significant relapse in October 2013,
and  “The  incident led  his employer to  require  him  to  complete  an  alcohol rehabilitation
program  prior to  returning  to  work.” (AE  H at 3  (VA  page  22)) The VA record said that
Applicant said:
He was required  to  go  to  alcohol rehabilitation  in October 2013, in  order to
keep  his job, and  he  returned  [to  work]  in January 2014. .  . .  The  veteran
denied  any legal problems or significant behavioral disturbances  other than
his excessive  drinking  that  led  his employer  to  require  that  he  complete  an
alcohol rehabilitation  program in October 2013  in order to  keep  his job. (AE
H at 2-3 (VA pages  21-22))
Applicant  denied  that  his employer required  him  to  attend  alcohol rehabilitation  to  retain
his employment. (Tr1. 147-148) After he was confronted  with  the  progress note, he said,
“Yes, and I  don’t, I  don't know where  that’s coming  from. It says [he] had  to go to alcohol
rehab  in order to  keep  his job. I don’t  recall  that.  I don’t  know where that's from.” (Tr1.
150) He denied  that he  ever lost his job  due  to  drinking.  (Tr1. 122) He said,  “I didn’t lose
my job. I never,  I never lost  my job.” (Tr. 122-123) He said  he  lost  his job  because  the
contract ended and was not rebid. (Tr1. 123)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  from  November  25,  2013,  to  about  January  1,  2014,
Applicant received 37 days of residential treatment for Anxiety, PTSD, and Depression at
a clinic. Applicant agreed with the summary in SOR ¶ 1.e. (Tr1. 74; SOR response) He
successfully completed the treatment program. (Tr1. 123)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that from about January 10, 2014, to about January 14, 2014,
Applicant  received  Alcohol  Detox  treatment  at  a  VA  medical  center.  He  did  not  recall
whether he had a relapse after leaving the clinic on January 1, 2014. (Tr1. 75) He did not
remember whether there was a triggering event for his relapse. (Tr1. 123) The treatment
in January 2014 may have been for aftercare rather than detox. (Tr1. 75)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that from about March 3, 2014, to about May 2014, Applicant
received treatment at a VA hospital for PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder (Recurring with
Moderate  Severity),  Alcohol  Use  Disorder  (Severe),  and  Mild  Neurocognitive  Disorder
related to TBI. Applicant sought treatment at the VA hospital because “everything kind of
started  falling  apart.”  (Tr1.  76)  He  remembered  being  at  the  VA  hospital;  however, he
could not remember too much about what occurred there. (Tr1. 77) VA treatment records
for May 2014 indicate he was drinking 12-18 beers a day. (GE 5 at 15-16; AE P at 7) He
had attended rehabilitation for alcohol on five previous occasions. (AE P at 7) Before his
11 am appointment on May 8, 2014, he had consumed three beers. (GE 5 at 16; AE P at
12)
On  August  23,  2014,  Applicant’s  insurance  company  called  the  police  and
informed  them  that  Applicant  was  at  his  residence;  he  was  suffering  from  alcohol
poisoning; and the caller requested a welfare check. (GE 3 at 31-32) The police entered
his  residence  and  observed  garbage,  beer  cans,  and  fecal  matter  strewn  about  his
residence. (Id.) Applicant was transported to a VA medical center. (Id.) This incident is
not listed in the SOR, and it will not be considered for disqualification purposes.
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges that from about December 16, 2014, to about December 24,
2017, Applicant received treatment from the VA for Alcohol Use Disorder, and he received
alcohol detoxification. He failed to follow treatment advice to refrain from alcohol use.
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that from about  February 2017 to about May 2017, Applicant
received  inpatient  hospitalization  at  a  VA  hospital  for  PTSD.  Applicant  believed  the
treatment he  received  in  2017  was  the  most  effective.  (Tr1.  77-78)  The  facility focused  on
PTSD and  mindfulness. (Tr1.  78) He  also  received  medication  management.  (Tr1.  78)  He
attended  AA  meetings at night.  (Tr1.  78) He finally accepted  that he  was an  alcoholic and
he  needed  to  take  sobriety one  day at a  time.  (Tr1.  79, 98) A  March  29, 2017, VA  Disability
Benefits  Questionnaire   states,  “Alcohol  is  drug   of  choice.   Became   a   problem   in  2005
when   he   returned   from   Egypt.   Has  had   periods  of   abstinence   over  the   years: one   [to]
three  years but a  lot  of roller coaster. Currently has been  abstinent since  2  January 2017.”
(AE Q at 98)
SOR ¶  1.j  alleges that on  March  18, 2021,  a  licensed  psychologist,  Dr. B,  evaluated
Applicant’s mental health  at   the  request of   security officials. Dr. B   diagnosed  Applicant
with   PTSD,  Major  Depressive  Disorder  (Moderate,  Recurrent),  Generalized   Anxiety
Disorder, and  Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe).  (GE 4 at 7) Dr. B is a  clinical psychologist.
(GE  4   at   7)   Applicant   said   he   remembered   taking   a   test   on-line;   however,   he   did  not
remember Dr. B’s interview of him.  (Tr1.  80-81)  He said  he  was “a  little guarded” during
the  interview because  he  “didn’t know what  this was about” and,  he  “didn’t know that [he]
had  to  fight to keep [his] clearance  again.” (Tr1.  81) He denied that he lied to Dr. B. (Tr1.
82) Dr. B  noted  that Applicant told another evaluator that in  2016  his last  drink was in
2016; however,  he  told  Dr. B  that  his last drink was in  2014.  (Tr1.  82) Applicant said he
did not “recall  that.” (Tr1.  82)  He was  upset when  he  read  Dr. B’s report because  of  the
comments about his lack of candor. (Tr1. 153-154)
Dr.  B  noted  that  Applicant  “maintained  the  belief  that  he  had  a  brief  bout  of
substance  abuse  treatment at the  VA  in 2014  and that he has been  sober ever since.”
(GE  4  at  6)  He  relapsed  after  2014.  (Id.)  He  omitted  disclosure  of  alcohol-related
treatment from February to May 2017 at a VA facility. (Id. at 4, 6) She indicated Applicant
“has  a  history  of  underreporting  and  withholding  information.  His  tendency  to  omit
pertinent  details  of  his  behavioral  health  history  may  have  [led]  previous  evaluators  to
formulate  inaccurate  conclusions.”  (Id.)  Dr.  B  concluded  that  it  would  be  imprudent  to
grant Applicant access to classified information, and stated:
[Applicant]  is clearly  a  troubled  man  who  has been  using  alcohol  to  cope
with  severe mental  health  symptoms  for many years. While  his history of
inpatient  care  and  multiple responses is  problematic,  his  poor insight and
candor  issues  are  of  greatest  concern.   The   degree   to   which   he   withheld
information  throughout  the  security vetting  process (2016  to  present) was
indicative  of  intentional  concealment, which  brings his  overall  credibility into
question. (GE 4  at  7)
At his hearing, Applicant said his last drink of alcohol was on November 3, 2017,
and  he  has  been  sober  for  almost  six  years.  (Tr1.  82,  89)  He  remembered  the  date
because he had completed Step Four with his sponsor. (Tr1. 79, 83) He listed the dates,
times, and group names for his attendance at AA meetings in June and July 2021. (GE 2
at 74) He speaks to his AA sponsor about every day. (Tr1. 83) His sponsor did not want
to be involved in Applicant’s security clearance hearing because he had some issues with
law enforcement, and AA is anonymous. (Tr1. 83)
Applicant attends AA meetings three or four days a week. (Tr1. 90) He contacts
his sponsor if he has a craving for alcohol. (Tr1. 91) He has a stable home life, and he is
more mature. (Tr1. 90) He joined a church a few months before his hearing. (Tr1. 93) His
PTSD is less significant in his life now that he has retired from the Army. (Tr1. 93) He
regularly  sees  a  VA  counselor,  and  he  plans  to  call  the  VA  crisis  line  if  his  PTSD  is
becoming difficult for him to control. (Tr1. 94) He has the tools to maintain his sobriety.
(Tr1. 90)
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges from about 2002 to at least 2017, Applicant consumed alcohol
to excess and to the point of intoxication. Applicant said he began drinking heavily in 2003
or 2004. (Tr1. 50) Before he deployed, he drank as “a way to cope.” (Tr1. 51) After his
deployment, he drank as a way to self-medicate. (Tr1. 51) Alcohol helped him to relax.
(Tr1.  51)  After  he  returned  from  Egypt,  his  drinking  increased.  (Tr1.  52)  He  said  he
stopped drinking alcohol in 2017. (Tr1. 53) He received assistance from AA. (Tr1. 53-54)
Between  2014  and  2017,  he  did  “not  consciously”  consume  excessive  amounts  of
alcohol. (Tr1. 132) After 2017, he went to AA meetings. (Tr1. 133)
SOR  ¶   2.b   alleges  in   about   September  30,   2014,   Applicant  was   arrested   and
charged   with   driving   under  the   influence   of  alcohol  (DUI).  Applicant  bumped   a   parked
vehicle  when  he  was  parking  his vehicle. (Tr1.  56,  127-130; GE  3  at  23) The  damage  to
the   other  vehicle   was  not  extensive,   and   no   one   was  injured.  (Tr1.   58-59)  The   police
arrived,  and   Applicant   failed   a   field  sobriety  test.   (Tr1.   56;  GE   3   at   27)  Applicant’s
breathalyzer  result  was  .085.   (Tr1.   57,   128;   GE   3   at  28)  He   was   arrested   for  reckless
driving  and  Operating  Motor Vehicle  Under the  Influence  (DUI). (GE  3  at 26, 28) At his
security clearance  hearing  he  said unaware  when  he  was charged  that he  was charged
with  DUI.  (Tr1. 130) He pleaded  guilty to,  and  he  was convicted  of,  reckless driving. (Tr1.
58) He was not prosecuted for DUI. (Tr1.  59)
SOR  ¶  2.c  alleges  in  about  October  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged
with DUI. Applicant hit the back corner of an unoccupied vehicle, which was parked near
his residence. (Tr1. 59, 62; GE 3 at 8) Applicant drove a short distance away and parked
his  vehicle  at  his  residence.  (Id.)  The  same  police  officer  who  was  involved  in  his
September 2014 DUI arrest arrived and assumed he had been drinking. (Tr1. 60; GE 3
at 14) Applicant had not consumed any alcohol prior to the accident. (Tr1. 62) The police
searched his vehicle and found a BB or pellet imitation firearm in the back of his vehicle.
(Tr1. 60, 131; GE 3 at 11, 12) His breathalyzer result was 0.00. (Tr1. 62; GE 3 at 14) He
also provided a urine sample for testing. (GE 3 at 12, 15, 17) Applicant denied that he
was  aware that he  was  being arrested for DUI.  (Tr1.  131)  Applicant  was charged with
Unlawful  Possession  of  an  Imitation  Firearm,  Leaving  the  Scene  of  an  Accident,
Operating a Motor Vehicle Under the Influence; and Operating an Unregistered Vehicle.
(GE 3 at 11) He believed he was arrested for possession of an illegal firearm. (Tr1. 131)
He  found  out  he  was charged  with  DUI  and  possession  of  an  illegal  firearm  when  the
charges were sent. (Tr1. 62, 132) He was convicted of reckless driving, and he received
a $158 fine. (Tr1. 60)
SOR ¶ 2.d cross alleges under the alcohol consumption guideline, the information
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j, which are alleged under the psychological conditions guideline.
Applicant  denied that he had  ever been terminated from his employment because
of  drinking.  (Tr1.  139)  However,  a   May  8,  2014   progress  note   states  “Veteran   called
directly [his]  case  manager reporting  to  have  recently been  fired  from  his job  and  abuses
alcohol drinking  12-18  beers a day.”  (Tr1. 140; GE 5 at 16)  At his hearing, he said he  did
not  “recall  ever saying” that he  had  been  fired. (Tr1.  141) He  suggested  his  memory in
2014  may have  been  affected  by his alcohol  consumption  and  TBI.  (Tr1. 142) However,
he did not believe  his TBI affected his ability to perform  his job today. (Tr1.  142)
Dr. G’s  Evaluation
Dr. G is a VA clinical psychologist. On July 27, 2021, Dr. G said Applicant has been
receiving VA treatment at his location since 2019. (GE 2 at 72) Dr. G diagnosed Applicant
with PTSD and Alcohol Abuse in Sustained Remission. (GE 2 at 72) Dr. G summarized
his current treatment and prognosis as follows:
He . .  . engaged  in  individual therapy from  July 2019  to  November  2020.
Individual therapy was  discontinued  because  he  had  successfully met all  of
his individual therapy treatment goals and  had  successfully developed  an
ongoing   recovery  plan.  He  currently  continues  to   be   seen   for medication
management,  through   our  clinic.  He  has  been   an   active   participant  in
treatment and  compliant with  treatment recommendations. In  regards to  his
treatment goals,  he  has made  significant progress in obtaining  his goals and
is currently maintaining those gains. (GE 2  at  72)
Dr. W’s Evaluation
On  July 20, 2023, Dr. W  provided  an  evaluation  of Applicant’s mental health. (AE
TT)  Dr. W  is a  clinical psychologist  who  focuses on  treatment of PTSD. (Tr1. 156, 163)
She  did  not review  Applicant’s medical  records because  she  did not  have  time. (Tr1.  164)
She  reviewed  Dr. B’s  report,  and  she  discussed  Dr.  B’s report with  Applicant.  (Tr1.  164-
165)  Applicant   had   26   sessions   with   Dr.  W   over  the   previous   5   ½   months.   (Id.)  She
diagnosed  him  with  PTSD. (Tr1. 157-158; AE  TT) She  said he  is dedicated  to  attendance
at AA  meetings. (Tr1. 159)  She  does not believe  Applicant has consumed  alcohol in the
last  six months.  (Tr1.  159) She  concurred  with   Dr. G, that   Applicant’s “alcoholism   is in
remission  and that he  has met all [of] his treatment goals and objectives.” (AE TT)
Dr. W  opined  that Applicant was  being  honest with  her about  his symptoms  and
mental-health  history. (Tr1. 160) Applicant has memory issues from  his PTSD. (Tr1. 166)
His  prognosis
is  good.  (Tr1.   160)  In   response   to   Applicant’s  question   about
recommendations to  ensure he  does not relapse  or his PTSD manifest does not itself in
a  negative  way,  Dr. W  said he  should receive psychotherapy  to  help with  the  traumatic
events he  experienced  in childhood  and  during  his military service. (Tr1. 161) In  her report
Dr. W said:
The  prognosis for [Applicant]  is very good,  given  his  willingness and  ability
to   comply   with   continued   aftercare.   Recovery  of  symptoms  is  possible.
Outcomes  for him  are  improved  with  continued  coping  skills and  symptom
awareness and  management.
[Applicant]   does  not  have   any  condition   that  calls  his  trustworthiness,
judgment,  or  reliability into  question. I believe  [Applicant]  has been  honest
with  me  about his  issues. We  discussed  in detail  his past alcohol abuse. He
appears  to   be   a   stable   and   well-adjusted   individual,   given   the   PTSD,
Anxiety, and  Depression  that he  has  suffered  in  the  past.  Other than  PTSD,
he does not exhibit other symptoms. (AE TT at 3)
Mr. B’s Comments
Mr. B is a VA outpatient clinical psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. (AE
VV) On July 5, 2023, Mr. B said, “To date, [Applicant] has been actively engaged in his
outlined treatment plan. He [is] compliant with medications and with all requests outlined
by this provider.” (AE VV) Mr. B did not provide a diagnosis or a prognosis.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c allege Applicant falsified material facts on his June 20,
questions.
“No,”
answered,
following
2016  SCA  when
the
he
to
(1) “Section  24-Use  of Alcohol Sought  Counseling  or Treatment Have  you  EVER
voluntarily sought counseling  or treatment as a  result of your use  of alcohol?” He  failed
to   disclose   the   information   in  SOR  ¶¶   1.a   through   1.h.   (GE  1   at  35)  In   the   Optional
Comment section  he  said,  “I attend  AA  meetings regularly. Spoke  with  a  VA  psychiatrist
in 2011 regarding alcohol use related to PTSD  issues.” (Tr1. 136; GE 1 at 35)
(2) and  (3) “Section  22-Police  Record-Summary In  the  past seven  (7) years have
you been charged, convicted, or sentenced  of a crime in any court?” Applicant disclosed
the  October 2014  vehicle accident and  arrest  for possession of an  imitation  firearm. (GE
1  at 31) He  said  the  offense  was downgraded  to  “Petty Disorderly Persons Offense,” and
he received  a $158 fine. (GE 1 at 31-32) He  did not disclose the DUI charges.
Applicant’s 2016  SCA  also asked,  “In  the  last seven  years  has  your use  of alcohol
had  a  negative  impact  on  your  work performance.  . . or resulted  in  intervention  by  law
enforcement/public  safety personnel?”  He   said, “No.”  (GE   1   at   35)  It asked,   “Have   you
EVER received  counseling  or treatment  as a  result of your use  of alcohol  in addition  to
what  you   have   already  listed   on   this  form?”  Applicant   said,  “No,”   and   in   the   Optional
Comment section said, “I attend AA  meetings regularly.” (GE 1 at 35)
Applicant  had previously completed  SCAs  during  his Army  career. (Tr1.  86) He
said when he was completing his 2016 SCA he did not remember all of the places he
attended for alcohol treatment or when he received treatment at the facilities. (Tr1. 84)
He said no because he did not want to provide the additional specific information which
would have been required to complete the SCA. (Tr1. 135-136) He expected he would be
meeting  with  an  investigator  in  about  30  days,  and  he  planned  to  disclose  his alcohol
treatment to the investigator. (Tr1. 84, 144) No one ever told him that it was okay to omit
information on the SCA and provide the information later to an investigator. (Tr1. 145)
Applicant believed when he was completing the SCA, if he answered, yes, then he
would not be able to proceed on the form without providing specific information. (Tr1. 85)
Also,  the  form  cannot  be  saved,  and  an  applicant  must  restart  the  form  if  it  is  not
completed. (Tr1. 85) However, he repeatedly indicated on his SCA “estimated” for dates,
(GE 1 at 9-13, 17-18, 21-26), and in other locations, he utilized the “Optional Comment”
function  to  indicate  “I  do  not  have  this  information”  or  “I  do  not  know  place  of  birth
information.” (GE 1 at 22)
Applicant denied that he was trying to hide or deceive security. (Tr1. 85, 87) He
signed a consent form or waiver to allow the investigator to obtain his treatment records.
(Tr1. 87) He said he disclosed the information missing from his SCA to the investigator.
(Tr1. 85) He said he thought he wrote on the form that he had alcohol issues, and he
would explain it to the investigator later. (Tr1. 145-146) He did not have any draft SCA
forms. (Tr1. 146) He did not remember ever being referred for alcohol counseling. (Tr1.
146-147) However, a treatment note indicates he was referred for alcohol treatment or
counseling. (Tr1. 147; AE H at 21) He said the treatment note was accurate except for
the part about having to go to alcohol treatment to keep his job. (Tr1. 150)
According to Applicant’s August 8, 2016 OPM personal subject interview (PSI), he
initially told the investigator that he stopped consuming alcohol in late 2014; however, he
said he most recently drank a beer in June 2016. (GE 2 at 18) He was asked three times
to  disclose  additional  alcohol-related  treatments,  and  he  denied  additional  treatments.
(Tr1. 137-138; GE 2 at 18) Then the investigator would name a particular treatment entity,
and Applicant would admit receiving alcohol-related treatment at that facility. (Tr1. 138;
GE  2  at  18)  He  attributed  his  failure  to  disclose  the  treatments  until  the  investigator
confronted  him  with  the  facts  to  his  lack  of  recollection  or  inability  to  remember  or
alternatively to oversight and not having the details available to him at the time he was
completing his SCA. (Tr1. 139; GE 2 at 18, 21)
Applicant  did  not  disclose  his  DUI  offense  because  he  was  only  convicted  of
reckless driving. (Tr1. 87) He  said, “Maybe  I  read  the  question  wrong  and  just  thought
charge meant the same thing as conviction. Are you a lawyer? No, I’m not.” (Tr1. 88) He
is aware that there would be police reports and court records, and those records would
be available to investigators. (Tr1. 89)
In his August 17, 2016 OPM PSI, Applicant disclosed the details of his two arrests
in September to October 2014 without being confronted with the facts. (GE 2 at 17) He
said he did not list the September 2014 arrest and the DUI component of the October
2014 arrest on his SCA due to oversight. (GE 2 at 17)
10
Applicant told Dr. B or the OPM investigator or both that he was sober from 2006
to 2011. (Tr1. 113; GE 2 at 17; GE 4 at 4) In March 2011, he returned from Iraq, locked
himself into a hotel room and drank 12 six packs of beer over several days. (Tr1. 114; GE
2 at 17-18; GE 5 at 11) He described himself as “a chronic relapse” from 2004 to 2011.
(Tr1. 115) He did not actually get sober until 2017. (Tr1. 117)
Applicant said  he  could  not afford  to  pay his mortgage  in  2014. (Tr1.  125) Applicant
said his mortgage  company foreclosed  on  his residence. (Tr1. 125) Department Counsel
raised  the  issue  of Applicant’s failure  to  disclose  the  foreclosure  of  his residence  on  his
2016  SCA.  (Tr1. 126) Applicant responded  that the  foreclosure was not in 2016; however,
he  did not remember when  it  occurred. (Tr1.  127) A  December 16,  2014  progress  note
states  that  Applicant  is  unable  to  pay  his mortgage  and  his house  is  in foreclosure.  (GE
6  at  12, 23) In  Section  26-Financial  Record  of his SCA,  Applicant disclosed  his delinquent
child  support debt,  and  in the  Optional  Comment section  he  said,  “My wife  and  I separated
in  2011.  Our divorce   was  final  in   2014.  In   2014,   I   faced   numerous   financial  difficulties
resulting  from  loss of income. I am  currently rectifying  many of those  issues.” (GE 1  at
39)  Applicant disclosed  sufficient information  on  his SCA about “financial difficulties” to
mitigate  concerns about his foreclosure not being  listed  on his SCA.  The  foreclosure will
not be further discussed in this decision.
In the additional comments at the end of his SCA, Applicant said:
Regarding  Alcohol Treatment:  In  2004,  I entered  Alcoholics Anonymous for
the  first time,  and  have  been  going  to  these  meeting  ever since. Please  note
that  I  have   never  been   reprimanded,  nor  fired   from   any  employment
regarding  my previous alcohol use. I am  currently a  lieutenant colonel in the
United  States Army Reserve and  have  never received  any sort of punitive
action   during   my
I  violated   my
responsibilities  in  maintaining   my  security  clearance-now  over  25   years
holding  a  security clearance. I am  a  trustworthy and  reliable candidate. (GE

Character Evidence
Applicant’s  fiancé   is  a   nurse  and   case   manager  with   32   years  of   medical
experience. (Tr2. 6) She  has known Applicant since  November 2022, and  he  does not
consume  alcohol.  (Tr2.  7) He  disclosed  he  had  been  to  alcohol  rehabilitation,  and  he  does
not  drink.  (Tr2. 8)  They  are  together five  days a  week, and  she  has  not seen  any signs of
alcohol   consumption.  (Tr2.  9)  She   was  previously  married   to   an   alcoholic,  and   if  he

A  coworker  who  has  known  Applicant  for  three  years  described  him  as  very
reliable,  forthright,  friendly,  dependable,  and  trustworthy.  (Tr2.  22-24,  27)  He  has  a
wonderful reputation as an employee. (Tr2. 24) There has not been any indication that he
has been consuming alcohol. (Tr2. 25) He has a very good memory. (Tr2. 25)
Applicant’s neighbor for 10  years lauded  Applicant’s contributions to  the  national
defense  and  described  his numerous attendances at AA  meetings.  (GE 2  at 83-84) He
recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance.
Applicant  received  excellent  performance  evaluations  and  officer  evaluation
reports. (GE 2 at 87-113; AE II; AE NN) He successfully completed multiple challenging
training  courses  while  in  the  Army,  including  Airborne,  Ranger,  Air  Assault,  and

Applicant provided a heartfelt and sincere closing statement:
Alcohol,   and   my  recovery  from   it,  has  been   brought  up   and   it’s  probably
going to be further brought up. You know, unfortunately for me, the  subject
of alcoholism and  my past issues [were] not high points in my life.
The toughest issue I  had to  experience was acceptance. And just basically
being  able to  finally admit to  myself and  say in an  AA  meeting. Hello  my
name is [Applicant]  and I’m  an  alcoholic.
I’ve  since  retired  from  military service, but I  continue  to  support the  Army in
my current employment.  I’m  very proud  of my  military service. But I‘m  also
very proud  of  the  work that I’m  currently doing  as a  Government  employee.
I am a devoted  patriot.  I’ve  spent my entire  life  working  and  supporting  this
country. And  I do  love  this country deeply. I am  very hopeful, I’m  hopeful for
a  future where I can  continue  to  contribute  and  continue  to  work in  a  role
that  I love.  I hope  that  you  will  take  that  in  consideration. Thank  you.   (Tr1.

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 4.c, 4.d, 4.h,
4.i, 4.j, 4.l, 4.m, and 4.n with clarifications. He denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a,
2.b,  2.c,  3.a,  4.a,  4.b,  4.e,  4.f,  4.g,  4.k,  and  4.o.  (HE  3)  He  also  provided  mitigating
information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  51-year-old  aircraft  mechanic  who  has  worked  for  a  government
contractor in that position for almost six years. (Tr. 7, 10, 34) In 1991, he graduated from
high school. (Tr. 7) He served in the Navy from 1993 to 2013; his specialty was avionics
technician; and he honorably retired as a chief petty officer. (Tr. 8; SOR response) He
has a 100 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 8)
Seventy  percent  of  his  disability  rating  is  for  bipolar  disorder.  (Tr.  8,  60)  In  2018,  he
received a bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 8)
Applicant’s first marriage was from 2000 to September 2011. (Tr. 9) In March 2012,
he  married  Ms. G;  however, he  said  he  has  not  seen  Ms.  G  since  June  of  2013. (Tr. 9)
He was unsure whether Ms. G  had  filed  for divorce.  (Tr. 9, 36) He  did not take  any action
to obtain a divorce. (Tr. 37) He believed she  has been with  another man since 2016. (Tr.
9)  He has two children with his first wife who are ages 11 and 23, and he said he did not
have  any children with  Ms. G. (Tr. 9-10, 38)
Personal Conduct
Foreign  Influence
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  is married  to  Ms.  G,  who  a  citizen and  resident of
Peru. He repeatedly and deliberately failed to disclose this relationship to the government,
as  required.  SOR  ¶  4.b  alleges  he  failed  to  disclose  his  intimate  relationship  with  a
Peruvian national (Ms. G) to his command while enlisted in the Navy.
In July 2010, Applicant met Ms. G when he was in Peru. (Tr. 41)  In September
2012,  he  informed  the  Navy  of  his  marriage  to  Ms.  G.  (Tr.  21-22)  The  marriage  was
documented in his Navy personnel records. (Tr. 35, 53; SOR response, Attach. 2)
The last time Applicant was in Peru was in 2013, and the last time he saw Ms. G
was in 2013. (Tr. 38-40) He did not communicate with her from 2016 to 2018. (Tr. 29-40)
From about 2018 to 2021, he talked to her about twice a week, and the last time he talked
to her was in 2021. (Tr. 39-41) He denied her requests for funds during the 2018 to 2021
time period. (Tr. 41)
Psychological Conditions
SOR ¶  2.a  alleges on  March 9, 2021, Dr. E, a  psychologist, evaluated  Applicant
and  concluded  he  had  “demonstrated  a  pattern  of rule-violating  behavior, poor judgment,
and  dishonesty that could reasonably and  significantly diminish  his trustworthiness and
judgment in a national security context.”
Dr. E evaluated Applicant as requested by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications
Facility  (CAF),  which  is  the  predecessor  organization  for  the  DCSA  CAS.  (GE  4)  He
diagnosed  Applicant  with  Bipolar  I  Disorder,  severe,  in  partial  remission,  most  recent
episode  manic;  Other  Specified  Anxiety  Disorder  (with  symptoms  of  agoraphobia  and
panic); and Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate, in sustained remission. (Id. at 7) Dr. E listed
the materials he considered for his evaluation of Applicant; however, he did not mention
consideration of VA treatment records or other recent records of mental-health treatment.
Dr. E provided a detailed description of Applicant’s mental health and professional history,
which  was  primarily  based  on  Applicant’s  statements,  the  Naval  Criminal  Investigative
Service  (NCIS)  report,  and  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  interviews.  Dr.  E
concluded:
[Applicant]  went  on  trips to  Peru  with  the  attitude  of “Screw  it! What  are they
going  to  do  to  me?” His view is that all  the  allegations pertaining  to  him  lying
about various matters were “trumped  up stuff.”
It   is  possible  that  [Applicant’s]  command   was  not  supportive   of  him   and
developed   a   negative   view  of  him   due   to   his  medical  and   behavioral
problems. However, based  on  the  totality of the  information  available to  me,
my impression  is that [he] is [a] person  who  is willing  to  violate  rules if he
believes he  can  do  so  without being  discovered  and  if doing  so  helps him
attain an  objective. If  he  is discovered, he  seems to  be  a  person  who  adopts
unsophisticated   tactics  to   avoid   trouble,   including   denial  in   the   face   of
obvious   evidence   and   dishonesty.  While   I  acknowledge   that  most   of   the
evidence   of  his  bad   judgment,   poor  decision   making,  and   rule-violating
behaviors  occurred   almost  a   decade   ago,  there  are  indications  that  he
omitted   information   on   his   SF   86   in   2018   (e.g.,   overlooking   his   present
marriage) and  that  he  provided  misleading  information   during  the  present
evaluation (e.g., denying  problems while in the Navy until confronted). This
suggests that he  continues  to  rely on  omissions,  counteraccusations, and
denials  to  resolve  problem  situations  (e.g.,  security clearance  investigation).
It  seems likely he  would  still  lie  to  cover his mistakes—a  serious concern if
he holds a security clearance  and/or works as an  aircraft mechanic.
CONCLUSIONS:  Based   on   available   data,   [Applicant’s]  mental   health
conditions  do   not  presently  impair   his  willingness  or  ability  to   safeguard
classified  information. Additionally, given  the  data  he  reported  is accurate,
the   risk of an  exacerbation   of   symptoms  seems to  be   low  at  this point   in
time.  However,  [he] has a  demonstrated  pattern of rule-violating  behavior,
poor  judgment,   and   dishonesty  that   could   reasonably   and   significantly
diminish   his  trustworthiness  and   judgment  in   a   national  security  context.
(GE 4 at 9-10)
SOR  ¶¶  2.b  and  2.c  allege  in  November  2012,  Applicant  was  involuntarily
committed  for mental-health  treatment,  and in  January 2013, Applicant  was  voluntarily
admitted  for  mental-health  treatment.  At  his  hearing,  Applicant  said  he  had  suicidal
ideations. (Tr. 69) He was an inpatient for about 14 days in November 2012, and he said
his treatment was outpatient in January 2013. (Tr. 68)
In   2012,  Applicant   was  diagnosed   with   ulcerative   colitis,  and   he   lost   about  35
pounds.  (Tr. 22)  He was unable  to  complete  physical activity,  and  his  former spouse  was
not   letting   him   see   his  children.  (Tr.   23)   He  became   extremely  depressed.   (Tr.  23)
Applicant’s father called Applicant’s supervisor and insisted that he receive help. (Tr. 24)
The  VA  is currently treating  him  for bipolar disorder. (Tr. 60) He sees a  VA  psychiatrist
once  every  three  months. (Tr. 60)  He  takes lithium twice  a  day.  (Tr. 61)  He did not  provide
any  VA   medical  treatment  records  to   corroborate   his  statements   about  consistently
receiving counseling and treatment.
I note that Applicant told Dr. E that he had a three-year-old daughter with Ms. G.
(Tr. 38) At his hearing, he said he misspoke. (Tr. 38) He said Ms. G had a daughter, and
he was not her father. (Tr. 39) He told Dr. E that he was accepting her as his daughter.
(Tr. 39)
Applicant  did   not  submit  any  documentation   contradicting   Dr.  E’s  opinions  and
conclusions. In  support  of his denial of SOR ¶¶  2.a, 2.b, and  2.c in his SOR response, he
asserted   he   supported   his  inpatient  treatment  when   he   asked   his  father  for  help,  and
therefore, it was not really involuntary. He said  Dr. E’s conclusions were probably based
on  the  allegations of others and  probably incorrect.  He is feeling  much  better now than
he felt in  2012.
Handling Protected Information  and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges Applicant improperly stored sensitive aircraft information on his
personal computer in about July 2010. He left the computer in the unsupervised custody
of a Peruvian national. On October 25, 2012, a special agent from the NCIS questioned
him, and he said he could not remember whether any information on his computer was
classified; however, he  confirmed  his computer had  sensitive aircraft  information on  it.
SOR ¶ 4.a cross-alleges the allegation in SOR ¶ 3.a under Guideline E.
On August 25, 2012, Applicant made a sworn written statement to the NCIS which
states Ms. G had a friend from Miami. (GE 3 at 6) He said:
Her  friend   spoke   English,   German,  and   Spanish.   I  don’t   remember  her
name. I never took her to  the  base. I left a  personal [laptop  computer] in her
custody. On  that laptop  was aircraft maintenance  records . .  .  and  email
traffic pertaining  to  the  aircraft.  I   don’t think that the   maintenance  records
were classified  but I am not sure about some of the  emails. (GE 3  at 6)
At his hearing, Applicant said he gave his laptop computer to Ms. G, and he never
tried to get it back from her. (Tr. 61) There was one Navy maintenance status report and
one email on his computer; however, the documents were not sensitive or classified. (Tr.
58, 61-62, 70)
On November 7, 2012, the NCIS briefed a legal officer about Applicant’s alleged
actions relating to Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violation of an
order and Article 107, UCMJ for making a false statement. (GE 3 at 4) The NCIS report
indicates Applicant would be offered a captain’s mast. (Id.) The NCIS report also indicates
Applicant had been “Baker acted and spent 10 days in [a] mental health facility.” (Id. at 3)
Applicant said in January 2013, a summary court-martial (SCM) acquitted him of
violations  of  Article  92,  UCMJ  for  disobedience  of  an  order and  Article  107,  UCMJ  for
making a false statement. (Tr. 27-28, 62, 66) After his hearing, Applicant made a diligent
effort  to  locate  information  from  the  SCM;  however,  he  was  unable  to  obtain  any
documentation from his SCM. (Tr. 63; AE B) Section 15 Military History-- Discipline of his
May 5, 2018 SCA asks, “In the last 7years have you been subject to court-martial or other
disciplinary procedure under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), such as Article
15, [c]aptain’s mast, Article 135 Court of inquiry, etc.?” (GE 1 at 21) He answered, “No.”
(Id.) However, he did disclose on his SCA that he “went to a disciplinary review board”
based  on  issues  stemming  from  ulcerative  colitis  and  physical  fitness  training.  At  his
hearing, he did not know why he failed to list his SCM in his 2018 SCA. (Tr. 63-65) The
failure to disclose information about his SCM in his 2018 SCA and his OPM PSI were not
alleged in the SOR. (GE 1 at 21; GE 2 at 10)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 4.c alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his  personal travel to
Peru to his command while he was on active duty.
The NCIS investigation states Applicant, “disclosed he has been taking secret trips
to Peru to see his wife, [Ms. G], and that he had failed to report his close relationship to
a foreign national to his security manager.” (GE 3 at 4) In his sworn statement to NCIS
he said:
Since JUL 10, I have  been to Peru three  times. I went in DEC 10, MAR 11,
DEC 11, and most recently on  27 MAR 12 which is when I  married  her. On
all  of these  occasions I just  took leave  and  left  the  country. I did not  notify
my  command  or my   security  officer. I did not  get   a  threat  brief   nor was  I
debriefed  upon  my return. (GE 3 at 6)
Later in his sworn statement he said a special agent showed him a list of his seven
trips to Peru, Applicant said “That appears accurate. I did not tell my command about any
of these trips. They were personal trips, and I used my blue passport.” (GE 3 at 7)
Applicant said he  did  not inform  one  command  that  he  was  traveling  to  Peru. (Tr.
42) He said he  submitted  leave  papers to  his squadron  that he  was going  to  Peru, and  he
received  a  threat briefing  from  that command  before traveling  to  Peru. (Tr. 42-46) He said
he  told the  NCIS  he  did  not inform  his command  or security of his travel  to  Peru  on  those
four occasions. (Tr. 43; GE  3  at 6) He said he  made  this statement to  NCIS  because  he
“had  no  fight left [in] me,” and  he  was “beaten  down.” (Tr. 43-44, 46)  He did not provide
copies of the  leave  forms to  corroborate  his claims  that he  informed  his command  of his
trips to Peru before he  took them.
SOR ¶ 4.d alleges Applicant made a false statement to his command on October
25, 2012, when he said he was married to a Peruvian national over the telephone by the
America Embassy. In fact, he flew to Peru for the wedding. He admitted to the NCIS that
he made  a false  statement  to his command  about  getting married over the  telephone.
(GE 3 at 8) He said he “thought [he] would get in trouble if the command found out [he]
had gone to Peru without going through the proper procedures.” (Tr. 53; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 4.e alleges Applicant made a false statement to military investigators during
his  October  25,  2012  personal  subject  interview  (PSI).  He  falsely  said  he  was  being
extorted  by  a  Peruvian  national  (Ms.  G).  He  subsequently  admitted  this  was  false.  He
said he had married this individual, and he was voluntarily sending her money.
Applicant’s October 25, 2012 statement to NCIS investigators indicates he told two
senior  petty  officers  that  Ms.  G  threatened  him  by  telling  him  that  unless  he  provided
funds to her she would get a friend of hers from another part of the state where he lived
to come to his location and hurt him and his family. (GE 3 at 8) He told the NCIS that Ms.
G demanded $2,000 from him, and when he expressed reluctance to give her the money,
“she said that she had friends [living in the same state where he lived] and they could find
[him] which [he] understood to be a threat.” (Id. at 6) The NCIS statement states, “Also in
the above paragraphs I was not truthful with Agents . . . about being extorted by [Ms. G].”
(Id. at 8) Applicant admitted that his story about being extorted was a lie. (Id.)
At his hearing, Applicant said a senior chief petty officer (SCPO) suggested to him
that he was being extorted by a woman in Peru, and Applicant said he told the SCPO this
was incorrect. (Tr. 49) The SCPO or possibly someone else evidently told the NCIS about
the extortion. (Tr. 49, 51-52) Applicant initially told the NCIS that Ms. G attempted to extort
money from him; however, he said his sworn statement to the NCIS about his making the
initial claim to the senior petty officers was incorrect. (Tr. 47-49)
SOR ¶¶ 4.f through 4.j alleges Applicant falsified material facts on his May 5, 2018
SCA in five different places:
¶   4.f—In  Section  17,  Marital/Relationship  Status,  Applicant  stated  his  current
marital status was “Divorced/Dissolved” (which referred to his first wife, not Ms. G) and
thereby deliberately failed to disclose he was married to a Peruvian national (Ms. G). In
Section 17 of his SCA, Applicant disclosed his first marriage and divorce. (GE 1 at 23) He
indicated his current marital status was “Divorced/Dissolved.” (Id.)
¶  4.g—In Section 19, Foreign Contacts, Applicant listed Ms. G as a former friend
who he last contacted in June 2016, and he failed to disclose his marriage and birth of
his  child.  (GE  1  at  26-27)  In  response  to  the  question  “Personal  (such  as  family  ties,
friendship, affection, common interests, etc.),” he said “Friendship.” (Id. at 27) Applicant
admitted  he  failed  to  disclose  his  marriage  to  Ms.  G;  however,  he  said  he  had  not
communicated with her for about two years at the time he completed his SCA. (Tr. 54)
The question did not specifically ask whether he had ever been married to Ms. G, and
this allegation is found for Applicant.
¶  4.h—Section 20A, Foreign Activities, asked Applicant, “Have you EVER provided
financial support for any foreign national?” (GE 1 at 28) Applicant answered, “No,” and he
failed  to  disclose  sending  about  $21,000  to  a  Peruvian  national  (Ms.  G)  between
September 2011 and October 2012.
Applicant admitted sending $600 to $700 monthly to Ms. G starting in September
2011. (Tr. 46) In 2012, he sent about $17,000 to Ms. G, and she gave some of it to family
and  friends.  (Tr.  47,  50;  GE  3  at  6)  Applicant  had  to  work  a  second  job  to  afford  his
payments to Ms. G. (Tr. 51) He said he did not know why he failed to disclose the funds
he sent to Ms. G on his SCA. (Tr. 55)
¶   4.i—Section  20C,  Foreign  Travel,  asked  Applicant  about  foreign  travel  in  the
previous seven years (the SCA is dated May 5, 2018). Applicant disclosed a single foreign
trip to Peru in May to June 2013, and he failed to disclose four additional foreign trips to
Peru in December 2011, and March 2012. (GE 1 at 30) At his hearing, he admitted he
traveled to Peru during December 2011, and March 2012, and he said he should have
disclosed the trips. (Tr. 42, 55) He said he did not remember why he failed to disclose the
trips two to Peru on his SCA. (Tr. 56-57)
¶   4.j—Section  21,  Psychological  and  Emotional  Health  –  Hospitalized,  asked
“Have you EVER been hospitalized for a mental health condition?” (GE 1 at 32) Applicant
answered,  “No.”  (Id.)  He  admitted  that  he  failed  to  disclose  the  hospitalization  in
November  2012  for  his  mental  health  condition.  At  his  hearing,  he  said  he  did  not
remember why he did not disclose his hospitalizations for psychological and emotional
health on his SCA. (Tr. 56)
SOR ¶  4.k alleges Applicant falsified material facts during his July 16, 2018 OPM
PSI, and SOR ¶¶ 4.l through 4.o allege he falsified material facts during his October 12,
2018 OPM PSI in four different ways:
¶  4.k states  Applicant said he  had  no  contact with  Ms. G  since  “shortly after”  his
May 2013  trip  to  Peru.  Applicant  told  the  OPM  investigator that  he  broke  up  with  Ms.  G
shortly after May  2013 and  he  had not  had any contact with  her since  this  time. (GE  2  at
6) In  the  follow-up OPM  PSI  on  October 12, 2018, he  said  he  had  “not had  any contact
with her since 6/2016.” (GE  2  at 11)
¶ 4.l states Applicant denied that he failed to report his personal travel to  Peru, as
required,  and  thereby  deliberately failed  to  disclose  that  information  in  SOR ¶¶  4.c  and
4.d.  His OPM  PSI states that he  did not bring  his passport to  the  interview. (GE 2  at 10)
The OPM  PSI states:
Subject was confronted with failing to report leaving the country and going
to  Peru  to  visit  a  Peruvian  woman  to  his  security  manager  (Discrepant).
Subject denies this failure and stated he listed Peru, the only trip that he
had  was  in  2010  and  2011  for  short  trips  with  the  military  on  official
government business. (GE 2 at 10)
At  his  hearing,  he  said  he  should  have  reported  the  additional  trips  to  Peru;
however, he was only thinking about the trip in January 2013. (Tr. 55) He also said he did
not remember why he failed to disclose the trips to Peru. (Tr. 56-57)
¶   4.m   states  Applicant  repeatedly  denied   his  March  2012   marriage   to   Ms.  G.
Applicant’s July 16, 2018 OPM  PSI states:
Subject was confronted with 9/2011 sending money to a Peruvian associate
who  he  married  in  3/2012  in  the  amount  $600-$700  and  after  they  were
married, he increased the amount to $2,000-$3,000. Subject stated he did
send listed foreign contact [Ms. G] money to help her family. But never felt
this was reason to report because he looked at it as helping a friend and not
supporting  a  foreign  national.  He  did  not  know  there  was  an  issue  with
helping a friend who was a foreign national. He continued to deny that he
was ever married to her or any foreign national.
At his hearing, he admitted that he failed to disclose his marriage to Ms. G. to the
OPM investigator during his PSI. (Tr. 54) He said he could not remember what he was
thinking at the time he made that statement to the investigator. (Tr. 58)
¶  4.n  states  Applicant  denied  having  ever been  involuntarily committed  to  a  mental-
health  facility.  The  OPM  PSI indicates he  volunteered  for mental health  treatment,  and  he
denied  that he  received  involuntary treatment  or that he  was “Baker acted.” (GE 2  at 11)
He said he  was diagnosed  with  bipolar disorder since  September 2011, and  he  was seen
at  the   VA   hospital.  (Id.  at  14)  He  was  not  prescribed   any  medication   and   he   did  not
regularly see a  provider or counselor. (Id.)
¶   4.o  states  Applicant  denied  having  ever  “been  involved  in,  suspected  of,  or
accused of the improper handling or compromise of sensitive, classified, or proprietary
information.” The OPM PSI indicates he said:
[He]  has  never  provided   anyone   with   anything   which   was  not  entirely  in
keeping   with   regulations.  [He]   has  not   had   any  occasions   in  which  his
actions   could   have   possibly  resulted   in   a   compromise   of   his  duties  or  a
compromise  of  sensitive   or  classified   information.  [He]  has  never  been
involved   in,   suspected   of,  or  accused   of   the   improper  handling   or
compromise   of  sensitive,  classified,   or  proprietary  information.  (GE   12   at
13)
Applicant’s father is a retired Air Force colonel who completed 30 years of service.
(Tr. 23) His father’s statement indicates Applicant was diagnosed with leukemia when he
was  three years old  and  received  chemotherapy  on multiple occasions  for  32 months.
(AE A) When Applicant was 19 years old, he attempted to join the Air Force; however, he
was  unable  to enlist  in  the Air Force  because  of  his previous medical  history. (Id.) He
successfully enlisted in the Navy. He served in the Navy for 20 years, and on April 30,
2013, he honorably retired after being acquitted at a SCM in January 2013.
His father said that  Applicant “is currently in  a  good  mental  place. Clearly, the  meds
are working  .  .  . [I]n mid-2018, he  quickly improved from his  mental position, because  he
was being  treated  by the  VA. And  during  that  treatment,  he  really rapidly improved.” (Tr.
25)  He concluded  Applicant’s mistakes in his  statement to  the  NCIS  occurred  because
“He  was both  mentally  and  physically, absolutely wiped  out.  And, when  you’re  in those
situations, you’re not thinking clearly. And  he was not thinking clearly. And, based on Dr.
[E’s] comments,  it’s clear to  me  that he  believes [Applicant]  has  moved  beyond  that state
of  mind.”  (Tr.  31)  His  mental  health   has   dramatically   improved   since   the   time   he   was
receiving  inpatient mental-health  treatment. (Tr. 33) His father said,  “he’s  completely in a
different state  of mind than  he was at that point in time.” (Tr. 33)
Applicant received the following Navy awards: Navy Achievement Medal (6); Joint
Meritorious Unit Award (2); Good Conduct Medal (6); National Defense Service Medal
(2); Navy “E” Ribbon; Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (2); Global War on Terrorism
Service  Medal;  Global  War  on  Terrorism  Expeditionary  Medal;  Armed  Forces  Service
Medal;  Sea  Service  Deployment  Ribbon  (6);  Navy  Recruiting  Ribbon;  United  Nations
Medal; Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon; and EAWS Insignia. (SOR response, DD Form 214)
",True
"In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d and denied
SOR  ¶¶  1.a-2.a.  He  is  57  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  1985,  and  he
earned a bachelor’s degree in 1990 and a master’s degree in 2018. He married in 1995,
divorced  in  2020,  and  remarried  in  2022.  He  has  a  25-year-old  son  from  his  previous
marriage, and he still considers his 31-year-old stepdaughter from his previous marriage
his child, despite their limited relationship. He resides in state A. (Tr. 33-35, 37, 73-74,
146-148, 154-157; GE 1-3; AE A, J, M, P, Q)
Applicant  commissioned   in   the   U.S.   military   upon   graduating   from   college.  He
served  honorably  from  May  1990  to  April  2011, to  include  deployments to  Haiti,  Bosnia,
and   Afghanistan,  and   he   retired   as  a   lieutenant  colonel.   He   was  subsequently
unemployed   until   November  2011.   He   has   since   worked   for  various  DOD  contractors,
except   for  additional  periods  of  unemployment  from   November   2016   to   June   2017,
September 2018  to  December 2018,  and  since  approximately September  2020. As  of the
date   of  the   hearing,  he   had   an   offer  of  employment  with   a   DOD   contractor  that  was
contingent  on  obtaining  a  security clearance.  He was first granted  a  clearance  when  he
served in the U.S. military, and  his clearance  was suspended  in  September 2020.  (Tr. 9-
11, 35-37, 42, 50-51, 77-78, 151-152, 157-158; GE  1-3, 5-6; AE J, R, T)
Personal Conduct
In 1995, Applicant was charged with simple assault. On the night of his bachelor
party,  he  got  into  a  physical  altercation  with  a  fraternity  brother.  They  resolved  their
conflict and remained friends. Unbeknownst to them, the charge remained pending in the
court system until Applicant’s friend requested its dismissal in 2012. (Tr. 37-41; AE L)
Prior  to  deploying  to  Bosnia,  Applicant  had  a  verbal  disagreement  with  another
soldier in 2002. The soldier pushed him, and he choked the soldier to get the soldier out
of his way. He reported the incident to his superior, and he was not disciplined for this
incident. (Tr. 140-144; AE J)
In  August  2002,  while  deployed  to  Bosnia,  Applicant  was  the  subject  of  an
investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division for aggravated assault. He was
on patrol with his team as the communications officer when some of the communications
failed.  He  returned  to  the  military  base  and  immediately  approached  the  desk  of  the
civilian  contractor,  who  was  the  lead  communications  help  desk  technician,  to  try  to
troubleshoot the issues. He denied pulling his weapon from his holster, pointing it at, and
verbally  threatening  this  individual.  Because  he  breached  protocol  by  not  properly
disarming his weapon upon returning to the base and approaching this individual’s desk,
he disassembled it on  the  “help  desk  ledge.”  He did  so  while he  was  having  a heated
conversation with this individual wherein profanity was exchanged, and he warned that
he would elevate the communications failures to the individual’s supervisor. (SOR ¶ 1.d;
Tr. 41-50, 131-140, 158-163, 170-172; GE 2-3, 6, 8; AE J)
Applicant testified that he recognized how his act of disassembling his weapon on
the help desk technician’s ledge while they were having a heated conversation could have
been perceived by this individual as an intimidation tactic or threat, but he stated that such
was not his intention. He and this individual had previous and reoccurring  conflict with
each other. He recalled later apologizing to this individual and voluntarily surrendering his
weapon during the remaining two to three weeks of his deployment as an act of good
faith. He was not court-martialed, he did not receive an Article 15 non-judicial punishment,
he was not administratively reprimanded or counseled, and this incident did not have a
negative impact on his military career. (Tr. 41-50, 131-140, 158-163, 170-172; GE 2-3, 6,
8; AE J)
In  February 2015, Applicant  was arrested  in state  C  and  charged  with  felony gun
possession   on   education   property,  misdemeanor  assault  by  pointing   a   gun,   and
misdemeanor  communicating  threats.  Between  2003  and  2005,  he  had  purchased  from
the  military post  exchange   several firearms  for which   he   had  a   non-residence   conceal
and  carry permit from  state  B.  The  morning  of his arrest  in 2015, he  intended  to  go  to  the
firing   range   with   one   of  his  firearms,  so   he   disassembled   it   and   put  it,   along   with   one
magazine,  in  a   case   that  he   then   put  in   the   trunk  of  his  car.  He  also  put  a   separate
magazine  and ammunition  in  the  trunk of his car, as they  would  not fit in his  case. When
he  went back inside  his  home  to  say good-bye  to  his then  spouse, she  was crying  on  the
phone   with   his  stepdaughter,  who   was  attending   college   in  state   C.  Concerned   about
reports  that   his  stepdaughter  was  having   loud   parties,  drinking   excessively,  and   using
drugs, he  changed  his plans  at his then  spouse’s request  and  drove  from  state  A  to  state
C  to  bring  his stepdaughter home. He mistakenly did not  think to  remove  his firearm  from
the trunk of his car beforehand. (SOR ¶ 1.c;  Tr. 51-62, 78-100, 163-167, 169-170; GE  1-
3, 5-6; AE E-H, J)
Applicant’s  stepdaughter  refused  to  cooperate  with  him  when  he  arrived  at  her
apartment in state C. He decided to retrieve her things from her car, put them in his car,
and  park  her  car  at  his  friend’s  house  for  him  to  retrieve  later.  As  he  was  putting  her
belongings in his car, her girlfriend saw his firearm, which had fallen out of its case that
opened during his drive from state A to state C, as he was attempting to put it back in its
case. They got into a heated exchange, and he decided to leave and drive to his friend’s
house. (Tr. 51-62, 78-100, 163-167, 169-170; GE 1-3, 5-6; AE E-H, J)
As Applicant drove to his friend’s house, his then spouse called and told him that
the  police  were  looking  for  him.  His  stepdaughter’s  girlfriend  reported  that  he  “had
threatened her by pointing a firearm at her and saying I was going to blow her head off or
something to that extent,” which he denied. He reacted to this news “very poorly.” He did
not want to have any issues with the police, and although he had a firearm permit for state
B, he did not remember that state C had reciprocity with state B for concealed handguns.
He drove into a parking lot that he did not know was on educational property, he loaded
his firearm with one of the magazines, and he hid it along with the additional magazine
and ammunition under a bush. He stated that he loaded the firearm because he “was just
putting it all together just to get all the evidence out of the car.” The police pulled him over
as he was driving to his friend’s house, and when they questioned him about whether he
had a firearm, he replied that he did not. They put him in the police car, searched his car,
and drove him to his stepdaughter’s apartment for identification. There, they asked him
where  his gun  was,  and  he  cooperated  and took them to the location  where  he  had  it
hidden. The police recovered his gun, arrested and charged him, and he was released
on bail. The charges were voluntarily dismissed in March 2015 and expunged in February
2016. (Tr. 51-62, 78-100, 163-167, 169-170; GE 1-3, 5-6; AE E-H, J)
In April 2017, Applicant was in a physical altercation with his then spouse. They
consumed alcohol at a friend’s home earlier that evening and got into an argument upon
their arrival at home. When their argument escalated, she struck him across his chest,
threw her cell phone at him, and hit him in the back as he walked away. He turned and
punched  her  in  the  face,  causing  her  to  suffer  an orbital fracture.  No  criminal  charges
were filed against him. (SOR ¶ 1.b; Tr. 62-67, 116-117, 119-126, 149-151, 155, 170-172;
GE 2-3, 5-6; AE C, D, J, K, M, T) He testified:
[U]nder  no  circumstances should  a  man  ever hit  a  woman,  no  matter what
the  situation  is. No mater what the  situation, you  still  have  the  choice to  walk
away.  I did not   exercise  my choice   to   do  so.  I’m  extremely remorseful for
what I did. (Tr. 64)
This  incident  led  to  a  two-to-three-week period of  separation between Applicant
and his then spouse. He voluntarily took a 16-hour anger management class in April 2017,
through which he learned coping skills and methods to de-escalate a situation. At his then
spouse’s request, he surrendered his firearms to the police and sought an evaluation from
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to determine if he suffered from PTSD. He
saw a VA doctor once, and he was not given a diagnosis. He also obtained a referral from
his general practitioner for a psychiatrist, whom he saw six to seven times over the course
of  four  to  five  weeks  in  June  or  July  2017.  This  psychiatrist  also  did  not  give  him  a
diagnosis. He and his then spouse also attended marriage counseling, which he found
useful. (Tr. 62-67, 71-72, 116-117, 119-126, 149-151, 155, 170-175; GE 2-3, 5-6; AE C,
D, J, K, M, T) He testified:
I found  out there were  tools and  things that I  could use  to  understand  the
situation  better  and  to better approach  situations when they  do  get heated:
one, just walk, disengage; everything  doesn’t need  to  be  resolved  right then
and  there; let cool heads prevail, things of that nature. (Tr. 65)
In   approximately  2018,  Applicant   and   his  then   spouse   had   multiple  occasions
where  their   son   was  “.  .  .  very  disrespectful,  using   profanity,  and   .  .  .  yelling,”  having
removed  him  from  college  because  of poor grades, alcohol consumption,  and  drug  use.
(Tr. 146)  Applicant  recalled  one  incident  where  his  son  “struck  me  in  the  face  with  a  closed
fist,” and  another incident where  his son  “pulled  knife  out on  me  asking  to  fight. So, I took
him  and  pushed  him  against  a  wall, and  I asked  him  to   . . . leave  the  house.” His then
spouse  took their  son  and stayed  with  him  at her daughter’s apartment for a  couple of
days. His son  was diagnosed  with  bipolar disorder in 2021  or 2022. (Tr. 73, 146-147, 155-
157)
In  July  2019,  Applicant  engaged  in  another  altercation  with  his  then  spouse.  In
2018, he replaced the firearms that he had previously surrendered, and on the morning
of July 2019, he worked on one of his firearms in his garage. He subsequently placed the
firearm on a counter inside the home. When his then spouse finished preparing dinner
that evening, he secured the firearm in an upstairs safe. He denied having left the firearm
in his garage and stated that his then spouse saw him take the firearm upstairs to secure
it.  Over  dinner,  they  argued  about  an  invitation  to  attend  a  neighbor’s  cookout.  She
wanted to attend but he did not, as he no longer desired that kind of environment and did
not like that this neighbor had previously made disparaging comments about her. Their
argument continued as she followed him when he returned to his garage to work on one
of his cars. (SOR ¶ 1.a; Tr. 66-71, 100-119, 122-123, 155-156, 167-172; GE 2-3, 6-7; AE
B, J) He testified:
We  were  in the  garage  initially. I did break the  antenna  off of a  joint  on  the
car that we both  owned, and  I threw it out the  garage. And  I did kick the  car
tire,  the  actual rubber that touches the  road. Both  are very immature actions.
(Tr. 69)
Applicant’s then  spouse  called  the  police  and  reported  that  he  struck her  with  an
antenna   and   pointed   a   firearm   at  her,  which   he   denied.  He   was  not  arrested,   and   no
criminal charges  were  filed  against him.  Early  the  next morning,  the  sheriff’s department
served  him  with  a  temporary  48-hour  restraining  order  that  was subsequently extended
for an  additional  week. He  surrendered  his  firearms  as required  by  the  order.   His then
spouse  also  filed  for divorce, at which  point she  pressed  charges against  him  for second-
degree  assault  and malicious destruction  of  property  and  obtained a  one-year protective
order against  him.   He   was  ordered   to   pay   for  the   property  damage,  the   charges   were
dropped, and  the  records pertaining  to  this incident were  expunged  in  August 2020. After
their  requisite  one-year period  of separation, their  divorce  was finalized  in 2020. (Tr. 66-
71,100-119, 122-123, 155-156, 167-172; GE  2-3, 6-7; AE B, J)
Since 2019, Applicant has not faced any other allegations of misconduct. He is not
prohibited from owning firearms. Applicant’s son moved in with him during the period in
which he and his then spouse were separated and going through divorce proceedings.
Applicant  helped  his  son  enroll  in  school,  get  his  driver’s  license,  and  attend  church.
Although  his  son  lived  with  his  ex-spouse  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant
described his relationship with his son as a healthy one. He has a limited relationship with
his stepdaughter, due to her unfounded rape allegations against him during the divorce
proceedings. Although Applicant and his spouse have disagreements, he stated that they
do not compare to those he had with his ex-spouse, to which he credits his spouse’s calm
demeanor, their marriage, and his spirituality. (Tr. 74, 146-148, 157, 168-169, 171-172;
AE N-O)
Applicant stated:
Simply put,  I’m  a  changed  man. I acknowledged  the  mistakes that I did.  I
realized  that  I  was in  a  volatile  marriage,  didn’t want  to  admit  it at the  time.
Being  [a  military] officer, we try to  fix everything. Everything  is repairable.
We  can  always solve  every mission,  and  I  put that  attitude,  looking  back,
took that same  approach  into my marriage. It can be  repaired. That can be
repaired.  And  I  just  refused  to  believe  that  some  things  are  irreparable.  And
that  applied   to   my  marriage.  I  found   Christ.   I  found   other  coping
mechanisms. I’ve  changed. I  no  longer get upset  for  the  things  that will   --
would  normally  get  me   angry  or  out  of  character,  and   I’ve   learned   to   be
better in control of me  and  everything is truly not that important. (Tr. 72-73)
Psychological  Conditions
In  December  2010  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  the  VA  in  connection  with  his
disability claim. (Tr. 71-72, 125-129, 172-175; GE 2) A VA examiner diagnosed him with
adjustment disorder in June 2011, but noted that there was “no evidence of permanent
residual or chronic disability shown” and his symptoms were not consistent with PTSD.
(AE  T)  The  VA  consequently  denied  his  “[s]ervice  connection  for  adjustment  disorder
(claimed as [PTSD]),” but found that he was entitled to treatment because an adjustment
disorder was diagnosed within the requisite time. (AE T)
As  previously discussed,  Applicant  sought  an   evaluation   from   the   VA   at  his ex-
spouse’s request after the  incident in  April 2017, to  determine  if he  suffered  from  PTSD.
He also saw a  psychiatrist in June  or July 2017. He  was not  given  a  diagnosis  on  either
occasion. (Tr. 62-67, 71-72, 116-117, 119-126, 149-151, 172-175; GE  2-3, 5-6; AE  C, D,
J, K, M, T)
In March 2018, Applicant was again evaluated by the VA, in connection with  his
claim for increased evaluation. (Tr. 71-72, 125-129, 172-175; GE 2) The VA again denied
his “[s]ervice  connection  for adjustment disorder (claimed  as PTSD),” after finding  that
the  treatment  records  submitted  by  him  in  connection  with  his  2018  claim  did  not
constitute new and material evidence. (AE T) As of the date of the hearing, he has had a
100% disability rating from the VA since 2021, but not on the basis of any mental health
condition. (Tr. 126-127, 172-175)
In  July  2021,  the  DOD  CAF,  renamed  the  Defense  Counterintelligence  and
Security  Agency  on  June  13,  2022,  referred  Applicant  for  evaluation  by  a  licensed
psychologist  (PSYCH  1)  because  evidence  of  a  history  of  mental  health  conditions
requiring
treatment  was  discovered  during  his  security  clearance  background
investigation. (SOR ¶ 2.a; Tr. 148-149; GE 3) PSYCH 1 conducted her evaluation on July
8, 2021, and she reported her findings on July 18, 2021. PSYCH 1 stated, as the basis
for her opinion, that “[Applicant] has an extensive history of criminal behavior and legal
involvement  since  the  1990s.  Additionally,  there  is  evidence  that  he  has  a  pattern  of
brandishing  guns  and  becoming  violent  [and]  aggressive  when  he  is  upset.”  (GE  3)
PSYCH  1  also  stated  that  her  evaluation  included  “review  of  background  information,
including medical and mental health  treatment records provided by the DOD CAF” and
“[a]dditional  data  was  collected  via  clinical  interview,  testing  observations,  and
administration of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).” (Tr. 148-149; GE 3)
PSYCH 1 provided the following diagnostic impressions and prognosis:
Based   solely  on   [Applicant’s]  self-report,  it  would  seem   that  he   does  not
currently  meet   criteria   for  any  diagnosable  mental  health   conditions.
However, when  considering  background  information,  clinical interview and
observations,  and  objective  personality  assessment,  his diagnostic profile
is as follows:
309.81
V62.22
V62.5
[PTSD]
Personal history of Military Deployment
Problems Related to Other Legal Circumstances
While   it  is  challenging   to   conclusively   diagnose   PTSD  in   a   one-time
evaluation, particularly if there is no  supporting  medical history, [Applicant’s]
background  history is noteworthy  for extensive criminal conduct and  violent
behavior. Since  the  1990s, he  has demonstrated  1) irritable behavior and
angry  outbursts;  2)  reckless  behaviors;   and   3)  dissociative   reactions  in
which  he  acts  as  if the  traumatic event were recurring.  These  behaviors are
symptomatic of PTSD and  have  clearly negatively  impacted  his social and
occupational functioning. (GE 3)
PSYCH 1 concluded:
[Applicant’s]  behavioral  health   history  suggests  several  behaviors,   which
cast doubt  on  his judgment,  reliability and/or trustworthiness. His  history of
interpersonal  volatility  and  legal involvement is concerning,  and  his  limited
insight and  pattern of grandiosity (in  speech,  thought, and  behavior) may
indicate  a  poor prognosis. Despite  claims that  he  and  his ex-spouse  are on
amicable  terms  and   a   judge   awarded   him   physical  custody  of  their  son,
these  claims could not be  independently verified  and  court records indicate
that  his [ex-]wife  extended  the  no-contact  protective  order  through  at least
July 2020.  Given  the  recent  nature  of  [Applicant’s] issues,  and  the  fact that
he  lacks  the  requisite  insight  and  treatment to  reduce  the  likelihood  of future
violent  behavior,  it  may  be   imprudent  to   grant  him   access  to   classified
information. (GE  3)
Applicant was evaluated by another licensed psychologist (PSYCH 2) in January
2023, on the advice of his attorney. PSYCH 2 stated that her evaluation included review
of the SOR; PSYCH 1’s July 18, 2021 summary of psychological evaluation; Applicant’s
January  19,  2022  response  to  interrogatories;  and  “[m]iscellaneous  records  from
[Applicant’s] background investigation.” (Tr. 123-131, 134-139, 152-154; AE I-J) PSYCH
2  also  stated  that  additional  data  was  collected  via  “semi-structured  clinical  interview,
observations,  and  administration  of  objective  personality  measure,  the  .  .  .  [PAI]  ,  and
subjective  report of  symptoms  .  .  .  .”  (Tr.  123-131,  134-139,  152-154;  AE  J)  Applicant
acknowledged that PSYCH 2 did not speak with any of his family or friends, to include his
ex-spouse. (Tr. 153-154)
PSYCH  2  stated  that Applicant “does not appear to  meet diagnostic criteria  for any
mental health  conditions at this time,” and  she  concluded  that Applicant does not currently
have  a  mental health  diagnosis that  could cast doubt  on  his  reliability, trustworthiness,
judgment,   or ability  to   safeguard  sensitive   or   classified   information.   (Tr.  123-131,   134-
139; AE J) PSYCH 2  stated:
I did not  find  evidence  to  support a  diagnosis of  [PTSD]. While  [Applicant]
has a  history of military deployment,  this does not independently cause  a
mental  health   condition.  Additionally,  although   Applicant  did  endorse  a
number  of  individual   items  within  his  PAI  that  elevated   a   subscale
commensurate  with  traumatic events, upon  further evaluation  of  those  items
one  finds  reflection  of  reactions commensurate  with  frustration  noted  above
related  to  his relationship with  his ex-wife  and  the  process  that led  to  him
losing his security clearance. . . . (AE J)
Applicant’s 1995 simple assault charge, 2002 verbal and physical altercation with
a soldier, 2011 adjustment disorder diagnosis by the VA, and 2018 physical altercation
with his son were not alleged in the SOR, so they may not be an independent basis for
revoking Applicant’s clearance. However, I may consider them to evaluate his credibility;
to evaluate his evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to decide
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide
evidence  for  the  whole-person  analysis.  I  have  considered  these  unalleged  events  for
these limited purposes.
Applicant  received   numerous  certificates  and   medals,   to   include   a   Meritorious
Service   Medal  for  his  service   in  Bosnia,   a  Bronze   Star  Medal   for  his  service   in
Afghanistan,  and  a  Legion  of Merit medal upon  his military retirement  for exceptionally
meritorious  service. (Tr. 50-51, 144-146; AE  J, R)  He volunteers in his community.  (AE
S)  Numerous   character  references,   to   include   individuals  who   have   known   Applicant
since their service in the U.S. military and who have remained  close  friends, vouched for
his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. (AE M) His officer evaluation reports reflect
outstanding performance in the U.S. military. (Tr. 49-50; AE R)
",False
"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through 1.c. She denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.d with explanation. Her admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 33-year-old lead custodian employed by a defense contractor since
August  2018.  She  previously  worked  as  a  custodian  for  the  same  company  from  May
2010 to May 2015. She has also been employed as a caregiver, solution provider for a
telecommunications company, and worked in a chicken plant. She was unemployed from
June 2008 to April 2010, May 2015 to October 2017, and February 2018 to May 2018.
She held a security clearance from 2011 to 2015. (Tr. 18, 69-72; GE 1 at 7, 12-19)
Applicant  married  in November 2006, separated  in September 2008, and  filed  for
divorce  in May 2023. She  has cohabitated  with  a  boyfriend  since  February 2018. She  has
three  children  ages, 16, 15  and  7. She  completed  the  10th  grade  and  has taken  some
GED classes but has not completed her GED. (Tr. 29-33, 69; GE 1, GE 2)
The  SOR  alleges  that:  (1)  in  about  October  2015,  Applicant  was  involuntarily
hospitalized,  received  treatment  for  psychosis,  and  was  diagnosed  with  Personality
Disorder NOS and Stimulant Disorder (SOR ¶ 1.a); (2) in about December 2015, she was
referred  for  outpatient  mental  health  counselling,  diagnosed  with  Personality  Disorder
NOS and Stimulant Disorder, and that she discontinued mental health treatment in about
October 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.b); (3) in about May 2016 she was voluntarily hospitalized and
diagnosed  with  Bipolar  Disorder  I  (SOR  ¶  1.c),  and  (4)  that  in  January  2022,  a
psychologist doing an evaluation for the DoD CAF diagnosed her with Bipolar Disorder I
and a history of Stimulus disorder, the psychologist found evidence of deceit during the
evaluation,  and  had  concerns  about  her
trustworthiness  and  reliability,  and  said  her
prognosis was poor (SOR ¶ 1.d).
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  depression  during  her  teen  years  and  was
prescribed medication to treat depression. On October 24, 2015, she was arrested and
charged  with  Obstructing  Police,  Resisting  Arrest  and  Harassment.  The  police  were
called because she “was on some type of narcotic and was combative and fighting [and]
hitting her head on the stop sign.” (GE 7 at 1-2) Her mother-in-law reported that Applicant
said she had taken an “Amphetamine Pill, [some over the counter medications], and had
smoked spice.” (GE 7  at 2) The  arresting officer wrote that she “was irate and belligerent
and  [said that]  she  was high  and  possessed  because  she  had  read  [sic] pigs in a  parlor
and   continued   to   talk out   of   her head.”  Id. She  spit on  a  police  officer when  he  tried  to
calm  her down and  repeatedly banged  her head  against  a  window  inside  a  police  car.
She  was placed  in jail for five  days and  the  charges were  later dismissed.  (GE 1  at 37-
38, GE 2 at 3-4, GE 4  at 8-9, GE  7; Tr. 28, 34-36)
In about November 2015, a judge ordered Applicant into inpatient mental health
care  and  she  was  hospitalized  for  about  one  month.  She  said  she  was  treated  for
psychosis and was diagnosed with “schizoaffective disorder.” (GE 2 at 4, GE 4 at 9) She
said she experienced an  episode  of “acute  psychosis”  and  a  “mental breakdown,” that
she experienced “auditory, and visual hallucinations,” and was very aggressive until she
received  inpatient  treatment.  (Tr.  at  36;  GE  2  at  4)  She  reported  suffering  from
undiagnosed post-partum depression at the time, and said she was impacted by the loss
of her job in April 2015, her grandfather’s death in August 2015, and was sleeping less
than two hours a night. She said she ingested a lot of caffeine and took over the counter
medications and supplements but had not taken illegal drugs or consumed alcohol. (GE
4 at 8; Tr. 30-34)
In  December  2015,  Applicant  was  referred  for  outpatient  care;  her  intake  form
stated she was diagnosed with “Psychotic disorder NOS” and “Stimulant use disorder.”
(GE 5 at 5-6) From October 2015 until May 2016, she was prescribed various medications
including  antipsychotics,  antidepressants,  and  sleep  medication.  (GE  5)  She  said  she
was too heavily medicated and described feeling like a zombie, drooling, being unable to
walk well or interact with others, and being unable to perform normal daily functions. (GE1
at 35-36, GE 2 at 2, GE 4 at 9, GE 5; Tr. 35-38)
In  about  May  2016,  she  went  to  the  emergency  room  because  she  was
experiencing  stroke-like  symptoms.  She  was  subsequently  hospitalized  for  about  five
days and diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder. Her medications were changed and she said
the change “was wonderful, I became myself again, I could do things again. . . . I could
play  with  my  kids,  I  could  get  a  job  again.”  (Tr.  40-41)  Her  outpatient  treatment  plan
included  taking  prescribed  medications,  monthly  appointments  with  a  counselor  and  a
psychiatrist,  and  implementing  stress  management  skills.  She  complied  with  her
treatment plan until October 30, 2017, when outpatient treatment was terminated because
she  “missed  several  scheduled  appointments[.]”  (GE  5  at  47)  Applicant  attributed  her
decision to stop going to her appointments to disliking her psychiatrist, difficulty making
appointments due to her work schedule, and her medical doctor’s agreement to continue
prescribing the medications if she discontinued outpatient mental health treatment. (GE
1 at 35, GE 2 at 4, GE 5; Tr. 38-54)
Applicant said that she saw a counselor at a different mental health facility about
four times from late 2017 through early 2018. Medical records from February 7, 2018 to
May 14, 2018 and signed by Doctor (Dr.) I, Applicant’s primary care physician, show that
she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and insomnia and was prescribed the
same mental health medications that had previously proven effective. (GE 2 at 5; GE 5
at  2-34)  She   said  she   told  Dr.  I  that  she   wanted   to   discontinue   her  mental  health
medications and  that he  developed  a  plan  to  “wean” her off the  medications. (Tr. 61) She
said  she   stopped   taking   her  previously  prescribed   mental  health   medications   in  about
November  2020,  January  2021,   and   December  2022,  respectively.  She   reports  no
negative   effects   or   any   significant   mental  health   issues   since   she   stopped   taking   the
medications  and   says   she   has  used   appropriate   coping   mechanisms  to   maintain  her
mental health.  (GE  2  at GE  5; Tr.  51-62)  She  has  occasionally spoken  to  a  professional
counselor provided by her employer when  she  has  felt  like  she  needed  “a  little bit of one
on one.” (Tr. 58-59)
In September 2021, Applicant agreed to participate in a psychological evaluation
requested  by  DoD  CAF.  (GE  3)  In  January  2022,  a  DoD-affiliated  licensed  clinical
psychologist and board-certified neuropsychologist evaluated Applicant. She interviewed
Applicant,  reviewed  records  including  a  DoD  background  investigation,  and  medical
records. Her Diagnostic Impressions included:
[T]he following diagnoses is appropriate at this time:
Bipolar I disorder
R/O  Schizoaffective disorder
H/O   Stimulus use disorder
The   applicant   is  not   a   reliable   historian,   and   therefore   the   diagnosis
indicated  above  is based  on  review of all  available medical records and  my
clinical judgement.  The  initial emergence  of mania  within the  records may
have  been  prompted  by stimulant use, but it appears that there have  been
other occurrences of mania  and  psychosis at times that she  was not noted
to   be   using   stimulants   (although   I  am   not  certain  that  drug   tests  would
successfully identify use  if it was via over the  counter  medications). There
are  also   indications   of  psychosis,  which   could  be   due   to   schizophrenia
(particularly given  the  family history); however, this could also be  a  symptom
of mania. Because  the  applicant lacked  candor during  this interview, I am
not able to  fully determine  if she  has schizoaffective  disorder vice bipolar
disorder.  I  am   also   unable  to   determine   if  there  are  ongoing   issues  with
stimulant  abuse,  as  she   would  not  admit  to   any  history  of  stimulant  use
whatsoever.
At the  conclusion  of  the  interview, I  asked  [Applicant] if  there was  anything
else  she   wanted   to   address.   She   replied,  “in   my  [inpatient  care  medical
records]  they said I had  a  stimulant abuse  history, but I don’t.” [Applicant]
elaborated  that  while  in  [inpatient  care  in  about November 2015]  she  had  to
submit   a   urinalysis  and   hair   test   and   that   neither   result   demonstrated
stimulant use.   There  is  clear evidence   of   deceit  in   this   case.  Therefore,   I
have significant concerns about [Applicant’s] trustworthiness.
There  are  indications  within   the   medical  records  that   [Applicant]  has  not
been   consistent  in  her  pharmacotherapy.  Her  judgement  and   insight  are
poor.  Given  her psychiatric history,  apparent noncompliance  with  treatment
at  times,   and   frank   deceitfulness  during   this  interview,   her  reliability  is
questionable.  She  may  not   follow rules and  regulations  in   the   workplace.
Overall, her prognosis is poor. (GE 2  at 6-7)
In August 2019, a lab test detected the unexpected presence of benzodiazepine
drugs  in  Applicant’s  specimen.  (GE  5  at  35)  She  repeatedly  denied  improperly  using
controlled stimulants at any time and said she did not previously know that she had tested
positive for benzodiazepine. She testified that she now understood why the psychologist
who conducted the psychological evaluation believed she was being dishonest about her
use of certain stimulants. She acknowledged that at the time of the positive sample she
“h[ad] some  [medication containing benzodiazepine]  in [her] medicine  cabinet” from  an
old  prescription,  and  that  “the  only  thing  I  can  think  of  is  that  I  took  some  of  that  by
mistake[.]” (Tr. 28-35, 63-66, 98-99)
Applicant’s  current  supervisor  observed  the  entire  hearing  at  her  request  and
testified.  He  has  known  her  for  two  years  and  has  been  her  immediate  supervisor  for
about a year. The company has many employees with disabilities and  has “counselors
on board that are available [to employees] at any time.” (Tr. 92) He first learned of many
of her past life experiences and mental health challenges during the hearing and said that
he  would  never  have  known  about  them  otherwise.  She  is  one  of  the  company’s  top
employees, always on time, reliable, and has a great work ethic. She has earned his and
other supervisors trust and was very aware of responsibilities associated with a security
clearance.  She  has  successfully  dealt  with  many  stressful  situations  and  additional
responsibilities.  He  recommended  she  be  granted  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information without hesitation or reservation. (Tr. 7-9, 17, 91-97)
At hearing, Applicant was informed  of the  importance  of submitting  documentary
evidence   to   corroborate   her  testimony  including   examples  of   potentially  relevant
information.  She  did  not submit any documentary evidence  after the  hearing.  (Tr. 13, 80-
91, 97-100)

"Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2009.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  about  1997,
but  it  has  been  suspended  since  December  2019.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
1994. He married in 1995 and divorced in 2016. He married for the second time in the
fall of 2023. He has two adult children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 11-14, 18-19, 28, 38; GE 1, 2,

Applicant  has  been  involved  in  a  series  of  indiscriminate  high-risk  sexual
encounters  (“hook-ups”)  with  consenting  adults  since  about  1992.  Once  the  Internet
became prevalent, he met the individuals online through various websites designed for
that purpose.  He  met the  individuals in  hotels,  houses, public  restrooms,  public  parks,
and adult bookstores. He stopped using public places in about 2014. Applicant and the
individuals  remained  anonymous  or  on  a  first-name  basis.  He  could  only  recall  two
individuals  who  he  met  more  than  once,  and  he  did  not  know  their  last  names.  He
concealed his behavior from his then wife and other individuals until about 2010. After
2010,  he  and  his  wife  had  an  open  marriage,  and  she  accepted  that  he  had  multiple
partners outside the marriage. She also had at least one extramarital partner. (Tr. at 19-
20, 37-38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5; AE M)
Applicant  and  his  then  wife  had  an  agreement  that  they  would  not  have  sex
within  24  hours  of  either  one  of  them  having  sex  with  someone  else.  He  violated  that
agreement and sexually assaulted his then wife in about 2011 and again in 2012 while
she was asleep and within 24 hours of a sexual encounter. In 2011, he engaged in oral
sex  with  her  without  her  consent,  and  in  2012,  he  digitally  penetrated  her  without  her
consent. (Tr. at 21-23, 38-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3; AE M)
Applicant  and  his  second  wife  received  couples’  counseling,  and  he  received
counseling for sexual addiction from a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) from 2012
to  2014.  He  also  attended  Sex  Addicts  Anonymous  (SAA) meetings.  He  attributes  the
assaults  to  his  undiagnosed  and  untreated  bipolar  disorder  and  the  incorrect
medication, which made him hypersexual. (Tr. at 20-24; Applicant’s response to  SOR;
GE 2, 3, 5; AE M) He wrote in his response to the SOR:
The   sexual  assaults   were   committed   during   a   time   when   I  was
misdiagnosed   and   prescribed   an   antidepressant   that  exacerbated   my
manic  episodes.  Under  proper  diagnosis  and   proper  medication,   these
events would not have  occurred, and will not occur again.
Applicant’s  ex-wife  became  involved  in  an  ongoing  extramarital  relationship  in
about 2011. In about 2012, Applicant became  involved in an ongoing  relationship with
the individual who eventually became his husband. Applicant and his ex-wife separated
in about 2013. They disclosed their extramarital relationships to their children the same
year.  Applicant  informed  his  new  partner  (current  husband)  of  his  multiple  sexual
encounters,  and  they  maintained  an  open  relationship.  His  last  sexual  encounter  with
someone  other  than  his  husband  occurred  in  about  August  or  September  2023.  He
stated  that  he  has  not  had  any  extramarital  sexual  encounters  since  he  married.
Applicant  remains on good  terms with his ex-wife.  She  sincerely congratulated him on
his recent marriage. (Tr. at 18-19, 27-29, 37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, AE K)
Applicant  has  received  treatment  from  a  psychiatrist  since  2014.  He  received
several diagnoses over the years, but he has consistently been diagnosed with bipolar II
disorder. He was prescribed different medications based on that diagnosis. He told the
psychiatrist  in  2019  that  he  was  disappointed  his  ex-wife  chose  to  end  the  marriage
after  he  sexually  assaulted  her.  He  felt  that  since  the  assaults  occurred  before  he
received the correct diagnosis and treatment,  she should have been more forgiving. In
July  2021,  the  psychiatrist  diagnosed  him  with  bipolar  II  disorder;  fetishistic  disorder
(non-living objects); amphetamine-type use disorder, intermittent relapse/remission; and
cannabis use disorder, mild. In January 2023, he was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder,
stable; amphetamine-type use disorder, in sustained remission; cannabis use disorder,
mild; and fetishistic disorder (non-living objects). (Tr. at 23-27; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 3)
Applicant used methamphetamine for the first time in about October 2018, when
it  was  offered  to  him  during  a  sexual  encounter.  Applicant  used  methamphetamine
regularly  (every  six  to  eight  weeks)  during  certain  sexual  encounters  until  about  June
2021.  He  found  that  it  enhanced  his  experience.  The  methamphetamine  was  always
provided by the other individual. (Tr. at 29-30, 40; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2,
3, 5; AE M)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
January  2019.  He  intentionally  provided  false  information  when  he  denied  using  any
illegal  drugs  or  controlled  substances  in  the  last  seven  years.  He  thought  the
information would be shared  with his employer and possibly law enforcement. He was
concerned that he would lose his job and face criminal charges.  (Tr. at 42; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  June  2019.  He
again intentionally provided false information when he stated that he did not use illegal
drugs of any kind. (Tr. at 42-43; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant continued using methamphetamine after the background interview. He
realized  that  his  psychiatrist  knew  about  his  illegal  drug  use  and  that  the  DoD  had
sought his medical records. In August 2019, he reported his methamphetamine use and
compulsive sexual behavior to his employer, who in turn reported it to the DoD. He also
reported  that  he  had  been  diagnosed  with  bipolar  II  disorder.  He  discussed  his
counseling  and  treatment.  He told his employer that his next  step was  to  engage  with
the  Employee  Assistance  Program  to  find  a  therapist,  and  that  he  would  likely  start
attending  Narcotics  Anonymous  meetings.  Applicant’s  security  clearance  was
suspended in December 2019. (Tr. at 41, 44; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5,
6; AE M)
Applicant continued  using  methamphetamine  after  he  reported  it  to  his employer.
He used  marijuana  for  the  first time  in early 2020  when  it was provided  to  him  during  a
sexual  encounter.  He   received   counseling   from   a   psychologist   from   July   2021   to
September  2021.  He   was   diagnosed   with   bipolar  II   disorder   and   adjustment  disorder
with mixed  anxiety and depressed  mood. (Tr. at 32; Applicant’s  response to SOR;  GE  2-
5; AE M)
Applicant stopped using methamphetamine in about June 2021, but he continued
to  use  marijuana  until  about  April  2023.  He  was  interviewed  by  a  background
investigator in January 2022. He discussed his “hook-ups” and his drug use. He stated
that  he  had  been  in  an  open  relationship  since  about  2012  with  an  individual  (current
husband) who is aware of his sexual encounters. (Tr. at 30-32; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 2, 3, 5; AE M)
Applicant told the background investigator that he used marijuana about once a
week  or  every  other  week  at  home  alone.  He  lives  in  a  state  where  marijuana
possession and use do not violate state law. He stated that marijuana helped to fight his
cravings  for  methamphetamine.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  believe  he  used  marijuana
while  holding  a  security  clearance  because  his security  clearance was  no  longer valid
as  of  December  2019.  He  thought  that  his  employer  permitted  his  marijuana  use
because he did not have a security clearance. He stated that he would continue to use
marijuana  but  would  stop  if  it  was  required  for  his  employment  or  security  clearance.
(Tr. at 33, 41, 44; GE 2)
Applicant  continued  using  marijuana  after  the  background  interview.  In  his
February 2023 response to interrogatories, he wrote that he was using marijuana about
once  or  twice  a  week.  He  wrote  that  marijuana  helped  him  stay  sober  from
methamphetamine.  He  wrote,  “If  required,  in order to  regain my  clearance, I  would  be
willing to give it up.” (Tr. at 43-44; GE 2)
Applicant  stated  that  he  has  not  used  marijuana  or  any  other  illegal  drug  since
April  2023.  He  believes  that  marijuana  is  no  longer  necessary  for  his  sobriety  from
methamphetamine.  He  tested  negative  in  drug  tests  administered  in  September  2023
and  November  2023.  He  successfully  completed  an  eight-hour  drug  awareness
program  in  December  2023.  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement  and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  national  security  eligibility.  (Tr.  at  33-35,  43;
Applicant’s response to SOR; AE B-D, M)
Applicant engaged a board-certified psychologist for an evaluation  in December
2023. He diagnosed Applicant with bipolar II disorder, most recent episode hypomanic,
in full remission; compulsive sexual behavior disorder, in early remission; and stimulant
use  disorder,  amphetamine-type  substance,  moderate,  in  sustained  remission.  He
found  that  when  Applicant  “first  sought  care  for  mental  health  symptoms  in  2011,  his
condition  was  misdiagnosed  so  he  was  prescribed  Wellbutrin  which  exacerbated  his
manic  symptoms.”  The  psychologist  reported  that  in  2014,  Applicant  was  seen  by  his
treating  psychiatrist,  who  diagnosed  him  with  bipolar  II  disorder  and  prescribed  him
mood  stabilizing  medications  with  positive  results.  The  psychologist  also  found  that
“[d]espite  finding  substantial  relief  from  mood  stabilizers,  [Applicant]  continued  to
struggle  with  impulsive  and  compulsive  behaviors.”  Regarding  Applicant’s  sexual
behavior, the psychologist found:
is  often   preoccupied   with   sexual  thoughts  and
[Applicant’s test scores]  are typically seen  as  consistent with  the  scores of
those   who   engage   in  or  have   engaged   in   sexually  compulsive   behavior.
He  admitted   his sexual behavior has  caused   problems  for him   in   his  life,
that  he   has  felt   distressed   about  his  sexual   behaviors,  and   that  he   tried
and  failed  to  stop  engaging  in  distressing  sexual behavior in the  past.  He
admitted   he
that,
historically,  his  sexual   behavior  has  created   problems   for  him   and   his
family  and   emotionally  hurt  those   in  his  life.   He  admitted   he   has  sought
treatment  for  sexual  behavior  problems.  [Applicant]   admitted   he   has  had
multiple   sexual  partners  at  the   same   time   and   has  engaged   in   risky  sex
even   though   he   knew  it  could   cause   him   harm.   He  admitted   he   had
cruised   public  places,   such   as  parks,  for  sex  with   strangers  so   that  his
sexual behavior has put him at risk for lewd conduct or public indecency.

*
Fortunately,  through  specific  treatment  for  sexual  issues,  participation  in
SAA,  effective  mood  regulation,  and  personal  growth  and  maturity,
[Applicant]  now  seems  to  have  gained  a  fair  measure  of  control over  his
sexual  behaviors.  He  has  now  been  monogamous  in  his  current
relationship  since  October  2023  suggesting  this  condition  is  in  early
remission.
The psychologist concluded:
Based  on  all  the  available  data,  [Applicant’s]  mental  health  symptoms
appear  to  be  well  controlled  with  medication  at  this  time.  He  likely  still
experiences mild mood symptoms but he has developed excellent insight
concerning  bipolar  disorder,  is  able  to  manage  his  symptoms  and  has  a
track  record  of  seeking  help  when  needed.  [Applicant]  no  longer  uses
methamphetamine and given his limited use history and the time since last
use, the risk he will relapse seems quite low. Likewise, he does not seem
to be at risk for returning to marijuana use.  [Applicant] has struggled with
his sexual identity and behavior for most of his adult life and this seems to
be an ongoing  challenge for him.  He has however, gained much through
his 10 year history of treatment and he has shown a pattern of increased
self-control over the last several years. He has now been monogamous for
more  than  three  months,  further  suggesting  mastery  over  his  sexual
behavior.
At  this  time,  based  on  the  available  data  and  given  his  current  mental
status and track record of successfully managing a clearance in the past,
it  is  unlikely  that  any  of  his  conditions  could  negatively  impact  his
reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  judgment  while  working  in  a  cleared  setting
or around classified information. (AE M)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  professionalism,
trustworthiness,  reliability,  work  ethic,  and  loyalty  to  the  United  States.  He  is
recommended for a security clearance. (AE F, H-J)
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
The  DSM-5  is  the  standard  classification  of  mental  disorders  used  by  mental
health professionals in the United States. The following is summarized from the DSM-5:
Bipolar II Disorder
Bipolar  II  disorder  is  characterized  by  a  clinical  course  of  recurring  mood
episodes  consisting  of  one  or  more  major  depressive  episodes  and  at  least  one
hypomanic  episode.  The  major  depressive  episode  must  last  at  least  two  weeks,  and
the hypomanic episode must last at least four days to meet the diagnostic criteria.
Major Depressive Episode
The  essential  feature  of  a  major  depressive  episode  is  a  period  of  at  least  two
weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in
nearly all activities.
Hypomanic Episode
A  distinct  period  of  abnormally  and  persistently  elevated,  expansive,  or  irritable
mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least four
consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.
The  episode  is  associated  with  an  unequivocal  change  in  functioning  that  is
uncharacteristic of the individual when not  symptomatic. The disturbance in mood and
the change in functioning are observable by others.  The episode is not severe enough
to  cause  marked  impairment  in  social  or  occupational  functioning  or  to  necessitate
hospitalization.
Adjustment Disorder
The  essential  feature  of  adjustment  disorders  is  the  presence  of  emotional  or
behavioral  symptoms  in  response  to  an  identifiable  stressor.  By  definition,  the
disturbance  in  adjustment  disorders  begins  within  three  months  of  onset  of  a  stressor
and lasts no longer than six months after the stressor or its consequences have ceased.
A stressor may be a single event (e.g., a termination of a romantic relationship), or there
may  be  multiple  stressors  (e.g.,  marked  business  difficulties  and  marital  problems).
Stressors may be recurrent (e.g., associated with seasonal business crises, unfulfilling
sexual  relationships)  or  continuous  (e.g.,  a  persistent  painful  illness  with  increasing
disability,  living  in  a  crime-ridden  neighborhood).  Adjustment  disorders  are  associated
with an increased risks of suicide attempts and completed suicide.
Symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced by one or both of
the following:
1.  Marked  distress  that  is  out  of  proportion  to  the  severity  or  intensity  of  the
stressor,  taking  into  account  the  external  context  and  the  cultural  factors  that
might influence symptom severity and presentation.
2.  Significant  impairment  in  social,  occupational,  or  other  important  areas  of
functioning.
Substance  Use  Disorder
The  essential  feature  of  a  substance  use  disorder  (including  cannabis  use
disorder  and  amphetamine  use  disorder)  is  a  cluster  of  cognitive,  behavioral,  and
physiological  symptoms  indicating  that  the  individual  continues  using  the  substance
despite significant substance-related problems.
Fetishistic  Disorder
The  paraphilic  basis  of  fetishistic  disorder  involves  the  persistent  and  repetitive
use  of  or  dependence  on  nonliving  objects  or  a  highly  specific  focus  on  a  (typically
nongenital) body part as primary elements associated with sexual arousal. A diagnosis
of fetishistic disorder must include clinically significant personal distress or psychosocial
role impairment.

"Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact: Applicant is 24 years old. Before their college graduation  in the Spring
of  2021,  they  started  an  internship  in  November  2019  with  a  government  contractor.
They were required to apply for a DOD security clearance. After they graduated with a
bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  science,  the  government  contractor  offered  them  full-
time employment as a software engineer. Applicant identified as a trans man from their
sophomore  year  in  high  school and  during  their  first  two  years  into  college.  They  now
consider  themselves  demisexual.  Demisexuality  is  a  sexual  orientation  in  which  a
person  feels  sexually  attracted  to  someone  only  after  they  have  developed  a  close
emotional  bond  with
(https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22678-
demisexuality)  They currently  cohabitate  with  their  partner,  and  they  do  not  have  any
children. (Tr. 22-25, 30, 35, 38-39; GE 1)
them.
Applicant described their childhood as “rough.” Their parents divorced when they
were 11 years old. Their mother had a mental health condition, was a harsh critic, and
was  excessively  fixated  on  her  children’s  academics.  Applicant  was  verbally  and
emotionally  abused by  their mother,  and they  were  also neglected.  Their  mother used
alcohol  to   excess,   and   she   was  hospitalized   on   more  than   one   occasion   due   to   this
problem. Applicant did  not  feel safe  living  with  their  mother,  and  they had  to  watch  over
their  two  younger siblings  because  they were  neglected  by their  mother as well. (Tr. 26-
29)
When Applicant was 12 years old, they suffered from a depressive episode which
required inpatient treatment. When asked how this situation developed, Applicant stated
that  another  student  had  looked  at  their  artwork  without  permission,  and  due  to  the
graphic  nature  of  Applicant’s  artwork,  the  student  reported  it  to  school  officials.
Applicant  testified,  “I  had  some  art  of  my  ghost  getting  back  at  my  bullies,  and  while,
yes, the art was violent, no one was really listening or understanding that I was having
issues at school. And I had no intentions of ever harming someone; it was just the only
way for me to get my frustrations out.” They had to meet with a social worker, who then
told  Applicant’s  father  they  needed  to  have  a  mental  health  evaluation.  They  were
referred for inpatient treatment from approximately February 2012 through March 2012
for  a  condition  diagnosed  as  depressive  disorder  with  suicidal  ideation.  They  were
prescribed medication. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b) (GE 1; Tr. 30-34)
Applicant  continued  to  receive  mental  health  counseling  and  medication
throughout their high school years, but it was not consistent. When they were the age of
14, they half-heartedly attempted to hang  themselves with the belt from their bathrobe
after performing poorly on a test, and on another occasion, they put a plastic bag over
their  head  but  did  not  tie  it  closed.  On  both  occasions,  they  stopped  their  actions
because  they  did  not  like  the  way  it  made  them  feel.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d)  At  some
point  during  this  time  they  were  diagnosed  with  bipolar  disorder,  anxiety,  and
depression. In 2016, their mother died from complications related to  excessive alcohol
use when they were 16 years old. (GE 1; Tr. 30-35; GE 3)
From  approximately  November  2019  to  December  2019,  Applicant  received
partial  outpatient  treatment  for  a  condition  diagnosed  as  major  depressive  disorder  –
severe.  (SOR  ¶  1.e)  They  were  enrolled  in  college  at  the  time  and  feeling  extreme
pressure  from  the  college  assignments  and  the  notion  that  they  had  to  excel  in
academics  that  was  impressed  upon  them  since  childhood.  They  voluntarily  referred
themselves for treatment. After the partial outpatient treatment program was completed,
they  continued  to  see  a  therapist,  a  new  psychiatrist,  and  they  continued  taking
medication.  The  treatment  records  reflect  there  were  times  they  did  not  take  the
medication as prescribed. (Tr. 35-38; GE 2; GE 3)
During the course of Applicant’s security clearance investigation, the DCSA CAS
requested Applicant to voluntarily undergo a psychological evaluation. They consented
to  the  evaluation,  and  in  September  2022  they  met  with  the  licensed  clinical
psychologist. The evaluation took three hours out of the four hours allotted. During the
evaluation Applicant felt  like  the questions were  based on preconceived notions  about
them,  and  the  mental  health  professional  seemed  more  concerned  about  their  history
rather than their current treatment and  progress. After the evaluation, the psychologist
found  that  Applicant  met  the  criteria  for  bipolar  II  disorder,  most  recent  episode
depressed  (severe),  other  specified  trauma  and  stressor  related  disorder,  and  autism
spectrum  disorder.  The  mental  health  professional  noted  there  was  a  reasonable
concern  that  Applicant’s  psychological  conditions  impaired  their  judgment,  reliability,
and trustworthiness. (SOR ¶ 1.f) (Tr. 38-41; GE 4)
Applicant  disagreed  with  the  psychologist’s  findings  from  the  September  2022
evaluation. They have been feeling remarkably better since November 2022 when they
started  seeing  a  new  therapist  and  after  going  through  a  complete  “med  wash”  under
the supervision of their psychiatrist. The medications they had been taking made them
violently  ill  and  also  kept  them  in  a  state  of  mental  fog.  The  new  therapist  has  been
more challenging by setting specific goals and has been more involved in helping them
improve,  rather  than  just  listening  to  their  thoughts  and  concerns  like  their  former
therapist. (Tr. 41-45)
Applicant and their psychiatrist worked together during their med wash, and the
plan  was  to  eliminate  all  medications,  and  then  slowly  add  medications  when
necessary.  No  new  medications  have  ever  been  added.  They  have  been  completely
free from medications for over a year now. Applicant stated:
I believe  that not having  the  medications has allowed  me  more opportunity
to  help my  mental health  conditions  and  confront the  feelings  that  I  feel in
therapy  a  lot  better,  as some  of  the  medications were  merely helping  me
get  by   and   masking   the   symptoms  instead   of  allowing   me   to   confront
them. Now  that I'm not  taking medications, I'm  more in tune  with  how I feel
and  how I can better cope  with those in  therapy.  (Tr. 45-46)
Applicant provided a medical study showing that antidepressants are a potential
cause  of  suicidal  ideations  or  behavior.  (AE  A)  They  also  submitted  their  current
treatment  records.  In  May  2021  neuropsychiatric  testing  results  showed  Applicant’s
diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, without intellectual or language impairment, and
major  depressive  disorder.  The  test  results  did  not  conclude  a  diagnosis  of  bipolar
disorder. The psychiatrist, therapist, and the certified physician assistant have updated
Applicant’s diagnosis to major depressive disorder, in full remission. Applicant has been
seeing their therapist on a  weekly basis since  November  2022. The therapist reported
that  since  medications  were  discontinued  in  January  2023,  there  have  not  been  any
major depressive-type systems, and the patient appeared to be doing better than when
they were treated with medications. The patient reported their mental health symptoms
have not impaired their daily functioning, and they have built sufficient coping strategies
to  maintain  stability.  Based  on  patient  reports  and  clinical  observation,  Applicant  has
demonstrated  improvements  in  their  overall  insight  and  judgment/impulse  control.
Applicant continues to participate in weekly therapy sessions to the current time and is
fully compliant with their treatment plan. (AE C)

"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise  indicated  by  a  parenthetical
citation  to  the  record.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his
Answer,  his  testimony,  and  the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  35  years  old  and  married  in  2016.  He  and  his  wife  have  no  children.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  of
science degree in 2011. He is currently enrolled in a master’s program, which  is scheduled to finish in the fall of 2022.

Following  Applicant’s  graduation  in  2011,  his  employer  at  the  time  sponsored  him  to  apply  for  a  security
clearance. He was granted an interim secret clearance while his application was pending. The DoD CAF required that
Applicant  provide  written  answers  and  documents  in  response  to  interrogatories  relating  to  his  past  treatment  for
mental-health disorders. Applicant failed to respond to the interrogatories in a timely manner. The DoD CAF revoked
his interim clearance and terminated the processing of his application. (Tr. at 15-17.)
June
2019
Mental
Health Evaluation
In May 2016, Applicant reapplied for a clearance. In March 2019, the DoD CAF requested that Applicant voluntarily
participate in an independent psychological
evaluation. He agreed to do so, and on June 20, 2019, a licensed clinical psychologist
(the LCP) conducted an evaluation. The next day, she prepared a nine-page summary of
her  psychological  evaluation  (June  2019  Report)  and  attached  her  eight-page  CV,  to
establish her credentials.
The LCP concluded that Applicant’s diagnostic profile is the following: “Bipolar II
Disorder,  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder,  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity  Disorder
(predominantly inattentive type), Alcohol Use Disorder (in sustained remission), Cannabis
Use  Disorder  (in  sustained  remission),  and  Nonadherence  to  Medical  Treatment  (by
history).” She noted that he continues to experience anxiety daily. She wrote that “the risk
of  future  mood  disturbance  seems  moderate”  and  that  “it  can  be  mitigated  through
treatment compliance” and other ongoing efforts. She concluded, however, that:

SOR Allegations
The SOR contains the following three allegations:
1.a.  Mental-health  treatment  in  2004  at  an  addiction  and  recovery  facility.
Applicant was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Attention Deficit Disorder. SOR ¶ 1.a
also alleges that he missed appointments and failed to follow his treatment plan.
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denies  that  this  allegation  is  factually  correct.  He  was
treated for substance abuse at the identified facility in 2004 when he was 19 years old.
He claims he was never diagnosed with any mental disorders during his treatment for
addiction. (Answer at 3-4.)
Applicant  testified  at  the  hearing  that  at  that  time,  he  was  self-medicating  his
depression and anxiety with marijuana and alcohol. His father encouraged him to seek
help,  and  Applicant  attended  12  weekly group  sessions  on  an  out-patient  basis at  the
addiction recovery facility identified in the SOR. Applicant also received medication. The
facility did not provide mental-health services and provided no diagnosis of his mental-
health condition. He clarified that when he was 18 he was hospitalized for two weeks and
received a formal mental-health diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder. (See discussion under
SOR ¶ 1.b, below.) At that time, he was also suffering from a serious problem with suicidal
ideation. A few years earlier, when he was 14 or 15, he was diagnosed with depression.
Applicant has established that this allegation in the SOR identified the wrong facility, but
is otherwise correct. (Tr. at 22-24, 45, 54-55, 64, 75.)
Applicant  admitted  that  after  his  substance-abuse  treatment,  he  did  not  fully comply with his
mental health treatment plan, which was established in the earlier 2003 to 2004 period. In January 2005,
he  ceased  all  treatment  and  medication.  At  the  time  of  his  2019  Government-requested  psychological
evaluation  and  at  the  hearing,  Applicant  attributed  his  decision  to  a  number  of  factors,  but  primarily  to  a
lack  of  maturity.  He  did  not  understand  the  importance  of  his  treatment  and  the  positive  impact  that
treatment had on his life. (Tr. at 22-24, 56-57; GE 2 at 4.)
1.b.  Treatment  at  a  mental-health  facility  from  December  2003  to  January  2005. A licensed
social  worker  diagnosed  Applicant  as  suffering  from  Bipolar  II  Disorder  and  Chronic  Mood  Disorder.  In
January 2005, he stopped his treatment and refused any further treatment.
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  based  upon  the  same  facts discussed above.
He attributed his failure to adhere to treatment recommendations to his lack of maturity at a time when he
was  18-20  years  old.  He  provided  additional  reasons  for  his  behavior.  Initially,  he  was  pressured  to
relocate to the native country of his then-girlfriend. He moved with her and lived there for about one year.
He  returned  to  the  United  States  and  attended  college.  He  wrote  that  he  could  not  study  while  being
medicated for anxiety. He ultimately graduated from college in 2011. His first job required that he apply for
a  security  clearance.  As  noted  above,  he  failed  to   respond   to   the   Government’s  interrogatories
during  the  processing  of  his  earlier  security  clearance  application.  He  “deferred”  his  mental  health
needs until May  2019, a  period  of  14  years since he stopped treatment in 2005. He is now committed to
living a life that prioritizes the treatment of his mental-health disorders. (Answer at 4-6.)
Applicant’s   testimony  at  the  hearing  provided  additional  details  about  this  period  of  his  life.  He
reported that when he was 18 he was hospitalized for two weeks and was given  his  first  diagnosis  by  a
mental-health  professional.  He  did  not  take  his  treatment plan seriously and failed to take his medication
as required. While living abroad, he had no  health  care.  He  experienced  severe  anxiety  and  emotional
swings  associated  with Bipolar  Disorder.  He  took  no  medication  during  the  14-year  period  from  2005  to
2019, with the brief exception of taking tranquilizer medication during part of his college years. When he
first  applied  for  a  security  clearance,  he  was  experiencing  severe  anxiety  and  depression.  He  attributed
his  failure  to  respond  to  the  Government’s  interrogatories  in 2013 to his mental-health condition at that
time. (Tr. at 20-22, 25-34, 57-58.)
1.c.  June  2019  psychological  evaluation.  The  LCP  diagnosed  Applicant  as  described above,
and  gave  him  a  guarded  prognosis  due  to  his  history  of  failing  to  comply  with  necessary  treatment  for
years  prior  to  2019.  She  also  concluded  that  Applicant’s   mental-health  conditions  and  his  behavioral
history   “could  pose   a  significant   risk  to   his  judgment,   reliability   and/or   trustworthiness  concerning
classified  information.”
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted
that  at
the
time  of  his  2019  evaluation,  he  had
just “recommenced” his treatment and medications three weeks earlier. He does
not
dispute the LCP’s evaluation of him at that point in time, nor does he dispute that there is historical evidence of non-
compliance.
At the hearing, Applicant described in detail his current medication treatment and his  ongoing  compliance.
He  also  explained  his  involvement  in  his  group-counseling therapy.  He  provided more historical detail about his
mental-health  conditions.  He  was ultimately  diagnosed  by  a  licensed  social  worker  with  Bipolar  II  Disorder  and
Chronic Mood Disorder in 2003. During the years 2005 through 2019, Applicant elected to forego any counseling or
medication  to  address  his  mental-health  disorders.  He  acknowledged  that,  even  after  submitting  his  SCA  in  May
2016,  he  was  still  in  denial  about  his  need  for  mental-health  treatment.  After  the  DoD  CAF’s  request  for  a
psychological evaluation in March 2019, Applicant decided to seek mental-health treatment again. He testified that
this decision was made before his June 2019 psychological evaluation. In her June 2019 Report, the LCP noted that
Applicant  had  only  seen  his  new  therapist  once  and  could  not  recall  the  therapist’s  name  or  the  medication
therapist.  Applicant  emphasized  at  the  hearing  that  his  decision  to  begin  mental-health
prescribed  by
treatment  three  years  after  his  submission  of  his  second  SCA  was  based  upon  his  desire  to  address  his
condition. (Tr. at 20-22, 35, 62-63; GE 2 at 4; GE 4.)
the
Applicant  began  seeing  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker  in  May  2019.  The  last session  with  that  therapist
was  in  the  first  part  of  2020,  before  the  Covid-19  pandemic  began.  He  only  attended  four  sessions  with  her.
Starting in November 2019, he has been under the care of a psychiatrist, who monitors his medication. Over time,
Applicant has scheduled appointments with his psychiatrist less and less frequently. He only sees the psychiatrist
when  he  needs  to  adjust  his  medications.  He  last  saw  his  doctor  in  August  2020.  Applicant’s  primary  therapy  is
participating  in  group  counseling,  which  he  began  in  June  2019.  That  counseling  started  out  as  weekly  group
sessions, but  the therapy has more recently been reduced to about once every three or four weeks. He is committed
to taking all necessary steps to continue to maintain sound mental health. (Tr. at 35, 38-39, 41, 68-70; AE A at 3.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  engaged  in  consistent,  effective  therapy  and  has been extremely compliant
with  his  medication,  which  he  listed  in  AE  B.  He  believes  that  he  is  supported  by  a  social  network  that  he  calls  a
“safety  net”  of  individuals  who  are  fully  familiar  with  his  mental-health  issues.  He  feels  he  has  the  support  of  his
therapist  in  the  event  of  any  emotionally  difficult  experiences.  He  testified  that  even  with  his  medication,  he
experiences  anxiety  symptoms,  although  this  happens  infrequently.  He  testified candidly  that  he  experiences
hypomanic  episodes  as  part  of  his  Bipolar  II  Disorder  in  which  he  has  “days  of  incredibly  intense  anxiety.”  He
testified  that  he  has  been  open  and  forthcoming  about  his  condition  in  his  dealings  with  Government  security
officials.  He is proud that he is able to stay fully focused on his work and “apply himself in a creative and intellectual
way.” He also is pleased that his ability “to develop personal relationships has grown significantly under  treatment.”
He  feels that his condition is healthy and stable  at this  time.  He  is  starting  graduate  school,  is  balancing  those
demands  with  his  work commitments, and is managing successfully the stress of purchasing a home. He testified
that receiving treatment is the most important thing that contributes to the quality of his life. (Tr. at 36-48, 72.)
In his evidentiary submissions, Applicant did not provide a psychological evaluation from a qualified therapist with a favorable
analysis of his current condition. In his Answer, he wrote: “I believe that a repeat evaluation by a licensed psychologist would
conclude that my current course of treatment is effective and that my prognosis is extremely good.” (Answer at 3.)
At
the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  “Verifications  of  Treatment”
from  his  psychiatrist,  dated  January
21, 2020, and March 5, 2021; and from both his therapist and group-counseling therapist, both dated January 8, 2020.
None of the verifications provide a  diagnosis,  though  the  two  therapists  wrote  that  his  prognosis  is  “very  good”
with  continued  treatment.  The  verifications  set  forth  limited  factual  statements  describing  Applicant’s  treatment
plan  and  his  compliance  with  it.  The  most  detailed  information  was  provided  by  Applicant’s  group-counseling
therapist,  a  Licensed  Clinical  Social  Worker (the LCSW), in a one-paragraph statement. In January 2020, she wrote
in relevant part:
[Applicant’s]  progress  has  been  excellent  and  he  is  very  conscientious about following through
on treatment recommendations and homework. He also  communicates  with  his  psychiatrist  on  a
consistent  basis  and  is compliant with his medication regimen. He keep in regular contact with his
treatment  team  and  is  quick  to  alert  us  of  any  concerns.  [Applicant’s] condition responds well
treatment
to medication and he is consistent in keeping all of his  appointments.  With  continued
and  proactive  use  of therapeutic techniques, [Applicant’s] prognosis is very good.
AE A at 1. Applicant provided no update to the LCSW’s 2020 verification.
Applicant’s counsel noted at the hearing that Applicant’s insurance company only uses mental-health providers
from the employer of the three therapists referred to above. She also represented that the therapists’ employer has a
policy against providing more detailed reports. (Tr. at 92.)
Applicant’s wife, with whom he has lived since 2011, also wrote a letter of support, dated  February  10,  2020,  in
which  she  praised  his  progress  in  managing  his  mental-health  problems. She  updated  that letter  in  a  post-hearing
submission, dated March 7, 2021 (AE H), in which she wrote:
In summary, I believe [Applicant] has made great progress in managing his care.  Although  mental
health  will  always  be  an  aspect  of  his  life  that  will need  to  be  controlled,  I  feel  he  is  more  than
capable  of  addressing  any situation that may arise successfully.
Applicant testified sincerely that he is highly motivated to continue his compliance  with his treatment plan because it
is only by doing so that he avoids painful daily anxiety.
He  describes  himself  as  “functional”  but  “not  neurotypical.”  He  said  that  he  has  no  intention  to  ever  use
marijuana again because it only makes his anxiety worse. He also testified  that  he  rarely  drinks  alcohol  because
he  has  a  condition  that  makes  him  sick when he does so. (Tr. at 20.)

"In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  in  part  and  denied  in  part  both  of  the  SOR
allegations,  with  explanations.  The  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  38  years  old.  He  is  single,  never  married,  and  has  no  children.  He
has  worked  for  his  current  defense  contractor-employee  since  2009.  He  has  held  a
security  clearance  since  2004  and  has  never  had  a  security  incident  or  violation.  He
holds  master’s  degrees  in  electrical  engineering  and  business  administration.  He  has
owned a home since December 2016. (Tr. at 108-111, 139; GE 1; AE B)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant:  (1)  was  diagnosed  with  Schizoaffective  Disorder
(depressive type, with catatonia) and Non-adherence to Medical Treatment (by history)
in August 2019 by a licensed clinical psychologist (Dr. 2), which are conditions that may
impair  judgment,  stability,  reliability,  or  trustworthiness;  and  (2)  has  received  mental
health treatment since February 2010 from a psychiatrist (Dr. 1) and that in May 2017,
this  provider  indicated  that  Applicant  had  a  condition  that  could  impair  judgment,
reliability,  or  ability  to  properly  safeguard  classified  information.  The  provider  further
stated  that  Applicant  has  psychotic  symptoms  if  he  stops  taking  his  medication  and
gave a prognosis of “guarded to fair.” (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.a).
In 2002, Applicant was hospitalized for the first time for a mental health issue. He
was  working  in  a  state  away  from  where  his  parents  lived  and  an  acquaintance  died,
which caused Applicant to have a severe depressive episode. This caused his parents
to  go  to  Applicant’s  out-of-state  location  and  see  to  his  hospitalization.  Applicant
described  his  actions  at  that  time  as  being  depressed,  not  talking,  and  “just  shutting
down”.  No  contemporaneous  medical  records  are  available  to  describe  this  incident,
however,  later  medical  records  from  2009  and  2012  refer  to  the  2002  incident  when
describing  Applicant’s  medical  history  with  the  information  usually  coming  from  either
Applicant  or  his  parents.  The  records  refer  to  a  psychotic  incident  occurring  in  2002.
(Note: None of the previous medical incidents in 2002, herein described, or in 2009 and
2012, described below, were specifically alleged in the SOR, therefore, I will not use this
evidence  for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  I  will  consider  it  in  the  application  of  any
mitigating  conditions,  whole-person  factors,  and  in  assessing  Applicant’s  credibility.)
After  Applicant’s  hospitalization,  he  returned  to  his  parents’  home  state  where  he
remained while finishing his bachelor’s degree in 2004 and his master’s degree in 2006.
Applicant  also  saw  a  psychiatrist  for  approximately  three  years  and  was  prescribed
Zyprexa,  Geodon,  and  Ativan.  No  diagnosis  or  prognosis  was  contained  in  the  record
from  this  time  frame.  Applicant  testified  that  he  came  off  the  prescribed  medicine  in
2005 because he was not seeing a doctor at the time and there was no requirement to
stay  on  the  medication.  In  July  2009,  Applicant  was  employed  at  his  current  location,
which required a move to a different state. (Tr. at 121-127; GE 1, 3, 4 (p. 40 of pp. 101)
In  December  2009,  Applicant  experienced  another  psychological  incident  that
resulted in a hospitalization. Records indicate that Applicant was seen standing outside
his home, unmoving, for approximately two hours. Medical personnel were alerted and
he  was  hospitalized  where  he  presented  with  “thought  blocking,  disorganized  thought
process, paranoia, and denial about his condition.” His admission diagnosis was: mood
disorder  NOS,  a  rule  out  of  major  depressive  disorder,  recurrent,  with  catatonic
features,  and  a rule out  of  schizophrenia.  (See:  The criteria  set  forth in the Diagnostic
Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fourth  Edition  (DSM-IV)).  At  that  time,  he  was
prescribed  Zyprexa  and  Ativan.  He  was  hospitalized  for  approximately  one  week  and
upon discharge he returned with his parents to their home state where he remained for
about  two  months.  His  discharge  diagnosis  was:  bipolar  disorder,  depressed,  versus
major  depressive  disorder  with  psychotic  features  and  catatonia,  most  possibly
depressive disorder, severe, recurrent, with psychotic features. After his hospitalization,
he began therapy with two doctors (their specialties were not indicated in the record). In
either  late  2009  or  early  2010,  Applicant  began  seeing  his  current  psychiatrist  (Dr.  1)
every three months for medication management. (GE 2, 3, 4 (p. 36-38 of pp. 101); AE
A)
Applicant  testified  that  leading  up  to  his  2009  hospitalization  he  was  unable  to
sleep  for  three  days.  As  a  result,  he  was  not  functioning  well.  He  confirmed  that  he
stood outside his home for some time until a neighbor saw him and called for help. He
recalls being admitted to the hospital and being diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and
depressive disorder. He was not on medication at the time of this incident, but during his
this
hospitalization  he  was  prescribed  Geodon  and  Ativan.  Sometime  after
hospitalization, in early 2010, he began seeing his current psychiatrist, Dr. 1. During the
early part of his treatment by Dr. 1, he was seen more than once every three months.
Now, the frequency of his appointments are about once every three months. He went to
live with his parents for about two months after his hospitalization. He then returned to
work  with  no  repercussions  from  his  hospitalization  or  his  lengthy  absence.  (Tr.  127-
130; GE 3; AE A.
In April 2012, Applicant was admitted to the hospital after a visit from his parents
who  found  him  to  be  acting  in  an  odd  manner  and  took  him  to  see  his  doctor.  It  was
discovered  that  Applicant  had  not  been  to  work  for  over  a  month  and  had  lost  a
significant  amount  of  weight.  He  also  had  stopped  taking  his  prescribed  medicine  in
May 2011. He remained hospitalized for ten days and was given a discharge diagnosis
of:  major  depression  with  psychotic  features,  schizophrenia  also  remains  part  of
differential,  and  general  anxiety  disorder.  He  was  prescribed  Ziprasidone,  Citalopram,
Buspirone, and Ativan upon his discharge. During his testimony, Applicant admitted that
he  stopped  taking  his  medication  because  he  thought  he  could  manage  his  condition
without the medication and because the medication led to significant weight gain. While
he continued to see Dr. 1 before this hospitalization he did not recall if he told Dr.1 that
he  stopped  taking  his  medication.  He  described  his  behavior  which  led  to  his
hospitalization  as  “shutting  down.”  This  resulted  in  him  not  going  to  work,  not
communicating  with  other  people,  and  just  staying  in  his  house.  He  believes  the  only
trigger  for  this  hospitalization  was  that  he  stopped  taking  his  medication.  He  was  put
back  on  medication  during  and  after  this  hospitalization.  He  again  returned  to  work
without  any  repercussions  from  his  earlier  missed  time.  Between  2012  and  2014,  he
was not 100 percent compliant with taking his medication because he experienced side
effects from it. Dr. 1 made an adjustment to his medication in 2014 and since then he
has  been  100  percent  compliant  with  taking  the  medication,  which  at  this  time  only
includes taking Abilify for his mental health conditions. (Tr. at 130-135; GE 3, GE 4 (pp.
56-59, 91-92 of 101); AE A)
As  stated  above,  none  of  Applicant’s  three  hospitalizations  were  specifically
alleged in the SOR. I have described the uses I can make of this evidence (credibility,
application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and  the  whole-person  factors).  I  will  also  consider
the evidence as background information as it may help explain or amplify the diagnoses
that have been alleged in the SOR.
In May 2017, as part of Applicant’s background investigation, an investigator sent
Dr. 1 a questionnaire that asked the provider to answer “yes” or “no” to the question of
whether the Applicant had a condition that could impair his judgment, reliability, or ability
to protect classified information. Dr. 1 answered “yes.” Dr. 1 was also asked to state the
nature of the condition, which she stated as: “He has psychotic symptoms if he goes off
of his medication.” Dr. 1 stated that his prognosis was: “guarded to fair.” The period of
treatment was listed as February 23, 2010, to the present. As part of his answer to the
SOR,  Applicant  included  a  letter  by  Dr.  1  from  January  2020.  In  this  letter,  Dr.  1
described  her  treatment  of  Applicant  since  February  2010,  with  his  last  appointment
coming in January 2020; that he has been psychiatrically stable since September 2014;
and that he has been compliant in taking his medication and making every appointment
since September 2014. (GE2; Answer to SOR (See attachment labeled Exhibit A))
In  furtherance  of  Applicant’s  background  investigation,  the  CAF  contracted  to
have  Dr.  2  perform  a  psychological  evaluation  of  Applicant.  The  examination  was
conducted in August 2019 and Dr. 2’s report was completed in September 2019 (GE 3).
Dr.  2  also  testified  at  Applicant’s  hearing.  Dr.  2  is  a  Ph.D.  (Doctor  of  philosophy)  of
clinical  psychology.  Her  CV  is  part  of  the  record.  (GE  5)  I  find  that  Dr.  2  is  a  duly
qualified mental health professional approved by the U.S. Government. (Tr. 19-22)
As part of her evaluation, Dr. 2 reviewed Applicant’s medical records, conducted
a  clinical  interview  with  him,  made  clinical  observations,  and  administered  the
personality  assessment  inventory  (PAI)  test.  Dr.  2  observed  that  Applicant  arrived  for
his  appointment  on  time  and  appeared  neat  and  clean.  He  seemed  relaxed,  with  no
observable  signs  of  anxiety  or  psychomotor  agitation.  Dr.  2  believed  his  insight  and
memory  were  poor  because  he  denied  aspects  of  his  mental  health  history  believing
that he had a tendency to minimize the severity of his mental health condition by stating
that  it  was  “just  depression.”  He  was  respectful  and  cooperative  throughout  the
evaluation and there were no attempts at deception. Dr. 2 noted that on one aspect of
the  PAI  test,  Applicant  indicated  that  he  was  portraying  himself  in  an  unrealistically
favorable  light.  Dr.  2  further  stated  that  Applicant’s  inconsistent  medication  adherence
and  his  ongoing  denial  about  the  severity  of  his  condition  places  him  at  an  increased
risk  for  future  relapse.  Dr.  2  stated  that  his  diagnostic  profile  was:  Schizoaffective
Disorder (depressive type, with catatonia) and non-adherence to medical treatment (by
history).  Dr.  2  also  noted  that  the  risk  of  future  psychotic  episodes  can  be  mitigated,
provided Applicant continues to take his prescribed medicine. She admitted that records
indicate he has been medically compliant since 2014 and that there is no evidence of a
psychotic episode since that time. Dr. 2 read Dr. 3’s evaluation report, but nothing in it
caused  her  to  change  her  opinion  about  Applicant’s  lack  of  insight  that  could  result  in
his future non adherence to taking his medication. (Tr. at 21-24, 27, 43; GE 3, 5)
In  August  2020,  Applicant  sought  and  participated
independent
psychological  evaluation  conducted  by  Dr.  3.  Dr.  3  prepared  a  resulting  evaluation
report  in  October  2020.  (AE  A)  Dr.  3  also  testified  at  Applicant’s  hearing.  Dr.  3  is  a
PsyD.  (Doctor  of  psychology)  of  clinical  and  forensic  psychology.  (Generally,  Ph.D.
programs emphasize research, while PsyD. programs emphasize clinical work) Her CV
is part of the record. (AE C) I find that Dr. 3 is a duly qualified mental health professional
and because she has contracted with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and
several state agencies to conduct psychological evaluations she is also approved by the
U.S. Government. (Tr. 61-64; AE A, C)
in  an
As  part  of  her  evaluation  of  Applicant,  Dr.  3  conducted  a  clinical  interview,  a
mental  status  exam,  a  competency  evaluation,  a  psychological  assessment,  records
review,  and  a  series  of  psychological  testing,  including:  the  Reynolds  Adaptable
Intelligence  Test  (RAIT),  Millon  Clinical  Multiaxial  Inventory  (MCMI-IV),  Beck  Anxiety
Inventory  (BAI),  Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI-II),  Adult  Substance  Abuse  Subtle
Screening  Inventory-4  (SASSI-4).  Dr.  3’s  evaluation  report  traces  a  very  similar
psychological  history  for  Applicant  as  did  Dr.  2.  Some  differences  exist.  Dr.  3  pointed
out  that  Applicant  has  not  been  hospitalized  since  2012  and  that  he  has  not  received
any reprimands or discipline from his employer. Dr. 3 also pointed out that Applicant has
not  been  violent  or  displayed  any  abnormal  behavior  since  2012.  An  evaluation  of
Applicant’s  MCMI  test  results  showed,  inter  alia,  an  appropriate  amount  of  self-
disclosure  and  that  no  defensive  test-taking  attitudes  were  apparent.  Applicant  was
cooperative  throughout  the  evaluation.  Dr.  3  stated,  “The  personality  assessment  was
consistent  with  his  presentation  which  is  an  individual  who  is  guarded,  shy,  mostly
introverted  and  has  low  self-esteem.”  She  also  responded  to  Dr.  2’s  point  that  future
psychotic episodes can be mitigated by continuing medication compliance by explaining
that Applicant’s level of intelligence, positive family support, reliability, responsibility, and
work-related  compliance  are  also  mitigating  factors.  Dr.  3  related  that  Applicant’s
diagnosis  was  a  schizoaffective  disorder  (by  history).  She  also  offered  a  strong
prognosis  for  Applicant  based  upon  the  level  of  support  he  receives  from  his  parents
and  his  continued  compliance  with  taking  his  medication.  Dr.  3  also  opined  that
Applicant accepts his disorder and the need to stay on his medication and that the last
six to eight years of staying on his medication is evidence of his acceptance. (Tr. at 65-
76, 93, 98, 101; AE A)
Applicant testified that he realizes he has a mental health condition and takes it
seriously. He also realizes he must continue to take his medication. To insure taking his
medication,  he  has  developed  a  regular  schedule  for  taking  it,  which  he  follows.  He
knows how important taking his medication is. If he stopped taking his medication, his
symptoms  would  recur,  which  could  put  him  back into  the  hospital.  He  did  not  like his
hospital experiences and wants to avoid those in the future. He believes his taking the
medication now is different than it was before when he stopped because now he has to
take other medications, not mental health-related, and he accepts taking medication as
a  way  to  promote  his  overall  health  and  wellbeing.  The  only  mental  health  medication
he currently takes  is Abilify  and  he  takes  it  once  in  the  evening  as he has done since
2014. (Tr. at 112-116, 141-142)
