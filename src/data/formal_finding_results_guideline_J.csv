"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  except  SOR  ¶  3.a,  which  he  denied.
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my factual findings.
Applicant  is 43  years old.  He  is a  Moroccan-born  citizen  who  immigrated  to  the
United  States  in  2006.  He  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  and  was  issued  a  U.S.
passport  in  June  2011.  As  of  the  date  of the  hearing,  he  was  single  and did  not  have
any children. (Tr. at 40-45; GE 1, 3; AE E, H)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  Morocco  in  1997  and  obtained  a
bachelor’s degree there in 2002. He attended a community college in the United States
from 2007 to 2012, but he did not earn a degree. In 2006, he received an offer to work
as a linguist for a DOD contractor in Iraq, contingent on obtaining a security clearance.
Meanwhile,  he  has  worked  primarily  as  a  contract  virtual  linguist,  but  he  was
unemployed as of the date of the hearing. He has never held a DOD security clearance.
(Tr. at 7-10, 13, 36-46, 53-58, 113-114, 121-122; GE 1, 2; AE F, G)
All  of  Applicant’s  family  live  in  Morocco.  His  mother,  three  brothers,  and  three
sisters are citizens and residents of Morocco (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c). His father passed away
in approximately 2008. His mother is a 73-year-old housewife. His brothers are ages 52,
39, and 33. His 52-year-old and 39-year-old brothers are self-employed carpenters, and
his  33-year-old  brother  works  as  a  technician  for  a  private  company.  His  sisters  are
ages  48,  46,  and  35.  His  48-year-old  and  35-year-old  sisters are  housewives,  and  his
46-year-old  sister  is  an  assistant  at  a  private  school.  (SOR  ¶  1.h).  Other  than  his  48-
year-old sister, who is widowed, all of his siblings are married with children. He testified
that  none  of  his  sisters’  spouses  have  affiliations  with  the  Moroccan  government  or
military. (Tr. at 22, 58-72, 74-75, 78-79, 116-118; GE 1, 2, 3)
While  Applicant  indicated  in  his  August  2017  security  clearance  application
(SCA) that he communicated regularly with his brothers and sisters, he testified that his
only contact with family in Morocco was with his mother and 33-year-old brother. They,
along with his 33-year-old brother’s wife and minor child,  live together in an apartment
Applicant  purchased  for  his  mother,  as  further  discussed  below.  He  speaks  with  his
mother and 33-year-old brother almost daily, primarily through group chat on WhatsApp.
He  traveled  to  Morocco  to  visit  his  family  and  friends  in  approximately  2008,  2011,
2013, and for nearly three months in both 2016 and 2019. He testified that none of his
family members in Morocco are aware that he is seeking a security clearance or that he
has  received  an offer to  work as  a  linguist  for a  DOD contractor.  (Tr. at  16-17, 50-53,
58-72, 74-75, 91-93, 105, 112-114, 116-118, 125-126, 133-134; GE 1, 2, 3)
Applicant  testified  that  he  gave  his  mother  money  when  he  visited  her  in
Morocco, and he also provided money to some family members so that they could visit
her in Morocco when she was sick; however, he had not sent money to his mother in a
long time. He clarified that his disclosure in his SCA that he provided financial support of
$6,000 annually to his mother (SOR ¶ 1.h) occurred only once, in approximately 2016.
He testified that no family member in Morocco was relying on him for financial support
as of the date of the hearing, as his siblings were financially independent. (Tr. at 58-72,
115-116; GE 1, 2, 3)
Applicant  also  has  five  cousins  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Morocco:  two
are  police  officers  (SOR  ¶  1.e),  two  serve  in  the  Moroccan  military,  and  one  is  retired
from  the  Moroccan  military  (SOR  ¶  1.f).  He  testified  and  disclosed  in  his  2018
counterintelligence (CI) screening that his 56-year-old cousin retired from the Moroccan
military in approximately 2009, and his last contact with this cousin was during his 2016
trip to Morocco; his 40-year-old and 34-year-old cousins began serving in the Moroccan
military in 2000 and 2004, respectively, and his last contact with these cousins was in
2012  and  2002,  respectively;  and  he  was  unaware  of  the  ranks  that  all  three  cousins
held  in  the  Moroccan  military  but  indicated  that  they  served  in  the  infantry.  He  also
testified and disclosed in his CI screening that his 39-year-old and 34-year-old cousins
were police officers in Morocco since 2007 and 2008, respectively, and his last contact
with these cousins was in 2008 and 2002, respectively. (Tr. at 72-78, 118-119; GE 3)
Applicant  has  two  childhood friends  who are  citizens  and  residents  of  Morocco,
one  of  whom  is  a  police  officer  (SOR  ¶  1.g).  He  testified  that  he  had  only  occasional
contact with the childhood friend in Morocco who is a police officer, and he last saw this
friend during his 2019 trip to Morocco. He testified that he did not have any contact with
his other childhood friend. (Tr. at 16-17, 75-78, 119-120; GE 1, 2, 3)
In approximately 2008, Applicant opened a bank account in Morocco (SOR ¶ 1.l).
He  testified  that  he  did  so  to  hold  the  money  necessary  for  his  land  purchase,  as
discussed below. He estimated in his 2018 CI screening that the balance of this account
was  approximately  $9,000  USD.  In  late  2013,  he  purchased  an  apartment  in  Morocco
for  $50,000  USD  (SOR  ¶  1.j).  He  purchased  the  apartment  for  his  mother  to  live.  He
intends to sell the property when his mother passes away and transfer the profit to the
United States. In 2016, he purchased land in Morocco for $30,000 USD (SOR ¶1.k). He
did  so  as  an  investment,  as  he  intends  to  build  commercial  property  on  the  land  and
then rent or sell it. He testified that his land purchase was not a reflection of any loyalty
to Morocco. As of the date of the hearing, his 33-year-old brother was overseeing and
managing the development of the land, which consisted of construction of a coffee shop
with an apartment on top. (Tr. at 16-17, 50-53, 58-72, 93-105, 109-112, 123-125; GE 1,
3)
Applicant’s former girlfriend and ex-fiancée is a citizen of Somalia, and she has
children living in Somalia (SOR ¶ 1.d). She is a 42-year-old permanent resident of the
United  States.  He  testified  that  she  was  never  a  citizen  of  Syria.  He  met  her  in
approximately 2013 or 2014, when he worked for a refugee shelter in the United States
in  which  she  was  a  former  resident,  after  she  had  fled  Somalia  at  age  ten  to  Saudi
Arabia and then Syria before receiving refugee status to come to the United States. She
has  six  children:  three  reside  in  the  United  States,  two  reside  in  Somalia,  and  one
resides in Europe. He provided approximately $3,000 in financial support to her parents,
who are also citizens of Somalia (SOR  ¶ 1.i). He testified that his relationship with her
was on and off from approximately 2013 to 2017, as she became engaged to another
individual in late 2015, and then yet again another individual in approximately 2019. He
testified  that  he  had  no  intentions  of  reuniting  with  his  ex-fiancée,  and  he  last  had
contact with her in approximately June 2019. He testified that he no longer had any ties
to her, her parents, or any Somali citizen. (Tr. at 16-17, 20, 46-50, 79-91, 126-134, 152;
GE 2, 3)
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant rented an apartment in the United States.
He  has  a  checking  account  in  the  United  States  with  a  balance  of  approximately
$30,000.  He  believed  he  has  a  retirement  account  in  the  United  States  related  to  a
previous  employer,  but  he  was  unaware  of  its  value.  He  also  owns  a  car.  He  testified
that he has no intentions of returning to Morocco to live. He testified that he is loyal to
the  United  States.  He  received  a  charter  membership  certificate  in  2012  for  his
participation  and  contribution  to  the  National  Language  Service  Corps.  He  was
presented a team player award in 2014. He was awarded a certificate of appreciation in
2015 in recognition for three years of service to a former employer. (Tr. at 46, 53-54, 66,
105-106, 112, 120-123, 134-135; GE 1; AE B, C, D)
CRIMINAL
Applicant  was  arrested  in  December  2015  and  charged  with:  (1)  assault  and
battery  (SOR  ¶  2.a);  (2)  stalking  with  reasonable  fear  of  death,  assault,  etc.  (SOR  ¶
2.b); (3) using profane or threating language by means of telephone, cell broadcast, or
text (SOR ¶ 2.c); and (4) causing a telephone to ring, with or without intent to talk, with
intent  to  annoy  (SOR  ¶  2.d).  Applicant  testified  that  his  ex-fiancée,  as  discussed
previously,  reported  him  to  the  police  in  late  2015  after  he  questioned  her  upon
discovering  that  she  had  gotten  engaged  to  another  individual.  He  pled  guilty  to  the
fourth charge and charges one through three were nolle prossed. He was sentenced to
180 days  in  jail,  suspended,  fined $92,  and  ordered not have  any  contact  with  his ex-
fiancée  and  her  family.  She  obtained  a  two-year  protective  order  against  him  in  April
2016, which was dissolved by the court in May 2017 at her request. He does not have
any other criminal-related incidents. (Tr. at 16-17, 54-56, 79-91, 106-109, 112, 114-115;
GE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A)
PERSONAL CONDUCT
The SOR alleged that Applicant  deliberately falsified his response to section 22
of his 2017 SCA, because he failed to list the assault and battery charge, as set forth in
SOR ¶ 2.a, and the charge of causing a telephone to ring, with or without intent to talk,
with intent to annoy, as set forth in SOR ¶ 2.d (SOR ¶ 3.a). Section 22 instructed that he
report information regardless of whether the record in his case was sealed, expunged,
or  otherwise  stricken  from  the  court  record,  or  the  charge  was  dismissed.  Section  22
also  inquired  whether,  in  the  seven  years  prior  to  completing  his  SCA,  he  had  been
issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against
him; he had been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, marshal or any other type of law
enforcement  official;  he  had  been  charged,  convicted,  or  sentenced  of  a  crime  in  any
court; or he had been or was at the time of completing his SCA on probation or parole. It
also  inquired  whether he  was  at  the  time  of  completing  his  SCA  on  trial  or  awaiting  a
trial on criminal charges.
Applicant  disclosed,  in  response  to  section  22  of  his  2017  SCA,  his  April  2016
conviction for “cause telephone/pager to ring to annoy.” In so disclosing, he stated that
he was in a relationship with his then girlfriend, the complainant, when she reported to
the  police  that  he  was  bothering  her.  He  stated  that  the  court  issued  a  two-year
protective order prohibiting him from having contact with his ex-girlfriend or her children.
He also stated that she dropped the protective order in May 2017, after which time they
resumed their relationship. (GE 1, 2)
Morocco
The United States considers Morocco an important regional security, trade, and
development  partner,  and  Morocco  is  a  designated  Major  Non-NATO  Ally.  It  is  a
member of the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat the Islamic State. In 2017, the United
States and Morocco launched an “Initiative to Address Homegrown Violent Extremists”
under the auspices of the multilateral Global Counterterrorism Forum.
In April 2019, the U.S. Department of State raised the travel advisory for Morocco
to  “Level  2:  Exercise  Increased  Caution,”  due  to  terrorism.  Terrorist  attacks  targeting
tourist sites, official Moroccan government facilities, and the U.S. Consulate and Public
Affairs  annex  in  Casablanca  took  place  in  Morocco  in  2003,  2007,  2011,  and  2018.
Extremists claiming allegiance to ISIS targeted and murdered two Scandinavian tourists
in  the  2018  attack.  In  addition,  while  Morocco  is  viewed  as  one  of  the  more  stable
countries in West Africa, protests reflecting grievances over the economy, governance,
police  brutality,  and  high-level  cronyism  and  corruption  have  surged  in  the  historically
marginalized north and east since 2016.
Somalia
The  United  States  formally  recognized  the  federal  government  of  Somalia  in
January  2013.  In  July  2018,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  issued  a  level  4  travel
advisory  for  Somalia,  advising  U.S.  citizens  not  to  travel  to  Somalia  due  to  terrorism,
crime,  and  piracy.  It  also  assessed  Mogadishu  as  being  a  critical  threat  location  for
terrorist  activity  directed  at  or  affecting  U.S.  Government  interests.  Violent  crime  is
common throughout Somalia and no area is considered immune from violence, as the
potential exists  for hostile  acts,  either  targeted  or  random,  against  foreign  nationals  at
any  time  throughout  the  country.  The  U.S.  Government  cannot  provide  consular
services to U.S. citizens in Somalia.
In March 2008, the U.S. Secretary of State designated Somali-based Al-Shabaab
as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The group remained active in Somalia throughout
2017.  In  what  is  believed  to  be  the  single  deadliest  attack  of  the  group’s  history  in
Somalia,  Al-Shabaab  detonated  multiple  bombs  in  Mogadishu  in  October  2017,  killing
more than 500 people. Somalia’s porous borders contribute to regional insecurity, as Al-
Shabaab  and  others  continue  to  move  throughout  the  region  mostly  undetected.  With
little  law  enforcement  cooperation  between  the  federal  government  of  Somalia  and
Somali state governments, the ability of U.S. law enforcement to investigate suspected
terrorists, terrorist incidents, and kidnappings is hampered.
",True
"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  (Answer),  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations
except SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.a, and 2.b, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact. He is 29 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was engaged to
be  married  to  his  girlfriend  of  11  years,  who  is  the  mother of  their  two  minor  children.
(Answer; Tr. at 11-14, 47-48, 77, 91-97, 115, 124-125, 135-140, 144-146; GE 1)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2008. He earned an associate’s degree
in 2016 and a bachelor’s degree in 2018. As of the date of the hearing, he has worked
as  an  information  technology  help  desk  analyst  for  his  current  employer,  a  DOD
contractor,  since  November  2017.  He  also  worked  as  a  part-time  children’s  football
official since 2008. He has never held a security clearance. (Tr. at 9-10, 15, 47, 89-91,
96-97, 135-138; GE 1; AE A)
In  approximately  May  2009,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving
under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs, first offense, and purchase or possession
of  alcohol.  He  was  18  years  old.  This  was  his  first  criminal-related  offense.  He  was
driving  a  friend  to  7-11  when  the  police  pulled  him  over  for  a  broken  tail  light.  He
testified  that  he  had  previously  been  at  a  party  where  he  had  taken  a  sip  of  a  drink
thinking it was juice, but when he realized it contained alcohol he “tried to quickly spit it
out.” His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .002%. The charges were nolle prossed. He
testified that his attorney told him and his father that they did not have to worry  as the
case was closed. (SOR ¶ 1.a; Tr. at 48-52, 56-57, 97-106; GE 1-4)
In approximately May 2010, when Applicant was 19 years old, the charge of DUI
of  alcohol  or  drugs,  as  set  forth  above,  was  reinstated,  to  his  surprise.  He  was
represented  by  an  attorney,  and  this  case  was  consolidated  with  his  December  2010
charge  of  marijuana  possession  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  2.b),  as  discussed  below.  Applicant
testified  that  his  attorney  advised  him  to  plead  guilty,  because  he  could  not  afford  to
fight the charge and he did not want to delay his efforts at the time to enlist in the U.S.
military. He pled guilty to DUI of alcohol or drugs in February 2011, and was sentenced
to 60 days in jail, suspended, fined $500, and his driver’s license was suspended for 12
months. (SOR ¶ 1.a; Tr. at 48-52, 56-57, 97-110; GE 1-4)
In  approximately  December  2010,  at  age  20,  Applicant  was  charged  with
marijuana  possession.  He  testified  that  at  his  sister’s  request,  he  drove  to  a  fast  food
restaurant to buy her food, using her car as he did not own a car at the time, when he
was pulled over by the police for failure to yield. The police officer found an empty bag
in the car and claimed it was an “empty marijuana pack.” Applicant testified that though
he was aware that his sister smoked marijuana on occasion, he was unaware that she
had any marijuana-related paraphernalia in the car. He was given a ticket to show up to
court. He was represented by an attorney, and this case was consolidated with his May
2010 charge of DUI alcohol or drugs (SOR ¶ 1.a), as set forth above. He testified that
his attorney told him he was just getting a ticket. In February 2011, he also pled guilty to
the amended charged of paraphernalia possession. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail
with 85 days suspended, placed on unsupervised probation for 3 years, and fined $416.
He spent about a weekend in jail. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.b; Tr. at 52-60, 103-110; GE 1, 5)
In  approximately  May  2011,  at  age  20,  Applicant  was  charged  with  marijuana
possession,  driving  with  a  suspended  or  revoked  license,  and  driving  with  a  defective
brake light, all of which occurred on a military base. He testified that he was pulled over
on the base in which he worked while smoking a Black & Mild cigar. He testified that the
cigar did not contain marijuana, and he believed the police pulled him over because of
racial  profiling,  as  he  is  an  African  American  man.  He  testified  that  the  car  he  was
driving was a relative’s car, as he still did not own a car at the time, and the police found
marijuana in the car. Applicant denied that the marijuana belonged to him and testified
that he was unaware of any marijuana present in the car. He was given a ticket to show
up  to  court.  He  was  represented  by  a  court-appointed  attorney.  He  testified  that  he
underwent random pre-trial drug testing for five to six months, and approximated that he
was  drug  tested  five  to  ten  times  during  this  period.  He  pled  guilty  in  a  federal  district
court  to  the  infraction of  driving  without a  valid  operator’s  license and  was  fined  $100;
the remaining charges were dismissed. (SOR ¶ 1.c; Tr. at 58-63, 110-116; GE 6-7)
Applicant attributed his criminal involvement from 2009 to 2011 to not fulfilling his
father’s expectations after he graduated from high school. He described his father, who
is honorably retired from the U.S. military, as an “accomplished” man, and he felt like he
was  a  disappointment.  He  “got  depressed.”  He  testified  that  he  was  young,  he  made
mistakes trying to find himself, and he associated with the wrong crowd. (Tr. at 46-48,
77, 91-97, 115, 135-140, 144-146; AE A)
In approximately December 2014, at age 24, Applicant was charged with stealing
from a military  exchange  an  iPhone  USB  charging  cable  and a  pair  of  gloves,  with  an
aggregate value of less than $1,000, and assaulting an employee of the exchange.  He
was at the commissary visiting his mother, who worked there. He testified that he was
hurriedly shopping, without a cart and while on his phone, when he accidentally walked
out of  the exchange  with  a $10  cellular phone  charger  before  paying  for it, as  he  was
rushing  to  get  home  to  his  pregnant  fiancée.  When  he  then  attempted  to  pay  for  the
charger,  he  was  not  permitted  to  do  so.  He  denied  assaulting  any  employee  of  the
exchange. He was handcuffed and then released and given a ticket to show up to court.
He  testified  that  he  consulted  with  a  private  attorney,  but  elected  to  accept  a  court-
appointed  attorney  instead.  In  March  2015,  he  pled  guilty  in  a  federal  district  court  to
theft of government property and was sentenced to six months of supervised probation
and fined $150.  He  testified  that  he  chose  to  plead  guilty  because  “there  really  wasn’t
nothing I could really do to get around it.” He continued, “I just wanted to move forward.
I accepted it.” (SOR ¶ 1.d; Tr. at 42, 63-67, 115-124; GE 1, 8-9)
In  approximately  August  2015,  at  age  24,  Applicant  was  charged  with  felony
possession with intent to distribute five+ pounds of marijuana, felony transporting five+
pounds of marijuana, and resisting arrest. As of the date of the hearing, this was his last
criminal  offense.  He  stated  the  following  in  his  2017  security  clearance  application
(SCA):
An  unknown  package  arrived  at  my  parents[’]  home.  I  wrote  [“]wrong
address[”] on the package without opening the package. At this point I am
completely unaware of what the package contained. I put the package in
my  car  with  intentions  to  return  it  to  the  post  office.  I  am  unaware  that
there  were  unmarked  police  cars  parked  around  my  neighborhood
watching me. By the time I drove to the end of my street, I was pulled over
by  several  police  officers.  I  was  taken  to  the  police  station  and  was
informed  the  package  contained  marijuana.  I  cooperated  with  the  police
hoping  to  find  [anyone]  who  could  have  used  my  address  without  my
knowledge or consent. I was the one who suffered being charged for this
offense I had no intentions of committing.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-78, 124-135, 140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A)
Applicant reiterated the same narrative at hearing. He testified that this incident
occurred  in  April  2015.  At  the  the  time,  he,  his fiancée,  and  his  children  lived  with  his
parents in their home. He testified that when the police took him to his parents’ home,
where he was observed to have received the package and after they stopped him as he
was  en  route  to  the  post  office,  they  entered  the  home  aggressively  to  search  it.  He
testified that the police assumed he would be resistant because of his size, and things
got  “crazy”  because  everyone  in  the  home  at  the  time,  to  include  his  mother  and
fiancée, demanded that the police show them their search warrant. He testified that the
police  did  not  find  anything  in  the  home.  He  stated  in  his  SCA  and  testified  that  the
federal  authorities  told  him  they  did  not  believe  he  was  involved  with  the  marijuana
package  and did not pursue  criminal charges  against him,  but  county  authorities  were
looking for a conviction and he fit the bill.  He testified that the county had a conviction
rate  of  approximately  97%,  and  he  believed  his  ethnicity  factored  into  their  pursuit  of
criminal  charges  against  him,  which  did  not  occur until  approximately  six  months  after
the  incident,  in  August  2015;  Applicant’s  father  echoed  the  same  sentiment  in  the
reference letter he wrote for Applicant. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-78, 124-135,
140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A)
Applicant  was  represented  by  an  attorney.  He  pled  guilty  to  possession  with
intent to distribute five+ pounds of marijuana. He testified that he did so because he was
scared and  he  did not  believe  he  had another choice,  as  his attorney  told  him  that  he
was facing five to ten years in jail, his attorney’s fees were $25,000, and he had to think
about  his  young  family.  He  testified  that  his  attorney  advised  him  to  plead  guilty
because “it’s about the jury and the area you’re living in and the county of how you look,
you fit the profile.” He testified that his attorney told him that “if you plead guilty, you can
start fresh  and  you  can  start  your  life  over.”  He  also  testified  that  he  believed  he  was
pleading  guilty  to  a  misdemeanor,  because  he  was  told  such  by  his  attorney.  The
charge of “resisting arrest” was dropped because he was compliant. He was sentenced
to  10  years  in  jail,  with  9  years  and  1  month  suspended,  his  driver’s  license  was
suspended  for  six  months,  and  he  was  fined  $628;  the  remaining  charges  were  nolle
prossed. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-87, 124-135, 140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A)
Applicant served 10 months in jail, from May 2016 to March 2017. He was  then
placed  on  work  release  and  required  to  report  in  person  to  his  probation  officer  once
monthly.  After  several  months,  his  in-person  probation  requirement  was  switched  to
once every three months; it was then lifted and he was required to simply  call into his
probation officer once monthly. He testified that he was drug tested during the period in
which  he  was  on  probation,  initially  once  every  three  months  and  then  randomly.  He
completed  probation  in  August  2018.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  2.b;  Tr.  at  38-46,  67-87,  124-135,
140-141; GE 1, 10-11)
In approximately March 2017, at age 26, Applicant was found by a federal district
court to have violated his federal probation from his March 2015 conviction for theft of
government  property  (SOR  ¶  1.d),  as  a  result  of  his  August  2015  felony  charges,  as
discussed  above  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  2.b).  His  federal  probation  was  revoked  and  he  was
sentenced  to  15  days  in  jail,  with  credit  for  time  served.  He  served  this  time  in
conjunction with the 10 months that he served from 2016 to 2017. (SOR ¶ 1.f; Tr. at 78-
79, 134-135, 140-141; GE 12-14)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  unaware  at  the  time  that  his  guilty  pleas  to  the
charges  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  to  1.e  equated  to  admissions  of  guilt.  He  testified  that  he  was
also unaware that he was developing a criminal record as a result of his guilty pleas. He
testified  that  he  only  began  to  understand  the  meaning  of  his  guilty  pleas  when  he
started  the  security  clearance  process  in  approximately  2017.  He testified  that  had  he
truly understood, he would have taken a “different approach” and he “would have fought
for more than just always pleading, pleading, pleading.” (Tr. at 108-110, 144-146)
Applicant used marijuana at least two to three times in approximately April 2014.
He testified that this was the first time he used marijuana, and  he experimented with it
socially with friends. He stated in his SCA that he did not intend to use marijuana in the
future  because  he  has  two  children  to  support,  he  planned  on  marrying,  and  he
intended  to  continue  his  career  in  information  technology.  He  denied  using  marijuana
after  April  2014,  and  denied  using  it  in  April  2017.  He  testified  that  he  could  not  have
used marijuana in 2017 because he was being drug tested as part of his probation for
his felony conviction (SOR ¶ 1.e), as discussed above. He testified that he had not been
drug tested since he completed probation in August 2018, and he had not yet been drug
tested  by  his  current  employer  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  He  testified  that  he  no
longer socialized with the individuals with whom he used marijuana in 2014. He testified
that if he were ever to find himself in a situation where illegal drugs were being used, or
legal drugs were being misused, he would leave. (SOR ¶ 2.a; Tr. at 79-89, 93-94, 107-
108, 141-142; GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  a  “different  person.”  He  acknowledged  the
mistakes he made in his past, but stressed that “I wake up and do everything differently.
I  got  kids  that  look  up  to  me.”  He  stated  that  he  took  “full  responsibility  and
accountability [for] each of these situations and encounters I have ever had with the law
enforcement.”  Since  he  began  working  for  his  employer  in  November  2017,  he  has
received two pay increases and earned $40,000 annually as of the date of the hearing.
He testified that he has not had  any unfavorable issues at work and his employer was
aware  of  his  criminal history.  He  was  rated  favorably  in  his  2018  performance  review.
He earned a grade point average of 3.8 with his bachelor’s degree. He moved out of his
parents’ home in 2018 and has since rented a home for himself, his fiancée, and their
children. He testified that he is a family man, and he spends time with  them during his
free time. (Tr. at 77, 91-97, 115, 135-140, 144-146; AE A)
Applicant’s father described him as a “good man who has gone through the many
challenges that many of America’s young black men  [go] through . . . .” Having held a
security  clearance  and  worked  as  a  security  manager  during  his  military  career,  his
father stated that Applicant’s character was evidenced by the trust he has earned from
the  various  individuals  who  provided  references  on  his  behalf.  His  coworker  of  two
years  attested  to  his  work  ethic,  professionalism,  timeliness,  and  positivity.  His  former
high-school basketball coach described him as a dedicated family man of strong moral
character. Several other individuals who have known Applicant for a number of years, to
include one who has known him since 1998 and another who has been a fellow referee
since  2014,  reiterated  that  Applicant  possessed  the  character  and  trustworthiness  to
hold a security clearance. (AE A).

"Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  solid  state  technician  who  has  served  in  the  same
capacity  for  over  five  years.  He  first  received  a  security  clearance  in  2016.  He  has
earned an associate’s degree and working toward a bachelor’s degree. He is single and
has no children.  One colleague described him as “confident, a thoughtful guy, he’s [a]
reliable, good worker,” who has not been seen as under the influence of alcohol at work.
(Tr.  20)  Applicant  has  been  imbibing  alcohol  since  he  was  a  teen.  Overall,  his  family
does  not  drink,  although  his  father  and  a  grandfather  have  been  known  to  consume
alcohol on occasions. (Tr. 76)
In  March  2010,  Applicant  was  out  with  co-workers  drinking  “probably  a  beer  an
hour for multiple hours.” (Tr. 40) He got in his car to drive home, then realized he should
not  be  driving.  He  pulled  off  the  road  and  decided  to  “sleep  it  off.”  (Tr.  40)  A  passing
officer woke Applicant and assessed the situation.  Applicant was charged with Driving/
Attempting to Drive Vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (DADV). He was offered
probation before judgment, with six months of probation completed successfully, and he
completed a 12-week alcohol and drug outpatient program.
In April 2012, Applicant was with a group of friends drinking beer on a parking lot
near an apartment building. He was cited with Possession of an alcoholic beverage in
an open container.  Applicant then continued the evening imbibing with his  friends. (Tr.
61)  The  outcome  of  the  citation  was  that  Applicant  was  asked  to  perform  16  hours  of
community service, which he completed successfully. (Tr. 39)
In  September  2015,  Applicant  spent  the  day  socializing  with  friends  at  a  bar.
After a late meal, he left the venue and was stopped by the police for swerving. (Tr. 36)
The officer smelled alcohol and Applicant admitted he had been imbibing. Applicant now
believes  he  had  consumed  six  or  seven  beers.  (Tr.  34)  He  was  given  a  field  sobriety
test, which he passed, then administered a breathalyzer, the results of which were not
disclosed  to  him.  Later,  at  the  station,  he  refused  a  second  breathalyzer.  (Tr.  64)
Ultimately,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  Driving  Vehicle  Under  the  Influence  of
Alcohol (DUI). At a bench trial, the judge found Applicant not guilty, noting that the issue
should  have  been  settled  when  he  passed  the  field  sobriety  test.  Today,  Applicant
maintains  his  innocence  in  the  matter,  but  agrees  “it  was  unwise  for  [him]  to  put
[himself] in that position. If [he] hadn’t been drinking all that day, [he] would have never
raised the officer’s suspicion. And it was just not a smart move to even put [himself] at a
vulnerable state like that.”  (Tr. 35)
In  mid-January  2018,  Applicant  spent  the  day  at  a  bar  for  a  going-away  party.
(Tr.  68)  He  got  a  ride  to  his  grandmother’s  house,  but  later  decided  to  retrieve  his
automobile from the bar. After a field sobriety test, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  Driving  While  Impaired  by  Alcohol  (DWIA).  He  was  pulled  over  for  a  headlight
issue,  and  the  officer  suspected  he  was  under  the  influence.  Looking  back  at  the
incident,  he  now  recognizes  that  he  was  intoxicated  at  the  time.  (Tr.  29-30)  In  court,
Applicant was found guilty, sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended 60 days, and placed
on probation until late 2019.  He became subject to an interlock system on his vehicle.
(Tr.  72)  His  probation  was  terminated  early,  in  December  2018,  on  petition  after  he
finished  all  other  court-ordered  requirements.  (Tr.  31)  He  was  initially  advised  by  an
attorney to cease using alcohol, then ordered to stop drinking by the court as part of his
probation. As of May 2018, he had not committed to remaining sober. (Tr. 73) As of the
time of the hearing, however, he feels committed to remaining sober. (Tr. 74)
Although he has does not follow the program’s steps, has no sponsor, and does
not subscribe to the program’s religious underpinnings, Applicant has attended over 140
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, which he still attends. (Tr. 74-75, 79; Ex. M) He
attended a one weekend inpatient program, finished 26 weeks of aftercare counseling,
and completed a 16-hour on-line drug and alcohol education course. (see Ex. C, Ex. M,
and Ex. N; Tr. 42) There, it was determined he had a “moderate drinking problem that . .
. [had the] potential to be way worse if [he did not] get it in check.” (Tr. 42) Elsewhere,
he was noted as a “moderate to high-risk” drinker. (Tr. 43) Applicant described his past
pattern of drinking as being “more consistent with binge drinking.” (Tr. 56)
This experience and subsequent rehabilitation have changed Applicant’s attitude
toward alcohol abuse, and it is his intent to endeavor to remain sober and not return to
alcohol  “for  the  foreseeable  future.”  (Tr.  77)  He  no  longer  needs  alcohol  to  have  fun,
and  he  recognizes  that  it  adversely  affects  his  judgment.  Alcohol-free,  he  is  enjoying
new  hobbies,  outdoor  activities,  and  working  on  more  fulfilling  relationships.  He  is
currently dating, but not cohabitating with, a woman who infrequently drinks alcohol. (Tr.
51,  89)  She  is  a  caring  individual  who  supports  his  sobriety  and  acknowledges  that
alcohol  was  adversely  affecting  Applicant’s  life.  (Tr.  88)  She  encouraged  him  to  make
changes in his life regarding alcohol. (Tr. 88) When they do move in together, they will
most likely keep alcohol in the home. (Tr. 51) Applicant stays away from all-day sports
viewing  in  bars  with  his  friends.  (Tr.  77)  He  is  contrite  concerning  his  past  alcohol
abuse. (Tr. 53-54)
",False
"Under  Guideline  D,  the  Government  alleged  that  in  November  2001,  Applicant
committed an indecent sexual act with his three-year-old daughter; and that in February
2005, he pleaded guilty a charge of indecency with a child, a second-degree felony (SOR
1.a)  Under Guideline J  (SOR  2.a) and  Guideline  E  (SOR 3.a),  the  Government  cross-
alleged  the  information  in  SOR  1.a  as  disqualifying  criminal  conduct  and  personal
conduct, respectively.
Under Guideline E, the Government also alleged that in January 2017, Applicant
intentionally made a false official statement to the Government during a personal subject
interview with an investigator about Applicant’s intent during the November 2001 incident
addressed in SOR 1.a (SOR 3.b).
Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the
federal government for unpaid taxes for the 2004 (SOR 4.a), 2006 (SOR 4.b), 2007 (SOR
4.c),  and  2011  (SOR  4.d)  tax  years  totaling  $114,985.  At  the  hearing,  Department
Counsel moved to withdraw SOR 4.d and it was stricken. As a result, the total amount of
tax debt at issue in this case was reduced to $58,141. (Tr. 10)
In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a, 2.a, and
3.a. He denied with explanation any intent to falsify or mislead as alleged in SOR 3.b. As
to Guideline F, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 4.b and 4.c, and denied SOR
4.a. In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old and employed as a project and logistics manager by a
defense  contractor for whom  he  has  worked  since  January  2016.  Applicant  served  on
active duty in the United States Army between 1991 and 1995. He was trained as a medic
in the Army and continued to work as an emergency medical technician and paramedic
after  leaving  the  military.  From  September  2003  until  October  2004,  Applicant  worked
overseas as a paramedic for a defense contractor. (GX 1; Tr. 51 – 54)
Applicant has been married twice. He and his first wife were married between 1992
and 1997. Applicant remarried in 1998 and had two children, a son, now age 16, and a
daughter, now age 21. Applicant and his second wife separated in 2005 and divorced in
2007;  however,  in  March  2010,  they  moved  in  together  for  financial  and  parenting
reasons. By the terms of their divorce, Applicant has principal custody of their 16-year-
old son. This arrangement appears to have been beneficial for all concerned. (GX 1; GX
5; Tr. 41)
In Section 26 of his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that his income tax refunds for the
preceding six years were applied to an $8,000 debt for unpaid taxes from 2009. During
the  ensuing  background  investigation,  investigators  identified  an  unsatisfied  tax  lien
against Applicant for the 2011 tax year. During a January 2017 subject interview with a
government  investigator,  Applicant  stated  he  had  no  knowledge  of  that  2011  tax  lien;
however, he confirmed his non-payment of his 2009 federal income taxes, explaining that
his  employer  did  not  withhold  his  taxes  as  he  had  expected  while  Applicant  worked
overseas. In November 2018, in response to interrogatories from DOD adjudicators and
in response to the SOR, Applicant provided information that showed he owes $16,062.98
in unpaid taxes for 2006, and $9,778.02 for unpaid taxes in 2007, as alleged in SOR 4.b
and 4.c, respectively. (Answer; GX 1; GX 4; GX 5; Tr. 47 – 51, 56 – 58)
Applicant also has denied that he owes $32,301 in unpaid taxes for the 2004 tax
year as alleged at SOR 4.a. However, in his November 2018 response to interrogatories,
he provided a May 2018 letter from the IRS showing he owed that amount for the 2004
tax year after his $283 tax refund for 2017 was applied. At his hearing, Applicant averred
he visited an IRS office in his state and was told that he did not owe any past-due taxes
for 2004. Applicant did not provide any support for that claim and his explanations for not
being able to corroborate his claims in this regard were not plausible. As to all of his past-
due  taxes,  apart from diversion  of  his income  tax  refunds by  the  IRS  to  satisfy  his  tax
debts, Applicant has not taken any identifiable action to arrange for repayment or other
resolution of this matter. (Answer; GX 4; Tr. 31, 42 – 47)
The matters alleged in SOR 1.a, 2.a, 3.a and 3.b arise from a single event. On or
about November 1, 2001, Applicant was home with his then-three-year-old daughter. The
child came into the bathroom and saw Applicant as he was coming out of the shower.
Rather than cover himself, Applicant had his daughter touch and rub his penis for sexual
gratification. In October 2003, Applicant’s wife was expecting their younger child, whom
they  knew  was  a  boy.  At  some  point,  his  wife  found  herself  explaining  this  physical
differences  between  boys  and  girls.  Applicant’s  daughter, who  was  then  six  years old,
told her mother she already knew  what a penis was because she had seen her father
without  clothes  on.  The  child  went  on  to  describe  for  her  mother  what  had  transpired
between  Applicant  and  his daughter in  2001.  Applicant’s  wife  called  the  police  and an
investigation began that culminated in May 2004 with a grand jury indictment of Applicant
on a charge of indecency with a child, a felony. Applicant was arrested in October 2004
when he returned from his job overseas. In February 2005, Applicant pleaded guilty to
that charge and given a suspended adjudication of guilt for five years, during which he
was  under  supervised  probation,  required  to  undergo  counseling,  and  ordered  to
complete 250 hours of community service. Between February 2005 and February 2010,
Applicant  was  prohibited  from  having  any  contact  with  his  children  or  with  any  person
under  age  17.  After  he  successfully  completed  probation,  the  felony  charge  was
dismissed; however, Applicant then had to register as a sex offender in State A where he
lived and where the offense occurred. In 2010, he moved to State B, where he still lives
and works, and registered as a sex offender there as well. His status as a registered sex
offender is to remain for 30 years, or until March 2040. Applicant acknowledged that he
is embarrassed  by  his conduct  but avers that  he  does not  try  to  hide  what  he  did.  He
testified that some of his neighbors know he is a registered sex offender either because
he  told  them  or  they  learned  of  it  through  online  public  information.  Applicant  is  now
eligible to petition State B for removal from the registry for sex offenders because he has
lived and worked in State B without incident or violation for at least 10 years. As of the
hearing, he had not yet filed a petition for removal. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; GX 5; Tr.
14, 30 – 31, 39 – 41)
During  his  January  2017  subject  interview  with  a  government  investigator,
Applicant discussed his conduct with his daughter. SOR 3.b alleges that he deliberately
withheld information from the investigator in an attempt to mislead the government about
his  conduct.  Specifically,  it  was  alleged  that  Applicant  “lied  .  .  .  .  by  stating  that  [he]
inadvertently exposed [himself] to [his] daughter, while, in truth, [he] deliberately had [his]
daughter touch [his] genitals.” The summary of interview states, in relevant part, only that
“[Applicant] exposed self to daughter.” It then goes on to recount what happened after
Applicant’s conduct became known to his wife and he was convicted of indecency with a
child. The summary of the January 2017 interview does not reflect any discussion of his
intent  at  the  time  of  his  misconduct.  In  short,  there  is  no  basis  for  the  Government’s
allegation  that  Applicant  intended  to  make  a  false  statement  or  representation  about
anything material to an examination of his sexual behavior with daughter. (GX 5; Tr. 60)
During Applicant’s probation, he complied with all of the court-ordered conditions
of his sentence. He paid all fines and costs, completed his community service, and he
has  not  violated  any  laws  or  ordinances  since  his  conviction.  He  also  received  court-
ordered sex offender counseling during which he examined not only his own conduct, but
factors that may have contributed to it. Prominent among those factors was Applicant’s
own  experience  as  a  victim  of  sexual  molestation.  Applicant  has  not  sought  or  been
referred for any additional counseling or treatment since 2010. Applicant also avers that
he  now  has  a  good  relationship  with  his  daughter.  Additionally,  Applicant  has  a  good
reputation for reliability with his current employer. (AX A; Tr. 31, 38 – 39, 55 – 56, 63)
",True
"Under Guideline G, the Government alleged that Applicant consumed alcohol, at
times  to  excess,  from  the  time  he  was  a  teenager  until  at  least  2016,  and  that  he  still
consumes alcohol (SOR 1.a). It was further alleged that between 2006 and 2013, he was
arrested on six occasions for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and other charges incidental
to his DWI arrests (SOR 1.b – 1.g).
Under Guideline J, the Government alleged that between June 2001 and August
2012, Applicant was cited, charged, or arrested 11 times for various moving violations,
failure to appear in court, and driving on a suspended license (SOR 2.a – 2.k); and that
in March 2018, Applicant was cited for speeding, to which he pleaded nolo contendere
(SOR 2.l). Additionally, the DWI arrests alleged at SOR 1.b – 1.g were cross-alleged as
criminal conduct (SOR 2.m).
Under Guideline E, the allegations at SOR 1.a – 1.g (SOR 3.a) and at SOR 2.a –
2.m (SOR 3.b) were cross-alleged as adverse personal conduct (SOR 2.m). Additionally,
it was alleged that Applicant falsified his answer to the first question in e-QIP Section 24
(Alcohol  Use)  by  listing  a  DWI  arrest  in  January  2007  but  failing  to  list  all  of  the  DWI
arrests delineated in SOR 1.b – 1.g (SOR 3.c).
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  3.c,  but  admitted  all  of  the
remaining SOR allegations. He also provided an attached statement in which, inter alia,
he  explained  his  denial  of  SOR  3.c.  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old and employed as a software engineer for a large defense
contractor.  He  grew  up  in  State  A,  where  he  earned  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in
computer science and mathematics in May 2016. In June 2017, Applicant was hired by
his current employer while completing graduate studies and working on a dissertation for
his Master of Science degree in computer science. He became a full-time employee the
day  he  received  his  Master’s  degree  in  December  2017.  Applicant  established  an
excellent  academic  record  in  college,  graduating  magna  cum  laude.  As  a  graduate
student, he compiled a 3.75 GPA. In June 2017, Applicant moved from State A to State
B, his current residence, to accept the defense contractor position he now holds. During
the summer of 2014, Applicant held a security clearance required for his internship with
a federal agency. (GX 1; GX 2; AX B; Tr. 7, 9, 48).
As alleged in SOR 1.a, Applicant began consuming alcohol, at times to excess, as
a  teenager.  Between  high  school  and  July  2013,  his  use  of  alcohol  resulted  in  the
convictions for DWI and related charges delineated in SOR 1.b – 1.g. Applicant last used
alcohol  to  excess  in  June  2016,  but  he  still  consumes  alcohol  in  moderation  in  social
settings.  He  never  has  been  diagnosed  with  any  alcohol  use  disorder,  such  as  being
alcohol dependent. His DWI sentences have not resulted in more than a few days in jail
awaiting  initial  court  appearances,  and  he  has  completed  court-ordered  alcohol  safety
awareness  classes  on  multiple  occasions.  Those  classes  included  evaluations  of  his
alcohol use and did not result in any clinical diagnoses. (Answer; GX 1 – 5; Tr. 32 – 41,
52 – 55)
As  alleged  at  SOR  2.a  –  2.l,  Appellant  committed  numerous  traffic  violations,
ranging from simple speeding to reckless driving between 2001 and 2018. He also was
cited  for  various  technical  infractions,  such  as  improper  insurance,  and  defective
equipment and devices. On four occasions, Appellant was charged with failure to appear
in response to traffic citations. On four other occasions, he also was charged with driving
on an expired or suspended driver’s license. Applicant did not commit any such violations
between 2012 and March 2018, when he pleaded nolo contendere to driving 55 mph in a
45 mph zone in State B. That most recent traffic violation occurred in State B, six years
after his last violation in State A. Although all of the SOR 2.a  – 2.l allegations involved
violations of law, none of them resulted in arrest as alleged. Only the allegation at SOR
2.m,  which  cross-alleged  the  DWIs  addressed  in  SOR  1.b  –  1.g  involved  conduct  for
which  Applicant  faced  possible  incarceration.  In  early  2017,  when  Applicant  was  first
being considered for his current job, he did not own a car or hold a valid driver’s license
because of his many traffic violations before 2012. To have his State A driving privileges
restored,  Applicant  researched  and  satisfied  all  outstanding  requirements  in  State  A
before moving to State B. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 4 – 6; Tr. 36, 47 – 48)
Applicant denied that he intended to falsify his answers to e-QIP Section 24 (Use
of Alcohol) questions by omitting adverse information about his DWIs. When he submitted
his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed as required by Section 22 (Police Record) nearly all of the
non-DWI traffic offenses  that occurred in the seven years preceding the e-QIP. In that
same section, Applicant also listed the DWI offenses alleged at SOR 1.f and 1.g. At e-
QIP Section 24, he stated that alcohol had a negative impact in the previous seven years
due to multiple DWIs between 2007 and 2013. The only DWI he did not disclose was the
oldest offense from December 2006. Applicant claimed that, at most, he misunderstood
what was required in Section 24. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 25, 27, 41 – 42)
Applicant was candid and forthright in his testimony.  In response to the adverse
information  presented  by  the  Government,  Applicant  admitted  the  accuracy  of  the
allegations. He also acknowledged that before his last DWI arrest in 2013, he behaved
irresponsibly by drinking too much and generally disregarding rules and regulations about
driving and other societal norms. He had matriculated at a state university in the fall of
2002 but left after a semester. By contrast, Applicant described two events in 2013 as a
turning point in his life. Although he re-enrolled in college in the spring of 2013, his risky
lifestyle and poor choices continued. But the day he was released from jail after his May
2013  DWI  arrest,  he  learned  his  infant  cousin  had  died  suddenly.  A  few  months  later,
when Applicant was arrested for his last DWI, he had been drinking at a party celebrating
his  great  grandmother’s  100th  birthday.  She  died  soon  after  and  Applicant  claims  he
realized he had to change his life for the better. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 26 – 29)
After  July  2013,  Applicant’s  alcohol  use  declined  markedly  and  he  was  last
intoxicated in June 2016. Applicant has not driven after having anything to drink since his
July 2013 arrest, but he admits that before then he drove drunk on a number of occasions
without  being  stopped.  Applicant  still  consumes  alcohol,  albeit,  on  infrequent  social
occasions  and  only  in  moderation.  He  also  avers  that  he  leads  a  more  active  lifestyle
characterized by physical fitness activities, and that his job and his volunteer work are not
conducive  to  a  lifestyle  that  includes  more  than  moderate  and  responsible  drinking.
(Answer; GX 2; Tr. 29 – 35, 38 – 41)
After re-enrolling in college, Applicant established a superior academic record and
graduated  on  time  with  a  3.5  cumulative  GPA.  He  compiled  a  3.75  GPA  for  his  post-
graduate degree. During his undergraduate career, Applicant’s academic record qualified
him as an ambassador in the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and
Universities  (HBCU).  Currently,  he  is  a  member  of  the  National  Black  Engineers
Association and volunteers as a mentor to middle and high school students in State B. In
the workplace, Applicant has earned more than ten awards for his technical expertise and
teamwork. He  also  logs  significant  hours of his own  time  through company-sponsored
volunteer programs. He has a reputation for integrity, reliability, and professionalism. After
initially  being  granted  interim  access  to  classified  information,  Applicant  demonstrated
that he was able and willing to protect such information. (AX A – E; Tr. 32, 42 – 47)

"Applicant is 22 years old, and he was born in the United States. He is engaged,
and his fiancée has a young son who resides with them. He attended school in Iraq and
received  a  high  school  certificate  in  2012,  but  he  does  not  have  a  general  education
diploma. Applicant has worked as a mortgage broker since May 2019. This is Applicant’s
first application for a DOD security clearance. He is seeking a security clearance to be a
linguist for a defense contractor in Iraq, which would increase his salary. (GE 1; Tr. 9-12,
20-23, 26-28, 57-58)
Criminal Conduct:
In March 2012, Applicant was arrested for domestic assault and battery after he
punched his stepmother twice in the face, breaking her nose. He was 14 at the time of
the  arrest,  and  as  a  result  he  spent  a  month  in  juvenile  detention.  After  this  incident,
Applicant’s father sent him to live in Iraq with Applicant’s aunt. (GE 2 at 7; GE 4; GE 3 at
3-4; GE 4; Tr. 59-61)
In  October  2013,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  domestic  assault  and  battery.  His
father called the police after Applicant broke his father’s car windows. Applicant’s father
told the police that Applicant was using marijuana. Applicant was put in a juvenile home
for  approximately  one  month  after  this  incident,  and  the  charges  were  ultimately
dismissed. (GE 3 at 5; GE 4; GE 5; Tr. 60-61, 68-69)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  failure  to  stop  after  a  personal  injury
accident, and failure to have insurance. Applicant struck a motorcycle and fled the scene.
Applicant and his friend were chasing an individual who took marijuana from Applicant’s
friend.  Applicant  pled  guilty  in  2015,  after  he  was  released  from  prison  for  the  crime
alleged in SOR allegation 2.d., and he received six months of probation. Despite his guilty
plea, Applicant claimed he allowed his friend to drive his vehicle, and he was a passenger
in his own vehicle. Applicant accepted responsibility for the accident because his friend
had a suspended license. (GE 1; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 7; GE 6; Tr. 69-77)
In August 2014, Applicant was charged with aggravated assault. Applicant was 17,
and his brother, who was 14, called the 18-year-old victim multiple times until the victim
met  Applicant,  his  brother,  and  two  of  their friends  in  a  parking  lot. Applicant’s  brother
threw the first punch, Applicant then punched the victim in the head, but claims he only
punched  him  once,  and  then  one  of  their  friends  punched  the  victim  once.  The  victim
suffered  a  broken  jaw,  a  broken  nose,  required  stitches,  and  reconstructive  surgery.
Applicant pled not guilty. He was tried as an adult, and a jury convicted him. Applicant
was sentenced to 365 days in jail. He was released two months early for good behavior.
(GE 1 at 27-28; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 4; GE 4; GE 7; Tr. 24, 77-88)
In  September  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  driving  while  his  license  was
suspended, operation of a vehicle without registration plates, and no insurance. He was
sentenced to six months of probation. He had just purchased a vehicle from Craig’s List,
and  he  was  using  a  screwdriver  as  a  key.  At  that  time,  he  had  a  suspended  license;
therefore, he could not obtain registration plates. The incident occurred before he was
sentenced for the incident alleged in SOR allegation 2.d. (GE 8; Tr. 89-92)
In July 2015, Applicant was arrested due to outstanding warrants for driving while
his  license  was  suspended,  no  registration,  failure  to  stop  after  an  accident,  and  no
insurance. The outstanding warrants were related to the September 2014 incident alleged
in SOR allegation 2.c. Applicant failed to resolve these issues in SOR allegation 2.c due
to being incarcerated for ten months. Applicant pled guilty to three of the charges, and in
exchange the other three charges were dropped. He received six months of probation.
(GE 4; GE 9; Tr. 92-93)
In  May  2016,  Applicant  was  pulled  over  and  ticketed  for  no  insurance  and
registration  violation.  He  had  insurance  and  registration,  but  he  did  not  have  the
documentation  with  him  at  the  time  of  the  traffic  stop.  The  charges  were  eventually
dismissed. (GE 10; Tr. 93)
In May 2018, Applicant was ticketed for failure to display a valid license. He did
have a valid license, but not on him when he was pulled over by the police. The charge
was dismissed. (GE 11; Tr. 93-94)
Applicant has not been arrested or ticketed since 2018, and he has no unresolved
criminal issues. (Tr. 58, 89)
Personal Conduct
All of the Guideline J allegations were cross alleged under Guideline E.
At  the  hearing,  Applicant admitted  using  marijuana  from 2012 until  sometime  in
2014,  when  he  went  to  prison  for  the  crime  alleged  in  SOR  allegation  2.d.  He  used
marijuana  approximately  20  times  in  his  life,  and  he  sold  marijuana  for  six  months  to
friends. Applicant did not disclose marijuana involvement in his December 2017 SCA, in
his January 2018 counterintelligence screening interview (CSI), and in his February 2018
subject  interview.  At  the  hearing,  he  admitted  to  lying  about  his  drug  involvement.
Applicant’s failure to self-report his marijuana use was not alleged in the SOR and will not
be considered disqualifying in the determination of his security clearance. (GE 1; GE 2 at
11; GE 3; Tr. 62-67)
Applicant testified that he has turned his life around in the past several years and
no longer associates with individuals who use drugs or are involved in criminal activity.
He now accepts responsibility for his actions and strives to be a positive person. (Tr. 67-
68, 76-77, 97-98)
While working at the airport from 2016 to 2018, Applicant was promoted multiple
times.  He  left  this  job  in  July  2018,  because  he  obtained  his  real  estate  license  and
became a realtor. (Tr. 23-26)
Guideline B:
Applicant’s  father  was  born  in  Iraq.  In  1991,  he  fled  to  the  United  States  as  a
refugee and was subsequently naturalized. Applicant’s father owns property in Iraq, and
he  served  as  a  linguist  for  a  defense  contractor  from  approximately  2007  to  2009.
Applicant’s father’s sister and her family are citizens and residents of Iraq. (GE 1; GE 2;
GE 3 at 2; Tr. 29-31, 37-38)
Applicant does not own property or have financial assets in Iraq. Applicant lives in
his  fiancé’s  home,  but  does  not  own  any  real  estate.  His  assets  total  approximately
$5,000. In his CSI, Applicant told the investigator that he had equal loyalties to the US
and Iraq. At the hearing, Applicant indicated that  he would not want to have to choose
between the two countries, but he would choose the US over Iraq. (GE 2; Tr. 30-32)
Applicant’s aunt is a citizen and resident of Iraq. She lives near the Kuwait border
and sells homemade pickles. She has never been associated with the Iraqi government.
Applicant  communicated  electronically  with  her  and  his  cousins  once  a  week  until
approximately two to three years ago. (GE 3 at 3; Tr. 36-37, 44, 46-48)
Applicant is solely a United States citizen; however, he lived in Iraq with his father
from January 2003 to January 2006. They lived with his father’s sister and her children.
Applicant’s father sent Applicant to Iraq to live with his aunt in January 2008, and he lived
with her for a year. After the arrest listed in SOR allegation 2.a, Applicant’s father sent
him to Iraq to live with his aunt from March 2012 until December 2012. (GE 2; Tr. 21, 33-
37, 39-43, 46)
Applicant visited Iraq for two weeks in October 2017, and stayed with his aunt for
a day. He went to Iraq for a family wedding. Applicant is not aware of his cousins having
any ties to the Iraqi government. (GE 1 at 24; GE 2; Tr. 34, 42-43, 53)
Applicant does not consider himself to be close to his aunt, despite living with her
for  three  significant  periods  during  his  childhood  and  maintaining  weekly  electronic
communications with her and her sons until approximately three years ago. (Tr. 48-49,
51-52)
Iraq
The U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous
and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  assist  U.S.  citizens  is  extremely  limited.  U.S.
citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist
and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi
security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens
and western companies throughout Iraq. (HE I)
Severe  human  rights  problems  are  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility,
widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society
weakened the government’s authority and worsened effective human rights protections.
Problems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities;
arbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to include
press,  social,  religious  and  political  restrictions  in  academic  and  cultural  matters;
discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,  religious,  and  racial
minorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights. (HE I)

"Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about 2017. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which
he  has  held  since  about  2014.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2013.  He  has  never
married, and he has no children. He lives with his girlfriend. (Transcript (Tr.) at 40, 48-

There is no evidence that Applicant used illegal drugs before or after June 2017.
In  June 2017,  he  accepted  an offer from  a friend  to  smoke marijuana and  use  MDMA
(3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine),  a  controlled  substance  commonly  known  as
ecstasy.1  Applicant  decided  that  he  liked  marijuana,  and  he  purchased  about  three
ounces  of  marijuana  from  his  friend.  His  friend  also  gave  him  another  MDMA  pill.
Applicant stated in his October 2018 affidavit that he paid “approximately $300” for the
marijuana.  He  testified  he  paid  “about  $500.”  He  stated  that  the  marijuana  was  for his
personal use.  He  used  marijuana on a few  more occasions  in  June  2017.  Because of
police  intervention,  Applicant  never  had  the  opportunity  to  take  the  MDMA  pill  or  the
remainder of his marijuana. (Tr. at 52-55, 64, 82-84; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1; AE 1, 4)
In  June  2017,  Applicant  and  his  friends  were  driving  to  a  music  festival.  They
were  stopped  by  the  police  a  few  blocks  from  his  apartment.  Applicant  believes  a
confidential  informant  provided  the  information  to  the  police,  because  the  police  knew
who they were, where they were going, and that they had drugs in their possession that
they intended to use at the festival. The police searched the car and seized about five
grams  of marijuana  that  belonged  to  Applicant  and additional  marijuana  that belonged
to  the  other  passengers.  The  police  searched  Applicant’s  apartment  and  seized  the
MDMA pill that Applicant received from his friend and about three ounces of marijuana,
half of which belonged to Applicant’s roommate. (Tr. at 55-60, 84-84; GE 1, 4; AE 1, 4)
Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana with intent to
distribute and possession of a controlled substance. In June 2018, he pleaded guilty to
possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  and  the  other  charge  was  nolle  prosequi
(dismissed).  Imposition  of  sentence  was  suspended  for  one  year  conditioned  upon
Applicant’s good behavior through 12 months of probation. His probation included drug
testing and 100 hours of community service. (Tr. at 59-67, 87; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 1, 4, 5; AE 1, 4)
Applicant’s  employer  had  an  anti-drug  policy  that  prohibited  illegal  drug
possession  and  use.  His  supervisor  testified  that  Applicant  had  access  to  sensitive
information, but he did not have access to classified information. Applicant asserted that
he  applied  for a  security  clearance,  but  he  was  never  informed  that  he  had  a  security
clearance, and he never knew that he had a security clearance. (Tr. at 24-28, 49-52, 78,

However,  in  a  May  2015  Questionnaire  for National Security  Positions  (SF 86),
Applicant wrote that he was investigated for a secret clearance with the date of action of
“04/2014.” He added: “Date of Action is when the investigation was initiated, not when
the  clearance  was  granted.  But  I  do  have  an  active  secret  clearance.”  Additionally,  in
the  resume  he  submitted  to  his  current  employer,  he  wrote  that  he  had  a  “Secret
Clearance with DOD Suitability.”2 (GE 2, 6)
Applicant  completed  all  the  terms  of  his  probation,  including  counseling.  His
therapist  did  “not  see  him  as  a  risk  for  future  court  involvement.”  The  charge  was
dismissed,  and  he  was  released  from  probation  in  June  2019.  He  stated  that  he  is
remorseful for his actions,  and he  has  learned  a  valuable  lesson. He  asserted  that  he
does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  or  any  other  illegal  drug  in  the  future.  He  met  his
girlfriend after his drug involvement. She works for the U.S. Government and is strongly
opposed to illegal drug use. He is active in his church and volunteers in his community.

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a (a cross-allegation of SOR ¶ 1.b), all
with  explanations  and  a  narrative  statement.  Her  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  44  years  old.  She  and  her  husband  married  in  2004.  They  have  a
young  son.  Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  accounting  in  1999  and  another
bachelor’s degree in management information systems in 2001. She has worked in the
defense industry, with a security clearance, since September 2002. (Answer; GE 1; Tr. 9,
31-38, 62-64)
Applicant has worked in business management or accounting for her entire career.
She worked as a business manager for her first defense employer from 2002 to 2009.
(Answer;  Ans.  Ex.  B;  GE  1)  She  was  then  employed  as  an  accounting  manager  by
defense  contractor  X  from  2009  until  September  2014,  when  she  was  terminated  for
cause. (SOR ¶ 1.a, discussed below). She was then briefly unemployed. Since December
2014,  she  has  been  employed  as  an  accountant  and  financial  auditor  for  a  defense
contractor working with a defense agency. (Answer; Ans. Ex. A & B; GE 1; Tr. 33-34, 45-
47)
As the accounting manager for Company X, Applicant managed payroll, invoicing,
and expenses. She managed five employees directly. They included an employee who
handled invoices; an employee who handled corporate expenses; a payroll accountant;
an employee who handled expenses for contract employees; and Applicant’s personal
assistant. Company X had about 400 employees nationwide. Only a few of them worked
at the headquarters location, among them the company owners, as well as Applicant and
a few others. (Tr. 39, 64-70)
Among  Applicant’s  duties  as  the  accounting  manager  was  the  responsibility  to
oversee  an  annual  audit  of  the  company’s  financial  bookkeeping.  She  testified  that  in
2013, the company began using a new accounting system. Applicant said the accounting
system  had  problems,  and  she  wanted  to  fix  those  problems  before  having  the  audit
completed  by  the  2014  due  date.  The  company  president,  Mr.  W,  wanted  the  audit
completed so the company could apply for a loan, and pressured Applicant to complete
it more promptly. (Answer; Tr. 39-42, 90-96)
Applicant told Mr. W that she needed more time to complete the project, and the
audit  was  not  completed.  In  September  2014,  Mr.  W  lost  patience  with  Applicant  and
terminated her for failure to complete the audit. (Tr. 41-42, 89-92, 100-104; GE 2 at 14-
15, GE 4 at 7-9; GE 8) (SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant applied for unemployment compensation,
but did not receive it. (Tr. 43-45; GE 9)
Company X had a corporate credit card program. Applicant testified that about 100
company credit cards were for travelling employees. About 10 company credit cards were
for employees at corporate headquarters to purchase items such as office and kitchen
supplies. (Tr. 67-68) Applicant had oversight of the corporate credit card program in her
role as the accounting manager. (GE 11 at 28, 55-56) Applicant had a corporate credit
card, as did several of the people she supervised. (GE 11)
Applicant testified that administration of the expense reports for the travel cards
worked well but “the corporate side was very informal, very laid back, didn’t really have a
formality with them. And we were not required to give expense reports on the corporate
side.” (Tr. 68)
Employee J, who worked directly for Applicant, was  responsible for directly monitoring
the company credit card program. Employee J maintained the credit card files and made
sure the credit card bills were paid. The credit card invoices were mailed in to Employee
J for payment by the company. Applicant described herself as a “very laid-back manager,”
because  she  felt  she  could  trust  her  employees.  She  did  not  make  inquiries  about
employees’ corporate credit card purchases. (Tr. 70-72, 74-89, 96, 117, 118)
During  2013  and  2014,  Applicant  used  her  company  credit  card  for  personal
expenses on numerous occasions. Charges on her card included medical expenses and
gas, as well as appropriate items such as supplies and food for the office. (Tr. 67, 78-81)
She acknowledged that there was no system in place to differentiate between personal
charges and proper corporate charges on the credit card. She acknowledged that, as the
accounting manager, she was responsible for that failing. (Tr. 113-115, 118, 123) She did
not reimburse her employer for any of her personal charges. Applicant acknowledged that
she never went to Employee J to see the monthly invoices for Applicant’s corporate credit
card account, so she could review them for personal charges. (Tr. 115) Applicant denied
that she was having financial difficulties at the time. (Tr. 110, 128)
Applicant, an at-will employee, received the Company X employee handbook when
she began the job. (Tr. 118; GE 10) The handbook noted that “All charges to [the company
credit  card]  must  be  for  travel  unless  otherwise  authorized.”  It  further  noted  that  “Any
abuse  of  the  company  credit  card  will  be  grounds  for  immediate  revocation  of  the
privilege, and for discipline, up to and including termination.” (GE 10 at 49)
The company audit was completed after Applicant’s termination. It revealed that
Applicant  and  three  employees  she  supervised  were  using  company  credit  cards  for
personal expenses. (GE 4) Those employees were also terminated. (GE 11 at 28)
This led to a state criminal investigation. (GE 11) Mr. W, the company president,
told  investigators  that  the  company’s  internal  audit  revealed  over  $224,000  in
unauthorized  personal  expenses  on  company  credit  cards,  by  Applicant  and  the  three
other employees, during 2013 and 2014.  Of those charges,  $29,845 were found to be
personal charges on Applicant’s corporate credit card. (AE 11 at 21, 37, 38; Tr. 81)
Applicant testified at her hearing that Mr. W “gave multiple people the authority to
use their corporate credit cards for personal expenses.” (Tr. 120) However, Mr. W denied
to the criminal investigators that he had given employees such authorization. Mr. W told
criminal investigators that “there was no one allowed to use [a] credit card to purchase
personal items.” (GE 11 at 28)
Mr. W also told criminal investigators that in 2008 or 2009, Applicant charged two
tanks  of  gas  on  a  company  credit  card.  He  said  he  made  her  repay  the  charges  and
counselled her not to do it again. (GE 11 at 27) Applicant did not start working for company
X until 2009, but she otherwise confirmed the essence of the conversation. (Tr. 120-121)
Information provided by Company X to state criminal investigators included an e-
mail Company X sent to its insurance company in March 2015 concerning an insurance
claim related to the credit card theft. (GE 11 at 53-56) The e-mail notes that Company X’s
established  procedures  required  expense  reports  to  be  completed  for  all  expenses
incurred  on  company  credit  cards.  Applicant  and  another  employee  had  approval
authority on the expense reports. (GE 11 at 53) Only the company president, Mr. W, had
check-signing authority. However, Employee J paid the credit card invoices online and
not by check. Applicant, as the accounting manager, had the responsibility to review and
approve credit card expenses and to reconcile the accounts monthly. The company chief
financial officer determined that no such reconciliation took place. (GE 11 at 54-55)
In October 2015, Applicant was indicted on state charges of: 1) theft of $29,845 of
company property and 2) illegal use of a credit or debit card. (GE 2 at 29-30; GE 11 at 1-
3) A warrant was then issued for her arrest. Applicant learned of the warrant in June 2016,
when it came up on a background check performed when she attempted to purchase a
firearm as a gift for her husband. She turned herself in to authorities and was arrested.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.a)(Answer; Ans. Ex. D; GE 2 at 29; Tr. 48-52, 81-84, 104-105) The other
three employees were also charged. (GE 11)
Applicant informed her current employer about the charges. This led to an incident
report in the Defense Department’s Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), to her
2017 SCA, and thus, to the pending hearing. (GE 3; GE 7; Tr. 124-125)
The  district  attorney  offered  Applicant  an  opportunity  to  participate  in  a  pretrial
intervention  program.  The  charges  were  dismissed  in  December  2016.  Applicant
participated in counseling two hours a week for five or six weeks. She and the other three
defendants had to pay a combined $25,000 in restitution. Applicant paid over $9,000 in
restitution,  as  well  as  court  costs.  She  completed  the  pretrial  intervention  program
successfully in November 2018. (Answer; Ans. Ex. E – I; GE 3 at 2, GE 5, GE 6; AN I; AE
A-G; Tr. 52-57, 108-110, 125-126)
During  her  testimony,  Applicant  denied  that  she  failed  to  complete  the  audit
because she knew that it would bring to light her own credit card misuse. She said she
was not trying to hide anything about her conduct by failing to complete the audit, and
was not worried that anything would be discovered. (Tr. 102-103, 111-113)
Applicant testified that she will never do anything like this again. It has been the
most stressful event of her life. She did not intend to hurt anyone. She is a team player.
She  acted  out  of  character.  She  would  not  put  her  family  through  this  again.  She
apologized  for  her  actions  and  asserted  that  she  is  trustworthy.  She  recognized  her
failings as a financial manager. (Tr. 58-60, 127-128)
In her current job, Applicant works as an accountant and financial auditor. (Answer;
Ans. Ex. C) In 2017, she had an annual salary of just under $100,000. (AE H) She does
not hold a corporate credit card currently, but said she is not barred from having one. (Tr.
123-124)
In  2017,  Applicant  was  regarded  by  her  employer  as  a  trusted  partner  to  the
government  and  a  welcome  and  contributing  member  of  the  accounting  team.  She
performs  at  a  very  high  level.  (AE  I)  She  has  been  honored  with  awards  for  her

reflects that she easily meets client expectations and that her leadership and experience
is valued and highly appreciated. She is highly prepared and leads by example. (AE N)
Applicant is active in her local school and church community. (Answer; Ans. Ex. J – M)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  documentation  that  she  recently  took  an
ethics  refresher  course  for  accountants  as  well  as  documentation  of  numerous  other
professional training or refresher courses. (Tr. 142-143; Ans. Ex. N; AE O, AE P, AE R)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.n,
2.a, and 3.a-3.c. He denied the allegation of falsifying his SCA in SOR ¶ 2.b. Although he
stated that he admitted SOR ¶ 2.c, also alleging that he falsified his SCA, he stated that
he  was  confused  by  the  terminology  of  the  question  in  his  SCA.  I  have  treated  his
response to SOR ¶ 2.c as a denial. At the hearing, he admitted the additional allegation
in SOR ¶ 3.d. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my
findings of fact.

.
Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a:  In  May  2000,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  disorderly
conduct  and  resisting  arrest.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  disorderly  conduct,  was  ordered  to
perform two days of community service, and was given a conditional discharge. (GX 3.)
He testified that the incident occurred when the police shut down a nightclub shortly after
he paid the entrance fee. He was demanding a refund of the entrance fee when a police
officer pushed him and told him to go outside.  Applicant testified that the police officer
was verbally abusive and made derogatory comments. Applicant testified that he “nudged
[the officer] not really purposely,” and had an angry verbal exchange with him, resulting
in his arrest. (Tr. 30-31.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: In July 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with grand larceny,
reckless  endangerment  (2nd  degree),  and  unauthorized  use  of  a  vehicle  without  the
owner’s consent. He  pleaded guilty to unauthorized use of a vehicle.  (GX 6 at 6.) At the
hearing, he testified that incident occurred after he was invited by some friends to go for
a “joy ride” in a stolen vehicle, and he drove the vehicle a short distance until they were
stopped by the police. He also testified that he received a ticket in the mail for driving the
stolen car with a broken headlight and that he did not pay it, resulting in suspension of his
driver’s license and  his arrest  in  December 2002, discussed below. (Tr. 31-32.) In October
2001,  shortly  after  this  incident,  Applicant  enlisted  in  the  Navy.  He  testified  that  his
enlistment  removed  him  from  bad  company,  made  him  feel  proud,  and  gave  him  a
healthier perspective on life and a more positive social circle. (Tr. 33-34.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: In December 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating
a  motor  vehicle  (the  stolen  vehicle  involved  in  SOR  ¶  1.b)  without  a  license  and
aggravated  unlicensed  operation  of  a  motor  vehicle  (3rd  degree).  He  pleaded  guilty  to
operating a motor vehicle without a license and was fined $50. (GX 3.) His license was
suspended for failure to pay the fine. (Tr. 32.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he
was unaware that his   driver’s license had   been suspended   because he was no longer
living in the state that had issued the license.
SOR ¶ 1.d: In December 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating
a vehicle on a suspended license. He admitted it in his answer to the SOR, but it is not
reflected in any of the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing. At the hearing,
Applicant testified that he was not sure about the disposition of this offense, because it
happened so long ago. (Tr. 57-58.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: In April 2004, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence
of  alcohol  (DUI)  and  driving  with  a  suspended  or  revoked  license.  He  was  alone  and
returning from a party at a bar. He was stopped for speeding and failed a breathalyzer
test.  (Tr.  34-35.)  He  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI  and  was  sentenced  to  confinement  for  one
year, with nine months suspended, suspension of his driver’s license for one year, and a
$900 fine. (GX 2 at 6-7.) He testified that his three months in jail was embarrassing and
caused him to miss the birth of his son. (Tr. 36.) He testified that he voluntarily completed
an alcohol-education program offered by the VA. He was not diagnosed with an alcohol-
abuse disorder on that occasion or any time thereafter. (Tr. 37.)
SOR  1.f:  In  November  2004,  Applicant  was  arrested  on  a  capias  warrant  and
charged with a probation violation related to his DUI conviction in April 2004. In his answer
to the SOR, he admitted this allegation and stated that his military obligations “restrained
[him]  from  taking necessary steps  to resolve past issues.”   This arrest is not reflected in
any of the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing. At the hearing, he was not
sure of the reason for this charge, but he believed that it arose because the court would
not accept the VA education program as compliance with a court-ordered requirement for
completing an alcohol-education program after his DUI conviction in April 2004. (Tr. 37-
38.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: In September 2007, Applicant was charged with assault and battery
on a family member and threatening bodily harm. He was convicted of assault and battery,
fined $200, and required to make restitution. (GX 4; GX 6 at 7.) At the hearing, he testified
that he was trying to leave his home, but his wife blocked the door to prevent him from
leaving. He testified that he picked up his wife and threw her onto a sofa so that he could
leave. His wife accused him of choking her and inflicting bruises, but he denied it. (Tr. 20,
39-40.)
SOR ¶ 1.h: In March 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while
intoxicated (DWI) (2nd  offense) and refusal of a blood or breath test (2nd  offense). (GX 5
at 3-6; GX 6 at 8.) At the hearing, he testified he had consumed only one beer. He denied
refusing a breath test, but he testified that he pleaded guilty to both offenses on the advice
of his lawyer. For the DWI, he was sentenced to confinement for 90 days, with 60 days
suspended; suspension of his operator’s license for  three years, and  a $500 fine. For the
refusal of a blood or breath test, he was sentenced to confinement for 30 days, with 10
days suspended, suspension of his operator’s license for  an additional three years, and
a $250 fine. He used public transportation to go to work, but he admitted that he continued
to drive on short trips to school and the grocery store about three times a week while his
license was suspended. (Tr. 41-44.)
SOR ¶ 1.i: In February 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating
a vehicle on a suspended or revoked license. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to
confinement for 365 days, suspended, probation for one year, and a $250 fine. (GX 5 at
7.) He did not testify about the circumstances of this arrest and conviction.
SOR  ¶  1.j:  In  May  2012,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  assault  and
battery. In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he stated that he was charged due
to false accusations by an ex-girlfriend. (Tr. 44-45.) The charges were dismissed. (GX 6
at 8.)
SOR ¶ 1.k: In December 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating
a vehicle with a suspended or revoked license, operating a vehicle with altered, forged,
or fictitious license plates, and an illegal inspection sticker. He testified that he obtained
the  license  plates  and  inspection  sticker  from  a  friend  because  he  was  “destitute  and
desperate” and needed to drive to attend school and look for work. (Tr. 45-46.) He was
convicted of all offenses. For operating a vehicle with a suspended or revoked license,
he was sentenced to confinement for 90 days, with 80 days suspended, probation for 24
months,  and  suspension  of  his  operator’s  license  for  two  years.  For  the  license  plate
violation, he was sentenced to confinement for 60 days, with 40 days suspended. For the
inspection sticker violation, he was sentenced to confinement for 30 days, suspended,
and probation for 24 months. (GX 5 at 11-17.)
SOR ¶ 1.l:  In  April 2014,  Applicant  was  arrested and  charged with contempt  of
court for failing to appear at a child-support hearing. He was found not guilty. (GX 6 at 8.)
In his answer to the SOR, he stated that neither he nor his lawyer knew the court date
and that the judge apologized and dismissed the charge.
SOR ¶ 1.m: During his background investigation, Applicant was interviewed by a
security  investigator  in  October  2018.  During  that  interview,  he  admitted  that  he  was
arrested in 2015 and charged with driving a vehicle with a suspended driver’s license, an
expired vehicle registration, and an expired safety inspection stocker. He pleaded guilty
and was sentenced to confinement for ten days, with five days suspended, and a $600
fine. He served his five days of confinement on weekends. (GX 2 at 6.) Other than the
summary of Applicant’s interview, there is no documentary evidence of this incident in the
record, and he did not testify about it at the hearing.
SOR ¶ 1.n: In December 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with making
a false statement on a criminal history form (a felony) and making a false statement to
obtain a firearm. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of falsely identifying himself to a
law enforcement officer. He was sentenced to confinement for 12 months (suspended)
and  probation  for  12  months.  (GX  6  at  9.)  He  stated  that  he  was  confused  by  the
terminology of the question in the form asking about domestic violence. At the hearing,
he testified that he knew that he had been convicted of assault and battery on his then
wife, but he was not specifically charged with domestic violence, and he did not know that
his  offense  was  considered  domestic  violence  until  he  was  charged  with  falsifying  his
application for a firearm purchase. (Tr. 47-51, 61.)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a: Cross-alleges the conduct in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.n.
SOR ¶ 2.b: The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing
to disclose the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i through 1.m. When he submitted his SCA,
he answered “Yes” in response to questions in Section 22 of his SCA, asking if in the past
seven years he had been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in a criminal
proceeding;  been  arrested  by  any  law  enforcement  official;  or  had  been  charged,
convicted, or sentenced in any court. He disclosed the criminal conduct alleged in SOR ¶
1.n, but he did not disclose the criminal conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i through 1.m. (GX
1  at  24-25.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  he  did  not  intentionally  falsify
information, but that his “rollercoaster of events” in his past made recollection of specific
events  unclear.  At  the  hearing,  he  did  not  testify  and  was  not  questioned  about  this
allegation.
SOR ¶ 2.c: The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing
to disclose the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.j, and 1.n. He answered “No” to questions
in his SCA asking  whether he had ever been charged with a felony or had even been
convicted  of  an  offense  involving  domestic  violence.  He  did  not  disclose  the  criminal
conduct  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.j,  both  alleging  assault  and  battery  on  a  family
member. He did not disclose the felony charge alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n, but he disclosed his
conviction of a misdemeanor as a lesser-included offense of the felony. (GX 1 at 26.) In
his answer to the SOR, he admitted that he was charged with a felony for falsifying his
firearms application but convicted of a misdemeanor. At the hearing, he testified that he
answered “No”  to  the question about  domestic violence  because  he did not  know that
assault on a family member was considered domestic violence. However, he admitted at
the hearing that he learned in December 2015, well before he submitted his SCA, that
assault and battery on a family member was considered domestic violence, which was
why he was charged with falsifying his application to purchase a firearm. (Tr. 60-62.)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  ¶¶  3.a-3.c  alleges  three  medical  debts  placed  for  collection  of  $380,
$178,  and  $704.  The  debts  are  reflected  in  the  credit  report  from  November  2017  as
referred for collection and reflected in the credit report from January 2020 as unpaid (GX
8; GX 9.) Applicant admitted these allegations, but he stated in his answer to the SOR
and  at  the  hearing  that  he  received  care  for  a  medical  emergency  and  believed  the
medical care was covered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He provided no
details  about  the  nature  of  the  medical  emergency.  He  testified  that  his  VA  medical
benefits  were  not  active  when  he  received  the  treatment  because  he  did  not  have  a
primary  care doctor.  He  testified that  he  contacted the VA,  and that  the  VA told him  it
would handle the debts. Finally, he testified that he was offered a settlement of the $704
debt, alleged in SOR ¶ 3.c, which he accepted and paid, but he admitted that the other
debts  were  not  resolved.  (Tr.  24-25.).  After  the  hearing,  he  submitted  documentary
evidence that the $704 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 3.c was settled. (AX A.) He did not submit
any documentary evidence showing efforts to pay the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.a and
3.b, which remain unresolved.
SOR ¶ 3.d alleges a child-support arrearage of about $23,000. The arrearage is
not reflected in the two credit reports submitted by Department Counsel. (GX 8 and 9.)
Applicant disclosed the arrearage in his SCA and admitted it at the hearing. (GX 1 at 32;
Tr. 26-27.) He has $700 per month deducted from his pay, but the deduction is for his
monthly  payments  and  not  the  arrearage.  The  record  does  not  reflect  whether  the
deduction is court-ordered or was voluntarily initiated by Applicant. He has taken no action
to resolve the arrearage.
Character Evidence
Applicant’s program director states that he has demonstrated that he is a “highly
reliable, self-motivated, and trusted employee” since he was hired in October 2018. He
considers  Applicant  to  be  dependable,  responsible,  honest,  and  courteous.  (AX  E.)
Applicant’s  production  manager  for  the  last  six  months  states  that  his  hard  work  “has
distinguished him as a cut above others and his trustworthiness cannot be understated.”
He  describes  Applicant  as  personable,  with  a  cheery  and  hardworking  attitude,  and  a
trustworthy  teammate  who  keeps  spirits  up  among  his  comrades.  (AX  C.)  Applicant’s
previous production manager from June 2013 to October 2018 states that he displayed
the “utmost level of professionalism” with the potential to become a leader in his field. (AX
D.)
A  placement  specialist  at  a  community  organization  providing  workforce
development for disadvantaged and low-income workers in the construction industry, who
has known Applicant for about five years, regards him as a “changed person with good
moral character,” who is “respectful, committed, trustworthy, ambitious, and a man of the
highest  integrity.”  She  invited  Applicant  to  be  a  guest  speaker  about  leadership  and
supervisory roles for electricians. She described how Applicant was open about his past
criminal record, and he encouraged his audience to have the courage to change and to
not allow past mistakes to define them. She stated that, a month later, the students were
still inspired by Applicant’s remarks. (AX B.)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e,  2.a,  3.a,  3.b,  and  3.d-3.g,  although  he  said
that SOR ¶¶ 3.e and 3.f were the same offense. He denied SOR ¶ 3.c. His admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  never
married. He has an adult son who lives in another state, an 18-year-old daughter, a 15-
year-old  daughter,  and  a  14-year-old  daughter.  His  three  daughters  live  with  their
mothers. Two of them live in other states. Applicant lives with his girlfriend and her 10-
year-old  son.  (GE  1;  Tr.  25)  Applicant  earned  a  certification  in  1997,  an  associate’s
degree in 2012, and a bachelor’s degree in 2015. (GE 1) He testified that he also has a
master’s degree. (Tr. 25, 58)
Applicant  was  employed  by  an  electronics  company  from  December  2005  to
January  2008.  He  left  the  job  to  take  a  position  in  another  state,  but  the  job  did  not
materialize.  He  was  then  unemployed  for  most  of  the  next  four  and  a  half  years.  He
spent much of this time improving his education. (GE 1; Tr. 67-69) He was employed at
a  computer  company  from  May  to  September  2013,  but  was  terminated  after  a
confrontation  with  a  coworker.  (GE  1;  Tr.  68-70  He  was  then  unemployed  again  until
May 2014, when he briefly took a job caring for seniors. He left the position because he
did not believe the employer was following regulations appropriately. (GE 1; Tr. 71-72)
Since  2017,  Applicant  has  worked  in  information  technology  for  his  current
employer and clearance sponsor. (GE 1, Tr. 72-76) On occasion, he was unemployed
between contracts. (GE 1; Tr. 61-65) He has never held a clearance. (Tr. 13) Applicant
testified that in 2019, he earned between $35,000 and $40,000. He works full time. (Tr.
65-67, 90-93)
In April 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony injury to a child. He
was  convicted  and  served  five  years  in  jail.  (SOR  ¶  3.g)(GE  1  at  43-44)  Applicant
testified that the injuries to the child included bruises and a burn mark. (Tr. 34-35)
In  September  2001,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  third-degree
larceny. (SOR ¶ 3.f) He explained that he was arrested after he attempted to steal some
items of clothing from a department store. He received a period of probation, but failed
to pay the related fine. In March 2003, he was in an auto accident. In the aftermath, he
gave a false name to the police. He was arrested for making a false report and for the
larceny  charge,  due  to  the  unpaid  fine.  He  said  that  his  probation  was  extended  as  a
result. (GE 1 at 44-45; GE 5 at 11; Tr. 26-28, 35-37) (SOR ¶ 3.e)
In 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol (DUI) and driving with a suspended license. He was convicted and sentenced to
one  day  in  jail,  12  months  of  probation,  fined,  ordered  to  perform  community  service,
and attend DUI education. (SOR ¶ 3.d) (GE 1 at 45-46; GE 5 at 8-9)
In  January  2012,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  felony  child  abuse.
(SOR ¶ 3.c) (GE 5 at 12; GE 1 at 38) He denied SOR ¶ 3.c. Applicant testified that the
girlfriend  of  his  daughter’s  maternal  grandfather  filed  a  child-abuse  complaint  against
Applicant.  The  complainant,  he  asserted,  was  herself  wanted  for  murder  at  the  time.
Applicant  was  arrested,  as  was  his  daughter’s  mother.  Applicant  denied  that  he
committed the offense. (Tr. 28-31, 37) He participated in parenting classes. (Tr. 34, 81-
83)  He  reported  the  arrest  on  his  SCA  and  noted  that  the  charge  was  dismissed  in
September  2014.  (GE  1  at  38-39)  The  arrest  is  documented  in  Applicant’s  criminal
record, but disposition of the charge is not. (GE 5)
In about June 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication
and  resisting  arrest,  and  cited  for  speeding  and  improper  lane  usage.  (SOR  ¶  3.b)  In
October 2013, he pleaded guilty to speeding and public intoxication and was fined. The
resisting  arrest  charge  and  the  citation  for  improper  lane  usage  were  dismissed.
Applicant testified that he was on his way home and a police car going in the opposite
direction  turned  and  followed  him.  He  pulled  into  his  apartment  complex.  When  the
police asked him to exit the vehicle, he tripped over a curb and fell down because the
parking lot was not well lit. (Tr. 37-38) (Answer to SOR; GE 1 at 39-40; Tr. 31-32) The
charges are not detailed on the exhibit documenting Applicant’s criminal record. (GE 5)
In December 2014, Applicant was charged with DUI and also cited for speeding
and improper lane usage. (SOR ¶ 3.a) Applicant admitted the fact that he was charged
but denied the conduct. He testified that he was pulled over because the police officer
observed him swerving between the lanes and smelled liquor on him during the traffic
stop.  Applicant  denied  that  he  consumed  alcohol  that  night.  He  said  had  just  left  the
house,  and  was  “sleepy”  but  not  drunk.  (Tr.  83-85)  In  October  2016,  the  DUI  charge
was nolle prossed after Applicant attended a nine-month DUI class through a diversion
program. (GE 5 at 12; GE 1 at 41-42; Tr. 31-32, 39-40, 76-80, 94) He has not had any
subsequent arrests. (Tr. 40)
Applicant  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  weekly,  at  times  daily,
between  May  2003  and  July  2016.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  His  most  recent  use  was  after  the
sudden  death  of  a  close  friend.  He  said  this  was  shortly  before  he  participated  in  the
DUI  diversion  program.  The  timing  of  his  last  marijuana  use  is  unclear.  Applicant  said
he  had  not  used  marijuana  since  July  2016.  (Tr.  43,  44)  He  later  said  this  was  some
time in 2017. (Tr. 44, 46-47) He denied using marijuana after submitting his May 2017
SCA. (Tr. 46) He acknowledged knowing that marijuana use is against state and federal
law.  He  has  attended  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  a  few  times  in  the  last  three  years.
(Tr. 40-47, 94-98)
Applicant’s background investigation also included credit reports from July 2017,
May 2018, and March 2019. Applicant had five delinquent accounts, the largest by far
being  SOR  ¶  1.a,  concerning  a  $121,692  child  support  arrearage.  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a
charged-off student loan account for $8,293. SOR ¶ 1.c is another charged-off account
for  $1,755.  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  ($250)  and  1.e  ($76)  are  two  past-due  medical  accounts.
Applicant disclosed his debts on his SCA. (GE 1)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.a,  Applicant  testified  that  he  fell  behind  on  his  child-support
payments  during  his  periods  of  unemployment.  This  began  with  a  layoff  in  2009.  He
also acknowledged working odd jobs, but said that none of that income went to arrears
or child support. (Tr. 85-90) Applicant testified that his child support went into arrears in
about 2012. (Tr. 100)
Applicant testified that he is currently paying on his child support and has money
taken out of his paycheck regularly. He said the arrearage amount was incurred during
his  various  periods  of  unemployment.  The  child  support  concerns  his  two  younger
children,  one  of  whom  lives  in  his  home  state  and  one  of  whom  is  in  another  state.
Applicant  said  he  is  paying  between  $500  and  $600  in  child  support  monthly  for  one
child,  and  about  $425  for  another  child.  Applicant  does  not  believe  that  his  monthly
payments  address  the  amount  in  arrears.  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  of
the current status of his child-support payments. (Tr. 47-54, 99-104)
Applicant asserted that his student loan (SOR ¶ 1.b) is in deferment. He said he
has  other  student  loans,  which  are  also  deferred.  (Tr.  54-55,  58-61)  Applicant  did  not
provide documentation of the current status of his past-due student loan. The past-due
debt at SOR ¶ 1.c is also unresolved. (Tr. 105)
Applicant asserted that the two medical debts alleged (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e) are
co-payments from medical procedures. He believes they should have been covered by
insurance. (Tr. 55-56) They remain unresolved.
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  has  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard  indicates  that  security
",True
"Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  cybersecurity  engineer  who  has  been  in  his  present
positon  for  nearly  two  years.  He  is  considered  an  excellent  employee  and  has
maintained  a  security  clearance  without  adverse  incident  since  2006.  He  appreciates
the  responsibilities  of  one  maintaining  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  26)  Applicant  has
earned a master’s degree in information systems.
Married, Applicant is the father of a toddler and is expecting a second child. He is
the  main  wage-earner  with  an  income  of  about  $120,000  a  year.  His  wife,  who  also
maintains  a  security  clearance,  works  at  home  as  a  business  analyst  generating
approximately $100,000 a year in salary.
The couple own their  home, in which no alcohol is present. Applicant has been
abstinent  since  March  2018,  consuming  his  last  alcoholic  beverages  at  a  party  for  his
child.  (Tr.  22).  This  led  to  his  most  recent  alcohol-related  incident,  discussed  below.
Prior  to  that,  he  had  not  had  alcohol  for  over  three  years.  (Tr.  25,  62)  He  has  never
been  diagnosed  as  an  alcoholic  or  alcohol-dependent.  (Tr.  27)  He  has  had  extensive
counseling and does not believe he has a problem with, or need for, alcohol. (Tr. 27)
Applicant’s  alcohol-related  issues  and  legal  issues  date  back  to  at  least  2010.
One night in about September 2010, Applicant was spotted by a police officer swerving
his car. (Tr. 46)  At the time he was heading back to his hotel after attending an event
where he had consumed alcohol. (Tr. 43) He passed the field sobriety test and he had a
.06  or  a  .07  result  on  a  breathalyzer  reading,  under  the  legal  threshold  of  .08  for
intoxication. (Tr. 28-29; 41) However. Applicant was arrested and charged with driving
under the influence (DUI). Being handcuffed and driven to the station was “devastating
and  it  shook  [him].”  (Tr.  46-47)  His  lawyer  appeared  in  court  and  the  matter  was
dropped. He no longer has much faith in field sobriety tests or breathalyzers. (Tr. 29)
In  January  2012,  Applicant  was  arraigned  for  DUI  (first  offense).  Applicant  had
been stopped for a broken headlight after drinking at an earlier social event. (Tr. 49) He
does  not  remember  how  much  time  had  passed  between  his  imbibing  and  his  being
pulled  over,  nor  does  he  recall  how  much  alcohol  he  had  consumed.  (Tr.  49-50)  He
does not remember the result of a urine test and does not recall whether a breathalyzer
was  administered  at  the  time  of  arrest.  (Tr.  30,  52)  His  attorney  negotiated  a  plea
agreement. (Tr. 53) In February 2012, a deferred sentencing agreement was filed and
Applicant  was  enrolled  in  a  diversion  program.  (Ex.  6)  Ultimately,  the  charges  were
dismissed  as  part  of  the  plea  agreement  after  successful  conclusion  of  the  diversion
program (nolle diversion) in February 2013. (Ex. 6; Tr. 53)
In  about  April  2014,  Applicant  had  been  out  with  friends  and  had  a  “couple”  of
alcoholic beverages. (Tr. 57) On the way home, his vehicle was rear-ended by another
car.  The  other  driver  appeared  to  be  injured  and  he  called  the  police.  After  officers
arrived, he was asked to submit to a breathalyzer and a field sobriety test, both of which
he refused because he “wasn’t confident to perform the test . . . .[he] did not think [he]
was  under  the  influence.”  (Tr. 31)  He  did so because in  the  past,  he had  been told to
refuse  such  tests  unless  a  lawyer  was  present.  (Tr.  34)  He  was  arrested  and
handcuffed, leaving him to feel “awful, not good.” (Tr. 59)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI.  He  admitted  to  the  DUI  charge
and  was  convicted  of  that  crime.  (Tr.  56)  He  entered  a  diversion  program,  which  he
successfully  completed.  A  counselor  gave  him  a  good  prognosis.  (Tr.  59)  He  was
advised  not  to  drink  and  drive  in  the  future.  After  three  alcohol-related  incidents,
Applicant  began to  feel  he was  “running out  of  luck” and,  given his  job, marriage,  and
baby,  he  realized  he  had  too  much  to  lose  if  his  pattern  continued.  (Tr.  63)  He
understood  “bad things happen  when I  consume  alcohol.”  (Tr. 63)  At  some  point  after
the 2014 incident, he decided to permanently quit using alcohol. (Tr. 61) He maintained
that commitment for “over three years.” (Tr. 62)
Despite his decision to give up alcohol, Applicant again imbibed in March 2018.
After drinking alcohol at a party for his child at home, Applicant and some friends went
to  a  bar.  (Tr.  65)  While  driving  himself  home  around  3:30  a.m.,  he  was  detained  at  a
traffic  stop  by  police.  (Ex.  12;  see  also  Tr.  70,  indicating  the  stop  was  at  about  1:00
a.m.) His attorney argued that reckless driving was a more appropriate charge. (Tr. 34,
71;  Ex.  12).  Applicant  attended  several  alcohol  counseling  sessions  and  courses.  He
was  ultimately  convicted  of  reckless  driving  and  breathalyzer  refusal,  and  his  driver’s
license was suspended for three years.  It remains suspended.
As a consequence of the 2018 incident, Applicant was asked to resign from his
employer  for  violation  of  a  new  drug  and  alcohol  policy.  (Tr.  55)  Applicant  and
management  discussed  the  issue.  Applicant  knew  that  even  the  reckless  driving
conviction could lead to his termination. (Tr. 76) It was ultimately agreed that Applicant
could simply resign from his position and keep his record “clean.” (Tr. 40)
Today,  Applicant  maintains  that  he  has  never  driven  a  vehicle  under  the
influence of alcohol nor ever blown an alcohol level above the legal limit for intoxication
and DUI. (Tr. 30) He has signed a letter of intent not to return to drinking. (Tr. 35-36, 38;
Ex. E) He believes he is no longer at risk for driving after drinking because he does not
drink. (Tr. 36) After being assessed by a counselor, he was not found to be in need of
treatment. (Ex. F) It was noted that he was on a “positive trajectory.” (Tr. 38)

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, all with explanations. He denied SOR ¶ 2.a,
but  only  as  to  the  date  of  the  arrest.  His  admissions  and  statements  are  incorporated
into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old. He and his wife have been married for about three and
a half years. They have two young children. Applicant earned his bachelor’s degree in
2004,  his  master’s  degree  in  2007,  and  his  Ph.D.  in  2013.  He  then  spent  about  two
years  in  a  post-doctorate  fellowship  in  Europe,  until  December  2015.  He  was
unemployed for most of 2016, until beginning his current job with a defense contractor
in the United States, in October 2016. He has a $135,000 annual salary. (Tr. 29-33, 44-
46; GE 1; GE 2)
During his years in school, Applicant was in a band. During the summer of 2007,
the  band  was  on  tour  in  a  large  U.S.  city  several  hundred  miles  from  his  home.  One
night,  before  a  performance,  Applicant  was  sitting  in  the  back  of  the  band’s  van,
reading. Two others got into the front seats and began to smoke marijuana.  This drew
the attention of a nearby police officer, and all of the occupants of the van were pulled
out and arrested. (Tr. 34-35, 56-58; GE 2 at 5)
Applicant spent about 20 hours in jail and was arraigned in court the next day on
a charge of possession of marijuana. He said he was advised by legal counsel to plead
no contest so he would not have to return to court, in a city far from his home, to dispute
the charge. He was placed on unsupervised probation for a year, after which the charge
would  be  dismissed.  (Tr.  33-37;  Answer;  GE  2)  Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  use
marijuana during his period of probation. (Tr. 79)
Applicant reported the arrest on his SCA, giving an estimated date of July 2007
(as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a). (GE 1 at 68) In his Answer and at hearing, he gave the date
as June 2007. (Tr. 34) He has had no subsequent arrests or offenses. (Tr. 73-74)
Applicant  denied  using  marijuana  on  that  particular  occasion.  (Tr.  35)  He
provided a character letter from a friend of his who was there that night. In the letter, the
friend  also  provided factual details  that  largely  comport with  Applicant’s  explanation  of
what  happened.  (AE  C)  The  record  does  not  include  police  or  court  documents  about
the offense. In the letter, the friend also vouches for Applicant’s character.
Applicant  began  using  marijuana  in  1997,  when  he  was  in  high  school.  He
reported  his  marijuana  use  on  his  October  2016  SCA.  He  reported  daily  use  of
marijuana  from  1997  to  2000.  He  also  said,  “I  smoke  marijuana  on  occasion”  with  a
frequency of “monthly or less.” (GE 1 at 70) (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant  also  used  marijuana  while  he  was  living  in  Europe.  He  knew  it  was
illegal to possess marijuana in the country where he lived. (Tr. 59-61, 69) He also knew
that his use and possession of marijuana was illegal in the U.S. under federal law. (Tr.
70-71)
Applicant  testified  that  he  used  marijuana  about  three  times  after  filling  out  his
SCA.  His  use  was  confined  to  his  home.  (Tr.  71)  His  last  use  of  marijuana  was  in
December  2017.  (Tr.  76-77,  80)  He  acknowledged  that  engaging  in  illegal  activity  (by
continuing  to  use  marijuana)  while  applying  for  a  clearance  was  “a  bit  of  a
contradiction.”  (Tr.  73)  Applicant  testified  that  it  became  clear  to  him  during  his
background  interview  (May  2018)  that  his  marijuana  use  might  negatively  impact  his
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  (Tr.  80-81)  He  testified, however, that  he
thought he might not be granted a clearance, not because of the drug use, but because
of his foreign ties. (Tr. 39, 61-62)
Applicant  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  from  January  1999  to  May  2014,
about 10 times. (SOR ¶ 1.d)(Tr. 50-51) He used the prescription medication oxycodone,
without a prescription, a few times between May 2005 and May 2014. (SOR ¶ 1.c) (Tr.
52-54,  66-67)  Applicant  disclosed  his  use  of  these  substances  on  his  SCA,  and
discussed his use in his background interview. (GE 1; GE 2) Applicant testified that if he
were offered such substances again, he would not accept them.
Applicant also disclosed on his SCA that he used poppy tea, from January 2007
to May 2013, about 50 times. (GE 1)(SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant’s practice was to  purchase
the  poppy  seeds  legally  from  a  flower  store,  and  then  grind  the  seeds  up  and  steep
them in tea. The physiological effect upon consuming the tea was like a sedative or an
opiate. (Tr. 54-55, 68-69)
In mitigation, Applicant testified that he is older and now has a family, as well as
a job he enjoys. He recognizes that holding a clearance is important to him. His current
circumstances are “incompatible with any drug use.” He said his desire to use marijuana
has disappeared. He has found the effects of the drug to be physically taxing, and  “not
compatible with [the] responsibilities I have as a parent or as an employee.” (Tr. 43-44,
69-70) He cited having children as the biggest change in his lifestyle. (Tr. 77-78)
Applicant  testified  that  he  no  longer  attends  parties  or  associates  with  people
who use marijuana. His last use, in December 2017, was with a friend who now lives in
another  part of  the  state.  They  are  no  longer  in  regular  contact.  Applicant’s  wife  does
not  use  marijuana,  though  she  did  rarely  use  it  in  the  past.  (Tr.  48-49,  65,  75-77)
Applicant  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  a  substance  abuse  disorder.  He  has  never
participated in drug treatment or counseling. (Tr. 80-81)
Applicant provided a statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and
substance  misuse.  He  acknowledged  that  any  future  such  involvement  would  be
grounds  for  revocation  of  his  national  security  eligibility.  (AE  A)  He  intends  to  abstain
from illegal drugs entirely. (Tr. 87)
Applicant’s  supervisor  wrote  a  cover  letter  to  convey  his  “absolute  trust”  in
Applicant’s  character  and  judgment.  He  has  known  Applicant  for  many  years.  He
regards Applicant as trustworthy and reliable, and an excellent performer and a leader
at work. Applicant is responsible and credible, and is well qualified to hold a clearance.

"Applicant is a 38-year-old design engineer employed by a defense contractor since
February  2019.  He  was  previously  employed  as  a  shipyard  contractor  employee  from
2004 to 2019. Applicant graduated from high school in 1999, and completed some college
credits. He married in 2002, separated in about 2008, and divorced in 2010. He remarried
in 2018 and has two children that do not live with him. He served on active duty in the
United States Air Force from 2000 until he was honorably discharged in 2004.
The  original  SOR  alleges  Applicant  has  four  delinquent  debts  totaling  about
$45,000.  The  debts  include  a  home  equity  line  of  credit  and  credit  card  accounts.
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations. The amended SOR alleges
under guideline G, that Applicant was arrested in September 2019 for driving under the
influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  The  DUI  allegation  was  cross  alleged  under  Guideline  J.
Applicant admitted the DUI arrest, but denied the cross allegation under Guideline J.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  a  home  equity  line  of  credit  (HELOC)  debt  with  his  former
spouse. According to Applicant’s 2019 credit report, the last payment on the loan was in
October 2013. Applicant’s December 2008 separation agreement permitted him to live in
the property and pay expenses until it was sold, but his former spouse was responsible
for paying the HELOC as required. She did not do so, and the HELOC debt was eventually
charged  off.  Applicant  received  an  IRS  Form  1099-C  (Cancellation  of  Debt)  for  the
charged-off  amount.  The  account  is  resolved.  Of  note,  but  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,
Applicant and his mother lived in the home for about one year without paying the majority
of mortgage payments as required, and the home was foreclosed around 2009.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a consumer credit card debt. The debt was placed for collection in
June  2018.  Applicant  negotiated  a  settlement  and  paid  the  debt  in  June  2018.  This
account is resolved. SOR ¶ 1.c is another credit account with the most recent payment
being paid in August 2017. Applicant resolved it in Jan 2018 and it was removed from his
credit  report.  This  account  is  resolved.  SOR  ¶  1.d  is  a  home  improvement  credit  card
account  that  fell  into  default  and  was  charged  off  in  about  January  2018.  Applicant
testified that  he paid the debt in 2018, and it was removed from his credit report. This
account is resolved.
Applicant  purchased  a  house  in  February  2019,  and  has  not  missed  a  house
payment.  He  has  bank  savings  accounts  valued  at  about  $5,000,  a  401K  retirement
account  valued  at  about  $10,000,  and  a  pension  fund  with  over  $40,000.  His  current
spouse  works  at  the  same  government  facility  as  he  does.  He  has  not  had  financial
counseling.
In  September  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  DUI.  He  met  his  spouse  at  a
restaurant/bar  to  discuss  plans  for  their  wedding  anniversary.  When  he  left,  he  was
stopped for not maintaining his lane, and failed the field-sobriety test. His blood alcohol
level tested at .13%, well over the legal limit. He was confined and released on bail. He
pleaded not guilty in September 2019, and is awaiting trial. Applicant had a previous DUI
in  2006  that  was  resolved  in  2007  with  a  dismissal  after  completing  probation  and  an
alcohol and substance abuse program. He has not submitted to a medical or substance
abuse  evaluation,  although  after  the  hearing  in  this  case,  he  attempted  to  contact
counselors  that  would  accept  a  new  client,  but  so  far  he  has  been  unsuccessful  in
scheduling a program. He noted that he uses a ride share service after drinking when a
designated driver is unavailable. He claims that he drinks one to two beers a week on a
social basis. No character or work performance evidence was submitted.

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except the allegation in ¶ 3.a. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2008. He is not married
and has no children. He was employed from May 2008 to October 2013,  with a private
company. He then worked from October 2013 to July 2016, for a federal contractor. He
left  this  job  because  he  was  having  difficulties  with  his  alcohol use,  and  he  voluntarily
enrolled in an alcohol recovery program where he was a patient for one month. After his
discharge,  he  was  unemployed  for  eight  months  before  starting  work  with  his  current
employer in March 2017. (Items 2, 3, 4, 6)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  March  2010  for  possession  of  marijuana.  He  was  on
probation for a year and completed a drug rehabilitation course. The charge was nolle
prossed.  During  his  August  2018  background  interview,  he  told  the  government
investigator that after his arrest he had no intention of being involved with illegal drugs
again. He made changes in his life and found more positive outlets for his time. There is
no evidence of subsequent drug involvement. (Item 5, 7)
Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in August
2012.  The  charge  was  nolle  prossed.  He  has  had  no  other  alcohol-related  incidents.
Applicant continued to consume alcohol after his arrest, drinking four to six drinks a night.
He  decided  to  address  his  alcohol  consumption  and  voluntarily  entered  an  alcohol
rehabilitation  program  in  July  2016.  This  coincided  with  him  leaving  his  job  and
subsequent unemployment. He was diagnosed by a medical doctor with alcohol abuse
disorder.  He  successfully  completed  the  rehabilitation  program.  He  indicated  in  his
answer  to  government  interrogatories  that  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  August
2016. There is no evidence to the contrary. (Items 4, 5, 7)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  August  2017.
Section 22 asked if he had ever been charged with an offense involving drugs or alcohol.
Applicant  failed  to  disclose  his  marijuana  arrest  and  his  DUI.  In  his  SOR  answer,  he
explained that he misread the question believing it asked him if he had been convicted of
these  type  of  offenses.  I  found  his  explanation  credible  and  conclude  he  did  not
intentionally fail to disclose the requested information. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
The SOR alleges 29 delinquent debts totaling approximately $165,742. Applicant
admitted owing all of the debts. He was confronted with many of these debts during his
background interviews. He indicated his willingness to pay his debts and attributed them
to poor decisions he made when he was consuming alcohol. He was going to look into
the debts and work to resolve them. (Items 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)
In  June  2019,  Applicant  began  working  with  a  law  firm  to  help  him  dispute  and
settle his delinquent debts. He provided a copy of the agreement and information included
to show he had disputed certain debts that were removed from his credit report. He has
delinquent  student  loans  that  total  approximately  $117,598  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b;  this
amount is included in the overall delinquent debt balance). It appears he has two debts
owed for vehicles (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-$12,848 and 1.n-$17,688); numerous medical debts (SOR
¶¶  1.d-$8,051;  1.i-$351;  1.p-$720;  1.s-$409;  1.v-$132;  1.x-$92;  1.y-$80;  1.z-$80;  1.aa
$65; 1.bb-$60 and 1.cc-$39); delinquent rent (SOR ¶ 1.e-$2,218); and other consumer
and payday loans. (Items 2, 4, 5, 8, 9)
Applicant did not provide information that any of the alleged SOR debts have been
settled  or  paid.  The  document  he  provided  showed  that  nine  debts  were  removed,
presumably from his credit report. Only one debt removed may possibly be included in
the SOR, but the only information noted is that the creditor is “medical.” It does not specify
the amount of the medical debt or the collector. The other debts removed do not appear
to be those included in the SOR. Applicant did not provide any evidence to identify if any
other debts removed were alleged in the SOR. He did not provide any other information
about whether he has paid any of these debts, even the smallest ones. (Items 2, 4, 5, 8,
9)
During his background interview, Applicant indicated that his finances were stable,
and he was working to better manage them. He did not provide a budget or any other
information  about  his  finances  or  any  proof  that  he  has  paid  or  settled  any  of  his
delinquent  debts.  Applicant  received  his  college  degree  in  2008.  He  provided  no
explanation for his failure to make payments on his student loans when due and while he
was  employed.  He  indicated  to  the  government  investigator  that  he  was  making
arrangements to pay his student loans. He did not provide evidence that he has done so.

"Applicant is 51 and is separated from his wife. He has a bachelor’s degree and
has worked for his current employer since 2018. Applicant is seeking to obtain a security
clearance in connection with his work with the DoD. (Item 2 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national
security  eligibility  because  he  has  engaged  in  conduct  of  a  criminal  nature.  Applicant
admitted both allegations in the SOR, with explanations.
Applicant  was  arrested  on  September  9,  2018,  and  was  charged  with  Driving
Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol,  Driving  with  Blood  Alcohol  more  than  .08%,  and
Transportation of Liquor. Applicant stated in both of his Answers that he had started blood
pressure medication and it had reacted badly with alcohol he had been drinking. He pulled
over into a gas station, where he passed out and was later awakened by a police officer.
Police records state that Applicant showed obvious signs of intoxication when he
was  approached  by  the  police,  and  had  an  open  can  of  beer  in  his  car.  At  the  police
station  Applicant  was  given  a  breathalyzer  test  that  showed  a  blood  alcohol  level  of
.146%, far above the .08% legal limit. He was cited for the three offenses mentioned in
the SOR. (Item 5.)
Applicant stated in his Answers, “My case was an ongoing situation at the time of
the  DOD  interview  [February  20,  2019]  that  constituted  a  ‘no’  answer  from  me  at  that
time.” This statement is incorrect. Court records show that Applicant personally appeared
in court on November 29, 2018. He pleaded guilty to Driving with Blood Alcohol more than
.08%. The other two charges were Nolle Prossed. He was sentenced to 24 months court
supervision,  to  pay  a  fine,  attend  ten  hours  of  DUI  risk  education,  and  20  hours  of
substance abuse education. His court supervision is due to end on November 30, 2020.
The court record does not show that Applicant completed any part of his sentence and a
bench warrant was issued on March 16, 2019, for failure to appear. (Item 6.)
Applicant stated in his Answers that he moved and that his attorney told him that
he would not have to appear further. The record shows the court received a change of
address from the Applicant on November 30, 2018. Applicant indicated in Answer One,
and again two months later in Answer Two, that he would be following up with his attorney
to resolve the matter. There is no evidence that he did so. (Item 6.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Appellant is ineligible for clearance
because he falsified material facts during the clearance screening process.
Applicant  filled  out  his  e-QIP  on  December  13,  2018.  Section  22  of  the  e-QIP
asked,  “Have  you  EVER  been  charged  with  an  offense  related  to  alcohol  or  drugs?”
(Emphasis in original.) Applicant responded, “No.” This was a false answer to a relevant
question about Applicant’s criminal history. (Item 2.)
In  Answer  Two  Applicant  basically  stated  that  he  could  not  admit  or  deny  this
allegation  because  it  had  not  been  “verified.”  He  went  on  to  say  that  his  case  was  an
ongoing situation and he could not answer yes or no.
This explanation is rejected for two reasons. First, Applicant’s explanation is not
reasonable. The question is not subject to misinterpretation. He was arrested, charged,
and convicted of Driving with Blood Alcohol more than .08% two weeks before filling out
the e-QIP.
Second, Applicant also falsified the e-QIP when he answered, “No,” to two other
questions  under  Section  22.  Specifically,  Applicant  was  asked  whether  he  had  been
arrested within the past seven years. He was also asked whether he had been charged,
convicted  or  sentenced  of  a  crime  in  any  court  in  the  past  seven  years.  While  these
falsifications cannot be used as disqualifying matters in the case in chief because they
were not alleged in the SOR, I find that his conduct evidences an intent to deceive with
respect to the alleged falsification, and greatly weakens the credibility of his explanation.
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  evidence  concerning  the  quality  of  his  job
performance.  He  submitted  no  character  references  or  other  evidence  tending  to
establish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or  reliability.  I  was  unable  to  evaluate  his
credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided
without a hearing.

admissions,  I  make  the  following  findings  of  fact:    Applicant  is  42  years  old  and
employed  by  a  DOD  contractor  as  an  electrician  since  March  2007.  He  earned  his
associate’s  degree  in  2002.  He  was  married  in  2007,  and  his  divorce  was  finalized  in
2018. Applicant listed a daughter, age 15, on the 2018 SCA. He is requesting national
security eligibility to perform specific employment duties. (Item 5)
Under  Guideline  J,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  was  charged  with  criminal
offenses,  primarily  of  a  violent  nature,  on  eight  different  occasions  between  1997  and
2018. (Items 1, 4)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  was  charged  with  assault  and  brandishing  a
firearm  in  approximately  October  1997.  Applicant  told  the  investigator  during  his  July
2018 background interview that he was at a restaurant and was approached by a male
accusing  Applicant  of  sleeping  with  his  girlfriend.  The  man  tackled  Applicant  to  the
ground  and  a  fight  ensued  between  the  men.  Applicant  claimed  he  fought  the  man  in
self-defense. Based on the arrest records in evidence, Applicant was arrested for these
offenses  in  September  1997.  Both  charges  were  subsequently  dismissed  in  October
1997.  This  is  the  only  allegation  he  denied  in  his  SOR  response.  The  adverse
information  is  verified  by  Applicant’s  notarized  response  to  interrogatories,  criminal
records from the sheriff, and his Federal Bureau of Information (FBI) record. (Items 6, 7,
14)  There  is  sufficient  evidence  to  support  this  allegation,  and  due  to  the  dissimilar
facts, I do not find this criminal offense was confused with the offense set forth below.
Applicant admitted responsibility for the criminal conduct concerning his arrest in
August 1998 for assault and battery and brandishing a firearm. (SOR ¶ 1.b) He said that
he was dropping off his girlfriend at her job when two unknown males walked up to his
vehicle  and  started  harassing  him  and  his  girlfriend.  Applicant  grabbed  his  gun,  but
claimed  that  he  never  pointed  it  at  anyone.  The  two  males  contacted  the  police  who
took Applicant into custody. He was convicted of both charges, sentenced to ten days in
jail, and fined. (Items 4, 6, 14)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  in  December  2005,  Applicant  was  charged  with
intimidation  and  a  weapons  offense.  His  wife  reported  to  police  that  they  had  been
involved in an argument around 1:30 a.m. when Applicant pulled out a semi-automatic
pistol. Although his wife denied that he had pointed the gun at her, she stated that he
chambered a round in the gun and threatened to kill her. Applicant was arrested, but the
charges against him were subsequently nolle prossed. (Items 4, 8, 14)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  was  charged  with  simple  assault  in  January
2008. He was riding in his truck with a woman he had been dating for about one month.
They  got  into  an  argument  over  politics.  Applicant  became  furious  and  ordered  the
woman  out  of  his  truck. When  she  refused,  he  pulled  over and  attempted  to  push  the
woman  out  of  the  truck.  He  eventually  dropped  her  off  at  a  convenience  store  with  a
swollen lip, and she reported the incident to police. Applicant was charged with simple
assault,  but  the  charge  was  later  dropped  due  to  the  victim’s failure  to  cooperate  with
the prosecution. (Items 4, 9)
Applicant  admitted  responsibility  for  the  criminal  conduct  concerning  his  charge
in July 2014 for assault and battery  on a family member. (SOR ¶ 1.e) He and his wife
reported to police that they were arguing when he pushed her in the back and caused
her  to  hit  a  wall  and  injure  her  hand.  Applicant  drove  his  wife  to  the  emergency  room
where she reported the incident to the medical staff and advised that she was afraid of
her husband. Police were called to the hospital, and Applicant admitted he had pushed
his wife to get her off of him.  He was charged with simple assault, but the charge was
subsequently nolle prossed. (Items 4, 6, 10)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that in approximately August 2015, Applicant was charged with
destruction  of  property  (value  less  than  $1,000).  Applicant  went  to  his  mother-in-law’s
house to pick up his daughter. He honked the horn, but no one came out of the house.
As he drove out of the driveway, he spun his tires and rocks from the gravel driveway
caused  damage  to  his  mother-in-law’s  property.  He  was  charged  with  destruction  of
property (value less than $1,000), but the charge was later dismissed. (Items 4, 5, 6, 11)
The  SOR  alleges  that  in  about  July  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  felony
criminal history false statement. (SOR ¶ 1.g) He ordered an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle
from an online store. As part of the purchase process, Applicant was required to fill out
a  form  wherein  he  was  asked  about  his  criminal  history.  At  the  time,  his  wife  had  an
active protective order against him that he failed to disclose. He claimed that he thought
the  protective  order  had  already  expired.  He  was  charged  with  felony  criminal  history
false statement, and the charge was subsequently dismissed. (Items 4, 5, 6, 12)
In approximately January 2018, Applicant’s wife was at his home, although they
were in the process of getting a divorce. He arrived home around 2:30 a.m. and became
physically  violent  with  his  wife  because  he  suspected  she  had  communicated  with
another man  on  the  phone.  He  jumped  on  her,  punched  in  the  back  of  the  head,  and
pushed her head into a pillow (making it difficult for her to breathe), punched her in the
stomach, and threatened to kill her. His wife could not call police because Applicant had
taken  her  phone  away.  The  next  morning  Applicant  was  still  threatening  her,  so  she
sent a note with their daughter going to school which requested the police be called and
sent to the house. The police report identified bruises on his wife’s wrist, abrasions on
her  right  forearm,  scratches  on  the  back  of  her  neck,  and  a  bruise  on  her  right  cheek
bone.  All  injuries  were  photographed.  Applicant  was  charged  with  assault  and  battery
and  an  emergency  protective  order  was  issued.  Prosecution  was  deferred  until  April
2020, and if there were no further incidents, the charge would be dismissed. (Items 4, 6,
13)
Applicant  noted  in  his  SOR  response  that  there  were  several  criminal  offenses
that  did  not  result  in  a  final  conviction.  He  did  not  provide  any  information  about
counseling  or  participation  in  an  anger-management  program.  He  has  presented  no
favorable evidence of his employment record or community involvement. (Item 4)

"Applicant  admitted  SOR ¶¶ 1.a,  2.a,  and 3.a-3.c,  with  explanations,  and denied
SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.c. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  49  years  old.  She  has  never  married  and  has  one  child.  She  is
seeking  a  position  requiring  a  security  clearance.  She  previously  held  a  security
clearance  before  it  was  revoked  by  another  government  agency  (AGA)  in  2013.  She
currently works as an information technology (IT) systems engineer. She has worked for
her current employer (her clearance sponsor) since June 2018. She holds a bachelor’s
degree. She also owns a fitness business. (Tr. 11-8; 46; GE 5-8)
The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  E,  that  Applicant  committed  employee  theft
between 1989 and 1990 by stealing approximately 25 pieces of clothing (SOR ¶ 1.a). It
also  alleged  that  between  2000  and  2005,  while  employed  by  employer-1  (E1),  and
between 2005 and 2007, while employed by employer-2 (E2), Applicant stole numerous
computer hardware items, including computer towers, monitors, keyboards, mouse sets,
speakers, laptop computers, memory sticks, a hard drive, and a digital scanner (SOR ¶¶
1.b-1.c).  The  employee  theft  of  clothing  was  also  alleged  as  criminal  activity  (SOR  ¶
2.a). Under Guideline M, the SOR alleged that Applicant engaged in illegal downloading
of movies from 1993-2008; music from 2008-2011; and computer software, games, and
emulators (SOR ¶¶ 3.a-3.c).
In  December  2011,  Applicant’s  employer  sponsored  her  for  access  to  AGA’s
sensitive compartmented information (SCI). Applicant held a top secret clearance at that
time. A corresponding background investigation ensued and Applicant was interviewed
and  required  to  take  a  polygraph  examination.  In  March  2012,  during  her  interview,
Applicant admitted that in approximately 1990, she used stolen credit cards to purchase
clothing  items.  The  credit  cards  were  from  a  customer  who  reported  her  purse  stolen
from  the  store  where  Applicant  worked.  A  police  investigation  revealed  Applicant  and
her friend as the crime perpetrators. She was charged with felony theft, but the charges
were  reduced  to  misdemeanors.  She  paid  restitution  and  served  a  work-release
sentence. (Tr. 48; GE 2-5)
Also  during  the  March  2012  interview,  Applicant admitted  that  while  working  for
two  different  employers  (one  was  a  successor  contractor  to  the  other)  from  2000  to
2007 she took, without permission or authorization, numerous computer items, including
multiple  computer  towers,  monitors,  keyboards,  mouse  sets,  speakers,  and  memory
sticks. She also took at least three laptop computers. She used these herself at home
and gave several away to family members, her friends, and even her church. The value
of  the  items  was  in  excess  of  several  thousands  of  dollars.  She  explained  to  the
interviewer that she took the items because she could not afford to buy similar items at
the time and the company was overstocked with these surplus items. She was told by a
government  employee  that  the  items  were  to  be  strictly  accounted  for,  but  he  also
insinuated  that  he  did  not  care  if  she  took  things.  She  knew  what  she  was  doing  was
wrong and she stopped. In her SOR answer and during her testimony, Applicant backed
away from total acceptance of responsibility for her actions and claimed she had verbal
authority from a supervisor to take the items. She also claimed that there was a culture
of permissiveness when it came to computer accountability at these companies during
that  time.  Her  SOR  responses  on  this  issue  and  her  testimony  were  not  credible.  (Tr.
47; GE 5-6, 8)
Applicant  further  related,  during  her  March  2012  interview,  that  she  engaged  in
illegally  downloading  of  music,  movies,  software,  games,  and  emulators  from
approximately  1993  to  2011.  She  estimated  that  she  downloaded  over  10,000  songs
valued  at  over  $10,000  and  over  hundreds  of  movies  valued  at  over  $5,000.  She
engaged  in  this activity  using  her personal computer  equipment and  other  times  using
her  employer’s  computers  and  peripherals.  She  also  illegally  downloaded  software,
game programs, and emulators valued at between $400 and $1,000. Between 2002 and
2007,  she  also  downloaded  music  and  movies  from  a  government  server  without
authorization. In her hearing testimony, Applicant claimed that the permissive culture at
the  government  agency  allowed  the  downloading  from  the  government  server  for
personal use. (Tr. 47; GE 5, 6)
Applicant’s actions described above were fully investigated by AGA and she was
denied  SCI  access  in  December  2012.  Applicant  appealed  that  decision  in  February
2013, and the denial decision was sustained in March 2013. (GE 5-7)
Applicant’s former supervisor from 2006 to 2007 testified that he had no personal
knowledge of Applicant taking company property during that timeframe. He commented
that there was a lack of accountability standards at the company when he took over his
position in 2006. Even though he has not worked with Applicant since that time, he has
stayed  in  contact  with  her  and  is  not  aware  of  any  other  bad  acts  on  her  part.  He
believes that she learned from this incident and has grown because of it. (Tr. 37, 39-41,
43-44)
Applicant  also  presented  written  letters  of  thanks  from  a  former  employer  in
2016, and a certificate of excellence from her employer in 2008. She presented a letter
from  her  supervisor  in  2018  who  fully  described  her  talents  and  skills  within  their
organization.  He  further  described  Applicant  as  a  reliable  and  trustworthy  employee.
Additionally,  Applicant  presented  documentation  showing  her  active  community
involvement by restoring a local residence for cancer patients and her participation in a
local  community  workgroup.  She  is  described  as  an  intelligent,  caring,  and  excellent
team  player.  Applicant  testified  that,  other  than  traffic  tickets,  she  has  not  had  any
further involvement with law enforcement. (Tr. 51; AE A-C, E, H)

"Applicant is a 52-year-old engineering manager currently employed by a defense
contractor since October 2015, and employed in the defense industry since 1993. He has
held a clearance since 1996. He earned a bachelor of science degree in mathematics in
1993. He and his current wife married in 2004. They have a blended family  with three
children ages 19, 18, and 11. (GX 1.)
The SOR alleges under Guideline J that Applicant was arrested in October 2012
and charged with felony aggravated child abuse. The arrest was based on accusations
made  by  Applicant’s  oldest  son  and  Applicant’s  ex-wife.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was
arrested, but denies that he committed any criminal act.
Applicant and his ex-wife married in 1996 and divorced in November 2004. At the
time of the divorce, Applicant and his ex-wife had a 5-year-old son. Following the divorce,
Applicant and his ex-wife have repeatedly returned to court over issues of custody and
child support. Their relationship is contentious, at best. (AX A - AX E.)
In October 2012, Applicant and his ex-wife had joint custody of their 12-year-old
son.  At  the  request  of  his  ex-wife,  Applicant  went  to  her  house  to  discipline  their  son.
Applicant’s ex-wife met Applicant in the driveway and showed him marks on her wrists
where  their  son  had  grabbed  her  while  she  was  trying  to  punish  him  for  failing  math.
Applicant entered the house and confronted his son. Applicant, in the presence of his ex-
wife,  removed  his  belt  and  hit  his  son  three  times  with  it  for  being  disrespectful  to  his
mother. Applicant further told his son that he would not be permitted to participate in any
extracurricular activities until his math grade improved. (Tr. 28-31.)
The following  week,  Applicant had  custody  of  his  son. Applicant  learned from  a
friend of his daughter’s that Applicant’s son had posted, “I hate my f-ing dad’s guts” on a
social  media  account.  Applicant  was  distressed  by  the  post,  but  was  also  distressed
because he did not allow his children to have social media accounts. (Tr. 32-33.)
Applicant logged in to the site and pulled up his son’s post. Applicant showed the
post to his son and demanded that his son read the post aloud. His son was clearly afraid,
and  refused  to  read  the  post.  Applicant  “popped”  his  son  in  the  back  of  the  head  and
again demanded that his son read the post aloud. His son refused. Applicant grabbed his
son by the front of the shirt and catching his son’s leather necklace, a scuffle ensued, and
Applicant’s son ended up on the kitchen floor, screaming and crying. Applicant told his
son to calm down and go to bed. (Tr. 32-36.)
The next morning, Applicant’s son wore a shirt buttoned to the neck to school. In
the early afternoon, Applicant got a telephone call informing him that he needed to go to
the county’s child advocacy center for some issues with his son. When Applicant arrived,
his ex-wife’s car was already there. Applicant was met by county officers who wanted to
discuss aggravated child abuse charges with Applicant. Applicant’s ex-wife had told the
officers about the incident the night before, as well as the spanking incident the previous
week, which combined, rose to the level of felony aggravated child abuse. (Tr. 36-40.)
Applicant was shown photographs of his son’s neck which had multiple red marks
on it. Applicant did not see any marks on his son’s neck following the scuffle or the next
morning because of his son’s fully buttoned shirt, but believes they were possibly caused
in part by the leather necklace, but were primarily self-inflicted by his son. (Tr. 90-91; GX
2; Tr. 61-63.)
Applicant  was  indicted  by  a  grand  jury,  arrested,  and  charged  with  felony
aggravated  child  abuse.  (GX  4.)  He  properly  reported  the  arrest  to  his  facility  security
officer who instructed Applicant to keep the security office informed. Applicant’s ex-wife
immediately filed for child support and sole custody of their son. Following the indictment,
the  contract  on  which Applicant  was  working  went  to another  contractor and  Applicant
was laid off. Despite submitting hundreds of job applications, Applicant was unemployed
for approximately 11 months. (Tr. 38-41.)
After approximately two years, in September 2014, on the advice of his attorney,
Applicant pled guilty to third-degree assault, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to one
year in prison, which was suspended for two years; two years’ supervised probation; a
$500 fine; $250 restitution; and 40 hours community service. Applicant was also required
to complete: a domestic violence program; a parenting program; an anger management
program; and  undergo  an  assessment for  drug  or  alcohol  abuse. A  protective  order  in
Applicant’s  son’s  favor  was  entered  against  Applicant  which  required  him  to  have  no
contact with his son. (GX 4.) Applicant completed restitution in March 2016, all other court
requirements between 2013 and 2015, and was released from probation without violation
in  October  2015.  (AX  F  -  AX  J.)  Applicant  has  not  had  any  contact  with  his  son  since
2012. (Tr. 40-41.)
Applicant’s  wife,  who  was  present  during  the  incident  with  Applicant’s  son,
recounted the events in accord with Applicant. The following day, she met Applicant at
the child advocacy center, and was interviewed and gave a written statement to the police
wherein she emphatically stated that Applicant had not abused his son. Applicant’s wife
was  shown  pictures  of  the  marks  on  Applicant’s  son’s  neck,  and  was  shocked.  She
testified that there were no markings or injuries on Applicant’s son’s neck when he went
to bed after the incident. (Tr. 77-85.) She further testified to the strength of character of
Applicant, and stated that Applicant is a devoted father to all of their children and would
never abuse any of them. (Tr. 75-76.)
Applicant’s  mother  testified  that  Applicant  has  never  been  an  overly  strict
disciplinarian, and has been a very involved father for all of his children. (Tr. 100-102.)
Applicant’s friend, who is also a pastor, stated that Applicant discussed the situation with
his  son  with  him,  and  that  Applicant  was  deeply  affected  by  the  situation.  (Tr.  107.)
Applicant’s friend of over 13 years, who is a public school nurse and was previously an
emergency  room  nurse,  has  witnessed  victims  of  child  abuse.  She  has  observed
Applicant and his wife around all of their children and has never witnessed any type or
pattern of abuse in their household. (Tr. 112 – 113.)
Applicant’s  testimony  was  credible  and  remorseful. The  summary  of Applicant’s
personal subject interview (PSI) and his Answer are consistent with his testimony and his
wife’s testimony. Applicant has never been accused of any other abuse. Applicant wrote
a letter to his son at the time of the incident stating “I’m here for you.” He has maintained
the  same  cell  phone  numbers  and  hopes  and  prays  that  someday  his  son  will  contact
him. (Tr. 66.)

married in September 2015, and he and his wife have a son, born November 2016. He
seeks to retain the clearance he was issued in November 2005.
Applicant used alcohol under questionable circumstances from June 2008 to July
2012,  resulting  in  three  incidents  indicative  of  poor  judgment.  In  June  2008,  he  was
charged with operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol (SOR 1.a). He received
and  completed  probation  before  judgment,  and  the  charge  was  dismissed.  In  August
2011, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, when he had a .12%
blood alcohol content (SOR 1.c). He was otherwise satisfactorily completing the terms
of  his  sentence  when  he  was  again  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  (.12%
blood alcohol content), and speeding, in May 2012 (SOR 1.d). Because of this second
arrest, Applicant was found to be in violation of the terms of his probation for the August
2011  arrest,  and  received  additional  punishment  (SOR  1.e).  Applicant  ultimately
completed the sentencing requirements of these arrests, and has been off probation for
over three years (Tr. 39, AE A). Applicant’s criminal record included a July 2010 driving
on a suspended license charge which was nolle prossed (SOR 1.b),  and a July 2012
citation for possessing alcohol in a campground (SOR 1.e).4
Between 2008 and 2010, at a time Applicant was in an apprenticeship program
with  his  employer,  Applicant  used  marijuana  2-3  times  with  coworkers.  Applicant  was
not aware that he had been granted a clearance in November 2005, but was aware that
he had applied for a clearance. Applicant has not used marijuana since 2010, and the
coworkers with whom he used marijuana are no longer employed by the company.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  his  poor  decisions  reflect  adversely  on  his
judgment, but attributes them to his youth (Tr. 22, 42). However, he notes that since his
marriage and the birth of his son, his lifestyle has changed. His wife’s family does not
engage in the kind of misconduct that punctuated Applicant’s youth, and he wants to set
a good example for his son and maintain the kind of good image his wife’s family has.

In  May  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  negligent  driving  in  a  careless  and
imprudent  manner,  endangering  property,  life,  and  person,  and  driving  under  the
influence  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  2.a).  He  was  on  a  date  with  his  child’s  mother  at  a  sushi
restaurant.  He  drank  sake  for  the  first  time.  He  did  not  feel  intoxicated  so  he  drove
home.  As  he  approached  his  home,  the  road  that  he  lived  on  was  flooded.  He
unknowingly  drove  his  car  on  top  of  a  submerged  tree,  then  called  the  police  for
assistance. The responding officer asked him if he had been drinking, and he said “Yes”
and  disclosed  that  he  had  consumed  a  “couple  of  sak[e]s.”  The  officer  looked  into  his
eyes  with  a  flashlight  and  administered  a  walk-and-turn  sobriety  test.  The  officer  then
placed him in the front seat of the officer’s car, without handcuffs, and drove him to the
precinct.  There,  he  was  administered  a  breathalyzer  test  and  tested  under  the  legal
limit.  He  received  18  months  of  probation  before  judgment,  a  $140  fine,  and  he  was

mother and they got into a verbal argument. She called the police and reported that he
hit her on her leg, which he denied. The case was placed on a stet docket. In August
2015,  the  case  was  taken  out  of  the  stet  docket  when  he  was  again  charged  with
second-degree assault (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.a). He testified that he and his child’s mother got
into  another  argument,  after  she  hit  him  on  his  head  with  a  remote.  He  denied  hitting
her.  He  stated  that  “She  was  coming  at  me  in  an  aggressive  way,”  so  he  threw  her
purse  at  her,  and  the  buckle  of  the  purse  scratched  her  forehead  and  caused  her  to
bleed. When the police arrived, they immediately arrested him upon seeing the blood on
her  forehead.  At  trial,  his  child’s  mother  admitted  that  she  lied  about  the  July  incident
and  he  was  consequently  found  not  guilty  of  that  charge.  He  received  24  months  of
probation  before  judgment  for  the  August  charge,  and  he  was  ordered  to  attend
domestic-violence counseling. He completed counseling in 2016 and probation in 2017.
He has since returned to the counseling program on invitation to share his experiences
with other attendees.7
In  June  2018,  Applicant  was  charged  with  second-degree  assault  for  the  third
time  (SOR  ¶¶  1.f,  2.a).  He  testified  that  he  told  his  child’s  mother  that  he  no  longer
wanted her living with him. He then went to his weekly church group and returned to a
vandalized  home.  He  told  her  to  take  what  she  wanted  but  leave  their  son  with  him,
since he was the sole breadwinner. He grabbed her keys and got into a tug-of-war with
her over her cell phone, which he wanted to keep because he paid for it. When he let go

of the phone, he fell backwards onto the floor, and as he was standing up, she said “you
just  hit  me,  I’m  calling  the  police.”  He  gathered  his  belongings  and  went  to  a  friend’s
house  to  spend  the  night.  In  the  morning,  he  reported  to  the  police  station  to  try  to
provide his statement to any report that she might have filed the previous night. He was
given the name and number of the reporting officer, because the officer was not at the
station, and he left the officer a voicemail. He returned to the station when the officer did
not return his call, and another officer was sent to his home later that day. That officer
told  him  that  there  was  no  police  report  filed  and  he  was  not  charged.  He  was  thus
surprised  when  he  received  a  court  summons  reflecting  that  he  had,  in  fact,  been
charged with second-degree assault. His child’s mother claimed in a police report that
he  hit  her  and  placed  her  in  a  headlock.  He  hired  an  attorney  and  intends  to  fight  the
charge. The case was scheduled for a pre-trial hearing in December 2018.8
Applicant testified that the relationship between him and his child’s mother ended
in December 2017. As her name is still on the lease, she has continued to reside in their
home approximately two to three days out of the week. He unsuccessfully attempted to
remove  her  name  from  the  lease.  He  has  known  her  since  elementary  school.  They
dated  briefly  in  high  school  but  fell  out  of  touch  when  their  families  moved.  They
reconnected and began dating again in May 2014. He testified that he did not take the
time to get to know her, and he learned throughout the course of their relationship that
she  has  a  criminal  background,  to  include  domestic-violence-related  charges  from
previous relationships. He also learned that “the way that she communicates is through
violence. And she’s clever. I have to give that to her because she calls the police.” He
testified that he never initiated any violence, as he is not a violent person. He has not
brought  domestic-violence-related  charges  against  her  because  she  is  his  child’s
mother and does not want her to get into trouble.9
In  the  future,  Applicant  intends  to  be  more  pragmatic  in  how  he  assesses  and
responds  to  situations  involving  his  child’s  mother,  and  to  call  the  police  if  necessary.
He  no  longer  intends  to  protect  her  at  his  expense.  He  does  not  have  any  other
criminal-related  incidents.  He  testified  that  his  employer  was  aware  of  his  2014  and
2015  charges,  but  he  had  not  yet  reported  his  2018  charge.  While  he  was  concerned
about the impact on his employment that the outcome of his 2018 charge would have,
he was not concerned about his employer finding out about it.10
The SOR also alleges the following delinquent accounts: a medical debt of $478
(SOR ¶ 3.a); eight student loans totaling $118,656 (SOR ¶¶ 3.b-3.i); and four consumer
accounts totaling $1,602 (SOR ¶¶ 3.j-3.m). The debts are established by a 2018 credit
bureau  report.  Applicant  also  disclosed  his  debts  in  his  2015  security  clearance
application (SCA).11

Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to  being  the  primary  provider  from
approximately  2014  to  2018  for  his  child,  his  child’s  mother,  and  her  10-year-old  child
from a previous relationship. He was also involved in a no-fault car accident in which his
car  was  totaled.  He  received  $4,000  from  the  accident,  but  he  had  to  apply  it towards
the  expense  of  obtaining  another  car.  He  attributed  his  minor  medical  debt  to  his
involuntary termination.12
SOR ¶ 3.a is for a $478 medical debt. Applicant testified that he believed he had
health  insurance  after  his  involuntary  termination  from  a  previous  employer.  He
indicated  that  he  did  not  receive  a  bill  for  his  visit  to  an  urgent  care  center  for  strep
throat, and he was unaware of this debt until he received the SOR. He researched the
debt and intended to resolve it with his tax refund.13
SOR ¶¶ 3.b through 3.i are for Applicant’s eight defaulted student loans from his
bachelor’s  degree,  totaling  approximately  $118,656.  He  testified  that  he  first  learned
that  his  loans  were  in  default  when  he  began  working  with  the  credit-repair  company
Lexington  Law  in  May  2018  to  resolve  his  delinquent  accounts,  as  he  did  not  receive
any  delinquent  notices.  He  contacted  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  after  he
received  the  amended  SOR  in  November  2018,  and  he  set  up  an  income-based
payment  plan  of  $5  monthly  for  nine  months  to  get  his  loans  out  of  default.  As  of  the
date  of  the  hearing,  he  paid  a  total  of  $10  towards  that  plan;  he  also  made  a  $10
payment in December 2018. He intended to continue to abide by the payment plan, and
once  his  loans  were  out  of  default,  he  intended  to  make  timely  monthly  payments
towards his student loans.14
SOR  ¶¶  3.j  and  3.k  are  for  two  credit  cards  in  collection  for  a  total  of  $827.
Applicant  testified  that  he  cosigned  the  credit  cards  for  his  child’s  mother  in
approximately 2015. He intended to resolve them with his tax refund.15
SOR ¶ 3.l is for a charged-off credit-card account for $238. Applicant testified that
he was a victim of identity theft or hacking, so he closed his account with the creditor in
2015. He testified that he is a claimant to a pending federal lawsuit against the creditor,
and he believed the account would be resolved through the lawsuit. He testified that he
disputed  the  debt  through  Lexington  Law.  Since  he  canceled  his  subscription  with
Lexington Law, he intended to dispute the debt directly with the credit bureaus.16

SOR ¶  3.m  is  for  another  charged-off  credit-card  account  for  $537.  Applicant
testified  that  this  debt  is  for  his  credit  card,  which  he  forgot  about.  He  intended  to
resolve it with his tax refund.17
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  worked  as  a  financial  analyst  for  his
current employer. He was promoted in October 2018. His annual income was $61,200.
He  testified  that  he  received  financial  counseling  from  three  credit-repair  companies,
Credit Karma in 2016, and Credit Sesame and Lexington Law in 2018. He canceled his
subscription  to  Lexington  Law  because  he  did  not  find  them  helpful;  however,  he  was
continuing  to  monitor  his  credit  through  Credit  Sesame.  He  has  also  received  budget
training at work, and he has a budget. He is current on his rent of $1,225 monthly and
his car payment of $360 monthly. He continues to be primarily responsible for his child’s
expenses,  as  his  child’s  mother  does  not  contribute.  After  expenses,  his  monthly  net
remainder is approximately $500. He has a savings account with a balance of $140. He
has  a  retirement  account  with  an  unknown  balance.  He  testified  that  “I’m  just  now
starting to really take control of my finances,” whereas in the past five years, he focused
on his immediate, day-to-day expenses.18
Applicant’s  previous  supervisor  described  Applicant  as  an  “exceptional  member
of our team,” and stated that he had “full confidence in [Applicant’s] ability to maintain [a
security  clearance].”  Applicant’s  pastor  of  ten  years  described  Applicant  as  a  highly
professional and trustworthy individual. A friend of ten years described Applicant to be
an “upstanding, centered, and skilled gentleman.”19

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with limited comments, nearly all of
the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through
1.d., and 1.f.); he failed to admit or deny one allegation pertaining to personal conduct
(SOR  ¶  1.e.),  so a  denial  was  registered for  him;  he  admitted,  with  limited  comments,
nearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR ¶¶ 2.a. through
2.c.); he failed to admit or deny one allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR ¶ 2.d.),
so  a  denial  was  registered  for  him;  and  he  admitted  several  allegations  pertaining  to
financial considerations (SOR ¶¶ 3.i. through 3.n.). He denied, with limited comments, all
of the remaining allegations.
During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  SOR  by  adding
eight  additional  factual  allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  3.o.
1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December
10, 2016, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or
continued  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  or  eligibility  to  hold  a  sensitive  position,  were
established  to  supersede  all  previously  issued  national  security  adjudicative  criteria  or  guidelines.
Accordingly,  those  guidelines  previously  implemented  on  September  1,  2006,  under  which  this  security
clearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the two versions, there is no substantial
difference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case.
2 Although the pre-printed form upon which Applicant selected the chosen forum was dated 2016,
it is clear that if the SOR was issued in December 2016, he could not have received it in January 2016.
3 Although a copy of the purported transcript was received on October 2, 2018, while the cover of
the  transcript  was  the  one  for  this  case,  the  contents  were  associated  with  a  different  case.  Upon
determining the error, the correct transcript was electronically transmitted to me on January 17, 2019.
through 3.v.). There being no objection, the motion was granted.4 Applicant was afforded
20 days to respond to the new allegations. He failed to admit or deny any of the added
allegations pertaining to financial considerations, so denials were registered for him.
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact.
After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  missile  assembler  with  his  current  employer  since  October  2004.  Although  he
attended high school for six years, in 2000, he received a certificate of completion, but
not  a  diploma.  He  has  never  served  in  the  U.S.  military.  He  was  granted  a  secret
clearance in 2004. Applicant has never married, but he has resided with a cohabitant for
an  unspecified  period,  and  he  had  four  children,  born  in  2002,  2004,  2008,  and  2015,
respectively.
Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct
Applicant has a lengthy history of disregarding laws, rules, and regulations. The
SOR alleged nine incidents of criminality and personal conduct by Applicant commencing
in 2006, and continuing until at least 2016.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 3.n.): In June 2006, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving with
Suspended License, 2) Operating a Vehicle without Insurance, and 3) Switched Tag. He
was convicted and fined.5 He was granted a payment plan. While he paid $35 associated
with the Switched Tag conviction, he failed to pay the remaining $256 for that charge, and
the $306 and $356 for the other charges.6
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 3.n.): In July 2012, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving while
License  Suspended,  and  2)  Operating  a  Vehicle  without  Insurance.  He  was  convicted
and fined.7 He was granted a payment plan. While he paid $356 for the Insurance charge,
and  $244  associated  with  the  Suspended  License  conviction,  he  failed  to  pay  the
remaining $62 for that charge.8
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 3.n.): In July 2013, Applicant was charged with 1) Driving with
License Revoked, 2) Operating a Vehicle without Insurance, and 3) Expired Tag. He was

convicted and fined.9 He was granted a payment plan. His fines of $306 for the Revoked
License, $356 for the Insurance, and $206 for the Expired Tag remain unpaid.10
(SOR ¶¶ 2.a. and 3.n.): In October 2013, Applicant was charged with Contempt of
Court associated with his failures to pay his outstanding fines. In March 2014, after he
paid $35 in fees and court costs, the charge was nolle prossed.11
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d., 1.f., and 3.n.): In January 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  1)  Driving  with  License  Revoked,  2)  Failure/Refusal  to  Display  Insurance,  and
Expired Tag. He was convicted and fined.12 He was granted a payment plan. His $306
fine  for  Revoked  License,  $356  fine  for  Insurance,  and  his  $206  fine  for  Expired  Tag
remain unpaid.13 Applicant failed to self-report his arrest to his security manager of facility
security office.14
(SOR  ¶¶  2.b.  and  3.n.):  In  September  2014,  Applicant  was  again  charged  with
Contempt of Court associated with his failures to pay his outstanding fines. In November
2014, a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was eventually ordered to pay $303 in fees
and court costs, but that amount remains unpaid.15
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): In December 2015, a coworker brought a shocking pen into the work
area. Applicant took the device from the coworker and entered another work area where
he attempted to “prank” another employee. Human Resources determined that Applicant
had conspired to be untruthful in an interview when he was questioned about his level of
involvement  in  the  incident.  Applicant  was  subsequently  issued  a  written  warning  for
failure  to  comply  with  the  company’s  guidelines  for  professional  conduct.16  Applicant
denied both the allegation and taking the device into the work area, claiming the incident
was incorrectly reported.17

without a driver’s license, when he is unable to obtain transportation to and from work

with a coworker, to avoid being fired from his job,  Applicant admitted that he takes the
risk and has continued to drive unlawfully since his 2014 arrest.18
Financial Considerations19
Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to several factors: he is a single father;
he and his children reside with Applicant’s grandmother – the individual who raised him
– in her house; his girlfriend refused to allow him to get a tag for the vehicle in her name
for which he had cosigned; and in 2012, his girlfriend left him and the children. Although
not cited by him as a contributing factor to his financial problems, three or four years ago,
for Christmas, Applicant purchased an unspecified number of all-terrain-vehicles (ATVs)
for his children, each costing $5,000 to $6,000.20 For reasons not explained other than
experiencing “rough times,” in addition to the traffic fines and fees that remain unpaid,
other accounts became delinquent.
The SOR, as amended, identified 21 purportedly delinquent accounts, including
unpaid court fines and fees, which had been placed for collection, charged off, or filed as
judgments,  as  generally  reflected  by  Applicant’s  December  2010,  June  2016,  or
September  2018  credit  reports.  Those  debts  total  approximately  $48,677.  The  current
status of the non-court fines and fees accounts is as follows:
There  are  six  delinquent  accounts  that  were  placed  for  collection  and  filed  as
judgments that were eventually partially or fully satisfied by garnishments: $5,028 (SOR
¶¶ 3.c. and 3.l.); $1,048 (SOR ¶ 3.d.); $1,400 (SOR ¶¶ 3.e. and 3.m.); $1,025 (SOR ¶
3.f.); $5,064 (SOR ¶¶ 3.g. and 3.i.); and $1,149 (SOR ¶ 3.h.).21 There has been no change
in  the  status of  a  vast  majority  of  Applicant’s  accounts  that  were  placed for collection,
most of which were charged off with unpaid balances: $4,787 (SOR ¶ 3.a.); $374 (SOR
¶ 3.b.); $2,167 (SOR ¶ 3.o.); $1,385 (SOR ¶ 3.p.); $2,088 (SOR ¶ 3.q.); $9,073 (SOR ¶
3.r.); $6,154 (SOR ¶ 3.s.); $418 (SOR ¶ 3.t.); $175 (SOR ¶ 3.u.); and $714 (SOR ¶ 3.v.).22

Applicant claimed he made some payments to creditors, and he contended that in
March 2018 he engaged the professional services of a debt relief organization to resolve
his  delinquent  accounts,  and  that  he  pays  that  organization  $400  per  month  for  their
services.23 Although Applicant stated an intention to submit documentation regarding his
relationship  with  the  debt  relief  company;  the  status  of  all  of  his  delinquent  accounts;
payment plans established with his creditors; and payments made to creditors by himself
or in his behalf, no such documentation was submitted.
Applicant  submitted  a  Personal  Financial  Statement  to  reflect  his  monthly  net
income; monthly expenses; and a monthly remainder available for discretionary saving or
spending. He reported that his monthly net salary was about $2,731.80, and his monthly
expenses,  including  $500  child  support,  and  $600 for debt  relief and  credit  cards,  was
$2,450.24  That  leaves  him  approximately  $282  per  month  available  for  discretionary
saving or spending. There is no evidence of financial counseling.

"Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  configuration  manager  employed  by  a  U.S.  defense
contractor  since  October  2013.  She  has  served  previously  in  similar  positions  with  a
series of defense contractors since May 1992. She has had small gaps in employment
as  her  currently employer lost  its  bid  on  the  renewal  contract,  only to  have herself  be
hired by the successor contractor. The longest such gap was from December 2005 to
June 2006. She seeks to retain the clearance she was issued in July 2007 (Item 5, 6).
The  SOR  alleges,  and  Government  exhibits  (Items  6-8)  establish,12  delinquent
debts totaling nearly $12,000, and a May 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition which was
discharged in June 2005. Applicant admitted some debts, and the bankruptcy; claimed
that  some  debts  had  been  included  in  her  bankruptcy;  and  claimed  to  have  been
unaware  of  some  other  debts.  She  listed  no  delinquent  debts  on  her  December  2014
clearance  application  (Item  5),  but  was  confronted  with  them  during  an  April  2015
interview with a Government investigator (Item 6) based on a January 2015 credit report
(Item 7). She similarly failed to disclose a handful of criminal arrests/citations (SOR 2.a-
2.f), but was confronted with them during her interview.3
Applicant documented no efforts to address her debts, either after her interview or
after she received the SOR. She attributed her 2005 bankruptcy filing to her August 1997
divorce, but it is difficult to see this as anything but attenuated. She provided no budget
or financial statement. She has not documented any financial or credit counseling. She
provided no work or character references, or any evidence of community involvement.

"Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, except SOR 3.a and paragraph 4. He is
a 37-year-old enterprise director engineer employed by a U.S. defense contractor since
August  2017.   He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  military  from  June  2000  to  July  2009,
and  in  a  reserve  component  from  August  2009  to  March  2011.  He  had  a  favorable
background  investigation,  with  clearance  issued,  in  September  2009  (GE  2),  and  a
favorable reinvestigation in early 2011 (GE 1). This investigation appears to be due to a
break in service requiring reinvestigation.
In July 1999, and again in November 2010, Applicant was arrested for soliciting
prostitution in undercover operations. He was found guilty of disturbing the peace, and
given minimal sentences involving fines, school attendance, and community service, all
of  which  he  successfully  completed.  His  attorneys  told  him  that  the  charges  would
eventually  be  dismissed.  Applicant  attributed  these  arrests  to  his  experiencing
particularly  stressful  times  in his  life.  In  July 1999,  he  was  avoiding going home  to  an
abusive relationship with his father (Tr. 22). In November 2010, he was going through a
contentious  separation—and  ultimately  divorce—with  his  wife,  as  well  as  trying  to  get
ready to go to college (Tr. 23).
Applicant did not disclose the November 2010 arrest on either his January 2011
(GE 2) or November 2013 (GE 1) clearance applications. He also failed to disclose six
delinquent  debts  on  his  November  2013  clearance  application.  He  admits  the
omissions, but denies any intent to mislead the Government. In each instance, he was
being  pressed  by  his  employer  to  complete  the  applications  quickly  because  of
operational requirements overseas (Tr. 29).
The  SOR  also  alleges,  Government  exhibits  substantiate,  but  Applicant  denies
ten  delinquent  debts  totaling  over  $24,000.  Record  evidence  shows  that  SOR  1.j  is  a
duplicate  of  SOR  1.a,   so  there  are  nine  debts  totaling  nearly  $21,000  at  issue  The
debts comprise a delinquent utility bill (SOR 1.d), two delinquent medical bills (SOR 1.f,
1.g), and six delinquent education loans (SOR 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.h-1.I) .
Applicant  offered  a  number  of  exhibits  to  demonstrate  that  all  the  SOR-alleged
debts  had  been  satisfied,  some  more  efficacious  than  others.  AE  F  shows  that  SOR
This is a different contractor than originally sponsored his November 2013 clearance application.
The account number for SOR 1.j listed in GE 7 matches the account number for SOR 1.a listed in GE 6 in
pertinent part, sufficient to conclude the accounts are the same.
debt 1.d was paid in full in March 2017.  AE G and H show that SOR debts 1.f and 1.g,
respectively,  were  canceled  and  returned  to  the  creditor  with  zero  balances  in
November 2017.  Although these  three debts were not addressed until after Applicant
received the SOR, the amounts involved are minimal, and the security concerns raised
de minimus
However,  the  remaining  education  loans  are  not  so  easily  resolved. AE
D—March 2017 correspondence from the collection agent for the SOR 4.a creditor on
behalf of one of the colleges Applicant attended—reflects that a $4,631.22 balance was
settled  for  an  unspecified  amount.  However,  none  of  the  account  numbers  or  other
identifying  numbers listed in the correspondence match the account numbers listed in
GE 6 or 7, although the delinquent amounts in GE 6 and AE D are similar. Similarly, AE
E  reflects  that  two  defaulted  loans  held  by  the  SOR 4.b and  4.c  creditor were  paid in
March 2017, but contains no identifying numbers (account numbers or balances paid) to
match AE E to the 4.b and 4.c numbers listed in GE 6. Applicant asserts (Tr. 36) that AE
C shows that the education loans at SOR 1.h and 1.I have also been paid as of March
2017. But again, neither account numbers or balances appear to confirm that claim.
Federally  guaranteed  student  loans  are  difficult  to  track  through  credit  reports
because  of  the  way  the  loans  are  issued,  defaulted,  consolidated,  and  rehabilitated,
seldom with the same account numbers attached to the accounts. Education programs
change  names,  further  complicating  deciphering  the  process.  Ultimately,  all  the  loans
are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). However, there are direct
student loans (made by the DOE) and indirect student loans (made by private lenders
through  DOE  programs).  A  given  loan  may  have  multiple  parties  involved  in  its
management, any or all of whom may report its status to the credit bureaus. Thus, for
example,  Applicant’s  January  2014  credit  report  contains  multiple  entries  from  the
lender  at  SOR  1.e  (and  its  education  loan  arm)  in  current  status  because  the  loans
chronicled were in deferred status at the time and transferred to another holder. It also
shows an account moving into late payment status, and being transferred to the DOE,
where it was ultimately paid. A further example, AE C, is a compendium of documents
purporting to show Applicant’s loan settlement with DOE. Nevertheless, the connection
is  difficult  to  make.   The  documents  show,  without  account  numbers,  six  loans
SOR  debt  1.d—a  utility  bill  incurred  when  a  final  bill  was  not  forwarded  after  Applicant  moved  from  a
residence and closed the account—appears on Applicant’s January 2014 credit report (GE 7) and was first
reported delinquent in March 2013. The reported account numbers on GE 7 and AE F match.
Again, the debts originally appear in GE 7, and the account numbers in GE 7 match the account numbers
in AE G and H.
The first page of the exhibit is the first page of a 3 March 2017 letter from the DOE, regarding an account
number that appears nowhere else in the record, whereby DOE accepts a $9,250 payment as settlement in
full of “defaulted student loan(s) and/or grant overpayment(s).” The next two pages are a 22 July 2014 letter
from the then collection agent for DOE, referencing the same account number, offering to settle Applicant’s
defaulted loans for that amount. The fourth page is a screen shot of an otherwise-unidentified “Federal Student
Aid” web page, which reflects six disbursed loans totaling $18,239 and six disbursed grants totaling $17,097,
as of 19 December 2016. The next 11 pages consist of a National Student Loan Data System printout with
guaranteed  by  DOE,  two  direct,   four  indirect.  The  four  indirect  loans  were  all  to  the
educational  institution  in  AE  A  (which  shows  all  school  charges  paid).  All  four  indirect
loans were made by the same bank alleged as one of the creditors on SOR debt 1.e,
and guaranteed by the same “Guaranty Agency” as the creditor on SOR debts 1.b and
1.c.  The  first two  indirect  loans  totaled  $4,168,  were  serviced  by the  other  creditor  on
SOR debt 1.e, and were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 1 March 2017.  The
last two indirect loans totaled $5,334, but serviced by a creditor not alleged on the SOR,
and were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 1 and 2 May 2014 [AE C, K(1)].
Applicant’s  January  2014  credit  report  (GE  7)  shows  SOR  debts  4.e-4.j,  as
alleged,  encompassing  the  education  loans,  with  complete  account  numbers,  at  SOR
4.e  and  4.h-4,j,  with  4.j  being  a  duplicate  of  SOR  4.a,  which  appears  on  Applicant’s
September  2016  credit  report  (GE  6),  with  account  number  as  alleged,  along  with
education  loans  4.b  and  4.c  (account  numbers  as  alleged),  as  well  as  SOR  debt  4.d.
SOR debt 4.e also appears on GE 6 (with an account number matching GE 7) with the
same lender as alleged in the SOR, but a different servicing agent.
Applicant  attributed  his  education  loan  problems  to  his  not  understanding  the
interplay  between  the  school  payments  being  made  through  the  military  tuition
assistance  program,  his  grants,  and  his  education  loans.  He  stated  that  he  did  not
understand that the military tuition assistance did not cover all his education expenses
(Tr.  31-33).  However,  he  acknowledges  getting  dunning  letters  from  the  creditors  at
SOR 1.a-1.c and 1.h-1.I beginning in 2011 (Tr. 31, 36, 51-52). He thought the creditors
did  not  adequately  explain  where  his  military  tuition  assistance  payments  went.  His
credit  reports  (GE  6,  7)  show  that  he  disputed  these  education  loans  with  the  credit
bureaus,  but  no  changes  were  made.  Further,  he  produced  little  in  the  way  of
documentation  showing  his  efforts  to  resolve  the  loans  before  he  received  the  SOR.
Nevertheless,  when  he  received  the  SOR,  he  renewed  his  efforts  to  resolve  his
education loans (Tr. 35, 53-54).
Applicant  documented  no  credit  or  financial  counseling,  and  did  not  submit  a
budget.  He stated  he  had  $8,181  positive  bi-monthly cash  flow  (Tr.  58).  His work  and
character  references  (GE  I,  Answer)  consider  him  honest  and  trustworthy  and
recommend him for his clearance. However, none of them states any knowledge of the
SOR issues.
the detailed, but not necessarily decipherable, status of Applicant’s loans and grants. The grants are not at
issue in the SOR, so I have given no consideration to those entries.
The two direct loans total $8,737, were being serviced directly by the DOE Debt Management and Collections
System (not the creditor alleged at SOR 4.a), and were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 23 July
2014. The two direct loans  were for the educational institution  in  AE  B, which shows that all Applicant’s
charges at the school have been paid.
AE K(2) shows that on 15 November 2015 the loan balances totaled $5,706.14.
",True
"The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  J  (SOR  ¶  1.a-1.b)  and  cross  alleges  under
Guideline E (SOR ¶ 2.d) and Guideline D (SOR ¶ 3.a) that Applicant was arrested on
February 23, 2013, on three counts of rape of a child and one count of witness intimidation
and that he was indicted on May 29, 2013, on four counts of aggravated rape of a child, six
counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under age 14, one count of assault and
battery with intent to rape, and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous
weapon. Under Guideline E, Applicant is also alleged to have failed to timely report his
arrest to his facility security officer (FSO) (SOR ¶ 2.a) and to have lied on his May 7, 2015
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) (SOR ¶ 2.b) and during his July 12,
2015 subject interview with a government investigator (SOR ¶ 2.c) by stating that he was
falsely accused of the criminal conduct allegations.
After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I find that Applicant’s arrest
in SOR ¶ 1.a is related to the charges in SOR ¶ 1.b and does not represent an allegation of
additional criminal conduct. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is a 40-year-old senior test engineer with a bachelor’s degree in electrical
engineering awarded in May 2005. He has worked for his current employer, a defense
contractor, since May 2004, and was granted a DOD secret clearance in June 2005. His
security clearance eligibility was suspended in February 2013 after he was arrested on
rape charges. (GE 1; AEs D-E; Tr. 23-24.)
Applicant and his now ex-wife married in July 2006, when their daughter was age 2
and her daughter from a previous relationship was about to turn age 6. They had a son in
March 2008. Applicant and his ex-wife separated permanently in late February 2013 after
his arrest on charges of raping his stepdaughter. (GE 1.) His ex-wife filed for divorce in
2013, and their divorce was final in January 2017.1 (GE 2.)
On February 28, 2013, Applicant’s stepdaughter, then 12-years-old, told her mother
that Applicant had sexually assaulted her on eight to ten occasions in their home, to as
recently as only five days prior. She described incidents of sexual penetration (rape) and
threats  from  Applicant  to  beat  her  with  a  belt  if  she  told  anyone  about  the  assaults.
Applicant’s now ex-wife called the police, who, on responding, noticed that Applicant’s
stepdaughter  appeared  visibly  upset.  Applicant’s  stepdaughter  reportedly  had  red  and
swollen eyes from crying, a flushed face, and hunched posture so that she appeared to be
hunched in on herself. The police did not interview the girl at that time, but they obtained
an account from Applicant’s ex-wife of what her daughter had told her about the assaults.
Applicant’s ex-wife told the police that her daughter has a close relationship with Applicant,
whom she regarded as her father. The police arrested Applicant for rape of a child with
force and with intimidation of a witness for an offense that allegedly occurred on February
23,  2013,  and  for  two  counts  of  rape  of  a  child  with  force  for  offenses  that  reportedly
occurred between July 1, 2012, and February 23, 2013. Applicant’s ex-wife obtained an
emergency restraining order against him, and a report was filed with the Department of
Children and Families (DCF). (GE 5.) Applicant was in custody for a week after his arrest.
(Tr. 26.)
Available  police  records  show  that  the police interviewed a friend of Applicant’s
stepdaughter, who had been identified as one of the first people she had told about the
sexual  assaults.  According  to  this  friend,  who  was  then  13  years  old  and  a  close
classmate, Applicant’s stepdaughter related to her that she had been abused by Applicant
for a while, and she feared for her half-sister’s safety. Applicant’s stepdaughter was crying,
shaking, and speaking with a voice that was cracking when she told the friend about the
assaults. (GE 5.)
On May 29, 2013, a grand jury indicted Applicant on twelve felony counts for crimes
allegedly committed by him on his stepdaughter on diverse dates between July 20, 2009,
and  February  2013,  to  wit:  aggravated  rape  of  a  child  (four  counts);  assault  with  a
dangerous weapon (a belt) (one count); indecent assault and battery on a child under age
14  (six  counts);  and  assault  to  rape  a  child  (one  count).  (GE  4.)  On  June  19,  2013,
Applicant advised his security office at work that he had been arrested and charged with
three counts of forcible rape on a child and “witness/juror/police/court office intimidation on
February 28, 2013.2 The security office issued an adverse incident report to DOHA on June
1 Applicant testified at his hearing that his ex-wife filed for divorce in 2014, about a year after he was accused
of raping his stepdaughter. (Tr. 35.) However, he indicated during his subject interview in July 2016 that his ex-
wife filed shortly after his arrest. (GE 2.)
2 Applicant testified discrepantly at this hearing that there was a delay of “a couple of months” in him reporting
his arrest. (Tr. 27-28, 46.)
19, 2013, of Applicant’s arrest, stating in part: “[Applicant] failed to report the exact charges
to security and also admitted to ‘being scared’ as a reason for not reporting it sooner.” (GE
3.) Applicant testified at his February 2019 security clearance hearing that he reported his
arrests to his supervisor, who walked him to their security office. (Tr. 47.) When asked why
he  delayed  reporting  his  arrest  to  his  security  officials,  Applicant  denied  that  he  was
scared. He maintained that he was stressed, but primarily focused on taking care of his
family. (Tr. 27-28, 51.) He understood at the time that he was required to report his arrest
when it happened. (Tr. 46.)
Applicant entered pleas of not guilty to the 12 felony counts at his arraignment on
June 24, 2013. (GE 6.) On August 12, 2013, the state filed with the trial court a statement
of the case in which it summarized that Applicant abused the victim from when she was
nine years old; that the abuse progressed from fondling to rape; that Applicant threatened
to beat the victim with a belt if she told anyone; that he had beaten her with a belt in the
past; that the victim first disclosed the abuse to her friends from school; that  when the
victim told her mother about the abuse, her  mother called the police immediately; that
Applicant was arrested in the family home that evening; that Applicant declined to make a
statement to the police; and that a grand jury indictment was returned against Applicant on
12 counts on May 29, 2013. (GE 5.)
The attorney who represented Applicant during protracted proceedings in Superior
Court  attests  that  the  prosecutor  offered  plea  bargains,  which  included  a  reduction  in
confinement for Applicant and disposition of some allegations in return for a guilty plea.
Applicant gave him clear instructions to reject any offers and prepare for trial. According to
the attorney, there was no scientific evidence linking Applicant to the crimes. (AE F.) A jury
trial was scheduled and then rescheduled several times to March 2, 2015. On February 26,
2015, the state moved for a nolle prosequi on all of the charges at that time. After meeting
with the victim several times for the purposes of trial preparation, the state did not believe it
could meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. In addition, the state did
not believe it was in the victim’s best interest to proceed at that time. (GE 5.) On March 3,
2015, the state filed statements of nolle prosequi as to each of the 12 counts. (GE 6; AE
A.)
On  May  7,  2015,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86).  In  response  to  police  record
inquiries, Applicant listed only two charges, of sexual abuse and domestic violence, and
stated:
On February 28, 2013, I was FALSELY accused of sexual abuse against my
stepchild. Due to this, a restraining order was obtained by my wife. After an
intensive investigation, on March 3, 2015, the [state name] declared a Nolle
Prosequi due to NO evidence and inconsistent stories by the accuser.
Applicant  responded  affirmatively  to  whether  there  was  currently  a  domestic
violence protective order or restraining order against him. He explained that a restraining
order was issued against him on February 28, 2013, after he had been “FALSELY accused
of  sexual  abuse  against  [his]  stepchild.”  He  added  that  his  wife  obtained  a  temporary
restraining order against him to prevent him from seeing his children, but on May 19, 2015,
the family court will grant him visitation times and joint custody of his children. Applicant
answered  “Yes”  to  whether  his  security  clearance  eligibility  had  ever  been  denied,
suspended, or revoked and disclosed that the DOD suspended his Secret clearance in
approximately August 2014 pending resolution of the criminal sexual assault charges. (GE
1.)
On July 12, 2016, Applicant was interviewed at work by an authorized investigator
for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  He explained that he and his spouse
separated because of the February 2013 allegations made against him, and that she filed
for divorce shortly after the allegations were made. He expected their divorce to be final on
July 20, 2016; that he would be required to pay $370 per week in child support for his two
children;3 and that  he will have unsupervised visitation with his children on Tuesdays and
Sundays. About the February 2013 criminal allegations, Applicant explained that the police
came to his house about 30 minutes after he had returned home from work; that he was
placed under arrest on alleged sexual abuse charges; that he had declined to provide a
statement to the police without an attorney present; that he was jailed for a few days until
his sister posted $50,000 bail for him; and that he was required to wear a GPS monitor and
stay away from his marital residence as a condition of his bail. He indicated that in May
2013, he found out that he was being indicted on five counts of sexual assault and one
count of intimidation of a witness. He was required to report to a probation officer once a
week  from  May  2013  to  March  2015.  Applicant  explained  that  the  charges  were  nolle
prosequi without ever going to trial because there was not enough evidence to prosecute
him. He stated that despite the “dismissal” of the charges in March 2015, the restraining
order against him was not removed until December 2015. (GE 2; AE C.)
After being reminded by the OPM investigator that he was under oath and under the
penalties for intentional misrepresentation or false statements set forth in Section 1001 of
Title  18  of  the  United  States  Code,  Applicant  denied  ever  touching  his  children
inappropriately and indicated that the allegations against him were false. He stated that he
was  unsure  why  his  stepdaughter  would  fabricate  these  allegations  against  him,  and
asserted  that  there  was  no  truth  to  them.  He  added  that  people  who  know  him  are
surprised by the allegations, and that the only person who disbelieves Applicant is his
spouse. He could provide no reason why his wife sided with his stepdaughter other than
that  the  girl  is  her  daughter.  When  asked  about  his  delay  in  reporting  his  arrest,  he
indicated that he was trying to get his personal life in order, which was more important to
him at that time. He denied the delay was because he feared he might lose his job. He
denied that his arrest or the February 2013 allegations could be used against him because
nothing happened. (GE 2; AE C.)
In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on January 29, 2018, that
although he and his ex-wife were officially divorced in January 2017, they “have a healthy
co-parenting and thoughtful parenting plan to ensure that [their] children have a happy,
3 On September 18, 2015, an adverse incident report was filed by Applicant’s employer noting that Applicant’s
wages were garnished in August 2015 for child support of almost $2,015. (GE 3.)
healthy, stable, and balance[d] life.” (GE 2.) At his hearing held in February 2019, Applicant
indicated that he has unsupervised contact with his two children three days a week. (Tr.
25.) He provided a “biography” (AE E) in which he stated in part:
Unfortunately, due to false allegations, our family had to struggle through
tough times. Now, even though we are divorced, we are closer than ever and
we are successfully co-parenting our children. We are working together for a
brighter future for all of us.
Applicant denies any truth to any of the sexual assault crimes alleged against him by
his stepdaughter or any tampering with a witness. (Tr. 29-33.) He had no explanation for
why  his  ex-wife  filed  for  divorce,  although  he  assumed  it  was  “based  on  the  false
allegations.” Applicant claims he had an “excellent” relationship with his ex-wife at the time,
and he does not know why his ex-wife believes that he raped her daughter. (Tr. 36, 50.)
Applicant acknowledged that he has no visitation rights to see his stepdaughter, with whom
he claimed he had a wonderful relationship before she accused him of the crimes. He
could provide no reason why his stepdaughter would falsely accuse him. (Tr. 50-52.)
Applicant  presented  no  statements  from  his ex-wife,  other family  members, co-
workers,  or friends.  He provided his annual performance evaluations for 2009 through
2017,  which  detail  his  contributions  to  his  defense-contractor  employer.  Applicant  has
consistently met, and since 2012 exceeded, his work requirements while needing minimal
supervision.  Detailed-oriented  and  a  team  player,  Applicant  has  displayed  a  positive
attitude and extreme flexibility in fulfilling work assignments. He has worked extra hours,
including on weekends, to support program schedules. Applicant delivered “superior results
in 2015.” In 2016, he supported a very active test area. He was considered to be a valuable
asset to the test engineering organization. By 2017, he had become the “go to guy” and a
subject matter expert as it related to high power testing. He was given an overall rating of
“Highly Effective Contribution” for 2017. (AE B.)

"Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  graduate  of  one  of  the  U.S.  military  academies.  He
honorably  served  in  the  U.S.  military  for  approximately  27  years.  He  is  presently  a
senior account manager. In about 2003, he married a woman with six biological children
from a previous marriage, including three stepdaughters who were then aged 9, 7, and
4. The couple has since added two children of their own.
The eldest of Applicant’s wife’s daughters had a strong bond with her biological
father  and,  starting  early  on,  a  strained  relationship  with  Applicant.  Although  Applicant
did  not  start  a  romance  with  the  mother  until  after  the  mother  had  divorced  her  first
husband, the girl blamed Applicant for the failure of her parents’ marriage. (Tr. 60) She
also did not like that Applicant was a disciplinarian. (Tr. 57). Meanwhile, she was having
difficult times fitting in with the other girls at church and at school, and was often bullied.
(Tr. 59) The child also had the stress or adjusting to Type 1 diabetes, and  trauma that
was the result of a life-threatening car accident a couple of years earlier. (Tr. 59-60) She
was  known  to  suffer  from  depression.  (Tr.  62)  She  wanted  to  go  back  to  her  former
state and life with her natural father.
At  age  14,  amidst  all  these  problems,  this  eldest  daughter  was  sleeping  on  the
ground in a basement bedroom one night. (Tr. 59) She was positioned on the floor next
to her sleeping sister’s bed. Applicant entered to look in on the children. In reaching out
to  assure  she  was  well-covered  and  tucked  in,  his  hand  made  contact  with  her
backside, feeling to her “like a grab over her clothing.” (Tr. 55, 58, 64) The next day, the
girl was brought home from school for being distraught. The girl “blew up” at Applicant,
but did not accuse him of anything. A day later, the mother read a passage in the girl’s
journal mentioning  the  touch.  “By  then,  [the  girl  had]  decided  to  move  [across  country
with her biological father].” (Tr 56) Over time, the daughter’s story has changed multiple
times. (see, e.g., Exs. G10-G13; Ex. 3 at 12-13) She later acknowledged that the touch
“wasn’t a sexual thing.” (Tr. 58)
In 2011, the girl subsequently chose to live with Applicant during college despite
the availability of GI Bill benefits that could have paid for her housing elsewhere. (Tr. 61)
No formal steps regarding this girl’s allegation were ever pursued or instituted. (Tr. 71)
At a recent family funeral, this oldest child “came up, gave [him] a hug . . . even before,
she was not much into that, but she came up and gave [him] a hug.” (Tr. 73) They were
also last known to be exchanging Facebook posts and emails. (Tr. 73)
In  2011,  the  middle  child  of  Applicant’s  three  stepdaughters  traveled  cross
country to stay with her biological father for part of the summer. The girl enjoyed life with
her biological father in a markedly different region, where her now-adult elder sister had
lived since 2009 and where this girl had spent her early years. Also residing in the area
was an aunt and a cousin, who was the girl’s best friend. The aunt had never approved
of Applicant, resented his taking his wife and his wife’s children away from her and the
biological father, and “eventually was convinced to help [the biological father] to get his
children back under his complete care. . . .” (Ex. 9)
The middle girl initially delayed her relocation by not coming home at summer’s
end.  Then,  the  girl  and  the  aunt  disclosed  that  the  child  had  “suppressed  memories”
indicating Applicant had molested her. She told this to her biological father, who was not
on  good  terms  with  Applicant.  (Tr.  54)  It  is  unknown  whether  this  middle  child  had
actually  read  her  elder  sister’s  journal  or  simply  knew  the  circumstances  of  her
departure from Applicant’s home three years earlier. (Tr. 68-69)
There  was  subsequent  concern  about  the  middle  child  returning  to  live  with
Applicant. The girl’s biological father reported his daughter’s “suppressed memories” to
the  local  police.  This  stepdaughter  later  detailed  to  county  sheriff  officials  instances
where Applicant supposedly touched her breasts and genitals in a  manner “essentially
very  strikingly  familiar  to  [her  elder  sister’s]  allegation  from  2009,”  wherein  Applicant
was  to  have  touched  the  sleeping  girl  after moving  her blanket,  then  tucked  her  in  for
the  night.  (Tr.  66)  She  also  suggested  that  her  younger  sister  had  been  similarly
abused. (see, e.g., Ex. 3 at 6; Ex. G(18))
After  an  investigation  and  review,  no  action  was  taken  by  the  police,  but  this
middle child remained with her biological father for the rest of her high school education.
There, “she joined the same choir group, she . . . went to work at the same pizza place,
she did almost everything step by step that [her elder sister] did when she moved. . . .”
(Tr. 67, 69-70) Last seen a year ago, this stepdaughter and Applicant were on speaking
terms during a family visit. (Tr. 73)
The  youngest  stepdaughter  does  not  believe  her  sisters’  versions  of  the  facts
concerning the Applicant. She has consistently defended Applicant since at least 2012.
(Exs. 7-9) She describes him as a committed member of their church, patriotic, patient,
even-tempered,  and  a  loving  father  who  “provides  just  punishments.”  (Ex.  9)  She
describes Applicant and her mother as “loving parents.” (Exs. 7-9) She does not believe
her elder sister’s story, noting that this sibling “would have reacted sooner” if the alleged
incident  had  really  occurred.  (Ex.  G8)  She  noted  that  this  sibling  originally  questioned
whether the incident had ever really happened. (Ex. G8)
The  youngest  stepdaughter  also  noted  that  the  elder  sibling  told  at  least  two
versions  of  what  happened:  “in  one,  my  dear  mother  walked  in;  in  the  other,  I  told
[mother  of  the  incident  along]  with  [my  elder  sister].  Two  stories  hints  that  this  is  a
falsehood.” (Ex. G8; see also Tr. 81-82) As for the former version, she noted “the very
idea  that  my  mother  would  stand  by  and  watch  her  children  be  practically  raped  is
complete rubbish.” (Ex. G8) The elder sister had confided to the youngest girl that she
had actually  wanted to  go  to  be  with  their father because  “she  was  lonely  and  did  not
enjoy  life  in  [their  state],  especially  because  she  left  many  friends  behind  when  [they]
moved . . . . The change was too drastic for her. She also in her diary has written how
she hates flying back and forth every school break; how she wished she had a normal
life  in  a  permanent  home.  I  know  she  didn’t  go  to  [their  biological  father]  for  a  safe
haven.”  (Ex.  G8)  In  the  alternative,  the  youngest  girl  suggests  that,  given  her  eldest
sister’s  track  record  of  having  bad  dreams,  that  such  a  dream  could  have  also  been
used as a basis for manipulation by her cousin or aunt. (Ex. G9)
The  youngest  child  also  related  that  Applicant  often  tucked  the  children  in.
However, after the allegation waged by the elder stepdaughter, he stopped. (Ex.G 8; Tr.
73)  Overall,  she  noted  that  Applicant  always  tried  to  avoid  being  “creepy”  or  an  “evil
stepparent.” (Ex.  G9) This  stepdaughter also  reported  that  the aunt  “often  tried  to  tear
apart [my] family and others. She would tell the kids to lie to the school or officials about
our  parents  [Applicant  and  his  wife].  .  .  .  She  may  hate  my  parents.”  (Ex.  G9)  This
stepdaughter’s support of Applicant is corroborated by her mother, Applicant’s wife. (Ex.
G15)  Today,  the  three  stepdaughters  are  all  adults  living  independently  apart  from
Applicant.
Regarding the incidents allegedly involving the oldest and middle stepdaughters,
a  report  from  military  legal/social  services  was  deemed  in  favor  of  Applicant,  with  the
favorable  testimony  of  the  oldest  and  youngest  girls  found  to  be  substantiated.  There
was  no  referral  to  the  sheriff  or  for  criminal  proceedings.  Although  not  introduced  into
evidence, other documentation reflects that a family advocacy study adopted the stories
by  the  oldest  and  the  middle  girl  and  found  against  Applicant,  finding  their  tales
substantiated.  There  is  no  documentary  evidence  reflecting  a  recommendation  on
criminal  action  was  issued,  although  it  was  noted  that  the  youngest  girl  remained
contentedly in the care of Applicant. The unfavorable conclusion of the family advocacy
program was the basis for the pending allegation in this matter.
",True
"In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.r and 4.b, and she denied
the  other  SOR  allegations.  She  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.
Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is 42 years old, and a DOD contractor employs her as a management
specialist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 29, 88, 90) She served in the Army from 1996 to 2000, and
she received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 89-90) In 2006, she received an associate’s
degree. (GE 1)
In 1999, Applicant married, and in September 2016, her divorce was final. (Tr. 89)
Her three children are teenagers. (Tr. 89) In August 2014, Applicant filed for divorce. (Tr.
50, 57) She paid “well over $30,000” to her divorce attorney. (Tr. 51) She received security
training in 2012. (AE SR R)
Financial Considerations
While  Applicant  was  deployed  to  Afghanistan,  she  believed  her  husband  was
paying the family bills, and she was unaware of the delinquent SOR debts. (Tr. 52) After
she learned of her delinquent debts, she reduced her expenses, especially her rent. (Tr.
53) She cashed in her 401(k) account to pay her debts. (Tr. 54) She paid all of the SOR
debts; however, she noted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for $1,438 is still listed as delinquent on
her current credit report. (Tr. 16, 37, 55) The status and disposition of the debts alleged
on the SOR are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $1,438. On June 7, 2018, Applicant paid
the creditor $1,000, and the debt was settled. (AE B; AE SR S) However, on September
1, 2018, Applicant emailed that her credit report had not been updated to reflect resolution
of this debt. (SOR response) I have credited her with resolving this debt.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.h, and 1.l allege telecommunications debts placed for collection for
$783, $173, and $783. On May 16, 2018, Applicant paid the SOR ¶ 1.b creditor $783.
(AE C at 1; AE SR D) On May 14, 2018, Applicant paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h. (AE SR N;
AE C at 26) The accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.l reflect the same debt. (SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a charged-off debt for $599. On May 18, 2018, the creditor wrote
Applicant’s debt was paid in full as of January 13, 2016. (AE C at 23-24)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges an account placed for collection for $588. On May 24, 2018, the
creditor wrote that the debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE C at 13)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q allege six delinquent medical debts for $572,
$360, $92, $1,572, $165, and $165. SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q do not allege
specific creditors seeking payment of the medical debts. On May 14, 2018, Applicant paid
a medical collection debt of unspecified amount. (AE SR O; AE C at 12) On May 15, 2018,
Applicant  paid  the  creditor  in  SOR  ¶  1.j  $1,572.  (AE  C  at  7)  The  creditor  provided  an
undated letter stating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.q were paid by insurance. (AE SR
P; AE SR H; AE C at 25) On May 15, 2018, Applicant received an email indicating her 12
medical debts for $1,589, $595, $1,633, $91, $100, $3,145, $339, $83, $190, $190, $85,
and $24, were being paid in full. (AE C at 29-43)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a debt placed for collection for $350. On September 1, 2018,
Applicant indicated in an email that the creditor had closed the account and would not
accept payment. (SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges an account placed for collection for $1,255. On May 14, 2018,
Applicant paid $1,255 to the creditor. (AE C at 28; AE SR C)
SOR ¶ 1.m alleges an account placed for collection for $539. On May 24, 2018,
the creditor wrote that Applicant’s debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero.
(AE C at 10)
SOR ¶ 1.n alleges a charged-off debt for $486. On May 24, 2018, the creditor wrote
Applicant’s account was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE SR J)
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges an account placed for collection for $468. On May 24, 2018, the
creditor wrote that Applicant’s debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE C
at 8)
SOR ¶ 1.r alleges Applicant’s pay was garnished to address a student loan debt
for $8,777. On May 15, 2018, a student loan creditor wrote a defaulted student loan of
unspecified  amount  was  paid  in  full  in  August  2012.  (AE  C  at  3)  On  June  7,  2018,
Applicant  paid a  student  loan for $2,505.  (AE  C at  6)  On  July  3,  2018,  a  student  loan
creditor  wrote  that five  student  loans of  $5,500, $3,387,  $2,750,  $208,  and  $758  were
paid in full. (AE C at 15-22) On January 7, 2019, three student loans for $3,353, $7,326,
and $5,500 were paid in full. (AE C at 4-5)
Applicant did not include her income of about $5,000 from customers seeking her
time and other personal services on her 2016 federal income tax return. In ISCR Case
No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances
in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:
(a)  to  assess  an  applicant’s  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s
evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is
applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for  whole  person  analysis  under
Directive Section 6.3.
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-
0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd.
April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR
Case  No.  03-20327  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Oct.  26,  2006)).  I  limited  my  consideration  of
Applicant’s admission that she did not declare income from her customers in violation of
the Internal Revenue Code to the five purposes listed above.
Criminal Conduct, Sexual Behavior, and Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  3.a,  and  4.a  allege  that  Applicant  was  cited  in  March  2017  for
prostitution  and  operating  a  business  without  a  city  license.  SOR  ¶  4.b  alleges  and
Applicant admitted that she failed to timely report this citation to her security officer. (SOR
response) Applicant did not report her arrest because her attorney told her not to do so
because “it would implicate [her] in a crime.” (Tr. 76)
In March 2017, the police arrested Applicant at her residence. (Tr. 71) Applicant
said she was not charged with operating a business without a license, and the prostitution
charge was dismissed because of lack of evidence that she engaged in prostitution. (Tr.
75;  SOR  response,  Order  Dismissing  Charge)  After  her  arrest,  she  stopped  seeking
customers on a dating website. (Tr. 78, 81) After her Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), she reported the arrest to her security officer. (Tr.
76-77) Applicant’s counsel indicated the prostitution charge was a municipal violation and
not a violation of state law. (Tr. 16-17) In Applicant’s state of residence, prostitution is a
class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $500.
Under  the  statute  in  Applicant’s  state,  §  567.020,  “A  person  commits  the  offense  of
prostitution if he or she engages in or offers or agrees to engage in sexual conduct with
another person in return for something of value to be received by any person.”
Applicant believed her husband called the police and alleged she was engaged in
prostitution. (Tr. 80; SR) Applicant criticized the credibility of a police officer involved in
the investigation of her prostitution charge. (Tr. 17-19) Her counsel cited a 2015 Eighth
Circuit  decision  that  named  the  police  officer  as  having  omitted  information  from  an
affidavit used to obtain a search warrant. (AE D) The magistrate noted information was
omitted; however, the magistrate concluded that  “the officer did not act intentionally or
recklessly to mislead the issuing judge.” (AE D at 2) The district court judge agreed with
the magistrate. (AE D at 2-3) The Eighth Circuit found the omissions were negligent but
otherwise  agreed  the  omissions  were  not  made  with  deliberate  falsity  or  reckless
disregard, and declined to suppress the product of the search. (AE D at 4, 6) Applicant
also provided a copy of a 2014 deposition of the same police officer relating to an alleged
stalking  incident  the  police  officer  investigated  in  2012.  (AE  D)  Applicant  asserted  the
police officer admitted in the deposition that he made a false statement in his investigation
of the stalking allegation. (Tr. 17-20) Applicant and her former husband were not involved
in the alleged stalking incident. (AE D)
Applicant’s  concerns  about  the  officer’s  credibility  have  low  relevance  because
Applicant  did  not  contest  most  of  the  material  facts  in  the  police  report.  The  only
information  Applicant  challenged  were  the  allegations,  as  summarized  by  the  police
officer,  of  the  two  witnesses  who  said  Applicant  provided  sex  to  them  in exchange for
their  payments  of  the  amounts  specified  on  Applicant’s  Internet  advertisement.  (SOR
Report) Written statements from the two witnesses were not included in the file. The two
witnesses were soldiers at a nearby military base, and Applicant’s counsel said he was
unable to locate them. Applicant’s admissions at her hearing, and the advertisement and
pictures from the website are sufficient to establish the allegation of prostitution under the
substantial evidence standard.
SOR ¶¶ 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, and 4.a allege Applicant engaged in sex with strangers that
she  met  on  websites,  including  a  dating  website  with  a  history  of  being  involved  with
prostitution. Her website posting indicated she charged $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for
60 minutes. At least one man that she met online paid her $80 following sex.
For about one year from 2016 to 2017, Applicant’s semi-nude photographs and
contact information were placed on a dating or escort website. (Tr. 60-63, 68-70; GE 5)
Her time was available for $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for 60 minutes. (Tr. 61-63) She
offered conversation, warmth, massage, dance, and  a special event to her customers.
(Tr.  61-62,  74)  In  April  2018,  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  issued  a  press  release
indicating the website Applicant was using to solicit customers was seized, as it was “the
dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently
advertised children and adults alike.” (Tr. 77; GE 9)
On  March  11,  2017,  the  police  stopped  a  vehicle  that  had  just  left  Applicant’s
residence. (GE 4) The driver was a soldier at a nearby military installation. The driver said
he had just paid Applicant $80 for sex. He said he also paid her $150 for sex on March 8,
2017. (OPM ROI at 17) The police went to Applicant’s residence and asked for the money
the witness paid her, and she provided four $20 bills. Id. Applicant told the police that she
was  not  engaging  in  prostitution.  The  police  interviewed  another  witness  who  was  a
soldier at a nearby military installation, and he said he paid for sex about four times at
Applicant’s residence. Id. (police report) Applicant’s lawyer said he was unable to locate
the two witnesses cited in the police report to challenge their credibility. (Tr. 45-46) When
Applicant  was  questioned  by  the  police,  she  “was  concerned  about  the  charge  of
prostitution as it would affect her security clearance.” (GE 4)
Applicant had difficulty estimating how many people paid her for her time; however,
she estimated “at least see[ing] 40 or more.” (Tr. 64-66) She estimated that she had sex
with about 20 men. (Tr. 66-67) She was vague about how many of them paid after having
sex with her. (Tr. 67-68) Some of the customers may have asked her for drugs; however,
she always refused to give them drugs. (Tr. 88) Applicant did not have anyone to protect
her if the date with her customers became violent. (Tr. 87)
Applicant consistently denied that she engaged in prostitution. (Tr. 43, 47-48) She
denied that there was a direct relationship between the payment of funds and the sexual
activity.  (Tr.  82;  SR;  GE  2)  The  purpose  of  the  semi-nudity  on  her  webpage  was  to
encourage  men  to  call  her  to  go  out  with  her.  (Tr.  70)  After  the  first  date,  some  men
continued their relationships with her and continued to pay her, and some did not pay her.
(Tr.  71,  82)  As  for  whether  she  was  soliciting  prostitution,  Applicant  explained,  in  an
advertisement a girl holding a soda may be wearing a bikini, “but that doesn’t mean she’s
a prostitute.” (Tr. 93) Applicant held a security clearance in the 2016 to 2017 time period
when her webpage advertised her time to customers. (Tr. 75)
Applicant’s  spouse  was  vindictive  towards  her  because  of  her  conduct.  Her
husband placed her pictures on a bad website to damage her reputation. (Tr. 38-42, 61;
SOR  response;  GE  5)  In  2016,  he  called  her  a  prostitute  at  a  basketball  game  their
children were attending. (Tr. 39-40) He threatened to seek her conviction and sentencing
to jail for prostitution. (Tr. 39) He sought an order barring her from seeing her children;
however, the judge denied his motion, and he had to pay her attorney fees. (Tr. 40) Her
husband encouraged the police to investigate Applicant for engaging in prostitution. (Tr.
41)
Applicant conceded that she “presented [herself] in the wrong manner as far as
that  [she]  may  have  been  doing  an  illegal  action.”  (Tr.  80)  At  the  time  Applicant  was
utilizing  the  webpage  to  solicit  customers,  she  had  full-time  employment  and  earned
$53,500 annually. (Tr. 84) In 2016, she made a little more than $5,000 from the website.
(Tr. 85) She did not include the income from the customers on her federal tax return for
tax year 2016. (Tr. 85-86)
Character Evidence
In 2018, Applicant received two promotions and a certificate of appreciation from
her  employer.  (Tr.  50)  She  served  in  Afghanistan  in  2014,  and  she  was  serving  in
Afghanistan at the time of her hearing. (Tr. 48)
Applicant’s program manager has known her since 2000. (Tr. 28-29) He described
her as an excellent employee who is conscientious, reliable, and responsible. (Tr. 30-31)
She did not commit any security or rule violations. (Tr. 36) He supported her for positions
of greater responsibility and a security clearance. (Tr. 32-33)
",False
"Applicant is a 53-year-old systems engineer who has served in the same position
for  the  past  15  years.  He  has  maintained  a  security  clearance  without  incident  since
2006.  He  excels  at  work.  (Ex.  J)  Applicant  has  completed  high  school  and  attended
some  college.  He  is  the  divorced  father  of  two  grown  children.  The  marriage  was
contentious and Applicant filed for divorce in 1995 based on her flagrant infidelity. In his
spare time, he has volunteered with an organization devoted to women’s health issues.
In  September  1983,  when  he  was  18  years  old,  Applicant  was  stopped  for
speeding as he enjoyed an end of summer meeting with a high school friend. Applicant
had  been  drinking  alcohol  and  also  had  used  Listerine  to  freshen  his  breath.  He  was
arrested after being administered a breathalyzer test (.01). He was charged with driving
under the influence (DUI). He was not convicted of DUI, but was given probation before
judgment. Applicant completed prescribed classes, as ordered.
In 1991, Applicant was charged with battery following a  scuffle at a party where
his former wife felt he was flirting with other women. She sprayed Mace (pepper spray)
in  his face, he  lunged,  and  knocked  her  over. As he  tried  to  wash  the  substance from
his face, she called the police. The matter was put on the stet docket for a year, during
which time no additional incidents occurred and the case  was abandoned. Around this
time, he learned his former spouse was pregnant, and their relationship improved. (Tr.
49)
Despite  getting  married  in  1993,  their  relationship  had  started  to  decline  by
August 1994 after Applicant discovered his wife was seeing other men. The clues to this
face were not subtle. (Tr. 49-50) A heated argument was verbally waged, and Applicant
went to spend the night at his parents’ vacant home. The next morning, police arrested
him  and  he  was  charged  with  one  count  of  abuse  (child  under  18),  two  counts  of
assault,  and  two  counts  of  battery.  Applicant  continues  to  maintain  no  physical
interaction occurred with either his now former spouse or a child. (Tr. 50-51) Indeed, he
stressed that the children were away with his parents. On advice of counsel, and so as
not  to  protract  either the  process  or the marriage,  Applicant  accepted  a plea deal and
pled  guilty  to  the  battery  charges.  (see,  e.g.,  Tr.  51,  83)  He  then  attended  anger
management  class,  was  sentenced  to  four  years  suspended  confinement,  and
separated from his spouse.
In 1995, Applicant and his estranged spouse tried to reconcile for the benefit of
the  children  despite  his  spouse’s  continued  infidelities.  (Tr.  52)  Their  reunion  did  not
hamper her evening activities outside of the home. In February 1996, the spouse came
home as Applicant was resting. The spouse went to her room and later emerged to call
the police, claiming he had “smashed [her] headboard and ruined some furniture.” (Tr.
53)  She  had  a  temporary  protective  order  instituted,  which  forced  Applicant  to  vacate
the  home,  and  a  domestic  violence  suit  was  brought  against  him.  He  appealed  that
determination  and  the  matter  was  subsumed  into  the  on-going  divorce  and  custody
case.  (Tr.  86)  With  her  trying  to  harass  him  through  legal  process  multiple  times,
Applicant hired a private investigator to “validate the fact that this is her motivation - to
replace  me,  again  .  .  .  and  move  her  boyfriend  in.  .  .  .”  (Tr.  55,  85-86)  Among  the
investigator’s  findings  were  the  spouse’s  misuse  of  credit  cards,  leaving  their  two
children unsupervised, and other incidents she could blame on him. (Tr. 55; Ex. K, Q-T)
In April 1996, Applicant and his estranged spouse had to talk about the children,
bills,  and  the  household.  The  spouse  was  unhappy  taking  on  her  share  of
responsibilities and threatened to file a harassment charge against him. (Tr. 55) For six
months,  he  was  unable  to  visit  the  children  after he  was  charged  with  three  counts  of
violating  an  ex  parte  protective  order  and  one  count  of  harassment.  The  harassment
charges  were  dismissed.  (Tr.  56)  Around  this  same  time,  the  spouse  went  to  court  to
address the misuse of credit card and leaving a child unattended issues. (Tr. 56)
One night in May 1996, under much marital stress, Applicant had a beer or two
with a friend. (Tr. 80-81) He later stopped at a diner for something to eat and had one
drink. (Tr. 80) When he left, he was pulled over by a policeman who claimed that there
had been a call reporting an intoxicated driver. No field sobriety test or breathalyzer was
administered,  but  he  admitted  to  having  had  alcohol.  (Tr.  80)  He  was  arrested  and
charged  with  DUI.  As  a  result,  he  was  ordered  to  one-year  unsupervised  probation.
From this experience, he has learned to never take control of a vehicle after he has had
any alcohol to drink, a rule he maintains today. (Tr. 58) Currently, Applicant only drinks
a “limited” amount of beer at dinner or on a special occasion. (Tr. 81) He will use Uber if
he has had any alcohol.
In  1997,  after  Applicant  and  his  wife  divorced  on  his  petition.  Applicant  was
awarded custody of the two children. They were aged about four and six, respectively.
One weekend in  June 2001,  Applicant took the children to the home of a family friend
for a birthday party. (Tr. 59) Applicant’s ex-wife and her most current boyfriend showed
up at the event uninvited. (Tr. 59-60) Although it was not one of her weekends for child
visitation, she wanted to take the children to make up for times she had failed to adhere
to the established weekend custody time schedule.
Applicant  was  put  into  a  “precarious”  position  by  his  ex-wife  during  a  children’s
party. (Tr. 60) Her boyfriend got involved and started arguing with Applicant to the point
where  he  “got  in  [Applicant’s]  face  and  pushed  [him]  to  the  ground.”  (Tr.  60)    While
Applicant  was  on  the floor, his ex-wife  and  her boyfriend  took off  in  a  vehicle  with  the
children.  That  Monday,  Applicant  received  a  summons  stating  he  had  struck  his  ex-
wife’s boyfriend, despite several witnesses later appearing in court testifying that it was
Applicant  who  was  struck.  (Tr.  61)  Despite  their  testimony,  and  despite  the  boyfriend
testifying the ex-wife had started the incident, the judge decided Applicant was guilty of
second-degree  assault.  The  ex-wife  requested  a  restraining  order  from  the  court,  but
her request was denied as there was no evidence any party was in harm. (Tr. 62) She
then decided to again request custody of the children. (Tr. 62-63)
In  2006,  Applicant’s  daughter  was  about  13  or  14  and  experiencing  some
behavioral issues. Applicant was still acting as both father and mother for the child. The
daughter would complain to her mother that Applicant was too strict. Applicant’s mother
again tried to get a restraining order against Applicant in attempt to gain custody of both
the children and take them with her to another state. Her two requests were denied by
the  court  and  Applicant  continued maintaining  custody  of  the  children,  with  his ex-wife
only permitted visitation. (Tr. 64-65)
In  around  2008,  Applicant  began  dating  a  woman  he  met  through  his
volunteering. They enjoyed each other’s company and, after about a year, they moved
in together. At the time, the girlfriend had two daughters, aged 4 and 6. Applicant moved
the  four  to  a  better  community  with  superior  schools  and  a  safer  area.  The  four  got
along well and “had a great time.” (Tr. 40)
In May 2010, Applicant discovered that his teenage son was getting into the drug
scene.  Applicant’s  girlfriend  and  her  daughters  were  living  with  Applicant  at  the  time,
and  they  were  aware  of  the  son’s  various  forms  of  misbehavior,  leading  Applicant  to
pronounce that smoking was not permitted in the home. (Tr. 65) The son complained to
his  mother,  Applicant’s  ex-wife.  This  led  her  to  again  pursue  a  temporary  restraining
order,  this  time  alleging  child  abuse,  against  Applicant.  Ultimately,  a  restraining  order
was denied. (Tr. 66) This was Applicant’s last conflict with his ex-wife. His children, now
ages  24  and  26,  live  separate  lives  apart from  their mother. Although  the  son  still  has
issues with drugs about which Applicant has struggled, the child’s mother maintains little
contact with the man. (Tr. 66)
In June 2015, Applicant was leading a household comprised of his girlfriend, her
two daughters, the eldest daughter’s baby, and Applicant. He was acting as both parent
and  grandparent,  managing  the  children’s  schedules,  cooking  meals,  and  providing
counsel. (Tr. 13) At this time, the younger of Applicant’s girlfriend’s minor daughters was
trying to date a man in his 20s.
When  Applicant  discovered  the  man  with  his  girlfriend’s  daughter  in  the  home
one school night around 9:00 or 10:00 p.m., Applicant reminded the child of her curfew
and asked the man to leave.  The decision was made in tandem with the girl’s mother.
(Tr. 16) The girl got very upset and started a heated argument, yelling and screaming.
(Tr. 16) The  potential date demonstrated  his  “hot  temper”  joined the  girl in  yelling  and
shoved Applicant. (Tr. 17, 68-69) He then lunged at Applicant as he tried to phone the
police. The girl’s sister tried to stop the younger man and got between the two males,
getting  accidently  elbowed  in  the  face  in  the  process.  Applicant  tried  to  retreat  to  the
bathroom  to  call  the  police,  but  the  younger  man  pursued  and  got  Applicant  in  a
headlock. (Tr. 17)
A  melee ensued. The mother  entered  the  room and  became  upset  after seeing
one  daughter  had  received  a  bloody  nose  from  being  elbowed.  (Tr.  22)  The  mother
never saw the scuffle. After statements were taken, Applicant was arrested and charged
with second degree assault of the females. (Tr. 70) This was due in part to the mother’s
statement  that  she  thought  Applicant  had  hit  the  girl  and  the  younger  daughter’s
statement  that  he  struck  her  mother.  (Tr.  18-19,  70-71)  In  court,  the  girl  recanted  her
statement that Applicant had struck her mother in the skirmish and the man pled the 5th
Amendment. (Tr. 70-71) Applicant was found not guilty of assault against the teen.
Despite  the  youngest  daughter’s  recantation,  Applicant  was  found  guilty  of
assaulting his girlfriend. Applicant appealed the matter, discrepancies in the witnesses
testimonies were stressed, and the case was ultimately dropped. (Tr. 71, 91-92)
Thus  began  an  end  of  the  romantic  relationship  between  Applicant  and  his
girlfriend,  but  time  has  healed  any  wounds  and  all  parties  have  moved  on.  (Tr.  94)
Today,  Applicant  is  close  to  his  ex-girlfriend’s  daughters  and  grandchild.  The  former
girlfriend  and  the  elder  daughter  now  live  in  different  states,  but  both  wrote
recommendations  for  Applicant.  (Exs.  B-C)  Applicant  and  the  two  daughters  text,  visit
when  in  the  same  town,  and otherwise  maintain  varying  degrees  of  contact.  Applicant
has  provided  nominal  financial  assistance  to  the  younger  women  when  needed,  but
none of the women is financially dependent on him.
The girlfriend’s younger daughter has matured since 2015. She flew in to appear
at  the  hearing  and  testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf  at  the  hearing,  noting  that  she  loves
and completely trusts him as a father figure and as a man, around whom she has never
felt unsafe or at risk. (Tr. 12-21, 26) The two speak by telephone about every other day.
(Tr. 26) The daughters’ natural father is appreciative of Applicant’s help with the young
women. (Tr. 72-73; Ex. G)

"Under  Guideline  E,  the  Government  alleged  that  in  July  2015  (SOR  1.a),
September  2013  (SOR  1.c),  July  2013  (SOR  1.d),  and  September  2012  (SOR  1.g),
Applicant was charged with criminal domestic violence. It also was alleged that in April
2004, Applicant was charged with sexual contact with a minor (SOR 1.k). Under Guideline
J, these allegations were cross-alleged as criminal conduct (SOR 2.a).
Also under Guideline E, the Government alleged that in April 2015, Applicant was
involuntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  with  a  defense  contractor  (SOR  1.b)  for
reasons of performance, attendance, and timekeeping as specified in SOR 1.b(i) – 1.b(iv).
It was also alleged that in February 2013, Applicant was involuntarily terminated from a
different defense contractor for timekeeping violations (SOR 1.e), and that in November
2012, he had submitted a falsified resume as part of his application for employment with
the  SOR  1.e  contractor (SOR  1.f). The  Government further alleged  that Applicant  was
involuntarily  terminated from  jobs  in 2008  (SOR  1.h), 2007  (SOR  1.i), and  2006  (SOR
1.j); and that Applicant has been evicted from at least three different residences (SOR 1.l)
Finally, under Guideline E, it was alleged that Applicant intentionally made false
official statements to the Government in his December 2015 e-QIP by claiming that he
left the defense contractor job referenced in SOR 1.e and 1.f by mutual agreement (SOR
1.m);  and  by  repeating  that  statement  to  Government  investigators  during  subject
interviews in February 2016 (SOR 1.n) and July 2016 (SOR 1.o).
Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  $8,451  for  15
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 3.a – 3.o).
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  explanations,  all  of  the
allegations therein. (Answer; Tr. 12 – 14) In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old. He earned his general education diploma in May 2004.
He  matriculated  at  a  college-level  technical  school  in  January  2005  and  earned  an
associate’s  degree  in  computer  information  systems  in  August  2014.  Applicant  first
received a security clearance in 2010. He started working in information technology (IT)
positions starting in December 2012, and he has worked for his current employer since
May 2016. Appellant worked as a defense contractor in Afghanistan and Kuwait for a few
months in 2012 and 2015, respectively. (GX 1; GX 6)
Applicant was married from July 2007 until divorcing in November 2015. He has
one child from that marriage, which he has described as “horrible.” Applicant also had two
children with a former girlfriend in 2003 and 2004. He also has a 13-year-old child and a
three-year-old child with two other former girlfriends. (GX 1; GX 6; Tr. 42, 76 – 79)
Applicant fathered his two oldest children when he was 16 and 17 years old, and
their mother was 13 and 14 years old. The children’s maternal grandmother was aware
of, and consented to, Applicant’s relationship with her daughter. After the older child was
born, the grandmother applied for food stamps for her daughter and grandchild. When
she  again applied for food  stamps after the younger grandchild  was  born,  state family
services threatened to charge her with neglect of her daughter if the grandmother did not
file charges of illegal sexual contact with a minor against Applicant. Under state law where
those events occurred, the mother of Applicant’s children was legally incapable, at age
13  and  14,  of  consenting  to  sexual  intercourse  with  Applicant.  The  grandmother
subsequently  swore  out  a  warrant  against  Applicant,  who  was  released  on  his  own
recognizance after turning himself in. The charges were later entered as nolle prosequi
because  no  paternity  test  was  ever  conducted  and  no  other  physical  evidence  was
gathered. Applicant admits the children are his and he is trying to support them. (Answer;
GX 1; GX 2; GX 7; Tr. 51 – 53)
Between September 2012 and July 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with
criminal domestic violence stemming from arguments that became physical altercations
with his ex-wife (SOR 1.a and 1.e) and with two ex-girlfriends (SOR 1.c and 1.d). In each
case,  the  charges  were  dismissed  because  the  victims  did  not  appear  in  court  as
witnesses against Applicant. In each case, Applicant struck or shoved the victims, one of
whom  was  pregnant  at  the  time  of  the  assault.  Applicant  claims  that  he  is  unlikely  to
engage in such conduct in the future because he has received counseling as recently as
April 2018, and because he no longer has contact with his ex-wife or his ex-girlfriends.
However, Applicant interacts with each of them when required regarding matters of child
support and visitation. He attributed his 2012 conduct to trouble adjusting after being in
Afghanistan  for  a  few  months,  speculating  that  he  was  suffering  from  post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). Applicant was never clinically diagnosed with PTSD and he did
not provide any documentation about the counseling he has received. (Answer; GX 1; GX
6; GX 8; Tr. 42 – 46, 57 – 76, 121 – 124)
Applicant  also  has  experienced  financial  problems  over  the  past  15  years.
Between  July  2007  and  November  2009,  he  and  his  ex-wife  were  evicted  from  three
different  residences  for  failing  to  pay  rent  as  required.  When  they  divorced  in  2015,
Applicant’s  mortgage  was  foreclosed  because  his  ex-wife,  who  retained  the  property
through their divorce agreement, failed to make the required monthly payments. Applicant
recently  was  able  to  obtain  a  mortgage  modification  and  recover  the  house.  As  of
December 2017, Applicant owed the debts alleged in SOR 3.a – 3.o. Most of those debts
resulted from his marriage; however, he also incurred delinquent debts because he has
broken at least two leases since his divorce. The debts at SOR 3.a and 3.j are two such
debts and they remain unresolved. Applicant successfully disputed several of the debts
alleged  in  the  SOR  as  being  his  ex-wife’s  responsibility.  Further,  Applicant  claims  his
current finances are sound. He cites his increased annual salary of $98,000 and his efforts
to  clean  up  his  credit  history  with  the  help  of  a  credit  repair  firm,  and  his  payment  of
medical  debts  through  an  employer-sponsored  health  savings  account  as  evidence  of
mitigation of the financial security concerns raised in the SOR. A credit report dated April
16, 2019, shows only three delinquent accounts. Two of the debts listed (SOR 1.h and
1.i) were paid off in March 2019. He also is in good standing with the creditors listed in
SOR 1.b and 1.c, and has repaid the debt alleged at SOR 1.m. Another debt for a $3,237
delinquent cellphone account, not alleged in the SOR, is being disputed by Applicant. He
claims  it  was  opened by  his ex-wife.  It  is  still pending  resolution.  Available  information
tends to support his claimed disputes of debts from his marriage, and that he already was
trying to resolve his debts when the SOR was issued. (Answer; GX 1 – 5; GX 6; AX A –
E; Tr. 54 – 56, 94 – 114)
Between  April  2014  and  April  2015,  Applicant  was  employed  by  Company  A,  a
defense  contractor  who  sponsored  his  request  to  renew  his  eligibility  for  a  security
clearance.  Applicant  left  that  job  under  adverse  circumstances,  but  the  ensuing
background investigation continued because Applicant found work with another defense
contractor. While working at Company A, Applicant was repeatedly counseled about his
poor performance, time-keeping and attendance discrepancies, and various violations of
company  policies.  Despite  being  placed  on  a  performance  improvement  plan  (PIP),
Applicant was either unable or unwilling to comply with company rules. SOR 1.b alleged
that  Applicant  was  terminated from  that  job in  April 2015.  Available  information  shows
that he left that job voluntarily when it became apparent he would be fired. Applicant went
on to work for three other companies, including his current employer, without apparent
incident.  Applicant’s  current  supervisor  provided  a  positive  recommendation  based  on
Applicant’s performance over most of the past three years. (Answer; GX 1; GX 6; GX 9;
AX A; Tr. 38 – 39, 44 – 45, 90 – 94)
Between  October  2006  and  April  2008,  Applicant  was  fired  from  three  different
jobs. None of those terminations were due to reduction-in-force layoffs or other factors
beyond Applicant’s control. Each termination was due to poor job performance or violation
of employer policies, or a combination of the two. In November 2012, Applicant applied
for  a  position  with  Company  B,  another  defense  contractor.  In  his  application  and  an
accompanying resume, he stated that he had an IT-related associate’s degree, with a 3.0
grade point average (GPA). He also stated that the first of the aforementioned involuntary
terminations  in  October  2006  occurred  because  the  warehouse  where  he  worked  had
been  closed.  Both  statements  on  his  November 2012  job application  were false,  but  it
was  only  after  he  was  confronted  on  cross-examination  with  the  Government’s
information that he admitted submitting false information in his job application. As to his
associate’s degree, Applicant did not receive his degree until August 2014. At the time he
applied to work at Company B, he was on academic probation with a 1.92 GPA. One of
the reasons for being placed on probation was a well-documented instance of plagiarism.
Applicant’s tenure with Company B was marked by unsatisfactory performance, security
violations, and timekeeping and attendance problems. Applicant was counseled verbally
and in writing on multiple occasions. As alleged in SOR 1.f, he was fired by Company B
on February 2, 2013. (GX 10; GX 11; Tr. 50 – 51, 79 – 90)
the  alleged  security  violation  also  directly  contradicted
When Applicant submitted his December 2015 e-QIP, he stated he left Company
B  by  mutual  agreement  because  Company  B’s  government  customer  decided  to  no
longer fund Applicant’s position. During a subject interview with a government investigator
on  February  24,  2016,  Applicant  again  stated  that  he  left  Company  B  by  mutual
agreement because of lack of funding. Applicant was re-interviewed on July 25, 2016. In
that interview, he again stated that he left Company B by mutual agreement because of
lack of funding, before being confronted with his Company B employment records. Those
records  contained  detailed  documentation  of  management’s  actions  in  response  to
Applicant’s poor performance and other on-the-job issues, including disregard for security
procedures. When Applicant testified about his termination from Company B, he again
stated that he left by mutual agreement because of funding issues. His uncorroborated
testimony  about
the
contemporaneous  records  produced  by  the  Government.  Records  generated  by
Company  B  management  and  human  resources  personnel  at  the  time  of  Applicant’s
employment there make no mention of a lack of funding, and they do not indicate that the
end of Applicant’s employment was a mutually agreed upon event. Applicant was fired
from Company B for specific, well-documented reasons. Further, in his Answer, Applicant
averred Company B did not have any paperwork signed by him regarding his dismissal,
yet the Government’s information contains several items, such as counseling records and
the  actual  termination  paperwork,  signed  by  Applicant  between  December  2012  and
February 2013. As alleged in SOR 1.m – 1.o, his statements about that event in his e-
QIP and  in  two  subject  interviews  constituted  intentional false  official  statements  to an
agency of the United States. I also find that his written response and his testimony about
the  SOR  1.m  –  1.o  allegations  are  intentional  false  official  statements.  I  did  not  find
credible his testimony about his academic problems and much of his employment history.

"Applicant  is  58  and  single.  He  has  an  associate’s  degree  and  has  been
employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  1982  as  a  production  planner.  He  has  held a
security  clearance  since  approximately  1984  and  seeks  to  retain  national  security
eligibility for access to classified information in connection with his employment. (Item 3
at Sections 12, 13A, and 25.)
1 Department Counsel submitted five Items in support of the SOR allegations. Item 4 is inadmissible. It is
the  summary  of  an  unsworn  interview  of  Applicant  conducted  by  an  interviewer  from  the  Office  of
Personnel Management on March 25, 2016. Applicant did not adopt the summary as his own statement,
or  otherwise  certify  it  to  be  accurate.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.20,  this  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI)
summary is inadmissible in the Government’s case in chief in the absence of an authenticating witness.
(See Executive Order 10865 § 5.) In light of Applicant’s admissions, Item 4 is also cumulative. Applicant
is  not  legally  trained  and  might  not  have  understood  Department  Counsel’s  FORM  footnote  2,  which
described  the  potential  admissibility  of  Item  4.  I  therefor  reviewed  it  for  any  potentially  mitigating
information that Applicant might have thought would be considered.  Any such mitigating information will
be discussed later in this decision.
2 SEAD 4 ¶ D.7 defines “National Security Eligibility” as, “Eligibility for access to classified information or
eligibility to hold a sensitive position, to include access to sensitive compartmented information, restricted
data, and controlled or special access program information.”
Paragraph 1 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national
security  eligibility  because  he  has  a  history  of  criminal  conduct.  Applicant  admitted  all
three allegations under this paragraph.
1.a.  Applicant  was  arrested  for  Driving  While  Intoxicated  (DWI)  in  April  2011.
Applicant pled guilty and was sentenced to two years of probation, and 12 months and 5
days in jail, with 11 months and 25 days suspended. Appellant stated that he spent two
weekends at the city jail farm. (Item 3 at Section 22.)
1.b. Applicant was arrested a second time for DWI on December 18, 2015. This
was about a week after signing his e-QIP (Item 3), in which he discussed his first DWI
arrest.  He  pled  guilty  on  April  19,  2016,  and  was  sentenced  to  spend  ten  days  in  jail,
three years of probation, suspension of his driver’s license for three years, and he was
required to take and complete an Outpatient Substance Abuse Program.  His probation
will end in approximately April 2019. (Item 5.)
1.c. Applicant admitted that he drank alcohol on July 22, 2016, while taking a 26-
week  substance  abuse  program.  His  alcohol  use  was  discovered  because  Applicant
was tested by the program. His treatment program was extended from 26 weeks to 36
weeks. Applicant stated in his response to DoD CAF interrogatories that he completed
the program on March 23, 2017. Applicant has been diagnosed with Moderate Alcohol
Use Disorder. He further stated that he goes to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) one to two
times  a  week.  Applicant  submitted  no  documentary  information  from  the  counseling
program to support his statement that he had successfully completed it. (Item 5.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national
security eligibility because he abuses intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted the sole
allegation under this paragraph, which states that the conduct set forth under Paragraph
1, above, is cognizable under this paragraph as well.
Applicant  stated  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  that  he  stopped  drinking
alcohol  on  July  22,  2016.  He  further  stated  that  he  stopped  using  alcohol  because  he
had received a second DWI, and his personal health. Applicant also stated that he had
no intention of using alcohol in the future. (Item 5.)
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  evidence  concerning  the  quality  of  his  job
performance.  He  submitted  no  character  references  or  other  evidence  tending  to
establish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or  reliability.  I  was  unable  to  evaluate  his
credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided
without a hearing.

"Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her current employer since December 2015. She attended college for a period without
earning a degree. She is married for the third time, but she and her husband have been
separated for more than ten years. She has two adult children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 30-
32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant has a history of criminal behavior, primarily related to substance abuse.
She  started  smoking  marijuana  in  about  1978  while  in  high  school.  She  continued
periodically  using  marijuana  until  about  2014.  She  told  a  background  investigator  in
September 2016 that she smoked marijuana on a weekly basis, off and on, from 1978
until she stopped smoking marijuana in 2014. She was interviewed again in May 2017,
and  provided  similar  information.  She  stated  that  she  did  not  use  marijuana  at  all
between  1992  and  1995,  and  then  smoked  marijuana,  with  some  breaks  of  weeks  or
months,  until  2014.  In  her  response  to  the  SOR,  she  wrote  that  she  stopped  using
marijuana  in  1984,  and  then  resumed  after  decades  of  abstinence  “for  medicinal
purposes  only”  for  her  bad  back.  She  testified  that  she  only  smoked  marijuana
occasionally, maybe once every year or two with her friends, with her most recent use in
about 2012. She later testified that her marijuana use varied from about once a month
to about once every two to three months, with a period of abstinence of about eight to
nine years. (Tr. at 25-28, 51-57; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  1990  and  charged  with  possession  of  a  controlled
substance. The controlled substances were marijuana and methamphetamine. She was
convicted  of  the  charge  and  sentenced  to  30  days  in  jail,  which  was  suspended,  and
probation for 24 months. (Tr. at 23-24, 34-38; GE 2, 3)
Applicant was arrested for assault in 2000. She stated that she was drunk, got in
a  fight  with  her  ex-husband,  and  “poked”  him  with  a  pair  of  scissors.  The  District
Attorney’s Office declined to prosecute. (Tr. at 23, 38-40; GE 3)
Applicant was arrested in 2004 and charged with criminal mischief and disorderly
conduct. She testified that she had been drinking, and she set her ex-husband’s clothes
on  fire  on  the  lawn.  She  thought  the  charges  were  dismissed.  However,  the  FBI
identification  record  indicates  that  she  was  convicted  of  the  offenses.  She  was
sentenced  to  six  months  in  jail  (suspended)  and  a  $500  fine  for  the  criminal  mischief
offense; and ten days in jail and a $100 fine ($50 suspended) for the disorderly conduct
offense. (Tr. at 23, 40-41; GE 3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2006  for  injury  to  property.  She  stated  that  she
accidently broke her sister’s window. Her sister was angry at her for an unrelated matter
and called the police. Applicant paid for the window, and charges were either never filed
or dismissed. (Tr. at 22-23, 42-43; GE 3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2011  and  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence
(DUI).  She  pleaded  guilty  to  impaired  driving.  She  was  sentenced  to  180  days  in  jail,
with 178 days suspended; probation for 12 months; 48 hours of community service; and
a  fine.  Applicant  does  not  believe  she  was  too  drunk  to  drive.  She  asserted  that  she
only had one beer. She admitted it was a large beer of about 32 ounces. She stated that
her blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .04%. (Tr. at 20-22, 43-47; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  June  2015  and  charged  with  disorderly  conduct  and
trespassing  on  private  property.  She  paid  a  fine,  and  was  ordered  to  complete
community service. The charges were then nolle prosequi (dismissed). She stated that
she and a friend were in a bar in a resort town. Her friend became extremely intoxicated
and was yelling and screaming. The hotel they were staying at  attempted to kick them
out. They were subsequently arrested. (Tr. at 20, 47-49; GE 2, 3)
Alcohol  played  a  significant  role  in  Applicant’s  criminal  record.  She  stated  that
she rarely drinks anymore, and then only in moderation. She has not been arrested or
charged  with  anything  since  the  June  2015  arrest.  Applicant  moved  to  her  current
location  in  2014  to  live  with  her  son  who  is  in  the  military.  He  has  been  a  positive
influence  on  her,  and  she  no  longer  associates  with  a  bad  crowd.  He  has  noticed  a
change  in  her  and  believes  that  she  is  honest,  loyal,  and  not  a  threat  to  national
security. (Tr. at 28-29, 49, 58-62; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
April  2016.  She  reported  her  2011  DUI  and  her  2015  arrest  for  disturbing  the  peace
(disorderly  conduct).  She  denied  any  involvement  with  illegal  drugs  in  the  previous
seven  years.  Applicant  told  the  background  investigator  that  it  was  unintentional,  and
she  must  have  misread  the  question.  She  testified  that  she  did  not  list  her  marijuana
use because she “wasn’t a big-time marijuana smoker. It was an occasional thing, and
[she]  didn’t  think  it  would  be a big  deal.” She  also  indicated  that  she  is  “not  good  with
words . . . . [She] didn’t leave it out on purpose. [She] just didn’t know how to word it.”
(Tr. at 25-27; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  two  defaulted  student  loans  and  a  $370  delinquent  medical
debt. Applicant rehabilitated the student loans, and they are in good standing. She was
jointly responsible for her ex-husband’s medical debt. He was supposed to pay it. It is
not reflected on the two most recent credit reports in evidence. (Tr. at 33-34; GE 4-6)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  comments,  nearly  all  of  the
factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.,
and  1.f.  through  1.j.);  and  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a.  through  3.i.,  and  3.k.
through 3.q.). He failed to admit or deny the allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption,
so  a  denial  was  registered  for  him.  He  denied,  with  comments,  all  of  the  remaining
allegations. Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving,
first as the manager, web business, and currently as an application systems developer,
with his current employer since May 1999. A 1990 high school graduate, Applicant earned
some college credits, but no degree.  He has never served in the U.S. military. He has
never held a security clearance, but has been occupying a position of public trust since
1999.  Applicant  was  married  in  1993.  He  has  three  children,  born  in  1993,  1995,  and
1998, respectively, and is now a grandfather.
Criminal Conduct and Alcohol Consumption
Applicant  starting  consuming  alcohol  when  he  was  15-years  old.  He  eventually
generally  drank  12  12-ounce  beers  over  a  three-day  weekend,  every  weekend,  or  an
unspecified amount of alcohol every other day, to feel calm and relaxed. He estimated
that  a  half-pint  of  liquor  and  a  12-pack  of  beer  would  make  him  feel  intoxicated.  He
became  intoxicated  monthly.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  is  an  alcoholic,  but  he
contends that he stopped drinking alcohol in about June 2016.1 He indicated that after
the  2013  incident,  described  below,  he  obtained  counseling  assistance  from  the
Employee  Association  Program  (EAP),  and  he  attended  five  sessions  with  a  certified
psychologist. He was referred to Alcohol Anonymous (AA). He claimed that he regularly
attends Alcohol Anonymous (AA) three times per week, but acknowledged that he has
not been to an AA meeting during the three weeks leading up to the hearing; he has an
AA sponsor; and he attends an unspecified number of church-related Adult Children of
Alcoholics (ACOA) counseling sessions with a spiritual advisor. ACOA is an organization
intended  to  provide  a  forum  for  individuals  who  desire  to  recover  from  the  effects  of
growing up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family.
Applicant stated an intention of never picking up another drink in his life, but if he
fails in doing so, he believes he has a strong foundation and support network to help him
get back on the right track.2 Applicant failed to submit any documentation or witnesses to
support his contentions that: (1) he no longer consumes alcohol, and the date he stopped
consuming it; (2) he attends AA, or the nature of his participation; or (3) he attends ACOA,
and the nature and frequency of the meetings and counseling sessions.
The  SOR  alleged  one  incident  of  criminality  by  Applicant  in  1991,  and  another
seven incidents over a period 14 years, commencing in 2001 and continuing until 2015.
At least three of those incidents were alcohol-related:
(SOR  ¶  1.a.):  In  April  1991,  one  month  shy  of  his  19th  birthday,  Applicant  was
arrested and charged with Attempt to Commit Robbery, Conspiracy to Commit Robbery,
and Simple Assault. The two robbery-related charges were dismissed, and Applicant pled
guilty to Simple Assault. He was placed on probation for two years;3
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): In July 2001, Applicant was charged with Driving Without a License,
a misdemeanor, as opposed to the charge Driving Under Suspension (DUS). Applicant
denied  being  aware  that  his  operator’s  license  had  been  “suspended”;  although,  he
subsequently indicated that because he had a number of tickets, the license from another

state may have been suspended. He was convicted as charged. The sentence was not
reported;4
(SOR  ¶  1.c.):  In  August  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driving  Without  a
License, a misdemeanor, once again as opposed to the charge DUS. He again denied
being aware that his operator’s license had been suspended, and he thought it had been
transferred to his current state of residence during a “period of transition.” The disposition
of the charge was not reported;5
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): In  December  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driving  Under  the
Influence (DUI), Driving Without a License, and Violation ABC Law, all misdemeanors,
after  losing  control  of  his  vehicle  on  an  Interstate  highway  and  striking  a  guard  rail,
breaking his neck. Once again, he was not charged with DUS. In this instance, Applicant
acknowledged that he lost his operator’s license because of excessive parking tickets.6
He  also  acknowledged  that  he  had  consumed  four  or  five  12-ounce  beers  before  he
drove.7 Although the disposition of the charges was not reported in the FBI Identification
Record,8 Applicant indicated that he was fined;9
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): In April 2007, Applicant was charged with Fraudulent Check Under
$500 – 1st, a misdemeanor. Although Applicant denied that he was ever formally charged
with a crime related to the “inadvertently bounced” check, he was, in fact, convicted of the
charge and fined $93.73;10
(SOR  ¶  1.f.):  In  November  2012,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUS,  a
misdemeanor. He was convicted of the charge and fined $652.50;11

11 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3. According to the state
statute covering the cited charge:
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): In May 2013, after arguing with his wife and consuming “a couple of
beers” with a friend, Applicant was charged with DUI – 1st, Open Container, and DUS, all
misdemeanors;12 and he was convicted of Reckless Driving and DUS.
(SOR  ¶  1.h.):  In  December  2015,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Habitual  Traffic
Offender, a felony, DUI – 3rd, a misdemeanor, and DUS – 3rd, a misdemeanor. The DUS
charge  was  nolle  prossed,  and  the  disposition  of  the  other  charges  was  not  reported.
Applicant contended that upon his successful completion of a court ordered DUI program,
lasting  four  days  per  week  for  a  period  of  one  year,  with  random  urinalysis,  and  total
alcohol abstinence, his DUI would be expunged. He claimed he successfully completed
the program in November 2017,13 but he failed to submit any documentation about the
program, his participation in the program, or his successful completion of the program.
A person who drives a motor vehicle on a public highway of this State when the person's
license to drive is canceled, suspended, or revoked must, upon conviction, be punished as
follows:
(a) for a first offense, fined three hundred dollars or imprisoned for up to thirty days, or both;
(b) for a second offense, fined six hundred dollars or imprisoned for up to sixty consecutive
days, or both; and (c) for a third or subsequent offense, fined one thousand dollars, and
imprisoned for up to ninety days or confined to a person's place of residence pursuant to
the  Home  Detention  Act  for  up  to  ninety  days.  No  portion  of  a  term  of  imprisonment  or
confinement under home detention may be suspended by the trial judge except when the
court is suspending a term of imprisonment upon successful completion of the terms and
conditions  of  confinement  under  home  detention.  For  purposes  of  this  item,  a  person
sentenced to confinement pursuant to the Home Detention Act is required to pay for the
cost of such confinement.
(e)(i)  A  person  convicted  of  a first  or second  offense of  this  item,  as  determined  by  the
records of the department, and who is employed or enrolled in a college or university at
any time while the person's driver's license is suspended pursuant to this item, may apply
for a route restricted driver's license permitting the person to drive only to and from work
or  the  person's  place  of  education  and  in  the  course  of  the  person's  employment  or
education during the period of suspension. The department may issue the route restricted
driver's license only upon a showing by the person that the person is employed or enrolled
in a college or university and that the person lives further than one mile from the person's
place of employment or place of education.

13 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3; Tr. at 52-54. According to the
state statute covering the cited charge:
An  habitual  offender  shall  mean  any  person  whose  record  as  maintained  by  the
Department of Motor Vehicles shows that he has accumulated the convictions for separate
and distinct offenses described in subsections (a), (b) and (c) committed during a three-
year period; provided, that where more than one included offense shall be committed within
a one-day period such multiple offenses shall be treated for the purposes of this article as
one offense:
(a) Three or more convictions, singularly or in combination of any of the following separate
and distinct offenses arising out of separate acts: (1) Voluntary manslaughter, involuntary
manslaughter  or  reckless  homicide  resulting  from  the  operation  of  a  motor  vehicle;  (2)
Applicant  claimed  that  over  an  extended  period  of  years,  especially  when  his
operator’s license was suspended, or when he did not actually have a license, he rarely
drove  his  vehicle.  He  said  he  got  to  work  as  part  of  a  car pool  with  his  wife  or  others
driving,  and  on  other  occasions  when  the  children  were  in  the  car,  also  with  his  wife
driving. He noted that on some of occasions, such as when he was stopped by the police,
or during an emergency situation with a sick child, he was not accompanied by his wife.14
Applicant also attributed the reasons for the suspensions of his operator’s license
to  the  parking  issues;  tax  liens;  failure  to  pay  property  tax  on  the  vehicle;  or  the
cancellation of his automobile insurance.15 During the hearing, Applicant stated that he
currently  does  not  have  an  operator’s  license  as  it  was  suspended  because  of  his
designation as a habitual traffic offender.16
Financial Considerations17
Applicant acknowledged that when he started his family at the age of 21, he did
not  understand  the  value  of  a  dollar  or  what  exactly  “credit”  meant.  That  lack  of
understanding, coupled with his “alcoholism,” left him in a financial hole. He claimed to
have hired a credit repair company to assist him in rebuilding his credit,  essentially by
disputing most of the delinquent accounts listed in his credit reports, as well as financial
advisors  to  help  him  spend  his  money  wisely.18  He  failed  to  submit  documentation  to
Operating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating
liquor, narcotics or drugs; (3) Driving or operating a motor vehicle in a reckless manner; (4)
Driving a motor vehicle while his license, permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has
been suspended or revoked, except a conviction for driving under suspension for failure to
file proof of financial responsibility; (5) Any offense punishable as a felony under the motor
vehicle laws of this State or any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used;
(6) Failure of the driver of a motor vehicle involved in any accident resulting in the death or
injury of any person to stop close to the scene of such accident and report his identity;
(b) Ten or more convictions of separate and distinct offenses involving moving violations
singularly or in combination, in the operation of a motor vehicle, which are required to be
reported  to  the  department  for  which  four  or  more  points  are  assigned  pursuant  to  [the
statute] or which are enumerated in subsection (a) of this section.
(c) The offenses included in subsections (a) and (b) shall be deemed to include offenses
under any federal law, any law of another state or any municipal or county ordinance of
another state substantially conforming to the above provisions.

Report, dated March 7, 2017); GE 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated October 30, 2017); AE A (Credit Plus

support  his  claims  that  a  credit  repair  company  had  been  hired;  the  identity  of  that
company;  what  that  company  had  actually  done  for him  or  in  his  behalf;  that  financial
advisors had been hired; the identity of the financial advisors; or what type of guidance
they had furnished him. Additionally, aside from Applicant’s lack or financial knowledge,
coupled  with  his  alcoholism,  it  is  unclear  how  or  when  his  financial  problems  first
emerged.
In February 2005, Applicant and his wife filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy
under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and in September 2007, that bankruptcy
was  discharged  after  the  Bankruptcy  Trustee  had  disbursed  $36,854.20  to  various
creditors, including the U.S. Treasury and the state department of revenue.19
Despite the bankruptcy discharge and the relative abatement of his financial issues
associated  with  the  Bankruptcy  Trustee’s  rejection  of  various  accounts,  within  three
years,  Applicant’s  financial  problems  mushroomed  once  again.  In  2010,  the  Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) notified him that because of errors in his income tax returns he
owed the IRS between $10,000 and $20,000, and a voluntary repayment plan withdrawal
was established, ending in approximately 2014-2015. In 2011 and 2012, several accounts
became  delinquent,  and  over  the  ensuing  years,  even  more  accounts  became
delinquent.20 In 2014, a number of tax liens were filed against him.21
In  addition  to  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  the  SOR  identified  16  purportedly
delinquent  accounts  that  had  been  placed  for  collection  or  charged  off,  as  generally
reflected  by  Applicant’s  March  2017  or October  2017  credit  reports.  Those  debts  total
approximately $12,275. The current status of those accounts is as follows:
There has been no change in the status of a vast majority of Applicant’s accounts
that  were  placed  for  collection.  While  many  of  them  were  unsuccessfully  disputed  for
reasons not explained, the following accounts remain unaddressed and unresolved, as
acknowledged by Applicant: various medical accounts with unpaid balances of $90 (SOR
¶ 1.b.); $125 (SOR ¶ 1.c.), $561 (SOR ¶ 1.d.); $225 (SOR ¶ 1.e.); $85 (SOR ¶ 1.k.); $415
(SOR ¶ 1.n.); and $760 (SOR ¶ 1.o.); and other accounts: two bank-issued credit-card

purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered:
(a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or
changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide
evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd.
Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at

2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged delinquent accounts and tax liens will be considered only for the
five purposes listed above.
accounts with unpaid balances that were charged off in the amounts of $179 (SOR ¶ 1.l.)
and $171 (SOR ¶ 1.m.); a cable-television account with an unpaid balance of $689 (SOR
¶  1.p.);  and  a  fitness  center  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $2,090,  that  Applicant
intends to start making unspecified payments to in August 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.q.).22
There are also some accounts that Applicant claims he has either made payments
to, or has paid them off. There are three medical accounts with unpaid balances of $162
(SOR ¶ 1.f.); $85 (SOR ¶ 1.g.); and $51 (SOR ¶ 1.h.).23 Applicant’s most recent credit
report reflects seven delinquent medical accounts with the same collection agent. Only
three of those accounts are alleged in the SOR. Applicant submitted a May 2018 receipt
from the collection agent, in the amount of $405.66,24 and he contended that the payment
covered all of the delinquent accounts with that one collection agent. He submitted three
letters from the collection agent indicating that ten different accounts, including the three
listed in the SOR had been settled in full.25 AE B refers to the three SOR-related accounts.
Those three accounts have been resolved.
The two remaining accounts refer to a lease with an unpaid balance of $6,507 due
to damage (SOR ¶ 1.i.) that was placed for collection; and a student loan with an unpaid
balance of $80 (SOR ¶ 1.j.).26 With respect to the former account, Applicant contends that
he reached out to the creditor and agreed to a repayment plan under which, starting in
March 2018, he would pay $100 per month.27 Regarding the latter account, he contended
that he paid the creditor the outstanding amount in June or July 2018.28 Applicant failed
to  submit  documentation  to  support  his  contentions  that  payments  had  been  made  to
either creditor, even though he indicated that he would do so if the record would be kept
open. In the absence of such documentation, neither account has been resolved.
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  requested  to  complete  a  Personal  Financial
Statement to reflect his monthly net income; monthly expenses; and a monthly remainder
available for  discretionary  saving  or spending.  He failed to  do  so. However,  during  the
hearing, he acknowledged that his annual salary was about $74,000 and his wife’s annual
salary  was  about  $125,000,  for  a  total  of  approximately  $200,000.29  He  has  less  than
$1,000  in  his  401(k),  after  withdrawing  $10,000  in  anticipation  of  closing  on  his  new

residence;  and  less  than  $1,000  at  the  end  of  each  month  for  discretionary  saving  or
spending.30 He purchased a new hybrid sport-utility vehicle (SUV) for his wife in 2016. In
response  to  a  question  as  to  why  he  failed  to  make  more  progress  with  modest  or
minimum delinquent debts with a combined annual income of $200,000, Applicant could
not respond, claiming that because “we have a ton of bills,” they are trying to adjust their
finances.  Applicant  disputed  certain  accounts  solely  because  he  disagreed  with  the
amounts  reflected.  He  was  unable  to  explain  why  his finances  went  into  such  disarray
before 2005 as to justify his filing for bankruptcy; and he was unable to explain why his
finances  deteriorated  in  2007  to  create  his  current  delinquencies.  Although  the  record
remained open, he also failed to furnish a requested updated status of his SOR-related
accounts supported by receipts, checks, or letters related to those debts; and a copy of
his repayment plan showing any priority for addressing his delinquent accounts.
Personal Conduct31
(SOR ¶ 4.a.): This allegation cross-references the SOR allegations associated with
his criminal conduct and alcohol consumption.
(SOR  ¶  4.b.):    On  January  10,  2017,  when  Applicant  completed  his  e-QIP,  he
responded to certain questions pertaining to his police record found in Section 22. Those
questions requested certain information regardless of whether the record in his case had
been sealed, expunged, or otherwise stricken from the court record, or the charge was
dismissed.  Certain  convictions,  not  relevant  here,  did  not  need  to  be  reported.  Those
questions were essentially as follows: In the past seven years have you been: a. issued
a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against you?; b.
arrested  by  any  police  officer,  sheriff,  marshal,  or  any  other  type  of  law  enforcement
official?; c. charged, convicted, or sentenced of a crime in any court?; and d. or are you
currently on probation or parole? In addition, are you currently on trial or awaiting a trial
on  criminal  charges?  Applicant  answered  “yes”  to  the  combined  questions,  and  he
reported the incident from 2013 in which he said he was charged with DUI, but reduced
to Reckless Driving, and ordered to pay a fine.32 He omitted the 2013 DUS charge, the
November 2012 DUS charge; and the December 2015 DUI, DUS, and Felony Habitual
Traffic Offender charges. He certified that his responses to those questions were “true,
complete,  and  correct”  to  the  best  of  his  knowledge  and  belief,  but,  because  of  his
omissions, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.
Applicant subsequently offered differing explanations for the omissions. He either
did not recall the 2012 or 2015 incidents; did not consider traffic incidents to be criminal;
30 Tr. at 102-107.
31 During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶ 4.a. by deleting that portion of
the allegation that reads “and 3.a. through 3.q.” There being no objection, the motion was granted, and the
SOR was amended as indicated. See Tr. at 135-138.
32 GE 1 (e-QIP, dated January 10, 2017), at 24-25; Tr. at 120-128.
misinterpreted the questions; or his claimed, but otherwise unconfirmed, stroke interfered
with his recollections. He denied deliberately failing to disclose the omitted information.
(SOR ¶ 4.c.): On January 10, 2017, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he also
responded  to  certain  questions  pertaining  to  his  finances  found  in  Section  26.  Those
questions asked if, in the past seven years, he had any bills or debts turned over to a
collection agency; or he had any account or credit card suspended or cancelled for failing
to pay as agreed. Applicant answered “no” to each of the questions.33 He certified that his
responses  to  those  questions  were  “true,  complete,  and  correct”  to  the  best  of  his
knowledge  and  belief,  but  the  responses  to  those  questions  were,  in  fact,  false.  He
omitted every one of the 16 delinquent accounts that were eventually alleged in the SOR
as  well  as  the  tax  issues  that  were  not  alleged;  even  though  those  tax  liens  were  not
resolved until 2014, well within the seven-year period of interest.
Applicant  subsequently  offered  differing  explanations  for  the  omissions.  He
claimed that at the time he completed his e-QIP, he was unaware that he had any such
delinquent  accounts;  a  creditor  reached  out  to  him  after  the  e-QIP  was  completed;  he
thought “all that stuff was off [his] credit report;”  he thought his medical bills had been
paid; he did not think that tax liens would show up on his credit report; and he did not
consider a voluntary payment to be the same as a garnishment.34 He denied deliberately
failing to disclose the omitted information.
Work Performance
A  review  of  several  years’  of  Applicant’s  annual  performance  reviews  reveals  a
number of bonus and incentive payments as well as final overall ratings that generally fall
within the “sometimes exceeds expectations” with occasional “meets expectations” and
one “consistently exceeds expectations.”35
",False
"Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  aircraft  mechanic  for  a  defense  contractor,  employed
since  2009.  He  was  laid  off  in  March  2018  pending  security  eligibility.  He  previously
worked  for  another  company  from  1999  to  2009,  until  he  was  terminated  for  his
involvement in an embezzlement scheme. Applicant graduated from high school in 1983,
and  honorably  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1983  to  1998,  including  a  deployment  to
Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm. He was married in 1986 and divorced in
2003. He reconciled with his spouse in 2013, but remains unmarried. He has two children
and  three  step  children;  all  but  one  is  an  adult.  He  does  not  currently  hold  a  security
clearance.
The SOR alleges under Guideline E, that Applicant was a defendant in a civil suit
for embezzlement of $627,000 from his former employer. Applicant was terminated from
employment as a result of his involvement in the theft. This incident was cross-alleged
under  Guideline  J,  for  criminal  conduct.  Also,  under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleges
Applicant falsified his 2014 SCA by failing to disclose his arrests in 2002 and 2011 for
driving while intoxicated (DWI), and the civil lawsuit described above. In addition, the SOR
alleges Applicant deliberately falsified his 2010 and 2015 personal subject interviews by
deliberately concealing the reason he was terminated from his job in 2009, claiming he
was fired because of his connection to his co-defendant and that he was not involved in
theft from the company. Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges the embezzlement incident,
and  three  delinquent  credit  accounts  that  have  been  charged-off  or  are  in  collections,
totaling approximately $20,000.
Applicant worked for his previous employer from 1999 to 2009. In about 2000, he
became friendly with a co-worker (B), who was the company comptroller. They eventually
became romantically involved. Eventually B became pregnant with Applicant’s child, who
was  born  in  2002.  From  about  2002  to  2008,  B  used  company  funds  to  pay  for  her
personal expenses, credit cards, mortgage, utilities, and other items, and used company
funds to buy items for Applicant, including an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) and two rifles. B
provided  a  credit  card  to  Applicant  in furtherance of  the  crime.  Applicant  stated  that B
usually paid the credit card for him, but that he also contributed money to her on occasion,
but  was  not  sure  how  it  was  spent.  Among  other uses  of  the  credit  card,  B  instructed
Applicant to use his card to purchase $27,800 in gift cards, and turn them over to another
employee at the company. Applicant suspected B was stealing from the company and
suspected his supervisor was involved.2 At one point, B took Applicant’s credit card from

but the allegations were not supported nor are they relevant to Applicant’s case.
him during a dispute, but it was later returned to Applicant by his supervisor. Applicant
did not question why his supervisor would have his credit card, nor did he question B’s
extravagant purchases and credit card use even though he suspected she did not earn
enough to afford them. At least a year before the company discovered the theft, Applicant
acknowledged that he knew about the scheme, and maintained his involvement. When
Applicant was confronted by the company president in 2009, Applicant admitted  to the
theft scheme, but maintained that he only received the property purchased with stolen
funds.  Applicant  continues  to  assert that although  he  knew  of the  theft  and  purchases
with  stolen  funds,  he did  not directly  steal from  the  company.  He stated  that  he never
directly asked B about the origins of her  money or questioned B about purchases and
unusual credit card use. He suspected B and his supervisor in the theft scheme, but never
reported his suspicions to company officials or law enforcement for fear of losing his job.
On March 30, 2009, when confronted by the company president, Applicant acknowledged
the theft scheme. He was fired. In October 2009, B moved into Applicant’s home with him
and Applicant considered her his “common law wife.” (GE 4)
Applicant  and  B  were  sued  by  the  company  in  May  2009,  for  embezzlement,
breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conversion, theft, and falsification of records. In 2010, the
court  granted  the  company  a  partial  summary  judgment  as  to  liability  only.  B  was
convicted  and  imprisoned  for  theft  of  approximately  $627,000  from  the  company.
Applicant’s attorney requested the company agree to allow Applicant to return property
purchased with company funds in lieu of prosecuting him. This was considered a partial
reimbursement.  Although  Applicant’s  attorney  told  him  that  he  was  likely  to  be  sued,
Applicant claimed that he was never served with the complaint or appeared in court, nor
was he aware of the lawsuit and summary judgment until he received the SOR in 2018.
For these reasons, he asserted that he did not report the lawsuit on his 2014 SCA.
In his 2014 SCA, Applicant listed that he was fired in 2009 “because of conflict of
interest.” Applicant was interviewed  several times by Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) investigators, including in 2010 and 2015. In those interviews, he claimed that he
was fired for his personal connection to B, but that he was not involved in any theft of
money  from the  company.  In a  2012  OPM  interview,  Applicant  became  uncomfortable
during  questioning  regarding  the  theft  scheme.  Applicant  refused  to  answer  questions
related to B’s involvement, and he abruptly left the interview before it was complete. (GE
4) In testimony, Applicant admitted that he was not fully truthful in the answers he provided
the  investigators  with  respect  to  his involvement  in  the  company  theft  scheme,  stating
that he was only 50% honest.
In 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI).
He was placed on probation and the charge was dismissed at its conclusion. In 2011, he
was  arrested  for  DWI  while  driving  on  a  military  installation.  He  was  administratively
barred from driving on base for one year. Applicant did not report these arrests or charges
on his 2014 SCA. Despite discussing them in his 2012 interview, he again failed to report
the  charges  on  his  2014  SCA.  He  testified  that  he  did  not  fully  understand  the  SCA
questions related to criminal charges involving alcohol.
The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to a credit card company on an account
that has been charged-off for about $14,943. Applicant noted after the hearing, that he
contacted the creditor and they were unable to find the account. Applicant’s credit report
of November 2014 (GE 14) shows the account was opened in 2001 and the last activity
was in 2012. Applicant is listed as an authorized user on the account and disputed his
responsibility for it. Two other delinquent accounts placed in collection were resolved after
the hearing. (AE A)
During testimony, Applicant was less than forthcoming, guarded, often unclear and
disjointed when answering direct questions related to his involvement in the theft scheme
and  his  knowledge  at  the  time.  He  asserted  that  he  was  trying  to  answer  questions
truthfully  and  did  not  want  to  give  deceptive  answers.  Applicant’s  current  human
resources and assistant facility security officer testified to Applicant’s trustworthiness and
honesty. The witness also provided a positive character letter, claiming that Applicant has
overcome his past behavior, and it is no longer a concern. Likewise, Applicant’s current
site  manager also  attested  to  Applicant’s  good  standing  with  the  company,  and  stated
that  Applicant  has  not  acted  in  a  way  to  raise  questions  about  his  judgment.  Both
references  claimed  in  similar  language,  that  Applicant  misunderstood  SCA  security
questions  or  answered  in  a  manner  unique  to  him  when  he  felt  that  questions  were
“misleading, misinformed or accusatory.” They also claimed that Applicant “reached out”
to all of his creditors to resolve his delinquencies.
",False
"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual
allegations  pertaining  to  criminal  conduct  in  the  SOR  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.d.).
Applicant  did  not admit  or deny  the  allegations  pertaining  to  personal conduct  (SOR ¶
2.a.),  so  a  denial  was  registered  as  to  that  allegation.  Applicant’s  admissions  and
comments  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a solution-delivery designer with his current employer since April 2016. He completed
his high school education through the General Educational Development (GED) Program
in 1987. He also earned some college credits, but no degree. Applicant enlisted in the
Army National Guard in February 1987, and he remained with the National Guard until he
was  transferred  to  the  U.S.  Army  Reserve  in  October  1987.  In  August  1988,  after
receiving administrative disciplinary punishment by written counseling or under Article 15,
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) on three separate occasions for (1) “bouncing”
several checks, (2) having long hair, and (3) being under the influence of alcohol, he was
administratively  discharged  and  issued  an  uncharacterized  discharge  while  training.
Applicant was granted a confidential clearance in 1988, and he held a secret clearance
from 2007 until 2008. Applicant was married in 1993 and separated in 2011. He has been
cohabiting since April 2013. He has two children, born in 1996 and 1999.
Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct
Applicant’s relationship with his wife has been rather toxic and volatile. He noted
that  his  wife  has  mental-health  issues,  and  that  she  has  been  hospitalized  and
institutionalized on several occasions. Because of a variety of issues created by his wife’s
erratic behavior, and her refusal to take her medication, Applicant and his wife have been
involved in a series of incidents that have escalated to alleged mutual domestic violence,
as well as police and court interventions:
(SOR ¶.1.a.): In September 2006, Applicant sustained a head injury because of a
motorcycle accident, and the result was equilibrium problems and extreme dizziness that
left him temporarily unable to stand up.  On November 26, 2006, he and his wife were
arguing about reasons he could not recall. Applicant’s wife ordered him out of the house
and started kicking and pushing him, and even attempted to push him down the stairs.
He did not strike her, but he did grab her as he was falling. She eventually went outside
to  talk on  the telephone,  and  when  she  did, Applicant  locked the  door behind  her and
called the sheriff. The sheriff interviewed both parties, and issued citations for harassment
to both Applicant and his wife. Applicant was permitted to remain in the house with his
son that night, while his wife was persuaded to leave with her father and brother.1 The
following  day,  she  returned  home  while  he  was  packing  for  a  job  interview  in  another
state. Once again, an argument ensued, and again it involved her kicking and pushing
Applicant. He did not strike her. When she went outside to talk on the telephone, Applicant
again  locked  the  door  and  called  the  sheriff.  The  sheriff  remained  in  the  residence  to
enable Applicant to complete his packing and leave. Neither party was arrested.2
As  a  result  of  the  harassment  citations,  Applicant  and  his  wife  were  offered
accelerated rehabilitative disposition (ARD), a special pre-trial intervention program in the
state for non-violent offenders with no prior or limited record. The primary purpose of the
program  is  the  rehabilitation  of  the  offender  and  secondarily  the  prompt  disposition  of
charges,  eliminating  the  need  for  costly  and  time-consuming  trials  or  other  court
proceedings. They both successfully completed the program on December 19, 2006.3
(SOR ¶.1.b.): On November 27, 2006, the date of the second incident, Applicant’s
wife  filed  an  emergency  protection  from  abuse  order  (PFA)  -  a  civil  order  of  the  court
available to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, that prohibits the
offender from abusing, stalking, harassing, threatening or attempting to use physical force
that would reasonably cause bodily injury to the victim – following the advice of a woman’s
support  group,  claiming  Applicant  beat  their  children.4  Applicant  offered  two  separate

accounts  regarding  the  PFA,  initially  claiming  that  he  was  unaware  of  it,  but  later
acknowledging that it was served on him. He was told not to have contact with his wife.
Several months later, during a period of reconciliation, Applicant and his wife were seen
together, and someone not identified reported the PFA violation to the sheriff. On March
29, 2007, the sheriff came to the family residence and arrested Applicant for contempt for
violating the PFA. Unable to obtain $10,000 bail, Applicant remained in jail until April 5,
2007.5 Applicant’s wife made several attempts to have the PFA  rescinded, and on that
date, the district attorney’s motion to withdraw the violation was granted and the matter
was dismissed.6
In April 2013, Applicant went to visit his sons for a week and work on the mediation
papers  for  an  amicable  divorce.  Somehow,  Applicant’s  wife  obtained  control  of  his
telephone and found text messages from his at that point, future cohabitant. She became
enraged  and  they  got  into  an  argument.  She  tore  up  the  divorce  paperwork.  She  also
attempted to remove the clothing he had in his vehicle and tried to take the vehicle. They
struggled  at  the  doorway  to  the  vehicle.  Applicant  called  the  police  who  arrived  and
observed her screaming and yelling, and attempting to throw his belongings out of the
vehicle. No one was arrested, and Applicant returned home without further incident.7
(SOR ¶.1.c.): On June 24, 2013, Applicant’s wife filed a criminal complaint against
him  for  grabbing  her  arm  and  pushing  her.  When  the  police  arrived,  they  interviewed
Applicant’s  wife  and  children.  She  claimed  that  Applicant  grabbed  her  arm  during  a
confrontation  identical  to  the  one  that  occurred  in  April  2013.  The  two  sons  –  then
approximately  17  and  14  years  of  age  –  denied  that  Applicant  touched  her.  She  then
requested  a  person  the  police  described  as  her  “friend,”  but  actually  her  brother,  to
confirm that Applicant grabbed her arm while she was removing items from the vehicle
that  her brother had  “doctored” so  the  engine  would not  start.  A warrant  of  arrest  was
issued, and Applicant’s wife obtained her own  warrant. She also filed a request for an
emergency protective order – family abuse (EPO).8 The following day, while attending a

an  applicant's  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed
circumstances;  (c)  to  consider  whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to

Applicant’s unalleged EPO will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.
custody hearing at the family courthouse, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery
against a family or household member, a class 1 misdemeanor. After spending several
hours  in  jail,  he  was  released  and  allowed  to  return  to  his  out-of-state  home  until  the
eventual hearing date.9 On September 26, 2013, after hearing the conflicting testimony
from the police officers, Applicant’s wife, and her brother, the charges were nolle prossed,
and the EPO was dismissed, with the judge admonishing Applicant’s wife for abusing the
system.10 Applicant contends that  his wife leverages the system, and that  the charges
and  EPO  were  intended  to  prevent  him  from  visiting  his  children  and  recovering  his
personal property.
Applicant’s relationship with his cohabitant – now referred to as his fiancée - has
also  been  at  times  somewhat  volatile.  She  has  had  anger  and  psychiatric  issues  that
required  medication,  and  because  of  those  issues,  they  have  separated  periodically.
However,  now  that  she  is  back  on  her  medication,  her  issues  have  been  successfully
modified.11
(SOR ¶.1.d.): Applicant and his fiancée reunited in February 2017, after a three-
month separation, and they were still having difficulties over their relationship. On April
22, 2017, although Applicant tried holding her hand to stop her from doing more harm,
she  pushed  and  struck  him,  and  slammed  his  wrist  in  the  door.  Applicant  pushed  her
away. At one point during their disagreement, she went outside and threw a hatchet at
the  house,  putting  a  hole  in  the  house.12  Applicant  called  the  police.  When  the  police
arrived, Applicant’s wrist was treated with an ice pack and wrap, and both Applicant and
his  fiancée  were  interviewed.  Applicant’s  fiancée  acknowledged  having  anger  issues,
leading  to  violent  outbursts,  and  denied  that  Applicant  struck  her.  Nevertheless,  both
Applicant and his fiancée were arrested and charged with domestic violence, 3rd degree.13
On October 2, 2017, the court found Applicant not guilty of the charge and dismissed the
charge nolle prossed. All records pertaining to the charge were ordered expunged and
destroyed.14

person from the dispute to prevent or minimize potential or further injury.

",True
"After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I find that SOR ¶ 1.f does
not allege additional conduct of security concern, but rather reflects the disposition for the
offenses covered in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e. My findings of fact are as follows:
Applicant is a 24-year-old high school graduate, who completed certificate programs
to be a nurse’s aide in late 2013 and an automotive technician in July 2016.  He is not
married  but  is  in  a  cohabitant  relationship  with  his  fiancée.  They  have  a  two-year-old
daughter. (GEs 1-2; AE A; Tr. 20, 26-27, 32.) Applicant is employed in automobile sales,
but  he  has  an  offer  of  defense-contractor  employment  contingent  on  him  obtaining  a
security clearance. (Tr. 27-28.)
Applicant began using mood-altering substances as a teenager. He was influenced
by friends in his environment and used marijuana on a daily basis with two friends from
June 2010 to June 2014. He purchased the drug from those friends, and he sold marijuana
to his friends. The date when he started drinking alcohol is not in the record, although he
volunteered that he drank alcohol in quantity of five drinks or more to intoxication until early
2015, when he then moderated his consumption. (GE 4; Tr. 30, 70.)
Applicant also began committing crimes as a teenager. At age 15 in July 2009,
Applicant broke into some vehicles with a friend and stole loose change and a GPS unit.
He  was  charged  with  felony  burglary  and  placed  on  two  years  of  probation.  In
approximately July 2011, Applicant was loitering at a local baseball field with three friends
when the police arrived. Intoxicated from drinking at a party earlier that night, Applicant ran
into a pharmacy and stole five packs of cigarettes. He was given accelerated rehabilitation
for the theft. (GEs 1, 4.)
The month following his high school graduation, Applicant started the nurse’s aide
program at a local community college in July 2011. That September, he began working a
part-time retail job. (GEs 1, 4.)
On March 20, 2012, Applicant was arrested for sale of a controlled substance, a
felony.1 He was a passenger in a vehicle with some friends when they were pulled over by
the state police for a brake light issue. The police smelled marijuana because Applicant
and his friends had been smoking the drug in the backseat, and Applicant had multiple
bags of marijuana in his jacket. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 52-53.) Applicant completed court-ordered
treatment for his marijuana use from September 2012 to November 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 37.)
1 During his subject interview, Applicant recalled the offense as occurring in May 2012, and that he was at a
carnival with three bags of marijuana to sell and to smoke. He indicates that an unknown individual walked up
to him and gave him a cell phone for the marijuana. Applicant was then arrested in a vehicle in the parking lot.
(GE 4.) An FBI record shows that he was arrested in March 2012 for sale of a controlled substance. (GE 3.)
The statute Applicant violated, Section 21a-277(b) provides in part:
(b) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds,
transports with intent to sell or dispense, possesses with intent to sell or dispense, offers,
gives  or  administers  to  another  person  any  controlled  substance,  except  a  narcotic
substance, or a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, except as authorized in this
chapter, may, for the first offense, be fined not more than twenty-five thousand dollars or be
imprisoned  not  more  than  seven  years  or  be  both  fined  and  imprisoned;  and,  for  each
subsequent  offense,  may  be  fined  not  more  than  one  hundred  thousand  dollars  or  be
imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or be both fined and imprisoned.
The FBI record does not indicate that he was arrested for possession with intent to sell as alleged in the SOR,
although intent to sell would violate the same statute.
Applicant sold marijuana with some regularity, including at times once or twice a
week, from 2012 to September 2014. He sold the drug usually to friends and “here and
there” to friends of his friends. His profit from the marijuana sales was usually enough for
him to purchase more for his personal consumption. (Tr. 35-37, 45.)
On  April 7, 2012, Applicant was stopped for OUI and reckless driving, although
formal charges were not filed against him until December 2012. Applicant had consumed
alcohol at a party when his companion suggested that he drive because he appeared to be
more sober. He drove her to another party, where Applicant became “totally drunk.” He
then  drove  three  friends  to  a  store,  but  on  returning  to  the  party  with  his  friends,  he
“blacked out” and crashed his vehicle into a house. Applicant was unconscious, and broke
his neck and back in the accident. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 56-61.) He was ordered into alcohol
counseling following his arrest in December 2012, which he completed. (Tr. 38-39.)
Applicant was terminated from his part-time retail job in July 2012 after he failed to
report for work. He failed to keep track of his work schedule and was often tardy. Applicant
also  speculates  that  his  co-workers  may  have  told  his  supervisor  that  he  smelled  of
marijuana. He had rolled a “blunt” in the bathroom the day before his termination, although
he claims it was for future use. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 43-44.)
Applicant was unemployed from July 2012 to June 2013. He supported himself by
selling marijuana. He also spent his time partying. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 44.) On June 17, 2013,
Applicant was sitting on his porch when a minor age 15 or 16 spat at him. It escalated into
a physical altercation. A few weeks later, the police charged Applicant with risk of injury, a
felony, and with assault, 3rd degree, and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. (GEs 1,
3-4;  Tr.  62-64.)  Applicant  now  asserts  that  he  “just  basically  restrained”  the  minor  by
putting him in a headlock to calm him down.2 He denies that he injured the youth in any
way and attributes his arrest to the youth’s brother, who disliked Applicant. (Tr. 64.)
Applicant worked as a part-time cashier at a doughnut shop from June 2013 to
August 2013. He was late for work several times because he was out too late partying and
did not report for his 5:00 a.m. shift. He was issued written warnings three or four times
before being fired for tardiness. Applicant was unemployed for the next year. He supported
himself by selling marijuana. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 45.)
On March 1, 2014, Applicant was arrested for felony sale of a controlled substance
and for misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Applicant was stopped by the police in
2 Applicant testified about the July 2013 assault of a minor, as follows:
They said that [the minor] was bleeding. And they said that he was hurt. But the only thing I
did to him was I put him in a headlock and I had to calm him down. He kept trying to swing at
me. But I already knew that he was young and underage. So I just basically restrained him.
And even after the fact that he spit on me even after everything got broken up and all that
stuff. (Tr. 64.)
route to a party after he threw something from his vehicle. He had three bags of marijuana
on him to sell at a party, and he smelled of marijuana.3 (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 65-66.)
On June 26, 2014, Applicant was arrested for felony possession of marijuana, felony
sale of a controlled substance, felony conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to sell,
and  felony  conspiracy  to  sell  a  controlled  substance.  A  friend  contacted  him  about
purchasing some marijuana from him in a local parking lot. When Applicant arrived, the
police  arrested  him  for  selling  marijuana  for  financial  profit.  He  had  four  ounces  of
marijuana in his possession. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 66-67.) Applicant asserts that he ceased his
marijuana use in June 2014 because it made him feel “demotivated.” (GE 4.) He continued
to  sell  marijuana  until  September  2014  to  pay  for  his  lawyer.  He  possessed  some
marijuana after his arrest and he “wasn’t going to give it away.” (Tr. 45-46.)
With the aforesaid criminal charges still pending against him for offenses committed
since March 2012, Applicant began working part time as a cashier at a sporting goods
store  in  September  2014.  He  was  terminated  in  November  2014  after  he  was  caught
stealing. He is ineligible for rehire. Applicant attempted to steal some food from the store
because he did not have enough money to pay for lunch. He was making “wrong decision
after wrong decision.” (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 46-47.) Applicant lived at home with his mother, and
she supported him financially when he was unemployed from November 2014 to January
2015. (GE 4.)
In January 2015, Applicant began working as a part-time cook at a pizza restaurant.
He left the job in March 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 46.) According to the employer, he is not eligible
for rehire because he was slow and did not follow instructions. Applicant held a second
part-time job at a fast-food establishment from February 2015 to February or March 2016,
when he resigned to spend time with  his child and focus on his training to become an
automotive technician, which he had started in July 2015. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 50.)
Pursuant to a plea deal, on March 9, 2015, Applicant pleaded guilty to the March
2012 felony sale of a controlled substance and the April 2012 misdemeanor OUI (arrested
in December 2012). In exchange, the prosecutor entered nolle prosequi dispositions for the
April 2012 reckless driving infraction and all of the criminal charges filed against him since
July 2013.4 Applicant was sentenced for OUI to six months in jail (suspended); 18 months
of supervised probation, to be served concurrent with his probation for the felony drug
charge;  a  fine  of  $500;  and  100  hours  of  community  service.  For  the  felony  sale  of  a
controlled substance, he was sentenced to five years in jail, suspended; three years of
supervised  probation;  and  50  hours  of  community  service.  (GEs  1,  3-4;  Tr.  67-70.)  In
approximately May 2015, Applicant cut his ties with those friends involved with marijuana.
(Tr. 33.)
3 During his subject interview in March 2017, Applicant inaccurately recalled the possession and drug sale
charges as occurring in September 2013. (GE 4.)
4 A nolle prosequi (shortened as “nolle” in the FBI record) is a formal entry on the record by a prosecutor by
which he or she declares that there will be no further prosecution.
Applicant was drug tested during his probation on a regular basis, and all of the
tests  were  negative.  (Tr.  70.)  He  was  also  required  to  complete  counseling  for  his
marijuana use and to complete an Ignition Interlock Device (IID) Program. Applicant had
substance abuse counseling from  April 2015 to July 2015, which he asserts “definitely
started to drive [him], wake [him] up a little bit in the right direction.” (Tr. 40-41.) On his
completion of the IID program on September 26, 2016, the interlock device was removed
from his vehicle. He successfully completed his probations for the OUI on September 9,
2016, and for the felony sale of a controlled substance on March 9, 2018. (GEs 1, 3-4; AEs
B-C.)
As part of his employment application to work for his defense-contractor employer,
Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) on October 29, 2015. He disclosed his arrest record; his use of marijuana
(“Smoked a blunt once a day”) from June 2010 to June 2014; his sales of marijuana to his
friends once or twice a week from May 2012 to June 2014 “due to the surroundings in
which  the  substance  brought  upon  [him];”  and  his  completion  of  counseling  for  his
marijuana use in 2012 and 2015. He denied any intention to use marijuana in the future for
the following reason:
Marijuana has changed my life in a very negative way. Bad characteristics
had been introduced and held onto, through this substance. Through me
quitting this substance I’m more motivated and ready to pursue my career
and maintain a happy standard of living. (GE 1.)
In July 2016, Applicant earned his automotive technician certificate. (GE 4; Tr. 20.)
He has since worked in the automotive industry, primarily in sales, without any adverse
incidents. (GEs 1, 4.)
On March 2, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant discussed his criminal charges, his
marijuana use, his alcohol use, and his involuntary termination from some previous jobs.
He indicated that the date of his last use of marijuana was accurately reported on his SF
86 and that he was no longer associating with any known illegal drug users. About his
alcohol use, he indicated that his drinking had decreased since early 2015 to once a month
and not to intoxication. He admitted that he drank to intoxication once a week until early
2015. He denied any intention to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. He
did not expect his drinking habit to change in the future. (GE 4.)
On September 20, 2017, Applicant responded to interrogatories from the DOD CAF
concerning his illegal drug use. He indicated that he had used cannabis a total of 20 times
in 2011, 2012, and 2014. He responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he
had ever purchased, sold, transported, or manufactured the drug. He also listed a one-time
use of Xanax in 2015, which was apparently obtained from his mother-in-law who has a
prescription. He was working and going to school and used it as a sleep aid. (Tr. 41-42.)
He denied any use of marijuana since his arrest in March 2014.5 Applicant indicated that
5 Applicant disclosed discrepantly on his SF 86 that he used marijuana (“smoked a blunt once a day”) to June
he did not have any illegal drugs or paraphernalia in his possession and that he had no
current association with any illegal drug users.  He also responded “Yes” to whether he had
ever participated in any drug or alcohol rehabilitation program and disclosed that he had
inpatient therapeutic meetings from March 2015 to June 2015. (GE 2.)
At his hearing, Applicant testified that he has put his past behind him and wanted
the opportunity to work for the defense contractor that is sponsoring him for a clearance.
(Tr. 24-25.) He denies any marijuana use since June 2014 and any current association with
illegal drug users. He spends his time outside of work with his fiancée and their daughter.
He and his fiancée began dating around the time of his last arrest in 2014, and they are
currently cohabitants. (Tr. 32, 73.) His fiancée works as a dental assistant. (Tr. 32-33.) He
attributes his turnaround to his probation officer, who became a mentor to him. (Tr. 72.)

"Applicant is a 48-year-old male with medical training received in the military. He
is  currently  unemployed  with  a  job  offer  pending  from  a  defense  contractor.  Applicant
honorably  served  in  the  United  States  military  for  over  24  years,  mostly  spent  as  a
special  forces  medic  with  a  top  secret  security  clearance.  He  has  taken  a  number  of
college-level  courses  and  completed  a  medical  certification  program.  He  is  currently
separated from his third spouse.
In January 2004, when he was serving in the military, Applicant and colleagues
were celebrating the completion of a three-year course. Driving in his new Mustang after
leaving  a  bar,  he  was  caught  driving  90  miles  per  hour  in  a  50  miles-per-hour-speed-
limit. He did not realize how fast he was going. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC)
level measured at 0.18. and he was arrested for driving while impaired (DWI). He was
reprimanded  through  the  military  with  a  general  officer  memorandum.  He  was  neither
ordered to seek, nor sought, treatment or counseling after the incident.
In  2014,  around  the  time  he  was  honorably  discharged  from  the  military,
Applicant  and  his  now-estranged  wife  prepared  to  move  to  a  new  state  so  he  could
apply  to  a  particular  academic  program.  His  wife’s  ex-husband  objected  to  her  taking
their  children  out of  state,  and  a  court  order  made  her return them  so  the ex-husband
could  continue  visitation  rights  until  a  hearing  could  be  held.  The  wife  and  children
returned,  but  the  hearing  was  postponed.  Meanwhile,  Applicant  remained  in  the  new
state  until  the  court  finally  convened  and  declared  the  family  could  not  move  the
children away. Once reunited, Applicant found it difficult to find a job, although his wife
had found work relatively quickly. Having to be at the dictates of his wife’s “terrible” ex-
husband  “broke  her  spirit.  .  .  .  she’s  never  been  the  same,  still  now.  And  she  started
isolating  herself.  [She  and  Applicant]  weren’t  communicating.”  (Tr.  23)  Applicant  was
unsure what was happening to them and he began drinking alcohol more often.
In  January  2016,  Applicant  went  to  the  basement  to  remind  his  17-year-old
stepson not to be “vaping” in the house, and to focus more on his studies than on sitting
around  playing  Internet  games  with  his  friends.  The  stepson  ignored  Applicant,  but
continued chatting with his friends. Applicant unplugged the television set the boy was
watching. The stepson, a wrestler, jumped on Applicant and the two wrestled. This led
to the teen suffering an injury to his lip, which bled. Applicant’s wife broke up the fracas.
Applicant  ultimately  left  the  room,  at  which  point  the  teenager  called  the  police.
Applicant  was  eventually  arrested  and  charged  with  assault.  Two  hours  later,  he
returned home.  Considering this to be an internal, domestic issue between stepfather
and  teen,  Applicant  wanted  to  contain  or  avoid  the  problem,  and  pled  guilty  to  simple
assault  in  March  2017.  He  was  sentenced  to  45  days  in  confinement  (suspended  12
months),  12  months probation  (unsupervised),  $100 fine, and  required  to  complete  an
anger  management  class.2  He  also  completed  two  months  of  substance  abuse
counseling. (Tr. 48-50)
Applicant’s  effort,  however,  did  not  help  his  eroding  relationship  with  the  teen’s
mother. Applicant and his now-estranged wife separated a week or so later. Living apart
and bored from not working, Applicant began to drink more. Then, one night in February
2016, Applicant was bored, alone, and having alcoholic beverages by himself when his
spouse asked him to come over. Hopeful at this development, he prepared to go.
Despite  the  fact  he  had  been  imbibing  and  knew  he  “wasn’t  really  in  a  good
condition to drive,” Applicant got into his car. (Tr. 29) On his way, he was pulled over by
police on his way to see her. Applicant was charged with driving while impaired (DWI)
with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level measured at 0.17. He pled guilty to the
charge in March 2017.
Since  that  time,  Applicant  does  not  consider  alcohol  to  be  a  factor  in  his  life,
although he continues to consume alcohol. (Tr. 40) He completed counseling in March
2018, where it was recommended he attend a minimum of two Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA)  meetings  a  week  in  addition  to  group  counseling.  He  attended  “a  few”  meetings,
but “it’s difficult to find one that you actually like just because of the people that are in
there,  so  I  tried  a  couple  of different ones,  recorded  it,  and that  was  it.”  (Tr. 42)   He’s
replaced boredom in his life with enjoying the nature abundant in his current region and
in  getting  to  know  his  biological  family,  whom  he  discovered  a  year  ago  in  the  same
area  in  which  he  now  lives.  (Tr.  41) These finds  have  brought  joy  to  his  life  and  have
alleviated his boredom. Now, he generally only drinks while watching sports games on
television with his brother. He is mindful not to drive after imbibing.

"Applicant admitted all allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1 through 3.2 After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of
fact.
The SOR alleges in (1.a) under Guideline D, a June 2017 arrest and an August
2017  guilty  plea  to  contributing  to  the  delinquency  of  a  minor  and  indecent  exposure.
She  was  sentenced  to  twelve  months  in  jail,  with  eleven  months  suspended  and
ordered  to  pay  fines.  It  cross  alleges  under  Guideline  J,  the  same  information  (2.a).
Under Guideline E, an amended SOR (3.a) alleges written falsifications that occurred in
January  2017  to  Applicant’s  employer  regarding  allegations  about  an  inappropriate
relationship with a minor student; (3.b) falsification of material facts during a May 2017
interview  with an investigator in failing to disclose that she participated in a sexual act
with  a  student;  and  in  another  investigative  interview  in  July  2017,  (3.c)  not  disclosing
that  after  a  minor  student  exposed  himself  to  Applicant  in  a  car,  that  nothing  further
happened when in fact she did touch him and provided oral sex.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  She  is  single  and
has one young child. She received her undergraduate degree in 2008 and her graduate
degree in 2016. (AX C, F, G, I) Applicant taught high school from 2015 to 2017, when
she was fired for alleged workplace misconduct. (GX 1) She has been employed with a
defense contractor for about one year. (Tr. 59)  She has received a number of training
certificates in cyber security and counterintelligence. (AX L)
Applicant tutored a tenth grade male student while teaching in a high school. On
one  occasion,  she  and  the  student  were  in  a  public  library  after  school.  (Tr.  21)  The
student’s ride did not appear and Applicant stated that she would take him to his home.
(Tr.  22)  Applicant  claimed  that  the  student  exposed  himself  while  in  the  car  and  he
demanded oral sex. She acknowledged that she tried to fend him off but he was bigger
than she was. She testified that he tried to force her to give him oral sex. She continued
to refuse but eventually she complied. (Tr. 23)
After an investigation by the school, Applicant received a criminal complaint from
the  police,  and  Applicant  was  charged  with  contributing  to  the  delinquency  of  a  minor
2 Before the hearing the Government amended the SOR to include Personal Conduct. It alleged three
falsifications as noted above.
and indecent exposure for the incident that occurred in May 2016. (GX 3, 4, AX H)  In
August  2017,  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  the  misdemeanor  charges.  She  received
consecutive  sentences  for  the  two  charges.  The  total  sentence  was  24  months.
Applicant was sentenced to twelve months in jail, with eleven months suspended. (AX
H)  Applicant  served  her  incarceration  on  the  weekends.    Applicant  “shall  be  of  good
behavior”  for  a  total  of  six  years  from  the  release  from  confinement.  She  has  not  had
contact with the student since the conviction. (AX H)
Applicant initially denied that the criminal incident occurred when she received a
letter  of  suspension  from  the  school  due  to  sexual  misconduct.  (Tr.  53)  She  told  her
employer  that  it  was  a  rumor  and  was  spread  on  social  media.  On  January  13,  2017
Applicant responded in writing concerning the incident.  She acknowledged that she had
tutored  the  student  and  given  him  a  ride  home.  She  did  not  disclose  any  information
about the incident of oral sex in her car. (GX 3)
During a May 12, 2017 investigative interview, Applicant described the May 2016
incident with the minor student and mentioned a social media post concerning romantic
behavior  between  Applicant  and  a  minor  student.  She  explained  that  she  was  not
involved  with  the  student.  She made  no mention of  the fact  that  she  gave  the  student
oral sex in her car. (GX 2)
On  July  26,  2017,  Applicant  was  again  interviewed  by  a  DOD investigator.  She
stated  that  the  student  exposed  himself  to  her  in  the  front  passenger  seat  of  her  car.
She explained that she told the student that was not appropriate behavior and took him
home.  Applicant further stated that nothing happened, that she did not touch him, and
she did not know why the student made up this story. (GX 2) Applicant did not receive
any counseling after this incident.
When  cross  examined  at  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  that  she  did  not
provide  the  truth  or  the  entire  story  as  it  happened  because  it  was  humiliating  and
embarrassing. (Tr. 56) During the interviews she never mentioned the oral sex.
Applicant  submitted  five  letters  of  recommendation.  Each  reference  from  a
former employer knew Applicant for at least two years and described her as honest with
a  positive  attitude.  Applicant  has  exceptional  organization  and  communication  skills.
She is reliable and motivated. One letter of recommendation commended Applicant for
her ability to encourage her students and build self-esteem. (AX A)  She attends church
and is a member of her church community. (AX I, K)

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, all with
explanations. He did not answer SOR ¶ 2.a, but it is a cross-allegation of SOR ¶ 1. He
partially admitted and partially denied SOR ¶ 2.b, with an explanation.3 His admissions
and  other  statements  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  62  years  old.  He  married  his  third  wife  in  2004.  He  has  four  adult
daughters,  one from  his first  marriage,  and  three from  his  second marriage.  He  joined
the U.S. Navy after high school. He spent about six years on active duty, from 1975 to
1981. He also served in the U.S. Navy Reserve from 1996 to 2012. He retired as a petty
officer first class (E-6). (Tr. 37-40; GE 1)
Applicant worked for defense contractor X from 2008 until he was terminated in
March  2014.  For  the  next  two  years,  he  had  sporadic  employment.  He  has  held  his
current  job,  with  a  defense  contractor,  since  February  2016.  He  has  had  a  security
clearance since 2008, and previously held one in the Navy. (GE 1; Tr. 13, 41, 94-95)
1 AE A and AE B were also attached to Applicant’s Answer.
2  AE  F  includes  certificates  of  completion  for  a  DOD  training  course,  “Sexual  Assault  Prevention  and
Response,”  from  January  2017  and  August  2018,  and  an  August  2018  certification  of  completion  for  a
gun safety course.
3 Applicant admitted the termination alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b, but denied the underlying reasons for it.
Guideline J
In  October  1998,  Applicant  and  his  second  wife  had  an  argument.  He  testified
that she was being physically combative. He said he defended himself, but also said he
believes  she  wanted  him  to  hit  back  so  she  could  press  charges.  His  eldest  daughter
was present. Applicant called police, and his wife left the house with them. She stayed
with her parents. A few days later, after she filed charges, Applicant was arrested and
charged  with  assault  and  battery  of  a  family  member.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  He  later  pled  not
guilty.  In  February  1999,  he  was  tried  and found  not  guilty  after  a bench trial,  and  the
charge was dismissed. Applicant and his second wife divorced later in 1999. (Tr. 52-54,
81-83; GE 1; AE C)
During the winter of 2015-2016, Applicant purchased a new firearm, a bolt action
rifle. He kept his firearms in a gun safe in the basement. He said friends came over to
see  his  weapons.  He  believes  that,  without  his  knowledge,  one  of  them  loaded  a
magazine  into  the  rifle  with  a  round  in  it,  and  then  put  the  rifle  back  into  the  safe.
Applicant was out of the room at the time. (Tr. 42-44, 82-87)
About a month later, in March 2016, Applicant was just getting over the flu, and
“wasn’t thinking straight.” (Tr. 132) He took the rifle out of the safe to clean it. His wife
was drifting in and out of sleep on a couch across the room. He testified, “I opened up
the safe door, took the weapon out and grabbed it. I brought my hand down to support
the stock, and my finger caught the trigger and [it] went off.” (Tr. 45, 100) The weapon’s
safety  was  not  engaged.  He  was  holding  the  weapon  upright.  He  did  not  know  it  was
loaded.  A  round  discharged  and  travelled  over  his  wife’s  feet  on  the  couch,  went
through  a  window  pane,  and  hit  a  neighbor’s  parked  car  across  the  street.  (Tr.  42-46,
82-88, 100)
Applicant’s wife “screamed and asked him what had happened.” (GE 3 at 3) After
comforting her, he went outside to see if his neighbors were all right. He could not find
the bullet. (GE 3 at 3) Neither she nor any neighbors reported the incident. He and his
wife had not been in an argument that day. (Tr. 44, 48) About a week later, a neighbor
noticed damage to her car and told Applicant about it. He paid for repairs “right away”
(about $600-$800). (Tr. 48-50)
Applicant and his wife separated in May 2016. In June 2016, she filed charges.
He  believes that  she did  so  at  the  urging  of  her  daughter,  with  whom he  does  not  get
along. (Tr. 88-90) Applicant was arrested and charged with brandishing a firearm (SOR
¶ 1.a) and reckless handling of a firearm. (SOR ¶ 1.b) (Answer; GE 1 at 36-39; GE 2;
GE  3  at  3-4;  GE  7)  He  pled  not  guilty.  His  wife  later  wanted  to  reconcile  and  she
dropped  the  charges,  which  were  dismissed  with  prejudice  in  February  2017.  She
moved back in with Applicant in May 2018, and they remain together. (Tr. 50-51, 88-93,
98-99; AE A; AE B)
Applicant acknowledged that he “broke protocol” and did not handle the weapon
safely,  in  accordance  with  his  training.  (Tr.  47)  He  said  he  should  have  looked  more
closely  to  see  if  the  weapon  was  loaded.  (Tr.  132)  He  has  been  familiar  with  firearms
since childhood. He had never had an “accidental” or “negligent” discharge of a firearm
before.  He  admitted  he  was  negligent  and  expressed  remorse.  (Tr.  46-47,  88,  97-98,
103, 138) After the hearing, he took a refresher course in gun safety. (Tr. 94; AE F)4
Guideline E
In  2014,  Applicant  was  employed  with  defense  contractor  X.  A  female  service
member  made  a  sexual  harassment  claim,  alleging  that  a  particular  employee  of
defense contractor X had made inappropriate comments to her and had asked for her
phone number. When the service member said she had a boyfriend, the worker told her
he  was  “older  and more  stable  and  could  take  care  of me.”  She also  reported that  he
touched her unnecessarily. Two other service members made statements reporting that
a contractor had also touched them unnecessarily or made inappropriate comments to
them. (Tr. 55-72; GE 6 at 1-4)
Applicant  is  not  specifically  named  in  the  statements.  However,  contractor  X’s
internal  investigation,  conducted  by  representatives  from  human  resources,  soon
centered  on  Applicant  and  another  employee,  Mr.  A,  based  on  their  age,  physical
description and  clothing.  Both men  were  interviewed  multiple  times.  The  complainants
were shown photographs of both Applicant and Mr. A, and they identified Applicant as
the employee who acted inappropriately towards them. (GE 4, 5, 6)
Several  of  Applicant’s  co-workers  told  the  company  interviewers  that  Applicant
had  a  history  of  getting  inappropriately  or  uncomfortably close  to other  people at  work
(both  men  and  women)  and  of  making  inappropriate  comments,  particularly  to  and
about women. (GE 6 at 4, 5, 6, 8) At hearing, Applicant testified that he felt that several
of  the  employees  who  made  negative  comments  about  him  during  the  company’s
investigation were racially biased against him.5
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  the  company’s  interviewers  (both  of  whom
were  women),  he  denied  making  inappropriate  comments  to  the  female  service
members and denied touching them inappropriately or unnecessarily, as alleged. (GE 6
at 7) He also speculated to the company interviewers that he was falsely accused: “It is
possible  the  females  got  together  to  collaborate  and  bring  charges  possibly  against
them;”  and  “It’s  the  gospel  truth  (when  asked  why  female  [service  members]  would
make false allegations against them). (GE 6 at 6)
According to the company’s report (which paraphrases what Applicant said to the
interviewers),  he  also  made  several  comments  to  the  interviewers  about  the  female
4 Applicant also submitted a newspaper article about an incident in which a police officer accidentally shot
and  killed  someone  during  a  professional  role-playing  exercise.  (AE  D)  Applicant  offered  the  exhibit  to
show that even for professionals with constant firearms training, “everyone makes mistakes.” (Tr. 97)

service members’ appearance: 1) “If we (HR) saw the [service member], she should be
flattered  because  she  looks  like  nothing  and  is  not  that  attractive;”6  2)  “With  regard  to
the female [service member], if we can see what she looks like she should never make
complaints  and  he  would  not  waste  his  time;”7  and  3)  “If  he  was  going  to  do  that  he
would not go after someone like that.”8
The company’s interviewers concluded that Applicant met the general description
of the subject employee, and wore specific clothing identified by the complainants. The
investigation also concluded that in his own statements, Applicant “was very open about
female  [service  members’]  behaviors  to  include  whether  they  are  attractive  or  not  and
how [they] are perceived by their male counterparts when they get rejected.” (GE 4 at 5)
The  investigation  also  noted  that  Applicant’s  co-workers  describe  him  as  one  who  is
known to make inappropriate comments to females and touch them.
The company investigation also confirmed that Applicant was trained in company
X’s code of ethics, conduct, and workplace harassment on February 10, 2014, 11 days
before  the  complaint  was  made  against  him.  Applicant  acknowledged  this  at  hearing,
and  said  he  had  gone  through  similar  harassment  training  earlier  in  his  career  at
company X. (GE 4 at 6; Tr. 74-76)
In addition, company X’s human resources substantiated that in 2009, Applicant
was  reprimanded  or  moved  to  another  workplace  for  what  was  perceived  as  acting
inappropriately towards a female employee after he spoke to her in Arabic, stared at her
and made her uncomfortable. (GE 4 at 6, 7) At hearing, Applicant acknowledged being
reprimanded but said he had been smiling at another employee and applauding her for
getting an award. He disputed that he had acted inappropriately. He recalled being told
by his supervisor to treat people with dignity and respect. Applicant told his supervisor
that he agreed but did not understand what he did wrong. (Tr. 72-74, 77-79)
The  company’s  investigation  concluded  that  the  number  of  incidents  reported
about Applicant carried greater weight than his adamant denials that he engaged in the
behavior,  making  it  more  likely  than  not  that  it  was  Applicant  who  behaved
inappropriately  towards  the  female  service  members.  (GE  4  at  5,  6)  As  a  result,  in
March  2014,  Applicant’s  employment  was  terminated,  “effective  immediately  for
violating  [contractor  X’s]  Code  of  Ethics  and  Business  Conduct  and  Workplace
Harassment policies.” Mr. A was exonerated and returned to work. (GE 4 at 7; Tr. 77)
(SOR ¶ 2.b)
Applicant reported his termination from company X, and the reason for it, on his
SCA.  (GE  1  at  14)  In  the  summary  of  his  background  interview,  he  explained  that  he

needed  access  to  a  secure  area.  When  he  saw  a  female  service  member  exit  the
compartment, he asked to access it, but this was denied. He then said he asked for a
phone number to contact supervisors who might grant him access to the space. (GE 3
at  1)  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he  provided  similar  information.  He  acknowledged
receiving  a  letter  of  termination.  He  said  his  termination  was  “due  to  allegations  of
sexual harassment,” which he denied “to the fullest extent.” (Answer)
At  hearing,  Appellant  denied  making  sexually  suggestive  comments  to  the
service members, or anything that might be construed as such. (Tr. 62-63) He did not
acknowledge  any  specific  action  he  allegedly  took,  or  any  specific  statement  he
allegedly  said,  to  the  female  service  members.  (Tr.  79-81)  He  stressed  several  times
during his testimony that he felt he had been wrongly accused, both by other contractor
employees (Tr. 60-61) and the female service members. (Tr. 100-101, 138)9
Applicant  testified  that  his  current  employer  “has  provided  classes  for  sexual
harassment and workspace ethics, and I have taken it, and I understand it, and I adhere
to  it.”  (Tr.  96) He  submitted documentation of his  training  after the  hearing.  (AE  F) He
also testified that he worked with women on active duty, mentored them and considered
them  “like  my  sisters.”  He  also  worked  with  female  customers  in  his  current  job,  and
“I’ve never had any complaints. I’ve had a lot of praises.” (Tr. 101)
Applicant’s supervisor testified that he has known and supervised Applicant since
February 2016. The witness has held his position, with a clearance, for eight years. He
works with Applicant on a daily basis. He has never witnessed Applicant engage in any
inappropriate  behavior,  nor  is  he  aware  that Applicant  has done  so.  He has  not  heard
that  Applicant  has  ever  made  any  lewd  or  improper  comments.  Applicant  “always
seems to go out of his way” to be professional. He has never had to counsel Applicant.
Applicant  has  been  through  sexual  harassment  training,  as  required.  Prior  to  the
hearing,  he  was  aware  of  the firearms  charges  but  not  the  other allegations.  (Tr.  105-
113)
Another witness, a longtime close friend, has known Applicant for 18 years, since
they served together in the Navy Reserve. They are also former co-workers. The friend
has  had  a  clearance  for  many  years.  He  has  never  seen  Applicant  treat  people  with
anything  other  than  courtesy  and  respect.  He  took  care  to  stress  that  he  has  no
personal  knowledge  of  the  allegations  in  this  case,  other  than  what  Applicant  has told
him, since he was not there when they occurred. (Tr. 114-123, 129)
Both  men  are  experienced  and  practiced  gun  owners.  They  have  gone  to  the
shooting  range  together,  and  he  is  not  aware  that  Applicant  has  ever  had  any  other

negligent  discharges.  He  does  not  believe  Applicant  discharged
maliciously. (Tr. 127-129)
9  Applicant  also  submitted  an  academic  article  to  bolster  his  view  that  that  women  make  false  sexual
allegations. (AE E)
The friend testified that sometimes a person might say something that could be
misinterpreted  or  misconstrued  by  the  person  who  heard  the  comment.  He  attributed
this,  in  part,  to  generational  differences.  He  acknowledged,  however,  that  that  is  why
sexual  harassment  and  ethics  training  exists,  to  allow  protections  in  the  system  for
complainants, so they can address such issues with their supervisor. (Tr. 124-125)
The  friend  is  not  aware  of  anything  Applicant  has  said  of  a  sexual  nature  that
might  be  misconstrued  by  someone  who  heard  the  comment.  The  friend  never
witnessed  Applicant  being  counseled  or  reprimanded  for  making  physical  contact  that
was  “not  well  received.”  (Tr.  126)  The  actions  that  led  to  Applicant’s  termination,
however, are “way out of his character.” (Tr. 114-123, 128)

Paragraph 1 Guideline F – Financial Considerations   The Government alleges that the
Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  six  separate  creditors  totaling
approximately $15,000 in debts, and $12,000 in traffic fines owed to a state for a total of
$27,000.  In his Answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.
Credit  reports  of  the  Applicant  dated  September  22,  2016;  December  1,  2018;  and
October  11,  2018,  reflect  that  each  of  these  debts  were  owing  at  one  point.
(Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.)
Applicant admits that he made many poor decisions, financial and other wise, as
a  teenager  and  young  adult.    He  hung  around  the  wrong  group  of  people  and  got
himself into a lot of trouble with the law.  In 2009, when he was charged with Burglary,
he went to jail for two days and realized that he needed to change his life before it was
too  late.    Since  then  Applicant  has  been  working  to  improve  himself  and  to  show
responsibility and good judgment.
Applicant lives with his parents.  He pays rent of $600 monthly to his parents.  He
also makes his car payments of $335 each month on time, his cell phone bill of $120 a
month, and pays his insurance on a regular basis.  Applicant explained that his financial
problems began when, as a full-time student, he was in a motorcycle accident and had
three broken bones.  He was taken to the emergency room with no medical insurance.
He  was  billed  accordingly.    Applicant  was  unaware  that  he  could  have  qualified  for
emergency  care  or  Medi-Cal.    As  a  result  of  this  accident,  Applicant  fell  behind  on
several of the debts listed in the SOR.
In  July  2017,  Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer.    He  enjoys  his
work and is well liked.  He currently bring home between $3,000 and $3,200 a month.
Since 2017, he has been working diligently to resolve his delinquent debt.  He borrowed
some money from his mother to resolve his delinquent medical debts and has already
repaid her with his refunds from his income tax returns.
The following delinquent debts listed in the SOR became owing and are now paid
off in full, or are being paid in regular systematic monthly payments.
1.a.  Applicant  was  indebted  to  a  creditor  for  an  account  placed  for  collection  in  the
approximate amount of $2,477.  This was for his bail bond.  Applicant has paid the debt
off in full. (Tr. pp. 38-39 and Applicant’s Exhibit H.)
1.b.    Applicant  was  indebted  to  a  creditor  for  a  medical  account  that  was  placed  for
collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $90.    This  was  a  medical  bill  from  the
motorcycle accident.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 39 and Applicant’s
Exhibit I.)
1.c.   Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a medical account placed for collection in
the  approximate  amount  of  $4,771.    This  was  a  medical  bill  from  the  motorcycle
accident.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 40 and Applicant’s Exhibit J.)
1.d.    Applicant  was  indebted  to  a  creditor  for  a  medical  account  that  was  placed  for
collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $5,260.    This  was  a  medical  bill  form  the
motorcycle accident.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 40 and Applicant’s
Exhibit K.)
1.e.  Applicant was indebted to a state for traffic fines assessed against him in 2014 for
an  account  that  was  placed  for  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $1,260.    This
was for unpaid traffic tickets and interest.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p.
41 and Applicant’s Exhibit M.)
1.f.  Applicant was indebted to a  state for traffic fines assessed against him in 2017 in
the  approximate  amount  of  $878.    This  was  for  unpaid  traffic  tickets  and  interest.
Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 41 and Applicant’s Exhibit M.)
Paragraph  2  Guideline  J  –  Criminal  Conduct      The  Government  alleges  that  the
Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal activity that creates
doubt about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.
Applicant also engaged in a litany of criminal activity over the past fifteen years.
He  has  no  excuses  for  this  misconduct.    He  was  simply  immature  and  irresponsible.
(Government Exhibits 6, 7 and 8.)
2.a.  In June 2001, Applicant was charged with Drunk in Public.  Applicant denies this
incident.  He was only in junior high school at the time.  (Tr. pp. 44 - 45.)  This allegation

this  time  to  possess  a  driver’s  license.    (Tr.  p.  45.)    This  allegation  is  found  for  the
Applicant.
2.c.    In  about  November  2005,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driving  While  on  a
Suspended  License.    Applicant  denies  the  incident.    He  did  not  receive  a  Driver’s
License until he was eighteen years old in 2010.  (Tr. p. 46)  This allegation is found for
the Applicant.
2.d.    In  about  June  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Possession  of  Marijuana.

2.g.    In  about  October  2009,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Burglary,  Selling  Marijuana,
and Driving Without a License.  Applicant explained that when he was arrested he had
$600  in  his pocket because he  had  just been  paid at  work where  he  cleaned  carpets.
He was arrested for burglary because he and his friends were breaking into cars.  As a
result of this offense, Applicant served two days in jail.  (Tr. pp. 51-54.)

to drive on a suspended license.  (Tr. pp. 55-57.)
2.j.    In  about  October  2013,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driving  Without  a  License.
Applicant  stated  that  he  lost  his  license  due  to  the  number  of  speeding  violations  he
had.  He currently has a valid driver’s license.  He has not had a traffic violation of any
sort for the past five years.  (Tr. pp. 58.)
2.k.    In  about  January  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driving  with  a  Suspended

2.l.    In  April  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Failure  to  Provide  a  Child  Restraint,
Failure  to  Appear.    Applicant  denies  this  allegation  as  he  states  that  this  has  never
occurred.  (Tr. p. 60.)

"Applicant is 27 years old, single, and has no children. He received a high school
diploma in June 2010, and he has attended some college courses. He has worked for a
defense contractor since June 2016, and this is his first security clearance application.
Applicant  started  using  and  purchasing  marijuana  in  2010,  when  he  was
approximately 18 years old. He has admitted to using and purchasing marijuana until at
least May 2016.
In  September  2012,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of  an
illegal substance with the intent to distribute. He disclosed this arrest in his June 2016
SCA. The charges were ultimately dismissed. (Item 4 at 15-16)
The arresting officers noted that they saw a passenger in Applicant’s car pass him
a joint of marijuana, and Applicant admitted that he used marijuana while operating his
vehicle. They detected a strong odor of marijuana when they approached Applicant’s car.
The  officers  found  several  discarded  marijuana  roaches,  a  burning  marijuana  joint,
multiple  baggies  of  marijuana,  and  other  drug-related  paraphernalia  in  Applicant’s  car.
The two other individuals in the car were also arrested, and one admitted to the arresting
officers that he had recently been arrested for selling marijuana. (Item 6)
In his PSI, Applicant claimed two individuals paid him to give them a ride in his car.
When the police searched his car they found a bag of marijuana, it did not belong to him,
but he was aware it was in his vehicle. The charges against Applicant were dropped after
the presiding judge determined that the search and seizure during the arrest was illegal.
(Item 4 at 15-16)
Applicant did not disclose his history of using and purchasing marijuana in his June
2016 SCA. (Item 3 at 35) During his September 2017 PSI, Applicant told the government
investigator that he purchased and smoked three to five joints of marijuana a week from
September 2010 until May 2016. He did not list this information on his SCA, because he
was concerned he would lose his job. Additionally, he told the investigator that he does
not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Item 4 at 16-17)

"Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact:  Applicant is 68 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1973, and
a master’s degree in 1978. He married in 1973 and adopted two children, now adults,
from his wife’s previous marriage. They also have an adult child from their union. One of
his adult children has special needs. Applicant served in the U.S. Army for 22 years in
the Air Defense Artillery, including multiple overseas deployments. He retired in 1996 at
the rank of lieutenant colonel. Immediately after his retirement, he was employed by a
DOD  contractor.  He  has  worked  for  this  DOD  contractor  for  nearly  23  years.  He
currently  possesses  a  DOD  security  clearance.  Applicant  has  received  several
certificates,  letters  of  appreciation,  and  favorable  employee  evaluations  during  the
course of his employment. (Tr. 21-25; GE 1; AE H, AE I, AE J)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  in  February  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged
with  four  counts  of  felony  theft  for  stealing  luggage  from  the  local  airport  between
November 2013 and February 2014. Applicant  admitted this allegation  in his response
to  the  SOR.  During  the  hearing,  Applicant  admitted  his  arrest  but  denied  stealing  any
bags. He mistakenly took a bag in the local airport on the day of his arrest, but it was
never his intent to steal it. He claimed the other three pieces of stolen luggage he was
charged with did not involve him. (Tr. 26)
In  December  2015,  Applicant  participated  in  a  background  interview  with  an
authorized  DOD  investigator.  When  questioned  about  his  February  4,  2014  arrest,
Applicant stated that he flew into the local airport of State A for a work assignment. He
took  his  two  checked  bags  from  the  luggage  carousel  and  left  the  airport.  He  soon
realized  he  forgot  to  retrieve  a  carry-on  bag  that  he  was  unable  to  fit  in  the  overhead
compartment when he boarded the airplane. He stated this bag had been checked with
the  airplane’s  cargo.  He  did  not  receive  a  claim  tag  for  this  bag.  Applicant  called  the
airline  to  see  if  his  bag  was  at  the  airport.  The  airline  had  difficulties  tracking  his  bag
since he did not check it in at the airline counter and the bag was never tagged with a
claim tag. (Emphasis added) A couple days later the airline called him to report several
unclaimed bags had arrived and requested Applicant to come to the airport to see if one
of the bags belonged to him. (Tr. 48; GE 2)
During the background interview, Applicant told the investigator that he arrived at
the  airport  at  approximately  6:00  p.m.  He  came  in  from  the  outside  door  near  the
luggage  area  and  found  what  he  thought  was  his  bag  and  walked  away.  He  was
stopped  by  the  police  and  questioned  about  the  bag  in  his  possession.  He  told  the
officer  it  was  his  bag,  but  after  further  examination,  it  was  determined  to  be  another
individual’s bag. He is legally blind in his right eye and believed this contributed to him
picking up the wrong bag. He was taken by the police to a holding room for questioning.
Applicant  had  flown  into  this  airport  on  countless  occasions  for  his  employer.  Police
reviewed  security  tapes  and  matched  him  with  three  other  earlier  incidents  where
luggage had been stolen from the airport. In addition, police noted that on each of these
occasions, the suspected thief had come from the outside door to the luggage area with
a luggage cart instead of coming directly from the flight arrival gate. The police obtained
a  search  warrant  of  his  hotel  room,  but  they  did  not  find  any  incriminating  evidence.
Despite the search warrant result and Applicant’s explanations, the police charged him
with four felony counts of theft. (GE 2)
Applicant hired a local attorney. He did not want to plead guilty to the charges as
he was “in no way involved in the theft of luggage.” His attorney advised him that if he
did go to trial, Applicant would have to pay him an additional $10,0001 in legal fees, and
he also indicated the case could drag out for two years or longer. The state’s attorney
offered a plea bargain. The agreement included conditions that Applicant pay the airline
restitution  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $3,000,  and  perform  24  hours  of  community
service. After he fulfilled the terms of the agreement, the court would place the charges
on the Stet docket. If Applicant did not accept the plea bargain, the DA would proceed
with  the  criminal  trial.  Since  Applicant  claimed  this  was  the  most  cost-effective  and
expedient  way  to  handle  the  situation,  he  accepted  the  plea  bargain  and  fulfilled  the
specified conditions. (Tr. 38, 58; GE 2)
The  police  records  showed  the  airline  reported  a  suitcase  was  stolen  on
November  17,  2013.  The  detective  reviewed  video  footage  of  the  luggage  area  which
showed a white male removing the bag and leaving the terminal. Another theft occurred
on  November  19,  2013.  The  same  white  male  was  witnessed  on  the  video  footage,
about  50  years  old,  wearing  dark  colored  shoes,  light  jeans,  and  a  dark  colored  waist
length  jacket,  taking  a  blue  suitcase  that  was  reported  as  stolen.  The  surveillance
footage showed that on both occasions, the male suspect did not walk to the baggage
claim from the airline gate. Instead, the male suspect  entered the baggage claim area
from the outside door with a luggage cart to retrieve the suitcases. The police placed a
bulletin  of  the  male  suspect’s  photo  for  the  airline  employees  to  call  police  if  he  was
seen in the baggage area. There were no thefts of luggage reported from November 21,
2013 through February 1, 2014. (GE 5)
1 Applicant later said he had paid $7,000 for his attorney, and if he went to trial, he would have to pay an
additional $13,000-$15,000. (Tr. 58)
On  approximately  February  2,  2014,  an  airline  representative  notified  a  police
detective  that  a  bag  was  stolen  from  the  baggage  carousel.  The  surveillance  video
showed the same male suspect that was posted on the November 2013 bulletin. On this
date,  he  was  wearing  a  dark  blue  peacoat  and  blue  jeans.  On  February  4,  2014,  an
airline  employee  called  a  police  detective  to  report  that  the  male  suspect  from  the
bulletin  was  back  at  the  baggage  area,  wearing  a  blue  coat  and  blue  jeans.  At
approximately  2:00  p.m.,  the  detective  located  the  male  suspect  in  the  hourly  garage,
with a luggage cart that had a black Samsonite roller suitcase, without a claim tag. The
male suspect told the detective that he flew in yesterday and had returned to the airport
to claim his lost bag. (Tr. 52; GE 5)
While  the  detective  was  talking  with  Applicant,  a  phone  call  came  in  that  a
passenger  could  not  locate  his  black  roller  suitcase,  and  he  told  the  airline  his  name
card was located on the outside of the bag. The detective inspected the roller suitcase
that  was  on  Applicant’s  luggage  cart  which  showed  the  victim’s  name  card  on  the
outside of the bag. The police found the victim’s airline claim tag in a trash can inside
the  hourly  garage.  Applicant  was  apprehended  by  the  police  for  questioning.  After
reviewing Applicant’s travel itinerary, the police discovered Applicant had been in State
A during the two incidents of luggage theft in November 2014, and the earlier incident of
luggage  theft  on  February  2,  2014.  Applicant  was  charged  with  four  felony  counts  of
theft. (Tr. 52; GE 5)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  asked  about  the  circumstances  which  led  to  his
arrest.  On  February  2,  2014,  Applicant  carried  his  bag,  filled  with  books,  when  he
boarded  the  airplane.  It  would  not  fit  in  the  overhead  compartment,  and  the  airline
attendant checked his bag without placing an airline claim tag on it. When he exited the
airplane,  Applicant  assumed  his  bag  would  be  in  the  aisle,  but  it  was  not  there.  He
asked  the  flight  attendant  about  the  checked  bag,  and  he  was  informed  that  his  bag
would be located at the baggage claim. He also explained that he never carries his bags
for two reasons: (1) he has a bad back, and on the day of his arrest, (2) his lost carry-on
bag was filled with books, so it was heavy.2 Applicant found his two checked suitcases,
but  his  carry-on  bag  was  not  there.  He  reported  his  bag  missing  to  the  airline  and
provided  his  phone  number.  Since  his  bag  had  not  been  tagged,  the  airline  could  not
track it. He was told that his bag may arrive on a later flight, and they would give him a
call. On the day of his arrest, he claimed he received a call from the airline letting him
know  his bag  may  be there, but  they  did  not  know  for certain  since  his  bag was  not
tagged. (Emphasis added) (Tr. 26-30, 32, 35)
Applicant believed he was identified on the video footage near the baggage claim
on  dates  he  did  not  fly  on  the  airline,  which  also  included  some  of  the  dates  the
suitcases  were  stolen,  because  he  had  visited  the  USO  in  the  airport  to  acquire  free
drinks, snacks, and he enjoyed talking with families. He did not provide any USO sign-in
sheets  to  corroborate  his  claim.  On  the  day  of  his  arrest,  Applicant  admitted  he  had

2014.
removed the  airline  tag  from the  suitcase.  Applicant  described  himself  as  being  a  little
obsessive.   Whenever  he  retrieves  his  suitcase, he  immediately  rips  off  all of the  tags
and  throws  them  away.  This  always  has  been  his  consistent  habit  when  traveling.
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  witness  statements  to  corroborate  his  claim.  (Tr.  39-41,
53, 60-61)
Applicant’s salary  with  his current  employer is approximately  $260,000.  He  was
asked  why,  with  his  significant  income,  he  would  not  pay  the  additional  money  to  his
attorney to fight the felony theft charges that were filed against him. Applicant claimed
that his income in 2014 was significantly lower, about $140,000 to $150,000. (Emphasis
added)  When  questioned  about  this  substantial  difference  in  salary  from  the  same
employer,  Applicant  said  it  was  due  to  him  not  receiving  bonuses  in  2014.  He  then
stated  that  his  decision  to  accept  the  plea  bargain  was  not  fully  financially  based.  He
also  consulted  with  his  lawyer,  family,  and  after  management’s  assertion  that  his
acceptance  of  the  plea  bargain  would  not  hurt  him  in  any  way,  he  took  the  deal.  I
requested Applicant provide a copy of his filed 2014 tax return while the record was held
open for 30 days. The requested 2014 tax return was provided on February 3, 2019. It
showed, in part, that Applicant’s annual income was $233,424, plus taking into account
his  annual  pensions  and  annuities  of  $52,817,  he  had  a  combined  total  income  of
$287,466 for 2014. (Emphasis added) (Tr. 63-66; AE K, AE L)

In  March  2002,  Applicant  went  out  and  ordered  some  take-out  food.  He  and  a
delivery person, with whom he previously had a disagreement, exchanged words. The
delivery  person  then  cursed  at  Applicant.  Applicant  went  indoors  to  complain  to
management.  Soon,  Applicant  was  confronted  by  seven  individuals  from  the  take-out
and  a  fracas  arose.  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  simple  assault,  a
misdemeanor,  but  the  matter  was  dismissed.  (Tr.  37-38)  This  was  noted  on  his  July
2011 e-QIP.
In April 2003, someone was arrested and charged with marijuana possession in
a state near Applicant’s state of residence. That individual was found guilty in absentia
in  July  2003. (see SOR  allegation  1.e) Through  some  confusion,  the named  individual
and Applicant have been assumed to be one and the same. Applicant was adamant he
was not the individual named in the case. He sought out clarification on the matter, and
after  fingerprint  verification,  it  was  determined  that  Applicant  was  not  the  person
arrested and tried. (Tr. 36; Ex. F-1) Because the charge was in error and subsequently
resolved, Applicant did not note this incident on his e-QIP.
In  around  October  2004,  Applicant  and  his  now  ex-wife  had  a  “situation  .  .  .
where  things  got  a  little  bit  out  of  hand.  We  were  arguing.  She  hit  me  in  my  nose.  I
grabbed her by her arms, left some marks on her arm. Police were called.” (Tr. 33) The
spouses  were  charged  with  domestic  assault  (battery).  The  matter  was  ultimately
dismissed. Based on what he was told during these processes, Applicant was under the
impression the matter would be deleted from his record and there would be no need to
report the incident on his e-QIP. (Tr. 35)
In  late  2007,  Applicant  and  that  same  ex-wife  were  still  married.  He  was  fresh
back from a deployment, the marriage was suffering, and he was relegated to sleeping
on  the  couch.  One  day  in  July  2007,  he  was  awakened  to  his  child  screaming.  He
discovered  his  spouse  hurting  the  child.  A  fight  ensued  and  Applicant  shoved  his
spouse  hard.  The  police  were  called  and  Applicant  was  arrested  for  second  degree
domestic  assault  in  November  2007.  This  matter  was  also  dismissed.  Although  there
was no conviction, Applicant reported the incident in his July 2011 e-QIP. (Tr. 33; Ex. 1
at 34 of 39) Today, the former spouses are “actually, like, best friends. . . .” (Tr. 34)
In January 2010, during a New Year’s Day party, Applicant was mildly intoxicated
and punch was spilled on his clothes. Applicant borrowed a friend’s jacket to wear, not
knowing there was a controlled substance (amphetamines) in the pocket. Applicant was
later  questioned  about  loitering,  and  the  pills  were  found  by  the  authorities.  He  was
charged  with  possession  of  the  drugs.  He  explained  his  situation.  The  possession
charge was ultimately dropped in favor of the charge of loitering, a matter he disclosed
in  his  2011  e-QIP,  at  page  33  of  39,  where  he  referenced  the  original  charge  for
possession of a controlled substance. (Ex. 1 at 32 of 39; Tr. 29-30)
In May 2016, Applicant was with a female friend and his brother after driving to a
social venue. Applicant left his cell phone in the car. As he went back to retrieve it, he
saw  his  brother  being  attacked  and  his  friend  calling  his  name.  (Tr.  23-24)  Applicant
interceded in the tussle and was eventually  arrested for simple assault/robbery, felony
criminal  charges.  He  noted  the  related  charges  on  his  more  recent  2016  e-QIP  at
Section 22.  (Ex.  2  at 35  of 42; Tr.  23-24)  The  case  was  ultimately  dismissed  after  his
brother’s trial resulted in a not guilty determination. (Tr. 41)
On  July  26,  2016,  Applicant  executed  an  e-QIP  (Ex.  2).  Although  he  disclosed
the most recent event from May 2016 under e-QIP “Section 22 – Police Record,” he did
not  list  any  of  the  earlier  incidents  previously  reported  on  his  2011  e-QIP. This  is  true
regarding  questions  inquiring  about  whether,  in  the  past  seven  years,  he  had  been
issued a summons; been arrested, charged, convicted, or sentenced to a crime; or been
on probation. It is also true with regard to the questions inquiring whether, in his lifetime,
he  had  ever  been  convicted  in  any  U.S.  court  of  a  crime;  charged  with  a  felony;
convicted  of  an  offense  involving  domestic  violence  or  crime  of  violence;  or  been
charged  with  any  offense  involving  firearms,  drugs,  or  alcohol.  Having  disclosed  all
incidents  in  2011,  except  for  the  mistaken  charge  from  2003  and  the  2004  domestic
dismissal  he  was  led  to  believe  would  be  expunged  and  not  in  need  of  reporting,
Applicant limited his disclosures in 2016 to the newest incident from May 2016. He was
under  the  impression  that  expunged  or  soon  to  be  expunged  charges  need  not  be
reported. (Tr. 35) Having listed the older incidents before, he had no intention of trying
to mislead or obfuscate. (see Tr. 39)
Since  the  last  incident,  Applicant  has  successfully  completed  an  anger
management  course.  He  takes  the  path  of  avoidance  in  the  presence  of  potential
conflict. He has never been disciplined at work, where he is a valued employee. He was
pleased to receive a promotion two years ago. He has healed his relationship with his
ex-wife, with whom multiple alleged criminal issues arose.

"Applicant is 40 years old, and is married with five children.  He has a high school
diploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer Technician Level IV.
He  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  employment.
Applicant began working for his current employer in November 2005.
Guideline J – Criminal Conduct
The Government alleges that the Applicant has engaged in criminal activity that
creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.
Guideline G – Alcohol Consumption
The  Government  alleges  that  the  Applicant  has  engaged  in  excessive  alcohol
consumption, which often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure
to  control  impulses,  and  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  alcohol  abuse.    On  three  occasions  over  the  past
twenty  years,  he  has  been  arrested  for  Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol  (DUI).
Two  of  the  arrests  involved  car  accidents  caused  by  the  Applicant  as  a  result  of  his
impairment.  During his personal subject interview on November 9, 2017, Applicant told
the investigator that he continues to consume alcohol and then operates motor vehicles
while impaired.
Applicant stated that he began consuming alcohol at the young age of 14.  When
he started, he was drinking maybe four or five beers on the weekend.  (Tr.  p. 18.)  By
age  18,  through  his  mid-20’s,  he  was  consuming  alcohol  once  or  twice  a  week,  and
each time he drank to the point of intoxication.
In September 1997, Applicant was first arrested and charged with DUI.  Applicant
was  arrested  after  he  struck  a  parked  vehicle.    His  blood  alcohol  level  was  .18.
Applicant states that he was leaving a gathering with some friends and  had consumed
about 16 beers over a period of 6 hours.  He smashed the front passenger side of his
vehicle.  After he was arrested, he was taken to jail.  His license was suspended and he
was fined approximately $700.  He was also required to complete a driver’s education
class.    (Tr.  p.  21.)      Applicant  states  that  following  this  DUI,  he  stopped  drinking  for
about a month.  He then returned to his regular drinking pattern.
In  January  2001,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI.    This  time  he
rear  ended  another  vehicle  at  a  stop  light.    At  the  time  of  his  arrest,  Applicant  blood
alcohol level was .2.  Applicant explained that he was coming from a co-workers house
where  he  had  consumed  about  20  beers  over  a  period  of  six  hours.    Applicant  was
found guilty of the charge.  His driver’s license was suspended for a year, he was fined
$1,300  that  he  completed  with  community  service,  he  was  required  to  attend  20
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and also a driver’s education class.  Applicant states
that  he  completed  all  of  the  courts  requirements.    (Tr.  p.  24.)    Following  this  arrest,
Applicant stopped drinking for about two months.  (Tr. p. 25.)
In  November  2009,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI  a  third  time.
Applicant  was  pulled  over  for  speeding  and  the  police  smelled  alcohol  on  his  breath.
Applicant was tested for DUI and had a blood alcohol level of .09.  He was coming from
a friend’s house where he had consumed between six and eight beers.  Applicant states
that  because  the  police  officer  moved  and  could  not  testify  in  court  the  matter  was
dismissed on a technicality.  (Tr. p. 27.)  He admits that he was intoxicated at the time of
the arrest.  When Applicant was asked by the Department Counsel, why drink and still
get behind the wheel?  Applicant responded that, “Just – I just feel sometimes I gotta  --
I gotta go.  And I just - - and I just go.”  (Tr. p. 27.)
Applicant  testified  that  the  last  time he drank  and  got behind  the wheel to drive
was within the last six months before the hearing.  (Tr. p. 29.)  Applicant states that he
does  not  plan  on  ruling  out  his  drinking  in  the  future,  but  because  there  are  other
options available such has Lyft service he plans to use that more to keep himself from
drinking and driving.  (Tr. p. 30.)

"In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  raised  under
both  guidelines.  He  is  42  years old.  As of  the  date  of the  hearing,  he had  never been
married and he has three children. (Tr.20)
Applicant earned a  bachelor’s degree in computer information systems in 2015,
and a graduate degree in business administration in 2017. He served on active duty in
the  U.S.  Army  from  2004  until  2015.  Since  2015,  he  has  served  in  the  Reserve.
Applicant has worked with his current employer since 2018. He has held a DOD security
clearance for many years. (GE 1)
In  about  November  2002,  Applicant  was  charged  with  assault  on  a  female.  He
and  his  girlfriend  at  the  time  were  in  a  car  and  had  a  heated  argument.  As  he  was
exiting  the  car,  his  girlfriend  hit  him  in  the  back  of  his  head,  and  he  turned  back  and
struck her in the face. (Tr.33, GE 3) She called the police and Applicant was charged.
However,  the  girlfriend  admitted  that  she  struck  Applicant  first  and  the  case  was
dismissed.  At  that  time,  a  restraining  order was  put  in  place.  The  couple  reunited  and
were driving when stopped by the police a year late in 2003. Applicant was arrested for
violating a restraining order. He and his girlfriend had been back in their relationship for
some time and the issue of the restraining order did not occur to them. They were both
at fault, but Applicant was sent to jail for 48 hours. (Tr. 35) Applicant’s girlfriend became
the mother of his child. They now have an amicable relationship, although they are not
together. Applicant reports that she is a great mother. (Tr. 36) His former girlfriend wrote
a letter of recommendation for him. (AE F-2)  She recounted the details of the domestic
incident in 2002, but stated that Applicant has been a great father to their son and is a
trustworthy person. She recommends him for the security clearance. (SOR 1.a-1.b)
After these incidents, Applicant entered the military, earned a security clearance
and  served  abroad.  He  obtained  many  medals  and  achievement  awards.  His  record
reflects  his  excellent  career  in  the  military.  (AE  1-12)  On  his  initial  security  clearance
application, he disclosed the above two domestic incidents.
In July 2014, Applicant was dating another woman. They were driving home from
a  vacation  with  his  son  and  her  child  in  a  rental  car.  He  had  been  driving  while  his
girlfriend  was  sleeping.  At  some  point,  they  engaged  in  a  heated  argument.  (GE  2)
Applicant  returned  the  rental  car  and  he  and  his  girlfriend  proceeded  to  drive  to  her
home in her car. His car was parked in her garage. When they arrived, she prevented
him from entering the garage to get his car and keys. Applicant went in to her garage to
get  his  car  and  keys.  (Tr.  63  )  According  to  the  security  report  (GE  5)  she  repeatedly
grabbed him and once he was in the home and obtained his keys to leave, she blocked
the door and repeatedly grabbed him around the legs. (Tr. 38) Applicant pushed her off
and  she  fell.  The  girlfriend  called  the  police  and  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged
with  2nd  degree  assault,  reckless  endangerment  and  burglary.  (GE  7) When  Applicant
went to court, the burglary charge was dismissed and the domestic violence charge was
changed  to  reckless  endangerment.  (GE  6)  Applicant  was  given  eighteen  months  of
probation that ended in 2016. (GE 2) This charge has been expunged from his record.
He was ordered to attend anger management classes from September 2014 to March
2016. This incident was reported to his commander. (GE 2) He ended the relationship
with this woman after this incident. (Tr. 39)
In  January  2016,  Applicant  had  an  encounter  with  a  woman  who  was  renting  a
room  from  him.  She  started  renting  in  2015.  He  stated  that  they  were  not  in  a
relationship  but  had  sex.  (Tr.  40)  He  was  charged  with  assault  on  a  family  member
because  she  called  the  police  and  reported  that  Applicant  had  straddled  her,  grabbed
her, and shook her. (GE 9) Applicant was dating another woman and the woman who
was renting a room from him was jealous. On February 22, 2016, the woman withdrew
her statements about the incident and the case was dismissed. (GE 9)
Applicant‘s  fiancée  testified  at  the  hearing.  She  has  known  him  for  about  two
years. They do not live with each other. She has met his family and Applicant has met
her  daughter.  They  plan  to  marry.  She  has  never  seen  any  violent  behavior  in  their
relationship. (Tr. 100) She is aware of the SOR allegations and they have discussed the
various incidents.
Applicant  submitted  about  16  character  references  and  affidavits  from  military
personnel, colleagues and friends who have known him a long time. Each letter attests
to his honesty, reliability and overall integrity. (AE F 1-10)
Applicant  testified  credibly  at  the  hearing  that  he  was  quite  young  when  the
incidents occurred in 2002 and 2003. The woman from those incidents is the mother of
his child and believes him to be a good family man. She wrote a letter of reference for
him. They maintain a good relationship for the sake of their child.
There  were  no  incidents  of  any  kind for almost  11  years.  Applicant  dated many
people  and  was  not  always  using  good  judgment  in  the  relationship  at  times.  He  has
taken  more  anger  management  classes  and  has  learned  to  walk  away  from  certain
situations.  He  explained  that  he  knows  how  to  avoid  conflict.  He  is  in  a  stable
relationship with a mature woman who he hopes to marry.

however, the physical diploma was lost, and despite “back and forth” between Applicant
and  the  university,  he  was  unable  to  get  another  copy  of  the  diploma.  (Tr.  27-28)  In
December 2011, he received a technical information technology certification. (Tr. 25) He
intends to complete another “year or so” of classes so he can receive another bachelor’s

Sexual Behavior
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in April 1991, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP)
for  four  acts  of  voyeurism,  in  violation  of  Article  134,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice
(UCMJ). A military police report indicates a person generally fitting Applicant’s description
was inside the female shower area looking at female soldiers coming out of or inside the
showers on four occasions from December 26, 1990, to January 17, 1991. (GE 11 at 5-
7) He received company grade NJP of forfeiture of 7 days of pay, reduction from specialisr
to private first class, 14 days of restriction, and 14 days of extra duty. (GE 11 at 4) In May
1991, Applicant wrote a statement addressed to his company commander in which he
admitted he had a problem with voyeurism; he traced his problem to sexual abuse when
he was a child and unresolved anger; he wanted therapy; and he requested a discharge
from the Army. (GE 11 at 2-3) At his hearing, he said he was outside someone’s room
looking in, and he viewed people inappropriately on two or three occasions. (Tr. 58) He
said he was caught each time he did it. (Tr. 58) He received some therapy before he was
discharged from the Army. (Tr. 60) In August 1991, he received a general discharge under
honorable  conditions  for  misconduct.  After  he  was  discharged  from  the  Army  and
continuing until the middle of 1993, he received therapy to recognize and resist triggers
for voyeurism. (Tr. 62) The triggers to his desire for voyeurism were emotional extremes
such as becoming too angry, hungry, or lonely. (Tr. 62)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  in  April  1994,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  four
counts of aggravated sexual battery. Applicant said that because he was angry about his
life, particularly his lack of financial success and low-paying employment, he “graduated”
from  voyeurism  to  “frottage.”  (Tr.  63)  According  to  the  Merriam-Webster  Dictionary,
frottage is “the act of obtaining sexual stimulation by rubbing against a person or object.”
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frottage.  Applicant  said  he  was  in  a  club,
and  someone  touched  a  woman  inappropriately  on  her  rear.  (Tr.  64)  He  may  have
bumped her. (Tr. 64) She accused Applicant of touching her inappropriately, and he was
arrested  and  charged  with  sexual  assault.  (Tr.  64)  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  sexual
assault.  (Tr.  64)  In  his  SOR  response,  he  said,  “Against  my  own  desire,  I  touched  a
woman inappropriately in a public place.” At his hearing, he denied that he touched her
touched  one  woman
inappropriately.
inappropriately; however, he denied that he touched the other three women. (Tr. 66) He
said  that  “[o]ut  of  camaraderie,  they  all  said  that  I  did.”  (Tr.  66)1  He  conceded  that  he
pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault on four women. (Tr. 67-68) He claimed he
only touched one woman, and the touching was unintentional and not sexual. (Tr. 67-68)
He  pleaded  guilty  because  the  prosecutor  reduced  the  four  felony-level  aggravated
sexual battery charges to four misdemeanor-level sexual battery charges. (Tr. 68-69) He
(Tr.  65)  He  subsequently  admitted  he

Applicant said in 1992 or 1995, he was walking on the street and touched a woman’s breast. (GE 2 at 15)
He did not realize he touched the woman’s breast. (GE 2 at 15) In his November 15, 2016 OPM PSI, he
said that the act was not intentional or conscious. (GE 2 at 21) He was arrested for sexual assault. (GE 2

SOR ¶ 1.c alleges in September 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with
solicitation of prostitution. Applicant went with an undercover police woman to a motel,
and when he arrived, some police came out of the bathroom and arrested him. (Tr. 74-
76) He was found guilty of soliciting a prostitute and fined $335. (Tr. 75) He denied that
he offered the undercover police woman any money. (Tr. 75-76) The police report states,
“The  subject  wanted  to  commit a  sex  act for  $30.00.”  (GE 5 at  3) He  said he  pleaded
guilty without admitting that he offered her money for sex. (Tr. 75)
Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  2.a  cross-alleges  the  conduct  in  SOR  ¶  1.  SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  that  in
December  2005,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  petit  larceny.  (GE  4)  An
employee of a drug store said Applicant picked up two items and walked out of the store.
(Tr.  80) The police  accused  Applicant  of  stealing.  (Tr.  78)  Applicant pleaded  not  guilty
and told the judge he purchased the items earlier from a different store. (Tr. 79) The judge
found him guilty of petty larceny, and Applicant believed he was convicted because he
was unable to produce the receipts for the items. (Tr. 79) He was sentenced to 12 months
in jail with 10 months suspended. (Tr. 81)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges that in July 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with petty
theft. Applicant said he was in a store and someone left their wallet at the register. (Tr.
82) Applicant took the wallet and attempted to return it to its owner who was outside the
store. (Tr. 83) The wallet was returned to the owner. (Tr. 83) The owner said $200 was

2014 to December 2015. (Tr. 45-46, 49) He lived in a homeless shelter for two months,
and he lived in his car for a time. (Tr. 48-49) He used the unemployment time to burnish
his  credentials  and  earn  information  technology  certifications.  (Tr.  46)  He  recently
received several salary increases, and his current salary is around $104,000. (Tr. 45, 100)
He receives 30 percent disability pay ($497 monthly) from the Department of Veterans
Affairs. (Tr. 108)
Applicant’s SOR alleges the following financial issues:
SOR  ¶  3.a  alleges  his  student  loan  for  $2,272  was  charged  off.  Applicant  is
currently enrolled in college, and he believed the correct loan status should be deferred.
(Tr. 40) He has about $12,000 in student loans that are not deferred because he “took a
pause at school.” (Tr. 73) He owes approximately $46,000 in student loans and they are
in deferment because he has been enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program since 2016.
(AE B) This debt is mitigated.
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges a collection debt for $350. Applicant was unaware of the source
of the debt, and he used a credit repair company to dispute his responsibility for it. (Tr.
42-43) This is the only SOR debt in collections. Applicant is credited with mitigating this
debt.
SOR  ¶  3.c  alleges  a  delinquent  child-support  debt  for  $55,584  owed  to  a  state
department of social services. Applicant said he started paying child support in 1996 or
1997. (Tr. 36) He said he consistently made child-support payments for the past three
years,  and  whenever  possible  he  pays  extra  to  reduce  the  arrearage.  (Tr.  87)  In  his
November  15,  2016  Officer  of  Personnel  Management  personal  subject  interview,
Applicant  said  his  child-support  arrearage  was  $46,715.  (GE  2  at  21)  His  current
arrearage is about $48,000. (Tr. 72) In October 2018, he owed the following amounts for
four children: $22,613; $9,988; $3,900; and $11,728, for a total of $48,229. (Tr. 71; AE
G) He currently pays $475 through a wage withholding or garnishment2 for one child and
$475 for his arrearage or a total of $950 per two-week pay period. (Tr. 36-37, 100) He
said  this  amounts  to  $1,400  or  $1,400  monthly.  (Tr.  100)  He  said  he  pays  extra  each
month in addition to the wage withholding. (Tr. 38) His November 16, 2018 child-support
statement indicated he paid $760. (AE G) In June 2018, he ended the garnishment and
is voluntarily paying his child-support debt. (AE A; AE G) This debt is not mitigated.
Applicant was unsure when he filed his federal income tax returns for tax years
2014 and 2015. (Tr. 114) He said he had not “completely” filed tax returns for the last five
years. (Tr. 113, 115) He said, “I have not filed taxes for 2017 yet, but I have filed taxes
for ’15 and ’14.” (Tr. 114) He said he filed his 2016 tax return. (Tr. 114) I asked him to
provide his Internal Revenue Service Form 1040s for the previous three years. (Tr. 116)
Applicant did not object to Department Counsel’s proposed amendment of the SOR to
add SOR ¶¶ 3.d through 3.g.
SOR  ¶¶  3.d  and  3.e  allege  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax
returns for tax years 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 117) SOR ¶¶ 3.f and 3.g allege Applicant failed
to timely file his state income tax return for tax years 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 117)
After  Applicant’s  hearing,  he  provided  documentation  depicted  in  the  following
table for tax years 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017 (not 2015).
2 Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because his child support payments were made
through garnishment of his salary even though his opportunity to establish a payment plan may have been
limited at times because of unemployment, lack of income, and other financial commitments. Payment of a
debt  “though  garnishment  rather  than  a  voluntary  effort  diminishes  its  mitigating  force.”  Compare  ISCR
Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26,
2006) (payment of two of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations
concerns). See also ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) (garnished payments towards
delinquent tax debts is not mitigating information in light of other factors); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6
(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) (remanding the case to the administrative judge and stating when addressing an
Internal  Revenue  Service  garnishment,  “On  its  face,  satisfaction  of  a  debt  through  the  involuntary
establishment  of  a  creditor’s  garnishment  is  not  the  same  as,  or  similar  to,  a  good-faith  initiation  of
repayment by the debtor.”).

Applicant’s state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, 2016,
and 2017 did not indicate that he owed any federal or state income taxes. (AE C-AE F)
Applicant said he did not need to file a tax return for tax year 2012 because his income
was too low, and he said his tax preparation service said he did not need to file tax returns
if it was more than six years ago. (AE A) If the IRS wants to pursue tax evasion or related
charges, it must do this within six years from the date the unfiled return was due. This six-
year  time  limit  does  not  remove  the  requirement  to  file  tax  returns  prior  to  2012.  No
adverse  inference  is  made  about  whether  Applicant  has  failed  to  file  or  timely  file  tax
returns other than those for tax years 2014, 2016, and 2017.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 4.a alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment in January
2016 for viewing inappropriate material on a computer while at work. (Tr. 51-57) While at
work, he was on a website where women do “silly things” such as “twerking” or “shaking
their butts.” (Tr. 53) He said not all of the videos on the website are sexually oriented. (Tr.
55)  He  was  working  at  the  front  desk  of  a  hotel,  and  another  employee  saw  the
inappropriate video and reported him to management. (Tr. 53) He said the problem was
he walked away from the desk, and he failed to close out the video. (Tr. 53) The time he
was caught on the website at work was not the first time he viewed material from that
website at work. (Tr. 56-57) SOR ¶ 4.b cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1
and 2.
Character Evidence
Applicant provided 19 pages of letters and emails positively describing his work
and contributions to his community from 1996 to 2011. (AE I) The statements laud his
integrity, responsibility, dependability, and intelligence. (AE I) He worked numerous hours
as a volunteer and often helped others with computer problems. (AE H) He presented
certificates  and  diplomas,  dated  from  1996  to  2015,  documenting  his  training  and
education accomplishments.
3 The income threshold for filing his 2013 tax return was $10,000 (filing status single under age 65),
and Applicant was not required to file a tax return for tax  year 2013. See IRS Publication 501, Cat. No.

"Applicant is 35 years old. He works as a project manager for a defense contractor.
He  is  single  and  has  no  children.  He  graduated  from  high  school  and  received  his
undergraduate  degree  in  2005.  Applicant  reported  no  military  service.  He  has  held  a
security  clearance  since  about  2009.  (GX  1)  He  has  been  employed  with  his  current
employer for about three years. However, he has worked for many government agencies.
He completed his most recent security clearance application in 2017. (GX 1, AX A)
Criminal Conduct
In  September  2016,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana and concealing. (SOR 1.a) He was stopped by a police officer for swerving on
the road. The officer, according to the report, noticed that Applicant had thrown out of the
vehicle a small white tissue. (GX 5) The officer smelled marijuana as he was talking to
Applicant.  The  police  report  stated  that  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  been  smoking
some marijuana earlier with a friend. (GX 5) The officer noted in the report that he saw a
“green leafy like substance on Applicant’s shirt and some on the passenger seat.”  The
small white tissue was tested and found positive for marijuana as well as the tissue that
had been thrown out of car. (GX 5) Applicant held a security clearance at the time.
At the hearing, Applicant stated that he was with a friend who asked him to hold
some marijuana for him. (Tr. 59) Applicant initially told the friend that he does not use
marijuana any more. When Applicant was driving home he saw that his friend had left a
small bag of marijuana on the car seat. (Tr. 60) Applicant called his friend and was told
that his friend would pick it up in the morning. The officer smelled marijuana coming from
the vehicle. Before the actual stop, Applicant saw the police sirens and threw the bag of
marijuana out of the car. (Tr. 61) Applicant claims that he explained to the officer that he
does  not  use  drugs.  Applicant  claims  that  the  officer  attempted  to  make  a  deal  with
Applicant.  If  Applicant  would  disclose  the  owner  of  the  marijuana,  he  would  dismiss
charges. The report, however, noted that Applicant told the officer that he had been using
some marijuana. Applicant now denies that he made that statement. (GX 5) (Tr. 64) As a
result of the incident, the officer released him. Applicant reported the incident to his FSO.
(AX F)
As to SOR 1.b, in February 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving
while  intoxicated,  first  offense.  (GX  4,  6)  He  reports  that  he  left  a  sports  bar  and  was
stopped by the police when he made a turn that crossed a yellow line. Applicant attempted
a breathalyzer test and performed routine tests. He reports that he was taken to a holding
cell.  When  he  used  the  breathalyzer,  he  registered  a  .08.  (Tr.  58)  When  Applicant
appeared in court, the charge was dropped to reckless driving. (GX 6)  He pled not guilty
and received a suspended 12 month sentence. (GX 4) He completed the required drug
and alcohol classes. (GX 3)
In  September  2005,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana. (SOR 1.c) He admitted that he was racing his motorcycle on the highway and
the motorcycle crashed into a wall. The police had been chasing him and found marijuana
in his motorcycle. Applicant told the police that he had loaned his bike to a friend earlier
in the day and did not know the marijuana was there that belonged to a friend. (Tr. 55)
Applicant  was  detained  in  jail  overnight  and  posted  bail.  When  he  went  to  court,  the
charge was reduced to nolle prossed due to insufficient evidence. (GX 3) He was required
to attend six weeks of ASAP classes. In 2006, when he arrived for the ASAP classes, he
tested positive for marijuana. (GX 3) Due to the untimely loss of his mother on September
2001,  the  judge  ordered  grief  counseling  as  well.  He  has  not  taken  any  other  drug  or
alcohol classes. (Tr. 66)
As to SOR 1.d, in December 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with illegal
possession of marijuana (misdemeanor). (GX4, 7) At the time, he was 20 years old. He
and a friend drove to a party. Before entering, Applicant and the friend were parked in
front of the house and were smoking marijuana. An officer pulled up and smelled a strong
odor of marijuana from the car. Applicant had concealed the bag of marijuana under the
seat. Applicant’s friend stated the marijuana belonged to Applicant. Applicant retained an
attorney and the case was dismissed and adjudication deferred. (GX 4) Applicant was
ordered to attend drug and alcohol classes. (GX 3)
Applicant admitted that he used marijuana in college as an experiment. (Tr. 52) He
believes he used between 2000 and 2005 at parties and on weekends.  He also stated
that he bought marijuana on one occasion. After he graduated from college, he did not
use marijuana or any other drug. (Tr. 53) At the hearing, Applicant stated that he knows
it is a privilege to hold a security clearance and that he takes it seriously. He stated that
he  no  longer  associates  with  anyone  who  uses  marijuana.  However,  he  stated  that  in
2016, he held marijuana for a friend.
During  Applicant’s  2018  investigative  interview,  he  explained  that  he  drinks
perhaps two or three beers a month. He does not even consider himself a social drinker.
(Tr. 53) He admits that he has made mistakes and immature decisions.
Applicant  is involved  in  many  sports activities  and has progressed  in  his career
path. He states that he knows he has to be responsible for his own behavior and the use
of marijuana or any drug would be a dishonor to his mother. (Tr. 57)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Statement of Reasons cross alleged the criminal conduct under Guideline H,
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse.  Applicant admitted the allegations as alleged
under 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d.
Two  witnesses  testified  for  Applicant.  The  first  witness,  who  is  retired,  held  a
security clearance for many years. She has known him for 20 years, and has acted as a
surrogate mother to him as his mother was killed on September 11, 2001. His father is
also deceased. The witness knew Applicant and his family through church. She described
Applicant as a reliable, honest, dependable person who is a hard worker. (Tr. 22) The
witness has never seen Applicant use marijuana. She was not aware of the 2016 arrest
listed in the SOR until right before the hearing.
The  second  witness  has  been  dating  Applicant  since  2008.  She  revealed  that
Applicant told her of the three arrests from 2003, 2005, and 2008. They have been living
together  for  about  five  or  six  years.  (Tr.  30)  She  stated  that  she  has  never  seen  any
marijuana in the house nor has she seen him smoke. As to alcohol, he drinks if they are
out. (Tr. 32) She testified that Applicant does not use marijuana. She does not know the
friend who gave him marijuana. (Tr. 38) She testified that there is no alcohol in the house.
Applicant submitted a letter from a licensed clinical psychologist who worked with
him for about 8 sessions from 2005 to 2006. He was referred for problems related to grief
and his adjustment to losing his mother in the terrorist attack at the Pentagon in 2001. He
participated actively in the sessions.  (GX 3)
He submitted seven letters of recommendation. Each letter attests to his honesty
and  trustworthiness.  All  the  declarations describe  Applicant as a person  who  is career
oriented and has never displayed any misconduct in the workplace. (AX B-H)

"In A1, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.b, with explanations, and denied SOR ¶ 1.a.
In  A2,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  2.a,  with  explanations,  and  denied  SOR  ¶  3.a.  The
admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  has  never  married  and  has  no  children.  He  has
worked for a defense contractor since January 2016. Before his current position he was
incarcerated  in  a  state  penitentiary  for  28  months  for  felony  aggravated  assault.  Upon
his release from prison, he was placed on probation, which he successfully completed
in February 2016. He has a high school diploma.1
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  discharged  a  firearm  into  an  unoccupied  vehicle  in
May 2012, which resulted in a citation for criminal damage (SOR ¶ 1.a). It also alleged
that in August 2012, Applicant shot an associate in the face, pushed his body out of his
truck,  and  fled  the  scene.  He  was  charged  with  attempted  first  degree  murder  and
aggravated  assault.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  aggravated  assault  and  was  sentenced  to
three  and  one-half  years  imprisonment  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  The  amended  SOR  alleged  that
Applicant  was  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  when  he  committed  the  acts  alleged  in
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  (SOR  ¶  2.a).  Also  in  the  amended  SOR,  all  the  above  acts  were
cross-alleged as personal conduct under Guideline E (SOR ¶ 3.a).
On approximately May 10 and into May 11, 2012, Applicant and a friend (F) (who
he  described  as  his best  friend  at  that  time)  were  drinking  alcohol  at  a friend’s  house.
Upon  leaving  the  residence,  rather  than  driving  home,  Applicant  chose  to  sleep  in  his
truck parked outside. The police were called when a neighbor’s car alarm went off. The
police investigated noting that a car window was broken close to where Applicant’s truck
was parked. Applicant was sleeping in his vehicle when the police approached him. He
was  questioned  about  whether  he  damaged  the  car  window.  Applicant  appeared
intoxicated to the officer. Applicant said he did not know if he broke the window, but that
it was possible that he broke it. Applicant had a loaded pistol in his truck at the time of
the  incident.  Evidence  discovered  at  the  scene  included  a  shell  casing  next  to  the
damaged car. Applicant was issued a citation for criminal damage to property. The case
1 Tr. 85, 95, 98; GE 1.
was  disposed  of  through  a  civil  compromise  where  Applicant  paid  the  victims  of  his
criminal  damage  and  his  criminal  case  was  dismissed.  His  father  paid  the  civil
compromise fee on behalf of Applicant. Applicant admitted that alcohol played a part in
this incident.2
In  August  2012,  Applicant  and  F  engaged  in  an  evening  of  drinking  at  various
locations.  Applicant  claims  F  also  used  Xanax  as  well.  Applicant  claimed  he  drank  at
least seven alcoholic beverages and F drank more than that. After leaving a restaurant,
Applicant  and  F  drove  away  in  Applicant’s  truck.  Applicant  had  two  handguns  in  his
truck,  one  in  the  center  compartment,  and  one  in  the  driver’s  side  compartment.
Sometime late in the evening, Applicant and F began arguing. It reached the point that
Applicant  claimed  that  F  reached  into  the  center  compartment  and  grabbed  the  gun.
Applicant  reacted  by  pulling  the  gun  on  the  driver’s  side  and  shooting  F  in  the  face,
opening  the  passenger  door,  pushing  F  out,  and  driving  away.  He  admitted  using
alcohol  that  night,  but  testified  that  he  was  in  control  of  his  senses  when  he  shot  F.
Later,  he  was  arrested  by  the  police  and  charged  with  attempted  first  degree  murder
and two counts of aggravated assault. After consulting with his attorney, he decided to
forego  pursuing  self-defense  with  a  not  guilty  plea  at  trial.  Instead,  Applicant  pleaded
guilty  to  aggravated  assault  in  May  2013,  and  was  sentenced  to  three  and  one-half
years  in  the  state  penitentiary.  Upon  completion  of  his  sentence,  he  was  placed  on
probation, which he successfully completed in February 2016. F survived the shooting,
but has had multiple surgeries since the shooting. Applicant does not recall apologizing
to F or his family at his sentencing hearing. He has not spoken to F since the incident.
Applicant  had  no  misconduct  incidents  while  incarcerated  and  has  had  no  law
enforcement involvement since his release.3
Applicant  admitted  that  he  used  alcohol  before  both  the  May  and  August  2012
incidents. He did not receive any alcohol treatment or counseling while incarcerated. He
continues  to  drink  alcohol.  The  last  time  he  was  intoxicated  was  at  a  friend’s  wedding
about  a  year  ago.  He  consumed  about  five  drinks  in  five  hours.  He  has  not  sought
alcohol treatment or counseling since leaving prison.4
Applicant  presented  the  testimony  of  three  officers  from  his  company  (the  vice
president  of  finance,  the  chief  operating  officer,  and  the  chief  executive  officer)  at
hearing. They also provided statements. All described the process of hiring Applicant for
their IT position. They were aware of his legal issues when they hired him. Applicant’s
father formerly worked for the same company and suggested him for the position. The
officers knew there was risk involved should they hire Applicant. They decided to do so
anyway. They universally believe the company has been rewarded many times over by
hiring  Applicant.  He  has  earned  more  and  more  responsibility  by  performing  in  an

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact. He is 27 years old, married, and he has one child, a minor. He has
owned his home since approximately 2018. (Answer; Tr. at 9, 45-66, 85; GE 1; AE I).
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  2010.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree
from  The  U.S.  Military  Academy  at  West  Point  (West  Point)  in  2014  and  was
commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was involuntarily honorably
discharged in November 2016. He was unemployed until March 2017, when he became
a systems engineer for his current employer, a defense contractor. As of the date of the
hearing, he was pursuing his master’s degree and expected to obtain it in May 2020. He
has held a security clearance since 2011. (Tr. at 6-7, 85-90, 96-100, 105-115, 144-146,
163; GE 1, 4, 5, 6; AE D, F, I, K, M, N).
Applicant  began  consuming  alcohol  when  he  was  a  senior  in  high  school.  He
drank a few beers on occasion. He did not consume alcohol during his first year at West
Point, but drank about five to seven beers on the six to seven occasions when he was
on  leave from West  Point during  his second  year.  His  leave  increased  during  his  third
year  and  he  drank  five  to  seven  beers  on  12  to  14  occasions.  By  his  fourth  year,  he
consumed six to nine beers approximately once monthly. (Tr. at 164-167; AE I).
In  November 2014,  Applicant  was  cited  with  public  drunkenness.  He  was  a  22-
year-old flight school student. He described his level of alcohol consumption during this
period  as  the  same  as  his  fourth  year  at West  Point.  He  and  his  classmates  had  just
completed  their  two-month  basic  officer  leadership  course  and  decided  to  attend  a
weekend  college football  game  during  their two  week  break  to  “blow  some  steam off.”
He  drank  beer  and  mixed  drinks  from  early  in  the  day  while  tailgating,  fell  asleep
sometime after the game commenced, and was wakened by a campus police officer for
sleeping  in  public  and  taken  to  a  local drunk  tank  to  get  sober.  He  was  cited,  pled  no
contest, and paid his fine. He “laid low” from consuming alcohol for a while because he
was upset and ashamed of himself. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 3.a; Tr. at 90-96, 100-103, 146-
147, 167-168, 171-172; GE 1; AE I).
From November 2014 to April 2016, Applicant was “deep into the training of flight
school.” He and his classmates consumed alcohol at a friend’s house or a local bar to
“enjoy the free time that we did have.” By January 2016,  his alcohol consumption had
increased  to  eight  to  ten  beers  every  weekend.  In  April  2016,  he  was  arrested  and
charged with driving under the influence (DUI). This was his first DUI. He was 23 years
old and a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was less than one week from flight school
graduation and felt “on top of the world . . . a little bit invincible.” He attended a party at
a friend’s house with the intention of spending the night. He consumed beer and mixed
drinks and drove home. The police stopped him after he took “a right-hand turn out of
the  straight-only  lane”  and  then  a  “left-hand  turn  without  signaling  my  turn.”  Upon  his
arrest,  he  initially  denied  having  consumed  alcohol  out  of  fear,  but  then  admitted  to
drinking during his field sobriety test. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .16%. (SOR
¶¶ 1.b, 2.a, 3.a; Tr. at 60, 90-96, 103-117, 147-154, 158-161, 168-169, 172-173; GE 1,
2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE I, J, M, N).
The  DUI  was  nolle  prossed.  The  U.S.  Army  revoked  Applicant’s  driving
privileges;  issued  him  a  General  Officer  Memorandum  of  Reprimand  (GOMR)  in  May
2016; and notified him in July 2016 that he would be involuntarily honorably discharged.
He  enrolled  in  and  completed  the  Army  Substance  Abuse  Program  (ASAP)  in  May
2016,  through  which  he  received  alcohol  counseling.  He  did  not  consume  alcohol  for
three  months  from  around  April  to  July  2016.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  2.a,  3.a;  Tr.  at  60,  90-96,
103-117, 147-154, 158-161, 168-169, 172-173; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE I, J, M, N).
While  Applicant’s  involuntary  discharge  was  pending,  he  was  charged  with  his
second  DUI  in  October  2016.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  2.a,  3.a).  He  was  24  years  old.  He  had
resumed consuming alcohol in July 2016 as self-medication for his depression about his
“unknown future and unknown fate.” His tipping point occurred in September 2016 when
his roommate moved out. He found himself socializing with “bar buddies” who he did not
really  know  and he  did  not  communicate or  seek  help from  his family  or friends.  On a
holiday  weekend,  he  consumed  alcohol  at  a  Halloween  party.  He  then  drove  to  a  bar
where he continued to consume alcohol. On his drive home, he was going too fast upon
arriving at an intersection, tried to turn his car sideways, hit  a curb, and flipped his car
into a ditch. His BAC was .23%. The DUI was dismissed. He was discharged from the
U.S Army honorably, due to unacceptable conduct. (SOR ¶ 3.b; Tr. at 90-96, 108, 117-
125, 132-133, 154-161, 168-169, 172-174; GE 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8; AE F, I, M, N).
Applicant confided in his parents and wife after his second DUI. During his two-
to  three-week  out processing  from  the  U.S.  Army,  he  received  alcohol  counseling  and
treatment from the same ASAP counselor as his first DUI. The counselor diagnosed him
with  alcohol-related  disorder,  moderate  and  recommended  that  he  attend  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA)  and abstain from alcohol. His  father  took  him to his first  AA meeting
and he attended AA daily for two to three weeks. He testified that he accepted that he is
an  alcoholic  at  his  first  AA  meeting.  He  then  returned  to  live  with  his  parents  and
continued  to  attend  AA  meetings  weekly  to  twice  weekly  from  approximately  March
2017 until April 2018, when he relocated. He attended one to two AA meetings in June
2018. Since his October 2016 DUI, he consumed alcohol on  three occasions when he
was with close friends and family: he had three beers at his wedding in December 2016,
and four to five beers on two occasions in January 2017. (Tr. at 50, 60, 62-66, 121, 125-
144, 161-164,172-178; GE 1; AE A, I).
Applicant  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  January  2017.  He  intends  to  remain
sober.  He  testified  that  although  he  intends  to  resume  with  AA  meetings,  he  does  not
rely  on  AA  to  maintain  his  sobriety.  He  has  instead  focused  on  his  family,  job,
education,  exercise,  home,  church,  and  friendships  that  are  not  centered  around
alcohol. In June 2018, he sought an alcohol evaluation and his previous diagnosis was
updated
remission.  He  was
recommended  to  continue  with  AA  and  remain  sober.  He  does  not  have  any  other
alcohol-related  incidents.  He  testified  that  he  identified  that  the  root  cause  of  his
problems was alcohol, so he completely removed it from his life. He testified:
to  alcohol-use  disorder,  moderate
in  sustained
I  don’t  regret  what  happened,  because  my  life  has  completely  turned
around from it. I think if I didn’t have the second DUI, I would really, truly
[not]  realized  I  had  a  problem  until  something  worse  might  have
happened.
(Tr. at 50, 60, 62-66, 121, 125-144, 161-164, 175-178; AE B, C, I).
Applicant  disclosed  to  his  previous  and  current  managers  his  first  DUI  and  his
consequent military discharge.  He testified that he  would disclose his second DUI, but
had  not  done  so  because  he  was  not  so  required,  since  it  was  not  a  conviction.  He
received a performance evaluation rating of “successful” from his employer in 2017 and
an “excellent” rating in 2018.  (Tr. at 96-100, 170-171; AE E, G, I, L).
Applicant’s  wife  testified.  She met and began  dating Applicant  in 2014  and  was
aware  of  his  alcohol-related  incidents  and  involuntary  discharge  from  the  U.S.  Army.
She  reiterated  that  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  January  2017.  She  does  not
consume  alcohol.  She  testified  that  though  they  have  found  themselves  in  social
situations  where  alcohol is present,  to  include  through  their  intramural kickball  league,
she  has  no  concerns  about  his  ability  to  maintain  sobriety.    She  described  him  as  a
matured,  responsible, determined,  self-motivated  individual  “focused  on his health and
his career and family” who has “turned his life around.” She testified that Applicant has
“realized that alcohol serves no purpose in his life.” (Tr. at 45-66; AE H).
One of Applicant’s West Point classmates, who was also a roommate on various
occasions, testified. The witness was serving in the U.S. military on active duty as of the
date  of  the  hearing.  He  was  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  testified  that  while
attending West Point, he, Applicant, and their peers drank fairly often on the weekends.
Though  he  did  not  consider  Applicant  to  have  an  alcohol  problem,  he  was
“disappointed”  but  “not  completely  blindsided”  when  he  learned  of  Applicant’s  DUIs.
Since  graduation,  they  communicate  approximately  once  monthly  and  see  each  other
occasionally.  The  witness  testified  that  Applicant  informed  him  about  Applicant’s
sobriety.  The  witness  also  observed  Applicant  practice  sobriety  on  around  four
occasions  and  stated  that  he  has  no  concerns  with  Applicant’s  ability  to  maintain  his
sobriety.  He  described  Applicant  as  “very  intelligent”  and  one  who  has  “always  done
very well at everything he set his mind to.” (Tr.at 33-44; AE G).
Applicant’s colleague and mentor since 2017 testified. She previously interacted
with  him  daily,  but  since  his relocation  in  April 2018  they  interacted  twice  weekly.  She
testified  that  she  was  aware  of  his  alcohol-related  incidents  and  involuntary  military
discharge. She testified that he “has always  been one of the highest performing junior
engineers”  who  “performs  above  his  level.”  As  such,  she  has  given  his  managers
“extremely  positive”  peer  feedback  for  his  performance  evaluations.  She  testified  that
she  had  been  in  social  situations  with  Applicant  and  never  observed  him  consuming
alcohol.  She  was  aware  that  he  was  sober.  She  considers  him  to  be  an  honest  and
trustworthy individual. Numerous professional and social character references describe
Applicant  as  a  man  of  exemplary  character,  with  demonstrated
integrity  and
trustworthiness. (Tr. at 66-84; AE G).

"Applicant, age 32, was married in 2013 and has three minor children. He received
a high school diploma in 2005. He has been enrolled in a community college since August
2017,  as  part  of  the  apprenticeship  program  with  which  he  has  been  employed  since
January 2017. Applicant was previously granted a DOD security clearance in 2010.
The SOR alleged twelve criminal charges including assault and strangulation of a
family  member  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  2.a),  three  incidents  of  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI)
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.k, 1.l, 2.a, 3.a), four incidents of contempt of court (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.g,
1.h, 2.a), and four incidents of driving on a suspended license (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j,
2.a). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the following Guideline J allegations: SOR
¶¶  1.a  through  1.c,  1.f,  and  1.k.  Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  Guideline  E  and  G
allegations, which I have construed as denials.
In  December  2016,  Applicant  was  involved  in  a  disagreement  with  his  wife
concerning their child. Applicant’s wife alleged that he assaulted and strangled her, for
which he was arrested and charged (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant claimed that his wife tried to
run him over with a vehicle, and admitted that he grabbed her in an effort to stop her from
doing so. However, he denied either assaulting or strangling his wife. A court dismissed
both charges. Applicant and his wife have since reconciled and remain married. (Item 5
at 6 and 8; Item 9 at 5). The Government did not provide any documents to  challenge
Applicant’s version of the facts surrounding the incident or the court’s disposition. (Item 9
at 5, details only the charges).
Applicant admitted two of the three alleged DUI charges. The record established
one DUI in 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.k) and another in 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.a). A 2007 DUI (SOR ¶ 1.l)
was alleged based on the apparent mistaken reliance of a date referenced as “possibly
in 2007” in one portion of Applicant’s 2017 SI. (Item 5 at 7). However, in another portion
of that same 2017 SI, the “possibly in 2017” reference was corrected to 2009. (Item 5 at
7-8). Applicant provided inconsistent accounts of the facts and circumstances of his 2009
DUI during his 2008 and 2017 SIs. The Government neither alleged nor otherwise noted
the discrepancy, nor did it provide any documents to detail the facts and circumstances
of the 2009 DUI.
In February 2009, Applicant did not feel impaired and believed that he was okay
to  drive  after  consuming  alcohol.  The  facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  his
consumption of alcohol prior to driving are uncertain given Applicant’s differing accounts.
He  was  pulled  over  by  a  police  officer  for  speeding.  A  breathalyzer  revealed  a  blood
alcohol count  of  .12%.  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI.  In  June  2009,  a
court adjudicated him guilty and sentenced him to 90 days in jail (suspended), restricted
his  driver’s  license  for  a  year,  ordered  him  to  attend  Alcohol  Safety  Action  Program
(ASAP) classes, and fined him $250. (Item 5 at 7-8; Item 6 at 1; Item 8 at 15-16; Item 9
at 5).
Applicant’s March 2017 DUI occurred three days after he submitted his SCA. On
that occasion, he consumed five beers over the course of two to three hours while he was
at a bar with a friend. He did not feel impaired and believed that he was okay to drive
when they left to meet another friend. Applicant hit a guard rail after being cut off by a
semi-truck  on  an  interstate  highway.  The  officer  responding  to  the  accident  smelled
alcohol on Applicant’s breath and administered a breathalyzer, which registered an blood
alcohol count of .12%. Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. In January 2018, a
court adjudicated him guilty and sentenced him to 6 months in jail (all but 10 weekend
days suspended), placed him on unsupervised probation for three years,  restricted his
driver’s  license  for  three  years,  ordered  the  installation  of  an  interlock  device  on  his
vehicle for six months, ordered him to attend ASAP classes, and fined him $500. Applicant
completed his jail term in February 2018. (Item 5 at 6-8; Item 7; Item 8 at 1-2).
Applicant does not believe that he has a problem with alcohol and has never been
diagnosed alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser. He began consuming alcohol at the
age of 21, regularly consuming approximately two beers a week in social settings with
others. After his daughter was born in February 2014, he reduced the frequency of his
consumption to special occasions approximately twice per year, during which he would
drink to intoxication (approximately five beers). As of December 2017, Applicant had not
consumed any alcohol since his March 2017 DUI and expressed a future intent to abstain
from any consumption of alcohol or driving after consuming alcohol. He cited his daughter
and career as motivation for the abstention. (Item 5 at 9).
In his SOR answer, Applicant denied all four contempt of court charges alleged in
SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e,  1.g,  and  1.h.  In  August  2009,  a  court  adjudicated  Applicant  guilty  in
absentia of the June 2009 charge alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. (Item 8 at 17-18). The charges
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g involved a mistaken identity and were dismissed by
the court in December 2015. (Item 5 at 8; Item 8 at 3-8, 9 at 5).
Applicant was convicted of two of the four driving on suspended license charges
alleged in the SOR; the other two were dismissed by the court. Despite Applicant’s claim
that his license had been reinstated at the time he was charged in April 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.i),
the court adjudicated him guilty in June 2009 and fined him $100. (Item 6 at 1; Item 8 at
11-12). In June 2013, a court adjudicated Applicant guilty of the March 2013 charge (SOR
¶ 1.c), sentenced him to 30 days in jail (suspended), suspended his driver’s license for
90 days, and fined him $750. (Item 8 at 9-10). Although Applicant did not claim mistaken
identity  as  to  the  November 2010  charge  (SOR  ¶  1.f),  the  record  suggests  that  it  was
dismissed for that reason on December 2015. (Item 8 at 7-8). The November 2010 charge
was  initiated  by  the  same  complainant  and  adjudicated  at  the  same  time  as  the  other
mistaken  identity  charges  noted  above.  Applicant’s  February  2009  charge  (SOR  ¶  1.j)
stemmed from his 2009 DUI, and was dismissed by the court on the same day that the
DUI was adjudicated. (Item 8 at 13-14).

Criminal Conduct
Applicant’s SOR lists 18 separate allegations under this concern. He admitted to
all but two of the allegations.
Summarized,  those  allegations  are:  (1)  in  1986,  arrested  and  charged  with
possession of narcotics; (2) in July 1993, arrested and charged with carrying a firearm
without  a  license;  (3)  in  February  1994,  arrested  and  charged  with  carrying  a  firearm

(13)  in  July  2004,  arrested  and  charged  with  three  counts  of  robbery  (he  denied  this
allegation); (14) in February 2011, arrested and charged with carrying a firearm without
a  license,  receiving  stolen  property,  disorderly  and  hazardous  conduct,  and  carrying  a

license,  possess-use-transfer  of  a  firearm,  resisting  arrest,  escape,  possessing
prohibited  and  offensive  weapons,  and  carrying  a  loaded  weapon;  (17)  in  April  2014,
arrested  and  charged  with  tampering  or  fabricating  evidence,  violating  the  state’s
Controlled Substance, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act, and driving under the influence
of  alcohol  or  a  controlled  substance;  and  (18)  currently  on  probation  until  September
2021.
These  allegations  are established  through  Applicant’s admissions and evidence
submitted by the Government. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – l.r; Items 2 - 5)
Applicant submitted no mitigating evidence in his SOR answer to suggest that he
had overcome his 30-year history of criminal behavior from 1986 to 2014, other than a
statement in his SOR answer, “I no longer live that destructive lifestyle.” (Item 2)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  SOR  lists  five  separate  allegations  under  this  concern.  He  admitted
all of the allegations.
Summarized,
those  allegations  are:  (1)  owes
the  Federal  Government
approximately $23,000 for delinquent taxes for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2014; (2) has
an unpaid $3,434 hospital medical collection account; (3)  has an unpaid $555 medical
collection  account;  (4)  has  an unpaid $542 medical collection  account; and  (5)  has  an
unpaid $535 medical collection account.
These  debts  are  established  by  Applicant’s admissions and  evidence  submitted
by the Government. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a – 2.e; Items 2 - 4, 6, 7)
When  queried  about  nonpayment  of  taxes  during  his  Office  of  Personnel
Management Personal Subject Interview, Applicant explained he was going from job to
job as a contract employee and lost his tax paperwork, and then forgot about filing his
taxes. Applicant claimed that he contacted the IRS and started the process to file and
pay  his  back  taxes.  The  investigator  discussed  other  accounts  alleged  during  those
interviews.  (Item  4)  Applicant  submitted  no  mitigating  evidence  that  addressed  any  of
the allegations raised under this guideline.
Personal Conduct
Applicant’s SOR lists seven separate allegations under this concern. He admitted
all of the allegations.
Summarized those allegations are: (1) the information alleged under criminal and
personal  conduct  was  cross-alleged  under  this  concern;  (2)  used  illegal  drugs  with
varying frequency between 1988 until at least July 2015; (3) consumed alcohol at times
to the point of intoxication with varying frequency from 1991 until at least April 2014; (4)
more  than  one  of  the  arrests  alleged  under  criminal  conduct  involved  excessive
consumption of alcohol and/or use  of  illegal drugs;  (5)  fired  in  June  2011 for failure  to
follow  safety  rules;  (6)  fired  in April 2014 for abusing  sick leave for which  some of the
abuse was related to excessive drinking; and (7) fired or quit in lieu of being fired in July
2015 for testing positive on a drug test.
These  allegations  are established  through  Applicant’s admissions and evidence
submitted by the Government. (SOR ¶¶ 3.a – 3.g; Items 2 - 5) Applicant submitted no
mitigating evidence that addressed any of the allegations raised under this guideline.
Department  Counsel’s  FORM  discussed  specific  shortcomings  of  Applicant’s
answer.  He  further  emphasized  long-standing  DOHA  case  law  that  it  is  necessary  for
applicants to provide mitigating documentation. As noted, Applicant did not submit any
additional information within the 30-day period following his receipt of the FORM.

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  comments  all  of  the  factual
allegations pertaining to criminal conduct in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.i.), but he
failed to admit or deny the cross-allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR ¶ 2.a),
so  a  denial  was  registered  for  him.  Applicant’s  admissions  and  comments  are
incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a condenser maintenance worker with his current employer since July 2017. A 2001
high school graduate, Applicant earned college and vocational credits but no degree. He
enlisted in the U.S. Navy in September 2001, and served on active duty until September
2009,  when  he  was  honorably  discharged.  He  remained  in  the  active  reserve,  with
deployments to Guam and Afghanistan, and he re-enlisted on active duty in November
2014. Applicant was discharged in April 2016, and  he was issued a general discharge
under honorable conditions. He was granted a secret clearance in 2004. Applicant has
never married. He has no children.
Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct
In part, because of Applicant’s consumption of alcohol, he has a lengthy history of
disregarding laws, rules, and regulations. The SOR alleged nine incidents of criminality
and  personal  conduct  by  Applicant  commencing  in  2003,  and  continuing  until  at  least
2017.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a.): In March 2003, when he was a 19-year-old seaman (E-3), Applicant
received non-judicial punishment for violation of Article 91  (Disrespect toward Superior
Petty Officer), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). He was restricted to the vessel
for five days. Applicant denied, and there is no independent evidence to the contrary, that
he  was  reduced  in  rank  as  alleged  in  the  SOR,  although  Applicant  caused  some
controversy  initially  by  saying  the  allegation  was  accurate.  He  described  the  episode
leading  up  to  his  discipline,  as  follows:  He  was  sitting  with  his  roommate  during  lunch
when he got up to obtain some additional beverage, but when he returned, someone was
sitting in his place, although Applicant’s full tray of food was still unmoved. He asked the
individual to move so he could finish his meal and was told to wait because the individual
was  talking  to  someone.  Applicant  placed  his  hands  under  the  individual’s  armpits  to
assist him out of the seat. Applicant was not aware of the individual’s rank at the time.
With added maturity, Applicant realized that he could have handled the situation better by
simply moving his seat to finish his lunch.1
(SOR  ¶  1.b.):  In  September  2007,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
Driving  While  Intoxicated  (DWI)  –  1st  offense,  a  misdemeanor.  Although  the  Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Identification Record reported that he was convicted of the
charge on November 7, 2007, and sentenced to 12 months and 5 days, with 12 months
suspended, along with unsupervised probation, Applicant stated, and the SOR alleged,
that he was sentenced to 10 days in jail.2 The trial court apparently also mandated that
Applicant  install  an  ignition  interlock  or  car  breathalyzer,3  suspended  his  operator’s
license  for  one  year,  and  ordered  him  to  attend  an  Alcohol  Safety  Action  Program
(ASAP).4  Applicant  described  the  events  leading  up  to  his  arrest:  He  had  attended  a
friend’s promotion party-cookout, consumed three of four mixed vodka drinks, and then
went  to  another  event  that  was  motorcycle-related.  That  event  became  somewhat
raucous,  and  when  the  police  arrived,  everyone  departed.  Applicant  was  stopped  one
block from the party and administered a sobriety test, which he failed.5
(SOR  ¶¶  1.c.,  1.d.,  and  1.e.):  As  noted  above,  because  of  the  court  sentence
associated with Applicant’s September 2007 DWI, he was required to attend ASAP. He
repeatedly failed to do so, claiming that he did not have sufficient funds available because
of  the  costs  associated  with  the  ignition  interlock,  attorney  and  court  fees,  and  his
increased insurance costs.6 In March 2008, he was required to show cause on a charge
of ASAP Non-Comply. On April 24, 2008, he entered a plea of guilty and was ordered to
pay court costs of $76. He paid his court costs in March 2009.7 In September 2008, he

was again required to show cause on a charge of ASAP Non-Comply. On May 7, 2009,
he entered a plea of not guilty, but was found guilty, and he was ordered to pay court
costs  of $76.  He paid his court costs  in  December  2009.8  In  May  2010,  he  was  again
required to show cause on a charge of ASAP Non-Comply. On June 24, 2010, he entered
a plea of not guilty, but was found guilty. The case was immediately appealed,9 because
Applicant claimed that he had actually fulfilled his ASAP obligation.10
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): In October 2015, Applicant was charged with DWI – 2nd offense, a
misdemeanor. On January 4, 2016, he was found guilty and sentenced to 60 days (50
days  suspended),  fined  $500,  ordered  to  pay  $296  in  court  costs,  and  his  operator’s
license was restricted for three years, commencing on January 4, 2016. He paid his fine
and court costs on April 7, 2016.11 Applicant described the events leading up to his arrest:
A girlfriend was being transferred so a group of friends decided to take her out. One of
the friends – a designated sober driver – got angry towards the end of the evening and
as she was departing in another vehicle, she threw Applicant’s keys out the window to
him, leaving him without a designated driver. Although Applicant denied being intoxicated,
he  drove  the  vehicle  away,  and  was  stopped.  He  acknowledged  that  he  made  an
irresponsible decision.12
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): In March 2016, Applicant was charged with  Contempt of Court, a
misdemeanor.13  Applicant’s  descriptions  associated  with  this  incident  are  somewhat
inconsistent. He initially claimed it was about a missed court date, but later claimed that
the  charge  was  associated  with  his  failure  to  enroll  in  ASAP  by  a  certain  date.  He
displayed proof that he was enrolled in a class that was scheduled to commence in April
2016. The charge was eventually dismissed on July 25, 2016.14
(SOR  ¶  1.h.):  In  March  2016,  Applicant  received  non-judicial  punishment  for
violation of Article 92 (Failure to Obey a Lawful Order), UCMJ. The charge was related to
his October 2015 DWI. He was restricted to the vessel for 45 days and reduced from E-6
to  E-5.  Applicant  was  also  notified  that  he  was  to  be  administratively  processed  for
discharge.15

Suspended/Revoked,  a  misdemeanor,  essentially  driving  after  a  forfeiture  of  an
operator’s license. On March 17, 2017, he was convicted as charged and sentenced to
30 days (suspended), 3 additional months of suspension, fined $250, and ordered to pay
$91 in court costs. He paid his fine and court costs on June 7, 2017.16 Applicant described
the events leading up to his arrest: Because he could no longer afford to reside in his
home,  and  he  was  unable  to  find  someone  to  assist  him  in  moving  his  belongings  to
storage, he moved them himself on two trips. On the third trip, he was stopped by the
same  officer  who  had  stopped  him  in  October  2015.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he
made a foolish decision.17
Applicant contended that he completed a four-week ASAP in May 2016, and that
as  of  October  2017,  he  was  still  participating  in  another  18-week  class  that  was
temporarily interrupted by a job-related trip to sea. He failed to submit any documents to
support his contentions related to his attendance or completion of the ASAP programs.
He denied ever being diagnosed for any alcohol-related condition. He also finally realized
that  drinking  and  driving  resulted  in  his  having  to  pay  expensive  fines,  and  that  is
something  he  no  longer  wishes  to  do.  Although  he  used  to  drink  three  to  four  mixed
vodkas  during  the  weekends,  he  now  claims  that,  as  of  September  2017,  he  stopped
consuming alcohol.18

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  with  explanations.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  37  years old.  He  served  in  the military  from  2002  to 2006  and  was
honorably discharged in the paygrade E-5. He has never married and has no children.
He is working on completing his bachelor’s degree.1
In  February  2000,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  assault  causing
bodily injury. A person insulted his girlfriend and Applicant hit him. Applicant described
himself  as  “young  and  dumb.”2  He  pled  guilty  to  the  misdemeanor  and  paid  a  fine.  In
October  2000,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana.  He
pled  guilty  and  served  30  days  in  jail.  Applicant  admitted  that  in  May  2002,  he  was
charged  with  failure  to  stop  and  give  information.  He  could  not  recall  the  incident,  but
remembered he paid a fine of $200.3
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  serving  in  the  military  in  August  2006  and  his
friends  were  giving  him  a  farewell  party  before  he  was  discharged.  Applicant  was
intoxicated. There was a designated driver, but this person decided to take the vehicle
he was driving onto private beach property. Applicant stated he woke up and was being
pulled  out  of  the  vehicle.  He  spent  the  night  in  jail,  and  the  owner  of  the  property
decided not to press charges, so they were dismissed.4
Applicant  testified  that  the  night  of  December  31,  2008,  he  was  home  and  his
cousin called him from a bar. Applicant went to the bar and consumed some alcohol. He
was  driving  his  cousin  home  and  was  stopped  by  the  police.  He  testified  that  his
breathalyzer  result  was  .09%.  He  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while
intoxicated. After he completed the requirements of a pretrial diversion program, which
included a defensive driving course, a 5-day alcohol awareness course, and 100 hours
of community service, the charge was dismissed.5

In  2017,  Applicant  was  attending  a  coworker’s  birthday  party.  He  had  taken  a
ride-share  vehicle  to  the  party.  He  consumed  too  much  alcohol,  became  intoxicated,
and  blacked  out.  He  testified  he  had  no  recollection  of  the  night.  He  and  his  girlfriend
had separate rooms, but had permitted each access to the other’s. Applicant went into
his girlfriend’s hotel room to return a gift and then went back to his room. She returned
later  and  was  also  intoxicated.  She  could  not  find  an  item  in  her  room  and  began
banging  on  Applicant’s  hotel  room  door,  which  he  did  not  answer  because  he  was
passed  out.  The  hotel  staff  called  the  police.  The  police  attempted  to  wake  Applicant
and gain access to his room. He did not answer due to his intoxication. Once he woke,
he  was  arrested  and charged  with  2nd  degree  burglary,  theft  and criminal  damage  per
domestic  violence.  Applicant  attended  court  two  days  later  and  the  charges  were
dismissed.  Applicant’s  former  girlfriend  provided  a  letter  corroborating  the  events  and
explained  the  hotel  staff  misunderstood  the  situation,  and  there  was  no  crime
committed.  She  regretted  how  the  event  transpired  and  escalated.  Applicant  reported
the  November  2017  incident  to  his  employer  immediately  after  he  was  released  from
jail.6
Applicant  testified  that  he  consumes  alcohol  about  one  to  three  times  a  month.
The last time he was intoxicated was in November 2017 when the incident happened at
the hotel. He has not had an alcohol evaluation. He stated that he has only been to a
bar  once  since  the  2017  incident  and  that  was  for  his  friend’s  birthday,  and  Applicant
was the designated driver. Otherwise, he no longer goes to bars and when he drinks it
is at home. He does not believe he has a problem with alcohol. He has made a decision
that he will not consume alcohol in public places, such as bars and restaurants. He has
learned  his  lesson.  He  stated  he  has  a  huge  opportunity  to  further  his  career  with  his
employer and does not want to jeopardize it. He promised that in the future, he will not
drink alcohol to intoxication.7
Applicant  is  remorseful  and  embarrassed,  and  regrets  his  past  mistakes.  He
accepts responsibility for his past conduct and is committed to acting responsibly in the
future.
Applicant  provided  character  letters  from  coworkers  and  friends  who  describe
him as a dedicated professional who is always at the work site on time; is focused on
attention to details, and consistently adheres to security requirements. He is considered
reliable,  diligent,  honest,  generous,
friendly,  considerate,
hardworking, and trustworthy.8

"Applicant is 37 years old. She obtained her associate’s degree in 2011 and her
bachelor’s degree in 2013. She has been employed as a human resources manager for
a federal contractor since July 2016.  Applicant was unemployed briefly from May 2016
to June 2016 when she was terminated for alleged theft from her employer by uttering a
forged instrument. Applicant reports no military service. She married in June 2001 and
divorced in June 2009. Applicant is a single mother of three children. Applicant has not
previously held a security clearance.
On May 25, 2017, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA),
and in section 22 (Police Record) she disclosed her arrest in May 2016 when her previous
employer accused her of forgery and grand larceny alleging that she forged and cashed
phony payroll checks. She also disclosed that she was fired from this job. She stated that
the case was dismissed by the court in December 2016.2 Applicant responded to the SOR
on June 21, 2018 (Answer) and denied creating the duplicate payroll checks, then cashing
them. An arrest warrant was issued on June 18, 2018, and she turned herself in to police.
Since she could not afford an attorney, a public defender was assigned to her case. The
public defender advised her to pay restitution for the duplicate payroll checks that were
fraudulently cashed, and she did. In return, the prosecutor dropped the charges. (Answer)
Applicant’s FBI criminal history record reflects the arrest for larceny by check on
September 12, 2016, and the case dismissal on December 12, 2016. (Item 6) However,
the offense report from the sheriff’s department involved, reflects that on May 4, 2016,
Applicant came in to report that persons unknown cashed two false payroll checks in her
name at local retail stores after Applicant cashed the original check at a bank. (Item 5)
Interestingly, when sheriff’s deputies checked the loss detection video tapes in these local
stores,  they  clearly  show  Applicant  cashing  the  two  checks.  In  her  personal  subject
interview (PSI), Applicant stated she left this employer by mutual agreement. (Item 4) This
contradicts her assertion in section 13A of her SCA (Employment Activities) that she was
fired.  She  also  stated  “I  have  absolutely  no  idea  how  these  checks  were  printed  or
cashed.” (Answer) She also stated it “was a poor decision on my part.”

"Applicant is 39 years old and is married.  He has a high school diploma and an
HVAC certificate.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Cable Technician.  He
is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  December  2014.    He  has
never  held  a  security  clearance  before.    Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations  set
forth  in  the  SOR  under  both  the  criminal  conduct  guideline  and  the  personal  conduct
guideline.  He admits to a serious history of criminal conduct that began in about 1994,
at the age of 16, which continued until at least 2006.  Applicant admits that at the age of
16, he was convicted for attempted robbery, (a felony) and by age 28, he was convicted
and charged with an additional four felonies.
As  mentioned  above,  in  1994,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Felony  Attempted
Robbery.    Applicant  and  a  friend  attempted  to  steal  a  woman’s  purse,  when  she
screamed, and they ran back to his friend’s house.  Five minutes later, the police arrived
at his friend’s house to arrest the Applicant.  Applicant was convicted of the charge and
sentenced to six months detention.  (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.)
In  January  1999,  he  was  charged  with  two  counts  of  Assault  and  Battery.    He
was convicted of one count of Assault.  In October 1999, he was charged with Profane,
Threatening  Language  Over  Public  Airway.    In  May  2000,  he  was  charged  with
Possession  of  Marijuana,  and  convicted  of  the  offense.    In  July  2000,  Applicant  was
charged with Destruction of Property.  He was convicted of this offense.  (Government
Exhibits 4 and 5.)
In October 2000, Applicant was charged with Driving After Forfeiture of License
and  Driving  After  Illegally  Consuming  Alcohol.    Applicant  stated  that  he  was  drinking
and driving after leaving a bar.  He dropped off a friend, and then got into an accident
where he wrecked his car in a storm drain.  Applicant left his car at the wreck location
and  walked  home.    Five  minutes  later,  the  police  arrived  and  Applicant  was  arrested.
He was convicted of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, and sentenced to 6 months
suspended.  (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.)
In March 2006, Applicant was charged with three counts of Felony Manufacture,
Sale,  Possession,  of  Controlled  Substance;  Felony  Possession  of  Firearm  While  in
Possession  of  Drugs;  Felony  Sale,  Distribute  Marijuana;  and  Felony  Possession  of
Controlled  Substance.    Applicant’s  house  was  raided  by  the  police  department.
Applicant states that he not at home at the time, but his wife was, and she was charged
with one count of possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) and was taken to jail
immediately  after  the  raid.    Applicant  states  that  when  his  wife  was  in  jail,  he  was
contacted by a police officer who told him to turn himself in or his wife would be charged
with  all  seven  felony  counts.    Applicant  states  that  he  turned  himself  in  and  took  the
blame  for  all  of  the  charges  to  prevent  his  wife  from  being  charged  for  all  of  them.
Applicant contends that the firearms were not his, but belonged to, and were registered
to  a  friend,  consisting  of  two  handguns.    Applicant’s  stated  that  his  friend  had  left  the
firearms at his house, as they would go to the shooting range together.  Applicant also
contends  that  the  drugs  were  not  his  and  that  he  did  not  purchase  them.    In  fact,  he
states that he does not know how they ended up in his bedroom.  Applicant was initially
charged  with  seven  felonies  consisting  of  two  firearm  charges  and  five  substance
charges  which  included  psilocybin,  marijuana,  hash,  mescaline  and  cocaine.    These
charges  were  dropped  to  four  felonies.  On  May  1,  2007,  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  and
was  convicted  of  two  felony  counts  of  Possession  with  Intent  to  Distribute  and  two
felony  counts  of  Possession  of  Firearm  while  in  Possession  of  Drugs.    Applicant  was
sentenced to 20 years in prison with 15 years suspended.  He was incarcerated for five
years from May 2007 to about November 2012.  He was then placed on parole for three
years.  (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.)
Applicant states that he no longer associates with the people who were involved
in his prior convictions.  He further states that he  does not smoke, drink, or use drugs
anymore.  He now spends his time with his family, watching movies and going to work.

"Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2015.  He  seeks  to  retain  a  security  clearance.  He  has  a
bachelor’s degree, which was awarded in 2003. He has never married, and he has no
children.1
Applicant was involved in several alcohol-related criminal incidents. He was cited
in 1998 for minor in possession of alcohol. He was 18 years old at the time. He pleaded
guilty and paid a fine. Applicant testified that he was at a party when the police arrived.
He stated that he was not drinking, but there was alcohol at the party. He pleaded guilty
because his parents told him to accept responsibility.2
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2008  and  charged  with  driving  while  impaired  by
alcohol (DWI). He pleaded guilty and received probation before judgment for one year
and a $500 fine. The charge was dismissed after he successfully completed the terms
of his probation.3
Applicant testified that he had two beers with dinner over the course of about two
to three hours. He thought that he was fine to drive. He stated that he did well on the
field sobriety test, but there was a malfunction with the breathalyzer, so there were no
blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  results.  He  followed  his  attorney’s  advice  and
accepted  the  guilty  plea  and  probation  before  judgment  with  the  knowledge  that  the
charge would be dismissed if he completed the terms of the probation.4
Applicant  submitted  Questionnaires  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
2009  and  2014.  He  reported  the  above  two  incidents  in  both  SF  86s.  He  wrote  that  a
DUI “will not happen again.”5
Applicant was arrested in May 2017 and charged with driving under the influence
of alcohol (DUI). In November 2017, he pleaded guilty to DWI, and the DUI charge was
dismissed. He was sentenced to 60 days in the county detention center, with all 60 days
suspended,  and  supervised  probation  for  18  months.  As  part  of  his  probation,  he  was
ordered  to  attend  a  victim  impact  panel.  His  state  required  him  to  install  an  interlock
system on his car’s ignition for one year, which he successfully completed without any
violations. He will remain on probation until May 2019.6

Applicant testified that he went to dinner with a friend, and he had two large shots
of tequila over the course of a long evening. He again felt that he was fine to drive. He
was stopped after making a right turn while at a red light. He stated that he did not see
that there was a no turn on red sign. He believes he passed the field sobriety test, but
he  refused  to  take  a  breathalyzer.  He  testified  that  he  had  friends  who  were  lawyers
who  advised  him  that  if  he  was  ever  stopped  by  the  police,  he  should  refuse  the
breathalyzer.7
Applicant  attended  and  completed  alcohol  counseling  from  June  2017  to
November  2017.  He  completed  26  sessions,  which  included  group  and  individual
sessions.  His  counselor,  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker  (LCSW),  reported  that
Applicant  showed  marked  improvement  throughout  the  course  of  treatment,  and  that
Applicant “showed sincere remorse and shame about the fact that he did not learn from
his first offense which led to his second arrest.8 The LCSW concluded:
As  with  any  human  behavior,  no  one  person  has  a  crystal  ball.  The  best
we can do is look for sustained improvement in behavior and judgment. It
is  in  my  professional  opinion  that  [Applicant]  not  only  successfully
completed  treatment  but  went  on  to  demonstrate  to  me  that  he  has
learned from his mistakes and genuinely expresses sincere motivation to
continue in his commitment to sobriety.9
Applicant informed his supervisor at work that he was arrested for DUI. Applicant
testified that he benefited greatly from the counseling. He decided to completely abstain
from  alcohol.  He  has  not  had  a  drink  since  January  2018.  He  assures  that  he  has
learned from his mistakes, and the conduct will not be repeated.10
Applicant is highly regarded, as reported by three witnesses. He is praised for his
excellent job performance, trustworthiness, responsibility, work ethic, and integrity. The
witnesses recommended that he retain his security clearance11

"Applicant  is  37  years  old  and  single.  He  reports  no  children.  He  was  born  in
Baghdad,  Iraq  and  he  served  as  a  linguist  for  a  federal  contractor  attached  to  armed
forces of the United States from 2003 to 2009. (GE 1, Tr. 15, 35) He went on more than
1,000  combat  patrols.  (Tr.  86)  Applicant  has  one  brother,  age  30,  who  served  as  a
linguist  in  support  of  U.S.  Marines  in  Iraq  for  five  years.  (Tr.  36)  He  also  has  three
sisters  still  living  in  different  cities  in  Iraq  with  their  husbands  and  families.  Their  ages
are 31, 39, and 42. Applicant’s parents moved from Iraq to Syria in 2005 and remained
for  three  years.  (Tr.  38-39)  Next,  they  moved  to  Turkey  due  to  the  instability  in  Syria.
Applicant moved to the U.S. in 2009 on a special immigrant visa program and he was
naturalized in 2014. (Tr. 15)
Applicant’s  mother  served  in  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  Iraq  for  22  years,  and
his father retired from the Iraqi Army as a major in 1989-’90, after more than 20 years of
service.    (Tr.  30-31)  Applicant  provided  financial  support  of  $250,  once  a  month  from
2010-2016,  to  his  parents  for  such  things  as  medical  bills.  (Tr.  39)  They  are  refugees
residing  in  Turkey.  Applicant  has  telephonic  contact  with  his  parents  once  or  twice  a
week. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant has filed an application with the Embassy in Turkey to try to
move  them  to  the  U.S.  on  a  visa.  His  brother  tutors  school  children  in  Iraq.  They  last
had  contact  more  than  three  years  ago.  (Tr.  43)  Applicant’s  two  oldest  sisters  are
teachers in Iraq and his youngest sister never worked. (Tr. 44) In addition to providing
financial support to his parents, as needed, Applicant gave his youngest sister $900 to
help  her  buy  a  car.  (Tr.  45)  His  telephonic  contact  with  his  sisters  varies  from  once
every two weeks to once a month. He has no property in Iraq, and held a bank account
there briefly from 2008-2009. (Tr. 89)
Applicant  submitted  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on  February  28,
2017.2  In  section  22  (Police  Record)  of  his  SCA,  he  answered  “no”  to  all  questions
about  being  issued  any  summons,  citations,  tickets  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal
proceeding  etc. Applicant failed to disclose  the  civil  summons,  4  criminal  summonses,
25  citations  and  18  traffic  warnings  that  he  received  between  November  2010  and
September  2016.  (GE  4-11)  He  admitted  all  of  these  traffic  violations  in  his  Answer.
Applicant submitted AE A, an updated state division of motor vehicles driving record, to
show that he has not had any vehicle violations since 2015. Applicant testified credibly
that he may have misinterpreted the questions in this section of the SCA but since all of
his  citations  involved  fines  of  less  than  $300,  he  was  not  required  to  report  them.  (Tr.
82) Since all of the charges against him alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.a–2.e were dismissed and
Applicant  served  no  community  service,  paid  no  fines,  and  had  no  consequences,  he
misunderstood  and  believed  he  did  not  have  to  report  these  in  his  SCA.  (Tr.  83)  To
corroborate his testimony on this point, he did disclose his arrest for domestic violence
1  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  basis  for  these  findings  of  fact  is  Applicant’s  Questionnaire  for  National
Security  Positions  (SCA)  dated  February  28,  2017  (GE  1)  and  the  summaries  of  personal  subject
interviews conducted on July 27, 2017, and December 8, 2017. (GE 2)

in  2015  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  and  protective  order  against  him,  as  well  as  the  arrest  for
communicating  threats  in  2016,  to the  clearance  investigator  in  his  December  8,  2017
clearance interview. (GE 2, Tr. 117) He disclosed this offense because it is the only one
where he went to trial.
In September 2011, Applicant lived with his girlfriend. They had a disagreement
and when he tried to move out, she gave him only half of his personal property. (Tr. 58)
She tried to shove him out the door and he allegedly pushed her. The judge dismissed
this complaint at SOR ¶ 2.a. (Tr. 58) In SOR ¶ 2.b, Applicant lent $250 to a female co-
worker  who  was  in  financial  distress  in  January  2015.  He  asked  her  for  a  check  to
secure this loan, which he would only cash after she became solvent. (Tr. 60-63) When
he  later  tried  to  cash  the  check,  he  found  that  there  were  insufficient  funds  in  her
account  and  confronted  her.  She  tried  to  snatch  the  cold  check  out  of  his  hand  and
called police. He was charged with trespassing and the judge summarily dismissed that
complaint and had her arrested for uttering a false instrument. (Tr. 63) In August 2015,
a  mentally  ill  neighbor  alleged  that  Applicant  committed  simple  assault,  but  promptly
dropped  the  charges. (GE  6, Tr. 63)  Again, Applicant  was  arrested for  communicating
threats against a former business partner in March 2016, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, and
that charge was dismissed by the judge on May 16, 2016. (GE 8)
Applicant  obtained  his  commercial  driver’s  license  (CDL)  and  operated  a
transportation  company  from  2013-2017.  (Tr.  52)  He  received  numerous  citations  for
driving infractions during that period. (Tr. 55) Applicant testified that he started driving in
Iraq  when  he  was  14  years  old,  and  he  was  accustomed  to  driving  unimpeded  by
restrictions on speed, and rules and regulations. (Tr. 75) He had difficulty assimilating to
the rules of the road and driving laws when he moved to the U.S. at age 28. Although
he studied a safe driving booklet, passed a written exam, and took a state road test to
obtain his state driver’s license in 2009, he had a habit of speeding. (GE 9, 10, 11, Tr.
77)
Applicant  testified  credibly  that  despite  his  astonishing  number  of  driving
offenses,  his  state  license  was  never  suspended,  and  it  is  still  valid.  (Tr.  80,  AE  A)
Instead, he would routinely hire an attorney who  would go into state court and get the
driving offense reduced to improper equipment (odometer), and pay a fine – 25 times.
(Tr.  79)  Despite  this  ruse,  Applicant  was  aware  that  the  problem  was  not  a  defective
odometer.  (Tr.  123)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  took  too  long  to  change  his  driving
habits,  but  he  did  so.  (Tr.  79)  He  was  recently  issued  a  warning  in  2018  because  he
was driving his girlfriend’s car, which had an improperly displayed license plate. (Tr. 96)
Applicant  was  involved  in  a  civil  dispute  with  one  of  his  former  employee-truck
drivers, after that driver abandoned one of his trucks and left it unattended. (Tr. 12, GE
7) He was charged with simple assault on the other CDL driver in August 2015 at SOR
¶  2.d.  The  state  court  judge  dismissed  this  criminal  complaint  against  Applicant  on
September  28,  2015.  (GE  7)  Then,  a  civil  action  ensued  between  Applicant  and  the
same  driver  for  $4,500  that  Applicant  loaned  the  driver.  It  was  resolved  for  $4,500  in
Applicant’s favor.  (Tr. 72)  Applicant  reasonably  stated  that  he  had  no  reason  to  report
this  civil  action  in  his  favor,  in  his  SCA,  and  he  did  not  intend  to  falsify  that  form  or
deceive the government as alleged in SOR ¶ 3.c because this is all a matter of public
court records. (Tr. 114, 118, GE 7,12)
Applicant submitted AE B–K, which are character reference letters, and AE L-N,

Armed  Forces.  Notably,  he  served  coalition  forces  with  bravery  and  distinction  since
2006.  An  Army  Brigadier  General  stated  “service  of  local  national  translators  who  risk
their  safety,  and  that  of  their  families,  to  support  the  mission  and  U.S.  soldiers,  is
invaluable.”  (AE  B)  Applicant  was  first  employed  by  the  U.S.  military  as  a  general
laborer in 2004 in Iraq. Then, he served in direct support of combat units including the
82nd Airborne Division, and 2nd and 3rd Brigade Combat Teams, 4th Infantry Division, as
an Arabic translator. He performed so well that he was added to Army civil action teams
in 2008. (AE C-N)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  custodian  employed  by  a  community  rehabilitation
foundation.  He  has  worked  on  a  military  installation  since  August  2016.  He  did  not
complete high school. He had kidney failure in June 2000, was hospitalized, underwent
a  kidney  transplant  and  dialysis,  and  was  supported  by  Social  Security  disability
payments. He was incarcerated from November 2010 to July 2012 and unemployed after
his release from prison until December 2012. He worked as a cook for a private-sector
employer  from  December  2012  to  February  2013.  He  worked  as  a  custodian  for  his
current  employer  from  February  2013  to  November  2014.  He  applied  for  a  security
clearance  in  December  2014,  but  it  was  denied.  (Form  Item  6  at  7.)  He  worked  as  a
custodian  in  the  private  sector  from  November  2014  until  he  began  his  current
employment.
Applicant married in August 2009 and separated in November 2010. He has no
contact with his wife and does not know where she lives. He is still married because he
cannot  afford  a  divorce.  (FORM  Item  6  at  2.)  He  has  four  adult  children  from  other
previous relationships and a nine-year-old grandchild who lives with him. (FORM Item 4
at 24-26; FORM Item 6 at 2.)
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (FORM Item 4) unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
Between  1992  and  1995,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  numerous  traffic  offenses,
including  driving  without  a  license,  driving  while  under  the  influence,  and  leaving  the
scene of an accident. (FORM Item 7 at 1-2.) These offenses were not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  was  arrested  in  April  2003  for  three  counts  of  negotiating  worthless
checks. He had an acquaintance who printed fake checks, using the names of businesses
listed  in  the  phone  book.  Applicant  cashed  the  checks  and  gave  his  acquaintance  a
percentage of the proceeds. He was arrested after his third transaction with a fake check.
He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 20 days and a fine. He was placed
on probation for two years and ordered to pay restitution. (FORM Item 8 at 4.) This offense
is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
Applicant was arrested in September 2006 for felony possession of a forged check
for $418. In the October 2014 PSI, he told an investigator that he received the check from
a cousin and thought it was valid. (Form Item 5 at 4.) He was still on probation, which was
revoked.  He  was  convicted  and  sentenced  to  imprisonment  for  five  years,2  fined,  and
required to pay restitution. (FORM Item 8 at 4-5.) He was on probation from July 2007 to
November 2010. (FORM Item 3 at 32.) This offense is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b.
Applicant was charged with felony possession of a forged instrument in January
2010. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for five years, fined, and required
to pay restitution. He was incarcerated from November 2010 to July 2012. (FORM Item 3
at 31; FORM Item 7 at 4.) This offense is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c.
During the October 2014 PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he committed the
bad-check  crimes  because  he  was  unemployed  and  needed  money.  He  also  told  the
investigator  that  being  incarcerated  gave  him  time  to  reflect  on  his  life  and  led  him  to
make better life choices. (FORM Item 6 at 4.)
Applicant’s criminal record involving financial crimes is alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c
under Guideline J and cross-alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a under Guideline F. In addition, SOR ¶¶
2.b-2.e allege four delinquent debts reflected in Applicant’s credit report from April 2018
(FORM Item 11.). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 2.b: child-support arrearage of $155,800. Applicant owes child support
for three children. His credit reports reflect that in March 2015, his arrearage was $14,065.
(FORM Item 9 at 1.) In April 2017, it was $150,597. (FORM Item 10 at 3.) In April 2018,
it was $155,800. (FORM Item 11 at 1.) Court records reflect as of June 25, 2018, he owed
$91,672 for Child  #1; $52,663 for Child #2; and $12,813 for Child #3. (Attachments to
Answer, pages 1-5.) During the December 2017 PSI, he told the investigator that he fell
behind on child-support payments while he was hospitalized and unable to work. He told
the  investigator  that  he  is  paying  a  total  of  $150  per  month,  which  is  automatically
deducted from his pay. He is making no progress, because his credit reports reflect that

three years.
the amount of arrearage is increasing. He told an investigator that he expects to be paying
the arrearage for the rest of his life. (FORM Item 6 at 7.)
SOR ¶ 2.c: telecommunications bill placed for collection of $431. During the
December  2017  PSI,  Applicant  told  an  investigator  that  this  debt  was  for  unreturned
equipment  and  that  he  had  forgotten  about  it.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  provided
evidence of a payment agreement providing for monthly $72 payments and evidence of
payments for July through December 2018. (Answer to SOR at 6-7.) This debt is being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 2.d: credit-card account past due for $75, with a total balance of $409.
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was making payments on this debt
under a verbal agreement to pay $50 per month. He submitted no documentation of an
agreement or any payments.
SOR ¶ 2.e: credit-union charged off for $250. During the December 2017 PSI,
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  this  debt  was  a  “crunch  loan”  that  he  had  forgotten
about.  (FORM  Item  6  at  8.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  he  was  making
weekly payments of $25. He submitted a receipt for one $25 payment in July 2018, but
no evidence of any further payments. (Answer to SOR at 8)
In  the  October  2014  PSI,  Applicant  told  a  security  investigator  that  his  financial
situation was “not very good,” and he was barely able to pay his bills on time. (FORM
Item 5 at 6.) In the December 2017 PSI, he told a security investigator that his overall
financial situation is “good,” but he provided no specific information about his income and
expenses. (FORM Item 6 at 9.)

"Applicant is 34 years old. He obtained his general equivalency diploma (GED) in
2002  and  his  master  welder’s  license  in  2007.  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  a
master welder by a federal contractor since 2017. He reports no military service and he
married in May 2016. Applicant has two daughters, age 3 months, and 10 years old. In
section 22 (Police Record) of his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86)
or  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  he  disclosed  an  arrest  for  driving  under  the
influence  (DUI)  in  July  2012.  He  pled  guilty  to  a  reduced  charge  of  reckless  driving  in
April  2013. He  completed probation and  community  service;  paid  fines and  costs;  and
attended  mandatory,  court-ordered  DUI-counseling  sessions  one  day  each  week  from
April to October 2013. He disclosed another arrest for DUI in November 2016.
The SOR alleges that Applicant was also arrested for DUI and criminal mischief
in  July  2005  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant  pled  no  contest  to  reduced  charges  of  reckless
driving  and  criminal  mischief  in  October  2005,  and  he  was  sentenced  to  one  year
probation  and  ordered  to  complete  a  DUI  level  one  program.  Applicant  admitted  all  of
the  allegations  in  the  SOR  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  in  July  2018.  (Item  3)  He  also
admitted  to  five  other  driving  offenses  including:  driving  while  license  suspended  in
2006, 2008, and 2017 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.e, and 1.i) and driving in violation of court-ordered
license  restrictions  in  2007  and  2013  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.g).  Additionally,  Applicant
admitted being charged with possession of drug paraphernalia in January 2007. (SOR ¶
1.c)  State  court  records  provided  by  Department  Counsel  corroborate  Applicant’s
admissions and confirm his multiple criminal offenses. (Items 6 – 7)
In his personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant stated that his latest November
2016 DUI occurred after he had dinner and three beers with friends and he was pulled
over  by  police.  Applicant’s  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  was  .09  and  the  state  law
threshold  for  DUI  is  .08  BAC.  Again,  he  paid  fines  and  $2,000  in  court  costs  plus  25
hours of community service, and one year probation. He completed mandatory alcohol
abuse  counseling  in  January  2018,  and  his  license  was  revoked  for  one  year.
Nonetheless,  Applicant  continued  to  drive  since  he  needed  to  get  to  work  and  felt  he
had  no  other  choice.  In  2007,  when  he  was  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana,  it
was  provided  to  him  at  a  party.  He  never  purchased  or  sold  marijuana,  and  claims  to
have used it only this one time. (Item 5, pp. 20-21)
Applicant denied the cross-alleged violations under Guidelines G and E, at SOR
¶¶  2  and  3.  He  ascribes  his  afore-mentioned  mistakes  to  youthful  immaturity  in  his
answer  to  the  SOR.  He  professes  his  intent  to  not  re-offend.  Applicant  provided  no
response  to  the  FORM  or  character  references  or  performance  evaluations.  He
provided no documentary evidence that he attends treatment or Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA) or other support groups, or that he has acknowledged his longstanding pattern of

"In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations.  He is 33 years
old.  He  is  divorced  and  has  four  children.  Applicant  completed  his  security  clearance
application in June 2016. He has not previously held a security clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  2004  and  attended  a  technical  school,
earning  a  degree  in  aviation  in  2011.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  as  an
electronic technician for eight years. He was unemployed for a period of six months in
2009. (GE 1)
Financial
The  SOR  ¶¶1.a-1.i  allege  two  child  support  collection  accounts;  four  collection
accounts;  one  charged-off  medical  account,  and  an  amended  state  tax  debt  for  about
$1,600. Applicant claimed that he has been paying his child support (deduction from his
pay check) and several other accounts. He stated that all his financial documents were
lost in a car accident in the spring. (Tr. 12)
Applicant  attributes  the  debts  to  his  overextending  himself  while  trying  to  take
care of his family. He explained that he decided to put off some creditors to pay others.
He  realizes  that  a  better approach  would  have  been  to  contact  the  creditors and  work
out  an  agreement.  (GE)  2  He  stated  that  he  has  reduced  his  spending  habits  and
concentrates  on  his  expenses.  Applicant  now  earns  about  $65,000  a  year,  which
depends  on  overtime.  He  is  paid  hourly.  (Tr.  38)  He  has  no  savings  and  little  in  his
checking account. He lives with his mother, and pays $100 a month in rent. (Tr. 39) He
uses his girlfriend’s car and pays the car insurance. (Tr. 71) He has not obtained credit
counseling. (Tr.57) He does not follow a budget.
As  to  SOR  1.a  ($13,000)  and  1.b  ($2,677),  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was
delinquent in child support, but explained that $432 is automatically deducted from his
pay  each  month.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not  pay  attention  and
money  was  not  deducted  for  child  support  in  2004  to  2008.  (Tr.  29-33)  He  does  not
know what the correct balances on his child support cases are at this time. (Tr. 36)
SOR  1.c  is  a  wireless  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,213.  Applicant
stated  that  he  is  now  making  payments  in  the  amount  of  $50  a  month.  (GE  2)  He
submitted one document that showed $50 was debited from his bank account on June
18, 2019. He stated at the hearing that he has a $400 balance, and he claims that he
started paying in 2016. (Tr. 21, 43)
As  to  SOR  1.d,  a  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $1,742,  for  a  security
system, Applicant intends to pay the amount due on the account, but he has not had the
money to do so yet. (Tr. 22)
SOR  1.e  is  a  medical  account  in  collection  for  $828.  He  has  not  made  any
payments on the account. He believes that the bill was for hospital visits.
SOR 1.f is a charged-off account in the amount of $455. He stated at the hearing
that he is paying $50 a month. (Tr. 23) He submitted no documentation. During his 2017
OPM interview, he stated that he would contact the creditor and make arrangements to
pay the account in full. (GE 2)
SOR 1.g is a collection account for the same debt that is listed in 1.d. However,
the  amount  is  $296.  He  stated  that  he  would  pay  when  he  was  able.  (Tr.  23)  He
believes they were two separate accounts. (GE 2)
As to SOR 1. h, a collection account for $600, Applicant stated that it has been
paid.  (Tr.  24)  He  submitted  documentation  that  reflected  a  payment  of  $25  that  was
made on October 6, 2018, showing a balance of $149.32. During his 2017 investigative
interview, he noted that there were two different accounts and that he cannot remember
which one he has paid in full.
The amended SOR 1.i represents a paper that Applicant brought to the hearing.
It is a letter dated November 21, 2018, showing a payment agreement for state taxes.
The payment plan was established for a period of 16 months paying $105.63 a month.
(GE  6)  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  that  he  has  been  paying  every  month.  (Tr.
53) He had no documentation to support his claim.
Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
The SOR alleges under AG ¶¶ 2.a-2.b that Applicant purchased marijuana on or
about October 2017, and information set below under criminal conduct.
SOR  2.a  alleges  and  Applicant  admits  that  he  purchased  marijuana  in  October
2017.  He  explained  that  he  was  buying  the  marijuana  for  his  girlfriend.  He  was
instructed to stop at a rest stop off a major highway, where he purchased the marijuana
($60) for his friend. (Tr. 58) As he was driving home, he was stopped by a police officer
for tinted windows. (GE 2, Tr. 62) The officer searched the car and found the marijuana
in the glove compartment. Applicant stated that he does not use marijuana or any illegal
drugs. (Tr. 62) Applicant received a criminal citation and made a plea agreement. (GE
5)  He  spent  a  night  in  jail.  He  has  had  this  expunged  from  his  record.  He  no  longer
associates with that friend. He understands that this was a “dumb mistake.”  He did not
report this incident to his FSO for fear of losing his job. (Tr. 64)
SOR 2.b alleges the criminal information in AG 3.a, that Applicant was charged
with  possession  of marijuana  in  October 2017. This  is the  same  incident  as  described
above under Guideline H.
Criminal Conduct
SOR AG 3.a alleges that Applicant was charged in October 2017 for possession
of marijuana. This has been discussed as cross-alleged under the above guideline.
SOR AG 3.b alleges the information as set forth in subparagraph 2.a. Again, this
is the same incident in October 2017 to which Applicant admitted.
Personal Conduct
SOR AG 4.a cross alleges the information as set forth under paragraph 2.a and
3.a  (drug  involvement  and  criminal  conduct)  as  adverse  personal  conduct  under  this
guideline. This is the same information that has been addressed above.

aviation field in some capacity since age 12. (Tr. 42) He reports no military service. He
married  in  1990  and  divorced  in  1998  with  no  children.  Applicant  taught  himself
computer coding and he started software companies in the 1980s. (Tr. 45) His company
employed  85  people and had  $45 million  in annual  sales  when  Applicant  was  age  29.
(Tr. 48) Applicant moved south to a different state in 2016 to get away from a gritty and
deleterious lifestyle and start a job with a major federal contractor. (Tr. 91)
Applicant  admits  he  was  arrested  in  February  2008  and  charged  with
possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  and  driving  while  impaired.  (Answer)  Applicant
testified that he sustained a devastating leg injury in 2003 and he was unable to work
through  2008.  (Tr.  51,  53,  56,  AE  E,  H)  He  had  invested  his  life  savings  in  his  small
business. Since he had no insurance, he lost everything. (Answer) He was attempting to
rebuild  his  business  and  facilitate  investors,  when  he  went  out  with  an  associate  who
used drugs. (Tr. 57-58) They had a beer together and then the associate drove them to
a house party where the associate and others used cocaine. Applicant testified credibly
he  did  not  use  cocaine  that  evening;  although  he  did  use  it  previously  following  his
injury. (Tr. 67)  He wanted to leave the party. (Tr. 58)  His associate said “take my keys”
and  Applicant  drove  away.  He  was  stopped  by  police  and  admitted  to  having  a  beer.
The vehicle owner’s girlfriend left her coat in the back seat. When Applicant authorized
a  search  of  the  vehicle,  police  found  cocaine  and  drug  paraphernalia  in  the  coat.  He
was arrested. He no longer associates with the vehicle owner or the coat owner.
Although  the  driving  while  impaired  charge  was  dismissed,  Applicant  was
convicted  of  possession  of  a  controlled  substance  (found  in  the  female’s  coat)  and
sentenced  to  three  years’  probation,  court  costs,  and  a  fine.  (Tr.  64-66)  In  section  22

Applicant  admits  that  he  was  stopped  by  police  in  July  2008  and  charged  with
unlicensed  operation  of  a  vehicle,  running  a  red  light,  and  driving  an  unregistered
vehicle.  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  amended  at  the  outset  of  the  hearing  to  reflect  that  he  was
“stopped” by police and not “arrested.” (Tr. 11-12) Applicant admits to the allegation as
amended. He received a citation and failed to appear in court. He has paid all fees and
fines associated with that traffic stop, and the warrant that issued (for failure to appear)
has  been  rescinded  in  September  2018.  (Tr.  85,  AE  A,  F)  Applicant  states  that  2008
was a bad year and he struggled with depression as a result of his crippling injury and
loss of his business. (Tr. 15, 67) He later treated with a clinical master social worker in
2016. (Tr. 91-92)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  was  also  arrested  for  driving  while  impaired
(DWI) in March 1999. (SOR ¶ 1.d) He admits to this offense twenty years ago, and he
pled  guilty  and  paid  all  fines  and  court  costs  associated  with  it.  (Tr.  53-55)  He  also
admits  that  he  was  arrested  in  April  2017  for  DWI  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  Applicant
testified that he was very ill and suffering from bronchitis and allergies at the time. (Tr.

and cough medicine, prior to the arrest. (Tr. 103, 124) He was pulled over by police who
said Applicant had swerved erratically while driving to a convenience mart at 2:00 a.m.
to get throat lozenges. (Tr. 102) Applicant testified he was having a coughing fit. When
he was pulled over, he was unsteady on his feet due to the devastating injury. (Tr. 102)
He  took  a  breathalyzer  that  registered  zero  blood-alcohol  content.  (Tr.  104)  He  was
found  guilty  of  failure  to  use  due  care  while  driving  since  he  was  operating  under  the
influence of cough medicine. (Tr. 105, GE 4, AE D) Applicant paid a $1,500 dollar fine.

2.a. and 2.b. In July of 2006, and again in September of 2006, more than twelve
years ago, Applicant was involved domestic disputes with his newly-married wife. (TR at
page 21 line 6 to page 27 line 16, and at page 28 line 22 to page 30 line 4.) As a result
of  both  incidents  he  was  charged,  but  the  charges  were  subsequently  dismissed.  (Id.)
He  has  attended  anger  management  classes,  and  they  both  have  attended  “marriage
conferences.” (TR at page 21 line 6 to page 27 line 16, at page 28 line 22 to page 30
line 4, and AppX A at page 1.) They have been happily married “for over 12 years,” as
attested to by Applicant’s wife. (AppX A at page 1.) She avers that they “are devoted to
one another and . . . are committed to make this marriage last.” (Id.)

"Applicant admitted all allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1 and 2, although he indicated they
are not consistent with his current character. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Financial
The SOR alleges in (1.a) under Guideline J, an October 2007 guilty plea to felony
charges of mail fraud and aiding and abetting and willfully causing an act to be done. It
further alleges a June 2008 sentencing of 12 months and 1 day of imprisonment and 5
years  of  supervised  release.  Applicant  was  ordered  to  pay  restitution  to  his  former
employer  in  the  amount  of  $913,000.  It  cross  alleges  under  Guideline  E,  the  same
information (2.a). Applicant admitted both allegations.
Applicant  is  a  64-year-old  security  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor.  He  is
married  and  has  three  adult  children  and  four  grandchildren.  He  received  his
undergraduate degree in 1975, master’s degree in 1977, and his doctorate in 1990.  His
doctorate is in artificial intelligence, statistics, and computer science. Applicant has been
with his current employer since April 2013.
Applicant began a career in the academic world in approximately 1990. He was a
lecturer at various universities and worked for a school system, and became the director
of  information  systems  and  instructional  technology  until  1997.    Because  of  his  great
success  in  the  school  system  in  implementing  technology,  he  was  invited  by  a  board
member to join the corporate world.  (Tr. 77)
Applicant  accepted  a  position  with  a  bank  and  used  his  impressive  skills  to
completely restructure the bank’s information system so that  it could efficiently service
its customers with faster service. He was given six months to accomplish this enormous
task.  (Tr. 81) He was quite successful in that environment.
At  one  point  in  1998,  he  began  a  “trek  down  a  slippery  slope”.  He  was  given
materials for free and then charged by a contractor for billable hours. He knew this was
not quite right. (Tr. 93) He stated that he thought it was “kind of fraudulent.”  He stated
that the  environment at  the  bank presented  various  opportunities on  different  levels to
scam  money  from  the  bank.  (Tr.  95)  He  was  asked  to  note  things  that  were  not  an
employee  expense  on  invoices.  He  was  asked  to  set  up  personal  “point  of  sale
technology” and charge it to the bank. Applicant saw that a cycle of behavior had begun
that was not legal. He admits that he should have stopped at that point, and he regrets
that he did not. He admits that he had never been tempted like that before. He saw that
it  became  easier  and  easier  to  continue  down  the  illegal  path.  (Tr.  98)  He  began
receiving  gifts  in  1998,  such  as  a  car  for  his  illegal  acts.  He  continued  engaging  in
criminal conduct and in 2002 he learned about “soft dollars.” (Tr. 103) In essence, every
market trade made on every dollar produced a kickback. (Tr. 104-105)
Applicant used some of the money that he illegally made to remodel his house or
help his family. (Tr.108) He felt conflicted about his behavior, but he continued. A shell
corporation  came  into existence. At  this  point  Applicant had  about $400,000  of money
that was gained illegally. (Tr. 118)  He did not document the money for tax purposes. He
knew he was scamming at that point or basically stealing money. (Tr.119) In about late
2003 or 2004, an investigation occurred and the bank‘s managing partner told Applicant
if he resigned, he would get six month’s severance pay. (Tr. 124)
In 2006, Applicant was investigated by the SEC for his misappropriation of funds.
(GE 3) Applicant pled guilty to the felony charges of mail fraud and aiding and abetting.
(GE 2) He was sentenced to prison in 2008, as described in the SOR. He had five years
of supervised release. He was ordered to pay restitution to his former employer in the
amount of $913,000. (GE 4)
Applicant  completed  his  sentence  without  incident.  His  supervised  release  was
terminated in 2011. (AE H) He used his time to help other inmates obtain a GED and he
became  a  trusted  prisoner.  He  testified  at  the  hearing  that  he  has  no  idea  why  he
committed  the  crimes.  His  mother and father died  in  part due to  his sentencing.  He  is
sincerely  remorseful and he  cannot  justify  the  behavior.  (Tr. 134) He  tutors children  in
the local community. Applicant received an award from one employer in 2015 for group
achievement. (AE I)
Applicant’s  probation  was  decreased  from  five  years  to  two.  He  is  making
contributions to his community. He has been paying the restitution. (GE 5)  He has paid
$250 a month since 2011. He owes about $800,000. (GE 5, AE J)
Applicant presented three witnesses who testified that he is  worthy of a security
clearance  despite  the  criminal  behavior.  His  current  employer  stated  that  he  told  her
immediately at the interview about the criminal conviction. She believes he is forthright
and has valuable technical credentials. (Tr. 18) He has no authority over any funds. In
his current position. (Tr. 20) A former employee of the bank testified that he worked with
Applicant  from  1999  to  2004.  Applicant  was  a  respected  boss  and  empowered  his
employees to accomplish things. There was a memo from the bank that Applicant just
resigned.  (AE  F)  He  was  not  aware  of  the  criminal  behavior  that  ensured  at  the  bank
with  Applicant.  He  saw  Applicant  after  his  release  from  prison  and  saw  that  he  was
depressed and remorseful. (Tr. 42) This witness has no concerns about future criminal
behavior on Applicant’s part. (Tr. 46) A third witness testified on Applicant’s behalf, but
did not know the particulars of the criminal behavior. (Tr. 52)
Applicant presented six written affidavits from various people who know him as a
patriot and a good man. His sister and wife attest that he was wrong for what he did but
he has paid a dear price. His cousin states that Applicant has turned his life around and
deserves a chance. A friend who has known Applicant since 2007, and holds a security
clearance,  understands  the  nature  of  the  criminal  activity  but  believes  that  Applicant
would not compromise any sensitive information. A longtime friend of Applicant’s states
that Applicant is deserving of a second chance. (AE A-E)
Personal Conduct
During  Applicant’s  2017  investigative  interview,  he  did  not  disclose  his  criminal
behavior, but rather stated that he resigned  his job from the bank rather than be fired.
(GE 4) He also did not  disclose that he quit his employment with  his bank in his 2005
security clearance application. (GE 3) After he left the bank, he did not tell anyone about
his criminal behavior (except his  attorneys). Applicant was given  a polygraphs in 2005
and 2006, during which he initially denied criminal involvement with the bank. (GE 3, Tr.
155)  Applicant  also  failed  to  disclose  his  criminal  activity  to  a  subsequent  employer
because he feared that he would not get hired. (Tr. 159) In his latest security clearance
application,  he  inaccurately  stated  the  reason  for  leaving  the  bank.  When  cross
examined  at the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  that  he  did  not  read  everything  correctly
and that he really did not understand the questions.
Applicant  submitted  five  letters  of  recommendation.  Each  reference  from  a
former employer knew Applicant for at least two years and described him as honest with
a positive attitude. Applicant has exceptional organization and communication skills. He
is  reliable  and  motivated.  One  letter  of  recommendation  commended  Applicant  for  his
ability to encourage students and build self-esteem. He attends church and is a member
of his church community.
",False
"In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR 1.a concerning his termination
from  his  employment  after  he  allegedly  stole  a  company  laptop.  Although  he  was
terminated from his job  on  June  6,  2017,  he  did  not  steal the  laptop  at  issue.  He  was
authorized  to  carry  in  and  take  laptops  (and  other  equipment)  out  of  the  special
compartmented information facility (SCIF) and into the storage area. He was not aware
of  a  change  in  corporate  policy  disallowing  his  access  to  the  storage  area.  He  denied
SOR 1.b in part because he knew he was terminated for violating corporate policy, but
did  not  know  the  specific  reasons  why.  Applicant’s  denial  of  SOR  1.c  is  based  on  his
belief  he  provided  truthful  information  to  the  OPM  investigator  in  the  March  2018  PSI,
although  he  was  still  unaware  of  the  specific  reasons  for  his  termination.  Applicant
denied SOR 2.a because he did not commit a criminal offense when he used the laptop.
He  never  attempted  to  steal  the  laptop.  He  denied  that  he  failed  to  comply  with  rules
applying  to  information  technology  systems  as  alleged  under  SOR  3.a.  He  followed
policy and protocols in regularly handling laptops in the SCIF. If he had known about the
new restrictive policies, he would have complied with them. (September 2018 answer to
SOR)
Appellant  is  58  years  old.  He  has  been  married  to  his  second  wife  since  1986
and  has  two  adult-aged  children.  Applicant  served  in  the  United  States  Navy  (USN)
from  1978  until  his  honorable  discharge  in  1998.  In  2005  and  2006,  he  took  some
courses online. Since December 2017, he has been working for a defense contractor as
an  information  systems  security  manager.  Before  his  current  job,  he  worked  for  six
months  with  another contractor,  but  left his position  due  to a  reduction  in  job  benefits.
Between April 2013 and his termination in June 2017 (SOR 1.a), he was employed as a
corporate  information  security  manager  by  a  defense  contractor.  From  2005  to  April
2013,  Applicant  was  an  information  security  manager  for  another  contractor;  his
supervisor  during  this  period  was  the  vice  president  of  government  security  who
terminated  Applicant  in  June  2017.  Applicant  is  certified  as  an  information  system
security  professional. He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since 1978.  (GE  1 at 8-40; Tr.
14-17; AE E; AE F)
SOR 1.a – Applicant was terminated by his employer on June 6, 2017 for alleged
theft  of  a  company  laptop.  In  the  June  2017  termination  letter,  the  vice  president  of
government  security  indicated  that  Applicant’s  conduct  resulted  in  a  series  of  security
violations  as  outlined  in  the  company’s  “Master  System  Security  Plan.”  The  vice
president  and  others  saw  Applicant  in  a  video  on  January  25,  2017  removing  an
unclassified  laptop  from  the  storage  area.  The  vice  president  determined  that:  (1)
Applicant  had  violated  company  policy  and  government  security  regulations;  and  (2)
Applicant  performed  a  willful  action  inconsistent  with  his  job  duties  and  classification.
The second allegation appears to be a restatement of the first allegation using different
words, with the addition of the word “willful.” Applicant never saw the final investigation
report (June 6, 2017); he saw the termination letter (June 6, 2017) for the first time two
weeks  before  the  hearing.  He  did  not  dispute  the  termination  because  he  violated  the
policy prohibiting his access to the storage areas. However, Applicant was unaware of
the change in policy. (GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 1; Tr. 23-24, 54-57)
Applicant  did  not  steal  the  laptop.  In  preparation  for  a  security  inspection  on
January 25, 2017, he was asked to ensure the secure communication equipment in the
SCIF was  working  properly.  To  check  the  system,  he  reviewed  the  instructions for the
secure telephone equipment  (STE) which indicated that the phone software should be
tested  and  updated  as  required.  In  order  to  check  the  software,  the  phone  had  to  be
connected to a laptop and the system checked as necessary. (GE 2 at 2-3; Tr. 24)
Applicant determined that he needed a laptop from the storage area. Based on a
specific addendum for a classified customer (which Applicant previously received at an
identified date), he had authority to transfer unclassified equipment in and out of SCIF
so  that  he  could  perform  project-related  tasks.  He  disabled  some  of  the  functions  and
turned  off  the  hard  drive  controller  of  the  laptop.  This  may  have  been  why,  during  the
subsequent  investigation,  management  thought  the  hard  drive  was  wiped  clean  after
they experienced a difficult time booting the system and getting the encryption module
of the laptop to engage. (Tr. 26-28, 32)
On  January  25,  2017,  Applicant  opened  up  the  storage  area  (identified  as  the
“storage  closet” and  “IT Storage  area”  in  the  government  exhibits) with  a  key  he been
provided  by  the  previous  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  when  he  was  hired  in  2013.
Applicant carried the laptop and cables from the storage area  to the SCIF and started
the STE check where he determined that the STE setting was incorrect. After adjusting
the  setting,  the  STE  phone  system  began  working  properly.  Applicant  provided  this
explanation  of  how  he  used  the  laptop  to  solve  the  STE  phone  problem  to  corporate
counsel  in  March  2017  and  to  the  vice  present  of  government  security  in  April  2017.
(GE 2 at 2-3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 1; Tr. 33, 34, 36, 65)
After successfully completing the STE test (January 25, 2017), Applicant learned
that  the  security  inspection  was  still  in  progress,  so  he  placed  the  laptop,  the  cables,
and some other equipment in a box outside the SCIF, in a specific area which was not
in  the  unsecured  area  where  other  equipment  was  checked  to  determine  its
classification. Because the security inspection was still ongoing, Applicant did not have
time  to  clear  the  laptop  and  return  it  to  the  storage  area  as  required  by  standard
procedure. Unfortunately, he forgot about the laptop for about a month and a half. (GE 2
at 3; Tr. 30)
On March 9, 2017, corporate counsel and other members of management had a
meeting with Applicant about the missing laptop. The counsel presented Applicant with
a video dated January 25, 2017, showing him removing a laptop from the storage area.
Applicant did not recall taking the laptop. Counsel asked Applicant to ruminate about the
laptop’s  whereabouts,  then  call  the  counsel  and  return  it  to  the  director  of  special
programs.  Management  also  interrogated  Applicant  on  how  he  got  the  keys  for  the
storage area, but about a week later, dropped that part of the investigation when it was
determined Applicant had authority to possess the keys. (GE 2 at 2-3; GE 3 at 2; Tr. 30-
35, 59-61)
On  approximately  March  11,  2017,  the  security  officer  at  another  facility  of
Applicant’s company was having a problem with the STE system, and asked Applicant
for  assistance.  When  the  security  officer  mentioned  the  STE  issue,  Applicant
remembered  the  location  of  the  missing  laptop.  He  retrieved  the  laptop  from  the  box
outside the SCIF, and made sure it had not been restarted or “booted up.” After shutting
it  down,  he  called  corporate  counsel  and  turned  it  over  to  the  director  of  special
programs as requested. Applicant learned at a meeting in April 2017 that, unbeknownst
to  him,  there  had  been  a  change  in  corporate  policy  in  2016  that  only  government
security  solutions  personnel  were  allowed  access  to  the  storage  area.  The  policy
change meant he was no longer permitted access into the storage area. (GE 2 at 2-3;
GE 3 at 2; Tr. 28, 30-35, 47, 59-61, 64)
SOR  1.b  –  In  response  to  Section  13-A  Employment  Activities,  of  his  August
2017 e-QIP, Applicant stated that his reason for leaving his employment in June 2017
was  “terminated  employment.”  In  the  next  block  of  the  section,  Applicant  answered
affirmatively that the employment action occurred in the last 7 years. In the next block
requiring a summary of the reasons for leaving the employment, Applicant indicated he
was  “fired.”  In  response  to  the  reason  for  being  fired,  Applicant  indicated  “failure  to
follow corporate policy.” He indicated in his answer to the SOR that when he submitted
the August 2017 e-QIP, the only reason he knew for his June 2017 termination was a
violation  of  corporate  policy.  In  response  to  the  question  of  why  he  did  not  reveal  the
incident in his e-QIP, Applicant stated that he did not view the event as security-related
because  he  never  received  a  written  reprimand.  He  discovered  from  his  subsequent
employer  (June  2017  to  December  2017)  that  there  was  an  entry  in  the  DOD’s  Joint
Personnel  Adjudication  System  (JPAS)  for  a  security  incident  that  he  knew  nothing
about,  but  was  the  reason  he  was  required  to  resubmit  an  e-QIP.  (GE  3;  September
2018 answer to SOR; Tr. 43-45, 62-63)
SOR  1.c  –  As  noted  earlier in  the factual findings,  when  Applicant  provided  the
March 2018 PSI, he only knew that he was terminated June 2017 for violating company
policy.  In  the  March  2018  PSI,  he  provided  details  about  why  he  used  the  laptop  and
how  he  retrieved  it  after  remembering  where  he  put  the  device  outside  the  SCIF.
Applicant provided details of the security policies authorizing his access to the SCIF and
restoring  the  STE.  When  asked  about  employment  issues  at  his  former  employer,  he
provided wide-ranging detail about the laptop investigation between January and June
2017.  He  also  supplied  information  about  the  policy  change  disallowing  his  access  to
the storage room. (GE 2 at 2-4; GE 3; September 2018 answer to SOR; Tr. 45-47)
Applicant  explained  that  the  vice  president  of  government  security  wanted  to
build a large SCIF that would allow different customers (agencies) to use the SCIF area
at the same time, but at different  classification levels. Applicant told the vice president
that  customers  would  not  approve  the  configuration.  As  Applicant  predicted,  when  the
SCIF was completed, other customers declined to use it because they did not approve
of the configuration. They also cited a potential lack of control over a specific area within
the SCIF. (GE 2 at 2-4; GE 3; September 2018 answer to SOR; Tr. 38-40)
Applicant  believes  that  primary  reason  he  was  terminated  was  that  the  vice
president  of  government  security  made  him  a  “scapegoat”  after  the  company  spent  a
large sum of money to build the SCIF, then could not get the secured area certified. (GE
2 at 2-4; GE 3; September 2018 answer to SOR; Tr. 45-47)
Applicant denied that he stole the laptop (SOR 2.a). In late January 2017, during
an investigation by management to locate the missing laptop, an audit of the classified
systems  was  conducted  and  no  unusual  activity  by  Applicant  was  found  on  the
classified  systems.  Review  of  building  access  control  logs  did  not  reveal  any  unusual
building  activity.  Neither  SCIF  policies  nor  customer  data  was  compromised.  When
Applicant  recalled  where  he  had  left  the  laptop,  he  turned  it  over  to  the  director  of
special programs. Thus, Applicant placed the laptop in the box, intending to return it to
the storage area. He forgot about it, but he did not steal the laptop. (GE 3 at 1-3)
Applicant maintains that he did not misuse technology systems as alleged under
SOR 3.a. Rather, he followed all policies and rules and was authorized by the previous
security  officer  to  transfer  the  laptop  from  the  storage  area  to  fix  the  SCIF  system
because that was his job. (Tr. 46-47)
Applicant’s only other security violation occurred in 2013 with the same employer
who  terminated  him  in  June  2017.  In  the  2013  incident,  he  was  assigned  to  audit
classified  laptops  that  were  stored  in  a  safe  within  a  restricted  area.  He  removed  the
laptops  from  the  safe  and  began  auditing  them  individually  according  to  procedure.
Then,  he  thought  he  had  placed  all  the  laptops  back  in  the  safe,  but  inadvertently  left
one laptop unattended in a chair. Later the same day, another employee discovered the
unattended  laptop  and  reported  it.  A  two-person  audit  team  determined  that  no
classified  information  was  compromised  and  the  laptop  was  returned  to  the  safe.
Applicant received a written reprimand and was required to review the security policies
and procedures to prevent a recurrence. (GE 2 at 4)
Character Evidence
Applicant testified that before he was terminated in June 2017, his performance
was  very  good.  He  received  bonuses  and  in  an  unidentified  year,  he  was  selected  as
security person of the year.
Attached  to  Applicant’s  September  2018  answer  is  a  character  endorsement
from  the  security  services  team  lead  indicating  that  Applicant  began  working  on  a
project  with  a federal agency  in  December 2017. Since  that date,  Applicant  has made
significant contributions to the quality of security reviews. His contributions have helped
reduce  the  time  necessary  to  complete  the  reviews.  With  his  intelligence  and
experience,  the  team  lead  recommends  Applicant  for  a  security  clearance.  (AE  A,
attachment)
Applicant’s  friend  indicated  by  letter  dated  September  27,  2018,  that  he  has
known  Applicant  on  a  social  basis  since  2012.  In  that  time,  he  has  learned  that
Applicant  pays  a  high  degree  of  attention  to  detail  and  accuracy.  He  has  impressive
computer  skills.  The  friend,  who  is  retired  from  a  federal  agency,  considers  Applicant
honest and reliable. (AE D)
Applicant called two witnesses to testify about his character. Both had previously
provided letters of support, with one letter is dated in October 2018. Witness B testified
that he is retired from a DOD agency. He has held a security clearance since the 1970s.
He  worked  with  Applicant  for  a  contractor  from  1999  to  2005,  when  Applicant  left  to
work  for  another  contractor.  They  have  become  friends  over  the  years.  Witness  B
considered  Applicant  as  honest,  trustworthy,  and  a  good  family  man.  Applicant’s
computer knowledge has been beneficial for Witness B’s children. (AE B; Tr. 74-79)
Witness C currently works for a defense contractor. He has known Applicant for
about 33 years since they were in the USN. Even after Applicant told Witness C about
the events leading to his job termination in 2017, Witness C still recommends Applicant
for a security clearance. (AE C; Tr. 69-73)
",True
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact. He is 29 years old, single, and does not have any children. (Answer;
GE 1; AE A).
Applicant graduated from high school in 2008 and earned a bachelor’s degree in
2013.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  had  been  pursuing  his  master’s  degree  since
late 2015.  He  has  worked as  an engineer for his current  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,
since 2013, when he was also first granted a security clearance. (Tr. at 5-6, 19-22, 41-
42, 58; GE 1; AE A, B).
Applicant testified that a number of his college friends remained in the vicinity of
their  college  after  graduation  but  he  moved  away.  As  he  traveled  for  work  one  to  two
weeks  monthly,  there  was  “no  social  aspect  of  drinking.”  In  approximately  October
2016, when he moved back to the area in which his college friends lived, he consumed
alcohol weekly to monthly at social events. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 1, 3; AE B).
Within  the  first  weekend  of  his  move,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
driving  while intoxicated (DWI), first offense.  He had consumed eight to ten  beers and
mixed  drinks  throughout  the  course  of  the  day  with  his  college  friends  while  watching
football.  He  acknowledged  that  his  decision  to  drive  was  “completely  irresponsible”
since he was drunk, but he thought “I’m right down the corner . . . I made the mistake of
thinking I could make it.” He testified that he got a flat tire and attempted to pull over to
the side of the road when he was pulled over by the police, questioned, and arrested.
He  denied  that  he  had  been  swerving  or  of  having  being  told  such  by  the  officer.  He
acknowledged  that  he  initially  denied  that  he  had  consumed  alcohol  that  evening
because  he  was  “scared,”  but  he  then  admitted  to  having  done  so  upon  further
questioning by the officer. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .26%. (Tr. at 22-59; GE
1-5, 7; AE A, B, E).
Applicant was convicted and sentenced to 180 days confinement with 165 days
suspended,  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  12  months  with  restricted  use
permitted,  he  was  fined  $500,  and  he  was  ordered  to  attend  and  complete  an  alcohol
and  substance  abuse  program  (ASAP).  In  December  2016,  during  pre-trial,  he
underwent  a  voluntary  substance  abuse  evaluation  as  recommended  by  his  DWI
attorney.  The  licensed  professional  counselor  (LPC)  noted  that  Applicant  expressed
genuine  concern  and  regret  regarding  his  DWI,  and  seemed  to  be  a  “responsible
individual  who  has  accomplished  his  educational  goals  and  maintains  an  established
career.”  She  concluded  that  he  did  not  meet  the  criteria  for  any  alcohol-related
diagnosis. She recommended that he remain abstinent from alcohol and complete a 24-
session  alcohol  treatment  plan  due  to  her  concern  that  he  attempted  to  drive  with  a
significant  BAC.  He  testified  that  he  remained  abstinent  throughout  the  duration  of
ASAP,  he  completed  ASAP  in  approximately  January  2018,  and  the  LPC  made  no
further recommendations upon his ASAP completion. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 1-5, 7; AE A, B,
D, E).
As a result of his DWI, Applicant had an ignition interlock device installed in his
car  in  approximately  April  2017.  Between  then  and  July  2017,  he  registered  a  total  of
three  violations.  He  testified  that  he  believed  two  of  the  three  violations  were  false
positives. He believed the device was triggered on these occasions by the banana and
protein  shake he  consumed for breakfast  during  his  1.5  hour commute  to  work, as  he
would test at a .00% BAC when he would blow into the device again five minutes  later.
(Tr. at 22-59; GE 2, 5-7; AE A, B).
The  night  before  his  third  violation,  Applicant  testified  that  he  consumed  one  to
two beers between 5:00 pm and 9:00 pm. He set the device off after he  ate a banana
and drank a protein shake during his commute to work that morning. He did not believe
that the two beers he consumed the previous night were sufficient to trigger the device.
He testified that he pulled over to the side of the road, blew into the device again, and
registered a .00% BAC. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 2, 5-7; AE A, B).
Applicant  was  charged  with  ASAP  non-compliance  as  a  result  of  his  three
violations.  He  pled  guilty.  His  suspended  confinement  for  his  DWI  conviction  was
reduced to 157 days, he was ordered to eight days confinement, which was reduced to
four for good behavior, 50 hours of community service, and his probation was extended
for one year. He was permitted to retain his restricted driver’s license.  He testified that
he would have worked remotely from home if he had reason to believe he would trigger
his ignition interlock device, and he did not intentionally trigger it and thereby violate his
probation. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 2, 5-7; AE A, B).
Applicant  completed  probation  in  early  2018.  These  were  his  only  alcohol  and
criminal-related offenses, and he has not since had  any further such incidents. In April
2019, he voluntarily underwent another substance abuse assessment. The assessment
coordinator  noted  that  he  did  not  meet  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  a  current  or  past
substance  use  disorder,  and  no  further  recommendations  for  treatment  services  were
necessary. (Tr. at 22-60; GE 2, 7; AE A, B, D).
Applicant testified that his family, friends, boss, and security office are aware of
his alcohol-related incidents. As of the date of the hearing, he testified that he had not
consumed  alcohol  for  several  months,  he  limits  himself  to  one  alcoholic  drink  during
special occasions, and he no longer consumes alcohol to socialize because “it has lost
a  majority  of  its  appeal.”  He  testified  that  he  moved  out  of  the  area  where  his  college
friends live, and he disassociated from those who have “the same drinking patterns as
they always have;” he has a long-time girlfriend who consumes alcohol responsibly; and
he realigned his social groups with individuals who share his same hobbies, to include
golf,  fishing,  and  outdoor  activities.  He  testified  that  he  learned  from  his  mistakes,  he
has no desire to find himself in the same situation again, and has no future intentions of
consuming alcohol and driving. (Tr. at 22-60; GE 2, 7; AE A, B, D).
Applicant’s  first  witness,  a  former  member  of  the  U.S.  military,  testified  that  he
has  known  Applicant  since  Applicant  came  to  work  for  his  group  in  2013.  He  testified
that he was aware of Applicant’s DWI and interlock violations. He testified that Applicant
was promoted in December 2018, becoming one of two senior engineers on a team of
10  to  12.  He  testified  that  Applicant  has  served  as  a  mentor  and  group  leader,
responsible  for  training  new  team  members.  He  described  Applicant  as  a  model
employee and his “go-to-guy” in the office and on temporary duty overseas. He testified
that  he  has  socialized  with  Applicant  after  work  and  he  described  Applicant  as  a
“professional” during these occasions. (Tr. at 20, 42-43, 60-78; AE A, C, E).
Applicant’s  second  witness,  a  security  engineer  for  a  DOD  contractor  and
Applicant’s high-school friend, testified that he, too, was aware of Applicant’s DWI and
interlock  violations.  He  described  Applicant  as  an  upstanding  person  and  believed
Applicant  has  since  matured.  Numerous  character  references  attested  to  Applicant’s
trustworthiness and reliability. (Tr. at 20, 42-43, 60-78; AE A, C, E).
",True
"In  Applicant’s  Answer,  he  admitted  both  allegations
the  SOR,  with
explanations.  The  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
in
Applicant is 51 years old. He married in 1989 and divorced in 1998. He has two
adult children and a stepchild from this marriage. He remarried in 2000 and divorced in
2013. He has a 16-year-old daughter from this marriage. He is seeking an information
technology  (IT)  position  with  the  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  worked  before  his
felony  conviction.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate  who  has  taken  some  college  courses.
(Tr. 4-5, 26, 29; GE 1, 6)
The SOR alleged Applicant was convicted of possession of child pornography, a
felony,  in  August  2012.  He  was  sentenced  to  5-10  years  of  confinement  (suspended)
and  placed  on  supervised  probation  for  10  years.  He  is  required  to  register  as  a  sex
offender  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  This  conduct,  including  electronically  searching,  downloading,
and viewing numerous still pictures and at least one video containing child pornography
between 2010 and April 2011, was cross-alleged as sexual behavior under Guideline D
in the SOR. (SOR ¶ 2.a). His admissions in his investigative interview, his Answer, and
at  his  hearing,  along  with  court  documents,  establish  the  allegations  by  substantial
evidence. (Tr. 26-27; GE 2-5)
In  March  2011,  the  state’s  Internet  Crimes  Against  Children  task  force  (ACAC)
executed  a  search  warrant  on  Applicant’s  home  based  upon  information  that  he
possessed  child  pornography.  Applicant’s  computers  and  hard  drives  were  seized.
Based  upon  the  evidence  derived  from  the  search,  Applicant  was  charged  with
possession  of  child  pornography.  In  December  2012,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  felony
possession  of  child  pornography.  His  sentence  included:  5-10  years  confinement
(suspended);  10  years  of  supervised  probation;  requirement  to  register  as  a  sex
offender; and completion of a sex offender class. His probation is scheduled to end in
2022. (GE 2, 6)
Applicant  admitted  to  a  defense  investigator  and  a  forensic  psychologist  (who
examined him at times from June 2011 to September 2011, before his guilty plea at the
request  of  Applicant’s  attorney)  that  he  has  had  an  addiction  to  pornography  (adult)
since he was a teenager. He acknowledged that he knowingly downloaded the specific
child pornography to which he pleaded guilty, but he claims that he just  “grabbed large
chucks  of  files”  on  the  Internet.  He  claimed  to  the  psychologist  that  his  only  sexual
interest  is  in  fully  adult  females.  He  also  admitted  to  the  psychologist  that  he  was
familiar with some child specific search terms. The psychologist noted that based upon
his evaluation, Applicant’s risk of using child pornography in the future is low, however,
he  further  indicated  that  Applicant’s  lack  of  a  good  marital  relationship  along  with  his
continued use of “regular” pornography creates the most high-risk circumstance for him
to reoffend. (GE 2, 6)
As stated above, Applicant is currently on probation and will remain so until 2022.
Under the terms of his probation, he is prohibited from possessing or viewing any sort of
pornography, from any type of media, including computers. A violation of his probation
could  subject  him  to  revocation  of  its  terms  and  imposition  of  his  original  sentence  to
confinement.  During  his  testimony,  when  asked  if  he  was  in  compliance  with  his
probation terms he responded, “I have kept the requirements of my probation.” This was
a false statement because he later admitted under questioning by Department Counsel
and myself that he has been viewing pornography as frequently as monthly, almost the
entire  time  he  has  been  on  probation—seven  years.  He  has  not  disclosed  his
pornography viewing to his probation officer. He claims he is receiving counseling from
his church for this problem,  but  presented no  documentation to  support  that  claim.  He
documented completing court-ordered counseling in December 2015, with a letter from
his  counselor.  It  acknowledged  that  he  attended  all  sessions  and  was  an  active
participant. (Tr. 30-35, 37-38; GE 5)
Applicant presented five reference letters from a colleague, his ex-wife, a friend,
his  current  supervisor,  and  his  former  facilities  security  officer  (FSO).  Applicant  is
described as accurate, professional, a good father, dedicated, loyal, knowledgeable with
computers, honest, having great integrity, a great asset to his employer, and trustworthy
in the work place. A friend and his former FSO recommend him for a security clearance.

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  two  of  the  factual  allegations
pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse of the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.);
and two of the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR ¶¶ 2.d. and 2.f.).
He  denied  the  remaining  allegations  as  well  as  the  principal  allegation  pertaining  to
personal  conduct  (SOR  ¶  3.b.).  Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  mechanic  with  his  current  employer  since  February  2014.  A  2000  high  school
graduate, Applicant attended a technical institute and received a heating, ventilation, and
air conditioning (HVAC) certification in 2001. He has never served with the U.S. military.
He  was  granted  an  interim  security  clearance  at  some  unspecified  point  between
September 2016 and February 2018.1 Applicant has never been married, but he has six
children, born in 2002, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2016.
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
(SOR  ¶  1.a.):  Applicant  was  a  substance  abuser  whose  primary  substance  of
choice was marijuana. He started using and purchasing marijuana in 1997, when he was
approximately  15  years  old.  He  started  smoking  marijuana  at  least  weekly,  and  that
1 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February 19, 2018), at 8.
frequency continued until approximately 2012 or 2013. Thereafter, until December 2017,
he  purportedly  reduced  his  marijuana  use  to  one  or  two  times  per  year.  During  his
interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in
February 19, 2018, Applicant admitted that his most recent use of marijuana occurred two
weeks before he was interviewed.2 However, he changed his story in his response to the
interrogatories when he stated that his last and most recent use of marijuana occurred in
December 2017.3 Regardless of the most recent date, Applicant’s last use was well after
he  submitted  his  2016  e-QIP.  Applicant  indicated  that  marijuana  made  him  calm  and
enabled him to relax. While he did not consider himself to be dependent upon marijuana,
as  of  his  OPM  interview,  he  was  unable  to  quit  altogether.  Applicant  never  grew
marijuana, and he generally purchased it “off the streets,” as he does not have a supplier.
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): In November 2015, while in a foreign country, Applicant was arrested
by the local police for suspected violations of the Cannabis Control Act and the nation’s
customs law. A female friend whom Applicant had met during a temporary assignment in
the  United  States  shipped  him  a  package  containing  marijuana  cookies.  Applicant
claimed that he was unaware that the package had been shipped to him, that he never
expected  it,  and  that  he  never  received  it.  The  package  was  intercepted  by  customs
authorities. On November 23, 2015, pursuant to a search warrant, the police searched
his  hotel  room  and  seized  a  glass  pipe  containing  traces  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was
arrested and taken to the local precinct where he was held for 21 days, after which the
local prosecutor declined to prosecute Applicant. He was released.4
Applicant  stated  that  he  decided  to  stop  using  marijuana  due  to  new  religious
beliefs; that he no longer associates with persons using illegal substances; and that he
no  longer  frequents  locations  where  drugs  are  being  used.  In  his  responses  to  the
interrogatories,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  had  never  participated  in  a  drug  or
alcohol  treatment  rehabilitation  program,  or  received  any  counseling.  Instead,  he
practices self-control and prays. However, in his response to the FORM, he stated that
he planned to attend his first Narcotics Anonymous meeting on April 1, 2019.5
In  addition  to  marijuana,  Applicant  also  had  a  relationship  with  cocaine,  not  by
using it, but rather by selling it as a sideline activity to raise extra cash. He contended that
he last did so about seven years before his 2018 OPM interview, which would make his
most recent sale as taking place in approximately 2011.
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): On or about July 2, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with
possession of a firearm while in possession of drugs, a felony; and manufacturing, sales,
and possession of a controlled substance, also a felony. The controlled substance was

approximately one gram of cocaine. The charges were dismissed in September 2003.6
Applicant contended that the charges were dismissed because the search of his vehicle
was “illegal.”7
Criminal Conduct
In  addition  to  the  criminal conduct  associated  with  Applicant’s  drug  involvement
and substance misuse, described above, Applicant has a history of arrests and charges
for a variety of activities:
(SOR ¶ 2.b.): On May 24, 2010, he was charged with contempt of court for failure
to appear, a misdemeanor. On December 9, 2011, he was found guilty of the charge, and
he was ordered to pay restitution;8
(SOR ¶ 2.c.): On November 24, 2010, he was charged with contempt of court. No
disposition was recorded;9
(SOR ¶ 2.d.): On October 28, 2011, after being in a bar fight protecting the mother
of  one  of  his  children  from  an  assault,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  malicious
wounding, a felony. He and the other individual involved remained in jail overnight. At the
subsequent court hearing in February 2012, no witnesses appeared, and the charge was
nolle prossed;10
(SOR  ¶  2.e.):  On  May  1,  2014,  he  was  charged  with  contempt  of  court.  In
September 2014, the charge was dismissed;11 and
(SOR ¶ 2.f.): On June 24, 2016, he was arrested and charged with assault and
battery on a family member, a misdemeanor, after he slapped his daughter in the face,
busting her lip. The child’s mother called the police. Applicant appeared in the juvenile
and domestic relations court in July 2017, and the court ordered a two-year deferment
(under  advisement)  with  eventual  and  dismissal,  providing  Applicant  completes  a
parenting class and an anger management course.12 Thus, he remains in this status until
July  2019.  As  of  February  19,  2018,  Applicant  claimed  that  he  had  completed  the

parenting  class  at  a  local  church,  one  evening  per  week  for  six  weeks,  but  he
acknowledged  that  he  had  not  yet  taken  the  anger  management  course,  and  such  a
course  was  not  yet  scheduled.13  As  of  the  closing  of  the  record,  Applicant  had  not
submitted any evidence that he had completed the anger management course, that the
charges had been dismissed, or that he remains “under advisement.”
Personal Conduct
(SOR ¶ 3.a.): This allegation cross-references the SOR allegations associated
with Applicant’s drug involvement and substance misuse, and criminal conduct.
(SOR ¶ 3.b.):  On September 9, 2016, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he
responded to certain questions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found
in  Section  23.  The  most  significant  question,  and  the  one  alleged  in  the  SOR,  was
essentially  as follows: In the  last  seven  (7) years have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance includes injecting, snorting,
inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming any drug or controlled
substance. Two other questions, while not alleged in the SOR,14 were also asked: In the
last  seven  (7)  years  have  you  been  involved  in  the  illegal  purchase,  manufacture,
cultivation,  trafficking,  production,  transfer,  shipping,  receiving,  handling  or  sale  of  any
drug  or  controlled  substance?;  and  Have  you  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been
involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other
than previously listed? Applicant answered “no” to the combined questions.15 He omitted
the  November  2015  violation  of  the foreign Cannabis Control Act and  customs  law for
which he was in jail for 21 days; his admitted use of marijuana that continued until after
the e-QIP was completed; his purchases of marijuana; and the fact that he held an interim
security clearance at some unspecified point between September 2016 (when he was still
using marijuana) and February 2018. He certified that his responses to those questions
were “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, because
of his omissions, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.
Other than simply denying that he had deliberately falsified material facts in his e-
QIP, Applicant has not offered any explanations for the omissions. He did not claim, for
13 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 6.
14 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No.

"Applicant is a 23-year-old construction worker who previously worked in the area
of security. He hopes to return to that field. Applicant earned a diploma from high school
and  attended  some  college.  He  is  single  and  the  father  of  a  toddler.  In  early  2014,
Applicant was away from home attending college. Although he had filed to change his
address  for  mail  purposes,  some  correspondence  got  misrouted.  Unreceived  mail
included  notices  regarding  his  computerized  highway  toll-pass  balances  which,  being
neglected because of Applicant’s inability to receive them, were mounting. Because of
the balances owed on the pass, Applicant’s state suspended his driver’s license.
During June 2014, Applicant was cited for possession of marijuana and operating
a  motor  vehicle  on  a  suspended  license.  The  next  day,  he  addressed  the  issue
regarding  the  toll-pass  balance  owed  and  the  suspended-license.  (Tr.  19)  The
marijuana  charge  was  later  dropped  and  one  of  his  passengers  was  charged  with
possession  of  the  marijuana  at  issue.  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  the  suspended  license
charge  in  November  2014,  and  was  sentenced  to  probation  before  judgment.  He
successfully completed a one-year period of unsupervised probation in November 2015.
In late April 2015, Applicant was playing basketball at a neighborhood park.  The
game  was  “intense,” and  “all of  a  sudden  shots  had broke  out, and  nobody  really  had
knew  what  happened.”  (Tr.  22)  Upon  hearing  gunshots,  Applicant  fled  and  got  a  ride
with  a  friend,  who  then000  called  the  police.  It  was  later  determined  that  two  of  the
players  Applicant  did  not  know  were  involved  in  an  altercation  giving  rise  to  the
gunshots which injured one individual. (Tr. 22) During the investigation, the names of all
participants were collected by investigators.
As part of the group at the scene, Applicant and others were ultimately indicted.
Applicant  was  indicted  with  two  felonies,  acting  as  an  accessory  after  the  fact  to  first-
and second-degree murder, and three misdemeanors: unlawfully wearing, carrying, and
transporting  a  firearm;  possession  of  a  regulated  firearm  by  a  person  under  21;  and
possession  of  a  dangerous  weapon  on  school  property.  A  film  of  the  incident
corroborated his version of what happened. (Tr. 27-28) Later, Applicant and some other
players reached a plea deal that put the matter on the inactive docket for a year, after
which the matter was poised to be dropped. (Tr. 28-29)  Applicant accepted this process
as  his  best  way  to  move  the  matter  along  and  not  jeopardize  his  job  or  his  pursuit  of
work in the security industry. His record was expunged in 2017.
In  early  2018,  Applicant  began  dating  his  former  girlfriend.  Their  relationship
lasted  a  few  months,  during  which  time  he  became  the  father  of  his  now-toddler  child
with another woman. During their period of intimacy, however, she saw some things on
his cell phone which caused her to “put on all lies just to get” him in trouble. (Tr. 31) In
April  2018,  she  reported  to  the  authorities  that  Applicant  had  entered  into  her  home,
assaulted her, and took her cell phone. (Tr. 31) She also reported that he has assaulted
her on other occasions. (Tr. 32) Applicant ended the relationship because of “her lying
and  everything  like  that,  and  me  having  this  kind  of  job,  and  wanting  to  do  better  for
myself I couldn’t associate myself with such a female like that.” (Tr. 31)
Applicant  was  ultimately  charged  in  May  2018  with  two  felonies,  robbery  and
third-degree  burglary,  and  two  misdemeanors,  second-degree  assault  and  theft  of
property  valued  between  $100  and  under  $1,500.  The  ex-girlfriend  later  recanted  her
tale.  After  the  hearing,  she  wrote  a  letter  denying  any  assault  had  ever  occurred  and
noted  that  she  was  not  in  fear  of  Applicant.  (Ex.  D)  Without  a  witness,  the  state
permitted the matter to be put on the inactive docket for a year, after which the matter
will be dropped. (Ex. 4.d; Tr. 36-37) The matter should be dropped by September 2019
assuming Applicant has no further criminal issues.
Today, Applicant lives a quiet life. He visits with his toddler son in another state
on  weekends.  He  has  changed  his  focus  from  old  friends  and  his  teenage
acquaintances to working extra hours and family time. He spends his free time in a local
gym  rather  than  at  a  neighborhood  park.  He  now  associates  with  a  more  responsible
crowd.  He  timely  pays  $425  a  month  in  child  support  for  his  toddler.  Other  than  the
issues  noted  above,  he  has  had  no  brushes  with  the  law.  Applicant  noted  that  these
incidents have provided life lessons and “now I make sure I change the whole way that I
move.”  (Tr.  40)  He  is  presently  seeking  to  find  a  career  path  in  which  to  learn  and
progress  professionally.  He  provided  two  positive  recommendation  letters.  (Exs.  A-B)
He is seeking a security clearance in order to work as a security guard or specialist.

and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old sheet metal worker employed by a defense contractor
since  November  2016.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  March  2003  to  September
2016.  While  on  active  duty,  he  received  nonjudicial  punishment  for  misuse  of  a
government credit card by buying dinner for family members. (FORM Item 2 at 46.) He
was  reduced  from  petty  officer  first  class  (E-6)  to  petty  officer  second  class  (E-5)  and
restricted  to  the  barracks  for  21  days.  (FORM  Item  3,  Personal  Subject  Interview  in
February 2018 (PSI) at 6.)
On April 30, 2013, Applicant’s wife sought treatment at a military medical facility
for  neck  pain.  She  told  a  member  of  the  medical  staff  that  Applicant  had  choked  her
during  an  argument.  She  declined  to  make  a  written  statement.  Applicant  was
interviewed  and  admitted  grabbing  her  by  the  neck  on  several  occasions  during
arguments in March and April 2013. He was required to obtain counseling and attend an
anger management course. No disciplinary or criminal action was taken.
In June 2016, Applicant was arrested for felony embezzlement. He was working
part time at a department store and he bought multiple items, including a television set
and  cellphone,  on  layaway.  He  entered  false  information  into  the  store’s  data  system
reflecting that he was making payments on the items. He also took cash totaling about
$800  from  a  cash  register.  When  he  was  interviewed  by  store  investigators  in  June
2016,  he  attributed  his  criminal  conduct  to  financial  problems  caused  by  his  reduced
income after he was demoted for misconduct. (FORM Item 5.)
In  April  2017,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  felony  embezzlement  from  the
department  store.  He  was  sentenced  to  121  days  in  jail  and  placed  on  probation  for
three years, until April 2020. He was ordered to pay restitution of $4,860. He was fired
from his part-time job and prohibited from entering the store’s premises. (FORM Item 6
at 3; FORM Item 7.) In the PSI and Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that the
offense was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor after he made restitution. There
are  no  court  documents  in  the  record  reflecting  a  reduction  of  the  offense  to  a

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
misdemeanor.  In  September  2016,  he  was  discharged  from  the  Navy  with  an  “other
than  honorable”  discharge.  He  was  unemployed  after  his  discharge  until  he  was  hired
for his current job. He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant has taken college courses since October 2016 but has not received a
degree. He married in December 2004, divorced in April 2007, and married his current
spouse in December 2011. He has a seven-year-old son and three stepchildren, ages
21, 17, and 11.
The  SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.o  alleges  13  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $33,000,  which
are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  March  2017  (FORM  Item  9)  and  November  2018
(FORM Item 10). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.k:  two  unsecured  loans  from  the  same  creditor  charged
off for $9,454 and $3,051. The November 2018 credit report reflects that both accounts
are current. (FORM Item 10 at 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: account past due for $3,418. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he
claimed  that  this  debt  was  paid,  but  he  submitted  no  documentation  to  support  his
claim.
SOR  ¶  1.g:  credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $452.  In  Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he submitted documentary evidence showing that he was making
payments on this debt.
Applicant  submitted  no  evidence  of  payments,  payment  agreements,  or  other
resolution  of  the  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  (unsecured  loan  placed  for
collection  of  $6,372);  ¶  1.e  (unsecured  loan  past  due  for  $3,556);  ¶  1.h  (medical  bill
placed  for  collection  of  $264);  ¶  1.i  (credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $423);  ¶  1.j
(dental bill placed for collection of $235); ¶ 1.l (unsecured loan charged off for $4,464); ¶
1.m (unsecured loan placed for collection of $1,257); ¶ 1.n (credit-card account placed
for collection of $468), and ¶ 1.o (credit-card account placed for collection of $479).
When Applicant submitted his SCA in November 2016, he did not disclose any of
the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  disclosed  his  misuse  of  the  government  credit  card
and  an  unalleged  delinquent  car  loan  for  $10,000  that  was  resolved  by  repossession.
He answered “no” to all the questions in Section 26, which included questions asking if,
in the past seven years, he had defaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts turned
over to a collection agency; had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or
cancelled  for  failing  to  pay  as  agreed;  or  had  been  over  120  days  delinquent  on  any
debt not previously entered. (FORM Item 2 at 47-49.) In the PSI, he did not disclose the
delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.o until the investigator confronted him with the
evidence.  (PSI  at  11.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  denied  intentionally  falsifying  his
SCA, claiming that he was confused by the questions.

"Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  works  as  a  geospatial  analyst  for  a  defense
contractor. He is married and has one daughter. He graduated from high school in 2007,
and obtained an associate’s degree as well as an undergraduate in 2016-2017. (GE 2)
He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2009 until 2014, receiving an honorable
discharge.  (GE  1)  He has  held  a  security  clearance  since  about  2010.  (GE  1)  He  has
been  employed  with  his  current  employer  for  about  two  years.  (Tr.  16)  Applicant
acknowledged that he was briefed regarding the use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 18)
Drug Involvement
Applicant  admitted  that  he  used marijuana  infrequently  over the  course of  2007
through 2014 while holding a security clearance. (SOR 1.a-b) He also admitted that he
used  marijuana  from  September  2012  to  January  2014  while  employed  in  a  sensitive
position on an active duty military base. (SOR 1.c) He was aware of the policy of zero
tolerance for drug use. (Tr. 18) Applicant testified that he used the marijuana infrequently
and when he was on leave from the military. He reports his last use was in 2014. (AE D)
He  described  the  circumstances  involving  the  use  of  marijuana.    When  he  visited  his
wife’s cousins in 2013, he was offered a lit joint and he did not turn it down. (Tr. 27) He
knows that he could have turned it down, but he did not. In 2014, he again used marijuana
with his wife’s cousin at a party.
Applicant does not associate with these family members anymore. He attended a
drug abuse session and obtained an evaluation report in June 2019, which reflected that
a clinical interview and an assessment tool combined with a urinalysis was conducted in
2019. The evaluator did a follow up in October 2019, and Applicant does not meet criteria
for substance abuse disorder. (AE I, J) He has never tested positive in a drug test. He
signed a letter of intent not to abuse any drug in the future on March 17, 2019. (AE E) He
discussed the illegal use with his wife and recently with his supervisor. (Tr. 33)
Criminal Conduct
As to SOR 2.a, the SOR cross-alleged the information as set forth in SOR 1.a-1.c.
He has not smoked marijuana or any illegal drug since 2014. He admits that his actions
were wrong and illegal. He has been evaluated for drug abuse. He does not associate
with the people with whom he used.
Personal Conduct
Applicant  admitted  in  response  to  his  SOR  that  he  never  disclosed  his  use  of
marijuana in any of his SCAs since 2011. This included when he was processing for a
higher clearance  with another agency  in 2015.  (GE  3)  The  agency  denied  his  security
clearance.  (GE 6, 7, and 8)He appealed the decision but was denied. (GE 3) Nor did he
voluntarily divulge the information during a 2017 investigative interview. (GE 2)
As to SOR 3.a, Applicant admitted that he falsified material facts during a personal
subject interview on June 8, 2017, with an authorized investigator with OPM. He denied
any drug use in response to all questions  under Section 23. He explained that he  was
scared and knew that he had incidents from 2012 and 2013, and knew it would hurt his
chances of seeking a higher clearance.
As to SOR 3.b, Applicant admitted that he falsified material facts on his August 17,
2016,  SCA  in  response  to  Section 23-  Illegal Use  of  Drugs  or Drug  Activity  in  the  last
seven years. He also answered “No” as to whether he intentionally engage in the misuse
of prescription drugs.
As to SOR 3.c, Applicant admitted that in his August 17, 2016 SCA in Section 22
–  Illegal  Drug  Use While  Holding  a  Security  Clearance,  he  did  not  disclose  any  of  his
marijuana use.
As to SOR 3.d, Applicant admitted that he intentionally falsified material facts on
his December 19, 2011, SCA by answering “No” to all questions relating to illegal drug
use in the past seven years.
Applicant reports that he is a mature man and not the young and stupid person he
was  before.  He  explained  that  he  would  never  jeopardize  the  United  States  regarding
classified information. He does not want to make any more mistakes. He emphasized that
the events happened when he was on leave from the military. (Tr. 20)
Applicant  submitted  five  letters  of  recommendation.  Each  letter  attests  to  his
honesty and trustworthiness. His wife, his sister-in-law, a college friend, and a colleague
praise  Applicant  for  his  professionalism,  work  ethic  and  good  judgment.  The  letters
describe Applicant as a good father, worker and a good man. (AE H)
Three witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant at the hearing. His wife described
him as very reliable and a good father. She explained that he does not use marijuana or
any drug. She stated that he has always been a rule follower. (Tr.48)
Applicant’s  sister-in-law  and  co-worker  testified  that  Applicant  is  very  quiet  and
reserved,  but  task  oriented.  She  believes  he  makes  good  choices  for  his  family.  She
recommends  him  for  a  security  clearance.  The  witness  did  not  know  of  the  issues  of
nondisclosure of his use of marijuana over the years on his SCAs. (Tr. 58-60)
Applicant’s  colleague  testified  that  Applicant  is  trustworthy  and  reliable.  When
Applicant is abroad working, he is very professional. He works well under stress. He was
not aware of the nondisclosures, but would still recommend him. (Tr. 64)
",False
"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h and 2.a – 2.b, with explanations. He denied
the  remaining  allegations.  The  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  42  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since
December  2015.  Before  his  current  position  he  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  retiring
after 20 years of honorable service. He holds a master’s degree. He is divorced and has
custody  of  his  two  children.  He  was  married  from  2009  to  2016.  All  the  allegations  of
domestic violence involved Applicant and his former spouse (FS). (Tr. 6, 7, 29-30, 32-
33, 84; AE1, 2)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  was  charged  with  domestic  violence  or harassment
in March 2001, September 2001, January 2004, May 2004, May 2013, November 2013,
and  April  2014  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.g;  2.c).  It  also  alleged  that  since  2010,  police  were
called to Applicant’s home based upon reports of domestic disturbances on at least 25
occasions  (SOR  ¶  1.h).  The  SOR  also  alleged  that  in  June  2014,  Applicant  was
demoted and received a letter of reprimand from his Air Force command as a result of
the November 2013 domestic disturbance incident (SOR ¶ 2.a). It also alleged Applicant
locked  FS  out  his  house  in  May  2018.  When  the  police  were  called,  they  informed
Applicant  that  she  was  considered  a  resident  and  must  be  allowed  access  to  the
property  (SOR  ¶  2.b).  The  SOR  also  alleged  Applicant  falsified  his  November  2016
security  clearance  application  (SCA)  by  failing  to  list  the  criminal  offenses  he  was
charged  with  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.h  (SOR  ¶  2.d).  His  use  of  alcohol  was  alleged  as  a
factor in the criminal and domestic abuse incidents listed in SOR  ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h (SOR ¶
3.a).
Applicant admitted that his volatile relationship with FS goes back to before they
were married. He further admitted that they both were at fault for letting their domestic
disagreements  foment  into  larger  issues  which  required  law  enforcement  involvement.
He admitted engaging in arguments and breaking FS’s cell phone, but he denied ever
physically hitting or striking her. (Tr. 43-44; 67-68) Records establish that Applicant was
criminally charged on the following occasions:
March 2001—charged with harassment—pleaded guilty—sentenced to
deferred  sentence—ordered  to  attend  domestic  violence  counseling.
(Tr. 37-39; GE 9-10);
September  2001—charged  with  harassment—dismissed—charged
with  violating
to
probation  for  24  months  and  required  to  attend  domestic  violence
counselling for 36 sessions. (Tr. 39-40; GE 11-12);
restraining  order—pleaded  guilty—sentenced
January  2004—charged  with  obstructing  telephone  service,  false
imprisonment, harassment—all charges dismissed. (Tr. 41; GE 13-14);
May  2004—charged  with  harassment—charge  dismissed.  (Tr.  41-42;
GE 15-16);
May  2013—charged  with  criminal  mischief  (breaking  FS’s  cell
phone)—pleaded  guilty—sentenced
to  supervised  probation  and
domestic violence counseling. (Tr. 43-45; GE 8, 17-18);
November  2013—charged  with  violation  of  protective  order;  child
abuse;  criminal  mischief;  resisting  arrest;  harassment—all  charges
dismissed. (Tr. 45-50; GE 19-20);
April  2014—charged  with  assault;  harassment;  and  violation  of
protective order—all charges dismissed. (Tr. 55, 57-59; GE 21-22).
the
local  police  department
Between January 2010 and May 2018, approximately 37 phone calls were made
to
from  Applicant’s  residence  claiming  domestic
disturbances between Applicant, FS (before and after their divorce), and his daughters.
These  incidents  are  reflected  in  approximately  100  pages  worth  of  transcripts.  A  May
2018 incident involved Applicant locking FS out of his house even though he gave her
permission to stay in the house. Police told Applicant he had to let her into the house or
pursue  eviction  proceedings.  Applicant  and  FS  divorced  in  January  2016.  He  allowed
FS  to  resume  living  in  his  house  in  September  2017  and  she  remains  residing  there.
(Tr. 33, 80-81, 84; GE 7)
Applicant admitted that alcohol was involved when he was arrested in November
2013. Applicant claims he was evaluated by the Air Force about any alcohol issues after
this  incident,  but  no  treatment  recommendation  was  made.  The  record  contains  no
documentation of any alcohol treatment evaluation or counseling for Applicant.  Several
of  the  domestic  disturbance  phone  calls  from  Applicant’s  residence  to  the  police
referenced Applicant using alcohol. Applicant denied that  his alcohol use led to any of
the reported incidents. (Tr. 65-67, 87; GE 7)
The demotion action against the Applicant by the Air Force in April-July 2014 was
a consequence of Applicant’s arrest in November 2013 (# 6 above), not an independent
incident. I find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR ¶ 2.a. (AE D, E)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  November  2016.
In  answering  Section  22-Police  Record,  Applicant  responded  in  the  affirmative  when
he  was  asked about  arrests  by  law  enforcement  within  the  past  seven  years. He  then
listed  arrests  in  November  2013  and  April  2014.  The  SOR  incorrectly  stated  that  he
answered  “no”  to  the  above  question.  Applicant  credibly  testified  that  any  omissions
while  completing  his  SCA  were  unintentional.  Department  Counsel  conceded  this
allegation  at  the  hearing.  I  find  in favor of Applicant  regarding  SOR  ¶  2.d.  (Tr. 35,  89;

"Applicant  is  37  years  old,  and  divorced  with  two  children.    He  attended  a
vocational  college  and  received  a  machinist  certification.    Applicant  is  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  as  a  tool  maker.    He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in
connection with his employment.
Guideline J – Criminal Conduct
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has  engaged  in  criminal  activity  that
creates doubt about a  person’s judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  and  calls  into
question a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Guideline E – Personal Conduct
The Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in conduct which shows a
lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  that
raise  questions  about  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  or
sensitive information.
At the young age of 13, Applicant started using illegal drugs recreationally like his
friends.    It  began  with  marijuana  and  alcohol.    As  time  passed,  his  drug  use  got
progressively  worse,  and  escalated  to  crack  cocaine  and  speed.    He  later  turned  to
methamphetamine and heroin.
Applicant grew up in downtown Los Angeles with the gangs and drugs and was a
by-product of the environment.  He states that he is also a by-product of rape.  He had
no father ever involved in his life.  His mother was simply trying to survive.  Each of his
siblings  have  different  fathers.    Between  December  1997  and  June  1999,  Applicant
committed various criminal offenses.  In December 1997, he was arrested and charged
with  robbery.    In  March  1998,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  grand  theft  auto.    In
May 1998, he was arrested again for grand theft auto.  In June 1999, he was arrested
and charged with vehicle theft.  At the age of 15 was the first time he went to Juvenile
Hall.    Applicant  spent  at  least  three  years  total  in  Juvenile  Hall  for  the  previously
mentioned offenses.
After getting out of juvenile hall, Applicant was homeless.  He ran away from the
youth authority program because he was raped by another inmate.  He admits to having
a  hard  time  adjusting  to  the  outside  world.    To  maintain  his  drug  habit,  Applicant
continued  to  commit  crimes.    In  February  2003  he  was  charged  with  burglary  and
disorderly conduct.  He was convicted and spent eight months in prison.  In December
2003 he was charged with burglary and vehicle theft.  He was convicted and spent 16
months  in  prison.    He  was  incarcerated  from  September  2004  to  October  2005.    In
October  2005,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  while  license  suspended.    He  was
convicted  and  sentenced  to  2  years  of  probation.      In  January  2006,  Applicant  was
charged  with  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  crack  cocaine.    He  was  convicted
and  sentenced  to  3  years  of  probation.    In  June  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with
possession of a controlled substance.  He was convicted and sentenced to three years
of  probation.    In  August  2006,  Applicant  was  charged  with  vandalism.    Applicant  was
convicted and sentenced to two years of probation.
In  August  2007  Applicant  was  charged  with  burglary  in  the  first  degree  and
attempted burglary of a house. He was convicted and sentenced to nine years and four
months  in prison.   Applicant  was  incarcerated from  August  2007 to  October 2016  and
remains on parole until October 2019.
Applicant did nine years and four months in prison.  The skills he has that he put
on his current job application, he acquired on his own while he was in prison.  He was
never  able  to  put  those  skills  to  use  until  now.    To  survive  the  nine  years  and  four
months in prison, Applicant, who had great artistic talent, became a very famous tattoo
artist.  His artwork was well respected and he could get anything he wanted at any time
while in prison.   Thus, illegal drugs were always available to him.  When he got out of
prison, he worked at Home Boy Industries and went to school for thermals and designs
and  was  sponsored  by  them.    Applicant  excelled.    He  then  started  applying  for  other
jobs and was hired and worked for another aerospace company for about four months
before he was contacted by his current employer and eventually hired.
While in prison, Applicant applied for a job with his current employer.  About eight
months  or  so  after  he  applied,  he  was  contacted.    By  this  time,  Applicant  had  been
released from prison.  Applicant was interviewed in April 2017 and at that time he told
them everything about his past criminal record, drug history, and time in prison.  When
Applicant applied for the job, he was not aware that he needed a security clearance.  He
initially  applied  for  a  tool  and  die  maker.    During  his  interview  with  the  defense
contractor, who obviously saw potential in the Applicant, he was told that at some point
he may need a security clearance.  The defense contractor also told the Applicant that
they  would  help  him  fill  out  the  security  clearance  application  if  he  needed  help.
Applicant  was  surprised  to  learn  that  he  got  the  job  and  would  be  starting  his
employment  in  August  2017.    His  employer  conducted  an  investigation  into  his
background,  and  so  when  he  began his employment  in August 2017 he  was  given  an
interim clearance.
After getting out of prison, in October 2016, Applicant continued to use marijuana
and  alcohol.    He  started  using  it  a  couple  times  a  week,  and  as  time  passed,  his  use
increased.    He  stated  that  he  last  used  marijuana  about  a  month  before  the  hearing.
(Tr. p. 44.)  Applicant also started using methamphetamine and heroin again.  In August
2018 Applicant desperately wanted help from his employer for his addiction.  Applicant
went  to  the  person  who  hired  him  and  showed  him  the  tracks  on  his  arm.    Applicant
admits that he has overdosed twice, once in prison, and once when he got out.  He also
admits  that  he  has  been  diagnosed  with  Meth-related  Psychosis  and  Post  Traumatic
Stress  Disorder.   With  the help of  his employer,  Applicant  entered  a full  time-recovery
program.  This was the first time in his life that Applicant felt that he has ever received
real help for his addiction.  This inpatient treatment program began on August 27, 2018,
and  Applicant  successfully  completed  all  levels  of  the  treatment  on  January  25,  2019.
(Applicant’s Exhibit A.)  Applicant provided psychiatric progress notes dated January 2,
2019,  and  January  23,  2019,  indicating  that  Applicant  was  prescribed  several
medications  as  well  as  daily  group  and  individual  psychotherapy  and  support  or
ancillary  service  in  order  for  the  psychiatric  care  to  have  maximum  benefit  for  his
recovery.  (Applicant’s Exhibits B and C.)  Applicant testified that he found the program
to be extremely helpful and life changing.  Robert Downey Jr. walked up to him at the
recovery center and told him that they share the same story.  Applicant was accepted
for who he was, was weaning himself from his addiction, and working hard to improve
his life.  (Tr. p. 51.)
From 1998 to December 2017, Applicant used a number of illegal drugs to either
escape his reality or because he was addicted and could not control the urge.  He also
purchased  illegal  drugs  during  this  period.    After  he  started  working  for  his  current
employer, and after being granted an interim security clearance in July 2017, Applicant
continued  to  use  illegal  drugs.    After  successfully  completing  the  treatment  program,
Applicant relapsed and used marijuana and alcohol.  After receiving the SOR from the
government  concerning  his  security  clearance,  Applicant  made  the  decision  to  stop
using alcohol and illegal drugs altogether.  Applicant currently attends NA/AA meetings
on a weekly basis and he has an AA sponsor.  He is currently working the twelve steps
of AA and is on Step 2.  Applicant admits that over the years he has tried to stop using
alcohol and drugs on his own, but was never able to conquer it by himself.  He now has
help and is doing much better than ever before.  Applicant states that his supervisor and
co-workers know all about his past criminal and illegal drug history.
On March 29, 2017, Applicant completed a security clearance application (EQIP).
Section 22- Police Record, asked the Applicant if any of the following have happened?
In  the  past  seven  years  has  the  Applicant  been  or  is  he  currently  on  probation  or
parole?  Applicant answered, “NO”.  This was a false answer.  He failed to disclose that
he was on parole, which started in October 2016 and ended in October 2019.
On the same application, under Section 22 – “Police Record, the Applicant was
asked a series of questions, Other than those offenses already listed, has the Applicant
ever had the following happen to  him?. . . Has he ever been convicted in any court of
the United States of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year for
that crime, and incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than 1 year? . . .
Has he ever been charged with any felony offense?. . . Has he ever been charged with
an offense involving alcohol or drugs?”  Applicant answered, “NO,” to these questions.
These were false answers.  Applicant failed to disclose the conviction set forth above.
On the same application, under Section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity,
the question asked, In the last seven years, has  the Applicant illegally used any drugs
or  controlled  substances?    Applicant  answered,  “NO.”    This  was  a  false  answer.
Applicant failed to list his history of illegal drug use including marijuana, crack cocaine,
methamphetamine and heroin.
On the same application, under Section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity,
the question asked, In the last seven years has the Applicant been involved in the illegal
purchase, manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving,
handling or sale of any drug or controlled substance?  The Applicant answered, “NO.”
This  was  a  false  answer.    He  failed  to  list  the  illegal  drugs  he  purchased  for  his  use
discussed above.
Applicant does not understand why he answered, “NO” to these questions and is
not  certain  if  he  actually  did.    In  any  case,  he  testified  that  he  was  afraid  that  if  he
disclosed  the  information  on  the  application,  he  would  not  get  his  security  clearance.
He also swore under oath that the information he provided  was true and honest to the
best of his ability.  (Tr. p. 66.)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d,
2.a, and 2.c. He denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.b. His admissions in his answer and
at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 24-year-old mechanic employed by a defense contractor. (Tr. 21.)
He  has  never  held  a  security  clearance.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  2012
and attended a university for three months. He does not know his biological father, and
he was raised by his grandparents. He left home after graduating from high school and
lived in an apartment with his brother and his brother’s girlfriend.  He was evicted from
the apartment because of noise coming from the apartment, apparently because of loud
arguments  between  his  brother  and  his  brother’s  girlfriend,  and  he  began  living  in  his
car.  He  now  rents  a  house  owned  by  his  grandfather.  (GX  4  at  2;  Tr.  28-29.)  He  has
never married, but he has a six-year-old son. (GX 1 at 21, 24.)
Applicant worked as a cook at a retirement facility from October 2012 to October
2015. He was fired because he was late for work twice and failed to have his badge with
him when he clocked in. He explained that he was late for work because he  was living
in his car, overslept, and had problems with an unreliable car. He failed to swipe in with
his identification card because he had lost it. (GX 4 at 3-4.)
Applicant was unemployed for two months and then worked as a cook at a golf
course from November 2015 to February 2017. He worked for a defense contractor as a
marine  painter  from  February  2017  to  September  2017,  when  he  was  laid  off  due  to
budget cuts. He worked for a defense contractor as a maintenance helper from January
to  June  2018.  (GX  4  at  3-4.)  His  supervisor  submitted  a  letter  of  recommendation  for
him, describing him as bright, personable, highly motivated, and a “valuable resource.”
(AX A.) Since September 2018, he has been employed by another defense contractor.
His  most  recent  supervisor  submitted  a  letter  of  recommendation  describing  him  as
having a great attitude and a sense of urgency. (AX C.).
In  September  2015,  Applicant  was  involved  in  an  altercation  with  his  then
cohabitant, when she tried to prevent him from moving out. She began hitting him as he
gathered up his possessions, and he grabbed her around the waist to prevent her from
hitting  him.  His  cohabitant’s  sister  called  the  police  and  accused  him  of  choking  his
cohabitant.  The  police  arrested  him  for  domestic  assault  and  battery.  His  cohabitant
denied that Applicant had choked her. Applicant and his then cohabitant agreed to have
no contact with each other, and the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 3; GX 4 at 2;
Tr. 25.)
When Applicant submitted his SCA in June 2017, he answered “No” to questions
asking whether, during the last seven years, he had been issued a summons, citation,
or  ticket  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal  proceeding;  had  been  arrested  by  any  law-
enforcement  official;  or  had  been  charged,  convicted,  or  sentenced  for  a  crime  in  any
court. He did not disclose that he was arrested and charged with domestic assault and
battery in September 2015. In May 2018, he told a security investigator that he did not
disclose  his  arrest  and  charge  of  domestic  assault  and  battery  because  he  did  not
understand the question. He fully disclosed the incident to the security investigator. (GX
4 at 3; Tr. 29.) In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he stated that he thought
he  was  required  to  disclose  only  arrests  that  resulted  in  convictions,  and  he  did  not
disclose  the  arrest  for  domestic  assault  and  battery  because  he  was  not  convicted.

Guideline  J,  the  court  records  reflect  that  the  seat-belt  violation  and  speeding  tickets
were civil infractions and not criminal offenses. As such, they should have been alleged
under Guideline E, and I have considered them under that guideline.
Applicant testified that he initially did not bother to obtain a driver’s license due to
immaturity and inexperience. He needed transportation to his job, and needed to work
because he had a newborn son. (Tr. 22.) He now holds an unrestricted driver’s license.
He attached documentation to his answer to the SOR, reflecting that all fines and court
costs had been paid.
Applicant’s grandfather, with whom he lived while growing up, submitted a letter
describing  Applicant’s  involvement  in  youth  activities.  Applicant  has  volunteered  to
serve as an equipment and uniform specialist and an assistant coach three to five days
a week. He has a reputation for being dependable, honest, loyal, and hardworking. (AX

"Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  male.  He  earned  a  master’s  degree  in  2010.  He  has
worked for the same employer for nearly eight years, most recently as a senior escalation
lead. Applicant married in 2012. When interviewed in July 2018, he noted that he intended
to  divorce  his  wife  after  the  birth  of  their  third  child,  which  they  were  then  expecting.
(FORM, Item 5 at 2-4).
In  May  2017,  Applicant  first  applied  for  a  public  trust  position  and  submitted  an
electronic  questionnaire  for  investigations  processing.  In  July  2018,  he  disclosed  to
investigators that he had been issued a summons to appear in court in January 2017 after
his  wife  accused  him  of  domestic  violence  assault.  His  wife  ultimately  recanted  her
complaint,  and  the  domestic  assault  charge  was  dropped  to  a  littering  violation  that
required him to pay a $400 fine.
In September 2017, Applicant and his wife engaged in a fight over the legitimacy
of their children. The then-pregnant wife alleged that Applicant threw a laundry basket at
her  during  their  exchange.  When  he  tried  to  leave  during  the  fight,  Applicant’s  wife’s
behavior turned sexual as she ripped open his shirt, forced her hands into his pants, and
caused him to fall into pictures on the wall. (Item 7 at 10) He struggled to extricate himself
from  the  increasingly  sexualized  situation  before  his  groin  was  inadvertently  struck.  In
trying to avoid contact with, or harm to, his pregnant wife and escape the encounter, he
hit his head on his way to his car. He then drove to the police station and filed a report.
He  was  given  an  escort  back  to  his  home  to  collect  his  clothing.  He  filed  for  a  legal
separation the following day. After two weeks, however, the two reconciled in an attempt
to save the marriage. The police never determined who was the primary aggressor in the
underlying incident.
In  May  2018,  the  police  arrived  at  Applicant’s  home  on  response  to  a  call
concerning a complaint of domestic assault involving a knife. This occurred after Applicant
and  his  wife  fought  as  she  attempted  to  pack  her  van  with  a  load  of  their  children’s
clothing,  threatening  to  leave  Applicant.  Applicant,  in  turn,  blocked  her  way  out  of  the
door. She pulled a knife on Applicant, which he tried to grab from her. Ultimately, she was
unarmed and fled the scene. Applicant contacted the police. The primary aggressor in the
matter was never determined by the police.
Applicant later noted that he had filed five or six police reports against his wife over
the years due to domestic violence incidents. He also disclosed that he had  separated
from his wife and planned to file for divorce. The records reflect that one town’s police
records contain at least three domestic violence complaints between the spouses that led
to police reports in the past two-and-a-half years: from January 17, 2017, September 8,
2017, and May 13, 2018. (FORM, Item 7) The records show that both spouses at varying
times were bruised or injured in relation to their conflicts, with the majority of photographic
evidence pertaining to Applicant. (see, e.g., FORM, Item 7 at 11, 13, and 20)
In  May  2017,  Applicant  completed  the  e-QIP  noted  above.  Applicant  answered
“no” in response to Section 22 – Police Record:
In the past seven (7) years have you been issued a summons, citation, or
ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against you? In the past
seven  (7)  years  have  you  been  arrested  by  any  police  officer,  sheriff,
marshal, or any other type of law enforcement official? I n the past seven
(7) years have you been charged, convicted, or sentenced of a crime in any
court? In the past seven (7) years have you been or are you currently on
probation or parole? Are you currently on trial or awaiting a trial on criminal
charges?
By answering this section in the negative, Applicant failed to disclose the January 2017
charge for domestic violence assault.
While Applicant admits the criminal allegations concerning his marital discord, he
denied deliberately falsifying or attempting to mislead in answering “no” to Section 22 in
2017. At the time, he had asked his attorney whether he had to disclose the 2017 incident
on his 2017 e-QIP. “He informed [Applicant] that his situation was lowered to a littering
charge which I paid. This was the extent of the conversation, and [Applicant] thought that
going  forward,  that  was  all  [he[  would  need  to  disclose.”  (SOR  Response)  Applicant
apologizes  for his inaction,  stresses  that  he had no  intention  to  deceive  or falsify,  and
firmly believed the matter was settled and the summons voided.

"After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 56-year-old senior designer, who has been employed by a defense
contractor since August 1990. He was granted a confidential-level security clearance in
July 1991, and he has held a secret-level clearance since September 1996. His clearance
was renewed most recently in August 2008. (GE 2; Tr. 44-45.)
Applicant has had several ex-wives and girlfriends. He and his fourth wife remarried
in August 2019. (Tr. 79.) Applicant has an adult daughter from his first marriage and two
adopted adult children from his second marriage. (GEs 2-3, 15-16, 19.)
Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in June 1981 (SOR ¶
2.a). He had consumed 12 beers while driving around. He was fined $50 and ordered to
attend a DWI school. In August 1982, he was charged with public intoxication after sharing
24 beers with a friend (SOR ¶ 2.b). He forfeited a $35 bond for being drunk in public. (GEs
6, 20- 21.)
In April 1988, Applicant and his first wife divorced after three years of marriage,
partially because of his drinking. On May 15, 1988, his ex-wife complained to the police
that he had assaulted her (pushed her, struck her across the face, knocked her to the
ground, and threatened to kill her). The police noticed scratches on her neck and other
signs that she had been assaulted. Two days later, Applicant was arrested and booked into
the county jail on a peace bond complaint of intent to murder his ex-wife (SOR ¶ 2.c). In
the jail, he exhibited signs of polysubstance abuse, and he admitted he had consumed 24
beers before his arrest (SOR ¶ 4.a). He posted a bond of $2,000 on May 23, 1988, and
was released from custody. On June 8, 1988, he pled guilty to assault by contact on his ex-
wife and was fined $200 plus costs. (GEs 6, 21.) Applicant testified at his hearing that his
ex-wife “broke into the house.” (Tr. 62.)
In September 1988, Applicant married his second wife, and one month later, he
enlisted in the U.S. military. On April 22, 1989, he was arrested for breach of peace and
third degree assault after he started a fight with another person at a local motel (SOR ¶
2.d). Applicant was intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol when he was arrested. (GE
7.) During a subject interview with a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) special agent in
May  1989,  Applicant  volunteered  that  he  had  consumed  eight  to  ten  mixed  drinks
containing vodka before the incident and that he was fined $35. He also reported an arrest
in May 1989 for malicious damage (SOR ¶ 2.e). After consuming a gallon of vodka at a
concert,  he  started  an  argument  and  dented  the  hood  of  the  victim’s  vehicle.  He  was
required to pay $200 in restitution and $43 in court fees. (GE 21.)
At  the  request  of  his  military  command,  Applicant  was  evaluated  at  his  base’s
counseling and assistance center on May 22, 1989. He acknowledged responsibility for two
pre-service alcohol-related incidents for which he had a pre-service waiver. He indicated
that he had been drinking regularly since age 16, and that his drinking had doubled while in
the military. He expressed a desire to abstain from alcohol, and reported drinking more
than intended, loss of control, increasing tolerance, and some withdrawal symptoms. The
screener opined that Applicant was “psychologically dependent” on alcohol and that he
was likely to continue to abuse alcohol unless he completed Level III inpatient treatment. It
was  recommended  that  he  attend  a  minimum  of  three  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings  per  week  and  be  placed  on  a  supervised  Antabuse  program  in  the  interim.
Applicant satisfactorily completed a 36-hour alcohol and drug education course on June
23,  1989.  On  June  29,  1989,  he  was  processed  for  disqualification  from  his  military
program because of his alcohol problem and was advised that failure to complete the Level
III drug and alcohol abuse program would be grounds for his separation from the military.
(GE 5.)
On his admission to the Level III program in July 1989, Applicant was diagnosed
with substance abuse disorder (SOR ¶ 4.b). He reported a significant increase in tolerance
since January 1989. He was admitted to a structured program of group therapy, individual
counseling, and education with a strong AA component. He was cautious at first but was
later able to identify factors impacting his alcohol use and to initiate actions to address his
problem. He was active in developing his aftercare plan, which included meeting with his
command’s drug and alcohol program advisor on a weekly basis for one year; participating
in a 12-step program; submitting to urinalysis screening at least four times per month for
one year; and attending a formal aftercare group two hours a week for 12 weeks. He was
returned to active duty in August 1989 with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. (GE 5.)
Applicant and his second wife divorced in early November 1989. (GEs 1-2.) On
November 9, 1989, Applicant was evaluated by a military clinical psychologist because of
suicidal ideation. He reported abstinence from alcohol since August 1989 with the help of
nightly AA meetings, but admitted that he had started thinking about suicide about two
months prior. He exhibited a depressed mood with a constricted affect. He was diagnosed
with alcohol dependence (alcoholism) in remission, and avoidant personality traits, but
found fit for full duty. He was advised to obtain an AA sponsor and to receive group and
individual  therapy  through  the  command’s  psychiatry  department.  In  December  1989,
Applicant  was  dis-enrolled  from  his  weekly  aftercare  group  for  failing  to  show  for  a
scheduled session for the second time. (GE 5.) Applicant was discharged from his military
service obligation in March 1990. (GE 1.)
Applicant was married to his third wife from June 1992 to October 1995. (GEs 1-2.)
There is no evidence that he had any legal or substance abuse problems during that time.
In December 1995, Applicant was arrested for threatening, breach of peace, bigotry, and
assault  on  a  police  officer  (SOR  ¶  2.f).  (GE  8.)  No  details  are  in  evidence  about  the
offense.
Applicant  and  his  fourth  wife  married  in  June  1997,  but  they  separated  around
October 2000 or 2001 and were divorced in approximately 2006. (GEs 1, 22.) In February
2005,  he  was  arrested  for  his  own  safety  following  an  incident  involving  a  girlfriend.
Applicant appeared to be suicidal. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital (SOR ¶ 1.b),
where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He indicated during a June 2006 interview
with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he spent four days in the
hospital (GE 22), although he reported to a clinical provider in 2012 that he was in the
hospitalized for two weeks in 2005. (GE 17.) Applicant was charged with possession of a
loaded handgun and domestic violence for the incident involving his girlfriend (SOR ¶ 2.g),
but the charges were nolle prossed in March 2005. (GEs 3, 22.)
While on a temporary work assignment for his current employer in approximately
July 2005, a co-worker told Applicant that he should try marijuana to relax.  Applicant took
one or two puffs from a marijuana cigarette offered him by the co-worker. From November
2005 to 2006, Applicant used marijuana with the son of his current spouse. Applicant liked
the effect, but did not use any marijuana for the next three years. (GE 22.)
To renew his security clearance, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National
Security Positions (SF 86) on December 5, 2005. He indicated that he had consulted with a
mental  health  professional  from  February  2005  to  June  2005,  and  that  he  had  been
arrested in February 2005 for possession of a loaded handgun and domestic violence for
which  he  had  to  complete  violence  education  classes.  He  responded  negatively  to  an
inquiry concerning whether he had illegally used any controlled substance in the last seven
years (SOR ¶ 5.b). (GE 1.) When he answered the SOR, Applicant denied falsifying his SF
86, stating that he had not used marijuana in the seven years preceding the application.
After it was pointed out to Applicant at his hearing that his reported use of marijuana in July
2005 predated his December 2005 SF 86, Applicant explained that he “was thinking it was
backwards,” i.e., that his drug use occurred after he completed his SF 86. (Tr. 70.)
From 2009 to the spring of 2015, Applicant used marijuana with acquaintances he
met  while  playing  disc  golf.  Between  the  spring  of  2015  and  February  2016,  he  used
marijuana  with  his  wife’s  son  on  four  occasions.  Applicant  was  usually  provided  the
marijuana that he used, but a few times he contributed money towards its cost. (GE 22.)
In January 2012, Applicant began taking several psychiatric medications prescribed
for him by his primary care physician. On October 19, 2012, Applicant sought treatment
from  a  behavioral  health  service,  complaining  of  anxiety  and  depression.  He  reported
sobriety from alcohol for the past 23 years. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and
referred for treatment at a psychiatric hospital. (GE 19; Tr. 50-51.)  Applicant was formally
discharged from the behavioral health service on January 3, 2013, for failure to attend any
sessions beyond the initial assessment. (GE 20.)
Applicant began treatment at the psychiatric hospital on November 12, 2012, four
days after the death of his sister (SOR ¶ 1.b). He reported a history of depression with
outbursts  of  anger  and  deterioration  of  his  condition  for  about  a  year.  He  denied  any
drinking  since  1989,  but  admitted  experiencing  suicidal  ideation  daily.  Applicant  was
treated for four days in the facility’s partial hospitalization program (PHP) and twelve days
in its intensive outpatient program (IOP). Random screens were negative for alcohol (he
reported attending AA) but positive for marijuana (SOR ¶ 3.b). After acknowledging that he
needed to stop seeing his friends who use marijuana, he reported a relapse of marijuana
use  on  December  19,  2012.  At  his  discharge  on  December  21,  2012,  Applicant  was
diagnosed on Axis I with bipolar I disorder – severe without psychotic feat – depressed;
PTSD;  cannabis  abuse  –  unspecified;  ADHD  not  otherwise  specified;  and  alcohol
dependence  in  sustained  full  remission.  He  was  diagnosed  on  Axis  II  with  antisocial
personality disorder. At discharge, Applicant was assessed at low risk for harm to self or
others.  Aftercare  plans  included  follow-up  with  the  behavioral  health  service  and
pharmacological management. (GE 17.) There is no evidence that he engaged in aftercare
treatment at that time other than medication management by his primary care doctor.
On  January  13,  2014,  Applicant  sought  treatment  in  a  hospital’s  emergency
department for depression and thoughts of suicide. He was discharged to follow up in the
hospital’s PHP, where he received treatment from January 16, 2014, to March 7, 2014, for
his diagnosed bipolar disorder I, PTSD, and attention deficit disorder (ADD). He reported
on admission to the PHP that he had been using marijuana for eight years, although not
within the past ten days. His attendance in the program was sporadic, but he reported no
use of marijuana while in the program. On his discharge, he was given a good prognosis
provided he followed up with recommended counseling. (GE 15.)
On March 20, 2014, he began psychotherapy three times a week with a licensed
clinical social worker (LCSW), who diagnosed him on Axis I with major depressive affective
disorder  –  recurrent  episode,  moderate  degree;  PTSD;  and  alcohol  dependence  in
remission. Applicant told the LCSW he was not using any marijuana and had abstained
from alcohol for the last 25 years. (GE 14.)
Applicant had developed a close relationship with a girlfriend’s grandson. After their
relationship ended, his ex-girlfriend threatened to prevent him from seeing her grandson.
Applicant  reacted  by  attempting  suicide,  overdosing on his prescription Xanax and his
insulin drug on April 1, 2014. (Tr. 52-53.) He was administered Narcan at the emergency
room of a local hospital, where he became very agitated, tried to hit emergency room staff
and hospital security, and threatened to kill one of the security officers. (GEs 3, 10, 13, 22.)
He tested positive for benzodiazepine, amphetamines, cannabis, and opiates, and was
admitted to the intensive care unit, where he continued to express threats toward his ex-
girlfriend. He was diagnosed with multiple drug overdose, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, and
transferred on April 3, 2014, to the hospital’s inpatient psychiatric unit on an involuntary
legal status (SOR ¶ 1.b). He had good behavioral control on the unit and explained that he
overdosed as a test of his ex-girlfriend’s love, i.e., would she obtain medical attention for
him.  On  April 7,  2014,  Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  hospital with  a  diagnosis of
bipolar disorder – recurrent, severe, mixed with psychosis, to follow up with his outpatient
counseling and medication management. (GE 13.)
While Applicant was in the hospital, his ex-girlfriend served him with a restraining
order. After his discharge, Applicant relapsed on alcohol and marijuana for a couple of
days because he was depressed. He started texting and leaving voice messages on his ex-
girlfriend’s cellular phone and drove by her house. On April 12, 2014, he was arrested for
violating the protective order. (GEs 9, 12, 14, 22.) On April 15, 2014, Applicant was treated
in a hospital emergency room after state police, in responding to a welfare check, found
Applicant in an agitated and belligerent state. He had called his supervisor and expressed
a  threat  of  suicide.  A  urine  screen  was  positive  for  cannabinoids.    Applicant  was
discharged  from  the  emergency  room  after  declining  treatment,  but  he  continued  his
outpatient counseling with the LCSW. (GEs 14-15, 22.)
On May 2, 2014, Applicant had an argument with his current spouse (then fourth ex-
wife) over Applicant’s ex-girlfriend taking “his grandson” from him. Applicant’s spouse told
the police Applicant had pulled her hair, but he had not assaulted her. A witness stated that
Applicant had pinned his spouse to the ground. Applicant was arrested and charged with
disorderly conduct (SOR ¶ 2.j). (GEs 11-12, 22.) On February 10, 2015, the disorderly
conduct  charge  was  nolle  prossed.  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  violating  a  condition  of  his
release  for  violating  the  protective  order  obtained  by  his  ex-girlfriend,  and  he  was
sentenced to one year in jail (execution suspended), and two years of probation. (GE 12.)
He was also required to attend 26 weeks of anger management classes, which he began in
June 2015. (GE 18.)
An  arrest  warrant  was  issued for Applicant for breach of peace because of his
combative and threatening behavior in the hospital emergency room on April 1, 2014 (SOR
¶ 2.h). Applicant turned himself in to the police when he learned of the warrant on May 8,
2014. He was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail, execution suspended, and
placed on probation for two years. (GEs 10-12.)
The incidents of April and May 2014 occurred despite counseling and medication
management.  (GEs  14, 22.) On July 3, 2014, Applicant entered a PHP where he was
treated for bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation. He expressed on admission that he had
some auditory hallucinations. His anti-depressant medication was adjusted with positive
effect, and he was “stepped down” to the hospital’s intensive outpatient program on July
21, 2014. He was discharged on August 6, 2014, to aftercare counseling with his therapist
three  times  per  week,  and  medication  management  by  his  physician.  Applicant  was
clinically stable, and his prognosis was assessed as good as he was able to recognize his
triggers and his unhealthy behaviors. (GE 15.)
Applicant resumed his psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW on August 8, 2014.
His mood remained stable for the most part, although he was tearful over the loss of his
relationship  with  his ex-girlfriend’s grandson.  As  of  November 26,  2014,  he  was  using
marijuana occasionally as a sleep aid against the clinical advice of his therapist. (GE 14.)
Applicant reported his recent psychiatric treatment and his psychotherapy with the
LCSW on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) completed on February
13,  2015.  He  also  indicated  that  he  was  on  probation  for  two  years  for  violating  the
conditions of his release and for breach of peace. He falsely responded “No” to whether he
had used any illegal drug in the last seven years. He admits that he lied on his SF 86. (GE
1; Tr. 70.)
As of March 2015, Applicant was attending psychotherapy sessions with the LCSW
once a week. He had demonstrated increased insight and ability to make decisions in his
best interest. Inconsistent compliance with his medications and distress over being denied
a  promotion  at  work  led  to  an  increase  in  his  depression  in  July  2015,  although  his
condition improved once he took his medications as prescribed. Applicant married his fifth
wife  in  September  2015,  but  she  left  him  in  October  2015.  Applicant’s  mental  health
deteriorated after the breakup, and he missed two weeks of work because of his mental
state. He presented for a session with his treating LCSW in a decompensated state in late
October 2015. At the LCSW’s recommendation, Applicant was taken by his son to a local
hospital. (GEs 14, 22.)
Applicant received treatment the hospital from October 26 – 27, 2015, for diagnosed
bipolar disorder – most recent episode depressed; cannabis use disorder – moderate; and
alcohol use disorder in full remission. He tested positive for amphetamines and cannabis,
and admitted that he had used cannabis on 15 out of the last 30 days. He was transferred
from the emergency room to a psychiatric unit, where he was discharged at his request, to
obtain treatment elsewhere. He was advised to avoid alcohol and illegal drugs. (GEs 16,
22.)
On November 4, 2015, Applicant was assessed for treatment by a behavioral health
service. He had experienced multiple losses over the previous two years, to include the
suicide of a nephew. Applicant reported no current suicidal ideation, and no alcohol use for
the past 25 years. He admitted that he had used marijuana on October 21, 2015, but none
otherwise in the last 30 days. Applicant was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder – current or
most recent episode depressed, severe; and with PTSD. On November 9, 2015, Applicant
was admitted to a PHP five days per week. He was reminded of the risks of using alcohol
or illegal drugs and the risk of combining alcohol or other substances with his prescription
medications.  He  was  an  active  participant  in  group  therapy,  and  reported  regular
attendance at AA with no drinking. He was discharged in January 2016, having completed
the PHP and an IOP, to follow up with his therapist. (GE 18.) The last available progress
note of his treatment with the LCSW is dated February 23, 2016, although that progress
note does not reflect that he was discharged. (GE 14.) Applicant recalls having sessions
with  the  LCSW  in  2017  and  in  2018.  (Tr.  55.)  Of  all  his  treatments,  he  considers  his
sessions with the LCSW to have been the most beneficial for him. (Tr. 66.)
Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) on February 22, 2016. He detailed his involvement with marijuana,
including  on  four  occasions  since  the  spring  of  2015.  He  admitted  knowing  that  using
marijuana was not allowed because of his security clearance. His recent drug involvement
had been with his current wife’s son, and he contributed funds to pay for the drug two or
three times. Applicant added that he would never use marijuana at work. He expressed an
intention to continue using marijuana on his personal time because it helps him to cope. He
claimed his co-workers, family, and friends know about his marijuana use and denied it
could be a source of blackmail. (GE 22.)
On September 11, 2016, Applicant was arrested for felony unlawful restraint in the
first degree following a domestic violence incident involving an ex-girlfriend. (GE 3.) His ex-
girlfriend, who wanted to get drunk with him, bought a bottle of whiskey. After getting “very
wasted” with her, he tried to choke her during an argument. (GE 4; Tr. 71-72.) The offense
was in violation of his probation for the April 2014 protective order violation. On November
1, 2017, he was sentenced  to three years in jail, execution suspended, and placed on
probation  for  three  years.  (GE  9.)  Applicant  was  also  required  to  attend  a  six-month
domestic  violence  program,  which  he  completed.  (Tr.  72-73.)  He  testified  that  his  ex-
girlfriend indicated that she would write a positive letter to the court to end his probation
early  in  2019.  (Tr.  73.)  He  presented  no  record  showing  that  his  probation  has  been
terminated.
At  the  request  of  the  DOD,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  licensed  clinical
psychologist on May 6, 2018. He reported to the psychologist that he had been attending
anger management classes twice per week since January 2018. He explained that he had
stopped his psychotherapy with the LCSW at the latter’s request. He claimed without any
corroboration that the LCSW told him he was on the cusp of recovery and his coping skills
were good, although he then admitted that he got bored with the therapy and had no plans
to resume it. He was taking medications prescribed by his primary care physician, and he
expressed an intention to continue taking them for his mental stability. Applicant described
current symptoms of low esteem, sadness, attention and concentration issues, and missing
his ex-girlfriend’s grandson. He reported a supportive relationship with his fourth ex-wife
(spouse  as  of  August  2019).  He  denied  any  episodes  of  mania  since  2014.  When
discussing his past treatments, Applicant generally indicated that they were beneficial.
Regarding substance abuse, he stated that he had been abstinent from alcohol from May
1989  to  September  2016,  when  he  relapsed  for  one  day.  He  stated  that  he  was  not
currently using any illegal drugs, and while he had used marijuana occasionally to help him
calm down from approximately 2005 through 2014, he only used it with friends at parties.
He acknowledged knowing that he was not supposed to use marijuana while holding a
security clearance. Applicant also admitted that he was currently on probation after he
choked an ex-girlfriend. (GE 4.)
During the evaluation, Applicant appeared guarded when discussing clinical issues;
demonstrated loss associations; and needed repeated, direct, and specific questions to
disclose information that did not portray him in a positive manner. He was not involved in
any psychotherapy. In the opinion of the psychologist, Applicant’s judgment and reliability
appeared  poor,  and  his  insight  appeared  fair.  He  diagnosed  Applicant  with  bipolar  I
disorder  –  unspecified,  ADHD  –  combined  presentation;  and  borderline  personality
disorder.  Applicant  did  not  report  any  current  PTSD  symptoms  or  substance  abuse,
although the psychologist opined that Applicant likely met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis
as  well.  He  found  it  concerning  that  Applicant  had  used  marijuana  while  holding  a
clearance and indicated that he would be very concerned if Applicant resumed drinking. He
assessed  Applicant’s  prognosis as guarded and opined that  the bipolar I disorder and
10
borderline personality disorder are conditions that negatively impact Applicant’s reliability,
judgment,  stability,  and  trustworthiness.  If  Applicant  became  noncompliant  with  his
medications,  it  would  have a significant negative impact on his reliability, stability, and
judgment. The psychologist considered Applicant’s disengagement from his psychotherapy
to be ill-advised. Applicant’s longtime employment since 1990, his dedication to his job,
and  the  fact  that  Applicant  felt  much  better  than  in  the  past,  were  favorable  issues
warranting consideration in the opinion of the psychologist. (GE 4.)
Applicant testified that he obtained a medical marijuana card in January 2017. (Tr.
64.) He denies any use of marijuana since his last use sometime during the spring of 2019.
(Tr.  67.)  He  explained  that  he  had  used  marijuana  in  the  past  when  he  “was  in  total
breakdown.” (Tr. 63-64, 67-68.) He admitted that he lied on his February 2015 SF 86 form
by denying that he used any illegal drug in the last seven years. (Tr. 70.) He knew that
marijuana use was not allowed while he held a DOD clearance. (Tr. 67.) Applicant does not
currently attend AA. He denies any current consumption of alcohol and any intention to
drink in the future. (Tr. 73.) He realizes that drinking any alcohol will not help him because
he loses control when he drinks. (Tr. 74.)
Applicant is grateful to the DOD for granting him the privilege of having a clearance,
which has allowed him to continue his work over the years. He does not believe that he has
worked on any classified projects. Some of his co-workers do not have security clearances.
Applicant believes he has done his job well. He is passionate about his work and has had
no trouble focusing on his work. (Tr. 46-49.) He continues to struggle on a daily basis with
controlling  his  emotions.  (Tr.  54.)  He  is  currently  prescribed  Lamictal  (for  his  bipolar
disorder),  Adderall,  and  a  new  anti-depressant.  He  does  not  always  take  the  Adderall
because it impairs his ability to sleep, and he does not think the Lamictal is helping him.
(Tr. 56-57.) He sought counseling for anxiety and depression through his EAP in late spring
2019, and he was referred to a local psychiatric hospital where they wanted to admit him to
an inpatient substance abuse treatment program. He was using marijuana at that time,
although he denies he was drinking alcohol. He did not pursue treatment because he did
not want to take more time away from his work. (Tr. 58-59.) Applicant testified that he is
“holding  it  together,”  and  learning  to  not  allow  his  emotions  to  get  the  better  of  his
judgment. (Tr. 59-60.)
Applicant’s current spouse has known Applicant for over 25 years. She testified that
he has stopped drinking; that they have no alcohol in their house; and that they do not go
to bars or to alcohol stores. She has not seen him with any alcohol since September 2016.
(Tr. 76-78.) She is aware that he obtained a medical marijuana card in 2017 and that he
last used marijuana in the spring of 2019 when “he was having an episode.” (Tr. 81-82.) To
her knowledge, Applicant “only uses it when he has an issue.” She does not know how
Applicant obtained the marijuana that he used earlier this year. (Tr. 82.) In all the years that
she has known him, Applicant has not talked about his work with her. (Tr. 83-84.)
Applicant’s  supervisor  from  2004  to  August  2015  attests  that  Applicant
demonstrated a high level of proficiency working on very complex products. This former
supervisor never witnessed Applicant intoxicated or impaired at their workplace. Applicant
11
always put full effort into his duties and cared about his work. The supervisor knows of “no
professional reason” why Applicant should lose his security clearance. (AE A.)
A co-worker of Applicant’s for the last 15 years, who has become a close friend,
indicated that he understands the concerns, but he trusts Applicant with his life. In his
experience,  Applicant  has  been  committed  to  providing  a  quality  product  for  the  U.S.
military. As a friend, Applicant has been reliable, consistent, and trustworthy. (AE B.)
Applicant’s supervisor since 2014 has known Applicant since 2001. They graduated
from  apprenticeship  school  together  and  worked  on  the  same  crew  on  and  off.  This
supervisor indicated that he has not witnessed or suspected Applicant of coming to work
under the influence of any substance. He vouched for Applicant’s integrity as a trusted
employee and patriot. Applicant continues to be a “valuable and necessary asset to [his]
crew.” (AE C.)

"In Applicant’s Answer, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d and denied ¶ 1.e. As to the
cross  allegations  in  ¶¶  2.a and  3.a,  he  admitted and denied  consistent  with  his earlier
admissions  and  denials.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  ¶¶  3.a-3.b.  The  admissions  are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  60  years  old.  He  has  been  married  for  38  years.  He  and  his  wife
have  two  adult  children  born from their marriage  and  they  adopted  three  girls from  an
African  nation  in  approximately  2009  (A1,  A2,  A3).  The  adopted  daughters  no  longer
reside with Applicant and his wife. He currently works for a defense contractor for whom
he has worked for 15 years. He has two master’s degrees. In 2001, he retired from the
Air Force after 21 years of honorable service as a lieutenant colonel (O-5). He has held
a security clearance for over 40 years. (Tr. 17-19; GE 1; AE A-B)
Under  Guideline  D,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  is  currently  registered  as  a  sex
offender  in  his  state  of  residence  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  that  he  is  on  intensive  supervised
probation  from  10  years  to  life  after  pleading  guilty  to  criminal  attempt  to  commit
aggravated  incest  (this  is  not  the  language  from  the  SOR,  which  the  facts  at  hearing
revealed  to  be  incorrect,  but  is  the  correct  charge  to  which  Applicant  pleaded  guilty)
(SOR ¶ 1.b); that he was arrested in September 2015 and charged with three counts of
sexual assault of a child under 15 years while being in a position of trust and one count
of aggravated incest (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d); that he engaged in incest and aggravated sexual
assault  of  his  minor  child  from  about  April  2014  to  about  July  2015  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  All
these allegations were also cross-alleged under Guidelines J and E (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 3.a).
Additionally,  under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  failed  to  notify  his  security
office of the stated arrest and subsequent conviction and sentencing in May 2016 until
December 2016 (SOR ¶¶ 3.b-3.c). (Tr. 32, 34; GE 3-5)
In August 2015, A3, who was 13 years old at the time, disclosed to a caseworker
that Applicant, her father, had touched her breasts and made inappropriate comments.
A  few  days  later,  A3  participated  in  a  forensic  interview.  A3  disclosed  that  before  the
touching, her father was her “best friend” and that she trusted him. She then stated, “but
I  don’t  trust  him  anymore.”  She  described  Applicant  coming  into  her  room  when  her
mother  was  gone  and  asking  her  if  he  could  touch  her  “boobs.” She  told  him  no.  The
next day he came in and began touching her without asking. She did not tell him to stop
because she was scared. She was scared because of his military background and she
believed  he  was  strong  and  could  do  anything  he  wanted.  She  felt  like  she  had  no
choice  other than  let him  touch her. Applicant  touched  her breasts  under her clothing.
A3 told the interviewer that Applicant’s touching began when she was 12 years old and
happened more than once. She described another time Applicant touched her when he
came into her room with just his underwear on and touched her breasts. Another time
Applicant came into her room after her alarm had gone off and laid down in her bed and
“cuddled” her, pulled up her shirt, and touched her breasts. A3 also described, through
her  words  and  drawing,  an  occasion  when  Applicant  pulled  down  her  underwear  and
touched her groin area. She stated that this type of touching happened more than once.
A3  told  her  mother  about  the  touching.  Applicant  told  A3  not  to  tell  anyone  about  the
touching because it would get him in “big trouble.” (GE 3)
In  September  2015,  after  A3’s  disclosures,  Applicant  was  charged  with  four
counts  of  sexual  assault  of  a  child  and  one  count  of  aggravated  incest.  A  plea
agreement  was  reached  and  in  May  2016,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  one  count  of
attempted  aggravated  incest  and  all  the  original  charges  were  dropped.  His  sentence
included  10  years  to  life  on  sex  offender  intensive  supervised  probation  (SOISP);
SOISP weekly counseling; placement on a sex offender’s registry (registration a yearly
requirement);  no  contact  with  minor  children;  restrictions  on  travel;  and  other  related
requirements. He was not sentenced to any jail time. He remains on SOISP. (Tr. 22-27;
AE 3-5)
investigation,  he  was
During  Applicant’s  background
interviewed  by  an
investigator  in  September  2018  about  the  above-described  criminal  actions.  Applicant
claimed that his criminal assaults took place on only two occasions two weeks apart in
April  2015.  He  admitted  touching  A3’s  breasts  under  her  clothes.  He  was  aroused  by
her.  There  was  no  one  else  present  at  the  time.  The  following  weekend  the  second
assault occurred. He once again touched her breasts as he had before, then he placed
his  hand  under  her  pajamas  touching  her  pubic  hair  near  her  vagina.  He  claims  he
stopped at that point realizing what he was doing was wrong and criminal. In his hearing
testimony,  Applicant  maintained  that  he  only  assaulted  A3  two  times  by  touching  her
breasts. He denied going into her room wearing only his underwear and, contrary to his
statement to the investigator, he denied touching her groin area. (Tr. 56-61; GE 2)
Applicant  related  that  A3  was  seven  years old  when  she  was  adopted  and  that
she  suffered  from  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  and  reactive  detachment
disorder  (RDD)  because  of  things  she  experienced  as  a  young  child  in  her  home
country.  He  also  discovered  that  she  had  been  raped  in  her  former  country.  He  was
aware of all these factors at the time he assaulted her. He acknowledged that he was in
a position of trust relative to A3. (Tr. 51-55; GE 2)
Applicant’s  supervisor  indicated  that  Applicant  kept  the  appropriate  people
notified within the company regarding his being charged, arrested,  entering into a plea
agreement, pleading guilty, and being sentenced. A Joint Personal Adjudication System
(JPAS)  document  shows  a  single  entry  from  December  2016  indicating  his  plea.
Applicant  testified  that  he  kept  his chain  of command  informed  of  all  events  related  to
his criminal charge. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to provide a statement
from his security officer on this issue. No further evidence was received. (Tr. 46-47; AE
A)
Applicant provided a letter from his probation officer (PO) who stated that he has
complied  with  all  his  probation  terms  to  date.  Several  of  his  probation  requirements
have been loosened, such as, allowing Applicant to travel out of state and allowing him
supervised visits with his grandchild. The PO indicated that Applicant meets the criteria
to  “be  progressed  off  intensive  supervision.”  He  also  maintained  a  low  risk  score  for
reoffending on all assessments completed by the PO. (Tr. 29-30, 49-50; AE O)
Applicant provided a letter from his therapist (T) who provided treatment to him in
accordance with his sexual offense conviction. T stated that he has treated Applicant for
the past three years. T further stated that Applicant was fully accountable for his offense
and  has  remained  accountable  to  his  probation  rules  and  therapy  requirements.  He
constructed  a  relapse  prevention  plan  while  in  therapy.  He  completed  his  sex  offense
specific  treatment.  In  terms  of  risk  measurement  regarding  reoffending,  Applicant  is
below the average adult male sex offender who has completed treatment. (Tr. 49; AE N)
Applicant  presented  13  reference  letters  from  coworkers,  friends,  his  biological
daughter, his son-in-law, and other acquaintances. All the letters describe Applicant in
the most positive light, emphasizing his integrity, honesty, family orientation, and church
and  community  service.  None  of  the  letters indicate  whether the  authors were  familiar
with  the  facts  surrounding  this  conviction.  Applicant  provided  evidence  concerning  his
military awards and decorations, two years of work appraisals for years 2016-2018, his
academic achievements, as well as other biographical information. (AE A-M)

"Unless  otherwise  indicated  by  citation  to  another  part  of  the  record ,  I  have
extracted the below find ings of fact from Applicant's SOR answer (Item 3) and SCA (Item
4).
Applicant, age 18, is unmarried without chi ldren.  He graduated high school in June
2018.  He attended  college  part time  between  July 2017  and  September 2018, and  has
been  attending  full  time  since  September  2018.  He  has  been  employed  by  a  federal
contractor as  a cyber-security  trainee  since July 2018.  This  is  his first application  for a
security clearance.
The  SOR  alleged  the  following  under Guideline  J:  ""You  consume  alcohol  other
than that provided  by a parent, and other than that at a parent's residence, in violation  of
[state  law].""  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation .  Because  the
Government  did  not  specify  a  citation  or  provide  documents  referencing  the  state  law
alleged,  I  sua  sponte  confirmed  that,  while  there  is  a  criminal  code  section  under
applicable state law prohibiting  underage consumption  of alcohol as alleged  in  the  SOR,
violation  of that section  is a civil  offense, not a crime.  (§ 10-114 and§ 10-119).
The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  H,  that  Applicant  ""used  and  purchased
marijuana  with  varying  frequency,  from  about  2014  to  about  June  2018.""  Applicant
admitted the allegation, with the following comment:
These  uses are  past  occurrences and  will  not  happen  again.  Some  even
date  back to freshman  year of  high  school, when  one  can  be  very easily
influenced. I believe that I have changed and matured since, and these past
uses would  not affect my current ability to be trusted.

During his October 2018 interview with a DOD authorized investigator concerning
his SCA, Applicant expounded on the facts and circumstances underlying his illegal drug
use and activity. He reiterated his intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. He has
never had any drug treatment or counseling. (Item 5).
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  once  every  ten  days  after  his  first  usage  in  2014.
From 2014 through 2016, he smoked it once every week. He smoked it at either his home
or a  friend’s home.  He  purchased approximately two  to  three  grams  of  marijuana at a
time. After his father smelled marijuana emanating from Applicant’s room, he abstained
from  using  marijuana  during  a  five  month  period  not  specified  in  the  record.  He  then
resumed weekly usage until the week before he started his current position with a federal
contractor. I will consider the illegal drug use and activity not alleged in the SOR only for
the purpose of evaluating mitigation and the whole person. (Item 5).

"Applicant is 33 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2018, and in 2019, he
enrolled into a graduate program for a masters of business administration (MBA) degree.
He expects to graduate with his MBA in 2021. He married in 2011. He has two daughters,
ages seven and fifteen. He also has three stepchildren, ages ten, twelve, and fourteen.
He has been employed by a DOD contractor since January 2018 as a quality engineer.
In 2018, Applicant was issued an interim DOD security clearance, however, that security
clearance was removed in approximately September 2019. (Tr. 16, 20-22; GE 1, AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in 2004 and charged with criminal
damage, theft, and tapering with coin machines. He admitted this arrest and stated that
he  was  18  years  old.  He  had  a  young  daughter  at  the  time  and  needed  to  provide
additional financial support. He cut the locks off of vending machines and took the money.
The vending machines were located at his place of employment, a grocery store, and he
was observed on a video camera stealing the money. Applicant was terminated by his
employer. The court sentenced him to 180 days in jail, with all but three days suspended,
and he was ordered to pay full restitution to his former employer. (Tr. 23-25; GE 1)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant was charged in May 2015 with Theft. He was at
a national discount department store and stole several items, to include a Fitbit tracker
and a box of cards. He was 29 years old and married at the time. He stated that the theft
of the items was an unplanned impulse while he was shopping, and the Fitbit was going
to be a gift for his wife. Applicant was caught on video surveillance stealing the items. He
pleaded  guilty,  the  court  and  ordered  him  to  pay  restitution,  and  he  was  sentenced  to
serve time in the county jail, with all jail time suspended. (Tr. 25-28; GE 1)
SOR ¶ 2.a cross referenced the allegations set forth under paragraph 1.
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant resigned his employment by mutual agreement
in June 2015 with a restaurant chain after his involvement of theft. As a manager of the
restaurant,  he  had  the  ability  to  void  sales  and  pocket  the  money.  The  stolen  money
totaled nearly $2,000, and was taken over an 18-month period between 2014 and 2015.
Applicant stated the money was used to buy the restaurant work crew drinks at another
bar after they closed the restaurant. (Tr. 28-30)
Applicant stated that since June 2015, he has never had the impulse to steal again.
He  has  taken  steps  to  better  himself,  such  as  obtaining  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  May
2018, and eliminating people in his life that are not a good influence. His job and family
are very important to him. He started his graduate program in September 2019, with a
focus on executive management, and his employer is providing some assistance with his
tuition  expense.  His  wife  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  psychology,  and  he  has  been
using her as a source to set goals in his life. Applicant had an undesirable upbringing,
and  his  wife  has  helped  him  deal  with  issues  stemming  from  his  childhood.  Applicant
admitted he has made mistakes in the past for which he is embarrassed and remorseful.
He  is  continuously  working  to  rectify  those  mistakes  and  to  ensure  they  will  never  be
repeated. (Tr. 31-36, 38)
Applicant  provided  two  character  reference  letters  and  two  of  his  most  recent
employee performance appraisals at the hearing. Applicant’s current manager reported
that Applicant was initially hired for an internship, and after observing his dedication and
exceptional  business  knowledge  on  the  job,  Applicant  was  offered  permanent
employment. For over a year under his supervision, Applicant consistently demonstrated
excellent  engineering  and  leadership  skills,  and  is  considered  an  asset  by  the  DOD
contractor.  Applicant’s  two  employee  appraisals  also  support  the  highlighted  qualities
enumerated by his manger. (AE B, AE C, AE G, AE H)

Criminal Conduct and Sexual Behavior
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 3.a allege Applicant was arrested in March 2010 and charged with
Rape of a Spouse and Willful Infliction of Corporal Injury. The NCIS ROI indicates that
civilian law enforcement cited these offenses; however, it also indicates the accuser (A)
was “girlfriend” and not his spouse. (GE 5) Applicant indicated A was not his spouse.
In  July  2010,  A  called  the  civilian  police  and  said  that  in  March  2010,  on  two
occasions Applicant sexually assaulted her, and on the second occasion, he threatened
to kill her. (GE 5) The police briefed the district attorney  about A’s allegations, and the
district attorney declined to prosecute “due to lack of evidence.” (GE 5) The civilian police
informed  the  NCIS  of  the  allegation,  and  its  disposition,  and  the  NCIS  generated  a
summary  ROI.  The  NCIS  ROI  does  not  indicate  Applicant  was  ever  arrested,  formally
interviewed, or charged. Applicant was assigned to a Marine Corps Base outside of the
state  where  the  offense  allegedly  occurred.  The  NCIS  ROI  indicates  Applicant’s
command declined to take legal or administrative action against Applicant, and the ROI
“is not to be attached to or used as an exhibit in an adverse employment or administrative
proceeding.” (GE 5)
Applicant learned the police were investigating A’s allegation when a police officer
called  him  on  the  phone,  and  he  orally  explained  his  relationship  with  A  to  the  police
officer.  (Tr.  41,  44)  Applicant  provided  to  the  police  names  of  witnesses  who  could
describe his relationship with A. (Tr. 41, 44) He was never advised of his constitutional
rights, and he was never asked to render a written statement. (Tr. 76) Several months
later  an  investigator  called  Applicant  and  told  him  no  adverse  action  would  be  taken
against him. (Tr. 41) He was never questioned by his command or the NCIS about the
incidents  involving  A.  (Tr.  45)  The  Government  did  not  produce  any  evidence  that
Applicant was charged for the conduct in 2010, and Applicant said he was unaware of
any charges filed against him. (Tr. 48; GE 5)
Applicant denied that he sexually assaulted A. (Tr. 37-47; HE 3) He engaged in
sexual activity with her on multiple occasions, and he always stopped sexual activity when
she asked him to do so. (HE 3) He described her as crazy, unstable, suicidal (attempted
suicide by cutting her wrists), and argumentative about the circumstances of daily living.
(Tr. 37-40) She threatened to call the police and make a false allegation against him. (Tr.
39) She destroyed his property and physically attacked him several times. (Tr. 39-40, 58)
After Applicant left A, she called him on the telephone and asked him how he would feel
if she accused him of rape, and he said he would be unhappy. (Tr. 45-46) She laughed
and hung up the phone. (Tr. 46)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege Applicant was arrested in February 2015 and December
2017 and charged with Domestic Assault. The second alleged offense occurred in July
2016, and the charge was dismissed in December 2017. (GE 4) Applicant resided with
his cohabitant (C), the alleged victim of the Domestic Assault, from 2013 to July 2019,
except for a period of separation after the alleged assault in February 2015. (Tr. 28, 34)
Applicant and C currently reside on opposite sides of the country. (Tr. 35)
In February 2015, Applicant and C were arguing in their residence. (Tr. 52) It was
Valentine’s Day, and C was complaining about Applicant insisting on studying for a test.
(Tr.  52-53)  He  ignored  C,  and  she  became  upset  and  started  hitting  him.  (Tr.  52-53)
Applicant wanted to leave the residence and stay with a friend, and C was holding him to
keep him from leaving. (Tr. 54) Applicant and C were pushing each other, and Applicant
left the residence. (Tr. 55; GE 3) C’s  mother called the police.  (Tr. 55) Later Applicant
returned to his residence and went to bed. (Tr. 55) The police talked to Applicant about
the incident the next day, and the police left without arresting Applicant. (Tr. 55) The police
advised his cohabitant to get an order of protection, and she obtained one. (Tr. 56-57)
After  the  incident,  and  living  apart  for  several  months,  Applicant  and  C  resumed  their
cohabitant relationship. (Tr. 60-61) C was the victim of domestic violence from a previous
relationship  with  someone  other  than  Applicant.  (Tr.  58)  In  March  2016,  Applicant
appeared  in  court.  (Tr.  55;  GE  4)  The  charge  was  dismissed  without  Applicant  being
arraigned or entering a plea. (Tr. 60, 63-64)
In July 2016, C’s son was taking a bath, and he started yelling and crying because
he had soap in his eyes. (Tr. 67; GE 4) C was in the bathroom helping her son. Applicant
stuck  his  head  in  the  bathroom,  and  C  pushed  the  bathroom  door,  which  struck
Applicant’s head and caused a cut. (Tr. 68) Applicant’s head bled profusely, and Applicant
called 911 because he wanted an ambulance to take him to the hospital. (Tr. 68) Applicant
was  worried  about  his  previous  service-connected  traumatic  brain  injury.  (Tr.  68)
Applicant decided to drive himself to the hospital for treatment. (Tr. 68) While he was at
the hospital, the police came to his house. Applicant believed that C was worried about
losing custody for assaulting Applicant, and she accused Applicant of assaulting her. (Tr.
69) She subsequently admitted to Applicant that she lied to the police because she was
worried about losing custody of her son to her previous boyfriend. (Tr. 75-76) When he
went to court, he received a continuance, and after leaving court he learned the charge
was dismissed. (Tr. 71-73)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a cross-alleges the criminal conduct in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c.
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges Applicant failed to disclose that he was charged with the felonies
of rape and infliction of injury on his May 2, 2018 SCA. Applicant did not disclose that he
was charged with rape and infliction of injury on his May 2, 2018 SCA; however, there is
no evidence Applicant was charged with rape and infliction of injury. There is no evidence
Applicant failed to disclose required information on his SCA.

"Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleges  33  debts  totaling  $64,000.  The  SOR  also
alleges failure to timely file Federal and state income tax returns from 2015 through 2018.
Applicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline F, SOR 1.a-1.hh. Under Guideline
J,  the  SOR  2.a-d  alleges  criminal  activity  from  2011  to  2018.  Applicant  admitted  each

(Item 3)
Applicant,  during  her  2018-2019  investigative  interview,  stated  that  she  was
unaware of any information about the accounts at issue. She stated that she would follow
up  with  the  accounts  by  the  end  of  the  year.  The  debts  are  attributed  to  periods  of
unemployment in 2015 and all of 2012. (Item 3)  Her credit reports confirm the delinquent
accounts. (Items 5, 6) Applicant stated that if they are her accounts, she would start a
payment plan. However, she is unaware of when the accounts will be fully resolved. Her
intent is to pay all her accounts, which are mainly medical and auto loans. (Item 4)

In  addition  to  Applicant’s  financial  problems,  she  has  been  arrested  four  times
since  July  2012,  and  charged  with  various  criminal  violations.  (Items  2,4,7-11)  She
admitted each criminal violation and disclosed them on her security clearance application.
(Item 2-3)
As  to  SOR  2.a,  she  was  arrested  in  July  2011  and  charged  with  possession  of

"Applicant is 23 years old, and unmarried.  He has a high school diploma.  He is
employed by a defense contractor as a maintenance electrician.  He is seeking to obtain
a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Guideline J – Criminal Conduct
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has  engaged  in  criminal  activity  that
creates doubt about a  person’s judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  and  calls  into
question a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended  purpose,  which  can  raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
After  graduation  from  high  school,  in  July  2014,  Applicant  began  working  in  an
apprenticeship at a Navy shipyard  as a maintenance electrician.  (Government Exhibit
3.)    In  2016,  he  applied  for  a  security  clearance,  which  was  granted.    (Government
Exhibit 4.)  Applicant states that in October 2017, he was  riding as a passenger in his
car with two friends when the police stopped the car for speeding.  The officer smelled
THC  and  reported  seeing  marijuana  residue in  the  console  of  the  vehicle.  The  officer
asked  to  search  the  vehicle  and  found  a  small  bag  of  THC  in  the  back  seat  area.
Initially neither Applicant nor his friends admitted ownership of the THC.  The officer told
Applicant  and  his  friends  that  he  would  ticket  all  of  them  unless  someone  took
responsibility.    Applicant  then admitted  ownership  of  the THC,  not because  it  was  his,
but because the car was his, and he did not want to sit on the side of the road all day.
Applicant claims that the THC was actually his friend’s.  The officer issued Applicant a
summons  and  when  Applicant  appeared  in  court  he  was  charged  with  Misdemeanor
Possession  of  Marijuana.    (Government  Exhibit  1.)    In  November 2017,  Applicant  was
found guilty of Possession/Distribution of Controlled Drug Paraphernalia and ordered to
pay a fine and costs.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)
Applicant  claims  that  he  did  not  know  that  he  was  pleading  guilty  to  a  drug
charge because he did not have an attorney.  He instead thought that he was pleading
guilty  to  a  traffic  violation.    (Government  Exhibit  6.)    The  court  records  indicate
otherwise.  (Government Exhibit 5.)

"Under Guideline G, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in 2014 for driving
while  intoxicated  (DWI),  pled  guilty  and  was  convicted  in  January  2016.  His  sentence
included  15  months’  probation.  He  participated  in  treatment  from  December  2017  to
January  2018  following  a  diagnosis  of  alcohol  use  disorder.  Applicant  was  arrested  in
March 2018 and charged with DWI, second offense. He pled guilty and was convicted in
January 2019. His sentence included 180 days confinement, suspended, and 15 months’
probation. He was evaluated in March 2019 and diagnosed with moderate alcohol use
disorder in early partial remission. Applicant was advised to abstain from all mood altering
chemicals, including alcohol. Applicant admits each of these allegations. Applicant stated
in his answer that he also participated in treatment from April 2018 until June 2018. The
two DWI arrests are cross alleged under Guideline J. Applicant admits the Guideline J
allegation.
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified material
facts  on  his  2012  and  2014  e-QIPs  by  failing  to  disclose  that  he  had   illegally  used
marijuana from May 2004  until  2012. Applicant  admits  the two allegations under Guideline
E.  Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant, 35, is a trade compliance specialist employed by a defense contractor
since August 2016. He worked for another defense contractor from April 2013 until August
2016. He received his associate’s degree in 2007 and his bachelor’s degree in 2012. He
married  in  2015  and  he  and  his  wife  have  two  children.  He  was  previously  granted  a
security clearance in February 2014. (GX 3; GX 4.)
In  response  to  DOHA’s  June  2020  interrogatories,  which  stated  that  records
obtained in Applicant’s background investigation revealed past illegal-drug use and asked
Applicant to describe his marijuana use, Applicant disclosed that he first used marijuana
in May 2004 and last used it in 2012 with a frequency of less than once a month. He did
not disclose this use on his 2012 and 2014 e-QIPs as required. (GX 4; GX 3.) The record
does not contain any explanation by Applicant regarding his falsifications.
In May 2014, while holding a security clearance, Applicant consumed eight or nine
beers over approximately three hours with his then girlfriend now wife at her home. They
got into an argument and Applicant left with the intention of dropping to his parents’ house.
He  was  pulled  over  for  speeding  and  ultimately  arrested  for  DWI  with  a  blood  alcohol
content of .13. In approximately January 2016 he pled guilty to DWI and was sentenced
to  15  months  of  supervised  probation,  70  hours  of  community  service,  a  fine  of
approximately $1,000, and required to pay the state DWI surcharge of $800 a year for
three years. He was also required to attend alcohol awareness classes. He underwent a
court-ordered alcohol abuse evaluation and the evaluator did not recommend treatment.
In December 2017, Applicant voluntarily entered an alcohol treatment program where he
was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. He participated in the program for 30 days. (GX
4.)
In March 2018, Applicant was drinking beer at home, argued with his wife, and got
in his car and drove away. He was pulled over for speeding and ultimately arrested for
DWI with a blood alcohol content of .08. In January 2019, he pled guilty to DWI and was
sentenced  to  180  days  in  jail,  suspended,  15  months’  supervised  probation  which
included random alcohol and drug screening, 60 hours of community service, court costs
and fines of $850, and the state DWI surcharge of $800 for three years. (GX 4.) He was
still on probation when he underwent his 2019 background investigation.
In  April  2018,  Applicant  again  voluntarily  entered  an  alcohol  abuse  treatment
program at the same facility. He successfully completed a 60-day program in June 2018
and Applicant asserts that has maintained sobriety since completing the program and that
he regularly attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. (GX 4; GX 3.) However, he did not
submit any substantiating evidence of his continued abstinence.
Applicant  again  underwent  a  court-ordered  alcohol-abuse  evaluation  in  March
2019 and was diagnosed with moderate alcohol use disorder in early partial remission.
The evaluator made the following recommendations: that Applicant remain abstinent from
all  mood  altering  chemicals  to  include  alcohol;  that  Applicant  undergo  random  drug
screening; and that Applicant participate in a 30-hour DWI intervention course for repeat
DWI offenders. The evaluator did not recommend treatment unless evidence indicated
that Applicant was using alcohol or illegal drugs or abusing prescription medication,  in
which case he should be required to participate in intensive outpatient treatment. (GX 4.)

"Applicant  is  a  26-year-old  pipefitter  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since
December 2017. Applicant’s mother and stepfather served on active duty in the military
and are now retired. (GX 7 at 1; Tr. 29-30.) While his parents were assigned overseas,
Applicant  graduated  from  a  high  school  on  a  military  installation  in  June  2012.  After
graduating from high school, he worked for his uncle’s business as an appliance installer.
He attended college full time from June 2012 to June 2013, and was a part-time student
for a few months in 2013 and 2016 but did not receive a degree. (GX 7 at 2.) He served
on active duty in the U.S. Navy from April 2015 to June 2017 and received an other than
honorable (OTH) administrative discharge. He held a security clearance in the Navy. (GX

Applicant married in July 2015 and divorced in April 2018. He has a six-year-old
child  from  this  marriage.  He  now lives  with  his  fiancée,  who  has  three  children  from  a
previous relationship, and they had a child together in September 2020. (Tr. 27-28).
On October 5, 2015, a female sailor notified the Fleet and Family Services Center
at the base where she was assigned that she had been sexually assaulted by Applicant.
On  October  6,  2015,  The  Fleet  and  Family  Services  Center  notified  the  base  Naval
Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) office that the female sailor had reported a sexual
assault and that a sexual assault forensic examination had been performed at the base
hospital. An NCIS investigator interviewed the female sailor on the same day, and she
told the investigator that Applicant had sexually assaulted her by oral-vaginal and penile-
vaginal  intercourse  while  she  verbally  protested  and  physically  struggled  to  make  him
stop.  She showed the NCIS  text  messages between Applicant  and her  supporting her
complaint, including one in  which Applicant  told the female sailor, “[Y]ou make it seem
like  I  raped  you.”  The  NCIS  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI)  states  that  Applicant  was
interrogated and admitted sexually assaulting her but denied attempting to have penile-
vaginal intercourse. The ROI reflects that a crime laboratory identified Applicant’s semen
on the crotch area of the female sailor’s underwear. (GX 6 at 6.) The ROI also reflects
that,  on  October  21,  2015,  the  female  sailor  told  an  investigator  that  she  realized  that
Applicant did not sexually assault her “as reported,” because, “although she did not know
it at the time, she actually wanted [Applicant] to engage in the described sexual activity
with her.” (GX 6-7.)
The ROI does not include a written statement from Applicant, a written statement
from  the  female  sailor,  or  the  laboratory  reports  identifying  Applicant’s  semen  on  the
female sailor’s underwear. However, in November 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a
security  investigator  regarding  the  SCA  he  had  submitted  in  April  2018.  The  interview
included  questioning  about  the  NCIS  ROI.  Applicant  denied  sexually  assaulting  the
female sailor. (GX 7 at 7.) He told the security investigator that he and the sailor had been
casually dating for one or two months. He was still married at the time but did not tell the
female sailor that he was married. On October 2, 2015, the female sailor suggested that
they get a hotel room for the weekend, because they had been unable to do so on the
previous weekend to celebrate Applicant’s birthday. Applicant picked up the female sailor
at her barracks on the evening of October 3. They were both in   “A” school, residing in
barracks,  and required  to have  a “buddy” whenever they left  the base. Applicant  signed
the  female  sailor  out  as  her  “buddy.”  They  arrived  at  the  hotel   late  at  night.  Applicant
consumed six or seven strong alcoholic drinks and was intoxicated.
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  they  began  kissing  with  the  lights  off.  He
removed her underwear with her help, and he began giving her oral sex. When the female
sailor complained that he was being too rough, he stopped the sexual activity and went
to sleep. The next morning, the female sailor told Applicant that she did not like his rough
behavior with her. Applicant apologized and told her that he did not intend to be rough.
According to Applicant, they stayed at the hotel, “hanging out and joking, until the morning
of Sunday, October 5, when Applicant took the female sailor back to her barracks. (GX 7
at 6.)
On October 6, 2015, Applicant was given a “protective order,” requiring him to stay
away from the female sailor. During the security interview in November 2018, he told the
security  investigator  that  he  admitted  to  the  NCIS  that  he  had  sexually  assaulted  her,
because the NCIS investigator told him that witnesses at the hotel had heard the female
sailor  screaming,  and  the  NCIS  had  retrieved  text  messages  from  the  female  sailor’s
cellphone that were consistent with her accusations. He also told the security investigator
that, while the protective order was in effect, the female sailor contacted him by telephone
a couple of times, told him that “she was going to make the situation right,” and said that
she felt bad about what she had said about him. (GX 7 at 7.) At the hearing, Applicant
admitted calling the female sailor once, in violation of the protective order, but he testified
that all other communication was indirect through mutual friends. (Tr. 24, 37-38.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  while  he  was  performing  oral  sex  on  the
female sailor, she told him that she was uncomfortable, and he stopped and went to sleep.
He testified that he apologized on the next morning for being “a tad bit aggressive.” They
“hung out” in the hotel room all day, except for shopping for food and snacks. He testified
that they cuddled and watched television, and that he was with the female sailor when
she talked to her family on FaceTime. (Tr. 40.) On Monday morning, he was surprised
when he was required to report to the NCIS for questioning. (Tr. 21-23.)
At the hearing, Applicant initially denied that he attempted to have penile-vaginal
intercourse with the female sailor. He could not explain why his semen was found on her
underwear. (Tr. 34-35.) He then admitted that it was possible that he attempted to have
penile sex with her, but he did not remember it because he was intoxicated. (Tr. 35.) Upon
further questioning, he testified that he remembered trying to have penile  sex, but she
said  “No”  and  he  stopped.  (Tr.  54.)  He  initially  testified  that  he  remembered  being
questioned  by  NCIS  investigators,  and  that  the  questioning  was  recorded,  but  upon
further questioning, he testified that he did not remember the interrogation and did not
know if he admitted having penile-vaginal sex with the female sailor. (Tr. 36-37, 52.)
Between  October  2015  and   June   2017,   Applicant’s  commanding  officer   and
executive officer were reassigned, and  their replacements had  no knowledge of the facts
of the case except for the information in the files. (GX 7 at 7.) On a date not reflected in
the record, Applicant was charged with sexual assault in violation of Article 120, Uniform
Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  10  U.S.C.  §  920.  (GX  3.)  Sexual  assault  is  a  felony,
triable by court-martial, and punishable by dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay
and allowances, and confinement for 30 years. Manual for Courts-Martial (2016 ed.), Part
IV, ¶ 45.e.(2). The charges, which included an allegation of forcible anal intercourse, were
referred to an investigating officer in accordance Article 32, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 832 (the
military equivalent of a grand jury). The female sailor declined to testify. The investigating
officer recommended dismissal of the charges. On January 18, 2017, the command staff
judge  advocate  recommended  against  prosecution.  (GX  4.)  NCIS  closed  its  report  on
June 19, 2017.
On February 16, 2017, Applicant appeared before his commanding officer, a Navy
captain,  and  admitted  that  he  was  guilty  of  adultery.  His  commanding  officer  imposed
nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 815, for adultery, in violation
of  Article  134,  UCMJ,  10  U.S.C.  §  934.  Applicant’s  punishment  was  reduction  in  pay
grade, forfeiture of $1,732 of his pay, and restriction to quarters for 60 days. (GX 4.)
After  Applicant
received  nonjudicial  punishment,  his  command
initiated
administrative separation for serious misconduct. Applicant waived his right to a hearing
before a board of officers and was discharged on June 23, 2017, with an OTH discharge.
The  Sexual  Assault  Disposition  Report  lists  the  basis  for  Applicant’s  discharge  as
“commission of a serious offense” and lists the offense that was the basis for separation
as a “sexual assault offense.” (GX 2; GX 4 at 3.) At the hearing, in this case, Applicant
testified that he did not request a hearing to contest the allegation of serious misconduct
because his lawyer advised him not to talk to anyone about the incident, and he assumed
that the advice applied to an administrative discharge board. (Tr. 57-58.) In his closing
statement, he explained that when he went to captain’s mast instead of a court-martial,
he was thankful for not facing 30 years in the brig and registering as a sex offender, and
he focused on moving on with his life, not realizing that he might need a security clearance
for future jobs. (Tr. 64-65.)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that he started drinking alcohol heavily after he
was accused of sexual assault. He realized that he was drinking too much, and that he
stopped  drinking  after  he  was  discharged  from  the  Navy  in  June  2017.  Department
Counsel then asked him, “Do you do anything else, any marijuana, anything like that?”
He responded that he had been smoking marijuana daily from the date of his discharge
from the Navy until the day before the hearing. He explained that he used marijuana to
control his anxiety and depression because he was unable to obtain anxiety medications
from  the  Veterans’  Administration.  (Tr.  42-47.)  The  record  does  not  reflect  whether
Department Counsel had a factual basis for questioning Applicant about marijuana use
or whether Applicant’s disclosure of his marijuana use was an unexpected answer to a
general exploratory question.
When Applicant submitted his SCA  in  April  2018, he listed his military service in
Section  13A  (Employment  Activities)  and   stated  that  he  “left  by  mutual   agreement
16.) In  Section 15 (Military History), he  disclosed his OTH di
following  charges or allegations of misconduct” and  described  the allegation as adultery.
(GX 1 at
scharge and stated
that  the  reason for   the  discharge was,  “I   committed  adultery.”  In   the  same  section, he
disclosed his nonjudicial  punishment for adultery.  (GX  1 at 19-20.) He  answered “No” to
a  question   in   Section   22,  asking  if  he  had   ever  been  charged  with  a  felony  offense,
including an offense  under the UCMJ.  He  also answered “No” to a question in  Section 23,
asking if he had  illegally used any drugs or  controlled substances during the last seven
years. At the hearing,  he was not questioned about his negative answer in  Section 23,
but he admitted his failure to  disclose his marijuana use. He did not  offer any explanation
for  his failure to disclose his marijuana  use,  either at the hearing or during the additional
time  the record was held open after the hearing.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f,
3.a, and 3.b. He denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. His admissions in his answer and at
the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 33-year-old vehicle refueler employed by a defense contractor since
October 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married, but
he  has  lived  with  a  cohabitant  since  October  2016.  He  and  his  cohabitant  have  a  16-
month-old daughter. (Tr. 19.)
Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in
2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014. He stopped
using it because his employer started random drug testing, and he realized that it could
jeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.) In his first SCA in February 2007, he answered “No” to the
question whether he had used a drug or controlled substance within the past seven years.
(GX  1  at  23.)  He  testified  that  he  could  not  remember  why  he  did  not  disclose  his
marijuana use. (Tr. 28.) He also testified that there was no reason why he continued to
use marijuana until 2014, except stupidity. (Tr. 30.)
Applicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with brandishing a firearm. His
arrest occurred after he was involved in a bar fight, and one of the participants told police
that  he  had  brandished  a  firearm.  The  police  stopped  him  as  he  drove  away  from  the
scene of the fight. He testified that he has never owned a firearm. The police searched
the  vehicle  and  did  not  find  a  firearm.  He  appeared  in  court  and  was  found  not  guilty
because the police were unable to find a firearm. (GX 4 at 3; Tr. 34-35.)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  February  2009  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana. After the police stopped him for speeding, they found marijuana in the center
console of his car. He appeared in court and adjudication was deferred. He was placed
on probation for one year, required to attend drug-education classes, and was subjected
to  random  urinalysis.  He  successfully  completed  his  probation  and  the  charges  were
dismissed. (GX 4 at 3; GX 5.) He did not disclose this arrest in his February 2017 SCA,
because he was told that his arrest record would be expunged. (Tr. 31.)
In  November  2010,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana and having defective equipment on his car. After Applicant completed a period
of probation and drug classes, the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 12.) Applicant
did  not  disclose  this  arrest  to  his  employer.  He  testified  that  he  was  unaware  of  any
requirement  to  disclose  arrests  to  his  employer.  He  did  not  disclose  this  arrest  or  his
continued use of marijuana in his February 2017 SCA, because he was afraid that it would
jeopardize his clearance and his job. (Tr. 32-33, 39.)
In  January  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  with  reckless  driving,  having  an  open
container  of  alcohol  in  his  car,  and  possession  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was  with  his
cousin, and he told the police that the marijuana was his, because he did not want his
cousin to get in trouble. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant was convicted of the open-container offense
and reckless driving, but the marijuana charge was dismissed. (GX 13.)
In November 2013, Applicant was arrested for maliciously causing bodily injury to
his  cohabitant.  He  testified  that  his  cohabitant  was  driving  home  after  they  had  been
drinking at a bar, they began arguing, his cohabitant began swerving, and he grabbed the
steering wheel to keep the car from striking a guardrail. The police officer who noticed the
swerving stopped them, noticed a cut on the cohabitant’s forehead, and concluded that
Applicant had hit her in the face. Applicant spent a week in jail after his arrest. (Tr. 53-
55.) The charge was later reduced to  assault and battery. In February 2014, the court
found “facts  sufficient  to  find guilt,”  but  deferred adjudication for  one  year.  The  charge
was dismissed in February 2015. (GX 7.)
Applicant  submitted  his  second  SCA  in  February  2017.  He  answered  “No”  to  a
question  whether,  during  the  last  seven  years,  he  had  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled substances. He also answered “No” to a question whether he had ever used
or  otherwise  been  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a
security clearance. (GX 2 at 26.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2018, he
told the investigator that he had never been charged with an offense related to alcohol or
drugs.  When  the  investigator  confronted  him  with  evidence  of  his  arrest  record,  which
included drug offenses, he disclosed his marijuana use, beginning in his teenage years
and ending in 2014. He told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use
while holding a security clearance because it did not matter, since he had stopped using
marijuana. He also told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use because
he misread the question. (GX 3 at 12-13.)
In July 2018, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on his cohabitant.
Applicant testified that he was driving home after work after a long work day and spending
some time at a friend’s house. He fell asleep and hit the rear of an 18-wheel truck. His
cohabitant  came  to  the  scene  and  was  taking  him  home  when  they  began  arguing,
because his cohabitant refused to take him to a hospital. Applicant became angry and
cracked the windshield of their car by punching it with his fist. His cohabitant called the
police,  who  concluded  that  they had been fighting. (Tr.  57-63.)  A protective order  was
issued, prohibiting Applicant from having any contact with his cohabitant for three days.
(GX 9.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  charged  and  the  protective  order  was  issued
because his cohabitant “got all hysterical” and told the police that he had smacked her.
He  admitted  that,  on  several  occasions,  he  grabbed  her  and  shook  her  after  she  said
things intended to provoke him. (Tr. 50-51.) In September 8, 2018, he appeared in court
and  pleaded  no  contest.  The  judge  found  “facts  sufficient  to  find  guilt”  and  deferred
adjudication  until  September  2020.  (GX  8.)  Applicant  completed  his  probation  and  the
charge was dismissed. (Tr. 63.) Applicant and his cohabitant stayed apart for about seven
or eight months after his arrest. (Tr. 64.) He testified that most of their arguments arose
from his cohabitant’s desire that he stay at home instead of socializing with friends away
from  home  and  her  practice  of  saying  things  that  she  knew  would  provoke  him.  He
testified that the arguments and physical violence stopped after their daughter was born.
(Tr. 51-52.)
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI). His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was 0.17. In the jurisdiction where he
was arrested, jail time is mandatory for a BAC at or above 0.15. In March 2019, Applicant
was convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 175 days suspended, and a $250
fine.  He  was  placed  on  unsupervised  probation  for  one  year.  His  driver’s  license  was
restricted for one year, and he was required to install an ignition interlock on his vehicle.
(GX 10.) He served his jail sentence on weekends. (Tr. 66.)
Applicant admitted that many of his arrests were related to alcohol, but he does
not believe he has an alcohol problem. He has reduced his drinking since the birth of his
daughter. He drinks mainly on weekends and limits himself to about two drinks  or two
beers. (Tr. 67.) He has never been diagnosed with an alcohol-abuse disorder or received
treatment for it.
",False
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  computer  system  analyst  employed  by  a  federal
contractor since February 2020. He has been employed by federal contractors for various
jobs since May 2007. He has held a security clearance since June 2012.
Applicant married in February 2003, divorced in April 2004, and married in October
2010. He and his wife have a three-year-old son. He has a 13-year-old daughter from an
earlier relationship. He was unaware that he had a daughter until he was contacted by
her mother when their daughter was five years old. (Tr. 21.)
Applicant grew up in the foster-care system, living with multiple families and group
homes. As a person of color growing up in a predominantly white area, he encountered
frequent instances of racism and harassment. In high school he found tobacco spit on his
locker and letters in his locker calling him the “N” word. He received threatening telephone
calls and was ejected from restaurants. (Tr. 19-20.)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  as  a  combat  engineer  in  the  U.S.  Army  from
February 2002 to August 2006. He served two tours of duty in a combat zone and was
honorably discharged as a sergeant. He received the Army Commendation Medal three
times. Notwithstanding his receipt of nonjudicial punishment shortly before his discharge
(discussed below), he received the Good Conduct Medal. (AX K.)
Applicant received an associate’s degree in May 2008 and a bachelor’s degree in
sports management in July 2012. He also has received numerous technical certifications
in computer security and physical fitness. (AX L.)
The SOR alleges 12 instances of criminal conduct. The evidence concerning those
instances is summarized below in chronological order.
SOR ¶ 1.l. In April 1997, Applicant was charged with criminal mischief. Although
he admitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR, he testified at the hearing that he
could not remember anything about it. (Tr. 27.)
SOR ¶ 1.k. In July 1997, Applicant was charged with 2d degree assault, a felony,
and 3rd degree assault, a misdemeanor. Although he admitted this allegation in his answer
to the SOR, he testified at the hearing that he could not remember anything about it. (Tr.
27.)
SOR ¶ 1.j. In July 1999, Applicant was at a park with a group of friends when they
were confronted by another group, and a brawl ensued. All the participants were charged
with felony criminal mischief and harassment. Applicant paid a $150 fine for harassment.
He disclosed this incident in a previous SCA submitted in September 2008. (GX 1 at 32;
GX 4 at 10.)
SOR  ¶¶  1.i  and  1.f:  In  December  1999,  Applicant  was  charged  with  underage
possession of alcohol. He testified that he remembered that the police came to a party,
and he paid a $25 fine. (GX 1 at 30; GX 4 at 12.) He was arrested again for underage
possession of alcohol in May 2001. He testified that this arrest occurred when he was
riding  as  a  passenger  in  a  car  with  an  open  container  of  alcohol.  (Tr.  24.)  He  was
sentenced to 30 hours of community service. (GX 1 at 28; GX 4 at 12.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i. In April 2001, Applicant was charged with trespassing in April
2001 and May 2001. He paid a $50 fine for each offense. (GX 1 at 29-30.) At the hearing,
he  testified  that  he  could  not  remember  the  circumstances  of  these  incidents,  but  he
remembered that they occurred at a gas station. (Tr. 24-25, 50.)
SOR  ¶  1.e.  In  September  2004,  while  Applicant  was  on  active  duty,  he  was
charged with battery and disorderly conduct after being involved in a fight outside a bar.
Applicant testified that he remembered the incident but did not remember the outcome.
(Tr. 24.) He testified that he did not remember whether he had been drinking alcohol. (Tr.
44.) The battery charge, for hitting a female bar employee in the face as she tried to break
up the fight, was dismissed for lack of evidence. He was convicted of disorderly conduct
and sentenced to 10 days in jail (suspended) and a $266 fine. (GX 5 at 6-8; GX 7.)
SOR ¶ 1.d. On June 25, 2006, Applicant was involved with an incident with the
military police. According to the police report, Applicant was ordered by military police to
show his identification and became disorderly and disrespectful. When the military police
attempted to apprehend him, he resisted and began threatening them. He was taken to
the military police station, processed, and released to his first sergeant. The military police
report  reflects  that  alcohol  was  involved.  (GX  6  at  5.)  On  July  25,  2006,  his  company
commander  imposed  nonjudicial  punishment  for  resisting  apprehension,  disorderly
conduct, and disrespect toward a superior. His punishment was an oral reprimand and
14 days of extra duty. His company commander noted on the record of punishment that
his  last  day  of  active  duty  was  on  July  28,  2006,  three  days  after  punishment  was
imposed. (GX 6 at 2.) Although Applicant admitted this incident in his answer to the SOR,
he testified at the hearing that he did not remember anything about it. (Tr. 39.)
When Applicant submitted an earlier SCA in  September 2008, he answered “no”
to the following  question:  “In  the last 7 years, have  you been  subject to court martial or
other disciplinary proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice? (Include  non-
judicial,  Captain’s  mast,  etc.).”  At  the   hearing,  he  testified  that  he  did  not  remember
responding to the question. When confronted with a copy of the SCA, he said, “It doesn’t
say  Article   15.  It  says  court-martial.”  He   also  testified  that  he  did  not  know   that
“nonjudicial”  included   Article   15.  (Tr.  41-42.)  He   was   not  asked  and   did  not  address
whether  he thought his  punishment  was  “other  disciplinary  proceedings.”  His  failure  to
disclose his nonjudicial punishment in his 2008 SCA was not alleged in the SOR.
SOR ¶ 1.c. In November 2014, Applicant was visiting his daughter from a previous
relationship, who was then six years old. After a brief visit, he told his daughter’s mother
about his plans for future visits. According to Applicant, his daughter’s mother said, “Over
my dead body,” and started to walk away. Applicant then touched her shoulder and said,
“Let’s not make this harder than it needs to be.” His daughter’s mother sprayed him with
pepper spray and called the police. He was arrested and charged with assault by contact
and spent three or four hours in jail. He appeared before a judge in May 2015, pleaded
no contest, and was granted deferred disposition. He completed a 45-day probation, and
the charges were dismissed in July 2015. (Tr. 39; GX 4 at 8; AX H.)
SOR ¶ 1.b. In July 2016, a police officer found Applicant slumped over in his car
in a street intersection and noticed a strong smell of alcohol. The police report reflected
that Applicant was awakened by the police and attempted to start his car and drive away.
After the police shut of his ignition and he exited the vehicle, he was agitated and began
cursing at the police. (GX 3 at 18.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that he could not
remember  any  interactions  he  had  with  the  police.  (Tr.  35.)  Two  breathalyzer  tests
registered a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.173 and 0.160. He was charged with driving
under the influence (DUI) and impeding traffic. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to
confinement  for  12  months  and  40  hours  of  community  service.  The  confinement  was
probated and he was placed on unsupervised probation. He completed a court-ordered
evaluation, community service, a risk-reduction course, and a DUI school. The evaluator,
a  certified  alcohol  and  drug  counselor,  concluded  that  he  had  “no  apparent  alcohol
problem”  and  that  alcohol  or  drug  treatment  was  not  recommended.  (GX  3  at  42-43.)
Applicant completed his probation in December 2018. (GX 3 at 3, 18-28; AX F.)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that he could not remember if he disclosed any
earlier  criminal  arrests  to  the  evaluator.  (Tr.  37-38.)  The  record  of  the  court-ordered
evaluation reflects that he disclosed his DUI and an arrest for disorderly conduct, but he
denied having any other charges or arrests in his lifetime. (GX 3 at 40.)
SOR ¶ 1.a. In June 2017, Applicant and his wife, who was six months pregnant,
had an argument while at a party. Applicant testified that he had been drinking at the party
but  could not  remember  if he was  drunk. (Tr. 33.)  The argument continued when they
went home, and  Applicant’s wife  hit him with a curling iron. According to Applicant, he
grabbed her to keep her from hitting him. When he let her go, she grabbed her cellphone
and  said  that  she  was  calling  the  police.  At  some  point,  he  pushed  his  wife  into  an
unlocked  closet.  She  got  out  of  the  closet,  and  they  both  went  outside  into  the  yard.
Applicant took her cellphone from her, threw it into a neighbor’s yard, left the house, and
returned to the party. The next morning they apologized to each other. (Tr. 28-33.)
Applicant  and  his  wife  participated  in  marital  counseling  from  July  to  November
2017. (AX G.) In November 2017, Applicant’s security officer told him that there was an
outstanding  warrant  for  his  arrest.  He  went  to  the  police  station  to  inquire  about  the
warrant and was arrested for battery, family violence, and impeding his wife from making
a 911 call. Initially, he had also been charged with an aggravated assault by strangulation,
a felony, but prosecution of that offense was declined because there was no evidence of
strangulation. (AX E.)
After the felony charge was withdrawn, Applicant remained on pretrial probation.
In  August  2018,  he  completed  a  court-ordered  anger-management  course.  (AX  A.)  In
October 2018, he was placed in a family violence intervention program, consisting of 24
mandatory  classes.  In  March  2019,  he  completed  the  intervention  program,  and  the
prosecutor entered a nolle prosequi for the charges of battery, domestic violence, and
impeding a 911 call. (GX 3 at 9, 11, 13, 16; AX B; AX D.)
The commander of the military facility where Applicant was working as a contractor
employee terminated Applicant’s access to the facility until the charges based on the July
2017 incident were resolved. Because Applicant could no longer work at the facility, he
was  terminated  from  his  employment  in  December  2017.  However,  his  employer
submitted  a  letter  recommending  that  his  security  clearance  be  reinstated,  because
during  his  employment,  he  “never  showed  any  behavior  to  question  his  reliability,
trustworthiness,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  (AX  C  at  1.)
Applicant was unemployed until February 2020, when he was hired by another federal
contractor. (AX J.)
In  addition  to  the  charges  alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  was  charged  with  3rd
degree criminal mischief in October 1999. This charge was not alleged in the SOR, but
Applicant disclosed it in his September 2008 SCA. Applicant testified that he punched out
the windows in his girlfriend’s car after a friend of his girlfriend spit in his face and called
him the “N” word. (Tr. 49). In his 2008 SCA, he stated that the incident occurred during
an argument with his girlfriend. (GX 1 at 31. He was fined $1,200 and ordered to perform
150 hours of community service. (GX 1 at 30-31.) At the hearing, he said that he could
not remember if he had been drinking before he punched out the windows. (Tr. 50.) I have
considered  this  unalleged  conduct  for  the  limited  purposes  of  evaluating  Applicant’s
credibility, to determine whether he has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and as
part of my whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26,
2006).
At  the  hearing,  Applicant’s  wife  submitted  a  statement  stating  that  Applicant  no
longer abuses alcohol and has undergone a ‘tremendous degree of self-evaluation and
complete  reversal  of  his  previous  behaviors.”  (AX  I.)  Applicant  testified  that  he  now
consumes one or two beers once or twice a month. (Tr. 22.)
One of Applicant’s former supervisors submitted a letter describing him as honest,
trustworthy, respectful, and a compassionate person with praiseworthy perseverance and
ambition. (AX C at 2.) Applicant’s current program manager considers him a talented and
conscientious employee, a dedicated husband and father, and “the type of individual I am
glad to have hired.” (AX N at 3.) Two long-time friends consider him “smart and honest,”
and a person who “lives his life with integrity.” (AX N at 1-2.)

"Applicant is 36 years old.  He is married and has two children.  He has two years
of  community  college  and  four  years  of  trade  school.  He  is  employed  by  a  defense
contractor as a Quality Assurance Technician for Aircraft Production.  He is seeking to
obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  conduct,  drug  abuse,  and  dishonesty,
evidenced by numerous arrests and Felony convictions spanning most of his adult life.
(Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.)  He began working for his current employer in
October 2017.  (Government Exhibit 1).  He has never applied for a security clearance
before, and has no military service.  Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth
in the SOR.
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  2002.  He  went  on  to  school  for  auto
mechanics and briefly worked in the field.  He then went to work for a beer distribution
warehouse.  While  employed  there,  in  late  August  2006,  Applicant  was  involved  in  an
elaborate robbery scheme where he and his friends stole 1.25 million dollars.
Applicant  testified  that  he  and  four  friends  robbed  an  armored  truck.  Two  of
Applicant’s friends worked for the armored truck company.  Applicant explained that he
and his friends got uniforms from the friend who worked for the company.  Applicant’s
role in the heist was that of the get-a-way driver, so that he did not wear a uniform.  His
two friends went up to the armored truck, knocked on the door, and the doors opened.
They went into the vehicle, took a couple of bags of money, and came back to the car.
Applicant  then  drove  away.  Applicant  and  his  friends  were  said  to  have  stolen  1.25
million dollars from the heist.  After dividing the money between them, Applicant’s share
of the proceeds was about a quarter of a million dollars.  He bought clothes and a cell
phone.  Applicant was arrested when a private investigator who had been following two
of  his  friends  around,  who  worked  for  the  company,  traced  the  robbery  back  to  the
Applicant.  Applicant  was  charged  and  convicted  of  Grand  Theft:  Money,  Labor,
Property  over  $400,  a  Felony.  He  was  sentenced  to  two  years  in  state  prison.  He
actually served 13 months before being released in October 2007, as he was credited
for pretrial time served.  (Tr. pp.19 - 25.)
From  October  2007  to  June  2009,  Applicant  worked  as  a  Lube  Technician,
working  on  cars,  doing  oil  changes  and  the  like.  He  was  involved  in  a  motorcycle
accident  and  was  unemployed  until  November  2011.  During  this  idle  time,  Applicant
and his friends started using methamphetamines.  On at least two separate occasions,
Applicant was arrested for Possessions of a Controlled Substance, and Possession of
Drug  Paraphernalia.  On  both  occasions,  Applicant  was  arrested  with  friends  and
methamphetamine was confiscated.  Applicant was actually in the middle of the court
ordered  drug  program  for  his  first  offense,  when  he  was  arrested  for  possession  of
methamphetamines a second time.  (Tr. pp. 30-31.)  As a result of these convictions, in
September 2010, Applicant was placed on an 18-month Deferred Entry of Judgment for
Possession  of  a  Controlled  Substance  and  Possession  of  Drug  Paraphernalia.  On
about September 24, 2010, Applicant failed to appear for a Deferred Entry of Judgment,
and a Bench Warrant was issued.  On about December 1, 2010, he was sentenced to
one year of active formal probation, fined, and ordered to work with a probation officer in
a plan for substance abuse counseling and service.  Applicant claims that he has been
clean and sober since December 2010.  (Tr. pp. 25 - 32.)
In  November
2010,  Applicant  was
of
Possession/Manufacture/Sell of Dangerous Weapon, a Felony. Applicant explained that
he was with some friends when they were pulled over, and brass knuckles were found
in  the  Applicant’s  backpack.  He  was  sentenced  to  three  years  formal  probation,  and
one day in county jail.  (Tr. pp. 31 - 32.)
convicted
charged
and
A  few  months  later,  in  January  2011,  Applicant  was  charged   and  convicted  of
Forgery, a Felony.  Applicant  explained that he was cashing checks  that he knew  to be
fraudulent.  He  got the checks from  a friend of a friend.  Applicant  testified that he would
go to the banks and  cash them like they  were payments to  him for providing a service of
some  kind.     Applicant   did  this  at  least  three  times,  involving  three  fraudulent  checks.
Applicant  pled  nolo   contendere   to  Second  Degree  Commercial   Burglary  and   Grand
Theft  of Personal Property.   On or about February 9, 2011, Applicant was sentenced  to
two   years  confinement  in   state   prison   and  was  ordered  to  pay  restitution  of  $400.
Applicant  was  released  early  for   good  behavior,   and   was  given  six   weeks  credit  for
completing  school  and receiving  certificates in  various computer programs.   (Tr.  pp.  33-
35.)
Applicant was hired by his current employer in 2017.  On November 1, 2017, he
completed a security clearance application.  Section 23 of the application asked him, if
in the  last  seven years,  had  he  used any  illegal drugs  or  controlled  substances?  The
Applicant  answered,  “NO.”  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  his  use  of  methamphetamines
from January 2010 to December 2010.  (Government Exhibit 1.)
Section 23 of that same application asked the Applicant if in the last seven years,
had  he  been  involved  in  the  illegal  purchase,  manufacture,  cultivation,  trafficking,
production,  transfer,  shipping,  handling  or  sale  of  any  drug  or  controlled  substance?
Applicant answered, “NO.”  Applicant failed to disclose that he was arrested on at least
two  separate  occasions  for  Possession  of  Methamphetamines  in  2010.  (Government
Exhibit 1.)
Applicant was not truthful when he answered the questions in Section 23, and he
should have answered, “Yes,” to both questions on the application.  Although Applicant
acknowledged his drug use in the police record section of the application, he explained
that  the  reason  he  did  not  disclose  it  in  this  section  is  because  he  did  not  want  the
Government to think that he was still using drugs when he was not.  (Tr. pp. 40 and 42).
Applicant  was  not  truthful  here.  Applicant’s  deliberate  attempt  to  deceive  the
Government is unacceptable and shows immaturity and poor judgment.

"In his response to the  SOR, Applicant  admitted, with comments, all of the SOR
allegations  pertaining  to  financial  considerations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.j.),  criminal
conduct  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a.  through  2.t.),  and  personal  conduct  (SOR  ¶  3.a.).  Department
Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  SOR  essentially  by  moving  subparagraph  2.a.  to  new
subparagraph  3.b.  The  motion  was  granted  over  Applicant’s  objection.  (Tr.  at  18-20)
Applicant’s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and
thorough review of  the evidence  in the  record,  and upon due consideration of  same, I
make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a senior network engineer since July 2019. He previously held a variety of positions
(network  engineer,  development  network  engineer,  deployment  network  engineer,
information  management  senior  specialist,  and  senior  network  engineer)  with  different
employers since early 2003. He has received an offer from a new employer for a position
of  senior  network  engineer  with  a starting  annual  salary  of $160,000.  (AE AT)  He is a
1983 high school graduate. He enlisted in the US. Army in October 1984, and served on
active  duty  until  April  1987,  when  he  was  discharged  with  a  general  discharge  under
honorable conditions for unsatisfactory performance.  Although he was denied a secret
clearance on two occasions, he was granted a secret clearance on one occasion. He has
never been married. He has two children, born in 1988 and 1989.
Military Awards and Decorations
During his period of active duty, Applicant received the Army Service Ribbon, the
Overseas  Service  Ribbon,  the  Army  Achievement  Medal,  the  Marksman  Ribbon-M16,
and Hand Grenade Expert. (AE J)
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can  be  found  in  the  following  exhibits:  GE  1  (SF  86,  dated  June  21,  2017);  GE  5
(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated August 2, 2017); GE
6  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated  October  3,  2019);  GE  7  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated
August  19,  2020);  GE  8  (Statement,  dated  February  23,  2004);  GE  13  (Response  to
Interrogatories,  dated  October  7,  2019);  and  Applicant’s  Answers  to  SOR,  dated
December 27, 2019, and March 24, 2020.
In  his  SF  86,  Applicant  acknowledged  having  one  delinquent  account  that  he
claimed  that  he  had  never  opened.  He  denied  having  any  other  delinquent  accounts
within the past seven years. When he was interviewed by an investigator from the US.
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in June 2016, he acknowledged the one account
listed in his SF 86, as well as some medical bills that his health insurance should have
paid. Even after being confronted, he denied knowing anything about nearly a dozen other
delinquent  accounts.  In  November  2017,  while  again  being  questioned  by  an  OPM
investigator, he acknowledged the medical bills as well as two other delinquent accounts.
During  a  June  2018  OPM  interview,  he  added  several  additional  delinquents  to  the
discussion.
Applicant has experienced periodic financial difficulties at least since early 2004
when he had an automobile involuntarily repossessed after he lost a job and was unable
to pay his bills. (GE 13, at 16) In February 2004, he reported that he had six delinquent
accounts  totaling  over  $9,000.  (GE  8  (Personal  Financial  Statement))  In  addition,  he
attributed  some  of  his  financial  problems  to  having  to  make  $1,700  in  monthly  child-
support  payments.  Although  he  experienced  a  number  of  short-term  periods  of
unemployment between positions, he did not focus on any specific factors that rendered
him unable to maintain his accounts in a current status. He offered no evidence of ever
receiving  financial  counseling.  Instead,  aside  for  a  few  delinquent  accounts  that  were
apparently addressed by him prior to the issuance of the SOR in November 2019, as well
as those described below, commencing in June 2020, he engaged the services of a credit-
repair firm, and they disputed a variety of accounts without specifying the basis for the
disputes. (AE M) He terminated his relationship with the firm and started addressing his
creditors individually by himself.
The SOR alleged ten delinquent accounts totaling approximately $25,165, set forth
as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a.:  There  is  an  income  tax  lien  in  the  amount  of  $3,214 that  was  filed
against him in December 2018. (GE 2) The lien resulted in confusion over income as an
independent  contractor  under  a  Form  1099,  without  withholding.  When  the  issue  was
brought  to  his  attention,  he  established  a  repayment  plan  with  the  Internal  Revenue
Service (IRS), but failed to do so separately with the local government. (Tr. at 84-86) In
June 2020, seven months after the SOR was issued, Appellant and the office of tax and
revenue established an Installment Agreement under which Applicant agreed to start to
make monthly payments in the amount of $35.17 on August 1, 2020, and every month
thereafter until the tax liability is paid in full. He submitted documentation to confirm that
he has been in compliance with the Installment Agreement. (AE T; AE AR) The account
is in the process of being resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.b.:  There  are  condominium  association  assessments  for  the  period
January 1, 2018, through October 3, 2019, totaling $7,619. (GE 13, at 13-16) After he
was sued, but before the trial date, in October 2019, Applicant and the creditor agreed to
a Settlement Agreement under which he agreed to make a lump-sum payment of $3,000
on or before October 31, 2019. He made that payment on the due date. (AE F; AE AG)
The account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c.: There is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $108 that was
placed for collection. (GE 6, at 1; GE 7, at 2) In April 2020, Applicant and the collection
agent agreed that Applicant would deposit a post-dated check for the unpaid balance plus
a $10 fee on or by April 10, 2020. He actually paid the agreed amount on May 29, 2020,
six months after the SOR was issued. (AE AF; AE S) The account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d.: There is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $561 that was
placed for collection. (GE 6, at 2) Applicant paid the collection agent on October 5, 2020,
11 months after the SOR was issued, and over a week after the hearing took place. (AE
AA; AE AJ; AE AL) The account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e.: There is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $1,129 that was
placed for collection. (GE 6, at 2) In August 2020, nine months after the SOR was issued,
Applicant  and  the  collection  agent  agreed  to  a  repayment  plan  under  which  he  would
make a $20 payment on August 21, 2020, and every month thereafter he would make
two  preauthorized  recurring  $20  payments  until  the  outstanding  balance  is  satisfied  in
July 2021. (AE R; AE AH; AE AI) The account is in the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f.: There is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $4,773 that
was charged off. (GE 6, at 3; GE 7, at 4; GE 5, 7; AE AM) In September 2020, ten months
after the SOR was issued, Applicant and the creditor agreed to a repayment plan under
which, starting on the 18th of each month, he would make a $20 payment until the account
is paid in full. (AE AM) He submitted documentation indicating that the initial payment was
made on September 18, 2020, one week before the hearing. (AE AN) The account is in
the process of being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g.: There is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $2,503 that
was charged off, (GE 6, at 3; GE 7, at 4) In July 2020, eight months after the SOR was
issued,  Applicant  and  the  collection  agent  agreed  to  a  repayment  plan  under  which,
starting on October 2, 2020, he would make monthly payments of $50 until the account
is paid in full. (AE Q; AE AS; AE AZ) The account is in the very early process of being
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h.: There is a furniture-store charge account with an unpaid balance of
$2,085 that  was  placed for  collection. (GE 6,  at  3; GE 7,  at  4)  After  he was  sued, but
before  the  trial date,  in February  2020,  Applicant  and the  collection  agent  agreed to  a
Settlement Agreement under which they agreed to settle the account with a lump-sum
payment of $1,220 to be made by March 5, 2020. That payment was made in February
2020, and the collection agent considered the account to be settled in full. (AE H; AE L)
The account has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i.: There is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,661 that
was placed for collection. (GE 6, at 4-5; GE 7, at 5) After he was sued, but before the trial
date,  in  September  2020,  Applicant  and  the  collection  agent  agreed  to  a  Settlement
Agreement under which they agreed to settle the account with a lump-sum payment of
$1,330 to be made by September 18, 2020. Applicant submitted a Notice of Dismissal,
dated September 22, 2020, indicating that the lawsuit had been dismissed as paid and
satisfied. (AE C; AE O; AE AE) The account has been resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.j.:  There  is  a  clothing-store  charge  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of
$512 that was charged off. (GE 6, at 4; GE 7, at 3; GE 5, at 8) Applicant made a payment
of $384 in settlement of the account on May 29, 2020. (AE AO; AE AQ). The account has
been resolved.
In addition to the SOR debts discussed above, Applicant had delinquent accounts
with other creditors, most of which he started to resolve in 2020. (AE K; AE N; AE P; AE
U; AE AY)
As noted above, Applicant has received an offer from a new employer for a position
of senior network engineer with a starting annual salary of $160,000. That would increase
his  annual  salary  substantially  from  his  current  $133,900  annual  salary.  Prior  to  the
hearing, he reported his net monthly income from his current employer is approximately
$6,682, and his anticipated net monthly income from his new employer would be $9,357.
After his routine monthly expenses and pre-hearing debt payments, he anticipated having
a  monthly  remainder  of  approximately  $4,836  that  might  be  available  for  discretionary
spending or savings. (AE AX; AE AY) The actual remainder should be increased because
he was still reporting anticipated payments that he had already made for accounts that
have already been paid off. In addition, Applicant has applied to the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs for disability compensation. (AE A; AE B; AE AB; AE BA; AE D) As of
the closing of the record, no final decision on his application had been made.
Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct
When he was a child – from the third grade through the tenth grade – Applicant
experienced  behavioral  problems,  including  fighting  and  stealing,  and  as  a  result,  his
father required that he receive counseling two to three times per week. (GE 8, at 4) Some
of  that  behavior  continued,  for  Applicant  has  a  lengthy  history  of  criminal  conduct  and
questionable personal behavior, during which he exhibited something other than peaceful
activity, that he was angry, and was either offensively or defensively violent, commencing
in  March  1986  while  he  was  on  active  duty,  when  he  was  about  20  years  old,  and
continuing through at least June 2015. Included in that history are various incidents that
resulted in various arrests for misdemeanors and felonies, the issuance of peace orders
(similar  to  a  protection  order),  violations  of  military  standards  and  requirements,  court
decisions,  and  military  disciplinary  actions.  His  actions  while  on  active  duty  are  not
individually  alleged  in  the  SOR.  There  are  a  number  of  post-discharge  convictions,
several charges were dismissed or otherwise not prosecuted, and the final disposition is
not known for some of the incidents. The incidents and their eventual results, are listed
below:
SOR ¶ 3.b.: Applicant  received a general discharge under honorable conditions
from the U.S. Army in April 1987 for unsatisfactory performance, essentially for a variety
of military violations during 1986-87. (AE J; GE 13 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated
June 1, 2016, at 6-7)) When questioned about his discharge by a Special Agent from the
Defense Security Service in 2004, Applicant characterized his discharge basis as “unable
to perform” because he was struck in the head with a baseball bat during a fight, fracturing
his skull, and he was thereafter unable to perform his military duties. (GE 13 (Statement,
dated  February  23,  2004,  at  4))  He  later  explained  that  he  was  young  and  did  not
understand  life.  He  conceded  that  he  was  disrespectful  at  times,  and  had  numerous
fights. (GE 13 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated November 3, 2017, at 9))
SOR  ¶  2.b.:  In  April  or  May  1988,  he  was  arrested  for  simple  assault,  a
misdemeanor, but the prosecutor declined to file a charge, and the matter was apparently
dismissed when it was “non-papered.” (GE 10; AE E; GE 13 (Enhanced Subject Interview,
dated June 1, 2016, at 16))
SOR  ¶  2.c.:  In  February  1989,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  battery,  a
misdemeanor,  when  he  was  in  a  fist  fight  with  his  father.  He  explained  that  he  had
previously  been  abused  as  a  child,  and  he  became  very  angry  with  him.  His  father
reported the incident to authorities. Although he contended that he was not prosecuted,
he was, in fact, released on a bail bond, and placed on probation before judgment. (GE
9, at 9; GE 8, at 2)
SOR  ¶  2.d.:  In  October  1990,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  battery  and
malicious destruction of property (with a value less than $300), both misdemeanors, when
he grabbed a female friend’s arm too hard. The “victim” had broken the lock on Applicant’s
sister’s automobile, so he grabbed her arm. Both charges were dismissed nolle prosequi.
(Tr. at 65; GE 9, at 4, 9; GE 8, at 2)
SOR ¶ 2.e.: In February 1992, he was arrested and charged with assault with a
deadly weapon – a shod foot. He had met a former girlfriend at a club, but he chose to
give her the cold shoulder and she became confrontational. She purportedly pushed him
through a set of double doors, so he departed without further interaction. He went to a
nearby fast-food restaurant, and she showed up there as well. Talking resulted in another
argument, and then to another physical incident when she struck him, and he retaliated.
He kicked her with his shod foot. The charge was reduced to simple assault, to which he
entered  a  plea  of  guilty.  He  was  sentenced  to  one  year  of  supervised  probation,  and
ordered to serve 90 hours of community service. (Tr. at 70-72; GE 8, at 3; AE 9, at 4; GE
10, at 2)
SOR  ¶  2.f.:  In  July  1993,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  stalking,  a
misdemeanor. The charge was dismissed nolle prosequi. No other information regarding
the incident was developed because the documentation did not contain any other facts
and Applicant cannot recall the incident. (GE 8, at 3; GE 9, at 8)
SOR ¶ 2.g.: In January 1995, he was arrested and charged with simple assault, a
misdemeanor. He had dropped off his “expensive clothes” at the cleaners, and when he
went to retrieve them, he discovered that they  had destroyed them by using too much
bleach. He was furious and decided to grab them and leave without paying for the “poor
service.” The store manager followed him out and grabbed him. He turned around and
smacked her.  He was  convicted  and sentenced  to  confinement  (work  release)  for 180
days (150 days suspended), and two years’ supervised probation. (GE 8, at 3; GE 9, at
4; GE 10, at 4-6)
SOR ¶ 2.h.: In May 1997, he was arrested for destruction of property over $200, a
felony. He had previously given his girlfriend a laptop computer, but after an argument,
he  took  it  back  and  threw  it  into  the  trash,  where  the  police  found  it.  He  was  held  for
several hours, but the prosecutor declined to file a charge, and the matter was dismissed
when it was “non-papered.”  (GE 8, at 3-4; GE 9, at 4; GE 10, at 7)
SOR  ¶  2.i.:  In  April  2003,  a  temporary  peace  order  was  issued  against  him,
directing that he shall not commit an unspecified prohibited act; that he not contact the
unidentified petitioner; that he shall not enter an unspecified location; and that he shall
stay away from an unspecified someone or some thing or place. The peace order was
dismissed one week later. (GE 11, at 1-2) The basis for the peace order was not reported.
SOR ¶ 2.j.: In October 2005, another temporary peace order was issued against
him, directing that he shall not commit an unspecified prohibited act; that he not contact
the unidentified petitioner; that he shall not enter an unspecified location; and that he shall
stay away from the residence of the unspecified petitioner. The peace order was reissued
one week later, and finally dismissed three weeks later. (GE 11, at 3-5) The basis for the
peace order was not reported.
SOR ¶ 2.k.: In January 2007, he was arrested and charged with simple assault –
domestic  violence,  after  a  physical  altercation  with  his  brother.  Four  months  later,  the
charge was dismissed for want of prosecution. (GE 9, at 5; GE 10, at 8-11; AE E; Second
Answer, at 3)
SOR  ¶¶  2.l.,  2.m.,  and  2.n.:  In  May  2007,  August  2007,  and  January  2010,
temporary peace orders – all involving the same girlfriend as the petitioner – were issued
against him. They essentially directed that he shall not abuse, shall not contact, shall not
enter  residence,  and  shall  stay  away  from  school.  Each  of  the  peace  orders  was
dismissed when neither party appeared. (GE 11, at 6-8) The basis for the peace orders
was not reported.
SOR  ¶  2.o.:  In  May  2010,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  simple  assault,  a
misdemeanor. The charge was dismissed in September 2010. (GE 9, at 5-6; GE 10, at
12-16; AE E) The basis for the charge was not reported.
SOR ¶ 2.p.: In August 2011, he was arrested and charged with attempted threats
to do bodily harm – domestic violence, after a verbal dispute with his daughter. Upon his
plea  of  guilty,  he  was  sentenced  to  one  year  of  supervised  probation  and  180  days
(suspended). (GE 9, at 6; GE 10, at 17-20; AE E; Second Answer, at 3)
SOR ¶ 2.q.: In November 2011, a temporary peace order was issued against him,
and one week later, a final peace order was issued. (GE 11, at 9-10) The basis for the
peace order was not reported.
SOR  ¶  2.r.:  In  April  2012,  depending  on  which  GE  is  accurate,  he  was  either
arrested and charged with obstructing police – disobeying a lawful order; traffic offense –
speeding  83/55  mph;  and  disorderly  conduct,  according  to  the  Federal  Bureau  of
Investigation  (FBI)  Identification  Record  (GE  9,  at  6-7),  or  arrested  and  charged  with
speeding; and interfering with agency functions – disobeying a lawful order, according to
the district court and the Violation Notice that was issued to him by the police. (GE 12) I
find the court documentation more persuasive as it is primary evidence, not secondary
evidence.  He  was  fined  for  the  speeding  charge,  and  the  violation  of  the  lawful  order
charge was dismissed upon a plea agreement. (GE 12)
SOR  ¶  2.s.:  In  July  2012,  a  temporary  peace  order  was  issued  against  him,
directing that he shall not abuse, shall not contact, shall not enter residence, and shall
stay away from employment of the unspecified petitioner. The peace order was reissued
one week later, and finally dismissed three weeks later. (GE 11, at 11) The basis for the
peace order was not reported.
SOR  ¶  2.t.:  In  June  2015,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  simple  assault  –
domestic violence and attempted possession of a prohibited weapon (a stick), after his
soon-to-be  ex-brother-in-law  came  to  the  family  home  and  repeatedly  created  a
disturbance. Applicant simply attempted to protect his mother and sister. The following
month, the charges were dismissed for want of prosecution. (GE 9, at 7; GE 10, at 21-23;
Second Answer, at 3)
Applicant is remorseful about his violent past and he contends that he is no longer
the person he was when he was involved in the above conduct, and that his life now has
meaning and purpose. Although he screwed up in the past, he loved being in the military.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that he was “a screw up operating on auto pilot trying to
find myself.” Now that he has found himself, he can admit that he is not perfect. He is a
man who made mistakes, and he pays for them every day with the thought of knowing
that he did something wrong.  He apologizes for the past, but he cannot change what
previously occurred. He can, however, ensure that it will never happen again. (Second
Answer, at 3-4)
Character References
Applicant’s mother, older brother, and middle sister, are effusive in praise for him,
recognizing the difficulties he encountered when he was growing up. His brother recalled
the very traumatic childhood Applicant went through when he was physically, mentally,
and  sexually  abused  by  their  father  and  stepmother.  On  one  Christmas  occasion,  he
received no gifts, but was forced to sit and watch while the other members of the family
opened their gifts. At one point, their father tried to turn him over to the state. Applicant is
integrity,  considerate,
characterized  as  kind,  caring,  a  man  of  character  and
compassionate, very loving, engaging, and funny. He spreads his hugs and kisses to the
entire family, especially the children, and he serves as a mentor to one of his nephews.
Applicant’s past actions were due to the only way he knew how to deal with his problems:
he fought as a child and young adult. Now, he has direction and a purpose, and he cries
when he speaks about his past. For overcoming his troubled past, Applicant is considered
a success story. (AE AW; AE X; AE Z)
Current and former work colleagues are also extremely supportive of Applicant’s
access to classified information. One individual, a lead network architect, considers him
to be one of the most dedicated engineers that he has experienced in his career. He has
a strong work ethic, high quality work, adherence to protocol, knowledge and ability, and
a sincere ambition to serve others with the very best of his efforts. He is trustworthy and
honest. He is a fast-learner, and he is very careful and cautious about his work. In part,
because he has gone out of his way to welcome newcomers and resolve any problems
they  might  have,  pitches  innovative  ideas  at  company  meetings,  accepts  constructive
criticism, and remained late to complete time-sensitive projects, he has often been given
additional responsibilities and assumed a leadership role. (AE Y)
A former colleague worked with him for approximately six years, and aside from
his  favorable  comments  regarding  Applicant’s  work  performance,  he  commented
favorably  regarding  his  personal  life,  about  which  he  is  very  familiar.  He  noted  that
Applicant will be the first to admit that at times he has been quick tempered, but he seems
to  be  doing  all  in  his  power  to  be  more  self-aware  and  in  control  of  his  actions  and
reactions. (AE AV)
One individual, who has a nonprofit organization that operates transitional housing
for returning citizens, has known Applicant for over 50 years. He has watched him grow
up  into  a  respectable,  dependable,  and  trustworthy  man.  He  is  honest,  walks  with
integrity,  and  has  a  strong  work  ethic  and  sense  of  responsibility.  Applicant  has
volunteered to prepare a transition house to receive new participants, but also served as
a  mentor  to  teach  the  individual’s  son  and  his  cousin  about  painting  professionally,
cleaning up responsibly,  and the  importance of  working hard,  studying for  school,  and
being  careful  about  the  people  with  whom  he  hangs  around.  He  has  no  reservations
concerning Applicant’s character and fitness for a security clearance. (AE AU)

"In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, nearly
all of the SOR allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d. and
1.f., and 1.g.) and personal conduct (SOR ¶ 3.c. and 3.d.). Applicant’s admissions and
his  comments  are  incorporated  herein.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings
of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a help-desk technician since August 2018. He previously held a variety of full-time and
part-time  positions  (exchange  administrator,  cyber  watch  officer,  construction  security
assistant, package handler, security officer, substitute teacher, patient-care technician,
patient transporter, and environmental services) with different employers. He is a 2008
high  school  graduate.  He  enlisted  in  the  US.  Navy  Reserve  in  November  2014,  and
served on active duty until June 2015, when he was honorably discharged as a seaman
(E-3), and transferred to the Inactive Reserve. He is currently in the same military status.
He was granted a security clearance in 2014, but because of issues  discussed further
below, that clearance was suspended in November 2017, reinstated in July 2018, and
again suspended in April 2019. The most recent suspension is the basis for this security
clearance eligibility review. He was married in 2017. He has three children, born in 2012,
2014, and 2015, as well as one stepchild, born in 2010.
Military Awards and Decorations
During his period of active duty, Applicant received the National Defense Service
Medal and the Navy Marksman Ribbon for pistol and rifle. (AE I)
Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct
Applicant  is  involved  in  an  extremely  volatile  and  hostile  relationship  with  the
mother of one of his children, and that relationship that has led to numerous conflicts and
negative  interaction  that  resulted  in  Applicant’s  repeated  engagements  with  law
enforcement authorities and the court system. The SOR alleged seven different incidents
of criminal conduct, which also were alleged separately under personal conduct. Five of
the incidents, and possibly six of them, because Applicant could not recall one particular
incident,  consisted  of  interactions  involving  the  same  participants  during  2016  –  2019
associated  with  a  custody  dispute  over  their  child:  Applicant,  and  the  mother  of  the
particular child, who repeatedly brought charges against him, essentially for variations of
domestic  violence,  including  assault,  child  abuse,  and  trespassing;  and  the  eventual
resolution  of  the  various  criminal  charges,  with  the  charges  associated  with  the  six
incidents dismissed nolle prosequi or placed in a Stet status. The seventh incident was
unrelated to the others, and it referred to an incident involving Applicant’s operation of a
motor vehicle while intoxicated, with additional charges, during Mardi Gras, for which he
was convicted.
Because  the  child’s  mother  continued  to  interfere  with,  if  not  actually  prohibit,
Applicant’s attempts to see his daughter,  in 2015, he filed for custody. (Tr. at 25-26) At
that  point,  the  situation  turned  from  interference  with  his  visitation  rights  to  increased
hostility  involving  repeated  accusations  and  criminal  complaints  against  him.  The
incidents and their eventual results are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.f.  refers  to an  incident that actually took place in January 2016, not June
2016, as alleged  in  the SOR, when Applicant went to the residence of his child  and  her
mother to exercise his child visitation rights. A  verbal dispute took place when the mother
refused to allow Applicant to leave the residence with  their daughter.  Applicant  initially
refused to answer any questions regarding  the incident,  and  did not leave the residence
when  asked  to  do  so.  Eventually,  he  did  slowly  leave   the  building,  but  stopped
periodically.   He   was  arrested,  handcuffed,  and   transported  to  the  police  station  for
processing.  He  was charged with (1)  failure to obey a reasonable and  lawful order;  and
(2)   trespass  on  private  property,  both  misdemeanors.   In  July  2016,   all  charges  were
dismissed  nolle  prosequi   because  the  State  Attorney   acknowledged  that  there  was  a
custody agreement in  place. (GE 2, at  7-8; GE 3, at  3-4; GE 7, at 1-4, 31-32; AE D, at  10)
SOR ¶ 1.g. refers to an incident that actually took place in June 2016, not January
2016, as alleged in the SOR, when Applicant went to the residence of his child and her
mother to exercise his child visitation rights. A verbal dispute turned physical when the
mother refused to allow Applicant to leave the residence with their daughter. The mother,
designated the “victim” by the police, told the responding police officers that when she
tried to stop Applicant from leaving with their daughter, he started strangling her with both
hands around her neck for “about 3 minutes.” As he attempted to  depart,  the victim started
pulling on his shirt,  but he pushed her down. One arresting officer initially noted a slight
redness   on   the  victim’s  neck,  but  after  taking  photos  of  the   neck,   the  redness  was  no
longer  observable.  Another  arresting  officer  noted  scratch  marks   on  Applicant’s  neck.
Applicant  denied  attempting  to  strangle   the  woman.  Applicant   was  charged  with  (1)
assault  in   the  2nd   degree;  (2)   failure  to  obey  a  reasonable  and   lawful  order;  and   (3)
trespass on private property, all  misdemeanors.  A  handgun in  his car  was turned over to
the police at the time of the arrest, but it was later  returned  to him. (GE  7)  In  July 2016,
all charges were dismissed nolle prosequi. (GE 2, at 8; GE 3, at 4; GE 7, at 1-2, 5-26, 28-
30; AE D, at 9)
SOR ¶ 1.e. refers to an incident that reportedly took place in August 2016. No facts
regarding the circumstances of the incident were submitted by either party, and Applicant
did  not  recall  the  event.  For  some  unexplained  reasons,  Applicant  was  arrested  and
charged with (1) trespass on private property; (2) malicious destruction of property less
than $500; (3) and disorderly conduct, all misdemeanors. In March 2017, all charges were
dismissed nolle prosequi. (GE 3, at 4-5; GE 8, at 6-7; AE D, at 7-9)
In  January  2017,  an   Amended   Order  was  issued  by  the  court  ordering  that
Applicant and  the child’s mother shall have  joint legal  custody of the minor child. Among
the  compliance   requirements  were  that  all conversations,  interactions,  and   dealings  of
any sort  between  the parties shall be conducted in  a civil and  courteous manner; they
shall not place the child in  a stressful or traumatic situation  as a result of conflict  between
the parties;  and  neither party  shall disparage the other  party in  front of  the minor child.
(AE E)
SOR ¶ 1.c.  refers to an incident that took place on September 30, 2018.  Applicant
and  his wife met  with the child’s mother and  her boyfriend at a mall to exchange physical
custody of their daughter pursuant to the child custody agreement. An exchange of verbal
comments was followed by certain gestures, and  a mutual  physical assault occurred. The
two women  attacked each  other.  Both women sustained scratches on their faces, arms,
and  feet.  The  child’s mother claimed that Applicant  “strangled” her, allowing his wife to
scratch her face. In addition, she accused Applicant of holding her from behind for about
one   minute,  during  which   she   could  not   breathe.  Applicant  claimed  that  the  mother
punched  him  in   the  face,  but  acknowledged  trying  to   separate  the  two  women.   The
responding  police officer noted small  scratch marks on Applicant’s  arms but no noticeable
facial   injuries.   One  witness  acknowledged that  all four  individuals  were  involved  in   the
brawl, but did not specifically recall  Applicant choking the mother.  (GE 8, at 9-18) The
following day, Applicant  was arrested and  charged with (1)  assault in the 2nd  degree; and
(2)   reckless  endangerment,   both  misdemeanors.   In  January  2019,  all  charges  were
dismissed nolle prosequi. (GE 2, at 9-10, 16; GE 3, at 5-6; GE 6; AE D, at 1)
SOR ¶ 1.b.  refers to an incident that took place in  January 2019. At the time  of the
incident,   the  child  was  temporarily  residing   in   Applicant’s  residence  during   a  week  of
custody.  When   she  returned   from  school   one   particular   Thursday,  he  noticed  that  she
was acting strangely because she had  received a referral  at school  for  striking another
child and not listening at school. He  disciplined  her with two smacks on her bottom  with
a cloth belt  and  sent her to bed  early. He  claimed that he did not bruise her. When the
child eventually returned to her mother  on the following Monday, the mother found her to
be oddly quiet. The mother noticed a bruise on the child’s thigh and wrist. She called the
police.  The  authorities called Child Protective Services, and  the child was placed in  her
mother’s emergency protective custody. Shortly thereafter, upon learning that there was
a warrant for his arrest, he turned  himself into  the authorities. They charged him with (1)
child abuse in  the 2nd  degree –   custody; (2) child abuse in  the 2nd  degree –   house; (3)
assault  in   the  2nd   degree;  and   (4)   reckless  endangerment,   the  first  two  charges  being
felonies,  and  the  remaining  charges  both  misdemeanors.   Charges  (1)   and   (2)   were
merged into charge (2), and charges (3) and (4) were merged into charge (3)(GE 2, at 9;
GE 3,  at  5-6; GE  5,  at  2-7) In June 2019, both charges were “closed” when a Stet  notice
was issued, placing them  on an inactive  docket and  forgotten by the state. Applicant  was
required at attend  anger management, to be  completed within six  months,  and to avoid
unlawful contact with the minor child. (GE 11; GE 5, at 12-16)
SOR  ¶  1.a.  refers  to  a  series  of  alleged  violations  that  took  place  over  an
unspecified period that eventually resulted in Applicant’s arrest in March 2019. He was
charged  with  seven  violations,  all  of  which  were  misdemeanors,  such  as  violation  of
conditional release, violation of release, violation of release conditions, and failure to obey
court  order.  All  of  the  charges  were  associated  with  the  criminal  charges,  already
discussed above, for which those charges were dismissed nolle prosequi or placed on
the Stet docket.  All of these charges were placed on the Stet docket in June 2019. (GE
3, at 6-7; GE 4)
Although it was not alleged in the SOR, there was another incident between the
same two protagonists that took place in August 2020 during another custody exchange.
Applicant  reportedly  removed  his  daughter’s  watch  and  placed  it  on  the  hood  of  the
mother’s  automobile,  purportedly  scratching  the  car.  The  mother  got  out  of  the  car  to
return the watch to their daughter, but as she attempted to hand it to the child, Applicant
rolled up the window and  started  to  drive away, almost  running over the  mother’s foot.
She  managed  to  return  the  watch,  but  Applicant  took  it  and  threw  it  out  the  window.
Applicant disputed her allegations and claimed she came over to his car and kicked it,
and  then  she  reached  inside  the  window  and  hit  him  in  the  face.  (Tr.  at  31)  After  the
mother reported the incident to the police, Applicant was eventually arrested and charged
with (1) malicious destruction of property less than $1,000. (GE 10) The matter has not
yet been resolved. (GE 9)
Unalleged conduct can be considered for  certain purposes, as discussed by the
DOHA  Appeal  Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a)  to assess
an  applicant's  credibility;   (b)   to   evaluate   an  applicant's  evidence   of  extenuation,
mitigation,   or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider  whether  an  applicant  has
demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation; (d) to  decide whether a  particular provision of the
Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e)  to  provide  evidence  for  whole-person analysis
under Directive § 6.3.). See  ISCR  Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing
ISCR  Case  No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar.  15,  2004); ISCR  Case No. 00-0633 at 3
(App. Bd. Oct. 24,  2003)). See also ISCR  Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April  6, 2016)
(citing ISCR Case No.  14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR  Case No.  03-
20327  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Oct.  26,  2006)).  Applicant’s  unalleged  criminal  conduct  will  be
considered only for the five purposes listed above.
Applicant is remorseful about the situation  with the mother of  his child, and  his sole
desire  is  to  maintain  a  healthy  and   loving   relationship  with  the  child.  Because  of  the
repeated situation, he requested and  obtained mutual  protective  orders and  has altered
the location of the child  custody  exchanges away from the mother’s residence, initially
requesting  that they  take place at the police  barracks. (GE  2, at 10) In  addition, he has
attempted to  limit conversations to email.  He now  seeks  alternative ways to discipline his
daughter when discipline is necessary.  In October 2018, he successfully completed a 6-
hour Co-Parenting/Divorce Class (AE F), and he routinely participates in  family, as well
as, class activities with his daughter. (AE C; AE H)
As noted above,  there is also one  incident  that  is vastly  different from the ones
involving the mother of his child. SOR ¶ 1.d. refers to an incident that occurred during
Mardi Gras in February 2017, when Applicant got behind the wheel of his automobile after
consuming too much beer and becoming intoxicated. He was stopped by the police and
administered a breathalyzer. The reading was 0.98. He was arrested by the police and
charged with (1) operating a vehicle while intoxicated (DWI); (2) operating a vehicle with
a suspended license; and (3) procedure on approach of an authorized emergency vehicle
(similar to failure to yield the right of way), all misdemeanors. He was ordered to perform
40 hours of community service and fined $900. (GE 3, at 2; GE 2, at 9; AE A)
Additional Personal Conduct
In  addition  to  the  joint  criminal  conduct  and  personal  conduct  issues  described
above, the SOR also alleged three incidents of personal conduct, not criminal conduct,
which  raised  additional  security  clearance  issues  associated  with  his  failure  or
unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations,  thus  questioning  his  reliability,
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Those incidents
and their eventual results are as follows:
SOR ¶ 2.d. refers to an incident that reportedly took place in June 2016 when he
was  terminated  from  the  city  public  charter  school  for  failure  to  meet  performance
standards. He was initially hired in August 2013 as a substitute teacher and intern in a
specific health-care program managing approximately 40 students over three classes of
differing  content.  When  a  certified  teacher  was  hired  for  that  position,  Applicant  was
moved  into  another  internship  with  the  health  and  physical  education  teacher  in  the
middle grades. At the end of his first year at the school, his supervisor, the school principal
retired. During the second year, Applicant  was a health teacher, but his mentor was a
math teacher. Teaching on his own, he struggled because he was in over his head and
needed  help,  but  it  was  apparently  not  given  to  him.  At  the  end  of  the  year,  the  new
principal  informed  him  that  the  health  program  was  no  longer  to  be  offered  and  the
teaching  position  was  going  to  be  abolished.  Applicant  was  given  referrals  to  other
schools  looking  for  health  teachers.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  placed  on  a
performance  improvement  plan  (PIP),  but  otherwise  denied  ever  being  told  that  his
performance was substandard. The following year, rather than securing another teaching
position, he chose to seek different employment elsewhere. (GE 2, at 12-13; AE B, at 4;
Answer  to  the  SOR,  at  1,  3)  Other  than  the  fact  that  Applicant  initially  admitted  the
allegation, there is no other evidence  to contradict Applicant’s other descriptions of his
relationship with the school system or how or why that relationship ended.
SOR  ¶  2.c.  refers  to  an  incident  that  took  place  in  January  2017  when  he  was
terminated from his employment with a multinational technology company, where he had
been working in package direction, for falling asleep while on shift. At the time, he had
been  working  at  multiple  jobs,  and  on  this  one  occasion  he  fell  asleep  while  on  break
working the night shift. He was called into the office and fired. Applicant acknowledged
that he had placed himself in a position where he had taken on more than he should have,
and he pledged not to put himself in another similar situation in the future. (GE 2, at 6;
Answer to the SOR, at 3)
SOR ¶ 2.b. refers to an incident that reportedly took place in December 2017 when
he was terminated from his employment with a corporation that was sponsoring him for a
security  clearance  after  it  had  previously  been  suspended.  He  was  in  the  process  of
completing a new SF 86 and assumed that the information appearing in his original SF
86  would  be  sufficient.  However,  because  of  new  developments,  the  new  SF  86  was
incomplete. By the time the entire security clearance eligibility process was  completed
and  his  security  clearance  was  reinstated,  the  employer  no  longer  had  the  position
available for him. He denied that he was terminated. (GE 2, at 6; Answer to the SOR, at
3; Tr. at 33) There is no evidence to contradict Applicant’s description of his relationship
with the employer or how or why that relationship ended.
Character References and Work Performance
Applicant’s first city charter-school supervisor and principal, and a veteran, noted
that Applicant connected with the students in a way that many new teachers can’t, which
contributed  to  his  success  while  assigned  to  his  position.  Applicant  was  considered  a
definite  asset  to  the  school  program.  His  “can-do  attitude  for  any  task  assigned,  his
willingness to go the extra mile, and his ability to develop relationships with all students
and adults he came into contact with was a trait necessary to be successful in any course
of work. . . .” (AE B, at 4)
Applicant’s  uncle,  an  ophthalmologist  and  a  veteran,  described  Applicant  in
glowing  terms:  he  maintained  a  3.0  grade  point  average  while  he  played  football,
“demonstrating  versatility  and  a  multifocal  approach  toward  achievement”;  he  was  a
volunteer tutor for elementary, middle, and high school students; he honed critical skills
in the health profession while working in the emergency room at the shock trauma center
at  a  large  medical  center;  he  became  a  certified  educator  in  the  state;  and  he  has  a
constant will to overcome obstacles. (AE B, at 3)
A lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps has known Applicant his entire life.
He noted that Applicant leaned on his faith and family members to persevere and endure
“the fiery trials that came to him.” He “withstood the pressures that crush most young men
of his age, but he thrived . . . .” He added that Applicant is “a driven and talented young
man with outstanding moral character.” (AE B, at 1-2)
The  president  and  chief  executive  officer  of  the  state  university  medical  center
congratulated  Applicant  for  completing  ten  years  of  service  toward  the  commitment  to
improve the health of people in the community. (AE J; AE K)
Applicant’s two most recent U.S. Naval Reserve Evaluation Report and Counseling
Records reflect that he is a vital member of the unit who displays the ability for increased
responsibilities.  He  is  a  solid  and  proven  performer  who  produces  quality  work  and
approaches  each  endeavor  with  a  positive  attitude  and  without  complaint,  in  a  timely
manner ensuring his dependability. He has unlimited growth potential, and he should be
promoted early. He either meets or is above the reported performance traits. (AE G)

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e,  2.a,  3.a, 3.b,  and  3.d-3.g,  although  he  said
that SOR ¶¶ 3.e and 3.f were the same offense. He denied SOR ¶ 3.c. His admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee   of   a   defense   contractor.  He   has  never
married.  He  has  an  adult son  who  lives in another  state,  an  18-year-old daughter,  a  15-
year-old  daughter,  and   a   14-year-old  daughter.  His  three   daughters  live   with   their
mothers. Two  of  them  live  in other states. Applicant lives with  his girlfriend  and  her 10-
year-old  son.   (GE   1;   Tr.  25)   Applicant   earned   a   certification   in   1997,   an   associate’s
degree  in 2012,  and  a  bachelor’s degree  in 2015. (GE  1) He testified  that he  also has a
master’s degree. (Tr. 25, 58)
Applicant  was  employed  by  an  electronics  company  from  December  2005  to
January  2008.  He  left  the  job  to  take  a  position  in  another  state,  but  the  job  did  not
materialize.  He  was  then  unemployed  for  most  of  the  next  four  and  a  half  years.  He
spent much of this time improving his education. (GE 1; Tr. 67-69) He was employed at
a  computer  company  from  May  to  September  2013,  but  was  terminated  after  a
confrontation  with  a  coworker.  (GE  1;  Tr.  68-70  He  was  then  unemployed  again  until
May 2014, when he briefly took a job caring for seniors. He left the position because he
did not believe the employer was following regulations appropriately. (GE 1; Tr. 71-72)
Since  2017,  Applicant  has  worked  in  information  technology  for  his  current
employer and clearance sponsor. (GE 1, Tr. 72-76) On occasion, he was unemployed
between contracts. (GE 1; Tr. 61-65) He has never held a clearance. (Tr. 13) Applicant
testified that in 2019, he earned between $35,000 and $40,000. He works full time. (Tr.
65-67, 90-93)
In April 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony injury to a child. He
was  convicted  and  served  five  years  in  jail.  (SOR  ¶  3.g)(GE  1  at  43-44)  Applicant
testified that the injuries to the child included bruises and a burn mark. (Tr. 34-35)
In  September  2001,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  third-degree
larceny. (SOR ¶ 3.f) He explained that he was arrested after he attempted to steal some
items of clothing from a department store. He received a period of probation, but failed
to pay the related fine. In March 2003, he was in an auto accident. In the aftermath, he
gave a false name to the police. He was arrested for  making a false report and for the
larceny  charge,  due  to  the  unpaid  fine.  He  said  that  his  probation  was  extended  as  a
result. (GE 1 at 44-45; GE 5 at 11; Tr. 26-28, 35-37) (SOR ¶ 3.e)
In 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol (DUI) and driving with a suspended license. He was convicted and sentenced to
one  day  in  jail,  12  months  of  probation,  fined,  ordered  to  perform  community  service,
and attend DUI education. (SOR ¶ 3.d) (GE 1 at 45-46; GE 5 at 8-9)
In   January   2012,  Applicant   was  arrested   and   charged   with   felony   child   abuse.
(SOR  ¶  3.c) (GE 5  at  12; GE  1  at 38)  He denied  SOR ¶  3.c.  Applicant testified  that the
girlfriend   of  his  daughter’s  maternal  grandfather   filed   a   child-abuse   complaint  against
Applicant.   The   complainant,   he   asserted,  was  herself  wanted   for  murder  at  the   time.
Applicant  was  arrested,  as  was  his   daughter’s  mother.   Applicant  denied   that  he
committed  the  offense.  (Tr.  28-31,  37)  He  participated  in  parenting  classes. (Tr.  34, 81-
83)  He  reported   the   arrest  on   his  SCA  and   noted   that   the   charge   was  dismissed   in
September  2014.  (GE   1   at  38-39)   The   arrest  is  documented   in   Applicant’s  criminal
record, but disposition  of the charge is not. (GE 5)
In about June 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication
and  resisting  arrest,  and  cited  for  speeding  and  improper  lane  usage.  (SOR  ¶  3.b)  In
October 2013, he pleaded guilty to speeding and public intoxication and was fined. The
resisting  arrest  charge  and  the  citation  for  improper  lane  usage  were  dismissed.
Applicant testified that he was on his way home and a police car going in the opposite
direction  turned  and  followed  him.  He  pulled  into  his  apartment  complex.  When  the
police asked him to exit the vehicle, he tripped over a curb and fell down because the
parking lot was not well lit. (Tr. 37-38) (Answer to SOR; GE 1 at 39-40; Tr. 31-32) The
charges are not detailed on the exhibit documenting Applicant’s criminal record. (GE 5)
In December 2014, Applicant was charged with DUI and also cited for speeding
and improper lane usage. (SOR ¶ 3.a) Applicant admitted the fact that he was charged
but denied the conduct. He testified that he was pulled over because the police officer
observed him swerving between the lanes and  smelled  liquor  on him  during the  traffic
stop.  Applicant  denied  that  he  consumed  alcohol  that  night.  He  said  had  just  left  the
house,  and  was  “sleepy”  but  not  drunk.  (Tr.  83-85)  In  October  2016,  the  DUI  charge
was nolle prossed after Applicant attended a nine-month DUI class through a diversion
program. (GE 5 at 12; GE 1 at 41-42; Tr. 31-32, 39-40, 76-80, 94) He has not had any
subsequent arrests. (Tr. 40)
Applicant  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  weekly,  at  times  daily,
between  May  2003  and  July  2016.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  His  most  recent  use  was  after  the
sudden  death  of  a  close  friend.  He  said  this  was  shortly  before  he  participated  in  the
DUI  diversion  program.  The  timing  of  his  last  marijuana  use  is unclear.  Applicant  said
he  had  not  used  marijuana  since  July  2016.  (Tr.  43,  44)  He  later  said  this  was  some
time in 2017. (Tr. 44, 46-47) He denied using marijuana after submitting his May 2017
SCA. (Tr. 46) He acknowledged knowing that marijuana use is against state and federal
law.  He  has  attended  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  a  few  times  in  the  last  three  years.
(Tr. 40-47, 94-98)
Applicant’s background investigation also included credit reports from July 2017,
May 2018, and March 2019. Applicant had five delinquent accounts,  the largest by far
being  SOR  ¶  1.a,  concerning  a  $121,692  child  support  arrearage.  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a
charged-off student loan account for $8,293. SOR ¶ 1.c is another charged-off account
for  $1,755.  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  ($250)  and  1.e  ($76)  are  two  past-due  medical  accounts.
Applicant disclosed his debts on his SCA. (GE 1)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.a,  Applicant  testified  that  he  fell  behind  on  his  child-support
payments  during  his  periods  of  unemployment.  This  began  with  a  layoff  in  2009.  He
also acknowledged working odd jobs, but said that none of that income went to arrears
or child support. (Tr. 85-90) Applicant testified that his child support went into arrears in
about 2012. (Tr. 100)
Applicant testified that he is currently paying on his child support and has money
taken out of his paycheck regularly. He said the arrearage amount was incurred during
his  various  periods  of  unemployment.  The  child  support  concerns  his  two  younger
children,  one  of  whom  lives  in  his  home  state  and  one  of  whom  is  in  another  state.
Applicant  said  he  is  paying  between  $500  and  $600  in  child  support  monthly  for  one
child,  and  about  $425  for  another  child.  Applicant  does  not  believe  that  his  monthly
payments  address  the  amount  in  arrears.  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  of
the current status of his child-support payments. (Tr. 47-54, 99-104)
Applicant asserted that his student loan (SOR ¶ 1.b) is in deferment. He  said he
has  other  student  loans,  which  are  also  deferred.  (Tr.  54-55,  58-61)  Applicant  did  not
provide documentation of the current status of his past-due student loan. The past-due
debt at SOR ¶ 1.c is also unresolved. (Tr. 105)
Applicant asserted that the two medical debts alleged (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e) are
co-payments from medical procedures. He believes they should have been covered by
insurance. (Tr. 55-56) They remain unresolved.
",True
"The  SOR alleges under Guideline  D that in August 2017, Applicant was charged
with  public indecency and  received five  years’  probation  (SOR ¶  1.a);  and that in  August
2018,  he  was charged  with  1st  degree  felony  rape  and  3rd  degree  gross sex  imposition
(SOR ¶  1.b). The  same  conduct  is cross-alleged  under Guideline  J. In  Applicant’s  answer
to   the   SOR,   he   admitted   all   the   allegations,   with   explanations.   His   admissions   in   his
answer and  at the  hearing  are incorporated in  my findings of  fact.
Applicant is a 38-year-old systems administrator employed by federal contractors
since  March  2006.  He  graduated  from  college  with  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer
engineering  in  December  2005.  He  married  in  September  2008  and  divorced  in  May
2018.  He  has  an  11-year-old  son  and  a  9-year-old  daughter.  He  received  a  security
clearance in March 2006, which was suspended in February 2019. He started working for
another federal contractor in April 2019, but his continued employment is dependent on
reinstatement of his security clearance. (Tr. 23.)
In  June  2016,  Applicant’s  wife  accused  him  of  inappropriately  touching  their
children at night. The children routinely awakened during the night and crawled into their
parents’ bed. Applicant’s wife claimed that she rolled over during the night to put her arm
around  Applicant  when  she  saw  their  son  in  their  bed  with  his  pants  pulled  down,  his
hands near Applicant’s genitals, and both of them facing each other. She did not say or
do anything except to roll over and go back to sleep. She claimed that a week later she
saw their daughter in their bed with her pants pulled down. (Tr. 26-27.) His wife set up a
camera  in  the  bedroom  to  record  Applicant’s  activity  during  the  night,  but  it  revealed
nothing. In July 2016, she took the children to a hospital for forensic testing, and a forensic
interviewer questioned them, but the children did not describe any inappropriate touching.
During  the  forensic  interviews,  the  children  described  a  family  situation  with  much
hugging, snuggling, and cuddling. The only complaint was from the son, who said that
Applicant sometimes squeezed him too hard. (GX 5 at 17-27.)
Applicant’s wife and their two children moved out of the house and stayed with her
brother. She told Applicant that she would not return until he obtained treatment for his
“sexual issues.” (Tr. 28.) Applicant’s wife scheduled a polygraph examination for him and
told  him  that  there  would  be  “no  fixing”  of  their  marriage  if  he  refused  to  take  the
polygraph.
On  September  2,  2016,  Applicant  underwent  the  polygraph  examination,  which
was administered by a private polygraph examiner hired by Applicant’s wife. During the
examination, Applicant answered “No” to three questions: (1) Did you ever have any type
of sexual contact with [your daughter]? (2) Other than what you told me, did you have any
type of sexual contact with [your son]? and (3) Did you ever have your children touch your
naked penis? The examiner found no deception indicated and opined that Applicant was
being truthful in answering the three questions. (GX 2 at 27-28.) On September 9, 2016,
the  county  children’s services office informed  Applicant that the reported sexual abuse
was unsubstantiated. (AX D(1).)
Two  certified  police  polygraph  examiners  concluded
the  polygraph
examination  was  invalid.  The  police  examiners  concluded  that  it  was  inappropriate  for
Applicant’s wife  to  be  in the  room  while  the  examination  was conducted,  the  questions
were not sufficiently specific, the terminology (“sexual contact”) was too broad, and three
relevant questions were asked during the examination instead of the accepted practice
of asking only one relevant question. (GX 3 at 13.)
that
As a result of the accusations by Applicant’s wife, they separated for a few months
and attended a few sessions of marital counseling. In October 2016, Applicant’s wife filed
for  divorce,  on  the  ground  that  Applicant  had  been  guilty  of  gross  neglect  of  duty  and
extreme cruelty and that the parties were incompatible. (AX E at 1.)
In November 2016, Applicant’s wife sought temporary custody of their children and
asked that Applicant’s parenting time with  the  children  be  supervised. Her request was
granted.  (AX  E  at  4-7,  13-14.)  Later  in  November  2016,  Applicant  and  his  wife  were
ordered  to  under  psychological  evaluation  “for  purposes  of  assisting  the  Court  in
determining the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities.” (AX E at 11-12.)
Applicant  admitted
that  he  sometimes  experienced
spontaneous erections without thinking about sex, and that on one occasion his wife had
observed him cuddling their son in bed while having an erection. He believed that his wife
concluded from this event that he had a sexual disorder. (GX D(3) at 4.)
the  psychologist
to
The  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant  “had  no  apparent  and  diagnosable
disorder,  but  showed  symptoms  of  dependent  personality  traits,  with  obsessive-
compulsive  and  avoidant  features”;  that  he  “presented  a  personal  history  and  mental
health profile that made [his wife’s] allegations against him at least circumstantially  and
situationally  feasible”;  and  that  he  displayed  a  more  passive,  laissez  faire  interaction
pattern  with  the  children,  as  well  as  engaged  in  frequent  age-inappropriate  coddling,
cuddling, and infantilizing interchanges with them.”
The  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant’s  wife  “showed  symptoms  of  a
situational  and  transient  adjustment  disorder  with  anxiety  and  depression,  as  well  as
evidence of obsessive-compulsive personality traits, with narcissistic (manifested as low
self-esteem) and histrionic (i.e., overly dramatic and emotional tendencies features”; that
“there  was  no  definitive  psychological  data  clearly  suggestive  or  confirmatory  of  [her]
allegations against [Applicant]”; that she “displayed candor and openness, consistent with
a personal history and mental health profile that make her allegations credible”; and that
she  “has  historically  been  the  children’s  primary  caregiver,  is  and  has  been  more
accessible to them, and displayed more age-appropriate nurturing.”
Based  on  her conclusions, the  psychologist recommended  that Applicant’s wife
retain residential and custodial parent status of their two children. The psychologist also
recommended that Applicant—
[S]ubmit to and participate in mental health counseling or therapy to more
definitively rule out the likelihood of his impropriety toward the children, as
well as to work toward the normalization and re-unification of his parental
relationship with them, to minimize any cloud of ongoing suspicion, and to
preclude the likelihood of ongoing legal charges and counter-charges.
(AX D(3) at 26.)
On November 10, 2016, Applicant’s wife enrolled the two children in a counseling
program and informed a counselor that she had observed Applicant in bed with their son
with their son’s hands in Applicant’s pants. In January 2017, while  the  children  were in
play therapy, their son drew pictures of trees that appeared to have penises, and their
daughter  drew  picture  of  a  rainbow  with  the  family  inside  and  her  on  the  outside.  In
February  2017,  Applicant’s  wife  told  the  counselor  that  the  children  previously  had
episodes of bed-wetting and had reverted to it. On April 2017, Applicant’s wife asked for
an  “emergency  visit,”  and  told  the  counselor  that  their  daughter  had  reported  that
Applicant had touched her vagina. (GX 2 at 31; AX D(4).
Applicant’s  daughter  was  interviewed  by  a  psychologist,  who  reported  that  his
daughter said, “my mommy wanted me to tell you something.” (GX 2 at 11.) His daughter
told  a  forensic  interviewer  that  Applicant  pulled  down  her  pants  and  underwear  and
pressed on her vagina with one finger to “take out the dirty stuff.” (GX 5 at 11.) On July 3,
2017, the county children’s services office notified Applicant that the allegation of sexual
abuse was “indicated.” (AX D(5).) Appellant was charged with felony rape.
Before the  charges were presented  to  a  grand  jury, Applicant received  a  letter from
the   county   children’s  services  office,  recommending   that  he   have   no   contact  with   his
children   until  he   completed   a   sex-offender  assessment.   In   September  2017,  Applicant
underwent an  evaluation  of  his psychological and  sexual health, conducted  by  a  clinical
psychologist and  sex  offender specialist.  The  psychologist concluded  that Applicant is not
a pedophile. (GX 2  at 30-34.)
In  June  2018,  pursuant  to  a  plea  agreement,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  public
indecency by masturbating in the presence of others. (GX 4 at 5.) The factual predicate
for his guilty plea is not clearly stated in the court record, but Applicant believed that he
was pleading guilty to masturbating in the presence of his children. (Tr. 73.) However, the
bill of information on which the charge was based alleged that his masturbation was “likely
to be viewed and affront others who were in the person’s physical proximity and who were
not members of the offender’s family.” (GX 4 at 5; Tr. 74.)
In July 2018, before Applicant was sentenced, his son told a counselor that, during
some  time  in  2015  or  2016,  Applicant  had  touched  his  anus  and  penis.  The  county
children’s services  office  arranged  for a  forensic interview,  which  occurred  on  July 26,
2018. According to the forensic interviewer,  Applicant’s son, who  was then  eight years
old,  said that  Applicant  touched his penis during the  night,  that Applicant  was  wearing
blue  latex  gloves,  and  that  he  felt  a  substance  squirting  on  his  back  that  felt  like
mayonnaise or sunscreen. His son also said that Applicant inserted a finger into his anus
and moved it around. (GX 5 at 11.)
In July 2018, Applicant was sentenced for the public indecency to which he had
pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to incarceration for 60 days, to be served on weekends,
and supervised probation for five years. He was prohibited from having any contact with
his children for five years. (GX 4 at 15.)
In August 2018, Applicant was charged with rape, a felony of the first degree, and
gross sexual imposition, a felony of the third degree. These charges were based on his
son’s statements to a psychiatrist and a forensic interview in July 2018. (GX 3 at 5-6.)
In  October  2018,  Applicant’s  wife  was  persuaded  by  a  police  officer  to  ask
Applicant to take a second polygraph examination. It would be a stipulated examination,
with an agreement that the charges would be dismissed if he passed the examination and
that he would agree to admissibility of the exam results if he failed. After consulting with
his attorney, Applicant declined to take a stipulated polygraph examination. His attorney
advised against a second polygraph because he already had favorable results from the
first examination and it would be inadvisable to risk an unfavorable result from a second
examination.
In  April  2019,  the  prosecutor  concluded  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to
prove the offenses involving Applicant’s son beyond a reasonable doubt. (GX 5 at 15-16.)
The charges were dismissed without prejudice. (GX 4 at 26.)
Applicant  and his  wife were  divorced  in  May 2018, and his ex-wife  remarried  in
May 2019. The children live with his ex-wife. (Tr. 47.)
Applicant’s senior director of operations for his former employer submitted a letter
stating  that  his  performance  was  excellent  and  he  was  well-regarded  by  his  project
manager, the project staff, and their customer. The sole reason for his termination was
the suspension of his security clearance. (GX 2 at 35.)
Applicant’s most recent performance review reflects solid performance, frequently
exceeding expectations. He has maintained a positive attitude in spite of the uncertainty
about his security clearance. (AX B.)
Four  long-time  friends  who  have  known  Applicant  since  high  school  submitted
letters attesting to his kind and generous character, devotion to his family, and hard work.
They strongly believe that the accusations against him were false. (GX 2 at 36-40.) One
of  these  friends  is  a  cybersecurity  analyst  for  a  federal  law  enforcement  agency.  She
submitted a statement at the hearing stating:
I  do   not  question   [Applicant’s]  character  in  any   respect,   but  certainly
question  the  validity  of  the  claims  made  against him.  I know  [Applicant]  was
in  a   horrible   position   facing   false  charges  related   to   his  child   and   upon
advice  of   his  attorney,   he   chose   to   accept  the   plea   agreement  that  was
offered.  I  am   confident  that  [Applicant]   at  no   time   committed   any
inappropriate  act  with  his children.
(AX C(2).)
A friend  who  works in  federal law enforcement  and has  known  Applicant for 18
years  submitted  a  letter  describing  him  as  candid,  honest,  and  genuine.  This  friend  is
familiar with the allegations in the SOR and believes Applicant’s denial of the allegations
of sexual abuse. He believes that Applicant’s guilty plea to a misdemeanor was ill-advised
and  a  demonstration  of  the  prosecution’s  weak  case.  He  ended  his  letter  by  saying,
“[Applicant] is a good man, and [a] trustworthy man, who was manipulated by his former
wife.” (AX C(1).)
Numerous  other  friends,  co-workers,  employers,  and   supervisors,  who   have
known   Applicant  for  many   years,  submitted   letters attesting   to   his good   character and
opining  that  he  has been  the  victim  of  false  charges and  a  difficult decision  to  plead  guilty
to  a  misdemeanor  to  avoid risk of  a  felony  conviction  and  a  long  prison  term.  (AX  C(3)-
AX C(8).)
Applicant is currently in a serious relationship with  a woman who is a registered
nurse and mother of two daughters. She attended the hearing. They first began dating in
February 2017, and Applicant disclosed the accusations against him after two months of
dating. Applicant spends much time with her daughters, and “[t]hey love him dearly!” She
is familiar with the allegations against him. She believes that Applicant is a victim of false
allegations and bad legal advice. (AX C(9).)
",False
"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old.  In June 2003, he received a high  school diploma.  He
married in December 2003. His wife left him in 2017 and their divorce was concluded in
2018. They have two teenage children.  Applicant presently lives with a cohabitant  and
her daughter. (Tr. at 15-16, 26-27.)
Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2007. He deployed on two occasions to war
zones  and  served  as  an  Explosives  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD)  Tech.  In  May  2017,
however, he  was  discharged  with  an Other than Honorable  characterization  of  service
(OTH) in lieu of Trial by Court-Martial. He had previously been convicted in  a General
Court-Martial. His conviction was overturned on appeal, all of which is described further
below. (Tr. at 19-28; AE A-C.)
After his discharge, Applicant worked as a security guard. Starting in August 2017,
he took some classes at a technical training school. In January 2018, he began working
for his security clearance sponsor as a technician. (Tr. at 27.)
Criminal Conduct and Sexual Behavior
The SOR alleges criminal sexual misconduct by Applicant at a birthday party of a
family  friend  on  January  4-5,  2014.  Certain  events  leading  up  to  this  incident  provide
important background information and context.
In 2011-2012, Applicant deployed to a war zone. During a layover on his return in
October 2012, he and his fellow soldiers were given a direct order not to drink any alcohol.
Applicant, who was a sergeant (E-5) at that time, nevertheless joined a group of more
senior non-commissioned officers at a party on October 4, 2012, where he and the others
drank alcohol. Applicant testified at the DOHA hearing that he only had one drink.  His
violation  of  the  order  was  reported.  In  January  2013,  he  received  an  Article  15  Non-
Judicial Punishment for violating Articles 90 and 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ) (disobedience of a direct order). His punishment included counseling and 45 days
of extra duty. (Tr. at 12, 16, 29-32; GE 6.)
The  Consolidated  Adjudications  Facility,  Army  Division,  (CAF)  adjudicated
whether  Applicant’s  misconduct  warranted  suspension  of  his  top  secret  clearance
eligibility  and  access  to  sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI).  On  November  7,
2013, the CAF reaffirmed Applicant’s eligibility and  SCI access. The CAF also issued a
“Warning  Notice”  to  Applicant  stating  that  a  “subsequent  alcohol-related  incident  may
result in  the  suspension  of your security  clearance.”  Applicant acknowledged receiving
the warning. (Tr. at 47; GE 6 at 1.)
Less than two months after this warning, Applicant was arrested for sexual assault
at the end of a long evening of heavy alcohol drinking at the above-mentioned January 4,
2014 birthday party. On May 8, 2014, charges were preferred against Applicant consisting
of two specifications in violation of Article 120 of the UCMJ – rape, sexual assault, and
other sexual misconduct. (GE 4 at 2.)
The record at Applicant’s General Court-Martial, as summarized by the appellate
court in its decision, sets forth a narrative of the events of that evening that sharply differs
from  Applicant’s  version  presented  at  his  DOHA  hearing.  The  record  reflects  that
Applicant,  his  then-wife,  and  their  children  attended  the  birthday  party  of  the  wife  of
another sergeant (SGT) at SGT’s home. One other couple attended the party. SGT’s wife
(W) celebrated her birthday by drinking heavily,  starting in  the morning and  continuing
throughout  the  afternoon  and  late  into  the  evening.  The  spouse  of  the  third  couple
assisted W  to her bedroom after W had vomited. She covered W  with a blanket in her
bed, and W fell asleep. She was wearing leggings and a long shirt. (GE 4 at 2.)
Applicant’s wife and children retired to a second bedroom in SGT’s house and had
fallen asleep. Late in the evening, SGT fell asleep or passed out on a sofa in his living
room after drinking an excessive amount of alcohol. The third couple decided to leave the
party. The husband of the third couple, also an Army NCO, slapped SGT in the face trying
to wake him to say goodnight. He was unable to wake SGT. He and his wife then left the
party, leaving Applicant alone, W asleep in her bedroom, and her husband passed out on
the living room sofa. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant did not materially dispute the above
statement of the facts. (Tr. at 13-45; GE 4 at 2.)
W testified at the Court-Martial that she felt someone climb into her bed behind her
and  start touching  her body.  She  thought  it was  her  husband. The  person  then  pulled
down  her  leggings  and  underwear  and  penetrated  her  vagina  with  his  fingers.  At  that
point, she was awake enough to realize that the person in her bed was not her husband.
She testified that she looked behind her and saw Applicant. She ran from her bedroom
into the living room with her pants pulled down and unsuccessfully tried to wake up her
husband. Applicant followed W into her living room, pushed her down onto a second sofa,
and again inserted his fingers into her vagina. SGT then woke up, and Applicant retreated
to another part of the house. (GE 4 at 2.)
A  forensic  biology  expert  testified  that  Applicant’s  left  hand  contained  a  large
amount of W’s DNA. The expert opined that W’s DNA was “more than likely or a possibility
of being from a biological fluid.” The expert also did not rule the possibility that the DNA
on Applicant’s left hand could have come from a “heavy touch” of W and suggested that
a handshake could possibly produce the transfer of DNA from one person to another. (GE
4 at 2.)
At the DOHA hearing, Applicant testified about the events of that evening. He said
that he and his family arrived at the party at about 5 pm. He had started drinking alcohol
at his home and continued to drink “heavily” the rest of the night, consuming beer, tequila,
and vodka. Applicant admitted that he was an alcoholic at that time.  Applicant testified
that he had “a really good relationship with the [SGT].” They worked together and trained
together.  Applicant  knew  SGT  for  about  a  year  and  knew  W  just  as  long.  Applicant
described W  as “flirtatious,” “real vulgar and real flirtatious with  most people,” including
Applicant. At the DOHA hearing, he described SGT and W as “questionable characters.”
(Tr. 37-40.)
Applicant testified further that his spouse and children left the others at the party
and went to a bedroom in W’s house to watch TV. He was unaware of her “status,” i.e.,
whether she then slept or stayed awake. He denied knowing that W had gone to bed. He
testified  that  SGT  was  passed  out  on  his  living  room  sofa.  Applicant  was  alone  and
intoxicated in the residence, but he was awake. He  denied entering W’s bedroom and
sexually  assaulting  her.  He  also  denied  sexually  assaulting  her  in  her  living  room.  He
could not recall where he was at the time of the alleged incidents. He did not see her run
into the living room with her pants pulled down. Applicant testified that he spent his time
late that evening sitting at the table in the dining room, which was part of the living room,
playing music on his phone. Then, SGT was suddenly yelling at him and assaulted him
causing bruising and injuries. He has no idea why SGT thought Applicant had assaulted
his wife, though he later admitted in his testimony that he understood that SGT’s actions
were based on what W told her husband about Applicant’s actions. He never heard W try
to wake up her husband. He testified that he has no idea why she made the accusations
against him. He also has no idea why his left hand had W’s DNA on it. Applicant’s only
explanation for what happened that night was that he “put himself in a bad situation with
questionable characters.” (Tr. at 13-45.)
Investigation  Command  conducted  an
The official records presented at the DOHA hearing reflect that the military police
were called, and they arrested Applicant based upon W’s accusations. The U.S. Army
Criminal
investigators
concluded  that there was  probable  cause to  believe  that  Applicant  had  engaged  in an
unlawful sexual act with W while she was impaired and incapable of apprising the sexual
act due to the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The Trial Counsel in the Office of the
Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) concurred, concluding that probable cause existed to believe
that Applicant committed the offense of Sexual Assault in violation of Article 120 of the
UCMJ. (Tr. at 23; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 2, 5.)
investigation.  The
The  General  Court-Martial  began  on  November  4,  2014.  Applicant  pleaded  not
guilty to two specifications of Sexual Assault and did not testify. On November 5, 2014,
the members found Applicant guilty on both specifications and  sentenced him to serve
six  years  in  prison  and  to  be  dishonorably  discharged  from  the  Army.  He  was  also
sentenced to be reduced to the grade of  E-1 and to forfeit all pay and allowances.  On
September 1, 2015, the convening authority reduced Applicant’s sentence  to four years
and upheld the remaining sentence. (GE 9.)
Applicant  appealed  his  conviction.  On  January  30,  2017,  the  Army  Court  of
Criminal Appeals overturned the conviction. The Court ruled that the military judge gave
an  erroneous jury instruction  regarding  Applicant’s propensity to  commit acts  of  sexual
misconduct  based  upon  the  allegations  in  the  other  specification  in  the  charges.  The
Court authorized a rehearing. (GE 4 at 3-4.)
On  March  20,  2017,  Applicant  requested  a  discharge  in  lieu  of  Trial  by  Court-
Martial (Request) pursuant to Army Regulation 635-200, Chapter 10. On March 27, 2017,
W submitted through her special victim counsel a memorandum in which she declined to
participate in any further court-martial proceedings, rendering a retrial unfeasible. At that
point, Applicant had served two and one-half years in prison. If convicted again on retrial,
he  could  only  be  sentenced  to  the  remainder  of  his  original  sentence.  The  SJA
recommended on April 11, 2017, that Applicant’s Request be granted with an Other than
Honorable characterization of service. The Commanding General approved the Request
on April 21, 2017. Applicant’s DD214 reflects that his discharge from the Army on May 9,
2017,  was  “In  Lieu  Of  Trial  by  Court-Martial”  and  was  “Under  Other  Than  Honorable
Conditions.” (Tr. at 13, AE A–C.)
In  2016,  while  Applicant  was  incarcerated,  his  wife  left  him  for  another  man.
Applicant testified at the DOHA hearing that she did not want to be with him because he
could not provide for her due to his incarceration. His children now treat him differently.
He feels that he has lost everything by making the mistake of being around people who
drank excessively and just wanted to party. He no longer drinks to excess and only drinks
on special occasions. While incarcerated, he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings
and received help for his alcoholism, though he stopped attending meetings in July 2017,
about two months after his discharge. He also mentioned in his DOHA testimony that he
was currently taking PTSD medication. He said that he abused alcohol in 2013-2014 to
cope with his post-deployment issues. (Tr. at 14-15, 22, 27-28, 42-43, 47, 49-50.)
Credibility
At the DOHA hearing, Applicant’s denial of any sexual misconduct in January 2014
rested on his credibility with the support of his character references, discussed below. In
addition  to  a  general  demeanor  assessment,  Applicant’s  credibility  was  tested  by
questions and his testimony regarding a material omission in his 2018 SCA. He provided
a negative response to the initial question in Section 25, which is titled Investigations and
Clearance Record. The question asks:
Has  the  U.S.  Government  (or  a  foreign  government)  EVER  investigated
your background and/or granted you a security clearance eligibility/access?
(Emphasis in the original.)
Applicant was, in fact, investigated and granted a security clearance in 2007 at the time
he  enlisted  or  soon  thereafter.  At  the  time  of  his  NJP  in  2012,  he  held  a  top  secret
clearance and had been granted access to SCI, which required at least one and perhaps
two further investigations. As noted above, the CAF issued a Warning Notice to Applicant.
The notice advised him that any additional alcohol-related misconduct could result in the
suspension of his clearance and SCI access. Applicant testified that as an EOD Tech he
was required to have both a clearance and access. (Tr. at 32-35.)
When  Applicant  was  asked  why  he  provided  an  incorrect  answer  to  the  simple
question quoted above, he could not provide a response. He testified: “I don’t understand
why I would write that.” When asked if he intentionally omitted information about his past
investigations  and  clearance  status  to  shield  himself  during  his  2018  background
investigation from further inquiry about his 2013 NJP and the CAF’s Warning Notice, he
denied  any  such  intent.  He  could  not  explain  why  he  did  not  understand  the  simple
language of the question in Section 25 of his SCA quote above and why he responded
incorrectly. (Tr. at 32-35.)
Applicant’s  credibility  was  also  tested  by  his  testimony  at  the  DOHA  hearing
regarding  a  critical  element  in  his  Chapter  10  Request  for  discharge.  Under  Army
Regulation 635-200 ¶ 10-2.e, a soldier requesting a discharge must acknowledge in his
request that he understands the elements of the offense he is charged with committing
and that he is guilty of the charge or a lesser included offense.  In his testimony at the
DOHA  hearing,  Applicant  made  no  mention  of  having  admitted  his  guilt  to  the  sexual
assault  in  the  Request  nor  did  he  submit  a  copy  of  the  Request.  He  testified  that  he
admitted in his Request to drinking to excess, though he was not charged with that as a
crime. The only documentation he provided was the approvals of his Request by the SJA
and the convening authority and his DD214. (AE A-C.)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s DD214 reflects that he was awarded numerous medals and ribbons for
his service in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was trained in explosive ordnance disposal, and
at the time of the sexual assault incident, he served in an EOD unit performing extremely
dangerous work to protect others. (AE C.)
After the hearing, Applicant submitted three personal reference letters. His former
first-line supervisor/team leader in the Army provided a passionate defense of Applicant’s
behavior,  both  his  behavior  in  the  incident  preceding  the  NJP  and  with  respect  to  the
sexual assault charges. He believes that Applicant was pressured to drink alcohol by his
platoon commander upon his return from deployment. The former supervisor wrote that
he  testified  at  the  NJP  in  support  of  Applicant.  He  also  believes  Applicant’s  claims  of
innocence on the sexual assault accusations. He pointed to the fact that the Army did not
retry the case following the appeal  and argued that, in his view, this demonstrates the
weakness in the Army’s case against Applicant. He also wrote that he knows Applicant’s
“moral compass” and does not believe he would ever commit the sexual assault of which
he is accused. He described Applicant as a “model, trustworthy individual.” (AE D.)
Applicant’s two other references are his direct supervisor and his manager at his
current  employer.  Both  references  endorsed  Applicant’s  integrity,  character,  and
competence in performing his duties safely. His direct supervisor noted that Applicant has
held clearances throughout his Army and post-discharge employment and has never had
a  security  violation.  The  supervisor  also  described  Applicant  as  open  and  honest.  He
argued  that  Applicant’s  Court-Martial  was  not  fair  because  the  Army’s  criminal  justice
system presumes guilt in sexual assault cases, an argument that Applicant also made at
the DOHA hearing. (Tr. at 14, 28; AE E, F.)

"Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  training  content  developer  for  a  defense  contractor,
employed  since January 2019. He was unemployed from  December 2017 to February
2018; May 2018 to June 2018; and November 2018 until January 2019. (GE 5) Applicant
received an associate’s degree in 1993 and a bachelor’s degree in 1997. He is unmarried,

The SOR alleges under Guideline J that Applicant pleaded guilty in January 2002
to  two  counts  of  felony  grand  theft.  He  was  sentenced  to  270  days’  confinement,  five
years’ probation, and ordered to pay $142,868 in restitution in monthly payments of $400
until  paid  in  full.  Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleges  Applicant  still  owes  $91,155  in
restitution after failing to pay monthly payments as required. He is also alleged to have
failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and
2018 when due. Additionally, Applicant owes $16,129 in unpaid taxes for tax year 2018.
The status of his 2016 income tax returns is unknown. Applicant admitted the Guideline
J allegation and denied the Guideline F allegations, with explanations. (Ans., GE 3)
Applicant and a partner operated a finance company that provided business loans.
Applicant claimed in his SF 86 that his business partner committed fraudulent activities,
and  that  Applicant  was  “coerced  and  ended  up  being  responsible  for  his  [partner’s]
actions, as a  partner of  the  business.” (GE 4) In  2001, Applicant and  his partner were
charged  in  a felony complaint  with  five  counts  of  grand  theft,  and  two  special  charges
alleging Applicant and his partner intended to take over $250,000 in property. Applicant
was convicted of two counts of felony grand theft and, inter alia, confinement, probation,
and fined $142,868 to be paid to the court as restitution. He completed probation and the
sentence to confinement. As of January 2020, Applicant paid only $24,029 toward this
debt with a balance due of $91,155. He failed to make any voluntary payments between
2007 and January 2020. As of January 2020, the court forwarded the balance due to an
external collection agency. (GE 7)
In response to an interview by a government investigator in April 2019, Applicant
claimed that his business partner asked him to write a check for $100,000. The check
was not backed with sufficient funds. Applicant could not recall to whom the check was
written or for what purpose, and why he was asked to write it. He was unable to explain
his business and the circumstances that led to him writing the bad check. He claimed that
he did not know the check would bounce, and that he felt pressured by his partner to write
the check. He incorrectly asserted that he was charged with one count of felony fraud. In
response to a series of questions from the investigator regarding the incident, Applicant
stated:
Q. You don’t know whom  the restitution was paid to?
A. I don’t.
Q.  Was restitution  paid in  full?
A. I don’t think so.
Q. Do you still owe restitution?
A. Yes, I am not sure how much.
Q. Are you  actively paying  restitution?

A. $300  or $400  a  month.
Q. You don’t know why you stopped paying restitution?
A. I don’t know.
Q.  When did you  make your last payments?
A. I don’t remember.
Q.  Did your business partner threaten you to  write the check?
A. Not sure about threatened, but pressured  me  a lot, tell  me  to write it, write it.
Q. How long has it been since your last payment?
A. I know it was back in California  but I don’t remember.

In  his  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  noted  that  he  restarted  restitution
payments in January 2020, and has been paying $300 per month through January 2021.

During the interview, Applicant also admitted to failing to file or pay Federal and
state income taxes when required, including for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and he had
not begun his 2018 tax returns. Applicant noted that he was unable to file because he
could not locate documents after a move, but that he was seeking the documents and
attempting to retain a new accountant to assist him. (GE 5)
In response to Government interrogatories, Applicant stated that he filed his 2016
and 2017 Federal and state tax returns but not his 2015 return. (GE 5) According to his

"Applicant  admitted  all  allegations  in  the  SOR  without  explanation.  He  did  not
address  the  paragraphs  (¶¶  2.e,  2.i,  2.m,  2.o,  and  4.b)  that  cross-alleged  conduct
alleged  under  other  guidelines,  but  since  the  underlying  allegations  were  admitted,  I
consider  the  cross-allegations  admitted  as  well.  The  admissions  are  incorporated  into
the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  was  born  in October 1990.  He  is 30  years  old.  He  has  never married
and  he  has  no  children.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  spring  2008.  He  started
college that fall and earned a bachelor’s degree in 2014. He has worked for his current
employer and  clearance  sponsor, a  large  defense  contractor,  since  April 2017.  During
most  of   the   time   since   he   graduated   from   college,  Applicant  worked   for  other
contractors at  the  same  location,  with  some  gaps in employment when  contracts ended.
(Item  3)
Guidelines J &  G:
During   Applicant’s  time   in  college,  he   incurred   multiple   infractions,   allegedly   for
alcohol-related   conduct,  resulting   in  discipline   from   university   authorities.   He  also
incurred  multiple  alcohol-related  arrests  both  during and after his time in college.
The   first  infraction   was  in  October  2008,   after  Applicant   and   his  college
roommate   were  allegedly   playing   a   drinking   game   in  their   dorm   room.  Applicant
explained  in  his  background  interview  that they  had  been  playing  the  game  with  water,
and  not  with  beer.  Nevertheless,  he  was ordered  to  participate  in  an  alcohol-awareness
class,  which  he   did.   (Item   4   at  2-3)  The   university   registrar’s   office  recorded   an
infraction   for  possession   of  “alcohol  paraphernalia”  for  which  Applicant   was  found
“responsible,”  and   that  he   completed   an   “educational  paper”   as  a   sanction.  (Item   8)
(SOR ¶ 2.b)
On  three  additional occasions over the  next  two  years (March 2009, September
2010, and  November 2010), Applicant engaged  in  drinking  in  his dorm  room. (Item  4  at
3)  These   instances  violated   university   policy   prohibiting   underage   drinking.  He  was
ultimately  placed  on  disciplinary  probation  and  removed  from  student housing. (Item  8)
(SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.d, and  2.f)
In   September  2010,  also  while   underage,  Applicant  was  driving   home   after  a
night  out  drinking   with   friends   when   he   was  pulled   over for   speeding.  He  was  given   a
breathalyzer   and   registered   a   0.07   blood   alcohol content  (BAC).  He  was  arrested   and
charged   with   a   misdemeanor offense   of   having   an   unlawful blood   alcohol level (under
21)  of  0.05   or  higher,  while   operating   a   motor  vehicle.  He   pleaded   no   contest  in
December 2010, and  he  was ordered  to  attend  alcohol  counseling  and  a  DUI  program.
His driver’s license  was also  suspended  for a  month. (Item  3  at 39-40; Item  4  at 6)(SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 2.e)
Applicant reported on his SCA that he attended alcohol counseling, with Ms. W,
from  January  to  April  2011,  and  noted  that  it  was  court  ordered.  (Item  4  at  46)  In  his
PSI, he generally referenced his counseling with Ms. W, and noted that she had advised
him  to  abstain  from  alcohol.  (Item  4  at  7)  SOR  ¶  2.g,  which  Applicant  admitted,  also
alleges  that  he  was  diagnosed  at  the  time  with  alcohol  abuse.  Notwithstanding  the
admission,  there  is  no  documented  record  evidence  of  either  the  diagnosis  or  the
treatment in 2011.
On or about September 8, 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving
under  the  influence  (DUI)  with  a  0.14  BAC.  He  reported  in  his  PSI  that  he  and  his
girlfriend had a disagreement in a campus parking lot because they had to move the car
to another lot, and Applicant had been drinking and did not want to drive. (Item 4 at 3)
University police came to the scene and detained him before turning him over to county
police. He spent the night in jail. (Item 4 at 10) Applicant went to court in March 2013,
and entered a no contest plea to the DUI charge. He was convicted, ordered to attend
alcohol  treatment,  a  DUI  program,  and  a  victim-impact  panel,  and  his  driver’s  license
was suspended for a year. (Item 3 at 41-42; Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at 8; Item 7)(SOR ¶¶
1.b, 2.i)
In  addition  to  the  criminal sanctions  resulting  from  this event,  Applicant was  also
found   responsible   by   university   authorities   for  violating   university   policy   regarding
individuals under the  age  of  21  concerning  possession  and/or consumption  of  alcohol,
among   other university   policy   violations  regarding   student  conduct.   University   records,
as  reviewed   by   an   employee   of   the   registrar’s  office,  indicate   that  he   received
disciplinary   probation,   participated   in  a   counseling   assessment,   and   completed   court
sanctions. (Item  8 at 2) (SOR ¶ 2.h)
SOR ¶  2.j, which is also  based  on  review  of  university  records,  alleges that on  or
about  September   17,  2012,  Applicant  was  found   responsible,  sanctioned,  and
suspended   for  non-compliance   with   an   official  request,   complicity   in  violating   the
student code of  conduct,  disruptive  conduct, and hazing. (Item  8) SOR ¶  2.j also alleges
that  Applicant  “had  consumed  alcohol prior to  this  offense.” This  “offense”  is not detailed
anywhere in the  record, even  in Applicant’s PSI,  unless  it is already  covered  in SOR ¶
2.i. (Item  4  at  3)  Notwithstanding  Applicant’s admission  to  SOR ¶  2.j, it is  unclear what
“conduct” or “offense” is addressed  in  the  allegation, and  the details of  the  sanctions  are
undocumented.
Applicant reported on his SCA that he attended additional court-ordered alcohol
counseling  with  Ms.  W  from  January  to  May  2013.  (Item  45-46).  This  was  part  of  his
sentence for the September 2012 DUI offense discussed above. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.i) In his
PSI, Applicant generally referenced his counseling with Ms. W, and noted that she had
advised him to abstain from alcohol. (Item 4 at 7) SOR ¶ 2.k, which Applicant admitted,
also alleges that he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Notwithstanding the admission,
there  is  no  documented  record  evidence  of  either  the  diagnosis  or  the  treatment  in
2013.
In  September  2013,  Applicant  was  again  found  responsible  by  university
authorities for violation of university policy regarding guests and alcohol, and complicity
in  violating  the  student  code  of  conduct.  He  was  required  to  take  a  course  and  was
reprimanded.  (Item  8)  Applicant  reported  in  his  PSI  that  this  concerned  a  party  in  his
dorm  room  that  was  broken  up  by  the  RA.  (Item  4  at  3)  (SOR  ¶  2.l)  While  Applicant
admitted  the  allegation,  there  is  no  documentation  in  the  record  to  detail  the
circumstances  of  this  incident,  alcohol-related  or  otherwise.  There  is  nothing  in  the
record to reflect that Applicant himself was drinking at the time.
In  January 2014,  Applicant  was  detained  by university police  after an argument
with  his  girlfriend.  He  had  been  drinking.  (Item  4  at  9)  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  2.m)  The  record
does  not  reflect  that  he  was  arrested  as  a  result.  He  was  again  disciplined  by  the
university for his disruptive conduct, and placed on probation. (Item 8 at 2)(SOR ¶ 2.n)
Applicant graduated from the university in spring 2014.
In November 2016, Applicant was driving home when he fell asleep at a red light.
He was awakened by police, and arrested for DUI after he refused a field sobriety test
and a breathalyzer. (Item 4 at 6) In May 2017, Applicant pleaded no contest to the DUI
charge  and  was  convicted.  He  was  sentenced  to  10  days  of  confinement,  ordered  to
attend  a  16-week  substance  abuse  program,  a  DUI  program,  and  weekly  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA) meetings.  He  received  one  year of  probation,  was  required  to  install
an  ignition  interlock  device  on  his  car,  and  his  driver’s  license  was  revoked  for  five
years. (Item 3 at 42-43; Item 6 at 6-7; Item 7)(SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.o)
After spending two days in jail, Applicant spent eight days in an inpatient alcohol
facility in May 2017. His initial assessment by the counselor, Mr. S, was a diagnosis of
severe alcohol use disorder. Applicant disclosed prior marijuana use that ended several
years before, and drinking several times a week from age 18 until the time of his most
recent  DUI  arrest,  in  November  2016.  On  discharge  from  the  16-week  program
(including  outpatient  treatment)  in  August  2017,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with
polysubstance  use  disorder,  in  early,  partial  remission.  He  was  advised  to  maintain
abstinence from drugs and alcohol. (Item 5 at 17-22) (SOR ¶ 2.p)
Guideline E
Applicant submitted  his SCA in  September 2017,  and  had  his initial background
interview  (PSI)  in March  2018. The  summary of  his  PSI reflects that Applicant discussed
his  high   school,  community   college,  and   undergraduate   education.   It   also  states  that
“after the Subject [Applicant] provided  he had  no disciplinary issues while at [his college,
identified   by   name],   the   Subject  was  confronted”  with   his  numerous  disciplinary
incidents, including  those  alleged  at SOR ¶¶  2.b, 2.c, 2.d, 2.h, 2.l, and  2.n. (Item  3  at 2-
4) SOR ¶  4.a  alleged  that Applicant falsified  material facts when  he  stated  to  the  OPM
investigator that  he  had  no  disciplinary  actions at  his university, when  in  fact  he  did,  and
deliberately   sought  to   conceal  that   information.  Applicant  admitted   SOR  ¶   4.a   without
explanation.
In March 2019, the DOD CAF sent Applicant an interrogatory about his history of
alcohol  involvement.  (Item  5)  He  reported  drinking  one  to  six beers,  twice  a  week,  on
weekends, between November 2016 (his most recent DUI) and Christmas 2017. (Item 5
at  3-4)  Applicant’s  acknowledged  drinking  up  to  at  least  Christmas  2017  was  after  he
was advised to abstain from alcohol use as recently as August 2017, by Mr. S., in the
substance abuse program. (SOR ¶ 2.q)
Guideline I
In  January  2020,  DOD  CAF  referred  Applicant  for  a  psychological  evaluation.
The  evaluator,  Dr.  B,  a  Ph.D.  licensed  clinical  psychologist  and  board-certified
neuropsychologist, reviewed Applicant’s 2017 counseling records and his 2018 report of
investigation  (ROI)  from  2018,  including  his  background  interview  summaries.  The
evaluation  report  reflects  that  Applicant  reported  his  most  recent  use  of  alcohol  was
Christmas 2018, not Christmas 2017; he said he consumed five or six drinks  at a time
which he also estimated as the “normal” amount of consumption  for the average person.
(Item  6 at 6-7)
In her report (Item 6 at 8), Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder,
severe (provisional). (SOR ¶ 2.r) She concluded as follows:
While  I  cannot  confirm   a   personality   disorder  in  this  case,  it  is  worth   of
note   that  I  identified   this  applicant  as  having   an   overly   inflated   sense   of
self-worth   and   lack  of  acceptance   for  his  inappropriate   illegal  behaviors
historically,  which  could   be   indicative   of   the   very   diagnosis  of   antisocial
personality   disorder  indicated   by   his  psychological  testing.  However,
based  on  the  medical records and  history  of  this applicant,  a  diagnosis of
alcohol  use   disorder,  severe,  is  certainly   likely.  Though   he   reports  not
drinking   for  a   little  over  a   year,  he   has  a   recent  history   of   giving   varying
information  about his alcohol intake  and  his  general  lack of insight into  the
problematic  behavior is concerning   to   me   as   a   clinician.  I  have   concerns
regarding   his  risk  of  relapse.  He   is  not  in   treatment,  and   has   received
treatment  only   when   mandated   by   this  [sic]  courts   and   his  inconsistent
reporting   of  use   leads  me   to   believe   he   still   may   be   abusing   alcohol;
however, at minimum  it raises  concerns  about his  candor  and  as  such  his
reliability/judgment/trustworthiness.  His  insight  is   poor.  (Item   6   at  8)
(Emphasis added)
When  Applicant  answered  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations  without
providing  any  explanation  or  comment.  He  also  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  He
therefore did not offer any evidence to mitigate any security concerns established by the
Government.

1998 through 2002 but did not earn a diploma. He has been employed as a laser tracker
operator by a defense contractor since February 2015. He was previously employed as
both a fabricator and a welder. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Item
3)
In May 2005, Applicant was pulled over for having a headlight out. During a search
of his vehicle, the police officer discovered marijuana. Applicant was then arrested and
charged with one count of misdemeanor possession of dangerous drugs. A prosecutor
later  amended  the  charge  to  one  count  of  possession  of  marijuana.  In  October  2005,
Applicant  plead  guilty  to  the  amended  charge  and  was  sentenced  to  12  months  of
probation. Applicant described the marijuana found in his vehicle as a: marijuana “roach”
(in his SCA); and as “less than 1 gram” of marijuana (in his SOR answer). (Item 2; Item 3
at 29; Item 4 at 2-3)
In December 2005, Applicant hit a patch of ice and lost control while driving his
father’s  vehicle.  A  police  officer  stopped  to  assess  whether  Applicant  needed  medical
attention.  During a  search  of  his person,  the  police  officer found  that  Applicant  was  in
possession of Vicodin. Applicant told the police officer that it was a prescribed medication,
but he did not have either the prescription itself or the bottle with him. Applicant was then
arrested. Subsequent to his arrest, the vehicle was inventoried during which the police
officer found marijuana located in a cup holder. Because he could not afford bail and no
one  would  pay  for  him  to  be  released,  Applicant  spent  the  weekend  in  jail.  While  he
claimed that the marijuana belonged to his father, and that he did not know that it was in
the vehicle, he pled guilty to possession of marijuana for which the court sentenced him
to  one  year  of  probation  and  fined  him  $600.  The  record  does  not  indicate  whether
Applicant suffered any additional consequences for being arrested while on probation for
the May 2005 incident. Applicant described the marijuana found in the vehicle as: “.1g of
marijuana”  (in  his  SCA);  a  “testable  amount”  of  marijuana  (during  his  2019  security
clearance interview); and  “a small amount” of  marijuana  (in  his SOR answer).  (Item 2;
Item 3 at 28-29; Item 5 at 2)
The SOR alleged that the December 2005 incident occurred in December 2004,
apparently  based  on  the  dates  Applicant’s  self-reported  on  his  March  2019  SCA  and
during  his  June  2019  security  clearance  interview.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant
amended  the  date  to  December  2005,  stating  “I  am  now  sure  it  was  2005.”  The
Government did not proffer any rebuttal evidence to the 2005 date. (Item 3 at 28-29; Item
5 at 2)
On July 7, 2013, a fire started in the attached garage of a home in which Applicant
resided with his mother, sister, and niece. The fire resulted from an accidental electrical
short  with  a  lawn  mower.  While  searching  his  home  for  other  fire  damage,  the  public
safety officers (PSO) investigating the fire discovered a marijuana cultivation operation.
Additional marijuana was found by police officers called to the scene to further search the
home. (AE A)
Applicant asserted that he was operating a medical marijuana cultivation operation
in accordance with applicable laws. He provided the officers with the required proof that
he was licensed to grow medical marijuana for three duly registered persons, including
himself as a qualifying patient and two others (his mother and Person A) as  qualifying
patients for whom he was their primary caregiver. However, the officers determined that
he had more marijuana plants than was allowed and that persons residing in the home
had unauthorized access to the plants. Applicant told the officers that he did not realize
that he had too many plants and also advised that “some of the plants may die so [I grow]
more.”  He acknowledged that the plants  were  accessible to everyone  who  lived  in the
home. He believed that having the doors locked to his home sufficed to secure the plants,
and claimed not to know that they needed to be in a secured location within the home.
(AE A)
The PSOs confiscated all of the marijuana in the home and told Applicant that he
would be advised about future prosecution. The seized marijuana included nine branches
of marijuana “buds,” 53 rooted marijuana plants, and 149 grams of marijuana (consisting
of one foil pan containing 88 grams, and 61 grams divided among six mason jars). The
seized marijuana was found throughout the house, including the basement, adjacent to
an upstairs futon, an upstairs drawer, the stairway to an upstairs room, and the upstairs
attic bedroom. The Department of Public Safety (DPS) deemed that Applicant forfeited
the seized marijuana because he never contacted them to claim any of it. On or about
July  12,  2013,  Applicant  was  charged  with:  1)  felony  delivery  and  manufacturing  of
marijuana;  2)  misdemeanor  maintaining  a  drug  house;  and  3)  misdemeanor  use  of
marijuana. In November 2013, he pled guilty to charge #3 for which he was fined $225.
Charges #1 and #2 were dismissed. (AE A; Item 3 at 25-26; Item 5 at 2-3; Item 4 at 3-4)
According to the incident report issued by the DPS, for three individuals, Applicant
was  allowed  a  total  of  36  plants  (12  per  individual)  and  7.5  grams  (2.5  grams  per
individual).  DPS   apparently   confused   grams and  ounces,  which  likely   accounts for the
final disposition  of  the  charges. The  applicable  state  law  allows  a  total of  212.62  grams
or 7.5  ounces for three  duly  registered  individuals (70.87  grams or 2.5  ounces for  each
individual), which Applicant did not exceed.  He  argued  that a  “major portion” of  his excess
17  “rooted  plants” consisted  of  “small  cuttings [he]  had  just  made  and  were not in  the  soil
long.” He stated: “I made  more than  I was going  to  grow into  larger plants because  some
would take  badly  to  the  soil  and  some  would die as I told  the  officers in the  reports.” He
asserted   that  he   had   no   intent  to   grow   more  than   the   allowable  amount  of   plants.   He
acknowledged  that “it was a  mistake” not to  be  more strict with  his plant count.  He has
not  cultivated  any  medicinal marijuana  since  the  July  2013  incident  and  does not  have
any plans to do so.  (AE A; Item 2;  AX  I through IV)
Applicant began smoking marijuana recreationally in the form of a cigarette, pipe,
or bong at the age of 15, when he was in high school. From age 15 to about age 18, he
smoked marijuana only on the weekends with friends in social settings. From about age
18 to age 26, he smoked marijuana approximately three to four times per week, in both
social settings and by himself. During that period, sometimes he used more than that and
sometimes less. In about 2009, at age 26, Applicant discovered that marijuana could help
with  his  chronic  back  pain.  He  was  evaluated  by  a  doctor  and  received  a  medical
marijuana  license  from  his  state  “around  2010.”  The  record  does  not  indicate  the
circumstances or frequency of his medical marijuana use or the degree to which he may
have used marijuana recreationally after receiving his marijuana license. He described
the  form  of  medical  marijuana  he  used  as: a  vaporizer  (during  his  June  2019  security
clearance interview); and “mainly edibles” (in his SOR answer). (Item 2; Item 5 at 3)
Applicant’s chronic back pain resulted from a herniated disk injury he sustained in
2004  for  which  he  was  initially  prescribed  Vicodin  as  treatment.  He  used  Vicodin  as
prescribed  until  2005,  when  he  began  abusing  it.  The  record  does  not  indicate  the
circumstances or frequency of his Vicodin use. In April 2005, Applicant voluntarily sought
and  received  treatment  for  his  abuse  of  Vicodin.  He  completed  only  the  detoxification
portion of the program. After his father passed away in April 2006, he returned for the full
program in May 2006. In December 2008, he voluntarily sought and received treatment
again  because  he  had  become  dependent  on  Vicodin.  This  time,  he  attended  an
outpatient  suboxone  maintenance  program.  Suboxone  is  the  medication  that  he  was
prescribed to treat his opioid dependency. He maintained that he never abused Subxone
and  only  used  it  as  prescribed  by  his  doctor  until  February  2019,  when  he  had
successfully weaned off of the medication pursuant to a careful plan established by his
doctor. The record contained scant details about the nature of his treatment, such as his
treatment status (e.g. whether he successfully completed the programs he attended), the
aftercare requirements, his prognoses, or whether the period of his Suboxone use was
reasonable.  In  his  SCA,  Applicant  answered  “yes”  to  the  question  of  whether  he
successfully completed his 2006 and 2008 treatment programs. (Item 2; Item 3 at 31-32;
Item 5 at 3-4)
Applicant attributed his use of medical marijuana and his abuse of and dependency
on  Vicodin  to  his  2004  back  injury.  He  stated  that  his  father’s  death  exacerbated  his
Vicodin abuse. He also used marijuana to calm him. He has not used Vicodin or any other
opioids since he entered treatment in 2008. He stopped using marijuana “around the end
of 2017.” Since then, he has managed his back pain by working out and strengthening
the muscles in his lower back, yoga-type stretching, and inversion. He also uses over-
the-counter  pain  relievers,  as  needed.  These  efforts  have  helped  him  avoid  using
marijuana or prescribed pain medications. Nowhere in the record does Applicant explicitly
state his intent regarding his future use of marijuana or Vicodin. (Item 2; Item 5 at 3)
In his SOR answer, Applicant stated:
I  know  that  I  have  made  some  mistakes  in  the  past  and  I  take  full
responsibility for them. I have learned from my mistakes and believe I am a
better  person  for  it  today.  I  no  longer  associate  with  any  of  the  people  I
called friends that were in my life during the years I was having problems. I
realized that without changing my friends I would never be able to make any
serious changes in life for the better and I believe it was the right decision.

"The   SOR  alleges  under  Guideline   E   (SOR  ¶   1.a)  and   cross-alleges  under
Guideline J (SOR ¶ 2.e) that Applicant submitted  false time records to his then  employer
from  about  September 2015 through January 2016,  claiming  1,035 in work hours that he
had   not  performed   for  which  he   was  paid   $21,735.   Additionally,  under  Guideline   J
Applicant allegedly  was arrested  in December 2004 for assault and  battery  (SOR ¶  2.a);
in June  2007  for assault and  battery with a dangerous weapon (SOR ¶  2.b); in July 2010
on an outstanding bench warrant (SOR ¶ 2.c); and in July 2013  for OUI (SOR ¶ 2.d).
When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted that he had made
“a  dishonest  and  terrible  decision”  by  knowingly  charging  work  hours  after  he  had
returned to college, and that he had committed the OUI offense in 2013, but asserted that
he  had  learned  from  his  past  mistakes.  Applicant  denied  any  knowledge  of  a  bench
warrant,  and  indicated  that  a  criminal  records  check  showed  no  arrest  from  2010.  He
admitted  the  arrests  for  assault  and  battery  but  stated  that  the  2007  incident  was  “a
complicated situation of false identification” and the 2004 charge was nothing more than
a  verbal  altercation  with  his  mother  and  stepfather.  He  requested  that  he  be  given  a
chance to show he can be trusted handling classified information.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old engineer. He has never married and has no children. A
native of Nigeria, he moved to the United States in 2003 and became a naturalized U.S.
citizen on his own application in February 2016. He earned an associate’s degree from a
community college in May 2011, and began studies for a bachelor’s degree in September
2011. He eventually earned  his bachelor’s degree  in May 2018. He has worked  for his
defense-contractor employer since October 2018.  (GE 1; Tr. 31-32.)
On  December  27,  2004,  Applicant  had  an  altercation  with  his  stepfather  and
mother because he refused to shovel snow. Applicant states that he had an interview for
a part-time job and did not want to be late, but his stepfather and mother did not believe
him. He denies that he hit either his mother or stepfather, but admits that “there was some
yelling” (Tr. 26,  51); that  the situation escalated; and that he had not  let his mother or
stepfather know that he had an interview scheduled. (Tr. 52-53.) His stepfather called the
police, and he was arrested for assault and battery. (GE 5.) Applicant testified that he did
not recall the disposition of the charge, although he then added that he had to meet with
someone in the juvenile court system and was on probation “for a couple of months or so
or  maybe  a  year.”  (Tr.  50-51.)  No  police  or  court  records  were  submitted  in  evidence
showing the circumstances that led to his arrest or the disposition of the charge.
Applicant was arrested for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon on June
9,  2007.  (GE  5.)  No  police  or  court  records  were  submitted  in  evidence  showing  the
circumstances that led to his arrest or the disposition of  the charge. Applicant testified
that it was a case of racial targeting, and he was misidentified as the perpetrator. (Tr. 27,
54-55.) He came upon the scene after an apparent assault, and the charge against him
was dropped. (Tr. 28-29.)
After high school, Applicant matriculated in a private college so that he could play
soccer at the collegiate level. His mother complained about the expense (Tr. 68-69), so
he took a year off before studying for his associate’s degree at a community college from
September 2008 to May 2011. (GE 1.)
A  check of  criminal records  by the  Federal Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  shows
that  Applicant  was  arrested  on  July  20,  2010,  on  a  bench  warrant.  (GE  5.)  Applicant
denies any recollection of the warrant or the arrest and ever knowingly failing to appear
in court on any charge. (Tr. 29-30, 58.) While Applicant apparently failed to timely register
his vehicle in 2008 (Answer; Tr. 59), there is no evidence linking his late registration to
the  warrant.  No  police  or  court  records  were  submitted  in  evidence  showing  the
circumstances that led to the arrest or the disposition of the charge.
Applicant matriculated in his state’s university on  its main campus in September
2011. Through May 2013, he worked part time on campus in its financial aid office. At the
end  of  the  spring  semester  in  2013,  he  had  an  internship  in  system  design  with  a
telecommunications company. (GE 1.)

On July 28, 2013, Applicant was stopped by campus police for speeding. He had
consumed  one  can  of  “Four  Loko”  while  socializing  at  a  friend’s  house.  (Tr.  44-45.)
According  to  the  National  Institute  on  Alcohol  Abuse  and  Alcoholism,  “Four Loko”  is a
fruity-flavored beverage that comes in 23.5 ounce cans and is about 12% alcohol. Each

http://www.spectrum.niaaa.nih.gov.  He  had  planned  to  stay  at  his  friend’s  home,  but
circumstances  changed.  He  failed  a  field  sobriety  test,  and  a  couple  of  Adderall  pills,
which Applicant submits belonged to a friend who had a prescription, were found in his
vehicle. (Tr. 22.) Applicant was charged with possession of a class B drug, possession of
a class E drug, OUI, negligent operation of a motor vehicle to endanger, speeding, and
marked lanes violation. (GEs 4-5; Tr. 22.) Pursuant to a plea agreement, on April 2, 2014,
the OUI charge was continued without a finding for ten months, and the other charges
were dismissed. Applicant was placed on OUI supervision to February 2015 and ordered
to pay costs, perform 82 hours of community service, and remain drug and alcohol free
with random drug testing. He lost his driving privileges for 45 days. (GE 4.) Applicant was
required to attend some Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Mother’s Against Drunk Driving
(MADD)  meetings  to  regain  his  driving  privileges,  and  the  university  required  that  he
receive some counseling. (Tr. 45-46.) He testified that he was deemed an alcoholic by
the court (Tr. 48), but there is no evidence substantiating such a diagnosis. He submits
that he paid the consequences for his poor judgment to drive a vehicle while intoxicated
and that he “learned a lot of lessons that [he holds] to this day.” (Tr. 49.) He now rarely
drinks alcohol. (Id.)
In   August  2014,  Applicant’s  internship  with   the   telecommunications  company
ended.  He  was  kept  on   the   project  as  a   temporary   contract  data   engineer   under  the
employment  of   a   consulting   company   that  paid   him   $21   per  hour.  At  the   end   of   each
week,  Applicant  submitted   a   report  to   the   consulting   company   showing   the   number  of
hours he  worked  on  the  project  that week, and  the  consulting  company  paid him  directly.
The   consulting   company   then   invoiced   the   telecommunications  company   for the hours
worked  by  Applicant.  Before any  payment by  the  telecommunications  company, the  hours
worked   by   Applicant   had   to   be   approved   by   a   manager  at  the   telecommunications
company. (GEs 1, 3;  Tr. 32-34.)
At  the  end  of  the  semester  in  December  2014,  Applicant  was  on  academic
probation and not allowed to continue in his engineering program. (Tr. 23, 47-48.) He was
advised  to  choose  another  major  course  of  study,  but  he  was  passionate  about
engineering. (Tr. 23.) He withdrew from the university and enrolled in a community college
to improve his grades so that he could pursue an engineering degree at another university
within  the  state’s  system  of  higher  education.  (Tr.  68.)  He  continued  to  work  as  a
contractor for the telecommunications company. (GE 1.)
In  September  2015,  Applicant  transferred  to  another  campus  within  his  state’s
university  system.  On  September  30,  2015,  the  telecommunications  company  ceased
approving hours for Applicant, and he  stopped working on the project.  He was able to
obtain one loan that did not fully cover his tuition and was not eligible for any additional
subsidized or unsubsidized federal student loans.  (Tr. 38, 69.) Struggling financially at
the  time  and  “at  the  point in  [his] life  when  [he]  felt  age  was a  factor for [him]” with  respect
to   finishing   his  education   and   starting   a   career  (Tr.  68-69),  Applicant  made   “a  bad
decision” to  continue  to  submit weekly  reports  to  the  consulting  company, claiming  falsely
that he  continued  to  provide  data  engineering  services for the  client telecommunications
company   through   January   22,  2016.  Applicant  represented   to   the   consulting   company
that  the  telecommunications  company  had  approved  his  hours. Based  on  those  reports,
the  consulting  company  paid him  $21,735 for a  total of 1,035  hours that he did not  work.
(GEs 1-3;  Tr. 19-20, 34-35.)  Applicant used  the  unearned  income  to  pay  for his education
and   living   expenses.  (Tr.  38-39.)  Applicant  realized   “after a   month   or halfway   through”
that it was not a good idea to  submit  false time records, but he continued to  persist in  his
fraudulent activity.  (Tr.  64-65.) He understood  that it was “a dishonest and  disloyal act,”
but he  needed  to  pay  for college. He had  a  payment deadline  to  the  university  or he  would
be  dropped  from  classes. (Tr. 19-20,  65-66.) His submission  of false  time  records  ceased
when it was discovered. (Tr. 64-66.)
Applicant began  working  as a  residential assistant at the  university  around  March
1, 2016. He  was transparent  about his OUI and  used  his experience  to  instruct  students
about the  consequences of  drunk driving. (Tr. 24-25.) There is no  evidence  that he  was
candid  with his university employer about his falsification  of  time records.
On March 26, 2016, attorneys for the consulting company informed Applicant that
the company had recently learned of his falsification of work records from October 1, 2015
through January 22, 2016, and that he was being terminated from his employment for his
deceit. Through its legal counsel, the company demanded that he remit $21,735 by April
2016 or contact them before close of business on March 30, 2016, to discuss mutually
agreeable  terms  of  repayment.  (GE  2.) When  confronted  about  his  fraudulent  activity,
Applicant had less than $1,000 remaining of the income he did not earn. (Tr. 39.)
Facing  a  civil  lawsuit by  the  company  (GEs 1, 3; Tr. 37, 41)  and  fearing  that he
would  be   jailed   (Tr.  40),  Applicant   entered   into   a   confidential  settlement  agreement   in
August 2016  under which  he was required  to  sign  an  agreement for judgment for $21,735
to  be  executed  if  he  defaulted  on  his repayment  terms. (GE 3.)  The  consulting  company
was “kind  enough” to  postpone  his repayment until  he   graduated  from  college. (Tr.  20,
70.) Under the  settlement,  Applicant agreed  to   repay  $21,735  at $250  per month  from
October  2018   through   December  2018;   $300   per  month   from   January   2019   through
March 2019;  $350  per  month  from  April 2019  through  June  2019;  and  $500  per month
from  July  2019  through  July  2022  with  a  final payment of  $535  due  on  August 1, 2022.
Applicant  provided   documentation   of   his  timely   payments   through   November  2020
showing   that  he   had   paid  $10,535   with   $11,200   left   to   pay   under  the   settlement
agreement.  (GE 3.) He  testified  credibly  that  he  continued  to  make  his monthly  payments
through   April  2021.  (Tr.  43,  70.)   Applicant   did   not   challenge   the   $21,735   to   be   repaid
because he knew he “was in the wrong.” (Tr. 36-37.)
Applicant’s  campus  jobs  as  a  residential  assistant  and  as  an  information
technology technician ended when he received his bachelor’s degree in May 2018. After
he graduated from college, he began working as an engineering contractor for a robotics
company. (GE 1.)
Applicant completed and certified a Questionnaire for National Security Positions
(SF 86) on July 19, 2018, seeking a security clearance to work on a military base. He
indicated  that he  left his employment with  the  consulting company in January 2016 “by
mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct.” In response to police
record  inquiries,  he  listed  the  charges  filed  against  him  in  July  2013.  About  the  drug
charges, he explained that Adderall had been found in his vehicle; that the drug belonged
to a friend who had a prescription and the charges were “removed” when the friend “gave
a  sworn  statement.”  He  stated  with  respect  to  the  OUI,  “I  am  very  apologetic  and  I
regretted my actions and I am thankful that there was no accident and nobody got hurt.”
(GE 1.)
On  October 1, 2018, Applicant  started  working  for his employer, who  is currently
sponsoring him  for security clearance eligibility. He was not required to submit a  new SF
86.  (Tr.  32.)  Applicant  presently   earns   $74,000   annually   at  his  defense-contractor
employment.  (Tr. 67.) He has never held a  security  clearance  and works on  unclassified
projects. (Tr. 60.)
As  of  November  2020,  Applicant  had  one  revolving  charge  account  with  an
outstanding balance. The  account  was  current  with  a balance  of  $196.  His  installment
loan debt of $101,094 was for student loans. (Answer; GE 3.) He had $10,031 in a savings
account. (GE 3; Tr. 71.)
Applicant acknowledges that “[he] made one too many bad decisions,” and submits
that he has endeavored to be a law-abiding citizen since his falsification of time records
from October 1, 2015 through January 22, 2016. (Tr. 21.) He is remorseful for his deceitful
conduct and realizes that being financially pressed to pay for college does not justify his
misconduct. (Tr. 65.) He plans on pursuing a master’s degree in the near future. (Tr. 22.)

"Applicant is 41 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor since
February  2017.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1999  until  he  was
honorably  discharged  in  2003.  He  attended  college  for  a  period,  and  he  has  several
certificates. The most recent information available indicates that he has never married,
and he has no children. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant  was  arrested   in  2003   and   charged   with   felony   soliciting   a   child   via
computer  and   sending   harmful  material  to   a   minor  by   electronic  device.   He  was
convicted  of the  first offense  and  sentenced  to  confinement  for one  year and  probation
for  three   years.  He  served   about  eight  to   nine   months  in  jail.  He  was  also  ordered   to
register as a sex offender.  (Items 1-4)
Applicant  stated  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  that  he  had  recently  been
discharged from the military and was visiting his mother before moving to another state:
While I was there, I was on the computer one day chatting with people in
Yahoo  chatrooms.  I  was  contacted  by  an  officer  posing  as  a  15-year-old
teenage girl. I planned to head to a GNC nutrition store at the mall to pick
up  some  protein  shakes  for  my  work  out  later  that  day.  I  told  who  I  was
speaking with in the chatroom that if she wanted to meet, we could meet
for  a  bit  outside  of  the  GNC  store.  Next  thing  I  know  I  had  two  plain
clothes officers grab me and take me to the back of the store where I was
arrested.
Applicant  gave  additional  facts  when  he  was  interviewed  for  his  background
investigation in October 2018. He stated that he smoked marijuana two to three times a
week  while  he  was  at  his  mother’s  house.  The  “girl”  (actually  a  police  officer)  did  not
have a profile picture. He gave varying accounts as to her age. He initially stated that he
did not know her age; he later stated that he did know her age; and he also stated that
he  could  not  recall  if  he  knew  her  age.  He  admitted  that  he  sent  the  girl  a  video  of  a
man’s genitalia. When  asked  why  he  pursued  the  interaction  with  the  girl, he  said  that
he was high and wanted sex. (Item 3)
Applicant was arrested  in January  2007  and  charged  with  violating  his probation.
He stated  that he  was stopped  by  the  police  while  riding  his motorcycle,  and  he  did  not
realize   that   he   was  outside   the   county   line   in  violation   of  his   probation.   The   judge
decided  not to  revoke  his probation  and  send  him  to  jail. He pleaded  guilty  in May  2007
to  misdemeanor reckless driving. He was sentenced  to  a  $230  fine  and  $68  court costs.
(Items 1-4)
Applicant  presented   a   2013   letter   from   his  current   state’s  Attorney   General’s
office  stating  that  he  was no  longer required  to  register  as  a  sex  offender  in  that  state.
He completed extensive psychosexual treatment  while he was on probation. He has a
good  job  that  he  loves.  He  fully  reported  his  criminal  record  on  his  SF  86.  Applicant
admitted that he lied on job applications if  the application  asked if  he  was a convicted
felon.  He  did  not  remember  if  he  lied  on  the  application  for his  current  job.  During  his
background interview in October 2018, he stated that his parents and sister knew about
his felony record, but his employer and live-in girlfriend did not.  In his response to the
SOR,  he  reported  that  his  steady  girlfriend  of  three  years  knew  all  about  his  criminal
history. (Items 1-3)

"In  answering  the  original  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.d.  He
partially admitted and partially denied SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e. He denied SOR ¶ 1.f.
His  answers  to  each  allegation  included  explanations.  He  did  not  address  the  cross-
allegation at SOR ¶ 2.a, but I incorporate his admissions, denials, and explanations to
the  underlying  allegations  in  SOR  ¶  1,  accordingly.  Applicant’s  SOR  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. He and his wife married in March 2019. They have no
children. (Tr. 32, 37) He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2002. After a brief period of self-
employment in 2003, he worked from September 2003 to September 2004 as a civilian
engineer  (GS-5)  for  a  Navy  command  in  a  state  far  from  his  home.  From  September
2004 to January 2013, he worked for a DOD agency, starting as an intern and rising to
GS-14. Applicant then worked for a defense contractor until November 2015, when he
was  laid  off.  He  was  then  unemployed  until  March  2016.  He  has  worked  for  various
employers  in  the  defense  industry  since  March  2016,  and  has  worked  for  his  current
employer since 2018. (Tr. 30-33, 81-84; GE 1 at 11-14; GE 2 at 20-23) He has held a
security  clearance  since  about  2004.  (GE  1  at  37-40;  Tr.  9,  36)  He  most  recently
submitted SCAs in October 2009 and December 2016. (GE 2, GE 1) He has an annual
salary of $195,000. (Tr. 83)
In   September  2007,   Applicant   drove   to   a   town   in  a   neighboring   state   for  a   car
show.  Before   returning   home   that   night,   he   stopped   at  a   restaurant   for  dinner  and
drinks.  He  fell   asleep   at  the   wheel   while   driving   home   and   drove   into   a   ditch.   Police
came  to  the  scene  and  he  was arrested  for DUI. (SOR ¶  1.a) He spent  the  night in jail
and   returned   home   the   next  morning   (Tr.  37-38,  42,  84-85)   Applicant  testified   that  he
did not recall  how  much  he  had  to  drink  that evening  because  it was so  long  ago. (Tr.
39)  Records  referenced   in  his  September  2019   psychological  evaluation   indicate   that
“he had  four to  five beers and then  drove home” from the car show.  (GE 4 at 3)
Applicant later went to court, and was offered a plea agreement under which he
was to complete an alcohol education course, pay a fine, and serve a year of probation,
after  which  the  case  would  be  dismissed.  Applicant  completed  the  alcohol  education
course near his home, completed probation successfully and the case was closed. (Tr.
39-40, 42, 70, 85-86; GE 2 at 46) Applicant disclosed the offense to his DOD employer
and on his 2009 SCA. (Tr. 40-41; GE 2 at 45)
In  April  2010,  Applicant  was  pulled  over  for  speeding  on  his  way  home  from
dinner at a restaurant. He was arrested and charged with DUI after a field sobriety test.
(Tr.  70-71)(SOR  ¶  1.b)  He  testified  that  he  pleaded  no  contest,  and  he  received
probation before judgment (PBJ), served one year of probation, and had to attend a six-
week alcohol education course. (Tr. 45, 86) The  Government’s evidence  reflected  that
he pleaded guilty, rather than no contest, though Applicant “distinctly” recalled it was the
latter.  (GE  5;  Tr.  46,  86)  Applicant  believed  his  probation  ended  without  incident,  but
was not specifically aware of how the case ended. He reported the offense to his DOD
employer. (Tr. 46-47, 86, 88-89; GE 3)
In July 2012, Applicant was driving home, past 11:00 p.m., after having dinner at
a  restaurant.  While  driving  home,  he  noticed  a  car  tailing  him  and  following  his
movements.  He  pulled  over  when  he  saw emergency  lights  in  his  rearview mirror.  He
refused a field sobriety test and was taken into custody.  The police report reflects that
the officer detected “a strong odor of alcohol emitting from [Applicant’s] person.” He also
was  lethargic  and  showed  signs  of  slurred  speech.  He  took  a  breathalyzer  test  at  the
police station, and registered a 0.13 blood alcohol content. (GE 7 at 5) He was arrested
and  charged  with  DUI,  and  some  traffic  offenses.  (Tr.  48-52,  73-74,  87;  GE  7  at  9,)
(SOR ¶ 1.c)
The  arresting  officer was a  military  policeman, and  the  road  where Applicant was
stopped   was  evidently  near  to,   or  adjacent   to,  a   U.S.   military   base.  Applicant  testified
that he   was  never “on   post” as   reflected   in   the   police   report.  (Tr.  87;  GE   6)  Given   the
location  of the  incident, Applicant  appeared  in  federal court,  where he  pleaded  guilty  to
a  lesser charge  of reckless driving  and  fined  about  $500. The  various DUI charges and
other traffic offenses were all  dismissed  and   judgments  of  acquittal were  entered. (GE
7)  Applicant informed  his DOD employer about the arrest. (Tr. 51, 88; GE 3)
In   September  2015,  Applicant   was  pulled   over  for  speeding   after  driving   home
from   a   concert.  The   report  from   his  September  2019   psychological  evaluation
(discussed  below) indicates that he  had  five  or six  beers at the  concert. (GE 4  at 4) He
was  arrested   by   state   police,   charged   with   DUI,   and   released.  (SOR  ¶   1.d)   Applicant
testified   that  the   charge   was  ultimately   dismissed   when   the   arresting   officer  did  not
appear  in  court.  (Tr.   52-55,  72-74,  89;  GE   8)  He   said  he   voluntarily   enrolled   in  a   26-
week adult education course on his lawyer’s advice. (Tr. 54, 89, 90)  He  self-reported the
arrest to  his employer, a defense contractor. (Tr. 54; GE 3)
In  October  2018,  on  his  last  day  of  work  with  his prior employer, Applicant  met
some future co-workers at a restaurant for drinks and dinner. He was pulled over while
driving  home.  He  refused  the  field  sobriety  test  and  was  taken  to  the  police  station,
where  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  a  vehicle  while  impaired  by  alcohol
(DWIA)  after  taking  a  breathalyzer  test.  (GE  9;  Tr.  74-75,  90)(SOR  ¶  1.e)  He
acknowledged having more than one drink that evening. (Tr. 55-56) He self-reported the
arrest to his new employer. (Tr. 57)
In  January  2019,  Applicant  went  to  court  and  pleaded  guilty  to  DWI.  He  was
sentenced  to  60  days  in  jail  (50  days  suspended)  and  fined  about  $800.  He  spent  10
days  in  a  weekend  work-release  program.  He  was  also  sentenced  to  18  months  of
supervised  probation,  ordered  to  install  an  ignition  interlock  device  on  his  car,  and
required to attend 26 weeks of alcohol-education classes and a Mothers Against Drunk
Driving (MADD) panel. (Tr. 56-58, 90-93; GE 9; AE A)
Applicant completed the alcohol-education classes at a counseling center in June
2019.  The  evaluations  and  screening  assessments  he  received  “did  not  indicate  a
substance  dependency  disorder.”  (AE  A)  The  discharge  report  notes  Applicant’s
motivated  and  positive  participation  in  the  program.  He  “acknowledged  the  need  for
change  in  his  own  life,”  learned  about  the  impact  of  alcohol  abuse  on  himself  and  his
family, and of strategies to make safer decisions in the future. (AE A)
Applicant testified that his probation was abated after 12 months. (Tr. 57, 92-93)
A  letter  from  Applicant’s  defense  attorney  from  the  case  noted  that  the  state  did  not
provide  documentation  of  successful  completion  of  probation,  but  he  noted  that
Applicant’s probation expired in July 2020. (AE F, AE G)
During  the  course  of  his  2019  security  clearance  investigation,  Applicant  was
ordered by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) to participate in a
psychological  evaluation,  in  September  2019.  (GE  4;  Tr.  67)  He  was  evaluated  by  a
licensed clinical psychologist, Dr. B, who was asked to evaluate whether Applicant has
“any  medical,  psychological,  psychiatric,  emotional,  or  substance  abuse  conditions
which could impair his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness[.]” (GE 4 at 1)
Dr.  B  diagnosed  Applicant  with  moderate  alcohol  use  disorder.  (GE  4  at  7)  In
detailing the basis for her opinion, she noted that:
[Applicant] has a significant history of alcohol use, beginning in 2003, and
he received 5 DUIs between 2007 and 2018. After each incident, he was
required  to  complete  alcohol  abuse  classes,  however,  he  has  never
enrolled  in an  intensive  substance abuse  treatment program.  Despite  his
notable history of criminal conduct with alcohol, he has continued to drink.
He does attend weekly AA meetings, yet he admitted that he still has not
accepted his alcoholism. (GE 4 at 1)
This  was  based  upon  Dr.  B’s  review  of  Applicant’s  personal  and  social
information,  educational  information,  medical  information,  substance  abuse  history,
legal  and  mental  health  information  provided  by  the  DOD  CAF,  as  well  as  her  clinical
observations,  a  clinical  interview,  and  his  psychological  test  results.  (GE  4)  Dr.  B’s
opinion is the basis for SOR ¶ 1.f. Dr. B concluded that
The  risk  of  future  alcohol-related  incidents  seems  moderate.  [Applicant]
attends  regular  AA  meetings  and  feels  he  is  able  to  adequately  manage
his  drinking;  however,  his  behavioral  health  history  and  current  lack  of
concern  about  his  drinking  suggests  a  guarded  prognosis.  As  such,  his
diagnosis could  pose a  risk  to  his judgment, reliability,  or trustworthiness
concerning classified information. (GE 4 at 7)
Applicant  denied  being  terminated  from  employment  due  to  alcohol  issues  or
poor  performance.  (Tr.  33-37)  In  Dr.  B’s  report,  she  referenced  employment  records
indicating  that  Applicant’s  termination  in  2015  was  due  to  such  issues,  but  she  also
noted that Applicant denied this in interviews with her, as he did at hearing. (GE 4 at 2)
There is no corroborating documentation from the employer in the record on this issue,
and it is not alleged that Applicant ever had employment issues related to alcohol, so I
will not make such a conclusion.
Dr.  B  also  noted  Applicant’s  historical  drinking  pattern.  She  found  that  between
2003 and 2010, he went on “‘drinking binges’ on a monthly basis, where he would drink
“intermittently”  throughout  the  weekend.  From  2010  to  2015,  he  drank  mostly  on
weekends often consuming 6-7 beers a night. Dr. B found that Applicant’s drinking had
tapered  off  significantly  after  he  met  his  wife  (in  2016),  as  he  consumed  one  to  two
drinks  on  weekends. From  October 2018  to January 2019, he abstained from  alcohol,
but then resumed drinking again. (GE 2 at 3)
In March 2021, Applicant participated in another psychological evaluation, at the
suggestion  of  his  attorney,  in  preparation  for  this  hearing.  He  was  evaluated  by  a
licensed doctor of clinical psychology (Psy.D), Dr. W. (AE C, AE D; Tr. 67))
Dr. W’s basis for her opinion was a review of background information, including
Dr.  B’s  evaluation,  review  of  Applicant’s  personal  and  social  information,  educational
information,  medical  and  mental  health  information,  substance  use  history,  and  legal
information,  including  court  records  from  his  arrests  from  2010-2018,as  well  as  her
clinical observations, a clinical interview, and his psychological test results. (AE C)
Dr.  W  agreed  with  Dr.  B’s  findings  in  her  2019  evaluation.  (AE  C  at  6)  Dr.  W
noted  that  Applicant  had  significantly  reduced  his  use  of  alcohol  since  2019,  and  no
longer engaged in binge drinking. (AE C at 7) She found that he continued to meet the
criteria for moderate  alcohol use disorder, though now in sustained remission. Dr. W’s
prognosis for Applicant is guarded. (AE C at 7-8; Tr. 79)
Dr. W’s report notes that Applicant consumed  six or more beers at his bachelor
party, in February 2019, about a month  after pleading guilty in his most recent alcohol
case. (Tr. 94-95; AE C at 3) He was on probation at the time but was not prohibited from
consuming alcohol. (Tr. 96-97)
During his hearing, Applicant described his current alcohol usage as “pretty low.”
He said he drinks at home with family members or close friends, about once or twice a
month.  (Tr.  60-62)  He  said  that  prior  to  his  2015  DUI,  he  would  drink  as  a  “social
lubricant.” He said his habits changed  in 2016, when  he  met the  woman  who  is now  his
wife.  He   began   to   frequent   restaurants   less   often   and   engaged   in   more   couples   and
family  activities that did not involve  alcohol. (Tr. 60-61) He  said he  did not drink much  at
all  during  2019  and  2020, but  for New  Year’s  Eve  (Jan. 2020). (Tr. 61) He said when  he
drinks,  he   has  one   or  two   drinks,  and   has   not  had   more   than   two   beers  since   his
wedding in 2019. (Tr. 62-63, 76-77)
Applicant testified  that the 2018  DUI was an “outlier, in that it was specifically to
celebrate a promotion.” He acknowledged making  a “stupid decision” to drink and drive
that  evening.  (Tr. 63,  101-102)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  alcohol  has  disrupted  his
life.  He  wants  his  wife  and  family  to  see  him  as  a  role  model.  Applicant  also
acknowledged health issues that he wants to improve. He knows that “alcohol has been
a problem for me in the past, and I don’t want it to control my life.” (Tr. 64)
Applicant  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  between  October  2018  and
March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic led him to end social gatherings. (GE 4 at
3; AE C at 3) He was not aware that he could have attended online AA meetings rather
than in-person meetings. He does not have an AA sponsor, and did not “work the steps”
of  AA’s  12-step  program.  (Tr.  64-65,  77-78,  80,  99-100)  He  noted  to  Dr.  W  that  he
intended to resume AA meetings when it is safe to do so (as related to the pandemic).
(AE  C at 3)  Applicant also  testified that  his  wife  and  family members are  aware  of  his
issues and are a good support network for him. He vowed never to drink and drive. (Tr.
65-66, 68-69, 97-98)
Applicant  asserted   several  times   during   the   hearing   that   he   had   been   using
alcohol  as a  “social lubricant” but no  longer feels the  need  to  do  so  now  that he  has  met
his  wife,  since   they   do   many   things  together  that  do   not  involve   alcohol.  He  also
considers  his  2015   DUI  to   be   “a  wakeup   call”  that  led   him   to   decrease   his  alcohol
intake. (Tr. 100-101)
Applicant  does  not  intend  to  increase  his  alcohol  intake  beyond  the  CDC’s
recommendations (two-drink maximum per sitting, no more than 14 drinks in a week) as
noted  by  Dr.  W.  in  her  report,  and  Applicant  may  decrease  drinking  in  the  future.  (Tr.
105, AE C) He does not believe he will have trouble controlling his future alcohol intake.
(Tr. 105-107)
Applicant provided a “Statement of Intent” regarding his future alcohol intake. He
promised  never  to  abuse  alcohol  (binge  drink  or  drink  to  excess);  to  use  alcohol
responsibly (within CDC guidelines); and to never operate a vehicle after using alcohol.
If he is found to have violated these terms, he consented to the automatic revocation of
his clearance or eligibility for a position of trust. (AE H)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  a  valid  driver’s  license,  but  that  it  has  an  alcohol
restriction,  meaning  that  a  state  medical  evaluation  board  had  determined  that  “I
shouldn’t  drive  with  any  alcohol  in  my  system.”  He  no  longer  has  an  ignition  interlock
device on his car. (Tr. 102-104)
In  December  2019,  Applicant  was  pulled  over  for  speeding  while  driving  on  an
interstate highway. He was driving 80 mph in a 65-mph zone. He said he had been out
shopping with his wife. He acknowledged guilt by pre-paying the fine. (GE 10) He said
he  had  not  been  drinking,  and  noted  that  he  could  not  have  been,  since  the  ignition
interlock  was  installed  in  his  car.  (Tr.  58-60,  107-108)  No  alcohol-related  charges  or
citations are noted on GE 10, and this traffic offense is not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant’s wife wrote a strong recommendation letter in support of her husband.
He  is  supportive  and  loving.  He  has  been  an  excellent  caregiver  for  their  parents.
During  the  pandemic,  she  has  observed  him  to  be  an  excellent  coach  and  guide  for
other  workers  while  working  from  home.  He  is  a  diligent  worker.  They  had  serious
conversations  after  his  2018  arrest,  which  made  her  “livid.”  She  attested  that  he  has
significantly  curtailed  his  drinking  habits  after  his  2018  DWI,  and  is  now  more
responsible. She believes he is a changed man and she recommends he maintain his
clearance. (AE E)
Several  other  work  references,  including  supervisors,  peers,  and  friends,  also
wrote letters of recommendation in support of his eligibility for a clearance. They regard
Applicant as trustworthy and of good character. He is committed to country, family, and
friends. He is hard-working and dedicated, and follows rules and regulations. (AE B)

"Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  administrative  assistant,  employed  by  a  government
contractor since May 2019. He attended community college and university from 2012 to
2017, but did not attain a degree. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2007 to 2012,
including  a  deployment  to  Afghanistan,  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.  (GE  3,
Ans.) Applicant was never married, but has lived with a cohabitant since September 2015.
Applicant was granted a security clearance in 2007 while he was on active duty.(GEs 3
and 4)
The SOR alleges under Guideline J (criminal conduct), that in May 2007, Applicant
was  charged  with  felony  criminal  abduction  by  force,  intimidation  or  deception,  and
misdemeanor sexual battery by force or helplessness. He was convicted of misdemeanor
assault and battery, and sentenced to 12 months of supervised probation (SOR ¶ 1.a).
The  remaining  Guideline  J  allegations,  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  –  1.j,  alleged  traffic  violations  to
include reckless driving (all related to excessive speed) in July 2008, December 2008,
April 2009, and October 2010. He was convicted of misdemeanor reckless driving in all
four  cases  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b  –  1.e).  In  December  2014,  he  was  charged  and  convicted  of
speeding (SOR ¶ 1.f).
Between July 2012 and February 2014, Applicant was charged and found guilty of
at least five motor vehicle equipment safety violations such as improper exhaust system
and tinted windshield (SOR ¶ 1.g). Between October 2012 and December 2014, he was
charged  and  found  guilty  of  at  least  three  motor  vehicle  traffic  violations,  including
improper lane change and disobeying highway markings or sign. (SOR ¶ 1.h). Finally, in
April 2015 and March 2019, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor concealed weapon
violations (SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j).
SOR ¶  1.a  was cross-alleged  under Guideline  D (sexual behavior); and  SOR  ¶¶
1.a  –  1.j,  were cross-alleged  under Guideline  E  (personal  conduct).  Applicant admitted  all
of  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations,  except  for  the  December 2008  reckless  driving
incident (SOR ¶  1.c.), which he could not recall.
Applicant explained the circumstances of his criminal charges and motor vehicle
violations in his Answer to the SOR and in his personal subject interview (PSI) conducted
by  a  Government  investigator.  The  gravest  charge,  and  one  that  is  alleged  under
Guidelines  J,  D,  and  E,  is  the  2007  charge  of  felony  criminal  abduction  by  force,
intimidation or deception, and misdemeanor sexual battery by force or helplessness. The
Government’s evidence in the FORM includes Applicant’s statements and an FBI record
showing the felony charge was nolle prossed, while he was convicted of misdemeanor
assault  and  battery.  No  police  records  or  contemporaneous  witness  statements  were
provided  in  the  record,  and  neither  Department  Counsel  nor  Applicant  requested  a
hearing.
Applicant  explained that  in  2007,  while  he  was  in  high  school,  he and a female
student had engaged in “consensual” touching with each other over their clothes while in
private. He was 19 years old at the time, while she was under 18. On another occasion,
they  were  walking  to  a  bus  stop  after  school  while  Applicant  and  she  were  “horsing
around” and teasing. Applicant tried to convince her to stay with him until the bus arrived
by  pulling  on  her  arm  in  a  “kidding”  way,  but  “not  physically  harming”  her.  After  she
returned home, she told her father about the touching and their behavior at the bus stop.
The girl’s father called the school, and Applicant was called to the school resource officer
and  arrested.  Applicant  appeared  in  court  and  pleaded  guilty  to  a  reduced  charge  of
misdemeanor  assault  and  battery.  Applicant  stated  that  he  received  a  12-month
suspended sentence and was put on supervised probation until he left for active duty in
the Marine Corps. Since that time, Applicant served about five years in the Marine Corps
and held a security clearance. Applicant averred in his Answer that this offense occurred
14 years ago, and that he and the girl were classmates and they “fooled around a lot.” He
believes that her parents were unhappy with the relationship since the girl was under 18
years old, and reported their activity to the school. No similar incidents have been reported
since.
The  other  serious  charges  involved  misdemeanor  possession  of  a  concealed
handgun in a car, without a permit in 2015 and 2019. The 2015 incident resulted from a
traffic  stop  when  the  officer  asked  Applicant  if  he  had  a  weapon  in  the  car.  Applicant
answered affirmatively, and showed the officer the handgun between the center console
and the driver’s seat and asserted that it was not concealed. The officer disagreed, and
Applicant was cited, but the charge was eventually dismissed. The 2019 incident occurred
when Applicant forgot he had a handgun under the driver’s seat after leaving a shooting
range the night before. He put the gun there while  he stopped at a convenience store
because he could not legally carry it into the store without a concealed handgun permit
and he did not want it visible in the car. The following day, he was stopped for having dark
tint on his window. Applicant stated that he showed the officer a doctor’s note permitting
the tinted windows, and he was free to go. However, before he left, the officer asked him
if  he  had  a  weapon  in  the  car  and  Applicant  said  no,  having  forgotten  it  was  there.
Applicant consented to allow the officer to search the car, and the gun was found under
the seat. Applicant was cited, but this charge was also dismissed. Applicant stated that
he  obtained  a  state  concealed  handgun  permit  after  the  2019  incident.  In  his  state,  a
county district court judge issues the permit after a background check is conducted.
I take administrative notice of  laws in Applicant’s state  regarding the possession
and transport of handguns and the issuance of concealed carry permits. Generally, the
state law in question permits the “open” carry of handguns without a permit (provided it
has a magazine capacity of 20 rounds or less, is not designed to accommodate a silencer,
or does not have a folding stock), by any person over 18 years old. A weapon is deemed
to be hidden from common observation when it is observable but is of  such deceptive
appearance as to disguise the weapon's true nature. Typically, in a vehicle, a firearm may
be  considered  ""openly  carried""  if  the  firearm  is  openly  visible.  Generally,  a  permit  is
required to carry a concealed firearm in the state, including in a vehicle. A pistol may be
transported  concealed,  without  a  permit,  if  a  person  is  at,  or  going  to  or  from,  an
established shooting range, provided that the weapon is unloaded and securely wrapped
while being transported. The facts in the record are insufficient to draw legal conclusions
regarding Applicant’s firearms activity or criminal charges.
Applicant  generally  explained  the  circumstances  behind  most  of  the  traffic
violations,  and  stated  that  since  2014,  he  has  matured  and  become  a  safer  driver,
watches for other drivers, obeys speed limits and signs, and cares for other people on the
road. Applicant acknowledged that his past irresponsible actions put others on the road
in danger. Applicant also noted that he gets migraine headaches from a bright sun, so he
had his windows tinted. Once he learned that he needed a doctor’s prescription for tinted
windows, he obtained one. In addition, since he unknowingly paid a loud exhaust ticket
online without challenging it, he has had another citation dismissed after showing that the
exhaust system on his car is stock.

"Applicant admitted both of the allegations in SOR. (TR at page 20 line 25 to page
22  line  11.)  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX 1  at  page  7.)
He has been employed  with the defense contractor since May of 2020. (GX 1 at page

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.f, and ¶ 2.b. He partially admitted and partially
denied the cross-allegation at SOR ¶ 2.a (concerning the alcohol-related offenses at SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e). In addressing each allegation, he provided the same one-sentence
explanation. Applicant’s SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old.  (Tr. 25) He has never married  and  has no  children. (Tr.
35) After high  school, he  attended  college  from  2002  to  2008, dropped  out  to  tend  bar full
time  (2009-2010),  then  went back to  school. He earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in mechanical
engineering in 2013. (GE 1  at 15, Tr. 27-28, 36)
Applicant held various jobs from 2010 to 2012, mostly as a bartender,  and then
with the university while finishing his degree, in 2013. From 2013 to 2017, he worked for
company H. He was terminated in October 2017. (SOR ¶ 2.b) He was unemployed for
the rest of 2017. He then worked on a nine-month contract with defense contractor A for
most of 2018. He has worked for his current employer, contractor C, since October 2018.
(GE 1 at 15-25; Tr. 27) He is a senior mechanical engineer. (Tr. 26) He has never held a
clearance.  (GE  1  at  54;  Tr. 8)  Applicant  has  a  patent for  an  invention  relating  to  optic
transmission for use in well drilling in the oil industry. (Tr. 29-30, AE F)
Applicant started drinking in high school. His drinking increased during his first stint
in college (2002-2008) (Tr. 35-36) When he returned to college in 2010, in his mid-20s,
he concentrated on his studies, and stopped partying and drinking. He limited his drinking
to events like “happy hours” with friends, rather than “all-night house parties.” (Tr. 37-38)
Applicant testified that his drinking increased after college, but was also relatively
infrequent. On average, he would consume four drinks per week in social situations with
friends,  but  some  weeks  he  would  not  drink  at  all.  (Tr.  38-40)  He  also  said  he  drank
heavily in his 20s, up to about 2010. (Tr. 90-92)
In  September  2006,  when  he  was  in  college  in  his  early  20s,  Applicant  was
tailgating at a college football game. He began drinking in the morning, a few hours before
the noon kickoff. He was placed into custody, along with others, and charged or cited for
public intoxication. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He spent the weekend in jail. He was sentenced to time
served. (Tr. 54, 93-95; GE 1 at 46)
In  May  2007,  also  while  in  college,  Applicant  was  out  drinking  with  a  group  of
friends. Applicant was driving. He executed a U-turn without using a turn signal and was
pulled over by police. He was given a sobriety test, and was then arrested and charged
with driving while intoxicated (DWI). (SOR ¶ 1.b). He subsequently pleaded guilty to the
offense, was convicted, and sentenced to a year of probation. (GE 1 at 47; GE 3) He feels
“stupid” about what he did. He testified that he went to counseling and learned not to drink
and drive. If he is out drinking now, he will use a car service or a designated driver.  He
has not had a DWI arrest since. (Tr. 53-58, 96-102)
One   night  in   April  2008,  Applicant  was  with   his  girlfriend   in  a   parked   car  in  a
restaurant  parking   lot.  They   were  engaged   in   intimate   contact.  An   investigating   police
officer noticed  their  activity, and  Applicant was charged  or cited  with  public lewdness.  (GE
3)  (SOR ¶  1.c)  Applicant denied  that  he  had  been  seen  driving  recklessly  beforehand.
Applicant believes he  was targeted  because  the  officer at the  scene  was the  same  officer
who  had  arrested  him  for the  May  2007  DWI.  (Tr. 58-59, 102-106) Applicant denied  that
he   [or  his   girlfriend]   had   been   unclothed   at   any   time.   He  admitted   engaging   in  “lewd
behavior”  at the time, and  acknowledged  that doing  so  in public is inappropriate. (Tr. 60)
The local district attorney declined to prosecute the case. (AE E; GE 3)
In April 2011, Applicant was  living  with  a  roommate  at the  roommate’s mother’s
house.  Late  one  night,  while  returning  from  work  at  about  3:30  a.m.,  they  got  into  an
altercation  on  the  street  outside  the  house  with  two  visitors.  When  Applicant  and  his
roommate drove up, they noticed a car parked nearby; its lights were off, but two people
were in the car. (Tr. 60, 64-65) After the parties made eye contact with each other, the
other driver sped down the street and parked again. Applicant yelled out of the window
and  asked  what  they  were  doing.  A  woman  then  got  out  of  the  car,  and  ran  at  the
Applicant.  He  put  his hand  out  in  a  defensive  gesture,  and  she  stumbled  or fell  to  the
ground.  (Tr.  61  66)  Her  passenger  accused  Applicant  of  hitting  the  woman.  The
passenger then said something like “I got something to take care of you all,” and walked
back towards the trunk of his car. (Tr. 60-61, 66; GE 1 at 48-49)
Believing the passenger was going to  get a weapon, Applicant then went inside
and came out with a shotgun. (Tr. 62, 66) When he returned outside, the other parties
were  in  the  midst  of  a  physical  altercation,  though  that  ended  when  they  noticed  that
Applicant  was  armed.  The  two  visitors  then  drove  away.  Applicant  and  his  roommate
decided to “remove [themselves] from the situation,” so they stayed elsewhere that night.
(Tr. 62, 116; AE A at 4)
A  week  or  so  earlier,  the  roommate’s  motorcycle  had  been  tipped  over  in  the
driveway. (Tr. 61). The next day, after this incident, the roommate’s motorcycle was tipped
over again and the garage of the house was also damaged. Applicant believes the visitors
from the previous night had done it.  Applicant said  the same visitors later came to the
house, in what he believed was an effort to extort money from them over the incident. (Tr.
63-69, 117)
The visitors later filed a police report. Applicant was charged with various offenses,
including  assault  causing  bodily  injury,  and  felony  aggravated  assault  with  a  deadly
weapon. (GE 3, AE I, Tr. 106-118) (SOR ¶ 1.d) Two years later, in  2013. the charges
were dismissed after Applicant’s lawyer filed a motion for a speedy trial. (Tr. 70; GE 1 at
48-49; GE 2 at 2; GE 3)
Applicant denied that he had pointed his weapon at anyone, and denied that he
had hit anyone with the shotgun. He denied that he had been drinking that night. (Tr. 67)
He said the visitors were not charged. He called the matter “the craziest situation I’ve ever
been involved in.” (Tr. 69)
In January 2015, Applicant and a friend drove to a nearby large city, about 75 to
90  minutes  away,  for an  evening out on  the town.  They initially  intended  to spend  the
night, though they did not have a hotel reservation. They spent the evening drinking at
local bars. The friend changed his mind about staying over, and wanted to drive home.
Applicant protested, knowing the consequences of driving while intoxicated or under the
influence. He knew, however, that he had no way to get home without his friend, short of
an expensive cab ride. Applicant decided to leave with his friend. (Tr. 71-72, 118-122; GE
1 at 42-43)
On the way home, Applicant’s friend was pulled over for swerving. The friend failed
a  roadside  sobriety  test.  They  were  both  taken  into  custody.  Applicant  was  cited  with
public intoxication, and he spent the night in a holding cell. (Tr. 72-73, 118-122; GE 1 at
42-43) (SOR ¶ 1.e) He later went to court, received deferred adjudication, and the case
was dismissed after 30 days. (Tr. 73-74; GE 2 at 5-6)
In  September  2017,  while  employed  by  company  H,  Applicant  went  to  a  South
American country for a work project. The work was intense, and involved a six or seven-
day workweek. Applicant and the other company workers were confined to the hotel or
their  work  site  in  the  field.  One  evening,  they  all  had  drinks  with  dinner  in  the  hotel
restaurant.  Applicant  was  having  relationship  troubles  with  his  girlfriend  and  getting
“upsetting text messages” from her. He decided to drink in his room to “cure my woes.”
(Tr. 45-46) He testified that he had four drinks over dinner and four more drinks in his
room. (Tr. 125, 138-139)
All employees were subject to a breathalyzer each morning when they reported to
the work camp, and anytime they left the camp premises. The next morning, Applicant
registered a 0.14 blood alcohol content (BAC) level. He was retested a short time later
and registered a 0.02 BAC. He was sent back to the hotel, and then was flown home to
the U.S. and terminated within days. (Tr. 46, 123-127) (SOR ¶ 2.b)
This  was  the  first  and  only  time  Applicant  consumed  alcohol  during  that
assignment. He knew he was in an environment where safety was paramount. He knew
employers were subject to a breathalyzer anytime they checked in at the job site but said
he did not know the company had a “zero tolerance” policy. (Tr. 47, 123-125, 138; GE 2
at 4)
At  his  employer’s  request  Applicant  met  with  a  licensed  professional  counselor
(LPC)  in  October  2017,  through  his  employer’s  Employee  Assistance  Program  (EAP).
The counselor determined that Applicant did not have an “alcohol problem,” but that he
could benefit from an alcohol class. (Tr. 47-48; GE 2 at 4; AE C) Applicant completed 10
hours of substance-abuse education in October-November 2017. (AE G) He testified that
he is eligible for rehire. (Tr. 49)
Applicant  testified  that  he  learned  in  alcohol  education  about  how  the  rate  of
alcohol intake works (the effect of X number of drinks over Y number of hours, essentially)
but also that consuming alcohol to excess affects not just the drinker, but others. He said
he no longer drinks during the week. He regrets his decision to drink during the week,
and  will  not  do  so  again.  He  learned  not  to  self-medicate  with  alcohol.  (Tr.  48-50)
Applicant stated he has not been intoxicated at work or under the influence of alcohol at
work since he was terminated in October 2017. (Tr. 51)
Applicant disclosed the termination on his SCA. He reported that he “did not realize
there would still be alcohol in my system at 7:00 am the next morning. I blew a .04.” (GE
1 at 19)
From  2015  to  late  2018,  Applicant  was  in  a  long-term  relationship.  He  and  his
girlfriend, J, lived together for most of 2018 but she did not pay rent. (Tr. 75-76) J had a
teenage son from a prior marriage, S. (GE 4 at 1) Applicant had a good relationship with
S and treated him like his own son, Applicant was involved in S’s upbringing. He attended
school functions, and was sometimes the “disciplinarian,” grounding her son or removing
privileges. He never engaged in physical discipline. Applicant also never hit his girlfriend.
(Tr. 75-77)
Applicant terminated his relationship with his girlfriend in about September 2018.
He held the lease to their apartment, and did not want to move out. J moved out in October
2018, but S remained living there with  Applicant temporarily  while  J’s employment and
living  situation  stabilized.  In  November  2018,  Applicant  notified  J  that  the  lease  was
ending in December 2018 and that she needed to find a place for her son. (Tr. 77-78) J
then  notified  Applicant  that  she  wanted  to  assume  the  lease  and  move  back  in  to  the
apartment when he moved out. This was never formalized. (Tr. 79-80)
In  early  December  2018,  Applicant  came  home  one  day  and  found  all  his
belongings in the living room. There was a new lock on the door to Applicant’s bedroom
that Applicant believed J had installed. Applicant dismantled the lock and began moving
his belongings back in to the bedroom. (Tr. 79-80)
J came to the apartment later to get some of her things. Applicant let her in and an
argument  ensued.  S  was  also  there,  and,  according  to  Applicant,  S  was  yelling  at
Applicant and “taking his mother’s side.” Applicant testified that he was “vocal” with S and
thought he was being ungrateful. S and J then left. (Tr. 80-81)
The police later came to the apartment. The police report reflects a statement from
J in which she reports hearing Applicant yelling at her son, and yelling that he was going
to  beat the  s--- out of  him. She  reported  that S  was  crying and  holding his side  as he
came down the stairs leaving the apartment, and that S had said Applicant had hit him
with the door multiple times as S was leaving the apartment. (GE 4 at 4, 12, 13) Applicant
was arrested and charged with domestic assault and battery/abuse. (GE 3 at 8) (SOR ¶
1.f)
The officer’s summary in the police report indicates that when S was examined by
paramedics, he was “very tender to the touch on the right side of his ribs.” (GE 4 at 4) He
was also complaining of pain in the right side of his body. S was transported to the hospital
in an ambulance. (GE 4 at 12)
Applicant denied the allegations at the scene. (GE 4 at 5) Applicant denied hitting
S in any manner. He denied engaging in any misconduct, though he acknowledged being
frustrated and angry at the time. (Tr. 79-89) He believes the allegations are fabricated.
Applicant said he had nothing to drink that night. (Tr. 124-136) The case was dismissed
in February 2019. (GE 1 at 44-45; GE 2 at 2-3)
In preparation for his hearing, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation with
Dr. E, a Ph.D. in counseling psychology and a major in the Army. (AE B) Dr. E was asked
to evaluate: 1) whether Applicant met the criteria for alcohol use disorder; 2) and, if so,
what his prognosis was; 3) whether he was at risk for future alcohol-related incidents; 4)
if his prior alcohol use could be considered “maladaptive,” whether he had established a
pattern  of  reasonable,  modified  consumption  regarded  as  acceptable  by  clinical
standards; 5) whether Applicant met criteria for any other disorder making future criminal
behavior  more  likely;  and  6)  whether  he  had  a  diagnosis  that  could  pose  a  risk  to  his
judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, or ability to protect classified information. (AE A at
1-2)
The  basis  for  Dr.  E’s  opinion  was  a  clinical  interview  of  Applicant,  clinical
observations, a mental status exam, a personality assessment, an alcohol screening test,
and  review  of  documents  provided  by  Applicant  and  counsel,  as  well  as  Applicant’s
personal,  family,  social,  educational,  employment,  medical,  mental  health,  substance
abuse history, and legal information. (AE A)
Dr. E concluded that Applicant did not present symptoms consistent with an active
alcohol use disorder (AUD). Applicant may have had a mild AUD in the past, but if so,
given the lack of alcohol incidents in the last four years, he would be considered in full,
sustained remission. (AE A at 7) He was found to be at some risk for future alcohol-related
incidents,  compared  to  those  with  no  alcohol  history.  His  current  alcohol  consumption
was regarded as clinically acceptable and consistent with public health recommendations.
He met no criteria for any mental health condition. (AE A at 7)
Applicant  was  not  regarded  as  being  prone  to  “rule-violating  behaviors.”  His
“indiscretions” of  2006, 2007, and  2008  (public intoxication, DWI, and public lewdness,
respectively) were regarded as instances of “interpersonal immaturity and poor decision
making.” Dr. E questioned the legitimacy of the 2012 aggravated assault charge, noting
that it had been dismissed. The 2015 public intoxication charge was not indicative of “true
wrongdoing,” and “not indicative of criminal behavior,” though riding with an intoxicated
driver was “foolish.” The 2018 domestic battery charge was “disputable and dismissed”
and Dr. E found that it does not suggest tendency towards aggression or criminality. (AE
A at 7-8)
Dr.  E.  concluded  that Applicant  “does  not  have  any  mental health  or substance
abuse conditions, personality problems, or behavioral patterns that could negatively affect
his  judgment,  reliability,  or  trustworthiness  in  regards  to  safeguarding  classified
information or working in a sensitive position.” (AE A at 8)
Applicant described  his current drinking  as “almost  nonexistent.” He  said  he  had
consumed  three  drinks  since  November 2020  (about seven  months before his May  2021
hearing). (Tr.  39-40) He  acknowledged  that  the  impetus for his  altered  drinking  habits  was
receiving   the   SOR.  (Tr.  41)  He  said  he   had   to   “retrain”  himself  to   order  non-alcoholic
drinks, such  as lemonade. He does not believe  that he  had  an  alcohol problem, and  he
experienced  no  withdrawal symptoms. He does not feel a  desire  to  order alcohol. (Tr. 42-
43) He has also  lost  weight  and   spends his   free   time   being  active   and   working   on   his
house. He intends to continue his current path regarding alcohol use. (Tr. 43-44)
Applicant’s  current  direct  supervisor  provided  a  reference  letter.  The  supervisor
regards  Applicant  as  highly  dedicated  and  professionally  proficient.  He  has  a  positive
attitude  and  is committed  to  getting jobs  done  well and  on  time. He  manages multiple
assignments, and exceeds expectations. He is unselfish and is a hard worker. He is highly
reliable and trustworthy. The reference recommends Applicant for a clearance. (AE D)

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.b, with explanations. He denied SOR ¶ 2.a.
The admissions are adopted as findings of fact.  After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  48  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  defense  contractors  since  April
2010.  He  worked  for  contractor-one  (C1)  from  2010  to  May  2017;  he  worked  for
contractor-two (C2) beginning in June 2017 and lasting until August 2017 (C2 took over
the contract C1 previously held); and in August 2017, he started working for contractor-
three (C3), for whom he continues to work. He reported in his 2017 security clearance
application  (SF-86)  that  he  held  a  security  clearance  beginning  in  2010.  He  holds  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  electrical  engineering  and  is  currently  working  on  a  master’s
degree. He is single, never married, and has one adult child. (Tr. 31, 38-40, 77; AE1, 3)
The   SOR   alleged,  under  Guideline   J,   that  in  October  2016,   Applicant   was
charged   with   four felony   drug-related   offenses  and   that   he   ultimately   pleaded   guilty   to
one  charge  of  facilitation  to  possess  marijuana  for sale,  a  class  6  felony. (SOR  ¶  1.a)  It
also   alleged,  under  Guideline   E,  the   same   conduct  alleged   under   Guideline   J  (SOR  ¶
2.b)  and   that   he   failed   to   timely   report  his  October   2016   arrest   and   his  May   2017
conviction to  his employer, as required. (SOR  ¶  2.a).
Applicant admitted pleading guilty to the class 6 felony (the lowest degree felony
under  state  law  (See  A.R.S.  §  13-702))  drug  facilitation  charge  on  May  12,  2017.  A
judgment of conviction was entered that day. The arrest that resulted in this conviction
occurred  on  October  21,  2016.  He  was  sentenced  to  six  months’  probation,  fees  and
fines.  He  was  represented  by  a  criminal  defense  attorney  on  these  charges  and  was
advised by counsel not to disclose his arrest to his employer until after a judgment was
entered, which turned out to be May 12, 2017. He successfully completed his probation
and on December 19, 2017, his conviction was set aside. (Tr. 28, 39-40; GE 4; AE J)
The  underlying  facts  that  led  to  Applicant’s  plea  and  conviction  are  that  on  the
morning of October 21, 2016, while Applicant was asleep in his home, law enforcement
personnel  raided  his  home  possessing  a  search  warrant.  A  search  of  an  inoperable
vehicle in his garage resulted in finding a large quantity of marijuana and some cocaine.
Applicant  claimed  he  had  no  knowledge  of  drug  activity  at  his  home.  He  had  recently
been out of town attending a pro football game and his work location was approximately
70 miles from his home  so during the week he  stayed  at  a rented room he had at his
work location. Additionally, he had given out three keys to his house to friends because
he had been burglarized before when he was away.  Despite these facts and upon the
advice  of  his  attorney,  he  entered  into  a  plea  agreement  where  three  charges  were
dismissed  and  he  pleaded  to  the facilitation  charge.  Before  he  agreed  to  the  plea,  his
attorney advised him that because the law of the state created a legal presumption that
home and car owners were presumed to know the contents of their homes and cars, it
would be difficult to win at trial with an argument that he had no knowledge of the drug
activity. (Tr. 45-57)
The  record  contains  no  evidence  of  any  prior  drug  activity  by  Applicant  and  he
testified  that  he  has  not  been  involved  with  any  drug  or  criminal  activity  since  his
conviction in May 2017. (Tr. 50, 82)
To  understand  the  sequence  of  events  as  they  impact  the  allegation  that
Applicant failed to report his arrest and conviction, I find the following timeline existed:
April 2010 to May 31, 2017--Applicant was employed by C1. (GE 1);
October  21,  2016--Applicant  arrested  at  his  home  on  drug  charges.
(GE 5);
After the October 2016 arrest--Applicant’s attorney advised him not to
disclose  the  arrest  until  after  judgment  was  entered  on  his  plea
agreement. (Tr. 59);
May 12, 2017--Applicant pleaded guilty to the facilitation charge and a
judgment was entered against him. (GE 4);
May 31, 2017--Applicant completes a job application and background
check  for  C2,  who  has  replaced  C1  on  the  government  contract
Applicant is working on. In the application, Applicant disclosed that he
was convicted of facilitation and that he was sentenced to six months’
probation and fines. He listed the place of the conviction and offered to
provide more information, if needed. (Tr. 59; AE K);
June 1, 2017--Applicant is hired by C2 (Tr. 79; GE 3 (p.7));
August  1,  2017--Applicant  is  hired  by  C3,  his  current  employer.  No

"I  adhere  to  the  findings  of  fact  in  my  original  decision,  and  I  have  added  a
discussion  of  the  matters  submitted  by  Applicant  in  his  May  20,  2021  email.  I  have
admitted Applicant’s additional evidence as Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through F.
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f,
alleging multiple arrests for various offenses between April 2008 and November 2018. He
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a, alleging purchase and use of marijuana with varying
frequency from 2001 to about 2013 or 2014. He admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 3.a
and 3.b,  alleging that he falsified his SCA on  in  February 2007 and  February 2017  by
deliberately failure to disclose his drug involvement. His admissions in his answer and at
the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a  33-year-old vehicle  refueler employed  by  a  defense  contractor since
October 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married,  but
he  has  lived   with   a   cohabitant  since   October   2016.  He  and   his  cohabitant  have   a   16-
month-old daughter. (Tr. 19.)  In  his post-hearing  submission, he  included  a  photograph
of a  document reflecting the christening of  his daughter. (AX F.)
Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in
2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014. He stopped
using it because his employer started random drug testing, and he realized that it could
jeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.) In his first SCA in February 2007, he answered  “No” to  the
question whether he had used a drug or controlled substance within the past seven years.
(GX  1  at  23.)  He  testified  that  he  could  not  remember  why  he  did  not  disclose  his
marijuana use. (Tr. 28.) He also testified that there was no reason why he continued to
use marijuana until 2014, except stupidity. (Tr. 30.)
Applicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with brandishing a firearm. His
arrest occurred after he was involved in a bar fight, and one of the participants told police
that  he  had  brandished  a firearm. The  police  stopped  him  as  he drove  away  from  the
scene of the fight. He testified that he has never owned a firearm. The police  searched
the  vehicle  and  did  not  find  a  firearm.  He  appeared  in  court  and  was  found  not  guilty
because the police were unable to find a firearm. (GX 4 at 3; Tr. 34-35.)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  February  2009  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana. After the police stopped him for speeding, they found marijuana in the center
console of his car. He appeared in court and adjudication was deferred. He was placed
on probation for one year, required to attend drug-education classes, and was subjected
to  random  urinalysis.  He  successfully  completed  his  probation  and  the  charges  were
dismissed. (GX 4 at 3; GX 5.) He did not disclose this arrest in his February 2017 SCA.
He testified that he did not disclose his February 2017 arrest because he was told that
his arrest record would be expunged. (Tr. 31.)
In  November  2010,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana and having defective equipment on his car. After Applicant completed a period
of probation and drug classes, the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 12.) Applicant
did  not  disclose  this  arrest  to  his  employer.  He  testified  that  he  was  unaware  of  any
requirement  to  disclose  arrests  to  his  employer.  He  testified  that  did  not  disclose  this
arrest or his continued use of marijuana in his February 2017 SCA, because he was afraid
that it would jeopardize his clearance and his job. (Tr. 32-33, 39.)
In  January  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  with  reckless  driving,  having  an  open
container  of  alcohol  in  his  car,  and  possession  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was  with  his
cousin, and he told the police that the marijuana was his, because he did not want his
cousin to get in trouble. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant was convicted of the open-container offense
and reckless driving, but the marijuana charge was dismissed. (GX 13.)
In  November 2013,  Applicant was arrested for  maliciously  causing  bodily  injury  to
his  cohabitant.   He  testified   that   his  cohabitant  was  driving   home   after  they   had   been
drinking  at a  bar, they  began  arguing, his cohabitant began  swerving, and  he  grabbed  the
steering  wheel to  keep  the  car from  striking  a  guardrail. The  police  officer  who  noticed  the
swerving  stopped  them,  noticed  a  cut  on  the  cohabitant’s forehead,  and  concluded  that
Applicant had  hit her in  the  face. Applicant spent a  week in jail after his arrest.  (Tr. 53-
55.) The  charge  was later reduced  to  assault and  battery. In  February  2014, the  court
found   “facts  sufficient to  find   guilt,” but deferred   adjudication  for one   year. The   charge
was dismissed in February 2015. (GX 7.)
Applicant  submitted  his  second  SCA  in  February  2017.  He  answered  “No”  to  a
question  whether,  during  the  last  seven  years,  he  had  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled substances. He also answered “No” to a question whether he had ever used
or  otherwise  been  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a
security clearance. (GX 2 at 26.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2018, he
told the investigator that he had never been charged with an offense related to alcohol or
drugs. When  the  investigator  confronted  him  with  evidence  of  his  arrest  record,  which
included drug offenses, he disclosed his marijuana use, beginning in his teenage years
and ending in 2014. He told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use
while holding a security clearance because it did not matter, since he had stopped using
marijuana. He also told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use because
he misread the question. (GX 3 at 12-13.)
In July 2018, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on his cohabitant.
Applicant testified that he was driving home after work after a long work day and spending
some time after work at a friend’s house. He fell asleep and hit the rear of an 18-wheel
truck.  His  cohabitant  came  to  the  scene  and  was  taking  him  home  when  they  began
arguing, because his cohabitant refused to take him to a hospital. Applicant became angry
and cracked the windshield of their car by punching it with his fist. His cohabitant called
the police, who concluded that they had been fighting. (Tr. 57-63.) A protective order was
issued, prohibiting Applicant from having any contact with his cohabitant for three days.
(GX 9.)
Applicant  testified   that  he   was  charged   and   the   protective   order  was  issued
because  his cohabitant “got all  hysterical”  and  told  the  police  that he  had  smacked  her.
He  admitted   that,   on   several  occasions,   he   grabbed   her  and   shook  her  after  she   said
things intended  to  provoke  him. (Tr. 50-51.) In  September 8, 2018, he appeared  in court
and  pleaded   no   contest.   The   judge   found   “facts  sufficient  to   find   guilt”  and   deferred
adjudication   until  September  2020.  (GX   8.)   Applicant  completed   his  probation   and   the
charge  was dismissed.  (Tr.  63.) Applicant  and  his cohabitant  stayed  apart for about seven
or eight months  after  his arrest.  (Tr.  64.) He  testified  that  most of their  arguments  arose
from his cohabitant’s desire that he stay at home instead of socializing  with friends away
from   home   and   her  practice  of  saying   things   that  she   knew   would  provoke   him.   He
testified that the arguments and physical violence  stopped after their  daughter was born.
(Tr. 51-52.)
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI). His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was 0.17. In the jurisdiction where he
was arrested, jail time is mandatory for a BAC at or above 0.15. In March 2019, Applicant
was convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 175 days suspended, and a $250
fine.  He  was  placed  on  unsupervised  probation  for  one  year.  His  driver’s  license  was
restricted for one year, and he was required to install an ignition interlock on his vehicle.
(GX 10.) He served his jail sentence on weekends. (Tr. 66.)
Applicant admitted that many of his arrests were related to alcohol, but he does
not believe he has an alcohol problem. He has reduced his drinking since the birth of his
daughter. He testified that he drinks mainly on weekends and limits himself to about two
drinks  or  two  beers.  (Tr.  67.)  He  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  an  alcohol-abuse
disorder or received treatment for it.
A  friend  of  Applicant  who  has  known  him  for  12  years  submitted  a  statement
describing Applicant as “a very respectful and honest gentleman” and “the type of person
that  will  give  you  the  shirt  off  his  back.”  The  friend  does  not  indicate  whether  he  is  a
supervisor, co-worker, or a friend. The friend does not indicate whether he is familiar with
Applicant’s criminal record. (AX A.)
Applicant’s mother submitted a statement acknowledging that Applicant has done
things “that have not been pleasing to the way of his teaching,” but stating that he is now
a  family-oriented  person  who  is  striving  to  be  a  better  person.  His  mother  states  that
Applicant speaks often of his job and his love for it, and that he is proud of his 15 years
of service with his employer. (AX B.) Applicant submitted two photographs of a clock and
a montage of photographs containing the numeral 15, which he received in recognition of
15 years of service. (AX C, D, and E.)

In June 1993, at age 17, Applicant was arrested and charged with attempted first
degree  murder,  assault  with  intent  to  murder,  rape,  or  rob,  and  robbery  with  a  deadly
weapon. He robbed a liquor store and shot at a liquor store employee. While on house
arrest for his June 1993 charges, Applicant was arrested in August 1993, at age 18, and
charged with armed carjacking and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or
crime  of  violence.  His  friends  picked  him  up  from  his  home  in  a  car  they  had  stolen.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.b; Tr. at 35-58, 84; GE 2, 4, 5).
Applicant’s June and August 1993 charges were consolidated and he pled guilty
in November 1993 to assault with intent to murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, use
of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, and armed carjacking.
He  was  sentenced  to  20  years  in  jail,  with  10  years  suspended  and  five  years
mandatory. He served four years and eight months, the remainder of his sentence was
suspended,  he  was  released  in  December  1997,  and  he  was  placed  on  two  years  of

commission of a crime of a felony or crime of violence, carrying a handgun, and giving
false  statements  to  the  police.  He  and  a  female  acquaintance  were  arguing  in  her
apartment,  the  argument  escalated  into  a  fight,  they  attempted  to  grab  the  same  gun,
the gun discharged and they were both shot in their hands. He went to the hospital for
treatment, where he lied and told the medical staff and the police that he was the victim
of a robbery. (SOR ¶ 1.d; Tr. at 35-76; GE 1, 2, 3, 6)
Applicant  was  convicted  of  second  degree  assault,  use  of  a  handgun  in  the
commission  of  a  crime  of  violence,  and  giving  false  statements  to  the  police.  He  was
sentenced  to  20  years  in  jail  for  the  handgun  charge  and  10  years  for  the  assault
charge,  to  run  consecutively.  He  served  approximately  14  years  and  was  paroled  in

Applicant  attributed  his  criminal  involvement  in  1993  and  2000  to  a  lifestyle  in
which he was a drug dealer since the age of 14. After his February 2014 release from

the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  has  worked  for
this employer since November 2017. He is a high school graduate. He married in 1996

The SOR alleged, under Guidelines J and G, that Applicant was involved in four
alcohol-related  arrests  between  2002  and  2019  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d,  2.a).  The  SOR  also
alleged, under Guideline E, that he falsified his August 2019  Electronic Questionnaires
for  Investigation  Processing  (e-QIP)  when  he  failed  to  list  his  previous  arrests  as
required  by  the  questions  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a-3.b).  The  criminal  conduct  was  also
multiplicitously  pleaded  in  SOR  ¶  3.c.  The  allegations  are  supported  by  a  September
2019 federal arrest report, statements to a defense investigator during his background
investigation in October 2019, admissions he made in his answers to interrogatories in
May 2020, and his December 2020 SOR answer. (GE 2-4; SOR Answer)
Applicant described his alcohol history as beginning when he was either 18 or 19
years  old.  He  increased  his  amount  of  consumption  in  approximately  1996  after  he
married.  When  he  was  approximately  26  years  old  he  abstained  from  alcohol  use  for
religious reasons. This lasted until he was 30 years old. (Tr. at 27-29)

details  of  this  arrest.  He  admitted  the  conduct  in  his  SOR  answer.  (Tr.  at  33;  GE  2-3;
SOR answer)
2011   Disorderly   Conduct;   Intoxication  by   Alcohol  or  Drugs;  DUI   arrest.
Applicant could not recall the details of this arrest.  He believed he received a ticket for
disorderly  conduct.  He  denied  the  conduct  in  his  SOR  answer.  A  federal  arrest  report
describes  the  arrest  and  it  appears  that  only  the  disorderly  conduct  and  intoxication
offenses went to court. (Tr. 40-41; GE 2, 4; SOR answer)
2014   DUI,   Driving  on  Suspended  License,  Failure   to   Appear,  and  other
related charges. Applicant described being stopped by law enforcement while having a
wine cooler in his car. A federal arrest report describes the arrest. (Tr. 40-41; GE 2, 4;
SOR answer)
2019   DUI.   Applicant  described  having  several  glasses  of  wine  and  bourbon
whiskey  at  a  friend’s house  in  June  2019. After  he  left  the  house,  he  was  stopped  by
law  enforcement  for  having  tinted  windows.  During  his  October  2019  interview  with  a
defense  investigator,  he  recalled  taking  a  breathalyzer  test,  which  showed  a  result  of
.08 percent blood alcohol. During his hearing testimony, he recalled that he declined the
breathalyzer  test.  He  admitted  committing  this  offense  in  his  SOR  answer.  He  was
convicted  and,  among  other  things,  he  was  sentenced  to  four  years’  probation.  He
remains on probation. (Tr. 37-39; GE 2-4; SOR answer)
Applicant  offered  a  progress  report  from  the  court  showing  he  had  completed
approximately 63 hours of  education and counseling sessions as of  October 2020. He
also  provided  a  compliance  form  showing  he  had  attended  a  victim-impact  panel  in
August  2020,  as  required  by  his  sentence.  He  has  not  participated  in  any  alcohol
treatment programs and he also does not participate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He
claims  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  since  his  June  2019  arrest.  He  claims  he  uses
meditation to control any urge to consume alcohol. (Tr. at 56-47; SOR answer)
Applicant listed his 2019 DUI arrest when he completed his SCA in August 2019.
He did not list the earlier alcohol-related offenses (2002, 2011, 2014). He testified that
he  was  under  pressure  to  complete  his  e-QIP  and  did  not  recall  the  earlier  incidents,

check  point,  heading  to  a  known  party,  and  were  illegally  searched.  Applicant  was
found in possession of the above-mentioned illegal drugs, and was arrested.  Applicant
stated  that  news  reports  regarding  this  procedure  indicate  that  the  head  of  the  police
department in that area was fired following this arrest.  (Tr. p. 44.)
Applicant  stated  that  in  his  opinion  the  DoD  Directive  is  severely  outdated  in
terms  of  effectiveness.  (Tr. p.  47.)  He  believes  that  he  is  sufficiently  trustworthy  and
reliable  to  properly  protect  Government  information,  regardless  of  his  history.  (Tr.  p.
47.)
Four letters of recommendation submitted by professional associates, coworkers
and  friends  collectively  attest  to  Applicant’s  excellent  work  performance,  strong
interpersonal  and  leadership  skills,  and  reliability,  and  honesty.  None  of  these
individuals is aware of the extent of Applicant’s illegal drug use.  (Applicant’s Exhibits A,
B, C and D; and Tr. p. 51.)
Applicant submitted a Statement of Intent to abstain from illegal drug involvement
and  substance  misuse  dated  October  4,  2021,  with  the  understanding  that  any  future
involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  national  security  eligibility.
(Applicant’s Exhibit E.)
",False
"Applicant  is  a  24-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance for the first time. (Exhibit 3 at Section 25) He is employed as a junior software
developer  for  a  company  doing  business  in  the  defense  industry.  He  has  had  this  job
since  about  January  2020.  Before  that,  he  was  enrolled  as  a  full-time  college  student
during  2015-2019,  which  resulted  in  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  December  2019.  He  has
never married and has no children.
Applicant  disclosed  a  history  of  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse  in  his
February  2020  security  clearance  application.  (Exhibit  5  at  Section  23)  His  drug  of
choice was marijuana, for which he reported the following details: (1) he used marijuana
with  varying  frequency,  from  daily  to  taking  extended  breaks  in  use,  from  about  May
2015 to January 2020; and (2) he sold marijuana to close friends while he was a college
student  during  2016-2018  for  two  brief  periods.  In  addition  to  marijuana,  he  reported
using the prescription drug Adderall without a prescription during 2015-2018. He did so
to help him stay up late to study. He also reported three to four instances of cocaine use
during 2015-2019, and a single use of LSD in 2016.
In addition to his substance misuse, Applicant disclosed a police record involving
marijuana. (Exhibit 3 at Section 22) He was arrested  for driving under the influence of
alcohol  (DUI)  and  possession  of  less  than  10  grams  of  marijuana  in  August  2018.  He
noted that both offenses resulted in suspended imposition of sentence in August 2019.
As I understand it, a suspended imposition of sentence is typically used in this particular
state for first-time offenders who  plead  guilty and  are  then placed on  probation. Along
with probation, the court required him to serve 40 hours of community service, complete
two educational courses, attend a victim-impact panel, and pay a fine.
Applicant provided additional details  about his marijuana  involvement during his
background  investigation.  (Exhibit  4)  Of  note,  in  a  May  2020  interview,  he  admitted
using marijuana about a week before the interview. He also admitted  buying marijuana
one  to  two  times  monthly  while  a  college  student.  Concerning  his  2018  arrest,  he
explained  that  he  was  placed  on  unsupervised  probation  for  two  years  (until  about
August 2021) and paid $600 in fines. He noted the arrest was a life-changing event for
him  because  it  was  a  wakeup  call  to  stop  being  stupid  and  focus  on  his  life  and  his
future.
In reply to written interrogatories, Applicant admitted continued use of marijuana.
(Exhibit  4)  He  stated  that  his  frequency  of  use  was  monthly,  and  that  his  last  use  of
marijuana  was  November  14,  2020,  which  was  the  month  before  he  answered  the
interrogatories.  Concerning  his  2018  arrest,  he  stated  that  he  was  still  serving
unsupervised probation.
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant wrote that he did not believe that the matters
in the SOR reflected who he is, his trustworthiness, his alignment with national security,
and  his  job  performance.  He  described  his  successes  at  work,  and  that  he  is  also
working to overcome the mistakes of his youth.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
1  Department  of  the  Navy   v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no
right to a security clearance).
2 484 U.S. at 531.
3 484 U.S. at 531.
followed   the   Court’s  reasoning,  and   a   judge’s  findings  of  fact  are   reviewed   under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.6  An
Applicant  is  responsible  for  presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or
mitigate  facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.7  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8
Discussion
Under Guideline H for drug involvement  and substance misuse, the  concern as
set forth in AG ¶ 24 is that:
[t]he   illegal  use   of  controlled   substances,  to   include   the   misuse   of
prescriptions and  non-prescription  drugs, and  the  use  of  other substances
that   cause   physical  or  mental  impairment   or  are   used  in  a   manner
inconsistent  with   their   intended   purpose,  can   raise   questions  about  an
individual’s  reliability   and   trustworthiness,  both   because   such   behavior
may   lead   to   physical  or  psychological  impairment  and   because   it  raises
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply  with laws, rules,
and regulations. . .  .
In addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of  National Intelligence
(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws
prohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state
can authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances
Act,  which  identifies  marijuana  as  a  Schedule  I  controlled  drug.  Second,  changes  to
state  laws  (and  the  laws  of  the  District  of  Columbia)  concerning marijuana  use  do  not
alter  the  national  security  adjudicative  guidelines.  And  third,  a  person’s  disregard  of
federal  law  concerning  the  use,  sale,  or  manufacture  of  marijuana  remains  relevant
when making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶  25(a) any substance misuse;
4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.14.
7 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
8 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.
AG  ¶   25(c)   illegal  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  including
cultivation,  processing,  manufacture,  purchase,  sale,  or  distribution;  or
possession of drug paraphernalia;
AG ¶  25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance
misuse,  or failure  to  clearly  and  convincingly  commit  to  discontinue  such
misuse;
AG  ¶   26(a)  the   behavior  happened   so   long   ago,  was  so   infrequent,  or
happened  under such  circumstances that it is  unlikely  to  recur or does not
cast  doubt  on   the   individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or   good
judgment; and
AG  ¶   26(b) the  individual acknowledges  his or her drug involvement  and
substance  misuse,  provides  evidence  of  actions  taken  to  overcome  this
problem,  and  has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence,  including  but  not
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)
changing  or  avoiding  the  environment  where  drugs  were  used;  and  (3)
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement
and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility.
The  SOR  allegations  under  Guideline  H  are  established.  The  evidence  shows
that  Applicant  has  an  extensive  and  recent  history  of  marijuana  use  (2015-2020).  In
particular,  I  note  his  continued  marijuana  use  after  submitting  his  February  2020
security  clearance  application  and  while  his  case  was  pending  adjudication.  He  was
using  marijuana  within  a  week  of  his  May  2020  interview.  Thereafter,  he  continued
using  marijuana,  monthly,  with  his  last  known  usage  occurring  in  November  2020.
Given his continued use of marijuana as recently as 2020, I conclude Applicant failed to
clearly and convincing commit to discontinue such misuse.
I  have  considered  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  involvement  with  marijuana  and  his
other substance misuse as outlined in the findings of fact. It includes using marijuana for
more than five years and as recently as about November 2020. The latter fact means he
smoked  marijuana  during  his  employment  with  a  federal  contractor  engaged  in  the
defense industry. Any illegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a person’s
security  worthiness,  but  it  is  particularly  egregious  if  it  occurs  during  the  course  of
employment with a federal contractor. Furthermore, it is likely that his marijuana use in
2020 was in violation of his employer’s drug-free workplace policy.9
Applicant’s case in mitigation is not persuasive. The one item that stands out in
his favor is his candor and willingness to disclose his drug involvement and substance
misuse during the security clearance process. But the credit in mitigation is limited due
to his continued marijuana use after completing his 2020 security clearance application.
9  ISCR Case No. 16-00578 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2017) at 2 (noting the Drug-Free Workplace Act requires
federal contractors with a contract over $100,000 to establish certain drug-free workplace policies).
I  also  considered  the  two  mitigating  conditions  noted  above.  Neither  applies  in
Applicant’s  favor.  His  marijuana  use  occurred  over  a  period  of  years  and  is  recent
enough  to be of  concern.  It also occurred  while  his security clearance application was
pending.  The  latter  circumstance  cannot  be  overlooked,  ignored,  or  explained  away.
With that said, I am less concerned about his more limited substance misuse involving
cocaine, LSD, and Adderall. That misuse was relatively infrequent and appears to have
run its course while Applicant was a college student. On this basis, I find for  Applicant
on  those  allegations.  Otherwise,  the  evidence  is  not  sufficient  to  mitigate  the  drug-
related security concern.
Under  Guideline  J  for  criminal  conduct,  the  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be
questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  involvement  with
criminal conduct. The overall concern as  set forth in AG  ¶ 30  is aptly put:  “By  its  very
nature, [criminal conduct]  calls into  question  a  person’s ability  or willingness to  comply
with laws, rules, and regulations.”
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶  31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an
admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of
whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;
AG ¶  31(c) individual is currently on parole or probation;
AG  ¶   32(a)  so   much   time   has  elapsed   since   the   criminal  behavior
happened,  or  it  happened   under  such   unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is
unlikely   to   recur  and   does   not  cast   doubt   on   the   individual’s  reliability,
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and
AG ¶  32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not
limited  to,  the  passage  of  time  without  recurrence  of  criminal  activity,
restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or
higher  education,  good  employment  record,  or  constructive  community
involvement.
The  SOR  allegation  under  Guideline  J  is  established.  The  key  facts  are  not  in
dispute.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  August  2018  for  the  misdemeanor  offenses  of  DUI
and possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana. About a year later in August 2019,
he  pleaded  guilty  and  received  a  disposition  that  is  typically  given  for  first-time
offenders. He states that he satisfied the various terms and conditions imposed by the
court,  and  it  would  appear  that  his  term  of  unsupervised  probation  ended  in  about
August 2021, a few months ago.
Nevertheless,  the  evidentiary  record  here  creates  much  uncertainty.  First,
Applicant  continued  using  marijuana  while  serving  probation,  which  is  troubling.
Second, he did not provide documentary proof that he successfully completed his term
of  probation  and  that  his  criminal  case  is  now  closed.  The  lack  of  documentary  proof
provides  additional  reasons  to  be  uncertain.  Third,  his  continued  use  of  marijuana
during 2020, after completing his security clearance application, means I cannot safely
exclude  the  possibility  that  he may  again face  arrest and  prosecution  for a  marijuana-
related offense. The evidence  is not sufficient  to mitigate the criminal conduct security
concern.
The  Guideline  E  matters  consist  of  a  sole  allegation  that  is  merely  a  cross-
allegation  to  the  various  matters  under  Guidelines  H  and  J,  adding  nothing  of  factual
substance to the case. The judgment, honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness concerns
under  Guideline  E  are  implicitly  if  not  directly  at  issue  under  Guidelines  H  and  J.
Accordingly,  the  Guideline  E  matters  are  decided  against  Applicant  under  the  same
rationale set forth under Guidelines H and J. Additional discussion is unnecessary.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent standard, I have  doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good   judgment,  and   ability   to   protect
classified   or  sensitive   information.   In   reaching   this  conclusion,  I  weighed   the   evidence
as  a   whole  and   considered   if   the   favorable  evidence   outweighed   the   unfavorable
evidence  or vice versa. I also considered  the whole-person  concept.  In  particular, I gave
weight to  Applicant’s  relative  youth  and  inexperience  in  the  ways of the  world, but  those
matters  are  outweighed   by   his  continued   marijuana   use   while   his  security   clearance
application   was  pending.  I  conclude   that  he   has  not   met  his  ultimate   burden   of
persuasion   to   show   that  it  is  clearly   consistent  with   the   national  interest   to   grant   him
eligibility for access to  classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline  H:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs  1.a, 1.f:
Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d:

Conclusion
It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for
access to classified information. National security eligibility is denied.

financially  overextended  and
is
The SOR alleged that Applicant had eight past-due debts, including tax debts and
mortgage foreclosures, totaling approximately $202,650. Applicant denied allegations 1.f
and 1.h. The existence and amounts of these debts is supported by credit reports dated
October 29, 2015; April 9, 2019; and March 16, 2021. (Items 7, 8, and 9.) Applicant stated
that most of his financial problems were connected to his divorce in 2013. (Answer; Item
3; Applicant Exhibit A.)
The current status of the allegations in the SOR is as follows:
1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed the Federal Government through the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) $20,405 for unpaid taxes. Applicant and his wife were divorced in
2013. As part of the divorce agreement Applicant was required to liquidate an  IRA and
pay  his  ex-wife  half.  He  provided  $18,000  to  his  ex-wife  and  used  other  monies  for
personal expenses. The debt consists primarily of taxes and penalties for early withdrawal
from  the  IRA.  Applicant  submitted  an  Installment  Agreement  Request  to  the  IRS
proposing to pay them $283 a month towards this debt. Applicant submitted copies of 15
money orders that were sent to the IRS on a monthly basis starting in January 2020. All
but one of them are in the amount of $285. The last one, dated April 15, 2021, is for $200.
Applicant had not received notification from the IRS that they have accepted his proposal
as of the date of Applicant Exhibit A. Applicant is making a good-faith effort to resolve this
debt. (Item 3 at 2, 7-9, 22; Item 10 at 16-17; Applicant Exhibit A at 2-4, 23-27.)
1.b. Applicant admitted that he had a mortgage foreclosed on in 2014 in the amount
of $136,500. Applicant bought the subject house with his then-wife. After the divorce he
could  not  maintain  the  payments  on  one  salary and  attempted  to  refinance  or  sell  the
property.  He  was  unsuccessful  and  lost  the  house  in  foreclosure.  (Item  3  at  10-11,
Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4.)
1.c.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  a  second  mortgage  charged  off  in
approximately 2014 in the amount of $34,743. This was in relation to the first mortgage
discussed in 1.b, above. Applicant stated that his ex-wife refused to help pay any debt.
He stated in his Answer, “I was financially uncapable (sic) of paying on my own salary. I
did have lawyers fees and child support that were present at the time as well.” (Item 3 at
10-11; Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4.)
1.d.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  charged-off  credit  card  debt  in  the  amount  of
$9,652. This credit card debt arose during his marriage. He stated in his Answer that he
is amenable to paying this debt, but there is no evidence that he has entered into any
payment arrangement with this creditor. This debt is not resolved.
1.e. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off commercial debt in the amount
of $1,032. This credit card debt arose during his marriage. He stated in his Answer that
his ex-wife  was  responsible for the  debt, but  she  refused  to  pay it.  He  is amenable  to
paying  this  debt,  but  there  is  no  evidence  that  he  has  entered  into  any  payment
arrangement with this creditor. This debt is not resolved.
1.f. Applicant denied owing a charged-off credit card debt in the amount of $471.
He stated in his Answer that he paid this debt. This debt does not appear in the most
recent credit report in the record, dated March 16, 2021. (Item 9.) Based on the available
information, I cannot find that Applicant currently owes this debt. This allegation is found
for Applicant.
1.g. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off wireless telephone debt in the
amount of $207. This debt arose during his marriage. He stated in his Answer that his ex-
wife was responsible for the debt, but she refuses to pay it. He is amenable to paying this
debt, but there is no evidence that he has entered into any payment arrangement with
this creditor. This debt is not resolved.
1.h. Applicant denied that he had a foreclosure in about July 2016. Applicant stated
that the person involved in this foreclosure is his father, who has the same name but a
different Social Security number. Documentation in the record confirms that the property
involved in this foreclosure actually belonged to Applicant’s father and his wife. (Item 11;
Item 12; Applicant Exhibit A at 6-7.) This allegation is found for  Applicant because the
debt is not his.
Three credit reports were submitted by the Government (Items 7, 8, and 9). The
credit reports show that Applicant’s financial condition is good other than the debts in the
SOR. Applicant has stated that he is current with his payments to the IRS and his child
support. (Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4.) His tax return documentation shows that his salary
has  been  steadily  increasing  over  the  years  he  has  been  employed  with  his  current
employer. (Item 10.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about  a  person’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted both allegations under this
paragraph.
2.a.  Applicant  was  arrested   in   March  2014   and   charged   with   seven   offenses
related  to  his driving  under the  influence  of  alcohol. He plead  guilty  to  Driving  Under the
Influence   of  Liquor/Drugs/Vapors  and   was  sentenced   to   five   days’  confinement,
unsupervised   probation   for  one   year,  fined   $2,300,   and   required   to   attend   alcohol
awareness classes. Applicant submitted  evidence  showing  that he  had  completely  paid
his fine and successfully completed the classes for this offense.  Applicant was fired  from
his job  with  his state’s Department  of Corrections due  to  this arrest  and  conviction. (Item
3 at 13-14, 21; Item 5; Applicant Exhibit A  at 4, 12, 13, 15, 18, 20, and 21.)
2.b. Applicant was arrested  in July  2016  and  charged  with  four offenses related  to
his driving  under the  influence  of  alcohol. He plead  guilty  to  Driving  Under the  Influence
of  Liquor/Drugs/Vapors and  was sentenced  to  confinement for one  day, 90  days of home
confinement,  unsupervised  probation  for two  years, fined  $3,475, 30  hours of community
service,   and   required   to   attend   24   sessions   of   substance   abuse   treatment.  Applicant
submitted   evidence   showing   that   he   had   completely   paid   his  fine,   and   successfully
completed   the   required   treatment  sessions  for  this  offense   as   well   as  his  community
service. (Item 3 at 19-20, 28; Item 6;  Applicant Exhibit A at  5, 11, 14, 16, 17, and 19.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline  G, Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  consumes  intoxicants  to  excess.  Subparagraph  3.a  stated  that  the
information set forth under subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b, above, are also cognizable under
this paragraph. Applicant denied the single allegation under this guideline.
Applicant  admitted  the  facts  of  the  two  alcohol-related  arrests  described  under
Paragraph 2. He has consistently stated that he has not drunk alcohol since his last arrest
in July 2016, a period of more than five years. In addition to the court-ordered counseling
in regard to his two DUI arrests, he has also obtained counseling through his employer’s
employee assistance program. That counselor submitted a letter to Applicant’s attorney
on September 9, 2016. He stated that Applicant “has never denied his alcohol use and
comes  with  a  positive  attitude.”  The  counselor  also  stated,  “He  [Applicant]  has  made
excellent progress in acquiring personal insights and better ways to cope with stress in
his life.” (Item 3 at 4-6, 9, 14; Applicant Exhibit A at 9.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. Applicant
denied both allegations under this paragraph.
In  January  1991,  when  Applicant  was  15  years  old,  he  was  charged  with
conspiracy to transport marijuana. He got involved in a conspiracy with two other juveniles
and one adult. Applicant was charged because he did not inform police of the plot.  He
plead  guilty  as  a  juvenile  and  received  one-year  probation,  which  he  successfully
completed. The record is silent as to whether this conviction occurred in Federal or state
court. The only evidence as to the existence of this conviction is that provided by Applicant
in his interview and written statements. (Item 3 at 20-21.)
Applicant did not admit this arrest and conviction on his September 2015 e-QIP
(SOR  4.a)  or  when  questioned  by  an  authorized  investigator  of  the  Department  of
Defense  in  June  2017  (SOR  4.b).  He  only  discussed  the  conspiracy  charge  with  the
investigator in 2017 after an initial denial.
In   his  Answer  Applicant  said  with   regard  to   allegation   4.a,   “I  believe   I
misunderstood if i had  to  mention  anything about charges as a minor or under the age of
18. My intention was never to hide anything.”
Applicant discussed  his interview  answers as follows in his Answer, “I did  not  know
I had  to  discuss juvenile  record because  the  application  did not say  charges of  a  juvenile
or under the age  of 18.”
Applicant further explained his reasoning in Applicant Exhibit A:
I want to clarify I did not try to omit any information about my juvenile record.
I was misinformed about my juvenile record. I was told [by] my attorneys
that once I turned 18 my case would be expunged. Furthermore my juvenile
case  has  never  been  an  issue  while  working  in  law  enforcement.  I’ve
believed I’ve provided all other pertaining information and never tried to hide
any information whether good or bad. (Applicant Exhibit A at 5.)

Applicant’s Answer to SOR dated February 22, 2021.)
Guideline H:  Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  has  an  extensive  history  of  illegal  drug  involvement  and  substance
misuse,  including  two  narcotic-related  arrests.  His  illegal  drug  use  includes  cocaine,
marijuana, and crystal methamphetamine, at various times, beginning in about January
1987, and continuing until November 2017.  He has also purchased cocaine from about
May 2007 to November 2017.
In April 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of a Narcotic
Controlled Substance.  Applicant cannot recall the particulars of this arrest and charge,
but he does not deny that it occurred.
In  January  2005,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  Possession  of  a
Narcotic  Controlled  Substance.  Applicant  explained  that  he  was  in  possession  of
paraphernalia and not drugs.  Applicant was with his girlfriend, and was driving a truck
with no license plates.  He took his girlfriend out to dinner, and on the way home they
were stopped by the police.  Applicant gave the officer permission to search the truck,
and  they  found  a  “bullet,”  a  plastic paraphernalia  storage  device,  shaped  like  a  bullet,
that is used to store narcotics.  Applicant stated that he does not know why it was in his
vehicle, since at the time, he was clean and sober.  The officer also found a baggie with
cocaine  in  it.  Applicant  was  arrested.  Applicant  pled  no  contest  to  the  charge  of
Possession  of  a  Narcotic.  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  pay  court  cost,  fines,  and
complete  community  service,  attend  Narcotic  Anonymous  meetings,  and
take
substance abuse courses through a court-required program.
In  October  2017,  Applicant  failed  a  random  drug  test  administered  by  his  then
employer.  The results of the test were positive for cocaine.  As a result, Applicant was
terminated  from  his  employment.
(Government  Exhibit  2,  and  Tr.  pp.  34  and  43.)
Applicant  states  that  he  has  no  intentions  of  ever  using  any  illegal  drug  in  the  future.

Guideline J:   Criminal Conduct
Applicant’s  history  of  criminal  conduct  creates  doubt  about  his  judgment,
It  also  calls  into  question  his  ability  or  willingness  to
reliability,  and  trustworthiness.
comply with laws, rules, and regulations.
In  addition  to  his  illegal  drug  involvement,  Applicant  has  an  extensive  criminal
history involving a number of alcohol-related arrests.
In  about  March  2001,  Applicant  was  arrested  the  first  time  and  charged  with
Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol/Drugs  (DUI.)  Applicant  was  convicted  and
sentenced to three years probation.
In  about  September  2006,  Applicant  was  arrested  a  second  time  and  charged
with DUI.  Applicant had been out with his girlfriend, shooting pool and drinking.  As they
left  the  bar,  Applicant did  not  have  his  seatbelt  on.  As  he  drove  away  from  the  stop
light, he was pulled over by the police.  The officer smelled alcohol on Applicant’s breath
and administered the field sobriety test and the breathalyzer.  Applicant failed the tests
and was arrested and taken into custody.  At court, Applicant pled no contest, and was
sentenced to pay court cost, fines, and placed on probation for 36 months.
In about September 2012, Applicant was arrested  a third time and charged with
Hit and Run, Property Damage.  Applicant had been consuming beer at a local bar for
about five hours prior to the car accident that led to the Hit and Run, Property Damage
charge.  He got into a verbal altercation with another patron.  When he was leaving the
bar at about midnight, he was concerned that he may be followed by the individuals who
were  arguing  with  him.  As  he  left  the  bar,  Applicant  was  intoxicated  and  was  not  in
control or paying attention while driving.  Applicant side swiped a parked vehicle on the
curb.  He made it home, and had no encounter with police.  Several days passed, and
Applicant felt bad about what had happened, and decided to call the police.  Applicant
was  advised  to  make  an  in-person  report  at  the  local  police  precinct.  Applicant
complied,  and  was  arrested  for  and  charged  with  Hit  and  Run,  Property  Damage.
Applicant  was  sentenced  to  pay  restitution,  was  placed  on  36  months  probation,
required  to  pay  court  costs,  and  fines,  and  required  to  do  100  hours  of  community
service.
In about December 2013, Applicant was arrested a fourth time and charged with
DUI  Alcohol/Drugs.  Applicant  had  two  beers  over  a  four  hour  period  while  at  a  car
show.  Applicant then left and went to a bar where he consumed six to seven beers over
a two hour period.  When he left the bar, he peeled out of the parking lot, and launched
into  traffic  at  an  excessive  speed,  and  was  pulled  over  by  the  police.  Applicant
underwent  a  field  sobriety  test  and  breathalyzer  and  failed.  He  was  arrested  and
charged with DUI.  In court, Applicant pled no contest, and was sentenced to 36 months
probation, required to complete 18 months of an alcohol education class, and served 3
weeks in jail.  Due to overcrowded facilities, he served  only 3 days in jail, and was let
go.  An ignition lock was placed on his vehicle.
The SOR alleges that in about March 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  DUI.  This  was  not  an  additional  arrest.  Apparently  on  this  date,  Applicant  was
convicted of the incident that occurred on December 2013.
Information  set  forth  above  under  Guideline  H  is  also  adjudicated  under  this
guideline.
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption
Applicant’s history of excessive alcohol abuse leading to questionable judgment,
and  the  failure  to  control  impulses,  raises  questions  about  his  reliability  and
trustworthiness.
Applicant  began  consuming  alcohol  after  graduating  from  high  school.  By  age
twenty-one  he  was  drinking  every  weekend  and  consuming  between  eight  and  twelve
beers  on  the  weekends.  Applicant  would  rarely  drink  alcohol  during  the  weekdays.
Applicant explained that he  would frequently go  “clubbing”  where he  would dance and
drink.  As  time  passed,  Applicant’s  drinking  increased  to  the  point  where  he  was
regularly  consuming  between  twelve  to  eighteen  beers  on  the  weekends.  When  his
daughter was born, he slowed his drinking down for a period, but he has never tried to
stop drinking completely.  (Tr. p. 64.)  Applicant does not believe that he has an alcohol
problem.  He explained that his goal  is to stop drinking completely, but he is not there
yet.  (Tr. pp. 61-66.)
Applicant has never attended an alcohol rehabilitation program.  He does not and
has never attended Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous voluntarily.  He has
only completed the  court ordered  alcohol education  courses  and  counseling related to
the  sentencing  imposed  by  the  court  for  his  violations.  Applicant  is  currently  working
with his pastor who is counseling him, and encouraging him to get baptized, which the
pastor believes will gradually help to improve other areas of  Applicant’s  life.  Applicant
states  that  he  no  longer  drinks  and  drives.  Now,  he  only  drinks  at  home  at  dinner.
Applicant’s  daughter  has  told  him  more  than  once  that  she  does  not  like  him  to  drink
alcohol.  She has asked him not to drink, especially on her upcoming quinceneara.  (Tr.
p. 67.)
Applicant  is  involved  in  his  church,  and  plans  to  get  deeper  into  his  faith  and
continue to improve himself.  He is embarrassed by his past misconduct.  He believes
that it has taken him some time for him to get his head straighten out.  He admits that
he has had an attitude problem.  Now, instead of abusing alcohol and drugs, he spends
time with his family.  He enjoys working on classic cars, he goes to car shows with his
brothers, and spends time with his daughter.  Applicant works a lot of overtime to stay
busy and realizes that when he stays busy, he stays out of trouble.
Information  set  forth  above  under  Guideline  J  is  also  adjudicated  under  this
guideline.

"Applicant denied all the SOR and ASOR allegations, except for SOR ¶ 1.b, which
he  admitted  with  explanations.  The  admission  is  adopted  as  a  finding  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old. He has worked for his current government contractor-
employer  since  May  2019  as  a  quality  engineer.  He  had  worked  overseas  for
government contractors from approximately May 2011 to May 2013.  He is seeking his
first  security  clearance.  He  holds  both  associate’s  and  bachelor’s  degrees.  He
completed  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2019.  He  is  married  with  no  children.  (Tr1  98,  Tr2
120; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged, under Guideline  J,  that in March  2013, Applicant  was working
as  a   civilian   contractor  in  an   overseas  location   and   was  “charged”  with   larceny   of
government property  and   conspiracy.   It  further stated   that  his   contract  was  terminated
by   his  employer  and   he   was  sent   back  to   the   United   States.  Additionally,  on   July   5,
2014, the  deputy  commander of  the  location  where Applicant had  worked  debarred  him
from  all  such  overseas  locations in that theater. (SOR ¶  1.a)  The  SOR also alleged  that
in August 2014, Applicant was charged with harassment.  (SOR ¶  1.b)
The  ASOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  E,  SOR  ¶  2.a-2.c,  essentially  the  same
conduct  alleged  against  Applicant  under  Guideline  J  above.  Additionally,  it  alleged
Applicant  was  terminated  from  a  delivery-driver  position  in  December  2016  for  late
deliveries  and  a  missing  package  (SOR  ¶  2.d).  It  was  further  alleged  that  Applicant
falsified  his  May  2019  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  by  failing  to  disclose  the
material details concerning his termination from his position listed in Section 13A (# 8),
of the SCA (SOR ¶ 2.e).
Overseas  Allegations and Investigation  (SOR ¶ 1.a; ASOR 2.b-2.c)
In March 2013, Applicant was employed as a supervisor over third-party-national
employees  (3PN)  working  at  an  overseas  Army  base.  He  worked  as  a  receiver  in  the
Defense  Reutilization  Marketing Office  (DRMO) yard  and  warehouses  at  the base. He
was one of three U.S. employees working at the DRMO site. His supervisor (S) was one
of  the  other  U.S.  employees.  DRMO  is  where  all  Army  units  take  surplus  or
unserviceable  supplies  and  equipment  to  be  properly  disposed  of  off  their  unit’s
inventory and accounted for by the Defense Logistics  Agency (DLA). Items turned into
DRMO are either destroyed or reutilized by another unit. (Tr1 41-42; Tr2 103)
On March 22, 2013, Applicant was contacted by members of the Army Criminal
Investigation Division (CID) concerning questions they had about a possible attempted
theft  of  a  government  generator  found  off  the  military  installation  on  a  non-authorized
vehicle.  The  generator  was  recovered,  but  CID  was  looking  into  who  may  have  been
involved with the attempted theft. Applicant was sought out because he signed the DD
Form  1348  (1348)  receiving  the  generator  into  the  DRMO  yard  for  destruction.  He
admitted signing the 1348, but did not specifically remember this one because he had
signed for other generators. The generator was brought to DRMO to be turned in by the
possessing unit. The soldier who turned it in had not been through the process before
and  admitted  in  his  sworn  statement  that  he  skipped  a  step  and  therefore  the  turn-in
process  was  not actually completed. The  soldier was  unaware  that  he needed  to  take
an  additional  step  to  clear  the  property  from  his  unit’s  inventory.  Applicant  does  not
normally  receive  property  via  1348s  in  the  yard,  which  is  normally  done  by  3PN
employees, but he filled in doing the job when the 3PNs took their lunch breaks. S was
also contacted by CID because he was the overall contractor manager of DRMO. When
S  was  later  interviewed  by  CID  he  opined  that  Applicant  had  nothing  to  do  with  the
attempted theft of the generator. (Tr1 45-46, 48; Tr2 31-33, 103-106)
Applicant  fully  cooperated  with  CID  by  agreeing  to  be  interviewed,  preparing  a
sworn  written  statement,  and  consenting  to  a  search  of  his  property,  including  all  his
electronic devices. He denied being involved with the attempted theft of the property or
of conspiring to take the property. Aside from an uncorroborated reference to Applicant
by  an  unidentified  3PN  as  a  person  involved  with  the  generator  and  Applicant’s
signature  on  the  1348,  there  was  no  evidence  of  his  involvement  with  the  generator.
Despite this lack of evidence, Applicant and S were told by their contractor (K) that the
government had told K that Applicant and S were to be removed from the project and
the  country.  Applicant  and  S  both  soon  left  for  the  United  States.  After  Applicant  was
back in the United States in April 2013, the company CEO emailed Applicant as follows:
On the situation [referring to the generator incident]. The accusations were
not what  sent you  home. The  government requested that you and [S] be
removed from the project and the country. [My company] had no say in the
matter.
As a result of the government request to K, sometime in late March or early April
2013, Applicant and S were sent back to the United States. They received their final pay
from  K  and  did  not  go  back  to  work  for  the  company,  although  Applicant  believed  he
could  work  for  K  again  in  some  other  capacity  if  he  wanted  to  do  so.  Applicant  was
never informed when he was overseas that he was formally charged with any offense.
When  he  was  overseas  in  March  2013,  there  is  no  evidence  that  he  was  formally
charged with any crime. When he got to the United States, he was never charged with
any criminal offense related  to  the  generator incident.  At  the time he  left  the overseas
location in approximately April 2013, he was unaware of any administrative action taken
against  him  by  any  government  agency.  Applicant  credibly  testified  that  he  was
confused as to the reasons why he was sent home from overseas. (Tr1 44; Tr2 31-32,
34, 44-46, 48-50, 55, 96-97, 126; AE A)
The third U.S. employee (E3) who worked at the DRMO with Applicant and S, but
who  was  not  investigated  because  he  was  out  of  the  country  when  the  generator
incident  happened,  testified  at  the  hearing.  Although  E3  was  gone  when  the  incident
occurred, he was back and present when Applicant and S faced questioning by the CID.
He  opined  that  Applicant  would  not  be  part of  any  attempted  theft.  He  stated  that  the
communication between K and the employees was poor and that K did not clarify with
the employees why Applicant and S were sent home. He noted that in discussing things
with  Applicant  before  he  was  sent  home,  Applicant  expressed  confusion  about  what
was happening and he was not getting any answers from K. (Tr1 153-154, 156, 164)
The  CID  concluded  their  investigation  and  issued  a  final  report  on  March  12,
2014, nearly a year after the incident and after Applicant returned to the United States.
That report, which was redacted and excluded exhibits, is GE 3. In the report, an Army
judge advocate opined that probable cause existed to believe that Applicant committed
the  offenses  of  larceny  of  government  property  and  conspiracy.  There  is  no  evidence
that this probable cause opinion was ever reviewed by a judge or magistrate. Applicant
was not informed of this opinion at this time, nor was he sent a copy of the investigation.
He was living in the United States at this time but had not worked for K since he left the
overseas  location.  On  July  15,  2014,  a  commander’s  report  of  disciplinary  action  was
completed, which stated that:
[Applicant]   was  subsequently   fired   by   his  employer  and   sent  back  to   the
United   States
termination   of  employment,   Deputy
Commander [redacted] signed  a  notice  of  debarment for life  which covers
all installations.

the
Applicant was not notified of this administrative action at the time it was taken. (Tr2 49-
50, 54, 58; GE 3; AE C (pp. 000001 to 000007))
Applicant  stayed  in  touch  with  his  former  supervisor,  S.  During  one  of  their
discussions  sometime  in  2015,  S  told  Applicant  that  a  job  opportunity  was  affected
because he was named in the CID report as a suspect and that report was inputted into
the  FBI  data  base.  This  came  to  light  during  his  job  opportunity.  S  discovered  how to
obtain a copy of his report, which he did. S ultimately filed an appeal with the CID and
had his name removed as a subject. S told Applicant about this and Applicant filed three
of  his  own  requests,  in  November 2015,  December 2015, and  July 2020.  He  received
his  first  response  in  January  2016,  which  included  a  redacted  copy  of  the  CID  report
(AE  C).  He  has  told  that  to  have  his  name  removed  from  the  report  required  him  to
provide  new  evidence  to  which  he  had  no  access.  Applicant  testified  that  he  recalls
receiving  everything  in  2015,  except  for  the  commander’s  report  of  discipline  (AE  C
pp.000001 to 000007), which he believes he did not receive until the 2020 response. He
was not sure what debarment meant and what impact it had on him. (Tr1 58-60; Tr2 54-
55, 66, 76-78; AE C)
Applicant’s  Answers  on his May 2019 SCA  (ASOR ¶  2.e)
In answering the relevant questions concerning his employment with K in section
13A  (employment  activity  #  8),  Applicant  stated  his  reason  for  leaving  was,  “contract
ended.”  In  employment  activity #  7,  Applicant  admitted  being fired for delivering a  late
package.  In  section  22,  police  record,  Applicant  disclosed  his  2014  arrest  for
harassment  and  included  specific  details.  In  section  25,  Government  Debarment,
Applicant answered “yes” to if he had ever been debarred from government service. His
optional  comment  was:  “I  was  part  of  an  investigation  but  I  wasn’t  sure  about  being
debarred  or  not.”  He  listed  the  government  agency  taking  the  debarment  as  “CID”  in
“04/2013  (estimated).”  He  then  went  on  to  explain  the  circumstances  of  the  2013
incident involving the generator and his lack of understanding about what happened and
what  impact  a  debarment  had  for  him.  He  credibly  testified  that  he  had  no  intent  to
provide  false  information  in  response  to  Section  13A.  He  believed  the  information  he
provided in section 25 about his perceived debarment would be taken together with his
information  regarding  section  13A,  since  they  both  involved  the  same  underlying
incident.  When  questioned  by  an  investigator  during  his  background  check  in  August
2019,  Applicant  disclosed  specific  details  about  the  generator  incident  without  being
prompted  by  the  investigator.  The  report  specifically  notes  when  Applicant  was
confronted  with  specific  facts  by  the  investigator,  but  such  notation  is  absent  when
discussing this issue. (Tr2 81-82, 128-129; GE 1, 4)
August 2014 Harassment  Arrest (SOR ¶  1.b)
Applicant credibly testified that an ex-girlfriend claimed that he has harassing her
by  sending  numerous  unwanted  text  messages.  She  filed  a  formal  complaint  and  in
August  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  on  a  misdemeanor  charge  of  harassment.  He
delivered evidence to his attorney in the form of texts and messages that showed that
the complainant had initiated contact with him. His attorney presented the information to
the  District Attorney’s  office. The District Attorney filed a motion to dismiss the charge,
which  was  granted  in  December  2014.  Applicant  has  had  no  further  similar  incidents.
(Tr2 71-72; SOR answer with attached dismissal order)
December 2016 Termination from Courier Position  (SOR ¶ 2.d)
From 2013 to 2016, Applicant was employed as a courier for a package delivery
company.  During  his  background  interview,  Applicant  explained  that  he  was  first
suspended  and  ultimately fired  from  his  courier  position  because he  had  two  reported
incidents  within  a  one-year  period.  The  first  incident  involved  a  missing  package  from
his truck, which he had scanned when he picked it up. The intended recipient reported
not receiving the package. Applicant did not know what happened to the package. This
was during the Christmas season in 2015, when they were very busy and it could have
been delivered to a wrong address and not returned or someone could have taken the
package from the truck when he was out  of it. He denied taking the package.  He was
written  up  for  this  incident  as  a  performance  issue.  Less  than  a  year  later,  a  second
performance issue was documented against Applicant. In this instance, he was tasked
with  delivering  a  package,  which  had  already  been  attempted  once,  but  no  one  was
available  to receive  it. On this second  delivery attempt,  Applicant did  not  get to  it until
the end of the day because the package had slid in the truck and he did not see it until
all the other packages were delivered. When he did deliver it, the recipient complained
that it was late and Applicant was written up for the incident. He was initially suspended
from work by his employer, then terminated a day or so later because company policy
was that two reported incidents within one year were grounds for termination. Applicant
reported this incident on his SCA and during his background interview. He has had no
similar incidents since these. (Tr2 22-25, 111-116; GE 1, 4)
Character Evidence
Applicant  also  presented  character  testimony  from  his  wife  and  several  work
colleagues,  including  supervisors.  His  wife  described  Applicant  as  a  loving,  kind,
generous, hard-working, honest, and good husband. Three coworkers (two supervisors)
from Applicant’s current employer, who  are familiar with  the reason Applicant is having
this  hearing,  all  described  him  as  an  honest,  energetic,  and  a  trusted  employee  with
whom they have no reservations about him obtaining a security clearance.  (Tr1 95-98,

"Applicant, age 59, married his second wife in 2013. His first marriage of six years
ended by divorce in 2009. He has one adult son from his first marriage. The record did
not  indicate  his  educational  history.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  senior  information
technology administrator by a defense contractor since April 2003. Applicant previously
held a security clearance during his military service. He served in the U.S. Air Force from
1989 through 1996, when he reportedly received an honorable discharge. (Item 3)
The SOR alleged identical facts, under Guidelines J and E, concerning Applicant’s
1994  conviction  for  felony  sexual  offenses  involving  a  minor.  In  his  SOR  answer,
Applicant  admitted  the  Guideline  J  allegation.  Although  he  did  not  respond  to  the
Guideline E allegation, I consider it admitted given his Guideline J response. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant had contact with the victim as an advisor to their church’s youth group,
in which she served as president. A criminal investigation was initiated after the  victim
reported that Applicant raped her. Applicant stated: “Apparently, [the victim] had sought
counseling  and  revealed  our  prior  relationship  to  her  counselor  and  subsequently,  her
parents.” Throughout the record, Applicant repeatedly referred to his sexual contact with
the victim as consensual and, aside from his guilty plea, never acknowledged raping her
or any other nonconsensual sexual contact. (Item 7 at 1-2; Item 8 at 3)
Applicant  reportedly  told  the  victim  that  if  she  told  anyone  that  he  raped  her,  it
would ruin the church and her family.  According to one witness (Witness A), Applicant
admitted that he raped the victim. During a phone call he initiated to Witness A, Applicant
indicated that the victim accused him of rape. Witness A then asked Applicant whether
he  raped  the  victim.  Believing  that  his  reply  would  be  kept  in  confidence,  Applicant
admitted  to  Witness  A  that  he  raped  the  victim.  During  a  subsequent  call  Applicant
initiated  to Witness  A a  few days  later,  Applicant  asked Witness  A  to  see  if  the  victim
would be willing to meet with Applicant and talk about the possibility of an out-of-court
settlement. (Item 5 at 3, 9, 10)
In  March  1994,  Applicant  was  arrested  and charged  with  multiple  felony  sexual
offenses  after  an  investigation  indicated  that  he  raped  the  victim  on  four  occasions
between August 1992 and August 1993, and attempted to rape her in September 1992.
The charges reflected Applicant’s custodial authority over the victim because of his role
as the  church’s  youth  group advisor; and that the victim was a minor. Applicant stated
that she was age “16 years and 9 months” at the time of the offenses for which he pleaded
guilty. (Item 5 at 3; Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 3; Item 2)
Applicant was originally charged with four counts of engaging in sexual activity with
a victim age 12 to 18 years old as a person in a position of custodial authority; and one
count  of attempting sexual activity  as a person  in a position of custodial authority. In July
1994,  Applicant   pleaded   guilty   to   amended   charges  pursuant  to   a   plea   agreement   in
exchange   for  which  certain  charges  were  nolle   prossed.  In   August  1994,  the   court
accepted  Applicant’s plea  and  sentenced  him  to  five  years of  prison  followed  by  ten  years
of probation, and ordered  him  to  undergo counseling and register as a sex offender. The
charges  to   which  Applicant  pleaded   guilty  were:  two   counts   of  sexual  activity   by   a
custodial authority  (a first-degree  felony); and  one  count of attempting  sexual activity  by
a  custodial   authority   (a  second-degree   felony).  Special   conditions  of  his  probation
included  that Applicant  could not:  1) have  either direct or indirect contact with  the  victim;
2) have  unsupervised  contact with  females under 18  years of  age;  or 3) supervise  anyone
under age 18, unless approved by his probation  officer. (Item 5 at  1-2,12-13; Item  7 at 4;
Item 8  at 3)
Although it is unclear for how long Applicant remained incarcerated or the date his
probation ended, the record indicated that he was released on good behavior from prison
about  two  and  one-half  to  three  years  into  his  sentence  and  successfully  completed
probation in about November 2009. Immediately following his release from prison, he was
required to report to his probation officer on a monthly basis, and then was transitioned,
in  about  May  2000,  to  an  administrative  probation,  which  afforded  him  the freedom  to
travel. He underwent court-ordered counseling with a sex-offender therapist in connection
with his probation, weekly at first and then monthly, for an undefined period. (Item 5; Item
7 at 3-4; Item 8 at 3)
Throughout  the  record,  Applicant  expressed  remorse,  and  professed  to  have
accepted full responsibility, for his criminal conduct. He also insisted that he had been
open and honest about it in his personal and professional life. Conversely, he repeatedly
characterized the sexual contact underlying his conviction as consensual and claimed to
have had a romantic relationship with the victim based on a mutual attraction.
In a November 2004 signed sworn statement (apparently provided in connection
with a previous background investigation), Applicant stated:
I am  deeply  remorseful  for  my  actions  in  1992  that  led  to  the  criminal charge
and  subsequent  incarceration  and  probation.  At the  time  [the  victim]  told me
that if  our relationship was discovered  she  would tell  the  authorities that she
consented.  I  realize   under  [my   home   state’s  laws]  she   was  not  legally
recognized  as being  of  the  age  to  grant consent and  I  hold  no  ill will against
her for  the  charge  brought against  me  due  to  our relationship.  I have  not
had  any  contact with  her since  right after the  break-up  and  I do  not plan  to
ever  have   contact  with   her  in   the   future.  .  .  My   1994   charge   of  sexual
battery/coercion   is  common   knowledge   to   my   family,  friends,  and   co-
workers. . . . As a  registered  sexual offender, my  offense  is a  public record,
which  is  something   I  have   come   to   accept  through   my   incarceration   and
therapy.  (Item  7)
Applicant also averred that his 1994 conviction resulted from  a  “relationship” he
had  with  the  victim. He claimed  that they “started  out as friends and  then  developed  a
mutual attraction which led to a sexual relationship over a period of about two months in
early  1992.”  He  asserted:  “I  ultimately ended  the  relationship  because  I  felt  guilty  and
knew it was not a healthy union for either of us. I also left the church to put some distance
between  us.”  He  maintained:  “At  the  time  of  my  extra-marital  affair  my  wife  had  no
knowledge of it. After I was charged was when she found out and she subsequently left
me and filed for divorce.” His ex-wife was granted custody of their son. (Item 7)
Applicant  explained  in  his  2004  statement  that  he  was  experiencing  marital
problems  during  his  self-described  consensual  relationship  with  the  victim,  yet  also
stated: “I realized that does not excuse my behavior.” Applicant contended: “I have rebuilt
my life and done everything in my power to ensure I am never involved in a situation that
could lead to criminal charges in the future.” (Item 7 at 2, 4)
During  his August  2019  security  clearance  interview  (in  connection  with  the  current
background  investigation), Applicant  reiterated  that he  had  an  extra-marital affair  with  the
victim. While  he  acknowledged  having  sexual relations  with  the  victim  on  three  separate
occasions,  he   maintained   that  they   were  consensual.  He  claimed   that   he   ended   the
relationship  with  the  victim  after deciding  that  it was inappropriate. He characterized  the
“criminal activity” for which he  was convicted  as sexual battery/coercion  of a  female age
17. Although  he  acknowledged  that he  had  no  justification  for this “criminal activity,” he
also rationalized  that it  occurred  because  he  had  low  self-esteem  and  was struggling  with
his wife  and  marriage. He  averred  that  he  had  spent  10  years trying  to  figure out  what
happened.  He  affirmed  that he  would not ever allow  his criminal activity  to  recur,  avoided
any  and  all  risky  environments or any  perceived  evil, no  longer volunteered  or had  any
contact associated with a vulnerable population. (Item 8  at 3)
In his SOR answer, Applicant stated:
I came to the conclusion [sic] long time ago that my past is something I can’t
change or hide from. Furthermore, my criminal history is public information.
I have always been upfront and forthcoming about my past to my employer,
supervisors and anyone else that should be aware of my past. [About] 27
years ago I stepped up and paid my debt to society and faced my past with
brutal honesty. The brief consensual affair with the [] victim []was illegal and
morally wrong. I fully acknowledge that I was the adult in the situation and I
should have recognized the situation for what it was.
Applicant proffered that he has been entrusted with the protection and integrity of
unclassified data and company proprietary information for more than 17 years and has
received praise from  cyber-security professionals. He  asserted that  his “advanced  skill
sets and deep experience” could serve the national interests if he were granted a security
clearance.  He  proclaimed  that  he  served  with  distinction  in  the  Air  Force  because  he
maintained a clearance and received numerous awards. He received the Airman’s Medal
for swimming hundreds of yards while attempting to save a drowning man. In just three
years  of  service,  he  was  awarded  the  Air  Force  Achievement  Medal,  Air  Force  Good
Conduct  Medal, and the  Airman of  the  Year Award  (for the  Air Force  Security Police).
(Item 2)
Applicant also declared:
. . . I have lived my life with determination to avoid letting that moment in
time to define me. I have doggedly strove to grow and become the man I
was supposed to be, and to honor the trust and respect of those around me
who continue to put me in a position of trust in my personal and professional
life.  .  .  .  If  given  the  chance,  I  will  not  disappoint  you.  I  will  carry  out  my
responsibilities  with  distinction  and  honor  the  trust  and  respect  you  have
shown me by considering this request.

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through
1.c, and he admitted in part and denied in part the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.d. (HE 3) He also
provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  The  three  alcohol-related  arrests  and
one  apprehension  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d  are  duplicated  in  SOR  ¶¶  2  (criminal
conduct) and 3 (personal conduct). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  34-year-old   network  engineer,  who   has  worked   for  a   defense
contractor  for the  previous six  years. (Tr. 14, 16; GE  1) In  2003, he  graduated  from  high
school. (Tr. 52) He was married  from  2004  to  2009. (Tr. 15, 52) He does not have  any
children. (GE 1) He served  on  active  duty  from  2005  to  2012. (Tr. 24) In  November 2012,
Applicant was discharged  from  the  Air  Force as a  senior airman  (E-4) with  an  honorable
discharge. (Tr. 15; AE  E)  He contended  that  his DD  Form  214  incorrectly  indicated  his
rank when  discharged  was senior airman; however, he  was actually a  staff  sergeant (E-
5). (GE  2 at 11) He received  multiple certifications in information technology, including  in
information   technology   security.  (Tr.  23-24;  AE   J)  He  received   a   security   clearance   in
December 2006. (GE 1  at 33) He has worked  with  sensitive  or classified  information  for
16 years, and  he  has never been  accused  of  a security violation. (Tr. 24)
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant  first  consumed  alcohol  in  high  school.  (Tr.  42-43)  He  began  drinking
alcohol to intoxication before 2005. (Tr. 43) He rarely drank to intoxication when he was
married from 2004 to 2009. (Tr. 44)
Around  May  2008,  Applicant  was  drinking  beer  while  fishing.  (Tr.  17)  When  he
returned to his Air Force base, security at the gate stopped Applicant and asked him if he
had been drinking. (Tr. 17) He said he was drinking, and he was apprehended for driving
while impaired. (Tr. 17; SOR ¶ 1.d; GE 2 at 13) He believed his blood alcohol  content
(BAC) was below the legal limit, and he was unsure how the authorities concluded he
was intoxicated. (Tr. 54; GE 2 at 11) He received a field grade Article 15 or NJP for drunk
driving and driving with an expired driver’s license. (Tr. 17, 25, 52-55; GE 2 at 6-7) His
punishment included a suspended reduction in rank to airman first class, and 25 days of
extra duty. (Tr. 52; GE 2 at 7) He did not appeal his NJP. (Tr. 63) He attended alcohol-
related training. (Tr. 17; GE 2 at 7) He lost his on-base driving privileges for six months.
(Tr. 25; GE 2 at 13) The record does not contain a copy of the police report or record of
nonjudicial punishment for his 2008 offense. (Tr. 55-56)
Around   September  2011,  Applicant  was  drinking,  and   he   believed   he   was  not
intoxicated.  (Tr. 18) The  police  stopped  his vehicle  for driving  70  miles per hour  (MPH)  in
a  45  MPH zone, and  they  arrested  him  for DUI. (Tr. 18, 27-28; SOR ¶  1.c;  AE  C at 18-
19) His BAC was .08. (Tr. 56-58; AE  C  at 3, 20) He  was convicted  of DUI,  and  a  civilian
court  imposed   two   years   of   probation,   a   $600   fine,   and   court  costs.   (AE   C  at  5)   He
successfully  completed  an  alcohol and  substance  abuse  class. (Tr.  18, 28; GE  1  at 30;
AE  C at 5, 9, 13)  His driver’s license  was suspended  “as a  matter of  law”  for an  unspecified
period.  (AE  C  at  5) After the  2011  DUI arrest,  he  modified  his alcohol consumption  by
consuming  less  alcohol. (Tr.  28-29) He  did  not disclose  the  DUI arrest and  conviction  to
his chain  of command  even  though  he  realized  at that time  that he  had  an  obligation  to
disclose it. (Tr. 26-27)
Applicant  disclosed  his  2011  DUI arrest on  his  August 16, 2016  SCA.  (GE 1  at 28-
29)  His  SCA  asked   whether  he   had   been   ordered,  advised,  or  asked   to   seek  alcohol
counseling  or treatment in  the  previous seven  years,  and  he  answered, no.  (Tr. 48-49;
GE  1  at 32) Applicant  said he  answered,  no because  he  believed  the alcohol counseling
or treatment question  was seeking information about one-on-one counseling. (Tr. 49)
Around January and April 2017, Applicant was drinking, and the police stopped his
vehicle on two occasions and arrested him for DUI. (Tr. 18-20; SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d) As
for the April 2017 arrest, he was cited for DUI and driving with a suspended license. (AE
A at 5) The police  alleged  Applicant failed  to yield  to  the  officer’s commands, and  they
pointed  their firearms at  him.  (Tr. 37; GE 2 at  5) Applicant did  not remember resisting
arrest or having firearms pointed at him. (Tr. 37-38) His first BAC from the April 2017 DUI
was .197, and his second BAC was .16. (GE 3 at 3, 5, 14; AE A at 2) Both DUIs were
adjudicated in the same proceeding, and resulted in two DUI convictions. (Tr. 59) The
driving with suspended license was nol prossed. (AE A at 10, 12) He received a combined
sentence,  which  included  12  months  of  probation,  a  $700  fine,  court  costs,  and  a
suspended jail sentence of 60 days. (AE A at 6; AE B at 4) He attended an alcohol and
substance abuse class for 12 hours. (Tr. 19-20, 35) He did not report the two alcohol-
related arrests in 2017 to his employer even though he knew he had a duty to report them.
(Tr. 46-47)
After Applicant completed about eight hours of therapy, his plan was not to drink
more than two drinks at a setting, and not to drink on more than two occasions per month.
(Tr. 21, 40, 51) He has never been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. (Tr. 51) He has
different friends from 2017, and his new friends are not focused on alcohol consumption.
(Tr.  41)  He  enjoys  exercise  and  healthy  outdoor  activities  unrelated  to  alcohol
consumption. (Tr. 41)
Applicant denied having alcohol-related blackouts or having withdrawal symptoms.
(Tr. 45) Over the past 15 years, he abstained from alcohol consumption for nine or ten
month periods and then resumed alcohol consumption. (Tr. 46) He completed alcohol-
related counseling on April 11, 2018. (AE H)
Applicant  signed  a  statement  of  intent  not  to  drive  while  under  the  influence  of
alcohol. (Tr. 22; AE D) He said, “I understand that any future involvement with drinking
and driving is grounds for revocation of my national security eligibility.” (Id.) He promised
to responsibly consume alcohol in the future. (Id.)
On March 9, 2020, a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), licensed substance
abuse professional (SAP), and certified substance abuse counselor (CSAC), provided an
assessment of Applicant’s alcohol consumption. (AE G) During the  interview, Applicant
said his BAC was “well below the legal limit” when Air Force security personnel arrested
him for DUI in 2008. (Id. at 2) He denied that he was drunk driving for the arrests in 2008
and  2011.  (Id.  at  3)  For  his  January  2017  DUI  arrest,  he  said  the  police  stopped  him
because his brake lights malfunctioned, and the police office did not see him stop for a
stop sign. (Id.) For his April 2017 DUI arrest, the LCSW  said “[u]nlike former situations,
however, in this instance his BAC was above the legal limit.” (Id.) However, she did not
indicate his BAC, which were .197 and .16. She indicated Applicant “has never engaged
in  binge  drinking  or habitual drinking  to  the  point  of  impaired  judgment.” (Id.  at  4) She
noted  that  after  the  two  DUI  arrests  in  2017,  he  successfully  completed  9  months  of
random drug and alcohol urine testing, 12 hours of alcohol and drug abuse classes, and
8 hours of one-on-one counseling with a psychologist. (Id. at 4) The LCSW diagnosed no
alcohol  use  disorder.  (Id.  at  6)  She  recommended  that  he  “engage  in  self  imposed
sobriety,” and that he receive access to classified information. (Id.)
Character Evidence
A  friend  and  Applicant’s  father,  a  retired  Army  lieutenant  colonel,  provided
character  statements  supporting  reinstatement  of  Applicant’s  access  to  classified
information.  (AE  I)  The  general  sense  of  their  statements  is  that  Applicant  is
knowledgeable, intelligent, honest, and dependable. (Id.) He volunteers in his community.
(AE K) His resume indicates he has had an excellent career in network engineering and
information technology. (AE L)
Applicant  received  the  following  Air  Force  (AF)  awards:  Meritorious  Unit  Award

"Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and SOR ¶¶ 4.a – 4.g,
all without further comment. He denied the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 4.h, 4.i, and 4.j,
all with narrative explanations. He did not answer SOR ¶ 2.b, but it is a cross-allegation
of subparagraphs ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, both of which he admitted. Applicant’s admissions and
explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old. He has never married and he has no children. (Tr. 52)
He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1996. He has taken subsequent graduate classes and
is about four credits shy of a master’s degree. (Tr. 53, 63; GE 3 at 11-12)
Applicant’s  employment  history   is  detailed   in  security   clearance   applications
(SCAs)  he   submitted   in  connection   with   his  employment,  in   January   2010   (GE   1),
February  2015  (GE  2),  and  January  2018  (GE  3)  and  an  SF-85P  application  for  a
position  of  public  trust  in  September  2018.  (GE  5)  Applicant  also  submitted  a
Declaration for Federal Employment (DFE) in September 2018. (GE 4)
From 2007 until July 2012, Applicant worked in various classified positions with a
variety  of  defense  contractors.  (GE  1  at  17-22,  46,  GE  2  at  15)  He  has  held  various
positions  in  the  IT  field,  mostly  as  a  contractor,  in  the  years  since.  Since  July  2017,
Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor,  defense
contractor  S.  (GE  5  at  10)  He  has  held  a  clearance  for  about  15  years,  and  he  also
holds a clearance with another government agency (AGA). (Tr. 13, 53-54, 141-142) At
the time of the hearing, he had an annual salary of $120,000. (Tr. 143)
From   July   2012   to   July   2013,  Applicant  worked   for  another  department  of  the
U.S.  Government  as   an   information   security   specialist.  He  testified   that   he   had
nationwide   responsibility   for  IT  security   regarding   the   Affordable   Care   Act   (ACA),
working   with  each  of  the  50  states.   He described  the  experience  as “a nightmare.” He
had  no  prior government experience,  and  little  to  no  support. He said he   had  “no  idea
what to  do.”  He missed  deadlines and  acknowledged  that  he  “failed  to  perform  up  to  the
expectations”   of  the   job.  He   said   it   was  “completely   my   fault.”  (Tr.  55-57)   Following   a
written   warning   in  January   2013,  Applicant  was  terminated   from   that  position   in  July
2013  for unsatisfactory  performance.  (SOR ¶¶  4.f,  4.g)  (GE 2  at 13-14) As Department
Counsel  acknowledged,  the   “internet  rollout”   of   the   ACA  had   significant  problems,  as
was  widely   publicized   at  the   time, and  Applicant  was  by   no   means  solely   responsible.
(Tr.  98-99)  Applicant  said  he   did  not   have   any   personality   conflicts,   and   praised   the
interpersonal and  professional skills of his co-workers there. (Tr. 99-100)
Shortly   thereafter,  in   July   2013,   Applicant  began   working   for  government
contractor   C.  He   said  he   loved   his   job,   which  involved   travelling   to   Army   bases
nationwide   and   testing   IT   equipment.   He  also  said   the   job   was  in  a   very   stressful
environment  with   lots  of   travel  and   little  sleep.  He  said  he   did  not  get  along   with   his
boss. Following  two  written  warnings, in September 2013  and  December 2013  (SOR ¶¶
4.f, 4.e), Applicant was placed  on  a  probationary  performance  plan. In  about April 2014,
he  and  his boss got into  a  heated  argument.  Applicant was  terminated  soon  thereafter
for failing  to  perform  to  expectations and  for losing  his temper. (SOR ¶  4.c) (GE  2  at 12-
13,  GE   7;  Tr.  58-59,  101-102)  He  did  not  dispute   his  employer’s  version   of   his  work
performance. (Tr. 60)  He believes they were looking to get him  to resign. (Tr. 101-102)
In   June   2014,  Applicant  began   working   part   time  for another federal  contractor,
T.  (GE   2   at  11;  Tr.  60-62,  107-110)  Beginning   in  December  2015,  he   also   began
working   full   time   for  another  contractor,  M.   (Tr.  61-62)  He   worked   both   jobs  until  July
2017, when  he  was terminated  by  contractor T for unsatisfactory  performance,  after he
missed   some   important  deadlines  for  the   customer  (another  large   defense   contractor)
because   he   did  not  have   enough   time   to   devote   to   the   work.   (SOR  ¶   4.a)  (Tr.  61-62,
110-112)  However, Applicant was otherwise well-regarded  by  contractor T.  (Tr. 110-112
and  AE  E, a July 2017  letter from the  president of contractor T)
Guideline K:
In May 2017, Applicant was working for contractor M at an Army facility. He said
he  was  not  in  a  “SCIF”  (Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facility)  but  did  have
access to what he  called  a  “simulated” SIPRNet, which he asserted had not been fully
accredited. (Tr. 108-109; Answer) While there, he received an unclassified e-mail from
Ms. M, his government supervisor, the contractor office’s representative (COR). (Tr. 44)
The e-mail listed all of the names of the systems within the lab that were supported by
his  then  employer.  Some  of  the  systems  processed  classified  information.  The  e-mail
was  labeled  as  “unclassified,”  but  the  spreadsheet  document  contained  the  names  of
some  classified  systems.  (Tr.  36)  Applicant  was  supposed  to  complete  appropriate
“patches” for that particular week on the document and then return it to Ms. M, per her
instructions, which he did. (Tr. 36, 46; Answer)
Applicant  acknowledged  in  his  testimony  that  he  should  have  encrypted  the  list
when he returned it, but he said the list was also not encrypted when he got it. “I didn’t
think it needed to be encrypted because of the publically available information and there
was  no  classified  information  in  the  e-mail.”  (Tr.  47)  He  said  that  he  believes  that  the
COR  should  have  known  that  “she  was  setting  someone  up  for  aggregation”  of
classified information. (Tr. 48)
Applicant  also  denied  that any classified  spillage  took  place, because  “nowhere
within  the  SEC  community  classification  guide  does  it  say  that  the  names  of  any
classified  systems  were  themselves  classified.” (Tr.  42)  This assertion  is unsupported.
He  said  it  was  the  aggregation  of  certain  information  that  was  classified.  (Tr.  43)  He
denied moving any classified information onto an unclassified system. (Tr. 44; Answer)
Applicant  said  he   was  he   was  “accused   of   committing   aggregated   spillage.”  He
indicated   in   his  testimony   and   in   his  Answer  that   he   was  pressured   to   sign   a   security
form   acknowledging   culpability   for  the   spill.  (Answer)   He  believes  he   was  “intimidated
into  telling  the  government that it was my  fault and  [that]  I’ll  never do  it again.” (Tr. 37,
48) The security form referenced  by Applicant is not in evidence.
The  Government’s  evidence  includes  a  May  10,  2017  memo  from  the  Army
command to Applicant’s employer that names Applicant as “the originator of a classified
spillage  that  occurred  on  5  May  2017.”  (GE  8  at  3;  GE  8  at  6)  In  its  memo,  the  Army
Information  Assurance,
cited  Army  Regulation  25-2,
Paragraph  4-14,  Personnel  Security  Standards;  subparagraph  b.(6):  “New,  credible,
derogatory information revokes any standing waiver and results in immediate denial of
access to IT systems.” (GE 6 at 3)
Information  Management,
As  a  result,  Applicant’s  access  to  the  government  customer’s  information
technology (IT) system was suspended that day, pending the results of an Army inquiry.
(GE 8 at 3) As a result, Applicant could not perform his duties for contractor M, so he
was terminated, on May 12, 2017. (GE 8 at 6, Tr. 49-52) (SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 4.b)
The  termination  memo  to  Applicant from  his employer began, “This  letter serves
as  your  official  notice   that  you   have   been   removed   from   contract  due   to   unintentional
classified   spillage.”  (GE  8   at  4)   (Emphasis  added)  This  conclusion   comports  with
Applicant’s testimony  that his actions were unintentional and  not  deliberate. (Tr. 50-51,
103-104) He  continues  to  believe  that  the  information  at  issue  in  the  incident  was not in
fact classified; and  he  attested  that others working  in the  lab  told  him  this as well. (Tr.
106-107)  However,  Applicant   stated   at  the   hearing   that   he   acknowledged   to   his
employer at the time that he was culpable  for the incident. (Tr. 105-106)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  verbally  informed  of  the  government  customer’s
concerns about the spillage incident, but was not given an opportunity to respond, either
verbally or in writing. (Tr. 103-104) He said he  “strongly disagreed  with  the  decision  to
terminate  him,  and  he  said  he  “did  not  spill  or  aggregate  classified  information.”  He
believes  that  the  government  supervisor  should  have  “retracted”  (i.e.,  redacted)  or
encrypted  the  information.  (Tr.  37-39)  He  said  he  was  not  aware  of  the  result  of  any
government investigation into the incident, and he is not aware that his clearance itself
was  ever  suspended.  (Tr.  54-55,  139)  Nor  is  there  documentation  of  any  such
investigation in the record.
Applicant said he had no other employment issues at contractor M before he was
terminated over the spillage incident. (Tr. 107) He said he was told he was eligible for
rehire.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant  also  noted  his  stellar  security  record,  with  no  violations,  and
said this would not happen again. (Tr. 39-40)
The Government did not offer testimony of any expert witness in the security field
regarding whether the spillage  was in fact classified; whether it was due  to  Applicant’s
culpability;  whether  Applicant’s  actions  were  deliberate,  negligent,  or  inadvertent;  and
what  damage  to national security  resulted from the spill,  if  any.  Beyond  the  May 2017
letter from the Army on the matter  (GE 8), the Government offered no evidence of the
conclusions of any investigating authorities. Nor did the Government offer any testimony
about applicability of any of the NISPOM paragraphs cited in the SOR.
Guidelines J & G:
In  August  2007,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence of alcohol. (DUI) (SOR ¶ 1.b) He explained that he was drinking at a pub one
evening and was pulled over on his way home after making a left turn at a red light. He
failed a roadside breathalyzer test. He was cited or ticketed, and allowed to take a cab
home. He said he was not arrested. He went to court in August 2007 and received one
year of probation  including a six-month alcohol awareness group therapy program. He
completed  the  program  early,  in  April  2008.  (Tr.  64-65;  GE  1  at  45,  93-96)  Applicant
was required to abstain from alcohol while on probation, but resumed drinking casually
once his probation ended. (Tr. 94-95)
In  June  2017,  Applicant  was  out  one  night  at  a  nightclub  and  restaurant  with  a
friend. Applicant had about three beers and two shots. While driving the friend home in
the early morning hours, he crossed the center line and was pulled over by police. After
failing  a  roadside  sobriety  test  and  refusing  a  breathalyzer,  he  was  arrested  and
charged with driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI) (SOR ¶ 1.a (Tr. 118-119) He was
later allowed to call a cab. Applicant acknowledged at his hearing that he had had too
much to drink, and that it was “completely my fault.” (Tr. 66) He pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to  two  years of  probation.  He also  spent three  weekends  in  jail.  (Tr. 65-66,
69)
In  July  2017,  Applicant  was  evaluated  and  found  appropriate  for  a  26-week
outpatient substance abuse treatment program. No diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder
was  indicated.  (Tr.  67-68,  72;  AE  B)  The  program  consisted  of  group  sessions.
Applicant was an active and positive participant and was regarded as a model client. He
completed the program successfully in early March 2018. (AE B)
In  November 2017, while  on probation for the  DWI, Applicant was  arrested and
charged  with  a  probation  violation,  after  he  attempted  to  purchase  a  firearm  in  a
neighboring state. (SOR ¶ 2.a) Applicant testified that during this period, when he was
“going  in  and  out  of  jail”  on  weekends,  he  would  make  himself  feel  better  by  “buying
things.” He saw a shotgun that he thought his father would like as a gift. The best deal
for the gun was in a neighboring state, where there was no sales tax, so he went there
to purchase the weapon. (Tr.  73-74) The attempted firearms purchase was disallowed
because of the background check. (Tr. 143-144) Applicant does not own any firearms.
(Tr. 74)
Applicant testified that he was not aware that his actions were prohibited while on
probation, because he did not read the full details of his probation document and other
available information detailing the restrictions. (Tr. 73, 124) His DWI charge came up in
the  background  check  for  the  firearms  purchase.  A  warrant  was  issued,  and  he  was
arrested. Applicant had to perform 10 hours of community service as a result, which he
completed in May 2018. (Tr. 68, 71; AE C, AE D) Applicant acknowledged the probation
violation was his fault. (Tr. 73) He testified that he reported the violation to his employer.
(Tr. 124)
Applicant  testified  that  there  was  no  other  negative  impact  on  his  probation  for
the DWI. He completed  probation  successfully in  August 2019. (GE  6 at 3;  Tr. 69) He
has had no other charges. (Tr. 143)
Applicant said he was required to abstain from drinking while on probation  for two
years, and  did  so. (Tr.  119-120)  He  said  that  since  his second  alcohol offense,  he  has
significantly   curtailed   his  drinking.  He  recalled   having   “a  drink  or  two”  at  home   on
Memorial  Day   and   on   the   July   4th   weekend   (2021),  but  otherwise,  “I  really   don’t  drink
much  at all.” And  he  does not  drink and  drive  “no  matter how  much  I’ve  been  drinking.”
(Tr. 71, 119, 123)  He said he  now  consumes alcohol once  a  week or less (“if  that.”). He
said he  consumes  at most,  three  beers, and  not  to  intoxication. (Tr. 120-122) Applicant
said he  was not currently  in any  alcohol counseling  or therapy  and  does not believe  he
has an alcohol problem. (Tr. 122-123)
Guideline E:
Having  submitted  an  SCA  in  January  2018  (GE  3),  Applicant  had  a  related
background interview on September 13, 2018. (GE 6 at 5-10) Days later, on September
17,  2018  (addendum  signed  September  18,  2018),  Applicant  submitted  a  Declaration
for  Federal  Employment  (GE  4),  for  a  job  application  with  another  government
department.  (Tr.  88-89)  He  then  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  Public  Trust  Positions
(SF-85P).  on  September  27,  2018.  (GE  5) The  record  does  not  contain  a  subsequent
background interview after GE 4 and GE 5.
The Guideline E allegations in the SOR concern Applicant’s allegedly deliberate
failure to disclose some of his arrests and some of his employment terminations on his
January  2018  SCA  and  his  September  2018  SF-85P  application.  Applicant  denied  all
allegations of deliberate falsification in the SOR. (Answer; Tr. 74)
Alleged  Falsifications relating to  Arrests:
SOR ¶ 4.h alleges in part, that in answering a series of questions on his January
2018  SCA  with  a  seven-year  timeframe  (“In  the  past  seven  (7)  years  …”),  Applicant
failed to disclose his first DUI in 2007. (GE 3 at 35) During questioning at his hearing, it
became  clear  that  Applicant  had  no  duty  to  disclose  that  offense  in  answer  to  those
questions, since it occurred in 2007, 11 years prior. (Tr. 75-82)
Applicant  acknowledged,  however,  that  he  also  did  not  list  his  2007  DUI  in
answer to other questions on GE 3, such  as “Other than those offenses already listed,
have you  EVER had the following happen to you? . . . Have  you EVER been charged
with  an  offense  involving  alcohol or drugs?” (GE  1  at 37)  Falsification  of  that  question
was not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  had   disclosed   his  2007   DUI  on   his  2010   SCA,   and   detailed   the
circumstances of  the  arrest,  his court case, and  alcohol awareness program. (GE 1  at
43-45; Tr. 96-98) He did not list the 2007 DUI on his 2015 SCA, in answer to a question,
“Have  you  EVER been  charged  with  an offense  involving  alcohol or drugs.” (GE 2  at 31-
32) When  asked  why  he  did  not  list the  2007  DUI in answer to  that question,  Applicant
said  he   “must  have   misinterpreted   the   question   and   that  it   was  another  seven-year
question.”   He  asserted   that   he   would   not   have   “intentionally   tried   to   hide   something   I
already  [had] previously  disclosed.” (Tr. 115, 116)  This omission  was not alleged  in the
SOR as a deliberate  falsification.
Applicant  also  explained  that  when  he  was  interviewed  in  2015  about  his
previous SCA, he was told by the interviewing agent that he did not have to discuss his
2007 DUI after that interview. (Tr. 75-78, 117-118) Applicant also volunteered the 2007
DUI  in  his  September  2018  background  interview  (GE  6  at  10)  and  listed  it  on  his
September 2018 SF-85P. (GE 5 at 27)
On  his January  2018  SCA,  Applicant disclosed  his 2017  DUI, but did  not disclose
his November 2017  probation  violation  arrest  for the  attempted  gun  purchase. (GE  3  at
35) This omission is alleged as an  additional deliberate  falsification in SOR ¶ 1.h.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  should  have  disclosed  his  2017  probation
violation  arrest  on  GE  3.  He  asserted  that  he  told  his  security  chief  and  program
manager about it, but this is uncorroborated. He denied intentionally failing to disclose it
and said he must have overlooked it or misinterpreted the question. (Tr. 82) However,
Applicant  acknowledged  that  in  January  2018,  the  charge  from  the  November  2017
probation violation was pending, and had yet to be adjudicated. (Tr. 144-147) As such,
he  should  have  disclosed  it  in  answer  to  the  question,  “Are  you  currently  on  trial  or
awaiting  a  trial  on  criminal  charges.”  (GE  3  at  35)  That  omission,  however,  was  not
alleged in the SOR as a deliberate falsification. The summary of Applicant’s September
2018  background  interview  reflects  that  he  voluntarily  disclosed  the  arrest  and  the
violation to the interviewer. (GE 6 at 9)
When   he   prepared   his  September  27,  2018   SF-85-P,  Applicant  disclosed   both
the   2007   DUI  arrest  and   the   2017   DWI   arrest,   but,   again,   not  the   subsequent  2017
probation   violation   arrest,  in  answer  to   a   question   about  his  criminal  history   with   a
seven-year timeframe.  (SOR ¶  4.j)  Of this  omission,  Applicant  said, “I  don’t  know  why  I
would intentionally  deny  it. Maybe  because  it  hadn’t gone  to  trial yet,  I’m  not sure.” (Tr.
83)   In   fact,   the   document  regarding   Applicant’s  completion   of   the   10   hours  of  work
release   shows  a   trial  date   of   March  27,  2018,  and   that  he   completed   the   required
community  service a  month  later,  so  the  charge  was no  longer pending  by  September
2018. (AE D)
Asked why he failed to list his 2017 probation violation arrest on either GE 3 or
GE 5, Applicant said, “I don’t know why I wouldn’t have, Your Honor. I discussed it with
both  investigators.  It  must  have  been  an  oversight  on  my  part  and  I’m  sorry.”  (Tr.  90,
130-131)
Alleged Falsifications relating to  Employment  Terminations:
SOR  ¶  4.i  concerns  several  employment-related  falsification  allegations  on
Applicant’s  September  2018  SF-85P.  (GE  5)  In  answer  to  a  question  calling  for
disclosure of all employment terminations in the past seven years, Applicant disclosed
his  2017  termination  from  contractor  M  (SOR  ¶  4.b),  but  he  did  not  disclose  his  other
terminations,  from  contractor  T  in  July  2017;  from  contractor  C  in  April  2014  (SOR  ¶
4.c); or from his federal job in January 2013 (SOR ¶ 4.g).
When asked why he did not disclose these other terminations on GE 5, Applicant
testified that he had filled out a lot of SCAs and  SF-85Ps in the past, and believed he
had  disclosed  them  previously.  He  asserted  that  the  errors  he  made  on  his  various
applications  were honest mistakes, and  were  not an  attempt  to  “obfuscate  any sins or
past indiscretions whatsoever.” (Tr. 91)
On his 2015 SCA, Applicant disclosed his termination from another government
department and provided extensive details. (GE 2 at 13-15) He also disclosed his April
2014  termination  from  contractor  C  and  noted  that  he  had  been  fired  because  the
customer was not satisfied with his work, (GE 2 at 12-13)
On  his  January  2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  his  July  2017  termination  from
contractor T, and  noted  that the  customer, a  large  defense  contractor, “didn’t need  my
input  anymore.”  (GE  3  at  14-15;  Tr.  125).  He  disclosed  his  2017  termination  from
contractor M, said that he “left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of
misconduct,”  noted  the  spillage  incident,  and  said  he  had  been  removed  from  the
contract, but was subject to rehire. (GE 3 at 16; Tr. 125)
On   his  January   2018   SCA,   Applicant  also   noted   other  terminations,  from
contractor  C,   in  April  2014   and   from   the   federal  department   job,  in  July   2013,   but   he
gave  no  details. (GE 3  at 17-18) He also answered  “No” in answering  questions calling
for  disclosure  of   adverse  circumstances   (if   he   was  fired,  quit,   or  left  by   mutual
agreement following  allegations of  misconduct or  unsatisfactory  performance). (GE 3  at
27)  Applicant  explained   that,   he   was  confused   by   the   page   break   in  the   middle  of  the
page   that  he   filled   out,   and   did  not  realize   he   should  have   answered   “yes”  to   the
question,  since   he   knew   he   had   been   fired   by   contractor  C.  (Tr.  126-129)   No
employment-termination-related  falsifications of GE 3  are alleged  in the SOR.
Applicant  discussed  his  various  terminations  during  his  September  13,  2018
background  interview.  (GE  6  ay  6-7).  However,  on  his  September  27,  2018  SF-85P,
submitted  only  two  weeks  later,  Applicant  did  not  disclose  his  terminations  from
contractor  C  and  contractor  T,  both  of  which  had  occurred  during  the  previous  seven
years,  in  answer  to  a  question  calling  for  disclosure  of  those  events.  (GE  5  at  22).
Curiously,  Applicant  disclosed  his  July  2017  termination  from  contractor  M,  which
occurred  within  the  seven-year  timeframe  of  the  question,  but  also  two  other
terminations from many years before, in 2002 and 2005. (GE 5 at 22; Tr. 137) Applicant
again acknowledged that he should have disclosed the terminations from contractors C
and  T,  but  asserted  that  his  omissions  were  unintentional.  (Tr.  137-138)  Applicant
expressed remorse for his errors and apologized for them. (Tr. 147-148, 161-162)
Applicant  also  did  not  list  his  terminations  from  contractors  C,  M,  and  T  on  his
Declaration  for  Federal  Employment,  in  September  2018,  despite  the  presence  of  a
question calling for disclosure of all employment terminations in the last five years. (GE
4 at Question 12). As to this form, Applicant explained that he thought the question he
was only being  asked  to  disclose  terminations from  “a federal job  or a  government job
within the  last  five  years. That’s how  I looked  at the  question.” (Tr.  134-135) Applicant
maintained  his  interpretation  of  the  question  under  additional  questioning  at  hearing.
(Tr. 135-136)
Among the documents Applicant submitted after the hearing was a  DFE that he
submitted in April 2020. (AE G) On that form, he checked “Yes” to a question asking if,
during the  last  seven  years, he  had  been  convicted,  imprisoned,  been  in  prison,  been
on probation or been on parole. The question “includes felonies, firearms or explosives
violations,  misdemeanors,  and  all  other  offenses.”  (AE  G  at  Q.  9)  He  reported  an
offense as follows:
2019   [City   B,  State   X].   2.   Year
Question   9:   Misdemeanor  DUI  5/17/----
probation  completed  August 2019. No further  issues” followed  by  a  phone
number (AE G at 2) (Emphasis added).
The   year of  the   offense   given,  2019,  is   likely  an   error,   as   probation   ended   only
months   later,   in  August  2019,   and   there  was  no   discussion   at  hearing   of   a   May   2019
DUI.   I  conclude   that  he   likely   meant   to   disclose   his  2017   DUI  on   AE   G.  Yet   Applicant
also did not list his November 2017  arrest for  the  probation  violation  on  AE  G, in answer
to   this  question   with   a   seven-year  timeframe,  and   also   said  that   probation   was
completed with “no other issues.”
AE G also contained a question asking, in part,
During the last five years, have you been fired for a job for any reason, did
you  quit  after  being  told  that  you  would  be  fired,  did  you  leave  any  job
because  of  specific  problems,  or  were  you  debarred  from  Federal
employment by the Office of Personnel Management or any other Federal
agency? (AE G at Q. 12)
Applicant  answered   “Yes”  and   disclosed   his  May   2017   termination   from
contractor  M   “per  request  of   the   Government  COR  for  allegedly   mishandling   sensitive
information;  eligible   for  rehire.”  (AE   G  at  2)  He  did  not  disclose   his  termination   from
contractor  T,  in  July   2017.   Since   Applicant   submitted   AE   G  post-hearing,  he   was  not
questioned about any of these  answers.
Since  his termination  following  the  spillage  incident  in  May  2017,  Applicant  has
subsequently participated in extensive annual training required for his position. After the
hearing,  he  provided  extensive  documentation  of  his  remedial  and  other  security
training on numerous subjects related to his professional position. (Tr. 140; AE F, AE H)
Applicant’s  2020   performance   review   reflects  that  he   exceeds   expectations
across  the  board.  He performed   “extraordinary   work”   under difficult  circumstances.   He
is  a   highly   trained   and   capable   security   professional  and   greatly  contributed   to   the
mission’s success. (AE A)

"Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since February 2020. He is a high school graduate. He is married
with five children and a stepchild. (Items 3, 6)
Applicant has a long criminal record going back to 1995. Applicant was arrested
and charged 17 times between 1995 and 2016.  He also was a regular marijuana user
until  he  quit  in  2017.  The  majority  of  Applicant’s  arrests  (15)  were  between  1995  and
1998.  Those  charges  include  multiple  drug-related  charges,  but  also  include  felony
charges of assault, burglary, armed criminal action, probation violation, unlawful use of
a weapon, assault on law enforcement, and first-degree murder. (Items 1-6)
Applicant  was  convicted  of  possession  of  up  to  35  grams  of  marijuana  in  1998
(SOR ¶ 1.i). He was sentenced to confinement for 180 days (suspended) and probation
for one year. He was convicted of  possession of up to 35 grams of  marijuana in 2000
(SOR ¶ 1.k). He was sentenced to confinement for 60 days. (Items 1-6)
Applicant was acquitted of first degree murder, assault on law enforcement, and
armed criminal action in 2000 (SOR ¶ 1.o). (Items 4-6)
Applicant  was  convicted  of  two  counts  of  felony  possession  of  a  controlled
substance (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e) and one count of distribution, delivery, or manufacture of a
controlled substance (SOR ¶ 1.f) in 2001. He was acquitted of first degree assault (SOR
¶ 1.g). He was sentenced to confinement for seven years (suspended) and probation for
five  years  on  each  of  the  possession  counts,  and  confinement  for  thirteen  years
(suspended) and probation for five years on the distribution, delivery, or manufacture of
a controlled substance count. (Items 1-6)
All of  Applicant’s convictions through 2001 were for offenses that were committed
between   1995   and   1998.  The   prosecutors   chose   not  to   proceed   with   charges  for  the
arrests identified  in the  SOR that did not result in an  acquittal or a  conviction.  (Items 1-
6)
Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession of  a  controlled  substance,
unlawful use of a weapon, and possession of  drug paraphernalia in 2013  (SOR ¶ 1.f).
The disposition of the charges is unclear from the record, but there is no evidence that
Applicant was convicted, and he indicated that the charges were dropped. (Items 1-6)
Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while  intoxicated/alcohol  in
August 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.f). He was found guilty in April 2018 and sentenced to probation
for two years. He completed the terms of his probation in April 2020. (Items 1-6)
Applicant does not deny committing most of the offenses. He stated that he was
young  and  dumb  and  hung  out  with  the  wrong  crowd.  He  denied  committing  the
offenses  that  resulted  in  acquittals,  including murder  and  assault  on  law  enforcement.
He also denied committing the 2013 charges. He stated that the gun, drugs, and drug
paraphernalia seized during the 2013 arrest belonged to someone else. (Items 1-6)
Applicant was in jail for about two and a half years pending trial for murder and
other charges. He stated that  the time spent in jail was the impetus for changes in his
life. He continued to use marijuana, but to a much lesser extent. In 2017, he quit using
marijuana  completely.  He  had  a  good  job  and  a  family.  He  wanted  a  better  life  for
himself and his family. There is no evidence of  any criminal conduct since he stopped
smoking marijuana. (Items 1-6)
Applicant  provided an extremely honest  and candid response to the  FORM.  He
acknowledged his past, and that he may not deserve a security clearance or even a job
with his defense-contractor employer. He wrote:
I’m  not proud  of the  life  I use[d]  to  live  but  I’m  grateful to  God  that  I’m  alive
and  free  to  talk  about  it.  I  wish there was a  way  to  bury  my  past for good
but I can’t and  I try  to  face  it  honestly  and  head  on  when  asked  about it.  In
closing  I understand  why  a  denial is being  recommended. I  honestly  never
expected  an  approval. I sincerely  apologize  for wasting  anyone’s time  with
this request and I humbly thank you  for even  reviewing my request.  (AE A)

He has never served in the military. (Tr. 81) He has held a security clearance since 2010.
(Tr. 24, 82) There is no evidence of any security violations.
Sexual Behavior and Personal Conduct
The  history  of  Applicant’s  sexual  development  is  detailed  in  his  polygraph
interview. (AE L) Prior to September 2016, there is no evidence of illegal sexual conduct
with minors. (Id.) His polygraph result was no deception indicated for questions pertaining
to  sexual  abuse  of  minors  and  viewing  child  pornography,  aside  from  the  offense  in
September 2016. (Id.)
In 2016, a large defense contractor employed Applicant. In June 2016, Applicant
and  his  spouse  moved  to  the  East  Coast.  (Tr.  28-30)  Shortly  after  he  married,  his
employer moved him to the West Coast for three months, and he was unable to visit his
spouse, who  remained  on  the  East Coast,  except for a  brief  visit in July  2016. (Tr. 29-31,
83) Applicant was unable to  make  friends near his work location on the  West Coast, and
he  became  lonely  and  depressed. (Tr. 32-33,  75, 84) He tried  to  meet others; however,
his overtures were  repeatedly rejected. (Tr. 35)
In  September 2016,  Applicant had  been  married  for three  months. (Tr. 78) He said
he  wanted  to  meet someone  he  could  socialize  with, but  not to  date. (Tr. 87) He  went to
several websites on  the  Internet. (Tr. 87-88) He  clicked  a  category  on  the  Internet called
“Wet and  Lonely” or words to  that  effect.  (Tr.  86, 88) An  advertisement suggested  that a
female wanted  to  meet someone  to  watch  Netflix  with  her; however, the  advertisement
included  the  “context of  wanting  to  be  taken  care of  sexually.” (Tr. 89) He responded  to
the  advertisement  indicating  “I’ll  be  glad  to  take  care of  you  or something  like  that.” (Tr.
89)  He communicated  with  V  on  the  Internet,  who  seemed  lonely  and  abandoned. (Tr.
36,  45)  He   said   his  intent  was  for  a   platonic   relationship,   and   he   pursued   the   contact
because  he  was lonely  and  bored. (Tr. 89)  He repeatedly  denied  that  he  intended  to  have
sex  with  V. (Tr. 1  23-125) He acknowledged  that a fair  interpretation  of  his response  to  V
was that he offered to  satisfy  her sexually. (Tr. 90)
V  said her mother was going  to  be  out of town, and  she  wanted  him  to  stay  over
at  her  residence.  (Tr.  39,  115)  V   said   she   was  almost  16   years  old.   (Tr.  38,  90)  He
convinced  himself  that  V  was joking  about her  age  being  only  15.  (Tr. 90) She  asked  for
marijuana;  however, Applicant  “shrugged  it off.”  (Tr.  115) Applicant said he  was not aware
at the  time  he  communicated  with  V  that his  conduct was criminal or “legally  bad.” (Tr.
91) He “shrugged  off” the  possibility  that  V  was a  minor, and  did  not think  about how  he
might be  hurting  a  minor. (Tr. 92) He denied  that he  intended  to  have  sex with  V. (Tr. 92)
He said that he  might not even  meet with  her. (Tr. 115) He said he  just wanted  to  go  for
a  drive. (Tr. 116)  He told the  detectives who  interviewed  him  after his arrest that  a  fair
interpretation  of  V  would  be  that he  wanted  to  have  sex  with  her; however, he  claimed  he
planned  to  sit in his car and  think about it, and  then  “he  would have  changed  his mind
and left but ‘didn’t get the chance’” to leave without having sex  with V. (AE O at 24)
I requested that Applicant provide the police report or court records pertaining to
the allegation in light of his statements about his lack of intent to engage in sexual activity
with  V.  After  the  hearing,  he  provided  the  police  report.  The  police  report  said  that
Applicant wrote in emails or texts several comments to V of a sexual nature, for example,
he said that he “wanted V’s wet p____y tightly around [his] throbbing c__;” and he “wanted
to eat her p____y to make her wet for him;” and in response to her comment about being
15, he said that he liked “younger girls.” (AE O at 9, 12, 21, 30, 52, 54-55) He responded
to V stating she was 15, that her age was not a problem for him. (AE O at 9, 12, 21, 30,
52)
V was actually a law enforcement officer who was acting as a 15-year-old girl. She
suggested that Applicant engage in oral sex with her. (Tr. 114) Applicant agreed to meet
V for sex prior to driving to her apartment. He had been drinking four to six beers over
about five hours, and he considered himself to be “definitely buzzed,” and he had been
taking  his  medication  for  ADHD.  (Tr.  94-97)  However,  he  said  he  did  not  drive  while
intoxicated or impaired when he went to see V. (Tr. 97-98)
Applicant drove  about 30  minutes to  the location where he was supposed to meet
V.  (Tr.  98)  He   had   a   condom   in  his  wallet  before   he   got   into   the   car, and   he   took   the
condom  out of  his wallet.  (Tr. 117) He did not  bring  any  condoms, alcohol, or marijuana
for his meeting  with  V. (Tr. 116-117)  He parked  in a  parking  lot  near V’s building,  and  the
police  arrested  him  for Communication  with  a Minor for Immoral Purposes via Electronic
Communications,  a   felony.  (Tr.  40,  98)  His  father-in-law   provided   his  bail.  (Tr.  47)  He
informed  his boss of  his arrest the  morning  after he  was released  from  jail. (Tr. 47) As a
condition  of  release  pending  disposition  of  the  charge, Applicant agreed  not to  use  the
Internet,  and his employer placed him on a leave of absence. (Tr. 27)
In   October  2018,   Applicant  pleaded   guilty   to   Communication   with   a   Minor   for
Immoral  Purposes  via Electronic  Communications,  and  he  was sentenced  to  30  days in
jail, a  year of probation,  an  $800  fine  and  court  costs,  and  to  register as a  sexual offender.
(Tr. 53-55) Applicant denied  that his purpose  was to  engage  in sexual activity  with  V. (Tr.
41)  He was unclear about the “immoral purpose” involved in his offense.
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleged  that  Applicant  violated  the  rules  for  sex-offender  registration
when he resided within 1,000 feet of a school. Violation of this rule is a Class D felony.
See state M Rev. Stat. § 566.1407.
In  2017, Applicant and  his spouse  purchased  a  house  (H). (Tr. 56,  101-102) When
he  attempted  to  register as a  sex  offender  in 2018, his registration  was rejected  because
the  address he  provided  for H was within 1,000  feet of  a  school. (Tr. 57) He  attempted  to
lease   several  apartments;  however,  the   state’s  computer  rejected   his  applications   to
register as a  sex  offender because  of  their  proximity  to  schools. (Tr. 57) Eventually, he
found  an  apartment he  could  lease  that  met the  school-distance  criteria, and  he  was able
to  complete  his registration  as a  sex  offender. (Tr. 58-59, 100)  His spouse  lives at H, and
Applicant spends about half  of his time  at H. (Tr. 69, 103) He keeps his valuable items at
H. (Tr. 103) He uses the  mailing  address of H. (Tr.  69-70) He keeps his clothing  at his
apartment  and   at  H.  (Tr.  103)  He  considered   the   apartments  he   leased   to   be   his
residences. (Tr. 70-72) He is  aware that  the  legal standard  for  residence  for sex-offender
registration  in his state  is the  location  where he  sleeps. (Tr. 104)  He slept in H on  the
following  occasions: when  his spouse had  a medical emergency; when  the heat was not
working  in his apartment;  and  on  a  couple  of other occasions with  the  permission  of his
probation   officer.  (Tr.   104-107)  He  contacts  his  former  probation   officer  if   he   has
questions  about  what  he   is  permitted   to   do   under  the   state’s  sex-offender  registration
restrictions. (Tr. 105-106)
In   2017,  Applicant  attended   church-sponsored   therapy   and   counseling.  (Tr.  62,
110)  During   his  post-trial  probation,   Applicant  attended   weekly   sex-offender  treatment
sessions   (Tr.   60-62;   AE   E   and   AE   F)   In   April  2019,   he   successfully   completed   his
probation  and  paid  all  fines and  court costs.  (Tr. 66-67; AE  G;  AE  H) After  completion  of
one   year  of  probation,   he   continued   to   attend   therapy   and   counseling   sessions   even
though  he  was  not legally  required  to  continue  with  therapy  and  counseling. (Tr. 65-66;
AE   E)  His  counselor  said,   he   “is  currently   at  no/low   risk  to   reoffend.  It   is  this  writer’s
opinion  that  [Applicant]  is making  the  necessary  changes to  live  a  good  and  productive
life.”  (AE  E) On  January  18, 2021,  his  counselor wrote  that he   “successfully  completed
the treatment requirement of his psychotherapy.” (AE F) Applicant’s family, including his
spouse and in-laws, have  been  very supportive  of Applicant’s rehabilitation. (Tr. 59-60,
67-68, 77) His spouse was approved to be his supervisor when he is around minors, for
example, when he attended a major league baseball game. (Tr. 68-69)
Applicant disclosed his conviction and why he left his previous employment to his
current  employer  and  his  facility  security  officer.  (Tr.  73-74)  Aside  from  the  offense  in
September 2016, Applicant has not communicated with any minors about sex. (Tr. 50)
He did not engage in sexual behavior with minors after September 2016 because it would
upset his wife; he lacks sexual interest in minors; and it is unlawful. (Tr. 50-51) He has
never viewed any child pornography. (Tr. 52) In January 2021, he was diagnosed with,
and he has been receiving treatment for, depression and anxiety. (Tr. 84-85) He regrets
his bad decision that resulted in his conviction. (Tr. 44) His marriage is important to him.
(Tr.  44)  He  has  learned  to  communicate  better  with  his  spouse.  (Tr.  50,  76)  He  has
learned coping mechanisms to address his feelings when he is lonely. (Tr. 75) He is more
religious now. (Tr. 44)
Character Evidence
Applicant  is  dedicated  to  self-improvement,  and  he  loves  his  employment  and
wants to contribute to his country through his employment. (Tr. 126-127) He participated
in several volunteer activities in his community. (AE D) He held multiple leadership roles
related to his employment and national defense. (Id.) He received excellent performance
evaluations,  and  he  made  important  contributions  to  his  employer.  (AE  I;  AE  J)  He
received  an  award  from  his  university  for  his  success  during  the  10  years  after  he
graduated from the university. (AE K)
",False
"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.i, and 2.a. He denied the SOR
allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 1.h. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old. He earned some college credits, but not a degree. He
was married from 1987 to 2004 and from 2007 to 2009. Both marriages ended in divorce.
He  has  two  grown  children.  He  has  been  working  for  his  present  employer  since
December 2018 and has been steadily employed since February 2017. He stated that he
would like to serve his government. (Transcript (Tr.) 19-22, 52; GE 1)
Applicant  and  his  father  were  in  business  together.  Originally  Applicant  owned
three  shops  and  his father owned  ten  shops.  They  merged  their  businesses.  At  some
point, Applicant was the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. It is unknown
if  or  when  his  father  no  longer  participated  in  the  business.  Applicant  had  about  300
employees. He was aware he was required to withhold federal payroll taxes  and FICA
payments associated with the business and turn it over to the IRS. He had complied with
this requirement in the past. At some point, he experienced financial difficulties, and did
not turn over the payments he withheld from his employees to the IRS as required. He
testified that he was trying to keep his employees paid. (Tr. 24-37; GE 6)
Applicant was charged criminally and in about January 2010, he pled guilty and
was found guilty for failure to pay over withholding and FICA taxes for tax year 2004. Five
other  charges  were  dismissed  as  part  of  his  plea  agreement.  He  was  sentenced  to
imprisonment  for  12  months  and  one  day  and  required  to  make  restitution  in  the
approximate amount of $148,702. Applicant testified that he served six months in federal
prison and the remaining six months and a day in a halfway house. The plea agreement
required that he pay $100 a month, based on his income. (Tr. 24-37; GE 6)
In Applicant’s January 2019 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed his
periods of unemployment from September 2015 to February 2017. Applicant testified that
he made the monthly restitution payments until he got sick, and he was unemployed and
on disability. He said 15% of his disability payment was garnished to pay the restitution
during this time. Applicant resumed working in  February 2017. He testified that he has
not resumed paying the required restitution. He said he contacted the Government about
resuming his payments, but was told his wages would be garnished. They were not. Since
at least January 2017, he did not contact the Government about resuming payments and
has  not  made  any  payments  from  the  time  his  pay  was  garnished  until  the  present.
Applicant  testified that a few days  prior to his  hearing,  the Government froze his bank
account and put a levy on his checking account. He testified that he is now in negotiations
for resolving his restitution issues. He said he has been saving his money in anticipation
of  resuming his restitution  payments and  has  put about  $11,000  in  his 401(k) pension
plan.  He  does  not  know  how  to  withdraw  money  from  this  account,  but  he  is  making
inquiries  for  help  in  doing  so.  He  stated  that  he  has  paid  approximately  $15,000  in
restitution. No supporting documents were provided. (Tr. 24-40, 50-51; GE 1, 6)
Applicant testified that he did not initiate contact with the Government because he
was scared. He stated that he has filed his past income tax returns, and he owes federal
income taxes for tax years 2004, 2012, and other tax years that he could not recall. He
estimated he owes approximately $10,000 in delinquent federal income taxes. Applicant
testified that he also  owes approximately $7,000 to $8,000 for state income taxes and
also business taxes for his now defunct business. He does not know the amount and has
no payment plan at this time to resolve these taxes. (Tr. 38-40, 44-45)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR, will not be considered
for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  be  considered  in  the  application  of  mitigating
conditions, when making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
The SOR alleged a charged-off credit card debt (¶ 1.a -$18,349) and medical debts
(¶¶  1.b  through  1.h-totalling  approximately  $2,128).  Applicant  admitted  the  credit  card
debt, which he said became delinquent in December 2015, when he was sick and could
not pay it. He testified he contacted the creditor in either 2016 or 2017 and told them he
could not pay the debt. He believed the debt was written-off as a bad debt by the creditor.
No other information was provided. The debt is not resolved. (Tr. 40-44)
Applicant denied all of the medical debts in the SOR. He stated that he was on
disability when the debts were incurred, and they should have been paid by Medicaid. He
stated he contacted the creditors and disputed them over the telephone and also disputed
them  with  the  credit  bureaus.  He  indicated  he  would  attempt  to  find  the  documents
regarding  his  disputes.  No  information  was  provided  regarding  the  resolution  of  his
disputes or other documents to support he is not responsible for these debts. All of the
alleged  SOR  debts  are  supported  by  credit  reports  from  January  2022,  March  2021,
September 2019, and January 2019. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 40-44; GE 2, 3, 4,
5)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f,
alleging multiple arrests for various offenses between April 2008 and November 2018. He
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a, alleging purchase and use of marijuana with varying
frequency from 2001 to about 2013 or 2014. He admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 3.a
and  3.b,  alleging  that  he  falsified  his  SCAs  in  February  2007  and  February  2017  by
deliberate failure to disclose his drug involvement. His admissions in his answer and at
the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 33-year-old vehicle refueler employed by a defense contractor since
October 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married, but
he has lived with a cohabitant since October 2016. He and his cohabitant have a daughter
who was born on December 17, 2019. (Tr. 19; AX F.)
Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in
2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014.  He testified
that  he  stopped  using  it  because  his  employer  started  random  drug  testing,  and  he
realized that it could jeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.)
In   Applicant’s   first  SCA  in  February   2007,   he   answered   “No”  to   the   question
whether he  had  used  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  within the  past seven  years. (GX  1
at 23.)  During   a  personal subject   interview   in  September 2018,   he   told   an   investigator
that  he  last  used  marijuana  at age  24.  (GX  3  at  4.) At the  hearing, he  testified  that he
could  not remember why  he did  not disclose his marijuana use  in his 2007  SCA.  (Tr. 27-
28.) He also testified  that there was no  reason  why  he  continued  to  use  marijuana  until
2014, except stupidity. (Tr. 30.)
Applicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with brandishing a firearm. His
arrest occurred after he was involved in a bar fight, and one of the participants told police
that  he  had  brandished  a firearm. The  police  stopped  him  as  he drove  away  from  the
scene of the fight. He testified that he has never owned a firearm. The police  searched
the  vehicle  and  did  not  find  a  firearm.  He  appeared  in  court  and  was  found  not  guilty
because the police were unable to find a firearm. (GX 4 at 3; Tr. 34-35.)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  February  2009  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana. After the police stopped him for speeding, they found marijuana in the center
console of his car. He appeared in court and adjudication was deferred. He was placed
on probation for one year, required to attend drug-education classes, and was subjected
to  random  urinalysis.  He  successfully  completed  his  probation  and  the  charges  were
dismissed. (GX 4 at 3; GX 5.)
In  November  2010,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  possession  of
marijuana and having defective equipment on his car. After Applicant completed a period
of probation and drug classes, the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 12.) Applicant
did not disclose his drug-related arrests to his employer. He testified that he was unaware
of any requirement to disclose arrests to his employer. (Tr. 39.)
In  January  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  with  reckless  driving,  having  an  open
container  of  alcohol  in  his  car,  and  possession  of  marijuana.  Applicant  was  with  his
cousin, and he told the police that the marijuana was his, because he did not want his
cousin to get in trouble. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant was convicted of the open-container offense
and reckless driving, but the marijuana charge was dismissed. (GX 13.)
In  November 2013,  Applicant was arrested for  maliciously  causing  bodily  injury  to
his  cohabitant.   He  testified   that   his  cohabitant  was  driving   home   after  they   had   been
drinking  at a  bar, they  began  arguing, his cohabitant began  swerving, and  he  grabbed  the
steering  wheel to  keep  the  car from  striking  a  guardrail. The  police  officer  who  noticed  the
swerving  stopped  them,  noticed  a  cut  on  the  cohabitant’s forehead,  and  concluded  that
Applicant had  hit her in  the  face. Applicant spent a  week in jail after his arrest.  (Tr. 53-
55.) The  charge  was later reduced  to  assault and  battery. In  February  2014, the  court
found   “facts  sufficient to  find   guilt,” but deferred   adjudication  for one   year. The   charge
was dismissed in February 2015. (GX 7.)
Applicant  submitted  his  second  SCA  in  February  2017.  He  answered  “No”  to  a
question  whether,  during  the  last  seven  years,  he  had  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled substances. He also answered “No” to a question whether he had ever used
or  otherwise  been  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a
security clearance. (GX 2 at 26.)
Applicant did not disclose the February 2009 arrest, the November 2010 arrest, or
the January 2011 arrest in his February 2017 SCA. He testified that he did not disclose
his January 2011 arrest because he was told that his arrest record would be expunged.
(Tr. 31.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2018, he
told the investigator that he had never been charged with an offense related to alcohol or
drugs. He did not disclose his drug involvement until the investigator confronted him with
evidence  of  his  arrest  record,  which  included  drug  offenses.  He  then  disclosed  his
marijuana use, beginning in his teenage years and ending in 2014. He told the investigator
that he did not disclose his marijuana use while holding a security clearance because it
did not matter, since he had stopped using marijuana. He also told the investigator that
he did not disclose his marijuana use because he misread the question and thought he
was required to disclose only what had occurred in the last seven or ten years. (GX 3 at
12-13.) At the hearing,  he admitted that he did not disclose his marijuana involvement
because  he  was  nervous,  scared,  and  afraid  that  it  would  jeopardize  his  security
clearance or his job. (Tr. 31-33.)
In July 2018, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on his cohabitant.
Applicant testified that he was driving home after work after a long work day and spending
some time after work at a friend’s house. He fell asleep and hit the rear of an 18-wheel
truck.  His  cohabitant  came  to  the  scene  and  was  taking  him  home  when  they  began
arguing, because his cohabitant refused to take him to a hospital. Applicant became angry
and cracked the windshield of their car by punching it with his fist. His cohabitant called
the police, who concluded that they had been fighting. (Tr. 57-63.) A protective order was
issued, prohibiting Applicant from having any contact with his cohabitant for three days.
(GX 9.)
Applicant  testified   that  he   was  charged   and   the   protective   order  was  issued
because  his cohabitant “got all  hysterical”  and  told  the  police  that he  had  smacked  her.
He  admitted   that,   on   several  occasions,   he   grabbed   her  and   shook  her  after  she   said
things intended  to  provoke  him. (Tr. 50-51.) In  September 2018, he appeared  in court and
pleaded  no  contest.  The  judge  found  “facts sufficient to  find  guilt,” placed  Applicant on
probation, and  deferred  adjudication until September 2020. (GX  8.)  Applicant completed
his probation and the charge was dismissed. (Tr. 63.)
Applicant and his cohabitant stayed apart for about seven or eight months after his
arrest. (Tr. 64.) He testified that most of their arguments arose from his cohabitant’s desire
that he stay at home instead of socializing with friends away from home and her practice
of saying things that she knew would provoke him. He testified that the arguments and
physical violence stopped after their daughter was born. (Tr. 51-52.)
In  November  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI). His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was 0.17. In the jurisdiction where he
was arrested, jail time is mandatory for a BAC at or above 0.15. In March 2019, Applicant
was convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 175 days suspended, and a $250
fine.  He  was  placed  on  unsupervised  probation  for  one  year.  His  driver’s  license  was
restricted for one year, and he was required to install an ignition interlock on his vehicle.
(GX 10.) He served his jail sentence on weekends. (Tr. 66.) He completed eight weeks
of alcohol education in August 2019, and 16 weeks of group outpatient substance abuse
treatment in October 2019. He was allowed to remove the ignition  interlock in January
2020. The record of his treatment does not include a diagnosis or prognosis. (AX K.)
Applicant admitted that many of his arrests were related to alcohol, but he does
not believe he has an alcohol problem. He has reduced his drinking since the birth of his
daughter. He testified that he drinks mainly on weekends and limits himself to about two
drinks or two beers. (Tr. 67.)
A  friend  of  Applicant  who  has  known  him  for  12  years  submitted  a  statement
describing Applicant as “a very respectful and honest gentleman” and “the type of person
that will give you the shirt off his back.” The friend did not indicate whether he was familiar
with Applicant’s criminal record. (AX A.)
Applicant’s mother submitted a statement acknowledging that Applicant has done
things “that have not been pleasing to the way of his teaching,” but stating that he is now
a  family-oriented  person  who  is  striving  to  be  a  better  person.  His  mother  states  that
Applicant speaks often of his job and his love for it, and that he is proud of his 15 years
of service with his employer. (AX B.)
Applicant  submitted  photographs  of  a  clock  and  various  memorabilia  containing
the numeral 15, which he received in recognition of 15 years of service. (AX C, D, and E.)
Applicant’s cohabitant submitted a letter (AX H) including the following comments:
[Applicant]  has  gone  through  a  lot  of  changes  and  learning  experiences
whether good or bad. He strives to be a better person and a better man.
One  thing  I  can  say  is  that  [Applicant]  is  a  hard  worker,  dedicated  and
always willing to learn new things.
After separating  we  decided  to  work on  getting  back together and  decided
to  attend  church.  We’ve  made  a  commitment  to  attend  church and  hoped
that  our  relationship  would get  better. After all  these  years God  blessed  us
with   our  first  child.  [Applicant]   was  there  fully   committed   while   I  was
pregnant and  was there for most of my  doctor appointments as long  as his
job  permitted  it.  And  when  our  daughter was born I saw  the  look  on  his face
as a  proud  first-time  father.
He is an awesome father who is there for our daughter hand in hand. With
our work and busy schedules he makes sure that he is there to pick her up
from daycare and make sure that she is well taken care of at all times. He
loves our daughter with all his heart and he works very hard to make sure
she has everything that she needs.

(Items 1, 4, 5, and 6)
Alcohol Consumption
Applicant  has been  a  social drinker since  the  age  of  sixteen  while  in high  school.
He would typically  drink on  the  weekends (a six  pack of  beer). He stated  that he  would
have  two  drinks in a  sitting  once  per week to  three  times per month.  In  a  2020  personal
subject   interview,  Applicant   stated   that   he  has  never  had   any   problem   reducing   his
alcohol consumption. (Item 3) Within the past ten years he has been arrested in  alcohol-
related-vehicular  incidents  three  times. Applicant  admitted  the  allegations and   provided
explanations.  (Answer to SOR)
In   his  2020,  subject   interview   Applicant  stated   that  all   of   his  drinking   occurred
during   social  situations,   and   he   never  felt  impaired.  After his first  and   second   DUI,   he
slowed  down  his drinking  to  one time  every  other week, and he  would  have  three  to four
beers each  time. He told the  investigator he  would not drink to  intoxication.  (Item  3)  His
drinking   increased   in   later years due   to   a   loss  of family   members  (two   grandmothers).
(Answer  to  SOR)  He  also  stated  that  he  had  no  intent  to  stop  drinking.  (Item  3)  He

He  had  attended  outpatient  group  counseling.  Applicant  reported  in  his  DOHA
interrogatories  that  he was  diagnosed  with Alcohol Use Disorder  –Moderate  SOR  1.d)
and  that  it  was  recommended  that  he  abstain  from  alcohol.  In  his  answer,  Applicant
stated that he did not know that he was to abstain from use of alcohol.  He also completed
the interrogatory by stating that he currently consumes alcohol. (Item 3) SOR 1.e
Criminal Conduct
The SOR (2.c) cross-alleges the information alleged in 1.a through 1.c. Applicant

Applicant also admitted to SOR 2.a, that in 2004, he was arrested for possession
of marijuana.  (Items 4-6) He received deferred prosecution after supervised probation
for 12 months. He admitted that he has been a regular marijuana user since high school.
He did not seek treatment. He claimed that he stopped when he wanted to get a security
clearance. (Item 3) As to SOR 2.b, in 2018, Applicant was found guilty of not complying
with  the  terms  of  the  VASAP  program.  He  is  not  currently  in  any  alcohol  treatment
counseling or meetings. (Item 3)
",False
"Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 50 years old. He earned an associate’s degree in 1994, a bachelor’s
degree  in  2000,  and  a  master’s  in  business  in  2018.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the
military  from  1994  to  2004  and  then  was  in  the  inactive  Reserve  until  2006.  He  was
honorably discharged as an E-6. He served in combat and earned a bronze star for valor.
After his discharge, he worked for federal contractors. He held a security clearance until
2014. He has never married. He has a 24-year-old son. (Tr. 25-27, 58; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  conduct.  In  May  1990,  he  was  arrested  and
charged with disorderly conduct, carrying a concealed weapon  (mace), and damage to
property-criminal  mischief.  He  was  found  guilty  of  the  misdemeanor  offenses.  No
information was provided regarding his sentence. (GE 3, 4)
Applicant was arrested in March 1991 and charged with disorderly conduct and
resisting an officer. He was acquitted of the charges. (GE 3)
Applicant was arrested in September 1993 and charged with carrying a concealed
weapon, resisting an officer, and obstruction. The charges were dismissed. (GE 3, 4)
Applicant was arrested in November 2002 and charged with disorderly intoxication,
public place cause disturbance, misdemeanor second degree. The charges were nolle
prossed.
In February 2006, Applicant was detained by law enforcement for several hours in
London, England, for being involved in a minor altercation. He was not arrested. (GE 2)
In June 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony aggravated battery
with a deadly weapon and armed burglary of a dwelling firearm possession. He had an
altercation with the ex-husband of his girlfriend, when they were picking up her two small
children.  Applicant  testified  at  his  hearing  that  his  girlfriend’s  children  were  with  their
father. Applicant and their mother, his girlfriend, went to pick them up. The children came
out of the house, and Applicant buckled the kids into their car seats, and then heard his
girlfriend scream from inside the house. He went inside and saw her ex-husband with a
sawed off shotgun. He wrestled it away from him. Applicant was terrified. He grabbed a
ceremonial sword from the wall and used it to hit the man’s arm. Applicant testified that
he reported the incident to the police and Applicant was arrested. The charges against
him were later dismissed. (Tr. 134-146, 154; GE 2, 5)
In 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault. He testified
that he was at a bar, having a private discussion with his friend, when a man intervened
and  they  got  into  an  argument.  Then  the  man  threw  a  wet  napkin  at  him.  Applicant
retaliated by throwing a napkin holder at the man and striking him in the face. Applicant
said he regretted his conduct and should not have thrown the object. (Tr. 118-119)
Applicant made a statement to police at the time of his arrest. He told them he and
a friend were walking by a bar and an employee of the bar singled him out and began
yelling at him. He began to yell back. He told the police he never went inside the bar and
remained outside during the verbal altercation.  He said the men from the bar began to
chase him and his friend. Applicant told the police he observed a hand gun. He said one
of them had brass knuckles with a knife attached and was waving it at him saying “come
on” in a threatening manner. He said he was in fear of his life. He testified that he lied to
the police. (Tr. 117-123; GE 2, 6, 7)
Witness  statements  and  a  surveillance  video  differ  from  Applicant’s  version  of
events. Applicant was inside the bar, and he began yelling at one of the employees, who
was later identified as the manager of the bar. Applicant gave him the middle finger and
the manager responded in kind. Applicant picked up a plastic napkin holder and threw it
at  the  manager,  striking  him  on  the  left  side  of  his  head.  The  manager  and  another
employee began chasing Applicant and his friend outside the bar and down the street.
While in pursuit, the manager called the police. Applicant had pepper spray and pointed
it at the manager, who turned away, and Applicant sprayed his back. The police arrived
and confiscated brass knuckles from the employee who ran with the manager. There was
no gun. (GE 2, 6, 7)
The  police  reviewed  the  videotape  and  noted  that  the manager was  behind  the
bar,  and  Applicant  walked  up  to  it  and  began  yelling  at  him.  Applicant  then  gave  the
manager the middle finger. The manager gave it back and then Applicant threw the napkin
holder at the manager, striking him on the side of the head. Applicant would not leave the
bar. The manager then called the police and he and his employee chased Applicant and
his  friend. Applicant  admitted  he  lied  to  the police  because  he  was  afraid  of  getting in
trouble. He said he later told the truth to the judge. He testified that the state decided not
to prosecute the charge in exchange for Applicant completing community service, which
he did. The charges were nolle prossed. He believed he also paid a fine. There were no
probation requirements. (Tr. 123-134, 151-152; GE 2, 6, 7)
In June 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery, aggravated assault
with  a  deadly  weapon,  a  firearm,  child  neglect  and  possession  of  a  firearm  in  the
commission of a felony. These charges were the result of an incident involving road rage.
Applicant’s testimony differs greatly from police reports and witness statements of what
transpired. Applicant claimed he was the victim. His son, 16 years old at the time, was in
the car with him. Applicant testified that the other vehicle tried to run him off the road. He
and the occupants of the other vehicle were cursing at each other back and forth while
driving. They met at a traffic light. He said his vehicle was blocked in by the other cars.
He testified that he got out of the vehicle and saw two men approaching his vehicle. He
asked them to leave and was attacked by two men. He pepper sprayed them. He thought
one had a knife because he was stabbed. Applicant then ran back to his car to retrieve
his  gun,  and  chambered  a  round.  The  man  was  crawling  away  from  Applicant  on  his
hands and feet, retreating. Applicant estimated he was maybe 10-15 feet away, but still
a threat. Applicant then walked over to the man and pointed the gun at him and asked
him where the knife was. The man ignored his command. Applicant then left the area and
was later stopped by the police. (Tr. 29-32, 76 -117, 158-172)
Applicant told the police that when he stopped his car, two men came to his vehicle
and tried to grab his son from the interior of the car and tried to fight him. Applicant was
defending himself. He went crazy when they tried to hit his son. He used pepper spray on
them to get them away. He took out his gun to hold them back. He was in fear for his and
his son’s lives. He told the police that after he stopped the car, a man who was not an
occupant of the other vehicles, who had been sitting on the curb, walked up to Applicant’s
vehicle and attacked him. Applicant pepper sprayed him, and they began to fight. Another
person, also not involved in the road rage, also began attacking him. Applicant told police
because these men were now chasing him he ran and got his gun from his car. He pointed
it at them. He said he feared for his life. When he realized they were no longer chasing
him, he left the scene. (GE 8)
Applicant’s son provided a statement to the police after the incident. He confirmed
there was a mutual road rage incident that occurred. While driving, his father retrieved
pepper spray and a hand gun from the glove box of the vehicle. When they stopped, a
woman  exited  the  other  vehicle  and  said  she  was  calling  the  police.  His  father  made
harassing statements to the woman. Then a man, not involved in the road rage, who his
son and others believed was trying to diffuse the situation, walked up to Applicant’s car
and his father reached into the vehicle and grabbed the pepper spray and spayed the
man. Then his father attacked the man, took him to the ground, and began fighting him.
His son stated this man did not attempt to attack his father. While on the ground, another
man came to the man’s assistance, and kicked Applicant in the face. Applicant and the
man on the ground continued fighting. The son was yelling at his father to stop fighting.
His father then kicked the man in the head. This man was able to get away and crossed
the street in retreat, where he collapsed. (GE 8)
Applicant’s  son  said  his  father  then  went  back  to  his  car,  retrieved  his  gun  and
pointed it at the second man who intervened and then pointed it at the first man. Applicant
admitted that when he went back for the gun there was a magazine in it with rounds and
he  chambered  one  round. He admitted  seeing  the  man  crawling  away  on  his hands and
knees.  He  walked  up  to  him  and  could  not  see  a  knife,  but yelled  at  him  to  drop  it, while
pointing  the  gun  at him. He then  kicked  the  man  in the  head. Applicant was wearing  boots
that had  4  one-inch  plastic spikes  in the  toe. Applicant  testified  he  wears the  boots for
protection. He  claimed  that even  though  the  man  was crawling  away  he  was still  a  threat.
His son’s statement said that Applicant then  ran  back to  the  car, put the  gun  between  the
driver’s seat and  the  console  and  the  pepper  spray  on  the  front  seat and  told  his son  they
needed  to leave the area before the police arrive.  (Tr. 76-117, 156-172; GE 8)
Numerous witness statements, including those with no direct interest in the case,
contradict  Applicant’s  version  of  what  happened  and  essentially  corroborate  his  son’s
statement. Applicant admitted that his initial statement to police was false. He denied that
he  got  pepper  spray  and  the  gun  out  of  the  car  console  while  they  were  still  driving,
contradicting what his son said. He believes the police coached or influenced his son’s
statement. I did not find Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 34, 76-117; GE 8)
Any  derogatory  information  that  was  not  alleged  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualifying  purposes,  however,  it  may  be  considered  in  making  a  credibility
determination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
A search of Applicant and his vehicle revealed one 40 caliber hollow-point bullet,
black gloves, three cans of mace, steel boots with spikes, a semi-automatic Glock gun,
and two Glock magazines, one with 12 rounds and one with 13 rounds. Applicant testified
that he has hollow-point bullets because they will do the most damage. A regular bullet is
not as accurate or efficient. He explained the hollow-point bullet is the standard to protect
your life. (Tr. 174-175; GE 8)
There were a total of nine charges against Applicant. He testified his bail was over
a million dollars. He was in jail for two months and under house arrest for another eight
months.  In  March  2015,  he  accepted  a  best-interest  guilty  plea  to  felony  aggravated
assault with a deadly weapon, and firearm possession. Adjudication was withheld on this
charge. The charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, a firearm, and improper
exhibition  of  a  dangerous  weapon  or  firearm,  were  nolle  prossed.  Applicant  was
sentenced to four years of probation, ordered to meet with his probation officer monthly,
50 hours of community service, and to pay $100 a month of court costs. He completed
his  community  service  and  his  probation  was  terminated  early  in  May  2017.  Although
Applicant’s probation  was terminated, no  court documents were produced  to  show  the
final adjudication of the charge. It likely was dismissed, but I do not have the documents
to corroborate the final disposition. Applicant testified that he pleaded guilty because he
ran out of money. He said he regretted the incident. He stated in his answer to the SOR:
“After  weighing  all  of  the  facts  of  the  case  carefully,  the  judge  elected  to  withhold
adjudication of guilt, although I admitted to pointing the firearm at the aggressor. I was
not found guilty of the alleged charges.” (Tr. 35-40, 74; Answer to the SOR; GE 9)
After Applicant completed  his probation, he  went back to  school, volunteered  at
the   VFW   and   created   a   veterans’  nonprofit   organization.  He   testified   he   sits   on   the
governing board for a charity and participates in other philanthropic projects. Tr. 37, 40-
43)
The  SOR  ¶  1.i  alleges  that  in  2017,  there  was  an  incident  report  made  to  the
university police   department,  where Applicant   was  attending  classes,  alleging he   had
made  a  threat  of  violence against   one  of  his  classmates.  The  incident  report  was  not
provided as evidence. Applicant denied he threatened a classmate. Without the incident
report  or  any  other  information  about  what  allegedly  occurred,  there  is  insufficient
evidence to corroborate a threat was made. I  find in Applicant’s favor on this allegation.
(Tr. 49-56, 60-74, 151)
In January 2017, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. His debts ($107,061) were
discharged in May 2017. He attributed his financial difficulties to his 2014 arrest. He lost
his job while he was in jail and was unable to pay his debts. He testified that he is now a
small business owner and works in real estate. No additional financial issues have been
raised. (Tr. 48-49, 146-149, 155-156; GE 11)
The  government  requested Applicant   undergo  a  psychological evaluation.   One
was conducted in October 2019 by a government-approved licensed clinical psychologist
who  is  a  board  certified  neuropsychologist.  As  part of   Applicant’s medical  history,  he
disclosed that he has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but did not seek treatment
for it until 2018. He underwent exposure therapy through the Veterans Affairs and found
it effective. He did not feel he would engage in any further violent interactions with others.
Applicant disclosed to the psychologist the 2011 incident at the bar where he threw
the napkin holder at the manager. He told the psychologist that the incident was his fault.
The  manager was  an Arab and  the  incident occurred  during the Arab up rising events.
When he saw something on the television, he became enraged and threw the object at
the manager. He said he attended individual and group anger management training and
learned how to calm himself.
Applicant also gave his version of the facts of the 2014 aggravated assault with a
deadly weapon incident. He said after a road rage incident, he was assaulted by two men,
who  he  assumed  were  part  of the   traffic  incident.  He  later  learned they   were  good
Samaritans. He said he pepper sprayed them and told them to stay back, but they did
not. He said they then assaulted him. He said that he eventually got away from the men
and went back to his car and pulled his gun out. The men ran away, and Applicant left
the scene. He denied he pulled the gun out  while he  was driving. After  discussing the
with the psychologist  he stated  “I used less violenc e than I could have in all of
ev
these situations.” (GE 10)
ents
The psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with  antisocial  personality  disorder  with
narcissistic traits.  She  did  not  see  any  signs  of  PTSD  at  present.  Based  on  his
background, she  concluded  that  his  personality  disorder  and  narcissistic  traits  are  a
security concern,  and  she  has  concerns  about  his  judgment,  trustworthiness,  and
reliability. His condition is pervasive and unlikely to improve, and his prognosis is poor.
(GE 10)
Applicant  apologized   for  the   mistakes   he   made.   He   said   he   had   to   make   split-
second  decisions and  he  made  some  wrong  ones. He was emotional at the  time. (Tr. 57-
58)
Applicant’s evidence included his medical record supporting his PTSD diagnosis.
He  also  provided  an  article  from  the  American  Journal  of  Psychiatry  from  2015  on
narcissistic personality disorder, copies of potential job offers, and documents from his
military  service  record.  He  provided  excerpts  from  his  performance  evaluations
throughout his military and civilian career, character statements from friends and family,
and certificates of completion, training, and transcripts. He is described as intelligent, a
team player, devoted, tenacious, respected, a leader, a person with integrity, a patriot,
and loyal. He is a small business owner and a realtor. (Tr. 150; Answer to the SOR; AE

"Applicant admitted, in part, and denied, in part, the allegation in ¶ 1.a. of the SOR
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  64-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since September of 2018. He has held a security
clearance, off and on, since 1985. (TR at page 24 line 12 to page 35 line 1, and GX 1 at
page  25.)  He  is  divorced,  and  has  two  children,  ages  26  and  29  years  old.  (GX  1  at
pages 13~14, and 19.)

1.a.  Applicant  was  a  software  engineer  at  his  own  company  from  2003~2009.
(TR  at  page  27  lines  21~25.)  He  employed  his,  then  minor,  children,  at  his  company,
paying them about $20,000 a year. (TR at page 28 line 6 to page 32 line 6.) When his
company failed in 2009, Applicant filed for unemployment benefits on behalf of his minor
children, for “99 weeks,” ending in “mid-2011.” (TR at page 32 line 7 to page 35 line 2.)
He placed said monies, when received, “into their bank accounts.” (TR at page 15 lines

In  December  of  2015,  Applicant  was  charged  with  two  counts  of  False
Statement,  Representation,  or  Concealment;  two  counts  of  Identity  Theft  –  Obtain
Credit with Other’s Identity; and Grand Theft – all felonies. Applicant denies committing
these felonies, but did pled guilty to Failure to Post Benefit Rights in his work place, a
misdemeanor. (TR at page 15 line 7 to page 22 line 24, at page 23 line 13 to page 24
line  6,  and  page  37  lines  4~16.)  Applicant  was  ordered  to  pay  $45,000  in  restitution;
which he avers has been paid (currently in civil litigation), and was placed on probation
until this month, March of 2022. (TR at page 38 line 4 to page 40 line 6, and GX4.)

"Applicant  is 34 years old  and married. He has  an  associate’s degree. Applicant
has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  2018  and  seeks  to  obtain  national
security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 2 at
Sections 12, 13A, and 17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he consumes intoxicants to excess.
1.a. Applicant admitted that he has consumed alcohol in excess and to the point
of  intoxication  from  about  age  21  to  at  least  April  2019.  In  written  responses  to
interrogatories propounded to him by DOHA, Applicant stated that he last had an alcohol-
related  blackout  in  December  2017.  He  also  admitted  that  he  was  last  intoxicated  in
December 2019. Applicant further stated that he had stopped drinking for health reasons.
(Item 3, Item 4.)
1.b. Applicant admitted  he  had  been  arrested  in  or about March 2009  and  charged
with  Driving  Under the  Influence  (DUI), No Driver’s License  in  Possession, DUI  with  BAC
.08% or More, Speed  in  a  Posted  Zone, and  No Display  of  Registration. Applicant failed
to  appear in  court  and  a  bench  warrant for his arrest was issued  on  April 12, 2010. This
warrant remains active. (Item 5.)
Applicant was first questioned  by  a  Government investigator in August 2010  about
his arrest  and  bench  warrant.  He admitted  the  arrest,  but denied  knowing  about the  bench
warrant. He indicated  at that time  that he would “resolve the  problem.” (Item  4.)
Applicant  was  questioned  by  a  different  Government  investigator  in  April  2019
Applicant admitted the arrest, but stated he was unsure about a bench warrant. Applicant
did admit under further questioning that he was told about the warrant during his  2010
interview. Applicant stated he would talk to his current lawyer, who represented Applicant
in relation to allegation 1.f, about the warrant. There is no information showing Applicant
has done anything further about this case. (Item 3.)
1.c. Applicant was arrested by military police officers in March 2010 while he was
serving  in  the  Marine  Corps.  At  that  time  Applicant  was  intoxicated  and  became
belligerent and physical with the officers. According to Applicant, he did not receive any
judicial or non-judicial punishment due to this incident. (Item 3, Item 7,)
1.d. Applicant was involved in an alcohol-related incident in May 2010, while still
on active duty with the Marine Corps. Applicant was drinking alcohol in the barracks with
another  Marine,  who  was  under  the  drinking  age.  They  both  became  intoxicated  and
damaged  Applicant’s  barracks  room.  Applicant  may  have  received  non-judicial
punishment for this incident, but the record is unclear. (Item 3, Item 4.)
1.e.  Subsequent  to  the  incident  in  May  2010,  Applicant  received  some  form  of
alcohol counseling. The Report of Investigation (ROI) of the 2010 interview stated:
[Applicant]  stated  that  he  was  sent  to  the  Substance  Abuse  Counseling
Center (SACC) on [Base One] for a two-day evaluation which concluded he
had alcohol abuse or dependence issues ([Applicant] was not sure  of the
diagnosis).  [Applicant]  said  that  the  SACC  referred  him  to  their  alcohol
rehabilitation program. [Applicant] reported that he saw a counselor four or
five  times,  but  left  [Base  One]  and  transferred  to  [Base  Two]  prior  to
completing the full rehabilitation program. (Item 4)
At the time of this interview in 2010 Applicant had applied to resume the program
at Base Two, but had not been accepted. No further information was available in the file
or provided by Applicant.
1.f. Applicant was arrested  in January  2019  and  charged  with  DUI.  He stated  in his
Answer “that case  has  been  cleared  and  dismissed  with  prejudice.” This dismissal was
based  on  a  legal technicality. Applicant does not dispute  the  underlying  fact that he  was
driving under the influence  when he was arrested. (Item 6.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about  a  person’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant did not admit or deny this allegation,
which stated that the information set forth under allegations 1.b through 1.d, and 1.f, are
cognizable under this guideline as well.
Paragraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. Applicant
denied both allegations under this paragraph.
3.a. Applicant filled out a Government questionnaire on December 21, 2018. (Item
2.) Section 22 of the questionnaire asked questions about Applicant’s police record. One
subpart of the question asked, “Have you EVER been charged with an offense involving
alcohol or drugs?” (Emphasis in  original.) Applicant  answered  the  question,  “No.” This
was a false answer to a relevant question about Applicant’s criminal history involving the
use of alcohol.
3.b. Section 24 of the same questionnaire concerned  Applicant’s use  of alcohol.
One subpart asked, “Have you EVER been ordered, advised, or asked to seek counseling
or  treatment  as  a  result  of  your  use  of  alcohol?”  (Emphasis  in  original.)  Applicant
answered  the  question,  “No,”  This  was  a  false  answer  to  a  relevant  question  about
Applicant’s alcohol-treatment history.
Applicant stated  in  his  Answer, “I did not understand the questions clearly, thus
resulting in my answering the questions incorrectly.”
",False
"In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  in  part  and  denied  in  part  the  SOR
allegations.  (HE  3)  He  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  (Id.)  His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 38-year-old lead weapons instructor, who has worked for a defense
contractor  since  May  2020.  (Tr.  26-27;  GE  1;  AE  A)  He  is  applying  to  be  a  special
operations technician for which he will need a security clearance. (Tr. 69) If employed in
this  position,  his work  will  be  similar to  his Army  duties  when  he  was  in  Army  Special

(HE 3 at 4; AE A) He has not had any employment problems after leaving confinement in
October 2016. (Tr. 70)
In  2006,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  political  science  and  an
additional bachelor’s degree in law and justice. (Tr. 25; HE 3 at 2) As part of his college
experience, he volunteered in legal aid and was an advocate for people who were the
victims  of  domestic  violence.  (Tr.  25-26;  HE  3)  He  assisted  in  the  preparation  and
publication  of  a  legal  study  while  in  college.  (Tr.  26;  HE  3)  He  is  currently  deployed
overseas working for a Defense contractor at a base. (Tr. 24, 27)
Applicant served on active duty in the Army from April 2007 to October 2016, and
he  received  an  honorable  discharge.  (Tr.  28,  44;  AE  E)  He  volunteered  for,  and  was
selected  to  attend,  SF  training.  (Tr.  29-30;  HE  3  at  2)  He  successfully  completed  SF
training in January 2009 and was awarded the Green Beret. (Tr. 30; HE 3 at 2; AE D) He

injuries to his hand and foot. (HE 3 at 3) He is seeking an increase in his disability rating
to 100 percent. (Tr. 142)
Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct
Alleged Theft, Importation, and Possession of Army and Foreign Munitions
The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are cross-alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. SOR ¶ 1.a
alleges that Applicant was charged with the following criminal offenses: disobedience of
a lawful general order, in violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ);
failure  to  provide  notice  and  turn  over  abandoned  property,  in  violation  of  Article  103,
UCMJ;  possession  of  unregistered  firearms  and  explosives,  in  violation  of  Article  134,
UCMJ; and larceny, in violation of Article 121, UCMJ. In January 2016, he was sentenced
at a BCD-SPCM to be confined for 12 months and to reduction to specialist (E-4).
The conduct that formed the basis for the charges began during Applicant’s most
recent tour in Afghanistan in 2014. For about three months while Applicant was deployed
to  Afghanistan, he  gathered munitions.  (Tr. 139-140) Munitions are  defined  as military
equipment, which includes firearms, ammunitions, and explosives. He did not describe
how he obtained the munitions and whether he falsified any inventory, disposition, or turn-
in  documents.  During  this  deployment,  he  said  he  told  an  SF  colonel  about  having
munitions and  wanting  to  bring  the  ordnance  back to  the  United  States to  use  for training
of   K9   teams.  (Tr.   41,  95-97)   He   said  he   wanted   munitions  that  were  similar  to   enemy
munitions encountered  in Afghanistan  for more  realistic training. (HE  3  at  6, 11) The  SF
colonel told  him  it would involve  too  much  paperwork, hassle,  or effort to  obtain approval.
(Tr. 41-43, 97) The  SF colonel did not specifically  say  no  to  Applicant’s suggestion  about
importation  of  explosives from  Afghanistan  into  the  United  States. (Tr. 98) Applicant  did
not provide  the  name  or contact information  for the  SF colonel. Applicant denied  that he
received  a  direct order not to  bring  the  ordnance  to  the  United  States. (Tr. 43) He decided
to  “improvise” to  accomplish  this self-identified  training  mission. (Tr. 42) He rationalized
that he  could not accept no for an  answer when  he might be  able to  save  lives by  taking
the  actions   that he  took.  (Tr. 42)  No  one   ever gave   him   permission   to   bring   munitions
from  Afghanistan  to  the  United  States.  (Tr. 83)  The  only  enemy  munitions identified  were
two  PG-7VM, which are  fired from a  rocket propelled  grenade  (RPG)-7  launcher, and  an
AK-47.  See   The   Specification   of   Charge   II,  and   the   Specification   of   Charge   IV,   infra.
However, it is likely  that the  enemy  in Afghanistan  uses stolen  U.S. munitions and  PG-
7VMs for IEDs and other nefarious purposes.
Applicant  put  the  munitions  he  gathered  in  Afghanistan  in  an  ISU-60  Army
container  along  with  K9  and  other  tactical  equipment.  (Tr.  88,  140)  The  ISU-60  was
transported from Applicant’s tactical location, to Bagram Air Base, and eventually to  an
Army canine facility in an installation in the United States. (Tr. 140-141) He did not indicate
he warned the shipping entities (aircraft or ship), the Army, or customs that he had stored
explosives or munitions in the container.
Applicant  gathered  more  than  2,000  rounds  of  5.56  millimeter  ammunition  in
Afghanistan  to  bring  to  the  United  States.  (Tr.  89)  He  brought  the  ammunition  to  the
United States in ammunition cans in the ISU-60. (Tr. 89, 140-141) He said that there was
too  much  “red  tape  and  bureaucracy” in getting  ammunition  on  the  military installation,
and  he  believed  he  could  improve  the  survivability  of  his  team  by  avoiding  the
bureaucracy in training involved in getting ammunition authorizations. (Tr. 91-92) He said
that in 2014 he was focused on saving lives through realistic training. (Tr. 91-94) He did
not provide any statements from anyone that 5.56 millimeter ammunition was unavailable
for SF training at the installation where he was assigned.
Ammunition  is  accountable  in  the  United  States  at  U.S.  Army  ranges.  (Tr.  116)
Soldiers are not permitted to retain unused ammunition when leaving the range. (Tr. 116)
Overseas unused ammunition is supposed to be transferred to the replacement unit when
a unit rotates back to the United States. (Tr. 116) There was no information presented
that  the  unit  that  replaced  Applicant’s  unit  suffered  any  mission  decrement  due  to  the
missing munitions that Applicant took and exported to the United States from Afghanistan.
In November 2014, Applicant returned to the United States from Afghanistan, and
he brought some live ordnance or munitions from overseas  into the United States. (Tr.
37-38,  83)  He  wanted  to  train  dogs  with  actual  munitions  because  he  believed  that
devices used for training in the United States had a different odor. (Tr. 38) He suggested
use  of  ordnance  from  Afghanistan  in  K9  training  would  reduce  or  eliminate  in-country
acclimation  of  the  dogs.  (Tr. 38)  He  brought  explosives  and  ammunition  to  the  United
States to  enhance  a  canine  team’s survivability. (Tr. 38) However, some  of  the  items he
brought were souvenirs that he  took to  remind  him  of  an  operation  or mission. (Tr. 38) He
said he  had  U.S. and  enemy  ordnance  at his house  to  use  for training  because  dogs need
to  recognize  the  difference  between  friendly  and  enemy  munitions.  (Tr.  39) He  said  he
planned  to  take  the  ordnance  to  his  base  for training. (Tr. 40) He denied  that the  ordnance
was for his own  personal use  or gain.  (Tr. 41)  Whatever he  did not use  for  training, he
intended  to  “organize  a  big  cache  and  then  blow  it in place” on  the  military  installation.
(Tr. 95)  He never said he  intended  to  return the  U.S. Army  military  property  he imported
from  Afghanistan  into the United States to Army official supply channels.
Applicant  transported  the  munitions  that  he  obtained  in  Afghanistan  from  the
military installation to his off-post residence in his privately-owned vehicle. (Tr. 84-85) He
never  moved  the  munitions  from  his  off-post  residence.  (Tr.  85)  He  never  used  the
munitions for training. (Tr. 85) The munitions were stored in unlocked boxes in his off-
post residence; however, they were in a room with a locked door. (Tr. 86)  There is no
evidence that he attempted to sell the munitions to others.
In  late  November 2014  while  Applicant was on  leave  away  from his home,  there
was  a   break-in  of  his   off-post   residence.   (Tr.  139;  HE  3   at  6)  The   burglar  left  a   door
partially  open, and  a  neighbor called  the  police. (Tr. 139) The  law  enforcement officials
who   entered   his  off-post  residence   informed   the   Army   of  the   ordnance   in   Applicant’s
residence. Some  of Applicant’s personal firearms were stolen  in  the  burglary; however,
he  said none  of  the  munitions  that he  brought from  Afghanistan  were stolen. (Tr. 138-
139)
In July 2015, the following four charges and four specifications were referred to a
BCD-SPCM.  On  October  16,  2015,  Applicant  and  his  counsel  submitted  a  pretrial
agreement in which they offered to plead guilty to the Specifications of Charges I, II, and
IV,  and  Charges  I,  II,  and  IV,  in  return  for  referral  to  a  BCD-SPCM,  to  accept  the
amendments to other charges and specifications, and to dismiss the larceny of military
property charge. (GE 4 at 17-19) The offer to plead guilty included a promise to complete
a stipulation of the facts supporting the guilty plea. The parties did not provide a stipulation
of fact for inclusion in the security clearance record. (Tr. 142) The convening authority
accepted the offer to plead guilty.
In  the  Specification  of  Charge  I,  and  Charge  I,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to
wrongfully possessing and exporting one AN-M14 incendiary hand grenade; two M18A1
Claymore  Antipersonnel  Mines;  four  blocks  of  C4  Demolition  Charges;  17  M81  Igniter
Time Blasting Fuses; five M67 fragmentary hand grenades; eight rounds of 40 millimeter
low  velocity  High  Explosive  Dual  Purpose  (HEDP);  detonation  cord;  three  thermobaric
grenades;  six  blasting  caps;  M15  Modernized  Demolition  Initiators  (MDI);  M11
Modernized  Demolition  Initiators;  one  Dual  In-Line  initiator  blasting  cap;  and  C3
demolition charge datasheet. In addition to these items of U.S. military ordnance, he was
also charged with items of non-U.S. military property, including an AK-47 assault rifle and
one  British  fragmentation  grenade.  (GE  4  at  9-10,  12,  17).  The  maximum  possible
confinement for a violation of Article 92, UCMJ includes years of confinement. See MCM,
2012 ed., ¶ 16e(1)). Applicant agreed that the items in the Specification of Charge I above
were in his off-post  residence  and  most were U.S. Army  property. (Tr. 87-88) He did not
have  authority  from  any  military  authority  to  have  this property  in his residence. (Tr. 88)
While  he   was  deployed   to   Afghanistan,   Applicant  was  entrusted   with   his  SF   team’s
property. (Tr. 135; HE 3 at 3)
Applicant pleaded guilty to the Specification of Charge II, and Charge II, failure to
report and turn over captured or abandoned property, to wit: an AK-47 assault rifle, two
PG-7VM,  one  RPG  launcher,  of  a  value  greater  than  $500,  in  violation  of  Article  103,
UCMJ  (maximum  sentence  includes five  years of  confinement,  see MCM,  2012  ed.,  ¶
27e(1)(b));
The Specification of Charge III and Charge III were referred to trial; however, they
were dismissed pursuant to a pretrial agreement. They allege larceny of military property
of  a  value  of  more  than  $500,  in  violation  of  Article  121,  UCMJ  (maximum  sentence
includes  10  years  of  confinement,  see  MCM,  2012  ed.,  ¶  46e(1)(c)).  Applicant  was
charged with stealing the following items of U.S. Army military property from Bagram Base
in Afghanistan on or about October 2014: 2,088 rounds of 5.56 millimeter ammunition;
491  rounds  of  7.62  millimeter  long  range  ammunition;  263  rounds  of  9  millimeter
ammunition; one AN-M14 incendiary hand grenade; two M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel
Mines; four blocks of C4 Demolition Charges; 23 M81 Igniter Time Blasting Fuses; five
M67  fragmentary  hand  grenades;  eight  rounds  of  40  millimeter  low  velocity  High
Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP); 18 demolition blocks of ¼ lb. Trinitrotoluene charges;
detonation  cord;  three  thermobaric  grenades;  six  blasting  caps;  M15  Modernized
Demolition
Initiators;  one  M142
Multipurpose  Firing  Device;  one  Dual  In-Line  initiator  blasting  cap;  and  C3  demolition
charge datasheet. (GE 4 at 9, 14) He said he was not guilty of the larceny offense. (Tr.
43).
Initiators  (MDI);  M11  Modernized  Demolition
Applicant pleaded guilty to the Specification of Charge IV and Charge IV, wrongful
possession of unlawful firearms,  to wit: an AK-47 assault rifle, two PG-7VMs, and one
rocket  propelled  grenade  launcher,  in  violation  of  Article  134,  UCMJ  and  26  U.S.C.  §
5861(d)  (Section  5861(d)  states,  “it  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  person--(d)  to  receive  or
possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and
Transfer Record”). (GE 4 at 9-10; HE 3 at 7)
Applicant providently pleaded guilty in accordance with his pretrial agreement; the
larceny  charge  was  dismissed;  a  military  judge  sentenced  him  to  12  months  of
confinement; and with good behavior, he served almost 10 months of confinement. (Tr.
45; HE 3 at 7) Applicant’s father died while he was in confinement. (Tr. 44) Applicant said
he  took  responsibility  for  and  pleaded  guilty  to  the  offenses  he  committed.  (Tr.  77)
Applicant believed his offenses were not felonies. (Tr. 144-145)
Applicant disclosed the criminal offenses on his March 15, 2018 SCA. He admitted
that he made the wrong choices in his manner of handling munitions, and he said he had
no excuses or justifications for his actions. (Tr. 92-93) He promised to be detail oriented
and strictly follow protocols and rules in the future. (Tr. 64, 92) He would not place the
mission at such a  high priority  that he  would circumvent rules and  laws in the future.  (Tr.
65) He promised that he would not have any transgressions in the  future. (Tr. 67)
Applicant inherited or purchased several rifles and guns. (Tr. 99) He denied that
he was a collector of firearms or ammunition. (Tr. 100, 132) For example, he purchased
a Walter P38 Nazi relic, a World War II Luger pistol, and a Valmet fold stock 5.56, which
is an AK-style rifle. (Tr. 100-101) He currently owns seven to ten firearms. (Tr. 136) In
2017, he spent about $12,000 to purchase two firearms. (Tr. 136) He is currently storing
the firearms he purchased. (Tr. 136) He purchased these items as investments. (Tr. 101)
None of the firearms he currently owns fires a 5.56 milliliter round; however, in November
2014, he owned an AR-15, which fires a 5.56 milliliter round. (Tr. 137) The AR-15 was
stolen in the burglary of his residence in November 2014. (Tr. 137)
Alleged Theft of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and Family Separation
Allowance
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  in  January  2015,  Applicant  was  referred  for  disciplinary
action for violation of Article 121, UCMJ, for receiving Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)
at the with dependent rate for failing to update his records to indicate he was divorced in
2012.  There  was  probable  cause  to  believe  he  fraudulently  submitted  a  document  for
family separation  allowance  (FSA)  for his deployment  in  2014.  He  did not  receive  any
disciplinary action because of his pending court-martial as indicated in SOR ¶ 1.a.
Applicant was married  from 2007  to  January  2012. (Tr. 35,  103) He  believed  his
wife  was upset with  him  because he  dedicated  his life  to being  a  successful Soldier. (Tr.
36) His wife  wanted  to  be  his  top  priority, and  he  advised  her that he  was giving  his career
and   the   Army   top   priority.  (Tr.  36)   Applicant   believed   his  decision   to   give   such   a   high
priority to Army SF caused or contributed to  the end of his marriage. (Tr. 35-36)
Applicant  said  he  provided  his  divorce  decree  to  the  Defense  Finance  and
Accounting  Service  (DFAS),  and  he  completed  the  documentation  to  change  his  BAH
after his divorce from with dependent to single; however, DFAS continued to pay him BAH
at the married or with dependent rate. (Tr. 46, 130; HE 3 at 9) He contacted DFAS three
or four times in the next two months after his divorce, and he asked DFAS to stop paying
him at the with dependents rate. (Tr. 46, 102) He was focused on being a good Soldier
and  completion  of  his SF  missions,  and  he  concluded  DFAS  would  eventually  correct
their mistake. (Tr. 47, 131) The local DFAS office was notorious for being understaffed
and inefficient. (Tr. 47) There is no evidence that he asked his chain of command or the
Inspector General for assistance in getting DFAS to correct his BAH payments. He was
not  confronted  with  the  overpayment  until  he  returned  from  Afghanistan  in  November
2014. (Tr. 132) He did not provide copies of any correspondence sent to DFAS to correct
the BAH overpayment.
Applicant received a BAH overpayment of about $15,000. (Tr. 127) He paid the
overpaid funds back to DFAS in the beginning of 2015. (Tr. 48, 104, 126-127)
In  late  2014, the  Army  Criminal Investigation  Command  and  other law  enforcement
presented  to  Applicant a  DD  Form  1561, which  was allegedly  signed  by  Applicant  on April
18, 2014,  to  apply  for family  separation  allowance  (FSA), which is an  allowance  paid when
a Soldier is separated  from their spouse and/or children while deployed. (HE 3 at 10; AE
J) The  DD  Form 1561  indicates his deployment began  on April 4,  2014,  and he  was “not
divorced   or  legally   separated   from   [his]  spouse.”  (AE   J)   On   May   12,   2014,   a   logistics
branch   lieutenant  colonel,  commanding,  signed   the   DD   Form   1561   (not  an   SF
commander). (AE  J) Applicant said  he  was re-deployed  to  Afghanistan  in April 2014. (Tr.
48)  He denied  that he  filled  out or signed  the  DD  Form  1561, and  he  noted  his first name
was  not  spelled   correctly   on   the   DD   Form   1561.  (Tr. 50-51, 128;   HE  3   at  10)   He  was
never  charged   with   submitting   a   fraudulent  DD   Form   1561   or  BAH  fraud.  (Tr.   52)   He
denied that he  had ever stolen  from  his country. (Tr. 66)
An SF colonel and a former SF soldier described multiple problems with the same
DFAS office that was supposed to process Applicant’s BAH and FSA. (Tr. 109, 113-114,
121-122) The DFAS office may have had difficulties because of the SF operational tempo
and various special pays for SF soldiers. (Tr. 109-111)
Applicant has good credit. (Tr. 53-55) A friend offered him employment at three to
four times his Army pay, and he decided to stay on active duty because he wanted to
deploy with his SF team. (Tr. 55-57, 122-123)
Character Evidence
An  SF  colonel,  who  is  currently  a  battalion  commander,  attended  the  SF
qualifications course with Applicant in 2008, and they subsequently served together in the
same detachment. (Tr. 107, 113) He was aware of Applicant’s court-martial; however, he
still believed that at his core, Applicant had good character. (Tr. 112) A friend described
Applicant as a patriot who wanted to continue to contribute to the Department of Defense.
(Tr.  124)  Numerous  written  character  statements  laud  his  contributions  to  mission
accomplishment while serving as an SF Soldier and Defense contractor. (AE A; AE B)
The general sense of Applicant’s character statements is that he is  patriotic, dedicated,
reliable,  diligent,  brave,  loyal,  friendly,  and  professional.  (AE  A;  AE  B)  Applicant  is
engaged in several charity endeavors. (HE 3 at 5)
In  2014,  Applicant  and  his  team  were  involved  in  a  firefight  in  Afghanistan.
Applicant repeatedly moved through enemy fire, and in the engagement, he  entered a
building and killed three enemy combatants. His actions saved the lives of two Afghan
Soldiers  who  were  medically  evacuated  and  other  team  members  through  his
suppressive  fire  upon  enemy  positions.  He  provided  a  “Narrative  to  Accompany  the
Award” and “Citation to Accompany the Award” for a Bronze Star with V device. (AE C)
However,  he  did  not  provide  the  orders for  the  award  or the  recommendations  for  the
award, which are usually detailed on a DD Form 638.
Applicant  initially  said  he  was  awarded  two  Bronze  Stars,  and  an  Army
Commendation Medal (ARCOM) with V device. (Tr. 34-35; AE D) Then he said, “I had a
Bronze  Star  with  valor.  That  was  talked  about  being  upgraded  to  a  Silver  Star.  I  had
another ARCOM with valor that same trip.” (Tr. 35)  He reiterated that he had an “Army
Commendation Medal and the Bronze Star with Valor.” (Tr. 35)
Applicant’s DD Form 214 shows that he received the following Army awards and
badges: two Bronze Star Medals (BSM); one Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM) with
V Device; two Army Good Conduct Medals (AGCM); one National Defense Service Medal
(NDSM); one Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (GWTSM); two Noncommissioned
Officer Professional Development Ribbons (NCOPDR); one Army Service Ribbon (ASR);
one  NATO  Medal;  Combat  Infantryman  Badge  (CIB);  SF  Tab;  Ranger  Tab;  Military
Freefall  Parachutist  Badge;  Parachutist  Badge;  Special  Operations  Diver  Badge;  and
Expert Marksmanship Badge with Carbine. (AE D) He successfully completed numerous
training courses. (Id.) The narrative and citation Applicant submitted do not establish with
certainty that he was awarded a Bronze Star with V device. His DD Form 214 listing of
medals, awards, and badges is given greater weight  than the narrative and citation he
submitted and his claims that he received a Bronze Star with V device. See AE D.
Applicant  believes  he  has  changed  since  November  2014,  and  is  now  a  better
person.  (Tr.  143)  The  “darkness  and  death”  of  his  combat  experiences  temporarily
clouded his judgment. (Tr. 143) He loves the United States, and he promised to serve
honorably  in  the  future.  (Tr.  143)  With  a  security  clearance,  he  can  increase  his
contributions to the national defense. (Tr. 143)

"In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  allegations in  SOR ¶¶  1.b  and
2.a  in  part and  3.a-3.g, with  explanations. His  admissions in his  answer and  at the  hearing
are incorporated in  my findings of  fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  manufacturing  technician  employed  by  defense
contractors since February 2014. He has held a security clearance since August 2004.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in June 2016. He has been married since December 2009
and has an 11-year-old son and two stepchildren, ages 20 and 16, who live with him and
his wife. (Tr. 23.) Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps while in high school and
served on active duty, including two tours of duty in a combat zone, from August 2004 to
February 2013, when he received a dishonorable discharge. (Tr. 26-27.)
Criminal Conduct, cross-alleged as Personal Conduct (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a).
The  SOR  alleges  that  an  allegation  of  child  physical  abuse  was  substantiated
against Applicant based on unexplained injuries inflicted on the child between August and
December 2010  (SOR  ¶1.a).  It  also  alleges  that  he  was  convicted  by  court-martial for
aggravated assault and child endangerment in December 2012  after his ten-month-old
son suffered severe immersion burns in August 2011 while in his care (SOR ¶ 1.b).
In December 2010, Applicant and his wife took their infant son to a doctor for a
scratched palate. Their son was two months old at the time. The doctor found no problem
with the palate but found signs of a fractured rib. Further examination  found signs of a
fractured  clavicle  and  possible  deformity  of  the  distal  femur.  The  doctor  reported  his
findings  to  the  local  civilian  child  protection  service,  who  in  turn  reported  them  to  the
military  family  advocacy  program  (FAP).  The  FAP  Incident  Determination  Committee
concluded that the incident met the criteria for entering a determination of child physical
abuse in the DOD Central Registry database. (GX 3 at 27-28.)
Applicant claimed he did not know how his son’s injuries could have occurred. His
wife declined to be interviewed.  Applicant was not sure whether his mother-in-law was
interviewed. (Tr. 41.) The FAP investigation could not determine who caused the injuries.
The baby was removed from the home and placed with Applicant’s sister-in-law. The FAP
Clinical  Counseling  Service  recommended  multiple  counseling  programs,  workshops,
and support programs for Applicant and his wife if the allegations of child physical abuse
were confirmed. The Clinical Counseling Service determined that the risk of future abuse
was  low  and  that  the  recommendation  for  the  various  programs  was  made  to  further
reduce the level of risk. (GX 3 at 29.) The child was returned to the home in June 2011,
when  Applicant  was  reassigned  to  another  location.  The  FAP  at  his  new  duty  station
received  an  email  from  the  previous  FAP  stating  that  Applicant  had  completed  his
treatment plan and the case was being closed. (GX 3 at 27.) The record does not reflect
what his treatment plan required. The FAP at his new duty station closed the case without
further action. (GX 3 at 2-3, 22.)
In August 2011, Applicant’s son  suffered severe scalding burns covering 35% of
his body while in a bathtub of hot water. Applicant had decided to bathe his son while his
wife was taking a nap. He placed his son in the bathtub, turned on the water with his son
sitting  in  the  tub  with  his  back  to  the  faucet.  He  left  the  water  run  for  a  few  minutes,
touched it about three times to check the temperature, and then stepped away for 30-45
seconds, facing away from his son, to retrieve soap from the vanity.  He heard his son
whimper, and he turned around and saw his son on his back, screaming, squirming and
trying to get up. When he took his son out of the tub, the water was very hot, and the skin
on his son’s back and arms was blistered. He immediately called 911 and reported that
his  son  had  been  burned  and  that  his  skin  was  peeling.  (GX  3  at  21-22.)  The  NCIS
determined that that the hot water temperature in Applicant’s home was 145.9  degrees
instead of the customary 130 degrees. (GX 3 at 11.)
After Applicant’s son received skin grafts and was released from the hospital, he
was placed  in the  custody  of  Applicant’s mother-in-law. A military protective order was
issued, limiting Applicant’s contact with his children. (GX 3 at 13.) Applicant was required
to move into the barracks, where he remained until his court-martial in December 2012.
(Tr. 41-43.)
Applicant  was  charged  with  four  specifications  of  assault  consummated  by  a
battery on a child, in violation of Article 128, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C.
§ 928, and five specifications of child endangerment by culpable negligence, in violation
of Article 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S. C. § 934. He was tried by general court-martial in December
2012.  He  was  found  not  guilty  of  all  four  specifications  of  assault  consummated  by  a
battery on a child and not guilty of four of the five specifications of child endangerment.
He was convicted of one specification of child endangerment by culpable negligence. The
maximum punishment prescribed for child endangerment in the 2008 version of Manual
for  Courts-Martial  (applicable  because  the  offense  was  committed  in  2011)  was  a
dishonorable  discharge,  forfeiture  of  all  pay  and  allowances,  and  confinement  for  two
years. He was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge and confinement for 60 days. He
was released from confinement after serving 30 days.
Applicant  testified  that  his  son  is  receiving  reconstructive  surgery,  but  not  any
mental-health counseling. He testified that he and his wife received  “a lot  of  training or
counseling” while their son was in the custody of his mother-in-law, but nothing after the
family was reunited. (Tr. 42-43.)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  seven  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $16,793.  The  debts
alleged  in  the  SOR  are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  December  2018  and  February
2020, as well as three credit reports from December 2021 submitted by Applicant after
the hearing (GX 3 and 4; AX S, T, and U.)
Applicant  was  unemployed  for  about  two  months  after  being  discharged  in
February 2013. He worked at minimum-wage jobs as a cashier in a supermarket and in
a  gas  station  from  April  2013  to  February  2014,  when  he  was  hired  by  his  current
employer. (GX 1 at 12-14; Tr. 48.) He, his wife, his stepchildren, and his son all lived with
his mother-in-law, because they had no savings and could not afford to find a place to
live. (Tr. 52-53.)
Applicant  hired  a  law  firm  in  February  2019  to  negotiate  with  creditors  and  to
remove incorrect information from his credit reports. (GX 2 at 12.) He provided copies of
two letters prepared for him by his law firm and sent to one of the credit bureaus and 27
letters sent to the creditors alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.c-3.g. The letters request verification of
the debts. All letters were sent before the SOR was issued. (AX F.)
The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶  3.a:  collection account  for $8,163.  During a personal subject interview
(PSI) in April 2019, Applicant told the investigator that he was unaware of this account
when he submitted his SCA, and he did not know anything about it. (GX 2 at 9.) It was
sold to a factoring company in August 2016. The original creditor is an on-line bank. (GX
4 at 16.) In May 2019, July 2019, September 2019, and November 2019, Applicant sent
letters to  collection agency reflected  in the December 2018  credit report (GX 4  at  16.)
disputing  the  validity  of  the  debt.  (AX  F  at  6,  13,  17,  23.)  There  is  no  evidence  of  a
response  to  his  letters,  but  the  February  2020  credit  report  reflects  that  the  debt  is
disputed. (GX 5 at 2.) It is not resolved. (AX Q at 1; AX S at 36.)
SOR  ¶   3.b:   credit-card  account   charged  off  for  $3,892.  During  the  PSI,
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  failed  to  disclose  this  debt  in  his  SCA  due  an
oversight. He used the credit card for living expenses and fell behind on his payments
after his dishonorable discharge from the Marine Corps. (GX 2 at 12.) This account was
closed at his request and settled for the full balance. (AX Q at 3.)
SOR  ¶   3.c:   collection  account   for  $1,294.  During  the  PSI,  Applicant  told  the
investigator that he thought this debt was for a credit card. (GX 2 at 9.) The December
2018 credit report reflects that the current creditor is a factoring company, and the account
is being collected by the same collection agency as the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 3.a. It was
included in the dispute letters for the debt in SOR ¶ 3.a. (AX F at 6,13, 17, 23.) There is
no evidence of a response to his letters, but the February 2020 credit report reflects that
the debt is disputed. (GX 5 at 2.) It is not resolved. (AX Q at 2; AX S at 37; AX T.)
SOR  ¶   3.d:   credit-card  account   charged  off  for  $1,095.   During  the  PSI,
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  failed  to  disclose  this  debt  in  his  SCA  due  to
oversight, and that he fell behind on his payments in 2016 due to low income. (GX 2 at
12.) The debt was charged off in February 2018. (GX 4 at 6.) Applicant sent letters to this
creditor  in  August  2019,  October  2019,  and  March  2020,  disputing  this  debt  as
“suspicious,”  and  claiming  a  possible  violation  of  the  Servicemembers  Civil  Relief  Act.
(AX F at 7, 14, and 19.) There is no evidence of a response to his letters, but the February
2020 credit report reflects that the debt is disputed. (GX 5 at 2.) It is not resolved. (AX Q
at 2; AX S at 25.)
SOR ¶  3.e:  unsecured loan charged off for  $607. During the PSI, Applicant told
the investigator that he used this loan to pay household expenses and medical expenses
for his children, and that he fell behind on his payments in 2018 due to low income. (GX
2 at 11.) This debt was settled for less than the full amount in April 2020. (AX Q at 4; AX
R.)
SOR ¶  3.f:  department-store  charge  account  placed for collection of  $764. In
the PSI, Applicant was not able to provide any information about this debt. The December
2018 credit report reflects that the debt is held by a factoring company and was referred
for collection in June 2017. (GX 4 at16.) Applicant sent letters disputing the validity of this
debt in March 2019, May 2019, June 2019, August 2019, October 2019, December 2019,
and February 2020. (AX F at 8, 11, 12, 15, 20, 21, 24, 28, and 31.) There is no evidence
of a response to his letters, but the debt is not reflected in the February 2020 credit report
or the December 2021 credit report. (GX 5; AX S.)
SOR ¶ 3.g: mail-order debt placed for collection of $764. In the PSI, Applicant
was unable to provide any information about this debt. (GX 2 at 11.) The December 2018
credit report reflects that this account was closed in July 2017 and purchased by another
lender. (GX 4 at 8.) Applicant sent letters disputing this account in April 2019, June 2019,
July 2019, and September 2019. (AX F at 18, 22, 25, 26, and 29.) There is no evidence
of a response to his letters, but the debt is not reflected in the February 2020 credit report
or the December 2021 credit report. (GX 5; AX S.)
Applicant’s wife is not employed outside the home. Applicant earns about $73,000
per  year.  He  volunteered  for  a  four-month  assignment  overseas  to  earn  additional
income. (Tr. 50.) Based on his first four-year enlistment in the Marine Corps, he was able
to use his educational benefits to obtain his college degree.
In addition to hiring a law firm to assist him, Applicant has educated himself about
budgeting and financial management. (Tr. 22, 59.) He has adopted a “snowball” method
of accumulating funds to pay off or settle debts. (Answer to SOR.) His recent credit reports
reflect that he has a total of nine credit cards and charge cards, and he has a zero balance
on eight and only a total of $19 in credit-card debt. (AX S at 1-10.)
Applicant  qualified  for  a  Department  of  Veterans’  Affairs  loan  and  purchased  a
home. His monthly payment on his home mortgage loan is $1,375, and it is current. (Tr.
60.) He drives an 11-year-old car that is paid off. (Tr. 61.) His wife drives a 2017 car that
they purchased in 2020. The monthly payment on her car is $273 and it is current. (Tr.
60-61.)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s pastor, who has known him and his family since 2014, describes him
as “authentic, sensitive, friendly, honest, reliable, and always willing to help others.” He
considers  Applicant  a  great  role  model  for  his  son  and  two  stepsons  and  a  faithful
husband. (AX A.) The record does not reflect whether Applicant’s pastor is aware of the
allegations of criminal conduct.
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  had  custody  of  Applicant’s  son  after  the  August  2011
incident.  She  considers  Applicant  to  be  honest,  conscientious,  polite,  and  a  “family
person.” She considers his integrity to be above reproach. (AX B.)
Applicant’s first-line supervisor describes him as “extremely accountable, punctual,
respectful,  quick-learning,  and  an  all-around  pleasure  to  work  with.”  He  has  a  positive
attitude and demonstrates how much he cares about his work and helping others. (AX
C.) In  July  2021, he  evaluated  Applicant as a  “total team  player”  who  is “continuing  to
grow  as  a  technician  as  well  as  a  leader.”  (AX  H.)  He  nominated  Applicant  for  two
achievement awards in December 2021. (AX D and E.) Applicant’s team was recognized
for exceptional performance in April 2017, July 2018, December 2019, December 2020,
and  November  2021.  (AX  I,  and  K-O.)  He  received  pay  raises  in  2019  and  2020,
increasing his base pay from $56,000 to $73,986. (AX G.)
",True
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He
also provided extenuating and mitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted
as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  nuclear  inspector,  who  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor for three years. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1) In 2006, he received a General Educational
Diploma  (GED).  (Tr.  6)  He  has  some  college  credits;  however,  he  did  not  receive  a
degree. (Tr. 7) He has not served in the military and has never been married. (Tr. 7) He
does not have any children. (Tr. 7)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges five student-loan debts totaling $31,425, which were placed for
collection as follows: ¶ 1.a for $9,646; ¶ 1.b for $8,801; ¶ 1.d for $5,685; ¶ 1.e for $5,326;
and ¶ 1.f for $1,967. His SOR also alleges a charged-off vehicle-related loan in ¶ 1.c for
$6,772 and two delinquent medical debts in ¶ 1.g for $1,427 and ¶ 1.h for $194.
Applicant went to  a  college  that  was implicated  in fraudulent  activity.  (Tr. 16) The
college  closed,  and  the  credits he  earned  were not transferable because  the  college  was
not  accredited.  (Tr. 45-46) He  made  some  payments  on  his  student loans.  (Tr. 45)  He
believed   he   could   be   released   from   liability   for  his   student  loans.   The   Department  of
Education  (ED) holds the  student loans in SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and  1.f.  About two
years ago, Applicant contacted  ED  and  learned  ED  wanted  him  to  start payments. (Tr.
17) Applicant was trying  to  get a  deferment until he  could obtain a  release  from  the  student
loans.  (Tr. 17-21) He said his most recent  credit report does not  reflect his student-loan
debts.  (Tr. 17-18)  However,  his  January 31,  2020  credit  report,  the  most  recent  credit
report of record, states the five student loans were opened in the 2011 to 2013 timeframe
and reflects their transfer to collection status in 2017. (GE 3) The amounts in the SOR
are the amounts the five accounts are shown as delinquent in this credit report. (GE 3)
He does not have any documentation showing he attempted to settle his ED debt. (Tr.
18)
On  February  4,  2022,  the  Federal  Student  Loan  Borrower  Defense  Customer
Service emailed Applicant and advised him:
We  have  received  your  application  for a  borrower defense  discharge  of  your
dent loans under the  borrower defense  to  repayment rules  at 34
federal stu
C.F.R. §  685.206(c)  (2017).  .  . . We  will notify  you  once  a  decision  has been
made  on  your application.  If  your borrower defense  claim  is approved, we
will  determine  how  much  debt relief  (0%   -100%) to  provide  based  on  the
amount  of financial harm  you  suffered as a  result of your school’s conduct.
(AE C)
On March 25, 2022, ED emailed Applicant and gave him updated information about his
borrower  defense.  (AE  C)  ED  advised  that  he  could  provide  additional  information  to
assist in reconciling his claims. (Id.) In 2018, Applicant’s federal income  tax refund was
diverted to pay his student-loan debt. (GE 2) His student loans are no longer in collection
status pending resolution of his claim. (AE C)
As for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c for $6,772, Applicant said he borrowed money in 2012
to purchase a car, and it was voluntarily repossessed. (Tr. 20) He made $100 to $150
monthly payments for about five years to address this debt. (Tr. 19; AE B) He believed
this account was in good standing. (Tr. 19) On January 31, 2022, the creditor wrote that
he paid off 95 percent of the loan and now owes $1,246. (AE B)
SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h allege and Applicant admitted that he had delinquent medical
debts for $1,427 and $194. (SOR response) He had some discussions with creditors or
collection  agents.  (Tr.  22)  He  is  considering  some  options  on  how  to  settle  the  larger
medical  debt.  (Tr.  22)  He  believes  he  paid  the  smaller  medical  debt.  (Tr.  23-24)  His
January 31, 2020 credit report shows both debts are in collections. (GE 3) His January
31, 2020 credit report also shows that his non-SOR debts are paid or current. (GE 3)
Criminal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.l alleges in about December 2006, Applicant was charged with failure to
appear on a misdemeanor charge, and in about February 2007, he was convicted of this
charge. However, he did not remember the underlying misdemeanor charge. (Tr. 28; SOR
response; GE 5) Under state law, failure to appear on a misdemeanor charge is itself a
misdemeanor. (GE 5)
SOR  ¶  2.h  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  in  about  March  2012,  he  was
charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).  (Tr. 28; SOR response; GE 5;
GE 6) In his April 29, 2019 SCA, he disclosed that he was arrested for DUI in 2012 and
convicted  of  DUI.  (GE  1)  He  received  a  $500  fine  and  five  days  in  jail.  (GE  1;  GE  2)
According to the FBI record and state record, he was convicted of reckless driving in June
2012. (GE 5; GE 6) Under state law, the first and second DUIs and reckless driving are
misdemeanors.
SOR ¶ 2.k alleges and Applicant admitted that in about July 2012, he was
charged with driving with a suspended license. (Tr. 28; SOR response) Under state law,
driving with a suspended or revoked license is a misdemeanor.
SOR  ¶  2.j  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  in  about  August  2012,  he  was
charged with driving with an expired registration. (Tr. 28; SOR response) Under state law,
driving with an expired registration is a traffic infraction and not a criminal offense.
SOR  ¶  2.i  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  in  about  October  2012,  he  was
charged with an HOV violation and with speeding. (Tr. 28; SOR response) Under state
law, an HOV violation and speeding are traffic infractions and not criminal offenses.
SOR ¶ 2.g alleges and Applicant admitted that in about May 2013, he was charged
with driving while intoxicated (DWI) first offense, and in about September 2013, he was
convicted  of  DWI.  (Tr.  27-28;  SOR  response;  GE  5)  In  his  August  8,  2019  Office  of
Personnel Management  (OPM) interview,  Applicant  said  he  was  arrested for DWI and
speeding, and he received a $500 fine and two weeks in jail. (GE 2)
SOR ¶ 2.f alleges and Applicant admitted that in about July 2013, he was charged
with  illegally  carrying  a  concealed  weapon.  (Tr.  28;  SOR  response)  The  concealed
weapon charge was dismissed when Applicant went to court. (GE 2) Applicant admitted
he had a firearm in his vehicle when the police stopped his vehicle. (GE 2)
SOR ¶ 2.e alleges and Applicant admitted that in about July 2013, he was charged
with DUI, and in about September 2013, he was convicted of this offense (Tr. 28; SOR
response).  The  state  record  supports  this  DUI  arrest  and  conviction  (GE  6);  however,
Applicant said he only had one DUI in 2013.
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges in about April 2014, Applicant was arrested for a capias or arrest
warrant for a State Alcohol Safety Action Program (SASAP) violation. In about July 2014,
he was convicted of violating his parole when he failed to complete the terms of his DUI
conviction. He admitted he violated one of the SASAP rules; he turned himself in to the
police;  and  he  was  convicted  of  a  parole  violation.  (Tr.  27;  SOR  response)  A  parole
violation is a misdemeanor offense.
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges and Applicant admitted that in about December 2018, he was
charged with driving with a suspended driver’s license and fail to obey highway sign. (Tr.
26;  SOR  response)  Under  state  law,  driving  with  a  suspended  driver’s  license  is  a
misdemeanor, and fail to obey traffic sign is a traffic infraction and not a criminal offense.
SOR ¶  2.b  alleges in about January  2019, Applicant was charged  with  driving  with
a  suspended  license.  He said  when  the  police  officer stopped  him, he  became  aware that
his driver’s license  was suspended. (Tr. 26) The  police  officer issued  a  ticket to him. (Tr.
26)  He  did  not know  why  his driver’s license  was suspended  in 2018  and  2019,  and  he
suggested  he  might have  owed  money  on  a  ticket.  (Tr. 43)  Under state  law, driving  with
a suspended  driver’s license is a  misdemeanor.
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges in about January 2019, Applicant was charged with texting or
emailing  while  driving.  He  said  a  police  officer  mistakenly  believed  he  was  texting
because he was holding his phone in his hand. (Tr. 25) Nevertheless, the police officer
wrote him a ticket for texting while driving. (Tr. 25) He paid a fine for the texting ticket.
(GE 2) Under state law, illegally using a handheld personal communications device while
driving is a traffic infraction and not a criminal offense.
Applicant said he was arrested for three DUIs, with the most recent DUI being in
2020. (Tr. 29, 42) One of the DUIs in the SOR was reduced to reckless driving. (Tr. 42)
Under  state  law,  reckless  driving  is  a  misdemeanor.  For  the  first  two  DUIs,  his  blood
alcohol content (BAC) was .08, and for his 2020 DUI his BAC was .12. (Tr. 43) He was
convicted of the 2020 DUI. (Tr. 44) His driver’s license is currently revoked. (Tr. 44)
In 2013, 2016, and 2021, Applicant successfully completed alcohol safety action
programs (ASAP). (Tr. 30-31, 44; AE A) He improved his handling of alcohol. (Tr. 30) He
said he reduced his alcohol consumption after 2013. (Tr. 29)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 3.a and 3.c allege Applicant failed to disclose on his April 29, 2019 SCA
that he  was  fired  in  October 2017 from  employment  at a  store for sexual harassment.
Applicant said he touched a person he considered a friend on her shoulder, and he said
“I hope you feel better.” (Tr. 32) In his August 8, 2019 OPM interview, Applicant said he
grabbed his coworker by the shoulders and squeezed them two or three times to show
that he was happy she was back at work after an illness. (GE 2)  The “shoulder touch”
was caught on camera, and “turned into a huge situation.” (Tr. 32) He was fired for sexual
harassment.  (Tr.  32)  He  said  he  answered  no  to  the  question  about  being  fired  or
terminated from employment because he misunderstood the question. (Tr. 36)  He was
given  an  opportunity  to  disclose  the  firing  for  sexual  harassment  during  his  OPM
interview,  and  he  did  not  provide  information  about  it  until  the  OPM  investigator
confronted him with information about the sexual harassment allegation. (GE 2)
SOR ¶¶ 3.b alleges Applicant failed to disclose on his April 29, 2019 SCA that he
had the delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h, supra. He said he misread the SCA
question  about  having debts  in  collections,  charged-off  debts,  repossessions,  or debts
delinquent more than 120 days. (Tr. 37-40)
SOR  ¶  3.d  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  terminated  around  May
2015 from his employment at a store for punctuality and attendance infractions. (Tr. 33;
SOR response) He disclosed three reprimands for lack of punctuality and his firing on his
April 29, 2019 SCA. (GE 1)
SOR ¶ 3.e alleges and Applicant admitted that he resigned in lieu of being fired
around October 2012 from his employment at a credit union. (Tr. 33; SOR response) He
was unable to attend college classes and work at his other job as well as at the credit
union. (Tr. 34) He disclosed on his April 29, 2019 SCA that he quit this job after being told
he was going to be terminated. (GE 1)
SOR  ¶  3.f  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  discharged  from  his
employment at a financial institution around February 2012 for performance issues. (Tr.
35; SOR response) He was terminated because a check was missing, and his employer
decided Applicant was at fault. (Tr. 35) He disclosed on his April 29, 2019 SCA that he
was discharged after losing a check. (GE 1)
SOR ¶ 3.g cross alleges the criminal conduct in SOR ¶ 2 as a personal conduct

"Applicant is a  44-year-old laborer, employed by a defense contractor  since July
2019. He is also self-employed as an independent contractor as an executive protection
(bodyguard)  service  provider  since  2014.  He  was  previously  employed  in  an  armed
security  position  from  January  to  July  2019;  agent-in-charge  of  special  events/field
training officer/site lead from February 2018 to August 2018; executive protection officer
from  June  2017  to  July  2019  for  two  other  companies;  VIP  security  host  lead  from
December  2011  to  October  2014;  and  security  supervisor  from  October  2009  to
December  2011.  Applicant  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  2004.  He  was  previously
married in 2016 and divorced in November 2018.  He remarried in February 2022, and
has no children. He has never held a security clearance.
The original SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with
varying frequency from about July 1993 to about January 2019; and he used cocaine with
varying frequency from about February 2008 to about January 2019. Under Guideline G,
the  SOR  alleges  Applicant  was  arrested  in  another  state,  in  about  December  2004,
charged and convicted of DUI; and he was arrested in about August 2017 and charged
with DUI and open container of alcohol in a vehicle. Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-
alleges the previous SOR allegations, and that he was arrested in about March 2015 and
charged with trespassing, a charge in which he pleaded guilty; and in September 2016,
he committed domestic battery against his former spouse. This allegation was amended
to  allege  that  his  former  spouse  accused  him  of  domestic  battery  on  at  least  three
occasions in July, August, and September 2016. In addition, the amended SOR added
allegations new ¶ 4.a, under Guideline E, cross-alleging SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b regarding
marijuana  and  cocaine  use;  ¶¶  2.b  alleging  the  2017  DUI  charge,  and  ¶¶  3.b  and  3.c
alleging the trespassing conviction and domestic battery accusations. Applicant admitted
to all of the original SOR allegations except SOR ¶ 3.c (alleging domestic battery against
his former spouse), and generally objected to the amended SOR allegations.
Applicant  admitted  to  using  marijuana  recreationally  and  regularly,  usually  on
weekends  and  when  socializing,  from  1993  to  2019.  He  both  purchased  it  and  it  was
provided by friends. He purchased marijuana approximately twice per month from about
1998 to about 2016, and approximately once per month from about 2016 to 2019. Of note,
he  denied  purchasing  marijuana  when  interviewed  by  a  Government  investigator  in
December 2019. He also declared the accuracy of his personal subject interview (PSI)
summary in a January 2021, interrogatory response. (GE 2)
Applicant  testified  that  he  used  cocaine  recreationally  about  “once  every  six
months,”  from  about  2008  to  January 2019,  usually  at  social  gatherings.  However,  he
also  inconsistently  stated  in  testimony  that  he  only  used  cocaine  three  to  four  times.
However,  in  his  PSI,  he  stated  he  used  cocaine  with  his  former  spouse  “weekly  to
quarterly” during social settings at nightclubs. (GE 2) During this period of illegal drug use,
he worked in several security and executive protection positions, purchased firearms in
2009, 2010, and 2020, and held a concealed firearm permit (CFP) for executive protection
and personal safety, issued by his current state of residence in 2013 and renewed it in
2018. It remains valid until 2023. The CFP application (Rev 8/19) states:
You   are  not  eligible   to   carry   a   Concealed   Firearm   Permit  if   any   of   the
following   apply:  .  .  .   (6)  You   have   habitually   used   intoxicating   liquor  or  a
controlled  substance  to  the  extent that  your normal faculties are impaired,
including DUI convictions within five previous years and Medical Marijuana
Patients. (AE B)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed his use of marijuana “occurred on my
personal  time.”  However,  he  admitted  that  in  2006,  he  was  working  security  and
bodyguard jobs in nightclubs and “on the entertainment scene” and “was exposed to the
good and the bad that went along with it.” He stated that he initially rejected cocaine that
was  offered  to  him,  but  eventually  gave  in  and  used  it  “to  understand  the  effects  and
correlate it with the behaviors [he] experienced as a security/bodyguard.” At times it was
“offered to [him] from someone [he] or a client of [his] was interacting with.”
Applicant  testified  that  he  stopped  using  marijuana  and  cocaine  on  or  about
January 1, 2019, partly as a result of a new year’s resolution. Coincidentally, he began
working  in  an  armed  security  position  in  January  2019  that  required  obtaining  a  state
private investigator license from a state licensing board to carry a firearm, and he worked
armed security for several medical marijuana dispensaries as well as jewelry and trade
shows.  He  also  applied  for  a  security  clearance  in  August  2019.  In  a  post-hearing
submission,  Applicant  provided  a  signed  notice  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement and substance misuse. He also stated he has never failed an employment,
pre-screening, or random drug test, and that he has disassociated from acquaintances
with whom he used drugs in the past. (AE B)
In December 2004, Applicant was arrested in another state for DUI at an impaired
driving  checkpoint.  He  was  convicted  in  2005,  placed  on  probation,  and  required  to
complete alcohol-related classes. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he was driving
home from  a work-related  holiday  party.  He  said  he  “gained  valuable  insight from  that
experience.”
In 2017, Applicant was again arrested for DUI and open container of alcohol after
he drove into a tree after returning from a bachelor party at 5 a.m. He was the “designated
driver” for his friends during the evening. He testified that he had a “shot or two” during
the evening, but denied that alcohol contributed to the accident. Of note, in his answer to
the SOR, he admitted to  having “a  drink a  couple drinks  [sic]  with  dinner”  at  a  casino.
When the police found an open container and a closed beer in his armrest, he stated they
were placed there without his knowledge. He said he “dozed off a mile, or less, from home
assumedly because [he] was in familiar surroundings and [his] body was  comfortable.”
He was given a field sobriety test at the scene but he refused a breathalyzer test because
he “felt their demeanor and attitude switch towards [him] and [he] no longer trusted the
process.” (Ans.) He was arrested for DUI and open container. The police suspected drunk
driving and obtained a warrant to take blood samples, but it was hours after the accident.
Applicant stated that his subsequent blood tests showed his blood alcohol level was under
the legal limit. He was not ultimately charged with drunk driving, but was found guilty of
failure to maintain a lane and having an open container of alcohol in his vehicle.
In  2015,  Applicant  was  charged  with  trespassing.  He  testified  that  he  was  at  a
casino  when  he  had  a  vocal  disagreement  with  a  card  dealer  and  management  over
errors he perceived were committed by the table dealer. Of note, he did not mention his
disagreement  with  the  dealer  during  his  PSI,  rather  he  stated  he  was  drinking  while
playing a table game “without incident” when the table game manager asked him to stop
playing and leave. He believed he was being treated unfairly and disrespected, and he
refused to leave the casino even though the manager and security officials told him they
would call the police. He believed it was a “peaceful protest” for the way in which he was
treated. Applicant was arrested, offered a deal to plead no contest, and was convicted of
trespass. In his answer to the SOR, he claimed the incident was a result of racism and
other  factors,  was  asked  “one  last  time  to  leave  or  be  arrested,”  and  that  he  was
“comfortable protesting and standing up for what [he] believed was right.” He noted that
since  then,  he  has  “meditated  and  looked  back  on  the  situation  and  understands  that
there are some things that are out of [his] control and it is better to remove [himself] from
those situations than to add fuel to the fire.”
Applicant married his former spouse in May 2016, but they lived together before
marrying. He moved out in October 2016, and their divorce was final in December 2016.
In  a  September  2016  police  report  to  her  local  police  department,  Applicant’s  former
spouse accused him of choking her and shaking her in July 2016 while they were at his
mother’s home in another state. She also accused him of pulling her hair and choking her
during  an  argument  in  September  2016,  while  they  were  again  visiting  his  family  in
another  state.  She  did  not  report  the  July  incident  because  they  were  at  his  mother’s
home  in  another  state,  and  that  she  thought  he  would  change.  She  reported  the
September incident about four days after it occurred, apparently after returning to their
state  of  residence.  No  arrest  was  made  because  the  incidents  occurred  in  another
jurisdiction.
In  the  same  police  report,  Applicant’s former spouse  also  alleged  an  incident  in
August  2016,  where  they  were  drinking  at  a  bar when  he  began  arguing  with  her  and
made a scene. She left the bar and Applicant followed. He blocked her from entering their
vehicle and continued arguing. He became angry and pulled her hair and yelled without
letting it go. At some point, he drew his firearm, pointed it at himself, and yelled “what do
you  want me  to  do, blow  my brains out”?  She  did not report the  incident at the  time  it
occurred because she thought he would change.  Applicant admitted drinking that night
and taking out his firearm and threatening to kill himself, but denied pulling her hair. He
also denied the alleged strangling incident in September 2016, and said he never had a
physical encounter with her except “face-to-face encounters.”
Applicant’s  current wife’s cousin and his supervisor testified on  his behalf. They
generally  attested  to  his  reliability  and  good character,  but  his  wife’s  cousin,  a  military
member that has known him for three years, was unaware of any issues with alcohol or
drugs.  Neither were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant  also submitted  character
letters from  co-worker  and  a  training director/apprentice  coordinator. Both  attest  to  his
work ethic, positive attitude, reliability, accountability, and willingness to take on greater
responsibilities  and  to  teach  new  apprentices,  but  neither  mentioned  specific  SOR
allegations. Additionally, Applicant’s current spouse wrote a strong, supportive letter on
his behalf, attesting to his judgment, kindness, reliability, and compassion. Applicant also
noted that after his divorce in 2016, he enrolled in personal counseling with a licensed
therapist  to  address  his  emotional  and  mental  concerns.  No  records  of  diagnosis  or
treatment were submitted from these counseling sessions.
",False
"In Applicant’s original answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a
and denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b. In his amended answer to the SOR, he did not
expressly admit or deny SOR ¶ 2.a, but he argued that it was irrelevant. I have treated
his response to SOR ¶ 2.a as a denial. Applicant’s admissions in his answer and at the
hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 38-year-old business intelligence developer employed by a defense
contractor  since  June  2018.  He  worked  for  a  home-improvement  store  for  about  six
months  before  being  hired  by  his  current  employer.  He  has  never  held  a  security
clearance. He has never married and has no children. His father is a retired Navy veteran.
His father and brother are both disabled, and he takes care of them. (Tr. 2 at 16, 119.)
In March 2001, Applicant, then 17 years old, was employed at a gas station located
on a military installation. Because the amount of the money in the cash register did not
match the amount of gas that was sold, an investigation was initiated. There was a cash
shortage of $20.87 on March 30, 2001, and a surveillance camera was installed in the
office, which captured a video of Applicant taking money from the cash register. He was
accused of embezzling about $200 by ringing a “no sale” on the cash register on several
occasions and keeping the cash. At the hearing, he admitted taking money from the cash
register, but stated that he needed exact change for bus fare and sometimes exchanged
his money for smaller bills or change in the cash register. (Tr. 2 at 14-15.)
At the  hearing, Applicant  testified  that  he  believed  the  cash  shortage  at the  gas
station  occurred  because   employees  programmed  the  gas pumps  incorrectly  so  that a
$1.97  transaction   was  registered   as   19   cents.  He   believed   that   the   programming   error
caused  the  loss of about $3,000  and  triggered  the  investigation.  (Tr.  2  at 99.)  He  testified
that,  after the  investigation,  the  loss-prevention  supervisor concluded  that there was no
embezzlement,   and   no   further  action   was  taken.  (Tr.   2   at  14-16.)  The   incident  report
reflects that Applicant was turned  over to  his mother, but it does not reflect any  legal or
administrative  actions  taken  against  him.  (GX  3.) This incident was the  basis for SOR ¶
1.b.   The   juvenile   court   records  of   the   jurisdiction   where  Applicant  resided   and   worked
reflect no  record of  a  charge  or conviction  of  embezzlement or any  other criminal activity.
(Answer to SOR, Exhibit B.)
Applicant attended a community college from 2002 to 2006, while working as an
information technology consultant and earning about $40,000 per year. He dropped out
of school because he was failing. His girlfriend at the time (GF), who was nine years older
than him and who worked for a credit union, introduced him to business friend (BF) who
was involved in real estate.
BF was the owner and operator of a real estate development company as well as
the  owner  and  operator  of  an  apartment  building  management  company.  He  had  a
reputation for successfully revitalizing communities. (GX 8 at 20.) He and several others
purchased  multiple-family  buildings,  converted  them  to  condominiums,  and  sold  the
condominiums as individual units. BF’s business staff  included a mortgage broker, two
experienced  realtors,  a  certified  real  estate  appraiser,  and  an  experienced  real  estate
lawyer, all of whom were in their 30s and 40s. One realtor was in his 60s. (GX 10 at 2.)
Around September 2006, BF offered Applicant an opportunity to become involved in the
enterprise, and Applicant accepted it. (Tr. 2 at 17-18.). He was 23 years old at the time.
(GX 1 at 7.)
Applicant,  GF,  BF,  and  others  recruited  buyers  to  purchase  condominiums  as
investment  properties  or  second  homes.  In  fact,  the  properties  were  rentals  and  had
tenants living in them. Buyers were assured that they would not be required to make down
payments, pay closing costs, or be responsible for mortgage payments, even if they did
not have renters in their units. They were promised that they would share in the profits
when the units were sold. (GX 4; Tr. 2 at 57.)
Once a potential buyer agreed to participate, BF and others involved in the scheme
would  engage  mortgage  loan  brokers  and  mortgage  originators  to  prepare  loan
applications which reflected a falsely inflated purchase price; falsely represented that the
buyer would occupy the condominium as a primary or secondary residence; and falsely
represented that the buyer had substantial assets. The buyer’s income would be inflated
in  the  mortgage  application  by  adding  the  anticipated  rental  income  from  the
condominium to the buyer’s other income. (Tr. 2 at 37.) BF and others would arrange with
a closing attorney to prepare false documents, including a HUD-1 settlement statement,
which would falsely represent that the buyer had made a down payment and paid closing
costs. The mortgage lenders would then fund the mortgage loan through a wire transfer
to  the  bank  account  of  the  closing  attorney.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  would  then  be
disbursed to BF, who paid a 3% commission to the person who recruited the buyer. (GX
7 at 6-7.)
Applicant started  an  investment  consulting  business in  April 2007.  (GX  1  at   17.)
He used  this business to  recruit buyers for BF’s enterprise. (GX  4.) Applicant recruited  11
or 12  buyers who were his friends or friends of  his friends. (Tr. 2  at 42.)
In November 2006, Applicant purchased a condominium through BF’s enterprise
as an investment. The purchase price was $302,000. He wrote a check for $1,000. The
documentation for the purchase falsely reflected that he had made a payment of $20,000
for closing costs and had about $23,000 in his bank account. (GX 7 at 8.) On the same
day, he purchased a second condominium in a similar transaction. (GX 9 at 1; Tr 2 at 36.)
He used the rental income from the two condominiums to pay the mortgages. (Tr.  2 at
31-34.)
Applicant was not directly involved in the preparation of the falsified documents.
However,  he  did  attend  about  23  closings,  in  which  he  signed  documents  for  buyers,
using a power of attorney. (Tr. 2 at 46-48.) He testified that he knew the closings included
fraudulent documents, but insisted that he did not intend to participate in fraud. He knew
that the buyers were not paying the closing costs as represented in the documents, but
“everybody  knew  they  were not coming  from  the  buyer. The  lawyers knew. The  banks
know.” (Tr.  2 at  48.) He  testified  that  he  thought  it  “made  sense” for buyers to  include
anticipated future income from rentals in their statements of current assets. (Tr. 2 at 50.)
When he signed closing documents, he thought he was “just signing documents,” and he
was not thinking about whether they were factually correct. (Tr. 2 at 51.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  young  at  the  time  and  depended  on  the  more
experienced members of the operation to know what should be done. He admitted that
his lawyer told him that he was guilty of “willful blindness.” (Tr. 2 at 53.) He admitted that
he had questions about some of the transactions, but the more experienced members of
the enterprise gave him answers, and his concerns were superseded by their experience,
knowledge, and professional licenses. (Tr. 2 at 85.)
Applicant earned a 3% commission for each buyer that he recruited. He expected
to  earn  $182,000,  but  he  received  only  about  $50,000.  He  testified  that  he  stopped
recruiting for BF because he was not being paid. (Tr. 2 at 78.) When the real estate market
declined, most of the mortgage  loans involved in the fraud went into default and some
went into foreclosure. (GX 7 at 7.) During the sentencing proceedings, the government
presented  evidence  that  the  fraudulent  scheme  created  mortgage  company  losses
aggregating $2,844,565 for 16 properties purchased by buyers that Applicant recruited.
(GX 9 at 2.) Applicant’s two  mortgage loans defaulted, and his properties created bank
losses of $239,800 and $284,500 respectively. (GX 9 at 1.)
Court  records  reflect  multiple  judgments  obtained  against  Applicant  between
March 2008 and February 2009. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in May 2009
and his debts were discharged in October 2009. He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition
in August 2010, which was dismissed in December 2010. He filed another Chapter 13
bankruptcy petition in July 2011, which was dismissed in August 2011. (GX 5.)
Applicant was arrested in November 2006. After a lengthy investigation, he was
indicted in September 2010 for 11 counts of wire fraud and 6 counts of bank fraud (GX 7
at 47.) On November 28, 2015, pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to one
count of wire fraud and one count of bank fraud. The remaining counts were dismissed.
(GX 11 at 1) He was sentenced to imprisonment for 24 months and supervised probation
for  36  months  after  release  from  prison.  (GX  11  at  3.)  He  served  his  sentence  and
successfully completed his probation in September 2020. (GX 12.).
While Applicant was awaiting trial, he finished the requirements for an associate’s
degree in December 2010. He earned a bachelor’s degree in May 2013 and  a master’s
degree in May 2015. He also worked for a non-government company as the manager of
business intelligence until he surrendered to government authorities to serve his sentence
to incarceration. His supervisor observed that he demonstrated discretion and integrity in
all his business dealings, that he had a strong sense of community, and that he routinely
volunteered for or directly supported many charitable events to benefit military personnel
and  veterans.  (Answer  to  SOR,  Attachment  1.)  A  coworker  who  became  a  friend
describes him as hardworking, smart, incredibly loyal, and selfless in his efforts to help
others. The coworker is familiar with the facts that led to his conviction and regards them
as  an  anomaly and a life  lesson. She  regards  him as  a faithful and  trustworthy friend.
(Answer to SOR, Attachment 2.)
Applicant also  was ordered to pay restitution  of $3,786,815  and was  ordered to
forfeit at least $7,413,712, jointly and severally with his co-defendants. (GX 11 at 5,11.)
He has been paying the restitution at the rate $50 per month since 2015 and is current
on  his payments.  (Tr. 2  at 97-98.)  He filed a petition for commutation  of  his sentence,
which was still pending at the time of the hearing. (AX C.) He testified that the purpose of
his clemency petition is to obtain a review of the restitution requirement. (Tr. 2 at 96.)

conviction, except the ability to ship, transport, possess or receive firearms. His right to
vote, hold public office, serve on a jury, and be a notary public were restored. (Answer to
SOR, Exhibit A.)
Applicant  was  working  for  his  current  employer  when  the  SOR  was  issued.  His
performance  appraisal  for  June  2020  through  June  2021  rated  him  as  “exceeds  job
requirements,” the highest rating. His appraiser made the following comments at the end
of his appraisal: “[Applicant] is one of the best supply chain SME- (subject matter expert)
we have, plus equally proficient from [a] technical standpoint as well. Another great year
completed with flying colors!” (AX A.)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR
(SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d,  and  the  cross  allegation,  SOR  ¶  2.a)  with  brief  explanations.  His
admissions  and explanations  are  included  in  the findings  of  fact. After a thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since December 2017. He was granted a DOD security clearance
in  January  2019.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2002  and  a  master’s  degree  in
2005. He has never been married and has no children. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  alcohol-related  criminal  offenses,  alleged  under
Guideline G and cross-alleged under Guideline J. In about April 1998, he was charged
with  public  intoxication  in  State  A  and  fined.  In  September  1998,  he  sought  in-patient
alcohol counseling because he believed that he might be drinking too much. He ceased
this  counseling  after  about  three  days  because  he  decided  that  he  did  not  have  a
problem with alcohol after hearing about the other attendees’ issues. Applicant believes
that his record with respect to this charge of public intoxication has been expunged from
his criminal record. (Items 3-5; AE AA, BB, EE; Enclosure 3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  2000  in  State  A  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence (DUI). He spent the night in jail. As a result of this DUI, he had to complete 40
hours  of  community  service,  a  DUI  course,  and  have  an  ignition  interlock  device
installed  on  his  car.  He  received  a  two-year  deferred  sentence.  He  believes  that  his
2000  DUI  has  been  expunged  from  his  record.  As  a  result  of  this  DUI,  Applicant
reduced his drinking to about two beers at a time, once every two months.  (Items 3, 5;
AE EE; Enclosure 3)
Applicant was arrested again in July 2002 in State A and charged with DUI after
a  night  out  with  friends.  He  again  spent  the  night  in  jail.  Applicant  pleaded  guilty.  He
received  a  two-year  deferred  sentence,  had  an  ignition  interlock  device  placed  on  his
vehicle, and attended a DUI school for 12 hours. He completed all the requirements of
his  deferred  sentence.  After  this  DUI,  Applicant  reduced  his  drinking  to  no  more  than
two  or  three  beers  on  any  occasion,  only  drank  twice  per  year,  and  never  drove  a
vehicle after he consumed alcohol. (Items 3, 5, 6; AE EE; Enclosure 3)
In  approximately  2011,  Applicant  decided  that  he  wanted  to  work  for  the
government  or  a  government  contractor.  He  began  attending  Alcoholics  Anonymous
(AA) meetings in an effort to mitigate his alcohol issues and related legal problems. He
attended AA meetings from 2011 until 2016. His  attendance was  initially fairly regular,
but gradually decreased until he stopped attending in 2016. He completed all 12 steps
of  AA  at  some  point  between  2014  and  2016,  while  having  regular  contact  with  his
sponsor. As part of a plan to improve his health, he abstained from alcohol for over four
years. He resumed drinking in the summer of 2016, and consumed one to three beers
once per month until the end of 2016. From 2017 until September 2019, he drank about
one to three servings of alcohol about six times per year. (Items 3-5; AE G; Enclosure 3)
In October 2019, Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with Aggravated
DUI after a night out with friends. His blood alcohol content was measured at either .16
or .18, after he had been arrested and taken to jail. Applicant pleaded nolo contendere
to  a  lesser  charge  of  non-aggravated  DUI,  for  which  he  received  a  deferred  one-year
sentence  with  unsupervised  probation,  50  hours  of  community  service,  and  about
$1,700  in  fines.  He  was  also  ordered  to  install  an  ignition  interlock  system  on  his
vehicle. Applicant completed all of his post-sentencing requirements and paid all of his
fines. He completed a 24-hour alcohol and drug abuse course, a victim input panel, and
a  six-week  substance  abuse  group  through  State  A.  (Items  3,  4,  5,  7;  AE  EE,  DD;
Enclosure 3)
Applicant resumed  attending  AA  meetings again in October 2019,  after his 2019
DUI arrest.  He  had   a   “small” glass of champagne  on   December   31, 2019, New   Years’
Eve.  In  connection  with  his resumed  AA  participation, he  has again completed  the  12-
step  program  and  has received  his one, three, six, and  nine-month  sobriety  chips.  After
moving  to  Country  A  for his  job,  he  continued  attending  AA  meetings two  to  three  times
per  week  online   and   obtained   a   new   AA   sponsor,   who   is  a   citizen   and   resident   of
Country A. (Items 3, 5; AE G,  H,  EE; Enclosure 3)
In  a  written  statement  attached  to  his  October  2021  SOR  response  Applicant
committed  to  never  drinking  again.  He  claimed  that  no  one  had  ever  advised  him  or
recommended  to  him  that  he  should  fully  and  permanently  abstain  from  alcohol.
(Enclosure 3)
Applicant  submitted a Drug and  Alcohol Assessment, dated February 16,  2022,
from  an  individual  who  is  a  licensed  social  worker  and  licensed  chemical  dependency
counselor  III  (Clinical  Evaluator).  The  Clinical  Evaluator  reviewed  the  results  of
Applicant’s  drug  abuse  screening  test,  a  Michigan  alcohol  screening  test,  and  a
proprietary  mental  health  screening.  The  Clinical  Evaluator  opined  that,  despite
Applicant’s written  screenings providing  evidence  of  problem  alcohol use, “the  drinking
habits” Applicant “acknowledges are insignificant enough for alcohol abuse disorder ….”
(AE EE, FF)
Applicant  submitted  letters  from  friends,  acquaintances,  co-workers,  and  fellow
AA  participants  praising  him  for  his  reliability,  honesty,  responsibility,  trustworthiness,
dependability,  integrity,  and  charitable  work.  Some  of  the  authors  also  noted  his
commitment  to  sobriety  and  his  participation  in  AA.  He  submitted  documentation  of
numerous  cash  awards  his  employer  granted  him  in  2018,  2019,  and  2020.  (AE  A-J,
GG, HH)
Through  his  Personal  Representative,  Applicant  requested  that  I  consider
granting  him  a  conditional  clearance.  He  provided  several  suggestions  “to  ensure
monitoring and enforcement of the conditions.” (Applicant’s response to FORM)

"Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about July 2021. His current employer hired him when it was
awarded the government contract of his previous employer for whom he worked since
March  2018.  There  has  been  no  interruption  in  his  employment  with  a  defense
contractor since March 2018. He was granted an interim security clearance in 2018. He
has an associate’s degree. He has never been married and has no children. (Transcript
(Tr.) at 30-34; GE 1, 2, 19)
Applicant has a significant history of criminal offenses, including several alcohol-
related offenses. In about January 2008, he was charged with driving with a suspended
driver’s license after being pulled over for speeding. His driver’s license was suspended
because  he  had  let  his  insurance  coverage  lapse.  In  about  August  2008,  he  failed  to
appear  for  his  court  date  for  driving  on  a  suspended  license  and  was  charged  with
failure  to  appear.  In  September  2009,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  driving  on  a  suspended
license, speeding, and failure to appear and was  placed on probation before judgment
(PBJ).  He  completed about  three  to  six months  of  probation  successfully  and  paid  his
required  fines  and  court fees.  (Tr. at  34-36, Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;  GE  1,  2,  4,
19)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  December  2009  in  State  A  and  charged  with  driving
under  the  influence  (DUI),  after  driving  home  from  a  bar  despite  knowing  he  was
intoxicated. He had a .13 blood alcohol content (BAC) at the time of his arrest. He spent
the night in jail. As it was Applicant’s first DUI, these charges against him were dropped.
(Tr. at 36-37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 19)
About two months later, in February 2010, Applicant was arrested in State A and
charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). He had been drinking at a bar and decided
to drive home despite knowing that he was intoxicated. He had a .19 BAC at the time of
his arrest. He spent one or two nights in jail. In October 2010, he pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to 60 days in jail, all suspended. His driver’s license  was suspended  for six
months, and he had to  pay fines and complete 24 hours of  community service.  (Tr. at
37-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5, 19)
Applicant had enlisted in  the  U.S. Navy  in about February  2010. As a  result of his
February  2010  DWI, Applicant’s accession  to  the  Navy  was declined.1  (Tr. 31, 59;  GE  2,
3, 19)
In  May 2010, Applicant  was  charged with  driving  with  a  suspended license.  His
license  had  been  administratively  suspended  as  a  result  of  his  February  2010  DWI
charge.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  received  PBJ  as  a  result  of  this  charge.  (Tr.  at  41-43;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 5, 6, 19)
In November 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI and Failure to
Stop After Accident Involving Damage to Attended Vehicle/Property. Prior to his arrest,
Applicant  had been drinking alone at  home for three  to four hours and had  consumed
about  two  bottles  of  wine.  He  decided  to  drive  despite  knowing  he  was  impaired
because he had to go to work. On his way to work, he collided with a pick-up truck, left
the  scene  of  the  accident,  and  drove  the  additional  two  to  three  miles  to  work  at  a
restaurant where he was employed  as a bartender. While investigating the hit and run
involving  the  aforementioned  pick-up  truck,  the  police  determined  that  Applicant  was
responsible and arrested him at work. Applicant had a .21 BAC when he was arrested.
He pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced to 365 days in jail with all but 45
days  suspended,  probation  for  three  years,  and  two  months  of  alcohol  classes.  He
claimed  that  he  completed  all  the  requirements  of  his  sentence.  In  his  January  2018
subject interview (SI), he did not tell his investigator about the hit and run aspect of his
arrest.  He  only  discussed  a  version  of  events  involving  the  DWI  that  did  not  include
colliding with another vehicle. (Tr. at 43-49; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 7, 8,
19, 20)
Applicant  attended  court-ordered alcohol classes from  February 2013  until April
2013.  Prior  to  attending  these  court-ordered  classes,  he  voluntarily  began  attending
some  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings.  He  attended  AA  meetings  from  January
2013 until about July 2013. He completed a couple of the AA steps but did not have a
sponsor. (Tr. 57-58; GE 19)
In late June 2017, Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with intoxicated
endangerment. Applicant was  walking back to  the location where he  was  staying after
drinking  at  a  bar  for  seven  or  eight  hours.  A  bouncer  at  the  bar  where  Applicant  had
been drinking alerted the police that Applicant had too much to drink, so police  began
following him. Applicant tried to steal a bike that was locked to a bench and pushed it
over when he realized he could not take it. Police lost him for a couple of minutes, but
then relocated him when they saw him vomiting in a bush. When he noticed police were
following him, Applicant ran to evade them, but they apprehended him. Applicant spent
the  night  in  jail.  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  intoxicated  endangerment  in  August  2017.

1  Any  adverse  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  such  as  Applicant’s  issues  with  joining  the  Navy,
cannot  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be  considered  when  assessing  Applicant’s
rehabilitation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and for the whole-person analysis.
In November 2017, Applicant was charged with Failure to Control Vehicle Speed
on  a  Highway  to  Avoid  Collision  after  he  was  involved  in  a  car  accident.  In  January
2018,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  this  charge  and  prepaid  a  fine.  The  vehicle  that  he  was
driving was  totaled as a  result of  this accident.  (Tr. 49-50,  52; Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 10)
In  March  2018,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driver  Using  Hands  to  Use  Hand-
Held  Telephone  while  Motor  Vehicle  was  in  Motion.  This  charge  resulted  from  his
involvement in an accident because he was looking at his mobile phone and rear-ended
another vehicle.  He pleaded  guilty and paid a fine.  (Tr.  49-52;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 11)
In  March  2020,  Applicant  was  cited  for speeding  when  he  was  caught  traveling
64  mph  in  a  55  mph  zone.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  paid  a  fine.  (Tr.  52-53;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 12)
Sometime in 2021, Applicant was cited for speeding after a speed camera caught
him exceeding the speed limit. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine online. (Tr. 53-54)
Applicant  admitted   that  his  drinking   has   caused   problems  with   his  family,  his
finances, and  his health.  Applicant has a  paternal history  of   kidney  disease. Beginning
when  he  was about  25  years  old  in 2012,  Applicant showed  symptoms of  chronic  kidney
disease.   As  early   as  January   2018,  he   recognized   that  his  alcohol  consumption   had
exacerbated  his kidney  disease.  However, he  continued  to  consume  alcohol to  excess,
acknowledging  that,  at  that time, he  was consuming  four to  five  drinks once  or twice per
month and  drinking to the point of intoxication about once every two months.  (Tr. 29, 55-
56; GE 2, 3, 19; AE B, C)
As a result of a referral by the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication
Facility  (DOD  CAF),  in  February  2021,  with  a  follow-up  in  June  2021,  Applicant
underwent a psychological evaluation by a licensed clinical psychologist (Psychologist).
The Psychologist was contracted by the DOD CAF. In order to make her psychological
evaluation,  the  Psychologist  reviewed  background  information  submitted  by  the  DOD
CAF,  the  results  of  a  clinical  interview,  testing  observations,  and  the  results  of  the
Personality Assessment Inventory. (Tr. 59; GE 2, 3)
Based  upon  these  measuring  tools,  the  Psychologist  diagnosed  Applicant  with
alcohol  use  disorder  (moderate-severe).  She  found  the  risk  of  future  alcohol-related
incidents to be moderate with a guarded prognosis. She noted her concern that, despite
all  of  the  adverse  effects  alcohol  has  had  on  him,  Applicant  continued  to  consume  it
without  undergoing  any  alcohol-related  treatment.  She  also  noted  that,  in  about  2019,
Applicant’s doctor recommended that he abstain from alcohol entirely. (Tr. 59; GE 2, 3)
Applicant claimed that, in the Fall of 2021, he turned over a new leaf and stopped
drinking. This decision was spurred partly by knowing that his kidneys were “basically all
the  way  gone,”  and  a  May  2021  medical  emergency  that  put  him  in  the  hospital  after
“throwing up 10 pints of blood” and nearly dying. He also credits his decision to change
his  lifestyle  on  a  subsequent  medical  issue  in  about  July  2021  when  his  right  lung
collapsed. He testified that he has not had a drink since Fall 2021, and that he plans to
continue to abstain from alcohol entirely. (Tr. 29, 55-56; GE 2, 3, 19; AE B, C)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  32  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately
23,400.  Many  of  these  delinquent  debts  are  medical  debts  resulting  from  Applicant’s
aforementioned  chronic  kidney  issues.  However,  Applicant  also  has  other  debts,  such
as a delinquent credit-card debt, a delinquent debt to State A, a delinquent student-loan
debt, and a delinquent telecommunications debt. Applicant attributed his financial issues
to  his  youth,  his  disorganization,  and  a  lack  of  income.  He  also  attributed  them  to  his
past and ongoing health conditions. He has been covered by health insurance through
his employer as of March 2018 at the latest. (TR. 63-83, 110-121; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 13-19; AE A-D)
The  $1,916  judgment  entered  in  2011  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  4.a  has  not  been
resolved. Applicant claimed that he has paid this debt through garnishments, however,
he did not provide any documentation establishing it was paid. He testified that he may
have had documentation showing the debt was paid at one time, but he no longer does.
(Tr. 63-65; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 13)
The $848 medical judgment entered in 2013 alleged in SOR ¶ 4.b has not been
resolved. Applicant believes that he paid this  debt because he has not heard from the
creditor  or  any  collection  agencies  about  the  debt.  However,  he  did  not  provide  any
documentation  establishing  that  it  was  paid.  (Tr.  65-68;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;
GE 14, 19)
The $2,461 judgment entered in 2017 in favor of State A alleged in ¶ 4.c has not
been  resolved.  Applicant  does  not  know  the  nature  of  this  debt.  He  presented  no
evidence  that  he  has  made  a  payment,  disputed  this  debt,  offered  or  negotiated  a
payment  agreement,  or  taken  any  significant  actions  to  resolve  this  debt.  (Tr.  68-70;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 16; AE C)
The $9,231 educational loan judgment entered in 2018 alleged in ¶ 4.d has not
been resolved. Applicant presented no evidence that he has made a payment, disputed
this debt, offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to
resolve this debt. (Tr. 70-71; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 15)
The  $119  telecommunications  debt  alleged  in  ¶  4.i  has  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  testified  that  he  paid  this  debt  sometime  in  2019  but  did  not  provide  any
documentation  establishing  it  was  paid.  The  debt  appears  on  Applicant’s  2018  credit
report but not  on  his 2021  credit  report.  (Tr. 76; Applicant’s  response  to  SOR; GE  17,

The  remainder  of  Applicant’s  delinquent  debts  listed  in  the  SOR  are  medical
debts  (¶¶  4.e  through  4.h,  ¶¶  4.j  through  4.aa,  and  ¶¶  4.cc  through  4.gg).  Applicant
initially testified that he has paid only the debts listed in ¶¶ 4.e, 4.f, 4.h, 4.n, and 4.p. He
provided  documentation  establishing  that  the  debts  listed  in  ¶¶  4.e,  4.h,  and  4.p  were
paid in March and April 2022. The debts in ¶¶ 4.e, 4.h, and 4.p have been resolved. (Tr.
76-83; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 17-19; AE A, B)
Applicant  and  his mother  also testified  that they  believe  that most of  the  medical
debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶  4  have  been  paid.  Applicant  claimed  that he  could  not  match  up
his payment receipts  with  the  debts  listed  in  the  SOR because  creditors  combined  the
debts  into   one   statement.   He  was  unable   to   identify   which  documents  he   provided
corroborated  the  payments  he  alleged  he  made  on  the  remaining  SOR debts.  Many  of
Applicant’s  documents   relate   to   medical  services  that  were  provided   to   him   in   March
2021  and  later.  The  SOR debts listed  in  ¶¶  4.j through  4.aa  and  4.cc through  4.gg  are
all  contained  in  the  April 2018  credit report,  so  those  debts were incurred  prior to  March
2021.  As evidenced  by  information  in the  July  2021  credit report, the  SOR debts listed
in ¶¶  4.f  and  4.g  were also incurred  prior to  March 2021.  Any  of  Applicant’s documents
purporting   to   show   payments  for  medical  services  provided   to   him   after  March   2021
cannot  show   payments  for  the   debts  listed   in   ¶¶  4.f,   4.g,   4.j  through   4.o,  4.q   through
4.aa,  and  4.cc through  4.gg.  (Tr. 76-83,108-121; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  17-
19; AE A-D)
Applicant’s  documents  show  that  he  has  made  some  payments  on  medical
debts,  but  he  has  failed  to  show  that  he  has  made  payments  on  the  aforementioned
SOR  debts.  Applicant  largely  began  his  efforts  to  pay  these  medical  debts  at  the
beginning  of  2022.  Most  of  the funds  that  he  used  to  pay  these  debts  were  gifts  from
friends and family, often raised through his mother’s fundraising efforts in February and
March  2022.  As  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  corroborating  his  alleged
payments, the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 4.f, 4.g, 4.j through 4.aa and 4.cc through 4.gg are
unresolved. (Tr. 76-83,108-121; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 17-19; AE A-D)
Applicant testified that, at some time between 2005 and 2008, his aunt gave her
permission to add her name to his loan application from Bank A for a student loan. He
testified that  his aunt  told  him  she  would  be responsible for paying  back  this debt.  He
applied for this loan in his name and added his aunt as a co-signor. The debt became
delinquent by 2017 and Bank A filed a lawsuit against Applicant and his aunt to recover
the  balance. Applicant’s aunt  hired  an  attorney  and  defended  herself against Bank  A’s
lawsuit, claiming that Applicant had forged her signature to the loan application without
her permission. Bank A dismissed  Applicant’s aunt from  the  lawsuit with  prejudice,  but
obtained a judgment against Applicant as described in SOR ¶ 4.d.  (Tr. 70-76, 99-100;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 15, 17, 22, 23)
Applicant  claimed  that  his  aunt  changed  her  mind  about  their  agreement  with
respect to this loan years after he applied for it because she needed money.  Applicant
has  no  documentation  evidencing  his  aunt’s  consent  to  sign  her  name  to  loan
applications, but claimed that his mother is aware of the arrangement. Applicant’s aunt
passed away in late 2018. (Tr. 70-76, 99-100; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 15, 17,
22, 23)
In  order  to  assist  him  with  his  debts  and  investments,  Applicant  consulted  a
financial advisor beginning in February 2021 that his mother recommended. He did not
provide  evidence  as  to  what  his  financial  advisor  has  done  to  assist  him  with  his
finances. (Tr. 92-94)
As  a  result  of  his  chronic  kidney  disease,  Applicant  is  in  need  of  a  kidney
transplant  and  is  on  a  kidney  donor  list.  However,  he  claimed  that  in  order  to  be
approved for a transplant, he has to improve his credit-to-debt ratio. Applicant plans to
continue to pay down his delinquent debts in order to improve this ratio.  He also plans
to  continue  his  education  and  is  eight  to  ten  classes  shy  of  earning  his  bachelor’s
degree.  He  provided  a  transcript  from  his  school  showing  that  he  has  earned  good
grades. (Tr. 32-33, 80, 118-119; AE A-D)

"Applicant  admitted  all  four  allegations  under  Guideline  G  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d)
without  comment.  He  did  not  answer  the  cross-allegation  under  Guideline  J  (SOR  ¶
2.a),  but  since  it  is  a  cross-allegation  I  deem  it  admitted.  Applicant’s  SOR  admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is 33 years old.  He graduated from high  school in 2006 and attended
four years of apprentice school (2007-2011) and some community college. (Item 5) He
and his wife have been married since 2007. They have three sons, ages 12, 9, and 8.
(Item 5) Applicant has worked for a large defense contractor at a naval shipyard since
2006. (Item 5) He has held a clearance for most of his career. (FORM Response)
On  his  SCA,  Applicant  reported  a  May  2019  DWI  arrest  and  disclosed  that  he
had  received  a  “one-year  suspension”  as  a  result.  (Item  5)  He  discussed  the  offense
and  the  resulting  requirements  in  a  July  2020  background  interview,  the  summary  of
which he authenticated as accurate in a May 2021 interrogatory response. (Item 6)
Applicant  discussed  the  circumstances  of  his  DWI  arrest  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  in  his
background interview.  In May 2019, he had been at a local bar and consumed four or
five  mixed  drinks  over  a  three- or  four-hour  period.  He  was  pulled  over  while  driving
home. The officer smelled alcohol on his breath and requested that Applicant submit to
a breathalyzer, which he refused. Applicant was arrested and detained overnight. (Item
6 at 3; Item 7)
Applicant  acknowledged  during  his  interview  that  he  had  been  intoxicated.  He
went  to  court,  retained  counsel,  and  pleaded  guilty  to  DWI  in  September  2019.  His
license  was  restricted  for  one  year,  he  was  placed  on  one  year  of  unsupervised
probation,  and  he  was  required  to  participate  in  alcohol  safety  classes.  He  was  also
fined. He was also required to have an ignition interlock device placed on his car and to
report  monthly  so  his  compliance  could  be  tested.  (Item  6  at  3-4)  Applicant  was  also
ordered to complete 10 weeks of alcohol education classes between October 2019 and
December 2019. (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Between December 2019 and October 2020, Applicant incurred four violations of
his  ignition  interlock  device.  As  a  result,  he  was  considered  non-compliant  with  his
alcohol  education  program  on  two  occasions,  in  July  2020  and  August  2020.  The
ignition  interlock  program  was  extended  for  six  months  and  he  was  ordered  to  attend
substance abuse treatment. (Item 6 at 4; Items 10-12) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
After  his  first  ignition  interlock  violation  in  December  2019,  Applicant  was
required to participate in an alcohol assessment. (Item 6 at 8-9). In February 2020, his
assessor concluded that he did not meet criteria for alcohol treatment. (Item 9)
Following his additional ignition interlock violations, Applicant was re-assessed in
December  2020.  He  indicated  to  the  assessor  that  “his  time  was  extended  for  an
additional six months” (Item 12  at 2), which I interpret  as an  extension  of  his probation
to  March  2021  (beyond  his  initial  one-year  term,  from  September  2019  to  September
2020). When he was assessed, he met 3 of the 11 criteria for alcohol use disorder, mild
(unsuccessful  efforts  to  cut  down  or  control  alcohol  use;  recurrent  alcohol  use  in
physically hazardous situations; and tolerance as defined by need for marked increased
amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect). (Item 12 at 3-4)
Applicant was also re-enrolled in the alcohol safety program. He met the criteria
for an additional ten weeks of treatment and alcohol awareness education. (Item 12 at
3-4)  (SOR  ¶  1.d)  He  completed  that  treatment  program  in  March  2021,  as  required,
through an on-line meeting platform. (Item 6 at 37-38; Item 8, Item 12 at 9)
Applicant  discussed  his  alcohol  history  in  his  background  interview.  He  began
drinking at about age 18, at least sporadically. From age 21 until May 2019, the time of
his DWI, he consumed four to seven drinks of liquor or beer about three or four times a
week. Since his DWI, his drinking had decreased to three or four  drinks about once or
twice  a  week  at  the  time  of  his  interview  in  July  2020.  (Item  6  at  4)  As  of  May  2021,
Applicant reported that he no longer consumed alcoholic beverages and does not intend
to do so in the future. (Item 6 at 34)
In his December 2021 FORM Response, Applicant added little new information.
He noted that he understood DOD’s concerns. He asked that his 15-year career with his
employer be considered, including with a clearance, and said the events of the last two
years are not who he has been in the past or is today. (FORM Response)

"Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about June 2020. He has a 10% service-connected disability
rating for his honorable service in the U.S. military from April 2014 to December 2014.
He served in the National Guard until he was discharged with a general discharge under
honorable  conditions  in  2018.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  has  never married and
he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 16, 20-21; GE 1, 2; AE 2)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  offenses,  primarily  alcohol  related.  He  was
arrested in 2015 and charged  with assault. Alcohol was not a factor in this charge. He
explained  that  he  had  an  argument  with  his  roommate  and  pushed  him.  His  attorney
was  apparently  able  to  negotiate  a  plea  bargain  to  a  less  serious  offense.  Applicant
claims it was littering. (Tr. at 23-26; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  September  2016  and  charged  with  driving  while
intoxicated  (DWI).  The  police  report  of  the  incident  shows  that  Applicant  took  a
breathalyzer  test  that  registered  .19%  blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC),  more  than
double  the  legal  limit.  He  pleaded  guilty  in  December  2016  and  was  sentenced  to
probation for two years. (Tr. at 33-36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5)
Applicant broke both of his wrists in a motorcycle accident in about 2017 after he
had been drinking. He was  able to  walk away from  the accident and  was  taken to the
hospital by a passing truck driver. There was no police involvement, and he was never
charged. (Tr. at 17-18, 22-23, 36-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant was drunk in February 2020 and had an argument with a friend at the
friend’s  house.  The  friend  told  Applicant  to  leave.  After  leaving,  Applicant  “keyed”  the
friend’s car and the friend’s girlfriend’s car. Applicant testified that he had about three to
four beers over a period of a couple hours and that he felt “buzzed,” but not intoxicated.
He did not feel that alcohol was a factor in his conduct because he “was super mad, and
[he]  would  have  done  it  even  if  [he]  was  sober.”  His  testimony  is  inconsistent  with  his
statement to a background investigator in August 2020 that he was super drunk during
the incident. (Tr. at 38-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
An arrest warrant was issued, and Applicant was charged with two felony counts
of  property  damage.  Pursuant  to  a  plea  bargain,  in  about  February  2022,  he  pleaded
guilty  to  two  misdemeanor  counts  of  property  damage.  He  was  required  to  make
restitution of $1,625 and $1,490 to the two victims, and he was sentenced to probation
for one year. Terms of the probation included no contact with the victims and payment
of court costs. (Tr. at 15, 38-41; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 6, 7; AE 1)
Applicant testified that he has not had any alcohol since the incident in February
2020.  He  admitted  that  he  told  a  background  investigator  in  August  2020  that  he
continued to regularly drink until shortly before the interview. He testified that he lied to
the  investigator when he  told  the  investigator that he  had been  drinking when  actually
he  had  not.  He  did  not  like  his  team  at  work,  and  he  thought  if  he  did  not  receive  a
clearance he would be transferred to another team. (Tr.at 43-46; GE 2)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
June  2020.  He failed  to  report any  of  his criminal arrests  or  charges  under any  of  the
pertinent questions. (Tr. at 29-30; GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2020. When
asked if he had been arrested within the last seven years, if he had ever been charged
with a felony, and if he had ever been charged with a drug or alcohol-related offense, he
answered  “no”  to  each  question.  He  discussed  his  2016  DWI  after  being  specifically
confronted with it. He stated that he did not report the DWI on the SF 86 and discuss it
with the investigator because he did not know if it would show up on a records check.
Applicant  then  also  discussed  his  2015  and  2020  offenses.  He  stated  that  he  did  not
report  the  2020  arrest  and  charges  on  the  SF  86  because  he  thought  if  his  current
employer knew about the charges, he would not have been hired. (Tr. at 30-32; GE 1,
2)
Applicant  denied   intentionally   providing   false   information   on   the   SF  86.  In   his
response   to   the   SOR,   he   wrote   that  he   “did   not  fully   understand   what  charge   meant,”
and  that  he  thought that since  he  had  a  lawyer and  the  charges were reduced, he  was
not being  charged  at the  time. When  asked  at hearing  why  he  did not report  that he  had
been  arrested, he  testified: “I believe  negligence  of the  law. I thought - - I felt like  I  was
just  being  like  in  a  hold, and  I hadn’t gotten  arrested  yet,  like  until my  case  got  to  trial.”
He testified  that he  thought the  2016  DWI  charge  had  been  reduced  to  littering.  Other
than  Applicant’s  testimony, there  is no  evidence  that the  DWI  charge  had  been  reduced
to   littering.  Applicant  could  not  explain   why   he   did   not  report  a   conviction   for  littering.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.b, with explanations. He admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.c in part and denied it in

the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c. His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 33-year-old software developer employed by a defense contractor
since February 2022. He has worked intermittently for various federal contractors since
March 2015 and worked for various non-federal employers in information-technology jobs
since about August 2011. He attended college from August 2007 to May 2013 and from
January to May 2014, but he has not received a degree. He has never married. He has a
four-year-old daughter. He received a DOD security clearance in May 2011.
In  November  2012,  Applicant  was  convicted  in  absentia  of  reckless  driving  by
speeding in excess of 80 miles per hour in a 45 miles-per-hour zone. He was fined $200
plus court costs. (GX 3.)
In November 2015, Applicant was charged with petit larceny  from a department
store. A cashier in the store, who was a friend of Applicant, did not ring up everything in
his shopping cart. Applicant knew that his friend was not ringing up all his purchases. He
was stopped by a store employee, arrested by the police, and charged with petit larceny.
(GX 2 at 7.) In November 2017, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 90 days in jail,
with 88 days suspended, and placed on probation for two years. (GX 4.)
In March 2016, Applicant was charged with  driving while intoxicated (DWI), first
offense. He pleaded not guilty, was convicted, was sentenced to six months in jail, with
all but five days suspended, and fined $250. He was placed on unsupervised probation
for two years and his driver’s license was restricted. In October 2017, he was convicted
of violating probation, because he failed to provide documentation that he had completed
an alcohol-education class. (GX 5.) As of the date of the hearing, his driver’s license had
not yet been reinstated. (Tr. 25-26.)
In  June  2016,  Applicant  hired  a  credit-repair  company  that  provided  him  with  a
“credit privacy number” (CPN) to use  in lieu of a Social Security number for purchasing
items on credit. He used the CPN to purchase a car with no money down.  Three days
later,  the  car  dealership  told  him  to  return  the  car  because  the  CPN  he  used  for  the
purchase belonged to another person. He was charged with identity theft with intent to
defraud and two counts of forgery of  public records, both felonies. In August 2017, he
was convicted of obtaining money by false pretenses and sentenced to two years in jail,
suspended for two years. The charge of forgery of public records was disposed of by nolle
prosequi. (GX 6.)
In January 2017, Applicant was barred from entry onto a military installation when
authorities  discovered  that  his  motor  vehicle  was  improperly  registered  and  he  had
falsified  information  to  register  it.  He  had  wrecked  his  vehicle  in  an  accident,  and  he
removed the registration sticker from the wrecked vehicle and put it on a new vehicle. He
used  the  unauthorized  registration  sticker  to  obtain  a  parking  permit  on  the  military
installation. The illegal transfer of the sticker was discovered when he was given a ticket
for parking in a commuter van space. The parking ticket was dismissed. (AX A.) However,
he  was  terminated  from  his  federal  employment  because  the  bar  to  entry  onto  the
installation  made  him  unable  to  perform  work.  (GX  7;  Tr.  34-36.)  He  testified  that  the
debarment from the installation was eventually lifted. (Tr. 36-37.)
In  January  2020,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  another  job  with  a  defense
contractor  for  falsifying  records,  misrepresenting  facts,  and  withholding  information  in
order  to  obtain  employment.  After  he  had  failed  the  test  for  certification  credentials
allowing  access  to  a  sensitive  computer  network,  he  went  online  and  created  false
credentials. He testified that he created the false credentials because he needed the job.

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  61  years  old.  He  is  a  college  graduate.  He  is  twice  divorced  and
married to his current wife since 2002. He has one adult biological child and two adult
stepdaughters.  He  has  five  grandchildren.  The  grandchildren  live  close  to  him and  his
wife, and they provide support and care for them as needed. They see the grandchildren
several times a week. Applicant is a father figure as there are no other males in the family.
(Tr. 21-25, 79-80)
In January 2019, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUI). The breathalyzer registered .10%. He cooperated with police and was remorseful
for his conduct. Applicant was on a business trip and was out to dinner with his boss. He
admitted he had more drinks than he should have had. He has diabetes and did not take
his insulin that day. He testified that he did not feel impaired, but he used poor judgment
in driving. He said he should have known better. He preaches to his children never to
drink and drive and felt like a hypocrite. Prior to the incident, he occasionally had alcoholic
drinks on a special occasion such as his birthday His last drink was on his last birthday in
July. Due to his diabetes he rarely consumes alcohol because of its negative impact. He
credibly testified this was a one-time isolated incident. He acknowledged it was a terrible
mistake. (Tr. 73-77, 83, 137-145)
The charge was reduced to reckless driving. Applicant completed a MADD victim
impact panel as part of his sentence and paid a fine. The charge was expunged from his
record in September 2019. (AE N, O, P, Q, R)
In  September  2018,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  felony  domestic
battery by strangulation. SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that he grabbed his stepdaughter (SD) by the
neck after she kicked and attempted to strike him.
Applicant  testified  that  he  had  loaned  SD  money  and  she  came  to  his  house
uninvited. She was agitated and yelling at him. He asked her to pay the money she owed
him  that  was  due  that  day.  She  refused  and  yelled  profanity  at  him.  According  to
Applicant, she then kneed him in the groin and punched him several times in the chest,
neck  and  throat  area.  They  engaged  in  a  mutual  altercation,  shoving  each  other.  She
hooked her finger in his mouth and her finger got cut, likely from his teeth biting her. She
took a bottle that was accessible and hit him on the head. She then called the police, who
responded about an hour later, and Applicant was arrested and taken to jail. (Tr. 35-47;
129-137, 157-159.)
The police report showed that SD made a sworn statement saying she had a verbal
altercation  with  Applicant  and  then  he  attacked  her  by  pushing  her,  taking  hold  of  her
throat, held her against a doorway, and he placed her finger in his mouth and bit it. (AE
E)
SD provided a written statement in support of Applicant regarding the incident (and
also a 2013 incident). She stated that she provoked the argument and “flew off the handle”
and the name calling began. (AE F) She stated:
I  was  the   one   who   provoked   the   incident  by   first  slapping   him   and   then
kicking  him  in the  groin. He was defending  himself  and  I persisted  which  led
to  the  incident where we  both  grabbed  one  another. I grabbed  him  and  he
grabbed   me.  As  we   were  pushing   each   other  away   we   both   ended   up
grabbing  each  other by  the  throat.  I tried  to  hook him  in  the  mouth  where
my   finger  became   cut.   I   also   hit  him   in  the   back  of  the   head   with   a
vase/bottle. (AE F)
SD  further  stated  that  it  was  a  horrible  and  tragic  event  that  led  to  Applicant’s
arrest. She acted immaturely and deeply regrets the incident. She discussed the incident
with the State attorney and the charges were dropped against Applicant. She described
Applicant as a kind and loving man toward his children and grandchildren. She stated this
was an isolated incident and since the altercation she and her family have developed a
non-adversarial communication system to discuss issues. She and her stepfather are on
good terms and are embarrassed and ashamed about their past behavior. They love and
support each other. After the incident they apologized to each other. (AE F)
SD  testified  at  the  hearing.  She  refused  to  answer  questions  that  raised  issues
about  her  veracity  based  on  the  sworn  statement  she  provided  to  police,  her  written
statement, and her testimony. I did not find her credible. (Tr. 191)
SD testified that Applicant has been a father figure to her for the past 20 years.
She has been diagnosed with depression and said “I basically am suicidal.” (Tr. 172) She
stated that she was responsible for starting the 2018 incident, it was her fault, and it was
not fair to him. She did not believe he bit her finger on purpose. She had the charges
dropped because it was not fair to Applicant when she was the one who was wrong. She
no longer needs Applicant’s help financially. (Tr. 172-212)
Applicant  admitted  it  was  an  emotional  incident.  He  took  responsibility  for  his
conduct.  In  October  2018,  the  State  Attorney  declined  to  prosecute  the  case  after
considering SD’s statement, statements of witnesses, and the police report. The charges
were dropped. (Tr. 35-47; AE F)
In December 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault
with a deadly weapon. It was alleged he was engaged in a physical fight with his son-in-
law  (SD’s  husband)  after  the  son-in-law  attempted  to  strike  Applicant.  The  son-in-law
alleged Applicant wielded a knife during the altercation. (GE 3, 4, 5; AE G)
Applicant testified that SD was married to S at the time of the incident. SD has two
children from another marriage. On the birth certificate of her third child, S is listed as the
father, but he is not the biological father. This child was three years old at the time of the
2013 incident. SD called Applicant because she was afraid of S. He was attacking her
and  she  was  concerned  for  the  safety  of  the  children.  Applicant  described  S  as
unpredictable due to his use of  illegal drugs, including methamphetamine and alcohol.
Applicant drove to SD and S’s house. He did not call the police because he said the police
have never done anything in the past when SD called. He admitted he did not think to call
the police, but was acting on instinct. When he arrived at the house, Applicant observed
S and SD tussling. He asked S what was the matter with him. Then S took a swing at him
and the two began to fight. There is conflicting testimony and in written statements, SD
said she was being attacked by S and was on the ground when Applicant arrived. At some
point, Applicant and S stopped fighting, and S called the police. Applicant stated that S
got the worst of it with a cut on his face and mouth. Applicant stated he was defending
himself. He then went outside and waited for the police to arrive. Applicant was arrested
and put in jail. (Tr. 47-60 118-126, 160-163; AE G)
S claimed that Applicant arrived at the house and charged him unprovoked, threw
him against the wall, and held a pocket knife to his throat. Applicant denied a knife was
involved and none was retrieved as evidence. He said he does not own a pocket knife. In
January  2014,  the  State  Attorney  determined  he  would  not  file  an  information  on  the
charges. (Tr. 47-60; AE H)
SD  testified  that  she  was  being  attacked  by  S  and  someone  called  the  police.
Applicant arrived and pulled S off of her and started to defend her. She did not see a knife
during  the  altercation.  She  stated  that  S  had  a  drug  problem  and  was  in  and  out  of
recovery.  He  was  abusive  and has been in other relationships where  he  was  abusive.
She had two protective injunctions against him. (Tr. 178-186)
Applicant admitted  he  could have  done  something  to  deescalate  the  situation  by
removing  SD  from  the  house  and  calling  the  police. Through  counseling,  he  is more aware
of  approaching  a  volatile situation  with  the  premise  of doing  the  right thing.  S  provided  a
statement in  his motion  to  dissolve  an injunction  for protection  dated  January  29, 2014.
His statement said  that  the  incident was a  misunderstanding  with  his “soon  to  be  ex-wife.”
He said he  did not want the  incident to  impact  Applicant’s job  because  he pays all  of  the
bills and  he  didn’t  want  the  rest  of  the family  to  suffer. He stated  he was sorry  and  never
intended  to  waste  anyone’s time.  A  copy  of  a  mug  shot  and  booking  record for a  later  May
2019   arrest  of   S   for  a  domestic  violence   violation;  controlled   substance   –   possession
without a  prescription;  and  possession  of drug  paraphernalia  was provided, presumably
to  show  S’s character, but also to  show  the  pose  he  struck for the  photo.  (Tr. 81-84, 126-
128; AE H, BB)
In 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery-domestic violence. The
SOR  alleged  he  struck  his  wife  after  she  struck  him  during  an  argument.  Although
Applicant admitted the allegation in his SOR answer, at his hearing, he had no recollection
of  the  incident.  In  his  2010  and  2011  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  he
disclosed his wife hit him and he hit her back. She called the police. The charges were
dropped  by his wife  and  the  court. He  attended  a  battered  women’s course at  a family
counseling center one night a week for about two months. This was not court ordered. At
his hearing, he denied he hit his wife. (Tr. 62-63, 106; GE 6, AE I)
In about May 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault
with a weapon. He was arrested after a motorist described a vehicle matching Applicant’s
vehicle and identified Applicant in a police line-up as the person who pointed the firearm
at him from another vehicle. Applicant believes he was falsely identified. Applicant denied
he  owned  a firearm  and  none  was  found  in his vehicle  or retrieved  from his house  as
evidence. He denied that he was involved in this altercation. Applicant and his wife were
moving that day and were together. He testified that he had lent his vehicle to his brother-
in-law, who is similar in stature. He told this to his lawyer. His brother-in-law was never
questioned. Applicant explained that his lawyer told him that he had a 50-50 chance of
winning or losing the case, it would be expensive, and since he had a security clearance
to  not  take  any  chances  and  plead  no  contest,  which  he  did.  The  charge  was  nolle
prosequi, and he participated in a pretrial diversion program. He was required to complete
50 hours of community service. The charge was dismissed in 2004. (Tr. 63-71, 96-106,
163; GE 4, 6; AE J)
In  1997,  Applicant  was  charged  with  domestic  battery.  He  could  not  recall  the
incident.  The  offense  is  not  listed  on  Applicant’s  FBI  report.  Applicant  admitted  this
allegation in his answer to the SOR. Court records show the offense was nolle prosequi
in October 2001. (Tr. 71-73, 95-96; AE K)
More  than  ten  years  ago,  Applicant  participated  in  counseling  associated  with
stress and completed the program. The facility does not retain records past ten years and
he  could  not  recall  the  exact  dates.  He  attended  anger  management  classes  in
approximately 2004-2005 and marriage counseling during the same period of time. He
indicated he gained valuable insight from the counseling. (Tr. 113-117; GE 3)
In November 2020, Applicant participated in an anger management assessment.
The assessment was done by a psychologist, who holds a Ph.D. and is a licensed marital
and  family  therapist.  Applicant  stated  that  after  receiving  the  SOR  it  prompted  him  to
reach out to have the assessment. He did it on his own volition. The psychologist did not
have  information  about  his past  domestic  violence  allegations from  Applicant’s  record,
and Applicant did not provide it to her. Her opinion is based solely on psychological tests
she  had  Applicant  complete.  Applicant  had high  scores  in  areas  that  indicate a  strong
understanding and  mastery of  different  skills sets,  some  of  which  manage  and  control
anger, stress, and aggressive  or disruptive  behavior.  He  showed  a  low score  in  areas
indicating little tendency to behave in an attacking manner and he had good boundary
skills with others. His scores reflected he was satisfied with his behavior and had a lower
level of motivation to change. The psychologist’s recommendation was: No further anger
management treatment recommended at this time. (Tr. 117, 153-155; AE M)
Applicant saw a mental health therapist (JPD) in November 2020 who specializes
in family counseling.  JPD  testified and  was  told  by Applicant he needed  an evaluation
and  letter  for  his  security  clearance  issues.  JPD  found  Applicant  sincere,  and  they
discussed  Applicant’s life  traumas and  coping  mechanism. JPD was aware of  some  of
Applicant’s past issues, but not all of them. He was unaware of the 2018 allegations or
the more dated allegations. Applicant explained the reason he provided the 2013 incident
was because that was the one he remembered. Applicant did not disclose the other SOR
allegations. JPD and Applicant had approximately eight counseling sessions. JPD opined
that Applicant had the tools to make good decisions and he accepted responsibility  for
his actions. Applicant was provided tools for looking at things from a different perspective
and coping mechanisms. JPD did not provide a formal diagnosis. He believed Applicant
to be sincere and trusted him to make good decisions. (Tr. 145-153; 213-232; AE L)
Since the last domestic violence incident in 2018, Applicant said there have been
family changes. LM is divorced from S, which caused great strife within the family. He
does not visit and is not part of their lives. Applicant has had a more active positive role
in helping raise his grandchildren. Since being diagnosed with diabetes he is on a strict
diet and exercise program. He and his family have taken steps to mitigate and ensure
there will be no future incidents and improved their communication skills. (GE 3)
Applicant’s Facility Security Officer testified on his behalf. He has known him for a
couple years.  He has had frequent interaction  with  Applicant.  He has  never witnessed
any aggressive behavior by Applicant  nor has he seen Applicant involved in a security
incident. Applicant is honest and reliable. Applicant has advised him of his past arrests.
He  does  not  have  security  concerns  about  Applicant.  He  was  aware  of  the  SOR
allegations. (Tr. 236-246)
Other  witnesses
testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  They  have  known  him
professionally  and  personally,  dating  back  to  1998.  They  all  had  varying  degrees  of
interaction with him, but all knew him very well. Some knew his family. None had concerns
about Applicant’s past  incidents  regarding  domestic violence.  None  had  ever observed
Applicant be aggressive or lose his temper. They have not observed him overindulge in
alcohol, nor do they believe he has a problem with alcohol. They did not have a concern
about  his  honesty,  integrity  or  trustworthiness.  He  has  treated  others  with  dignity  and
respect. He is considered a hard-worker and family-oriented. (Tr. 247-278)
Applicant  provided  numerous  documents  to  corroborate  his  outstanding  career
performance. He provided copies of certificates for awards he has received and training
he has completed. (AE S, T, U, V)
Applicant provided numerous character letters that attest that he is professional,

Applicant is a  39-year-old employee  of a  DOD contractor who  has worked  for this
employer since October 2018. (Tr. 8; GE 1) In 2000, he graduated  from high school. (Tr.
8)  In  2019, he  received  a  bachelor’s degree.  (Tr. 8; AE  13)  He served  in the  Navy  from
2007  to  August 2016. (Tr. 9) He received  a  general discharge  under honorable  conditions.
(Tr. 9)   He  was a  petty   officer second   class   (E-5) when  he   was discharged.  (Tr. 9)   His
Navy   specialty   was  logistics.  (Tr.  9)  He  was  married   from   2008   to   2011,  and   his  two
children   are   ages  12   and   14.   (Tr.  10)   His  dating   relationship   with   his  former  spouse
continued  until 2013. (Tr. 25)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  cited  a  contentious  divorce  in  2011  as  the  genesis  of  his  financial
problems leading up to his 2014 bankruptcy. (Tr. 22) He had expensive legal bills because
his former spouse made allegations against him. (Tr. 23) He went back to family court
three or four times to clarify visitation rules. (Tr. 24) He was not deployed after 2012. (Tr.
24) He was unemployed from August to October 2016, from January to September 2017,
and  from  April  to  October  2018.  (Tr.  45;  GE  13  at  2)  On  April  16,  2019,  an  Office  of
Personnel  Management  (OPM)
investigator  confronted  Applicant  about  several
delinquent debts. (GE 13 at 6-7) His current annual salary is $48,000. (Tr. 45) However,
it is unclear whether he included his income from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
or from his girlfriend in his income. (GE 13 at 2) His monthly child-support obligation is
$1,100, and  he  has  the  child-support  payment  made  automatically  from  his paycheck.
(Tr. 46) His monthly rent is $1,250, and his car payment is $600. (Tr. 47) He said he uses
a written budget, and he said he would provide it after his hearing. (Tr. 48) However, he
did not provide his budget. (Tr. 48) His tax returns are filed, and he does not currently
owe taxes. (Tr. 49-50) He did not provide copies of his tax returns for the last three years.
The SOR includes the following financial allegations:
SOR ¶  1.a alleges Applicant’s debts were discharged in June 2014 under Chapter
7 of the Bankruptcy Code. His unsecured nonpriority claims totaled $47,949. (GE 6 at 9)
His  priority  claims  included  $3,203  in  taxes,  $22,909  in  student  loans,  and  $1,394  in
domestic support. (Id. at 10) He owed federal income taxes for the following years: 2009
($906); 2011 ($736); 2012 ($781); and 2013 ($780). (Id. at 20) In his February 28, 2019
SCA he disclosed his bankruptcy in June 2014; however, he did not disclose that he failed
to pay his federal taxes when required by law in the previous seven years. (GE 1 at 50)
At his hearing, he said he paid his federal income tax debt with refunds for subsequent
tax years. (Tr. 26) However, he did not provide proof that his federal income taxes were
paid. He received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. (Tr. 44; GE 6)
SOR  ¶   1.b   alleges  a  judgment  was  entered  against  Applicant  in  April  2015  for
$1,506.  Payment  was  delayed  because  he  could  not  locate  the  creditor.  (Tr.  32)  He
employed a lawyer to assist him in arranging payment. (Tr. 32) On August 27, 2021, he
paid the judgment. (Tr. 31; AE 1)
SOR ¶¶  1.c  and  1.e  allege two judgments were entered against Applicant from the
same  creditor  in  January  2016  for  $503  and  in  February  2016  for  $1,270.  Applicant
satisfied the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c on November 20, 2020, and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e on
December 11, 2020. (Tr. 38-39; SOR response at 3; AE 2-3)
SOR  ¶¶   1.d   and   1.g  allege  two  judgments  for  city  tax  debts  entered  against
Applicant  in  February  2016  for  $62  and  in  February  2018  for  $62.  (AE  5)  Applicant
asserted he did not owe the two debts, and that he had a letter showing payment for the
first  one  in  February  2016.  (Tr.  35,  41)  He  did  not  provide  a  copy  of  the  letter.  On
December 28, 2020, he satisfied the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.d, and on December 16, 2020,
he satisfied the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.g. (Tr. 40-41; AE 6)
SOR  ¶  1.f   alleges  a judgment was  entered against  Applicant in  March  2017 for
$1,698. On May 3, 2021, he satisfied the judgment. (Tr. 40; AE 4)
SOR ¶¶  1.h  and  1.i  allege two charged-off debts for $451 and $863. On November
18, 2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h wrote the debt was “satisfied in full.” (SOR
response at 10) On November 24, 2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i wrote the
last payment was posted on November 20, 2020. (SOR response at 11)
SOR ¶¶  1.j, 1.k,  and  1.l allege three debts placed for collection for $863, $512, and
$353. On December 2, 2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j wrote that the account
was  settled  for  less  than  the  full  balance  on  November  30,  2020.  (Tr.  41-42;  SOR
response at 12) On November 14, 2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k wrote the
account  was  settled  for  less  than  the  full  balance.  (Tr.  42;  SOR  response  at  13)  On
November 13, 2020, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l wrote and thanked Applicant
for meeting his obligation. (Tr. 42; SOR response at 14)
Applicant intends to avoid delinquent debt in the future. (Tr. 44) He has read at
least  two  books  on  investing  and  finance.  (Tr.  44)  He  has  educated  himself  through
multiple sources on how to maintain his financial responsibility. (Tr. 44) He has several
non-SOR debts, which are in paid or in paid as agreed status in his credit reports. (GE 2,
3)
Criminal Conduct
The SOR contains the following criminal conduct allegations:
SOR ¶  2.a  alleges Applicant received nonjudicial punishment  (NJP) while in the
Navy  for  falsifying  dependency  documentation  in  order  to  receive  additional  financial
benefits. In his February 28, 2019 SCA Applicant said he received NJP in October 2014
for “failure to obey an order [and] false statements.” (GE 1 at 25) He was “found guilty,”
and he received 45 days of extra duty. (Id.) He said his command learned he was not
married when his former spouse called his command and informed them of the change
in  his marital status.  (Tr. 52)  Applicant  admitted  that he failed  to  update  his personnel
records  to  reflect  his  divorce.  (Tr.  50)  Applicant  told  an  OPM  investigator  that  the
falsification related to an allegation he was claiming “additional funds on his taxes.” (GE
13 at 2) He said it was an oversight, and he did not receive any additional benefits. (Tr.
52-53)
In  his  follow-up  September  17,  2019  OPM  interview,  Applicant  said  his  former
spouse was listed as his dependent on his military dependency document, which would
have  incorrectly  entitled  her  to  military/TRICARE  medical  benefits,  use  of  the
commissary, possession of a Navy identification card, etc. (GE 13 at 8) He received 45
days of extra duty, reduction to E-4 (suspended), and forfeiture of $1,213 pay per month
for two months (suspended) from his commander as a result of the NJP disposition. (Tr.
53-54; GE 13 at 8) There is no record evidence that Applicant received more pay due to
his records incorrectly indicating he was married in 2014 when he was actually divorced
in 2011. There is no evidence his former spouse fraudulently received medical care or
other  benefits  to  which  she  was  not  entitled  due  to  his  failure  to  timely  update  his
personnel records concerning his divorce.
SOR  ¶   2.b  alleges  Applicant   pleaded   no   contest  for  violation   of  a   custody   or
protection  order in  February  2016.  Applicant said from  2012  to  2017, his former spouse
“literally   made   [his]  life   a   living   hell   by   filing   false  undocumented   claims  of   things  like
abuse, stalking, kidnapping, just  –  you  name  it.  Anything  regarding  her and  the  children,
she  filed  it.” (Tr. 55)  She  alleged  that he  beat his children  with  a  belt,  punched  his eight-
year-old  son,  and   that  he   hit  his  son’s  head   against  a   concrete   wall,   giving   him   a
concussion. (Tr. 61-62)  Applicant claimed  the  judge  told him  that a  no  contest plea, “Well,
it doesn’t mean  you’re   guilty   or not guilty   . .  . but we  can  conclude   this case   –  by  that
plea.” (Tr. 56) Applicant decided  that it would be  best to  expedite  resolution  of  the  charge
with  a  no  contest plea. (Tr. 56) He received  a  fine  and  a  suspended  jail  sentence. (Tr. 56)
A  child protective  service  investigation  decided  her allegations  of physical  abuse  were
unfounded. (Tr. 62) The Navy based his discharge on his conviction. (Tr. 57) None of his
former spouse’s allegations of his abusive conduct resulted in convictions. (Tr. 55-59)
Applicant denied  that he  physically  abused  his former spouse  or his  children. (Tr.
64) In  order to  avoid conflict with  his  former spouse, Applicant has  ensured  that  he  has
not had  any contact with his former spouse since 2016. (Tr. 52, 60, 67)
Character Evidence
Applicant received  excellent Navy  evaluation  reports from  2011  to  2014. (AE  9-AE
11) He  received  a  negative  Navy  evaluation  report in  2015, which cited  his NJP,  and  in
2016,  which  cited   his violation   of   the   protection   order. (GE 13  at  8-9)  He   received   the
following   Navy   medals  and   awards:   two   Navy   Good   Conduct   Medals,  a   letter  of
commendation;   three   Navy   and   Marine   Corps  Achievement   Medals;  National  Defense
Service Medal; Global War  on  Terrorism  Expeditionary  Medal; Global War on  Terrorism
Service Medal; two  Sea  Service Deployment Ribbons; and  Navy  Expert Pistol Medal. (Tr.
20; AE  8, AE  12)  He  received  an  early  promotion  to  petty  officer second  class.  (Tr.  20)
He received a certificate of recognition, and his current employer has promoted  him.  (Tr.
20; AE  14) He received  a  certificate  of  voluntary  service from  the  state  public schools,
and  he is a state  basketball  official. (AE 15; AE 16)

"Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about June 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for
the first time. He is either a college graduate or just a few credits short of a degree. He
is divorced with three children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 50, 72; GE 1)
Applicant  has  a  history of  substance  abuse  and  criminal offenses  related  to  his
substance abuse. He became addicted to prescription opioid painkillers after he injured
his  back  sometime  between  about  2008  and  2011,  resulting  in  significant  pain.  The
physician’s  assistant  who  prescribed
for
overprescribing “oxycodone, hydrocodone, and other controlled substances” to patients
he  was  treating  for pain  management.  Applicant’s  addiction  led  to doctor shopping for
prescriptions,  alcohol  abuse,  employment  issues,  marital  difficulties,  and  financial
problems. In addition to the opioid painkillers, he would sometimes drink between a pint
and  a  fifth  of  vodka  a  day  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  3.a).  (Tr.  at  18-38,  82-96,  126;  Applicant’s
response to SOR, attachments A, F, P, S; GE 1, 2)
the  medication  was
later  sanctioned
Applicant was arrested in May 2013 and charged with two felony counts of falsely
obtaining  a  prescription  in  December  2012  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  2.c).  The  essence  of  the
offense is that he obtained a prescription for a controlled substance from one provider
without  informing  the  provider  that  he  also  received  the  controlled  substance  from
another source. He pleaded guilty on June 11, 2013, to falsely obtaining a prescription.
The second count was dismissed. He was sentenced to up to five years in prison, which
was  suspended  upon  his  completion  of  probation  for  36  months,  and  included
conditions  that  he  complete  substance  abuse  treatment,  and  not  possess  or  use
controlled  substances  or  alcohol.  The  felony  was  reduced  by  the  court  to  a
misdemeanor  in  December  2017.  (Tr.  at  38-41;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,
attachments A, G, H, N, P; GE 1-3)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  August  2013  and  charged  with  six  felony  counts  of
falsely obtaining a prescription between April 1, 2013, and June 10, 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b,
2.c).  He  pleaded  guilty  in  October  2013  to  three  felony  counts  of  falsely  obtaining  a
prescription.  The  three  remaining  counts  were  dismissed.  In  January  2014,  he  was
sentenced  to  up  to  five  years  in  prison  and  $15,000  in  fines.  The  prison  term  and
$14,397  of  the  fine  were  suspended  upon  his  completion  of  probation  for  36  months.
Conditions  of  his  probation  included  a  drug  and  alcohol  evaluation  and  completion  of
any  recommended  substance  abuse  treatment,  and  to  not  possess  or  use  controlled
substances  or  alcohol.  The  felonies  were  reduced  by  the  court  to  misdemeanors  in
February 2018. (Tr. at 38-41, 98; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachments A, H, N, P;
GE 1-3)
Applicant  continued  to  abuse  opioid  painkillers  and  alcohol  notwithstanding  the
two  convictions  and  probation.  He  completed  a  36-day  inpatient  substance  abuse
treatment  program  from  about  February  2014  to  April  2014.  He  reported  that  he  was
drinking between a pint and a fifth of vodka a day  with the opioids. He was diagnosed
with  alcohol  dependence  and  opioid  dependence  (SOR  ¶¶  2.d,  3.a,  3.b).  He  was
advised  to  remain  abstinent  from  alcohol  and  recommended  upon  discharge  for
aftercare  and  outpatient  treatment.  (Tr.  at  40-43,  96;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,
attachments I, P, R, S; GE 2, 5)
Applicant  did  not  follow  through  on  aftercare  or  outpatient  treatment,  and  he
relapsed after leaving the treatment facility. He found that alcohol enhanced the effects
of the opioids. He was driving under the influence of opioids and alcohol when he  was
arrested in May 2014. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was about two and a half
times  the  legal limit.  He  was  charged  with  driving under the  influence  of  alcohol/drugs
(DUI). He pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of impaired driving in May 2014. He was
sentenced to 90 days in jail, with the 90 days suspended, and a fine (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 3.b,
3.c). (Tr. at 42-46, 102-103; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachment J; GE 1-3, 5)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  found  in  violation  of  his  probation  for  the  2013
convictions,  and  his  probation  was  revoked  and  restarted.  He  was  sentenced  to  150
days  in  jail  for  the  June  2013  conviction,  with  all  but  three  weeks  served  at  a  work
release facility (SOR ¶ 1.d). He was sentenced to 365 days in jail for the August 2013
conviction, with all but three weeks served at a work release facility (SOR ¶ 1.e). (Tr. at
47-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
After  he  completed  the  work-release  program,  Applicant  resumed  abusing
alcohol  and  opioids,  including  oxycodone,  morphine,  and  fentanyl  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b).
From about April 2015 to June 2015, he used heroin  during a period that he could not
obtain  the prescription opioids.  Heroin was  also  cheaper than the prescription opioids.
(SOR  ¶  2.e).  In  June  2015,  he  checked  into  the  same  substance  abuse  treatment
facility for inpatient treatment for 45 days. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence
and  opioid  dependence  (SOR  ¶¶  2.f,  3.d).  The  facility  certified  that  he  successfully
completed the inpatient program in July 2015. He was then provided a 45-day aftercare
program. He was advised to remain abstinent from alcohol and opioids. In August 2015,
he successfully completed a workout-based life coaching program. (Tr. at 49-50, 51-57,
59, 97-99; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachments K, L, P, R, S; GE 2, 5)
Applicant did not use heroin after his discharge from the facility, but he returned
to  abusing  alcohol  and  opioids,  including  fentanyl  (SOR  ¶  2.b).  He  was  again  driving
under the influence of opioids and alcohol when he was arrested in December 2015. His
BAC  was  about  two  times  the  legal  limit.  He  was  charged  with  DUI  and  alcohol-
restricted  driver.  In  March  2016,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI,  and  the  alcohol-restricted
driver charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to four days in jail and a fine (SOR  ¶
1.c). (Tr. at 51-55, 102-103; Applicant’s response to SOR, attachment M; GE 4)
There  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  has  used  any  illegal  controlled  substances
after 2016. His  parents,  who  could  always  tell when  he  was  using,  have not observed
any indication of use in years. He returned to the workout-based program in 2016. He
enrolled  in  a  90-day  workout  and  addiction-recovery  program  in  March  2019.  The
program  “requires  at  least  90  days  of  commitment  to  strenuous  activity,  dedication  to
sobriety, and active involvement in [their] fitness, nutritional, spiritual, and life coaching
curriculum.”  He  continues  to  be  actively  involved  in  the  program,  and  he  sees  a
therapist   unrelated   to   that  program.  He   has  learned   to   deal  with   his  back  pain   with
ibuprofen   and   an   active   lifestyle.   He  is  motivated   by   his  children   and   his  faith   to   stay
clean.  He  has   disassociated   himself   from   drug-using   associates  and   contacts,  and   he
passed   numerous  drug   tests.   He  signed   a  statement  of  intent   to   abstain  from   all   drug
involvement  and   substance   misuse,  acknowledging   that  any   future  involvement  or
misuse  is grounds  for revocation  of national security  eligibility.  (Tr. at 59-65,  70-82,  100-
102,  107-121,  125-126, 135; Applicant’s response  to  SOR,   attachments O,  P,  Q,  T,  U;
GE  2; AE A, B)
In  2020,  Applicant  was  prescribed  a  prescription  opioid  to  deal  with  pain  in  a
tooth before a root canal (SOR ¶ 4.a). He did not enjoy the experience and did not use
the  drugs  again  after  the  procedure  was  completed.  He  stated  that  he  has  not  had
cravings for opioids in four or five years, and the short use of a prescription medication
in 2020 did not change that. (Tr. at 67-70, 94-96; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant stated that he does not believe that alcohol was ever his real problem,
and  that  he  never  really  enjoyed  large  amounts  of  alcohol.  As  such,  he  does  not  feel
that  he  has  to  completely  abstain.  He  describes  his  drinking  as  occasional  and
responsible. He stated that his last drink was in November 2021 (SOR ¶ 3.f). (Tr. at 45,
50, 65-67; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August  2018.  He  reported  most  of  his  substance  abuse  and  criminal  history,  but  he
intentionally  failed  to  report  his  heroin  use  (SOR  ¶  4.b).  He  admitted  that  he  felt,  and
continues to feel, shame about his heroin use. (Tr. at 56-58, 103; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  June  2019.  He
discussed  his  addiction  to  opioid  painkillers,  including  oxycodone,  but  he  did  not
mention heroin use. He admitted heroin use in interrogatories in January 2020 after he
was specifically asked about heroin use as documented in records obtained by the DOD
from  the  substance  abuse  treatment  facility  where  Applicant  was  treated  in  2014  and
2015. He admitted at his hearing that if the DOD did not know about his heroin use, he
would  be  conflicted  and  it  would  be  very  hard  to  discuss  it,  even  at  his  hearing.  He
clarified that if he was directly asked about his heroin use, he would be honest.  (Tr. at
104-106; GE 2)
Applicant  called  three  witnesses,  and  he  submitted  documents  and  letters
attesting to his excellent job performance and strong moral character. He is praised for
his dedication, reliability, competence, enthusiasm, attention to detail, leadership, work
ethic,  trustworthiness,  and  integrity.  (Tr.  at  19-61;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR,

disclosed a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, moderate, remission status undetermined,
with  questions  regarding  his  candor  and  minimization  of  current  alcohol  consumption
levels.  The  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant’s  judgment  and  reliability  are

alcohol and domestic violence arrests (SOR ¶ 3.b). Applicant denied SOR ¶¶ 3.a and 3.b.
The  Government’s  exhibits  and  testimony  support  the  SOR  allegations,  except  as
specifically addressed below.
Applicant’s  criminal  history  began  in  1996  when  he  was  arrested  for  domestic
violence against his girlfriend at the time, who later became his spouse. He and his current
spouse  were  living together from 1996 to 2001, then again  in  2010.  Applicant testified
about an argument between him and his girlfriend after a football game where she was
the  aggressor,  he  called  the  police,  and  she  left  the  home.  However,  he  claims  they
arrested him because they spoke to him, he was the male, and he was considered the
“perpetrator.”  He was convicted  of inflicting corporal injury on a spouse/cohabitant  and
sentenced to 10 days’ confinement and three years’ probation.
In  1998  he  was  arrested  for  misdemeanor  minor  in  possession  of  liquor,
intimidating/stalking,  and  minor  driving  after  drinking.  He  was  found  guilty  of  minor  in
possession  and  driving  after  drinking,  and  sentenced  in  May  2000  to  five  days’
confinement  and  probation.  The  record  is  unclear  whether  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c  are
duplicates of the same offenses as asserted by the Applicant, and insufficient evidence
was introduced to made a determination, therefore SOR ¶ 1.c is found in Applicant’s favor.
In  September 2000,  Applicant  was arrested  for DUI and  DUI  with  a  BAC of  .10  or
more.   He  was  found   guilty   in  January   2001   and   sentenced   to   10   days’  confinement,
suspended. Then, in October 2001, he  was arrested  for felony  aggravated  assault with  a
deadly   weapon,  felony   burglary   in  the   1st   degree,  and   felony   aggravated   assault  –
entering  a  residence. He pleaded  guilty  to felony  aggravated  assault in December 2001,
and  was sentenced  to  three  months’ confinement and  three  years’  probation.   Applicant
claims he  entered  his girlfriend’s  residence  while  they  were fighting  and  he  was arrested.
He asserted  that he  and  his spouse, who  was his girlfriend  at the  time, argued  and  fought
often  after consuming  alcohol. He testified  that he  was permitted  into  his cousin’s home
and  confronted  his girlfriend  there,  and  pushed  her. In  his personal  subject  interview  (PSI)
(GE  2),  he   claimed   that  he   violated   probation   from   his  2000   DUI  conviction   for  not
completing  court-ordered  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) classes and  not checking  in with
his probation  officer as  directed. He also  violated  probation  for having  a  new  offense  in
2001.
In August 2002, Applicant violated probation and a bench warrant was issued for
his arrest. In December 2002, he was arrested in another state as a fugitive from justice
based on his bench warrant. His probation was revoked in February 2003, and he was
sentenced  to  serve  three  years’  confinement.  He  was  confined  from  2002  to  2005.
Applicant claimed he was homeless during this period and left the state with his mother
knowing that it violated his probation terms. He refused to follow the directions from his
probation officer in order to leave the state, and made a “decision right there on the spot
to go to [another state] with my mom” to keep his wife and kids off the street. (Tr. 49.) He
said the burglary, assault to enter a residence, and assault charges were reduced to one
domestic violence charge.
In  2007,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  inflicting  corporal  injury  on  a
spouse/cohabitant. He was with another girlfriend at the time, who he claimed would call
the police after every incident because she knew he was vulnerable to criminal charges.
They drank, argued, and fought. He claimed she drank more than him and was “acting
out,” so he told her to leave and she called the police. She failed to appear in court as the
complaining witness, so the case was dismissed.
In 2010, he was again arrested for inflicting corporal injury on spouse/cohabitant
and vandalism of $400 or more. He claims the charges resulted from another fight with
his girlfriend, who failed to appear in court as a complaining witness, and were dismissed.
In 2019, Applicant was arrested for DUI and DUI with a BAC of .08 or more after
returning from a “date night” outing with his spouse. In 2020, he pleaded guilty to DUI with
a  BAC  of  .08  or more,  and  was  sentenced  to  180  days’  confinement  and  three  years’
probation. He testified that his BAC was .14, despite his answer to the SOR where he
claimed he had “a drink with dinner” that evening. He served community service and his
sentence  to  confinement  was  suspended.  He  remains  on  probation  until  January  28,
2023.
No alcohol consumption is permitted while he is on probation. As a result, Applicant
stated since returning from prison, he only drank on “special occasions,” but he stopped
drinking after March 9, 2019, and denies having an alcohol disorder. (Ans.)
In  2017,  Applicant  completed  his  SCA  but  failed  to  disclose  his  charges  and
convictions involving domestic violence or alcohol or drugs as required in SCA Section
22 – Police Record. He testified that he read the questions as only asking about offenses
in the last seven years, not “ever” as indicated in questions regarding domestic violence
and  alcohol  offenses.  The  offenses  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.d  required
disclosure on the SCA, but Applicant did not list them. In his post-hearing submission, he
highlighted some areas on his SCA where he disclosed some items, but with reference
to the section asking about domestic violence or alcohol related charges, he changed his
“no” answer to “yes,” and wrote “mistake – sorry.” (AE A (SCA pages))
In addition, Applicant was terminated from employment in May 2016 for violation
of the company code of conduct and harassment policy. (GE 9) The company reported
that on May 11, 2016, Applicant was aggressive to and threatened another employee,
and referred to supervisors with inappropriate racial slurs. He was terminated on May 16,
2016.  Applicant  did  not  disclose  this  termination  on  his  2017  SCA  as  required  under
Section 13A - Employment Activities. Applicant testified that his employer’s termination
report was false, and he did not believe he was terminated, rather he was laid off and
received  unemployment  insurance  benefits.  In  a  post-hearing  exhibit,  he  provided
evidence  of receiving  $2,250  in  unemployment compensation.  The  document,  in  and  of
itself,  is  not  dipositive   as  to   whether  he   was  laid   off,  fired,  or  both.   He  admitted   in
testimony, that he  had  a  verbal altercation  with  his supervisor after he  was laid  off,  but
denied any verbal altercations or  use of  racial slurs about  his supervisors, but he  agreed
that  he  may  have  been  fired  after being  laid  off.  In  his PSI,  Applicant disclosed  that he
had  a  verbal altercation  with  his manager after being  laid  off, and  told him  to  “F---- off.”
As a  result, the  manager tried  to  deny  him  unemployment benefits,  but he  appealed  the
matter in “unemployment court” and was awarded  benefits. (GE 2)
The DCSA CAF referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation, which occurred
in September 2020. (GE 3) Despite claiming in testimony and in his answer to the SOR
that  he  stopped  drinking  in  2019,  the  psychologist  reported  that  he  stated  he  was
“currently”  consuming  alcohol  once  every  three  weeks  or  on  holidays  and  special
occasions, and consumes an average of four beers on those occasions. He denied ever
consuming alcohol in greater frequency than that, or that alcohol had ever impaired his
social, interpersonal, or occupational functioning.  The doctor noted that documentation
he reviewed showed Applicant reported consuming larger amounts in the past, including
consuming  12-18  beers  over  a  three-day  period,  and  the  impacts  alcohol  had  on  his
conflicts with his spouse. Applicant admitted in his 2018 PSI that from age 16 to 25, he
consumed 10 beers each day on weekends, and from age 25 to present, he consumed
18 beers on weekends over the entire weekend (Friday to Sunday).
Of note, the psychologist stated that Applicant admitted to a verbal altercation with
his supervisor, and that he was given a choice to work part-time or take unemployment
compensation.  He  chose  unemployment  compensation,  but  “received  a  letter  several
months  later  from  unemployment  services  stating  that  he  should  not  have  received
benefits due to him being ‘fired.’” Applicant told the doctor that he disputed the company’s
allegation  and  was  able  to  maintain  his  unemployment  benefits.  He  admitted  that  he
engaged in an altercation with a supervisor and cursed at him, but vehemently denied
using any racial language. (GE 3, p.2)
Applicant reported participating in several anger management classes but did not
complete the courses. He and his girlfriend also participated in about five to six counseling
sessions.  Applicant  also  noted  he  did  not  like  the  constant  oversight  and  invasion  of
privacy that came with being on probation, which led to him avoiding his probation officer
and eventual probation violation.
The  psychologist  determined  that  Applicant  is  not  currently  experiencing  any
significant psychological symptoms that would disqualify him from being able to hold a
security clearance, however, his history of  sustained alcohol use across his  lifespan is
indicative of an alcohol use disorder. Applicant’s examination showed that he answered
questions with a “high degree of defensiveness” and he attempted to portray himself as
being free of faults and managed the impressions and denials he gave to minimize “even
the most common shortfalls” to a degree well outside the expected range. It was noted
that  Applicant  struggles
including  compulsiveness,  alcohol  abuse,
suspiciousness, and inflated self-esteem. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder,
in  areas
moderate,  remission   status   undetermined.   Cumulatively,  the   findings  show   Applicant’s
“judgment and  reliability  are compromised  by  his past,  and  likely  current,  alcohol use. Due
to   the   variety   of   omissions   and   lack   of  candor  in  his  reporting,  the   [Applicant’s]
trustworthiness cannot  be  considered  intact and  should also be  viewed  with  a  high  level
of   caution.”   In   testimony,  Applicant  disputed   the   doctor’s  findings  and   conclusions  and
believed  the doctor was trying  to  catch  him  in  a  lie.  He  stated  that he  did  not feel he  was
an  alcoholic because  “an  alcoholic is somebody  who  drinks beer every  day  constantly, …
to cope with life, to deal with their problems, and all that stuff.”  (Tr. 77)
Government exhibit (GE  11) is a  company  report to  the  DoD  alleging  that Applicant
provoked  a  dispute  with  a  coworker in August 2020.  Apparently, Applicant commented
on  the  employee’s IQ  and  called  him  “retarded,”  then  challenged  him  to  “do  something
about it”  in  a  face-to-face  confrontation. Applicant was reprimanded  for violating  company
policy. This  incident  was not  alleged  in the  SOR.  I  will  consider this unalleged  incident  in
assessing  Applicant’s credibility; in evaluating  his  evidence  of  extenuation, mitigation, or
changed   circumstances;  in  considering   whether  he   has  demonstrated   successful
rehabilitation; and  in applying  the  whole-person  concept. See, e.g., ISCR  Case  No.  15-
07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017).
In  addition  to  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  included  work  awards  and
certificates,  and  character  letters  from  his  wife,  daughter,  and  daughter’s  fiancé.  As  I
mentioned in the hearing, these statements appeared strangely similar and do not attest
to him ceasing use of alcohol in 2019. (Tr. 78-79) In a post-hearing submission, Applicant
submitted several letters of support from his current coworkers, supervisor and manager
attesting to his work ethic, honesty, decency, and superb work performance. He testified
about his love for his work and country, and current healthy lifestyle with his spouse and
children.
",False
"In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  allegations in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and
1.b. He  did not  expressly  admit or deny  the  allegation  in SOR ¶  2.a, cross-alleging  the
criminal conduct in SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  as  personal conduct. His  admissions in his  answer
are incorporated in  my findings of  fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old structural designer employed by a defense contractor
since September 2014. He received a security clearance in December 2014. He has a
high school education.
Applicant  married  in  March  2011.  After  several  years  in  a  mutually  difficult
marriage, his wife filed a divorce petition, which was granted in April 2017. They have an
eight-year-old son, who lives with his mother.
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  drinking  heavily  after  the  divorce  and  described
himself as a “mess.” He was angry and upset. His ex-wife had begun a relationship with
another man within a week after the divorce, and she and their son had moved in with the
other man. (Tr. 27.)
In  2018,  Applicant  posted  “a  couple  hundred”  intimate  images  of  his  ex-wife  on
pornographic websites on the Internet. Applicant’s ex-wife had taken the images and sent
them to him. (Tr. 25.) Before and during the marriage, they had sent sexually-oriented
pictures of themselves to each other. (Tr. 55.) The images that Applicant posted on the
Internet included images of his ex-wife performing sexual acts. (Tr. 23.) His ex-wife did
not consent to posting the images on the Internet. (Tr. 27.)
When  Applicant’s  ex-wife  discovered  the  images,  she  filed  a  criminal  complaint
against Applicant for disseminating voyeuristic material. A warrant for Applicant’s arrest
was  issued  but  not  served.  He  tried  to  remove  the  images,  with  limited  success.  He
estimated that 95% of the images were removed from the websites where he had posted
them, but he could not estimate how many had been shared and redistributed. (Tr. 30.)
In late 2018, Applicant’s ex-wife and their son moved back in with him. (Tr. 33.) In
January 2019, his ex-wife accused him of raping their son, who was five years old at the
time.  She  had  a  drink  in  her  hand  and  was  poking  him  in  the  chest  with  a  crowbar.
Applicant  believed  that  she  was  drunk.  (Tr.  54.)  When  she  tried  to  prevent  him  from
leaving the room, he slapped her. After he slapped her, she applied dark makeup to make
it appear that she had been bruised, posted a photo of herself on Facebook, and notified
the police that she had been assaulted. (Tr. 36-40.) Applicant was arrested, charged with
assault and disorderly conduct, fingerprinted, and released on his own recognizance
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  from  the  child  protective  service
office, and his son was examined by medical personnel, but no further action was taken
regarding his ex-wife’s accusation of raping their son. (Tr. 37-38.) He hired an attorney to
defend himself against the charge of assaulting his ex-wife.
Later in January 2019, Applicant was stopped by police for a traffic infraction, and
the police discovered the outstanding warrant for disseminating voyeuristic material. He
was arrested pursuant to the outstanding warrant, taken to the police station, and held
until  his ex-wife  picked  him  up  at  the  jail  and  took  him  to  the  courthouse  to  appear  in
response  to the assault  charge.  Under the  law of  the  state  where the  alleged  conduct
occurred, disseminating voyeuristic material and assault in the third degree are Class A
misdemeanors, and disorderly conduct is a Class C misdemeanor. The charges of assault
and distribution of voyeuristic material were consolidated into a single trial in mid-2019.
In November 2019, the court ordered Applicant to attend an eight-week family-violence
education class, and the judge informed him that all the charges against him would be
dismissed if he successfully completed the class. The class was delayed by COVID, but
Applicant  successfully  completed  the  class  in  October  2020.  The  charges  of  assault,
disorderly conduct, and distribution of voyeuristic material were dismissed on November
27, 2020. Applicant was required to pay $400 for the class, plus attorney’s fees. (GX 2 at
9-18.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  stopped  drinking  in  mid-2018  and  concentrated  on
physical fitness. (Tr. 33.) In March or April 2019, before the court-ordered classes began,
he  started  consulting  with  a  family  psychologist.  (Tr.  51-52.)  He  found  the  personal
counseling and the court-ordered classes very helpful. (Tr. 47.) He regrets his behavior.
He and his ex-wife now have limited their contact to matters involving their son. He is now
in a committed relationship with another woman “who even goes to church on Sundays.”
(Tr. 59.)
",True
"Under Guideline D, the Government alleged that in November 2017, Applicant was
arrested and charged with forcible sexual assault, pleaded guilty to a different included
charge, was ordered to register as a sex offender, and  will be on supervised probation
until  November  2022  (SOR  1.a).  The  SOR  1.a  allegations  was  cross-alleged  under
Guideline J (SOR 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR 3.a).
Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $25,413 for three
delinquent  or  past-due  debts  (SOR  4.a  –  4.c);  and  that  he  did  not  file  as  required  his
federal (SOR 4.d) and state (SOR 4.e) income tax returns for the 2017 tax year.
In response to the SOR (Answer), Applicant denied with explanation the allegation
at  SOR  1.a,  and  by  reference,  the  SOR  2.a  and  3.a  allegations.  He  denied  with
explanations and supporting documents all of the Guideline F allegations. (Answer) After
reviewing  the  pleadings,  as  well  as  the  testimony  and  exhibits  produced  at  hearing,  I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 54 years old. He and his wife have been married since May 1989 and
they have two grown children. Applicant served on active duty in the United States Army
from July 1986 until retiring as a senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) in October 2010.
While on active  duty,  he deployed  at least four times  to  combat zones in  Afghanistan,
Iraq, and elsewhere. Applicant has a 100 percent disability rating from the Department of
Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  His  service-related  disabilities  include  post-traumatic  stress
disorder (PTSD). After retiring from the Army in 2010, Applicant was hired by a defense
contractor for work on a training contract. He has continued to do the same work, but for
different employers, as each  company succeeded the other in winning the contract for
that work. Applicant has worked for his current employer since at least 2019; however,
he has been unable to work since early 2020 pending final adjudication of his security
clearance. Applicant has held a security clearance at various levels of access since early
in his Army career. (GX 1; GX 2; AX B; Tr. 34 – 35, 48 – 50)
Applicant has lived and worked in State A since at least 2010. In November 2017,
Applicant was sent to a military facility in State B on temporary duty. He once had been
assigned  in  that  area  of  State  B  while  on  active  duty  and  took  advantage  of  the
assignment  to  visit  some  old  familiar  places  while  there.  One  of  those  places  was  a
nightclub where he decided to take in a band that was playing there. In trying to cope with
PTSD,  Applicant  had  not  consumed  alcohol  for  almost  a  year  prior;  however,  at  the
nightclub on the night of November 16, 2017, Applicant had four mixed drinks and two
shots of tequila. That evening he also met a woman (J) who went with Applicant back to
his hotel room where they had sex. Applicant claimed, in his PSI and during his testimony,
that J did not want to go home because her boyfriend would be mad for some reason.
Whereupon,  Applicant  offered  to  take  J  to  his  hotel  room.  When  they  got  there,  they
engaged in what he insists was consensual sex. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3)
During  his  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  a  government  investigator  on
February 22, 2019, Applicant stated he did not see J drink at the nightclub, that he did
not smell alcohol on her breath, and that she did not appear to him to be impaired. He
also stated that he believed she was able to consent to having sex with him and that they
engaged in consensual sex that evening. However, at hearing, he testified that he noticed
her eyes were “glassy” before they went to his hotel room. He further acknowledged that
she may have been under the influence of something other than alcohol and that such an
impairment  could  render  J  unable  to  knowingly  consent  to  having  sex  with  him.
Applicant’s sexual encounter with J was not the first time he had engaged in extra-marital
sexual relations. (GX 2; Tr. 28 – 29, 33, 56 – 57)
In   his PSI,   Applicant   stated   that  after he   and   J  finished  having   sex,  she   quickly
gathered  her things and  left. He  further  averred  that he  went to  work the  next day, but
when  he  returned  the  local police  were waiting  for him. J had  apparently  told the  hotel
front desk on  her way out the  night before   that she  had  been  raped. Applicant did not
explain  why  police  were  not called  when  she  reported  what had  happened.  Indeed,  court
records  produced  by  the  Government  show  an  arrest  on  November 17,  2017, at  12:45
a.m.  (GX   3   at   p.   2)  After  questioning   Applicant  about   what  had   happened,  the   police
arrested  him  and  charged  him  with  felony  sexual assault by  force  or submission. Because
it was the  Thanksgiving  holiday, Applicant  spent five  days in jail before he  could obtain
bail. He notified his employer upon his release from jail about what had happened, hired
a local attorney, then returned home to State A. (GX 2; Tr. 26 – 27)
In October 2018, Applicant agreed to a plea deal whereby he pleaded guilty to a
lesser included felony of sexual assault on a person whose ability to consent is impaired
by drugs  or alcohol.  He  testified  that  he  would  have  preferred to  go  to  trial,  especially
because  it was  doubtful J  would  have  appeared  to  testify.  He  averred  that  she  was  in
drug rehab in another state around the time the trial would have started. He was ordered
to complete sex offender counseling, register in State B as a sex offender, and assessed
$5,650 in court costs. Applicant was also placed on probation until November 2022. His
probation  is still in  place  and  requires him to  report to a probation  officer each month.
Applicant is no longer on the sex offender registry in either State A or B. Applicant’s wife
is aware of his arrest, but it is not clear from this record if his wife knows about his other
extra-marital  affairs.  Applicant  claims  their  marriage  is  now  much  stronger  for  having
worked through this issue. He also is more dedicated to his religious beliefs and he has
completely stopped drinking. (GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 29 – 33)
Applicant claims he accepted the plea deal because he did not think he could get
a fair trial given prevailing public opinion in State B in response to national news reports
of  sexual  mistreatment  of  women.  He  also  did  not  want  to  continue  paying  legal  fees
because, before his arrest he already was dealing with financial difficulties in the form of
past-due or delinquent credit cards. He had paid off most of his debts and did not have
sufficient cash on hand to pay his lawyer out of pocket. The three credit card debts alleged
in the SOR were incurred during the summer of 2019 as he used them to pay his legal
fees. In response to the SOR and at his hearing, Applicant established that he has repaid
those three debts, and that he has finished repaying his older debts, by obtaining a debt
consolidation loan and by refinancing the mortgage on his house with an equity cash-out
of about $29,000. (Answer; GX 2 – 5; AX A; Tr. 29 – 31, 35 – 40)
As  alleged  at  SOR  4.d  and  4.e,  Applicant  did  not  timely file  his  state  or federal
income tax returns for the 2017 tax year. In response, Applicant provided information that
established his failure to file was inadvertent – the result of miscommunication with the
tax preparer he was using at the time. He filed the returns as soon as he learned of the
discrepancy and established repayment plans for any taxes owed. (Answer; Tr. 40 – 43)
Applicant’s current finances appear stable. He has not incurred  any new unpaid
debts. In addition to his defense contractor income, his wife earns money through part-
time  employment,  and  he  receives  recently-increased  VA  disability  benefits,  Social
Security benefits, and military retired pay. His total household income after deductions is
estimated at $10,000 monthly, which provides Applicant and his wife ample positive cash
flow each month.  (GX 5; AX A; AX B; Tr. 44 – 47, 51 – 52)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  except  for  ¶  2.a.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 6 lines
9~10.) He has been employed with the defense contractor for more than four years. (GX
1 at page 11.) He currently does not hold a security clearance. Applicant is married, and
has three children. (TR at page 17 line 18 to page 20 line 8, and GX 1 at pages 34~35.)
Guideline J - Criminal Conduct  & Guideline G  - Alcohol Consumption
1.a. and  2.a In November of 2008, Applicant was arrested for and subsequently
was found guilty of, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). (TR at page 22 line 6
to  page  27  line  4,  and  GX  2  at  page  10.)  He  was  required  to  attend  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA)  meetings  for  six  months,  and  also  required  to  complete  a  “a  nine-
month  drug  and  alcohol  course”  and  “a  MADD  class,  Mothers  Against  Drunk  Driving.”
(TR at page 26 lines 6~14.)
1.b., 1.d.  and 2.a. About ten years later, Applicant was again arrested for Driving
Under  the  Influence  of  Alcohol.  Pursuant  to  a  plea  bargain,  the  DUI  charge  was
dismissed  and  Applicant  was  placed  on  unsupervised  probation  for  five  years,  until
2023.  (TR  at  page  29  line  15  to  page  35  line  4,  and  GX  2  at  page  20.)  He  was  also
required to complete an 18-month DUI course, and attend AA meetings for 26 weeks.
Applicant’s driver’s license was also suspended. (GX 2 at page 20.)
1.c.   and   1.d.  The  following  year,  in  September  of  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested
and  charged  with  Driving  Without  a  License.  (TR  at  page  38  line  7  to  page  42  line  9,
and GX 2 at page 21.) As part of his sentence, Applicant was placed on unsupervised
probation  for  three  years,  to  run  concurrent  with  the  before-mentioned  five-year
probation. (Id.) He is currently on probation.

"Applicant admitted all allegations contained in the SOR, (¶¶ 1.a-1.f, and 2.a.), but
she denied the single allegation under Guideline E. (¶ 3.a.) In addition to her admissions,
she  provided  explanations  and  submitted  two  documents  from  a  substance  abuse
treatment provider with her response to the SOR; one dated August 11, 2017, and the
other dated March 7, 2018. (Answer)
Applicant  is  46   years  old.  She   earned   an   associate’s  degree   in  1996.   She   was
divorced  from her first husband  in 2004. They have four daughters, ages 27, 25, 21, and
18. She  remarried  her  second  spouse  in  2011.  Since  August  2018,  she  is  employed  by  a
federal contractor as a  CATS  analyst,  but because  it is a  small  company, she  performs a
variety  of employment duties,  to  include  assistant  facility  security  officer.  She  held a  DOD
security   clearance   from   2006   when   she   was  first  employed   by   a   federal  contractor.  In
2010  she  worked for a  different federal contractor until she  was laid  off  in October 2016.
She   is  required   to   possess  a   security   clearance   to   perform   specific  job   duties  for  her
employer. (Tr. 24-31; GE 1,  GE  3)
In July 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations
Processing  (e-QIP).  She  disclosed  a  July  2015  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol
(DUI)  arrest.  In  October  2017,  a  government  investigator  conducted  a  background
interview  with  Applicant.  They  discussed  Applicant’s  listed  July  2015  DUI  arrest.  She
volunteered that she had been arrested in September 2016 and charged with a second
DUI,  which  was  discussed.  A  third  DUI  arrest  was  developed,  and  she  admitted  after
questioning that she had been arrested in June 2017, but that she had not yet appeared
in  court.  On  July  15,  2020,  Applicant  reviewed  the  interview  report  and  certified  the
information provided therein was accurate and true. (GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 43)
Applicant  consumed alcohol,  at  times  in  excess  and  to  the  point of  intoxication,
since  about  age  15  to  at  least  July  2017  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  During  the  October  2017
background interview, Applicant stated that she began consuming alcohol regularly in her
early 30s and drank a half bottle of wine three to four times a week. She believed  her
consumption of alcohol was not excessive. After her first DUI arrest in July 2015 (¶ 1.b),
counseling helped her stop drinking alcohol for a short period of time. She resumed her
use  of  alcohol  to  self-medicate  when  experiencing  high  levels  of  stress.  Her  alcohol
consumption continued despite her second DUI arrest in September 2016 (¶ 1.c). After
her  third  arrest  for  DUI  in  June  2017  (¶  1.e),  she  voluntarily  admitted  herself  into  a
substance abuse rehabilitation center (¶ 1.f). She told the investigator that she does not
intend to use alcohol in the future. (GE 3; Tr. 34-36, 40-46)
Applicant  responded  to  an  alcohol  interrogatory  with  attached  medical  records,
which  she  completed  in  July  2020.  She  admitted  that  she  drank  alcohol  again  during
Christmas 2019. She listed that she realized that she cannot drink like a “normal person
on a regular basis.” She periodically attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings until
2018.  At  the  hearing  she  admitted  that  she  attended  a  total  of  approximately  10  AA
meetings, and she did not attend any other AA meetings after 2018, or that she needed
AA support after her December 2019 relapse. (GE 2; Tr. 51-55)
Post-hearing  documents  submitted  by  Department  Counsel  included  the  police
reports for the three alcohol-related arrests in 2015, 2016, and 2017. According to one
report, Applicant was stopped by police in July 2015 at approximately 7:00 p.m. When
the police officer asked her if she had any alcohol to drink, Applicant stated; “I had three
drinks at lunch today because that is part of my job.” The officer noted in the report that
she was wearing high heeled shoes which were removed before she was administered
the field sobriety tests. When asked if she would consent to taking a breathalyzer test,
Applicant responded that if she took the test she would go to jail. She told the police officer
that she  held a  security clearance  and  if  her employer found  out  she  was “[expletive].”
She took the test and her blood alcohol content (BAC) registered 0.258.  Applicant was
taken into custody and charged with DUI and violating a traffic control signal.  She was
ultimately found guilty of DUI and she was placed into a diversion program with specific
conditions to include enrolling into an alcohol treatment program and to not consume any
alcohol while she was on her one-year probation. (GE 3; GE 5; Tr. 40-42, 79)
During the hearing, Applicant explained the circumstances which resulted in her
first  DUI  arrest.  After  she  got  off  from  work,  she  went  to  a  bar  and  consumed  some
alcoholic drinks, but she could not recall how many she drank. Applicant was specifically
asked if she had ever been under the influence of alcohol while working, and she replied;
“never.” Department Counsel asked Applicant if she had told the investigator during her
background interview that she had consumed six shots of liquor before she was arrested
for her first DUI, and she admitted that was accurate. Department Counsel asked her if
she was aware that her BAC of 0.258 was more than three times over the legal limit, and
Applicant said she was surprised by that information. When asked again whether she had
ever reported to work under the influence of alcohol, Applicant admitted that a previous
employer  had  a  private  conversation  with  her  about  alcohol.  When  confronted  with
information  developed  from  her  background  investigation  from  a  previous  employer,
Applicant did not recall that her supervisor had found her in an intoxicated state on two
occasions in October 2016, or that her husband had to pick her up and take her home on
both occasions. She also did not recall that in October 2016 her employer laid her off, in
part, due to her excessive use of alcohol while on the job. (Tr. 40-44, 59, 77-78, 89-91)
The  September  2016  police  report  disclosed  a  phone  call  was  made  about  the
welfare of a woman who had gotten out of a parked vehicle and urinated, returned to her
car and passed out. When the police officers arrived at approximately 4:30 p.m., Applicant
was  slumped  over  the  steering  wheel  of  a  running  car.  The  officers  knocked  on  the
window, nudged her shoulder, and reported that her cell phone was also ringing loudly.
She was unresponsive. Paramedics were called to the scene; the car was turned off; and
the keys were removed from the ignition. When an officer tried to get Applicant to rest
back in her car seat, she opened her eyes. There was a strong odor of alcohol coming
from her. The officer told Applicant that an emergency squad was coming and asked her
what she had to drink. She responded that she drank two bottles of vodka. Applicant was
arrested and charged with DUI and parking on a curb. When she arrived at the station,
her BAC registered 0.283. Ultimately, the DUI charge was dismissed but the court added
an  additional year  of  treatment  to  the  2015 diversion  program  requirements.  Applicant
had violated the terms of her probation by consuming alcohol when the second alcohol-
related arrest occurred. (GE 6; Tr. 42-43, 82-87)
Applicant  received  treatment  from  about  October  2015  to  October  2017,  for  a
condition  diagnosed  as  alcohol  abuse  disorder.  (¶  1.d)  Applicant  stated  she  had
approximately monthly therapy sessions during the two-year period. She admitted that
she continued to consume alcohol during her treatment and against medical advice. She
was arrested for her third DUI a few months before the treatment program ended. (Tr. 42,
44-45, 47-48)
The June 2017 police records disclosed that Applicant had moved her daughter’s
car, and while turning at an intersection, she hit a street sign which damaged the car. She
did not report the accident to police. The police officer who had filed the 2017 report noted
that she previously had four contacts with Applicant, all involving alcohol, to include a DUI
arrest  in  2016. When Applicant  was  asked  if  she  had been  drinking alcohol,  Applicant
stated “a few sips of wine.” She did not pass the field sobriety tests and was taken into
custody. Applicant registered 0.199 BAC at the station. She was charged with DUI and
failure to give information after striking unattended property. The day following the arrest
Applicant admitted to the police officer that she had been to the liquor store and drank “a
vodka shooter” prior to the accident. At the hearing Applicant stated that she was found
guilty of DUI, fined, and she served 24 hours in jail. (Tr. 45-47; GE 6)
Applicant  testified  that  she  had  a  cordial  relationship  with  her  ex-husband  until
about 2015. At that time, he announced that he had military orders to move to  another
state for about a year. He and his current wife would take their recreational vehicle (RV)
and requested that the youngest daughter stay with them. Applicant refused to relinquish
custody of their youngest daughter, and in retaliation, he filed for full custody for their two
youngest daughters. She was in court frequently and the custody battle was contentious.
She started drinking alcohol more frequently during this time period while her life was very
stressful.  For  several  years  she  took  prescribed  antidepressant  medication  while
consuming  alcohol.  The  first  time  she  considered  that  she  may  have  a  problem  with
alcohol,  occurred  after  she  was  arrested  for  her  first  DUI  in  2015.  She  continued  to
consume  alcohol,  in  violation  of  her  probation  and  against  medical  advice,  until  June
2017, when she was arrested for her third DUI. (Tr. 36-39, 70, 75-76, 87-89)
Applicant stated that she voluntarily admitted herself to an alcohol treatment center
after her third DUI arrest. The medical records disclosed Applicant’s self-reported alcohol
and prescription drug history. She began using alcohol at age 15. Her primary choice of
alcohol was beer, vodka, and wine. She last used alcohol on the day of her admission,
July 14, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., after drinking 10 shooters (shots of liquor). She reported to
personnel that she is unable to stop using alcohol without help. It also disclosed that her
drinking pattern consisted of drinking 10 to 20 shooters while on binges, about one day a
week for the last ten years. She enrolled into inpatient treatment for substance abuse in
2016, but she was released after staying a few days because her insurance would not
cover the cost of treatment. She had experienced alcohol-related blackouts, emotional
problems,  family  problems,  marital  conflict,  and  legal  problems  from  abusing  alcohol.
Applicant was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder Severe, and Sedative Use Disorder
Severe. She was discharged from the treatment facility on August 11, 2017. During the
hearing, Applicant stated that the alcohol treatment center’s diagnosis was questionable
since the facility coded her with a serious diagnosis in an effort to have her insurance
cover  her  inpatient  treatment.  She  stated  the  facility  took  “creative  license”  with  the
medical diagnosis. Applicant denied that all of the information was reported accurately in
her  medical  records.  She  completed  six  months  of  outpatient  treatment  following  her
discharge (¶ 1.f).  (GE 2; Tr. 48-50, 59, 72-74, 82)
Applicant relapsed after consuming alcohol at a 2019 Christmas party. She drank
two  glasses  of  wine  with  dinner.  She  was  disappointed  in  herself  for  drinking  alcohol
because she had to start her sobriety clock all over again. Her husband was also upset
with her for drinking alcohol. She did not return to alcohol treatment or AA meetings. She
said she does not need any assistance to maintain sobriety, and she has made many
positive changes to live a healthier lifestyle. (GE 2; AE H; Tr. 51-55)
Applicant  provided  an  independent  alcohol  abuse  evaluation  from  a  licensed
clinical  social  worker  (LCSW),  and  certified  substance  abuse  counselor  (CSAC).  The
professional evaluator listed on her resume “specializing in security clearance evaluations
and  mental  health  treatment  for  federal  government  employees  and  contractors.”  As
previously stated, this report and the enclosures were the basis for the motion in limine
filed by Department Counsel. My review of these documents will be limited as indicated
previously. (GE H, GE I)
The  alcohol  evaluation  took  place  on  March  11,  2022,  via  live  video  feed,  and
involved standardized testing and a one-on-one personal interview. The report noted that
in  1996,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),
depression, and anxiety. This diagnosis has continued throughout her life. She has been
prescribed various medications over the years to treat her conditions. In 2015, Applicant
experienced  excessive  stressors  after  she  and  her  ex-husband  became  involved  in  a
combative custody lawsuit, and she drank alcohol to relieve the tension. It was during this
time she was arrested for her first DUI in 2015. She stated that she was wearing “very
high” heeled shoes and failed the sobriety tests. She completed all the requirements for
the diversion program successfully.
For the second DUI, Applicant admitted that had a few drinks at a friend’s house.
After leaving her friend’s house, she called her husband to pick her up because she was
aware that she should not be driving. She was arrested for DUI only after she admitted to
the police officer that she had consumed alcoholic drinks with her friend. Her diversion
was extended an additional year. The third DUI occurred because Applicant had to move
her  daughter’s  car  to  make  room  for  a  basketball  game.  Unbeknownst  to  her  or  her
daughter, her ex-husband had a “tracker” placed on the car. The stepmother called and
asked the daughter why she was driving the car  and the daughter apparently reported
that her mother had moved the car. The stepmother called police to report that Applicant
was illegally driving the car. The police arrived, and Applicant admitted to having two to
four glasses of wine prior to moving the car. She was arrested for DUI, she lost her driver’s
license,  and  was  required  to  install  an  interlock  device  on  her  car  once  her  driving
privileges were restored. There was no indication that the evaluator had any corroborating
information, to include any of the police reports, and the only source of information used
in the evaluation was supplied solely by Applicant.
The mental health professional wrote in the evaluation report:
“…It should be noted that when patients first enter treatment they may  well
be   diagnosed   with   a   higher  level  of  disorder,  as   was  the   case   with   Ms.
(omitted)  when   she   entered   [alcohol   treatment].  Often   the   scale   used
includes a  DUI or evidence  of  interactions with  the  law. However, it should
be   noted   that  a   diagnosis  upon   entry   to   treatment  is  not  a   static  event.
Treatment,   education,   spiritual  healing,  psychotherapy,  community,  and
engagement  in   a   healthy   lifestyle  will  adjust   the   diagnosis  accordingly.”
There  was  no   indication   that  the   evaluator  had   corroborating   information
from  [the  alcohol treatment center] or a  professional medical publication  to
support her opinion. (AE H)
The  evaluator  noted  that  Applicant  had  remained  sober  from  July  2017  to
December  2019  before  her  relapse.  Applicant  regretted  the  relapse  and  made  a
commitment  to  never  do  so  again.  The  evaluator  diagnosed  Applicant  with  moderate
alcohol  use  disorder,  in  remission.  It  was  her  professional  opinion  that  if  Applicant
continued with daily spiritual practices, attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,
and continued engagement of a healthy lifestyle, Applicant had a very good prognosis for
the future. (AE H, AE I)
Personal Achievements and Recognition:
Applicant  submitted  a  September  2007  e-mail  from  a  branch  chief  who  lauded
Applicant’s accomplishments with a challenging work project, and recommended her for
a bonus due to her outstanding efforts. Applicant also submitted a March 2015 certificate
of appreciation from the Intelligence, Surveillance, & Reconnaissance Integration for her
exemplary support. There was a photograph of Applicant receiving a CSC award, possibly
the 2010 winner of the CSC President’s Award, as listed in her resume. (AE D, AE E)

Criminal Conduct and Sexual Behavior
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  in  October  2007,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
Enticement  of  Child  by  Adult  and  Furnishing  Pornographic  Material  to  a  Minor.  In
February  2012,  he  was  convicted  of  Attempted  Enticement  of  a  Child,  a  felony,  and
sentenced to five years in prison. He was incarcerated from February 2012 to January
2017. He was required to register as a sex offender. SOR ¶ 2.a cross alleges the same
information as in SOR ¶ 1.a.
Applicant admitted that he was convicted and sentenced as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a;
however, he asserted he was factually innocent of the charge of Attempted Enticement
of Child by Adult because he believed the alleged victim, Kiki (not her actual name), was
over the age of 18. The age of a child in the State statute is defined as being under the
age of  15 years. The person Applicant attempted to entice for sex was an undercover
police officer posing as a child.
The  police  report states that Applicant  viewed  Kiki’s profile  on  the  Internet, and  her
profile  indicates she  is  12  years old.1  Applicant looked  for her picture on  her profile, but
claimed  he  did not  notice  her age  on  the  profile. (Tr.  67; GE  5  at 18) There was no  picture
on  her profile.  On  October 28,  2007,  Applicant contacted  Kiki, who  informed  him  that she
was 12  years old.  After  she  sent  him a picture  of her face, Applicant said she  looked  like
she  was 18  years old, and  Kiki  responded  that she  is 12 and  will be  13  in March.2  (GE 5
at 14;  AE  SS  at .pdf 44) Applicant  told  Kiki  that  she  was 18  years old,  and  Kiki  agreed
with  him. Id. at .pdf 17, 44.  The  police  officer posing  as Kiki  “repeated  several more times
throughout the  chat that [Kiki] was twelve-years-old.” (GE 5  at 15)  Applicant told Kiki  that
he  could  see  her  as  long  as  she  is  18  years old,  and  Kiki  responded  “12   going   on   18,
right.”  (AE   SS   at  19,  44)   Applicant   responded   “Eighteen   right?   So   if   [you’re]   eighteen,
would,  could have  all  kinds of  fun.” (Id.) Kiki  responded  “Yep.” (Id.) Applicant said,  “Is that
what you want?”, and  Kiki  said, “Yep.” (Id.)
Applicant said Kiki was gorgeous and asked if she liked older men. He asked for
pictures of her, and he called her again on October 29, 2007. The State appellate court
reviewing the case for factual sufficiency noted, “When  [Applicant] talked about sexual
intercourse with [Kiki], she expressed concern that he would tell her mother and she would
get  into  trouble.  Such  references  could  lead  a  reasonable  juror  to  conclude  that
[Applicant] believed he was communicating with a twelve-year-old girl.” (GE 5 at 15)
Applicant  agreed  over  the  telephone  to  meet  Kiki  at  a  bowling  alley.  When  the
police  arrested  Applicant,  they  asked  him  why  he  was  at  the  bowling  alley,  and  he
responded, “I think  you  know why I am  here.”3  When the police officer asked him if he
was  there  to  meet  Kiki  for  sex,  he  responded  by  nodding  his  head  up  and  down  and
1 Unless stated otherwise, the information in this paragraph and the next paragraph is from the police report
pertaining to Applicant’s arrest on October 29, 2007. (GE 4 at 6) Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8),
“court records and police reports, are presumed to be reliable by virtue of the government agency’s duty
for accuracy and the high probability that it has satisfied that duty.” ISCR Case No. 16-03603 at 4 (citing
United States v. Carter, 591 F.3d 656, 659 (D.C. Cir. 2010); ISCR Case No. 11-075095, n.3 (App. Bd. Jun.
25, 2013)). Of course, the documents can still be challenged for accuracy, and other reasons, and such
challenges go to their weight not their admissibility.
2 Applicant agreed that the police report in this instance accurately reflected his question and her response.
(Tr. 66-67)
3 Applicant agreed that the police report accurately reflected his conversation with the police when he was
arrested, except for the part about his disclosure that he had condoms in his vehicle. (Tr. 74-75)
stating “Yeah. And I’m going to lose my job over this. I work for DOD and my work is going
to kill me.”  Applicant informed the police that he brought condoms for the meeting, and
they were in his vehicle.
At  his  DOHA  hearing,   Applicant  said  he   went  to   chat  rooms  for  companionship
because  he  was having  difficulties in  his  marriage. (Tr.  61-62) He  met Kiki  in  an  adult  chat
room. (Tr. 51) He said Kiki  sent him  a  picture, and  she  looked  like  she  was 26  to  28  years
old.  (Tr. 53) They  discussed  oral sex, and  he  believed  this conversation  was an  indication
Kiki   was  over  18.   (Tr.   68)   For  example,   he   asked   her  if  she   ever  swallowed   semen
because he  suspected  she  was lying  to  him. (Tr. 68) He  said  he  sent  her a  picture of his
penis and  asked  her to  send  pictures of  her genitals once  he  was convinced  she  was over
the  age  of  18  because  he  was upset  that  she  was lying  to  him. (Tr. 69-70;  GE  5  at  17) He
said  he   believed   she   was  over  the   age   of  18.   (Tr.   64)  The   first   phone   call   was  brief
because  she  said  her  mom  was coming. (Tr. 53)  He  said  she  gave  her age  as 12,  13, 14,
and  15. (Tr. 53) He did  not cite  a  page  in the  record of  chats showing  she  said she  was
15.  He pursued  the  relationship because  he  was curious and  wanted  to  “figure out who
[she] was.” (Tr. 54) He  said that when  he  got  to  the  bowling  alley, he  received  a  phone
call  and  he  asked  her  “I just  want to  confirm  you’re  over 18,  correct?” (Tr. 54)  He claimed
that she  replied  “yes” and  hung  up  the  phone. (Tr. 54) Seconds later the  police  arrested
him. (Tr. 54)
Applicant was convicted by a jury, contrary to his pleas, of Attempted Enticement
of a Child, a felony, and sentenced by the judge to five years in prison. (Tr. 50, 59) To
establish Attempted Enticement of a Child, “the State was required to prove [Applicant]
took  a  substantial  step  towards  enticing  [Kiki]  for  the  purpose  of  engaging  in  sexual
conduct with her.” (GE 5 at 17) He was acquitted of Furnishing Pornographic Material to
a Minor (Tr. 50), possibly because the police officer who was posing was a child was not
a  minor.  He  did  not  testify  at  his  trial  based  on  advice  of  his  counsel.  (Tr.  55-56)  He
appealed  his conviction  based  on  ineffective  assistance of  counsel,  instructional error,
factual sufficiency, and other issues. (Tr. 56; GE 5 at 14) He provided statements from
experts on sex offenses, chat rooms, and people posing as others on the Internet. (AE
SS)  He  also  provided evidence  from  mental-health  practitioners  about  pedophilia.  (AE
SS) The State appellate court addressed several allegations of error, and concluded, “the
State was not required to prove that [Applicant] knew or reasonably believed that [Kiki]
was under the age of fifteen.” (GE 5 at 14) Nevertheless, “If the instruction had required
the  jury  to  find  that  [Applicant]  knew,  or  reasonably  believed,  that  the  person  he  was
communicating with was younger than fifteen, there was ample evidence for the jury to
make  that  finding.  [Applicant]  was  therefore  not  prejudiced  by  the  omission  of  that
requirement, even if it was an element of the offense.” Id. at 15.
The State appellate court noted that the jury could infer that Applicant believed he
was communicating with a 12-year-old girl because of Applicant’s
continued  requests  to  have  [Kiki]  state  that  she  was  eighteen,  his
acknowledgement on at least one occasion that she had stated her age as
younger  than  eighteen,  his  concerns  about  [Kiki]  being  an  undercover
officer,  his  attempt  to  leave  the  bowling  alley  when  police  officers
approached his car, and by his statements made after he was arrested that
evidenced  a  consciousness  that  he  had  been  caught  engaging  in  illegal
activity.  (GE 5 at 15)
Applicant registered as a sex offender, and he is not on probation. (Tr. 51, 60) He
denied that he intended to have sex with a child. (Tr. 57)  He denied that he had other
instances where he sex-related conversations with minors. (Tr. 78)
The  State  appellate  court  addressed  several  assignments  of  error,  including  a
claim  the  evidence  was  insufficient  to  prove  that  Applicant  is  guilty  of  Attempted
Enticement of a Child. The State appellate court assessed the evidence “in the light most
favorable  to  the  verdict,”  concluded  that  evidence  showed  Applicant  believed  he  was
communicating with a child under the age of 15, and denied Applicant’s appeal. (GE 5 at
6, 19) Next, Applicant filed for habeas relief as he was incarcerated.  A U.S. magistrate
wrote a memorandum on behalf of a U.S. district court, reviewed  the  case  “in  the  light
most  favorable  to  the  verdict,”  agreed  with  the  State  appellate  court’s  discussion  of
knowledge of the age of the victim, and denied his writ of habeas corpus. (AE SS at 127,
141-142, 192)

for 52 years. (Tr. 24) He provided reports dated January 30, 2017, and January 19, 2022,
and  his  resume.  (Tr.  18;  AE  X;  AE  QQ;  AE  RR)  He  reviewed  Applicant’s  exhibits,  the
SOR, the record of trial, medical and psychiatric records, and he interviewed Applicant
four times. (Tr. 20-21, 28; AE X at 1-2) He did not interview Applicant after 2017, and he
did not review the police reports concerning Applicant’s arrest in October 2007. (Tr. 28,
32)
Applicant told  Dr. Cline  that he  was suspicious that Kiki  was not really  a  12-year-
old,  and  the  reason  he  communicated  with  her was “to  expose  her  to  the  fact  that she
was misrepresenting  herself.” (Tr.  36) He  is or was a  curious person, and  he  wanted  to
confront  her  about   the   truth   about  being   “so   knowledgeable   about   adult  life   and   adult
sexual behavior that she  is trying  to  harass [him] or pull  [him] into  this.”  (Tr. 26, 45) He
planned to see an adult  woman later the evening he was arrested. (Tr. 37)
Dr. Cline  concluded  that Applicant is credible  and  truthful.  (Tr.  24) Applicant “did
not have  evil  intent towards performing  sexual activity  with  a  12-year-old girl.” (Tr. 21; AE
X)  He did not believe  the  person  he  was meeting  was a  child. (Tr. 21; AE  X) He concluded
Applicant was really  not guilty  of  the  charge  of enticement of  a  child. (Tr. 24)  In  2017, Dr.
Cline   diagnosed   Applicant  as  suffering   from   post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),
anxiety,  and   depression.  Applicant  described   “five   distinctive   near-death   experiences”
that  could  have  been  the  source of  his PTSD  while  Applicant  was in  the  Air  Force: (1) a
plane  crash  landing  in which Applicant was not injured  and  one  person  received  a  head
injury;  (2) one  of  his subordinates discovered  an  unexploded  mine  in Bosnia; (3) Applicant
was in the vicinity of an explosion which killed one  person and injured  another  in Bosnia;
(4) a  plane  crash  in his vicinity  in Bosnia  resulted  in  a  death, and  (5) someone  discovered
an  unexploded  roadside  bomb  in Bosnia. (AE  X  at 8-9) The  most recent incident was in
1996. Id. Dr. Cline  believed  Applicant did  not  meet the  diagnostic criteria  for pedophile,
and  he  concluded PTSD caused  Applicant to  act as he  did  with  Kiki  on  October 30, 2007.
(Tr. 22-23; AE  X  at 13;  AE  QQ) He  said  there was no  recurrence  of the  incident of  October
30, 2007, and  he  predicted  it would not recur  in the  future. (Tr. 23-24) Dr. Cline  did not
discuss with  Applicant details of  Applicant’s interaction  with  the  police  officer posing  as a
12-year-old  child   as  described   in  the   police   report.   (Tr.  35)  Dr.  Cline   recommended
approval of  Applicant’s access to classified information. (Tr. 45)
In 2017, Dr. Cline recommended that Applicant seek counseling for PTSD. (Tr. 75;
AE X at 13) Applicant had a couple of telephone conversations with Dr. Cline over the
last  five  years;  however,  he  has  not  received  any  counseling  for  mental-health  issues
since meeting with Dr. Cline in 2017. (Tr. 58, 75) He decided to seek counseling at the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); however, he had not received any counseling. (Tr.
75-76)
Character Evidence
Applicant  received  excellent  performance  evaluations  while  serving  in  the  Air
Force from 1992 to 1996 and working for a government contractor. (Tr. 49; AE A-AE E,
R,  AE  CC-AE  FF)  He  received  a  Joint  Service  Commendation  Medal,  Defense
Meritorious Service Medal, and NATO Medal for service in Operation Endeavor in Bosnia.
(AE G-AE I) He received a cash bonus and five percent increase in pay in 2018 and 2019,
a cash bonus and three percent increase in pay in 2020, and a 5.7 percent pay increase
and a cash bonus in 2021. (AE CC, AE DD; AE EE, AE FF)
Applicant received 11 letters of recommendation from coworkers and friends. (AE
GG-AE LL; AE PP) The general sense of the recommendations is that Applicant shows
professionalism,  honesty,  integrity,  sincerity,  trustworthiness,  diligence,  reliability,  and
humility. He is thoughtful, patriotic, courteous, and gracious. Their letters support approval
of his access to classified information. He is in a long-term relationship with a woman he
has known since high school. (AE HH) She has reviewed the legal documents in his case
and is aware of the allegations against him. Id. She has employment assisting victims of
sexual assault. Id.
Applicant said:
I had  an  impeccable  career for mostly  30  years. I’ve  been  a  true  patriot.  I’ve
always  tried   to   do   the   right  thing.  I’ve   loved   my   country.  I’ve   been   put  in
situations where I almost lost  my  life  for my  country. I want to  continue  to
contribute   to   the   success  of   my   company   in  supporting   our  federal
Department of Defense clients that we have. (Tr. 86)

"Applicant  is  38  years  old  and  has  never  been  married.  He  has  no  children.  He
graduated  from  high  school  in  2001.  He  has  worked  for  Federal  contractors  as  an
electronics technician since 2008. He wants to continue his education to prepare himself
for future responsibilities. He was granted a security clearance in 2009 and now seeks to
renew his clearance eligibility in relation to his employment. Without a clearance, he can
continue with his current employer, but his progress and opportunities at the company
would be limited. (Tr. at 39, 44-45.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline J,  Criminal Conduct
The Government alleges, in this paragraph, six incidents involving criminal conduct
by  Applicant  over  the  period  March  2006  to  August  2020.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
admitted each  of  the allegations,  but  in  two  instances  he also  denied  part  of  the  SOR
allegations. The specific details are as follows:
1.a. March 2006  traffic  citations  –   seat belt and no insurance.  On  March 10,
2006, Applicant was cited for two  driving  violations. He was 23  years old at the  time  and
was living  at his home  with  his mother. In  April 2006, he  pled  to  both  charges  and  was
fined   $85  for  the   seat  belt  violation   and  $1,040  for the   insurance   violation.  In   addition,
Applicant  failed   to   pay   the   assessed   fine   and   a   warrant   was  issued   in   July   2006.   In
October   2006,  the   court  set  aside   the   guilty   plea   and   fine   for   the   insurance   violation.
Applicant   paid  the   remaining   fine   in   full   on   November  27,  2006.   Applicant  presented
evidence  at the  hearing  showing  that he  now has  insurance  for his  vehicle.  He admitted
that he  acted  immaturely  at that time. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 15-17, 47; GE  9; Answer Ex. 5-
8; AE A.)
1.b. May  2008  possession of  marijuana  and driving an unregistered vehicle.
On  May  4,  2008,  Applicant  was  charged  with  drug  possession  and  operating  an
unregistered vehicle. In the summary of his background interview, Applicant is reported
as stating that the original drug charge was for a felony. The Government’s court records
reflect  that  this  charge  was  for  a  misdemeanor,  however,  no  police  records  were
submitted into evidence to permit a review of the original charge by the police. On June
17,  2008,  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  misdemeanor  marijuana  possession  and  was  fined.
Applicant testified that he no longer uses drugs and he does not  drink alcohol. His last
use of marijuana was in about 2008. He prefers to have a clear, focused mental condition.
He knows that marijuana use is legal under laws of the state in which he resides (State
1), but he also understands that Federal law and his work for the Federal Government
prohibit his use of marijuana. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 17-18, 46-47; GE 4 at 2; GE 8 at 1-4.)
1.c. January  2013  domestic  battery  arrest. Applicant admits he was arrested on
this charge, but he denies the underlying allegation of domestic battery. He had a physical
altercation with his then-girlfriend (Woman A) during an argument outside of a club, which
was observed by a police officer. In an affidavit, Woman A wrote that Applicant violently
pushed her. Applicant blames this arrest on a “toxic relationship” he had with the victim,
which he claimed was due to her mental illness. Applicant admitted both he and Woman
A  were  intoxicated  at  the  time  of  his  arrest.  He  testified  that  no  charges  were  filed.
Applicant and Woman A started dating in 2012 and separated in 2016. Applicant testified
that he has never had an issue of domestic abuse with any woman before or after the
one involved in this incident. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 18-19, 47-50; GE 2 at 4; GE 7 at 10.)
1.d. September 2016  restraining order due  to  domestic  violence. On July 18,
2016, Woman A obtained a temporary court restraining order for protection from Applicant
based upon her claims that applicant had physically abused her. Applicant believes that
she initiated the proceedings against him because he had terminated their relationship.
He testified that he was surprised that she sought the court order because he had never
been violent with her. The woman claimed in her court papers that she sought to leave
him and he reacted violently towards her. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied that he
had  ever  been  violent  with  her,  but  admitted  that  “we  [did]  tussle  together.”  The  court
papers were served on Applicant on August 15, 2016. A preliminary court date had been
continued on August 4, 2016, because Applicant had not been served at that time. The
SOR alleges that Applicant evaded service of the restraining order. This allegation was
based upon court papers reflecting five unsuccessful attempts to serve the court papers
on Applicant at his residence in State 1. In his Answer, Applicant admitted that the court
entered a restraining order against him, but he denies that he evaded service. He claimed
he was not aware of the order until it was served.  The restraining order was ultimately
dismissed on October 20, 2020, at the request of Woman A. (Answer at 2-3; Tr. at 19-20,
50-54, 61-64; GE 7 at 44, 49; Answer Ex. 1.)
1.e. May  2016  driving  citations  –   no  valid license  and tire  violation. Applicant
was issued a citation on March 14, 2016, He was ordered to appear in court on May 9,
2016 to respond to these charges.  He failed to appear in court. He finally appeared in
court on November 1, 2016. He pled guilty to failure to appear, and the driving infractions
were dismissed. He was fined $100 and was ordered to pay the fine in installments of
$35 per month commencing on December 1, 2016. Applicant failed to appear in court on
December  1,  2016,  to  pay  the  first  installment  of  the  fine  and  a  civil  assessment  was
ordered. Applicant testified that he was working in another state for an extended period
of time and upon his return to State 1, he resolved the citation. He began paying the fine
in January 2018 and finished paying it in October 2018. He was unable to explain why he
did not have a valid driver’s license at the time of the citation. He described generally that
his driver’s  license  had  been  suspended  at some  time  due  to his failures  to appear in
court. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 21-23, 54-56; GE 6 at 3-6; Answer Ex. 2-4.)
1.f. August 2019  – traffic  citation for  speeding (86/65).
On October 22, 2019,
Applicant failed to appear in court to respond to a speeding citation. The court docket in
the record reflects that he failed to appear in court again on November 7, 2019, February
11,  2020,  and  August  14,  2020.  The  docket  also  shows  that  he  appeared  in  court  on
February 21, 2020, and pled  not guilty. Applicant claims that he appeared at the initial
court hearing and requested a trial. He went to court for the trial and the courthouse was
closed due to the COVID pandemic. He testified that he never heard further about a court
date. His employer subsequently relocated him to State 2 for an extended period of time
to manage a project. He claimed he was unaware of  the warrant until he received the
SOR. He wrote in his Answer that he intends to go to court and address the citation and
warrant. As of December 30, 2020, the amount of the unpaid fine was $882. At the DOHA
hearing, he provided evidence of payment of the fine in the amount of $1,010 on May 23,
2022, a week before the hearing. Applicant testified that he now understands that he can
hire an attorney to represent him in any future legal problems and avoid  missing court
dates when he is away from home due to his work responsibilities. He admitted that he
had been irresponsible missing the November 2019 court date. (Answer 3; Tr. at 23-25,
56-59; GE 5 at 1-3; AE C.)
Paragraph 2  - Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because of his unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, raising questions about
his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. The
SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  as
required for tax years (TYs) 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (SOR 2.a). The SOR also alleges
that  Applicant failed  to pay his State 1 fine  and  penalties  in  connection  with  the  traffic
citation alleged in SOR 1.f (SOR 2.b). The specific details are as follows:
2.a.  Failure   to   timely   file   Federal  and  state  taxes.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
admitted that he failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2016 and
2018 through 2020 in a timely manner. He asserted that the returns have now been filed.
At the hearing, Applicant explained that his failures to file his returns was “mostly” due to
his  work-related  travel  schedule  for  extended  periods  of  time.  His  exhibits  include
unsigned copies of his Federal tax returns for TY 2018 and 2020 that were prepared by
a  tax  professional.  The  TY  2018  return  is  undated  and  reflects  a  balance  due  in  the
amount of $3,792 and the TY 2020 return reflects a refund due to Applicant in the amount
of $731. The TY 2020 tax return is dated July 14, 2021, which would have been about
two  months  late  in  the  absence  of  an  extension  to  file  past  the  due  date,  which  was
extended  to  May  17,  2021,  for  that  tax  year  due  to  the  COVID  pandemic.  Applicant
provided no documentary evidence that he filed for an extension in 2021. He testified that
the  other  tax  returns  were  filed  in  about  September  2021,  after  he  received  the  SOR.
Given  the  limited  information  in  the  record, counsel  for the  Government  and  Applicant
stipulated to Applicant’s testimony that his tax returns for TYs 2016, 2018-2020 were filed,
but they were not filed on time. Applicant testified that he intends to file his returns in a
timely manner in the future using the services of a tax professional. (Answer at 4; Tr. at
26, 64-; GE 2 at 5; AE D through I.)
Applicant testified further that he entered into a payment plan  in 2021 to pay his
Federal tax debt of about $4,000 for TY 2018.  He pays the Federal Government about
$200  per  month.  He  also  had  a  tax  liability  to  State  1  for  the  same  year.  The  state
garnished his wages to collect that debt. He has now fully paid the state tax debt. With
interest and penalties, his total Federal and state tax debt for 2018 was about $9,000.
This liability arose due to Applicant withdrawing funds from his 401k account in 2018 to
pay off a car loan and a credit card. (Tr. at 69-74.)
2.b.  Failure  to  pay  State 1  fine and penalties.  Applicant asserted in his Answer
that he has retained an attorney to address the underlying infraction and fine. As noted in
the discussion of the facts surrounding SOR 1.f, above, Applicant provided evidence that
he paid this fine of about $1,000 on May 23, 2022, shortly before the hearing date of June
1, 2022. He testified that he did not pay this fine earlier because he was unaware of it
prior to receiving the SOR. (Answer at 4; Tr. at 73-74; GE 5 at 2; AE C.)
Paragraph 3  - Guideline  E, Personal Conduct
The Government cross-alleges in this paragraph all of the allegations set forth in
paragraphs  1  and  2  of  the  SOR.  The  SOR  states  that  conduct  involving  questionable
judgment or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations raises questions about
an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive
information. In his Answer, Applicant denied that his personal conduct demonstrates an
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. (Answer at 4.)
Mitigation
The Director of Operations of Applicant’s employer and security clearance sponsor
provided  a  strong  character  reference  praising  Applicant’s  reliability  and  good  moral
character. The character reference described Applicant as “dependable, responsible, and
honest.” (Tr. at 12; AE J.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  February
2022.  He  manages  large  and  important  contracts  for  one  of  the  U.S.  military  services
installing technical equipment, which requires experience, skills, scheduling, and project
planning. He worked for his prior employer for about three years and another employer
for about ten years before that. Both of his prior jobs and his current employment involved
the same type of Defense Department contract work. In his last job, he lived and worked
in State 2. Starting in about 2019 he began working as a team lead, and more recently
he managed about 30 technicians. Applicant worked ten or more hours a day, six days a
week. He was voted “Employee of the Year.” His good work for that company opened the
opportunity he has with his current employer. In his new job, he will be managing a team
of  about  60  technicians.  Applicant  is  a  relatively  young  person  to  have  so  much
responsibility. In his new position as a manager, he has more responsibility and his pay
is accordingly higher. Over the years, his hourly pay rate has increased from $14.50 to
about $45. His new position also requires him to work long hours with much overtime. His
income increased to well over $100,000 in 2021. (Tr. at 27-37, 42-43.)
The Defense Department contracts on which Applicant works often require him to
be on site in another state for long periods of  time. As a result, when he is residing in
State 1, he lives with his mother. He testified that this situation was the main reason why
he missed court dates and did not file his taxes in a timely manner. He also admitted that
he has been irresponsible in the past, but claims that behavior has changed. He believes
that  he  has  shown  “tremendous  growth  since  those  situations  [alleged  in  the  SOR]
happen[ed]. They have all been taken care of. And they are all things that will not occur
again.” (Tr. at 28-36, 76.)
Applicant has learned from his employment the importance of planning and taking
care of both his work requirements and those of his personal life. He realizes he can no
longer afford to be irresponsible in his handling of his personal affairs. He claims he is
now much more responsible than he has ever been. He understands that the four most
recent incidents listed under Guideline J, and both of the financial issues alleged under
Guideline  F,  arose  while  he  held  a  security  clearance.  His  receipt  of  the  SOR  has
prompted him to reexamine how he has handled his taxes and other legal responsibilities.
Applicant understands that he has a highly supportive attorney who has known him since
his childhood and is available to take care of any legal problems Applicant encounters.
Applicant now also has a tax professional to file his income tax returns every year in a
timely fashion. Applicant’s 2021 tax returns were filed prior to the filing deadline  in April
2022.  He  also  commented  that  he  has  not  been  arrested  or  given  a  citation  since  the
2019 speeding incident. (Tr. at 29-38, 59.)
Applicant is determined to avoid repeating the tumultuous relationship he had with
Woman A for four years (2012 to 2016). He is now in a stable relationship with a woman
he  wants  to  marry.  He  and  his  girlfriend  plan  to  raise  a  family  together.  She  has  a
doctorate degree in physical therapy. They presently have no difficult relationship issues,
but they are engaged in counseling to help them learn to communicate better and avoid
issues that can be disruptive to their relationship. He now invests his money rather than
going out with his friends. He has a good credit score. Applicant and his girlfriend look
forward to buying a house one day. (Tr. at 38-41.)
",False
"Applicant  is  55  years  old  and  has  married  and  divorced  twice.  His  most  recent
divorce was in 2015. He has no children. He served in the U.S. Navy for twenty years
(1992 to 2012) and received an Honorable discharge. He graduated from high school in
1986 and earned a bachelor’s degree in 2014. At the time of the hearing, Applicant was
attending classes to earn a certification. He works for a Defense Department contractor
as  a  mechanic.  He  is  a  first-time  applicant  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in
relation to his employment. (Tr. at 24-25, 28; GE 1 at 7, 21-22, 24-25, 28; AE C.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline E, Personal Conduct
In  paragraph  1  of  the  SOR,  the  Government  listed  three  allegations  under
Guideline E and asserted a fourth allegation in the Amendment. The first allegation is that
Applicant’s employment with Company A was involuntarily terminated in 2016 for violating
company policy, which prohibited dating active duty military personnel (SOR 1.a). In his
Answer,  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation.  The  second  is  that  his  employment  with
Company B  was  involuntarily terminated  in October 2017 for threatening  gun  violence
against a co-worker, who worked for Company C (SOR 1.b). He admitted this allegation
though  he  explained  that  no  guns  were  involved.  The  third  is  that  in  November  2017
Company  C  obtained  a  court  restraining  order  prohibiting  Applicant  from  having  any
contact with employees of Company C for three years (SOR 1.c). In his Answer, Applicant
admitted  this  allegation.  In  the  Amendment  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant
deliberately falsified his response to a question in Section 22 about his criminal record by
failing to disclose the November 2017 criminal charges against Applicant arising out of
the workplace threat incident alleged in SOR 1.b (SOR 1.d).
The details of the personal conduct issues raised in the SOR are the following:
1.a   Applicant  disclosed   in  his  e-QIP   that  his  employment  with   Company   A   was
terminated  in May  2016  because  he  had  a  relationship with  an  active  duty  military  member
working   in  the   same   command   as   Applicant,   which  was  against   the   employer’s  policy.
Applicant was working  on  a  military  base  as a  civilian. He testified  that he  was unaware
of such a policy at that  time.  The Commanding Officer of the  base  asked  his employer to
terminate   Applicant   for  his  actions.  Applicant  testified   that   the   woman   involved   was
divorced. He claimed  at the  hearing  that he  only  “saw  her a  couple of  times.” He provided
inconsistent  information   about   her  marital  status  and   the   length   and   nature  of  their
relationship  in his background interview. (Tr. at 29-31; GE  1 at 18-19; GE 2  at 9-10.)
1.b Applicant was fired  from  his next job  in October 2017. He testified  that a  co-
worker had  loudly  made  an  insulting  sexual comment about Applicant’s mother in an  open
space   of  their   workplace   in   front  of  others,  including   his  supervisor  and   a   U.S.
Government  client.   Applicant  was  unable   to   explain   why   the   co-worker  would  publicly
insult him  in  that way. Applicant reacted  angrily  and  made  a  threatening  comment  about
a   gun   and   walked   off   the   job,  which  was  located   on   a   military   base   where  a   third
contractor,   Company   C,  operated.  As   he   was  leaving,  he   made   a   pointed-finger  hand
gesture at the  employee  of Company  C  who  insulted  him  as  though  he  was firing  a  gun.
He admitted  at the  hearing  that  he  also  made  a  comment  suggesting  that he  was going
to  get  his  guns.  He  explained  further  that  he  responded  to  the  co-worker by  saying  “I’d
like  to  go  get a  gun  and  go  shooting.” He testified, however,  that he  does not own  any
guns.   He   was  later questioned  by   law   enforcement   about   pictures   on   his   social  media
page   in  which  he   was  depicted   with   guns.  He  insisted   that  the   people  who   heard  his
comments took them  “the  wrong  way.” He was terminated  the  same  day. (Tr. at 31-36,
56-58; GE  1 at 17-18.)
1.c  On  October  31,  2017,  Company  C  brought  a  civil  lawsuit  against  Applicant
seeking a restraining order. The lawsuit was based upon the comments Applicant made
to  the  employees  of  Company  C  earlier  that  month.  Applicant  hired  an  attorney  and
attended the hearing in November 2017. Two witnesses to the incident appeared in court
and  Company  C  took  the  position  that  its  employees  were  at  risk  of  being  harmed  by
Applicant.  The  court  issued  a  three-year  restraining  order  prohibiting  Applicant  from
having contact with Company C and four of its employees. He was also ordered to sell
any firearm he possessed to a licensed gun dealer or  to turn it or them into the police
within 24 hours. The restraining order expired in November 2020. Applicant  testified in
the  DOHA  proceeding  that  he  did  not  own  any  firearms  at  the  time  of  the  workplace
incident or at the time of the court hearing. After the court hearing, Applicant was required
to undergo a mental evaluation at a military hospital. He was accompanied by base police
and local city police officers, indicating that a criminal investigation into the incident was
ongoing. As discussed below, a criminal charge was filed in court against Applicant on
November 28, 2017. (Tr. at 50-55; GE 1 at 34; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 1-4.)
1.d  Applicant failed to the list the criminal charge filed against him in  November
2017  (discussed  in  detail  below  under  Guideline  J,  Paragraph  2.a)  in  response  to
questions in Section 22 – Police Record of his May 2019 e-QIP. The questions asked if
he  had  “been  issued  a  summons,  citation,  or  ticket  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal
proceeding against [him]” in the prior seven years and if he had been “charged, convicted,
or sentenced of a crime in any court” in the past seven years. The Government alleged
that Applicant’s omissions were deliberate. Applicant did not respond to this allegation in
the Government’s Amendment. As a result, I regard his non-response as a denial. (SOR
1.d; GE 1 at 33.)
At the hearing, Applicant at first claimed he misunderstood the  e-QIP questions.
On further examination, he testified that he was not aware of the warrant or the criminal
charge until he received the SOR. There is no evidence in the record to contradict his
testimony. In fact, the investigator’s summary of  Applicant’s multiple  interviews in 2019
(GE 2) makes no mention of any criminal citation or charge. Applicant is reported to have
discussed at length during the interview the civil restraining order court proceeding. This
exhibit  suggests  that  even  the  interviewer  was  unaware  of  the  pending  criminal
proceeding because he or she asked no questions about it. (Tr. at 37-48; GE 2 at 2-4.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleged in this single allegation that in November 2017 Applicant
was charged with the offense of Criminal Threat of Death or Great Bodily Injury and then
failed to appear in court as required. The SOR further alleged that the warrant remained
outstanding as of the date of the SOR, i.e., September 1, 2020 (SOR 2.a). In his Answer,
he admitted this allegation, but asserted that the warrant was subsequently resolved. The
details are as follows:
2.a   After  Applicant’s  October  2017  verbal  altercation  with  a  co-worker  and  his
termination from Company B, the police interviewed Applicant at his residential facility.
As  noted,  he  was  taken  to  a  hospital  for  a  mental  evaluation  in  November  2017.  On
November  28,  2017,  a  criminal  charge  was  filed  in  court  against  Applicant.  He  was
charged with the crime of Criminal Threat of Death or Great Bodily Injury. On March 15,
2018, Applicant failed to appear in court to respond to the charge and an arrest warrant
was issued on March 20, 2018. His bail was set at $15,000. He testified that he was never
advised that he had to appear in court. He clarified his testimony by stating that he was
never advised of the charge against him and he was never given a summons to appear
in court on a criminal charge. He claimed that he first learned about the warrant when he
received the SOR. He then hired an attorney, paid his bail, and received a court date. He
provided with his Answer a court document (AE D) that reflects that his attorney appeared
in court on June 3, 2021, over three years after the original court date. The exhibit also
provides that the charge filed against Applicant was as stated above. The State 1 criminal
statute  and  related  information  provided  by  the  Government  for  administrative  notice
purposes established that this charge was a misdemeanor. AE D further evidences that
he pled guilty to a different charge. Applicant testified that he pled guilty to Breach of the
Peace. He paid a fine of $149 on June 16, 2021. The arrest warrant was resolved with
his guilty plea. He testified that he has had no subsequent issues with the police. (Tr. at
37-47; GE 5 at 2-4; AN I at 1-2; AE D.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The  Government  alleged  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a
clearance  because  he  is  financially  overextended  and  therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
identifies  six  past-due  or  charged-off  debts  owed  by  Applicant  totaling  about  $35,500
(SOR  3.a  through  3.f).  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  and
provided some additional information. The Government alleged two additional debts in
the Amendment (SOR 3.g and 3.h) totaling an additional amount of about $21,000. The
existence  and  amounts  of  all  eight  debts  are  supported  by  the  Government’s  credit
reports  in  the  record,  dated  January 20,  2022;  April  23,  2020;  and  June  8,  2019.  The
current status of each of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is the following:
3.a   Auto  loan  account   charged  off  in  the   approximate   amount  of   $20,174.
Applicant’s vehicle was repossessed after he stopped paying on the auto loan due to lack
of  income. After his discharge from the Navy in 2012, Applicant was attending  college
classes full time and was living off his military pension, monthly VA disability payments,
and the GI Bill payments. He was homeless for a long period and was going through a
divorce. The debt was charged off in 2014. Applicant  has made no efforts to repay the
debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 59-62; GE 7 at 2; GE 8 at 4.)
3.b   Internet/TV  account   charged  off  in  the   approximate  amount   of   $1,530.
This debt arose for cable services provided to a house Applicant shared with a girlfriend
(Woman A) and her two children. He was deployed for three months as a civilian and sent
Woman A money every month to pay the rent and the cable bill. She used the money for
other purposes and left the bill for Applicant to pay, even though her name was on the
account. She vacated the rental property and took the cable equipment.  The debt was
charged  off  in  2014.  Applicant  has  made  no  effort  to  repay  the  debt.  This  debt  is
unresolved. (Tr. at 62-66; GE 8 at 2.)
3.c   Rental  account   in  collection  in  the   approximate   amount   of   $11,537.
Applicant  was  evicted  after Woman  A  had  vacated  the  property  they  shared.  He  was
unsure of the timing of the eviction. He explained that he and Woman A had a “bad falling
out” and he could not afford to pay the past-due rent. Applicant did not believe he should
have  to pay this entire bill for  rent since Woman A had also signed  the  lease.  He has
made no payments on the debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 64-69; GE 8 at 7.)
3.d   Cellphone   account   in  collection  in   the   approximate  amount   of   $1,664.
Applicant shared this account with Woman A. She purchased phones for her children. He
did not want to pay a bill that she should have paid. Without any documentary support,
he claimed he disputed the bill, but was unsuccessful. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at
69-71; GE 8 at 8.)
3.e  Medical account  in collection in the  approximate  amount  of  $317.  This bill
for dental services arose in 2014 or 2015. Applicant was unable to pay it at that time. In
February 2021, he paid the bill. He attached proof of payment to his Answer. This debt is
resolved. (Tr. at 71-7, 742; GE 7 at 1; GE 8 at 8; AE E.)
3.f  Medical account in collection in the approximate amount of $260. This bill
for ambulance services arose in 2014 or 2015. Applicant was unable to pay it at that time.
In February 2021, he paid the bill. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 73; GE 8 at 8.)
3.g  Loan account  charged off in the  approximate amount  of  $11,799. In April
2021 Applicant was attempting to purchase a house and borrowed funds to buy furniture
for the house. He stopped repaying the loan and is attempting to negotiate a settlement.
This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 73-77; GE 6 at 4.)
3.h  Loan account  charged off in the  approximate amount  of  $9,548. Applicant
took out this personal loan in 2021 to pay for vehicle repairs. He testified that he is trying
to  contact  the  creditor  to  make  payment  arrangements,  but  he  has  not  yet  been
successful. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 77-80; GE 6 at 4.)

"Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  aircraft  lead  mechanic,  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  April  2022,  and  was  preparing  to  deploy  to  the  United  Arab  Emirates
(UAE)  for  this  employer.  He  previously  worked  for  another  defense  contractor,  and
deployed to Iraq from November 2016 to March 2017, May to December 2017, February
to December 2018, and May 2019 to April 2020. Applicant graduated from high school in
2007,  and  has  some  college  credits.  He  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  in  July
2007, and was discharged in May 2015 with an other than honorable (OTH) discharge in
lieu of a court-martial. Applicant held a security clearance while on active duty. Applicant
was married in March 2017 and divorced in August 2020. He has one child, age seven,
who lives with the child’s mother.
The SOR alleges under Guideline J (criminal conduct) that Applicant was accused
of  violating a  USAF no-contact  order when a  girlfriend claimed he struck her and sent
over  50  text  messages  containing  verbal  attacks  and  profanities.  He  was  convicted  of
wrongfully sending text messages with  profanities, and  received  a reduction  in rank, a
fine, and a letter of reprimand. (SOR ¶ 1.a)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant was charged in 2014, while in the USAF, with
aggravated sexual contact and kidnapping, arising from a 2012 incident, and referred to
a  court-martial.  SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  Applicant  tested  positive  in  April  2015,  while  in  the
USAF, for oxycodone and oxymorhone, and in May 2015, he tested positive for cocaine.
He  was  charged  in  June  2015  with  using  prescription  medications  oxycodone  and
oxymorhone, not prescribed to him, and using cocaine. The charges were referred to a
court-martial.  SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  he  entered  into  a  plea  arrangement  in  October  2015
wherein he accepted an OTH discharge in lieu of court-martial for charges alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.b and 1.c.
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant was arrested in March 2016 in state A, and charged
with  domestic  abuse.  SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  he  was  arrested  in  state  A  in  April  2016  and
charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and driving without  a  driver’s
license. He was convicted of DUI, placed on probation, and fined. Applicant admitted the
incidents described above occurred and provided explanations, but denied that he was
guilty of most of the allegations. (Ans.)
While  Applicant  was  stationed  overseas  on  active  duty,  Applicant  dated  a  local
national woman beginning in 2009. He claimed that they were sexually active and that at
some point, she claimed she was pregnant and harassed him to marry her. In 2011, she
alleged he assaulted her and reported it to his command. As a result, he was ordered to
have  no  contact  with  her.  However,  he  claims  they  both  exchanged  numerous  text
messages  that  included  profanities  and  verbal  attacks  toward  each  other,  while  his
domestic assault case was being investigated. Applicant refused non-judicial punishment,
and  was  referred  to  a  special  court-martial.  (Tr.  26)  He  was  found  guilty  of  an  orders
violation  under  Article  92,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  for  sending  the
messages. (GE 2)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated: “I admit to violating the no contact order
by sending text messages.” He explained that he did not understand the significance of
the verbal order, and that he responded to her text messages since he was “young and
ignorant.”  (Ans.)  However,  in  testimony,  Applicant  equivocated  that  he  did  not  receive
“official  documentation” of  the  order, and at one point, stated that he  did not receive a
verbal order. In a convoluted explanation, he testified as follows:
Applicant: . . . Initially, though, however, the no contact order was not on
the official charges. And it also was initially a verbal that I, as I stated to my
first sergeant at the time, was more so of in my opinion I was told hey, by
the  way,  it  would  be  in  your  best  interest.  I  did  not  receive  any
documentation that said that I was not allowed to contact her until the day
before the court-martial was adjourned ultimately on March 4. And it was –
it was eventually – the no-contact order was put on the list of -- of you know,
I forget the word. But it was put on the list of accusation the day before. And
the reason why is because the – in my opinion, every other accusation was
completely, utterly clear to the highest point. There was no evidence, I had
proved that there was nothing. And at the end of the day, they came out
and she said, yeah, he text (sic) me. And my first sergeant said, well, I told
you not to text her. And I said, well, I was under the impression that the text
was – or that he told me, you know, be in your best interest to not. As a –
as a hey, you should keep this on, you know, keep your distance. . . .
Administrative  Judge: All  right,  [Applicant], did you  text her after you  were
–  you received an order for no  contact?
Applicant: Yes sir. Due to – based off of my first sergeant stating that he
ordered me not to, yes. However, I was not under – I did not know I was not
allowed to contract. When he stated it to me, I thought it was a verbal, hey,
by  the  way.  Because  at  the  time,  I  did  not  receive  any  documentation  to
sign. And if it was the order, I thought that at the time of him stating.
Administrative  Judge: Okay, I’m  just trying  to  understand  here. And  I’m
sure Department Counsel probably does too. Did you ever receive a verbal
order not to have any contact with her, yes or no?
Applicant: Yes.
Applicant explained that he believes he should have received a written order. (Tr. 26-30)
In  2014,  an  active  duty  female  airman  (victim)  told  a  sexual  assault  response
coordinator (SARC) in State B that Applicant sexually assaulted her in State A at his off-
base residence in 2012.  Air Force Office of  Special Investigations (AFOSI)  opened an
investigation. (GE 4) The summary report of investigation stated that the victim said that
on November 18, 2012, she exchanged playful insults via text messages with Applicant,
whom  she  knew from  previous  military training  together. She  went  to  his  residence  to
have  consensual  sex,  but  Applicant  became  angry  over  the  text  messages.  She
attempted to leave, but Applicant knocked her to the floor, pushed her face into the carpet,
and sexually penetrated her vagina with his finger. The victim threatened to kill Applicant
if he did not get off of her, and she left the residence. She broke off contact with him and
did not know if he was still in the military when she reported the incident to the SARC.
(GE 4)
The investigator contacted Mr. S, who described Applicant as his best friend until
2012 when they had a falling out due to Applicant’s involvement in a physical altercation
with the victim, who was previously engaged to Mr. S for a six-to-eight-month period. Mr.
S learned of the assault from the victim, and observed bruising and swelling on her face
after  the  incident.  He  did  not  witness  the  altercation.  Mr.  S  described  Applicant  as  an
“’alpha-male’ type, very controlling, imposing, and manipulative.” (GE 4)
The investigator interviewed Applicant, who stated that he met the victim in 2012
on an online dating application. They casually dated for months before Applicant learned
that  the  victim  was  previously  engaged  to  Mr.  S.  He  stated  that  he  broke  off  the
relationship  in  the  fall  of  2012,  but  the  victim  responded  by  going  to  his  residence
unannounced.  The  two  engaged  in  a  verbal  altercation  which  ended  when  the  victim
keyed  Applicant’s  car.  Applicant  denied  striking  her  or  engaging  in  any  sexual  activity
during the altercation.
In  his personal subject  interview  (PSI), Applicant admitted  that  he  and  the  victim
had  a  sexual relationship,  but  he  did not  have  sex  with  her  or assault her  on  the  date  she
reported  the  sexual assault.  He claimed  that the  victim  made  up  the  story  to  cover herself
with  her boyfriend  [Mr.  S],  who  learned  she  was having  consensual sex  with  Applicant.
(GE 2)  In  testimony, Applicant  stated  that  he  had  consensual  sex  with  the  victim  for about
three  months while  they  dated, but not  on  the  night she  accused  him  of sexual assault.
He  claimed  that on  that night,  he   confronted  her about her continuing  relationship with
Mr. S, her previous fiancé, and  his intent to  tell  his friend  about her.  Applicant testified
that  he   could  provide   the   victim’s  witness  statement   in  which   she   admitted   to   having
consensual sex  with  Applicant that night.   He  did not provide  the  statement in his post-
hearing  submission,  and  regardless,  Applicant  said  they  did  not  have  sex  that  night.
Rather, he provided an undated letter from Mr. S, addressed to me, claiming that:
There was a  situation  that arose  in [state  A] that was an  attempt to  smear
[Applicant’s]  name  and  demean  his character to  the  United  States Air  Force
and  the  general public. An  airman  by  the  name  of  [victim] with  whom  he  was
romantically   involved   attempted   to   manipulate   myself   and   others  into
believing  that [Applicant]  committed  serious crimes against  her. I  was asked
to  make  a  statement with  only  half  truths to  go  on, which I later redacted
once  I learned  the entire truth of the situation.
The  letter  extolls  the  “upstanding  character  and  moral  fiber”  of  Applicant,  and
attests to him being “nothing but an exemplary airman for the United States Air Force and
carry the same core values that he encompassed in the service as a civilian.” (AE A)
During the pendency of a court-martial against Applicant on these allegations, he
tested positive for oxycodone and oxymorhone in an April 2015 urinalysis, and in May
2015, he tested positive for cocaine. (GE 5) Applicant denied using any illegal drugs or
prescription  drugs  not  prescribed  to  him.  However,  he  claimed  that  he  received  a
prescription through a military pharmacy for oxycodone for a spider bite after his birthday
on March 4, 2015, implying that it resulted in his positive test, but denied knowledge of
the positive test for cocaine. (Tr. 39-40) An AFOSI report of investigation into the positive
tests,  dated  June  17,  2015,  stated  that  Applicant’s  medical  records  showed  he  was
prescribed oxycodone on March 18, 2012. The prescription expired on March 22, 2012,
three years before his positive urinalysis. (GE 5)
Applicant agreed to accept an OTH discharge in June 2015, in lieu of court-martial
on the charges of sexual assault, kidnapping, and illegal use of drugs. (GE 6) He claimed
in testimony that he agreed to the OTH because his leadership was not supporting him,
and his discharge could be upgraded after he left the military if he could prove the charges
against him were false. He has not petitioned for an upgrade of his discharge. (Tr. 40-42)
On March 1, 2016, Applicant was charged with domestic battery against a girlfriend
(victim) who would later become his spouse. (GE 7, Tr. 42-43) The police report narrative
states that they responded to a family disturbance. The police interviewed the victim at a
different residence, and she stated that she and Applicant had been dating for several
years, and have been living together for about one year. The victim complained that she
and Applicant argued because he suspected her of cheating on him. She said he grabbed
her by the neck and pulled her head up, threw items around the house, and slashed the
tires on her vehicle. She left the house because she was afraid he would hurt her again.
There were scratch marks and red spots on her neck region, extending from the right ear
to the middle of the neck. She reported that he was at her mother’s residence. The police
interviewed Applicant at her mother’s home. Applicant stated that he and the victim were
arguing over messages on her phone from other men, and she tried to retrieve her phone
from him. He said he grabbed her, threw her over his shoulders, and she landed on the
ground.  He  had  no  visible  markings  or  injuries.  Applicant  was  arrested  for  domestic
battery. (GE 7) On August 22, 2016, the charge was dismissed without prejudice because
the victim did not appear in court to testify. (GE 8, Tr. 54-60)
In  contradiction  to  the  police  report  narrative, Applicant  claimed  in  his PSI  and  in
testimony,  that  the  incident  resulted  from  a  dispute  between  the  victim  and  her sister  that
he  broke  up.  He went to  the  victim’s residence  to  pick up  his “girlfriend’s”  (victim)  children,
when  he  encountered  the  fight between  the  victim  and  her sister.  Despite  calling  her his
girlfriend, he  said  in testimony  that  he  and  the  victim  were not together at the  time, but
rekindled  their  relationship in 2017.  He said the  victim  was injured  because  he  pulled  her
off  of  her sister  during  the  fight, but did not  throw  her over his shoulder. Neither the  fight
between   the   two   women   nor  the   presence   of   the   victim’s  sister  was  mentioned   in  the
police   report.  He   claimed   the   victim   did   not  appear  in  court  to   testify   because   the
allegation  against  him  was false. (GE  2,  Tr. 51-60)  During  testimony, Applicant  alluded  to
being  able  to  provide his ex-wife  (victim) as  a witness  at his hearing, but  did  not.  (Tr. 4  3-
44, 56)
Inexplicably  and  in  contradiction  to  his  testimony  and  PSI  about  the  incident,
Applicant stated in his answer to the SOR “I came to the defense of a brother and sister
argument in which I was defending the woman being assaulted but when officers came,
the woman felt pressured to not send her family member to jail and instead me. I do have
a witness to recall my actions in the situation that I was wrongfully accused of. [emphasis
added]” (Ans.)
On April 4, 2016, the police responded to a report of a suspicious car parked on
the road at 6:53 a.m. There was vehicle debris on the road and scrap markings on the
roadway  leading  to  the  parked  car.  The  car,  a  Dodge  Charger,  was  running  and  had
damage to the front end and two flat and shredded tires on the passenger side. When
police  approached  Applicant  in  the  driver’s  seat,  he  did  not  immediately  roll  down  his
window, but stated “I’m waiting for the TV match,” and “I’m waiting for the match between
the  two  guys.”  He  put  the  car  in  drive  and  drove  forward  about  twenty  yards  before
stopping again. Applicant was escorted out of the vehicle. He smelled of alcohol, and had
vomited  and  urinated  on  himself,  and  was  unsteady  on  his feet.  Applicant  admitted  to
consuming vodka and driving within the past seven hours. He failed a field sobriety test,
and was arrested. His breathalyzer tests showed BACs of .112 and .101, well over the
legal limit, and he was charged with DUI and having an expired driver’s license.  (GE 9)
On March 14, 2017, Applicant changed his plea to “no contest” and was found guilty of
DUI.  He  was  sentenced  to  unsupervised  probation  and  fined.  His  probation  ended  on
March 23, 2018. (GE 10)
In his PSI, Applicant claimed that he was arrested for DUI immediately after his
arrest for domestic violence, despite the fact that the DUI occurred more than one month
after the domestic violence arrest. He was upset and admitted the he drank too much at
a house party. He claimed that he had no intention to drive, but since he was intoxicated,
he decided to sleep in his running vehicle outside the house party. He claimed to have
pled guilty to the DUI charge, and was ordered to attend victim impact class, which he
completed, loss of his license for six months, and fined. (GE 2)
Of note, in his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted responsibility for the DUI
incident,  but  claimed  he  was  “living  out  of  my  car after the  military” and  contradictorily
stated “one day I was drinking in my car that I was living out of and was charged with a
DUI.” (Ans.)
Applicant’s  mother  testified  about  his  history  of  military  service  after  graduating
from  high  school,  and  his  service  overseas  while  on  active  duty  and  as  a  civilian
contractor.  Applicant  testified  to  his  embarrassment  for  his  actions,  and  attributed  his
pattern of behavior were a result of youthfulness. He said he has spent a decade;
“devoting myself to not only uplifting others, not just by race, not just by sex,
not just by  gender preference, but by  uplifting  by  flag  and  informing  people
of   my   actions  and   what  I  did  wrong.  I  hold  seminars  with   the   youth,
especially  of  my  color, I do, to  inform  them  that there are certain things that
we  have  to  grow up  having  to  be  done  that ultimately  you  no  longer have  to
be  governed  by, and  that it’s  okay, that,  you  know, you  can  live  a  lift  without
having these  expectations, that no  one or mothering governs but your ego”
(Tr. 74-75)
He reiterated that he does his job well, and was “a great Air Force member. I’m an even
better civilian.” He said he was “deeply apologetic.” (Tr. 75-77)
At  the   conclusion   of  the   hearing,  I  left  the   record  open   for  Applicant  to   submit
“anything   that you’d like, including   the  character statements that   you  talked  about,  any
evaluations,   any   work   performance   or  achievements,   any   counseling,  and   community
service.” (Tr. 77) In  his post-hearing  submission, he  provided  the  character letter from  Mr.
S., described above.  (AE A)

"Applicant is 54 years old. He married in 1989 and separated from his wife in 1992.
A divorce was never finalized. Since 2010 Applicant has cohabitated with a woman. He
has six children. He received his high school diploma in 1985 and  enlisted in the U.S.
Navy  after  graduation.  In  1995  he  was  administratively  separated  under  Other  Than
Honorable  conditions.  He  claimed  at  the  hearing  that  his  discharge  was  subsequently
upgraded.  He  held  a  security  clearance  while  in  the  Navy  and  during  periods  of
subsequent employment. He was employed by a DoD contractor as a tradesperson since
November 2018 and at the time of his submission of his e-QIP. In March 2022, he began
working  for  a  different  DoD  contractor.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a security  clearance  in
relation to his employment. (Tr. at 16-20, 35, 41-42.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
In paragraph 1 of the SOR, the Government listed numerous acts of misconduct
by  Applicant  resulting in  the  issuance  of  bench  warrants  for failure  to  appear  in  court,
including an outstanding bench warrant issued in June 2017 and charges of contempt of
court on at least four occasions. The SOR also alleged that in 1994 Applicant was taken
to Captain’s Mast for offenses involving fraudulent checks. In addition, the SOR alleged
that Applicant deliberately provided false information three times on his May 2019 e-QIP.
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in paragraph 1, except he denied the
falsifications  by  virtue  of  responding  only to  the  underlying  claims  of  criminal  conduct.
(Answer at 1-3.)
The details regarding each of the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 1 are as
follows:
1.a   Outstanding   bench   warrant  issued   June   2017.  Applicant  failed  to  appear  in
court on June 15, 2017, as required for a readiness hearing on a driving violation citation.
On June 20, 2017, the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest and set bail at $10,000.
The  underlying  charge  was  issued  in  about  February 2017  and  was  for  Driving  with  a
Suspended License (DSL), after his license was suspended or revoked for driving under
the influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant license has been suspended or revoked since
about 1994 for DUI. He was originally arraigned on the DSL charge on May 1, 2017, after
being stopped for speeding. He was also charged with speeding. In his Answer, Applicant
admitted the SOR allegation about an outstanding bench warrant and wrote that he was
homeless  at  the  time  and  had  custody  of  his  son.  He  explained  that  he  had  no  funds
available to pay a fine, although there was no fine to pay at the court hearing he missed.
He blamed his five-year delay in resolving the bench warrant on his work schedule, which
included  travelling  overseas.  At  the  DOHA  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  resolved  the
outstanding warrant in May 2022. He provided no documentation, however, to support
his testimony. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 21-25, 33; GE 7 at 9, 17.)
1.b   Additional bench  warrants,   and   May   2009  arrest for Fugitive   from   Justice   in
another  state.  The  SOR  alleged  that  bench  warrants  had  been  issued  for  Applicant’s
arrest for failure  to  appear in  court in  State 1  in  or about  July 2005,  September 2006,
February 2009, as well as the June 2017 bench warrant alleged in SOR 1.a. The SOR
also alleged that Applicant was arrested in May 2009 in State 1 for being a Fugitive from
Justice in State 2. Following his arrest, he was extradited to State 2 on June 19, 2009. In
his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in this subparagraph 1.b. He testified that
the  bench  warrants  were  issued  because  he  was  delinquent  on  his  child  support
payments. At the DOHA hearing, he clarified that he assumed the bench warrants were
due to child support issues. He testified that he has two ongoing child support issues that
he hopes to resolve with an insurance payment for a car accident. He also explained that
he was extradited to State 2 for failure to pay a probation fine. He sought to shift the blame
for  the  non-payment  of  the  fine  in  State  2  to  a  woman  with  whom  he  once  had  a
relationship. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 25-29, 36-37; GE 6 at 7; GE at 7 at 1, 5, 7, 17, 21.)
1.c  Multiple  charges for Driving  on  a  Suspended  or Revoked  License  due  to  a  prior
DUI. Applicant was issued citations for this driving offense in or about December 1994,
December 1995, March 2008, August 2008, December 2016, and February 2017. In his
Answer, he admitted these allegations and citations. He testified at the DOHA hearing
that he  still has to  complete an 18-month  program  to  be  eligible  to  receive  his driver’s
license. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 29-33; GE 6 at 6; GE 7 at 13, 15.)
1.d  Multiple  charges of Contempt of Court.  Applicant has been found in contempt
of court on at least four occasions, specifically in May 2005, September 2007, May 2009,
and May 2012. In his Answer, Applicant admitted this allegation. At the DOHA hearing,
he  explained  that  the  contempt  citations  were  likely  due  to  delinquencies  in  his  child
support payments over a number of years. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 33-38; GE 6 at 6- 7; GE 7
at 10, 21.)
1.e   October 1994   Non-Judicial Punishment for issuing   fraudulent  checks.   In his
Answer, Applicant admitted that he was charged with this offense. Included in the record
evidence is a report of investigation prepared by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service,
dated  October 18,  1994,  which  states  that Applicant  was  punished  administratively on
October  16,  1994,  in  connection  with  a  related  Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service
investigation into fraudulent check activity. Applicant received a reduction in rank to E-4,
30 days’  restriction, 25 days’  extra duty, and forfeiture of ½ pay for two months, which
was suspended for six months. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied the misconduct.
He admitted  that he  received  another Captain’s mast in  1995  and was administratively
separated from the Navy. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 38-43; GE 6 at 4; GE 8.)
1.f.  Falsification   on   e-QIP   under  Section   22   -  Police   Record.  The  focus  of  the
Government’s  three  falsification  allegations  under  Section  22  of  the  e-QIP  is  whether
Applicant has ever been convicted of an offense and sentenced to a term of imprisonment
exceeding one year, or charged with a felony offense, an offense involving firearms, or
an offense involving alcohol or drugs. He answered this question in the negative when in
fact he had been charged with a felony offense and was convicted and sentenced to a
term of imprisonment exceeding one year. Separately, he was charged with an offense
involving both drugs and a firearm. He has also been charged with an offense involving
alcohol. The details are as follows:
1.f.i  Failure  to   disclose   Applicant’s   April  2004   arrest   in  State   2   for
Possession   of   Marijuana   5   Lbs  or  Greater.   This  was  a   felony   charge.   In   his  e-QIP,
Applicant  characterized   this  charge   as  a   misdemeanor.  The   FBI   report  in  the   DOHA
record reflects  that both  the  charge  at this arrest and  the  charge  to  which he  pled  guilty
were felonies.  He was sentenced  to  two  years of  incarceration  and  five  years of  probation.
In  August 2009,  his probation  was revoked  because  his  fine  had  not been  paid,  and  he
was sentenced  to  serve  up  to  nine  months  in  jail. Applicant’s extradition  from  State  1  to
State  2  in  2009,  discussed  in  SOR 1.b  above, was in response  to  his probation  revocation.
He was released  from  jail in February  2010.  In  his July  2019  background  interview, he
failed   to   voluntarily   disclose   that   the   charge   was  a   felony.  When   confronted   with   the
Government’s  information   that   the   charge   was  a   felony   and   he   was  sentenced   to   two
years  of   confinement,   he   did   not   dispute   either  fact.   In   his   Answer,  he   wrote   that   the
charge   was  “presented”   as  a   misdemeanor   though   he   acknowledged   that  the   offense
“carried” a  two-year sentence.  He also denied  that he  possessed five  pounds  or  more of
marijuana.   At   the   DOHA   hearing   Applicant  insisted   the   2004   charge   was  for  a
misdemeanor.  He also  denied  being  sentenced  to  two  years of incarceration.  Applicant
did not  deny  that  he  served  nine  months in  jail  after his probation  was revoked  for non-
payment  of the  $8,000  fine  imposed  as  part  of  his original sentence. His testimony  was
inconsistent with  the  FBI report in  the  record  evidence  that  the  charge  was a  felony  and
that he  was sentenced  to  two  years of  incarceration. His testimony  was  unconvincing  and
lacked  credibility. Applicant’s e-QIP  falsification  was deliberate.  (Tr. at 43-47;  GE  1  at  33-
34;  GE 2 at 12;  GE  6 at 10-12.)
1.f.ii  Failure  to   disclose   a  December  1995   arrest  and   felony   charge   of
Possession, Purchase  Cocaine  Base  for Sale and  related  charges, including  Possession
of  a  Controlled  Substance  while  Armed. Applicant pled guilty to Transportation with the
Intent to Sell Narcotics Controlled Substance and was sentenced to 270 days in jail and
three  years  of  probation.  This  charge  is  a  felony,  and  it  involved  drugs  and  a  firearm.
Applicant failed to disclose this arrest and the charges, and he did not voluntarily disclose
them during his July 2019 background interview. In his Answer, Applicant did not try to
explain why he did not disclose,  in his e-QIP,  these charges and conviction, for which he
served  jail time.  At  the  hearing, he  sought  to  explain  his  omission  based  on  the  number
of   years  that  had   passed   since   these   charges.  His  testimony   was  unconvincing   and
lacked  credibility. Applicant’s e-QIP  falsification  was deliberate.  (Tr. at 47-52;  GE  1  at  32-
34; GE 2 at 12;  GE 6 at  5.)
1.f.iii  Failure to  disclose  February  1993  arrest  and  charge  of  DUI with  a  BAC
over 0.10%. The documentary records in evidence reflect that Applicant was arrested for
DUI on December 5, 1994. In his e-QIP, Applicant provided two separate dates for this
arrest, December 1993 and December 1994.  At his hearing, Applicant testified that he
only had one DUI and that was in 1993. His license was suspended at that time. In his
background interview, however, he described his DUI arrest as occurring in December
1994. In his Answer, Applicant admitted to this arrest, though he denied having a BAC
over 0.10%. I am unable to find in the evidence any official record of a second DUI offense
in  1993,  and  Department  Counsel  did  not  note  any  such  record.  Applicant  truthfully
disclosed on his e-QIP his one DUI, which occurred in December 1994 according to the
official records. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 53-55; GE 1 at 32-33; GE 2 at 11; GE 7 at 11.)
1.g  Falsification  on  e-QIP  under Section  24  –  Use of  Alcohol. Applicant failed to
disclose  on  his  e-QIP  treatment  received  in  May  1993  at  a  Navy  Counseling  and
Assistance  Center  (CAAC)  as  a  result  of  his  use  of  alcohol.  Applicant  was  referred  to
Level II treatment for alcohol abuse at a Navy CAAC and completed his treatment in May
1993. The e-QIP question in Section 24 asks if the individual has ever been ordered or
asked to seek counseling or treatment as a result of his use of alcohol. The question also
asks if the individual has ever voluntarily sought counseling or treatment as a result of his
use of alcohol. Applicant answered both questions in the negative, which was incorrect.
In his Answer, he claims he was never ordered to attend CAAC, but he states that upon
his arrival at a new duty station he was sent to CAAC. It is unclear what he meant by
those  statements.  At  the  DOHA  hearing,  he  clarified  that  he  simply  forgot  about  the
treatment.  He  further  explained  that  he  never  sought  the  treatment  nor  was  he  ever
ordered to attend it. He testified that his attendance at the CAAC was simply part of the
requirement of reporting to a new duty station. He explained in his July 2019 background
interview  that  the  CAAC  alcohol  education  program  also  satisfied  the  education
requirements he was ordered to take after what he described as his 1993 DUI conviction.
Under  the  wording  of  the  e-QIP  question,  his  attendance  at  CAAC  alcohol  education
treatment required  an  affirmative  answer. Applicant’s  testimony on this SOR allegation
was  confusing,  disjointed,  unconvincing,  and  lacked  credibility.  Applicant’s  e-QIP
falsification was deliberate. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 55-59; GE 1 at 35-36; GE 2 at 11, 14.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The  Government  cross-alleges  as  criminal  conduct  the  personal  conduct
allegation  set forth  in subparagraph  1.a.  concerning the  outstanding June  2017  bench
warrant. In his Answer, he denied having ever been involved in any criminal activity. He
wrote that all of the alleged incidents of criminal activity were the result of “’being in the
wrong place at the wrong time.’” (Answer at 3; Tr. at 59.) As discussed above, Applicant
testified  that  the  2017  bench  warrant  was  resolved,  but  he  provided  no  supporting
documentation.
Paragraph 3  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
is
financially  overextended  and
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
because  he
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
identifies three past-due debts that have been referred to collection. The debts total about
$9,000. In his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations, but asserted that two
of  the  debts  had  been  resolved  and  that  he  has  been  trying  to  contact  the  creditor  to
resolve the third debt (SOR 3.b) (Answer at 3.)
The current status of the allegations in paragraph 3 of the SOR is as follows:
3.a.  Cellphone   account  in  collection   in  the   approximate   amount  of   $1,416.
Applicant admitted that he failed to pay this bill when it was due because he lost his job
in 2018 and was unemployed for about two-to-three months (June 2018 to August 2018).
He testified that he paid this account in June 2021. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 60-61;
GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 6.)
3.b.  Rental account in collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of $7,305. Applicant
was  unable  to  pay  his  rent  due  to  his  loss  of  employment  in  June  2018.  He  was
unemployed from June to August 2018. He vacated his residence in October 2018 with
about  four months  of  rent  ($1,780  per month)  unpaid.  Applicant  testified  that  since  he
returned from his most recent overseas business trip in 2021, he has tried to contact this
creditor, but he has not been successful. Applicant’s background interview conducted by
a  U.S.  Government  investigator  occurred  in  July  2019.  The  investigator’s  report  of
investigation  summarizing  the  interview  was  attached  to  DOHA’s interrogatories  in  the
record. Applicant noted in his interrogatory responses that he agreed with the report as
accurate and adopted the report as his own statement. In that report, it was noted  that
Applicant  was  in  contact  with  this  creditor  at  the  time  of  the  interview.  He  was  told  he
would receive in the mail a statement with the balance due. He told the interviewer that
he planned to pay the debt off in installments by May 2020. He provided no documentary
evidence  addressing  the  current  status  of  this  debt  or  his  claimed  attempts  to  seek  a
resolution. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 61-63; GE 1 at 9, 15; GE 2 at 5, 14; GE 4 at 2;
GE 5 at 5.)
3.c. Pay-day  cash  loan  account  in collection  in the  approximate  amount of  $315.
Applicant admitted that he failed to repay this loan when it was due. He testified that he
repaid this loan in or about June 2021. GE 3 reflects a zero balance due on this account.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 63-66; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 6.)
",False
"In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the  SOR allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,

Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  in  about  2003,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
Contempt of Court for Failure to Appear or Complete Jury Service. Applicant admitted the
allegation. (SOR response) His mother paid the fine. (Tr. 39)
SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  in  about  January  2009,  Applicant  was  found  guilty  of
Trespassing,  Disorderly  Conduct,  and  Contempt  of  Court.  He  admitted  the  SOR
allegation. (SOR response) At his hearing, he said he could not remember the trespassing
and  contempt  of  court  charges.  (Tr.  40)  He  was  unsure  about  the  disorderly  conduct
charge; however, he  remembers asking an officer a question about moving his friend’s

for  the  charge.  (Tr.  40)  The  court  record  reflects  a  guilty  finding  and  $200  fine  for
trespassing and a guilty finding and $200 fine for disorderly conduct. (GE 4 at 2)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges in about March 2009, Applicant was charged with Contempt of
Court, and he received a fine. The court docket indicates he was found guilty and received
a $107 fine. (GE 4 at 2)
SOR  ¶  2.d  alleges  in  about  July  2009,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Public
Drunkenness, tried in abstentia, found guilty, and fined $50. (GE 4 at 4) He forfeited his
cash bond. (GE 4 at 1, 4) He admitted the SOR allegation. (SOR response)
SOR  ¶  2.e  alleges  in  about  October  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driving
Under the Influence of alcohol (DUI), tried, and found guilty. Applicant admitted the SOR
allegation. (SOR response) Applicant said he only had one or two drinks. (Tr. 42, 91) At
a road block, a police officer told Applicant to pull over. (Tr. 43) He received a field sobriety
test, and “he did the eye thing.” (Tr. 91) He believed the request for a breathalyzer test
was unfair because he was the only one required to do a breathalyzer test, and he refused
the  proffered  breathalyzer test.  (Tr.  43,  92) Applicant  testified  in  court  that  he  was  not
drunk; however, he was found guilty of DUI, and his driver’s license was suspended until
he  completed  an  alcohol-awareness  class.  (Tr.  44,  92)  He  completed  the  alcohol-
awareness class about two months later, and his driver’s license was reinstated. (Tr. 26,
45, 82) He said he was advised that the DUI conviction would be removed from his record
after five years. (Tr. 26)
SOR  ¶   2.f   alleges  in   about  August   2013,  Applicant   was  arrested   for  Ran   Stop
Sign/Light,   Seatbelt   Violation,  Driver  License   Suspended   for  DUI  (1st),  and   Disorderly
Conduct-Failure to  Comply. Applicant said the  only  charge  with  a  guilty  finding  was the
Ran  Stop  Sign/Light  offense.  (Tr. 45-48)  The  court docket indicates in September 2013,
he  was found  guilty  with  testimony  in open  court of Disorderly  Conduct-Failure to  Comply,
and  he received a  $500  fine and other charges of  $182. (GE 4  at 5)
SOR ¶  2.g  alleges in about September 2013, Applicant was arrested  for Driver’s
License   Suspended   for  Other  Reasons  (1st) and   DUI  (2nd)  No  Test.   Applicant  said   his
driver’s license  was not suspended. (Tr. 26,  45-47) He denied  that he  was drinking  any
alcohol  that day. (Tr. 49-50) He refused  the  breathalyzer because  “why  should I have  to
breathe  every  time  I get pulled  over because  I  had  a  DUI three,  four years ago.” (Tr. 50)
Applicant said  he  “beat the  case” in   court. (Tr. 27,  50)  Applicant  said the  police  officer
who  arrested  him  left the  police  force,  and  the  case  was dismissed  because  the  officer
“quit lying  about his involvement of  giving  [him] the  DUI.” (Tr. 31, 51)  The  police  officer
quit or retired  from  the  force because  “he  wasn’t going  to  participate  or involve  [himself]
in messing  with  people’s lives.” (Tr. 51) After his hearing, Applicant provided  an abstract
of  court record, which states his attorney  “entered  guilty  plea  30  days to  appeal or pay  5
days  jail  and   10   mandatory   days  comm   service   (dismissed   in   appeal   court-see   court
order).” (AE  E) The  abstract also indicates the  other two  charges were  dismissed. (AE  E)
SOR ¶  2.h  alleges on  or about  October 26,  2014,  Applicant was arrested  for and
then   subsequently   pleaded   guilty   to   Driver’s  License   Suspended   for  DUI  (2nd)  and
Speeding.  Applicant said  he  was unaware his driver’s license  was suspended   after his
second  DUI arrest,  and  at  the  time  of the  driving  with  suspended  license  arrest the  case
related  to  the  second  DUI arrest in  2013  was still  pending  a  trial. (Tr. 51-53)  He  pleaded
guilty to the  speeding  offense. (Tr. 54)
SOR ¶ 2.i alleges on or about October 29, 2014, Applicant was arrested for and
then subsequently pleaded guilty to Driving While License Suspended for Other Reasons.
The police record indicates he pleaded guilty at trial. (GE 4 at 1) However, he said the
only time his driver’s license was suspended was after the first DUI until he received the
certificate showing he completed the alcohol-awareness class. (Tr. 32-33)
SOR ¶ 2.j alleges in about September 2015, Applicant pleaded guilty to Disorderly
Conduct-Failure  to  Comply.  Applicant  said he  had  an  argument  with  the  mother of  his
child. (Tr. 55) A police officer wanted Applicant to leave the apartment he was sharing
with the mother of his child, and Applicant refused to leave. (Tr. 56) The police officer took
Applicant to jail. (Tr. 57) The police record indicates he pleaded guilty at arraignment. (GE
4 at 1) The court docket indicates he was found guilty of Disorderly Conduct–Failure to
Comply, and the court imposed a $500 fine and $172 in costs. (GE 4 at 6)
SOR ¶  2.k alleges in  about August  2018,  Applicant  was charged  with  Failure to
Appear  and   Contempt,   after  he   knowingly  violated   a   court-issued   protective   order.
Applicant received  an  order from  the  court  directing  him  not  to  contact the  mother of  his
child  for 30  days. (Tr. 57) He was authorized  to  speak to  her through  a  third  party. (Tr.
59) Applicant went to  a  police  station  to  obtain  help getting  his clothes from  the  mother of
his  child.   (Tr.   29,  60)   The   mother   of  his  child   works  at   the   police   station.  (Tr.  30)  He
thought the  police  would help him; however, he  was arrested for violation  of  a protective
order. (Tr.  29)  The  charge  was dismissed  because  Applicant  did  not  understand  how  he
could  get  his  clothing   returned   from   the   mother  of  his  child.   (Tr. 29-30,  84) The   judge
found  Applicant  did not understand the  parameters of the  protective  order. (Tr. 73)
Applicant  currently  has  a  good  relationship  with  the  mother  of  his child,  and  he
speaks to her about every day. (Tr. 29, 58) They have meals together, and he described
his relationship with her as “wonderful.” (Tr. 64)
Applicant does not consume any alcohol to a large extent. (Tr. 61-62) He drinks
alcohol about once a week. (Tr. 62) He limits himself to consumption of one or two drinks.
(Tr. 63) He has not received any alcohol counseling after the alcohol-awareness class he
received shortly after the October 2009 DUI arrest. (Tr. 63)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant failed to disclose in his October 2, 2018 SCA
the criminal offenses in the criminal conduct section, supra. SOR ¶ 1.c cross alleged the
allegations in the criminal conduct section, supra.
Section 22, Police Record, asks in the last seven years: (1) whether Applicant was
issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding; however,
fines  less  than  $300  for  offenses  unrelated  to  alcohol  or  drugs  are  not  reportable;  (2)
whether he had been arrested by any law enforcement official; and (3) whether he has
been, charged, or convicted of any crime in any court. (SOR 1.a; GE 1 at 26-27) Section
22,  Police  Record,  also  asks  whether  he  had  “EVER  been  charged  with  an  offense
involving  alcohol  or  drugs.”  (Id.  at  27;  SOR  ¶  1.b  (emphasis  in  original))  Applicant
incorrectly answered, no, to these questions. (GE 1 at 26-27)
Applicant  said  he  received  assistance  completing  his  SCA,  and  he  answered
everything  to  the  best  of  his  ability.  (Tr.  32,  66)  He  may  have  misunderstood  the
questions. (Tr. 32) He focused on the seven-year time limit in several questions. (Tr. 68)
He did not disclose the 2011 DUI because of the seven-year time limit, and the second
DUI charge “shouldn’t be on [his] record anymore. I beat the case.” (Tr. 69-70) He said
he believed he did not have to disclose the second DUI arrest because it was thrown out
in court. (Tr. 73) Applicant understands the difference between an arrest, a charge, and
a dismissed charge. (Tr. 72-73) As to the August 2018 offense, Applicant acknowledged
the  police  arrested  him  for  violation  of  the  protection  order,  but  he  did  not  disclose  it
because he believed there should not have been a record of the offense and the charge
was dismissed. (Tr. 73-74)
Applicant said he did not tell the person assisting him with completion of his SCA
about the DUI arrest in 2014. (Tr. 95-96) He told her about the arrest in 2018, and that
the charge was dismissed, and she said “to put no and keep going.” (Tr. 85) He did not
ask  her  for  a  statement  corroborating  her  advice  about  not  disclosing  the  information
about dismissed charges on his SCA prior to his hearing. (Tr. 93) I suggested that he ask
her for  a  statement  after  his hearing.  (Tr. 93-95)  On  July  12,  2022,  the  director of  the
entity assisting the developmentally disabled wrote “Our staff did not guide or direct his
responses to the information which he provided” on his SCA. (AE B)
On  April  24,  2019,  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator
interviewed Applicant. (Tr. 75-76) Applicant did not remember the interview. (Tr. 75-80)
The summary of  interview indicates Applicant disclosed the details of  his August 2018
arrest for violation of the protective order to the OPM investigator. (GE 2 at 3) The OPM
investigator confronted Applicant about several of his other arrests. (GE 2 at 4-5)
Applicant’s  sister  believes  Applicant  made   an   honest  good   faith   mistake   on   his
SCA because  he  was focused  on  the  dismissal of the  charges and  not on  the  arrests.  (Tr.
86) He believed  the  seven  years elapsed  and  his first DUI  was outside  that  time  limit. (Tr.
86) He was following  the  advice of  the  person  who  assisted  him  with  the  completion  of
his SCA. (Tr. 90) He did not intend or attempt to be deceptive. (Tr. 86)
Character Evidence
Applicant gets along well with his coworkers. (Tr. 34) He wants to provide financial
support to his family. (Tr. 34) On March 11, 2022, the director of a company assisting the
developmentally disabled said Applicant “has performed his work in our mail room very
well. We have seen no personal or employment related issues and do consider him to be
of good character.” (AE A) On July 12, 2022, the director wrote that Applicant “has been
an  excellent  employee”  and  there  were  no  known  issues  of  concern  pertaining  to  his
security clearance. (AE B)
Applicant’s sister said he has been able to live on his own in an apartment since
he was hired to work in the mail room. (Tr. 87) He has a separate apartment from the
mother of his child. (Tr.88) He is trustworthy, and he does a good job in the mail room.
(Tr. 86, 99) He has matured tremendously in the last several years. (Tr. 99)

Personal Conduct
1.a.,  2.a.  and  3.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  arrested  in  July  of  2016,  and
subsequently pled guilty to the misdemeanor offense of Indecent Exposure. As part of his
sentence, he was required to register as a sex offender. (Item 5.)
2.a. It  is alleged  that Applicant failed  to  register as a  sex offender.  As noted by
Department Counsel in the FORM, this is incorrect as Applicant did so register. (FORM
at page 2.) Applicant registered in June of 2017, and re-registered in April of 2020 due to
an “Address Change.” (Answer at pages 3~9.)
",True
"Applicant is 30 years old, married, and has three children, ages five, six, and nine.
He graduated from high school in 2009 and received a bachelor’s degree in November
2016 and a master’s degree in 2018. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in December
2009 and was honorably discharged in September 2013. Applicant was granted a security
clearance in connection with his service. He  began working for the Marine Corps as a
civilian police officer at a camp (the Camp) in September 2016. The Commanding Officer
of  the  Camp’s  Security  and  Emergency  Services  Battalion  terminated  Applicant’s  two-
year  probationary  period  of  employment  in  September  2018  after  determining  that
Applicant  “was  not  suitable  for  continued  employment  with  the  Federal  service.”  As
discussed below, he changed careers and earned a bachelor’s degree in IT management
in  2020.  Since  December  2019  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  an  IT  technician
contractor at the same Marine Corps camp at which he served as a civilian police officer.
With contract changes, he is presently working in the same capacity at the same location
for  a  third  company.  He  is  seeking  to  retain  his  security  clearance  in  relation  to  his
employment. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 16-19, 65; GE 1 at 11-12; GE 4 at 5.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a that in September 2018 there
was  a  probable  cause  determination  was  made  that  Applicant  had  committed  three
crimes,  specifically  Obstruction  of  a  Criminal  Investigation,  Attempt  to  Commit  a
Conspiracy,  and  Supervising  and  Aiding  a  Prostitute.  The  SOR  further  alleged  in  this
subparagraph that Applicant’s employment as a police officer with the U.S. Marine Corps
was terminated following that probable cause determination.
In his Answer Applicant denied having ever been involved in any criminal activity.
He wrote that there was “no probable cause as I was never arrested or charged with any
crime.” He noted that the investigation into his activities was dropped. He explained that
his  civilian  employment  with  the  Marine  Corps  was  terminated  “because  I  was  a
probationary employee involved in a criminal investigation.” (Answer at 1.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The  Government  cross-alleged  in  subparagraph  2.a  the  allegations  set  forth  in
subparagraph 1.a.
The Government’s  Documentary  Evidence
On  September  12,  2018,  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  Criminal  Investigation  Division
(CID) initiated an investigation of Applicant following receipt of  information that he had
directed his wife, a Marine Corps sergeant at the time, to delete text messages and other
evidence  on  her  personal  cellphone  to  cover  up  her  activities  of  soliciting  herself  for
prostitution on a specialized “dating:” website (the Website). The CID coordinated its joint
investigation of Applicant’s wife and Applicant, with a Regional Special Assistant United
States Attorney (SAUSA) because Applicant worked as a civilian at the Camp. (GE 2 at
2; GE 3 at 2.)
The CID investigated Applicant’s wife for violations of the Uniform Code of Military
Justice  involving  Pandering  and  Prostitution.  The  CID  interviewed  a  Marine  Corps
sergeant (the Marine) who was a sex customer of Applicant’s wife and identified her in a
photographic  lineup.  In  an  interview  of  a  civilian  at  the  Camp,  the  civilian  reported  to
investigators that he overheard Applicant telling others that his “wife goes on dates with
rich men for extra money.” After hearing this comment, the witness confronted Applicant.
Applicant told him that his wife does not have sex for money on her “dates” so it was legal.
The CID also conducted a review of text messages between Applicant and his wife. Two
of the messages discuss ‘their infidelity.” Other messages between Applicant and his wife
contain discussions about the wife’s “prostitution activities.” (GE 3 at 2-13.)
The record includes a CID report, dated September 14, 2018, regarding a search
of  Applicant’s  cell  phone,  which  revealed  that  he  supervised  his  wife  as  she  solicited
herself for prostitution on the Website. The CID report also states that on September 14,
2018,  the  SAUSA  concluded  that  probable  cause  existed  to  believe  that  Applicant
committed four Federal crimes in connection with these activities. The personnel security
tracking  system  was  updated  to  reflect  that  Applicant  was  the  subject  of  a  criminal
investigation.  In  his  August  27,  2021  response  to  DOHA’s  interrogatories,  Applicant
confirmed his separation from civilian employment at the Camp in September 2018 during
his probationary period due to “allegations of obstructing a criminal investigation, attempt
to commit a conspiracy, and supervising or aiding a prostitute.” (GE 2 at 2-3; GE 3 at 2;
GE 4 at 2, 3.)
A CID report, dated January 11, 2019, reflects that investigators interviewed the
Marine, who had paid Applicant’s wife $250 on two separate occasions “for her company
which  resulted  in  sexual  intercourse.”  The  Marine  advised  the  CID  investigators  that
Applicant met the Marine at the Marine’s residence and advised that he and his wife had
been  questioned  by  CID  investigators.  Applicant  asked  the  Marine  not  to  provide  law
enforcement any information if he was contacted. Another CID report, dated September
17, 2019, discusses the investigators finding text messages between Applicant and his
wife about a violation of a military protective order in place between them and physical
abuse by Applicant of his wife. (GE 3 at 4, 13.)
In  November  2019  the  Marine  Corps  administratively  separated  in  lieu  of  trial
(SILT)  Applicant’s  wife  from  the  Marine  Corps  under  Other  Than  Honorable  (OTH)
conditions. The CID investigation of Applicant’s wife was closed on November 27, 2019,
following her SILT. All of her property seized during the investigation was returned to her.
The  investigation  of Applicant  remained  open  pending  “the  adjudication  of [Applicant.]”
On  January  6,  2020,  the  SAUSA  determined  that  no  action  would  be  taken  against
Applicant, and the investigation was closed later that month. (Tr. at 28-29; GE 3 at 13,
14-15, 16-17, 19, 21; GE 4 at 5.)
DOHA Hearing Testimony
Applicant  learned  that  he  was  under  investigation  shortly  before  his  civilian
employment with the Marine Corps was terminated in September 2018. He had learned
that  his  wife  was  under  investigation  for  prostitution  a  few  days  before  that.  The
investigation  began  after  Applicant  had  a  conversation  with  co-workers  in  which  he
discussed his wife  going out  on  “dates”  with  rich  men  who  paid for her company.  The
dates were arranged through the Website. She had been using the Website to arrange
dates  for  a  couple  of  months  prior  to  the  investigation.  Applicant  believes  that  his
conversation with his co-workers was misinterpreted. (Tr. at 20-22, 26, 34.)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  aware  that  his  wife  advertised  herself  on  the
Website as available for paid  “dates.”  He denied, however, that he was aware that his
wife was having sex with the men who paid her to go out on dates. Applicant spoke with
the Marine after Applicant became aware of the investigation. He testified that the Marine
told him that prior to his dates with Applicant’s wife, there was no  agreement that they
would  have  sex  on  their  dates.  The  sexual  intimacy  just  “happened”  between  “two
consenting adults.” Applicant claimed that he cannot remember how he learned about his
wife’s sexual activities with the Marine. He does recall asking the Marine  not to talk to
investigators if they asked to interview him. He wanted the Marine to keep the “personal
matters” between himself and Applicant’s wife. Applicant had developed a friendship with
the Marine because  Applicant found him  to be  “very respectful and just a man of great
moral  character.”  The  Marine  was  discharged  from  the  Marine  Corps  under  OTH
conditions as a result of his patronizing prostitution from an active-duty Marine. Applicant
remains in contact with the Marine once or twice a month through social media. (Tr. at
22, 25-26, 32-34.)
The dating activity of Applicant’s wife occurred during a period when, according to
Applicant, the  couple  were  “in  a  financial bind.”  He claimed he took  a large pay  cut to
become a police officer at the Camp. Applicant had previously worked as a car salesman
and  as  a  pizza  delivery  driver.  Applicant’s  wife  learned  about  the  Website  and  the
opportunity  to  make  extra  money  from  the  girlfriend  of  Applicant’s  co-worker.  The
girlfriend was active on the Website. Applicant and his wife viewed the dating activity as
a way for his wife to earn extra cash by going out “to dinners and get paid and make a
couple of hundred dollars an hour just to go out.” The plan was for her to develop “Sugar
Baby/Sugar Daddy” relationships and earn money on the side of her duties as a Marine
Sergeant. Applicant testified that he had discussed this plan with his wife, and they agreed
that she would not engage in any “intimacy.” He claimed that restriction was specifically
stated in her online profile on the Website. He testified, “Unfortunately, one of these dates
resulted in intimacy, and that’s what landed us here.” He  claimed that he subsequently
learned that his wife had sex with other “Sugar Daddies” during the period when she was
going out on dates arranged through the Website. (Tr. at 22-26, 37; GE 1 at 12-13.)
Applicant agreed that he asked his wife “to delete text messages that had personal
conversations.” He denied, however, that he ever “supervised [his wife] as she solicited
herself  online.”  He  admitted  that  he  approved  or  disapproved  her  dating  specific  men
because he wanted her to limit her dating to older men to avoid a risk of “attraction.” He-
also  admitted  that  he  logged  on  to  her  webpage  on  the Website  “after  the  fact,  going
through the conversations just to verify” that she advised her clients that their dates would
not involve “intimacy.” (Tr. at 27-28.)
Applicant agreed that a SAUSA had found probable cause to believe that Applicant
had committed certain crimes, which authorized the investigators to seize and conduct
searches  of  Applicant’s  electronic  equipment,  including  his  Smart  Watch.  Based  upon
that finding of probable cause, the investigators also took DNA samples from Applicant
and  uploaded  that  to  Combined  DNA  Index  System  (CODIS),  the  U.S  National  DNA
database maintained by the FBI. The investigators also took Applicant’s fingerprints and
“mugshots,” which were uploaded to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center (NCIC)
(Tr. at 29-30, 59-60.)
At  the  time  Applicant  was  terminated  as  a  civilian  police  officer,  he  was  just
completing his two-year probationary period as a U.S. Navy employee. He appealed his
termination, but was unsuccessful. The SAUSA declined to prosecute Applicant for his
conduct in relationship to his wife’s prostitution activities. Applicant speculates that was
because “their probable cause wasn’t strong enough.” (Tr.at 30-32; GE 4 at 5.)
Applicant’s  wife  also  testified.  She  served  in  the  Marine  Corps  from  2010  to
November 2019. She learned about the Website from another Marine. She discussed the
idea with Applicant, and he agreed to her signing up on the Website to offer her services
as a “date.” Her Website profile did not explicitly mention sex. The discussions about sex
came up after she met her dates in person and they had spent some time together. She
was only on the Website  “a couple” or “a few  months” and had about five or six dates,
though she cannot remember a “hard number.” She had ongoing relationships with two
of her dates. On her other dates, she was typically paid about $200 plus some expenses.
She had sex with all of her dates, except the first one. After her first date, she “started to
realize like - - okay, this is what it’s really about.” She claimed that all her husband knew
was  that  she   was  “going   to   hang   out  with   a   friend.” She   also  testified   that  he   was  not
aware that she was having sex  on her dates. (Tr. at 39-49.)
The investigators seized her cellphone as part of the investigation. At the hearing
she initially denied that her husband ever asked her to delete messages from her phone.
She said it all happened so quickly. She clarified her testimony by stating that she did not
recall him asking her to do so. She acknowledged that she did delete messages from her
phone. (Tr. at 49-52.)
Mitigation
After his termination from the Navy in 2018, Applicant began his studies in the field
of IT Management. He was hired at the Camp as a Federal contractor. He claims that he
has “excelled” in  his new career and  has been promoted twice and that his references
praise his work and character. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 32-33, 35.)
Applicant submitted four character reference letters. A former supervisor praised
Applicant’s  integrity  and  work  ethic.  A  co-worker  from  Applicant’s  current  employment
described Applicant as honest and trustworthy. A third letter was written by the Marine,
who paid Applicant’s wife for sexual services and was discharged from the Marine Corps.
He wrote that he spoke with Applicant after the Marine’s activities with  Applicant’s wife
became known through the CID investigation. The Marine believes that Applicant was not
aware  of  his  wife’s  paid  sexual  activities  before  they  were  uncovered  by  the  CID
investigation. He wrote that his belief was corroborated by Applicant. The fourth reference
letter was prepared by a friend and co-worker of Applicant, who then became Applicant’s
supervisor.  He  described  Applicant  as  a  reliable  and  dependable  hard  worker.  (AE  A
through D.)
Applicant also testified that he has been found eligible to be granted a permit to
carry a concealed weapon (CCW). He believes that this permit constitutes evidence  of
his trustworthiness. There is no evidence in the record, however, as to what the standard
is  for  a  citizen  in  his  state  or  county  to  obtain  a  CCW  permit  or  the  nature  of  the
investigation  into  his  background.  Moreover,  the  record  contains  no  evidence  that  the
issuing  authority  was  aware  of  and  weighed  Applicant’s  criminal  actions  in  connection
with his wife’s prostitution activities and the CID investigation. (Tr. at 64.)

"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 3.a and 4.a. She
denied the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.b. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of
fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 25 years old. She graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree in
December 2019. She then pursued and completed a professional certificate in 2021 and
was accepted into a master’s program, which began in August 2022. She married in 2022
and  has  no  children.  She  began  college  in 2015.  In about  May 2017,  she moved  to a
different state and transferred to a local college in her new state. She also worked part-
time as an intern for her present employer, a federal contractor, until she graduated from
college in December 2019. After graduation, she was offered a full-time position by her
present employer and has worked for them since January 2020. (Tr. 23-29; GE 1; AE F,
J, L, M, N)
From approximately September 2015 to May 2017, Applicant used marijuana with
varying frequency. She was 18 to 20 years old at the time. She smoked marijuana with
friends. She stopped using marijuana when she moved to the new state and distanced
herself from the friends with whom she was using it. She credibly testified that she has
not used marijuana or any other illegal drug since May 2017 and does not intend to do so
in the future. When she got married, her wedding was in the state where she previously
lived, and none of her former friends were invited to her wedding. Her husband does not
use  illegal  drugs.  She  provided  a  hair  follicle  drug  analysis  from  June  29,  2022,  with
negative results for illegal drugs. (Tr. 42-47; AE O)
In August 2016, Applicant was in a car with friends when it was stopped by the
police. Marijuana was found in the car. Applicant testified it did not belong to her. She and
the other occupants were arrested. She was charged with possession of marijuana with
the intent to use. She stated she was confused about the arrest and that is why she denied
SOR ¶ 1.b. She said when she went to court a couple of days after the incident, she was
told the charges were dismissed. She did not go before a judge or meet with anyone from
the prosecutor’s office. Her FBI record shows the charge was dismissed. She requested
this charge be expunged from her record and it was so ordered by the court in October
2021. (Tr. 47-48, 70-72; GE 3, AE P)
In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR  she  explained  that in February  2017,  she  was
attending   college   at  X   University   (XU)  in  her  home   state.  In   her  first  semester  of   her
sophomore year, she  received  a  D in  a  course. She  felt  she  deserved  a  better grade. She
had   to   retake   the   class  in  the   spring   semester  and   felt   the   situation   was  unfair,  which
caused  her not to  take  the  course  seriously. On  her first test,  she  received  a  failing  grade.
She  tried  to  make  up  for it, but  received  a  failing  grade  on  her second  exam. She  knew
even  if  she  scored  100% on  her final exam,  she  would still  fail  the  course.  At the  time,
she  was working  part  time  in  the  Office  of  Information  Technology  (OIT) at XU. She  stated
that  before considering  the  ramifications  and  consequences  of her actions,  she  thought
she   could   use   her access  in   the   OIT  to   change   her   grade,   which  she  did.   In   her   SOR
answer, she  said she  then  felt guilty  and  an  hour later she  emailed  her professor telling
her that Applicant’s grade  was incorrectly  put in the  system. Her  professor thanked  her
and corrected  the  grade. She  did not tell  the  professor that it was her who  changed  the
grade. Two  days later,  she  was summoned  to  the  OIT  by  managers who  confronted  her
with  what she  had  done. They  reported  her conduct to  XU and  the  police. She  said  in her
SOR  answer  that  she   was  unaware  that  her  conduct   could   lead   to   serious  criminal
allegations.  She  attributed  her  actions to  being  immature  and  she  had  no  excuse. (Tr. 48-
49, 73-79; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  testified  about  the  specifics  of  her  actions.  She  gained  access  to  the
professor’s  portal and  changed the password  on  the professor’s  account so she could
change the grade. The professor was notified that her password changed and notified the
OIT  asking  why  it  had  changed.  When  the  OIT  became  aware,  they  investigated  the
action,  which  was  traced  back  to  Applicant’s  computer and  the  time  she  was  working.
Applicant testified she was aware of the rules and protocol of working in the OIT and her
conduct  was  a  violation.  When  Applicant  was  confronted  by  the  manager  of  the  OIT
regarding changing the password, she initially denied it and did not take responsibility for
her conduct. She also denied it to the XU conduct board. At her hearing, she testified that
XU  conducted  an  investigation  and  she  was  suspended from  school  at  the  end  of  the
semester for six months. She received an F in the course. She was permitted to complete
her other courses before the suspension. She said she was humiliated and embarrassed.
(Tr. 48-49, 73-79)
In March 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with accessing, falsifying or
tampering with data or computer records, a felony, for her actions at XU. She did not tell
her parents until months later. A public defender represented her. The prosecutor agreed
to  accept  a  Pretrial  Intervention  (PTI)  program,  which  lasted  30  months.  She  was  on
probation  and  had  to  contact  her  probation  officer,  participate  in  drug  testing,  and  not
commit any offenses. She was able to move to a new state while still on probation, but
had to continue to contact her probation officer and was required to notify the probation
officer if she got into any trouble. (Tr. 50-53, 79-84)
In June 2018, while still participating in the PTI and working as an intern with her
employer, Applicant was arrested for shoplifting. She admits her conduct was selfish and
lacked good judgment. She walked into a department store, grabbed four purses, put a
small one in her purse, put another over her shoulder, tried to hide one and said the other
she did not try to hide. A security guard stopped her, checked the tags on the purses and
the police were called. She was arrested and taken to jail. She called her boyfriend, who
later would be her husband. He was upset. She called a bail bondsman, paid the bond,
and was released. She testified that she immediately contacted her probation officer and
told the officer of her arrest. When she returned to court for the charge, the official from
the store failed to appear and the charge was dismissed. She testified that she thought
she got away with it and did it again as noted below. (Tr. 52, 84-89)
In October 2018, Applicant was arrested again for shoplifting. She went into a large
retail store, put items in her cart and went through the self-checkout aisle. She purchased
the items and grabbed extra plastic shopping bags. After completing her purchase and
before leaving the store, she went back through the store and filled the bags with items.
She  then  left  the  store  with  items  she  stole  and  drove  away.  She  was  subsequently
stopped by the police and was arrested. She testified she did this one other time at the
same store about a month earlier and got away with it. She also did it once when she was
in high school, got caught, but she was not arrested and was released by the store.1 (Tr.
55, 89-92)
Applicant testified that she reported the second shoplifting incident to her probation
officer.  She  admitted  that  after  her first  shoplifting arrest,  she felt  she  got  away  with  it
without  consequences  after  the  charge  was  dropped.  In  her  answer  to  the  SOR,  she
stated that when she went to court for the October 2018 offense, she asked the judge if
there  was  a  diversion  program  she  could  participate  in  that  would  help  her  with  her
“kleptomania-like  tendencies”:  She  entered  a  Pretrial  Diversion  (PTD)  program  that
included classes focused on shoplifting.  She said it changed her life and forced her to
think about why she was doing destructive things and how her actions impacted other’s
lives and property. She completed the program in December 2018 and the charge was
dismissed. (Tr. 55-57, 92-93; AE R)
Applicant testified that as part of the PTD program it was recommended that she
seek  therapy,  which  she  did  through  her  college  counseling  services.  She  said  she
attended therapy about once a month for about a year. Discussions were about why she
was struggling, adjusting to a new area, family expectations, and feelings of entitlement.
(Tr. 107-114)
Applicant  completed  the  PTI  program  in  November 2019  and  the  felony charge
was dismissed. In October 2021, this charge was expunged under the same order as her
2016 drug arrest. (Tr. 54-55; AE P, Q)
Applicant did not report her criminal conduct of misusing information technology or
that she was participating in a PTI program to her employer while she was an intern. This
offense occurred before she was hired as an intern. She did not report to her employer
her shoplifting arrests in June 2018 and October 2018 or that she was participating in a

but may  consider  it  when applying  the  mitigating  conditions, in  making  a  credibility  determination  and  in my
whole-person  analysis.
PTD program. She did not believe she was obligated to report her criminal arrests as an
intern and because she was not a full-time employee. She testified that her boyfriend at
the time, now her husband, did review the rules to see if he was obligated to report the
information  and  he  was  not.  He  did  not  counsel  her  to  report  the  information  to  their
employer.  She  testified  that  she  considered  reporting  it,  but  did  not  want  to  risk  an
opportunity to be hired full time. She testified that she has not been involved in any other
authorized computer access since her incident at XU. (Tr. 57-59, 94-98, 106-107)
Applicant provided a document to show that the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS)  gave  her  a  fitness/suitability  determination  where  she  has  access  to  a  level  of
sensitive information. She testified she had to complete an Electronic Questionnaires for
Investigation Processing in 2021. She said she disclosed her criminal arrests. (Tr. 31-32,
5998-100; AE E)
Applicant provided numerous documents reflecting her exceptional performance
while  working  for  her  employer.  She  received  17  awards  since  October  2019  and  her
year-end  reviews  from  2020  and  2021  also  reflect  her  outstanding  performance  and
contribution to the company and its mission. (Tr. 30-35; AE F, G, H, I)
Applicant provided a letter of recommendation from Dr. W from July 2021, that was
submitted  for  Applicant’s  application  for  enrollment  into  the  professional  certificate
program, which she completed. She also provided a letter of recommendation from him
for  a  security  clearance.  The  letter  glowingly  describes  Applicant’s  academic  abilities,
motivation, and personal qualities. She is described as a self-starter, a team player, and
a  problem-solver.  She  is  considered  tenacious,  hardworking,  and  dedicated.  Dr.  W
described Applicant as having a solid work ethic, moral character, and is pleasant and
confident.  He  considers  her  honest  and  has  never  questioned  her  loyalty.  She  is  the
epitome of professionalism, intelligence, integrity and dedication. He recommended her
for a security clearance. Applicant testified that Dr. W was not made aware of the SOR
allegations or her criminal charges. (Tr. 38-40; AE B, K)
Applicant provided a July 2021 character letter from her direct supervisor at work
who has known her for four years. He indicated  in his letter that he  was aware of  “her
need for a security clearance.” He has had regular interaction with her since 2018 and
frequently on a daily basis. He described her as being a diligent worker with a strong work
ethic  and  uncompromised  integrity.  She  sets  the  example  for  her  peers  in  terms  of
dedication, trustworthiness, reliability, and stability. She received 10 performance awards
from  2020  to  2021,  which  is  unmatched  by  her  peers.  Applicant  testified  that  her
supervisor was not privy to the allegations in the SOR or her background, and he is only
aware of her work history. (Tr. 35-38; AE A)
Applicant  provided  a  recommendation  for  promotion  from  Dr.  D.  It  states  that
Applicant executes high quality technical work, engages in leadership behavior, supports
and  monitors  the  team.  She  motivates  others.  Dr.  D  also  described  different  technical
accomplishments of Applicant and recommended her for promotion. (Tr. 40-42; AE C)
Applicant’s husband provided a statement on behalf of her. He has known his wife
since  2017.  He  works  for  the  same  company.  He  describes  her  as  one  of  the  most
honorable  and  hardworking  individuals  he  has  ever  known.  He  was  aware  of  some
mistakes she made and that she exercised poor judgment when she was younger. He is
aware of mistakes she made in 2018. He stated she can be trusted. If he did not believe
that she could be trusted, he would not be married to her. He would not jeopardize the
security clearance he holds. She volunteers for difficult tasks and rises to the occasion.
She is a valuable asset to the company. (Tr. 63-67; AE D)
Applicant provided a copy of her credit report that reflects she pays her bills and
has no financial issues. She purchased a vehicle in 2019 and paid the loan in 2020. She
was responsible for paying her tuition and her father helped her with half of it. She worked
and went to school at the same time and was responsible for her monthly expenses. (Tr.
60-62; AE S, T)
Applicant stated  in  her  Answer to  the  SOR  and  testimony  that  she  has received
accolades for her outstanding  performance  and  awards that  were provided  as exhibits.
She  works on  important projects that impact the  public interest. She  volunteers her time
for students  in the  science, technology, engineering  and  mathematics (STEM) curriculum
for grades kindergarten  through  12th  grade  as a  mentor and  judge  in  competitions. She
also  mentored   an   all-girls  robotics  team.  She   volunteers  at  work  and   participates  in
different teams that help others. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant provided a lengthy and detailed Answer to the SOR. In it, she repeatedly
takes full responsibility for her conduct and makes no excuses. When testifying she did
the  same  and  was  candid.  She  attributed  her  drug  involvement  with  being  around  the
wrong people and has put that in her past. She says she has turned her life around. The
PTD class forced her to reflect on her life and she saw people like her who were also
struggling with their choices. She found it beneficial and it was an epiphany in her life.
She attributes her criminal conduct to being young, immature, and selfish. She says she
is no longer that person, and she has learned her lessons and grown from her mistakes.
She is thankful that the system gave her a second chance to restart her life.
",False
"In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the SOR allegations  in ¶¶  1.a -1.d,  and
2.a  - 2.b.  He  denied  the  SOR allegations  in paragraphs  3.a  and  3.b  (Response  to  SOR).
At hearing, he  admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.e  and  2.b  as amended.  His admissions  are accepted
as findings of  fact.
Applicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from
high school and has some college credit, but no degree. He served on active duty in the
Navy from March 1986 to April 2009. After 23 years, he retired at the rank of E-8, senior
chief  petty  officer,  with  an  honorable  discharge.  While  in  the  Navy,  he  held  security
clearances at the Secret and Top Secret levels. He is divorced and has one adult son.
He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  April  2009  after  his  retirement  from  the
Navy. (Tr. 14-16, 24-25)
Alcohol Consumption
Alcohol concerns were raised  because  Applicant was arrested  and   convicted  of
DUI offenses  on  four occasions between  July  1995  to  September 1,  2018.  (SOR ¶¶  1.a
–  1.d) After the  SOR was issued, Applicant  was arrested  and  charged  with  DUI on  May
15, 2022. (SOR ¶ 1.e) The alcohol-related driving offenses are:
SOR ¶  1.a:  In July 1995, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 1]. He pled guilty
and received a fine. (Tr. 16; Gov 1 at 34; Gov 4 at 9) He does not recall the specifics of
this arrest. He was driving home alone from a bar. The police stopped him. He failed a
breathalyzer test. He was on active duty in the Navy at the time. The Navy was aware of
the arrest. (Tr. 26-28)
SOR ¶  1.b: On October 29, 2000, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 1]. He
pled  guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  three  days  in  jail,  a  $600  fine  and  his  license  was
suspended. (Tr. 17; Gov 1 at 34; Gov 4 at 9) Applicant and his roommate were driving to
get breakfast after drinking at a bar. A police officer stopped him. He took a breathalyzer,
but was not sure of the results. His license was suspended for one year. He reported this
offense to the Navy. (Tr. 28-30)
SOR ¶  1.c:   On April 30, 2011, Applicant was arrested for DWI in [State 2]. He pled
guilty and received a fine. (Tr. 17; Gov 4 at 10) He was staying at a hotel. He drove his
motorcycle back to the hotel after going to a sports bar. He had 3-4 alcoholic drinks at the
sports bar. When he pulled into the hotel parking lot, a police officer approached him and
asked to look at his helmet. The police officer smelled alcohol on Applicant’s breath and
asked if he had been drinking. Applicant took a breathalyzer at the police station. He was
over the legal limit. Applicant testified that he attended 20 hours of counseling. He told
his alcohol counselor that this was his third DUI arrest. He does not recall receiving an
alcohol diagnosis and was never advised to stop drinking alcohol. He reported his alcohol
arrest to his employer after his court conviction. (Tr. 31-35)
SOR ¶  1.d: On September 1, 2018, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 3]. He
pled  guilty  and  received  20  days  in  jail,  suspended;  a  $300  fine;  ordered  to  use  an
interlock device on his car for a period of one year; three years probation; and ordered to
attend alcohol counseling through the county health department. (Tr. 17-18; Gov 2 at 26;
Gov 3 at 26; Gov 4 at 2, 11; Gov 5; Gov 6)
Applicant’s  September  2018  arrest  occurred  on  the  Saturday  of  Labor  Day
weekend. He spent the day on a boat with friends. They would dock the boat at different
restaurants throughout the day to drink mixed alcoholic drinks and eat. Applicant does
not recall the number of alcoholic drinks he consumed during the day. He left the boat
around  6:30  or  7  pm.  He  went  to  a  restaurant  after  getting  off  the  boat.  He  stopped
drinking when he left the restaurant around 9 pm. While driving home, he rear-ended a
car that was turning left at an intersection. The passengers in the other car were not hurt.
Applicant  had  about  $500  damage  to  his  car. When  the  police  arrived  at  the  accident
scene, they smelled alcohol on Applicant’s breath. He failed a failed a field sobriety test.
A breathalyzer at the police station registered 0.16. (Tr. 35-39)
SOR ¶ 1.e: On May 15, 2021, Applicant was arrested for DUI in [State 3]. He pled
guilty  and  was  sentenced  to  60  days  in  jail,  suspended,  and  a  $250  fine.  He  lost  his
license for a period of one year. (Tr. 19, 53; Gov 7) At the time of his May 2021 arrest,
Applicant was still on probation related to his 2018 conviction for DUI. An officer observed
Applicant’s vehicle swerving over the line and pulled him over. Applicant admits drinking
about three or four alcoholic drinks before  the  arrest over a period of  three hours at a
restaurant. He refused to take a breathalyzer test because he did not want to take it.  He
claims he reported his arrest to his supervisor after he was convicted. (Tr. 40-43)
Appellant testified that he has never been  diagnosed  with  an alcohol disorder. N  o
one  has ever recommended  that he  abstain  from  alcohol.  He  never attended  Alcoholics
Anonymous  (AA)  meetings.  He  does  not  believe   he   is  an   alcoholic.  He  usually   drinks
alcohol   on   the   weekends.   He  usually   has  three   to   four  drinks  over  a   few   hours  at   a
restaurant.  He does not drink alcohol at home  unless he has company. Before 2009, his
alcohol  consumption  was higher while  he  served  in  the  Navy. Applicant testified  he  drank
alcohol on  average  of  five  to  six  times a  week. He has never tried  to  stop  drinking  alcohol.
He  realizes  that   he   should  stop   or  curtail   his  drinking.  Later,  he   testified   he   does  not
believe  he  needs to  stop  drinking. He just needs to  stop  making  stupid  decisions. (Tr. 48-
52)
Applicant’s  license  has  not  been  reinstated  yet.  It  has  been  over  a  year,  so  he
intends to request a hearing to have his license reinstated. He has not driven after drinking
alcohol since his May 2021, arrest for DUI. When he goes out, his friends drive him or he
takes  an  Uber.  The  last  time  he  went  out  drinking  was  the  Saturday  night  before  the
hearing. He has never reported to work while intoxicated. (Tr. 53- 54)
Criminal Conduct
Applicant’s five  DUI arrests were cross-alleged  under Criminal  Conduct.  (SOR ¶
1.b) A  May  27, 2002  arrest in [State  1] for operating  a  vehicle  with  a  suspended  license
was also alleged. For this offense, Applicant pled  guilty, was fined  $1,000,  and  served  48
hours in jail. Applicant was in the  process of  transferring  to  a  new  duty  location  in [State
3].  He  drove  from  [State  3]  to  [State1].  He  was pulled  over for having  a  tail  light out.  He
said  it was the  first and only time  that he drove on  a suspended license. He reported it to
the  Navy. He claims it did not violate  the  terms of  his probation. He  had  to  fly  back to
[State 3] to serve his 48-hour jail sentence. (SOR ¶ 2.a: Tr. 30-31; Gov 4 at 10)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges that in response to Section 22, on his February 3, 2019, security
clearance application, “Have you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or
drugs?” Applicant answered, “Yes.”  He listed his September 2018 arrest for DUI. He is
alleged  to  have  deliberately  omitted  his  alcohol-related  arrests  in  July  1995,  October
2000, and April 2011, which are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c.
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges that in response to Section 22, on his August 31, 2020, security
clearance application, “Have you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or
drugs?” Applicant answered, “Yes.”  He listed his September 2018 arrest for DUI. He is
alleged  to  have  deliberately  omitted  his  alcohol-related  arrests  in  July  1995,  October
2000, and April 2011, which are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c.
Applicant testified that he misunderstood the question. He believed he was only
required to list alcohol offenses within the last seven years. Applicant listed his November
2000 and July 1995 arrests on his previous security clearance application  in 2009. He
believed  the  question  regarding  alcohol-related  offenses  in  Section  22  did  not  include
alcohol arrests that he previously disclosed. The government was on notice of Applicant’s
1995 and 2000 DUI arrests. (Tr. 20-22. 45-46; Gov 2, Section 22 at 33-34)
Applicant  found  the  e-QIP  security  clearance  applications  in  2019  and  2020
confusing. He never intended to falsify his security clearance applications. He listed his
2018 DUI offense in response to section 22 on both his 2019 and 2020 security clearance
applications.  He  did  not  list  his  2011  DUI  on  either  application.  This  coincides  with
Applicant’s mistaken belief that he did not have to list alcohol offenses that were more
than seven years old on his 2019 and his 2020 security clearance applications. I find SOR
¶¶  3.a  and  3.b  for  Applicant  because  he  did  not  intend  to  deliberately  withhold  these
offenses from the government. He misunderstood the question. (Tr. 21-22)
Character Evidence
Mr. D.A. wrote a letter on Applicant’s behalf. He has known Applicant for over 11
years. He works with Applicant and also socializes with him outside of work. He states
Applicant  cares  about doing  the  job  correctly.  Mr.  D.A.  understands  the  importance  of
national security. He believes Applicant is a valuable asset with knowledge, skill, and a
work ethic that is tough to find. (AE B at 1)
The  Principal  of  Logistics,  at  Applicant’s  employer  states  that  Applicant  has
demonstrated an ability to go above and beyond his required duties for the past 12 years
as an employee. Applicant is an honest, dedicated, and respected employee. (AE B at 2)
Applicant  received  the  following  Navy  ribbons  and  medals:  National  Defense
Service Medal (2); Navy Good Conduct Medal (6); Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal,
Kosovo  Campaign  Medal  (2);  Armed  Forces  Service  Medal  (2);  Navy/Marine  Corps
Achievement Medal (3); Navy/Marine Corps Commendation Medal (2); Meritorious Unit
Commendation;  Coast  Guard  Special  Operations  Service  Ribbon;  Coast  Guard
Meritorious Unit Commendation; and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. (AE A)
Applicant also provided a photo of his house. (AE C)
",True
"Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  information  systems  technologist,  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  since  March  2019.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2002  and
attended  some  college.  He  honorably  served  in  the  United  States  Navy  from  2002  to
2016. While on active duty, he received non-judicial punishment (NJP) for driving under
the  influence  (DUI)  in  2012.  He  married  in  2002  and  separated  in  2015,  and  has  two
children. He has previously held up to a top secret security clearance. His last clearance
was suspended by the DCSA on December 23, 2020.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F,  a  $5,828  debt  owed  to  the  Department  of
Veterans Affairs (VA) (SOR ¶ 1.a); two medical debts totaling $3,808 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and
1.c); and a small debt owed to a university (SOR ¶ 1.d).  Under Guideline J, the SOR
alleges  Applicant  was  arrested  in  2019  for  assault  with  a  deadly  weapon  and
abandonment/neglect of  children, and a  subsequent  restraining order was issued as a
result (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b); an arrest in 2015 for corporal injury to spouse/cohabitant
(SOR ¶ 1.c); an arrest and conviction (deferred prosecution) for DUI in 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.d);
and a 2012 NJP while on active duty for the civilian arrest for the DUI (SOR ¶ 1.e).
Finally, under Guideline E (SOR ¶¶ 3.a - 3.d), the SOR alleges Applicant falsified
his 2020 SCA by intentionally failing to disclose: the arrests alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.c and
2.d, the delinquent federal debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, and the remaining debts alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.b – 1.d. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer to the SOR
without explanations, and the record evidence supports the SOR allegations.
In  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  conducted  by  a  Government  investigator,
Applicant  explained  that  his  felony  arrest  in  2019  was  a  result  of  heavy  alcohol
consumption  late  into  the  night,  an  argument  with  his  girlfriend  at  the  time,  and  a
confrontation with her and her father. Applicant claimed that he was tackled from behind
by her father, at which time  he defended himself  by punching the victim (father) once,
causing  a  broken  eye  socket  or  cheekbone.  (GE  3)  However,  in  May  2021,  Applicant
pleaded  no  contest  to  a  felony  charge  of  inflicting  corporal  injury  (presumably  for  the
serious  injury  to  his  girlfriend’s  father),  and  an  assault  charge  (presumably  committed
against his girlfriend) was dismissed. He was sentenced to 45-days community labor, and
placed on probation for four years, a period that would not end until 2025. As a result of
these charges, Applicant was issued a restraining order in 2021  to stay away from the
victims. (GEs 2, 3, 7, 8, 10) He did not provide information on his current probation status.
Applicant was also arrested in 2015 and charged with inflicting corporal injury on
a spouse/cohabitant. Applicant claimed this arrest was a result of his efforts to prevent
his girlfriend from driving after drinking, arguing, and her falling in the parking lot because
she was intoxicated. He stated that the charge was dismissed after a court appearance.
(GE 3) The record regarding the facts and reason for the dismissal is incomplete. In 2012,
Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence and convicted of negligent driving
pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement. He admitted being over the legal limit. He
was  given  a  deferred  prosecution  but  the  offense  resulted  in  disciplinary action  by  his
Navy commanding officer at NJP. (GEs 3, 7, 8)
Applicant  admitted  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR,  and  noted  in  his  PSI  that  he
entered into a debt relief program in 2016 or 2017 that resulted in several resolved debts.
He noted that he intends to pay his VA debt that resulted when he dropped out of school
after the VA paid his tuition. He believes his large hospital debt should have been paid by
insurance and he intended to dispute it, but then he said he entered into a payment plan
in July 2020 to resolve the debt. (GE 3)
Applicant has not supplied current information regarding the status of the claimed
resolved and remaining SOR debts, or documentary evidence of his debt relief efforts.
He noted in his PSI that he had used loans to pay off other loans, and it snowballed. He
said that his debt relief  company instructed him to stop paying on debts so they could
negotiate settlements on his behalf. No documentary evidence was submitted showing
the results of negotiations with creditors, payment progress or final resolution of any of
the  SOR  debts.  Applicant  intends  to  pay  all of  his  debts  when  able.  In  addition,  partly
because he admitted the Guideline E allegations without further comment, I find Applicant
intentionally  falsified  his  2020  SCA  by  failing  to  disclose  his  2015  arrest,  his  alcohol
related offense, and his debts as required.

Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶   1.a   alleges  in   August  2001,  Applicant  was  arrested   and   charged   with
importing  cocaine  into  the  United  States. (HE  2) In  October 2001, she  pleaded  guilty  in
U.S. district court to  importing  at  least  500  grams of  cocaine  into  the  United  States. The
court dismissed  a  charge  of  possessing  cocaine  with  intent to  distribute. In  January  2002,
she was sentenced to  30  months of imprisonment and  four years of supervised release.
Applicant admitted the  allegations in SOR  ¶ 1.a. (HE 3) At the time of the  offense,
she  was 18  years old  and  earning  $7.25  an  hour  working  in a  retail establishment. (Tr.
19-22) A  drug  distributor promised  to  pay  her  $1,500,  and  in return, she  agreed  to  import
an  illegal drug  into  the  United  States. (Tr. 19-21; HE 3) She left  the  United  States and
went to  Jamaica  with  the  intention  of  bringing  illegal drugs into  the  United  States.  (Tr. 19-
21; HE 3) The  drug  distributor paid for her travel and  vacation  expenses for her trip  to
Jamaica. (Tr. 23) Authorities discovered  about 3.1  pounds of  cocaine  concealed  in  her

imprisonment and federal boot camp, where she received education, trade skills, and life
skills. (Tr. 21; HE 3) Her probation ended in 2004. (Tr. 21) She described her decision to
import cocaine into the United States as naïve and ignorant. (Tr. 25)
SOR  ¶   1.b   alleges  in  April  2011,  Applicant   was  arrested   and   charged   with   the
following   crimes:  aggravated   battery   with   a   deadly   weapon,  a   2nd  degree   felony;
aggravated   assault  with   a   deadly   weapon,  a   3rd   degree   felony;  and   battery.   (HE   2)  In
October  2012,  she   pleaded   guilty   in  state   court  to   battery   and   assault.  She   received
deferred   adjudication   of   both   charges  with   concurrent  sentences  of   12   months  of
imprisonment and  6  months of  probation.
Applicant  admitted  the  charges, pleas, and  sentence  described  in  SOR ¶  1.b. (HE
3)   She   was  outside   a   restaurant/night  club   where  her  sister  worked.  (HE   3)  A   woman
asked  Applicant about whether she  was dating  someone  the  woman  was also dating. (Tr.
23, 26) Applicant got into  her vehicle, and  several women  climbed  into  Applicant’s vehicle.
(Tr. 24) Applicant exited  her vehicle, and  a  physical altercation  between  Applicant,  her
sister, and  three  women  occurred. (Tr. 24; HE  3) Applicant’s sister helped  Applicant get
back into  her vehicle. Applicant  said she  was innocent of the  charges because  of  self-
defense; however, her attorney advised her to plead guilty because she was a convicted
felon. (Tr. 24; HE 3) Her  sister went to  trial and  was acquitted. (Tr. 24; HE 3) Applicant
completed  a six-month  anger-management  class in 2012. (Tr. 27; HE 3)
The police report states:
[Applicant]  intentionally  struck the  [victim] against  her will and  in doing  so
caused  harm  (abrasions cuts and  bruising). [Applicant]  used  closed  fists in
the   incident.   [Applicant]   then   using   a   motor vehicle   intentionally   used   the
vehicle   as  a   deadly   weapon   driving   at  and   striking   the   victim   with   the
vehicle. [Applicant] then turned the vehicle  around and  drove the vehicle at
the  [victim] as she  lay  on  the  ground. Victim  was pulled  out of  the  path  of
[Applicant’s] vehicle. (GE 5  at 11)
Applicant’s  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  personal  subject  interview
(PSI) states Applicant admitted that she bumped the woman when she was backing the
vehicle. (Tr. 44; GE 5 at 2) At her hearing, Applicant denied that she struck the woman
with  the  vehicle.  (Tr.  25,  45)  Applicant  said  security  at  the  restaurant  testified  at  her
sister’s trial that the woman was not struck with a vehicle. (Tr. 26) Applicant successfully
completed her probation, and she did not receive a conviction for the altercation in April

SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  in  January  2019,  Applicant  was  charged  in  state  court  with
public  assistance  fraud  ($200  or  more),  a  3rd  degree  felony,  between  April  2015  and
December 2016.  (HE 2)  She  was  arrested  in  February 2019.  In  September 2019,  she
pleaded  nolo  contendere  to  the  charge  and  received  deferred  adjudication.  She  was
sentenced  to  pay  $11,202  in  restitution,  to  complete  an  anti-theft  class,  and  to  be  on
probation until September 2024.
Applicant admitted  the  charge, pleas, and  sentence  described  in  SOR ¶¶  1.c  and
1.d.  (HE  3)  In  November 2014, she  went on  paid maternity  leave  from  her employment
because  of  the  birth  of  her third  child. (Tr. 29) In  2015, her son’s father moved  out,  and
she  applied  for public assistance. (Tr. 29; HE  3) She  started  receiving  public assistance
in March 2015.  (Tr. 30) In  April 2015, she  returned  to  her employment from  which she
took maternity  leave. (Tr. 31) She  failed  to  accurately  report her employment  income, and
she  continued  to  receive  public assistance. (Tr. 31; GE  6; HE 3) In  October 2015, she  left
her employment,  and  she  went to  work for a  temporary  staffing  agency. (Tr. 32, 34) On
November 23, 2015, Applicant provided  a  pay  stub  showing  bi-weekly  pay  of  $540. (Tr.
35; GE 7  at 12) She  did  not submit the  information  about pay  she  received  from  another
employer.  (Tr.  35)  Again  on   December  3,  2015,  she   provided   a   pay   stub   from   one
employer, but not the  other employer. (Tr. 35-36) Applicant said someone  told  her that
she   did  not  have   to   disclose   income   from   temporary   employment  because   the
employment  might  be   for  only   one   month.   (Tr.  37-39)  She   acknowledged   that  she
received  incorrect information  from  someone  about the  income that was supposed to  be
disclosed. (Tr. 38-39) She  said she  did  not feel at the  time  of  the  receipt  of funds that  she
was fraudulently receiving funds from the government. (Tr. 40)
Applicant said she still qualified for public assistance because of her income level,
three children, and not receiving child support. (Tr. 32, 39; GE 1; GE 2) She stated in her
SCA that even with her new employment she would have still qualified for the assistance.
(GE 1 at 44) She told the OPM investigator she did not report her total income “because
her income would [have] still qualified her for the assistance.” (GE 2 at 2) At her hearing,
she said she believed the annual income threshold for receiving benefits was $50,000 or
$60,000. (Tr. 41)
The  state  investigator indicated  Applicant and  her dependents “received  $6,167.00
in excessive  Food  Stamp  Benefits to  which they  were not legally  entitled, during  the  period
of   May   2015   through   May   2016,”  and   they   “received   $5,035.02   in  excessive   Medicaid
Benefits to  which they  were not legally  entitled  during  the  period  November 2015  through
December  2016,  for  an   aggregate   of  $11,202.02   which  was  obtained   by   fraudulent
means.” (GE  7  at 15) At her hearing, she  conceded  she  was not really  sure whether her
statements  were accurate  about  her total  income  not  causing  her  to  be  disqualified  from
receiving  public assistance. (Tr. 43-44)
From April 3, 2015 to October 1, 2015, Applicant received a salary of $19,827. (Tr.
32-33; GE 7 at 12) From March 2015 to December 2016, she submitted pay stubs totaling
$7,737, and during that time period, she received total income of $89,000. (Tr. 33)
After  pleading   guilty,  she   paid  the   court-ordered   restitution   of  $11,202   for  food
stamps and  Medicaid  and $5,076 for school readiness services; she  completed  the  anti-
theft  class;  and  her probation  was terminated  on  June  29, 2020. (Tr. 42; HE 3; GE  7  at 6-
9)
Applicant’s current annual income  is $81,000, and  her husband’s annual income
is about $90,000. (Tr.  42) They do not have  any financial problems. (Tr. 43)
Applicant  indicated  the  first  offense  was  more  than  20  years  ago.  (Tr.  50)  The
second offense did not result in a conviction, and she paid restitution for the third offense.
(Tr. 50) She is a different person today. (Tr. 48) She is a mother of four children and a
mentor to others. (Tr. 48) She wants to move on and have a successful career and life.

"Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2017.  He  attended  college  for  a  period  without  earning  a
degree. He married in 2004 and divorced in 2012. He married his current wife in 2019.
He has a 15-year-old child and a 2-year-old child. (Transcript (Tr.) at 40, 52, 92; GE 1,
2)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military  from  2000  until  he  was
discharged  with  an  other  than  honorable  discharge  for  misconduct  due  to  the
commission  of  a  serious  offense  in  2016.  (GE  1,  13)  His  problems  resulted  from  a
tumultuous relationship with an ex-girlfriend (Ms X).
Applicant and Ms. X lived together in an apartment in April 2014. Ms. X called the
police  before  0800  on  April  5,  2014,  and  reported  that  she  and  Applicant  had  an
argument,  and  he  assaulted  her.  She  found  emails  that  he  was  communicating  with
another woman. She printed the emails and left them where he could see them. He was
angry  when  he  woke  up  and  saw  the  printed  emails.  He  demanded  that  she  leave
immediately.  He  pushed  her  causing  her  to  slip  to  the  floor.  He  grabbed  her  legs  and
dragged her, which caused her head to hit the floor. She put some clothes on, and she
and  her  sister,  who  was  visiting  them,  left  without  her  belongings.  She  stated  that  he
threw  two  pairs  of  shoes  and  several  bottles  of  Gatorade  at  her  head  when  she  was
outside.  He  hit  her  with  at  least  one  shoe  and  one  bottle  of  Gatorade.  (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
Ms. X and her sister returned to the apartment a short time later. Ms. X related to
the  police  that  Applicant  let  them  in.  Her  sister  was  helping  move  items  out  of  the
house. While she was outside, Applicant took out a handgun, pulled Ms. X to the living
room, pushed her to the couch, and pointed the gun at her head. He let her go several
minutes later, and she ran out of the apartment. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
Ms. X’s sister told the police that in the morning, she heard loud banging coming
from downstairs. When she went downstairs, she saw Applicant trying to push her half-
naked  sister  out  the  door.  They  left  the  apartment.  After  they  returned,  as  they  were
gathering Ms. X’s belongings, the sister saw a handgun in the nightstand in Applicant’s
and  her  sister’s  bedroom.  The  sister  left  the  apartment  with  some  of  Ms.  X’s  clothes.
The  door  locked  when  she  left.  The  sister  pounded  on  the  door  until  Ms.  X  came
running out  saying they had  to  leave  immediately.  The sister stated  that  Ms. X looked
terrified when she ran out and yelled “leave the stuff; I’m going to die, so let’s just GO!”
Ms.  X  told  her  sister  that  “he  is  going  to  kill  me,  I  know  he  is.”  Ms.  X  told  her  that
Applicant put the gun to her forehead and made the clicking noise so it could shoot. The
sister never saw Applicant with the gun. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
Ms. X  called  a  friend  to  see  if  she  and  her sister could  stay  with  the  friend. Ms. X
and   her  sister  went  to   the   friend’s  house.   Ms.  X   told  him   that   Applicant  had   been
physical  with   them.  The   friend   stated   that  they   left  after  about   30   minutes.  He   later
received a call from Ms. X who told him that Applicant held a gun to her head and kept
her from leaving. (GE 4)
Police  were  dispatched  at  about  0755,  and  they  met  Ms.  X  and  her  sister  at  a
commercial  establishment  at  about 0810. The  above  facts  are  derived  from  the  police
reports  of  the  incident.  Ms.  X  gave  them  permission  to  search  the  apartment.  They
found an unregistered semi-automatic pistol in the nightstand drawer. It was unloaded,
but  a  magazine  with  nine  rounds  of  ammunition  was  also  in  the  nightstand.  An  extra
empty magazine and ten more rounds were found in the closet. The police took pictures
of  everything,  including  what  they  described  as  bruises  or  abrasions  on  Ms.  X’s  right
calf and right knee. (GE 3, 4)
Applicant was arrested and charged with kidnapping, carrying or use of a firearm
in the commission of a separate felony, and abuse of family or household member. The
arrest also included a charge of having an unregistered firearm, but the prosecution did
not pursue that charge. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 12)
A  restraining  order  was  issued  forbidding  Applicant  from  contacting  Ms.  X.  He
was arrested in August 2014 for violating the order. Applicant denied violating the order,
and the charge was dismissed. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 12)
Ms.  X  was  at  the  prosecuting  attorney’s  office  on  March  3,  2015,  preparing  for
trial. A member of the prosecution team noticed that she had bruising on her arms and
legs.  The  police  were  called  and  interviewed  Ms.  X.  A  victim  witness  advocate  was
present during the interview. (GE 5)
Ms. X told the police that Applicant was her boyfriend. She reported that she was
at his apartment on March 2, 2015, when they got in an argument at about 0800 over
laundry.  He  yelled  at her,  and  she  pushed  him  to  get  him  out  of  her face.  He  pushed
her, causing her to fall backwards on her elbows. He also punched her in the thigh. The
police officer reported bruises on Ms. X’s arms and  legs, including one that was five to
six inches in diameter, which she stated came from the punch to the thigh. Ms. X stated
that she was using Applicant’s vehicle, but she wanted to return it so that he would not
report  it  stolen.  Applicant  was  charged  with  abuse  of  family  or  household  member.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 5, 11, 12)
Applicant pled not guilty to  the April 2014 charges  at a jury trial in  March 2015.
Ms.  X’s  testimony  was  somewhat  similar  to  her  statements  to  the  police,  except  she
testified  that  she  ended  up  on  the  ground  before  Applicant  started  pulling  her  by  the
ankles, but she could not remember how she got there. She remembered that Applicant
held a gun, but  she could not  remember if he threatened her with  it. She testified that
she  and  Applicant  had  been  in  contact  on  multiple  occasions  since  the  incident  in  an
attempt  to  work  things  out  in  their  relationship.  They  talked  about  her  testifying  in  his
trial, but she could not remember what was said. She testified that they were no longer
in a relationship, but she still loved him and wanted what was best for him. (Applicant’s
response to SOR)
Ms.  X’s  sister’s  testimony  was  mostly  consistent  with  her  statements  to  the
police,  except  she  testified  that  she  did  not  witness  aggressive  physical  contact
between Applicant and her sister. (Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant  was  convicted  on  March  19,  2015,  of  the  lesser  offense  of  unlawful
imprisonment in the second degree and abuse of family or household member. He was
found  not  guilty  of  the  firearm  offense.  Sentencing  was  set  for  May  2015.  (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 7, 11, 12)
Ms.  X  called  the  police  from  a  location  not  far  from  Applicant’s  apartment  at
about  1930  on  April  5,  2015.  Applicant  also  called  the  police  from  his  apartment  at
about  the  same  time.  Ms.  X  told  the  police  that  Applicant  was  her boyfriend,  and  that
they had been dating for about a year and five months and lived together for the last five
months. She stated that they were arguing at the top of the stairs when he pushed her,
and she fell down  about  three to four steps before she  caught  herself.  She noted that
part of the stairs was broken in the fall. Applicant threw her phone in the toilet, and he
punched  her  several  times  in  the  face.  The  police  took  photos  of  her  injuries,  which
included  abrasions  on  her face,  and  her eye  was  swollen  to  the point  of  being  almost
closed. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6)
Applicant was arrested for abusing a family member, criminal property damage,
and interference  with  the  reporting of  an emergency.  He  was  released on $3,000 bail.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 12)
Applicant  was  sentenced  for  the  April  2014  charges  on  May  27,  2015.  He  was
sentenced to probation for one year for the first count and two years for the second, to
run  concurrently.  A  term  of  the  probation  included  imprisonment  for  seven  days,  with
credit for time served. The case was overturned on appeal in May 2018 for prosecutorial
misconduct based on remarks made by the prosecutor in closing argument suggesting
that Applicant’s counsel attempted to induce Ms. X to give false testimony during cross-
examination.  The  appellate  court  found  no  basis  to  support  the  prosecutor’s  remarks.
The conviction was overturned without prejudice, so Applicant could have faced another
trial. The charges were eventually dismissed without another trial. (Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 1, 2, 7, 11, 12)
Applicant was found not guilty of the April 2015 charges in September 2015. The
March 2015 charge was dismissed in October 2015. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1, 2, 12)
Applicant  was  issued  a  military  protective  order  (MPO)  by  his  commander  in
early  March  2015  to  not  initiate  any  contact  or  communication  with  Ms.  X  and  to  not
come  within  500  feet  of  her.  On  October  2,  2015,  he  received  nonjudicial  punishment
under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of  Military Justice, for violating  the commander’s
order on  divers occasions from  March  6,  2015, to April 5, 2015, by coming within  500
feet  of  Ms.  X  and  by  calling  her.  He  was  reduced  one  paygrade  to  E-5;  ordered  to
perform extra duties for 45 days; and forfeited $1,562 in pay per month for one month.
He  did  not  appeal  the  punishment.  Applicant  stated  he  accepted  the  nonjudicial
punishment and  an  other than honorable  discharge  as part of  a deal to  avoid a  court-
martial. He stated that the serious offense that was the basis of the discharge was the
violation of the MPO. (Tr. at 45, 62-68, 94-96; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 9)
Applicant  denied  that he  ever assaulted  Ms.  X.  He  stated  that  their relationship
was already over in April 2014, and he just let her stay in the apartment until she could
move  out.  Her  sister  was  there  to  help  with  the  move.  He  asserted  that  she  attacked
him in April 2014 and the most he did was grab her arms so that she could not hit him.
He admitted that he had an unregistered firearm, but he stated that he never picked up
the gun that day, and that the gun was in the nightstand, but the magazine was in the
closet.  The  police  report  indicates  that  the  loaded  magazine  was  in  the  nightstand
drawer  with the gun. He denied that they had any romantic involvement after the April
2014 incident. (Tr. at 14-23, 56-65, 70-87; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-4)
Applicant stated that Ms. X essentially stalked him for the next year, calling him
frequently  from  new  and  other  people’s  numbers,  sending  texts,  and  showing  up
unannounced at his apartment.  He submitted a muster report showing he was on duty
on  March  2,  2015,  at  the  time  she  said  he  assaulted  her.  (Tr.  at  14-23,  56-65;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, B)
Applicant  asserted  that  Ms.  X  left  some  items  at  the  apartment  after  she  left  in
April 2014. He was told that  he had to return the items. He agreed to leave them in a
box  outside  the  apartment  door.  She  showed  up  on  April  5,  2015,  and  knocked  and
rang his doorbell for about an hour. She then somehow forced her way in and attacked
him.  He  stated  that  the  damage  to  the  apartment  was  caused  by  her.  He  called  the
police, but he was the one arrested. He testified that he showed the police everything,
but  the  police  would  not  take  a  report  from  him.  (Tr.  at  23-34,  53-56,  61;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 6, AE A) The police report indicates that Applicant was advised in
writing  of  his  constitutional  right  to  remain  silent  (Miranda  rights)  at  2230  on  April  5,
2015.  He  initialed  next  to  the  section  that  indicated  he  did  not  want  to  tell  the  police
what happened. (GE 6) I did not find his testimony credible.
Except for the incidents that involved Ms. X in one way or another, Applicant had
an excellent military career. Several military members believe that he was set up by Ms.
X, and that he was treated unfairly by his command. He is praised for his outstanding
performance  of  military  duties,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness.  As  part  of  the  Security
Access Eligibility Report (SAER) submitted by his command in April 2014, his command
reported:
1.  Excellence   of   character:   [Applicant]  has  displayed  unquestionable  integrity,
excellent military bearing and an enthusiasm to excel in his technical field.
2. Stability: Since checking onboard in January 2012 [Applicant] has shown no
traits that could be identified as unstable. He has displayed excellent timeliness,
excelled at work tasks, and has maintained a positive attitude.
3.  Other   comments/observations:   The  alleged  actions  are  extremely  out  of
character for [Applicant]. (GE 10)
Applicant’s command provided similar comments in an April 2015 SAER. (GE 11)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations under Guidelines
J and D, with exculpatory explanations. He did not expressly admit or deny the Guideline
E allegations, which cross-allege the allegations under Guidelines J and D.  His limited
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact and discussed in more detail below.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  business  systems  analyst  employed  by  defense
contractors since December 2017. He was terminated by another defense contractor in
May  2019  for  using  a  government  computer  for  personal  email  and  was  briefly
unemployed. (Tr. 111-12.) He worked for other defense contractors from June 2019 until
he was hired by his current employer in April 2020. He received a security clearance in
August 2019. (Tr. 120-21.)
Applicant was born in a foreign country. He immigrated to the United States with
his mother and two sisters in 1991, and his father stayed behind in their native country.
Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2014. (Tr. 22.) He graduated from high school in 2001,
attended college for one semester, and then enlisted in the  U.S. Navy. (Tr. 23-24.) He
served on active duty in the Navy from January 2002 to December 2017 and received a
general discharge under honorable conditions. While on active duty, he received the Navy
and Marine Corps Achievement Medal five times, the Good Conduct Medal three times,
and  multiple  service  ribbons  and  qualification  badges.  (AX  E.)  He  received  a  security
clearance in about 2012. (Tr. 30.) He has a 90% disability for multiple stress injuries to
his limbs, feet, and back, as well as depression and anxiety. (Tr. 34-35.)
Applicant married in February 2015, separated in December 2018, and divorced
in  March  2020.  He  has  a  16-year-old  daughter  from  a  previous  relationship  and  two
children with his ex-wife, ages eight and six. (Tr. 26.)
In 2008, Applicant was charged with felony kidnapping and assault. In his answer
to the SOR, he admitted he was charged, but he denied that he was guilty. He testified
that he was in a relationship with an older woman and the relationship became toxic when
she started having conversations with an ex-boyfriend. During an argument, he attempted
to leave their residence, but she blocked the door. She hit him, scratched him, and spat
at him. He grabbed her by both arms and pinned her down on the bed. After he released
her and started to leave, she called the police. Applicant waited in his car for the police to
arrive, believing that she would be arrested. (Tr. 55-59.) Court records reflect that he was
found  not  guilty  of  felony  kidnapping.  Disposition  was  deferred  on  the  assault  charge,
conditioned  on  him  having  no  contact  with  the  woman  for  one  year.  After  a  year  had
passed, the assault charge was dismissed. (GX 4 at 1-2.)
In 2010, Applicant was charged with destruction of property. In his answer to the
SOR,  he  stated  that  his  cohabitant  was  upset  about  his  long  working  hours  and  she
changed the lock on the door of their residence while he was at work. He came home
from work at about 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. and found that his cohabitant had changed the door
lock. He called the police and showed the police officer a bank statement reflecting that
he lived there. According to Applicant, the police officer advised him that he was entitled
to break in and recover his belongings but that he might be responsible for repairing the
door. He broke in, retrieved some clothing and personal affects, put them in his car, and
left. (Tr. 61-64.) He was charged with intentional damage to property. He was convicted
and  sentenced  to  30  days  in  jail  (suspended)  and  unsupervised  probation.  He  was
required to pay restitution to repair the door. (GX 4 at 2.) In his answer to the SOR and at
the hearing, he stated that the judge told him  to take his legal advice from an attorney
and not from a police officer. (Tr. 65.)
In 2012, Applicant, then a petty officer first class,  was accused of  sodomizing a
female shipmate, a petty officer second class, without her consent. He admitted having
anal intercourse  with  the female  sailor,  but he maintained  that  it was  consensual. The
female  sailor  recanted  her  initial  complaint  and  stated  that  they  initially  engaged  in
consensual anal intercourse, but that she changed her mind and tried to move away but
did not tell Applicant to stop. Investigators concluded that the female sailor’s accusation
was unfounded. Applicant’s commander imposed nonjudicial punishment on both parties
for violating an order prohibiting sexual activity between sailors on the ship. Applicant’s
punishment  was  a  reduction  from  petty  officer  first  class  to  petty  officer  second  class,
restriction  for  45  days,  45  days  of  extra  duty,  and  forfeiture  of  one  half  of  his  pay  per
month for two months. The female sailor’s punishment was forfeiture of one half of her
pay for two months, and her recommendation for advancement was withdrawn. (GX 2 at
1-2.)
At  some  time  not  reflected  in  the  record,  Applicant  was  promoted back  to  petty
officer first class. In July 2016, while Applicant was still married, he  was accused by a
female sailor, a petty officer second class, of sexual harassment by “play fighting” with
her, placing his hands around her neck and shaking her, and putting his hand on her thigh
while they were riding in a military vehicle. Applicant testified that he and the female sailor
worked  together and became friendly.  According  to  Applicant,  their  friendship  became
flirtatious and “semi-sexual,” to the point where she sent him “racy” photos of herself. He
denied asking the female sailor to have sex with him. (Tr.  36-40.) He believes that the
female sailor made a report of sexual harassment in order to obtain a reassignment. (Tr.
42.)  However,  he  admitted  at  the  hearing  that,  even  if  there  had  been  no  sexual
harassment,  his relationship  with  the female  sailor was  inappropriate.  (Tr. 46.)  In April
2017, he received nonjudicial punishment for sexual harassment. He was reduced from
petty  officer  first  class  to  petty  officer  second  class  and  processed  for  administrative
separation.  (GX  2  at  3-4.)  In  December  2017,  he  received  a  general  discharge  under
honorable conditions. (AX E.)
Applicant and his wife separated in December 2018 and divorced in March 2020.
Applicant testified that after the divorce, his ex-wife would taunt him by calling him while
she  was  having  sex  with  her  boyfriend,  sending  him  photos  of  her  and  her  boyfriend
having sex, and threatening him with violence. She told their son that he would never see
his father again because she intended to make sure that he would go to jail. (Tr. 70-71.)
Applicant’s divorce attorney described his ex-wife as “one of the most spiteful, vindictive
and  caustic personalities I’ve  come across in 19 years of representing clients in family
law issues.” (AX I.)
After Applicant and his wife separated, she moved out of the family home, but she
left  clothing and other possessions  in the home.  In early March  2019, after  repeatedly
asking  her  to  remove  her  belongings,  Applicant  decided  to  come  up  with  the  most
hyperbolic statement he could think of to get her attention, and he  told his wife that he
would  burn  her  possessions  if  she  did  not  remove  them  from  the  home.  (Tr.  72.)  She
responded  to  the  threat  by  obtaining  a  protective  order  on  March  7,  2019,  with  an
expiration date of March 11, 2019. (GX 3 at 7-8.)
On  March  10, 2019, Applicant’s  wife  accused  Applicant  of threatening  to  kill  her
sister and  injure her  son,  and  Applicant was charged  with  violating  the  protective  order
and  using  profane  and  threatening  language. (GX  3  at 9.) Applicant denied  making  threats
or using  profane  and  threatening  language. (Tr. 80.)  He  testified  that when  his  son  was
three  or four years old, he  was afraid  of  many  things, and  Applicant  encouraged  him  to
confront his fear.  Applicant testified  that he  would ask his son,  “Why  are you  scared  of
this? You  want daddy  to  beat it up?” During  a  video  telephone  call, his son  said that he
was afraid  of  “auntie” and  his mother’s older son’ Appellant’s wife  heard the  conversation
and  interpreted  it  to mean  that  Applicant  offered  to beat up  “auntie” and  her son.  (Tr.  81-
82.)
Applicant’s  wife  obtained  another  protective  order  on  May  1,  2019,  prohibiting
“hostile  contact”  with  his  wife  and  prohibiting  all  contact  with  her  son.  On  May  10,
Applicant was charged with violating the order. (GX 3 at 10.) The record does not reflect
the  factual  basis  for  this  charge.  On  May  30,  2019,  the  charge  was  dismissed  due  to
insufficient evidence. (GX 3 at 3, 11.) The protective order violation was nolle prosequi
on May 30, 2019. (GX 4 at 2; AX I at 1.)
Another  show  cause  order  was  issued  against  Applicant  in  August  2019  for
violating  protective  orders.  The  evidentiary  basis  for  this  order  appears  to  have  been
Applicant’s  unwelcome  visits  and  messages  regarding  visitation  with  his  son.  When
Applicant learned that he was charged with violating protective orders, he turned himself
in. (Tr. 77-78.) In November 2019, his wife’s attorney requested that the show cause order
be removed from the hearing docket because the parties had resolved the matter. (AX F;
Tr. 157.) The show cause order was dismissed in on November 19, 2019. (GX 3 at 15.)
Applicant and his ex-wife now communicate solely by email. (Tr. 97.)
In  his  post-hearing  submission,  Applicant  submitted  screen  shots  of  Facebook
pages and film clips showing his ex-wife’s boyfriend belittling him, threatening him, and
harassing him when he met with his ex-wife to pick up his son for visitation. (AX L, M, and
N.)  In  September  2020,  the  boyfriend  accused  Applicant  of  assaulting  him.  Applicant
testified that he was in front of a police station waiting to pick up his son from his ex-wife,
when the boyfriend began directing abusive language toward him and attempted to block
him for leaving his car. Applicant had agreed to pick up his son for visitation in front of the
police station instead of  the daycare center  because his ex-wife had suggested it. (Tr.
162.) Applicant was able to get past the boyfriend, and he went into the police station and
filed a complaint against the boyfriend. The police reviewed the camera footage from the
front  of  the  police  station  and  charged  the  boyfriend  with  assault.  The  boyfriend  then
accused Applicant of assault. On March 10, 2021, both parties agreed to withdraw their
complaints, and the charge against Applicant was dismissed. (AX H; Tr. 91-95.)
When Applicant filed his complaint against his ex-wife’s boyfriend, he discovered
that his ex-wife had filed a complaint in another jurisdiction, alleging violation of the May
2019  order prohibiting “hostile contact.” At the  hearing, Applicant admitted  violating the
order when he responded to hostile emails and messages by calling her “a lot of choice
words.”  He  was  charged  with  using  profane  and  threatening  language.  The  trial  was
delayed by COVID-19. In September 2021, he pleaded “no contest” and was sentenced
to one day in jail. (Tr. 88-89.)
Applicant sought and received therapy from about June 2019 to January 2020. He
testified that he realizes that he was bitter because he wanted to keep the family together
but his ex-wife refused to do her part. (Tr. 155.) He now attends church regularly and has
a good relationship with his pastor. (Tr. 99.) He also has increased his contact with his
parents,  nieces,  nephews,  and  sister  for  guidance  and  support.  He  has  established
contact  with  his father,  who  remained  in  Applicant’s  country  of  birth, and  has  received
helpful guidance about dealing with his personal problems. (Tr. 98-103.) He testified that
he has learned that his ex-wife “knows exactly how to push my buttons.” (Tr. 184.) In his
group therapy sessions, he has learned from people having similar issues and hearing
how they deal with them. He knows that if he gets upset, he has enough support from his
family, his church, and his therapists to help him deal with it. (Tr. 188.)
A former shipmate who has known Applicant for more than 17 years respects him
as a former mentor and a trustworthy friend. (AX D at 4.) Applicant’s immediate supervisor
for the past four years describes him as energetic, hard-working, reliable, honest, mature,
and patient. (AX D at 1.) Another supervisor, a retired Navy commander, describes him
as thoughtful, kind, poised, reliable, and mature. (AX D at 2.) Applicant recently received
an “impact” financial award for performing “above and beyond what is expected.” (AX C.)

"Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f, and 2.a and 2.b. He
denied  the  SOR  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  3.a,  3.b  and  4.a.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 28 years old. He is a high school graduate. He attended community
college from January 2012 to May 2012. He attended another college from August 2014
to  May  2017.  He  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  acquired  student  loans  to  help  fund  his
education. In his October 2020 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed that he
has worked for a federal contractor since May 2018 and also works part-time in another
job since August 2020. Applicant is not married and has no children. (Item 3)
Section 26 of Applicant’s October 2020 SCA asked if in the past seven years he
had any debts turned over to a collection agency? He answered “No.” The SOR alleges
in  ¶¶  1.a through 1.f  federal student  loan accounts that  were  placed  in  collection. The
alleged debts total approximately $32,340. (Items 5, 6, 7)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in March 2021. Applicant
denied to the investigator having any delinquent federal debt or debts turned  over to a
collection  agency  in  the  last  seven  years.  He  was  then  confronted  with  his  delinquent
student loans that were in collection. He explained that he attended college and took out
student  loans.  He  said  the  creditors  never  contacted  him  and  he  never  contacted  the
creditors. He said he called Credit Karma and his accounts were listed as closed. He took
no further action at that point to repay the loans. He had not closed the accounts. He told
the  investigator  that  he  had  no  reason  for  failing  to  repay  the  student  loans.  He  had
planned to go back to school, but never had the time. (Item 9)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  delinquent  student  loans  and
said he had contacted the creditor and the debts were now consolidated. He stated that
the creditor “gave me a monthly estimate of [$]167/month, which can easily be done.” He
provided no documentary evidence to show he has an agreement with the creditor, that
he started to make payments, or has taken any other action to resolve the debts. (Item 2)
Applicant denied that he deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent student loans
on  his  SCA  in  response  to  section  26.  He  stated  that  he  had  an  interview  with  a
government investigator and said: “When I had the Zoom call [with] the investigator, she
alerted me. I told her I thought it had been handled, after it disappeared from my credit
report. The student loans are the reason my credit score is as low as it is.” (Items 2, 9)
Applicant’s August 2020 credit report reflects the student loans alleged in the SOR
are in a collection status. His credit report from January 2021 also reflects the student
loans are in collection status and have been delinquent since about 2018. His March 2022
credit report shows each student loan as past due and in collection status. (Items 5, 6, 7)
Applicant told the investigator that his finances were fine and he was working two
jobs. He did not have other delinquent debts. He did not list his student loans because
they appeared as closed on his credit report. He lives within his means and will try and
set up a payment plan for this student loans. (Item 9)
Applicant was arrested  in August 2019  and  charged  with  Driving  While  Intoxicated
(DWI). He  was arrested  and  charged  in October 2019  for Contempt  of  Court: Failure to
Appear. Applicant  admitted   he   was  arrested   and   charged   with   DWI  and   described   the
incident  as  an  “outlier.” (Item  2) He  said  he  went to  driving  school, paid  the  court fines,
and  had  his  license  suspended  for a  year. Court documents reflect  he  also  received  a  90-
day jail sentence that  was suspended. (Item  8)
Applicant said it has been three years since the DWI offense and he has not had
another incident. He denied he has a problem with alcohol and said that the DWI was a
first  offense.  He  said  he  disclosed  the  DWI  to  his  security  manager  the  day  after  it
occurred. The Continuous Evaluation Report reflects on January 15, 2020, the DWI and
failure to appear arrests were validated.  He admitted he made a mistake and paid the
price. (Items 4, 8)
Applicant denied that he was arrested for failing to appear in court and said it was
a misunderstanding he had with his attorney. Court documents reflect that he was found
guilty of failing to appear and was fined $150 and court costs of $87. (Item 8)

Personal Conduct
1.a.,  2.a.,  and  4.a.  Applicant  admits  that  from  about  January  of  2009  to  about
January  2014,  he  hired  an  escort  service  four  or  five  times  a  year  for  the  purpose  of
engaging in sexual intercourse. Applicant further admits that once in 2019 and once again
in  2020,  he  hired  an  escort  service  for the  purpose  of  engaging  in  sexual  intercourse.
Applicant’s spouse and family are not aware of his use of an escort service.
1.b.,  and  4.a.  Applicant admits that from  about 2010  to  2011, he  engaged  in an
extramarital affair  with  a  dancer at  a  strip  club  for approximately  six  months.  Applicant’s

this tax  arrearage, as documented  by  correspondence  with  the  Internal Revenue  Service
(IRS). (Response)
3.b.  Applicant was indebted to  a state taxing authority for back taxes for tax years
2013  and  2014  in the  amount of  about $16,266. He is making  monthly  payments of  $400
towards  this   tax   arrearage,  as   documented   by   correspondence   with   the   state   taxing

"Applicant, age 72, is married with four adult children. He received his high school
diploma in 1968 and an associate degree in 1984. He has been employed as an electronic
technician by a defense contractor since 2007. This is his first application for a security
clearance. (Item 3)
In  April 1989, Applicant  was  charged  with  engaging in  34 felony counts of  lewd
acts upon a child. In August 1989, those charges were amended to 18 counts and then
to 16 counts. In August 1989, Applicant, represented by counsel, pled guilty to 1 felony
count (count #15, as amended) for which he was convicted. The other 15 counts were
dismissed. The following is the count to which he pled guilty:
COUNT – 15 LEWD ACT UPON A CHILD
On  and  between  August  1,  1988  and  August  30,  1988  [Applicant]  did
willfully, unlawfully, and lewdly commit a lewd and lascivious act upon and
with  the  body  and  certain  parts  and  members  thereof  of  [Child],  a  child
under the age of fourteen years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to,
and gratifying the lust, passions, and sexual desires of the said defendant
and the said child (to wit: Defendant touches Victim’s breasts), in violation
of [state law].
In   support  of   his  guilty   plea,  Applicant  endorsed   the   following   handwritten   statement
acknowledging  his crime: “On  or about 8/1/88  through  8/30/88, I touched  the  breasts of  a
child  under the  age  of  fourteen  years with  the  intent of  gratifying  my  sexual desires.”  (Item
3 at 48;  Item  6 at 6-12, 28-29, 33, 47-53,  108-119)
In November 1989, Applicant was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to
pay a $100 fine. The maximum penalty was eight years in prison and a $10,000 fine. For
reasons  not  indicated  in  the  record,  Applicant  was  released  from  prison  in  about
November 1992, at which time he was registered as a sexual offender with no expiration
date. In his Answer, Applicant admitted that he has been a registered sex offender since
November 1992. (Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 5, 24, 28)
On  his  SCA,  Applicant  reported  that  he  pled  guilty,  in  about  August  1989,  to  a
felony child sex offense involving a girl under the age of 14; and that he was incarcerated
from  about  August  1989  through  September 1992.  In  connection  with  the  background
investigation prompted by his SCA, he was interviewed three times: twice in November
2018 and once in August 2019. He  discussed matters relevant to the SOR allegations
during the first interview in November 2018 (Interview 1) and the August 2019 interview
(Interview 3), including his version of the facts and circumstances underlying his arrest
and conviction. (Items 3, 4)
Initially during Interview 1, Applicant explained that the child sex offense for which
he was arrested involved him showering with the daughter of his wife’s friend, who was
then only 13 years old (minor child). He claimed that he did not do anything else with the
minor child. When asked to provide further information about the incident, he refused to
do so on the basis that all he did was shower and could not remember all of the details
since it occurred so long ago. (Item 4 at 9)
Subsequently  during  Interview  1, Applicant provided  some  additional details. He
maintained  that his wife’s friend  saw  him  showering  with  the  minor child  and  called  the
police, which resulted  in  his arrest.  He  explained  that  his wife’s friend  and  the  minor child
were living  with  him  at  the  time. He  believed  that  he  was rightfully  arrested  and  should
not have  been  showering  with  someone  that young. He  asserted  that  he  was not thinking
at the  time  and  afterwards realized  it was a  mistake. He did  not know  why  he  thought it
was okay to  do  it at the  time. He  stated  that,  after pleading  guilty   to  the   one  child  sex
offense, he  was sentenced  to  three  years in prison, which he  served  from  August  1989
to  September  1992.  He  confirmed that he  was registered as a  sex  offender, as required.
He asserted  that it  was a  one-time  offense  and  that  he  had  not had  any  other  negative
interactions with  law  enforcement or engaged  in  any  other  criminal  activity.  (Item  4  at  9-
10)
During Interview 3,  Applicant  claimed that  his  wife  (who  had then been  living in
another country with their children) asked him to allow her friend to live with him so that
her friend could escape an abusive husband. He stated that he took his wife’s friend and
her two children (including the minor child and her son) in like family. (Item 4 at 11-12)
Court  records  reflect  that  the  results  of  the  prosecution’s  investigation  largely
contradicted the Applicant’s version of events. The prosecution’s investigation found that
Applicant engaged in substantially more unlawful sexual activity with the minor child than
the one for which he was convicted, and that those acts occurred over an extended period
of  time.  Among  the  court  records  was  a  pleading  containing  a  statement  of  facts,
endorsed by Applicant’s counsel, that acknowledged that Applicant was the boyfriend of
the  minor  child’s  mother,  and  that  the  minor  child  and  her  mother  referred  to  him  as
“father.” (Item 6 at 6-12, 14-24, 47-53, 75-76, 86-87, 109-119)
Another court record revealed that Applicant’s wife and four children (including two
daughters, then ages 12 and 14) arrived in the United States in about July 1989. At that
time, Applicant’s bail conditions were temporarily modified to prohibit him from residing in
the same home as his wife and children, and to require that any visitation with his children
be supervised by a court-approved agency. During Interview 1, Applicant confirmed that
he did not get to see his children for a long period of time. The record did not otherwise
indicate the specific duration for which his residence and visitation with his children were
restricted. The record also did not indicate whether any restrictions or obligations followed
his  release  from  prison,  including  any  period  of  probation  (besides  requiring  him  to
register as a sex offender). (Item 6 at 66, 69, 76)
In  Applicant’s  Answer,  he  admitted  the  facts  alleged  under  Guidelines  H  and  J
involving his arrest and conviction. In response to the Guideline E allegation (SOR ¶ 3.a)
involving falsification of facts during Interview 1, he wrote “I admit.” However, I construed
his  response  as  a  denial  because,  in  the  explanation  accompanying  his  response,  he
denied any deliberate intent due, in part, to English being his second language. He also
claimed that he did his best to answer all questions during his background investigation
interviews, while also stating that he “did not give them the detail of that [sic].”

"The SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR ¶ 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline
J (SOR ¶ 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR ¶ 4.b) that Applicant was convicted of driving under
the  influence  (DUI)  or  operating  under  the  influence  (OUI)  offenses  committed  in  July
2013  (SOR ¶ 1.b), April 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.c), and August 2015  (SOR ¶ 1.d). Also under
Guideline G, Applicant allegedly consumed alcohol at times to excess and to intoxication
since about 2013 to at least December 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a); was separated from the Army
National Guard Reserve (ARNG) because of his alcohol-related offenses; and received
treatment from November 2015 to January 2016 for diagnosed addictive disorder-alcohol
abuse and attention deficit disorder (SOR ¶ 1.f) and from February 2016 to April 2016 for
substance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (SOR ¶ 1.g).
The   SOR  alleges  under  Guideline   H  (SOR  ¶   3.a),  and   cross-alleges  under
Guideline  J  (SOR ¶  2.b), that  Applicant  used  cocaine  with  varying  frequency  from  about
September  2013   to   at  least  September  2015   while   granted   access  to   classified
information  (SOR ¶  3.b).  His use  of cocaine  while  granted  access  to  classified  information
was also cross-alleged  under  Guideline  E  (SOR ¶  4.a).  Also  under Guideline  E,  Applicant
allegedly   falsified   his  June   30,  2018   Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations
Processing   (hereafter  SF  86)  by   responding   negatively   to   inquiries  concerning   any
delinquency  regarding  routine  accounts  (SOR  ¶  4.c). Under Guideline  F, the  SOR alleges
that   Applicant owed,  as  of   May   21,  2021,  three   charged-off   debts for $24,833   (SOR  ¶
5.a), $  830  (SOR ¶ 5.b), and  $53  (SOR ¶ 5.i); and  eight  collection debts for $185  (SOR ¶
5.c), $572  (SOR ¶  5.d), $1,493  (SOR ¶  5.e), $619  (SOR ¶  5.f), $1,188  (SOR ¶  5.g), $567
(SOR ¶ 5.h), $3,923 (SOR ¶ 5.j), and $469 (SOR ¶ 5.k).
When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations but indicated
that he did not intentionally falsify his SF 86. Applicant asserted that he had abstained
from alcohol since December 5, 2019; that he sought help for his depression and is on
mental-health  medications;  and  that  he  had  paid  off  some  of  the  delinquent  debts,
including the debt in SOR ¶ 5.a.
Applicant’s admissions to abusing alcohol and committing drunk-driving offenses;
to receiving treatment for the diagnosed conditions; and to having owed the delinquent
debts are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings,
exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old high school graduate with some online college study.
(GE  1.)  He  has  never  married,  but  he  has  had  a  cohabitant  girlfriend  for  the  past  five
years.  She  has  two  children,  ages  17  and  20,  who  live  with  them.  (Tr.  29,  32,  81.)
Applicant has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since about June
2017. (GE 1.)
Applicant enlisted in the ARNG at age 17 in April 2004 (Tr. 32-33), and he served
until February 2016, when he was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions
because he had tested positive for cocaine and alcohol in a routine ARNG screening. (Tr.
35.) He appealed the character of his discharge, and it was later changed to honorable
based on his military service record. (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 35-36.) He was activated twice to
combat duty: from May 2006 through April 2007 and from July 2008 to May 2009. (AE B;
Tr. 33.) He was granted a security clearance shortly before his second deployment. (Tr.
34.) On his return from active duty, he worked full time for his state’s ARNG, which included
a deployment overseas from October 2012 to August 2013. (AE C.) In September 2013,
he lost his full-time job with the ARNG. He indicated on his June 2018 SF 86 that funding
for  his  full-time  position  with  the  ARNG  ran  out,  but  his  medical  records  from  the  VA
indicate that his job loss was because of his July 2013 DUI. (AE C.)
Substance Use  and Treatment
Applicant  drank  alcohol  in  high  school  “at  a  party  here  or  there.”  (Tr.  36.)  His
drinking to excess started in the summer of 2007. After he returned from being deployed,
he initially consumed alcohol in quantity of 30 beers and 750 ml of liquor per week. (AE
C.) He eventually moderated his consumption to social drinking, about twice a week, until
about April 2013. After he and his then-fiancée called off their relationship three months
before  they  were  to  marry  (Tr.  37),  he  began  to  turn  to  alcohol,  often  nightly,  to  self-
medicate for mental-health issues. (AE C; Tr. 25.)
After drinking four to five alcohol drinks while out at a casino with family members
one evening in July 2013, Applicant was stopped by police for swerving. He failed field
sobriety  tests  and  was  arrested  for  DUI.  He  pled  guilty,  was  granted  accelerated
rehabilitation,  placed  on  probation,  and  ordered  to  complete  100  hours  of  community
service and alcohol counseling. The charge was dismissed after he completed the terms.
(GE 2.)
Applicant’s July 2013 DUI was a factor in him losing his full-time job with the ARNG
around September 2013. He drank 750 ml of vodka per night early that winter before his
family intervened in January 2014, and he attended a two-week alcohol program. (AE C.)
From March 2014 to November 2014, he worked as a part-time bartender. (GEs 1, 2.) He
drank  alcohol  at  times  to  excess  and  used  cocaine  intermittently  in  combination  with
alcohol in that job. (Tr. 26, 44.) He used cocaine as the drug helped him sober up more
quickly from drinking. He found that the drug helped him drink more. (Tr. 42.)
Applicant consumed five to six alcohol drinks and three to four shots of liquor on
April  18,  2014,  while  talking  with  patrons  and  then  cleaning up  with  his manager  after
closing the bar. While driving home, he was stopped by the police, who smelled alcohol
on his breath. He failed a breathalyzer and was arrested for  DUI. (GEs 1-2.) Available
records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicate a re-arrest date of October
25, 2014; a disposition date of January 14, 2015; and a sentence of  six months in jail,
suspended, a $500 fine, one year of probation, and 100 hours of community service. (GE
6.)
Applicant was seen at a VA health center in May 2014 and referred to the facility’s
substance-abuse  clinic.  He  reported  an  escalation  of  alcohol  use  following  two
deployments and use of alcohol to avoid his mental-health problems. A toxicology screen
of  May  8,  2014  was  positive  for  cocaine.  While  attending  substance-abuse  outpatient
programs  at  the  VA  between  July  2014  and  September  2014,  he  continued  to  drink
alcohol once a week, about two to four drinks each time. His drinking adversely affected
his relationship with his family between April 2014 and February 2015. (AE C.)
Applicant was unemployed from about November 2014 to June 2015. He was not
engaged  in  any  substance-abuse  treatment  nor  seeing  a  psychiatrist  during  that  time.
(GE  1;  AE  C;  Tr.  25.)  On  March  6,  2015,  he  presented  at  a  VA  clinic  for  a  medical
screening for a research study. He showed signs of mild intoxication, and he reported a
history of  consuming two to three alcohol drinks per day. He described his drinking as
“out of control” in the recent past. He was advised to abstain from alcohol. (AE B.)
Applicant worked for a home-improvement retailer from April 2015 to August 2015.
He  told the VA in 2015  that he had been  sober, but he  subsequently admitted  in  May
2016 that he had been drinking the entire time. (AE C.) In August 2015, he started working
as a manager at a bar. (GE 1.) In addition to using alcohol, he used cocaine on occasion
to at least November 22, 2015. (GE 2; AE C.) He reported during a psychiatric consult at
the VA in May 2016 that he had “hired his cocaine dealer” when he managed the bar so
that he and his staff would have access to the drug “as needed.” At times, he slept on a
sofa at work and was late to his drill weekend because of drinking. (AE C.)
On August 31, 2015, Applicant crashed his scooter in route home after consuming
five to six alcohol drinks with a friend on the friend’s boat. He was charged with DUI and
with probation violation (two counts). (GE 6.) He testified that he was charged with being
a two-time first offender for the April 2014 and August 2015 DUIs in that he faced one
DUI charge for the August 2015 offense with the ramifications of two DUIs. (Tr. 38.) FBI
records show that, on April 27, 2016, he was convicted of  the August 2015 DUI and of
the violation of probation charges. On May 4, 2016, he was sentenced on the DUI charge
to six months in jail, one year of probation, and a $500 fine. He had to serve only ten days
in jail as the court accepted his attendance at a substance-abuse treatment program in
lieu of jail time. He was sentenced on the probation violation counts to two days in jail for
each  offense,  to  serve  concurrently.  (GE  6;  AE  C.)  He  was  also  required  to  have  an
interlock-type device in his vehicle. (GE 2; Tr. 28.) He testified that he fulfilled the terms
of his sentence, and the device was removed. (Tr. 78.)
On  September  17,  2015,  Applicant  went  to  a  VA  mental-health  clinic  seeking
substance-abuse  treatment.  He  reported  some  anxiety  and  exhibited  some  signs  of
minimization of the harm drinking had caused him. He reported drinking “only six drinks”
before his August 2015 DUI. He was placed on a trial dose of Lexapro and referred to an
outpatient alcohol and substance abuse program. (AE C.)
During a follow-up visit with his treating psychiatrist at his local VA clinic on October
19,  2015,  Applicant  reported  he  had  completed  seven  sessions  of  substance-abuse
treatment and had abstained from alcohol. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder
and PTSD (rule out), and was continued on Lexapro. (AE C.)
Applicant  quit  working  at  the  bar  in  November  2015  to  focus  on  his  alcohol
rehabilitation.  (GE  1.)  On  November  23,  2015,  he  went  to  a  VA  medical  center’s
psychiatric emergency department accompanied by his ARNG supervisor. Applicant had
been  late  to  a  military  drill  because  of  intoxication,  after  having  consumed  a  gallon  of
alcohol. He reported binge drinking of six to eight beers plus 750 ml of vodka or rum every
three weeks and consumption of lesser amounts several times per week, to as recently
as November 20, 2015. He complained of symptoms of PTSD and requested substance-
abuse treatment. He was admitted for observation for 23 hours, and was diagnosed with
alcohol use disorder (binge pattern) and PTSD.  Assessed as psychiatrically stable, he
was discharged on November 24, 2015, for immediate admission to a private inpatient
alcohol-treatment facility for alcohol detoxification. The records from that private treatment
facility were not submitted in evidence, but the VA records show that he was discharged
from the inpatient facility on December 1, 2015. (AE C.)
While residing in a sober-housing situation, Applicant received follow-up recovery-
support treatment in a VA intensive outpatient program (IOP) from December 2, 2015, to
December 23, 2015, for diagnosed alcohol use disorder (severe) and PTSD. In reviewing
his  options  for  follow-up  care  with  his  recovery  support  team  on  December  17,  2015,
Applicant expressed a desire to continue individual therapy to address his negative life
experiences, as his felt his alcohol and drug use stemmed from “defective ability to cope.”
He did not believe group substance-abuse treatment would be helpful to him, although
medical records show that he had demonstrated active listening skills in group sessions.
He  was  discharged  on  December  23,  2015,  to  follow-up  with  counseling  until  a  dual-
diagnosis  program  became  available,  and  to  continue  with  his  VA  psychiatrist.  At
discharge, Applicant indicated that he was “considerably” confident in his ability to abstain
from alcohol and drugs. He denied any cravings to use alcohol or drugs in the prior 30
days. (AE C.)
During a session with his VA psychiatrist on January 12, 2016, Applicant reported
that he had abstained from alcohol for 50 days with no cravings. On January 26, 2016,
he  was  determined  to  be  not  a  good  candidate  for  a  certain  dual-diagnosis  program
because  his  medical  record  did  not  adequately  support  the  PTSD  diagnosis.  He  was
accepted into another program through the VA to start on May 26, 2016, or earlier, if a
slot became available. (AE C.)
Applicant agreed to participate in  a once-weekly continuing care program at the
VA,  but  he  never  started  the  program.  He  told  the  VA  he  was  on  active-duty  orders
through February 23, 2016, and was unable to attend. In lieu of that program, he attended
individual  therapy  outside  the  VA  setting.  His  therapist  advised  the  VA  that,  after  six
weeks  of  therapy,  she  considered  Applicant  to  be  in  the  “pre-contemplative  stage”
regarding  his  drinking  and  in  some  denial.  VA  records  show  that  Applicant  consumed
alcohol on at least February 14, 2016. (AE C.)
On March 4, 2016, Applicant was admitted to a six-week specialized inpatient dual-
diagnosis  program  at  a  VA  facility  for  diagnosed  alcohol  dependence  and  PTSD.  A
breathalyzer  test  on  admission  was  negative  for any  alcohol.  Applicant  interacted  well
with peers and staff and attended all groups and classes with good participation. Clinical
opinion was positive for Applicant’s development of goals toward an overall improvement
in his lifestyle and his challenges. He was discharged as scheduled on April 15, 2016,
with a plan to continue cognitive behavioral therapy with his private therapist.  During a
psychiatric visit at the VA on April 19, 2016, Applicant reported that he had maintained
sobriety. (AE C.)
On May 16, 2016, Applicant was assessed at the VA to see if an increase in his
service-connected disability was warranted due to his mental-health issues. He reported
no alcohol consumption since February 14, 2016, and was diagnosed, in part, with PTSD
and alcohol use disorder, severe, in early remission. (AE C.)
Applicant became employed as a clerk at a gas station in June 2016. He was fired
in March 2017 for a violation of his employer’s policies unrelated to drinking. (GEs 1-2.)
Applicant then held a part-time job in maintenance for a daycare facility until he started
his current employment in June 2017. (GE 1.) He denies any drinking around that time,
but admits that he did not take his recovery as seriously as he should have. (Tr. 26.-27.)
After not drinking for approximately 18 months (AE C), he began drinking socially, “a drink
now  and  then  at  dinner,”  in  the  summer  of  2017.  (Tr.  47.)  Applicant  thought  he  could
control his drinking. (Tr. 50.)
On his June 2018 SF 86, Applicant disclosed that he received treatment for PTSD
for  about  two  months  in  2016.  He  listed  his three  DUIs  and  one  violation  of  probation
offense. Concerning an SF 86 inquiry into whether his use of alcohol had any negative
impact on his work performance, professional or personal relationships, his finances, or
resulted in law enforcement intervention, Applicant indicated that, in addition to the DUIs,
alcohol caused him problems between September 2013 and September 2015 in that his
relationships  with  family and  friends  suffered.  He  disclosed  that  he had  participated  in
alcohol-rehabilitation programs at the VA between November 2015 and January 2016.
(GE 1.)
In  response  to  an  SF  86  illegal  drug  inquiry,  he  reported  that  he  used  cocaine
infrequently and only when drinking between September 2013 and September 2016. He
responded affirmatively to an SF 86 inquiry into whether his drug use occurred when he
possessed a  security clearance.  He explained  that he self-medicated  with  alcohol and
sometimes cocaine when he was in a “rough place” in his life, but that he had checked
himself  into  rehabilitation,  was  taking  medications  to  control  his  PTSD,  and  going  to
support groups for his PTSD.  He  added that he  had  ended  all ties to  people  who  use
illegal drugs and drink heavily, and he denied any intention of returning to that lifestyle.
(GE 1.)
On  August  10,  2018,  Applicant  had  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an
authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He related that
he  was  drinking  alcohol,  despite  previous  treatment  for  alcohol  use.  He  described  his
current  consumption  as  one  or  two  drinks  per  month  at  family  functions,  usually
celebrations, which he did not consider to be abusive. He stated  that he  would “never”
again consume alcohol to the point where it impacted him negatively. (GE 2.)
As for his cocaine use, Applicant recalled during his PSI that he last used cocaine
around September 2015 and not September 2016. He stated that he used cocaine about
five times, in bar settings, while he held a security clearance. He denied any intention to
use  cocaine  in  the  future  because  of  his  “current  career”  and  stated  that  he  had  no
ongoing association with individuals who use the drug. (GE 2.) Applicant now asserts that
his  cocaine  use  occurred  between  September  2014  and  September  2015,  when  a
positive drug screen for cocaine led to his discharge from the ARNG in February 2016.
(Tr. 41.) VA records show he tested positive for cocaine on May 18, 2014, and again on
November 22, 2015. (AE C.) He now recalls that he first used cocaine on his birthday in
March 2014 and last used cocaine before he entered the dual-diagnosis program, which
VA records show started on March 4, 2016. (AE C; Tr. 44) He told the clinicians in the
dual-diagnosis program that he last used cocaine on November 22, 2015. The evidence
substantiates  that  he  used  cocaine  on  occasion  between  March  2014  and  at  least
November 2015 rather than from September 2013 to September 2015 as reported on his
SF 86, or from September 2014 to September 2015 as stated during his PSI.
Applicant’s  drinking  eventually  progressed  to  every  other  day  after  work.  He
testified at his hearing that it was not that he lacked control over his drinking at that time,
but  he  “thought  it  was  on  that  path.”  (Tr.  47-49.)  On  December  5,  2019,  Applicant
contacted his VA psychiatrist and reported that “the drinking started back up” and that his
mental-health  medications  were  ineffective.  He  had  not  been  taking  his  psychiatric
medications. (AE B.)
On December 10, 2019, Applicant voluntarily sought treatment in the psychiatric
emergency room  at  the  VA for his alcohol use  disorder.  He felt  that  he  could  not  stop
drinking on his own and could not safely undergo detoxification at home. (Tr. 49-50.) He
was admitted overnight for observation prior to entering a substance-abuse day program.
A drug screen of December 10, 2019, detected no presence of illegal drugs. He reported
a last use of  cocaine some four years prior, but recent use of alcohol to a last use on
December 5, 2019. He described his drinking as “getting out of hand.” He used alcohol
to address issues of insomnia and anxiety, and reported consuming two bottles of vodka
every two to three days preceding his last use. He was discharged to a recovery-support
program  on December 11, 2019, with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  He was not
accepted for admission to a higher level of residential treatment as clinical opinion was
that his needs could be met at the lower level of care. (AE B.)
Applicant  attended  a  recovery-support  program,  which  included  group  day
sessions  starting  December  12,  2019,  in  the  same  substance-abuse  rehabilitation
program  he  had  attended  in  2015.  He  was  diagnosed  with  alcohol  dependence,
uncomplicated.  His  family  and  friends  were  supportive  of  his  recovery,  and  he  felt
extremely confident throughout treatment that he would not use alcohol or illegal drugs.
Initially, he reported that he was slightly bothered by cravings or urges to use alcohol. He
attended  and  participated  in  all  aspects  of  the  program,  including  group  sessions  of
December  17,  2019,  in  which  the  importance  of  medication  compliance  was  stressed,
and  December  30.  2019,  in  which  attending  self-help  meetings  after  discharge  was
encouraged.  He  remained  abstinent  from  alcohol  and  illegal  drugs,  as  confirmed  by
negative urine screens and breathalyzer tests. Clinicians assessed him as able to identify
and discuss triggers and urges, and having developed good coping skills to avoid relapse.
Applicant requested to follow up the program in an evening IOP outside the VA network.
At discharge to his home on January 6, 2020, he was referred to a community resource
for assistance with securing an IOP. He also planned to see his private therapist and his
psychiatrist at the local VA primary-care clinic. (AE B.)
During a January 7, 2020 session with his VA psychiatrist, Applicant reported that
he  had  become  complacent  with  social  alcohol  use  and  so  took  action  to  stop  using
alcohol.  He  expressed his intention  to  pursue  an  evening  IOP  and denied  any current
cravings or urges to use alcohol. Concerning his mental-health medications, he admitted
that he had discontinued taking his Depakote on his own. He was continued on Adderall
and cleared to return to work. (AE B.)
Applicant testified that he attended an IOP three nights per week for two months.
(Tr. 27, 51.) Records of that program are not in evidence. In response to interrogatories,
on  January  21,  2021,  Applicant  stated  that  his  alcohol  and  drug  use  was  “more  of  an
escape from underlying PTSD issue.” He indicated that he was “seeking counseling for
mental health due to PTSD still.” (GE 2.)
On July 27, 2020, Applicant was diagnosed by the VA with adult attention deficit
hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD).  He  currently  takes  bupropion  for  a  mood  disorder
diagnosed in February 2021 and Ritalin for his ADHD. (AEs B-C; Tr. 79.) He is currently
on a maintenance schedule where he sees his VA-appointed psychiatrist every two or
three  months.  He  is  not  currently  receiving  therapy  from  a  therapist.  He  last  saw  the
private  therapist  in  Spring  2021,  and  he  has  been  looking  for  a  new  therapist  without
success. (Tr. 51, 84.) He has requested an appointment with his VA psychiatrist because
of  increased  depression  over  the  last  month.  (Tr.  80.)  Notwithstanding  his  history  of
drinking  to  self-medicate  mental-health  issues,  he  does  not  believe  he  is  at  risk  of
relapsing into alcohol. (Tr. 80.)
Applicant is not  involved  in any  self-help  meetings such  as  Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA), but he  has participated  about once  a  week in  an  online  program  Smart Recovery,
which he states instructs on “more  modern coping skills and  techniques.” (Tr. 52-53.) He
signed  onto  Smart Recovery  in January  2020. (Tr. 53.)  He  denies any  consumption  of
alcohol since  December 5, 2019, and  any  intention  to  drink alcohol in the future. (Tr. 27-
28.)  His girlfriend  and  family  are his primary  support system. (Tr. 53.)  He testified  that his
job is also a significant deterrent to relapse. (Tr. 81.)
Finances
Applicant’s finances began to suffer around 2014 and 2015, when he was drinking
heavily.  He  testified  that  all  of  his  money  went  to  fight  cancer.  (Tr.  54.)  Available  VA
records  do  not  show a  cancer diagnosis (AEs  B-C),  and  he  presented  no  evidence of
medical payments. Periods of unemployment were a factor in him being unable to meet
some of his expenses. (Tr. 54.)
Applicant  responded  affirmatively  on  his  June  2018  SF  86  to  inquiries  into  any
delinquency involving enforcement. He listed one debt of $20,000, for which his pay was
garnished. At the time, he believed it was a credit-card debt, but he recalled during his
August 2018 PSI that it was a car-loan deficiency balance. (GE 2.) About steps to satisfy
the debt, he indicated on his SF 86, “I had no clue about it. . . talking with lawyer to get it
resolved  sooner.”  He  answered  “No”  to  the  SF  86  questions  about  any  delinquency
involving  routine  accounts,  but  added,  “Besides  previously  stated  not  that  I  can
remember.” (GE 1.)
As  of  July  14,  2018,  Applicant’s  credit  report  (GE  5)  showed  the  delinquent
accounts listed in SOR ¶¶ 5.a.-5.j. As of April 9, 2020 (GE 4), his credit report showed an
additional  delinquency  (SOR  ¶  5.k).  The  delinquency  and  payment  histories  for  the
accounts are reflected in the following table:

During his August 2018 PSI, Applicant was confronted about the delinquencies on
his credit  report. About  the previously disclosed  garnishment, Applicant  stated  that his
wages were being garnished at 24% if his pay since March 2018 to recover a $20,000
deficiency balance on a  car loan  that he  thought  insurance had covered.  He  indicated
that  he  was  unaware  of  any  other delinquent  accounts,  and  when  confronted  with  the
adverse credit information on his credit report, he was unable to provide any details. He
expressed  an  intention  to  pay  off  his  legitimate  debts.  He  had  not  had  any  financial
counseling, but stated that he intended to get some help to address his debts. (GE 2.)
Applicant asserts that when  he  found  out  about  the  adverse credit  information  on
his credit record,  he  “tried  to  get one  of those  credit  consolidators and  figure it out  that
way, and  then  it  kind  of fell  off. [He] got  promoted  at work and  it wasn’t important to  [him],
so   [he]  neglected   it.”  (Tr.  55.)  In   his  January   2021   response   to   DOHA   interrogatories,
Applicant stated,  “1/2  of  all  debts  paid  and  working  with  lawyer for rest.” (GE  2.)  He  now
admits   that  it  was  not   until  he   received   the   SOR  that  he   realized   he   could  not  put   off
11
dealing with the debts any longer. (Tr. 55.) He maintains that he paid off some $30,000
in debt balances, including the car-loan debt in SOR ¶ 5.a, which was resolved through
garnishment. (Tr. 56.) He provided no documentation proving that any of the SOR debts
have been paid.
As of May 2022, Applicant was $387 past due on a $16,012 vehicle loan obtained
in August 2017. His account first became past due 30 days in December 2017. It was 90
days  past  due  in  January  2019,  December  2020,  and  January  2021.  The  loan  had  a
balance  of  $8,364  as  of  late  May  2022.  (AE  A.)  He  testified  about  the  May  2022
delinquency that his car payment was not debited properly from his bank account so the
bank rejected his payment. He paid $400 on July 4, 2022, to catch up. (Tr. 76.)
A credit-card account opened with a retailer in May 2021  was reported as being
120 days past due in February 2022, although it was current as of June 2022 with a $253
balance. A $22,122 vehicle loan cosigned by Applicant for his girlfriend in August 2017
had never been late. She made the $421 monthly payments on time and had reduced the
balance  to $6,303 as of  May 2022.  (AE A; Tr. 30.) As of  July 2022, a $148 debt from
February 2020 for his interlock device was in collection.  (AE A.) He maintains that the
debt has been paid. (Tr. 77.) As of July 2022, his credit rating was poor. (AE A.)
Applicant received a substantial increase in his salary from $68,000 to $104,000
annually on his promotion effective May 2, 2022, to a supervisory role at work. (Tr. 29,
67-68.)  As  of  his  July  2022  security  clearance  hearing,  he  was  researching  credit
specialists to resolve some of his past-due debts. (Tr. 29.) He receives a monthly disability
payment from the VA of $1,987. (Tr. 68.)
Applicant’s  cohabitant   girlfriend   is  a   paraprofessional  in  special  education   for  a
school district  during the academic school year. (Tr. 29.)  She did not finish out the  2021-
2022  school year because  of complications from  COVID she  suffered  in early  2022. (Tr.

"Applicant is 50  years old, has never married,  and has no children. He cohabitated
with  a  woman  (the  Cohabitant) from  2004  until September 2020. He  currently  lives with  a
new  girlfriend.  He has a  high  school diploma  and  has taken  college  courses over  several
years, but has not yet earned a  degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1994 and served
until 2002  when  he  was honorably  discharged. He then  entered  the  Navy  Reserve  for two
years. He was honorably  discharged  from  the  Reserve  in 2004. When  he  served  in the
Navy  he  held  a  Top  Secret  security  clearance  for a  period  and  then  a  Secret  clearance.
He  has   also   held  a   Secret   clearance   while   working   as  a   defense   contractor.   He  has
worked  as an  analyst  for his current employer since  2007.  He seeks to  retain national
security  eligibility  and  a  security  clearance  in connection  with  his employment.  (Tr. at 20-
28; GE 1 at 7-12, 18-19, 29-31.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he is financially overextended and  has failed to pay his Federal taxes  and to
timely file his Federal and state income tax returns. The Government alleged that these
facts render Applicant potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage
in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR lists five allegedly past-due consumer debts
that have been referred to collection or charged off. The total amount of these debts is
$32,755. The SOR also alleged three years of delinquent Federal tax debts in the total
amount  of  about  $5,500  for  tax  years  (TYs)  2018,  2019,  and  2020.  Lastly,  the  SOR
alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2019
and  2020.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  under  this  guideline
except one (SOR 1.e), which is a debt he asserted he had paid. He also wrote that he
paid SOR debt 1.d and his delinquent Federal taxes and that he has filed his Federal and
state tax returns for TYs 2019 and 2020. (Answer at 1-2.)
The current status of the matters alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR is as follows:
1.a.  Credit  union   credit-card  account   charged   off   in  the   amount  of   $15,244.
Applicant defaulted  on  paying  the  monthly  payments in 2018  during  a  period  of financial
distress. He  has made  calls to the credit union about this debt and the debts  owed to the
same  credit union  listed  in  subparagraphs 1.b  and  1.c,  but  he  has  not  taken  any  significant
steps to  repay  this debt.  He intends to  do  what is necessary  to  take  care of  these  three
debts. The  debt alleged  in subparagraph  1.a  is not  resolved. (Tr. at 28-31, 68; GE  2  at 4;
GE  3 at 2; GE  4 at 5.)
1.b.  Credit  union   credit-card  account  charged   off   in  the   approximate   amount  of
$9,356. Applicant defaulted on paying the monthly payments in 2018 during a period of
financial distress. He has not taken any significant steps to repay this debt. This debt is
not resolved. (Tr. at 28-31; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5.)
1.c.  Credit  union  debt-consolidation  loan  account  charged  off  in the  approximate
amount   of  $7,961.
Applicant   defaulted   on   paying   the   monthly   loan   payments   in   2019
during  a  period  of financial distress.  He has not taken  any  significant steps to  repay  this
debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 28-33; GE 2  at 2; GE 3  at 2; GE 4  at 5.)
1.d. Medical collection  account in  the  approximate  amount of  $150.  Applicant paid
this debt over the  phone  in May  2022. This debt has  been  resolved. (Tr.  at  34-35; GE  3

amount   of   $44.
Applicant paid  this  debt in  January  2021.  This  debt  has  been  resolved. (Tr. at  35-36;  GE
3 at 3.)
1.f.  Delinquent  Federal  tax  debt  for TY  2018  in  the  approximate  amount of $2,475.
This tax  debt and  the  debts alleged  in SOR 1.g  and  1.h  were the  result of  Applicant under-
withholding  taxes on  his income  and  changes in the  tax  law. Applicant resolved  this tax
debt with  a  credit from  a  prior tax  year  and  a  payment in March 2022  of  $572. This debt
has been resolved. (Tr. at  37-44; AE G at 1-2.)
1.g. Delinquent Federal tax  debt  for  TY  2019  in  the  approximate  amount  of $2,313.
Applicant resolved  this  tax  debt  with  payments in April and  September 2022.  This debt
has been resolved. (Tr. at 37-44; AE B; AE  H at 1-2.)
1.h. Delinquent  Federal tax  debt for TY  2020  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $728.
Applicant resolved  this  tax  debt  with  payments in March  and  September  2022.  This  debt
has been resolved. (Tr. at 37-44; AE  B; AE F at 1-2.)
1.i  Failure  to   timely   file   Federal  and   state   tax   returns  in  TYs  2019   and   2020.
Applicant  blamed   his  failure   to   file   his  tax   returns  on   time   for  these   two   years  on   his
financial problems at that time. The Cohabitant  was not able to contribute any significant
funds   to   the   couple’s  expenses   and   those   expenses   fell   mostly   on   Applicant.   He   was
overwhelmed.   He   filed   his  TY   2019   returns   on   September  12,  2022   and   his  TY   2020
returns  on August 29, 2022. (Tr. at 46-48; AE F; AE  H.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  experienced  financial  problems  due  to  poor  money
management and to the financial demands made by the Cohabitant. He bought a house
and was having difficulties paying his bills because he was living beyond his means. The
Cohabitant lost her job and had to take a lower paying job. She was also on disability for
one  year  after  being  diagnosed  as  bipolar.  He  had  tax  problems  due  to  an  early
withdrawal  from  his  retirement  account  in  2017.  In  2020  he  borrowed  money  from  his
401k  to  pay  his  2017  tax  debt  that  resulted  from  the  early  withdrawal  from  his  401k
account. The  IRS was  threatening to  impose a  lien on his house  at  that  time. Later in
2020 he sold the house and received about $100,000 of net proceeds from the sale. He
gave the Cohabitant $40,000, even though the house was in his name. He was unable to
provide an explanation as to why he did not resolve  his other debts with the remaining
sales  proceeds.  He  said  that  with  the  sale  of  the  house  in  which  he  lived  with  the
Cohabitant and the end of that relationship, he just “took a break.” He is trying to get his
life back together following the end of that long-term relationship in 2019 and 2020. His
life has improved since he separated from the Cohabitant. (Tr. at 21-30, 33, 36-41.)
Applicant filed  his TY  2021  tax  returns about a  week before the  hearing. He did not
file  for extensions   so   the   returns  were  untimely.  That fact  was  not   alleged   in  the   SOR
because  the  delinquencies  post-date  the  SOR. He owed  the  Federal Government  about
$4,500  for TY  2021.  He  recently  mailed  a  check to  the  IRS  to  pay  that tax  debt.  (Tr. at  45-
48.)
Applicant presently has about $22,000 in savings. His monthly take home pay is
about $4,000. He recently moved in with a new girlfriend, who has a significant salary. He
contributes $700 to their living expenses and she pays the rest. He owns his car. He has
about  $3,000 of  net  disposable  income after expenses.  He  can afford  a payment  plan
with the credit union if it was willing to accept one. He has not explored that possibility
yet. He recognizes that he has to change his tax withholding to make sure he covers his
yearly  tax  obligations.  He  has  not  done  so  or  taken  other  necessary  actions  on  his
finances because he “hit a  wall” in the 2017-2019 period and is just starting to recover
with the help and support of his new girlfriend. He said, “I just had some really bad years.”
He claims that he used to be financially responsible. At one point since 2018, he sought
the help of a debt relief company to assist him to pay and resolve his debts, but he rejected
their proposal. He has not received any financial counseling. (Tr. at 51-53, 69.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The  details  regarding the  single  SOR  allegation  set forth  in paragraph  2  are  as
follows:
2.a  September 2020  arrest and  charge  of  Driving  Under the  Influence  of  alcohol
(DUI). Applicant had  a  minor accident when  he  failed  to  navigate  a  turn properly  near his
home  after staying  up  all  night. Earlier in  the  evening, he  had  been  drinking  alcohol. When
he   was  driving   home,  he   felt  that  he   was  more  tired   than   intoxicated.   The   sheriff   was
called. Applicant registered  a  0.10% blood  alcohol content even  though  he  had  not had  a
drink in several hours. He was arrested  and  charged  with  DUI.  He was convicted  of  the
offense  of Wet and  Reckless. The  court sentenced  Applicant  to  one  year of  probation.  He
successfully  completed  all  of  the  terms of  his probation, and  it expired  in May  2022. He
also  completed   all   of  the   state   DMV   requirements  to   maintain  his  driver’s  license.
Applicant is  very  aware  that  the  consequences of a  second  similar offense  in  his  state  will
be  much  more severe. This was his first DUI arrest,  and  he  has not had  any  similar arrests
since  September 2020.  At this point he  rarely  drinks to  excess. He  has  a  couple of  glasses
of   wine   two   nights   a   week  with   his  new   girlfriend.  He   does  not   drink  and   drive.  He
describes  his  2020  accident  and  arrest  as  “isolated.”  He  has  never been  diagnosed  with
alcohol use  disorder. (Tr. at 54-61; GE  5.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
The  Government  cross  alleged  its  Guideline  J  allegation  in  a  single  allegation
under  the  guideline  regarding  Alcohol  Consumption.  See  the  discussion  under  that
guideline, above.
",True
"Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  with  detailed  explanations.  The
admissions  are adopted  as findings  of  fact. After a thorough  and careful review of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old. He has worked for his current government contractor-
employer  since  April  2018  as  an  aircraft  mechanic.  He  is  seeking  his  first  security
clearance. He holds a bachelor’s  degree. He is engaged and has four children. (Tr. 6,
20, 27-28; GE 1; AE B)
The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  J,  Applicant’s  12  different  arrests  starting  in
2000  and  ending  in  2017  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.l).  Three  of  these  arrests  occurred  when
Applicant was a juvenile. The most serious arrests include: in June 2012, an arrest and
charge for distribution and possession of a controlled substance; in May 2013, an arrest
and  charge  for  an  assault  causing  bodily  injury;  in  September  2013,  an  arrest  and
charge  for  failure  to  obey  a  police  officer  and  resisting  arrest;  and  in  April  2017,  an
arrest and charge for impeding the breathing of a house member (SOR  ¶¶ 1.h, 1.j-1.l).
All these allegations were also cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR ¶ 2.a).
As stated above, Applicant admitted all the allegations and during his testimony
accepted responsibility for his actions. He committed to being a changed man since he
engaged in this criminal conduct as a teenager and into his 20s. By way of explanation,
he  described  his  difficult  upbringing.  He  and  his  siblings  were  raised  by  his
grandparents because his parents were not in the picture. They lived in a rough intercity
neighborhood.  His  grandmother  passed  away  when  he  was  17,  so  his  grandfather
became  his  primary  care  giver  through  high  school.  He  served  as  Applicant’s  role
model.  His  grandfather  passed  away  in  2010  when  Applicant  was  still  in  college  and
that started some difficult times and bad decisions by him. (Tr. 19-22)
Applicant is the first of his family to graduate from college. He bought a home a
year ago where he lives with his fiancé and his kids. While he does not associate with
anyone in his old neighborhood where he grew up, he does mentor high-risk kids from
that neighborhood to provide them guidance so that they can avoid trouble-filled paths.
He also participates in fundraising events that help fund scholarship programs for these
kids. (Tr. 19-20, 23-24)
A summary of the offenses admitted by Applicant include:
 a  burglary  charge  in 2000,  another burglary  charge  in February  2003, and
a possession of  a controlled substance charge in May 2003. All three were
treated as juvenile offenses;  (GE 3; Answer to SOR)
 a June 2005 driving  without a license charge  was dismissed;  (GE 3)
 an   October  2005   possession   of  marijuana   charge   and   a   March   2006
driving   on   a   suspended   license   charge.  He   was  found   guilty   of   both
charges;  (GE 3)

a   May   2012   criminal  mischief  charge   was  dismissed;   (GE   3;  Answer  to
SOR)
 a  June  2012  manufacturing  of  a  controlled  substance  charge  resulted  in  a
deferred   adjudication   after  he   successfully   completed   two   years  of
supervised probation;  (Tr. 50-52; GE  3; Answer to SOR)
 a  May  2013  charge  of  assault by  causing  bodily  harm  was dismissed  and
a  September 2013  resisting  arrest charge  was also dismissed; (Tr. 38, 41,
43, 44, 46-49; GE 3; Answer to SOR)
 a  April 2017  charge  of assaulting  a  house  member was reduced  to assault
by   contact  to   which  he   pleaded   “no   contest.” (Tr.33-35;  GE   3; Answer to
SOR)
 Applicant has not been arrested or charged with any other criminal  offense
since April 2017. (Tr. 53)
In addition to  Applicant’s  job  with  a  government  contractor,  he  started  a  vehicle
transport limited liability company (LLC) in 2020. He has one employee who transports
vehicles to various parts of the country. The business has been very successful to date,
earning him between $70,000 and $90,000 per year in extra income. He is also in the
process  of  selling  an  investment  property  that  he  “flipped”  and  that  will  also  generate
additional income. (Tr. 55-58; AE C)
Applicant  is  well  thought  of  by  his  employer  as  evidenced  by  three  letters  of
recommendation he submitted from a supervisor and two coworkers. Applicant’s current
supervisor  described  him  as  having  “the  highest  moral  character.”  He  also  stated  that
Applicant  is  well  respected  by  his  coworkers  and  is  a  leader  for  his  work  group.  The
supervisor has held a security clearance for 30 years and recommended that Applicant
also  receive  a  clearance.  Applicant’s  two  coworkers  describe  him  in  similar  ways  and
also support his effort to receive a clearance. (AE A)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.b, but denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.e, 2.a-2.e, 3.a, and 3.b. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is a  46-year-old  electrical engineer employed  by a defense  contractor
since  October 2018.  He  served  on  active  duty in  the  U.S.  Navy from  October 1997 to
October  2001  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  has  worked  for  defense
contractors since August 2003, with short periods of unemployment when he was laid off
in 2016 and 2017. He held a security clearance in the Navy, which was renewed in 2008.
He earned an associate’s degree in 2015 and has been enrolled in online college courses
since 2015.
Applicant married in January 2001 and has four children, ages 29, 23, 19, and 17.
During the PSI, the investigator asked him if he had any additional family members that
he had not listed in his SCA. He volunteered that he did not list a twin brother, who is a
transient moving around  in  the  west  coast of  the  United  States,  with  whom  he  has no
contact. He gave the investigator no specific explanation for not listing his twin brother.
(FORM Item 12 at 5.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges five delinquent debts. Applicant admitted the
debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  (a  debt  charged  off  for  $20,594)  and  SOR  ¶  1.b  (a  debt
charged off for $10,127). He claimed that he had a payment plan for the debt alleged in
SOR  ¶  1.a  and  that  he  was  making  payments  on  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He
provided no documentation of a payment plan for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, and the
documentation  he  submitted  for  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  reflects  payments  to  a
different account that was not alleged in the SOR.
In the PSI, Applicant was confronted with credit reports for six persons with names
similar to  his.  He  told the  investigator that  he  had  never used those  names and  could
provide no information explaining why those names were associated with him. (FORM
Item 12 at 1.)
Applicant answered “no” to all the financial questions in Section 26 of his SCA. In
his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  denied  the  two  delinquent  telecommunications  accounts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d and the insurance company debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e,
and he claimed that he had communicated his dispute to the alleged creditors.
During the PSI, Applicant was confronted with numerous debts. He admitted the
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and told the investigator that he did not think he was required
to list it in his SCA because he had contacted the creditor and discussed a payment plan.
He told the investigator that he did not disclose the credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b
because it was the result of fraud. According to Applicant, he had obtained this credit card
for his spouse to use when he was deployed outside the United States. After an overseas
deployment, he noticed numerous charges that he believed were fraudulent. He told the
investigator that he  disputed  those charges  and they were  removed from  the  account.
According to Applicant, the card issuer issued a new card and transferred about $6,000
in undisputed charges to the new card, which was issued in his spouse’s name only and
was paid in full. (FORM Item 12 at 7.)
The allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b was based on a credit report from December 2020
reflecting that the debt was opened in January 2015 and charged off in December 2020.
(FORM Item 4 at 1.) In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he responded to this allegation by
submitting  a  document  reflecting  a  payment  on  an  account  in  his  name  only,  with  a
different account number than the account listed in the December 2020 credit report, on
which SOR ¶ 1.a was based. The documentation does not support Applicant’s claims in
the PSI that the fraudulent account was closed, that a new account was opened in his
spouse’s name only, and that it was paid in full.
In Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR,  he  denied  having  accounts with  the  creditors
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, and he stated that he had contacted the creditors
and disputed the validity of the debts. In the PSI, he claimed that he had no knowledge
of  these  debts.  (FORM  Item  12  at  6.)  The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  are
reflected  in  the  July  2019  credit  report  (which  is  annotated  with  a  fraud  alert),  but  the
insurance debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e is not reflected. (FORM Item 5.) The debts alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e are not reflected in the January 2021 credit report. (FORM
Item 4.) They are too recent to have aged off the credit reports in accordance with the
Fair Credit Report Act, indicating that Applicant’s dispute may have been resolved in his
favor, especially in light of the identity fraud investigation discussed below.
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleges the following:
SOR  ¶   2a:   That   in   July   2020,   Applicant  was  charged   with   possession   of
controlled drugs and pleaded guilty to a lesser offense;
SOR ¶  2.b:  That  on  four occasions  between  August 2020  and  June  2021,
he was charged with possession of  a controlled drug;
SOR ¶  2.c:  That on  eight occasions between  May  2020  and  May  2021, he
was charged with trespass not amounting to burglary;
SOR ¶  2.d:  That on  five  occasions between  January  2019  and  August  2021,
he   was  charged   with   entering   a   state   in   western   United   States  without
registering  with local law enforcement authorities; and
SOR ¶  2.e:  That he  had  engaged  in banking  transactions consistent  with
money laundering.
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he denied all these allegations.  In February
2002,  he  filed  an  identity-theft  complaint  after  receiving  correspondence  from  the  IRS
about  his  income.  His  complaint  was  that  someone  was  using  his identify  to  apply for
jobs. He filed another complaint in February 2008 after being notified by the IRS that his
income  was  $23,000  more  than  he  had  reported.  In  August  2009,  he  filed  another
complaint that his estranged twin brother was using his identify to obtain loans and other
financial gains. In October 2011, he filed another complaint after his driver’s license was
“on  hold”  because  another  person  had  obtained  a  driver’s  license  in  his  name  in  an
adjoining  state.  The  adjoining  state  determined  that  Applicant  was  a  victim  of  identity
fraud.
In August 2015, Applicant’s employer obtained an investigation of his backgound
from  a  civilian  agency.  The  results  of  that  investigation  were  attached  to  Applicant’s
answer to the SOR. The investigation showed that a person using Applicant’s name had
a  long  arrest  and  conviction  record  in  two  adjoining  states  in  western  United  States.
Applicant’s estranged twin brother lives in one of those states. Applicant lives and works
in southeast United States. In April 2019, Applicant supplied fingerprints to the FBI and
asked for a criminal record check. The FBI found that he has no arrest data at the FBI.

"Applicant is 58 years old, married for the second time, and has two children. He
received  a  bachelor’s  degree.  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  December  2019  and  seeks  to  obtain  national  security  eligibility  and  a  security
clearance in connection with his employment. He worked as a Federal employee for one
of the military services as a manager from 1997 until he retired in October 2019. (Item 2
at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about  a  person’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this
paragraph.  All  the  statements  of  fact  regarding  the  allegations  are  from  a  Report  of
Investigation  (ROI)  prepared  by  an  authorized  investigator  of  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management  after  an  interview  with  Applicant  taken  under  oath,  except  as  otherwise
stated.  Applicant  agreed  to  the  accuracy  and  truthfulness  of  the  ROI  in  DOHA
interrogatories signed by him on August 3, 2021. (Item 4,)
1.a.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  July  2011  and  charged  with  Driving  Under  the
Influence (DUI). He stated that the court sentenced him to a pre-trial diversion program
and  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended.  He  also  had  to  perform  community  service,
attend  Mothers  Against  Drunk  Drivers  presentations,  and  take  a  drivers’  education
course. He stated that after completing the diversion program the charges were dismissed
and expunged. When questioned as to why this arrest  was not set forth in his 2020 e-
QIP, discussed below, he stated that he had self-reported it at the time, and he believed
the Government should know about it. (Item 4 at 12-13.)
1.b.  Applicant  admitted   that  he   was  arrested   in  April  2017   and   charged   with
Disorderly  Conduct. He  stated  this incident  was the  result of  an  argument between  his
wife  and  a  restaurant owner, eventually  both  he  and  his wife  were arrested.  He further
stated   that  the   court   dismissed   the   charges  after  one   year  of  no   interaction   with   the
restaurant.  Applicant stated  he  could not  remember  whether he  self-reported  this incident.
He further stated  that he  did not report this incident on  his security  questionnaire  because
he did not think it was required. (Item  4 at 11-12.)
1.c.   Applicant  admitted   that  he   was  charged   in  July   2019   with   a   Warrant,
Communicating  a  Threat.  During  a  verbal argument with  his wife  he  stated  that he  would
kill her after she  communicated  a  threat to  cut off  his penis while  he  slept.  The  police  were
called and  Applicant was arrested.  He  stated that  the  court initia
lly  found  him  guilty. Two
weeks later, on  a  petition  from  his wife, the  charges were dismissed. He stated  that he
did not  report this incident  on  his  security  questionnaire  because  the  case  was dismissed.
(Item  4 at 10-11.)
1.d. Applicant admitted that he was arrested in August 2019 and charged with DUI.
He  was  arrested  after  attending  his  own  retirement  party.  In  February  2020  he  was
convicted. He spent two days in jail, paid a fine, his driver’s license was suspended for
90 days, and he was placed on one year’s unsupervised probation. Applicant stated that
he did report this arrest to his Federal civilian employer as required. He did not report it
on his security questionnaire since he did self-report it, and he believed the Government
should know about it. (Item 4 at 9-10.)
1.e.  Applicant  admitted   that  he   was  arrested   in  July   2020   for  Harassment  and
Simple  Assault. The  charges were in regard to  two  fights between  Applicant and  his wife.
According   to   Applicant   all   the   charges  were  eventually   dismissed   by   the   court   with   no
findings. (Item  4 at 8-9.)
1.f.  Applicant  admitted   that   he   was  arrested   in  August  2020   and   charged   with
Public Intoxication. He  was issued  a  citation, and  immediately  paid the  $300  fine. (Item  4
at 7-8.)
1.g. Applicant  admitted  that  he  was arrested  in April 2021  and  charged  with  DUI.
He  was  found   guilty   and   ordered   to   perform   community   service  and   attend   alcohol
treatment.  Attached  to  his Answer is documentation  from  the  treatment center showing
that he  had  successfully  completed  a  30-hour outpatient  program  on  August 17, 2021.
(Item  1 at 7-9; Item  4 at 17-18.)
There is no  documentation  from  any  court or law  enforcement agency  in the  record
to support Applicant’s statements regarding the disposition of  any of these offenses.
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  G, Alcohol Consumption)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he consumes intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted this allegation.
Applicant had previously admitted to the facts of the  four alcohol-related arrests
described  under  subparagraphs  1.a,  1.d,  1.f,  and  1.g.  He  stated  in  his  responses  to
Interrogatories that he stopped drinking in April 2021 after his last DUI arrest.  As noted
above,  he  has  successfully  completed  a  drug  and  alcohol  education  and  treatment
program. (Item 1 at 7-9; Item 4 at 17-18.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. Applicant
admitted both allegations under this paragraph with explanations.
Applicant  submitted   an   e-QIP   on   May   29,  2020.  (Item   3.)  Section   22   of  that
questionnaire  concerns Applicant’s Police  Record. As  a preliminary  matter it states, “For
this section  report information  regardless of  whether the  record  in your case  has been
sealed,  expunged,   or   otherwise  stricken   from   the   court  record,   or  the   charge   was
dismissed.”
3.a. One subpart of that section asked Applicant to set forth criminal conduct within
seven years of the date of the questionnaire. The question asked specifically whether he
had received a summons, citation, or ticket. It also asked whether he had been charged,
convicted, or sentenced of a crime. Applicant answered, “No.” This was a false answer to
relevant questions about Applicant’s criminal history. Applicant stated  in  his Answer, “I
admit, but thought question was asking for unreported arrests.” (Item 1 at 5.)
3.b.   A   second   subpart  of  Section   22   asked   Applicant,  in   part,   “Have   you   EVER
been convicted  of an offense involving domestic violence or a crime  of violence (such  as
battery  or assault) against  your  . .  .  cohabitant,  spouse  or legally  recognized  civil union
domestic partner”  and,  “Have  you  EVER  been  charged  with  any  offense  involving  alcohol
or  drugs?”  (All   emphasis  in  original.)  Applicant  answered,   “No.”  This  was  also  a   false
answer to  relevant questions concerning  Applicant’s criminal history. Applicant stated  in
his  Answer,  “I  admit,  but  thought  this  was  asking   for  any   unreported.  Everything   was
reported to my supervisor at time  of  arrest.” (Item 1 at 5.)

"Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  December  2017.  He  was  out  of  work  from  about  June  2016  until
September 2016 and from May 2017 until December 2017. Between January 2018 and
July  2018  he  attended  online  college  classes,  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  is  twice
divorced,  and  he remarried  in  February 2017.  His  previous  marriages  were  from 2000
until 2010, and from 2010 until 2014. He has two stepchildren, ages 17 and 8. He also
has  three  children,  ages  11,  10,  and  2.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1997  until
2014, when he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 24, 49; GE 1)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  three  delinquent
consumer debts totaling about $42,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c). In his SOR Answer,
he denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b  with additional comments. He did not
respond  to  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c,  so  I  have  treated  his  lack  of  response  as  a
denial.  These  allegations  are  established  by  the  Government’s  evidence,  including
credit reports. (Tr. 25-47; Answer; GE 2-7)
Under  Guideline  J,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  June  2022  arrest  and
charge of false report to a police officer (SOR ¶ 2.a). The Government cross alleged this
allegation under Guideline E (SOR ¶ 3.a). He did not respond to the allegations in SOR
¶¶ 2.a and 3.a, so I have treated his lack of response as denials. (Tr. 47-66, 69-80; GE
7-10)
The delinquent auto loan in the amount of $19,923 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a has not
been resolved. In his Answer, Applicant claimed this debt is fraudulent and has fallen off
his credit report because of his claims about its validity. Applicant opened this account
to  purchase a  vehicle in  2013.  In  2015, he  voluntarily surrendered the  vehicle  back  to
the  dealership  as  he  claimed  he  was  having  electrical  problems  with  it.  In  2015,  he
attempted  to  make  payment  arrangements  with  the  creditor,  but  was  unable  to  do  so.
He included this debt in a 2015 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that was dismissed that
same year, so the debt was not discharged. This debt is listed in the 2018 credit report
but not in any subsequent credit reports. (Tr. 25-35, Answer, GE 4, 5)
The delinquent personal loan in the amount of $15,320 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b has
not  been  resolved.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  claimed  this  debt  is  fraudulent  and  has
been  disputed  because  of  its  “consistency  and  validity.”  He  claimed  that  this  creditor
was  known  to  unfairly  target  young  service  members,  engaged  in  predatory  lending
practices,  and  is  no  longer  in  business.  Applicant  opened  this  account  in  2013,  and
used it for every day purchases. He claims that he paid the balance on this account in
full  prior  to  his  2015  bankruptcy  petition.  However,  he  provided  no  documentary
evidence regarding his payments or to substantiate the basis for his dispute. This debt
is  listed  in  the  2018  credit  report  but  not  in  any  subsequent  credit  reports.  (Tr.  35-41;
Answer, GE 4)
The delinquent auto refinance loan in the amount of $7,271 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c
has not been resolved. Applicant opened this account in July 2019 for a “refi cash out”
on a vehicle he owned. Applicant’s first missed payment on this account was in August
2020 and the loan was charged off in September 2021. Applicant claimed that he was in
contact  with  the  creditor  in  July  2020.  He  claimed  he  was  able  to  make  payments  on
this  account,  but  he  no  longer  needed  or  wanted  the  vehicle,  because  he  had
purchased another vehicle. He wanted to return the vehicle in order to cancel the loan,
but  the  creditor  was  not  willing  to  accept  his  offer.  In  July  2020,  he  voluntarily
surrendered  the  vehicle  and  tried  to  make  payment  arrangements  on  the  account
balance  but  was  unable  to  come  to  an  agreement  with  the  creditor.  He  claimed  that
after the  account  was  charged  off,  the  account  was  moved  to another creditor and he
has been unable to locate that creditor in order to try to make payment arrangements.
He  claimed  that  he  has  been  trying  to  contact  them  for  the  last  month.  This  debt
appears on the 2021 and 2022 credit reports. (Tr. 27, 41-47; GE 2, 6)
Applicant purchased a home in 2017. He earns $62,000 annually. His take home
pay  is  about  $2,250  every  two  weeks.  He  has  a  100  percent  disability  rating  with  the
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  and  receives  $5,500  in  monthly  benefits.  He
suffers from a brain injury that is combat related. His wife is a full-time student. He has
two  checking  accounts  with  balances  of  $10,000  and  $2,500.  He  claims  that  he  has
about $4,500 left over at the end of the month after paying all his expenses. (Tr. 26, 41,
66-68)
In  December  2021,  Applicant’s  spouse  was  involved  in  a  traffic  accident  with
another vehicle driven by an off-duty police officer. His spouse and three of his children
were in the car and suffered minor injuries. His spouse called him immediately after the
accident  and he drove  to the accident scene. When  he arrived,  he noticed  that two  of
his  children  were  bleeding  and  another  was  crying.  Applicant  was  understandably
upset. The driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident was taking pictures of the
damage  to  both  vehicles.  In  Applicant’s  opinion,  the  other  driver  was  too  close  to  his
vehicle  and  was  unconcerned  with  the  health  of  Applicant’s  spouse  and  children.
Applicant  told the  other driver to  back away  from  Applicant’s  vehicle  and  an  argument
ensued. At some point during this argument, the other driver told Applicant that he was
an off-duty police officer and showed Applicant his badge. During the argument, the off-
duty  police  officer  put  his  hands  on  Applicant’s  chest  and  his  face,  and  knocked
Applicant’s  hat  off  his  head.  Applicant  responded  by  knocking  the  off-duty  police
officer’s  hat  off  his  head.  He  and  the  off-duty  police  officer  were  then  separated  by
bystanders. (Tr. 25-26, 46-56, 69-72; GE 7-10)
When  on-duty  police  officers  arrived  at  the  scene  of  the  accident,  Applicant
informed  them  that  he  wished  to  file  a  complaint  against  the  off-duty  police  officer
involved in the accident. The on-duty police officers directed Applicant to internal affairs
(IA)  and  another  unnamed  police  entity  with  oversight  duties.  He  subsequently  filed  a
complaint against the off-duty police officer with IA and the other unnamed police entity.
In   January   2022,  he   met  in-person   with   IA   and   provided   information   regarding   his
complaint  against  the  off-duty  police  officer. At the  beginning  of  the  interview  with  IA, he
let  them  know  that  he  suffers from  a  brain  injury  and  may  not remember some  details  of
the  altercation.  In  March  2022, he  met  with  IA  again.  At  this  meeting, the  officers  with  IA
told Applicant  they  were not able to  substantiate  the  information  he  provided  them   and
the  other unnamed  entity.  IA  also  told  him  that the  information  he  provided  to  IA  and  the
unnamed   entity   was  inconsistent.   Applicant   claimed   IA   did  not   tell   him   what  these
inconsistencies  were. During  this meeting  with  IA, he  informed IA  that he  wished  to  drop
his  complaint   against   the   off-duty   police   officer.  He  did   not  want  to   ruin   the   off-duty
police   officer’s  career,  but  simply   wanted   him   reprimanded   for  his  inappropriate
behavior.  (Tr. 56-66, 72-80; GE 7-10)
In  June  2022,  Applicant  learned  that  he  had  a  warrant  out  for  his  arrest  for
making a false report to a police officer. The warrant was filed in March 2022, but he did
not know about it until a police officer with IA called him to tell him about it in June 2022.
He  drove  to  the  police  station  and  turned  himself  in.  At  the  police  station,  he  was
arrested and charged with making a false report to a police officer. He was released on
bond.  As  of  the  date of  the  hearing  in  this matter, these  charges  are  still  pending.  He
claimed  that  he  does  not  know  what  information  that  he  provided  to  either  IA  or  the
other unnamed police entity is considered false or untrue. He claimed that he provided
IA  and the  other unnamed entity truthful information  and denied filing a false  report or
engaging in any criminal activity or behavior. (Tr. 56-66, 72-80; GE 7-10)

"Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for

In about August 2006, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol  (DUI)  in  State  A.  He  had  been  drinking  mixed  drinks  at  a  party  and  was
impaired.  He  claimed that  he  gave  his keys  to  another individual  in  order  to  drive  him
home,  but  that  person  was  also  impaired.  Whoever  was  driving  Applicant’s  car  hit  a
telephone  pole  and  police  arrived  on  the  scene.  Applicant  claimed  that  the  driver  fled
the scene and he was in the passenger seat. He told police he had not been driving. He
claimed that, despite the fact that he had not been driving, police arrested him for DUI
because his car had been involved in the accident and he had a blood alcohol content
(BAC) over the legal limit. He was convicted of DUI. Based upon the self-serving nature
of his story and his arrest and conviction, I find Applicant’s claim that he was not driving
his  car  strains  credulity.  He  was  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  during  this
incident.  His  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  nine  months  and  he  was  placed  on
probation. He was also required to attend court-ordered alcohol-related classes and he
had to pay $1,600 in fines. He claimed that he has satisfied all the requirements of this
DUI conviction. He went to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings for about a year after
this  arrest.  However,  he  drank  alcohol  during  the  time  period  he  was  attending  these
meetings. (Tr. 18, 23, 25, 33, 37-38, 52; Answer; GE 1-3)
In  about  July  2010,  Applicant  was  charged  with  DUI  in  State  A.  He  was  pulled
over  after  driving  home  from  a  concert  where  he  had  been  drinking  beer.  He  claimed
that  he  had  only had  four  beers  over  a  five-hour  period.  He  was  given  a  breathalyzer
test,  resulting  in  a  .08  BAC.  He  was  arrested  and  spent  the  night  in  jail.  He  pleaded
guilty and was convicted of DUI. As a result of his conviction, he was fined and ordered
to take 18 months of weekly DUI instructional classes. He attended these classes until
about  2011,  but  transportation  issues  and  scheduling conflicts  resulted  in  his failing to
complete the courses. He was also ordered to install an ignition interlock device on his
vehicle, which he failed to do. Applicant lost his job as a driver as a result of this DUI. As
of the date of the hearing, he still had not complied with the terms of his sentence as he
has yet to complete the DUI instructional courses or install an ignition interlock system
on  his  car.  He  claimed  that  he  has  not  completed  these  requirements  because  of  the
time  and  money  it  would  cost  him.  He  also  acknowledged  missing  these  classes
because he was being foolish. (Tr. 19, 23, 26-27, 33-34, 37-43, 46-49, 56; Answer; GE

Applicant was arrested in about April 2011 for failure to appear and for failing to
complete  the  requirements  of  his  2010  DUI  conviction.  As  a  result  of  his  failure  to
complete the terms of his 2010 DUI conviction, his driver’s license was suspended. He
was  arrested  again  in  December  2012  on  the  same  charges  as  the  April  2011  arrest.
(Tr. 34-42; Answer; GE 1-3)
Despite  knowing  that he  was not permitted  to  drive  because  his driver’s license
was  suspended,  Applicant  drove  his  vehicle  to  and  from  work  nearly  every  day  from
2011  until  2018.  In  about  December  2018,  while  driving  to  attend  a  job  interview,  he
was pulled over by a  police officer in State B for following another vehicle too closely.
When the police officer determined the suspended status of Applicant’s driver’s license,
he  was  arrested and charged  with  driving  on  a  suspended  license  and  driving  without
an ignition interlock device. He was convicted of both of these charges. Applicant knew
that  he  was  not  supposed  to  be  driving,  but  he  did  so,  regardless.  His  vehicle  was
impounded  and  he  was  fined.  He  paid  the  fines  through  a  payment  arrangement  in
about 2020. (Tr. 29-31, 42-45, 51; Answer; GE 1-3; AE B)
In  about  2019,  Applicant  moved  to  State  C  for  a  new  job.  He  obtained  a  valid
driver’s license in State C through their application process that involved a “Termination
Action” of his State A driver’s license suspension. Despite arguably not being eligible for
the Termination Action in State A pursuant to the language in its own forms (ineligible if
individual  has  not  complied  with  an  ignition  interlock  requirement),  Applicant  was
granted his request for a Termination Action in State A and obtained a driver’s license in
State  C.  He  is  not  permitted  to  drive  in  State  A  because he  has  not  complied  with  (at
least) the ignition  interlock  portion of  his 2010  DUI  conviction.  He claimed that  he has
not  driven  on  a  suspended  license  after  his  2018  charge  in  State  B.  He  also  claimed
that  he  has  not  consumed  alcohol  and  driven  after  his  2010  DUI  arrest.  (Tr.  44-51;
Answer; AE A)
Applicant claimed that he has steadily cut back on his drinking after his 2010 DUI
arrest  and  conviction. He  was  drinking  about  a  six-pack  of  beer  every day  prior  to  his
2010  DUI.  In  2020,  he  claimed  that  he  was  drinking  a  12-pack  of  beer  two  weekends
per month. During the hearing, he testified that, after he obtained his driver’s license in
State C in 2020, he only drinks one or two beers at a sitting. However, he also testified
that he drank four beers at a sitting about three weeks before the hearing. He claimed
that  he  no  longer  drinks  to  the  point  of  intoxication.  However,  he  testified  that  he  was
last intoxicated in December 2021 after drinking 11 beers at one sitting while visiting his
family in State A.  He acknowledged  that, at some point  in  the past,  he had a problem
with  alcohol  and  considered  himself  to  be  an  alcoholic,  but  he  has  never  been
diagnosed  by  a  qualified  professional  as  having  an  alcohol  use  disorder.  He  claimed
that he has never tried to abstain from alcohol completely, but may when he is married
and has children. (Tr. 23-28, 52-56)
Applicant  provided  a  character-reference  letter  from  his  facility  security  officer

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h
and 2.b. He did not expressly admit or deny SOR ¶ 2.a, which cross-alleges SOR ¶¶ 1.a,
1.b,  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.g.  He  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  3.a  and  3.b,  but  with
explanations that amount to denials. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of

Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  mechanical  technician  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since June 2008. He graduated from high school and attended some college
courses but did not receive a degree. (Tr. 21.)  He has held a security clearance since
July  2009.  He  married  in  March  2017  and  separated  in  December  2019.  He  has  no
children.
In May 2008, Applicant was charged with carnal knowledge of a child, a felony. He
was 19 years old, was dating a 15-year-old girl, and had a sexual relationship with her.
The girl’s sister told their parents about the relationship. He pleaded guilty to contributing
to the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to eight weekends in
jail. (GX 10.) During an ESI in June 2018, Applicant told a security investigator the he did
not  think  he  was  doing  anything  wrong,  because  the  girl’s  mother  consented  to  their
relationship. (GX 4 at 18.)

remember missing a court date, but he accepted the fact that court records reflected the
offense. (Tr. 24.)
In  February  2010,  Applicant  was  charged  with  being  drunk  in  public.  He  was
convicted in April 2010 and required to pay restitution. (GX 9 at 5.)

months and 25 days suspended, He served two weekends in jail. (GX 8; GX 9 at 5.)
In February 2016, Applicant was suspended from work for three days because he
overslept due to alcohol consumption and missed his flight to a job location. He overslept
after drinking and arrived at the airport too late to check in. Someone else took his place
on the flight, and he switched places with his replacement two weeks later. (Tr. 24-25.)
In May 2018, Applicant was cited for urinating in public. He pleaded guilty and paid
a $60 fine. (GX 7.)
In   August  2019,  Applicant  was  charged   with   DWI,  2nd   offense.  He  had   been
drinking,   took   the   wrong   exit  off   a   highway,  and   ended   up   at   the   gate   of   a   military
installation where he could not turn around. He was arrested, pleaded guilty, was placed
on  probation  for 12  months, and  was sentenced  to  ten  days in jail,  which he  served  on
four  weekends.  The   terms  of  his  probation   included   refraining   from   excessive   use   of
alcohol,  and he  was required  to  complete an alcohol  safety  action  program  (ASAP).  (GX
6; Tr. 18-19.)  He  did  not report this conduct to  his employer  until he  went to  court.  His
employer suspended  him  without pay  for a  “few  days” for failure  to  report the  incident.  (Tr.
27.)
In July 2020, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor public drunkenness. This
incident occurred when he went to a friend’s house, found that the friend was not at home,
and  discovered  that  his  cellphone  was  dead.  He  lingered  around  the  house,  “trying  to
figure out how to get home.” Neighbors were suspicious and called the police. The police
arrived, smelled alcohol, and arrested him. He had consumed about eight beers and a
shot of alcohol. (Tr. 12-15.) He pleaded guilty, paid a $15 fine, and his probation for the
August 2019 DWI was extended for six months. (GX 5.) He reported this incident to his
employer, having learned his lesson for not reporting the August 2019 incident. (Tr. 27.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  abstained  from  alcohol  since  this  incident  in  July
2020. (Tr. 12.) He testified that he had attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings “in
and out” since 2019. His last AA meeting was in 2021. He stopped attending AA meetings
because he believed that he was finally on the right path. In 2020, he attended counseling
for about two months. He knows he has a drinking problem. He testified, “I wouldn’t say
I’m dependent on alcohol. I mean, I –it’s just, once I start, it’s always been difficult for me
to stop. It always  go extreme. And sadly enough, it took all this trouble for me to start
realizing that I needed to make changes.” (Tr. 20.)
Applicant  does  not  keep  alcohol  in  his house.  He  enjoys  playing  golf,  spending
time with his two young nieces, and hiking and camping with his girlfriend. He recently
bought a home, and he enjoys outdoor yard work. (Tr. 23.)
Applicant  submitted  an  SCA  in  April  2009.  He  answered  “No”  to  the  question,
“Have you EVER been charged with any felony offense?” He did not disclose that he was
charged with felony carnal knowledge of a child in May 2008. (GX 3 at 33.)
During  a  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  in  May  2009,  Applicant  told  the
investigator that he did not disclose the carnal knowledge charge in his SCA because he
was  told  by  an  unknown  person  that  his  record  would  be  cleared  if  he  completed  his
community service after his arrest for underage possession of alcohol. (GX 10 at 1.)
Applicant submitted another SCA in July 2016. In response to the same question
about ever being charged with a felony, he again answered “No,” and he failed to disclose
that he was charged with felony carnal knowledge of a child in May 2008. (GX 2 at 25.)
When he was interviewed by a security investigator in June 2018, he asserted that he did
not  read  the  question  carefully  enough  to  understand  that  the  question  asked  “ever”
instead of a specific timeframe. (GX 4 at 18.)
Applicant submitted a third SCA in August 2020. In response to the same question
about ever being charged with a felony, he again answered “No,” and he again failed to
disclose the felony charge of carnal knowledge in May 2008. (GX 1 at 31.) In his answer
to the SOR, he stated that he misunderstood the difference between being charged and
being convicted.
At the  hearing, Applicant  testified  that  when  he  was talking  to  investigators, he  was
talking  about  “the  situation” and  not  about whether  it was a  felony. He denied  that  he  was
hiding  anything, and  he  insisted  that  he  was confused  about  the  difference  between  being
“charged” and “convicted.” (Tr. 31.)
Two former supervisors submitted  statements on  Applicant’s behalf.  One former
supervisor has known Applicant personally and professionally for 15 years. He describes
Applicant as a natural leader and a reliable, trustworthy, and dependable worker. (AX B.)
Another former supervisor has known Applicant professionally for 14 years. She regards
Applicant as a trustworthy, responsible, and dependable individual. (AX A.)

Applicant attributed his alcohol issues at least partially to PTSD and dealing with
the  effects  from  his  two  combat  deployments.  By  2013,  he  was  drinking  almost  every
day. He was arrested in  January 2016  and charged with driving  while impaired  (DWI).
He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three days in jail, a fine, and court costs. (Tr. at
17-21; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  September  2019  and  charged  with  DWI  with  a  blood
alcohol concentration (BAC) of more than .15%. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced
in  March  2021  to  fines,  costs,  and  probation.  (Tr.  at  10-11,  21-28,  36;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Shortly  after  his  arrest  in  September  2019,  Applicant  entered  a  veterans
treatment  program  for  PTSD  and  alcohol  use  disorder.  He  reduced  his  alcohol
consumption  throughout  his  treatment  until  he  stopped  drinking  in  March  2021.  He
received  treatment  from  the  program  through  about  May  or  June  2022.  His  therapist
(M.A.,  LPC  (licensed  professional  counselor),  LCDC  (licensed  chemical  dependency
counselor))  wrote  in  October  2021  that  Applicant  was  “extremely  engaged  and
consistent  with  his  treatment.”  He  made  significant  progress  and  displayed  an
awareness  of  the  negative  impact  his  previous  alcohol  use  had  on  his  wellbeing.  The
therapist concluded:
[Applicant]   has  developed   healthier   coping   strategies  for  managing   his
PTSD  symptoms  as   well  as  coping   strategies  for  managing   his  urges  to
use   alcohol.   He  has  displayed   an   increased   ability   to   express  difficult
emotions  related   to   his  past   trauma   and   effectively   manages  these
emotions without the use of  alcohol. (Applicant’s response  to SOR)
Applicant  went  through  a  court-monitored  veterans  program  (separate  from  the
program discussed above) as part of his probation. He is required as a condition of his
probation to abstain from alcohol. He completed therapy and group sessions under the
program. The court certified that he graduated from the program in March 2022, and he
completed  the  aftercare  program  in  October  2022.  His  probation  runs  to  about  March
2023. (Tr. at 10-11, 27, 29-32, 35-36, 47-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A)
Applicant   initially   testified   that  he   had   been   abstinent  from   alcohol   since   March
2021.  He   later  admitted   that   he   violated   his  probation   in  June   2022   by   drinking.1   He
stated  he  had  significant stressors, including  the  death  of  his brother-in-law,  and he had
about four beers.  He was required  to  write  a   “think piece”   to  the  court explaining  what
happened,   and   the   court  increased   his  monitoring,   He  has  been   abstinent  since   June
2022  and  plans to  remain sober.  He relies on  the  skills he  learned  through  therapy  and
a strong support system through his friends and  family. (Tr. at 10, 12, 17, 32-37, 48)
The SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling about $15,475, including $3,841
in  child  support  arrearages.  The  debts  are  established  through  credit  reports  and
Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant has been paying $1,060 a month since October 2017 toward his child
support.  Part  of  each  payment  goes  to  the  arrearages.  (Tr.  at  12,  37-40;  Applicant’s

Applicant settled the $6,020 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 3.b with a $5,500 payment in
December  2021.  He  paid  the  $2,565  (SOR  ¶  3.c)  and  $1,842  (SOR  ¶  3.d)  debts.  He
contacted the Defense Finance and Accounting Service about the $1,210 debt  (SOR ¶

"The SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR ¶ 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline
J (SOR ¶ 3.a) and Guideline E (SOR ¶ 4.f), that Applicant was arrested for driving under
the influence (DUI) offenses in February 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and September 2018 (SOR ¶
1.b), and for operating under the influence (hereafter DUI) in October 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.c).
Under Guideline H (SOR ¶ 2.a), and cross-alleged under Guideline J (SOR ¶ 3.a) and
Guideline E (SOR ¶ 4.a), Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in February 2014,
while granted access to classified information, and charged with possession of less than
one-half ounce of cannabis.
Under  Guideline  E,  Applicant  is  also  alleged  to  have  falsified  a  May  17,  2017
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by not disclosing the 2014
marijuana possession charge in response to the police record inquiries (SOR ¶ 4.a) and
by denying any illegal drug involvement in response to a question concerning any drug
use while possessing a security clearance (SOR ¶ 4.b). Applicant is also alleged to have
concealed the September 2018 and October 2018 DUI offenses and the 2014 marijuana
possession  charge  when  questioned  during  his  December  2019  PSI  (SOR  ¶  4.c).
Additionally, Applicant allegedly failed to self-report his September 2018 (SOR ¶ 4.d) and
October 2018 (SOR ¶ 4.e) DUIs to his FSO.
Applicant denied all of the allegations when he responded to the SOR, including
the  DUIs,  which  he  denied  on  the  basis  that  he  had  passed  the  outpatient  programs
without incident and no recurrence since the October 2018 offense. He explained about
the marijuana charge that he was ticketed $50, but that the marijuana was left in his car
by  a  former  colleague.  He  asserted  he  had  forgotten  about  the  ticket  for  marijuana
possession,  and  he  denied  any  intentional  concealment  of  his  DUIs  or  the  marijuana
charge.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  high  school  graduate,  who  subsequently  completed
vocational  training  in  July  2005.  (GE  2.)  He  worked  as  a  technician  in  the  automotive
repair industry for over a decade before going to work in equipment repair for his current
employer, a defense contractor, in late May 2017. (AE A; Tr. 56.) He served honorably as
a wheeled vehicle mechanic with a clearance in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) from May
2007 to June or July 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 49-50, 56-57.) He has never married and has no
children. (GE 1; Tr. 56.)
On November 14, 2006, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-QIP
in application for a secret clearance for his Army enlistment. He listed two speeding tickets
from September 2005 and September 2006, but no other issues. (GE 2.) He was granted
a secret clearance for his duties in the military. (GE 1.)
On February 23, 2014, Applicant was stopped by the police in the parking lot of a
local  convenience  store.  He  exhibited  signs  of  intoxication,  including  glassy  eyes  and
slurred  speech.  He  told  the  police  he  had  consumed  four  beers  at  a  local  pub  and
admitted that he was “inebriated.”  The police directed him to a dry portion of the sidewalk.
After failing field sobriety tests, he was arrested for DUI. During an inventory search of
Applicant’s vehicle, the police found marijuana and two glass pipes containing marijuana
under his driver’s seat; marijuana residue in his center console; and a marijuana grinder
in the pocket of his driver’s door. (GE 5.) Applicant was subsequently charged with DUI
and possession of less than one half ounce of cannabis, first offense. He was fined $50
for  the  marijuana  charge.  (GE  3;  Tr.  48.)  Applicant  asserts  that  he  was  told  by  the
prosecutor that “it was the equivalent of a parking ticket with a $50 fine.” (Tr. 48.) For the
DUI, he was required to attend 15 alcohol-education classes. On his completion of the
classes, the charge was dismissed and his record was sealed. (GE 3.) He asserts that
his command in the USAR was aware of his arrest. (Tr. 51.)
On May 17, 2017, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-QIP for the
security clearance needed for his current employment. In response to the police record
inquiries,  he  reported  his  2014  arrest  for  DUI  and  indicated  that  he  had  to  attend  15
classes for the offense. He did not disclose that he had also been charged with, and fined
for, marijuana possession, and responded negatively to questions regarding illegal use
of drugs or drug activity including the following:
Have  you  EVER  illegally  used  or otherwise  been  involved  with  a drug  or
controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security  clearance  other  than
previously listed? (GE 1.)
Applicant’s clearance eligibility was renewed through the military about four or five months
after he submitted his e-QIP, and it was transferred for his work with a defense contractor.
(Tr. 60.)
On September 23, 2018, Applicant was on a business trip in another state for his
employer when he was pulled over for not having his headlights on. He told the police
that he had consumed three beers with dinner, but he had a strong odor of alcohol about
him and slurred speech. He failed field sobriety testing and was arrested for DUI. At the
police station, his blood alcohol content (BAC) tested at .14% by breathalyzer. (GE 4.)
Applicant  pled  guilty  to  DUI,  was  fined  $460,  and  ordered  to  attend  alcohol-education
classes  within  one  year.  As  of  December  4,  2019,  he  had  not  completed  the  required
alcohol-education classes as he was asking the court to accept classes taken as a result
of a subsequent DUI offense, committed in October 2018 in his state. (GE 3.)
Applicant consumed about four to five beers at a bar while out on a date in October
2018. He and his date drove separately, and he did not feel too impaired to drive safely.
He was pulled over while exiting a highway on suspicion of drunk driving. Applicant told
the  officer  that  he  had  consumed  some  alcohol  on  a  date,  and  he  failed  field  sobriety
tests. He was arrested for DUI and brought to the police station. Applicant recalls that his
breathalyzer result showed a .12% BAC. In April 2019, his driver’s license was suspended
pending the installation of an Interlock device  on his vehicle, which he had installed in
November 2019. He was placed on probation for 18 months, and was required to attend
eight  alcohol-education  classes,  and  complete  100  hours  of  community  service.  As  of
December 2019, he had attended seven alcohol-education classes but had yet to start
his  community  service  or  complete  the  alcohol-education  classes  required  for  his
September 2018 DUI in another state. (GE 3.)
On December 4, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator,
who  confirmed  that  Applicant  was  very  nervous.  (Tr.  26-27.)  When  asked  about  his
disclosed February 2014 DUI arrest, Applicant stated that he had consumed three to four
beers while playing video games in his home before driving to a local convenience store.
He claimed that he failed only one field sobriety test in that he could not walk a straight
line because of ice on the ground. He denied that any drugs were involved in that arrest;
that  he  ever  used  any  illegal  drugs;  and  that  he  had  an  additional criminal  charges  to
report since completing his e-QIP in May 2017. (GE 3; Tr. 19.) Additional questioning by
the investigator elicited an admission and details from Applicant about his October 2018
DUI, including that his BAC tested at .12% and that he was on 18 months of probation.
He  expressed  regret  for  the  incident,  but  asserted  that  he  did  not  believe  he  has  an
alcohol problem. (GE 3.)
When  asked  again  by  the  investigator  about  any  additional  arrests  or  any
association with drugs or drug-related arrests, Applicant responded negatively. (GE 3; Tr.
19-20.) He was then confronted about the February 2014 marijuana possession charge.
Applicant asserted that the marijuana found in his vehicle belonged to a former co-worker
who must have dropped it in his vehicle, although he also stated that he had never seen
this co-worker use or possess an illegal drug. Applicant expressed that he pled guilty to
possession  of  marijuana  because  the  drug  was  in  his  vehicle,  and  he  paid  a  fine.  He
denied  any  intention  to  conceal  the  drug  charge,  and  explained  that  he  had  forgotten
about it when he completed his e-QIP and when questioned during his PSI. (GE 3.)
After discussing the drug charge with the investigator, Applicant again denied any
additional arrests or charges involving drugs or alcohol before additional questioning by
the investigator disclosed his arrest for DUI while out of state on business in September
2018. (GE 3; Tr. 20-21.) He explained that he believed he passed field sobriety testing,
but  admitted  that  he  “blew  a  .12  failing  the  [breathalyzer]  test.”  He  admitted  that,  in
February 2019, he pled guilty to DUI, paid a $460 fine, and was sentenced to complete
alcohol-education classes within one year. He explained that he had not disclosed  the
arrest in response to previous questioning because he was scared that it would adversely
affect  his  security  clearance  eligibility.  He  stated  that  he  reported  the  incident  to  his
supervisor,  co-workers,  and military command,  but not  to his FSO because  he did not
know that it  was  required.  (GE 3.)  The investigator recalls  that  Applicant provided  him
with contact information for his military chain of command and for his civilian department
head, who could corroborate his self-report (Tr. 27), and that Applicant told him that he
did not know he had to notify his FSO. (Tr. 31-32.)
The  investigator  flagged  Applicant  as  having  questionable  integrity  because  he
had to question Applicant numerous times, and had to confront him with the evidence of
the  charges  before  Applicant  provided  the  information  about  his  2018  DUIs  and  2014
drug charge. (Tr. 22-23.) However, the investigator believes that, after Applicant admitted
that he  had  not  disclosed  his September 2018  DUI  because of  fear it  would  affect his
clearance, Applicant was “as transparent as possible with [him] after the fact in regards
to self-admitting.” (Tr. 23.)
Applicant testified about his PSI as follows:
As the  interview  went along, yes, I was very nervous. It  was an  interview
that randomly  came  up  with  no  knowledge  of  anything  that was occurring.
So   yes,  I  was  absolutely   nervous.  And   I  do   not  believe   I  was  asked   that
many   times   to   recollect.   From   my   memory   I   do   remember  Special   Agent
[name  omitted] asking  me  was there anything  else.  And  I stuttered  when  I
told him. And  told him  about the  DUIs.  And  my   verbiage  at the  end  was,
yes, I am  aware that  these  can  affect  your security  clearance  that’s why  that
makes  me  nervous. Not the  fact that I  was hiding  it made  me  nervous. So
that was also a  clear misinterpretation  of  what I was saying  or what I thought
I clearly  came  across with  towards him. And  still, I was very  nervous of  what
was going on, not knowing what was going on. Because this process has
also, the actual investigation is also, came up when it started in 2020. Has
also stopped me from reenlisting in the [USAR]. (Tr. 49-50.)
Applicant testified at his hearing that he never tried to hide his DUIs from anybody
and that he “clearly and openly” talked to his bosses and co-workers as a group. He also
testified  that  he  made  his  motor  sergeant,  platoon  sergeant,  first  sergeant,  and
commander in the USAR aware of his DUIs because he knew they could affect his career.
(Tr. 51.) He asserts that he was told by his co-workers to make sure he reported any DUIs
on  his  e-QIP.  (Tr.  52-53.)  As  for  his  alleged  concealment  of  the  marijuana  charge,
Applicant testified as follows:
And   [the   special  agent]   asked   me   several  times  about  the   marijuana.   I
honestly   didn’t  remember   that  charge.  Or  that  ticket.   Because   my
information was that it was a ticket so I could throw that out of  my memory.
The  thing  to  worry  about was the  DUI and  making  sure  that got  out  on  my
e-QIP. And  then  going  from my  DUIs,  making sure I don’t get another one.
(Tr. 53.)
When asked on cross-examination to explain why he did not tell the investigator
about  his  2018  DUIs  when  asked  about  any  additional  alcohol  offenses,  Applicant
responded that he did inform the investigator. As to why he had to be questioned so many
times,  Applicant  disputed  that  the  interview  went  as  the  investigator  reported  in  his
summary (GE 3) and testified. Applicant maintains he never denied any other arrests (Tr.
59), and provided the following account of the PSI:
I’m  saying  that’s not  what happened. The  way  he  was asking  the  questions
is not  the  way  that  that  is written  down. Because  the  way  he  was asking  me
the  questions  is, are you  sure, and  I  said,  I’m  sorry, let  me  correct that.  He
asked   me,  is   there  anything   else.   And   I   can   adamantly   say,  I  wasn’t
reluctant  but nervously saying  yes there is,  there was this, Okay, is there
anything  else.  Still  reluctantly  saying, yes. Because  I’m  nervous as hell. (Tr.
61.)
During his December 2019 PSI, Applicant expressed a belief that he does not have
an alcohol problem. He attributed his DUI arrests to bad luck. He initially described his
current  alcohol  consumption  as  four  to  five  12-ounce  beers  within  a  four  to  five-hour
period once weekly, usually on the weekends, and said that has been his drinking pattern
before and after his February 2014 DUI. Later during his PSI, Applicant reportedly said
that  he  was  drinking  four  to  five  beers  approximately  once  a  month.  (GE  3.)  Neither
Applicant nor the investigator was asked about the discrepancy. At his June 2022 hearing,
Applicant described his current consumption as “maybe one beer on a Friday.” (Tr. 68.)
He explained that he drank out of habit, and that once he resumed raising animals and
doing  his  community  service  and  other  activities  that  he  enjoys,  he  found  his  drinking
habit easy to break. (Tr. 71.)
The alcohol-education classes required for the October 2018 DUI were apparently
accepted in fulfillment of the alcohol-education required by the out-of-state court for his
September  2018  DUI.  (Tr.  72.)  Applicant  admitted  triggering  his  Interlock  device  in
December 2019, when he consumed some alcohol-laced egg nog. (Tr. 71-72.) He was
originally  ordered  to  have  an  Interlock  device  on  his  vehicle  for  two  years,  but  it  was
extended to five years  because he missed two calibrations, which each added a year,
and he  drove  a  vehicle  without  an Interlock device  in  July 2020,  which  added  another
year. (Tr. 74-75.)
In  October 2021, Applicant  was pulled  over while  driving  to  work in  a  new  car  for
him.  He did  not have  an  Interlock  device in  the  vehicle,  and  was charged  with  driving  on
a  suspended  license.  He testified  that he  thought he  was no  longer subject  to  the  Interlock
requirement based  on  paperwork that he  had  and  that he  did  not know  his license  had
been  suspended. He testified  there is  conflict  between  the  Interlock device provider and
the  state  as to  whether he  had  the  device removed. He paid a  fine  for  texting  while  driving
and   had   the   Interlock  device  installed   (Tr.  77-78),  but  he   is  having   problems  with   the
device.  He  has  been   reported   three   times,   most   recently   in  about   February   2022,   for
violating  the Interlock. He asserts it  is due  to faulty  installation  in that  if he  leaves the  car
with  the  lights on, the  Interlock is recorded  as  still  being  on  (“if  you  leave  the  lights on  and
walk away  the  machine  is still  going  and  it reported  him  as missing  a  breath.”). (Tr. 79-
80.) He explained  that he  has not had  the  wiring  of  the  device inspected  because  he  has
to take time  from work. (Tr. 80-81.) He does not want to be  accused  of tampering so  has
not tried  to  correct the issue. (Tr. 81.)  The driving  while license  suspended  charge  is still
pending, and he has appeared  four times in court on that charge. (Tr. 78.)
Applicant performed his community service for his October 2018 DUI by providing
assistance to a local Boy Scout troop starting in June 2020. He continued to volunteer
after completing his community service, and as of June 2022 he had provided over 250
hours. The scoutmaster attested to his completion of those hours. She has no knowledge
of  any  information  that  would  compromise  Applicant’s  status  with  the  scouting
organization. (AE B.) Applicant has been a registered den leader for a Cub Scout pack
for the past six months. (Tr. 54-55.)
Applicant denies any use of marijuana. He testified that he was subjected to drug
testing  by  urinalysis  primarily  once  a  month  during  his  13  years  in  the  USAR,  and  he
never  failed  a  drug  screen.  (Tr.  50-51.)  He  testified  to  recalling  that  the  police  found
marijuana  “hidden  underneath  the  passenger  seat”  of  his  vehicle.  (Tr.  64.)  When
confronted with the police report of marijuana being in a glass jar under the driver’s seat,
Applicant  responded,  “I  thought  it  was  under  the  passenger  seat,  but  it  was  not  my
marijuana.” As for the police finding glass pipes with burnt marijuana in the center console
of his vehicle, Applicant stated, “They weren’t mine, so they had to have been his.” (Tr.
65.) As for the grinder found in the pocket of the driver’s door, Applicant explained:
In the interview I stated that I gave [his former co-worker] a ride earlier and
dropped him off at a place called [pub name omitted] where he waited for a
ride. I waited with him, then I went home and played video games. I was
drinking at my house and then went to the [convenience store] to where i
got pulled over. (Tr. 65.)
Applicant maintains that he did not know any of the drug paraphernalia had been in his
car before he was provided a copy of the police report by DOHA Department Counsel as
he had only paid a $50 “ticket” in court. (Tr. 66.)
Character References
Applicant’s chief union steward authored a character reference letter for Applicant
(AE A) and also testified (Tr. 38-46.) The union steward has worked for their employer
since 1989 and has a secret clearance. He has been a union steward for 15 years, and
president  and  chief  steward  of  the  union  “going  on  seven  years  now.”  (Tr.  40-42.)  He
testified that he did not understand until a couple of months ago that employees have a
duty to self-report information that could affect security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 40.) The
chief steward previously understood that it is when individuals come up for the ten-year
review of their clearance that they are required to be forthcoming about everything that
has happened understood “within the first ten years and the second.” (Tr. 39.) The chief
steward recalled an issue involving an employee who had an incident  while intoxicated
that  the employee  reported  to  his supervisor  and not  the  FSO,  but he  could  not  recall
whether their employer took any steps to inform employees of a duty to self-report to the
FSO. (Tr. 43-44.) The chief steward believes that he is “probably not” required to report
a union member who informs him of a legal problem, but he would advise him or her to
inform  his or her  supervisor.  (Tr. 44-45.)  The  chief  steward  attests  that  Applicant  “has
been  a  model  employee  gaining  respect  of  management,  fellow  employees,  and  [his]
entire team of union officers.” (AE A.)
Applicant  provided  character  reference  letters  from  five  co-workers  (AEs  C-G),
who attest to it being common knowledge that Applicant was arrested for DUI while on a
road job for their employer in 2018. A co-worker who works with Applicant on a daily basis
recalled  hearing  in  2018  about  Applicant’s  arrest.  He  indicated  that  Applicant  was
forthright  about  the arrest  when  questioned  on  his  return,  and  that  Applicant  was  also
candid about his subsequent DUI. This co-worker stated that if it was common knowledge
to notify their FSO of arrests, he would have asked Applicant if he had self-reported and
encouraged  him  to do so.  He  asserts  that  Applicant has  taken  positive  steps  to  better
himself  in  the  last  five  years  and  requests  consideration  of  the  negative  impact  on
Applicant’s personal growth should he lose his clearance. (AE E.)

refused to leave; the hotel called the police; and the police arrested him. (Id.; GE 2 at 41)
Alcohol was a factor in this incident. He pleaded guilty to criminal trespass. (Id. at 32) The
court  sentenced  him  to  pay  a  fine  and  to  90  days  of  probation.  (Id.)  The  charge  was
dismissed after he completed probation. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges in about November 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  DUI.  Applicant’s  only  listed  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  result  of  .17  was  from  a
blood test for this DUI. (March 22, 2019 OPM PSI at 6; GE 3) His highest blood-alcohol

SOR ¶ 1.k alleges in about October 2018, Applicant discontinued alcohol treatment
against  advice.  Applicant  attended  a  behavioral  health  outpatient  alcohol  treatment
program (BHOATP) for nine months. (GE 4 at 1) The SOR does not allege; however, that
the February 13, 2018 intake assessment form for the BHOATP says, “Client reports long
Hx  of  alcohol  dependence.  Reports  recent  alcohol  bender  over  the  weekend,  LDU
2/11/18.” (GE 4 at 2) The BHOATP intake form indicates he “lacks insight into problem”

classes. (Id.) After completion of all sentencing requirements, the record was sealed and
expunged. (Tr. 29)
To summarize, from 1999 to November 2003, Applicant was arrested for four DUIs.
He consumed excessive amounts of alcohol for several years during this period because
of the stress and shock related to the end of his nine-year marriage in 1998. (Tr. 20, 30)
He did not have any problems with alcohol for eight years (2003-2011). He was always
alone in his vehicle when the police stopped him for DUIs. (Tr. 53)
Applicant  relapsed   in   2011   when   his  father  passed   away   and   due   to   a   toxic
romantic relationship.  (Tr. 20, 37) From  2011  to  2016, he  had  five  alcohol-related  arrests
and   an   alcohol-related   probation   violation.  (Tr.  38)  After  his  most  recent  DUI   arrest  in
2016, he  attended  several outpatient alcohol counseling  and  treatment programs. (Tr. 44-
45)  He   ended   the   toxic  relationship,   and   he   does  not   associate   with   the   people  who
consumed  alcohol with  him  during  the  2011  to  2016  time  period. (Tr. 20) The  police  have
not  arrested   him   since   2016.  (Tr.  20)  He  attends  faith-based   meetings  in  a   12-step
program,   which  is  similar  to   the   12-step   program   in  the   Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
program. (Tr. 21, 46-48) He accepted  that he is an alcoholic. (Tr. 21) He does not intend
to   consume   alcohol  in   the   future.  (Tr.  22)  He   denied   that  he   was  impaired   at  work  by
alcohol consumption. (Tr. 31, 53)
Applicant does not believe future incidents involving the police and courts will occur
because he admitted his problem with alcohol, and he took action to address it. (Tr. 23)
In 2003, and June 2007, he completed the ASAP training courses. (AE E) In April 2018,
he  successfully  completed  an  intensive  outpatient  treatment  program.  (GE  4  at  7)  He
denied any alcohol consumption after November of 2016. (Tr. 41; GE 2 at 42) He has a
healthier lifestyle. (Tr. 51) He watches what he eats and exercises. (Tr. 51) He promised
not to operate a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol. (Tr. 24; AE B) If he chooses to
consume alcohol in the future, he promised to consume alcohol in a responsible manner.
(AE B) He ended a stressful toxic romantic relationship, and he does not associate with
others who abuse alcohol. (Tr. 23) He has continued his sobriety, associates with others
who share his goal of sobriety, and he frequently attends his 12-step program. (Tr. 23;
GE 2 at 50; GE 3 at 2) He did not provide a statement from his sponsor or other attendees
of his 12-step program about his commitment to sobriety and his efforts to maintain his
sobriety.

glove compartment to retrieve his registration, they discovered a handgun.  (GE 2 at 6)
Subsequently,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  transporting  a  handgun  on  a
roadway. After a court placed him on probation before judgment for 18 months, the charge
was dismissed. (Tr. 15)
Applicant was in the military when he was charged with the handgun violation. The
gun was legally registered, and he had just been transferred from a state where it was legal
to have a handgun in one’s automobile. He was unfamiliar with the gun laws of his new
state of residence when the arrest occurred. (Tr. 15)
In  December  2015,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while
intoxicated  (DWI)  and  failure  to  stop/elude  the  police.  (Answer  at  1)  The  failure  to
stop/elude the police charge was nolle prossed. (GE 10 at 7) He was found guilty of the
DWI  charge,  given  a  30-day suspended  jail sentence,  and  placed  on  probation for 12
months. As part of probation, his license was suspended and he had to attend an alcohol
safety program. Also, the court ordered the installation of an ignition lock on Applicant’s car
for six months. (Answer at 1)
In January 2016, while on probation, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.
Subsequently, he was found guilty and given  a one-year suspended jail sentence, two
years supervised probation,  fined $1,500, and ordered to attend six months of alcohol
counseling. (Answer at 2; GE 2 at 6) Applicant completed the requirements of probation.
(GE 2 at 7) Per the lead counselor of the alcohol program, Applicant “was an attentive and
active participant, and contributed with good thoughts in group session,” and it appeared
“that he ha[d] gained knowledge on the consequences of alcohol . . . in his life.” (GE 7 at 2)
Applicant  stopped  drinking  alcohol  after  this  most  recent  DUI  arrest,  and  continues  to
remain  sober.  (Tr.  28)  He  included  his  DUI  charges  on  his  2018  security  clearance
application, as required. (GE 1 at 34-37)
In April 2017, Applicant was issued a citation for violating the terms of parole by
attempting to drive on a suspended license. (GE 8 at 7) Applicant denies this allegation,
contending that his license was not suspended; rather, it was turned in to the motor vehicle
administration when he moved to another state and applied for a new license.  (Tr. 26)
Applicant did not provide any documentation in support of this contention. He was found
guilty.
In August 2019, Applicant was charged with displaying a registered plate issued for
another vehicle. He was found guilty and fined $70. (GE 9 at 19)
Applicant  completed   a   security   clearance   application   in  February   2018.   He
answered “no” to a question requiring  applicants  to  disclose  any  debts  that  were  more  than
120  days past due, as of  the  execution  date  of  the  security  clearance  application.  (GE  1  at
41)  When  Applicant completed  the  application, he  was more than  120  days  delinquent on
mortgage  payments for a  rental property  that he  owned. (Tr. 30) Specifically, Applicant
purchased  the  property  in 2000. (GE 2  at 6)  After he  left the  Army  and  joined  the  Air  Force
in 2003, Applicant moved, but kept the  property  to  rent out. (Tr. 21) In  approximately  2012,
the  tenant moved  out,  at or about the  time  Applicant’s wife  lost  her job. (Tr. 21; GE  4  at 3)
Unable to  find  another tenant and  unable to  pay  the  mortgage  without  receiving  rent  money
to  offset it, the  mortgage  became  delinquent.  Applicant knew  that  he  and  his  wife  had  been
struggling  to  make  mortgage  payments,  but “didn’t know  the  exact extent of  it,” as his wife
was handling  the  payments and  the  property  was located  in another state. (Tr. 32  - 33) At
the  time  of  the  foreclosure, payments  had  been  delinquent  for  approximately  six  years.  (GE

By November 2019, the mortgage loan had been foreclosed upon, and the home
was sold at auction. (GE 5 at 1) Applicant owed no deficiency after the sale. (Tr. 35; GE 5

Applicant is indebted on an auto loan account that was charged off in the amount of
$3,837.  He incurred this debt in 2018 when he took his car to an auto shop for repairs and
could not afford the repair cost. (Tr. 22, 38) Applicant disputed the repair cost amount to
the shop owner, and “they basically ended up selling the car at an auction.” (Tr. 38) The
auto lender received the proceeds of the sale. (Tr. 22)
Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  collection  agent  for  a  delinquent  phone  bill,  totaling
$1,182. Applicant denies the debt. (Answer at 2) He is working to remove it from his credit

substantiating the basis of his denial.
Applicant earns $85,000 annually. (Tr. 46) He has $2,000 in savings. Applicant’s
adult children and his grandchild live in his home. He helps his children pay their college
tuition. (Tr. 40-41) According to his wife, he is “a strong and stable, husband, father, friend,

31)  He   said  his  blood   alcohol  content  (BAC)   was  close   to   .08;  however,  he   did  not
remember the  specific BAC. (Tr. 67, 93; AE  B  at 9) He pleaded  guilty  to  a  lesser charge
than  the  DWI, and  the  careless driving  charge  was dismissed. (Tr. 31) The  offense  in  the
docket  is “unclassified  misdemeanor,” and  it  may  not be  an  alcohol-related  offense.  (AE
B at 9) He was sentenced to 12 months of probation, 24 hours of community service, and
a fine. (Tr. 31) He was under the age of 21 at the time of this offense.
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges in about September 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged
with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant was sitting in his vehicle when
he was arrested for DUI. (Tr. 33; GE 2 at 4-5) His girlfriend called the police and accused
him of stalking her. (Tr. 69) Prior to his arrest, he was drinking excessively in the aftermath
of the break up with his girlfriend. (Tr. 33) The BAC related to this arrest is unknown. In
April 2015, he was convicted of DUI and sentenced to 36 months of probation, 48 hours
in jail, to pay a fine, and to attend a 40-hour alcohol-awareness class. (Tr. 34, 69-70; AE
B at 47) He completed his sentence to jail and the alcohol-awareness class, and he paid
his fine. (Tr. 70) One of the conditions of his probation was to not commit any criminal
offenses, and to not operate a motor vehicle with any intoxicant in his body. (Tr. 71; AE
B at 46)
In  November  2016,  the  court  was  informed  that  Applicant  violated  probation  by
driving with alcohol in his system as set forth in SOR ¶ 1.e, infra. (AE B at 44) In November
2016, he was arraigned on the probation violation, and he received a fine of $1,666. (AE
B  at  43)  In  January  2017,  Applicant  was  tried  for  a  probation  violation,  and  he  was
sentenced  to  six  days  in  jail.  (AE  B  at  42-43)  In  April  2018,  his  probation  expired  by
operation of law, and the court noted all fines and fees were paid. (AE B at 42) It is unclear
from the record whether probation violations are considered separate convictions under
state law.
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges in about February 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged
with  public  intoxication.  (GE  2  at  20-11)  Applicant  admitted this allegation.  (Tr. 34) He
was walking from a bar back to his hotel, and he said he slipped on some ice and fell. (Tr.
34; GE 2 at 2) There was no breathalyzer test. (Tr. 94) He was unsure about whether his
conviction was for an alcohol-related offense. (Tr. 92) He received a small fine from the
court. (Tr. 34; GE 2 at 2).
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges and Applicant admitted that in about July 2016, he was arrested
and charged with DUI. (Tr. 36; GE 2 at 9-10; SOR response) He refused a breathalyzer
and  blood-alcohol  test.  (Tr.  94)  He  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI,  and  he  received  a  deferred
sentence. (Tr. 36; GE 2 at 10)
SOR ¶  1.f  alleges that  in  about January  2017,  Applicant was arrested  and  charged
with  three  counts of  DUI.  He denied  that he  was charged  with  three  counts of  DUI.  (Tr.
37) He admitted  that  he  violated  the  terms of  his three-year probation, which was based
on  his SOR ¶  1.c September 2014  DUI offense, and  his probation  was revoked. (Tr. 37,
74-75) He served six  days in jail, and  he paid his fine. (Tr. 76-77) His probation “expired”
on April 21, 2018. (Tr. 37) His probation violation is resolved. (Tr. 78)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges Applicant admitted that he drove under the influence of alcohol
about  30  times.  He  denied  this  allegation.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant’s  April  7,  2021  OPM  PSI
indicates  “From  2008  until 2015,  subject  speculated  that  he  drove  under the  influence
about 30 times.” (GE 3 at 1) Applicant said he told the OPM investigator that he drank a
beer and then drove on multiple occasions; however, he did not believe he was under the
influence of alcohol when he was driving. (Tr. 37, 78-80)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges that in 2015, Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of having
a blackout. Applicant admitted the allegation. (Tr. 38; SOR response) Applicant’s April 7,
2021  OPM  PSI  indicates  “he  has  blacked  out  on  a  few  occasions;  he  was  not  more
specific. Subject last consumed alcohol to the point of having a blackout . . . in 2016.” (GE
3 at 2) At his hearing, he said he had not had a blackout. (Tr. 80, 97-98)
Applicant has never been hospitalized for alcohol consumption. (Tr. 80) He has
not attended any Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (Tr. 86) He denied that he had
been  ordered  to  seek alcohol-related  counseling.  (GE  1  at  43) He did  not  receive  any
recommendations for additional alcohol treatment after he completed the court-ordered
alcohol awareness class. (Tr. 86) He promised not to drive after consuming any alcohol.
(Tr. 37, 43) He promised not to excessively consume alcohol. (Tr. 43; SOR response, Ex.
A)
In  sum,  Applicant  has  five  alcohol-related  arrests  or  charges  and  about  three
alcohol-related  convictions.  (Tr.  91-92)  His  2003  DUI  arrest  resulted  in  an  unspecified
misdemeanor conviction, and his February 2015, public intoxication arrest may not have
resulted in an alcohol-related conviction. His 2017 alcohol-related charge was a probation
violation for his 2016 DUI arrest. Applicant believes he has been responsibly consuming
alcohol for several years. His current alcohol consumption is an occasional glass of wine
with dinner. (Tr. 86) He most recently drank three or four beers during a single day about
six days before his hearing. (Tr. 99)
SOR ¶ 2.a cross alleges that the information in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e under the
criminal conduct guideline.
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges in June 2016, a protective order was filed against  Applicant,
and in December 2019, three counts of violation of the protection order were filed against
Applicant. Applicant’s live-in girlfriend filed a protective order; however, after she filed it,
she and her daughter sent Applicant messages over the Internet. (Tr. 38-39) Applicant
responded to their messages in violation of the protection order. (Tr. 39) In his December
16, 2020 SCA, Applicant said that he was aware of two warrants issued in 2016 and 2017.
(GE 1 at 40) He said the warrants were for emails he sent in violation of the protection
order. In the SCA, he described his plans for resolution of the warrant as follows:
I’ve  recently  found  out  that [she]  had  previously  complained  that I violated
the  protective   order and   there   are  court   proceedings  regarding   this issue
. . . I  have  an  attorney  and  plan  to  fight  the  allegations. We  are  waiting  for
the  window  of  opportunity  to  address these  issues. COVID-19  has been  a
major inhibitor in being  able to  address these  issues faster. I  plan  on  visiting
[the city where the court is located] after Christmas and New Year break to
address the issue. (GE 1 at 39)
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  said  he  learned  about  the  arrest  warrant  during  the
security clearance process. (Tr. 82) The three counts are unresolved; however, Applicant
has a counsel who is helping him get the charges resolved. (Tr. 40) The bond is $8,000,
and Applicant is saving money for the bond. (Tr. 40; AE B at 2) There is a possibility the
bond might be waived or reduced. (Tr. 81) He intends to travel to the court where he has
an open warrant for violations of a protection order “as soon as possible.” (Tr. 101)  On
September 19, 2022, he promised to report to the court to address the charges in the next
calendar year. (AE B at 11)
SOR ¶ 3.a cross alleges the information in SOR ¶¶ 1 and 2 under the personal
conduct guideline.
Applicant is actively involved in his community. (Tr. 43) He does charity bike rides
and teaches yoga classes. (Tr. 43) He loves his work and his coworkers. (Tr. 43)
Financial Considerations-Federal Income  Tax Returns
In Applicant’s December 16, 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had not filed
his tax returns for TYs 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. (GE 1 at 46-47) He did not owe any
taxes.  (Id.) He  made  arrangements  to  file  these  tax  returns,  and  he  was  “honestly  not
aware that not filing was adverse information  as [he] had been letting the Government
keep some of [his] money.” (Id.)
In 2021, Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2016, 2017,
2018, 2019, and 2020. (Tr. 62-63; AE B at 33-37) His TY 2016 federal income tax return
is  dated  April  6,  2021.  (AE  B  at  34)  Most  of  the  other tax  documents  he  provided  are
undated and unsigned. (AE B at 33, 35-37) He filed the overdue tax returns before he
received  the  SOR  in  November  2021.  (Tr.  96)  He  was  traveling  frequently  for  his
employment, and he said his failure to timely file his tax returns was “neglectful.” (Tr. 96)
He did not owe any taxes. (Tr. 62)
Credibility Issues
Applicant’s  resume  submitted  as  Exhibit  D  to  his  SOR  response  indicates  he
received a “BS” in aeronautical science in July 2014. In his December 16, 2020 SCA, he
indicated he attended a university from May 2011 to October 2014 (Estimated); however,
he did not receive a degree in aeronautical science. (GE 1 at 14) At his hearing, he said
he does not have a bachelor of science degree. (Tr. 48-49)
In Applicant’s December 2016 SCA,  Applicant said he had only two DUIs, which
were  in  September  2014  (Estimated)  and  July  2016  (Estimated).  (GE  1  at  43)  At  his
hearing,  he  said  he  failed  to  disclose  his  2003  DUI  on  his  December  16,  2020  SCA
because it was disclosed on previous SCAs. (Tr. 87) He said he unintentionally failed to
disclose his February 2015 public intoxication arrest. (Tr. 87-90)
",True
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b,
and SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.c, but denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 3..a, regarding falsification of
his October 2017 and February 2, 2021 SCAs in response to Section 23 –Illegal Use of
Drugs or Drug Activity and Illegal Use of Drugs or Controlled Substances in the last seven
years,  and  while  possessing  a  security  clearance  have  you  ever  illegally  used  or
otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance by answering “No”; and SOR
¶ 3.b. as cross-alleged under SOR ¶ 2.a through 2.c. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact (Item 1)
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  systems  engineer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  November  2015.  He  is  unmarried  and  has  no  children.  He  obtained  an
undergraduate degree in 2014. He reported no military service.  Applicant has worked for
defense  contractors  since  2014,  with  short  periods  of  unemployment  when  he  was
working  on  personal  projects  from  November  2014  until  June  2015.  He  obtained  a
security clearance in 2017. (Item 2)
Guideline J: Criminal Conduct
The allegation in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b involved an arrest in November 2014, with a
charge of possession of marijuana, and the alleged arrest in May 2019, with a charge of
possession  of  marijuana.  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  but  noted  that  the
marijuana  was  obtained  through  dispensaries  and  used  for  sleep  assistance  and  to
increase his appetite. For his 2014 marijuana possession offense, he was charged with
a misdemeanor, first offense, received a ticket, probation, and a fine. (Items 1, 4)
In  Applicant’s  2021,  personal  subject  interview  (PSI),  he  volunteered  to  the
investigator that he was offered marijuana by his cousin, and purchased some marijuana
from him in 2014. (Item 4) He put some marijuana in his vehicle trunk on the way home,
and was stopped for speeding by a police officer. Applicant was  taken to jail, and was
able to bail himself out. The PSI report states that he went to court at some point and he
“was told to submit dismissal paperwork.” (Item 4) Applicant told the investigator that later
he found out the case was dismissed.
Guideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance  Abuse
In  his  answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  three  SOR  allegations  that  he  used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  2012  to  about  July  2021  (2.a);  that  he
purchased  and  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  2012  to  about  July
2021 2.b; and 2.c, that he purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from
about July 2018 to about July 2021, while granted access to classified information. (Item
1)
However, in that same answer, he  stated that the  “time  span was persuaded by
the investigator during the interview as a general from and to date.”  During his 2018 PSI,
he stated that “estimated months and dates noted are fairly accurate.”
Applicant volunteered information about the May 2019 arrest for purchase and use
of marijuana from his cousin. He told the investigator that it was an open case because
he  did  not  know  that  his  case  had  been  fully  dismissed.  (Item  4)  It  is  not  clear  what
Applicant meant by that statement.
Applicant used marijuana in college from 2012 to 2014. He also used marijuana
perhaps once a year over the next couple of years for recreational use. He stated that he
purchased from vendors in states where marijuana was legal from 2019 to the present
when he was on vacation.  Applicant was drug tested when he was hired and stated that
he understood the employer  policy on illegal drug use, and that it is against policy to use
marijuana while in federal employment. He believes that the legalization of marijuana is
coming  and that it should not be an issue. (Item 4)
Applicant stated that he used the marijuana also to assist with his anxiety and to
make  him  feel  relaxed  and  creative.  He  emphasized  that  he  has  not  developed  any
dependency  on  marijuana  and  has  had  no  counseling  or  treatment.  He  compares  his
marijuana use to alcohol. His future intent does not include the use of marijuana, so that
he  can  keep  his  job  and  security  clearance.  Applicant  would  use  it  if  marijuana  was
legalized. However, currently he will refrain from marijuana use, although he could not
rule out using marijuana in the future if it is legalized. He stressed that his use of marijuana
has “no criminal intent.” (Item 4)
Guideline E:  Personal Conduct
The SOR alleged in SOR 3.a and 3.b that Applicant falsified material facts on his
October  17,  2017  and  February  2,  2021  SCAs  by  answering  “NO”  to  the  questions  in
Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs of Drug Activity as set forth in subparagraph 1.a and
1.b, and 2.a through 2.c above. It further alleged that had he denied ever using drugs or
otherwise being involved with a drug substance while possessing a security clearance
and he answered “NO.”
Applicant  denied  the  falsification  allegations  because  he  believes  he  made  a
mistake in assuming the other sections correlated. He claimed he answered the question
incorrectly by an honest mistake. He believes the process to be very difficult. He added
that due to having previously submitted SCAs and having pre-populated information the
resubmission had an error in it. He added that he would be willing to discuss any items
with the investigator if needed. He stated that he did not report the use because he did
not believe it was serious. (Item 4) He has held a security clearance since 2017. On both
SCAs,  he  answered  “NO.”  to  have  you  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been  illegally
involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other
than previously listed? He did not add any information concerning this issue in his 2022
DOHA interrogatories. He insisted in his subject interview that he was never going to list
the information concerning use of marijuana on his SCA because he wanted to tell an
investigator whenever he was interviewed. He admitted that he was properly trained on
reporting of  such issues, but just did not think about it when he recertified his security
clearance  application.  (Item  4)  Applicant  made  no  clarifications  to  his  reasons  for
omission except that he would disclose to the investigator.

",False
"Due   to   extensive   changes   to   the   original  SOR,  I  had   Applicant  confirm   at  the
hearing   her  admission   or  denial   to   the   remaining   SOR  allegations   alleged   under
Guidelines  J, G, F, and  E. She  admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.d,  1.f,  1.g, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o,  1.t, 1.u,
1.y, 1.aa, 1.bb, 3.a  through  3.j, and  4.c.  She  denied   SOR ¶¶  1.l,  1.q, 1.v, 2.a, 3.k,  and
3.l. SOR ¶¶  1.b, 1.c,  1.e,  1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.p, 1.r, 1.s,  1.w, 1.x, 1.z, 4.a, and  4.b  were
withdrawn.  SOR  ¶¶   1.aa,  and   1.bb   were  added   to   the   SOR.   Having   thoroughly
considered   the   evidence   in  the   record,  including   Applicant's  admissions,  I  make   the
following findings of  fact:  (Tr. 7-8, 11-14)
Applicant is 40 years old. She recently married in September 2022, and she has
two  daughters,  ages  14  and  16,  from  a  previous  relationship.  She  receives  $200
monthly in child support. She earned an associate’s degree in 2006. She began working
for  her  current  employer  in  November  2018.  She  started  out  as  a  customer  service
representative, and in 2021, she was promoted to a clinical support coordinator position
with  a  pay  increase.  Her  employer  requires  her  to  be  cleared  for  a  position  of  trust  to
perform specific employment duties. (GE 1; Tr. 27-30, 69)
The  SOR  alleged  approximately  25  incidents  of  criminal  conduct  and  rule
violations under Guideline J, as follows:
During the hearing, SOR ¶ 1.a. was determined to be a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.aa.
It alleged an incorrect date of the same offense. (Tr. 30-33, 62-65; GE 1) The allegation
in SOR ¶ 1.a is mitigated.
Applicant was arrested in 2012 and again in 2017, for operating a motor vehicle
while under the influence of alcohol. (SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 1.u, and 1.aa.) She was found guilty
of both offenses, and she was required to go to an alcohol education class for the first
conviction,  and  a  multiple  offender  class  for  her  second  conviction.  Both  sentences
included a requirement that she install an interlock device on her car for one year, and
the court also restricted her driving privileges for one year. Applicant served five days in
jail for her second conviction. (Tr. 30-33, 51-58, 62-65; GE 2, GE 3, GE 8; AE A)
Applicant was arrested for disorderly conduct in 2013, 2014, 2015, and in 2018.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.m, and 1.y) She admitted these offenses and acknowledged she had
been drinking alcohol during some of these incidents, but she could not recall how much
alcohol. The SOR alleged two other incidents of  disorderly conduct in 2015 and 2017,
which  Applicant  denied,  and  she  provided  documentation  that  she  was  actually  the
“victim” in one of the disorderly conduct incidents. There was no evidence to support the
other denied allegation.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.v) She admitted  that most of her disorderly
conduct  issues  stemmed  from  domestic  disputes  and  her  involvement  in  arguments
inside various bars. (Tr. 33-40, 43-47, 58- GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, GE 6, GE 7; AE A)
Applicant  was  cited  in  2014  for  being  a  passenger  in  a  motor  vehicle  with  an
open container. She was cited in 2015 for violation of a recreational fire pit regulation. In
July 2015, a warrant for her arrest was issued due to an unpaid fine. (SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.n,
and  1.o)  Applicant  admitted  these  offenses.  She  explained  that  she  frequently  had
bonfires in her backyard. The police requested she put out the fire because she did not
have a fire permit. She used a garden hose to put out the fire. She was later cited by
police  because  the  fire  re-started.  She  also  explained  that  she  forgot  to  pay  a  fine.
When she found out that a warrant had been issued, she immediately paid the fine. She
denied  that  she  had  been  issued  a  citation  for  speeding  in  December  2015,  and  the
Government  was  unable  to  provide  evidence  to  support  the  SOR  allegation.  (SOR  ¶
1.q.) (Tr. 40-43, 47-51; GE 5; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.bb alleges that between March 2011 to September 2015, Applicant was
charged  on  13  occasions  with  operating  a  motor  vehicle  without  proof  of  insurance,
and/or operating a motor vehicle after license or registration was suspended or revoked.
Applicant admitted these allegations. She could not remember all of the details, but she
admitted  during  that  time  period,  she  could  not  afford  car  insurance,  and  she  was
immature and irresponsible. (Tr. 65-69; GE 9; AE A)
Paragraph  2  of  the  SOR  (Guideline  G  - Alcohol  Consumption)  cross-alleged
Applicant’s  2012  and  2017  arrests  for  operating  a  motor  vehicle  while  under  the
influence of alcohol. There is no new information cited under this Guideline. During the
hearing, Applicant stated she has taken steps to improve her quality of life. She moved
to  a  different  part  of  town,  and  no  longer  associates  with  her  old  friends.  She  rarely
drinks  alcohol  anymore,  and  her  spouse  does  not  drink  at  all.  At  the  most,  she  may
drink one or two beers twice a month. She rarely goes out and she is very busy with her
daughters’  after  school  activities.  Most  importantly,  she  has  matured  and  considers
herself a responsible adult. She has not been in any trouble since starting her job in late
2018. (Tr. 77-80, 82-84)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged 12 delinquent accounts totaling $42,268, as
follows:
SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.j  allege  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education in the amount of $40,443 for ten unpaid student loans that had been referred
for  collection.  She  admitted  these  debts.  She  obtained  these  student  loans  to  pay  for
her  college  education.  After  graduation,  her  loans  were  placed  in  forbearance.  Once
she  was  employed  in  November 2018,  she  called  the  student  loan  creditor to  arrange
payments  to  be  deducted  directly  from  her  paycheck.  She  provided  documentation
which showed that beginning in June 2019, she had approximately $150 deducted from
each  paycheck  to  pay  her  student  loans.  In  March  2020,  the  payroll  deductions
automatically stopped due to the COVID-19 emergency relief for federal student loans.
The  student  loan  payment  pause  was  extended  through  December  31,  2022.  It  is
Applicant’s intention  to  resume  her student loan  payments beginning in January 2023.
She also stated that she has never had a tax refund intercepted due to non-payment of
student loans, and she always files her income tax returns on a timely basis. (Tr. 69-71,
75; AE D, AE E)
SOR ¶ 3.k alleges that Applicant is indebted to a cellular phone service account
that  was  referred  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  about  $1,600.  She  disputed  this  debt
because it was an account that belonged to her ex-boyfriend. She believed this account
was  successfully  disputed  because  this  account  is  no  longer  on  her  credit  report.  (Tr.
72; GE 10, GE 11)
SOR  ¶  3.l  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  childcare  facility  account  that
was referred for collection in the amount of about $225. She disputed this debt because
at the time she was receiving support from the county to pay for her childcare expenses.
(Tr. 72; GE 10, GE 11)
Applicant  explained  that  she  developed  financial  issues  due  to  unemployment,
underemployment,  and  a  lack  of  maturity.  She  is  now  current  on  all  of  her  financial
accounts  and  denied  that  she  had  developed  any  new delinquent  debts.  She  has  two
more  car  loan  payments  before  her  car  loan  is  paid  in  full.  She  provided  a  personal
financial  statement  which  reflected  a  monthly  net  income  (including  the  $200  child
support) of approximately $2,700. She  is the only source of  income for the family. Her
spouse  was  employed  by  a  temp  agency,  but  his  work  assignment  was  recently
completed.  He  is  currently  unemployed,  and  he  is  not  receiving  any  unemployment
benefits while looking for another job. She is able to support the family with her income.
After  paying  their  monthly expenses,  she  has  a  net  remainder  of  approximately $800.
She  has  never  participated  in  a  consumer  counseling  program,  but  she  does  receive
assistance from her mom when she has any financial questions. (Tr. 72-74, 76, 85; AE
B, AE C)
Paragraph  4  of  the  SOR  (Guideline  E  –  Personal  Conduct)  cross-alleged
Applicant’s arrests and citations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). There is no new
information cited under this Guideline.

Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 15; Tr. 6-7, 23-24.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
The  Government alleges in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for  clearance
because   he   has  engaged   in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about   a   person’s
this  allegation   with
judgment,   reliability,  and
explanations.
trustworthiness.  Applicant  denied
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  activities  that  show  questionable  judgment,  which  raises
questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or sensitive
information. Applicant denied this allegation with explanations.
The Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 allegations concern the same event:
On August 20, 2019, Applicant was involved in a road-rage incident with another
driver. Applicant and the other driver acted in provocative ways towards each other on
the highway. When they got off the highway, Applicant stopped at a stop light with the
other driver behind him. At this point, the other driver got out of his car and approached
Applicant. Applicant became concerned that the other driver would attack him or his car.
He then got out of his car holding a clasp knife for protection. He also stated that his intent
was to scare the other driver off. The other driver charged Applicant and they got into a
mutual fight during which Applicant was hit in the head at least once. During this fight, the
other  driver  was  cut  on  his  leg  by  Applicant’s  knife.  Applicant  stated  that  this  was  an
accident, and there is no evidence that it was intentional. After the other driver was cut, a
third  party  separated  them  until  police  arrived  and  took  statements  from  everyone
concerned. Applicant was fully cooperative with the police. He was arrested on a charge
of Assault with a Deadly Weapon. The district attorney elected not to move forward with
any charges against Applicant. (Government Exhibit 2 at pages 5-6; Government Exhibit
3; Tr. 13-15, 24-36, 39-41.)
Applicant  received  a head  injury during the fight  with  the  other driver. Applicant
Exhibit A is the medical report from his provider concerning this injury. (Tr. 38-39.)
Applicant informed his employer of the arrest as soon as possible after the arrest,
and of the disposition. He also informed his military supervisor of the incident the evening
it happened, which her testimony confirmed. (Government Exhibits 4 and 5; Tr. 45.)
Applicant stated he had never been involved in any other incident like this one. He
further stated his intention was not to hurt anyone but to protect himself and his car. He
regrets the incident, (Tr. 39-42.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline B,  Foreign Influence)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has foreign connections that may create a security concern. Applicant denied
this allegation with explanations.
Applicant is a native-born American citizen. From  1992 through 2011, Applicant
lived with his parents in Taiwan. He returned to the United States in 2011 to attend school
and has lived in the United States continually since then. Applicant’s mother lives in the
United States and is a recently naturalized American citizen. His sister is also a native-
born  American  citizen  who  also  lives  in  the  United  States.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Sections 11 and 17; Tr. 17-18.)
Applicant’s father is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. He and Applicant’s mother
are  divorced.  He  works  as  an  accountant  in  Taiwan.  Other  than  Taiwan’s  mandatory
military service when he was a young man, Applicant’s father has no connection to the
Taiwanese government. Applicant talks to his father every one or two weeks. His father
came to the United States after the incident in 2019 to support Applicant. Applicant last
visited Taiwan in 2016, before he joined the Navy. Applicant’s father knows very little of
what he does for a living. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 16-17, 36-37, 41.)
Taiwan
Applicant  has  contacts  with  Taiwan.  Accordingly,  it  is  appropriate  to  look  at  the
current situation concerning Taiwan. Taiwan is a multiparty democracy; whose authorities
generally respect the human rights of its citizens. Taiwan is an active collector of industrial
information and engages in industrial espionage, as shown by the administrative notice
documents in the record. However, the record does not demonstrate that the Taiwanese
government  seeks  to exert pressure  on  U.S.  citizens  to  collect  information from family
members  residing  in  country  or  abroad.  Finally,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the  U.S.
Government,  and  the  Defense  Department  in  particular,  have  a  close  and  continuing
relationship with Taiwan and its military, in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act of
1979, which has governed policy in the absence of diplomatic relations or a defense treaty
with Taiwan.
China
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  facts  set  forth  in  the  Administrative  Notice
documents  concerning  China,  which  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference.  China  is  a
large and economically powerful country, with a population of more than a billion people
and an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an authoritarian government,
dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. It has a poor record with respect to human
rights,  suppresses  political  dissent,  and  engages  in  arbitrary  arrests  and  detentions,
forced  confessions,  torture,  and  mistreatment  of  prisoners. China  is  one  of  the  most
aggressive countries in seeking sensitive and protected U.S. technology and economic
intelligence. It targets the United States with active intelligence gathering programs, both
legal and illegal. As a result, it is a growing threat to U.S. national security.  In addition,
China  views  Taiwan  as  part  of  China.  China  has  engaged  in  many  different  coercive
diplomatic and military activities, seeking to isolate and intimidate Taiwan into unification
on China’s terms.
Mitigation
Applicant’s military supervisor, a senior chief petty officer (E-8), testified. She has
known  Applicant for six or seven  years. She  testified  that he  is a  “good  guy,” and also
stated that he is “a man of integrity.” (Tr. 43-49.)
",True
"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR  and  its  amendments,  he  admitted  all  the
allegations except SOR ¶¶ 2.g and 3.a, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated
in my findings of fact.
Background
Applicant is a 36-year-old ship designer employed by a defense contractor since
January 2017. He was unemployed from September 2014 to January 2017. He received
an interim security clearance in 2019. (Tr. 17.)
Applicant  married  in  September  2010,  divorced  in  November  2015,  married  in
November 2016, and separated in August 2017. He has two children, ages 11 and 15.
Applicant attended  a  community  college  from August 2012  to  March  2014  and  a
university   from   August   2014   to   May   2016.  He  earned   a   bachelor’s  degree   in   graphic
design in May 2016.
Financial Considerations
The  amended  SOR  alleges  12  delinquent  debts  and  a  wage  garnishment.  The
debts  are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  April  2020,  November  2020,  and  September
2022 (GX 2, 3, and 4), and court records reflecting judgments (GX 5, 6, and 7). Applicant
admitted all the debts in his answer to the amended SOR, stated that the debts alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.i had been paid, and stated that he was working on resolving the three
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l.
The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  medical  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $1,861.  This  debt  became
delinquent in May 2017. The November 2020 credit report reflects that it is disputed. (GX
3 at 1.) Applicant submitted no evidence of the basis for the dispute or its resolution. In
his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  claimed  that  the  debt  was  paid  in  full.  He  submitted  no
documentary evidence supporting his claim.
SOR ¶ 1.b: telecommunications debt placed for collection of $63. This debt
became delinquent in September 2019. (GX 3 at 2.) Applicant paid it on April 16, 2021.
(AX A.)
SOR  ¶   1.c:   debt   to   insurance   company   placed  for  collection   of   $126.  The
November  2020   credit  report  reflects  this  debt.   (G  3   at  2.)  It   is  not  reflected   in   the
September 2020  credit  report (GX  4.) In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR, he  claimed  that
this debt was paid  in full, but he  did not submit any  documentation  to  support  his claim.
The   fact   that   a   debt   no   longer  appears  on   a   credit  report   does  not  establish   any
meaningful, independent evidence  as to  the  disposition  of  the  debt.  ISCR  Case  No.  18-
01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2019).
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h: two medical debts placed for collection of $75,
one debt for $135, and one for $1,691. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he claimed
that these debts were paid in full. He submitted no documentary evidence to support his
claim. At the hearing, he testified that he had limited medical insurance while in college,
and his insurance either did not cover the medical expenses or did not pay the full cost of
the medical care. He had at least one serious medical issue with a hernia. (Tr. 19.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: automobile loan past due for $628. The November 2020 credit report
reflects this debt. (GX 3 at 3.) In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he claimed that this debt
was paid in full. The September 2022 credit report reflects a “paid repossession” and a
zero balance due. (GX 4 at 6.) This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i: telecommunications debt placed for collection of $274. The alleged
creditor for this debt  is the  same as  the  $63  debt  in  SOR ¶  1.b. The  April 2020  credit
report reflects two debts to this creditor, one of which was disputed and resolved in favor
of the debtor, but the credit report does not list the amounts. The SOR does not reflect
the  account  numbers  of  the  two  debts  to  this  creditor.  Even  though  the  amounts  are
different, the one debt that was not disputed appears to be the same debt as SOR ¶ 1.b,
which has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.j: default judgment for $924 filed on February 29, 2016. (GX 5.) At the
hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  unaware  of  this  judgment.  He  learned  about  it
when he was searching for court records regarding the judgments alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.k
and  1.l.  He  denied  this  debt  and  testified  that  he  had  never  obtained  a  loan  from  this
creditor.  (Tr.  21.)  He  suspects  identity  theft.  (Tr.  39.)  He  provided  no  documentary
evidence of actions to dispute or otherwise resolve this debt.
SOR  ¶¶  1.k  and  1.l:  judgments  for  $113  and  $211  filed  in  2017.  (GX  6.)
Applicant testified that these judgments were for unpaid personal property taxes. He had
recently moved and did not receive the notices of taxes due, and did not know about the
judgments for unpaid taxes. (Tr. 39.) He submitted no evidence that the judgments have
been satisfied.
SOR  ¶  1.m:  wage  garnishment  in  2020  for  $1,483.  Applicant  testified  that  he
believed this garnishment was for unpaid personal property taxes. (Tr. 39.) However, the
evidence reflects that a  default judgment for unpaid rent was filed against Applicant in
September  2019  for  $1,101,  plus  costs  and  attorney  fees,  and  Applicant’s  pay  was
garnished to collect the judgment. (GX 7.)
Applicant testified that his delinquent debts were due to “growing pains, growing
up,” and not knowing how to manage his money. (Tr. 18-19.) He submitted no evidence
of financial counseling.
Criminal Conduct and Alcohol Consumption
In September 2014, Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI).
He was convicted and sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended for 60 days), fined $300,
and charged with court costs of $340. His driver’s license was restricted for 12 months.
(GX 12.) He testified that he was required to attend an alcohol safety class and had to
install a breathalyzer in his car for six months. (Tr. 26.) He testified that he now consumes
alcohol rarely, and he limits his consumption to drinking wine on special occasions like
Christmas or Thanksgiving. (Tr. 26-27.)
On  January 12,  2016, Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  without  a  license.  He
testified that his license was suspended because of an unpaid fine. (Tr. 23.) He has since
paid the fine. He pleaded guilty to driving without a valid license and was fined $600 plus
court costs. (GX 10.)
On  January  12,  2016,  Applicant  was  charged  with  failure  to  appear  in  court  on
December  16,  2015.  He  testified  that  he  was  challenging  a  speeding  ticket  and  was
scheduled for a court hearing, but that he mixed up the dates and forgot the correct court
date. (Tr. 24.) He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended for 60
days, and placed on unsupervised probation for three years. (GX 8; GX 11.)
In October 2020, Applicant was charged with violation of a protective order. The
record contains no evidence of the basis for the order or the charge of violating it, except
for  Applicant’s  testimony.  He  testified  that  a  neighbor  threatened  his  wife  and  then
obtained a protective order against him. The neighbors did not appear at the hearing. (Tr.
22-23.) In February 2021, the charge was dismissed. (GX 9.)
In November 2021, Applicant was charged with felony child cruelty and felony child
neglect after he spanked his son. His son was not seriously injured, but he had marks on
his buttocks. Disposition was deferred for the child cruelty, and Applicant was placed on
probation for two years. He was required to attend a parenting class, and he voluntarily
enrolled in an anger management class. (Tr. 34.) The child neglect charge was reduced
to assault and battery on a family member, a misdemeanor, and he was sentenced to 12
months in jail, suspended for 12 months. (GX 13.) Applicant still has joint custody of his
son and is entitled to supervised visitation. (Tr. 35.)
In   May   2022,  Applicant  was  charged   with   DWI,  2nd   offense,  and   refusing   a
breathalyzer test  within 10  years  after  a  DWI  conviction.  (GX  14.) Applicant  testified  that
while  he  was driving,  his wife  wanted  to  stop  at a  restaurant on  the  left side  of the  road.
He moved  to  the  left-turn lane. His wife  changed  her mind,  and  he  abruptly  moved  back
into  the  travel lane.  A  police  officer  observed  the  maneuver and  stopped  him.  Applicant
denied  having  consumed  any  alcohol before driving. (Tr. 29.) He testified  that he  refused
to  take  a  breathalyzer test because  his research reflected  that such  tests are  unreliable.
He asked  the  police  officer to  take  him  to  a  hospital for a  blood-alcohol test,  but the  officer
refused.  (Tr.  15.)  He   testified   that  he   believed   he   has   a   “constitutional  right  to   have   a
blood-alcohol  test.” (Tr.  32.) Applicant  notified  his probation  officer about this incident.  (Tr.
32.) His trial on  the  DWI  and  breathalyzer refusal was pending  and  not imminent when
the record  of his security clearance hearing  closed.
Without  objection  from  either  party,  I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the
“implied  consent”  law  applicable  to  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the  breathalyzer  refusal
occurred. (State Code §18.2-268.3). This law provides that a first breathalyzer refusal is
a civil offense, but a second or subsequent refusal is a misdemeanor if it occurs within
ten years after a conviction of certain offenses, including DWI.
Character Evidence
A coworker and former college classmate who has worked with Applicant for about
six  years  considers  him  an  extremely  dependable  and  dedicated  employee  who  goes
beyond what is expected. (AX B.) A friend who has been Applicant’s barber for more than
20 years describes him as loyal, dependable, a good man, and a proud father. (AX C.)

"In  her  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  admitted  the  factual  allegations  in
Paragraphs  1.a.,  1.c.,  and  2.b.~2.d.  of  the  SOR,  with  explanations.  She  denied  the
factual  allegations  in  Paragraphs  1.b.  and  3.b.  Applicant failed  to either admit  or deny
Paragraphs  2.a.  and  3.a.  She  also  provided  additional  information  to  support  her
request for eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant  is  35  years  old,  unmarried,  and  has  a  14-year-old  child.  (Item  3  at
pages 7, and 26~27.)
Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption, Guideline J: Criminal Conduct & Guideline E:
Personal Conduct
1.a.,   2.a.,   and   3.a.  In  October  of  2016,  Applicant  admits  that  she  was  charged
with,  and  subsequently  convicted  of,  Driving  While  Intoxicated  (DWI).  She  was
incarcerated  for  ten  days,  placed  on  probation  for  two  years,  and  her  license  was
restricted for 12 months. Her restriction, in part, required the use of an Ignition Interlock
System,  of  which  Applicant  claims  she  was  unaware.  This  restriction  is  evidenced  by
court records. (Item 4 at page 2.)
1.b.,   2.a.,   and   3.a.  About   11   months  later,   in   September  2017,  Applicant  was
charged   with   and   convicted   of:  Refusal  of  Breath   Test  –  2nd  Offense,  Operating   a
Vehicle   on   a   Suspended   or  Revoked   License,  and   Operating   a   Vehicle   Without  an
Ignition   Interlock   System.   (Item   4   at   pages  7~16.)   She   was  incarcerated   for  ten   days,
and placed on probation  for three years.
1.c., 2.a.,  and  3.a. About six months later, in March 2018, Applicant admits that
she  was  charged  with  and  convicted  of  Operating  a  Vehicle  on  a  Suspended  or
Revoked License. (Item 4 at pages 17~20.)

convicted  of  Good  Behavior/Show  Cause  (Operating  a  Vehicle  Without  an  Ignition
Interlock System). She was incarcerated for ten days,  and placed on probation for two
years.
2.d.  Less  than  two  years  later,  in  March  of  2020,  Applicant  admits  she  was
charged  and  convicted  of  Misdemeanor  Driving  Under  Revocation  or  Suspension.
Applicant was placed on probation until May of 2022.

"After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in February 2017
for theft of mail, found guilty of that offense, and that his sentence included restitution and
five years’ probation (SOR ¶ 1.a). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that he resigned
in lieu of being fired as a mail carrier after it was discovered that he opened U.S. mail and
stole gift cards (SOR ¶  2.a), that he received a written warning from a federal contractor
for  using  a  company  prepaid  mailing  label  to  mail  personal  mail  (SOR  ¶  2.b),  that  his
employment with that federal contractor was terminated for not being forthcoming about
his criminal history (SOR ¶ 2.d), and that he falsified material facts regarding his criminal
history on his March 2017 e-QIP (SOR ¶ 2.c). He admitted the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 1.a.,
2.a., 2.b., and 2.d, without explanation. He denied the allegation at SOR ¶ 2.c, stating that
his  failure  to  disclose  that  he  had  been  arrested  and  was  pending  trial  was  due  to  an
unintentional oversight. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant is 42 years old. He graduated from high school in 1999 and earned an
associate’s degree in 2000. He served on active duty in the Army from 1999 to 2014 and
was  honorably  discharged.  He  has  been  married  since  2005  and  has  one  child.  He
worked for a federal contractor from October 2016 to May 2018. (Items 2, 3)
From September 2014 to September 2016  Applicant was employed by the U.S.
Postal Service  (USPS)  as  a  mail  carrier.  From  about  April  2016  to  August  9,  2016  he
opened  mail  entrusted  to  him  for  delivery  and  stole  items  he  found  inside.  On  about
August 9, 2016, USPS agents approached his mail carrier vehicle, observed that he had
opened an envelope containing cash, and informed him that they had surveillance video
of  him  opening  mail  and  removing  items.  He  then  admitted  that  he  had  been  stealing
pieces of mail from his assigned carrier routes since about April 2016. He estimated that
he had opened approximately 100 pieces of mail per week  and removed gift cards  he
found therein. He said that he had no reason for taking the gift cards other than he had
made poor decisions and exercised bad judgement. He resigned from the USPS in lieu
of being fired in September 2016. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5).
In   October  2016,  Applicant  was  hired   by   a   federal  contractor.  In   approximately
January   2017,  he  received   a   written   warning   for   improperly   using   a   mailing   label
purchased   by   his  employer  for  personal  mail.  He  said   that  he   intended   to   pay   for  the
personal mail, and  thought he  had  erased  the  company  account number from  the  pre-
paid USPS  label before  he  printed  it out so  that the  company  would not be  charged  for
shipping. He said that he was unaware the company had been charged for the shipment
until his supervisor showed him the receipt because his spouse had mailed the package.
He told his supervisor that he would pay, and the $53 shipping cost was deducted from
his pay. He also said that he had no other employment difficulties with that employer, and
that there was no likelihood of recurrence. (Items 3, 4)
On February 3, 2017, Applicant voluntarily surrendered to federal authorities and
was  arrested.  He was  arraigned by a  Magistrate  Judge  on one count of  “Theft of  Mail
Matter by [USPS] Officer or Employee,” a felony under 18 U.S.C. §1709. The Magistrate
Judge also scheduled trial on the Theft of Mail charge for April 3, 2017. (Items 4, 5)
On March 2, 2017, Applicant completed an e-QIP. In Section 22 of the e-QIP titled
“Police  Record,” he denied that he had been charged with any crime in the past seven
years,  and  denied  that  he  was  then  awaiting  trial  on  criminal  charges.  In  response  to
questions about “Employment Activities,” he disclosed that he resigned from the USPS in
September 2016, but denied that he quit after being told he would be fired and denied
that he left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct. He also
denied that he had received a written warning from his then federal contractor employer.
(Item 3)
On April 17, 2017, Applicant pled guilty to Theft of Mail by a USPS employee. On
August 14, 2017, he was sentenced to five years’  probation, ordered to pay restitution
totaling $75, and fined $2,000. (Items 4, 5)
During  an  August  21,  2017  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  Applicant
discussed his March 2017 e-QIP. He said that his failure to disclose  that he had been
charged with a crime was due to an oversight. He also attributed his failure to disclose
that  he  had  resigned  from  the  USPS  by  mutual  agreement  following  charges  or
allegations  of  misconduct  to  an  oversight.  He  noted  that  he  had  no  other  employment
difficulties with the USPS, that there was no likelihood of recurrence, and that his federal
contractor employer was aware of the USPS incident. He reported that the only difficulty
he  had  experienced  with  his  federal  contractor  employer  was  the  written  warning  for
improperly  using  a  company  purchased  mailing  label  for  personal mail,  and  that  there
was no likelihood of recurrence of that behavior. (Item 4)
An incident report dated February 13, 2018 and prepared by security personnel for
his federal contractor employer notes that  Applicant: “was found  guilty  of two  separate
charges  in  two  separate  incidents  .  .  .  is  not  forthcoming  regarding  his  convictions  for
criminal activity [and] has not reported any of  this data.” The incident report  references
two  criminal convictions  and  sentences.  First,  the  conviction and  sentence for Theft of
Mail Matter by a USPS employee (SOR ¶ 1.a). Second, “Charge – Make Utter Issue 150
[Dollars] or over Plea Agreement Filed. Sentence imposed – [February 13, 2018] 2 years’
probation.” He subsequently admitted that in May 2018, his federal contractor employer
terminated  his  employment  because  he  “was  not  .  .  .  forthcoming  regarding  [his]
convictions for criminal activity” (SOR ¶ 2.a). (Items 2, 6)
On  February  12,  2020  a  federal  Judge  granted  Applicant’s  Motion  for  Early
Termination  of  Probation,  and  discharged  him  from  supervised  release  for  the  federal
Theft of Mail offense. (Item 5)
Applicant’s response to the SOR included a brief explanation regarding his failure
to  disclose  any  criminal  history  in  his  March  2017  e-QIP.  He  acknowledged  that  his
responses were inaccurate and noted that if he had gone back and reviewed his answers,
he would have corrected his responses. Applicant did not submit any other documents or
evidence with his answer, and did not submit a response to the FORM. (Item 2)

The SOR alleged Applicant was charged with driving  while intoxicated (DWI) on
three occasions: February 2018, February 2014, and December 2004. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c)
Her  DWI arrests  were  also alleged as  criminal conduct  under Guideline  J in the SOR.
(SOR ¶ 2.a)
Applicant completed her 2018 security clearance in January 2018. Her February
2018  DWI  charge  occurred  after  she  spent  the  evening  at  a  girlfriend’s  house  and
consumed  “quite  a  few”  glasses  of  wine.  Several  circumstances  were  going  on  in  her
life at the time that caused her emotional strain. He mother had recently passed away
and she and her then-boyfriend (current husband) were caring for his dementia-stricken
mother. She testified that she “just got drunk” that evening. She decided to drive home
from  the  friend’s  house  and  she  was  stopped  by  law  enforcement.  Court  records
indicate that her blood alcohol content (BAC) was .15, almost twice the legal limit of .08.
She  was arrested  and  spent the  night in jail. She  ultimately  pleaded  guilty  and  received
a   sentence   that  included   probation,  installation   of   an   interlock  device  on   her  car,  and
required  attendance  at  an  alcohol counseling  course.  The  course  required  three-times-
a-week  attendance,  but  she   could   not  recall   the   duration   of  it.   She   also  attended
Alcoholics Anonymous  (AA) during  this time. The  record is unclear if  her AA  attendance
was  mandated   by   the   court.  She   was  given   the   opportunity   post-hearing   to   provide
documentation   about  her  counseling,  which  she   claimed   to   have,  but  she   failed   to   do
so.  (Tr. 27-28, 30-36; GE 3, 5)
Applicant’s February 2014 DWI charge occurred after she spent the evening at a
friend’s house and claimed she drank two beers before driving home. She was stopped
by  law  enforcement  for  having  a  non-operable  license-plate  light.  She  performed  field
sobriety  tests  but  refused  breath  and  blood  testing.  She  was  charged  with  DWI.  The
final disposition was a reduction of the charge to obstruction of a highway. Her sentence
included 14 months of community service and a fine. (Tr. 43-45; GE 3-4)
Applicant’s July 2004  DWI  charge  occurred  when  she  decided  to  drive  from  her
home  to  get  some  food  after  she  had  been  drinking  alcohol.  It  was  raining  during  her
drive and she lost control of her car when rounding a corner. She was alone in the car.
Applicant does not recall the details of what happened next after the accident. She was
hospitalized and treated. Later, she became aware that she was charged with DWI. The
charge  was  ultimately dismissed,  but  the  record  does  not  explain  why.  In  her  security
clearance  applications,  she  indicated  she  sought  alcohol  treatment  or  counseling  for
one month in 2004. She provided no further details about this counseling. (GE 1-4)
Applicant  testified  that  she  continues  to  drink  alcohol  to  include  drinking  to
intoxication  four  to  six  times  a  month.  She  claimed  she  last  drank  to  intoxication  in
December 2021. She also claimed that she no longer drives after drinking alcohol and
she  has  not  done  so  since  her 2018  arrest.  She  believes  that  she  is an  alcoholic,  but
she also believes  she does not  have  a  current  alcohol problem.  She  last  attended AA
over  a  year  ago.  She  has  not  attended  any  other  alcohol  treatment  or  counseling
program  since  her  court-ordered  counseling  after  her  2018  arrest.  She  realizes  she
made mistakes and she is sorry for them. (Tr. 37-41, 47)

about  $53,000   (SOR  ¶¶   1.a   and   1.b).   In   his  response   to   the   SOR,  Applicant   admitted

Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  most  recent  divorce  and  the
financial  burden  of  his  child  and  spousal  support  payments.  He  claimed  that  he  is
paying about $2,400 per month for child support, spousal support, and to repay benefits
received  from  the  state.  He  pays  about  $160  per  month  for  half  of  a  $2,500  personal
loan  that  he  and  his  ex-wife  obtained  prior  to  their  divorce.  He  also  attributed  his
financial  problems  to  his  and  his  latest  ex-wife’s  poor  financial  planning  and  poor
spending  habits.  Additionally,  he  claimed  that  damages  to  his  home  from  a  fire  that
were  not  covered  by  his homeowner’s  insurance  caused  him  financial  problems,  most
specifically with the debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, so
more recent information about his finances is not available. (Items 1, 3, 4-6, 11)
In April 2018, Applicant was arrested at his home after a physical altercation with
his 14-year-old stepson. The two  argued about his  stepson completing his chores and
the argument turned physical. Applicant claimed that he hit his stepson in the shoulder
and  then  wrestled  him  to  the  ground  to  subdue  him.  Applicant’s  stepson  claimed  that
during the physical altercation, he was unable to breathe, but Applicant denied that he
choked  him.  Applicant’s  spouse  called  the  police.  The  police  arrested  Applicant,  and
charged  him  with  felony  risk  of  injury  to  a  child,  misdemeanor  strangulation  or
suffocation  in  the  third  degree,  and  misdemeanor  breach  of  peace  in  the  second
degree.  He  pleaded  not  guilty  and  was  released,  but  was  ordered  to  have  no  contact
with  his  spouse  and  stepson.  As  a  result  of  this  incident,  he  attended  mental  health
counseling  from  April  2018  until  August  2018.  The  record  is  equivocal  on  whether  he
voluntarily  attended  counseling  or  it  was  court  ordered.  He  also  voluntarily  took  anger
management therapy from June 2018 until September 2018. He claimed that as a result
of attending this counseling, the aforementioned charges against him were dropped. He
also  claimed that he pleaded  nolo contendre,  which  is not consistent  with  the  charges
being  dismissed.  There  is  no  independent  documentary  evidence  in  the  record  that

that his counseling has  helped him  overcome  the  issues  that led to  the  assault on his

Applicant was stationed  in Germany  from  2010  to  2012. In  about the  summer of
2011, he  had  sexual intercourse on  two  occasions with  a  dependent daughter (AB) of  a
U.S.  service  member.   AB   was  15   or  had   just   turned   16   at  the   time.  Applicant  told
investigators that she  was 15  years old, but  she  told  him  that she  was 19  years old.  He
stated  that  they  remained  friends  after he  found  out  how  old she  was, but they  did not
engage  in any  additional sexual activity. AB  later told military  investigators that she  was
16 years old at the  time of  the sexual encounters.1 (Tr. at 44-46, 51; GE 3)
Applicant had sexual relations in about 2012 with a female who was about 18 or
older. She introduced him on Facebook to her friend (XY) who was 15 years old at the
time. She turned 16 in early August 2013. Applicant stated that because the first woman
was of age, he assumed XY was about the same age. XY lived in the Republic of Korea
(Korea)  as  the  dependent  daughter  of  a  civilian  employee  of  the  U.S.  military.  From
about January 2013 to March 2013, Applicant and XY exchanged naked photographs of
each  other.  She  also  sent  him  a  video  of  her  masturbating.  (Tr.  at  15-17,  31-34;
Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  3) The photographs of XY and the video constituted
child  pornography  under  18  U.S.C.  §§  2252  and  2256.  Under  the  statutes,  a  child  or
“minor” means any person under the age of 18 years.
Applicant  transferred  to  Korea  in  March  2013.  He  met  XY  and  her  friend  at  a
concert in June 2013. He stated that entrants to the concert had to be 19 years old. XY
said she was 18. Her friend said that XY was not 18, and XY quickly said she was 17.
Applicant and XY met the following weekend in late June 2013, and ended up in a hotel,
where  they  performed  oral  sex  on  each  other  and  had  sexual  intercourse.  Applicant
took a picture of her performing oral sex on him. By doing so, Applicant produced child
pornography  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.  §§  2251  and  2252  and  the  Uniform  Code  of
Military Justice (UCMJ). (Tr. at 13-17, 33-35;  Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE  3)  The
fact  that  he  might  have  thought  that  she  was  17  is not a  defense because  the  statute
covers minors 17 years of age and younger.
1  This conduct was not alleged in the SOR. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used
for disqualification purposes. It may be considered in assessing Applicant’s credibility, in judging whether
he  has  an  affirmative  defense,  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and  in  the  whole-person
analysis.
Applicant  and  XY  engaged  in  a  series  of  graphic  sexual  messages  in  July  and
early  August,  before  XY  turned  16.  At  one  point  he  wrote:  “I  wanted  you!!  You  were
sexy.  I  don’t  care  how  old  you  are,”  and  “You  are  a  complete  exception.  Even  if  you
were 13, I’d seriously have to consider still doing you.” You’re just to[o] sexy!” (Tr. at 18,
37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant met XY in a club in late July or August 2013, when XY was 15 or had
recently turned 16. XY performed oral sex on him behind a pillar on the dance floor, and
they  had  sexual  intercourse  in  the  ladies’  room.  Applicant  told  investigators  that  it
occurred  in  July  2013,  and  that  he  still  thought  she  was  17  at  the  time.  He  told
investigators that he found out XY’s age when her friend told him in late August or early
September that XY “was turning 16.” XY later told investigators that the incident at the
club happened in August 2013 after she turned 16. He testified that he knew XY was 16
years  old  during  the  incident  at  the  club.  (Tr.  at  37-40,  49-52;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 3)
The  only  evidence  that the  sexual activity  at the  club  occurred  when  XY  was 15
is  Applicant’s  statement  to   investigators  that   it  was  “late   July,  I  believe.”  (GE  3)  I  am
unable  to   find   by   substantial   evidence   that   XY   was  15   during   the   second   incident.
However,  Applicant  knew   XY   was  turning   16.  If  the   sex   occurred   after  XY   turned   16,
then  Applicant  had  to  know  she  was 16  years old  at  the  time,  and  his statement  to  the
investigators that he  did not know her age and still thought she was 17 was false.
Applicant had a married female first cousin who lived in the United States.  They
engaged  in  a series  of  graphic sexual messages  from about  June 2013  to September
2013. They discussed sending naked pictures to each other. Applicant sent his cousin
the  picture  of  XY  performing  oral  sex  on  him.  When  he  did  so,  he  transmitted  child
pornography into the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252 and 2260. (Tr. at
17-19, 40; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant stated that he was unaware of his cousin’s existence until around 2010,
when he was almost 20 years old and she was almost 28 years old. He stated that “the
confusions of adolescence” contributed to his conduct with his cousin. Applicant was 22
years old when he sent his cousin the picture of  XY. He has not had any contact with
his  cousin  since  he  came  under  investigation  by  the  military.  (Tr.  at  18-19,  40-42;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3)
A  military criminal  investigation  was  initiated  in  September  2013  after  a  service
member  reported  that  Applicant  had  a  sexual  relationship  with  XY  when  she  was  15
years old. The investigators reviewed Applicant’s text messages. XY never revealed her
true age in the messages. On different occasions, she said she was 18, 17, and 16. (GE
3)
In  a  September  2013  message  to  his  cousin,  Applicant  stated  that  since  he
turned 18, he had sexual intercourse with two 15-year-olds and was masturbated by a
13-year-old.  In the  same message,  he  self-identified himself  as a pedophile.  Applicant
testified  that  he  did  not  know  why  he  wrote  those  messages.  He  stated  that  it  could
have been a typo or he added it in for shock value. He thinks that he was “plain lying to
[his cousin].” He relayed in messages to AB and XY that he could only get in trouble if
either of them told military investigators that he knew they were 15 years old when he
had sexual intercourse with them. (Tr. at 36; GE 3)
On  Applicant’s  iPad  or laptop  computer, the  investigators found  a  picture  of  XY
performing oral sex on him, a picture of XY performing a sex act on herself, and a video
of her performing the same sex act. Applicant was in possession of child pornography in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252. He told investigators that it did not click in his mind that
he had child pornography, and if he had remembered, he would have deleted the files.
(GE 3)
Applicant  was  issued  a  military  protective  order  (MPO),  also  known  as  a  no
contact  order,  directing  him  to  have  no  contact  with  XY.  He  violated  that  order  on
several  occasions.  He  stated  in  his  SOR  response  that  he  communicated  with  XY  via
messenger app, when he asked her what was going on with the case. He testified that
he  did not intend  to  violate  the  order, and  he  “messaged  her just  to  tell  her that [they]
had a No Contact Order.” In other words, he contacted her to tell her that they could not
contact each other. (Tr. at 20-21, 47-49; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant was charged with multiple offenses under the UCMJ, including violating
the  MPO;  committing  sexual  acts  and  lewd  acts  on  a  child  under  the  age  of  16;
producing,  distributing,  and  possessing  child  pornography  involving  XY;  indecent
language to XY, a child under the age of 16; indecent exposure to XY in the nightclub;
and indecent language to his cousin. (Tr. at 13-14; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant was arraigned on the charges before a general court-martial. He stated
that  XY  refused  to  testify  against  him  and  they  are  still  friends.  The  charges  were
dismissed  in  January  2015  when  Applicant  accepted  an  under  other  than  honorable
conditions  discharge  in  lieu  of  trial  by  court-martial.  The  General  Court-Martial  Order
(GCMO)  promulgating  those  actions  was  issued  in  April  2015.  The  SOR  incorrectly
alleged that Applicant was charged on the date of the GCMO. (Tr. at 13-16, 20, 43, 44;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3; AE B)
Applicant  asserted  that  he  did  not  know  XY’s  true  age,  and  he  would  not  have
committed the sexual acts with her if he knew that she was under 16. He stated that the
age of consent in the military is 16, it was 13 at the time in Korea, and he thought she
was 17 or 18. He stated that he shared the sexually explicit picture of XY with his cousin
before  he  learned  she  was  15.  However,  federal  child  pornography  statutes  cover
children 17 years and younger, and Applicant admitted that he thought that she was 17.
(Tr. at 13-15, 50-52; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant stated that alcohol contributed to some of the allegations. He stopped
drinking while  he  was  awaiting the  resolution of  the military charges.  He  asserted  that
he has learned from the experience, he has matured, and there has been no additional
misconduct since the military. (Tr. at 26-29, 42-43; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant  was  evaluated  at  his  own  expense  by  a  licensed  psychologist  in
September 2022. Applicant described his military charges as follows:
I  submitted   a   Chapter   4   during   the   hearing   which  is  a   request  to   get  a
discharge  rather than  a  court martial.  The  case  had  been  going  on  for 20
months. I had  to  switch  lawyers. I had  like  20  minor charges against  me.
Most  were  dropped   or   recommended   to   be   dropped.  I  had   won   the   first
case  because  she  wouldn’t testify  and  it was  proven  that I didn’t know  she
was a  minor, but after I won  that case, they  piled  a  bunch  of other charges
on  me  so  my  lawyers advised  me  to  just  get out because  they  felt the  JAG
would keep  coming  after me  until they  won. My  lawyer said get out  before
I become a sex offender or something like that.
Applicant  never  told  the  psychologist  that  he  had  sex  with  a  15-year-old  girl
under similar circumstances about a year before XY. The psychologist determined that
Applicant did not have a mental health condition. He concluded:
I  did  not  find   [Applicant]   to   suffer  from   any   of   the   sexual  dysfunctions  or
paraphilic disorders described  in  the  DSM-5-TR  [Diagnostic and  Statistical
Manual   of  Mental   Disorders,  Fifth   Edition].   Likewise,  I  did   not  find   any   of
the  indicators in  [Applicant]  that are seen  in  people at high  risk for  sexual
offending.  I  do   not  believe,  based   on   his   personality   disposition   and
behavioral history,  that  [Applicant]   would  have   engaged   in  sexual activity
with   the   young   lady   in  2013   had   he   known  she   was  underage.  He  is not
considered   to   be   at  heightened   risk  for  criminal   sexual  behavior  in  the
future.  (AE G)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance and strong moral character. He is praised for his reliability, dependability,
trustworthiness,  loyalty  to  the  United  States,  honesty,  work  ethic,  intelligence,  and
responsibility. His girlfriend wrote, “Within the first month of our relationship, [Applicant]
had an honest conversation with me and told me about the unfortunate situation he had
in Korea. I knew from the start just from his persona that he was wronged.” (AE C)

alleged under Guideline E.
Applicant  admitted  the  December  2019  arrest,  in  which  he  was  charged  with
Extreme  DUI  and  had  a  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  above  .20%.  (SOR  ¶1.a)  He
admitted a June 2015 DUI charge with a BAC between .12 and .15%. (SOR ¶ 1.b) He
stated both of these incidents occurred after he had been golfing with friends and drinking
alcohol. He generally consumes between eight and twelve beers during each golf outing.
He pleaded guilty to the 2015 DUI, and he was ordered by the court to complete three
months  of  counseling,  fined  approximately  $2,000,  and  required  to  install  an  interlock
device  on  his vehicle  for  one  year. He  also pleaded  guilty  to  the December 2019  DUI
charge, and the court sentenced him to serve two days in jail, 22 days of work release,
and 96 hours of home detention. He completed alcohol screening, attended DUI classes,
and he paid a fine of approximately $3,700. (SOR Answer, GE 3, GE 4)
Applicant admitted the following alcohol-related offenses as follows:

During  a  background  interview  in  July  2019,  Applicant  discussed  in  detail  his
alcohol-related charges with an authorized government investigator. He  also described
his general pattern of drinking as consuming four to eight beers at home on the weekends.
When questioned about the likelihood that he would consume alcohol to the point where
he once again faced  adverse  consequences,  Applicant’s  reply  was  that it  would never
happen. He stated that he made a conscious decision to not consume alcohol to excess
in the future. In the event he was out drinking socially, he would use the services of an
ride-share service to prevent another DUI. Five months after this interview, Applicant was
arrested in December 2019 for DUI with a blood alcohol content above .20%. (GE 4)
Applicant admitted that he had consumed alcohol, at times to excess, from about
December 1990 to at least December 2019. In April 2021, he was diagnosed by a treating
physician as having an alcohol use disorder. (SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h)

he  was  traveling  for  work.  He  claimed  that  he  had  taken  NyQuil  because  he  wasn’t
feeling well. He claimed that his co-workers had gone to a bar and needed to be picked
up, so he drove from the hotel  to a bar to pick them up. He claimed that he could not
find his friends at the bar, so he drove back to the hotel where he was staying. As he
pulled  into  the  hotel,  he  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  told  him  he  had  been
swerving  while  driving.  He  claimed  that  he  explained  to  the  police  officer  that  he  had
taken  cold  medicine  and  had  not  been  drinking,  but  the  police  officer  arrested  him  on
suspicion  of  OVWI  because  he  had  been  swerving  and  because  the  police  officer
smelled  alcohol  on  his  breath.  At  the  police  station,  Applicant  was  administered  a
breathalyzer that indicated (at least) the presence of alcohol. Based upon the totality of
the evidence, including an analysis of Applicant’s credibility, Applicant was driving while
impaired by alcohol. (Tr. 24-32, 34-39; Answer; GE 3, 5)
Applicant failed to appear in court for his hearing regarding his 2014 OVWI. He
claimed that, prior to his hearing date, he contacted the court to let them know that he
would be out of the country for work on his hearing date, and that he provided the court
the information they requested to justify his absence. Regardless, in February 2015, the
court  found  that  he  failed  to  appear  and  issued  a  warrant  for  his  arrest.  Applicant
claimed that when he got back from being out of the country for work, he contacted the
court and the court told him that he did not need to take any further action regarding his
2014 OVWI arrest or his failure to appear. He claimed that he has e-mails to this effect
but he did not present them as evidence. (Tr. 20, 46-47; Answer; GE 3, 5)
In 2017, Applicant  learned from two different sources that he still had a warrant
out  for  his  arrest  for  failure  to  appear  on  his  2014  OVWI.  One  source  was  the
government contractor that conducted his November 2017 security interview. The other
source  was  a  security  police  officer  at  a  military  base  who  pulled  Applicant  over  for
expired  tags.  During  his  November  2017  security  interview,  he  told  the  government
contractor that he would resolve the outstanding warrant. He claimed that he contacted
the  court  via  telephone,  paid  a  fine,  and  believed  that  he  had  resolved  the  failure  to
appear.  He  provided  no  documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  any  resolution  of  his
failure to appear in 2017. He also claimed in his testimony and Answer that he did not
find  out  about  his  failure  to  appear  until  2020  or  2021.  When  asked  about  the
discrepancies  in  his  Answer  and  testimony,  he  was  evasive.  After  several  chances  to
explain  these  discrepancies,  he  eventually  claimed  that  he  had  made  a  mistake  when
he  indicated  that  he  found  out  about  his  failure  to  appear  in  2020  or  2021.  His
evasiveness  and  inconsistent  representations  regarding  his  discovery  of  his  failure  to
appear undermine his credibility. (Tr. 20, 46-52; GE 3, 5)
In 2020, Applicant claimed that, during another security interview, he learned that
the warrant for his failure to appear was still outstanding. He hired an attorney. On July
13, 2021, he entered a plea agreement whereby he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of
operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol content of .08 or greater.  Pursuant to his plea
agreement, he was  sentenced to time  served  (2 days) and ordered  to pay court costs
and fees. He was not placed on probation and his license was not suspended. This plea
agreement  resolved  the  issue  of  his  failure  to  appear.  While  technically  breaking  the
law, given his efforts to resolve his failure to appear, he was not knowingly engaging in
criminal behavior while this charge was outstanding. (Tr. 20, 47-50; Answer; GE 3, 5)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  1996  for  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI)
while  operating  a  vehicle  on  a  military  base.  He  failed  a  field  sobriety  test  and,  after
taking a breathalyzer test, his blood alcohol content was over the legal limit. In 1997, he
pleaded guilty in federal district court to a lesser charge of negligent driving in the first
degree. (Tr. 22, 35; GE 3, 4)
State  A  entered  a  tax  lien  against  Applicant  in  2011  for  $912  for  unpaid  taxes.
Applicant  claimed  that  he  paid  this  tax  lien  in  2018,  but  he  did  not  provide
documentation to corroborate that this lien has been satisfied. During his 2017 security
interview, he denied the existence of this lien, but admitted it in his Answer. He claimed
that he fell behind on his taxes to State A because he was not making enough money to
make  ends  meet  and  he  was  not  paying  attention.  He  was  also  not  having  enough
money in taxes withheld from his income. (Tr. 19-20, 37-39, 42; Answer; GE 3, 6)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  pay  his  federal  taxes  for  the  2008,  2009,  2013,  2015,
and 2016 tax years. He claimed that he made a payment arrangement with the IRS in
2017  to  pay  $600  per  month  towards  his  $7,600  federal  tax  debt.  He  provided
documents from the IRS corroborating that he made $600 monthly payments from June
2017  until  April  2018,  and  a  $3,423  payment  in  May  2018.  He  paid  these  delinquent
federal  taxes  in  full  in  May  2018.  Applicant  claimed  that  his  federal  taxes  were
delinquent because he was not paying attention and was not withholding enough money
in taxes from his income. He claimed that he has changed his withholdings so that he
does  not  owe  taxes  at  the  end  of  the  tax  year.  Applicant  did  not  timely  file  his  2012,
2013,  and  2015 federal  income  tax  returns.  He filed  his delinquent  federal  income  tax
returns  in  May  2017.  Any  adverse  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  such  as
Applicant’s failure to timely file federal income tax returns  and his 1996 DUI, cannot be
used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the application
of  mitigating  conditions  and  for  the  whole-person  analysis.  (Tr.  19-20,  37-38,  43-44;
Answer; GE 3, 7)
Despite  being  required  to  do  so,  Applicant  failed  to  report  his  2014  arrest  for
OVWI  on  the  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  he  submitted  in  May  2017
(2017 SF 86) and April 2020 (2020 SF 86). His failure to report the OVWI in the 2020
SF  86  came  after  a  DOD  investigator  confronted  him  with  the  arrest  during  his  2017
clearance  interview.  He  also  lied  to  a  DOD  investigator  during  his  2020  security
interview when he claimed that he had not been arrested in 2014 on an alcohol charge.
During his April 2021 security interview, he lied to a DOD investigator when he denied
ever  having  been  arrested  on  any  other  alcohol-related  charges  despite  having  also
been arrested in 1996. His explanations for why he failed to  report the relevant arrests
on  his  2017  and  2020  SF  86  and  during  his  2020  and  2021  security  interviews  were
varied  and  inconsistent.  Applicant’s  explanations  included  forgetting  about  the  arrests,
not  understanding  the  question  as  provided  in  the  clearance  applications,  being
confused,  and  claiming  that  it  was  actually  his  cousin  with  a  similar  name  and  Social
Security number who had been arrested. These inconsistent representations undermine
Applicant’s credibility and strain credulity. (Tr. 23-24, 28-32, 34-39; Answer; GE 1-3)
Despite  being  required  to  do  so,  Applicant  failed  to  report  his  state  and  federal
tax  delinquencies  on  his  2017  SF  86  and  2020  SF  86.  He  claimed  that  he  made  a
mistake when he failed to report these tax delinquencies on his 2017 SF 86. He claimed
that he did not report these tax delinquencies on his 2020 SF 86 because he thought he
did not have to because he had paid his delinquent taxes.  (Tr. 32-34; Answer; GE 1-3,
6, 7)
Applicant  has  filled  out  approximately  10  security  clearance  applications
throughout  his  career,  so  he  is  not  new  to  the  process.  Given  his  lack  of  credibility
based upon his evasiveness and inconsistent and unbelievable explanations, as well as
his failure to divulge the required information, he deliberately failed to disclose his 2014
OVWI arrest on his 2017 SF 86 and his 2020 SF 86. He also lied to a DOD investigator
regarding  this  arrest  and  his  1996  DUI  arrest.  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  he  also
deliberately failed to disclose his state and federal tax delinquencies on his 2017 SF 86
and  his  2020  SF  86.  He  did  admit  his  federal  and  state  tax  delinquencies  during  his
2017 security interviews before being confronted. (Tr. 32-34, 45-52; Answer; GE 1-7)
Applicant  provided  character reference  letters from two  of  his supervisors.  Both
claim  that  Applicant  needs  his  security  clearance  to  perform  his  job  and  recommend
that  he  be  awarded  one.  They  note  that  he  is  a  hard  worker  and  has  not  had  any
security related incidents. (AE A, B)

"Applicant  initially  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  1.b.,  but
subsequently admitted all the allegations of the SOR with explanations. (TR at page 31
line  20  to  page  32  line  14.)  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since 2014.  (GX 1 at pages 7 and 15.) Applicant
was married in December of 2015, and has two children. (TR at page 20 line 17 to page

1.a.,  2.a.  and  3.a.  Applicant  admits
inadvertently  viewed  child
pornography from about 2000~2013. Starting when he was about 16 years old until his
late  20s,  Applicant,  who  liked  “petite  girls,”  used  the  Thai  word  “dek”  for  “younger
person” in  his internet  pornographic searches. Often, he accidentally viewed photos of
underage girls. (TR at page 22 line 14 to page 28 line 25, and at page 40 line 2 to page
46 line 7.) Applicant has not viewed such images in nearly ten years.
that  he
A health care professional avers that applicant ""would not have engaged in such
behaviors  had  he  not  stumbled  upon  the  images  while  viewing  Internet  pornography.”
(AppX  K  at  page  2.) This  Licensed  Clinical Social Worker  and  Certified  Sex  Addiction
Therapist  further  avers:  “based  on  my  assessment,  I  do  not  believe  that  there  is  any
sexual addiction present.” (Id.) Applicant’s spouse is aware of these allegations against
Applicant. (TR at page 13 line 10 to page 19 line 10.)
Applicant  has  signed  a  Letter  of  Intent  not  to  engage  in  such  conduct  in  the

1.b.  2.a.  and 3.a.  Applicant  admits  that he  paid  women  for sexual acts from about
2002~2015. These  acts  included   with   “prostitutes  in   Thailand   .   .  .   three   or four times,”
and   at   massage   parlors  in  both   Thailand   and   in  the   United   States.  The   last   such
conduct  occurred   in   2015,   seven   years  ago,  before  he   was  married,  at  “a   Bachelor

"Applicant  admitted   all   of   the   allegations  in  the   SOR.   (SOR  ¶¶   1.a   through   1.k,
and   2.a   through   2.e.)  Having   thoroughly   considered   the   evidence   in   the   record,
including Applicant's admissions, I make the  following findings of  fact
:
Applicant is 38  years old.  She  was previously married  on  two  occasions and  was
divorced   in  approximately   2007,   and   again   in  2017.   She   is  currently   unmarried   and
resides  with   her  three   children,   ages   5,   10,   and   14.   Applicant   began   working   for  her
current employer two years ago. She works in data  management and assists retired and
enlisted   service  members  with   their   health   insurance   benefits.   Her   employer  requires
her to  be  issued  a  trustworthiness eligibility  to  perform  specific employment duties. (GE
1, GE 2; Tr. 7-20)
Under  Guideline   H,  the   SOR  alleged   Applicant’s  use   of   controlled   substances
from  2004  to  June  2020. Under Guideline  J, the  SOR alleged  approximately  eight drug-
related  arrests and  two arrests for assault,  as follows:
Applicant  began   using   methamphetamine   (crystal  meth)   around   the   age   of   20
(2004).  Her father  had  committed  suicide  when  she  was 18  years  old,  and  she  started
hanging out with friends who used drugs. In  2004, she used  and  purchased crystal meth
to   escape   her  personal  problems   arising   from   her   father’s  death.  The   use   of   crystal
meth  started  out as recreational, but it  did  not take  long  before  her drug  use  became  a
habit and  she  used  it  on a  daily basis. (SOR ¶  2.b) (Tr. 21-23)
SOR  ¶¶   1.a   and   1.c.  Applicant  was  arrested   twice  in  2006   for  possession   of   a
controlled  substance  and  public intoxication  with  a  controlled  substance.  She  admitted
these arrests but could not recall many details about these  incidents.  (GE 2, 23-26)
SOR  ¶   1.b.  Applicant   was  arrested   in  November  2006   for  operating   a   motor
vehicle   while   under  the   influence   of   drugs  and   for  possession   of   drug   paraphernalia.
She  admitted  these  arrests and  explained  that  she  was stopped  by  police  while  driving,
and  a  syringe  was  found under  her feet.  (GE 2, GE 3; Tr.  25-27)
Applicant was arrested for driving on a suspended licenses in June 2007 (SOR ¶
1.d); for public intoxication with a controlled substance in August 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.e); and
for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  in  September  2007  (SOR  ¶  1.f).  Applicant
admitted at  the  hearing that  she  could not  remember all the details  of  her arrests and
convictions,  but  she  did  acknowledge  that  almost  all  of  her  drug-related  arrests,  cited
above, involved crystal meth. At one point, she was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail
following an arrest, but she only served about 10 days in jail. After her September 2007
arrest  for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia,  the  court  sentenced  her  to  six-and-a-half
months in jail. (Tr. 23, 26-29; GE 1, GE 3)
Applicant admitted that she gave birth to her daughter in 2008 while serving her
six-and-a-half month jail sentence. After her release, she stayed out of legal trouble for
about five years, but she continued her illegal use of controlled substances. She began
to  use  prescription  pain  pills,  without  a  valid  prescription,  on  a  daily  basis.  In  2012,
Applicant’s doctor prescribed her Suboxone, a medication to treat opioid addiction, and
she  gave  birth  to  her  second  daughter.  She  also  admitted  that  she  used  crystal  meth
again in about 2015 on a couple of occasions, but she could not recall the details. She
lost  custody  of  her  two  daughters  following  her  arrest  in  November  2016  for  assault
(domestic violence) with injury. This arrest involved a fight with her youngest daughter’s
father. He had hit her in the face with a television remote control, and she retaliated by
biting  him.  The  children  were  in  the  house  at  the  time  and  both  Applicant  and  her
daughter’s father were arrested. She was required to take  anger-management classes.
Her daughters were eventually returned to her by the court. (Tr. 28-36, 43; GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant continued using Suboxone, with a valid prescription, from 2012 through
2016. In 2017, she started going to the methadone clinic. She was pregnant at the time
with  her  third  child.  In  December  2018,  she  injured  her  arm  and  required  medical
treatment.  To  help  Applicant  calm  down  immediately  following  the  injury,  her  mother
gave  her  an  unprescribed  medication,  possibly Valium  or  Xanax.  When  Applicant  and
her  daughter arrived  at  the  hospital,  the  staff  notified  Child  Protective  Services  due  to
the  belief  that  Applicant  was  under  the  influence  of  a  controlled  substance  while  in
control  of  her  daughter.  Applicant  stopped  visiting  the  methadone  clinic  in  2019.  She
lost custody of her children again in 2019 due to her drug addiction. In 2019, she started
buying  Suboxone  illegally  from  known  sources.  She  continued  to  purchase  Suboxone
illegally until June 2020. (Tr. 28-35, 36-38, 43-51; GE 2)
In  June  2020,  Applicant  went  to  a  drug  treatment  program  to  overcome  her
substance abuse addiction. She also wanted to regain legal custody of her children and
live a drug-free lifestyle. She was diagnosed with opioid dependence, severe. She was
devoted to her recovery and she successfully completed the substance abuse treatment
program  in  September  2020.  At  that  time,  her  condition  was  listed  as  opioid
dependence, severe, in remission. Thereafter, the court returned Applicant’s children to
her custody. (Tr. 45-55; GE 4)
Since  June  2020,  Applicant  has  remained  completely  sober  and  has  not
relapsed.  She  stated that  she  was  tired of  being a  terrible  mother to  her children, and
she   was  tired   of   living   the   life   of   a   drug   addict.  She   has  remained   free   from   illegal
substances   and   addictive   prescription   medications   since   June   2020.   She   does  not
consume  alcohol  because  it is a mood-altering  substance  that can  cause her to  relapse.
After  she   completed   treatment,   she  regularly   attended   Alcoholic  Anonymous   (AA)   and
Narcotics Anonymous  (NA)  support meetings  and  was paired  with  a  sponsor. She  now
occasionally   attends  an   AA   or  NA   support   meeting   if   she   feels  the   need,  and   she
continues   to   communicate   with   her   sponsor   and   sober  friends.   Her   family   members
remain   active   in  supporting   her  recovery.   She   does  not  associate   with   her  old  friends
who  continue  to  use  illegal drugs. Her definition  of  “sober”   is  “to  be  free.”   She  testified
that  she   is  a   completely   different  person   since   June   2020,   and   she   wakes  up   every
morning   feeling   gratitude.   She   is  committed   to   her  sobriety,  her  children,   and   her
second chance  at life.  (Tr. 45-55)
Following  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  seven  letters  of  recommendation.
According to Applicant’s supervisor, since March 2021, Applicant shows up for work as
scheduled  and  performs  her  job  duties  in  a  successful  manner.  She  recommended
Applicant  be  allowed  to  continue  working  on  the  assigned  government  contract.  A
psychosocial support employee from the treatment facility, who met Applicant in August
2020, noted that she witnessed Applicant transform during treatment and could see that
she  wanted  a  better  life.  After  Applicant’s  successful  completion  of  treatment,  the
support employee reported seeing Applicant attending community substance abuse and
recovery  events.  Even  though  Applicant  is  a  busy  single  mom  holding  down  a  stable
job, she has reached out several times to help others start their own recovery process.
Applicant’s  friend  and  family  members  all  described  Applicant  as  a  new  person  who
continues to set a good example for her children. They all reported how proud they were
of her continued sobriety and productive lifestyle. (AE A- G)

"After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He served in the United States Navy from September
1989 to February 2017, was honorably discharged, and retired as an E-6. While serving
in  the  Navy  he  completed  extensive  training  and  numerous  schools  receiving
certifications as a journeymen electronics technician and master training specialist. He is
twice divorced and was married from April 1994 to June 1998, and August 2006 to May
2016.  He has  two  adult  children, ages 29 and  24.  He was  unemployed from  February
2017 to May 2018, and has been employed as an analyst for a federal contractor since
May 2018. He held a security clearance while serving in the Navy, including a top secret
clearance. (GE 1; GE 2; AE A; AE B; Tr. 11, 41-51, 77-80, 105-107)
Applicant  admitted  all  SOR  allegations.  (SOR  Response;  Tr.  17-22)  The  SOR
allegations and relevant evidence are summarized below.
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct  and Guideline  J  - Criminal Conduct
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and 1.b:  Deliberately  provided false   information for dependent
benefits  and renewed ID card for ineligible  former spouse:  Applicant admitted that
he deliberately provided false information to the Navy on at least three occasions from
about May 2013 to September 2014 in order to receive dependent benefits, including a
dependent ID card, to which he was not legally entitled. In about May 2013 and November
2013, he signed dependency application forms falsely identifying his former spouse, who
had  divorced  him  in June  1998, as his current  spouse. In  about September 2014, he  told
a  Navy  officer that his second  ex-wife,  then  his spouse,  was his ex-girlfriend, when  in fact
she  had  been  his spouse  since  August 2006.  He testified  that he  married  his first spouse
in April 1994  and  that  their  daughter  was born  in  1993.   At  some  point,  he  and  his  first
spouse  became  estranged. In 2005, he  decided  to  divorce his first spouse  in anticipation
of  marrying  another woman, but  learned  that  his first wife  had  divorced  him  in  June  1998.
He  testified   and   told  Navy   investigators  that  prior  to   2005,   he   did   not   know   he   was
divorced, had  not signed  or  received  any  divorce  paperwork, and  never went to  court. He
testified  “when  I  found  out I should’ve  said  something  then,  but I  thought I  did  something,
and  that’s where I tried  to  cover it up  because  I thought  I was already  screwed.” (Tr. 57)
He decided  not to  update  his dependents status when  he  married  his second  spouse  in
August 2006,  because  he  thought he  had  received  allowances that  he  was not eligible  for
after his first  marriage  ended  in  divorce and  “didn’t  want to  get  in trouble.” (Tr.  58)  (SOR
Response; GE 2  at 1-2; GE  6; Tr. 18-19, 42, 51-77, 105-115)
He continued to identify his former spouse as his current spouse on dependent ID
application  forms  until  at  least  November  2013,  and  she  received  dependent  benefits
including medical care through at least October 2013. He said that he did not know that
she  received  dependent  benefits,  that  he  did  not  intend  for  her  to  do  so,  and  that  he
reimbursed the Government for the cost of those benefits. He did not submit documentary
evidence to corroborate his claims.  In a sworn statement to investigators, his  first wife
stated  that  Applicant  would  not  cooperate  with  the  divorce,  so  in  accordance  with
guidance from her attorney, she sent copies of the divorce decree to him and his Navy
supervisor. She also said that thereafter “about every four years, around the time our ID
cards were about to expire [Applicant would call and tell her she] could get the ID cards
[for herself and their daughter].” (GE 6 at 23) She indicated her relationship with Applicant
was contentious and that one of the few reasons they communicated was when her or
her daughter’s military ID was about to expire. (SOR Response; GE 2 at 1-2; GE 6; Tr.
18-19, 42, 51-77, 105-115)
SOR ¶  2.a:  Special  court-martial guilty  plea  and sentence:  In  September 2014,
Applicant’s second  spouse  reported  that  she  had  been  married  to  Applicant since  2006
and   that  she  had   not  received   a   military   identification   (ID)   card or benefits.  In   October
2014,  Applicant  provided   a   statement  to   Navy   investigators  admitting   the   misconduct
alleged   in   SOR  ¶¶   1.a   and   1.b.  (GE   6   at   19-21).  In   response   to   the   SOR,   Applicant
admitted  that in about October 2015  he  pled  guilty to  four military  offenses  including  three
false  official  statements  for   identifying   his  former  spouse   as  his   current   spouse   in
dependent application  forms in May and November 2013,  and intentionally deceiving his
administrative   officer  in  September  2014   by   identifying   his   then   spouse   as  his  “ex-
girlfriend,”   and   wrongfully   renewing   his  former  spouse’s  military  ID   card.  He  was
sentenced to  reduction  in rate from  E-8  to  E-7, forfeiture  of  $3,000  pay  per month for six
months,   and   fined   $2,242.   Following   subsequent  administrative   proceedings,  the
Secretary  of  the  Navy  approved  his retirement in the  paygrade  of  E6. (SOR Response;

Guideline F – Financial Considerations
SOR ¶  3.a:  cross  alleges  information in SOR ¶¶  1.a  and 1.b. Applicant admitted
the allegation. (SOR Response; Tr. 20-21)
SOR ¶  3.b:  failure  to  file  federal income  taxes  for tax  years  2017  and 2018.
Applicant  admitted that  he failed  to file,  as required, federal income  tax returns for tax
years  2017  and  2018.  He  noted  that  he  was  “[a]waiting  paperwork  (W-2’s).”  (SOR
Response at 2) He testified that he had not filed federal income tax returns for tax years
2017 or 2018 because he was awaiting the outcome of the security clearance process to
determine whether he could afford to resolve his delinquent tax accounts, or if he should
file for bankruptcy. He acknowledged he had not contacted the IRS about filing or paying
his delinquent taxes, and said that he had been claiming zero exemptions to minimize his
tax debt. He said that he had consulted with a friend with tax preparation experience three
times from approximately April 2018 to June 2021. He attributed his financial difficulties
and  decision  not  to  file  income  tax  returns  to  divorce,  child  support,  loss  of  income
associated  with  his  court-martial  sentence,  including  administrative  errors  in  his  pay,
unemployment, and uncertainty about his future employment. (SOR Response; GE 1 at

SOR  ¶   3.c:   collection  account   for  $5,895.   Applicant  admitted  the  allegation.
Credit  reports  from  September  2019  and  July  2020  reflect  the  account  as  placed  for
collection  with  a  balance  of  $5,895,  and  that  the  consumer  disputed  the  account
information. He testified the debt was for an apartment lease that he had signed in 2017
for a friend, and that his friend had moved out of the apartment in approximately 2018.
He attributed his financial difficulties to his friend’s failure to pay the rent,  divorce, child
support,
including
administrative  errors  in  his  pay,  unemployment,  and  uncertainty  about  his  future
employment. He said that he was awaiting the outcome of the security clearance process
to determine whether he could afford to pay the debt or if he should file for bankruptcy.
He provided no documentary evidence that he contacted the creditor, made payments on
or otherwise resolved the debt. This debt is not resolved. (SOR Response; GE 2 at 4; GE
3 at 5; GE 4 at 1; Tr. 20-21, 90-92)
income  associated  with  his  court-martial  sentence,
loss  of
SOR ¶  3.d: credit card account  in collection for $10,472. Applicant admitted
the allegation. A September 2019 credit report reflects an individual account in collection
for $10,472, and credit reports from July 2020 and May 2022 show that debt has been
charged off. He testified that this was his credit card account and that his second wife
was  an  authorized  user  on  the  account.  He  said  that  he  had  not  tried  to  contact  the
creditor  and  attributed  his financial  difficulties  to  divorce,  child  support,  loss  of  income
associated  with  his  court-martial  sentence,  including  administrative  errors  in  his  pay,
unemployment, and uncertainty about his future employment. This debt is not resolved.

SOR  ¶   3.e:  vehicle   loan  charged  off  for  $6,905.   Applicant  admitted  the
allegation. Credit reports from July 2020 and May 2022 reflect the account as a vehicle
loan  opened  in  January  2015,  with  a  last  payment  in  March  2018,  charged  off  for
approximately $23,000, and with a past-due balance of $6,905. He testified that he fell
behind on payments in late 2017 and that the vehicle was repossessed in early 2018. He
attributed his delinquency to  divorce,  child  support,  loss of  income associated  with  his
court-martial  sentence,  including  administrative  errors  in  his  pay,  unemployment,  and
uncertainty about his future employment. He said that he contacted the creditor by phone
in late 2017, but provided no documentary evidence of that contact or other attempts to
resolve the debt. This debt is not resolved. (SOR Response; GE 4 at 2-3; GE 5 at 4; Tr.
20-21, 93-96)
SOR ¶  3.f: credit card account  charged off  for $3,880. Applicant admitted the
allegation. Credit reports from September 2019, July 2020 and May 2022 reflect the credit
card account was opened in 2008, with the last payment in January 2018, and charged
off for $3,880. He attributed his delinquency on the account to his divorce from his second
wife, child support, loss of income associated with his court-martial sentence, including
administrative  errors  in  his  pay,  unemployment,  and  uncertainty  about  his  future
employment. He said that he contacted the creditor by phone in late 2017, but provided
no documentary evidence of that contact or other attempts to resolve the debt. This debt
is not resolved. (SOR Response; GE 2 at 3-4; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 4; Tr. 20-21,
96-97)
SOR  ¶   3.g:  delinquent   vehicle   loan   in  the   amount   of   $23,729.   Applicant
admitted the allegation. Credit reports from September 2019, July 2020, and May 2022
reflect  a  joint  auto  loan  account  was  opened  in  June  2015,  with  the  last  payment  in
September 2017, as an involuntary repossession account with a balance of $23,729 and
past due in the amount of $10,846. He testified that he cosigned a vehicle loan for his
son’s  mother,  and  that  when  she  could  no  longer  pay  the  loan  he was  also  unable  to
make payments because of his divorce from his second wife, child support, loss of income
associated  with  his  court-martial  sentence,  including  administrative  errors  in  his  pay,
unemployment,  and  uncertainty  about  his  future  employment.  The  past  due  balance
reflected in the credit records is $10,846; this debt is not resolved. (SOR Response; GE
2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5, GE 5 at 6; Tr. 20-21, 97-98)
Applicant testified that his net monthly income is approximately $8,400 including
$4,800 (federal contractor net pay), $1,800 (Navy retired pay), and $1,800 (Department
of Veterans Affairs  (VA) disability payments for an 80% service-connected disability). He
estimated  his  bank  account  balance  at  approximately  $6,000,  his  retirement  account
balance at about $20,000, and said that he had over $10,000 in cash. He did not provide
a monthly budget, but estimated his monthly disposable income after expenses at $3,000.
He  said  that  his  disposable  income  varied  and  that  he  had  recently  been  providing
financial assistance to his mother because she was ill. He testified that he had received
financial counseling in the Navy and every time that he made a big purchase.  He said
that he has never been late on his rent. (Tr. 45-47, 85-89, 99-104, 127)
Applicant provided documentary evidence that he was qualified in Navy nuclear
submarines, completed extensive submarine training, earned multiple qualifications, and
received  numerous  awards  and  decorations  during  his  Naval  service.  (AE  A)  He
submitted  a  letter  of  recommendation  from  a  retired  Navy  leader  that  favorably
commented  on  his  technical  skills,  performance  of  duties,  leadership,  judgement,
handling of classified information, dependability, and included a recommendation that he
be granted a security clearance. (AE B)
Applicant also testified that he had not filed federal income tax returns for tax years
2019  through  2021  because  he  was  awaiting  the  outcome  of  the  security  clearance
process. (Tr. 82-85, 117-126) Any derogatory information not alleged in the SOR will not
be considered for disqualifying purposes; however, it may be considered in the application
of mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis.
",False
"Applicant is 33 years old, unmarried, and has four children under the age of 13.
She received a high school diploma and attended college classes for five months in 2005.
Applicant has been employed by defense contractors as a security guard since 2008. She
first  received  a  security  clearance  in  2006.  She  seeks  to  retain  her  national  security
eligibility and a security clearance in connection with her employment. (Item 3 at Sections
1, 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Item 4 at 1.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline  F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is
financially  overextended  with  delinquent  debts  and  therefore  is  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy,  or  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate  funds.  In  her
Answer, Applicant admitted all but one of the SOR allegations under this guideline. The
existence  and  amounts  of  these  debts  are  also  supported  by  the  credit  reports  in  the
record dated November 17, 2020, and June 17, 2022. (Items 1, 2, 6, and 7.)
The status of the matters set forth in this paragraph of the SOR is as follows:
1.a. Multiple Federal student loan accounts placed for collection in the total amount
of approximately $23,476. Item 6, Applicant’s June 2022 credit report, details 13 student
loan accounts opened by Applicant during the 2011 to 2015 period. Applicant defaulted
on repaying the loans in or about April or May 2018, based upon the dates of last activity
reported in her June 2022 credit report in the record (Item 6). Her e-QIP reflects no college
classes during the 2011 to 2015 period. In her background interview, Appellant reported
that she defaulted because she was between jobs at the time. The e-QIP does not reflect
any unemployment in 2019 or thereafter. In her Answer, Applicant stated that her loans
are on “pause” pursuant to Federal policy, and she intends to set up a payment plan when
the pause expires. She provided no information to establish that she has rehabilitated her
Federal  student  loans in  collection,  which  were  in  default  prior  to  the  beginning  of  the
Federal “pause” policy first instituted at the beginning of the COVID pandemic in March
2020. She has also provided no evidence that her student loans are eligible for the benefit
of the Federal “pause” program or that she has the financial ability to pay her loans under
a future payment plan. These debts are not resolved. (Item 2 at 5; Item 6 at 4-8; Item 7
at 2-7.)
1.b. Debt placed for collection in 2017 in the approximate amount of $2,062. In her
Answer, Applicant admitted this debt and wrote that she was willing to set up a payment
plan.  She  has  not  asserted  that  she  has  set  up  a  plan  or  made  any  payments  to  the
creditor. This debt is not resolved. (Item 2 at 6; Item 7 at 4, 6.)
1.c.  Debt  charged  off  in  2017  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $1,653.  Applicant
opened this credit-card  account  with  Bank A  in  September 2017 and defaulted  on  her
payments in December 2017. In her Answer, Applicant admitted this debt and wrote that
she was willing to set up a payment plan. She has not asserted that she has set up a plan
or made any payments to the creditor. This debt is not resolved. (Item 2 at 6; Item 6 at
16; Item 7 at 5.)
1.d. Debt placed for collection in 2018 in the approximate amount of $894. In her
Answer, Applicant admitted this debt and wrote that she was willing to set up a payment
plan.  She  has  not  asserted  that  she  has  set  up  a  plan  or  made  any  payments  to  the
creditor. This debt is not resolved. (Item 2 at 6; Item 7 at 7.)
1.e. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $433. In her Answer,
Applicant denied this debt and wrote that she had paid it. She provided no evidence of
her payment and did not assert when she paid the debt. The debt, however, does not
appear in the Government’s most recent credit report in the record (Item 6). This debt is
resolved. (Item 2 at 6; Item 7 at 8.)
1.f. Debt placed for collection in 2020 in the approximate amount of $412. In her
Answer, Applicant admitted this debt and wrote that she was willing to set up a payment
plan.  She  has  not  asserted  that  she  has  set  up  a  plan  or  made  any  payments  to  the
creditor. This debt is not resolved. (Item 2 at 6; Item 6 at 9; Item 7 at 8.)
1.g. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $348. In her Answer,
Applicant admitted this debt and wrote that she was willing to set up a payment plan. She
has not asserted that she has set up a plan or made any payments to the creditor. This
debt is not resolved. (Item 2 at 6; Item 7 at 8.)
1.h. Debt placed for collection in 2016 in the approximate amount of $256. In her
Answer, Applicant admitted this debt and wrote that she was willing to set up a payment
plan.  She  has  not  asserted  that  she  has  set  up  a  plan  or  made  any  payments  to  the
creditor. This debt is not resolved. (Item 2 at 6; Item 6 at 9; Item 7 at 9.)
1.i.  Debt  charged  off  in  2017  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $16,238.  Applicant
opened  this  vehicle  loan  account  with  Bank  A  in  February  2016  and  defaulted  on  her
payments  in  March  2017.  The  account  was  subsequently  charged  off.  In  her  Answer
Applicant  admitted  this  debt  and  wrote  that  the  creditor  repossessed  the  vehicle.  She
believed  that  the  balance  after  the  resale  of  the  vehicle  should  be  lower  that  than  the
alleged  amount  of  the  debt.  Nevertheless,  she  wrote  that  she  was  willing  to  set  up  a
payment plan to repay the debt. She has not asserted that she has set up a plan or made
any payments to the creditor. The Government’s credit reports are somewhat inconsistent
on the status of the debt. The November 2020 report (Item 7) states that the outstanding
balance is $16,238, but it also states that the debt was settled for less than the full balance
of the debt. It further reflects that the charged-off debt was paid. The more recent credit
report (Item 6) states that the  balance  is $0  and  that the  “Account Was Paid For Less
Than Full Balance.” Based upon the information in the credit reports, this debt is resolved.
(Item 2 at 6; Item 6 at 15; GE 7 at 9.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because of her
judgment,  reliability,  and
criminal  conduct,  which  raises  questions  about  her
trustworthiness;  and  about  her  ability  and  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and
regulations. In her Answer, Applicant admitted her recent arrest but noted that the charge
against her was dropped. (Item 2 at 3, 6.)
The status of the matters set forth in this paragraph of the SOR is as follows:
2.a. February 2021 arrest on an arrest warrant for Felony Embezzlement issued in
October  2016.  Applicant  worked  as  a  cashier  at  a  retail  chain  in  October  2016.  Her
employer accused her of  stealing about $340 from her cash register and filed charges
with the police. The theft occurred over a period of about eight days. After the last incident
Applicant failed to appear for her scheduled work shifts and failed to contact anyone at
her employer. The local police report in the record, which is included as part of Item 5,
identifies  in  detail  the  complainant,  who  was  a  loss-prevention  employee  of  the  store
where  Applicant  worked,  and  the  three  dates  and  amounts  of  the  cash  shortages
discovered in Applicant’s registers. The reporting police officer commented in his report
that he obtained a felony warrant for Applicant’s arrest from a judge and filed the warrant
“at the warrant desk.” Applicant was arrested on the warrant in February 2021 during a
routine check due to her vehicle being improperly parked. The police department’s Arrest
Report appears in the record. The only information in the record regarding the disposition
of the charge is Applicant’s statement in her Answer that the charge was “dropped.” The
arrest  occurred  after  she  submitted  her  e-QIP  and  her  background  investigation.  The
arrest  was  reported  in  a  DoD  Continuous  Evaluation  Program  report,  dated  June  17,
2021. (Item 2 at 3, 6; Item 5 at 3-7.)
Paragraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  clearance  because  she
provided false information in her October 12, 2020 e-QIP, which raises questions about
trustworthiness.  Applicant  omitted  requested
judgment,  honesty,  reliability,  and
information  in  her  response  to  questions  about  her  financial  history.  In  her  Answer
Applicant wrote that she believed that her debts were outside of the seven-year period
covered by the e-QIP questions.
3.a. Falsification in the e-QIP regarding debts. The relevant e-QIP question asked
Applicant to disclose bills or debts turned over to collection agencies and accounts and
credit  cards  suspended,  charged  off,  or  cancelled  for  failure  to  pay  as  agreed.  Both
questions were limited to such actions taken in the last seven years, i.e., during the period
October  2013  to  October  2020.  Applicant  responded  “No”  to  both  questions,  thereby
failing to disclose the debts and accounts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i.
All of the defaulted obligations were turned over to a collection agency or charged off for
failure to pay as agreed during the period 2016 to 2020. Applicant should have listed all
of the debts and accounts alleged in the SOR.
In   her  Answer,  Applicant   wrote   that   she   failed   to   list  her  debts  because   she
believed   that  they   arose   more  than   seven   years  ago.  Her  excuse   for  failing   to   list  her
debts is not credible. None  of the debts became delinquent more than  four  years prior to
the  date  she  signed  the  e-QIP  and  certified  that her answers were truthful and  correct.
The  deliberateness of her non-disclosure is also evidenced  by  her failure to disclose  her
defaults on  her Federal student loans  within a  year or two  prior to  the  date  of  her e-QIP.
When  given  the  opportunity  to  voluntarily  disclose  her defaults on  her student loans  during
her November 2020  background  interview, she  failed  to  do  so. Applicant even  went so
far  as   to   not   disclose   in   her  e-QIP   her   post-high   school  education,   which   was  paid   by
these  13  student loans  accounts opened  by  Applicant  between  2011  and  2015.  Her non-
disclosure of these  college  courses  is evidence  that  she  was actively seeking to  conceal
her defaults on her student loans. (GE 3 at 2.)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  2.b.  He
admitted SOR ¶ 2.a. He did not answer the cross-allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.a and 4.a. He
included  a  brief  narrative  statement  with  his  answer.  Applicant’s  admission
is
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years old. He was married from 1999 until August 2013, when he
and  his  wife  divorced.  They  have  four  children,  all  born  between  1999  and  2005.
Applicant  has been  employed  in the defense  industry since  about 2007,  in  the field  of
logistics. He has worked for his current employer since August 2018. (Item 3)
On his June 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed prior U.S. Government background
investigations in 2007 and 2012. He also disclosed that, in about January 2018, he had
a  security  clearance  eligibility  or  access  authorization  denied,  suspended,  or  revoked,
by an AGA. He reported that he had held a clearance without incident since 2007, but
that  the  AGA  had  revoked  his  access  to  a  particular  facility,  following  an  inconclusive
polygraph result. (Item 3 at 38-39)
Government  Item  4  is  a  Clearance  Decision  Statement  (CDS)  from  the  AGA,
dated  May  9,  2018.  The  CDS  notes  as  background  that  Applicant  had  held  access  to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) since March 2008 through AGA 1, and then
was  indoctrinated  for  SCI  access  with  AGA  2  in  September  2014,  pending  final
adjudication. (Item 4 at 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed   by   AGA   2   counterintelligence   representatives  in
September  2014   and   January   2015   without  incident.   (Item   4   at  1)  During   a   third
interview, in February 2015, he revealed  the  following  security-significant information:
   Applicant advised  that  he  solicited  and  paid  a  prostitute  for  oral sex  three
times, once  in the  early  2000s, once  in 2009  or 2010, and  once   in spring
2013.  On   each   occasion,  he   went  to   an  area   known   to  be  frequented  by
prostitutes. A female approached his car at  a stop  light and  he  allowed  her
to   get   in.   They   drove   to   an   alley   and   she   performed   oral   sex   on   him,   for
which he paid  $20. (Item 4 at 2)  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 3.a, 4.a)
   Applicant reported  a  history  of  excessive  alcohol consumption. His alcohol
consumption   was  moderate   until  2011   or  2012,  when   it  increased
significantly   after  he   learned   of  his  wife’s  infidelity.  He   would  become
intoxicated  twice weekly by  drinking  whiskey  and  vodka. On  one  instance
in winter 2012,  he passed out  on the  street in front  of his house. He  awoke
in bed after someone  helped him inside. (Item 4 at 2)  (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 4.a)
   Applicant  also   acknowledged   that   on  five   or six   occasions  between   1990
(when   he   was  underage)  and   2014,  he   operated   a   motor  vehicle   while
knowingly  intoxicated. On  two  occasions in December 2014, he  consumed
whiskey  while driving. (Item 4  at 2)  (SOR ¶¶  2.a, 3.a, 4.a)
Applicant  had  a  fourth  interview in  July  2015.  It  revealed  no  security  significant
information.  He  had  a  fifth  interview  in  December  2018  that  revealed  the  following
information:
   Applicant  reiterated   facts  about  his  prior  solicitations   of  prostitutes,   as
discussed   above,  and   added   that  he   had   consumed   alcohol  in  his  car,
while   driving,   prior  to   the   2013   solicitation.   He  also  disclosed   that  he
similarly  solicited  and  paid a  prostitute  for oral sex, once  in 2015,  twice in
May  or June  2017, and  once  in July  2017, under similar circumstances to
those   as   previously   described   during   his  third   interview.  (Item   4   at  3-4)
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 3.a, 4.a)
   Applicant  also   acknowledged   searching   for  prostitutes  on   the   internet  in
January,  August,   October,   and   November  2017.  On   one   occasion,   he
exchanged one text message  with someone, but had second thoughts and
did not  follow through. (Item  4 at 3-4)  (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 4.a)
   Applicant  said  he   had   not  consumed  alcohol to   intoxication   since  August
2013, and  had  not driven  while  impaired  by  alcohol since  December  2014,
when   he   drove   after  consuming   one   mixed   drink.  His  alcohol  use   since
August 2013 had remained consistent and “extremely light.” (Item  4  at 4)
AGA  1  subsequently  rescinded  Applicant’s  classified  access  and  he  was
debriefed in September 2017. (Item 4 at 1) A sixth interview, in February 2018, revealed
no information of significance. (Item 4 at 4)
As  part  of  an  interrogatory  from  DOHA,  Applicant  was  given  the  opportunity  to
review,  correct,  and  adopt  as  accurate  the  summaries  of  his  interviews  with  the  AGA
investigators,  discussed  above.  In  his  December  2021  response,  Applicant  affirmed
their accuracy without further comment. (Item 5)
Applicant  also  affirmed  the  accuracy  of  the  summary  of  a  security  clearance
background interview he had in September 2019  following his June 2019 SCA with an
agent  of  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  During  that  interview,  he
discussed  the  fact  that  he  was  subject  to  two  polygraph  interviews  with  the  AGA.  He
asserted  that  he  was  told  that  one  of  the  interviews  was  inconclusive,  and  that  he
passed  the  other  one.  He  acknowledged  that,  in  January  2018,  he  was  told  that  the
AGA had revoked his access.  Unlike in his interviews  with the AGA, in his September
2019 OPM interview, Applicant did not address his prior engagement with prostitutes or
his history of alcohol involvement. (Item 5 at 8)
In  his  December  2021  interrogatory  response,  Applicant  provided  updated
information about his alcohol consumption. He said he no longer consumed alcohol and
did not intend to do so in the future. He said the last time he drank to intoxication was
“years ago” after he  learned  of  his wife’s infidelity. He could  not recall  the  last  time  he
drove under the influence of  alcohol. He  denied having been charged with any DUI or
DWI offenses and none were revealed elsewhere in the record.  Applicant also said he
had not solicited or engaged in sexual acts with a prostitute since July 2017. (Item 5)
Under  Guideline  D,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a,  which  alleged  that  between
2010 and July 2017, he engaged in sexual activity with prostitutes while granted access
to classified information. He also denied SOR ¶ 1.b, which alleged that during 2017, he
searched internet personal ads for prostitutes on multiple occasions. (Item 2)
Under  Guideline  G,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  2.a,  which  alleged  that,  from
summer  2014  to  December  2014,  he  drove  on  multiple  occasions  while  under  the
influence of alcohol, and while consuming alcohol. He denied SOR ¶ 2.b, which alleged
that  from  late  2011  to  about  September  2013,  he  drank  alcohol  to  intoxication  about
twice a week, and that once in 2012, he was so intoxicated that he passed out on the
street  in  front  of  his  home.  (Item  2)  Applicant  did  not  answer  the  cross-allegations,
under Guidelines J and E. (Item 2)
Applicant  offered  no  explanation  or  specifics in  answering  the  SOR  allegations,
except the following statement:
This   was  coerced   by   the   polygrapher.  What   I  did  do   was  from   the   past
where  I  made   mistakes  like   any   human   being.  I  had   something   serious
the   gentleman   who   was  very
to
going   on,  which
I   explained
unprofessional.  I   DO   NOT  request   a   hearing.  (Item   2)  (Emphasis  in
original)
Applicant did not elaborate and did not respond  to  the  Government’s FORM, so
he provided no additional information in mitigation.
",False
"In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the  SOR allegations  in ¶¶  1.a  through
1.k  and  2.a.  (HE  3) He  also provided  mitigating  information.  His  admissions  are  accepted
as findings  of  fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a 50-year-old outside machinist employed by a large DOD contractor
for  the  previous  five  years.  (Tr.  8,  10)  In  1980,  he  received  a  General  Education
Development  diploma.  (Tr. 8) He  has  attended  college;  however,  he  did  not  receive  a
degree. (Tr. 8) He was married three times, and his most recent marriage was in 2020.
(Tr. 9) His children are ages 15, 24, and 27 years old. (Tr. 10)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  gross  salary  is  about  $130,000,  and  his  spouse’s  salary  is  about
$50,000. (Tr. 54, 72) His spouse pays some of the family expenses. (Tr. 53) They do not
have  any  car  payments.  (Tr.  54)  Starting  in  March  2022,  Applicant  paid  about  $200
monthly to employ two credit-repair companies (CRC) to contest the debts on his credit
report. (Tr. 47-52) He wanted better credit to enable him to purchase a house. (Tr. 47) He
generated a budget. (Tr. 48) He tries to set aside 75 percent of his pay after making all
payments for debts and expenses for savings. (Tr. 48, 53-54) He has about $20,000 in
savings. (Tr. 55) On September 21, 2022, he and his spouse closed on a house with a
mortgage  of  about  $402,000,  a  monthly payment  of  about  $2,800,  and  about  $21,000
cash due at closing. (AE B) On August 8, 2022, his credit scores from Equifax, Experian,
and TransUnion ranged from 635 to 685. (AE A)
The  SOR  alleges  11  delinquent  debts  totaling  $32,275,  and  their  status  is  as
follows.
SOR  ¶   1.a  alleges  a  delinquent  child-support  account  placed  for  collection  for
$5,157.  Applicant’s  weekly  child-support  responsibility  is  $138  for  his  15-year-old  son.
(Tr. 34) The payments are made automatically from his paycheck. (Tr. 34) Applicant was
in jail for nine months (February to October 2019) because he was  charged with rape,
and he was unable to pay his child support. (Tr. 33) His August 11, 2020 credit report
indicates the account is $5,814 delinquent. (Tr. 34; GE 2 at 4) Applicant’s November 17,
2022 child-support statement shows his current arrearage is $2,571. (Tr. 36; AE C)
SOR ¶¶  1.b, 1.c,  and 1.i allege three charged-off accounts for $2,030, $1,287, and
$139. The $2,030 debt  was for the purchase of  a vehicle.  (Tr. 36) He  said the $2,030
account was current before he was arrested for rape. (Tr. 36) The debt for $1,287 was a
personal loan for a trailer. (Tr. 37) On December 10, 2021, the creditor wrote the $1,287
debt was satisfied. (AE G) Applicant said the other accounts were paid around April 2022.
(Tr.  36-38,  42)  He  provided  a  December  10,  2021  account  statement  showing  a  loan

account statement has a handwritten note on it indicating it was paid on December 21,
2021. (AE F) I accept his verbal averment that all three debts are resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.d  through  1.h allege five medical accounts placed for collection for $523,
$368, $279, $222, and $174. Applicant said he paid the $523 medical debt a few months
ago.  (Tr.  38)  He  believed  he  paid  some  of  the  other  medical  debts;  however,  he  was
contesting some medical debts because his son may be responsible for them. (Tr. 39-40)
I have credited him with either paying or attempting to verify his responsibility for the five
medical debts.
SOR  ¶   1.j  alleges  a  telecommunications  account  placed  for  collection  for  $82.
Applicant has an account with the creditor, and he intends to pay this debt. (Tr. 42-43)
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a charged-off account for $11,508. Applicant said around 2015
he  cosigned  for  the  vehicle  loan  with  a  girlfriend,  and  she  was  supposed  to  make  the
payments. (Tr. 44-46) The relationship ended. (Tr. 45) He acknowledged he was legally
responsible for the payments; however, he never made any payments. (Tr. 46)  He told
the OPM investigator that he refused to pay for the vehicle, and he should not be held
responsible for the debt. (GE 8 at 9)
Applicant’s October 7, 2022, credit report shows one charged-off account with a
zero balance and 14 accounts with “pays account as agreed” status. (GE 4)  It does not
show any debts in collections. (Id.)
Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  he  was  charged  with  rape.  (SOR
response) However, he denied that he raped Ms. A. Court records indicate in July 2019,
he as indicted based on a grand jury true bill; he was arraigned; and in October 2019, the
charge  was  nolle  prosequi.  (GE  5  at  3)  There  was  a  search  warrant  for  the  sheets
because Ms. A described the sheets and said he ejaculated on the sheets after the rape.
(GE 6) Applicant denied that he ejaculated on the sheets. (Tr. 81; GE 6 at 3, 9) The police
found  the  sheets Ms. A  described  in Applicant’s washer  when the search warrant was
executed. (GE 6 at 9) Applicant said the police did not have his DNA or other physical
evidence to corroborate Ms. A’s allegation of rape. (Tr. 25, 68, 81-82) Ms. A was present
for one court hearing; she failed to appear at court for the next hearing; and the charge
was dismissed. (Tr. 25) Applicant was in jail for nine months. (Tr. 25) He was reinstated
at his job. (Tr. 71)
Applicant said a week before he met Ms. A, he applied for a passport because he
was planning a trip outside the country. (Tr. 24) He did not provide a copy of his passport
application. He met Ms. A through an online account. (Tr. 56) Ms. A was 38 years old.
(Tr. 56) He met Ms. A for the first time in person at a gym in February 2019, and she went
to his residence, where he received oral sex from her. (Tr. 21, 56, 72-74) The following
day, he purchased the parts to repair Ms. A’s brakes on her car, and he went to Ms. A’s
residence to work on the brakes of her car. (Tr. 21-22, 57-58) The third day, Ms. A came
to Applicant’s residence around midnight to watch a movie. (Tr. 58) She went outside of
his house to smoke marijuana. (Tr. 77) He said Ms. A was intoxicated when she was at
his residence. (Tr. 57-58) Even though he had fixed her brakes the previous day, it “never
crossed his mind” that she was coming over to his residence to engage in sexual activity
with him. (Tr. 89-90)
Ms. A said that she and Applicant were in bed watching a movie, and he put her
hand on his penis. (GE 6 at 6) She told him that she was not doing that, and he said, “I’ll
be  damned.” (Id.) Applicant got on top of her, pulled her pants down, pushed her legs
apart, and engaged in sexual intercourse with her against her will. (Id.) She screamed
and yelled that she did not want Applicant to have sexual intercourse with her. (Id.)
Applicant  denied  that  he  put  her  hand  on  his  penis,  climbed  on  top  of  her, and
engaged in sexual intercourse with her. (Tr. 75-77) He said she slept on his sofa, and she
did not sleep in his bed. (Tr. 87) He did not explain why she engaged in oral sex with him
and then two days later refused his sexual advances. (Tr. 77-78)
Applicant said he went to the restroom to take a shower, and when he came back
into the room where he left his wallet, he noticed his wallet had moved. (Tr. 22, 59, 78)
He believed Ms. A had gone through his wallet; he checked the contents of his wallet;
and he noticed one of his bank cards was missing from his wallet. (Tr. 22, 78) He accused
Ms. A of taking his bank card. (Tr. 22)
In response to Applicant’s accusation, Ms. A said “you don’t believe me, then I’ll
strip for you, and show you I ain’t got it.” (Tr. 22) Ms. A took off her pants; she pulled down
her panties; she pulled up her shirt; and his credit card fell out from under her bra strap
onto the floor. (Tr. 23, 78-79) Applicant did not explain why Ms. A would lift up her shirt if
she knew his bank card was under her bra strap. Ms. A put her clothes on and ran out of
his residence. (Tr. 23, 80-82)
At about 7:00 a.m., Ms. A backed her car into the street, and she hit another car
that Ms. B was driving down the street. (Tr. 23, 59, 83) Applicant said Ms. A drove away
without  telling  Ms.  B  her  contact  information.  Applicant  advised  Ms.  B  about  Ms.  A’s
contact information. (Tr. 23) About three minutes later, Ms. A drove back to Applicant’s
residence and almost hit him with her vehicle. (Tr. 23, 83) According to Applicant, Ms. A
complained about him providing information to Ms. B, she said “you so-and-so, you gave
my f’n information to that lady.” (Tr. 83) Ms. A continued, “. . . well you gave the lady my
information. I’m going to tell the police you raped me.” (Tr. 23, 81, 84) He did not know
whether Ms. B heard Ms. A make this threat. (Tr. 84)
Police  officers  went  to  Applicant’s  residence  because  of  a  report  of  an  accident
with no injuries. (GE 6 at 3) Ms. A told the police that she stayed overnight at Applicant’s
residence; he made sexual advances; she told him to stop; he got on top of her, pulled
down her pants; and raped her. (Id.) The police report does not mention where Applicant
was  located  when  the  police  were  getting  the  initial  report  from  Ms.  A.  (Id.)  Later  the
morning of accident, the police searched Applicant’s residence. (Id. at 5) Applicant was
not present during the search. (Id. at 6)
A  few  hours  later,  the  sheriff’s  office  called  Applicant,  advised  him  of  Ms.  A’s
allegations, and asked him what happened. (Tr. 24; GE 6 at 7) He denied that anything
happened except Ms. A hit Ms. B with  Ms. A’s vehicle. (Tr. 61, 91) The  sheriff’s office
asked  him  to  come  to  their  office;  Applicant  said  he  would  be  there  in  20  minutes;
Applicant contacted an attorney; and his attorney advised him that he did not need to go
to the sheriff’s office. (Tr. 24, 84; GE 6 at 7)
Shortly after the alleged  rape, Applicant  sent  Ms. A several texts  apologizing to
her. (Tr. 86) Copies of the texts are not part of the record, and Applicant said he did not
retain  copies  of  the  texts.  (Tr.  87)  He  said  he  sent  the  texts  to  show  he  was  being
reasonable and holding his cool. (Tr. 87)
A warrant for his arrest was issued; however, Applicant said he was unaware a
warrant had been issued until after he had already started his trip to another country. (Tr.
24, 60, 62) The September 10, 2020 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal
subject interview (PSI) states Applicant’s brother told him about the arrest warrant before
he left the jurisdiction where the arrest warrant was issued. (GE 8 at 5) At his hearing, at
first,  he  said  he  bought  his  airline  ticket  with  his  bank  card.  (Tr.  85)  Then  he  said  his
brother’s fiancé bought the ticket online. (Tr. 86) He flew out of the state where he is a
resident four days after the arrest warrant was issued. (Tr. 85) He could have cancelled
his flight and returned to his state of residence. (Tr. 62) At his hearing, he admitted that
he  elected  to  continue  his  trip  after  he  learned  of  the  warrant.  (Tr. 24,  61-62)  He  was
arrested at an airport where he was going to take a connecting flight outside the country.
(Tr. 24, 61-62) He spent 28 days in jail in the state where he was arrested before he was
extradited  back  to  his  residence  state.  (Tr.  64)  He  was  denied  bail  because  he  was
considered a flight risk. (Tr. 64) He denied that he was fleeing to avoid an arrest. (Tr. 24)
He said he was planning to return from the foreign country. (Tr. 63) He did not have a
reservation for a hotel in the foreign country, and he did not have a ticket for a return flight
to the United States. (Tr. 63)
Applicant believed Ms. A went through his wallet while he was in the shower and
had  written  down  his  credit  card  numbers.  (Tr.  22)  Several  weeks  after  the  incident
involving Ms. A, he noticed $400 in charges on one of his accounts, and he believed that
Ms.  A  made  them.  (Tr.  68-69)  He  did  not  tell  the  police  that  he  believed  Ms.  A  had
committed a $400 larceny. (Tr. 68) He did not pay the $400 bill. (Tr. 69) He said Ms. A
lied about her place of employment. (Tr. 88-89)
Credibility
In  1987,  when  Applicant  was  16  or  17  years  old,  he  was  arrested  for  three
allegations  of  second  degree  burglary  based  on  his  breaking  and  entering  into
commercial  establishments  to  steal  appliances  and  televisions.  (Tr.  65;  GE  8  at  6)  In
1988, he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail. (Id.) He served about four years
in jail. (Id.)
In  1998,  Applicant  was  arrested for making a  false  statement,  a felony offense,
when  he  applied for a concealed  carry permit  because  he failed  to disclose  his felony
conviction  in  1988.  (GE  8  at  6)  He  was  subsequently  convicted  of  making  a  false
statement. (Id.) He was sentenced to pay a fine, and he was placed on probation. (Id.)
Section  22  of  Applicant’s  April  12,  2018  SCA  asked  “Have  you  EVER  been
charged with any felony offense?” (GE 1 at 26 (emphasis in original)) Applicant answered,
no, and did not disclose these felony charges. (Id. at 27) He said he did not disclose his
felonies because he thought they did not meet the reporting criteria.  (GE 8 at 6)
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2000 and a master’s
degree in 2005. He has been employed by a federal contractor since November 2020.
He is also self-employed with his own business since August 2017. Except for a period
from May 2015 to August 2017, Applicant has worked for federal contractors since 2008.
He was married in 2004 and divorced in 2009. He does not have children. (Item 3)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2021. In it, he
disclosed he has held a top secret security clearance since 2008. (Item 3)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that in February 2012, Applicant was charged with operating a
vehicle while intoxicated and operating a vehicle with .10 blood alcohol content (BAC) in
State  A.  In  July  2021,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  He
disclosed that in 2012 he was stopped by police after he had drinks at a bar. He could
not recall how many. He was arrested and later went to court and pleaded guilty to the
offense. He said his driver’s license was suspended for some time, but could not recall
for how long. He was required to pay a fine and perform community service. (Items 2, 3,
10)
Applicant disclosed in his SCA that in November 2015 he was arrested for driving
under the influence (DUI) of alcohol in State B. He was at a bar with friends and consumed
between four to five alcoholic beverages. He felt fine to drive. He was stopped by police
and  failed  a  breathalyzer  test.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  DUI.  He  told  the  government
investigator  that  he  was  ordered  to  pay  a  fine,  complete  community  service,  and  his
license  was  suspended for three months. He  admitted SOR  ¶ 1.b that alleged he  was
charged with DUI in November 2015, found guilty and sentenced to five days in jail and
36 months probation. (Items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10)
In February 2017, Applicant was charged with driving when privilege suspended
for prior DUI conviction in State B. In May 2017, a bench warrant was issued against him
for this offense. It remains active as of the close of the record. (Items 8, 9)
In March 2017, an arrest warrant was issued from  State B where Applicant was
convicted of DUI in 2015, for failing to comply with the probation conditions. The warrant
remains active as of the close of the record. (Items 8, 9)
In December 2017, Applicant was charged in State C with leaving the scene of a
crash and driving while license revoked due to DUI. It appears he had a plea agreement
and  pleaded  guilty  or  no  contest  to  the  revocation  offense  and  received  a  30-day  jail
sentence, which was suspended, and a fine. (Item 4)
Applicant told the government investigator that in April 2019 he was at a friend’s
house and consumed between four and five alcoholic beverages. He was driving home
when he was in a one-car accident. According to the police report, Applicant was trapped
in the vehicle and the roof had to be cut off by the fire department to extricate him from it.
He was observed by the fireman on scene to be highly intoxicated. A check by the police
revealed Applicant’s license had been revoked for a previous DUI. The effective dates of
the revocation was from July 2016 to July 2019. Applicant refused consent to submit to a
blood test. The police obtained  a search  warrant  for Applicant’s  blood test results.  His
blood  alcohol  level  at  the  time  of  the  accident  was  .204%.  The  court  records  reflect
Applicant was charged with DUI in State C, driving while license revoked, and failure to
have insurance. He was convicted of the offenses. He received 2 days’ home confinement
for the DUI (one day suspended), 30 days’ home confinement for driving with a revoked
license, and fines for all three offenses. (Items 5, 10)
Applicant  told  the  government  investigator  that  he  does  not  believe  he  has  a
problem with alcohol. For his 2015 and 2019 DUI convictions, he was required to attend
court-ordered alcohol awareness classes. He said he no longer drinks and drives. He is
a social drinker and goes out about once a month or two months. He will consume two to
three alcoholic beverages and will not drive. He has no intention of drinking and driving
in the future. He said he will not drive even if he consumes one drink. (Item 10)
Applicant  disclosed  in his  SCA  that  from  January 2017  to  March  2017  he  used
cocaine  three  or  four  times  while  at  parties.  He  was  not  working  as  a  government
contractor  at  the  time.  He  told  the  government  investigator  that  he  stopped  using  it
because he did not like it and he did not intend to use it or any other illegal drug in the
future. (Items 3, 10)
SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.j  alleged  delinquent  medical  accounts,  credit  cards,
communication  services,  utilities,  and  other  consumer  accounts  totaling  approximately
$35,249.  Applicant  admitted  them  all  in  his  SOR  answer.  He  told  the  government
investigator that he had some financial problems during the COVID pandemic when he
did not have enough work and fell behind on his bills. When the investigator confronted
him with his delinquent accounts he said he was unaware the accounts were delinquent,
and he would look into them and resolve them. These collection accounts are reported in
Applicant’s June 2021 and February 2022 credit bureau reports. Applicant did not provide
any  information  about  actions  he  may  have  taken  to  pay,  dispute,  or  resolve  these
accounts. (Items 2, 6, 7 10)
",True
"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a.  He  denied  SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.g  and  3.a,  all  with
explanations. His admission to SOR ¶ 1.a is incorporated into the findings of fact. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  32  years  old.  He  and  his  wife  married  in  2014.  They  separated  in
June  2016.  They  have  one  child,  a  seven-year-old  boy,  who  lives  with  his  mother  in
another state. Applicant graduated from high school in 2009. In 2010, he enlisted in the
Army, serving on active duty for about six years followed by two years in the Reserve.
He  served  in  the  signal  corps  and  held  a  clearance.  He  was  discharged  honorably  in
2018  as  a  specialist  (E-4).  He  works  as  a  video  technician  for  a  contractor  on  a  U.S.
military base. He has worked there since leaving the Army in 2016. (Tr. 24, 41-45, 83;
GE 1)
Applicant’s  son   was  born   in  December   2015.  Applicant  testified   that  he   had   to
take  his son  to  the  hospital emergency room  several times. The  first ER visit was after
the  boy  was  spitting   up   blood.  The  doctor  diagnosed   him   with   having   GERD
(gastroesophageal reflux disease).  A  second  ER visit  was similar. A  third time  was after
the  baby would not eat. Applicant said an  examination  of the  baby found “brain injuries,”
so  the  police  became  involved,  and  the  child  was  placed  in foster care.  (Tr. 47-48, 87-
88)
In his background interview, Applicant discussed the three incidents: once when
his  son  was  injured  after  falling  off  a  love  seat,  an  occasion  when  both  parents  were
present. A second incident occurred when Applicant discovered his son had vomited in
bed;  and  the  third  incident  occurred  when  his  son  fell  out  of  a  swing  seat,  where
Applicant had placed him while Applicant was taking a shower. After the third incident,
doctors  diagnosed  the  boy  with  broken  ribs,  bleeding  in  the  brain,  and  blood  in  his
retina. The boy remained in the hospital’s custody until he was placed in foster care. (Tr.
86-88; GE 2 at 9)
The Government’s documents reflect that Applicant was indicted by a grand jury
and charged with felony child abuse with the offense date between December 29, 2015,
and May 28, 2016. In August 2016, Applicant was arrested in state 1 and charged with
felony child abuse. (GE 3) The Government’s documents also include a motion filed by
the state prosecutor seeking to exclude from evidence at trial a finding by social workers
of  the  county  department  of  social  services  (DSS)  that,  while  allegations  for  both
parents  were  unfounded,  abuse  of  the  child  was  concluded  to  have  occurred,  “by  an
unknown abuser.” (GE 3 at 20) The DSS report itself is not in evidence here.
In   July   2018,   Applicant   pled   no   contest  to   a   reduced   charge   of  misdemeanor
trespassing.  He  was  sentenced   to   a   maximum   of  12   months  in  jail   and   a   $2,500   fine,
with   imposition   of  the   sentence   suspended   for  two   years  (“two-year   SIS”)  on   the
condition  of general good behavior. He  was  not allowed  unsupervised  contact with  the
victim   for  two   years.  The  case   was  dismissed   on   July  10,   2020,   following   Applicant’s
successful  completion   of  the good  behavior period.   (SOR  ¶  1.a)   (GE   3;   Tr.  48-50,   95-
96, 98)  (The  portion of  SOR ¶  1.a  alleging  that Applicant was  “sentenced  to  two  years
suspended   …”   is  erroneous).  The   record  does  not  contain   a   police   report  or  any
evidence   from  law  enforcement   about  the   circumstances   that  led   to   the   indictment
beyond  what Applicant reported in  his background  interview and testimony.
Applicant maintains that he was not at fault and did not cause his son’s injuries.
He does not believe his wife caused them either,  except perhaps when the son fell off
the love seat. Applicant does not believe his wife did anything intentionally to harm him.
He denied any anger management issues at the time, or financial problems, or getting
physically  violent  with  his  wife  or  child.  He  did  acknowledge  some neglect.  He  denied
any subsequent incidents involving violence or anger management. (Tr. 88-94) He has
not been involved in any subsequent criminal offenses. (Tr. 100)
Applicant  took  anger  management  classes  and  10  weeks  of  parenting  classes,
which  were  mandatory  to  resume  custody.  He  and  the  boy’s  mother  also  saw  a  child
psychologist,  and  Applicant  and  his  son  also  attended  without  her.  (Tr.  93,  96-100)
Applicant explained in his background interview that he once foster care ended, his son
was placed in the care of the boy’s mother. (GE 2 at 11)
The boy lives in another state with his mother. They moved there in July 2020.
Applicant said he last saw his son in November 2022, a few weeks before the hearing,
when he was visiting with Applicant’s parents. Before then, he saw the boy in July 2022
when Applicant flew down to see his son and he took him to an amusement park out of
state,  with  the  mother’s  permission.  He  is  not  subject  to  any  visitation  orders  from  a
court. (Tr. 50-52)
The  financial  security  concerns  in  the  SOR  relate  to  delinquent  child  support,
past-due federal income taxes and other delinquent debts, and unfiled federal and state
income  tax  returns.  He  denied  all  the  Guideline  F  allegations  in  his  answer,  asserting
that his debts either had been, or were being, paid, and that his overdue tax returns had
been  filed.  The  debts  are  established  by  credit  reports  from  November  2018,  August
2019, and February 2022. (GE 6, 7, 8)
Applicant  explained  in  his  interview  that  his  debts  accrued  for  several  reasons,
among them a drop in pay after he left the Army, renting a large apartment, paying child
support costs while their son was in foster care, and child support to the boy’s mother
after she assumed custody. (GE 2 at 11)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($5,577) is a child support arrearage, as of August 2019. (GE 6, GE 7)
Applicant asserted that the account has been paid in full. A February 2022 credit report
shows  no  balance  and  that  the  account  is  in  “pays  as  agreed”  status.”  (GE  5)  The
arrearage  accrued  during  the  period  his  son  was  in  foster  care,  and  Applicant  was
responsible for providing financial support to the state for his son. (Tr. 80) He pays $350
in child support every two weeks, directly to the boy’s mother on a voluntary basis. (Tr.
53, 79) The arrearage is resolved and his child support payments are current.
SOR ¶ 1.b ($2,458) is an account placed for collection by a military retailer. (GE
6, GE 7) Applicant asserted in his answer that the balance is $432 and he is paying $88
every two weeks. A February 2022 credit report shows a balance of $370. (GE 5) The
account is now closed and paid in full. (Tr. 81; AE A at 10)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  ($1,452)  and  1.d  ($830)  are  cell  phone  accounts  placed  for
collection. (GE 7 at 8) Applicant said they are paid in full. (Answer. Tr. 81-82) He was
unable  to  provide  documentation  but  noted  in  a  post-hearing  e-mail  that  they  are  no
longer listed on his credit report. (AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal and state 1 income tax
returns  for  TY  2017  and  2018.  He  filed  his  TY  2017  federal  and  state  returns  in  June
2020, when he filed his TY 2019 federal and state returns. (AE J, AE K) He used a well-
known tax preparation software program. In 2018, he could not afford the filing fee, so
he  decided  to mail  the returns, which he  then  neglected  to  do.  (Tr. 57) In  2019,  when
the  software  program  reminded  him  that  his  prior  tax  returns  were  still  unfiled,  he
contacted  his  parents’  tax  accountant  for  assistance.  She  helped  him  prepare  and  file
his late returns, and he has “been up to date ever since.” (Tr. 56-58)
SOR  ¶   1.f   ($4,500)  concerns   past-due   federal   income  taxes  for  TY   2017.
Applicant  said   he   had   a   $9,408   balance   due   for  TY   2017   and   about   $595   due   for  TY
2018   and   was  in   a   150-month   repayment  plan.   (GE   2)   He   said   he   entered   into   the
payment  plan  with  the  IRS  in  September 2020  and  has  been  making  regular payments
since  then. (Tr. 59, 67,  85) As of the  hearing  date, he  owed  $6,523  on  his 2017  federal
taxes and  $632  for TY  2018, for a  total of $7,155  remaining.  (AE  B;  AE  H, AE  I; Tr. 58-
59)
SOR ¶ 1.g ($3,803) concerns past due federal income taxes for TY 2016. (GE 2,
GE 4) As of January 2021, he owed $1,947 in taxes, penalties, and interest. (AE F) As
of December 2022, the debt has been paid. (AE G)
Applicant filed his TY 2020 federal and state tax returns on May 15, 2021 (a date
I  consider  timely  during  the  COVID  pandemic).  He  was  to  receive  a  federal  refund  of
$1,828, and he owed $73 in state taxes. (AE M) He filed his TY 2021 federal and state
tax returns on April 3, 2022. He was to receive a federal refund of $1,889, and he owed
$54 in state taxes. (AE N) He is up to date on his tax filings, and he owes no past-due
state taxes. (Tr. 56, 59-60, 77)
Applicant  participated  in  credit  counseling  in  the  Army  but  not  since  then.  He
keeps a budget to track income and expenses. (Tr. 101-202) A November 2022 credit
report shows no  delinquencies.  (AE  A) A  mid-December 2022  pay  stub  reflects  a year-
to-date   2022   income   of  about  $82,300.  (AE   E)   Applicant’s  current   annual   salary  is
$82,000.  He  also  receives  about  $6,000   from   the   VA   due   to   his  disability   for  a   total
income  of  about $88,000. (Tr. 82)
A January 2022 disability rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) reflects a 30% disability  rating for degenerative arthritis  (20%) and tinnitus (10%)
(AE D) Applicant earns about $4,800 per month, after taxes, including his disability pay.
He said he has about $800 or $900 left over each month. He drives a 10-year-old car.
(Tr. 83-84)
Applicant disclosed several delinquent debts on his SCA, including past-due child
support. In the comments sections, he noted that he “attempted to enter the information
about delinquent payments” and that he had “additional debtors owed,” but was unable
to obtain complete court and financial records. (GE 1 at 37, 40) He also disclosed that
he  was  arrested  on  suspicion  of  felony  neglect/abuse  and  that  the  charges  were
lowered to misdemeanor trespassing, to be dismissed in July 2020. (GE 1 at 31)
In  SOR  ¶  3.a,  as  amended,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately
failed  to  disclose, on his August  2018 SCA, that he  owed  past-due  taxes for TY  2016
and TY 2017, in answer to the following question:
Section   26   –   Financial   Record:   Taxes   In   the   past   seven   (7)  years,   have
you  failed  to  file or pay  Federal, state, or other taxes when  required by law
or ordinance.”  (GE 1  at 37)
Applicant filed his 2016 federal tax return on time, on or about April 15, 2017. A
2020  IRS  account  transcript  in  the  record  shows  he  had  past-due  tax  debt  from  that
year (as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g). (GE 4)
As  previously  noted,  Applicant  did  not  file  his  2017  federal  or  state  income  tax
returns  until  June  2020,  and  he  still  owes  past-due  federal  taxes  for  that  year  (as
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f). However, the IRS account transcript for TY 2017 (AE H) shows
that he filed an extension on April 15, 2018. That pushed the filing deadline to October
15,  2018  –  a  date  after  Applicant  prepared  his  SCA  in  August  2018.  Thus,  when  he
prepared  his  SCA,  his  2017  federal  return  was  not  yet  late  (though  it  would  be  later
when he did  not meet the October 2018  deadline).  (AE  H;  Tr. 71-73) It also  stands  to
reason that  it  was not yet established as of August  2018  that he owed  taxes  for 2017
(though he later did).
In answering the original SOR ¶ 3.a, Applicant denied the allegation of deliberate
falsification.  He  said  he  filed  (prepared)  his  2017  tax  return  through  the  software
program  but  had  a  dispute  with  his  son’s  mother  about  claiming  their  son  as  a
dependent. He then did not follow up and complete the filing (until 2020, as discussed).
(Answer)
During his hearing testimony, Applicant explained that he was paying on his past-
due  2016  taxes  when he  prepared  his SCA,  which  he  believed  meant  that  he  was  no
longer “in arrears” and did not have to disclose the debt. He also said he thought he had
filed his 2017 tax return through the software program, but only learned later such was
not  the  case.  He  said he  did not intend  to  mislead  the  government when  he  prepared
his SCA.  (Tr. 61-65, 106-107) Applicant also acknowledged  that he  should have been
more diligent in filling out the SCA. (Tr. 64-65, 109)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from
high school in June 2013 and worked at various jobs in the private sector until December
2019. He was unemployed from December 2019 to February 2020, when he was hired
for his current job. He was trained as a welder but is working as an electrician. (Tr. 13.)
He has never held a security clearance. He has never married and has no children.
In November 2011, while Applicant was in high school, he and two other juveniles
were apprehended for shoplifting packages of cold medicine from a Navy Exchange store.
They were issued “no trespass” orders and released to their parents. (GX 6.) This incident
was not alleged in the SOR.
In January 2017, Applicant was driving without insurance, a misdemeanor. He was
fined $100 plus court costs. (GX 3 at 9.) This incident is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g.
In  April  and  May  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  with  a  revoked  or
suspended driver’s license, a misdemeanor, on two occasions. The offenses were within
two  days  of  each  other  but  in  different  locations.  For  each  offense,  he  was  fined  and
assessed court costs. (GX 3 at 7-8.) These offenses are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f.
In  July 2017, Applicant  was charged with failure  to appear, a misdemeanor. He
was convicted and fined. (GX 3 at 6.) This offense is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d.
In  the  summer of  2017,  Applicant was  charged  with stealing a  basketball pump
from a Navy Exchange store, convicted, and sentenced to 24 hours of community service.
In  July 2017, he was barred  from the  Navy  base  where the theft occurred.  In  January
2021, he wrote a letter to the base commander, asking that the bar be lifted so that he
could work on the base. The base commander granted his request and lifted the bar. (AX
D.) This incident is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, but the date is incorrectly alleged in the SOR as
2018 instead of 2017.
In March 2018, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana and driving
without a license. In October 2018, he was convicted of both offenses. For the marijuana
offense,  he  was  sentenced  to  12  days  in  jail  (suspended),  placed  on  unsupervised
probation for 36 months, and fined $250 plus court costs. For driving without a license,
he was sentenced to 60 days in jail (with 50 days suspended) and fined $250. (GX 3 at
3; GX 4.) These offenses are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c.
At the hearing, Applicant testified that the marijuana incident happened because a
friend had left a small quantity of marijuana in his car and that he was unaware of it until
he  was stopped by  the  police. When  asked by  Department Counsel when  he had last
used marijuana, he admitted that he used it about four months before the hearing. (Tr.
27.) He characterized this use as a “one time thing,” in which he went to a party and “got
influenced” to use it. (Tr. 3.) This recent use of marijuana is not alleged in the SOR.
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not paid the fines and court costs for
the convictions alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. (GX 3 at 5.) He paid the fines and costs
totaling $1,596 on January 23, 2023, five days after the hearing. On January 24, 2023,
he  paid  $82  in  court  costs,  fines,  and  interest.  His  documents  do  not  identify  which
offenses were the basis of these fines and court costs. (AX E.)
After the hearing, Applicant’s program manager submitted a letter attesting to his
hard work, excellent performance, and good conduct. (AX A.)

"Applicant is a 34-year-old new employee of a defense contractor. His start date
was  scheduled  to be  in  January 2023. He  worked for a different  defense  contractor in
2022. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2012  until he was discharged
with an under other than honorable conditions discharge in 2021. He seeks to retain a
security clearance, which he has held since his time in the military. He has a bachelor’s
degree  earned  in  2010,  and  he  has  taken  graduate  courses  in  pursuit  of  a  master’s

Applicant deployed to Afghanistan for about nine months in 2016 through 2017.
He  was  stationed  in  a  foreign  country  from  2017  until  his  discharge.  From  that  duty
station, he deployed to another foreign country in 2018. The multiple deployments and
overseas tour led to marital stress. In January to February 2019, he was on temporary
duty  at  a  military  installation  in  State  A  in  the  United  States.  While  there,  he  met  an
individual  online  who  identified  “herself”  on  multiple  occasions  as  a  13-year-old  girl.  It
was  actually  a  police  officer  from  State  A  running  a  sting  operation  to  catch  potential
child predators. (I will refer to the individual with feminine pronouns even though it was
actually  a  male.)  Applicant  and  the  individual  engaged  in  a  series  of  graphic  sexual
messages. (Tr. at 27-33, 38-40, 55-57, 60-62, 68-70; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1, 5; AE A, H)
Applicant  returned  to  his  foreign  duty  station.  He  continued  to  have  graphic
sexual  communications  with  the  individual  who  identified  herself  as  a  13-year-old  girl.
He  sent  a  video  of  himself  masturbating  and  two  photographs  of  his  penis.  He
requested that she send him sexually explicit images of herself, which, if she was truly
an  underage  girl,  would  have  been  child  pornography  under  18  U.S.C.  §§  2252  and
2256. He stated that he wanted to perform sexual acts on her, and he planned to travel
to State A to do so. (Tr. at 39-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5; AE H)
A  military  criminal  investigation  was  initiated  in  April  2019  based  upon  a  report
from  State  A  law  enforcement.  Applicant  waived  his  right  to  remain  silent  and  was
interviewed. He admitted that he exchanged sexual messages with a female who lived
in State A, and that he was aware that she was 13 to 15 years old. He explained that he
did not believe everything on the Internet, “nothing’s real,” and that it would be weird for
a 13-year-old to be on the Internet actively participating in their interactions like she did.
He  admitted  that  they discussed  things  that  he  would  like  to  do  to  her,  but  he  had  no
intention of actually doing anything. He also admitted that he sent her a video of himself
in which he was naked. (Tr. at 45; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5; AE H)
A forensic examination was conducted of Applicant’s cell phone. It was reported
that  “[a]n  image  of  suspected  child  pornography  was  located,  but  appeared  to  be
associated  with  malicious  software,  as  no  additional  indications  were  found  [that]  the
user intentionally searched for, or possessed child pornography.” (GE 5; AE F)
Applicant  was  charged  in  November  2020  with  multiple  offenses  under  the
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), including three specifications of attempting to
commit  lewd  acts  on  a  child  under  the  age  of  16;  soliciting  the  detective  to  send  him
images  of  child  pornography;  and  possessing  child  pornography.  The  charges  were
referred to a general court-martial in February 2021. (Tr. at 43; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 5; AE F)
Applicant requested an under other than honorable conditions discharge in lieu of
trial by  court-martial.  In  his request,  he  admitted  that  he  was  “guilty  of  one  or more  of
the specifications against [him] or of a lesser-included offense contained therein which
also  authorizes  the  imposition  of  a  bad  conduct  discharge  or dishonorable discharge.”
The request was approved, and he was discharged in April 2021. (Tr. at 48-49, 66-67;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5)
Applicant responded to interrogatories in February 2022. He answered  “True” to
the  following  statement,  “Between  February  and  April  2019  you  admitted  you
exchanged messages, photos and a video (all sexual in nature) with an individual whom
you believed to be a female between the age of 13 and 15 years old residing in [State
A].” He added, “All information above is correct. I did exchange photos and video with a
person I thought to be a female.” (GE 5)
Applicant testified that he went on the Internet for adult companionship, and that
he was not looking for an underage girl. He stated that people lie about their age on the
Internet, as he did, and he assumed that the “girl” was lying. He asserted that he had no
intention  of  meeting  her.  He  denied  ever  possessing  child  pornography.  (Tr.  at  37-44,
53, 62, 66-69)
Applicant  expressed  remorse  for his conduct. His wife  is aware  of his  actions, the
charges  against  him, and  his discharge. Many of  his friends  are  aware  of  the  charges.
The  defense  company  that previously  hired  him  and  the  company   for which  he  was to
start  work   in   January  2023   are   unaware   that  he   was   discharged   with   an   under  other
than   honorable   discharge. Applicant   stated   that   he   was   never asked  by his employers
about  his  discharge,  and   he   believes  they   would  have   hired   him   anyway.   He   sought
counseling from a  chaplain  while  he  was  still on active  duty.  He has since had  additional
therapy,  which   is  ongoing.   His  therapist  wrote   that  it   was  evident  that  Applicant  “was
remorseful for the  past  incident and  has  been  making  great effort  to  move  forward  with
improving   his  marriage   and   family  life.”    Applicant   considers   himself  completely
rehabilitated,  and  he  assured  that similar conduct would never recur. (Tr. at 46-47, 49-

Applicant  was  evaluated  at  his  own  expense  in  July  2022  by  a  licensed
psychologist  with  extensive  experience  in  forensic  and  clinical  psychology.  A  report of
the evaluation was issued in August 2022. The psychologist determined that Applicant
did not have a mental health condition. He concluded that Applicant’s “illegal actions are
not, in fact, a sign of moral turpitude or any aberrant sexual impulses.” He accepted that
Applicant  was  not  seeking  an  underage  partner  when  he  entered  the  chat  room,  and
that Applicant presumed the person was lying about her age. (Tr. at 71-86; AE J, K) The
psychologist concluded:
[Applicant’s]  encounter  with  this purported  young  teenager was impulsive,
rather than  planned.  [Applicant]  has since  experienced  the  consequences
of  his  behavior.  To   a   great   degree   of   psychological   certainty,   I  have
concluded   that  [Applicant]   is rehabilitated   and   will   never again  engage   in
such   foolish   behavior.  [Applicant’s]   behavior  was  not   part  of  any
compulsion.   There  is  no   known  reason   to   expect   that  such   behavior  is
something   that  [Applicant]   is  motivated   to   repeat  or  has  any  particular
interest in doing.
In   sum,  I  have   concluded   that  [Applicant]   has  learned   from   his  mistake,
has  benefitted   from   the   consequences   he   experienced   and   from   the
psychotherapy  that   he   received,   and   that   this  behavior   will   not  recur.   I
consider  [Applicant]   to   have   been   rehabilitated   and   to   be   currently  fit  to

On an unspecified date, Applicant paid another individual to pose as Applicant to
take  an  information  technology  certification  exam  on  his  behalf  because  he  did  not
believe that he could pass it if he took the certification exam himself. The individual that
Applicant hired passed the certification exam, and Applicant was awarded the Security+
through COMPTIA certification as a result of his dishonest actions. This certification was
either  required  for  Applicant’s  employment  or  would  enhance  his  standing  with  his

denied striking him, claiming that she merely knocked his breakfast on the floor. Military
police  responded  to  the  incident.  They  noted  bruising  on  Applicant’s  ex-spouse’s  arm
consistent with her version of events. Applicant claimed that his ex-spouse slipped on a
shoe and fell into a dresser. Military police also noted scratches on Applicant’s arm. He
claimed that his ex-spouse called military police because she thought she would get in
trouble  for  striking  him.  Applicant  was  arrested  by  military  police  but  not  formally
charged. While he was being questioned by military police, he  alleged that he and his
ex-spouse had not had domestic abuse issues in the past. However, he acknowledged
to a social worker during counseling that he and his ex-spouse had similar incidents in
2013  and  February  2017.  He  claimed  that  these  incidents  involved  his  ex-spouse
assaulting  him.  Regardless,  this  information  is  inconsistent  with  what  he  told  military
police  about  the  September  2017  incident  being  the  first.  In  October  2017,  the  Army
Family  Advocacy  Program  Case  Review  Committee  determined  that  Applicant’s  ex-
spouse qualified as a victim of physical abuse based upon this incident. In March 2019,
the  Army  authorized  payments  to  Applicant’s  ex-spouse  under  a  federal  law  that
provides  for  compensation  to  family  members  who  have  been  physically  abused  by
Army  servicemembers.  These  findings  tend  to  corroborate  his  ex-spouse’s  version  of
events. In 2019, Applicant and his (ex) spouse were divorced. (Items 2-5, 7-11)
Applicant underwent outpatient mental health counseling in parts of 2012, 2015,
2016, and from March 2017 until November 2017, while he was in the military. Applicant
attended ASAP for approximately three months and a licensed psychologist diagnosed
him with an alcohol use disorder-mild. While Applicant was initially told to abstain from
alcohol, his treatment records acknowledged that he could eventually consume alcohol
again  in  a  modified,  lower  risk  manner.  Applicant  abstained  from  alcohol  from
approximately July 2017 until the end of December 2019, when he began drinking about
two  glasses  of  wine  two  times  per  week.  The  last  time  he  was  intoxicated  was  July
2017. He acknowledged formerly having  a problem with alcohol. However, he claimed
that he now drinks responsibly and no longer has alcohol-related issues. (Items 2-5, 7)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  is  remorseful  for  the  conduct  listed  in  the  SOR.
However,  he  reiterated  his  claim  that  he  did  not  physically  assault  his  ex-spouse.  He
claimed  that  he  is  trying  to  better  himself  through  his  college  education  and  making
better decisions.  He twice made the dean’s list at his college. He also claimed that he
has  learned  from  his  mistakes  and  that  the  birth  of  his  one-year-old  child  has
contributed to his desire to be a better person. He provided character reference letters
from  those  who  know  him  who  claim  that  he  is  trustworthy,  responsible,  dedicated,
shows integrity, and is hard working. Some of the individuals who wrote letters note that
he has learned from his mistakes, but it is unclear whether any of these individuals are
aware of the allegations in the SOR. (Item 2; Response to FORM)

"Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  November  2017.  He  received  a  high  school  diploma  in  1995.  He  was
married in 2002 and divorced in 2009. He remarried in 2010, but he separated from his
second  wife  in  2015.  He  has  two  children,  ages  19  and  16.  He  served  on  active  duty
with the U.S. Air Force from 1997 to 2003 and received an honorable discharge but was
separated for an alcohol-treatment failure. (Items 2, 3)
In  the  SOR,  under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  eight
delinquent debts totaling about $78,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h). The largest of these
debts  was  a  $66,000  child  support  delinquency  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  The  Government
also alleged that he misused his corporate credit card from September 2015 until March
2016  (SOR  ¶  1.i)  Finally,  it  alleged  that  in  July  2005,  he  filed  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy
petition that was discharged in November 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.j). In his response to the SOR,
Applicant admitted these allegations except for SOR ¶ 1.b, which he denied. He claimed
that he brought this account current in 2016 or 2017. The Guideline F SOR allegations
Including  SOR  ¶  1.b,  are  established  through  Applicant’s  admissions  and  the  credit
reports produced by the Government. (Items 3, 7-11)
Applicant provided no evidence concerning the resolution or attempted resolution
of the SOR debts, except for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. He claimed that he resolved
the child support delinquency in  SOR ¶ 1.b by bringing the account  current in 2016 or
2017, but he provided no documents to corroborate this claim. The Government’s 2018,
2019,  2021,  and  2022  credit  reports  reflect  this  account  as  an  account  in  collections.
The 2022 credit report reflects a balance that is higher than that listed in the SOR. Any
adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as the increased balance associated
with the debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.b cannot be used for disqualification purposes, however
it may be considered in assessing an applicant’s credibility; in evaluating an applicant’s
evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed  circumstances; in considering whether
the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  and  in  applying  the  whole-
person  concept.  (ISCR  Case  No.  15-07369  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Aug.  16,  2017)).  He  has
neither  resolved,  nor  is  he  in  the  process  of  resolving,  any  of  the  SOR  debts.  He
presented  no  evidence  to  show  he  has  participated  in  financial  counseling  or  has  a
working budget. He did not present evidence of his current financial situation. (Items 1,
3, 8-11)
Applicant  failed  to  report  any  financial  delinquencies  on  the  Questionnaire  for
National Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in  January 2018. He was required to
report  the  delinquency  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b.  During  his  November  2018  security
interview, he did not disclose this financial delinquency until the investigator confronted
him with it. He denied that he deliberately failed to disclose the delinquent debt in SOR
¶  1.b  because  he  believed  that  the  debt  was  not  delinquent  and  he  therefore  did  not
need to disclose it. While he did not disclose other delinquent debts on the SF 86 that
he should have, he did disclose the derogatory financial issue listed in SOR ¶ 1.i. (Items
1, 3)
From  about  September  2015  until  about  March  2016,  Applicant  misused  his
employer-issued  credit  card  by  charging  about  $2,500  to  it  for  personal  housing
expenses.  He  claimed  that  he  needed  the  money  because  of  his  separation  from  his
spouse.  He  claimed  that  he  promptly  paid  the  money  back  through  a  loan  from  his
retirement account. He claimed his employer did not discipline him for this misuse. He
provided no documentary evidence related to this incident. (Items 1-3)
Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2005. The bankruptcy court
granted  him  a  Chapter  7  discharge  in  November  2005.  There  is  no  evidence  in  the
record  as  to  the  reason  he  filed  bankruptcy  or  the  amount  of  the  debt  that  was
discharged. (Item 7)
Applicant attributed his financial problems to his 2015 separation from his spouse
and  the  financial  burden  of  his  child  support  payments.  He  claimed  that  he  is  paying
about $3,500 per month for child support, which is more than he earns. He claimed that
he is trying to have his ex-wife agree to a lower amount. He provided no documentary
evidence of the amount of his monthly obligation, how much he earns per month, or any
efforts to resolve the issue. (Items 1-3, 8-11)
Applicant’s  estranged  spouse  alleged  that  in  about  November  2015,  Applicant
threatened to harm her repeatedly over the telephone. She alleged that he hacked her
e-mail account and sent sexually explicit photographs of her to her work colleagues and
her lawyer. She also alleged that he posted sexually explicit photographs of her online.
She  alleged  that  she  feared  for  her  safety  because  of  Applicant’s  actions  and
statements towards her.  In  December 2015,  based upon these allegations,  she  filed a
petition  for  injunction  for  protection  against  domestic  violence  against  Applicant.  On
February 24, 2016, a court awarded his estranged spouse a final judgment of injunction
for  protection  against  domestic  violence  (“protection  order”  or  “PO”)  against  Applicant.
Applicant was provided notice and an opportunity to be heard at the hearing, but he did
not  attend.  The  court  found  that  Applicant’s  estranged  spouse  had  been  a  victim  of
domestic violence or that she had reasonable cause to believe that she was in imminent
danger of becoming a victim of domestic violence by Applicant.  In his response to the
SOR,  Applicant  admitted  sending  an  unspecified  “e-mail,”  but  denied  improperly
accessing her e-mail account because they both had access to one another’s accounts.
He also denied sending sexually explicit photographs of his estranged wife. (Items 1, 5)
In about June 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery against his
then-girlfriend  (now  estranged  spouse).  He  was  found  guilty,  sentenced  to  a  month  in
jail,  placed  on  probation  for  a  year,  and  was  ordered  to  attend  anger  management
courses.  He  claimed  that  he  has  fulfilled  all  the  requirements  of  his  conviction.  The
arrest and conviction resulted from him throwing a beer can at the victim that hit her in
the face. He also pushed her out of a chair. He had been drinking alcohol at the time.
Immediately  following  this  incident,  she  agreed  to  allow  him  to  drive  her  to  a  hotel.
However, while she was in the car, she became fearful of him again and jumped out of
the car while it was at a stoplight. At a minimum, he committed the crime of battery and
engaged in domestic violence while he was consuming alcohol. (Items 1, 3, 4, 6)
In August 2010, Applicant was charged with driving with a suspended license. He
believed that his license was suspended for his failure to pay child support obligations.
He was found guilty of this charge. He admitted to the conduct but claimed that he did
not  realize  that  his  license  was  suspended.  In  March  2011  he  was  charged  with
violating the terms of his probation because of driving on a suspended license. He was
found  guilty  of  violating  the  terms  of  his  probation.  In  December  2011,  he  was  again
charged with driving on a suspended license. (Items 1, 3, 4, 6)
In  November  2010,  Applicant  was  charged  with  violating  the  terms  of  his
probation  when  he  tested  positive  for  methamphetamine  after  taking  a  court-ordered
drug  test.  He  claimed  that  he  tested  positive  because  he  took  some  of  his  wife’s
prescription  Adderall.  He  did  not  have  a  prescription  for  Adderall  when  he  tested
positive. He was found guilty of violating the terms of his probation. (Items 1, 3, 6)
In  about  September  2007,  Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  driving
under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  The  charges  were  ultimately  dismissed  after
Applicant  paid  fines  and  attended  court-ordered  alcohol  treatment  classes.  I  consider
his  payment  of  fines  and  attendance  of  treatment  classes  as  an  admission  of  the
underlying criminal conduct. (Items 1, 3, 6)
In about January 2004, Applicant was driving with an open container of alcohol in
his car. He was charged with a moving violation and pleaded guilty. He was required to
pay fines and he did so. (Items 1, 3)
Between  about  June  and  July  2002,  Applicant  attended  command-directed
alcohol  counseling  and  treatment  while  he  was  in  the  military.  These  counseling
sessions  were  about  eight  hours  daily  and  lasted  about  four  weeks.  During  this
treatment and counseling, he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Despite this treatment,
he  was  administratively  separated  from  the  Air  Force  in  February  2003  for  alcohol
rehabilitation failure. (Items 1, 3)
In about May 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery against his
first wife. He pleaded no contest and was placed on probation and required to pay fines.
He  was  also  required  to  complete  an  anger  management  course.  He  and  his  ex-wife
engaged in a physical confrontation when both had been consuming alcohol. Applicant
has fulfilled all the requirements that resulted from his pleading no contest. (Items 1, 3,
5, 6)
In  about  April  2000,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  disturbing  the
peace  outside  of  a  restaurant.  He  was  making  threats  and  appeared  to  be  under  the
influence  of  alcohol.  He  pleaded  no  contest  and  paid  required  fines.  As  part  of  his
sentence, he was ordered not to return to the restaurant. (Items 1, 4, 6)
Applicant drinks beer about one to two times per week. He claimed that he drinks
about one to two beers when he drinks. He claimed that he does not drink to the point of
intoxication,  but  he  also  reported  that  he  was  last  intoxicated  on  December  31,  2021.
He intends to continue to drink beer at his current level of consumption. He claimed that
he does not have a problem with alcohol and that his drinking does not have any effect
on his work, home life, friendships, judgment, or physical or emotional well-being. (Item

Under  Guideline  J,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  arrests  and  underlying
conduct,  the entry  of  the  PO  and  underlying conduct, and his probation  violations  and
underlying  conduct  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a  through  2.g).  Under  Guideline  G,  the  Government
alleged  Applicant’s  2002  alcohol  counseling,  his  “alcohol  abuse”  diagnosis,  his
separation  from  the  military  for  alcohol  rehabilitation  failure,  and  his  2004  citation  for
driving  with  an  open  alcohol  container  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.c).  It  also  cross-alleged
his 2002 arrest for battery, his 2007 arrest for DUI, and his 2010 arrest for battery, along
with  the  underlying  conduct  (SOR  ¶  3.d).  Under  Guideline  E,  the  Government  alleged
that  Applicant  falsified  his  SF  86  because  he  failed  to  list  his  delinquent  child-support
account in it (SOR ¶ 4.a). It also cross-alleged the delinquent child-support account, his
misuse of his employer-issued credit card, his arrests (and the underlying conduct), his
probation  violations  (and  the  underlying  conduct),  the  entry  of  the  PO  (and  the
underlying conduct), and it cross-alleged SOR ¶¶ 3.a through 3.c (SOR ¶ 4.b). (Item 1)

"In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  allegations  contained  in  the  SOR  with
clarifications.  His  admissions  and  explanations  are  incorporated  into  these  findings  of
fact.
Applicant is 34 years old and not married. He earned a high school diploma in May
2006.  In  April  2020,  he  started  a  position  with  a  defense  contractor.  In  May  2020,  he
submitted his first security clearance application (SCA). Prior to this position, he worked
for non-government employers and was unemployed at times. (Item 3)
In his SCA, Applicant disclosed a history of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct,
which is set forth below:
1.a:  In August 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the
Influence of Alcohol or Drugs (DUI), a misdemeanor. He was 20 years old. In September
2008, he was convicted and sentenced to one year of probation and ordered to pay a fine
and attend a diversion class. (Item 2)
1.b: In April 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with Minor in Possession
of  Alcohol,  a  misdemeanor.  He  was  convicted  and  ordered  to  pay  a  fine.  His  driver’s
license was suspended for 30 days. (Item 2)
1.c: In August 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and Refusal to
Submit to a Preliminary Breath Test, both misdemeanors. He failed to appear in court in
February 2010 and a warrant was issued for his arrest. (Item 2)
In April 2013, Applicant was convicted of DUI. He was sentenced to 12 months of
probation and ordered to pay a fine. He was required to attend and complete an alcohol
and drug treatment program, participate in Alcohol Anonymous (AA) meetings, install an
interlock device, and complete a DUI victim panel class. (Item 2)
In accordance with the terms of the court’s April 2013 order, Applicant participated
in  an  out-patient  alcohol  treatment  program  for  six  months  in  2013.  As  part  of  that
program, he attended AA meetings and group sessions. (Item 4)
1.d: In November 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, Refusal to
Submit to a Preliminary Breath Test, and Failure to Maintain a Single Lane. He was 27
years old. He failed to appear in court in September 2015 and a warrant was issued for
his arrest. (Item 2)
In   April 2018,  Applicant   was  served   with  an   arrest  warrant  and   was   additionally
charged  with  Possession  of Marijuana  and  Use/Possession  with  Intent to  Use.  In  June
2018, he  pleaded  guilty  and  was convicted  of DUI (2nd  conviction) and  Incapable  of Safely
Driving. The  marijuana  possession  charge  was dismissed. He was sentenced  to  five  days
in  jail. (Item  8  at  22, 24)  After serving  his jail time, he  was placed  on  reporting  probation
for 12  months  or until such  time  as  he  completed  all  probationary conditions.  He  was  also
fined  and  required  to  attend  a  DUI victim  panel and  an alcohol  education  class. (Item  8  at
23-25)
1.e:   In  January  2019,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Violate  Driver  License
Restriction, No Valid Driver’s License in Possession, and Speed-30 MPH. He was also
charged with violating the probation that was imposed in June 2018. He denied the driver
license charges. He waived his right to a probation violation hearing and agreed to serve
two  days  in  jail  for that  infraction.  The driver license  charges  were dismissed,  and  the
speeding ticket was reduced to a lesser violation. He pleaded guilty to that violation and
was fined. (Item 2, Item 8 at 28)
1.f:  In April 2019, Applicant was charged with Tampering with an Ignition Interlock
Device.  He  denied  the  charges  but  was  required  to  serve  two  days  in  jail  because  he
violated the terms of his June 2018 probation. In May 2019, the tampering charge was
dismissed  because  at  the  time  of  the  arrest,  he  was  no  longer  required  to  have  an
interlock device.
On  June  27,  2019,  the  court  entered  an  order  releasing  Applicant  from  the
probation that was imposed in June 2018. (Item 8 at 29)
During his June 22, 2020 interview, Applicant stated that he no longer consumes
alcohol and drives. He said he is more mature now and uses ride-sharing services if he
consumes alcohol when he is out. He said alcohol has not interfered with his job, finances,
or relationships. (Item 4 at 9)
In   interrogatories  that   Applicant   signed   in  February  2022,  he   reported   that  an
evaluator  at the  treatment program  he  attended  in  2013,  recommended  that he  abstain
from  alcohol consumption.  He  stated  he  was diagnosed  as  a  “social  drinker.”  (Item  4  at
20) He has not participated  in counseling  or  treatment,  other than  that required  by the
court   and   while  he   was  on   probation   between   2013   and  2014.  He  is not   attending  AA
meetings   or   other  recovery  programs.   (Item   4   at   21)  Applicant   also   disclosed   in   his
interrogatories  that he  continues to  consume  alcohol once  or twice a  week, and  drinks
two  to  five  beers each time.  (Item 4  at 20) In  his August  22,  2022  Answer, he  stated  that
he  has not been stopped  or charged with  an  alcohol-related  offense since  2014. (Item 2)

"Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  she  has
worked  since  March  2021.  She  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  2003  and  has  taken
community  college courses  without earning a  degree. She has never  married and has
no children. (Items 3, 5, 8)
Beginning in about 2001,  Applicant had  upwards of  six knee surgeries  to repair
or  replace  menisci  and  her  anterior  cruciate  ligament  in  her  left  knee.  When  none  of
these  surgeries  proved  successful,  Applicant  had  knee  replacement  surgery  in  about
2011. Despite the knee replacement, she continued to experience pain in her knee. For
several  years,  she  was  legally  taking  the  prescription  opioid  Tramadol  with  a
prescription  for  pain  relief  related  to  her  knee.  However,  in  about  July  2014,  she  quit
before  she  was  fired  from  her  job  with  a  government  agency.  She  lost  her  insurance
and her  prescription for Tramadol lapsed.  She  was  still experiencing  pain  and thought
she  needed  the  Tramadol,  so  she  used  it  illegally,  without  the  requisite  prescription,
from  about  August  2014  until  about  February  2015.  She  claimed  that  she  still  had  a
valid prescription for the Tramadol and merely refilled her prescriptions more often than
her  doctor  authorized.  There  is  no  documentation  to  this  effect  in  the  record.
Regardless,  she  admitted  using  Tramadol  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  her  doctor’s
prescription. From about May 2015 until about the middle of November 2015, a medical
doctor again prescribed her Tramadol for pain relief. She claimed that she continued to
experience pain in her left knee until a surgical repair of a portion of her artificial knee in
about  September  2022.  However,  she  has  not  used  opioids  since  sometime  in  2016.
(Items 2-4; FORM Response)
While Applicant claimed that she did not use opioids for pain management, she
illegally used “medical”  marijuana edibles with varying frequency for pain management
from  about  October  2020  to  the  present.  She  thought  using  medical  marijuana  was  a
better  alternative  to  opioids  for  managing  her  pain.  In  April  2022,  she  obtained  a
certification from a family nurse practitioner for the use of cannabis products in State A
where she resides. She claimed she thought marijuana use was “legal” in State A until
she  had  her security  interview in  May  2021.  Despite  her understanding  of  marijuana’s
illegality,  she  continued  to  use  it  and  obtained  the  certificate  for  the  use  of  cannabis
products  after  her  security  interview.  She  claimed  that,  on  an  unspecified  date,  she
made  her  current  employer  aware  of  her  marijuana  use  and  decided  to  stop  using  it.
There is no evidence in the record to corroborate this claim. Conversely, she has also
claimed that she will stop using marijuana once she obtains a clearance, which implies
that she continues to use it. (Items 2, 3, 4; FORM Response)
From  about  December  2014  until  about  February  2015,  Applicant  fraudulently
obtained prescriptions for Tramadol. She also fraudulently obtained at least 150 doses
is  a  registered  nurse.  Applicant  knew
of  Tramadol.  She  obtained  these  prescriptions  and  dosages  by  calling  pharmacies
posing  as  an  acquaintance  who
the
acquaintance’s  “NPI”  number  and  used  it  during  her  phone  calls  with  pharmacies  to
mislead  the  pharmacies  into  believing  the  prescription  was  valid.  In  February  2015,  a
pharmacist suspected her prescription to be fraudulently obtained and called the police
while  Applicant  was  waiting  to  pick  up  her  refill.  A  police  officer  confronted  Applicant,
and she admitted the prescription fraud. She was arrested and charged with five counts
of prescription fraud, a class 6 felony. In May 2015, she entered into a plea agreement
whereby she pleaded guilty to all five felony counts. She was sentenced to two years of
probation,  was  ordered  to  attend  drug  counseling,  had  her  driver’s  license  suspended
for 30 months, and was ordered to pay fees. As part of her plea agreement, her guilty
plea  on  the  five  felony  counts  was  suspended  for  a  year  and  all  five  were  reduced  to
misdemeanors  when  she  completed  the  other  requirements  of  her plea  agreement  on
June 15, 2017. It is unclear whether she has continued to attend drug counseling after
June 2017. (Items 2-5; FORM Response)
From about 2007 until 2014, Applicant held a security clearance while she either
worked  as  a  contractor  for  a  government  agency  or  directly  for  the  same  government
agency.  In  about  December  2013,  she  failed  to  properly  escort  individuals  in  her
workspace  for  whom  she  was  responsible,  because  she  was  using  social  media.  Her
supervisor  revoked  her  access  to  the  information-technology  (IT)  system  that  allowed
her to access social media at work. Applicant wanted to continue to access social media
at work, so, in contravention of the government’s rules for accessing its IT systems, she
used another employee’s  (her mother’s) access  information to  access  the  government
IT system. Her mother told her that she should not use her mother’s access information,
but Applicant thought it was not a big deal. In about July 2014, the government agency
for whom she worked determined that she was inappropriately accessing its IT system
with  another  individual’s  access  information  and  gave  her  the  option  of  resigning  or
being fired. She resigned. She lost her security clearance because of this conduct and
blames her actions on a “severe error in judgment.” (Items 2-4; FORM Response)
To show her rehabilitation and worthiness to hold a security clearance, Applicant
cites to the years that have passed without using opioids, engaging in criminal conduct,
or  engaging  in  workplace  misconduct.  She  claimed  that  she  has  learned  from  her
mistakes  and  now  possesses  the  requisite  judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  to
hold a security clearance. She claimed that the level of trust that her current employer
places in her is evidence of this change. (Item 2; FORM Response)

April 2012. He remained unemployed until November 2013. He has been employed in the
same  information  technology  position  by  two  different  defense  contractors  since  June
2018.  The  secret  clearance  he  was  granted  in  June  2018  was  sponsored  by  a  prior
employer for whom he did not end up working. (GE 1; GE 2 at 8; GE 4; GE 5 at 2; GE 6;
AE G; Tr. at 17, 46, 47-48, 50-52, 120-121)
The  SOR  alleged  security  concerns  about  Applicant’s  marijuana  use  and
marijuana-related criminal charges under Guideline H, and then cross-alleged the same
concerns under Guideline  J.  In his Answer, Applicant  admitted,  in part,  and denied,  in
part, the Guideline H allegations. He did not respond to the Guideline J allegation in his
Answer, which I construed as a denial. Based on Applicant’s admissions, his testimony,
and the evidentiary record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  smoked  marijuana  in  joint  form,  with  varying  frequency,  from  1990
through  2012.  He  consumed  marijuana  in  an  edible  form  one  time  in  2013  while
unemployed. He was criminally charged with possession of marijuana in 2008, 2009, May
2011, December 2011, and 2018. He was convicted of all but the 2008 charge. Applicant
proffered inconsistent information at various times during his testimony and throughout
the  security  clearance  process  concerning  the  facts  and  circumstances  underlying  his
marijuana use and the criminal charges. (GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6; Tr.)
2008  Charge
In September 2008, while driving home from a gun shooting range, a police officer
pulled  Applicant’s  vehicle  over  for  a  missing  license  plate.  After  smelling  marijuana
emanating from the vehicle, the police officer initiated a search of the vehicle. During the
search, the officer found a handgun under the passenger’s seat. The handgun, which was
registered to Applicant, was loaded. Applicant forgot to unload it and place it in the trunk
after leaving the range. The officer also found marijuana inside a bookbag located on the
back seat. Applicant was arrested and held in custody for three to four hours before being
released. (GE 1; GE 2 at 4, 13; GE 4; GE 5 at 3-4; GE 6)
Applicant was initially charged with (1) felony possession of marijuana with intent
to  distribute,  (2)  misdemeanor  possession  of  marijuana,  and  (3)  misdemeanor
transporting  a  handgun  in  a  vehicle.  At  some  point,  charge  (3)  was  amended  to
misdemeanor  transporting,  wearing,  or  carrying  a  handgun.  Charge  (1)  was  nolle
prosequi  in  October  2008.  In  March  2009,  charge  (2)  was  nolle  prosequi  and  he  was
found guilty of charge (3), as amended. In October 2009, he was sentenced to serve an
unspecified  number  of  days  in  jail  over  five  consecutive  weekends  and  supervised
probation  for  one  year.  Applicant  asserted  that  his  sentence  was  shortened  to  three
weekends and that his probation was also shortened by about six months. (AE A at 1-3;
AE B; GE 2 at 4, 13; GE 3; GE 5 at 4; Answer; Tr. at 56, 59, 122)
In  his  2011  eQIP,  Applicant  stated,  “I  have  learned  my  lesson,”  in  response  to
questions about this offense. In his 2017 and 2019 eQIPs, he repeated:
I  was  young   and   immature.   This  was  a   mistake   and   I   have   learned   my
lesson.  I recognize  my failures and  shortcoming’s [sic].  This does  not define
who   I  am   as  a   person   or  professional.  I  have   goals  and   want   to   be
successful.  (GE 1, 4, 6)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  asserted  that  the  marijuana  found  in  his  vehicle  “was
somebody’s else’s.” He also maintained that he had not used marijuana on the day he
was arrested. (Tr. at 151)
2009 Charge
In March 2009, while Applicant was driving home from work, a police officer pulled
his vehicle over for an inoperable taillight. After smelling the odor of marijuana emanating
from the vehicle, the officer initiated a search of the vehicle. During the search, the officer
found  what  Applicant  described  as  a  marijuana  joint  in  the  ashtray.  Applicant  was  not
arrested, but he was issued a summons to appear in court. (GE 1, GE 2 at 4; GE 4; GE
5 at 4; GE 6)
Applicant was charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. A court record
indicates that he pled guilty at a July 1, 2009 court appearance, during which he received
a  deferred  disposition  to  July  6,  2010,  pending  his  completion  of  a  drug  treatment
program,  100 hours of community  service, and  payment of  a $250 fine.  He  voluntarily
performed  an  additional  seven  hours  of  community  service  for  a  total  of  107  hours  in
January 2010. He completed the drug program in February 2010. (GE 3; Answer; AE A
at 5-6, 13-14; AE B)
Applicant  described  the  drug  program  as  an  outpatient  class  where  he  was
subjected to urinalysis testing. He attended group classes once or twice per week where
he was educated about drugs and the pitfalls of drug use. He completed the program in
a manner sufficient to satisfy his obligation to the court. Although he did not stop using
marijuana  immediately following his completion  from the program, he  asserted that he
began  having  better  judgment  and  becoming  more  reliable  based  on  what  he  learned
from the program. About two to three months later, he stopped using marijuana because
he wanted to better his life. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 65)
In his 2011 eQIP, Applicant stated, “I was immature and having fun, I have learned
my lesson,” in response to questions about this offense. In his 2017 and 2019 eQIPs, he
repeated,  “I  am  drug  free  and  more  mature.”  At  the  hearing,  he  asserted  that  the
marijuana belonged to a “coworker of mine.” (Tr. at 151; GE 1, 4, 6) He also maintained
that he had not used marijuana on the day he was arrested. (Tr. at 66).
May 2011 Charge
In May 2011, Applicant smoked marijuana, in an amount he described as half a
joint, while sitting alone and listening to the radio inside his parked vehicle in a park. At
some  point,  he  fell  asleep  and  was  awakened  by  park  police  officers  pulling  on  his
vehicle’s door handles. In response, Applicant rolled down the window of his vehicle to
speak with the officers. After observing Applicant put something in his mouth believed to
be  drugs,  one  of  the  officers  tried  to  open  Applicant’s  mouth.  In  response,  he  bit  the
officer’s finger. He was arrested and held in custody for two to three hours before being
released. (GE 1; GE 2 at 3, 12-13; GE 4; GE 5 at 3; GE 6; Tr. at 68, 69)
Applicant  was  charged  with  (1)  misdemeanor  assault  on  a  police  officer,  (2)
misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and (3) misdemeanor possession of marijuana
paraphernalia. In July 2011, he pled guilty to charge (2) for which he was sentenced to
serve  one  day  in  jail  and  fined  $50.  The  disposition  of  charges  (1)  and  (3)  was  not
indicated in the documentary evidence. However, he asserted that the officer agreed to
drop  charge  (1)  on  the  basis  that  there  had  been  a  miscommunication  and
misunderstanding of his rights. During a January 2018 security clearance interview (SI),
Applicant  admitted  that  the  officers  found  marijuana  in  the  vehicle.  However,  during
subsequent SIs in March and October 2019 and in his Answer, he maintained that the
officers did not find any marijuana. Applicant did not address charge (3). (GE 1, GE 2 at
3, 13; GE 3, 4; GE 5 at 3; GE 6; Answer; AE A at 7; Tr. at 72; AE B)
Applicant  asserted   that  he   served   his  sentence   by  spending   a   few  hours  in  a
holding  cell  on  the  day  of his conviction. (GE 2  at 3; Tr. at 69) He maintained  that he  did
not  bite  the  officer’s finger on  purpose.  (Tr. at  69) In  his 2011  eQIP,  Applicant  stated, “This
lifestyle  is behind  me  and  I have  grown up,” in  response  to questions about this offense.
In his 2017 and  2019 eQIPs, repeated:
I have  been  drug  free  for 5  years  and  much  more mature;  I understand  and
learned   from   my   failures,   shortcomings,  and   bad   experiences.  This
occurrence  does not define  who  I am  as a  person  or professional. (GE  1,  4,
6)
At  the  hearing,  after initially  denying  that  he  smoked  marijuana  the  day  he  was
arrested, Applicant admitted that he had, in fact, smoked marijuana that day. However,
he  denied  that  he  was  either  smoking  marijuana  or  in  possession  of  marijuana  in  the
vehicle at the time of his arrest. He explained:
Okay, so  they never caught me  with  possession  of marijuana, but then  when
I went  to  the  holding  cell, they  asked  me  to  make  a  statement,  and  basically
I made  this statement, you  know, saying  that I  had  marijuana, and  they said
if I made  that  statement,  that they was [sic] going  to  make  everything  go
away or they  was [sic] going  to  drop all  charges.  So, the  only reason  why I
agreed  to  possession  of marijuana, because they said they  was [sic] going
to  drop  the  assault charges and  the  possession  of marijuana  charges.  (Tr.
at 70, 73, 77, 94-95, 153)
Later during his testimony, Applicant claimed that the police report indicating that
the smell of marijuana was emanating from Applicant’s person was incorrect because,
contrary  to  his  previous  admission  during  an  October  2019  SI,  he  had  not  smoked
marijuana in the vehicle. In response to a question about where he smoked the marijuana,
he asserted “[i]t was after work so after work outside.” He denied that a marijuana smell
was emanating from his person by the time the officers approached him because he had
smoked the marijuana “probably like three hours, four hours” prior. (Tr. at 84, 153-155;
GE 2 at 3)
December 2011 Charge
In December 2011, a police officer pulled Applicant’s vehicle over after observing
him make an illegal U-turn at a red light. Due to smelling the odor of marijuana emanating
from the vehicle, the officer initiated a search of the vehicle. Applicant was arrested after
the officer found a small bag of marijuana in the vehicle, in an amount Applicant described
as equivalent to a joint. (GE 2 at 3-4, 12; GE 5 at 4; Tr. at 77)
Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  possession  of  marijuana.  In  October
2012, he pled guilty, was sentenced to one day in jail, six months unsupervised probation,
and fined $45. (AE A at 4; AE B; Tr. at 74)
In his 2017 eQIP, in response to questions about this offense, Applicant stated:
I paid a  court fine  for this charge  and  case  is  close  [sic].  I have  been  drug
free  for 5  years and  much more mature. I have  learned  my  lesson from my
failures and  shortcomings. This was my last  and  final charge. That part of
my life  is behind  me  and  doesn’t exist, I have  moved  on  and  have  goals to
be successful.  (GE 3, 4)
In his 2019 eQIP, he stated:
I paid a  court fine  for this charge  and  case  is  close  [sic].  I have  been  drug
free  for 5  years and  much more mature. I have  learned  my  lesson from my
failures  and   shortcomings.  That  part  of  my  life   is  behind   me   and   doesn’t
exist, I have moved on and have goals to be  successful. (GE 1)
At the hearing, Applicant asserted that the marijuana found in his vehicle did not
belong  to  him,  and  he  denied  that  he  smoked  marijuana  that  day.  He  attributed  the
officer’s  smell  of  marijuana  to  odor  emanating  from  the  bag  of  marijuana  found  in  the
vehicle. When asked to whom the marijuana belonged, he answered “I mean, I don’t recall
who  was  the  person.”  Then,  he  explained  that  he  had  occasionally  given  rides  to  a
coworker “like once  a  week or once  every  two weeks.” He  believed  that the  marijuana
may have belonged to his coworker. When asked for the coworker’s name, he replied, “I
don’t recall or remember.” He later stated that the marijuana belonged to his cousin. He
maintained  that  he  told  his  lawyer,  but  not  the  arresting  officer  or  the  court,  that  the
marijuana did not belong to him. He stated that arresting officer did not ask whether the
marijuana belonged to him. (Tr. at 77, 80-81, 94, 156)
2018 Charge
In April 2018, while on a routine patrol, a police officer observed Applicant driving
without wearing his seatbelt. When the officer pulled  his vehicle over for a traffic stop,
Applicant immediately jumped out of the vehicle and began to reach back into the vehicle
out of the officer’s line of sight. The officer then ordered Applicant to step away from the
vehicle and to take his hands out of his pockets. During a pat down, the officer detected
a  strong odor of marijuana  emanating from Applicant’s person, at which time Applicant
admitted to the officer that he had just smoked marijuana. The officer also detected the
odor of burnt marijuana emanating from inside the vehicle. During a search of the vehicle,
the officer located a grocery bag inside an open backpack containing a clear Ziplock bag
of  marijuana.  Also  located  inside  the  backpack  was  a  small  container  of  marijuana,  a
digital scale, $113 in cash, and two empty clear plastic baggies. The marijuana had a total
weight  of  22.1  grams  and  a  street  value  of  $440.  Because  the  officer  deemed  the
presence  of  these  items  to  be  indicators  of  possession  of  marijuana  with  the  intent  to
distribute it, he arrested Applicant and transported him to be charged. (GE 7)
Applicant was charged with (1) misdemeanor possession of 10 or more grams of
marijuana and (2) felony possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Charge (2) was
nolle prosequi in May 2018. In October 2018, Applicant pled nolo contendere to charge
(1). He was sentenced to one day in jail, with a credit of one day, and fined $45. (GE 3;
AE A at 8-12; Tr. at 88-89)
During an October 2019 SI, Applicant explained that he had been driving alone in
his vehicle on his way home from work. He asserted that the backpack, which was located
on  the  back  seat  of  the  vehicle,  belonged  to  a  coworker.  He  also  asserted  that  the
coworker had been in the vehicle prior to Applicant’s encounter with the police because
Applicant had given the coworker a ride from work to a bus stop. (GE 2 at 12; Answer)
At the hearing, Applicant reiterated that the backpack did not belong to him. He
maintained that he was wearing his seatbelt at the time he was pulled over. He denied
that, when he exited the vehicle, he either tried to retrieve something from the vehicle or
reach back into  the vehicle. He acknowledged  that he  “jumped  out of the  vehicle,” but
maintained that he only retrieved his identification from his person, not from inside of the
vehicle. He also denied that he smelled of marijuana at the time of his arrest or that he
had  smoked  marijuana  that  day.  He  opined  that  perhaps  the  officer  was  smelling  the
marijuana emanating from the backpack. He did not recall telling the officer that he had
just  smoked  marijuana.  He  asserted  that  the  police  report  was  incorrect  as  to  the
controverted facts. (Tr. at 83-85, 97, 136-137)
Applicant testified  that the  backpack belonged  to  a  coworker who  accidentally left
it in the vehicle after Applicant dropped  off the coworker “earlier that day, from work.” He
estimated  that  he  dropped  the  coworker off  at about  4:00  p.m.  or 5:00  p.m. and  that  he
was pulled  over at about 6:00  p.m.  or 7:00  p.m. He  maintained  that  he  did not  know the
backpack was  in the  vehicle  until it  was discovered  by the  officer. When  asked  for  the
coworker’s name, he  stated  “First name  was  [Person  A].  I  don’t remember  his last name.”
He  gave   Person   A   rides  “probably  once   a   month,  but   it  was  like   one   of  those   special
occasions, it doesn’t happen  regularly.” He asserted  that he  no  longer maintains contact
with Person A. (Tr. at 85-86, 157)
Later  during  the  hearing,  Applicant  disclosed  that,  at  some  point,  during  his
interaction  with  the  officer  outside  of  the  vehicle,  the  officer  told  him  that  he  smelled
marijuana emanating from the vehicle. Applicant explained that he “opened up the car”
after the officer warned that if he did not do so, he was “going to break the car window.”
He also explained that he worked with Person A daily for about six months, had given him
rides about once a month from their worksite to a transit station, and had observed him
smoke marijuana at their worksite prior to starting work “a couple of times.” Later in his
testimony, he admitted that he observed him “about once a week”. (Tr. at 134-135, 136,
139-141)
During his April 2019 and October 2019 SIs, Applicant acknowledged that he had
not disclosed his criminal charges to anyone besides his lawyer because he did not want
to  stress  anybody.  However,  he  asserted  that  he  felt  that  he  could  not  be  coerced  or
blackmailed. He maintained that he had not had any involvement with drugs since 2013
or with law enforcement since 2018. (GE 2 at 9, 13)
Marijuana Use, Frequency, and Future Intent
In his 2011 eQIP, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana while possessing a
security  clearance.  He  described  the  nature  and  frequency  of  his  marijuana  use  as
“[s]tress, special occasions, twice a month.” He explained:
I was raised  in  a  house  were  [sic] marijuana   was used.   I didn’t  know any
better  as  a   kid.  I  have   matured   and   learn   [sic]  the   long   term   effects  of
marijuana use.
He professed his intent not to use marijuana in the future and declared:
I  want  to   be   successful  in  life   and   marijuana   would  hender  [sic]   me   in
accomplishing   my  goals.  The   long   term   effects  of   marijuana   causes   [sic]
health  problems  and  I can’t accomplish  my goals if I’m  not healthy  or living.
(GE 6)
In his 2017 eQIP, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana while possessing a
security  clearance.  He  described  the  nature  and  frequency  of  his  marijuana  use  as
“[r]elieving stress, smoked once every six months.” He explained:
I was raised  in  a  house  were  [sic] marijuana   was used.   I didn’t  know any
better as a  kid. I have  matured  and  have  goals that I  want to  accomplish. I
want to be successful, provide for myself, and take care of my family.
He professed his intent not to use marijuana in the future and asserted:
I want to  be  successful. I have  goals  and  plans that  I  need  to  accomplish
and  marijuana would not help [me]  accomplish those  goals.
Again,  I want to  be  successful and  there  is no  success in doing  drugs or
[sic] under the  influence. I have  learned  my  lesson  from  prior experience
and   wrong   doings.  I’m   ready  for  a   positive   change   in  my  life   and   for  my
family. I  have  been  drug  free  for 5  years and  much  more mature to  know,
right from wrong; and  understand the outcome  regarding  drug  use.
During his 2018 SI, Applicant reiterated his intent not to use marijuana in the future. (GE
4; GE 5 at 4)
In his 2019 eQIP, Applicant admitted that he smoked marijuana while possessing
a  security  clearance  but  denied  that  he  possessed  a  clearance  when  he  consumed
marijuana in edible form in 2013. He described the nature and frequency of his marijuana
use as “[r]elieving stress, smoked once every six months.” He asserted that he consumed
the edible  only one  time  on  a  “special occasion.”  He professed his intent not to smoke
marijuana in the future and repeated verbatim the reasons he provided in his 2017 eQIP.
He  also  professed  his  intent  not  to  consume  marijuana  in  edible  form.  At  the  hearing,
Applicant stated that he obtained the edible from an individual he described as “a friend,
or  an  acquaintance  .  .  .  associate.”  When  asked  to  provide  the  individual’s  name,  he
stated,  “I  just  know him  on  the  street  as  [Person  B].” He  explained  that  Person  B  was
“actually cooking edibles, or making edibles.” He maintained that he no longer maintains
contact with Person B. (GE 4; Tr. at 98, 99-100)
During his March 2019 SI, Applicant characterized his marijuana use as occasional
and estimated the frequency of his use to be around once a year. He stated, generally,
that he whenever he was in possession of marijuana, the quantity was one joint maximum
or  about  four  grams  total.  He  also  stated  that  he  was  always  alone  when  he  used
marijuana and during each occasion that he was involved with law enforcement. He could
not  recall  how  he  obtained  the  marijuana  that  he  used.  He  asserted  that  he  was  not
dependent  on  marijuana.  He  disclosed  that  he  had  been  expelled  for  possession  of
marijuana  during  his  10th  grade  of  high  school.  He  was  able  to  return  to  school  and
earned his high school diploma as indicated above. He reported that, while unemployed
in 2013, he tested positive for marijuana use during a preemployment drug test and was
not hired by that employer. (GE 2 at 1, 3-5)
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  characterized  the  frequency  of  his marijuana  use  as  “I
may  have  consumed marijuana  2  times out of  a  year between 1990  and  2012  when I
didn’t have a clearance or [sic] employed with a government agency.” He reiterated that
drug use is incompatible with his personal and professional goals and that he learned his
lesson from “prior experience and wrong doings.” He asserted:
I have  changed  my  life  for myself and  my family. I have  been  drug  free  for
9  years and much more  mature  to  know, right  from  wrong; and  understand
the  negative  outcome regarding drug use.
At the hearing, Applicant admitted that, whenever he smoked marijuana, he did so
either by himself or, at times, with his uncle, a frequent marijuana user.  He maintained
that  he  never  exchanged  money  for  any  of  the  marijuana  he  used  because  his  uncle
supplied it to him. His uncle passed away from cancer in 2015. He attributed his uncle’s
passing with helping inform his evolved understanding of the dangers that marijuana use
posed to his health and professional goals. In response to a question about the frequency
of Applicant’s marijuana use, he stated “It probably was like once a year.” When asked to
explain the discrepancy between the twice a year he estimated in his Answer, he stated:
Because  I don't think it was  consecutively, it's not consecutively every year.
I mean  maybe  it was like, you  know, one  year I probably did it  twice.  Another
year I  probably did  it once.  So  it wasn't a  pattern as  you  could say  .  .  . I  may
have  did [sic] it one time in one  year, and two times in another year  . . . .
He also testified, “And so I may have partaked [sic], you know, a couple of times or I may
have partaked [sic] once a year or so like I said before on special occasions.”
(Tr. at 89-91, 99, 102-103, 130-131, 149, 150-151)
When  questioned  more  specifically  about  his  use  of  marijuana  in  2009,  2011,
2017, and 2018, Applicant testified that he had not smoked at all in 2009, including on
the day he was arrested in March, and that he only used marijuana one time in 2011, the
day he was arrested in May 2011. He denied using marijuana at any other time in 2011,
including the day he was arrested in December 2011. He denied using marijuana at all in
either 2017 or 2018. He asserted that his last consumption of marijuana was the edible
he ate in 2013. (Tr. at 66, 79, 82, 94-95, 97, 99, 100)
Applicant  had  the  following  exchange  with  Department  Counsel  (DC)  about  his
marijuana use while in possession of a security clearance,
DC: Now, in your responses, sir, you also stated you didn't consume any
marijuana when you had a clearance, right?
Applicant: Correct.
DC: You stated that you had a clearance between 2008 and 2011?
Applicant: Correct, 2008 to, hold on, say that again?
DC: You had a clearance between 2008 and 2011?
Applicant: Okay, yes.
DC: Right? And, you've admitted to smoking during that time period, as well.
Right? You indicated in your SOR response I admit, when you were asked
about smoking between 1990 and 2011? I mean 2012, sorry.
Applicant: So, your question again is?
DC: Sure. So you had a clearance between 2008 and 2011, right?
Applicant: Correct, correct.
DC: All right, and you've stated in your SOR response, you never smoked
or used marijuana while you held a clearance?
Applicant: I did, yes.
DC:  Okay.  And,  but  you've  also  admitted  to  smoking  between  1990  and
December 2012?
Applicant: Correct, correct.
DC: So you did smoke when you, while you held an active clearance?
Applicant: I may have, yes, I may, yes, I did probably once. (Tr. at 100-101)
During  his testimony, Applicant reiterated  that he  had  no  intent to  use  marijuana
or other drugs  in  the  future. He  denied  that he  continued  to  associate  with  any individuals
who  use  marijuana  or other drugs. When  asked   about the  last  time  he  associated  with
such  individuals, he  responded.  “Probably like  2014  or ’15, when  my uncle was  alive.” He
asserted  that  he  had  not given   a   ride  in  his   vehicle   to   “people,   coworkers, [or]   friends”
since  2018. He acknowledged  that he  still  encounters individuals who  use  marijuana  and
other drugs  in his “environment,” but   asserted  that he   is able to  distance   himself when
marijuana or other drugs are being used  around him. (Tr. at 102-103, 114)
When asked to explain how this time would be different than his previous promises
to steer clear of marijuana use and involvement with law enforcement, Applicant testified
that  he  intended  to  “be  more  selfish”  and  avoid  environments  and  persons  involving
drugs. He stated that he had no intent to give rides in his vehicle to anyone in the future.
He understood that drug use is incompatible with maintaining a security clearance. (Tr.

Applicant testified that he reported his criminal charges to “most employers I did
let them know, yes.” He maintained that he never suffered any negative consequences
with his employment or lost his clearance due to his criminal charges. He acknowledged
that his employers provided him with security clearance training, including informing him
“not to partake any criminal or illegal activities.” However, he also asserted:
I wasn't  really instructed  how to  conduct myself.  Well, like  you  said, I  thought
the  clearance  mainly had  to  do  with  the  job. So  I didn't think it had  to  do  with
your outside  life, normal life, after work. So that was ignorance  on my part,
not   taking   the   clearance   into   consideration  of on   [sic]  the   job   and   how   to
conduct  yourself,  you   know,  when   you're   not  working.  But  I'm   more
knowledgeable now. And  I understand, you  know, how to  conduct myself,
you  know, either on  the  job  or off the  job  and  period  just  having  a  clearance.
So  I understand  the  severity of having  a  clearance,  yes.  (Tr. at 95, 158-159)
Whole Person
Applicant  has  resided  with  his  grandmother  all  his  life.  When  his  grandfather
passed away “in 2012 or 2009,” he became her primary caregiver. He took time off from
work to take care of her when she was sick. His mother passed away when he was five
years  old.  He  has  never  met  his  father  and  does  not  know  whether  he  is  living  or
deceased. He was raised in a hostile environment where marijuana was frequently used
and where he did not have access to positive role models. He explained, “So, of course,
I didn't see any negative aspects of it because everybody was functional.” Eventually, he
realized that he had to separate himself from that environment if he wanted to get ahead
in life, which led him to seek a “good job,” and get a clearance. (Answer; GE 5 at 1; GE 1
at 17-19, 27; Tr. at 129-133, 149).
Applicant  volunteered  for  a  Hurricane  Katrina  relief  project  from  2006  through
2008. He has volunteered for a Christmas in April program. Since 2010, he has regularly
volunteered  to  take  on  projects  for  his  church.  An  individual  from  the  program  where
Applicant  performed  the  community  service  hours  in  connection  with  his  March  2009
charge  wrote  a  letter  on  his  behalf  lauding  Applicant’s  exceptional  character  and
performance as a volunteer. The individual also stated, “I believe that this experience will
have an endless impression on [Applicant] and will teach him to follow the correct path.”
(AE G; AE A at 15)
Applicant proffered documents showing the various accolades he received about
his  exemplary  work  performance.  He  also  provided,  two  letters,  both  from  September
2022, from individuals who  praised his character and work performance. One of those
references, a friend and former coworker, stated, “I have never witnessed [Applicant] with
drugs or associated with any criminal activity.” Applicant acknowledged that none of his
references knew about his criminal arrests and convictions or his marijuana use. At some
point, he received a five-year service award for delivering outstanding customer service
while employed by a defense contractor for whom he was employed between 2002 and
2011. (AE D, F, G, H; Tr. at 103)

Applicant’s next-door neighbor testified on Applicant’s behalf at the hearing. The
neighbor considers him  to  be  “like  a  son.” The  neighbor has  known  him  since at least
2012, having met through Applicant’s grandmother. He and the neighbor interact “close
to every day.” The neighbor has observed him taking care of his grandmother and their
home. The witness stated, “He helps her out a lot.”
I've   never   known  him   to   do   anything   wrong   or  hang   out  with   the   wrong
characters  out  there.  Every  time   I  seen   [sic]  him   he's   working.  He   helps
everybody in the  neighborhood. I  think -- I think a  lot  of him. And  I think he'd
be   pretty  good   with   whatever  he   do   [sic]  in   life.  He  doesn't  do   anything
wrong that I know of or ever seen  him  do.  (Tr. at 7-14)
The  neighbor  had  not  been  aware  of  Applicant’s  history  of  marijuana  use  or  criminal
charges  prior  to  the  Government  presenting  him  with  that  information  upon  cross-
examination.  After  being  presented  by  that  information,  the  neighbor  reiterated  his
support for Applicant.  (Tr. at 7-14)
At the end of the hearing, Applicant asserted that each occasion of his involvement
with law enforcement resulted from profiling. He explained, “I mean, all the times I got
pulled over is, as you can say, I feel like I was being profiled or they was [sic] looking for
something and then that escalated to another thing.” (Tr. at 165)

"In  her  handwritten  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  Guideline  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.h,  1.o,
and  1.p.  She  denied  her  student  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.i  –  1.n)  noting  that  they  were  now
current. She admitted both Guideline J allegations (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b). As noted, the
first answer did not address the Guideline E allegations.
In  her  second,  typed  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  Guideline  F
allegations  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.p,  with  a  general  explanation.  She  admitted  the  Guideline  J
allegations at SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b, with explanations. Under Guideline E. she “admitted”
SOR  ¶¶ 3.a-3.c, three  falsification  allegations,  but  with explanations  that  I  construe as
denials. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
This case resulted from Applicant’s May 2019 credit report, pulled via the DOD’s
Continuous  Evaluation  Program  (CEP).  It  showed  over  $76,000  in  delinquent  debts.
(GE 3). Applicant submitted her SCA in August 2019. (GE 1)
Applicant is 40 years old. She is not married. She has two adult children (ages 22
and  23)  and  a  10-year-old  child,  for  whom  she  receives  child  support.  Her  eldest  and
youngest children live with her. Applicant graduated high school in 2000 and has some
college  education.  She  is  currently  taking  college  courses  (and  has  student  loans,
discussed below). (Tr. 43-44, 98-99, 124-126; GE 1)
Applicant worked sporadically during 2009, and then worked for a contractor for
about a year, from 2010 to 2011. She was wrongfully terminated from that job after she
became  pregnant.  She  did  not  work  for  about  the  next  year,  while  home  with  her
daughter.  From  2012  to  2015,  Applicant  worked  a  variety  of  jobs  with  various
contractors.  Since  2018,  she  has  worked  for  a  DOD  contractor  as  a  travel  manager.
She began her career as an administrative assistant and has worked her way up from
there.  She  has  an  annual  salary  of  about  $100,000.  She  has  had  a  clearance  since
about 2009. (Tr. 40-48, 66-67, 98-100; GE 1; AE D, AE L)
The  financial  allegations  in  the  SOR  (¶¶  1.a-1.p)  relate  to  delinquent  federal
student  loans  (just  under  $60,000),  plus  about  $19,000  in  consumer  debts  and  other
delinquencies. The debts are established by credit reports from December 2019 (GE 5),
and  October  2020  (GE  6),  and  by  Applicant’s  admissions.  Many  of  the  debts  are  also
listed on earlier credit reports, from May 2019 (GE 3), July 2019 (GE 4), pulled during
the CEP, and by the November 2019 credit report (GE 2b) as well.
Applicant  blamed  her  financial  troubles  on  “just  not  being  smart  with  money,
[and] not being responsible” in paying her bills on time. She stated that she makes more
money now and is able to address her debts and be more responsible. (Tr. 52, 133)
Applicant enrolled  many of  her debts  in  a  debt consolidation  program. (AE  E, AE
S) She  claimed  she  started  the  program  in  either 2019  (Tr. 73) or  in  late  2021,  (Tr. 58)
but  she   admitted  she   was   “guessing”   about  the   date.   (Tr.  123-124)   She   said  the
company  takes $350  twice  a  month.  She  later documented  a  list of creditors  enrolled  in
the  program,  with  balances due.  (Tr. 58-61;  AE  F,  AE  O)  AE  T includes 2022  account
statements   from   company  GH.  Applicant  enrolled   in  the   company  in   March  2021,   and
AE   T   appears  to   show  payments  to   creditors,  so   it   may   be   a   statement   from   the   debt
relief company though  this is not clear. (AE T)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($12,071) is  the account for a repossessed motorcycle. The amount
alleged is what was charged off after the motorcycle was sold at auction. (GE 5, GE 6;
Tr. 54, 67-68) Applicant purchased the bike in 2014. She stopped making payments on
the bike, in about 2016, because she did not want it anymore. (Tr. 68-72) The bike was
later repossessed. (GE 5, GE 6)
The   creditor  agreed   to   settle   the   account   for  about  $3,621,  with   monthly
payments  (starting at $50,  increasing  to $520) between  April  2022 and  March  2023. (AE
S) The account  is enrolled  in the  debt  relief program.  (AE  O) The amount  owed  is now
$11,971  (down $100 from what is alleged). (AE F, AE G) This  account is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b ($597) is a charged-off credit-card account with a department store. It
became  delinquent  in  about  2015.  (GE  5;  GE  6;  Tr.  77-78)  Applicant  enrolled  the
account in the debt relief program. (AE O) Applicant received a settlement offer in 2021.
(AE Q) A recent credit report shows the account  was legally paid for less than the full
balance and has been closed. (Tr. 78, 130-131, AE G, AE O)
SOR ¶¶  1.c  ($264) and  1.d  ($1,546) are  past-due  debts  to  unidentified  medical
creditors.  (GE  5)  Applicant  said  she  was  unaware  of  these  debts  because  she  had
medical  insurance.  She  contacted  the  hospital’s  collection  office  but  was  not  able  to
resolve the debts. She stated that she intends to pay them. (Tr. 79-82, 131) The debt at
¶ 1.d is enrolled in the debt relief program but no settlement has been reached. (AE E)
Applicant  was  in  a  car accident  in  February  2020  and  required medical  treatment  and
physical  therapy.  Applicant  provided  documentation  about  resolution  of  some  of  her
other medical accounts, with payments made in November 2022. (AE H, AE I, AE J; Tr.
131-132)
SOR ¶ 1.e ($739) is a credit-card account placed for collection by a retailer. (GE
5, GE 6) Applicant believes the account is covered by the debt relief program. (Tr. 82,
85, 130-131) A recent credit report shows that the account was charged off but closed
with a zero balance. (AE G)
SOR  ¶   1.f   ($577)  is  an   account   placed   for  collection   by  a   bank.  (GE   5,   GE   6)
Applicant became  aware in 2017  that this  account  was delinquent. (Tr. 83-84)  She  had
a settlement  in  place  in April 2021  for  $288  and  is paying  on  the  debt. (AE  P,  Tr. 130-
131) She  indicated  post-hearing  that  she  will  pay  $50  a  month  until the  debt  is  resolved.
(AE  F; AE  P)  A  recent  credit report shows that the  balance  as of November 2022  was
$361.  (AE  G)  This account  is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g ($2,448) is an account placed for collection by a retailer, concerning
musical equipment. (GE 5, GE 6) The account became delinquent in 2019. The debt is
being resolved through the debt relief company but no settlement amount is noted. (Tr.
85-86; AE E)
SOR ¶ 1.h ($60) is an account placed for collection by a power company. (GE 5)
This account is a utility bill at an old apartment, Applicant asserts that this debt was paid
several years ago but provided no documentation. (Tr. 87-89, 130)
SOR ¶¶  1.i ($5,034), 1.j ($2,808), 1.k ($5,142), 1.l ($16,018), 1.m  ($26,444), and
1.n  ($4,042)  are federal  student  loans with  the  U.S. Department of  Education  (USDOE),
all  placed  for collection. (GE 5; GE  6)  Applicant  acknowledged  missing  payments. She
thought  they were  the  same  student  loans  as  with  creditor N,  but  now knows  differently.
(Tr. 56-57, 89-92, 129) She took out loans for more than she needed for tuition to cover
other costs. (Tr. 125-127) She said she has made no federal student loan payments on
these accounts since at least 2015. (Tr. 94, 129) She has received no communication or
correspondence from the USDOE about her loans, (Tr. 130) A recent credit report lists
all of these accounts, all with USDOE, as past due, in the amounts alleged, totaling over
$59,500. These accounts are unresolved.
At the time of the hearing, repayment of federal student loans had been on hold
due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  under  multiple  Presidential  Executive  Orders  since
March 2020. Federal student loan payments remain paused until at least June 30, 2023.
See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19; (Tr. 55-56, 92-94)
As of May 2021, Applicant owed about $27,000 to private student loan creditor N,
with nothing past due. (AE B) As of November 2022, she has an arrangement in place
with  creditor  N  to  resume  $400  monthly  payments  in  January  2023  on  her  private
student loans. The balance due is $28,789. No past-due amount is listed. (AE B, AE K;
Tr. 128)
SOR ¶  1.o  ($535) is an account  placed  for collection  by a  phone  company. (GE
5)   Applicant   asserted   that   her  current   home   is  serviced   by   the   same   phone   company
and she  is in good standing  but provided  no  documentation. (Tr. 94-96)
SOR  ¶  1.p  ($547)  is  an  account  placed  for  collection  by  insurance  company  P.
(GE 6) Applicant had insurance with company P at the time of her accident but changed
companies  soon  thereafter.  She  settled  the  account  for  $300  and  is  disputing  the
remainder. (AE F; AE G, AE R; Tr. 97)
Applicant does not owe past-due taxes or other delinquent debts. She keeps an
informal  budget,  but  has  not  taken  any  formal  budget  or  financial  counseling  classes.
(Tr.  97,  104,  107-108,  111)  She  acknowledged  about  $17,000  in  credit  card  debt,  not
alleged.  (Tr.  103)  Many  of  the  delinquent  debts  in  the  SOR  are  also  listed  on  credit
reports from 2021 and 2022 provided by Applicant. (AE C, AE G)
In June 2013, Applicant was at work when she received a call that police were at
her house. When she arrived, the police told her that they had found marijuana. It was
found  in  a  baggie  in  her  young  son’s  closet.  He  was  in  junior  high  school  at  the  time.
Applicant  was  cited  for  possession  of  marijuana  since  it  was  her  house.  She  was  not
handcuffed  or  placed  in  jail;  she  received  a  citation  to  go  to  court.  (Tr.  114,  119-120)
Applicant  pleaded  no  contest,  received  deferred  adjudication,  and  the  case  was
dismissed in November 2014. (AE A; GE 8) (SOR ¶ 2.b) Applicant denied guilt but pled
no contest so her son would not get in further trouble with the law. She said she had no
idea her son was involved  with marijuana. Applicant did not have to attend counseling
or treatment. She took and passed a urinalysis test. (Tr. 49-50, 114-116) Applicant has
had no other arrests. (Tr. 127)
Applicant  was  not  involved  in  the  illegal  purchase,  manufacture,  cultivation,
trafficking,  production,  transfer,  shipping,  receiving,  handling  or  sale  of  a  drug  or
controlled  substance.  Applicant  knew  she  was  subject  to  drug  testing  and  held  a
clearance at the time of the citation. She did not report the citation to her employer. As a
contractor at a large DOD facility, she claimed that she did not know who to report the
issue to. About a week after she appeared in court, she was called in to security at the
DOD  facility  where  she  worked;  she  had  been  “flagged”  because  of  the  marijuana
citation.  She  told  them  what  had  happened  and  she  was  allowed  to  go  back  to  work.
(Tr. 116, 120-123)
SOR  ¶  2.a,  alleged  under  Guideline  J  for  criminal  conduct,  mostly  concerns
several  traffic  citations  that  Applicant  allegedly  incurred  between  “August  2011  and
October 2019.”  They include: 1) expired inspection or failure to have vehicle inspected
(August 2011, September 2012; February 2017); 2) driving without a license or driving
on  a  suspended  license  (February  2014,  and  twice  in  June  2014);  3)  a  commuter
parking violation (August 2014); 4) violations of the high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane
(May 2017 and October 2017); and 5) speeding (80 miles per hour (mph) in a 65 mph
zone (October 2013). All of these citations are traffic infractions but for driving without a
license  or  driving  with  a  suspended  license,  which  are  misdemeanor  offenses.  (GE  7,
Tr. 112-113) The most recent citation was issued in October 2017, not October 2019.
Applicant admitted the violations. She said she sometimes drove too fast on her
motorcycle,  and  most  of  her  traffic  tickets  came  during  that  period.  She  returned  the
motorcycle  (in  a  voluntary  repossession)  after  a  close  friend  died  in  a  motorcycle
accident.  (Tr.  52-53)  As  part  of  her  deferred  adjudication  for  the  marijuana  citation,
Applicant’s  driver’s  license  was  restricted  (to  and  from  work,  school,  a  court-ordered
facility, and while transporting a minor child). This restriction ran from February 2014 to
May 2014. (GE 8)
As to the expired inspections, Applicant stated she knew that at the time she was
driving  a  car  that  would  not  pass  inspection.  She  acknowledged  knowing  that  she
should  not  have  done  this.  (Tr.  114)  Due  to  her  traffic  tickets,  her  license  was
suspended  in  2014  for  a  few  months.  (Tr.  64-65)  Since  about  August  of  last  year,
Applicant leases a used luxury truck. She pays $605 per month. Her driver’s license is
current. (Tr. 65-66, 102)
Applicant did not disclose her marijuana possession citation or any of her debts
on  her  August  2019  SCA.  She  denied  any  intent  to  withhold  information.  (Tr.  42;
Answer)
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her 2013 citation
for marijuana possession  in answer to  two questions  under Section  22:  Police Record
on her August 2019 SCA:
Have   any  of   the   following   happened?:  In   the   last  seven   (7)  years,  have
you   been   issued   a   summons,   citation,   or   ticket  to   appear   in   court  in  a
criminal  proceeding   against   you?  (Other   questions  ask  about  arrests,
charges,   convictions,   or  sentences,  none   of   which   apply  to   a   citation   for
marijuana  possession  leading to deferred  adjudication  and  a dismissal.)
[and]
Have  you EVER been charged  with  an  offense involving alcohol or drugs?
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her 2013 citation
for  marijuana  possession  in  answer  to  two  questions  under  Section  23:  Illegal  Use  of
Drugs or Drug Activity on her August 2019 SCA:
In  the  last  seven (7)  years, have  you  been  involved  in the  illegal purchase,
manufacture,  cultivation,
transfer,  shipping,
receiving, handling, or sale of any drug  or controlled substance?
trafficking,  production,
[and]
Have   you   EVER  illegally  used   or otherwise  been   illegally involved   with   a
drug  or controlled  substance  while possessing  a  security clearance  other
than  previously listed?
Applicant did not report the 2013 marijuana citation on her 2019  SCA. She had
two  opportunities  to  do  so:  1)  in  answer  to  the  first  “seven-year”  question  detailed  in
SOR ¶ 3.a (and also arguably the second, since it was a drug offense, though she was
cited  and  not  “charged”);  and  2)  in  answer  to  the  second  “have  you  EVER”  question
detailed  in  SOR  ¶  2.b.  (Applicant  did  not  use  marijuana  with  a  clearance,  but
possession of marijuana constitutes “illegal involvement” with it.) She was not engaged
in the sale, distribution, cultivation, etc., of marijuana, as called for in the other question
under SOR ¶ 2.b.
Applicant asserted that she did not report the offense because it was outside the
seven-year scope of the question. (Tr. 50-51, 118); She also asserted that she did not
report  the  offense  because  it  had  been  dismissed.  (Tr.  50-51;  Answer)  She
acknowledged that the investigator knew about the arrest during her interview. (Tr. 52)
She also acknowledged that she did not want to lose her job. She now understands that
she should have listed the citation, since it was six years before her August 2019 SCA,
and was also a drug offense. (Tr. 120)
Applicant did not  disclose her debts on her SCA. She said she did not  disclose
them  because  she  was  paying  on  them  and  therefore  did  not  believe  they  were
delinquent.  (Tr.  61)  She  first  acknowledged  that  some  of  her  debts  were  delinquent
when  she  filled  out  her  SCA,  (Tr.  62)  but  later  said  she  did  not  believe  they  were
delinquent because “they were in the program to be paid.” (Tr. 123) Applicant asserted
that  the  motorcycle  debt  was  not  delinquent  when  she  prepared  her  SCA  because  it
was being paid through the debt relief program, which she said she started in 2019. She
acknowledged that the account was past due before then. (Tr. 72-73)
In Applicant’s background interview summary, she discusses her debts at length,
but not before she was confronted about many of them. She also discussed many of the
traffic  infractions  in  SOR  ¶  2.a.  The  marijuana  citation  is  not  discussed,  either  by
Applicant or the interviewer. (GE 2a)
Applicant provided a reference letter from a co-worker. Applicant is regarded as a
hard worker, and she is polite and respectful. She carries herself with “levelheadedness
and  grace.”  She  possesses  the  character  and  judgment  of  someone  working  for  the
betterment of the community. (AE M)

"Applicant  is  33  years  old  and  single.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  is
currently studying for his master’s. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor
as an engineer since September 2020 and seeks to obtain national security eligibility and
a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  current  employment.  He  had  worked  for
another defense  contractor from 2013  to  2020.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Sections  12,
13A, and 17.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about  a  person’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted both allegations under this
guideline.
1.a.  Applicant  was  arrested  on  December  28,  2016,  and  charged  with  Felony
Assault with a Deadly Weapon. Applicant stated that he was extremely intoxicated that
night and does not really remember the event. However, Applicant admitted he hit another
person in the head with a glass during a bar fight. The glass broke, the other person was
injured, and Applicant was arrested. Applicant subsequently pled guilty in May 2017 to
the Assault with a Deadly Weapon charge. He was sentenced to five years of supervised
probation,  two  days  in  jail,  and  30  days  community  labor.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Section 22, Exhibit 4 at pages 10-11.)
Applicant’s probation terms included the following, as described by Applicant:
Do  not  use  or  possess  any  narcotics,  dangerous  or  restricted  drugs  or
associated  paraphernalia,  except  with  a  valid  prescription  and  stay  away
from places where users or sellers congregate. Do not associate with drug
users or sellers unless attending a drug treatment program. . . Abstain from
the  use  of  alcoholic  beverages,  including  beer  and  wine,  and  stay  out  of
places  where  they  are  the  chief  items  of  sale.  .  .  You  [Applicant]  are
specifically ordered not to use or possess any quantity of marijuana, even
with  an  otherwise  valid  prescription  or  recommendation.  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 22.)
Applicant’s  probation  ended  in  May  2022.  (Tr.  49.)  He  repeatedly  violated  the
above terms of his probation as described below.
1.b.  Applicant used illegal drugs and alcohol on a frequent basis from May 2017
through June 2019 while he was on probation for the offense set forth in 1.a, above. He
knew his conduct was in violation of his probation. Applicant admitted that he did not tell
the probation department at any time that he was violating his probation. He stated that
he discussed telling the probation department about his drug and alcohol use once he
stopped using all drugs and alcohol after June 2019. He was advised by relatives that he
should not do so, since admitting to a probation violation may require him to go to jail or
prison.  Applicant  agreed  not  to  tell  probation  personnel  about  his  conduct.  Applicant
stated that his probation officer never asked Applicant if he used drugs or alcohol during
his mandatory monthly interviews. (Government Exhibit 4 at 24-25; Tr. 52-54.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  G, Alcohol Consumption)
The  Government alleges in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for  clearance
because  he  consumes  intoxicants to  excess.  Applicant admitted  both  allegations under
this guideline.
2.a. Refer to that information set forth under subparagraph 1.a, above.
2.b.  Applicant  used  alcohol  from  May  2017 through  December  2018.  He  stated
that from about the middle of 2018 until September 2018 he consumed alcohol frequently
and excessively. During that time, as set forth under paragraph 1, above, Applicant was
on probation and required to abstain from any use of alcohol. Applicant was interviewed
by a Government investigator on March 2, 2021. The investigator’s Report of Investigation
(ROI) stated, “He [Applicant] decided to keep drinking alcohol during the time he was on
probation  because  he  had  already  violated  his  probation  at  that  time.”  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 24; Exhibit 4 at pages 12, 22-23; Tr. 54-55.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
As a preliminary matter, Applicant held a security clearance from approximately
January 2015  through March  2017.  According  to  Applicant  his clearance  was  revoked
due  to  the  criminal charges  set  forth  in  paragraph  1,  above.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Section 25.)
3.a. Applicant used marijuana on various occasions from approximately February
2003 until July 2019. As stated, between January 2015 and March 2017 Applicant was
granted access to classified information. He used marijuana daily from June to December
2018. Applicant stopped use for several months until he last used marijuana with an ex-
girlfriend in July 2019. (Government Exhibit 4 at pages 8-19.)
3.b.  Applicant  used  cocaine  on  various  occasions  from  May  2010  to  December
2018. As stated, between January 2015 and March 2017 Applicant was granted access
to  classified  information.  He  used  cocaine  weekly  during  2017.  He  used  cocaine  daily
during 2018 until his last use around New Year’s 2018/19. (Government Exhibit 4 at pages
19-20.)
3.c.  Applicant  used  cocaine  at  work  while  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  in
2018. He stated in his Answer, “I used at an unclassified site with no classified information
present, nor any secure rooms or locations present at the facility.” (Government Exhibit 4
at pages 19-20.)
3.d. Applicant used Ecstasy one time in June 2010 and a second time in July 2018.
It is further alleged that Applicant’s 2018 use of Ecstasy occurred while he was granted
access  to  classified  information.  The  record  is  unclear  as  to  whether  he  actually  had
access in July 2018. He stated in his Answer that his clearance was under reinvestigation
at that time, and he may have had an interim clearance. However, Government Exhibit 5,
a  DISS/CATS  Incident  Report,  stated  Applicant’s  “Eligibility  Level”  was  “none.”  The
document also stated, under “Eligibility Determination,” “’No Determination Made’ made
on  2019-02-11  by  DoD  CAF.”  (Internal  punctuation  added  for  clarity.)  (Government
Exhibit 4 at pages 20, 24; Tr. 51-52.) Given the state of the evidence this allegation is
found for Applicant.
3.e. Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms one time in about November 2018.
It is further alleged that Applicant’s 2018 use of hallucinogenic mushrooms occurred while
he was granted access to classified information. The record is unclear as to whether he
actually had access in July 2018. He stated in his Answer that his clearance was under
reinvestigation  at  that  time,  and  he  may  have  had  an  interim  clearance.  However,
Government Exhibit 5, a DISS/CATS Incident Report, stated Applicant’s “Eligibility Level”
was  “none.”  The  document  also  stated,  under  “Eligibility  Determination,”  “’No
Determination Made’ made on 2019-02-11 by DoD CAF.” (Internal punctuation added for
clarity.)  (Government  Exhibit  4  at  pages  20-21,  24;  Tr.  51-52.)  Given  the  state  of  the
evidence this allegation is found for Applicant.
3.f.  Applicant  admitted
that  he  used  marijuana,  cocaine,  Ecstasy  and
Hallucinogenic Mushrooms between at least May 2017 and July 2019 as set forth above.
During that period, he was prohibited from using any illegal drugs under the terms of his
probation.  He  stated  in  his  Answer  that  his  use,  including  daily  use  of  cocaine  and
marijuana,  was  because,  “I  was  under  extreme  depression  and  anxiety  due  to  the
circumstances that arose from my arrest in December 2016 as stated in subparagraph
1.a.” (Answer; Government Exhibit 4 at pages 18-21; Tr. 49.)
With regard to his drug use, as well as his alcohol use, Applicant stated that he
made a conscious decision at the end of 2018 to stop using all the substances in order to
live a better, healthier life. He also stated that his decision was the result of a religious
awakening  in  his  life.  Applicant  testified  that  his  management  is  aware  of  his  past.
However,  no  additional  information  was  forwarded  by  Applicant  from  his  current
employers setting forth the extent of their knowledge. (Government Exhibit 4 at 18; Tr.
42-48, 54-55.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  falsified  material  facts  during  the  clearance  screening  process.  In
addition, it is alleged that Applicant engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations.
Applicant admitted both allegations under this paragraph with explanations.
4.a.  The Government alleges in this subparagraph that all of the information set
forth under paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, above, is also cognizable under this guideline.
4.b. Applicant submitted an e-QIP on January 11, 2018. (Government Exhibit 2.)
Section 23 concerned Illegal Use of Drugs and Drug Activity. Applicant was specifically
asked,  “In  the  last  (7)  seven  years,  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled
substances?” Applicant answered, “Yes.” He disclosed marijuana use between 2003 and
2013,  cocaine  use  in  2010,  and  Ecstasy  use  in  2010.  These  were  false  answers  to
relevant questions about Applicant’s drug involvement. In his Answer, Applicant explained
this conduct:
Note that while I falsified information at this time, I was using alcohol and
drugs and was not applying my best judgment. The substance abuse did
create my conduct to be questionable and this is what caused me to falsify
information. Another reason was my fear of admission of substance abuse
could be reported to my probation officer and this would cause me to serve
my suspended sentence.
Applicant was forthcoming on a 2020 questionnaire and in subsequent interviews
with Government investigators. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23; Government Exhibit
4 at pages 18-21, 25; Tr. 50.)
Mitigation
The  pastor of Applicant’s church testified  on   his behalf. The  witness has known
Applicant  for  three   years.  He  testified   at  length   about  what  the   witness  views  as
Applicant’s personal growth  in the  past three  years. The  witness had  knowledge  of  the
allegations  in  the   SOR.  He  stated   that  Applicant  has  been   open   with   him   about  his
conduct  and   about   his  battle   with   alcohol  and   drugs.   Applicant   provides   substantial
financial   support   to   the   church.   The   witness  believes  Applicant   to   be   trustworthy.
(Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 17-40.)

"Applicant is 31 years old.  He is divorced and has four children, two with his ex-
wife,  and  two  with  his  current  girlfriend  who  resides  with  him.  He  has  completed  two
years of college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Electronic Technician.
He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  conduct,  drug  abuse,  alcohol  abuse,  and
dishonesty, evidenced by numerous arrests and convictions spanning over most of his
adult  life.  (Government  Exhibits  2,  4,  5,  6,  and  7.)  Applicant  admits  to  each  of  the
allegations set forth in the SOR.  (See Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.)
After finishing high  school, Applicant  joined  the  U.S. Army.   He  served  in  the  U.S.
Army from  June  2009  to  December  2016,  and  held  a  security  clearance.   He received
an   Honorable   Discharge  for his first  six-year   tour of  service.   He   then   re-enlisted   for   a
second  two-year tour where most  of  his problems  began.   During  his military career, he
received   a  number   of  awards  and   commendations  for  his   service,  including   the   Army
Good   Conduct   Medal,  (2nd  award);   the   Army   Achievement  Medal,  (2nd   Award);   the
Afghanistan   Campaign   Medal  with   2   campaign   Stars;   the   Global   War   on   Terrorism
Medal;   the   National  Defense   Medal;   and   the   Combat  Action   Badge   for  his  service   in
Afghanistan.   (Applicant’s  Exhibit  F.)
During his second tour in the military, Applicant’s excessive alcohol consumption
and  alcohol  dependence  caused  him  to  be  arrested  on  a  number  of  occasions  for
Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI).  This excessive criminal conduct resulted
in him being disciplined.  (Tr. p. 31-32.)  His rank was reduced from an E-4 to an E-1.
He was eventually discharged from the Army with an “Other than Honorable” discharge
in December 2016.  (Government Exhibit 7.)  Following his discharge, Applicant applied
for  VA  disability.  He  is  currently  receiving  100  percent  VA  disability  for  his  Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  (Applicant’s Exhibit F.)
Applicant explained that he  was born and raised in Iowa  to a drug and alcohol-
addicted  mother.  His  father  was  never  in  the  picture.  He  experienced  a  very difficult
childhood  and  still  suffers  from  this  trauma.  He  described  bouncing  from  foster  care
home to foster care home and always feeling out of place.  He witnessed his 11 month
old sister being molested by one of his foster care parents, and was beaten for trying to
stop the abuse.  As a five or six year old child he described staying in a drug house with
his  biological  mother  and  being  allowed  to  roam  the  streets  with  no  supervision.  His
mother was not present and his two older siblings sometimes took care of him.  He was
also molested at age 5 or 6.  (Tr. p. 37.)
In  March/April  2017,  Applicant  began  working  as  a  civilian  for  a  defense
contractor.  Since  obtaining  this  employment,  he  states  that  he  has  never  violated
company  policies  and  procedures  nor  has  he  violated  any  proprietary  interests  of  the
company.  He states that he has received favorable performance evaluations, and has
been promoted for good job performance.  He contends that for the past four years, he
has greatly improved himself and changed his life for the better.
Guideline J  - Criminal Conduct
Applicant’s  criminal  conduct  began  while  he  was  in  the  Army.  His  extensive
arrest history includes six arrests for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), and
other  related  charges  and  convictions.  1.a.  In  October  2010,  Applicant  was  charged
with underaged drinking.  He was found guilty and received an Article 15.  1.b.  In July
2014,  he  was  apprehended  for  Spousal  Abuse  and  Child  Endangerment.  1.c.
In
October  2015,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI,  with  a  BAC  of  .08%  or
higher,  and  Driving  without  a  license.  1.d.  In  March  2016,  while  on  probation  for  his
October 2015  DUI  offense, Applicant  was arrested  and  charged with  DUI,  and  hit and
run.  1.e.
In  June  2016,  while  still  on  probation  for  his  March  2016  DUI  offense,
Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, and registered a BAC of .13%.  His Army
post  privileges  were  revoked,  and  he  received  a  letter  of  reprimand.  He  was  found
guilty  of  an  Article  15,  given  extra  duty,  and  suspended  forfeiture  of  pay.  1.f.
In
December  2016,  he  was  administratively  separated  from  the  Army  for  misconduct,
(namely his multiple DUI’s) and he received an Other than Honorable Discharge.  1.g.
In  February  2017,  while  still  on  probation  for  the  offense  in  October  2015,  he  was
arrested  and  charged  with  DUI,  and  Driving  While  License  Suspended  for  DUI,  after
registering a BAC of .08% or higher.  1.h.  In September 2018, while still on probation
and  diversion  for  the  offenses  in  October  2015  and  February  2017,  Applicant  was
arrested  and  charged  with  DUI,  and  Driving  While  License  Suspended  for  DUI,  after
registering a BAC of .08% or higher.  1.i.  In October 2018, while still on probation and
diversion for the offenses in October 2015 and  February 2017, Applicant was arrested
and charged with DUI, and Driving While License Suspended for DUI, after registering a
BAC of .08% or higher.  Applicant states that his criminal conduct occurred because he
was young, immature, and made unwise choices while drinking.  (Answer to SOR.)
In  each  of  the  cases  listed  above,  except  for  the  Spousal  Abuse  and  Child
Endangerment  claim,  Applicant  was  found  guilty  or  pled  guilty  to  the  charge  against
him.  He was either sentenced to pay a fine, complete an alcohol course, and a driver’s
license suspension; or he was placed in a military diversion program; and/or ordered to
complete  an  18  month  Traffic,  Alcohol,  and  Awareness  School  for  multiple  offenders.
(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.)
Guideline H  - Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse
Applicant  has  used  a  variety  of  illegal  drugs  while  possessing  a  security
clearance.  In his answer to the SOR, he admitted using cocaine, but denies ever using
any other illegal drug.  (Answer to SOR.)  He  testified at the hearing  that he  does not

recall  ever  using  any  other  illegal  drug  besides  cocaine.
November  29,  2018,  to  February  27,  2019,  Applicant  voluntarily  entered  an  inpatient
treatment  for  conditions  diagnosed  as  Cocaine  Use  Disorder  (Severe),  Cannabis  Use
Disorder  (Mild),  Stimulant  Use  Disorder  (Moderate),  and  PTSD.
(Tr.  p.  57-69,  and
Government Exhibit 3.)  2.a.  Medical records from the facility reflect that from 2014 until
November  2018,  Applicant  used  cocaine  with  varying  frequency,  including  at  times
daily,  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.  2.b.  From  2012  until  at  least
September  2018,  he  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency,  while  granted  access  to
classified  information.  2.c.  From  June  2018  until  at  least  November  2018,  he  used
methamphetamine  with  varying

Guideline G  - Alcohol Consumption
Applicant’s history of alcohol abuse includes at least six arrests for DUI and one
arrest  for  Underaged  Drinking,  that  all  occurred  between  2015  and  2018.  Applicant’s
excessive  alcohol  abuse  was  the  reason  he  was  administratively  separated  from  the
Army and the reason why he received an “Other than Honorable” discharge.  After his
discharge from the Army, Applicant continued to abuse alcohol.  He enjoyed consuming
alcohol and  would  often  drink  while using  illegal drugs.  He also  abused  alcohol while
possessing  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  denies  ever  showing  up  for  work  late  or
under  the  influence  of  alcohol.  3.b.  However,  medical  records  from  the  treatment
center  indicate  that  on  several occasions  between  2017  and  2018,  he  arrived  to  work
under the influence of alcohol and drugs and on occasion was late for work because of
this overindulgence.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
3.c.  Following  his  last  arrest  for  DUI  in  October  2018,  Applicant  voluntarily
entered  an  Alcohol  and  Drug  treatment  program  for  his  addictions.  Records  from  the
treatment  center  indicate  that  from  November  29,  2018  to  February  27,  2019,  he
received inpatient treatment for 90 days and was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder
(Severe),  among  other  conditions.  (Applicant’s  Exhibit  F,  and  Government  Exhibit  3.)
After  completing  the  inpatient  treatment  program,  he  attended  the  one-year  outpatient
treatment program  and  successfully completed it on November 26, 2019.  (Applicant’s
Exhibit F.)  Applicant stated that he last consumed alcohol on October 16, 2019.  (Tr. p.
53.)  He states that he has been sober for the past four years.  (Tr. p. 54.)  His intent is
to never drink alcohol again.  (Tr. p. 69.)
Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct
Applicant  has  a  history  of  dishonesty.  Recently,  during  his  security  clearance
background  investigation,  he  has  been  dishonest  and  untruthful  in  response  to  the
Government’s questions on his security clearance application, in his interrogatories, and
during  the  interviews  about  his  past  arrests  and  illegal  drug  use  while  possessing  a
security  clearance.  Applicant  admits  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  under  this
guideline, except allegations 4.h., and 4.i.
4.a.  On March 28, 2017, he completed a security clearance application.  Section
15  - Military  History,  asked  him  if  he  was  discharged  from  military  service?  He
answered,  “NO”.  (Government  Exhibit  1.)  This  was  a  false  response.  He  failed  to
disclose  that  he  received  an  “Other  than  Honorable  Discharge”  in  December  2016.
(Government Exhibit 7, and Applicant’s Exhibit F.)
4.b.  Section  22  –  Police  Record,  of  the  same  security  clearance  application
asked the Applicant if in the last seven years he has been issued a summons, citation,
or  ticket  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal  proceeding  filed  against  him?;  has  he  been
arrested  by  any  police  officer  or  sheriff,  marshal  or  any  other  type  if  law  enforcement
official?; has he been charged, convicted, or sentenced of a crime in any court?; has he
been or is currently on probation or parole?; is he currently on trial or awaiting a trial on
criminal charges?  Applicant answered, “NO.”  (Government Exhibit 1.)  This was a false
response.  He  failed  to  disclose  his  extensive  arrest  history  discussed  above.
(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.)
4.c.  Section  23-Illegal Drugs,  of  the  same  security  clearance application asked
the  Applicant  if  in  the  last  seven  years  he  has  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled

response.  He failed to list his illegal drug use discussed above.
4.d.  Section  23  also  asked  the  Applicant  if  he  has  ever  illegally  used  or
otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security
clearance  other  than  previously  listed?  Applicant  answered,  “NO.”
(Government
Exhibit  1.)  This  was  a  false  response.  He  failed  to  list  his  illegal  drug  use  while
possessing a security clearance discussed above.
4.e.  During an interview on April 11, 2019, with an investigator for the Defense
Department,  Applicant  denied  ever  receiving  letters  of  reprimand  while  in  the  Army.
Only  after  being  confronted  by  the  investigator  did  he  admit  to  receiving  the  letters  of
reprimand.  (Government Exhibit 2.)
4.f.  During  the  same  interview  on  April  11,  2019,  with  an  investigator  for  the
Defense  Department,  Applicant  denied  ever  having  any  DUI  arrests,  other  than  the
arrest in October 2015.  Only after being confronted by the investigator did he admit to
this arrest.  (Government Exhibit 2.)
4.g.  During  the  same  interview  on  April  11,  2019,  with  an  investigator  for  the
Defense Department, Applicant denied being arrested for DUI in February 2017.  Only
after  being  confronted  by  the  investigator  did  he  admit  to  this  arrest.
(Government
Exhibit 2.)
4.h.  During an interview on August 9, 2021, with an investigator for the Defense
Department, Applicant stated that he had only used cocaine three times and that he had
never used drugs while possessing a security clearance.  Applicant blatantly lied to the
investigator.  Applicant has actually used cocaine more than three times and has used
a variety of other illegal drugs, including cocaine, while possessing a security clearance.
(Government Exhibit 2.)
4.i.  Applicant  was  asked  to  respond  to  interrogatories  dated  January  3,  2022.
When  asked  to  provide  the  month  and  year  of  his  last  use  of  marijuana/THC,
amphetamine/methamphetamine, and molly/ecstasy, Applicant denied ever using these
drugs  by  answering  “NA.”  (Government  Exhibit  2.)  He  was  not  truthful  in  answering
this question.  In fact, the Applicant’s last use of these illegal drugs is discussed above.
4.j.  On at least five to ten separate occasions between 2016 and 2020, Applicant
drove  a  vehicle  while  knowing  that  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  or  revoked.
(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7.)
Applicant  was  not  truthful  when  he  answered  the  questions  on  his  security
clearance  application  in  Sections  22  and  23  discussed  above.  He  should  have
answered  “Yes.”  He  was  also  not  truthful  during  his  interview  with  the  investigator  in
April 2019,  or in his interrogatories  in  January 2022.  Applicant’s  deliberate attempt  to
deceive  the  Government  is  unacceptable  and  shows  immaturity,  irresponsibility,  and
poor judgment.

to abuse alcohol and drugs in the past.  (Tr. p. 56.)  He believes he is a changed man.
In August 2020, he received full custody of his children and is a very active and involved
father who participates in their lives and extracurricular activities.  (Tr. p. 58.)  He states
that  he  no  longer  associates  with  people  who  abuse  alcohol  and  illegal  drugs.  His
girlfriend  who  has  been  with  him  since  2015,  is  not  a  drug  user,  and  has  been  very
supportive in his sobriety.  (Tr. pp. 73-74.)
Applicant’s  performance  appraisals  for  the  periods  from  May  1,  2020,  through
April  30,  2022,  reflect  ratings  of  “meets  expectations”  and  “exceeds  expectations”  in
every category.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Letters  from  the  Vice  President  of  the  inpatient  treatment  program  dated
February  28,  2019,  and  from  the  Director  of  the  outpatient  treatment  program  dated
June  27,  2019,  and  January  21,  2020,  confirm  that  Applicant  successfully  completed
each  program.  Applicant  was  also  involved  in  the  VA  Substance  Abuse  program  in
January  2020,  and  diagnosed  with  “Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  Chronic,”  with
“alcohol abuse in sustained remission.”  (Applicant’s Exhibit F.)
Applicant  successfully  completed  a  diversion  program  and  three  of  his  DUI
arrests  and  convictions  have  been  dismissed  by  the  court.  (Applicant’s  Exhibit  C,  D,

their   knowledge   or  consent.   One   of  the   victims   notified   the   U.S.  Naval  Criminal
Investigative   Service   (NCIS),  which   opened   an   investigation   into   the   incident.   Based
upon  the  NCIS  investigation, the  Navy charged  him  under the  Uniform  Code  of Military
Justice   (UCMJ)  Article  120c  (other   sexual  misconduct:   indecent  viewing,   visual
recording,  or  broadcasting).   In   2019,  after  a   court-martial,   he   pleaded   guilty   and   was
convicted  of this charge.  He was sentenced  to  eight months confinement  and  reduction
in rank. He was  released  with  a  bad-conduct  discharge.  In SOR ¶  1.a, the  Government
alleged  Applicant’s 2018  behavior  in  taking the  photographs. In SOR ¶  2.a,  it alleged  his
conviction   and   sentence   pursuant   to   UCMJ  Article  120c.   It   also   alleged   a   violation   of
UCMJ  Article  92,  failure  to   obey  an  order  or  regulation   charge   and   conviction   and   his
bad-conduct discharge  in SOR ¶  2.a.  In  the  Answer, Applicant admitted  the  allegations
in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  2.a. His  admissions are adopted  as findings of  fact.  Other than  his
admission,  there  is  no   evidence   of  a   2019   UCMJ  Article   92   charge   or  conviction.   (Tr.
18-21; 27-32;  Answer;  GE 1-3, 6; AE  A)
Applicant claimed that he was going through a bad time between 2015 and 2018.
He  claimed  he  and  his  wife  were  having  marital  problems.  He  claimed  he  was
dissatisfied with his job and did not want to be there. He claimed that there was nothing
sexual about the pictures he took, but that he was acting out to get caught. He thought
that  if  he  got  in  trouble,  the  Navy  would  move  him  to  a  different  role.  He  was  having
trouble  with  his  life  and  did  not  know  how  to  handle  it.  He  claimed  his  time  in
confinement gave him clarity and he is now in a better  place. He claimed that he took
“multiple  hours”  of  behavioral  counseling  where  he  learned  that  he  had post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. He did not specify the dates of his counseling
sessions. He did not provide documentation related to this counseling, a diagnosis, or a
prognosis.  He claimed that he now understands how to  appropriately deal with  stress,
and that he will not engage in this type of behavior again. (Tr. 18-21; Answer)
Sometime  in  the  summer  of  2017,  Applicant  filmed  his  wife  while  she  was
unclothed  in  her  bedroom  without  her  knowledge  or  consent.  He  used  an  iPad  and
filmed  her  through  the  crack  between  her bedroom  door and  the  floor.  He  claimed  he
was  trying  to  catch  her  being  unfaithful  because  he  suspected  she  was  with  another
man. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant filming his wife
without her knowledge or consent, will not be considered for disqualification purposes;
however,  it  may  be  considered  in  assessing an  applicant’s  credibility;  in  evaluating  an
in
applicant’s  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;
considering  whether  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  and  in
applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16,
2017)). (Tr. 32-35; GE 2)
In  about  April  2018,  Applicant  was  counseled  at  work  for  making  inappropriate
comments  to  a  female  colleague  regarding  her  appearance.  His  inappropriate
comments  made  his  female  colleague  feel  uncomfortable,  so  she  filed  a  complaint
against  him.  Applicant’s  supervisor  told  him  that  he  would  be  reassigned  if  anything
similar  happened  again.  The  Government  did  not  allege  this  information  in  the  SOR.
(GE 2)
While  Applicant  claimed  to  be  remorseful  for  his  actions,  he  also  deflected  the
blame and responsibility for his actions to others. He claimed the court-martial process
was  unfair  as  he  was not  allowed  to  tell  his side  of  the  story. He  claimed  that  he  had
been  caught  up  in  the  “Me  Too”  movement  and  was  judged  more  harshly  than
appropriate  because  of  the  timing  of  his  offenses.  He  claimed  that  the  victims  were
coerced  into  requesting  that  he  receive  a  harsher sentence  than  they  otherwise  might
have.  He  also  claimed  that  he  would  not  receive  a  fair  outcome  from  his  security
clearance adjudication. In short, he casts himself as the victim and has not  fully taken
responsibility for his illegal actions. (Answer; AE A)
In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant’s six delinquent financial accounts
totaling  approximately  $29,000  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.f).  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c and 1.e. His admissions are adopted as findings
of  fact.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.f.  Despite  his  denials,  the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f are established by the Government’s 2020, 2021, and
2023 credit reports.  (SOR; Answer; GE 4-7)
The  judgments  entered  in  April  2018  and  January  2020  in  favor  of  Applicant’s
homeowner’s  association  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  3.a  and  3.b  have  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  claimed  that  he  made  a  payment  of  about  $4,000  toward  these  judgments
sometime  in  2022.  He  also  claimed  that  he  is  paying  a  little  bit  extra  towards  these
obligations every month. He provided no documentation to corroborate these payments.
He  is  unsure  how  he  fell  behind  on  payments  to  his  homeowner’s  association  but
suspected his wife was supposed to pay this obligation and failed to do so. He claimed
he will continue to pay a little extra every month until these judgments are resolved. (Tr.

The  delinquent  car  loan  in  the  amount  of  $6,499  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  3.c  has  not
been resolved. Applicant claimed that he fell behind on this loan when he was confined.
He  claimed  his  wife  was  supposed  to  make  payments  on  this  loan  while  he  was
incarcerated but she did not. However, in his November 2020 security interview, he also
claimed  that  he  did  not  want  the  car  any  longer.  He  claimed  that  he  made  payments
again  once  he  was  no  longer  incarcerated,  but  he  was  not  able  to  catch  up  on  his
delinquency.  He  claimed  that  he  will  pay  this  account  through  payment  arrangements
when  he  is  able  to  do  so.  The  2023  credit  report  reflects  a  last  payment  date  of
February 2020. He provided no documentation about the resolution of this debt. (Tr. 20,
38-43, 60-61; Answer; GE 4-7, 9)
The delinquent credit card in the amount of $2,927 alleged in SOR ¶ 3.d has not
been  resolved.  Applicant  claimed that  he  did  not open  this account  and  he  disputed  it
with the credit reporting agencies several times. The account was opened in September
2015. He claimed that his wife had power of attorney for him while he was deployed and
may  have  opened  it  without  his  knowledge.  The  last  time  he  deployed  was  between
February  and  October  2014.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his
disputes  with  the  credit  reporting  agencies  or  the  creditor,  nor  did  he  offer  any  other
resolution  of  this  debt.  The  Government’s  2020,  2021,  and  2023  credit  reports  do  not
reflect  a  dispute  with  respect  to  this  account.  This  account  appears  on  all  three  credit
reports. The 2023 credit report reflects a last payment date of September 2016. (Tr. 20,
40, 43-46, 59-60; Answer; GE 4-7)
The  delinquent  car  loan  in  the  amount  of  $9,909  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  3.e  has  not
been resolved. Applicant claimed that he took out this loan to purchase a car for his wife
because she could not afford to pay for it herself. He opened the account in April 2017
and last made a payment on it in July 2019. He claimed that he did not know the loan
was  delinquent  because  his  wife  was  receiving  the  statements  for  it.  He  also  claimed
that he could not afford to pay for the vehicle, but he agreed to open the account for his
wife  as  an  act  of  kindness.  He  claimed  that  he  will  pay  this  account  through  payment
arrangements when he is able to do so. (Tr. 20, 44-45, 60-61; Answer; GE 4-7)
The  delinquent  telecommunications  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,027  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 3.f has been resolved. Applicant claimed that he did not open this account. He
claimed  that  he  disputed  it  with  the  credit  reporting  agencies.  Although  he  did  not
provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his  dispute,  the  debt  no  longer  appears  on  his
2023 credit report. While this account’s absence on a subsequent credit report could be
for  reasons  other  than  a  favorable  resolution,  his  claimed  dispute,  combined  with  the
absence of the account on a subsequent credit report, provide sufficient evidence of a
favorable resolution. (Tr. 20, 45-47, 58-59)
Applicant  owes  the  IRS  about  $900  in  delinquent  federal  income  taxes  for  the
2018  tax  year.  He  owed  about  $3,000  until  2022,  when  he  made  a  payment  of  about
$2,100. These delinquent federal taxes were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 47-48)
Applicant earns between $83,000 and $84,000 in annual wages. He earns about
$5,200  per  month.  He  receives  a  monthly  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  disability  payment  of
$2,215. While working his part-time job, he also earned about $22 to $23 per hour for
the 16-30 hours per week he worked. He claimed that he has about $4,000 combined in
his  checking  and  savings  account.  He  provided  no  documentation  to  corroborate  his
income,  benefits,  or  account  balances.  He  provided  no  evidence  that  he  has  sought
financial counseling. (Tr. 25-26, 53-58)

"In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  some  of  the  Guideline  G  allegations  in  the
SOR  and  denied  others.  He  failed  to  either admit  or  deny  the  Guideline  J  allegations.
Since the underlying allegations are the same under both Guidelines, he is deemed to
have  admitted  and  denied  the  same  allegations  under  Guideline  J  as  he  did  for
Guideline G. He admitted the Guideline B allegation, with explanations. His admissions
are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  testimony,
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  63  years  old.  He  is  divorced  and  has  two  adult  children.  He  is
currently  employed  by  a  government  contractor.  He  has  worked  for  different
government  or  defense  contractors  as  a  power  plant  technician  on  various  contracts
over the years, dating back to 2010.  Many of these contracts required his presence in
combat  zones,  such  as  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  He  was  honorably  discharged  from  the
Marine  Corps  after  serving  from  1979  to  1985.  He  has  three  associate’s  degrees.  He
held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps and at various times  while serving
as a government-contractor employee. (Tr. 7, 32-34, 39, 41; GE 1; AE A)
The SOR alleged Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) on
eight  occasions:  May 1986;  January 1989; April 1990;  April 1993;  January  2000; April
2001;  February  2002;  and  November  2019.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.h)  Department  Counsel
moved to withdraw the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. That motion was granted
and  those  withdrawals  will  be  reflected  in  my  formal  findings.  This  conduct  was  also
alleged as criminal conduct under Guideline J in the SOR. (SOR ¶ 2.a) Finally, the SOR
alleged that Applicant had a girlfriend who is a resident and citizen of Ethiopia, and for
whom he provided financial support. (SOR ¶ 3.a)
Applicant began drinking alcohol approximately two  times a week when he was
18 or 19 years old after he joined the Marine Corps. In his early 20s to 30s, his alcohol
consumption  increased  to  about  three  to  four  times  a  week.  He  stated  that  during  the
last 10 to 15 years, his alcohol consumption has decreased. He admitted that he would
often drink and become  “buzzed.”  He would drive while  he was ‘buzzed.”  He admitted
driving while drunk more times than when he was arrested. He claimed that he did not
drink  to  intoxication  between  2002  and  2019.  He  also  claimed  the  last  time  he  drank
alcohol was when he was arrested for DWI in November 2019. (Tr. 43-50)
The details of his arrests follow:
May  1986  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.a)-Applicant  testified  that  he  and  friends  were  at  the
beach where he  had four to five beers. He  drove back home from the beach and was
stopped by law enforcement  for a traffic violation. He admitted this arrest  for DWI and
he  claimed  the  charge  was  later  reduced  to  reckless  driving.  He  was  drinking  alcohol
about four times a week at that time in his life. (Tr. 51-52; GE 3-4; SOR answer)
January  1989  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.b)-Applicant  testified  that  he  had  been  at  a party
until  about  4:00  am  and  then  drove  home.  He  was  stopped  by  law  enforcement  for
speeding  and  weaving.  He  was  administered  field  sobriety  tests,  which  he  failed.  He
was  arrested  for  DWI  and  refused  to  take  a  breath  test.  Applicant  admitted  pleading
guilty to a misdemeanor DWI and was sentenced to two years’ probation and fined. (Tr.
53-54; GE 3-5 (pp. 6-7); SOR answer)
April  1993  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.d)-Applicant  denied  this  arrest  in  his  answer  but
admitted  it  during  his  hearing  testimony.  Applicant  was  stopped  by  law  enforcement
after nearly colliding with a police vehicle when entering a service road. Applicant was
observed  by officers to  stagger,  lean on his  vehicle  for  support,  wobble  while  walking,
exhibit  slow  depressed  reflexes,  and  have  “thick”  speech.  Applicant  also  became
belligerent toward the responding officers, which resulted in him being handcuffed. After
transportation  to  the  station,  Applicant  was  administered  field  sobriety  tests.  He
admitted drinking two beers at home. A breath test determined his blood alcohol content
at 0.11, over the legal limit of 0.08. All Applicant’s actions at the police station related to
this arrest were videotaped. He was arrested for DWI. He pleaded not guilty in court but
was convicted of a DWI first offense in September 1993 and received a sentence of two
years’ probation and a fine. (Tr. 59-65; GE 5 (pp.- 1-3); SOR answer)
February 2002  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.g)-Applicant denied  this arrest  in his  answer  but
admitted it during his hearing testimony. He did not recall the details of this arrest. Court
documents reveal that he pleaded guilty and was convicted of DWI in September 2002.
(Tr. 71-72; GE 3 (pp. 10-11); SOR answer)
November  2019   DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.h)-Applicant   admitted   this  arrest  in   both  his
answer  and   his  hearing   testimony.  Applicant  testified   that  he   had   just   returned   from
Afghanistan   and   went   to   a   sports   bar  where   he   had   one   beer.  In   his  SOR  answer   he
admitted  drinking  two  beers. He  was arrested  and  changed  with  DWI-3rd, a  third  degree
felony.   No  police   reports  or  court   disposition   documents  are   in  the   record.  Applicant
claimed   he   pleaded   guilty  to   a   misdemeanor  DWI  charge   and   received   a   sentence   of
probation.  Applicant  presented   documentation   from   his  probation   officer  that  he
complied  with  all  the  conditions of his probation, had  no  probation  violations, and  paid
all   of  his  financial  obligations.  His  probation   terminated   with   him   in   good   standing   in
June  2022. (Tr.  72-76;  GE 3  (p 12); SOR Answer; AE B, E)
Applicant listed in his 2020 security clearance application (SCA) attending court-
ordered alcohol counseling in 1990 and 2001, but he did not supply any documentation
about  either  program  or  detail  what  was  involved  with  these  programs,  in  terms  of
diagnoses, prognoses, or treatment plans. (GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  he  does  not  consider  himself  an  alcoholic,  rather  he  is
“just a person that had bad luck.” He claims to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) about
once a month, but he admitted that he does not have sponsor, nor does he work the AA
12-step  program  recommended  for  recovering  alcoholics.  He  also  claims  he  has  no
further interest in consuming alcohol. As an example, he cited that he recently attended
a family gathering where alcohol was present, but he did not consume any. (Tr. 78-81,
90)
The Guideline B allegation concerns Applicant’s relationship with a woman who
is a citizen and resident of Ethiopia. He admitted having a relationship with this woman
and providing her financial support. He was in contact with her from approximately 2017
to  2019.  He  met  her  when  he  was  in  Ethiopia,  and  she  was  a  receptionist  at  a  hotel.
From 2017  to 2019, he  provided her with approximately $1,000 per month to help  her
and her family. During this time, he was in contact with her on a weekly basis. He visited
her in Ethiopia on several occasions. The last time he was in Ethiopia was in 2019. He
ended  his  relationship  with  this  woman  in  approximately  June  2019,  when  he  came
back to the United States after his job in  Southwest Asia ended. The last contact with
her  was  in  June 2019. The  last  financial support he provided  was  in  August  2019. He
has  no  intentions  of  contacting  her,  seeing  her,  or  providing  any  additional  financial
assistance to her in the future. (Tr. 81-88)
Applicant  presented  six  character  letters  from  friends  and  colleagues.  They
describe  Applicant  as  responsible  and  someone  who  is  dedicated,  hard-working,  and
who  has  high  character.  Several  recommend  continuation  of  his  security  clearance.
Applicant  also  presented  several  awards,  certificates,  and  pictures  demonstrating  his
service to the country over the years. (AE C-D)

"Applicant is 50 years old and has married twice, first in1991 and again in 2018. His
first marriage ended in divorce in 2009. He has four children with his first wife and one
child and a stepchild with his second wife. His second wife, their child, and his stepchild
live in Mexico, and Applicant visits them when he is not working remotely on assignments.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2006 and a master’s degree in business administration
in 2009. Applicant has held a security clearance in the past. Most recently, he was granted
a  security  clearance  in  2009.  He  was  badly  injured  in  a  car  accident  in  late  2006  and
became disabled. He was unable to work full time again until 2017, and he collected social
security disability benefits during his period of unemployment. Since about October 2021
he has worked as a technician for his current employer, a DoD contractor. He is seeking
national security eligibility in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 6-7, 15-22, 46-47; GE 1
at Sections 2, 13A, 13B, 17; and AE A at 1.)
Paragraph 1 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations
is
financially  overextended   and
The  Government alleged  in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for clearance
because   he
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having  to  engage  in illegal acts  to  generate  funds. The  SOR
identifies  12  past-due  debts  that have  been  charged-off  or placed  for collection, totaling
about $120,000  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a  through  1.l). In his Answer, Applicant admitted  seven  SOR
allegations involving  delinquent student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a  through  1.d  and  1.i through
1.k) and  one  credit card debt (SOR ¶ 1.e). He  denied  the  remaining  four allegations (SOR
¶¶   1.f   through   1.h   and   1.l).   The   existence   and   amounts  of   all   of   the   SOR   debts  are
established by credit reports in the record, dated August 23, 2022; September 2, 2021;
February 3, 2021; and January 20, 2023. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 5, and GE 11.)
Applicant’s delinquencies arose during his period of disability. His current job pays
him  a  gross  salary  of  $12,000  per  month,  or  about  $6,000  net.  He  lives  remotely  for
months at a time wherever his job site is located. When he is not working at a jobsite, he
lives in his wife’s home with their child and his stepchild in Mexico. He is paid a per diem
of about $1,500 per month to cover his living expenses when he is working remotely. He
has no mortgage and pays no rent. When he is working out of his employer’s offices in
the  United  States,  he  lives at his brother’s house  during  the  week and  with  his wife  on
weekends. He has about $600 in savings. He is learning how to manage his money. He
claims he is “very wise” with his money and is “consistently” paying off his debts. He is
trying to rebuild his credit score. (Tr. at 21-26; 34-36, 61-63.)
The current status of the debts listed in the SOR is as follows:
1.a  through  1.d  and  1.i  through  1.k.  Federal Student  Loan  Collection Debts
in the  Amounts  of  $23,595, $18,611, $14,441, 14,441, $10,500, $13,312, and $13,31,
respectively.  Applicant testified  that he  is currently paying  these  debts.  He pays $188
per  month   on   all   of  his  student   loans.   I  note   that   Federal  student   loans   have   been   in
forbearance   under  the   COVID-19   moratorium   since   March  2020.   Applicant  has  been
paying  his loans notwithstanding  the  forbearance. (Tr.  at 26-27, 29,  33, 63-68; GE  3  at 8-
9; GE 4 at 2-3; GE 5  at 3, 4, 5, 6; and  GE 11  at 4, 5.)
Applicant  provided  after  the  hearing  detailed  statements  from  one  of  the
Government’s student loan service companies. It appears from these statements that ten
of Applicant’s student loans have been consolidated and are being paid every month from
Applicant’s monthly payments of about $184. The statement marked as AE G also reflects
that Applicant’s monthly payments began February 2022. The statements marked as AE
H reflect that all ten of the loans are Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans
and that the payments are solely being applied to interest accruing on the loans. These
documents support Applicant’s claim that all of the student loans alleged in the SOR are
being paid every month with his single payment.  These debts are in the initial stage of
being resolved. (AE G; AE H.)
1.e.  Charged-Off  Credit-Card  Debt in the  Amount  of  $464.  Applicant credibly
testified  that he  paid  this debt, though  he  is uncertain  when  it was  paid.  The  debt  is listed
in the  February 2021  credit report in  the  record, but not in  any of the  more recent  credit
reports.  This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 27, 65; and GE  5 at 4.)
1.f   through 1.h.   Medical   Debts   in   Collection   in  the   Amounts   of $148,   $109,
and $108, respectively.  Applicant testified  that he  mistakenly  denied  these  debts  in  his
Answer. He  acknowledged  that they  are  his debts  and  credibly testified  that  he  has  paid
them. The debts are  listed in  the February 2021 credit report in the record, but not in any
of the more recent credit reports. These debts are resolved. (Tr. at 27-28, 65; and GE 5
at 5.)
1.l.   Auto   Loan   Debt  in  Collection  in  the   Amount   of   $12,259.   Applicant
purchased  a  vehicle  with a  loan  in  2010.  The vehicle  was stolen  in Mexico when he  took
the  car there  in about 2014. His insurance  company declined  coverage  for the  loss  since
the  loss  occurred  outside  the  United  States  and  was not  covered  by  his U.S. insurance
policy.  Applicant has not repaid the  loan  and  believes it  may have  dropped  off  his credit
report due  to  age. He understands that he  still  owes this debt,  but he  does not know how
to  approach  the  creditor or whatever company owns the  debt at this time.  He asserted
that  he   is  “open”   to   paying   off   the   loan   because   he   wants   to   pay   off   every   debt  he   is
“capable” of paying. This debt is not yet resolved, but  Applicant  intends to  pay it when  he
is able to do so. (Tr. at 29,  45, 68-70; and  GE  5 at 7.)
Applicant also admitted at the hearing that he has not yet filed his 2021 Federal
income tax returns. He claimed he lost the paperwork he needed to  file his return. He
plans to file this tax return when he submits his 2022 return. Applicant was questioned at
the hearing about an unpaid personal loan that was referred to collection in the amount
of $3,209. The debt appeared  in the Government’s January 20, 2023  credit report (GE
11). He took out the loan during a period of unemployment in 2021 and then was unable
to repay it. He paid the debt shortly before the hearing. Neither the un-filed tax return nor
the recent paid collection debt is alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at 49-50, 58-60.)
Paragraph 2 - Guideline J, Criminal Conduct
The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because of his
criminal  conduct,  which  raises  questions  about  his
judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness;  and  about  his  ability  and  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and
regulations.  In  his  Answer  Applicant  admitted  that  he  plead  guilty  to  criminal  charges
during the period 2006 through 2014. The specifics of the charges and guilty pleas are
as follows:
2.a.   Driving  Under  the   Influence   of   Alcohol  (DUI)  in  2006.  Applicant  was
arrested  in 2006  and  charged  with  DUI and  DUI .08% BAC or more. He plead  no  contest
in 2007  to  DUI  0.08%  BAC or  more  and  was  sentenced  to  five  years of  probation  and
fined.   This DUI  charge   arose   out  of  a  bar fight  in   which  Applicant   was  involved   with  a
number of other individuals. He was  intoxicated  at the  time. He drove  away from  the bar
to   flee   the   others  involved   and   had   a   serious  accident.  He   has   experienced   multiple
surgeries  since   that   have   caused   him   to   experience   periods  of   disability  and
unemployment.  Starting  in  2017  he  has  been  healthy enough  to  work full  time.  (Tr. at  22-
23, 37, 51-52; GE 1  at Section 22; GE 8.)
2.b.  False  Imprisonment  and Battery  of  Spouse  in 2010.  Applicant was arrested
in 2010  and  charged  with  False Imprisonment  and  Battery of Spouse. He plead  guilty to
Battery  of  Spouse  and  was sentenced  to  five  days in  jail and  three  years of  probation.  He
was on probation at the time due to his 2006 sentence for DUI  .08% BAC or more, as
noted above. The incident that gave rise to Applicant’s arrest in 2010 came at a time when
his first marriage was ending. His then-wife accused Applicant of picking her up by her
neck and throwing her against the wall. He denied the allegation at his security clearance
hearing stating that he was recovering from back surgery three or four weeks earlier and
could not physically have done what he was accused of doing. He also testified that he
pled guilty to avoid a six-month jail sentence. The reduced sentence “played a major role”
in his decision to plead guilty to the charge of Battery of Spouse.  He conceded that he
lied to the criminal court judge by pleading guilty and admitting the offense, which he now
denies  committing.  He  further explained  that  he  was  experiencing  a  lot  of  pain  from  a
recent surgery and was not “thinking straight” at the time of his guilty plea. (Tr. at 37-39,
52-56, 77-78; GE 1 at Section 22; and GE 6 at 5-6.)
2.c. DUI and DUI within Ten Years of Prior DUI Conviction. In 2014 Applicant
was arrested again for DUI. He pled guilty to DUI within Ten Years of Prior DUI Conviction.
He  was  sentenced  to  five  years  of  probation  and  fined.  This  incident  occurred  after
Applicant lost custody of his children. A consequence of his conviction on that charge was
that Applicant’s  license  was  suspended for a  period. He  has never sought to have  his
license  reinstated.  He  does  not  currently  have  a  driver’s  license.  He  takes  public
transportation instead. (Tr. at 40-42, 56-57; GE 1 at Section 22; and GE 6 at 7; GE 7.)
Mitigation
Applicant is trying to become financially stable and pay his debts that arose during
his disability. He has provided a list of his assets and liabilities. His assets include about
$4,000  of  investments  in  certificates  of  deposits.  His  liabilities  include  a  car  loan  on  a
vehicle he purchased for his wife in Mexico. He also provided evidence of an investment
portfolio with a value of about $3,200. In addition, he provided evidence of a whole-life
insurance policy in the face amount of $100,000 that he purchased in November 2022.
With respect to his unfiled Federal tax return for tax year 2021, he provided an IRS Wage
and Tax Statement for 2021 that provides him with the necessary information to file his
return, though the return will be filed late. (AE C through F.)

Guideline J – Criminal Conduct
Guideline E – Personal Conduct
The  SOR  alleges  twenty-one  charges,  arrests  or  both,  spanning  most  of
Applicant’s early adult life, beginning in 1988, and continuing until 2010.  They include
numerous  crimes  such  as  Theft,  Robbery,  Burglary,  Possession  of  Narcotics,  Open
Container  in  Public,  and  others,  related  to  his  history  of  drug  and  alcohol  abuse,  and
addiction.  These  crimes  resulted  in  convictions,  and  Applicant  either  spent  time  in
county  jail  or  in  prison  to  satisfy  the  sentencing  requirements  for  these  violations.
Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  (Applicant’s Answer to
SOR.)  His  criminal  attorney  is  currently  working  to  expunge  his  criminal  record.
(Applicant’s Exhibits A and B.)
In  1988,  Applicant  was  28  or  29  years  old  when  he  began  having  drug  and
alcohol problems.  He explained that his mother raised him with his grandmother, and
they lived together.  It was about this time that his grandmother, with whom he was very
close, passed away.  Applicant suffered from severe depression and went in the wrong
direction.  He  started  using  illegal  drugs  like  marijuana,  cocaine,  and  alcohol  and  as
time passed he became addicted.  To support his drug and alcohol habit, he would steal
things like clothes out of people’s garages.  As time passed and his habit increased, he
had to steal more frequently to maintain his habit.  Following each arrest and conviction,
he  served  time  in  jail,  anywhere  from  several  weeks  to  several  months;  and  on  two
occasions, he went to prison.  He estimates that he spent a total of about seven years
of his life incarcerated for his criminal acts.  (Tr. pp. 33-34.)

go  to  college  and  educate  himself  on  his  past  behavior.  He  attended  Charles  Drew
University and became a Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselor.  (Applicant’s Exhibit E.)
He then acquired the experience he needed by working for various agencies, including
a  local  hospital’s  substance abuse detoxication unit, and a mental health  ward, before
he opened his own program.  His program was, for the most part, funded by the county
to  help  those  suffering  from  substance  abuse.  He  became  very  successful  for  many
years from 1999 to 2014.  During that period, he worked closely with the Department of
Mental Health and other contractor programs throughout the area and provided help to
many individuals in the community addressing their substance addictions and educating
them about their disease.  The last place he had was a 35-bed men’s facility for alcohol
and drug recovery that also provided all meals and other necessities.  His goal was to
make sure  that  people would get off  the street and had a place  to live  that addressed
their mental health issues and their addictions.  Many people came from various jails, or
were  simply  down  on  their  luck  and  needed  help.  Applicant  was  eventually  forced  to
close  his  program  due  to  county  budgetary  cuts  and  changes  that  eliminated  the
financial support for these programs.  (Tr. p. 24, and Applicant’s Exhibit D.)

Appellant  explained  that  about  ten  years  ago,  he  did  not  file  his  income  tax
returns on time or pay his taxes as he  should  have for  several  years.  As a  result, he
has owes a large amount of money to the tax authorities for delinquent back taxes.  He
is  now  trying  to  address  these  issues.  To  stay  in  their  good  graces,  he  recently
contacted both taxing authorities and set up a monthly installment payment plan of $150
monthly that he pays to the State and to the Federal Government respectively.  To date,
he has made two payments of $150 to each tax authority.  It is his understanding that
$100,000 of his Federal tax debt will fall off of his credit report in April 2023, and will no
longer be collectible.  Once that  occurs, he will  begin to address  the  remainder owed.

"Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active
duty  in  the  U.S.  military  from  2002  until  he  was  discharged  with  a  bad  conduct
discharge  in  2017.  He  has  worked  for  defense  contractors  since  2017.  He  has  an
associate degree earned in 2017. He is single with four children. (GE 3-5, 9)
Applicant  was  an  E-7  in  2014  when  he  committed  the  offenses  that  resulted  in
multiple  charges  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ).  The  charges,  for
violations of Article 90 (disobey lawful order of commissioned officer); four specifications
of  Article  92  (fail  to  obey  general  order:  fraternization);  Article  107  (false  official
statement);  and  three  specifications  of  Article  128  (two  specifications  of  assault  by
battery, and one specification of aggravated assault), were referred to a general court-
martial. (GE 3-5, 9, 10)
In  2015,  pursuant  to  a  pretrial  agreement,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  all  of  the
charges  and  specifications,  except  the  aggravated  assault  specification,  to  which  he
pleaded  not  guilty.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  the  two  assault  specifications  by  unlawfully
touching the victim. He was sentenced to reduction to E-1, confinement for six months,
and  a  bad  conduct  discharge.  His  pretrial  agreement  limited  his  confinement  to  120
days and his reduction to E-4. (GE 3-5, 9)
Applicant  described  the  offenses  during  his  background  interview  and  in  his
response  to  the  SOR.  He  admitted  to  having  inappropriate  relations  with  four  junior
servicemembers. He described the assaults:
I got in an  argument with  a  [servicemember]  I was seeing  at  the  time  and
she   grabbed   my  truck   keys  and   would   not  give  them   back  so   I  grabbed
her by the  wrist and  opened  her  hand  to  get  them  so  I  could  leave  and  it
bruised   her  wrist.  Another  time   [we   were]  having   consensual  sex   and   I
grabbed  her a  bit too  hard and rough  and I left bruises  on  her that way.
Applicant  admitted  that  he  lied  during  the  investigation  into  the  charges,  stating,  “[t]he
only  reason  I  lied  was  because  I  was  so  scared  of  what  might  happen  to  me  and  my
[military] career.” He stated that the Article 90 occurred because his commanding officer
“was messing with [his] platoon and wanted them to do unsafe acts and [Applicant] told
him no in a not so respectful manner.”  That is an inaccurate description of the charge.
The charge was actually a violation of an order for Applicant to have no contact with one
of the servicemembers involved in the fraternization. (GE 3, 9, 10)
Applicant  was  unemployed  for  about  18  months  after  his  court-martial.  He  was
likely  on  unpaid  appellate  leave  after  his  release  from  confinement  until  his  discharge
was approved in 2017. (GE 4, 5)

responsible  for  the  $11,943  debt.  He  did  not  explain  why  the  military  would prosecute
him and discharge him with a bad conduct discharge and then turn around and pay his
personal loan. (GE 3, 5-8)

documented  that  he  entered  a  payment  arrangement  with  the  bank  in  March  2022  to
resolve  the  debt  by  monthly  payments  of  $25.  He  did  not  provide  proof  of  any
payments. (GE 3, 5-8)

$292 debt to an insurance company. The debts are listed on the April 2020 credit report,
but  not  the  later credit reports.  Applicant  stated  that he  attempted multiple  calls  to  the
agencies collecting the debts to make payment arrangements, but the agencies did not
return  his  calls.  He  stated  that  he  would  continue  his  attempts  to  reach  the  agencies
and resolve the debts. (GE 3, 5-8)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
February  2020.  He  reported his general court-martial conviction.  He  answered  “No”  to
all of the financial questions under Section 26, which included the following:
In the  last  seven  (7) years, [have]  you  had  bills or debts  turned  over to  a
collection   agency?   (Include   financial  obligations  for  which   you   were  the

Applicant stated that he did not intend to lie on the SF 86. He stated that he had
not kept up to date on his finances, and he did not know where to look or how to find the
information. (GE 3)
Applicant  expressed  remorse  for  his  conduct  in  the  military.  He  stated  that  he
made stupid choices when he was younger, and he has to live with them every day. He
stated that he is growing more and more, and he is just trying to make a better life for

After  his  then-spouse  discovered  that  he  had  been  having  an  affair,  she  repeatedly
telephoned him to provoke an admission while secretly recording their conversation. He
threatened  her  during  one  such  telephone  conversation,  after  she  told  him  that  she
would leave with all his possessions and he would never again see their daughter. She
reported  him  and  provided  the  recording  to  his  command.  He  admitted  guilt.  He  was

In  approximately  May  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  felony
wanton  endangerment,  first  degree,  police  officer,  after  a  handgun  was  pointed  at  a
police officer. This incident occurred while Applicant was visiting his mother, who lived
with  his  brother,  in  a  different  state  than  his  state  of  residence.  One  night,  after  his
brother  returned  from  socializing  with  friends,  Applicant  and  his  brother  consumed
alcohol together at his brother’s home. They then went to a bar, where they continued to
consume  alcohol,  and  then  they  went  to  eat  at  a  restaurant.  Applicant’s  brother drove
them to the bar and restaurant in Applicant’s brother’s car. (SOR ¶ 1.b; Answer; Tr. at

Applicant’s  then-girlfriend  and  her  friend  arrived  at  the  same  restaurant  shortly
after Applicant and his brother. His brother and then-girlfriend began arguing with each
other. She and Applicant exited the restaurant to sit in her car, and Applicant’s brother
continued  to  argue  with  her.  Applicant’s  brother  learned  that  she  was  cheating  on
Applicant while Applicant was away. Applicant broke his then-girlfriend’s passenger side
window  and  then  went  to  sit  inside  his  brother’s  car.  Applicant’s  brother  continued  to
argue with Applicant’s then-girlfriend and her friend, and a bystander allegedly pulled a
knife out on Applicant’s brother in defense of Applicant’s then-girlfriend and her friend.
Applicant’s brother then came to his car and retrieved a handgun that, unbeknownst to
Applicant, was inside the car. When Applicant’s brother walked  towards the restaurant
with  the  handgun,  Applicant  immediately  began  running  to  his  brother’s  house.  He
heard someone say they were calling the police, so he used the back streets  to avoid
the police. He knew he was intoxicated. (SOR ¶ 1.b; Answer; Tr. at 24-25, 27-40, 44-51,

When  Applicant  arrived  at  his  brother’s  home,  he  knocked  on  the  doors  and
windows to  wake up his mother  so that  she could  let him  in.  He  then  went  inside  and
locked  the  door  behind  him.  Soon  after, there  was  a  knock  on  the  door. Applicant  did
not open the door. He asked who it was and attempted to look through a window at the
top of the door to  see who  was  there. The knocking continued  and  Applicant knocked
back. Applicant testified:
They  kept  doing  whatever  I  -- whatever  I  did.  They  wouldn’t  answer,
wouldn’t tell me who they were. They weren’t saying anything. They would
just  knock and they  wouldn’t stop. I  told them  to go away. They  wouldn’t
go away.
(Tr. at 33-36)
Applicant  then  cracked  the  door  open  while  pointing  his  vaping  device  and
sweeping it back and forth, from left to right, so that it looked like a gun. At the hearing,
he  denied  it  was  a  gun  and  maintained  he  did  not  possess  a  gun.  He  then  heard,
“police,  drop  the  gun  or  we’ll  shoot,”  so  he  threw  the  vape  on  the  ground  outside  the
door  and  slammed  it  shut.  Applicant’s  brother  arrived  and  informed  the  police  officers
that Applicant had pointed a vape out the door. Applicant obeyed the officers’ orders to
come out of the home and he was arrested. The police swept his brother’s home, and
with his brother’s assistance, found a handgun in the cabinet beneath the kitchen sink.
The  police  report  noted  that  this  handgun  belonged  to  Applicant’s  brother,  and  it
matched  the  handgun  that  was  pointed  out  the  door.  Unbeknownst  to  Applicant,
Applicant’s  brother  had  driven  home  while  Applicant  was  running  from  the  restaurant
and put his handgun underneath the kitchen sink then left. Applicant’s brother returned
to the home when Applicant’s mother telephoned him to tell him that the police were at
the home looking for him. (SOR ¶ 1.b; Answer; Tr. at 24-25, 27-40, 44-51, 53-54; GE 3,

because  he  lived  and  worked  in  a  different  state,  and  he  already  missed  work  for  his
time spent in jail. He was prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm for two years.
He complied with the terms of his plea. He reported this incident to his supervisor and

because “I can’t get in trouble. . . . I don’t want to get in trouble.” He still sees his brother
on the occasions when he visits his mother, and he stated that his brother is on a better
path. Applicant stated that he takes care to not put himself in similar situations, he does
not frequent bars, and he does not associate with people who exhibit reckless behavior.
If he were to find himself in a risky situation, he stated that he would endeavor to find a
safe way out of it and recognized that he should have taken an Uber or taxi to a safe
friend  or  family’s  residence.  He  testified  that  he  received  favorable  performance
evaluations  from  his  previous  and  current  employers  who  are  DOD  contractors.  He
stated  that  he  has  received  performance-based  promotions  yearly  from  his  current
employer,  and  he  earned  $93,000  annually  as  of  the  date  of  the hearing,  an  increase

"In  Applicant's  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  2.b,  and  4.b.  He

explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  aviation  mechanic  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since July 2005. (Item 2 at 7, 13.) He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item 2

April  2017  arrest and charge  of  possession  of  marijuana  (SOR ¶¶  1.a, 2.a, 4.a
and 4.c). Applicant admitted in his Answer to being arrested and charged with possession
of  marijuana.  In  his  SCA  he  admitted  to  pleading  guilty  to  possession  of  a  controlled
substance and noted that the possession of marijuana charge was dropped. He stated in
his SCA that “there is a plea of guilty as I was not allowed to plead no contest.” (Item 2 at
27-28.) He was sentenced to 18 months of community supervision, to participate in 50
hours of community service, and pay a fine of $968. (Item 2 at 26, 27, 28, and  29.) He
stated in his background interview he did not know the entirety of what he was charged
with  possessing  but  then  admitted  he  pled  guilty  because  he  was  advised  he  was
fortunate to not have a felony charge. (Item 3 at 5-6.) He states in his SCA this charge
was false and the person who accused him of sexual assault could not recant this offense
because they could risk being charged with a crime. (Item 2 at 37.)
April   2017   use   and/or  possession  of   marijuana   with   vary   frequency   while
granted access   to   classified information   (SOR  ¶¶ 1.b, 4.a).
Applicant pled guilty  to
possession of marijuana in his residence. (Item 2 at 9.) The police recovered a bag of
marijuana  in  plain  view,  along  with  a  water  bong in  the  master  bedroom.  The  police
recovered a vaporizer bong hidden behind a closed master bathroom door. (Item 4 at 57.)
The police deployed a trained narcotics dog who alerted in several areas of the home and
Applicant’s  vehicle.  (Item  4  at  16,  57.)  The  police  recovered  marijuana  in  the  kitchen
refrigerator, kitchen freezer, and in a downstairs bedroom. The police also recovered drug
paraphernalia.  Applicant  states  in  an   interrogatory  response   that  “any  and   all
paraphernalia  was isolated  to  back room  where [his girlfriend] was allowed  to  smoke  only
and outside.” (Item  3  at 2.) He  said  he  was not aware  of the marijuana  in  the  refrigerator
until it was reported  to  him. (Item  3  at 2.)  He initially denied  knowledge  of any drugs in his
home  until the  interviewing  agent asked  about the  drugs found  in  plain  view. (Item  3  at
5.)  The  arrest complaint was for a  “State  Jail  Felony” in the  1st  degree  for the  marijuana
seized  in freezer. (Item  4  at 38.) A  second  arrest complaint,  for a  class A  misdemeanor.
was issued  for other forms of  marijuana  found  in the  house. (Item  4  at 40.)  Applicant  was
ordered  as part of his sentence  to  participate  in the  state’s  drug  offender program. (Item
2   at  28.)  During   his background   interview   he   told  the   investigator he   pled   guilty  to   the
misdemeanor charges  in 2018  to  avoid being  charged  with  felony offenses.  (Item  3  at 6.)
He stated  he  passed  his employer’s drug  tests. (Item  at 6.)  He was granted  a  clearance
in July 2011. (Item 2 at 32.)
April  2017  arrest and  charges of  aggravated assault with a  deadly  weapon
and sexual assault.  (SOR ¶  2.b, and, as  to  the  arrest and charge  of  sexual assault,
SOR  ¶   3.a)  Applicant  admitted  to  being  arrested  and  charged  for  the  offenses  of
aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and sexual assault. He denied the underlying
conduct,  noting  that  the  alleged  victim  recanted  her  statement  and  that  the  grand  jury
returned a “No Bill.” (Answer). The alleged victim reported the sexual assault in April 2017
and told the police the incident took place in March 2017. The police officer noted while
taking the statement the alleged victim described an assault with a pistol that had taken
place in January 2017. (Item 4 at 57.) Police recovered two firearms in an upstairs workout
room closet with various magazines as well as a 9mm pistol with one magazine loaded.
(Item 4 at 57-58.) The inventory description lists two locations where the 9mm pistol was
recovered, the vehicle’s side door pocket and the upstairs workout room. (Item 4 at 58.)
The grand jury returned a “No Bill” on both charges. (Item 2 at 28.)
SOR  ¶   4.b:   failed  to   report  [or]  failed  to   fully   disclose   to   Facility   Security
Officer.  Applicant admitted in his Answer and during his background interview he did not
fully  disclose  the  sexual assault  allegation  when  asked.  (Item  3  at 6.)  He  states  in  his
Answer he thought because the security officer was a woman, and by her demeanor, he
was being judged. In his Answer, he admits he did not fully disclose because he did not
know  how  to  explain  to  the  woman  “what  did  not  happen  versus  what  was  already
implied.” In his Answer he states he did call the same day because he knew he needed
to relay what he did not provide and explain why he felt intimidated. He requested a male
security officer be at next meeting. He adds he provided all the information he failed to
provide at the next meeting. During his background interview he told the investigator he
would have reported the additional charges at the correct time had the security official
been a male. (Item 3 at 6.)
SOR ¶  4.c: Failure  to  disclose  April  2017  drug arrest on his  SCA.  Applicant
denied  he  deliberately  falsified  his  answer  to  Question  23  of  his  SCA,  which  asked
whether  he  had  used  or  otherwise  been  illegally  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled
substance not previously listed, on the basis he had already addressed the April 2017
incident in the SCA. He addressed the conduct in his SCA responses. (Item 2 at 27-28.)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  he  did  not  provide  any  updated
evidence  to  be  considered  in  mitigation.  He  also  provided  no  character  evidence  for
consideration under the whole-person concept.

Within the last five years, Applicant began having issues with alcohol. When he
returned from Army deployments, he was finishing a bottle of tequila in one or two days
to deal with stress. In June or July 2018, after speaking about his alcohol use with his
non-commissioned  officer  (NCO),  he  enrolled  in  the  Army’s  Substance  Use  Disorder
Clinical Care (SUDCC). His NCO gave him the choice of self-enrolling in SUDCC, or his
NCO  would  refer  him.  While  he  was  enrolled  in  SUDCC,  he  was  required  to  abstain
from consuming alcohol. He met with his SUDCC counselor once every two weeks from
June  or  July  2018  until  he  stopped  his  SUDCC  treatment  in  May  2019  when  he  was
discharged  from  the  Army.  He  provided  no  evidence  that  he  has  undergone  any
alcohol-related  treatment  since  May  2019.  He  did  not  complete  the  SUDCC  treatment
program, but in October 2018, he completed a portion of that treatment called Prime for
Life. There is no evidence as to what treatment or counseling the Prime for Life portion
of the SUDCC entailed. (Items 2, 3, 6, 9, 10)
In  about  November  2018,  while  he  was  attending  SUDCC  treatment  and  was
required to abstain from alcohol, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under
the influence of alcohol (DUI) in State A. He had been consuming wine, tequila, and rum
at  a  social  gathering  until  he  blacked  out.  While  he  was  blacked  out  from  being
intoxicated, he drove his car and “wrecked the car between a tree and a boat dock near
a lake.”  Police gave him a breathalyzer test some hours after he had stopped drinking
and he had a .13 blood alcohol content (BAC) percentage. He spent two days in jail. As
part  of  a  plea  agreement,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  a  lesser  charge  of  reckless  driving.
Applicant  paid  fines  and  attended  a  court-ordered  Mothers  Against  Drunk  Driving
(MADD) meeting. He also received an official memorandum of reprimand from his Army
command.  He  continued  to  attend  treatment  with  SUDCC  after  his  November  2018
arrest, when he was again required to abstain from alcohol. (Items 2-6, 9, 10)
In  about  March  2019,  while  Applicant  was  undergoing  SUDCC  treatment  and
required to abstain from alcohol, he was arrested and charged with DUI in State B. He
had  been  drinking  alcohol  at  a  cookout  the  day  before  his  arrest.  He  claimed  that  he
initially did not know the punch he was drinking at the cookout was laced with alcohol,
but  he  acknowledged  that  he  realized  it  had  alcohol  in  it  that  night  when  he  became
intoxicated.  The  next morning,  he  drove  to work  on  base  and  was  stopped  by  military
police  for  swerving.  He  claimed  that  he  was  trying  to  avoid  potholes  because  he  was
driving a friend’s car. He failed field sobriety tests and was issued a breathalyzer test at
about 9:00 a.m., the results of which were a .13 BAC percentage. He pleaded guilty to
DUI. The court sentenced him to 12 months of probation, suspended his driver’s license
in State B, and ordered him to perform 24 hours of community service. Because he was
intoxicated while on duty, the Army charged him under Article 112 of the Uniform Code
of Military Justice (UCMJ). On April 9, 2019, he was found guilty of that UCMJ charge.
As  a  result  of  his  failure  to  follow  SUDCC  requirements,  his  DUIs,  and  his  UCMJ
charges, he was administratively separated from the Army in May 2019 for misconduct.

that he drinks about one or two beers two to three times every two weeks. He claimed
that he tries to stay away from liquor. He cites to his three years of not having alcohol-

Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity,”  by  failing  to  disclose  his  participation  in  drug
programs  in  2007.  He  avers,  credibly,  that  he  “misunderstood  the  question,”  and
“inadvertently answered it incorrectly.” (Answer at page 3.) Applicant has since become
“a manager of the program.” (TR at page 35 line 23 to page 36 line 14, and Answer at
page  3.)  His  character  and  credibility  in  this regard  are  supported  by  those  who  know
Applicant in the workplace. (AppX A.)
",True
"Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged that in 1999 or 2000, Applicant was arrested
and charged with driving under the influence (DUI), for which he was placed on probation
for  one  year  (SOR  1.a);  and  that  in  June  2003,  he  was  charged  with  being  under  the
influence of a controlled substance (SOR 1.b). It also was alleged that in December 2003,
he was charged with vehicle theft, burglary, and hit-and-run resulting in death or injury,
for which he was sentenced to three years in jail (SOR 1.c); and that in August 2005, he
was charged and convicted of receiving stolen property, for which he served 120 days in
jail and was placed on probation for 36 months (SOR 1.d). The SOR further alleged that
in March 2006, Applicant participated in a murder by stabbing the victim and helping to
dispose of the body (SOR 1.e). It was further alleged that in May 2016, he was charged
and later convicted of petty theft and placed on probation for 36 months (SOR 1.f); and
that in December 2016, he was charged and later convicted of trespassing and larceny,
for which he was placed on probation for nearly 12 months (SOR 1.g).
Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations without comment. In addition to the
facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.
Applicant is a 42-year-old long haul truck driver employed by a defense contractor.
He has worked for his current employer since November 2020. He and his wife, who is
his driving partner, have been married since July 2017. They currently live in State A after
relocating in 2016 from State B, where Applicant grew up.  They completed their driver
training  and  received  their  commercial  driver’s  licenses  in  State  A  between  June  and
August 2018. Thereafter, they ran their own trucking business, while also driving for at
least three other companies. They stopped driving independently in October 2020 when
it became difficult, in part because of the COVID pandemic, to get enough loads to cover
their insurance. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 31 – 33, 35)
Applicant was underage when he was arrested for DUI in either 1999 or 2000. He
had been at a party with friends and claims to have had little to drink. He was stopped at
a police checkpoint on the way home and administered a breathalyzer test. It showed he
had  alcohol  in  his  system,  albeit  far  less  than  the  legal  limit  for  intoxicated  driving;
however, because he was under 21 years old, he was charged with DUI. The court fined
him, required him to  complete an alcohol safety and awareness program  (ASAP), and
placed him on probation for one year. (Answer; Tr. 39 – 41)
As alleged in SOR 1.b, on June 9, 2003, Applicant was charged with being under
the influence of a controlled substance. Aside from an entry in the FBI report admitted as
GX 3, little else is known about what the substance was or under what circumstances he
came to be charged. Nor is there any information about the disposition of the charge. In
his personal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator in December 2020,
he denied the arrest. In response to the SOR, he admitted the allegation; however, based
on  his  testimony,  it  appeared  that  he  was  unclear  about  what  he  was  admitting.  At
hearing, he testified he does not specifically recall such an incident, but allowed that he
“was probably under the influence at the time of one of [his other arrests].” (Answer; GX
2; GX 3; Tr. 41 – 45)
One  night  in  December 2003,  Applicant  was  stranded  without a  way  home  and
found an unlocked car in which he spent the night. The next morning, he saw someone
leave a different car running unattended and stole it. As he was driving away, he crashed
into a telephone pole and left the scene, only to be apprehended a short time later. He
was convicted of vehicle theft and hit and run, for which he was sentenced to 36 months
in jail, but served only about three months and spent the rest of his sentence on probation.
(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; GX 8; Tr. 45 – 47)
In August 2005, Applicant was arrested for having vehicle registration tabs from
another car. He had stolen them a few months earlier and put them on his own car. He
did so because he could not afford to renew his vehicle registration. He subsequently was
charged with felony receipt of stolen property and forging or altering a vehicle registration.
He was convicted of receipt of stolen property and sentenced to 120 days in jail. On March
2,  2006,  after  his  incarceration,  he  was  placed  on  another  36  months  of  probation
because he had violated his earlier probation from his December 2003 arrest. (Answer;
GX 2; GX 3; GX 5; Tr. 48 – 49)
In  March  2006,  Applicant  began  a  live-in  relationship  with  a  woman  (S)  he  met
after he was released from jail. The couple lived in a recreational vehicle (RV) on property
owned by C. At some point, S also developed a romantic relationship with V, someone
known  for  his  violent  behavior.  S  and  V  started  taking  money  from  C’s  bank  account.
Unbeknownst  to  Applicant,  S  and  V  then  conspired  to  kill  C  to  cover  up  their  crimes
against  C.  Applicant  saw  S  and  V  stab  C  to  death  outside  the  RV  on  C’s  property.
Applicant feared V, who threatened Applicant with death if he did not also stab C even
though  he  was  dead.  V  also  forced  Applicant  to  bury  the  body,  and  threatened  to  kill
Applicant if he told anyone what had happened. The police eventually became aware that
C was missing. After locating the body, Applicant, S, and V were arrested and charged
with  murder.  Applicant  was  incarcerated  for  six  years  awaiting  trial.  In  2012,  he  was
acquitted in a separate jury trial, and he testified against S and V, both of whom were
convicted and are currently serving life sentences. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 49 – 63)
In  May 2016, Applicant  stole an  electronic device from  a  department store. He was
stopped by the store’s security personnel and returned the item. He then fled the scene
in his  car, but  store security recorded  his license  plate, and  he  was  promptly  arrested.
Thereafter, while awaiting  prosecution  for a  shoplifting  charge, he and  his wife moved to
their   current  state   of  residence.  In   December  2016,  in  State   A,  Applicant  and   his  wife
were   arrested   and   charged   with   trespassing,  burglary  of   an   unoccupied   dwelling,   and
larceny. Around  one  a.m.  on  December 20, 2016, Applicant and  his wife  were  together
when,  over  her objections, he  stole  a  tire  from  a  dumpster  on  the  property of  an  auto  parts
store to  replace  one  of  the  tires  on  his  car that had  failed.  It  appears that this arrest and
his May  2016   shoplifting   charge   were   resolved   together by  a   court   in  State   A.  In   April
2019, he  agreed to  a plea deal whereby,  he was given 36  months of  probation, which he
completed in April 2022. (Answer; GX  2; GX  3; GX 4; GX 6; GX 7; Tr. 63  –  70)
After  their  arrests  in  December  2016,  and  after  brief  periods  of  pre-trial
confinement  in  2017,  Applicant  and  his  wife  found  themselves  homeless.  They
subsequently  found  food  and  shelter  a  nearby  Christian  ministry.  They  stayed  on  to
volunteer to help other homeless persons and have been active in that ministry ever since.
Applicant credits the ministry with helping him get back on his feet and get started in the
trucking industry. Two other members of that organization testified that Applicant is now
reformed and committed to the  ministry’s cause, which  he  and  his  wife  espouse  when
they  are  on  the  road  for  long  stretches.  The  witnesses  recommended  Applicant  for  a
position of trust based on their assessments of him as reliable and honest. (Tr. 34, 36 –
38, 77 – 86, 97 – 105)
For his part, Applicant blames his long history of misconduct on being young and
stupid. A friend from high school, who has known Applicant for over 25 years, testified for
Applicant and believes him to be reliable and someone who follows the rules. He, too,
remarked on conduct Applicant engaged in when he was younger and believes that he
now is more mature. Applicant’s wife testified that she has seen growth in Applicant since
they met, but she acknowledged that someone over 30 years old should not use “young
and dumb” as an excuse for the decisions they make. (Tr. 87 – 96, 105 – 126)
Applicant’s employer states that he is a reliable employee. His sister and stepfather
also support Applicant’s request for a clearance, stating that he is hardworking, reliable,
and has learned from his mistakes. (AX A and B)

During his background interview in February 2021, Applicant stated that he was
in a car with three friends, when two of his friends decided to burglarize an electronics
store. He stated that he and one of the friends did not want to be involved and stayed in
the  car  while  his  two  friends  burglarized  the  store.  He  confirmed  the  accuracy  of  the
interview in his undated response to interrogatories. At his hearing, he admitted that he

Applicant was arrested in 2004 and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI)
and reckless driving. He pleaded no contest to the DWI charge, and the reckless driving
charge was dismissed. (Tr. at 38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
Applicant was arrested in 2008 and charged with DWI, second offense. He was
found guilty and received probation.  He stated that he was stopped by the police after
he left bars in 2004 and 2008. He felt like he was in control during both occasions, and
that he could operate a vehicle. (Tr. at 38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4)
Applicant worked for a computer company for several years until he was laid off
in 2016. He stated that for about three years, he would take  damaged hard drives and
other pieces of computer equipment out of the company’s bin where the equipment was
placed  to  be  recycled.  He  stated  that  he  sold  the  equipment  as  scrap  to  a  recycling

items.  The  theft  was  discovered  after  the  recycling  company  sold  the  parts to  another

Applicant  was  arrested  in  April  2017  and  charged  with  theft  of  property  greater
than or equal to $30,000 and less than $150,000. He received a deferred adjudication in
January  2019  in  which  he  would  be  on  community  supervision  (probation)  for  seven
years, and he is required to pay $32,000 in restitution, costs, and fees. He is eligible for
early termination from probation after four years if the restitution is completed.  He was
paying $600 per month, but he had to decrease the payments when he was laid off in
May 2022. He made a $500 payment in January 2023. He paid a total of $21,965 and
still owes $8,265. (Tr. at 17-23, 33-37, 42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE I,

Applicant  has  been  unemployed  since  he  was  laid  off  in  May  2022.  He  stated
that he does contract work, and he had periods between contracts when he was unable
to pay his debts. (Tr, at 20-21, 24, 48-49; GE 2, 6-8)
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts. However, the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.b
and 3.c are duplicate accounts. The non-duplicate debts are established through credit
reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant asserted that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 3.a ($6,477), 3.b ($4,798), and 3.c
($3,001) are duplicate accounts. As indicated above, SOR ¶¶ 3.b and 3.c are duplicate
accounts, but the evidence does not support that SOR ¶ 3.a is a duplicate account. The
names,  amounts,  and  account  numbers  are  all  different.  The  SOR  ¶  3.a  account  is
listed  on  all  of  the  credit  reports  in  evidence.  Applicant  provided  pages  from  what
appears  to  be  a  credit  report  to  support  his  position,  but  the  documents  show  the
opposite. He wrote that the pages show that he paid $79% of the loan, and the account
was closed in May 2018. The pages show that the loan was charged off and closed in
May 2018. The page shows a balance of $6,477 on a $3,600 loan, and that he “paid off
-79%  of  the  loan.”  Applicant  did  not  account  for  the  negative  sign  in  front  of  “79%.”
There  is  no  evidence  that  he  has  made  any  payments  toward  the  debt.  (Tr.  at  42-45;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6-8; AE J, L)
Applicant  has  been  paying  $66  per  month  on  the  SOR  ¶¶  3.b/3.c  debt  since
March 2019. Credit reports indicate the balance was reduced from $4,798 to $3,001 to
$1,801 as of January 2023. (Tr. at 21-22; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE  6-8; AE A,

"Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked since March 2019. He is once divorced. He was married from 2005 until 2014.
He has been remarried since October 2017. He has two stepchildren, ages 26 and 23.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2015. (Tr. 17-19, 53; GE 1, 2; AE A, C, J-L)
In 2017, Applicant purchased a ring for his wife that contained a moissanite main
stone  for  about  $2,000  from  a  jeweler  who  is  an  acquaintance  of  his.  When  he
purchased the ring, he knew the main stone was moissanite and not a diamond. At the
time  of  purchase,  the  jeweler’s  estimated  replacement  value  for  the  ring  was  about
$2,600. In February 2017, Applicant insured two rings under a personal property policy
with an insurance provider (Insurance Provider). Neither of the rings he covered under
this  insurance  policy  contained  a  main  stone  that  was  moissanite.  (Tr.  20-23,  45-53;
Answer; GE 1-9, 14)
In  February 2019,  Applicant’s  wife  lost the moissanite  ring at  a theme park. On
February 8, 2019, pursuant to his personal property insurance coverage, Applicant filed
a  fraudulent  insurance  claim  with  the  Insurance  Provider  to  cover the  loss  of  the  ring.
He falsely claimed that the ring his wife lost contained a main stone that was a two-carat
diamond  and  falsely  claimed  its  value  at  about  $18,000.  At  the  time,  he  knew  that  he
was  misleading  the  Insurance  Provider  by  inflating  the  value  of  the  lost  ring.  The
Insurance  Provider  suspected  that  the  lost  ring  was  a  moissanite  ring  rather  than  a
diamond  ring,  so  it  asked  him  to  provide  the  original  purchase  receipt  for  the  ring.
Applicant  forged  the  ring’s  purchase  receipt  to  further  his  false  claim.  The  receipt  he
forged claimed that he paid about $19,000 for a two-carat diamond ring. The Insurance
Provider also obtained a copy of the actual receipt and valuation of the moissanite ring
from  the  seller.  In  April  2019,  when  the  Insurance  Provider  confronted  him  with  the
valuation  discrepancy  between  the  moissanite  ring  he  lost  and  the  two-carat  diamond
ring he claimed he lost, he falsely claimed that he did not know the main stone on the
ring he lost was not a diamond. He also later changed his story and told the Insurance
Provider that he made a mistake and made a claim for the wrong ring. (Tr. 20-23, 45-53;
Answer; GE 1-9, 14)
The  Insurance  Provider  referred  the  claim  to  the  relevant  state  insurance  fraud
division,  and  it  investigated  the  matter.  Based  upon  the  insurance  fraud  division’s
investigation, on June 26, 2019, the relevant state prosecutor’s office charged Applicant
with fraudulent insurance act, a felony, and forgery, also a felony.  In September 2019,
he pleaded guilty to lesser misdemeanor charges of false or fraudulent insurance claim
and forgery. In November 2019, the court convicted him of these misdemeanor charges,
sentenced  him  to  544  days  in  jail  (all  suspended),  placed  him  on  probation  for  two
years,  fined  him  $1,400,  and  required  him  to  take  a  moral  reconation  therapy  course.
He  also  must  notify  the  relevant  state  insurance  department  before  filing  any  future
insurance  claim.  He  has  satisfied  all  the  sentencing  requirements.  Before  this
conviction, he had no prior criminal history. (Tr. 20-23, 45-53; Answer; GE 1-9, 14)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  an  insurance  claims  adjuster  with  the
Insurance  Provider  told  him  that  he  should  inflate  the  value  of  the  diamond  in  his
engagement ring, because the Insurance Provider purchases replacement diamonds at
wholesale value. He further testified that the claims adjuster informed him that inflating
the value of the diamond in the engagement ring would make him whole for his loss. He
did  not  provide  this  excuse  for  inflating  the  value  of  the  ring  during  the  Insurance
Provider’s investigation or the state insurance fraud division’s investigation. He claimed
that  he  may  have  made  this  claim  to  the  judge  when  he  was  sentenced,  but  he  also
testified  that  he  could  not  recall  if  he  did  or  not.  During  his  testimony,  he  could  not
adequately  explain  why  he  discussed  the  valuation  of  a  diamond  with  the  claims
adjuster when he knew the ring he lost contained a moissanite stone. The first time this
explanation of following the claims adjuster’s advice to overvalue appears in the record
is  on  his  August  2020  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP).
He  provided  no  corroborating  evidence  for  this  explanation.  He  could  not  provide  the
claims  adjuster’s  name.  Based  upon  my  observation  of  him  during  his  testimony,  the
late timing of this explanation, the lack of corroboration, and his inconsistent excuses to
justify  his  behavior,  I  find  his  explanation  that  a  claims  adjuster  for  the  Insurance
Provider advised him to  inflate the value of the  ring lacks credibility. (Tr. 20-23, 45-53;

Applicant’s  former  brother-in-law  opened,  placed  balances  on,  and  became
delinquent on  numerous  financial accounts  in  Applicant’s name without  his permission
or  consent.  There  were  15  delinquent  accounts  totaling  about  $28,000.  These
fraudulently opened accounts are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.b through 2.p.  Applicant claimed
that he first became aware of these accounts in early 2019. However, he did not realize
that his former brother-in-law was responsible until sometime after he submitted his e-
QIP  in  August  2020,  but  before  his  security  interview  in  April  2021.  He  confronted  his
brother-in-law, who confessed to the identity theft. Applicant did not file a police report
because he did not want his former brother-in-law to face criminal charges. Instead, he
and his brother-in-law have either paid the relevant SOR accounts or are in the process
of repaying them. All the relevant SOR accounts have either been resolved or are being

Applicant used marijuana up to four days per week from about 2011 to 2018. (GE 2

Applicant’s use of marijuana led to two arrests. Specifically, in June 2014, he was arrested
and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty
and was placed on probation for six months and ordered to perform 24 hours of community
service. (GE 2 at 7) As part of his probation, his driver’s license was suspended for six
months. Applicant successfully completed the probation.
In 2016, a police officer pulled over Applicant’s automobile when he noticed that his
inspection sticker had expired. When the officer spoke to Applicant, he noticed that the car
smelled like marijuana, prompting him to search it. After noticing a small mason jar filled
with  marijuana,  the  officer  arrested  Applicant  and  charged  him  with  misdemeanor
possession  of  marijuana.  (Item  2  at  8;  Tr.  23)  A  few  months  later,  the  court  deferred
judgment  for  six months  and  placed  Applicant  on  probation  during  that  time.  While  on
probation,  Applicant’s  driver’s  license  was  suspended,  he  was  to  perform  32  hours  of
community service, complete random drug tests, and his driver’s license was restricted.
(GE 4 at 2) Applicant did not complete the community services hours as ordered, and he
failed two random drug tests. His non-compliance with the terms of probation prompted the
court to find him guilty of the charge. (GE 2 at 8)
One evening in March 2017, while driving home from a party where he had been

window.  When  Applicant  did  not  awaken,  the  driver  of  the  other  car  called  the  fire
department. When a fire truck arrived, the firefighters knocked on the window, then broke it
after Applicant did not respond. Applicant still did not wake up. By the time Applicant woke
up, a police officer had arrived and administered a breathalyzer, which he failed. Applicant
was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (GE 2 at 9)
After pleading guilty to the offense, Applicant was fined $500, ordered to complete alcohol
and drug counseling, attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, required to install an
ignition interlock device for a period of six months, and sentenced to 30 days’ incarceration
(suspended). (Answer at 2) Applicant complied with the requirements of the court order.
(Tr. 25)
Applicant reduced his alcohol consumption significantly after the DUI arrest. Now, he
drinks approximately three drinks per month. (Item 2 at 7) Applicant has not used marijuana
since December 2018, and no longer associates with his friends who use marijuana. (Item
2 at 6) He attributes his use to immaturity, acknowledged that he was “in the wrong,” and
testified that it “didn’t register that [he] would have future issues,” if he continued to use
marijuana.” (Tr. 28)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  in  November  2018.  He
underreported his use of marijuana, estimating that he had used it a few times between
August 2011 and December 2012, when in fact he was using it occasionally at the time he
completed the application. (Answer at 2; Tr. 30) Applicant also falsified his answer to the
question asking about drug use while possessing a security clearance by answering “No,”
and failed to disclose his marijuana use within that context. (Answer at 3) Applicant admits
these allegations, explaining that he was “scared and . . . overthinking” when he completed
the  application.  In  response  to  a  question  concerning  whether  he  would  ever  use  any
marijuana in the future, Applicant responded, “I don’t intend on using this substance EVER
[emphasis provided by Applicant] because I am an employee at the [company].” (Tr. 34) He
continued  to  use  marijuana  for  approximately  one  month  after  completing  the  security
clearance application.

"Applicant’s  Answer  to  the  SOR  was  submitted  by  counsel.  In  a  signed
declaration (AE C), Applicant addressed the Guideline E allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.d),
each  with  narrative  explanations.  (Tr.  70-71)  His  answers  do  not  contain  the  phrases
“admit”  or  “deny.”  I  nonetheless  construe  his  answers  as  admissions  to  most  of  the
factual circumstances alleged, but otherwise take his explanations as denials. I construe
his  answer  to  SOR  ¶  1.c  (concerning  falsification)  as  a  denial.  Through  counsel,
Applicant  admitted  the  cross-allegation  at  SOR  ¶  2.a.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings,  the  exhibits,  and  the  hearing  testimony,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  54  years  old.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree,  a  master’s  degree,  and
other certifications. He was married from 1992-2014 and he remarried in January 2021.
He  has  three  grown  children.  From  about  1989  until  May  2017,  he  was  employed  by
another  government  agency  (AGA)  in  various  cleared  positions.  He  was  terminated
from  the  AGA  in  May  2017,  and  his  clearance  was  revoked  soon  thereafter,  following
his arrest and guilty plea for the conduct that is largely the subject of this case. He has
been employed in the defense industry, with the same employer, since May 2017, and
he seeks a security clearance through that employment. He does not hold a clearance
currently. (GE 1; AE C; Tr. 29-38; 71-72, 92-98, 133-136) He also works a side job as a
city housing inspector, on a case-by-case basis, after hours. (Tr. 133-135)
In  about  2011,  Applicant  started  a  nonprofit  organization  (NPO),  a  basketball
program  for  about  20  or  30  underprivileged  youths.  Players  were  required  to  perform
community  service  and  keep  up  good  grades.  He  became  close  friends  with  F,  a
woman whose son was in the program, and whom he had known for many years. They
had social contact, but were not dating. She was a city employee. (Tr. 52-53, 64-67, 72-
81; GE 2 at 4)
Applicant’s  friend  F  had  two  mortgages  on  her  home  from  Bank  S.  By  2009,  F
was  behind  on  her mortgage  payments,  and  in  May  2010,  a  notice  of  foreclosure had
been  filed  with  the  city  Recorder of  Deeds.  In  spring  2013,  Bank  S  began  foreclosure
proceedings. (GE 9 at 4; Tr. 109) Through their friendship, Applicant “offered to give her
some advice” about selling her home, based on his own experience with a short sale in
about 2012-13. (Tr. 52-53, 64-67, 72-81)
In October 2013, Applicant allegedly created and then filed fabricated certificates
of satisfaction with the city Recorder of Deeds for the two liens on F’s home. With the
liens apparently satisfied, F would own  her home  “free and clear”  with no  amount due
on  any  outstanding  mortgage.  F  then  put  her  home  up  for  sale.  When  the  house  was
sold, she received 100% of the proceeds from the sale, of about $337,000 –  proceeds
that  should  have  gone  to  Bank  S  to  satisfy  the  outstanding  mortgages.  After  the  sale
was  completed  in  December  2013,  F  split  the  proceeds  with  Applicant,  who  received
about  $170,000  days  later,  apparently  as  a  loan,  rather  than  as  a  gift.  He  quickly
deposited the money into his bank account. (GE 4, GE 9; Tr. 85-86, 109-110)
In  2015,  Applicant  allegedly  made  a  materially  false  statement  on  a  financial
disclosure  form  that  he  submitted  to  his  government  employer,  when  he  failed  to
disclose the $170,000 gift or loan from F as required. (GE 9)
Federal law enforcement authorities opened an investigation into the transaction.
In  March  2016,  Applicant  was  interviewed  as  part  of  their  investigation.  He  denied
preparing  fraudulent  certificates  of  satisfaction,  denied  knowing  what  the  term
“certificates  of  satisfaction”  meant,  and  denied  other  activities  by  which  Bank  S  was
allegedly  defrauded.  (GE  4)  He  denied,  for  instance,  going  to  the  city  Recorder  of
Deeds to file the fraudulent certificates of satisfaction, and he denied that the certificates
contained his handwriting. (Tr. 84, 92, 141-142)
In August 2016, Applicant was indicted by a federal grand jury and charged with
multiple  felony  counts,  including  Conspiracy,  Bank  Fraud,  Wire  Fraud,  Money
Laundering, False Statements, and Uttering a Forged Instrument. He was arrested days
later. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 7) (SOR ¶ 1.a)
In April 2017, on the advice of his counsel, Applicant pleaded guilty to one count
of Bank Fraud (18 USC 1344) and one count of False Statements (18 USC 2001(a)(2)).
The  remaining  counts  were  dismissed.  In  July  2017,  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  a
prison term of one year and one day, followed by two years of supervised release. (GE
4, GE 5, GE 6) A forfeiture money judgment was also issued against him, and he was
ordered to pay restitution of $337,105. (GE 4) (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant was a cleared GS-15 employee of an AGA at the time. He was placed
on administrative leave after he was indicted (August 2016) and in May 2017, following
his  guilty  plea,  he  was  terminated  from  his  job.  He  testified  that  he  tendered  a
resignation, but  was then  terminated days before his resignation was  effective.  (GE 1,
GE 4; Tr. 81, 93-98) (SOR ¶ 1.d)
Applicant  reported  the  charges,  guilty  pleas,  and  sentence  on  his  August  2019
SCA. He also noted that he was still on supervised release (though he hoped for early
termination). (GE 1 at 32-34) He disclosed that he had been terminated from his job at
the AGA, and that his clearance had been revoked as a result. (GE 1 at 16, 37-38)
In the Employment section of his SCA, Applicant indicated that he had worked for
his current employer since May 2017. (GE 1 at 14; Tr. 98-99) In listing his residences,
he disclosed residing at an “FPC” (Federal Prison Camp) in State 1 from August 2017 to
January 2018. (GE 1 at 10; Tr. 57, 99-104)
Applicant testified that when he was questioned by law enforcement authorities,
he said this was the first he had heard about a “certificate of satisfaction.”  He said the
authorities  built  a  case  against  his  friend  (F).  (Tr.  50,  55)  He  said  a  key  part  of  the
evidence against him was an address listed on the certificates. This was an address he
had access to, but he said he had not been there in seven years. That residence was
owned by a friend of his. He denied at hearing that he knew what that address was. (Tr.
56,  84-85,  88-89)  At  his  hearing,  he  denied  creating  or  receiving  phony  certificates  of
satisfaction of the liens and asserted he would have been exonerated at trial. (Tr. 82-85,
138)
Applicant said he did not want to plead guilty and accept the plea agreement, but
only did so with the strong urging of his defense counsel. (AE C) This was confirmed by
a letter from his defense counsel, Mr. B. (AE D-9) Applicant acknowledged that before
pleading guilty, he was provided a copy of the indictment, the Statement of Offense, and
a letter from the U.S. Attorney’s Office detailing the terms of the plea agreement. (GE 7,
GE 8, GE 9; Tr. 139-140) He acknowledged stipulating to the Statement of Offense and
signing  it  under  penalty  of  perjury.  (Tr.  83,  111-112)  GE  8  contains  the  following
statement, under “Defendant’s Acceptance:” “I am pleading guilty because I am, in fact,
guilty  of  the  offenses  identified  in  this  agreement.”  By  his  signature,  he  also  indicated
that  he  had  read  and  understood  the  entire  plea  agreement  and  was  entering  into  it
“voluntarily and of my own free will, intending to be legally bound.” (GE 8 at 12)
At  his  security  clearance  hearing,  Applicant  said,  “I  understand  that,  you  know,
although I, you know, was talked into it, that Statement of Offense that I signed in 2017
will always be the record, the official record. And so, going forward, I will acknowledge
that  as  such.  .  .  .”  (Tr.  43,  47,  139-140)  However,  he  also  asserted  that  he  always
intended to go to trial and expected to be found not guilty. “And, I, to this day, believe in
my innocence.” (Tr. 44, 110-111, 140) He acknowledged pleading guilty to two of the six
counts. (Tr. 50; AE C)
Applicant  also  said  he  accepted  responsibility  and  acknowledged  signing  the
Statement  of  Offense.  (Tr.  91-92)  He  asserted  that  he  was  advised  by  his  attorneys
that, even if he pleaded guilty, he was likely to be able to keep his job with the AGA and
his  clearance.  (Tr.  45)  (The  plea  agreement  letter  does  not  address  this.)  (GE  8)  He
also  asserted  that  he  was  told  that  one  of  the  charges  (money  laundering)  carried  a
mandatory  sentence.  He  was  also  concerned  for  his  family  and  the  things  in  life  for
which he was responsible. In the end, “it took a lot to convince me. I took the plea deal.”
(Tr. 56-57)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  the  Statement  of  Offense,  which  he  signed,
includes an admission that he filed false certificates of satisfaction with the city recorder
of  deeds.  (GE  9  at  4)  It  also  states  that  he  “caused  the  creation”  of  the  two  “phony”
certificates. (GE 9 at 4) He acknowledged that F therefore received proceeds from the
sale  that  should  have  gone  to  Bank  S.  He  acknowledged  that  the  $50,000  loan  he
received from F was part of those proceeds and was part of the $170,000 he received.
He believes he was not credited with paying that $50,000 back to her, so it should not
be part of the restitution. (Tr. 128-131, 138; AE C)
Applicant also acknowledged that he appeared in federal court, with his  counsel,
before the judge who took and accepted his plea, and was questioned extensively about
whether  he  was  pleading  guilty  knowingly  and  voluntarily,  accepting  responsibility  for
what he did, and with an understanding of the possible punitive consequences. (GE 8 at
12)  He  asserted  at  hearing  that  he  believed  he  would  not  get  any  jail  time.  He  also
acknowledged that he did not, at least formally, pursue an attempt to withdraw his guilty
plea. (Tr. 112-118) He asserted that he pled guilty because he was scared, and never
been in trouble before and trusted his attorneys, and “I did what they advised me to do.”
(Tr.  138-139)  The  plea  agreement  letter  noted  an  “Estimated  Guidelines  Range”  for a
sentence of 24 to 30 months in jail. (GE 8 at 3)
Applicant  testified  at  the  security  clearance  hearing  that  he  recognized  that
denying  responsibility  for  the  conduct  yet  also  pleading  guilty  and  admitting  to  the
conduct  in  the  Statement  of  Offense  is  a  “catch-22,”  and  he  does  not  wish  to  appear
deceptive. (Tr. 61, 91, 110-112, 140)
Applicant  was  allowed  to  “self-surrender”  to  begin  his  prison  sentence.  (Tr.  50)
He  testified  that  he  did  not have  to  leave  his  job  as  a  contractor  when  he  reported  to
federal prison. He said he was on administrative leave while he was in prison. (Tr. 51)
(It is unclear what, if anything, Applicant told his employer where he was going).
Applicant’s sentence of one year and one day was reduced due to good behavior
to about four months in jail. He was released in early January 2018. He then resided in
a  “residential reentry  center”  (likely  akin  to  a  “halfway house”) and returned to  work at
his job. He participated in all the required rehabilitative training. (Tr. 58-59, 99-104) His
period of supervised release also ended early, in January 2020. (GE 10; AE E)
Applicant explained that of the $170,000 in proceeds he received from the sale of
F’s  house,  $120,000  went  to  the  NPO  basketball  team.  He  said  the  money  went
primarily  for  travel  expenses,  such  as  hotels  and  airline  tickets.  He  used  $35,000  for
himself (“for what I wanted.”). He said he later received $50,000 from an uncle’s estate
when  his  uncle  died  in  about  2014.  Applicant  said  authorities  also  seized  his  bank
account and kept the funds (about $48,000). (Tr. 53-54, 73, 128-129)
Applicant  asked  F  for  a  $50,000  loan  in  2013,  around  the  time  her  house  was
sold.  He  said  he  used  the  money  to  help  his  children.  He  said  he  repaid  the  loan  in
2014. (Tr. 127-128; GE 2 at 4) He testified that he did not report the matter on his 2015
financial  disclosure  form  because  he  paid  it  off  the  year  before,  and  that  most  of  the
money went towards the basketball program, and not to him. (Tr. 89-90, 131-133) The
Statement of Offense says he deposited the $170,000 into his own bank account. (GE 9
at 5) He acknowledged that it was “probably not”  a good idea to ask F for a loan if he
knew she had credit or financial problems. (Tr. 137-138)
In  October  2019,  Applicant  had  a  background  interview  in  connection  with  his
SCA.  In  SOR  ¶  1.c,  the  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  made  deliberately  false
statements to the investigator when, in discussing his criminal charges, he asserted that
he  did  not  engage  in  the  underlying  criminal  conduct,  despite  having  pled  guilty  and
having  signed  a  “Statement  of  Offense”  in  which  he  acknowledged  various  specific
criminal acts. (GE 2 at 5; GE 9)
Applicant denies the allegation of falsification. He acknowledges “misstatements”
that “did not correspond or correlate with the Statement of Offense” that he had signed
in 2017 on the advice of counsel. (AE C; AE D-10; Tr. 38, 61, 90-91, 121-123) He said,
however, that these “misstatements”  were not “false statements.”  (Tr. 46, 125-126) He
said he did not intend to mislead the government and apologized. (Tr. 40, 46; AE C)
Applicant  also  testified  that  he  consulted  legal  counsel,  Mr.  D,  before  meeting
with  the  interviewing  agent  “because  I  wanted  to  get  guidance  on  .  .  .  how  I  should
approach  the  questions  as  they  pertain  to  the  incident  that  transpired  in  2013”  and  to
“add to the record” on the matter. (Tr. 41-42. 46; AE C)
The  lawyer  Applicant  consulted,  Mr.  D,  met  Applicant  days  before  his  interview
with the investigator. Mr. D wrote, in part:
With [Applicant’s] understanding that the statement his attorneys had him
sign  in  the  2017  plea  agreement  would  always  be  the  official  record,  I
advised  him  to  tell  the  DCSA  investigator  the  truth  as  he  knew  it  and
though  it  would  differ  from  the  official  record,  it  would  serve  as  a
mechanism  to  get  his account  of  the  events  that  transpired  in  the  Fall  of
2013 in the record. In other words, based on our conversations, I believed
that there were details that needed to be shared with the investigator that
may not have been included in the official record. It has always been my
position in this case and in similar cases that it is always best to give full
disclosure and describe any and all events to the best of your knowledge,
information, and belief. (AE D-10)
Applicant did not believe that either he or the interviewing agent (Agent B) had a
copy  of  the  Statement  of  Offense  or  the  Plea  Agreement  Letter  when  he  had  the
interview. He adopted the interview summary as accurate in an interrogatory response,
and only provided an update as to the status of his supervised release. (GE 2 at 8-9; Tr.
126-127)
GE  4  indicates  that  Applicant  has  been  ordered  to  pay  about  $337,000  in
restitution. He testified that he and F are jointly and severally liable for the full amount,
but  then  said  he  is  responsible  only  for  the  $170,000  he  received.  He  is  still  trying  to
settle  what  he  owes  in  restitution  but  is  also  making  $150  payments  regularly  on  a
monthly basis and is current, as of March 1, 2023. Court documentation reflects that he
is jointly and severally liable for the full amount ($337,105). Almost $105,000 has been
collected since  2017, with  about $232,000 outstanding. Several line items are blacked
out, so they may relate to payments by F (though this is unclear). (Tr. 55, 105-108; AE
F, AE G)
Applicant volunteers in the community as a coach at a local high school working
with at-risk youth. (Tr. 60; AE D-4, AE D-5, AE D-7, AE D-8) He is no longer involved
with  the  NPO’s  basketball  program  and  has  not  been  involved  since  he  was  indicted.
(Tr. 77-78)
Applicant  has  had  no  other  arrests  or  offenses.  He  had  no  security  violations
when he held a clearance. (Tr. 43, 63, 119) He said, “I’ve never been in trouble before, I
don’t  plan  on  being  in  trouble  again.”  (Tr.  43)  He  cannot  be  blackmailed  due  to  his
conduct. (Tr. 48) He is trying to get back on track. He wants to regain his clearance to
support national security. He has experience and expertise in his professional field and
wants to contribute. He considers this work to be his life. (Tr. 68-69)
Applicant  provided  several  letters  from  professional  and  personal  character
references,  all  of  which  I  have  reviewed.  (AE  D-1  –  AE  D-8)  The  professional
references, all of them holding clearances, include the CEO of Applicant’s employer (AE
D-1),  another  director  for  the  company  (AE  D-3),  a  former  supervisor  at  another
government agency (AE D-2), three other employees at the AGA (AE D-4, AE D-5, AE
D-6), and a government employee in another federal government department (AE D-7).
All  of  these  references  have  known  and  worked  with  Applicant  for many  years,
and  attest  to  his  professional  and  technical  skill  and  expertise  in  his  professional
community,  as  well  as  to  his  judgment,  trustworthiness,  reliability,  honesty,  integrity,
decision-making,  and work  ethic, among  other qualities.  Applicant is  also  highly  active
as a volunteer in the community, proving a role as a mentor to under-privileged youths,
as  previously  noted.  (AE  D-5,  AE  D-8)  All  of  the  references  attest  that  Applicant  is  a

"Applicant  is  41  years old.  He  is married  and  has  two  children.  He  is  currently
attending on-line college courses working towards obtaining his Bachelor’s degree.  He
is employed by a defense contractor as an Inspector.  He is seeking to obtain a security
clearance in connection with his employment.
The SOR alleges that: a.  from July 1998 to about August 2021, Applicant used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency;  b.  from  about  2000  to  August  2021,  Applicant
purchased marijuana with varying frequency;  c.  from about April 2018 to about August
2021,  Applicant  purchased  and  used  marijuana  after  having  been  granted  access  to
classified information; d. in about August 2001, Applicant was charged with possession
of  marijuana.  Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR.
(Government Exhibit 1, Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
Applicant began using marijuana in high school.  Over the years, he has used it
for a period, and then stopped for a period, and then started using it again.  He has also
purchased  marijuana  both  in  the  edible  and  smoking  forms.  Applicant  normally  uses
marijuana at home to relax, as he stated that he does not consume alcohol.  Applicant
stated that between 2009 and 2018, he completely abstained from using marijuana.  He
stated  that  he  has  stopped  using  marijuana  and  last  used  it  in  August  2021.
(Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant  has  worked  in  the  defense  industry  for  about  twenty  years.  He  has
used marijuana with varying frequency for recreational purposes for over twenty years.
He began working for his current employer in September 2008.  He has also purchased
marijuana  many  times  over  the  course  of  these  years.  In  2001,  he  was  charged  with
the illegal possession of marijuana.  On this occasion Applicant was driving home when
he was pulled over by the police for not wearing his seatbelt.  Applicant had a marijuana
cigarette in his glove box and was issued a citation.  He pled guilty to a misdemeanor
and was fined $300.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant first applied for a security clearance in 2009.  He was denied a security
clearance  in  September  2009,  as  his  interim  Secret  clearance  was  revoked.  He
believes  that  he  was  denied  his  clearance  because  he  did  not  turn  in  the  additional
information  requested  as  part  of  the  investigation  by  the  due  date.  He  stated  that  he
was afraid that he would be terminated from his job because of his history, but he was
not.  Applicant re-applied for a security clearance a year later.  This time it was granted.
For the past eleven years he has had access to classified information.  Applicant used
and  purchased  marijuana  from  at  least  April  2018,  to  August  2021,  after  having  been
granted access to classified information.  (Government Exhibits 2 and 3.)
Applicant  stated that  while  working  for his current  employer,  and at  times  using
marijuana,  he  has  had  access  to  classified  information,  and  for  about  the  past  eleven
years  there  have  been  no  repercussions  from  this  misconduct.  He  has  maintained
excellent credit, and is a homeowner, an active member of his church community, and
is  a  soon  to  be  graduate  with  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  Computer  Science.  (Applicant’s

"Applicant admitted  SOR  ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c and 2.a through 2.c, and he denied

defense  contractor.  He  was  first  granted  a  security  clearance  in  approximately  2008.
(Answer; Tr. at 5, 7-8, 31-34, 38-40, 89-90, 103-104; GE 1, 3)
Applicant first used marijuana and cocaine in high school. He used them socially
with friends. He used marijuana approximately once weekly and cocaine approximately
once or twice a year. He used marijuana approximately 100 times from January 2006 to
December 2017. He also used cocaine, approximately five times, from December 2006
to December 2017. He used the drugs socially, and they were provided by friends, his
brother, or his now-deceased girlfriend. He disclosed his illegal drug use on his 2019 SCA
and he discussed it during his June 2019 background interview.  (Answer; Tr. at 40-49,
82, 98-100, 102-106; GE 1, 3)
In approximately 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession and
intent to distribute marijuana. This was his only drug-related offense. He was at a social
gathering,  and  he  went  with  a  friend  so  that  the  friend  could  obtain  marijuana  for
consumption at the gathering. The friend drove his car. He did not have marijuana on his
person, but the police officer found approximately an ounce of marijuana in his car. He
pled guilty to simple possession, received probation before judgment, and the charge was
subsequently  expunged.  He  discussed  this  incident  during  his  June  2019  background
interview,  and  he  stated  therein,  reiterated  in  his  Answer,  and  testified  that  he  did  not
disclose this arrest on his 2019 SCA due to oversight. He completed the SCA within two
to  three  hours  and  he  did  not  give  it  the  appropriate  attention  that  he  should  have.
(Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 44-45, 82-98, 100-102, 107; GE 1, 3)
In July 2006, Applicant completed an FD-316, or “Access of Non-FBI personnel to
FBI Facilities Background Data Information Form.” After he completed the  form, he was
arrested and charged with possession and intent to distribute marijuana, as discussed
above.  He  maintained  that  he  did  not  falsify  the  FD-316  form  because  he  had  not  yet
been arrested when he completed it. In September 2006, the FBI denied Applicant “. . .
access to FBI facilities, due to drug-related arrests that were not indicated”  on his July
2006  FD-316.  He  resubmitted  for  access  with  the  FBI  after  his  drug  charge  was
expunged, and the FBI granted him a clearance in 2008. (Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 44-45,
82-98, 117; GE 1, 3, 5-7)
Applicant indicated during his June 2019 background interview, reiterated in his
Answer, and testified that he did not disclose the FBI’s 2006 denial of his access to FBI
facilities  on  his  2019  SCA  due  to  oversight.  He  reiterated  that  he  completed  the  SCA
within two to three hours and he did not give it the appropriate attention that he should
have. He only remembered that his access to FBI facilities had been granted when he
completed the 2019 SCA and he forgot that it had been previously denied, as discussed
above. (Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 82-98, 117; GE 1, 3, 5-7)
Applicant first consumed alcohol in high school. In approximately 2012, Applicant
was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI). This was his first DUI.
He stated that he consumed a beer at a hockey game and then went to a bar for dinner,
where he consumed another beer and a shot of liquor. He drove home, which was less
than a mile from the bar.  His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .11%.  The  charge  was
nolle  prosequi  and  he  received  six  weeks  of  court-ordered  alcohol  treatment.  He
discussed this DUI during his June 2019 background interview, and he indicated therein
that he did not disclose this DUI on his 2019 SCA because he mistakenly believed he
was not required to since it occurred more than seven years prior. He reiterated that he
completed  the  SCA  within  two  to  three  hours  and  he  did  not  give  it  the  appropriate
attention that he should have. (Tr. at 49-52, 82-85, 106-107, 113-114; GE 3, 4)
In approximately June 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. This
was  his  second  DUI.  He  was  at  a  sports  bar  with  several  co-workers  and  his  former
supervisor after attending his father’s memorial service. He consumed approximately four
double mixed drinks and drove home. His BAC was .16%. In October 2014, he pled guilty
to misdemeanor DUI and was sentenced to three days in jail and one year of probation.
He  was  ordered  to  complete  an  18-week  court-ordered  outpatient  alcohol  treatment
program and abstain from alcohol during his year of probation. He consumed alcohol on
one  occasion and  consequently failed  a  drug  test,  but then abided by the  court’s order
and successfully completed the program and probation. He disclosed this DUI on his 2019
SCA  and  discussed  it  during  his  June  2019  background  interview.  Since  this  DUI,  he
consumes only a couple of beers at home or when he is entertaining clients approximately
once monthly. (Tr. at 52-63, 82-85, 107-108; GE 1, 3, 4)
Applicant  last  used  marijuana  and  cocaine  in  2017.  He  reached  a  turning  point
after he lost his father and girlfriend in 2014 and 2017, respectively. His girlfriend of three
years, who was not a drug user, died of an accidental overdose after she snorted a pain
pill that, unbeknownst to her, contained fentanyl. She died in his home, and he witnessed
it.  He  stated  that  he  does  not  socialize  with  drug  users.  He  stated  that  his  previous
roommate, who he sees on occasion, no longer uses drugs. As of the date of the hearing,
his  seven-year-old  niece  and  his  brother,  who  previously  provided  him  with  and  used
illegal drugs, lived with him. He stated that his brother was two years clean and part of a
Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  program.  He  stated  that  he  has  no  future  intention  to  use
marijuana or other illegal drugs, and that if he were to find himself in a situation where
illegal drugs were being used, he would leave. He stated that he learned from the 2019
security  clearance  process  the  effect  that  any  criminal  involvement  would  have  on  his
career, and he was committed to not doing anything that would jeopardize it. (Answer; Tr.

Alcohol Consumption, Criminal Conduct, Drug Involvement, and Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶  3.b  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  that  he  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency from August 1986 to at least August 2019. (Tr. 69-70, 109-111; GE 2 at 13) He

with  possession  of  marijuana  (between  10  and  30  grams)  and  manufacturing  and/or
delivering a controlled dangerous substance, a felony. (GE 3 at 17-18) He pleaded guilty
to possession of marijuana, a lesser-included misdemeanor offense. (Tr. 34) He claimed
that  he  pleaded  guilty  even  though  he  did  not  possess  marijuana  because  it  was  “the
easiest way out.” (Tr. 34) He was sentenced to 12 months of probation before judgment
and ordered to pay fines and court costs totaling $921. (GE 3 at 21)
SOR ¶¶  1.h  and  2.a  allege  Applicant  was  arrested  on  December  21,  1997, and  he
was charged with driving  under the influence  of alcohol (DUI), driving on a suspended or
revoked driver’s license, and operating an uninsured motor vehicle.  On January 7, 2000,

counseling classes, and his driver’s license was reinstated. (Tr. 36)
SOR  ¶   1.g   alleges  Applicant  was  arrested   on   August  22,  1998,   and   he   was
charged  with  obstruction  of justice/destruction  of  evidence  and  attempted  false  report  of
an   offense,  both   felonies.   He  was  convicted   of  these   offenses  and   sentenced   to   11
months of probation  and  assessed  fines and  court costs totaling  $250.  (GE 3  at24-26)
Applicant said  he  remembered  being  arrested  after he  swore  at a  police  officer; however,
he  claimed  he could not recall  ever going  to  court or being  charged  with  the  offenses. (Tr.
37)  Somehow  he   was   found   guilty  and   he   “never  knew  about   it  again  until   [he]  went
through  this investigation  process right here.”  (Tr. 37)  He said his mother checked  with
the  police  department  and  they did  not have  any record  of  the  arrests.  (Tr. 38)  He  did not
indicate she checked the court records for evidence of his conviction.
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges Applicant was arrested on March 29, 2003, and he was charged
with possession of marijuana (less than 2.5 grams) and possession of drug paraphernalia.
(GE 3 at 27-31) Applicant said a police officer was harassing him, and the police officer
found a bottle with a marijuana stem in it under his vehicle’s seat. (Tr. 38, 40) When he
arrived  at the  police  station, “the  chief  of police” pleaded  with  Applicant not to  make  a
complaint against the [arresting] officer because he was in the process of being dismissed
as  a  result  of  the  police  officer’s  disorderly  conduct.  (Tr.  39)  Applicant  was  charged;
however, the  charges  were  eventually  dismissed.  (Tr.  39;  GE  3  at  31-32)  He  said  the
marijuana was under the passenger’s seat, and it was not his marijuana. (Tr. 41)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  Applicant  was  arrested  on  January  29,  2011,  and  he  was
charged with possession of marijuana (less than 1 ounce). SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant
failed to appear for a court date on September 16, 2011, and a warrant was issued for his
arrest. (GE 3 at 5-10) Applicant said he was in a vehicle with five other individuals, and
the police found marijuana in one of their bags. (Tr. 43) He said it was not his marijuana.
(Tr. 43) On November 4, 2019, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator
interviewed Applicant about the warrant for his arrest, and Applicant said he did not intend
to resolve it until his child custody issues were resolved. (OPM Report of Investigation
(ROI) at 7) As of March 31, 2022, the charge was pending.
At Applicant‘s hearing,  he  said  he  recently paid $1,150 to  resolve the  charge. (Tr.
42) He said he  “called  and  over the  phone  paid with  [his] credit card  and  then  that was
pretty much  it, a  done  deal.” (Tr. 43-44) He said he  would  provide  documentation  after
the hearing showing the charge was resolved; however, he did not provide anything. (Tr.
43)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant was arrested on August 10, 2017, and he was charged
with domestic battery. The mother of his children obtained 11 orders of protection. (Tr.
45-48) She told the police he assaulted her. (Tr. 47) When he went to court, she withdrew
her allegations. (Tr. 47) He denied that he was violent towards her. (Tr. 49) He believed
it would be best if he moved to a different state to get away from her. (Tr. 50)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  Applicant  was  arrested  on  February  7,  2018,  and  he  was
charged with violation of a civil no contact order. (GE 3 at 33-34) Applicant said the charge
was dismissed because the civil no contact order did not exist. (Tr. 51-52)
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  2.a  allege  Applicant was  arrested  on  July 22,  2019, following  a
multi-vehicle  collision,  and he  was charged  with  aggravated  DUI resulting  in great bodily
harm.  Applicant  said the  accident was not  his fault.  (Tr. 71) The  accident was at  about
10:46  p.m. (GE  4  at 19)  He said  he  only had  one  drink, and  that was about  4:45  p.m.
when   he   was  at  dinner.  (Tr.  71)  The   accident  occurred   at  about   10   p.m.  (Tr.  71)   One
report said he  had  a  breathalyzer which  registered  .075  (no  time  specified  in the  report);
however, his breathalyzer at 12:14 am  said .054. (Tr. 74, 86-87; GE  4 at 2, 18-19)
Applicant  said  they  tested  urine  samples  in  the  jail,  and  they  found  cocaine
metabolites in his urinalysis sample; however, he disagreed with this finding. (Tr. 76, 101)
He  was  taking  Adderall  for  ADHD,  and  it  was  not  detected  in  the  test.  (Tr.  76-77)  He
believed they switched his urine sample with one of the other prisoners. (Tr. 101) Forty-
eight hours after he was arrested, he had a blood test, which was negative for the cocaine
metabolite. (Tr. 103, 106) I asked Applicant to provide a copy of the blood test results
after his hearing; however, he did not provide them. (Tr. 116)
Applicant was arrested for failure to appear on March 6, 2023, and he was released
on March 13, 2023. (Tr. 79-80, 96) Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI in order to get released
from  jail.  (Tr.  82)  He  was  placed  on  probation  for  18  months.  (Tr.  109)  He  intends  to
appeal his conviction. (Tr. 82) He was unaware of the status of the civil lawsuit the woman
seriously injured in the accident filed against him. (Tr. 83; GE 5)
Applicant told the police officer he drank a double vodka at about 5:00 p.m., and
he said he had not smoked marijuana in the previous three days. (Tr. 86; GE 4 at 19)
The  woman  who  was  seriously  injured  in  the  accident  on  July  22,  2019,  was
pregnant. In her lawsuit, she seeks damages from Applicant in the amount of $50,000.
(GE 4) The lawsuit states Applicant was under the influence of alcohol and/or marijuana
at the time of the accident.
Applicant was arrested or served with papers in the summer of 2022 for not paying
his child support. (Tr. 60, 68) He said, “they put me in jail twice to pay child support in a
total amount of $9,000 one time, and then $6,000 the next time. So, that’s $15,000. So,
how could I possibly owe them anything?” (Tr. 59) The hearing is supposed to clarify the
amount  of  his  child  support  payments,  and  possibly  designate  who  should  take  the
deductions  for  the  children  for  income  tax  purposes.  (Tr.  59-62)  He  had  a  hearing
scheduled the last week of March 2023 concerning child support payments. (Tr. 58-59)
He believes his child support is current. (Tr. 60)
Personal Conduct-Falsification of SCA
SOR ¶¶ 4.b, 4.c, and 4.d allege Applicant failed to disclose on his April 23, 2020
SCA the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 3.b in response to questions
about felony charges, charges involving alcohol and illegal drugs, and involvement with
marijuana in the previous seven years.
In his April 23, 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed: his 2017 or 2018 domestic violence
charges which was dismissed; his emergency order of protection in 2019 was denied; his
aggravated  DUI  charge  in  2019  was  pending;  and  he  was  accused  of  violation  of
parenting order or plan in 2020 (GE 1 at 32-39) He did not disclose any alcohol offenses
except  the  2019  DUI  or  any  drug  offenses  or  involvement  in  response  to  the  specific
questions about alcohol-related charges and drug involvement. (GE 1)
On November 4, 2019, Applicant confirmed to an OPM investigator that his only
arrest for or charge of DUI was in 2019, and he did not have any drug-related charges.
(OPM ROI at 6) He was confronted with and confirmed marijuana possession charges in
1995, 2003, and 2011. (Id. at 6-9; SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i) He confirmed: his 1997 DUI
arrest and conviction in 2000, and his arrest in 1998, for obstruction of justice/destruction
of evidence. (OPM ROI at 8; SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h) He indicated he used marijuana from
August 1986 to August 2019, and his average use was three or four times a month. (OPM
ROI at 9) He said he “has never tested  positive on  a  drug  test.”  (Id. at 10) He told the
OPM investigator that he believed he was only required to disclose marijuana offenses
and DUIs in the previous seven years. (Id. at 6-9) In his response to DOHA interrogatories
he  explained  the  urinalysis  test  result  showing  cocaine  metabolites  found  in  his  urine
sample  were  erroneous,  and  he  predicted  the  charges  would  be  removed  from  his
records. (GE 2 at 2)
At his hearing, Applicant said he  had  no  idea  he  was charged  with  the  felonies in
SOR ¶  1.g. (Tr. 89) He  misread  the  question  concerning  alcohol  and  drug  offenses.  (Tr.
90-91) He thought he  only had  to  disclose  the  offenses in the  last  seven  years. (Tr. 90-
91)
",False
"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.s, 1.t, 2.a through 2.d, and 3.a
through 3.c. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.r, 1.u through 1.z, 2.e and 2.f. He failed to
respond  to  SOR  ¶  3.d and  it  will be  considered  a  denial.  After a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2007. He returned to
college  in  2013  and  completed  a  master’s  degree  in  2020.  He  married  in  2007  and
divorced in 2016. He has two children, ages 16 and 11, from the marriage. He remarried
in 2018 and has no children from the marriage. He has a 22-year child from a previous
relationship  and  an  8-year-old  child  from  another  previous  relationship.  Applicant  was
commissioned in the military in 2008 and served until his honorable discharge in 2015 in
the rank of O-3. He had combat deployments in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2014. He has a
1 Applicant’s 2018 tax year return was not due until April 2019. I have amended  SOR ¶  3.e  to replace
“2018” with “2017.”
Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  disability  rating  of  100%,  which  includes  post-traumatic  stress
disorder  (PTSD)  among  other  issues.  Applicant  had  no  significant  periods  of
unemployment and has worked for federal contractors since his military discharge.  (Tr.
15, 21-31)
Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  statements  to  a  government
investigator, testimony, credit reports, criminal records, and documents from the military
corroborate the SOR allegations. (GE 1-14)
The  SOR alleges,  in  SOR ¶¶  1.e  through  1.q,  that  Applicant  has  delinquent student
loans.  SOR  ¶   1.r  is  a   garnishment  by   the   Department   of   Treasury  on   behalf   of  the
Department   of  Education   for  his   student   loans.  Applicant  obtained   these   loans   for  his
undergraduate  education. He said they were  deferred  when  he  was deployed. He said  he
made  some  payments  but could  not recall  any specifics.  He testified  that because  he  is
a   100% disabled   veteran,  his delinquent  student  loans  were   discharged   and   resolved,
and  he  was  not  required  to  repay  them.  He provided  a  document confirming  they  were
discharged.  He  testified   he   applied   for  the   loans  to   be   forgiven   in  approximately
September 2021  and received  notification it was approved in January 2022. The  student
loans alleged  in  SOR ¶¶ 1.e  through  1.q  are  resolved  in his favor. (Tr. 16, 31-36, 119-
126; AE  A)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  ($17,329)  and  1.s  ($11,030)  are  debts  for  delinquent  child  support
payments. Applicant testified that he was paying his child support payments for his two
children with his ex-wife through an automatic withdrawal from his paycheck. Applicant
was unaware that when he changed jobs in 2017, the automatic payment stopped. When
he became aware, he paid his child support through an electronic cash application directly
to his ex-wife, and he did not receive payment credit by the state administering the child
support.  His  ex-wife  testified  and  confirmed  that  she  received  the  cash  payments.
Applicant testified that he contacted the state in 2021 or 2022 and was given credit for
the  arrearages  on  this  account.  When  he  accepted  a  new  job,  he  set  up  automatic
payments from his pay for child support that goes to the state and then it is sent to his ex-
wife. He has resolved SOR ¶ 1.b. (Tr. 36-44, 158-162)
The child support arrearage in SOR ¶ 1.s is for his youngest child and happened
under the same  circumstances. The  same state  manages this  child  support.  Applicant
testified  that  when  he  changed  jobs,  he  made  payments  through  an  electronic  cash
application. He said that the mother is uncooperative in acknowledging she received the
payments, and she refuses to turn in the required papers to the state to confirm Applicant
made  the  cash  payments  to  her.  Applicant  testified  that  he  would  provide  the  cash
receipts  to  show  he  made  the  payments.  He  testified  that  he  would  also  provide  a
document from the state, which would show any balance owed. He did not provide these
documents. His March 2023 credit bureau report reflects a balance of $13,533 owed. This
debt is not resolved. (Tr. 44-46, 130-134; GE 14)
The SOR alleged in ¶ 1.z ($7,179) that the Department of Treasury was garnishing
his  wages  on  behalf  of  the  government  creditor  for  reimbursement  for  lost  equipment
while he was serving in the military. It is unclear if the garnishment was completed. He
testified  there  was  an  investigation  into  the  missing  items,  which  were  found,  and  he
received a letter telling him the debts were resolved.  His October 2018, October 2019,
January 2021, and August 2021 credit reports reflect the debt. It is not reported on his
March 2023 credit report. He failed to provide a copy of the letter. Since his wages were
being garnished, I have given Applicant the benefit of the doubt and SOR ¶ 1.z is resolved
in his favor. (Tr. 46-51, 53-55, 126-130; GE 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 14)
Applicant testified that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($86), 1.u ($215), and 1.v
($790) are all medical accounts that  should have been paid by the  VA because  of  his
disability. I am unable to make that determination based only on Applicant’s testimony.
Applicant did not provide any documents to show he disputed  or resolved these debts.
(Tr. 52-53)
Applicant  testified  that  he  paid  the  cell  phone  account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.x
($1,330). He did not provide documented proof. SOR ¶ 1.t ($499) is a collection account
for a payday loan and SOR ¶ 1.w is a delinquent credit card account ($576). No proof
was provided to show these debts have been paid. (Tr. 52, 134)
During his hearing, Applicant was asked by the Government if he had filed his past
income  tax  returns.  He  testified  that  he  did  not  file  federal or  state  income  tax  returns
since 2015. He testified that for tax year 2015, he forgot to file his returns and then he
kept telling himself he would file and each subsequent year he did not. He testified that
he received a notice from the IRS about his delinquent taxes, but he could not recall the
year. He said when he returned from deployment, he did not file his 2015 tax return, and
he was dealing with the death of his father in March 2016. Every year he would receive
his W-2 income tax form from his employer, and he knew he had to file his returns but did
not. He admitted he was neglectful and did not file his federal and state income tax returns
for  tax  years  2015  to  the  present.  In  his  post-hearing  submissions,  Applicant  did  not
provide any documents to show he has filed any of the delinquent income tax returns.
(SOR ¶ 1.aa) (Tr. 144-151, 154)
Based on Applicant’s testimony that he was aware he had not filed his federal or
state income tax returns beginning in 2015, I find he deliberately failed to disclose this
information as required on his SCA. He admitted at his hearing that he lied on his SCA
when he failed to disclose that he had not filed his tax returns. (Tr. 146-147; GE 1)
Applicant  was  apprehended  by military police  in  August  2012  and suspected  of
assault consummated by a battery and spouse abuse after a mutual confrontation with
his then-wife. Applicant testified that there was mutual pushing and shoving between him
and his then-wife. He was ordered to participate in counseling with the base chaplain. He
and his then-wife participated together for a time and then she stopped. He then went by
himself. He  estimated the  entire  counseling was  for about  six to  seven months. There
was no disciplinary action. (SOR ¶ 2.a) (Tr. 55-56, 79-84; GE 6, 7)
In January 2013, Applicant was arrested for grand larceny, a felony.  He went to
court multiple times and was represented by an attorney. The charge was later reduced
to a misdemeanor. He pleaded guilty to petit larceny and was sentenced to 12 months
confinement (11 months and 10 days were suspended) and ordered to pay court costs.
Applicant testified he believed his then-wife was cheating on him. He went to the man’s
workplace and called a number he retrieved from his then-wife’s phone that belonged to
the man. When the man answered, it confirmed to Applicant that this was the man. When
the man was not looking, Applicant took his phone. He was later arrested. He received a
letter of reprimand from his command. (SOR ¶ 2.b) (Tr. 57-59, 84-93; GE 9)
In  July 2016, while working  overseas, Applicant was accused  of sexual assault  and
abusive sexual contact  on  a  foreign  national. He denies the  accusations. He was  returned
to  the  United  States.  An  investigation  ensued.  Applicant was not arrested  or charged. The
U.S.  Attorney  declined   to   prosecute.   However,  his  company  learned   through   the
investigation   that alcohol was   involved,   and  it  was during   the   work   week,   so   Applicant
was terminated. (SOR ¶ 2.c) (Tr. 59-61, 93-98; GE 8)
In  July  2017,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI).  He
admitted he was over the legal limit but could not recall the breathalyzer reading. He could
not recall how many drinks he had, but indicated it was a significant amount. Applicant
was  represented  by  an  attorney.  In  October  2017,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  DWI  and  was
sentenced to 30 days confinement (all suspended), 36 months of unsupervised probation,
fined $250 and ordered to pay court costs of $349. His driver’s license was suspended
for a year. (SOR ¶ 2.d) (Tr. 61-64, 98-101; GE 10)
Applicant was arrested in July 2017 for driving with a suspended license. Applicant
testified that the charge was dismissed when he showed the judge that his license was
valid. Court records reflect the charge was nolle prosequi. (SOR ¶ 2.e) (Tr. 61-64; GE 11)
In September 2018, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).
In response to Section 22, which asked about his police record and specifically if he had
been arrested, charged, convicted, or sentenced for a crime in the last seven years; had
he ever been  charged with  a felony;  and  had  he  EVER been charged with  an offense
involving drugs or alcohol, Applicant answered “No.” He did not disclose his felony arrest,
misdemeanor conviction for petit larceny, or DWI. (SOR ¶ 3.a) (GE 1)
Section  26  of  the  SCA  asked  Applicant  if  he  had  in  the  last  seven  years  been
delinquent  on  his  child  support,  any  federal  debt,  or  a  judgment  entered  against  him.
Applicant answered “No.” He did not disclose two delinquent child support accounts and
his delinquent student loans. (SOR ¶ 3.b) (GE 1)
Section 26 of the SCA asked if Applicant had defaulted on any loan; had any bills
turned over to a collection agency; had any account or credit card charged off, suspended
or canceled for failing to pay as agree; or if he had been over 120 days delinquent on any
debt.  He  answered  “No.”  Applicant  did  not  disclose  any  of  his  delinquent  debts  or
delinquent payday loan. (GE 1)
Section 26 of the SCA asked if in the last seven years Applicant failed to file or pay
federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance? He answered “No” to
this question, and thereby deliberately failed to disclose that he failed to file his federal
and state income tax returns from 2015 to 2017. (GE 1)
In March 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He was
asked  why  he  failed  to  disclose  his  delinquent  student  loans,  child  support,  and  other
delinquent debts. Applicant said he did not know how his student loans were broken down
into different accounts. At the time he was interviewed, his loans had not yet been forgiven
and  were  delinquent.  He  told  the  government  investigator  that  after  Hurricane  Katrina
(2005) his student loans were broken into smaller accounts. He was unaware the loans
had  been  reorganized  until  he  received  calls  and  notices  from  the  creditors  about  the
accounts. He did not have the information for each account, so he did not disclose them.
He said he was on a payment plan and was to pay $140 a month for nine months. The
investigator  gave  him  an  opportunity  to  provide  substantiating  documents.  He  did  not.
Post-hearing, he provided emails from 2013 and 2015 to the creditor requesting his loans
be deferred because he was in the military. His email stated that his military obligation
ended  in  April  2020.  He  was  discharged  in  2015.  His  request  was  processed,  and  it
appears the loans were deferred. However, he did not provide additional documents to
reflect if he took any action on the loans after his discharge until the loans were forgiven
in 2022. (Tr. 77-78; GE 13; AE C)
Applicant did not disclose the medical debts alleged in the SOR because he said
they were to be paid by the VA. He said he would contact the VA and resolve the debts.
He said he thought his other debts were paid, and he was unaware that other accounts
were in collection. He also explained that he disagreed with some of the debts, and he
was  in  the  process  of  disputing  and  resolving  them.  He  said  that  he  interpreted  the
question incorrectly. (GE 13)
I  find  Applicant  was  aware  he  had  student  loans  that  were  delinquent  and
deliberately failed to disclose them (SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.q). I find that Applicant likely
did not deliberately fail to disclose his medical debts if he believed they should be paid by
the VA (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.u and 1.v). I also find that he did not deliberately fail to disclose
his delinquent child support because he believed he was paying it (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.s)
but not receiving credit. I also find he did not deliberately fail to disclose the remaining
debts that he thought were paid. My findings are limited to whether he deliberately failed
to disclose these debts and not to whether he is responsible for paying them. (Tr. 78-79;
GE 13)
Applicant told the investigator that he attributed his financial problems to his child
support  obligations  that  were  to  be modified  in  April  2019.  He  was  uncertain  when  he
would be able to pay his delinquent debts. (GE 13)
Applicant was given an opportunity by the investigator to volunteer if he had any
alcohol-related charges against him in the past, and he told the investigator he did not. At
his hearing, Applicant denied this and said he told the government investigator about his
DWI. He explained to the investigator the circumstances surrounding the DWI. Applicant
claimed his failure to disclose the DWI conviction on his SCA was an oversight. At his
hearing, he said he did not know why he failed to disclose his DWI. He said he thought it
was  an  application  that  would  go  back  to  his  employer,  and  he  could  explain  it  to  his
employer.  He  said  that  he  had  reported  it  to  his  facility  security  officer.  I  did  not  find
Applicant credible. His DWI conviction was less than two years before he completed his
SCA. I find he deliberately failed to disclose his DWI conviction on his SCA. (Tr. 72-77,
146-147; GE 1, 13)
Applicant testified that he did not know why he failed to disclose any of his other
criminal charges. He said he thought he could explain himself to his employer. Applicant
was  charged  with  grand  larceny,  a  felony.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  a  misdemeanor  and
received  12  months  in  jail.  Some  of  his  jail  sentence  was  suspended  but  not  all,  and
Applicant  served  time  in  jail.  I  did  not  find  him  credible.  I  find  he  deliberately  failed  to
disclose his criminal conduct. (Tr. 72-79; GE 13)
In March 2021 Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic violence third
degree-harassment,  after  he  had  an  altercation  with  his  wife  and  his  stepdaughter’s
boyfriend. He was unhappy with the boyfriend because when he went inside Applicant’s
house, the boyfriend did not speak. When Applicant addressed him, the boyfriend said
something sassy. Applicant threw a chair across the room, which hit a table that had beer
on it, and it splashed on some people. He admitted he had been drinking but said he was
not intoxicated. The police were called. He was taken to a hotel and separated from the
situation. He said he could not get a hotel room, so he went back to his house. He began
arguing  with  his  then-wife  and  the  police  came  again,  and  he  was  arrested.  Applicant
went to anger management classes and completed them in March 2022. The charge was
dismissed. (SOR ¶ 2.f) (Tr. 64-67, 101-113; GE 12)
Applicant testified that he accepts responsibility for anger issues that are related
to his PTSD. He has taken financial management classes to help him budget. He has a
written  budget  but  did  not  provide  it.  He  has  been  seeing  a  mental  health  practitioner
since 2022, and the last time he spoke with her was December 2022. He takes medication
to help him. He testified that he participated in a substance abuse program through the
VA that lasted 18 months. He stopped drinking alcohol in January 2023. He and his ex-
wife  have  reconciled  to  be  good  parents  for  their  children.  He  attributed  his  criminal
conduct to issues with his ex-wife. He volunteers at the American Legion and Wounded
Warriors. (Tr. 16, 67-69, 113-119, 137-138)

"Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2011. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has
held since about 2011. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2017 and a master’s degree in
2019. He married in 2022. He has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 36, 64-65; GE 1; AE

Applicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents and criminal conduct. He was
arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in December 2015 and June 2021. He was
arrested or cited for public intoxication in July 2018, November 2018, and October 2019.
He was hospitalized for alcohol intoxication and suicidal ideation in February 2019.
Applicant  had  about  seven  shots  of  alcohol  at  a  bar  in  December  2015.  He
attempted  to  drive  home,  but  was  found  by  the  police  in  a  nearby  parking  lot  asleep
behind  the driver’s  wheel.  He had  a blood alcohol  test, but  he  testified  that he  did not
remember what his blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was on the test. He was arrested
and charged with DWI. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 80 hours of community
service  and probation for 12  months.  He  was  required to  take  three  alcohol education
classes. (Tr. at 36-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4, 10)
Applicant  then  girlfriend  (not  his  wife)  broke  up  with  him  while  they  were  at  the
wedding of the girlfriend’s sister in July 2018. He drank at the reception and then at a
restaurant. He then drove  and parked by the side of a secluded road and drank  in his
truck. The police found him asleep in the back of his truck. He was  arrested for public
intoxication.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  paid  a  fine.  (Tr.  at  39-44;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 3, 10)
Applicant  was  drinking  at  a  bar  in  November  2018.  His  ex-girlfriend  contacted
him about getting back together. He drank too much  (about seven shots) and became
anxious  and  emotional,  and  he  started  crying.  The  police  took  him  to  the  hospital
because  they  had  concerns  that  he  was  having  an  anxiety  or  a  panic  attack.  The
hospital did not admit him, and he was arrested for public intoxication. He pleaded guilty
and  received  a  deferred  adjudication.  (Tr.  at  44-46;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;  GE

Applicant  was  drinking  wine  by  himself  in  his  apartment  in  February  2019.  He
drank  at  least  one  bottle  of  wine.  He  cut  his  finger  on  a  broken  wine  bottle,  and  he
accidentally caused a crease in an extension faucet. The water leaked from the faucet,
with the overflow going into the apartment below him. His neighbor called maintenance
about the leak. When maintenance arrived at his apartment, they noticed the blood and
the water, and they contacted the police. The police also received calls, apparently from
his  friend,  indicating  that  Applicant  had  threatened  to  end  his  own  life,  had  suicidal
thoughts  (ideation),  and  had  threatened  to  kill  his  friend.  When  police  arrived,  they
found  multiple  empty  wine  bottles,  and  Applicant  was  described  as  belligerent  and
intoxicated. (Tr. at 20, 46-50; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 10)
A  detention  warrant  was  issued,  and  Applicant  was  taken  to  the  hospital  in  the
evening  of  February  15,  2019.  His  lacerated  finger  was  treated,  and  his  blood  was
collected at 11:30 p.m. His BAC was .376%. He received a psychological screening the
next  morning.  A  differential  diagnosis  considered  was  suicidal  ideation  (SI),  homicidal
ideation (HI), co-ingestion, and acute alcohol intoxication. The provisional diagnosis was
alcohol abuse.  He  was  assessed  with  alcohol-induced  mood  disorder and alcohol  use
disorder,  mild,  abuse.  An  alcohol  use  disorder  diagnosis  requires  the  presence  of  at
least 2 of the 11 criteria listed in the DSM-5. Applicant was deemed to be positive for 3
of the criteria. The DSM-5 indicates that if 2 to 3 of the criteria are met, the disorder is
specified as mild. (Tr. at 67-68; GE 2; HE III)
The   doctor discussed  alcohol use   disorder with   Applicant.  She   encouraged   him
to   track  his  alcohol   use   and   to   seek  counseling   or  outpatient  support  for  alcohol  use
cessation. Referrals for treatment and counseling were provided  to  him. He did not meet
the   criteria   for  inpatient  hospitalization,  and   he   was   discharged   to   his   home   at  about
11:09  a.m. on February 16, 2019.  (Tr. at 67-68; GE 2)
Applicant  was  drinking  at  a  bar  in  October  2019.  The  police  arrested  him  for
public  intoxication.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  paid  a  fine.  He  does  not  remember  exactly
what happened. (Tr. at 52-54; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 10)
Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI, second offense, in June 2021. He
was  at  a  baby  shower  with  his  girlfriend  (now  wife)  that  lasted  for  about  eight  to  nine
hours.  He  drank,  but  he  did  not  believe  he  was  intoxicated.  He  stated  that  he  was
driving  with  his  girlfriend,  and  they  had  an  argument.  He  was  using  his  cell  phone  for
navigation, when it fell. He swerved and hit the curb. They parked  in a parking lot, got
out of the truck, and continued  to argue. The police arrived and arrested him. A blood
test measured .18% and .14% BAC. Applicant believes the tests were inaccurate. The
case is still pending trial. (Tr. at 20-21, 54-57, 65-67, Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
5, 11)
The  DoD  Consolidated  Adjudications  Facility  (CAF)  requested  that  Applicant
undergo  a  psychological  evaluation  in  March  2021.  The  evaluation  was  voluntary,  but
the request had the following option:
I  will  not  participate  in  an  independent  psychological  evaluation  with  a
provider retained by the DoD CAF. By initialing here, I understand that my
refusal to participate in an independent psychological evaluation will result
in  the  denial  of  my  security  clearance  application  due  to  my  failure  to
cooperate. (GE 7)
Applicant  agreed  to  undergo  the  evaluation.  He  reported  to  the  evaluation  in
August  2021,  but  he  refused  to  talk  about  the  June  2021  DWI.  He  stated,  “I  want  to
postpone  any  discussion  about  that  charge  on  the  advice  of  my  attorney.”  He
elaborated,  “I  don’t  understand  what  happened.  I  was  not  in  a  vehicle  and  I  didn’t
overconsume. I will discuss it at some point in the future after my attorney and I figure
out exactly what happened.”  The psychologist was unable to render a diagnosis or an
opinion. (Tr. at 21, 57-58, 70; GE 7, 8)
Applicant  wrote  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  that  he  realized  that  refusing  to
discuss the DWI with the psychologist was not in his best interest. He wrote:
I  realize  now  that  my  attorney  is  not  well  versed  in  handling  cases  that
involve  clients  with  security  clearance  requirements.  If  I  had  that
opportunity again, I would handle the situation differently. I would be more
than happy to go through another evaluation. If there are questions asked
of  me  during  this  process  or  during  my  hearing,  I  will  absolutely  provide
full and detailed answers.
Applicant relied on the generic advice of his attorney to not discuss the case. He
did not request specific advice from his attorney about the evaluation.  He realizes now
that it was a mistake to not fully participate in the psychological evaluation. He remains
willing to undergo another evaluation. (Tr. at 70-72; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant admitted that 2018 to 2021 was “a dark time in [his] life,” which resulted
from  a  tumultuous  relationship  (previous  girlfriend,  not  wife).  He  denied  ever  having
plans to commit suicide. He had been sober for 718 days as of the date of the hearing.
He  has  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings  two  to  three  times  a  week  for
the  last  year.  He  also  saw  his  company’s  counselor  several  times.  His  marriage  is
happy, and his wife does not drink. He is more health conscious, with a better diet and
daily exercise. He does not believe that he is an alcoholic; but he is convinced that his
life is better without alcohol. (Tr. at 19, 23, 59-64, 68-70; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant had a psychological evaluation by a clinical psychologist in May 2023.

"Applicant  admitted  some  of  the SOR  allegations,  with  explanations,  and  denied
other allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact.  After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. He is currently unemployed, but he is being sponsored
for a security clearance by a federal contractor. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 2013
to 2019, when he was discharged with a general discharge, under honorable conditions.
He holds an associate degree and is taking additional courses. He is divorced and has
no children. He held a clearance while in the Air Force until it was suspended in December
2018. (Tr. 6, 37-38; GE 1, 6)
Under Guideline I, the SOR alleged: (1) Applicant received psychiatric treatment
for  depression  and  anxiety  in  November  2018.  He  expressed  suicidal  ideations  while
hospitalized; (2) Applicant received treatment at a military medical clinic from December
7, 2018, to about April 22, 2019, after expressing suicidal ideations. He was diagnosed
with conditions identified as adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood
and  an  unspecified  personality  disorder.  He  was  given  a  poor  prognosis.  He  was
evaluated  by  a  licensed  psychologist  in  December  2021,  who  affirmed  the  earlier
diagnoses  of  mood  disorder  and  adjustment  disorder,  and  also  characterized  his
prognosis as poor. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c)
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged: (1) Applicant received nonjudicial punishment
under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  Article  15,  in  February  2019  for
wrongful  use  of  testosterone;  (2)  Applicant  received  nonjudicial  punishment  under  the
UCMJ, Article 15, in April 2019 for wrongful use of letrozole; (3) Applicant was charged
with  engaging  in  abusive  sexual  contact  under  UCMJ  Article  120;  and  (4)  Applicant
received a general discharge from the Air Force in May 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.d)
Under Guideline H, the SOR cross-alleged the two drug abuse allegations in SOR
¶¶ 2.a-2.b.
Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.d. The
SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false information on his August 2019
security clearance application (SCA) when he failed to disclose: (1) his hospitalization in
November 2018; (2) his illegal drug use in SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.b above; (3) his illegal drug use,
while  possessing  a  security  clearance;  and  (4)  that  he  had  his  security  clearance
suspended in December 2018. (SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.e)
Phycological Conditions  (Guideline I).
Applicant  was interviewed  by a background  investigator in August 2019.  During
that interview, he admitted that he sought treatment for anxiety and depression and was
hospitalized at a military facility in November 2018. He sought this treatment after he had
moved out from living with his girlfriend in October 2018. He remained hospitalized for
approximately  36  hours.  Applicant  admitted  this  hospitalization  during  his  hearing
testimony. There are no medical records that document this hospitalization. There is also
no evidence supporting Applicant’s suicidal ideations at this point in time. (Tr. 54-56 ; GE
2 (p. 6), GE 4 (no reference to November 2018 hospitalization))
Applicant  voluntarily sought outpatient  counseling at an Air Force mental health
clinic from approximately December 2018 to  May 2019. The treatment stopped when he
was  discharged  from  the  Air  Force  in  May  2019.  His  medical  care  during  this  time  is
documented by the 120 pages of records contained in GE 4. Applicant’s primary mental
health provider during his sessions was Dr. C, a licensed clinical psychologist. Applicant
had one session with Dr. K, a psychiatrist. (GE 4 (pp. 14, 45-50, 112))
Dr.  C’s  initial  diagnoses  for  Applicant  in  December  2018  were:  (1)  adjustment
disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (DSM-5 F43.23), and (2) unspecified
disorder of adult personality and behavior (DSM-5 F69). During the course of the next
several months, Dr. C continued to see Applicant in the clinical setting and documented
the following observations:
Applicant’s  first  session   on   December  7,   2018:  He  was   hostile   and
uncooperative  with  treatment.  He made  little eye  contact, which  challenges
his  credibility.   A   personality  disorder   is  suspect  of  interfering   with   his
accessibility to  treatment. He is scheduled for psychological testing.
Applicant’s  session   on   December  14,  2018:  He  was  uncooperative   with
treatment and  would rather talk about himself,  he  related  he  felt victimized
by a  woman  who raised a sexual assault allegation against him (see below
under  criminal conduct  discussion). He seems unwilling  to  engage  in  any
authentic therapeutic interventions;
Applicant’s session on  December 17, 2018: He may be  opening up but it is
hard for him to let go of blaming  his girlfriend;
Applicant’s  session   on   December  27,  2018:  He   is  forming   tenuous
therapeutic  alliance  after each  session  after he  initially enters  with  a  hostile,
irritable  attitude.  Once   he   opens  up   he   impresses  as  more  credible   and
empathy  for him  comes easier. He  is  beginning  to  talk   more authentically
about  his  conflicts   and   feelings   of  aloneness.  He   has   not   had   suicidal
ideations for at least a  month.
Applicant’s  session   on   January  4,  2019:   He  did   not   enter   session   with
hostility.  He talked  a  lot  about himself. He opened  up  about growing  up  with
guns and  they are a  part of his culture. He  expressed  that  no  one  ever being
there   for   him  and   this statement  might   offer an  opening   into   his personal
life.
Applicant’s  session   on   January  11,  2019:   He   presents  for  the   supportive
aspects  of  treatment  and   tends  to   become   argumentative   when   he   is
challenged.  He seems to  be  disinterested  in  real change  that can  come  from
psychotherapy.  However,  his  symptoms   have   reduced   dramatically  since
he   has  presented   himself  as  a   victim   regarding   the   sexual  contact
allegations.  He is  unauthentic and  he  is not  aware  that he  is presenting  that
way;
Applicant’s  session   on   January   14,  2019:   He  wants   to   come   off   his
medications  because  he  feels he  is underweight.  He  is  more focused  on  his
appearance  than  on  his current emotions.  He  is opening  up  to  some  degree
in therapy and  is gaining  some  minimal insight into  how his own behavior
has affected  his current  situation.   He  is   very   focused   on  the   women   who
have  wronged  him.  He wishes to  continue  treatment,  despite  his resistance
to it;
Applicant’s  session   on   February  22,   2019:   He  panicked   over  his  sexual
assault  charges,  so   his  reading   of   one   [Dr.  C’s]  notes   in  which   he   was
deemed  not credible  has weighted  meaning  at this time. He stated  that if he
lost  his sexual assault case  he  would kill himself. He also called  his mother
and told her the same  thing. He is contradictory in his reports of confirming
at the  same  time  denying  his suicidality.  (Note, on  this same  day, Dr. C was
informed   by   Applicant’s  First  Sergeant  that   Applicant   had   a   plan   to   kill
himself  with  a  gun  if  he  was  not discharged  from  the  Air  Force in  15  days.
Applicant had written a suicide  note.);
Applicant’s session  on  March 15,  2019: He  is  completely disengaged  from
treatment, is argumentative, and cannot be  pleased.
Applicant’s session  on   April 22, 2019: He attended  therapy  today despite
his complaint  that his treatment  is lacking.  He  seemed  lost  and  spoke  as if
treatment was his last  resort. He presented well-groomed and confident as
usual but he  seems confounded  about why he  is alone  and  what needs to
be  done  to  remedy his feelings of loneliness. He is distressed  about  leaving
the  Air  Force  which  is indicative of considerable ambivalence  on  his part as
he  also  complains  about   the   Air   Force  bitterly.  He  has  been   off   his
medications  for two  months. This was  the  last session  Applicant  attended
before his discharge from  the  Air Force. (GE  4 (pp. 33-37))
Dr. C’s final diagnosis was that Applicant presented with adjustment disorder with
depressed mood and anxiety. She summarized his overall progress during his sessions
as follows: “Patient  did  not improve  in  treatment and  was only checking  in  because  he
refused treatment but he was on the HIL (high interest list) and was required to check in.”
He did not have suicidal ideations at the beginning or the end of his sessions. She also
stated his prognosis is poor and that Applicant was unreliable and dishonest during the
course of treatment. (GE 4 (pp. 12-14)
In  Applicant’s  SOR  answer,  he  denied  that he  expressed  any  suicidal ideations
while  treated  at  the  Air  Force  mental  health  clinic  between  December  2018  and  April
2019. He also explained that he believed the prescription medication he was taking was
causing  “negative  feedback.”  In  his  hearing  testimony,  Applicant  admitted  he  had  a
difficult  relationship  with  Dr.  C.  He  believes  she  took  things  out  of  context.  He  also
disagreed with the medications she prescribed for him. He denied  telling Dr. C that he
would kill himself if he lost his sexual assault case. He denied telling Dr. C that he called
his mother and told her the same thing. He denied writing a suicide note that his First
Sergeant  disclosed.  I  do  not  find  Applicant’s  denials  credible  when viewed against  the
conflicting record evidence. (Tr. 77-78, 89-91; SOR answer)
In December 2021, Applicant consented to a psychological evaluation arranged by
the DOD. Dr. M, a board certified, licensed clinical psychologist, approved by the DOD,
was retained to conduct the evaluation on December 4 and December 21, 2021. Dr. M
conducted clinical interviews of Applicant, reviewed the medical records contained in GE
4,  reviewed  Applicant’s  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  medical  records,  and
conducted  psychological  testing,  including  The  Million  Clinical  Multiaxial  Inventory  4th
edition  (MCMI-IV)  and  the  Minnesota  Multiphasic  Personality  Inventory  3rd  edition
(MMPI-3). (GE 3)
Applicant’s MCMI-IV test produced a profile of a response style in need of social
approval  with  a  tendency  to  present  himself  in  a  favorable  light.  The  testing  results
showed  significant elevations  on  scales  related  to  histrionic,  turbulent,  and  narcissistic
personality patterns. The test showed that he also expressed general anxiety. The test
indicated  evidence  of  a  moderate  degree  of  emotional  lability  in  his  personality,  and
although  he  is  typically  able  to  function  adequately,  periods  of  marked  emotional,
cognitive, and behavior dysfunction are likely. (GE 3)
Applicant’s MMPI-3 test showed that the test’s validity scale raised concerns about
possible underreporting by him. However, the test was deemed valid. He presented as
well-adjusted, despite evidence to the contrary. The test revealed he likely engages in
compulsive behavior and displays a rigid, perfectionistic demeanor. The test showed no
evidence of disordered thinking or maladaptive behavior, but because of the possibility of
his underreporting, such behavior could not  be ruled out. (GE 3)
Based upon her overall evaluation, Dr. M concluded, “[Applicant] has a consistent
history of Mood Disorder and Adjustment Disorder, and although he does not currently
endorse any mental health symptoms, it is likely that he is minimizing due to the nature
of this evaluation.” Dr. M gave  the following prognosis: “[Applicant’s] prognosis is poor.
He lacks insight into his mental health condition, and he is unable to admit even minor
flaws.” Additionally, she stated that the inconsistencies between Applicant’s self-report of
his  mental  health  history  and  his  current  condition  contrasted  to  the  documented
treatment history call into question his judgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness.
(GE 3)
In  his SOR answer, Applicant indicated  that at the  time  of Dr. M’s evaluation  he
had  been  off  his  anti-depressant  medications  for  about  six  months.  Without  stating  it
directly, he implied that this had some impact on him at the time of the evaluation. He
denied suffering from bi-polar mood disorder, however, Dr. M did not specifically diagnose
him  with  that  disorder.  She  stated  that  without  further  testing  (a  neuropsychological
evaluation), the diagnostic picture was complicated. He has seen a therapist through the
VA two times in the past year. He provided some medical records from the VA, but none
contained any diagnoses or prognosis. He does not have any future sessions scheduled.

Criminal  Conduct  (Guideline   J)   and  Drug  Involvement   and   Substance   Abuse
(Guideline H)
In  October  2018,  while  Applicant  was  in  the  Air  Force,  he  tested  positive  for
testosterone,  a  schedule  III  controlled  substance,  during  a  urinalysis  test.  Further
investigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) discovered three
witnesses who either saw Applicant inject himself with testosterone or other steroids, or
to whom Applicant admitted that he used such substances. A residential search revealed
that Applicant possessed a box of unused 31-gauge syringes and a vial of bacteriostatic
water. Based upon the foregoing, in January 2019, Applicant was administered Article 15
UCMJ proceedings by his commander for a violation of UCMJ Article 112a, wrongful use
of a controlled substance. After consulting with a lawyer, Applicant accepted the Article
15  proceedings,  rather  than  requesting  trial  by  court-martial.  After  making  a  written
presentation to his commander, his commander found him guilty of the offense and issued
punishment of a one grade reduction-in-rank and a reprimand. (GE 2, 7-8)
In January 2019, Applicant tested positive during another urinalysis for letrozole,
another controlled substance. Applicant was again offered Article 15 punishment, which
he accepted. His commander found him guilty of the offense and issued punishment of a
one grade reduction-in-rank and a reprimand. (GE 2, 7, 9)
In explaining these two drug incidents, Applicant claimed he took over-the-counter
boosters and was unaware that they may have contained prohibited substances. He also
claimed  that he  never received  the  actual urinalysis test  results, so  he  was  unsure how
the   substances  could   have   been   in  his  body.  In   his  hearing   testimony,  he   denied
knowingly using  illegal steroids and  injecting  himself with  any type  of steroid. He admitted
testing  positive  on  the  two  urinalyses.  I  did  not find  Applicant’s  testimony  credible  given
the  corroboration  evidence  for  the  positive  tests results  (three  witnesses and  the  search
results). (Tr. 69-70, 72; GE 2; SOR answer)
In  February 2019, Applicant’s former girlfriend  reported  to  the  AFOSI that when
she  and  Applicant  were  living  together  in  October  2018,  he  touched  her  in  a  sexual
manner on three occasions. She claimed she told him to stop on each occasion. Applicant
was  later  questioned  by  the  AFOSI  and  he  denied  any  nonconsensual  touching.  The
investigation  was  forwarded  to  Applicant’s  command  for  potential  criminal  action.  The
command decided that there was  insufficient evidence to act upon. During his hearing
testimony, he denied this allegation. Additionally, he claimed he was a victim of sexual
assault by his former girlfriend. (Tr. 45-48; GE 10)
Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  Air  Force  in  May  2019,  at  the  end  of  his
enlistment.  His  discharge  was  characterized  as  a  general  discharge,  under  honorable
conditions. (GE 1-2)
Personal Conduct (Guideline  E)
Applicant filled out an SCA in August 2019. In Section 21 of the SCA, he was asked
if  he  had  ever  been  hospitalized  for  a  mental  health  condition.  He  answered  “no.”
Applicant admitted he was voluntarily hospitalized in November 2018, for a 36-hour period
in a behavioral health facility. He claimed in his SOR answer that it was not related to
mental  health  issues.  Earlier  during  his  background  investigation,  he  admitted  the
treatment was for anxiety and depression issues. He told the investigator he was not sure
he should list it. (Tr. 55-56, GE 1-2; SOR answer)
In Section 23 of the SCA, Applicant was asked if, within the last seven years, he
had  used  any  illegal  drugs  or  controlled  substances.  He  was  also  asked  if,  within  the
same  time  period,  he  used  illegal  drugs  or  controlled  substances  while  possessing  a
security clearance. He answered “no” to both questions. That answer was false because
Applicant was used illegal steroids between July and October 2018 and December 2018
and January 2019. He held a security clearance at the time of these uses. In Section 15
of  the  SCA,  Applicant  listed  information  about  his  military  history.  In  the  subsection
inquiring about discipline, Applicant disclosed his discipline under Article 15 for positive
drug tests. This is similar information that should have been disclosed in Section 23, as
described above. (GE1)
In  Section  25  of the  SCA,  Applicant was asked  if he  ever had  a  security clearance
eligibility/access  authorization  denied,  suspended, or revoked?  He  answered  “no.” This
answer was false because  on December 3, 2018, his military commander issued a letter
suspending  Applicant’s access to  classified information. Applicant acknowledged  receipt
of   this   letter  and   signed   for  it  on   December   4,  2018.  In   his  SOR  response,  Applicant
admitted  improperly  answering  this  question.  He  did  not  provide  a  reason  why  he
answered improperly. (GE 1; SOR answer)
Applicant provided a letter of support from his current girlfriend. She stated that
when they started dating in May 2020, he disclosed a mood disorder to her resulting from
the death of his fiancée in January 2020. He was taking medication  at that time. After
about a year, he decided to come off his medications. After doing his own research, he
stopped taking the prescribed medications. She further stated that since coming off the
medications, he is a new man. She feels coming off his medication was the best choice
for him. (AE A-B)

with the U.S. Navy.
1.e. Applicant admits that in about June or July of 2019, he engaged in indiscreet
sexual conduct by using the sex toys of friends to masturbate, in their home and without
their knowledge.
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct  & Guideline K - Handling Protected Information
2.a. and 4.a. Applicant admits that in about January of 2018, he failed to timely
report  a  security  violation  to  the  National  Security  Agency  (NSA)  Security,  when  he
printed  out  and  removed  a  classified  SECRET  document  from  a  secure  space  and
brought it to his residence.
2.b. and  4.b. Applicant admits that in about March of 2019, he failed to timely report
a security violation to the National Security Agency (NSA) Security, when he brought an
unauthorized thumb drive inside his secure workplace.

"Applicant  is  a  23-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  April  2021.  He  earned  a  commercial  diving  certificate  in  March  2021.
There is no other evidence of his education in the record. He has never married and has
no children. (Items 3, 8)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  failing  to  abide  by  established  laws,  rules,  and
regulations. In April 2019,  police  charged him  with a misdemeanor offense of  reckless
driving/bad brakes after he wrecked his vehicle. After he paid court costs and fines, the
court dismissed these charges after ordering a deferred disposition. In September 2020,
police  charged  him  with  speeding  79  miles  per  hour  (mph)  in  a  60  mph  zone.  He
pleaded guilty  and  paid  a  fine  before his court  date.  He  claimed  that  his speedometer
was defective. In May 2021, police charged him with reckless driving for driving 82 mph
in a 60 mph zone. The court entered a deferred disposition on these charges. However,
it  later  entered  a  show  cause  order  against  him  for  a  probation  violation  because  he
failed to check in with his community service supervisor. Ultimately, the court dismissed
the show cause order and he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of defective equipment.
He  claimed  that he completed all community service  and  driving  improvement  classes
related to these charges. (Items 2, 9, 10)
In  about  April  2021,  Applicant  began  dating  a  woman  (girlfriend).  After  several
months,  he  and  his  girlfriend  began  having  problems  with  their  relationship.  In  June
2021, they had an argument and he grabbed her by her hair and attempted to pull her
into his car. In September 2021, he attempted to strangle her. His girlfriend did not file
criminal charges at the time these events occurred. (Items 2, 4-7, 9)
In  late  December  2021,  Applicant  was  visiting  his  girlfriend  from  out  of  town
around  Christmastime.  At  some  point  during  his  visit,  they  began  arguing.  During  the
argument,  he  attempted  to  strangle  her  and  threatened  to  “slump”  her  and  her  family.
Given the context, I find that he meant that he would physically harm her and her family.
On  December  24,  2021,  his  girlfriend  went  to  the  local  magistrate’s  office  and  had  a
protective  order  (PO)  issued  against  him.  The  PO  prohibited  him  from  having  contact
with his girlfriend. While she was applying for the PO, he harassed her by calling her on
her cell phone numerous times. (Items 2, 4, 6)
Early on December 25, 2021, when police attempted to serve Applicant with the
PO,  he  evaded  their  efforts  and  was  verbally  abusive  towards  them  over  the  phone.
Police  eventually  found  him  “hunkered  down  in  the  driver’s  seat”  of  his  vehicle,  which
was across the street from his girlfriend’s residence. They asked him to exit his vehicle,
but  he  refused,  so  they  physically  escorted  him.  They  served  him  with  the  PO  and
arrested  him.  Police  charged  him  with  stalking  and  obstruction  of  justice.  Later  that
morning, he was released on bond and admonished that he must abide by the terms of
the PO. Instead, in direct violation of the PO, on December 26, 2021, he went over to
his  girlfriend’s  parent’s  house  where  she  resided.  He  claimed  that  she  let  him  in  the
house. He also contacted her repeatedly on her cell phone and met her in the parking
lot of a restaurant. He claimed that he was trying to get his wallet back that he had left
at  her  house.  Regardless,  once  she  returned  his  wallet  in  the  parking  lot,  he  reached
into her car and grabbed her arm. After this incident, she drove to the police department
to file criminal charges against him. Uncowed, he followed her in his vehicle at least part
of the way to the police station. (Items 2, 4, 6-9)
That  same  day,  police  arrested  Applicant  again  and  charged  him  with  violating
the  PO,  stalking,  and  assault  and  battery.  The  next  day,  his  girlfriend  filed  a  criminal
complaint  against  him  for  grabbing  her  by  the  hair  in  June  2021  and  strangling  her  in
September 2021. On December 28, 2021, he was arrested for the third time in four days
and charged with committing assault and battery in September 2021. Courts ultimately
found him guilty of two violations of the PO. He was sentenced to six months in jail with
five  months  and  29  days  suspended.  The  court  either  dismissed  or  entered  orders  of
nolle  prosequi  on  the  remaining  charges.  The  court  also  entered  additional  protective
orders  that  prohibited  Applicant  from  having  contact  with  his  girlfriend  until  as  late  as
February 2024. On December 28, 2022, because of his criminal charges, he was barred
for  30  days  from  the  military  base  where  he  worked.  All  his  aforementioned  criminal
behavior is corroborated by police reports and court records. (Items 2, 4-10)
Applicant was required to divulge the crimes that resulted in his December 2021
arrests  on  the  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  he  submitted  in
January 2022 (six days after his last arrest). He failed to do so. While it was not alleged
in the SOR, he did not volunteer these arrests to the DOD investigator during his August
2022 security interview. Instead, he was evasive about his criminal conduct. When the
investigator  asked  Applicant  about  these  arrests,  he  declined  to  elaborate  on  them,
merely  claiming  that  he  and  his  girlfriend  were  going  through  “stuff”  and  “relationship
things.”  Applicant failed to elaborate on his underlying conduct related to these arrests
until the DOD investigator asked him multiple times and confronted him with his arrests.
He has denied stalking  or physically harming his girlfriend. He also  denied threatening
to harm his girlfriend and  her family. He has not undergone any behavioral counseling
or treatment. He claimed he did not divulge his criminal charges on the SF 86 because
he  did  not  read  the  questions  carefully,  and  he  thought  he  did  not  need  to  disclose
charges for which he was awaiting court dates. (Items 2-9)
A credit report reflects that Applicant’s federal student loan account was charged
off by August 2022. The Government listed this account in SOR ¶ 2.a. An August 2022
credit  report  reflected  a  last  payment  date  of  July  2021.  The  credit  reports  reflect  that
the account was past due in the amount of $4,718 with a total loan balance of $44,082.
A  February  2023  credit  report  reflects  that  the  account  is  still  charged  off,  but  that
Applicant  is paying under a partial  payment agreement of  $222 per month.  This credit
report reflects a last payment date of January 2023. However, since about March 2020,
federal  student  loans  repayments  have  been  deferred  under  various  executive  orders
because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  There  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant’s  federal
student  loan  account  was  delinquent  before  the  payments  on  it  were  deferred  by
Presidential executive order. (Items 2, 11, 12)
Any  adverse  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  used  for
disqualification  purposes,  however  it  may  be  considered  in  assessing  an  applicant’s
credibility;  in  evaluating  an  applicant’s  evidence  of extenuation, mitigation,  or changed

rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3

December 2014 and in the Army Reserve from 2015 to June 2018. He was honorably
discharged from active duty but was administratively separated from the Army Reserve
under other than honorable conditions (OTH Separation). He was also reduced in rank
from  Specialist  to  Private  First  Class.  He  claims  he  was  separated  from  the  Reserve
because he missed monthly drills due to an injury. He has held a security clearance since
about 2010. He earned a bachelor’s degree in June 2018 after attending college classes
part time. He has also pursued two professional certifications. Since his discharge from
active duty, he has worked for a defense contractor on two occasions, April 2017 through
September  2019  and  January  2021  to  the  present.  He  is  seeking  national  security

When  he  served  in  the  Army  on  active  duty,  Applicant’s  duty  station  was  in
Colorado Springs, Colorado. He never deployed. He has a 100% disability rating from the
Department of Veterans Affairs. He suffers from service-related depression and anxiety.
(Tr. at 18, 68-69; AE F.)
Applicant testified that he received the OTH Separation in July 2018 from the Army
Reserve due to his inability to report to Reserve drilling because he was bedridden after
a motorcycle accident in the summer of 2015. He testified that he advised his command
of  his  disability  and  his  inability  to  drill  with  his  unit.  He  did  not  appear  before  an
administrative  separation  board.  He  received  a  letter  advising  him  that  he  was  being
separated  under  other  than  honorable  conditions.  Upon  being  questioned,  he
acknowledged  that  he  missed  drills  for  “a  year  or  two”  in  the  2017-to-2018  period.  He
subsequently limited the time he missed drills to “a year.” He then could not explain the
three-year time gap between the motorcycle accident and his separation in July 2018. He
thought he had  communicated  his situation  properly  to  his squadron  leader but  admitted
there must have  been   “a lack of communication.” He testified  that he  texted  his leader
about five  times  regarding  his condition  over a  period  of  about a  year, but  never made  a
phone call. (Tr. at 30-40.)
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct
The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because of his
criminal  conduct,  which  raises  questions  about  his
judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness;  and  about  his  ability  and  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and
regulations.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denied  the  allegation  of  criminal  conduct.  The
specifics  of  the  charges,  the  underlying  conduct,  and  the  prosecution  are  as  follows:
1.a. May 2018 Spousal Assault. Applicant was charged with Assault by Means
Likely to Produce Great Bodily Injury and four counts of Battery. His wife, the victim in this
assault, declined to prosecute Applicant, and the District Attorney dropped the charges.
The local City Attorney then filed charges. Applicant entered into an agreement with the
prosecutor in 2022 or 2023, which provided that the charges would be dismissed in April
2023 if Applicant complied with the terms and conditions of the agreement. The charges
were dismissed about two weeks before the DOHA hearing. (Tr. at 22-23, 541; GE 1 at
Section 22; GE 5; AE D.)
The police report of the incident reflects the date and time of the domestic violence
incident as May 25, 2018, at 7:40 am. The police were called and arrived at Applicant’s
residence. They took a statement from Applicant’s wife. The police statement provides a
detailed  description  of  Applicant’s  actions  that  morning,  which  began  with  yelling  by
Applicant because his wife woke him up to go to work. He then threw a blanket over his
wife’s head and strangled her with his hand or arm for about 30 seconds. She could not
breathe during that period. She freed herself from his grip, and he pushed her face onto
a couch cushion for about a minute when she again could not breathe. She freed herself
and tried to escape. Applicant then grabbed her hair and banged her head against a wall
10 to 15 times. Four days after the incident, a police officer met with Applicant’s wife and
read her statement to her. He asked if everything she said in her statement was correct,
and she affirmed that it was. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied everything in the
statement starting with her comment that she woke him up that morning so that he could
go to work. (Tr. at 44-45; GE 4 at 23, 29, 40.)
The police also took a statement from a neighbor (the Witness), who lived in the
apartment  above  Applicant’s  residence.  The  Witness  reported  that  she  heard  an
argument in Applicant’s apartment and then screams from Applicant’s wife. She believed
that her neighbor was in distress. She also heard thumping noises. The Witness decided
she  should  intervene  and  knocked  on  the  door  to  Applicant’s  apartment  and  rang  the
doorbell. Applicant answered the door and reported to her that everything was fine. The
Witness entered  the  apartment  and  found  Applicant’s wife  sitting  on  the  floor, “shaking
and  crying  hysterically.” The  Witness returned  to her apartment and  shortly thereafter,
Applicant’s wife appeared at her door. She told the Witness that Applicant hits her often
and gets upset with her when she tries to wake him up so he can go to work. The Witness
called 911 and reported the domestic violence incident. In an email dated June 27, 2022,
Applicant’s wife wrote that she called the police. Applicant testified that none of what the
Witness  told  the  police  was  correct.  The  police  report  described  the  wife’s  demeanor
when they arrived as “upset,” “crying,” “fearful,” and “nervous,” confirming the Witness’s
statement about her condition that morning. Applicant testified that he did not recall his
wife’s demeanor that morning before he left their home for work. (Tr. at 45-50; GE 4 at
19, 29, 32; AE G at 1.)
Applicant’s  wife  also  reported  to  the  police  that  Applicant  had  been  physically
violent with her in the past. She said that he had been physically abusive to her throughout
their 17 months of marriage, which is when she immigrated from Japan and they began
to cohabitate. She told the police that about once a month he would grab her hair or her
head  and  slam  her  head  into  a  wall  in  their  apartment.  She  never  sustained  serious
injuries and was never hospitalized. She did not seek medical attention after the May 25,
2018 incident, though she did complain about head pain. Applicant denied that he had
ever physically abused his wife. (Tr. at 52; GE 4 at 22.)
After her interview by the police, Applicant’s wife requested that she be taken to a
women’s shelter. She asked that the Witness accompany her. The police took her to a
facility for placement in a shelter. Later that day, Applicant’s wife obtained a restraining
order against her husband. Applicant was also ordered to be removed from the couple’s
residence. A few months after the May 2018 incident, a more limited protective order was
entered, and Applicant was allowed to return to his residence. That order was continued
to at least January 2022, according to the court records, though Applicant testified that
the order was lifted. Applicant provided an undated document that reflects the dismissal
of the restraining order proceeding. (Tr. at 51; GE 4 at 24, 40-47; AE B.)
Applicant denies that any assault occurred on May 25, 2018, or at any other time.
He  testified  that  one  morning  in  May  2018,  he  had  an  argument  with  his  wife  and  the
argument  attracted  the  attention  of  their  neighbor,  the  Witness.  He  claims  that  the
allegations against him were made up by his wife at the urgings of the Witness with whom
Applicant and his wife had an unfriendly relationship. He blames the bad, “aggressive”
relationship on the neighbor frequently asking him and his wife for financial assistance or
to borrow personal property. He testified that he declined all such requests. He claimed
that as a result of their interactions, Applicant and his wife were “on bad terms” with the
Witness. (Tr. at 19-21.)
Applicant testified that after the argument with his wife, he went to work. The police
came to his home while he was at work. When he returned home, he learned that he had
been “evicted” from his residence. Based upon the police investigative report, the District
Attorney’s  office  filed  five  domestic  violence  charges  against  Applicant,  including  one
felony  charge.  Applicant  insisted  that  the  Witness  encouraged  his  wife  to  make  the
complaint  against  him  and  that  the  charges  were  false.  He  attributed  his  wife  being
manipulated  by the  Witness  or misunderstanding  the  police  due  to  her poor English  skills.
(Tr. at  21-25; GE 3 at 9.)
Applicant’s  wife  was  born  in  Japan  and  lived  there  until  she  immigrated  to  the
United  States  in  January  2017  to  marry  Applicant.  Her  primary  language  is  Japanese
though at the time of their marriage she spoke some English. She had studied English
when she was in school and had traveled to the United States in 2015 when she first met
Applicant.  He testified that although he spoke  a little Japanese, they  communicated  in
English while they were dating and communicating long-distance. Before they had their
child  in  October  2019,  Applicant’s  wife  worked  in  a  restaurant  where  she  “had  to”
communicate in English. (Tr. at 21-29, 40-44, 62; GE 1 at 36.)
GE 5 contains a court record for a proceeding in which Applicant’s wife appeared
and addressed the court in English on April 24, 2019, less than a year after the incident
with Applicant. The court found that an interpreter was not needed because she could
understand and speak English. The initial police report also shows that Applicant’s wife
was  able  to  communicate  clearly  with  the  police  about  the  incident  in  a  one-on-one
interview. As noted, she also confirmed to the police the accuracy of her statement four
days later. (GE 4 at 22-24; GE 5 at 6.)
Mitigation
Applicant’s  wife  prepared  an  email,  dated  June  27,  2022,  addressed  to  the
prosecutor in her husband’s criminal case. In her communication, she asked for help in
having the case dismissed. At that time, his case was scheduled for trial the next month.
She wrote that she regretted calling the police in 2018 “every day.” She noted that prior
to the incident, she had suffered a back injury in 2017 and had surgery in March 2018.
She commented that she was stressed after her surgery  and called the police after an
argument  with  her  husband.  She  also  wrote  that  a  neighbor  “told  me  I  should  call  the
police.” The record evidence reflects that the prosecutor ultimately offered Applicant an
agreement that terminated the case on April 25, 2023, after Applicant completed an eight-
week  anger  management/domestic  violence  course  on  March  4,  2023.  He  was  also
required to be “booked.” (Tr. at 23-24, 54-56; AE D; AE G at 1; AE I; AE J.)
Applicant submitted two letters (and duplicate copies of the letters) of support. The
letters were dated April 19, 2018, which was before the domestic violence incident and
the criminal charges, and April 22, 2019. Applicant worked for this employer from 2017 to
2019. He has since worked for two other companies. One letter from an executive of his
former employer praised Applicant’s excellent customer service. The second letter was
prepared  by  Applicant’s  former  manager.  He  noted  Applicant’s  professionalism  in  the
handling of his duties and his care for his wife after she suffered a serious injury. (AE G;
AE K; AE L.)
",False
"Applicant is a 33-year-old, single woman with two children, ages 14 and 6. She is
a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. (Item 2 at 10) She has been
working for a federal government contractor as a security alarms dispatcher since 2021
(Item 2 at 12).
Over  the  years,  Applicant  incurred  approximately  $58,000  of  delinquent  debt.
(Answer  at  5)  Approximately  $54,000  consists  of  student  loan  debt,  as  alleged  in
subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, a credit card account, as alleged in subparagraph 1.c, and a
medical bill, as alleged in subparagraph 1.d. Applicant attributes her difficulty with keeping
up with her debts to the difficulties of making ends meet as a single mother of two children.
(Item  2  at  4)  The  credit  account  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.c,  totaling,  $1,921,  was
opened,  unbeknownst  to  her,  by  her  ex-boyfriend,  an  authorized  card  user,  and  she
incurred  the  medical  bill,  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.d,  totaling  $1,333,  after  a  car
accident.
Applicant  contends  that  she  applied  for  a  student  loan  debt  relief  plan  that  will
forgive $20,000 of the debt, and she promised to set up a payment plan to satisfy the
remainder once the $20,000 was forgiven. (Item 1 at 4) Applicant provided no proof of a
loan forgiveness application, nor did she provide proof that part of her student loan debt
has been forgiven, or that she has arranged a payment plan.
Applicant closed the account alleged in subparagraph 1.c, and contends that she
will  pay  the  balance  once  she  receives  an  insurance  settlement  from  an  automobile
accident in which she was involved. (Item 1 at 4) Similarly, Applicant contends that she
will  satisfy  the  medical  bill,  as  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.d,  after  she  receives  the
settlement.
In September 2008, while at home  breastfeeding her newborn child, Applicant’s
then boyfriend began to beat her. Attempting to escape his abuse, Applicant ran to her
kitchen. Her then boyfriend  chased  her into the  kitchen  and did not  stop  attempting to
beat her until she grabbed a kitchen knife and cut him.  (Item 1 at 4) Subsequently, he
contacted  the  police,  who  arrested  Applicant  the  next  day,  and  charged  her  with
possessing  an  instrument  of  a  crime,  simple  assault,  aggravated  assault,  reckless
endangering, terroristic threats, harassment, and attempted criminal homicide. The state
later dismissed the charges after concluding that Applicant acted in self defense. (Item 6
at 7) Applicant no longer has contact with her ex-boyfriend. (Item 6 at 7)
One morning before going to work, Applicant’s mother, who typically took care of
Applicant’s child  while she  was at work, called  and  told her that she  was running  late.
Afraid to be late to work, Applicant contacted a neighbor who agreed to watch the child
until Applicant’s mother arrived. Applicant then left for work and told the neighbor to enter
the home through the unlocked back door.
The neighbor did not come to the home immediately, as promised. (Item 1 at 4)
While no caregivers were present, Applicant’s child, then eight years old, attempted to
cook food, and started a fire. Ultimately, the child exited the house without being harmed,
and  his  grandmother  arrived  before  the  fire  could  spread.  Applicant,  however,  was
charged  with  endangering  the  welfare  of  a  child,  and  recklessly  endangering  another
person.  After  completing  40  hours  of  court-ordered  volunteer  work,  the  charges  were
dismissed. (Item 4 at 4)
In  the  fall  of  2020,  Applicant  enrolled  her  son  in  a  private  school.  (Item  1  at  4)
Frustrated  with  the  harder  schoolwork  and  the  transfer,  in  general,  Applicant’s  son
became  rebellious,  frequently  misbehaving  in  school  and  not  performing  his  assigned
tasks.  Applicant  disciplined  him  by  periodically  taking  away  his  video  games,  his  cell
phone, his laptop computer, and his extracurricular activities. (Item 1 at 5) In June 2020,
after the principal notified Applicant that he was going to expel her son, Applicant whipped
her son five to six times with a switch. (Item 4 at 11)
The  next  day,  Applicant  told  a  classmate, who  then told a  school administrator.
Subsequently, child protective services initiated an investigation and discovered welts on
Applicant’s child’s legs that were indicative of the type of beating that he described to his
classmate.  Subsequently,  in  July  2021,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
possessing  an  instrument  of  a  crime,  simple  assault,  aggravated  assault,  and
endangering  the  welfare  of  a  child.  (Item  1  at  4)  Applicant  voluntarily  began  parenting
classes. Later, she pleaded guilty to simple assault, and agreed to continue the parenting
classes and attend therapy, as part of probation. (1 at 5) After she completed these steps,
the child protective services case was closed and the criminal case was dismissed. (Item
1 at 11)
In December 2015, Applicant was fired from her job for bringing her child to work,
as alleged in subparagraph 3.b. (Item 1 at 6) In April 2017, and later in September 2019,
Applicant  was  fired  from  her  employment  for  repeated  tardiness,  as  alleged  in
subparagraphs  3.c  and  3.d,  respectively.  (Item  1  at  6)  Applicant’s  problems  with  job
stability resulted from difficulties balancing her work schedule and care for her children,
as  a  single  parent.  Specifically,  she  could  not  afford  professional  daycare  and  was
dependent on friends and family to watch her children. If they were late to her home to
pick up her children, she was late to work, or in the situation alleged in subparagraph 3.b,
if  a child-care provider cancelled at the  last minute, she had to take  her  child to  work.
(Item 1 at 12)
In  addition  to  repeated  tardiness,  Applicant’s  employer,  as  referenced  in
subparagraph 3.d, fired her for job abandonment. Applicant denied that she abandoned
the  job  and  contended  that  she  stopped  coming  to  work  after  being  injured  in  a  car
accident.  Despite  successfully  applying for leave  under the  Family Medical  Leave Act,
her employer construed her failure to come to work as job abandonment, and denied her
request  for  unemployment  benefits.  Applicant  appealed  this  decision,  and  the
unemployment commission ruled in her favor, and concluded that her failure to come to
work did not constitute job abandonment. (Item 1 at 12)

"Applicant  is  35  years old,  unmarried,  and  has  no  children.  He  attended  college
during the period of 2006 to 2011 and earned a bachelor’s degree. He took post-graduate
classes during the period of 2011 to 2015 and earned a master’s degree. He was granted
a security clearance in June 2009 in connection with summer employment with a DoD
contractor while attending college. He was granted a clearance again in 2011 following
his undergraduate graduation when he was employed by a U.S. Navy facility. He applied
for a higher-level clearance in or about 2016, and his clearance application was denied
due  to  his  prior  drug  use  after  being  granted  access  to  classified  information.  He  has
worked  for  a  U.S.  Government  contractor  since  April  2015.  He  is  presently  seeking  a
security clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 9-11, 30-32; GE 1 at 38-39; GE
2 at 38-40; AE G.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 1 are as follows:
1.a. In August 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the
Influence of alcohol (DUI). He attended a wedding reception prior to his arrest and drank
beer for three to four hours. He went to the party intending to drive home, and he believed
he  was  sufficiently  sober  to  drive.  He  was  stopped  due  to  poor  driving,  and  his  BAC
following the arrest was 0.15%. The arrest occurred three days before he submitted his
2021 e-QIP. (Tr. at 11-16, 47; GE 2 at 38.)
Applicant  pled  guilty  to  DUI  and  was  given  a  standard  first-offender  sentence
requiring  him  to  attend  a  three-month  alcohol  education  and  awareness  course.  The
requirements of the  course  included attendance at meetings of Alcoholics  Anonymous
and Mothers Against  Drunk Driving. The state motor vehicle  department (DMV) imposed
a  three-year  restriction   on   his  license,  which   will   end   in  2025.  The   DMV   also  required
Applicant to  have  a  breathalyzer interlock device  on  his car for a  period.  (Tr. at 14-15, 42-
43; 45; AE K; AE L.)
1.b.  Applicant experienced a prior arrest related to his use of alcohol. In 2015, he
and his then-girlfriend went to a bar. Applicant believes that someone added a drug to his
drink. He wrote in the Answer that a friend accompanied  him and his former girlfriend,
and the friend also believed he was drugged. Applicant has no memory of the events of
the evening. He believes his female companion was the actual target of the drug incident.
He claims that he subsequently learned that he went to a second bar where he had an
altercation with the bar’s bouncer. He was arrested and charged with Drunk in Public. He
hired  a  lawyer,  and  the  charge  was  dropped.  Applicant  submitted  no  corroborating
testimony regarding his claim that he was drugged, such as a written statement from the
friend who accompanied him to the first bar. (Tr. at 16-18, 35, 47; AE J at 2.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 2 are as follows:
2.a.  After  having  been  granted  access  to  classified  information  during  2011,
Applicant  attended  two  concerts  with  a  friend.  The  friend  gave  him  MDMA  (Ecstasy)
during  both  concerts,  which  occurred  in  or  about  December  2014  and  October  2015.
Applicant  took  the  illegal  drug  knowing  that  to  do  so  was  inconsistent  with  his
responsibilities and commitments as a person granted access to classified information.
He asserted at the hearing that these were just two instances of poor judgment. (Tr. at
18-19, 46.)
2.b. Beginning  in high  school and  extending  through  his college  years and  his post-
graduate   education   when   he   worked   at   a   DoD  facility,  Applicant   used   marijuana.  He
claims that  his  use  during  the  period  of 2010  to  2015  was  limited  to  four occasions.  (Tr.
at 19-21; AE G.)
The record contains his 2011 security clearance application in which he wrote that
his last use was in 2007  when he  was in high  school. He asserted, “I was young and I
have  no  desire  to  use  it  again.”  He  was  granted  a  clearance.  In  his  2021  e-QIP,  he
contradicted his disclosure in his 2011 security clearance application, that his last use of
marijuana was in 2007, by disclosing that his first use during the relevant time period was
in May 2010. He partially blamed his former girlfriend for his poor judgment in using illegal
drugs.  His  current  girlfriend  uses  marijuana  on  a  regular  basis  for  medical  purposes.
Applicant denied that her use of marijuana has any effect on his abstinence. He repeated
his 2011 statement regarding  his intent  not  to  use  marijuana  in the  future  by writing,  “I
have no desire to partake in these activities now or in the future.” (GE 1 at 36-37; GE 2
at 35.)
The Government does not allege in the SOR another government agency’s (AGA)
denial  of  Applicant’s  national  security  eligibility.  The  SOR  also  does  not  cross  allege,
under Guideline J, Applicant’s criminal conduct using illegal drugs.
Paragraph 3  (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 3 are as follows:
3.a.  The  Government  cross-alleges  the  two  alcohol-related  offenses  under
Guideline J under the guideline for Alcohol Consumption.
3.b. The SOR further alleges that Applicant continues to consume alcohol despite
his two alcohol-related arrests and his completion of a three-month alcohol education and
awareness program, which was required pursuant to his DUI sentence. Applicant asserts
that he drinks much less following his 2021 DUI arrest. He claims he now only drinks a
couple times a week at dinner on weekends. He acknowledged that he sometimes drinks
to the point of intoxication and has blacked out in the past, though not more than once a
year. He last drank excessively in the summer of 2021 at a friend’s birthday party. (Tr. at
25-26; 38-39.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 4 are as follows:
4.a. The Government cross-alleges the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b,
2.a, 2.b, and 3.b under Personal Conduct guideline.
Mitigation
Applicant provided extensive evidence in mitigation of the security concerns raised
by his conduct as detailed above. I have thoroughly reviewed all of the evidence, and it
is unnecessary to describe it at length. In summary, he has provided written statements
of  intent  to  not  repeat  his  past  misuse  of  alcohol  and  illegal  drugs.  He  has  provided
evidence of alcohol and drug tests taken to show that, on the days he was tested and for
periods  preceding  the  tests,  he  had  not  used  alcohol  or  illegal  drugs.  He  submitted
evidence of awards, bonuses, and favorable performance evaluations he  has received
from  his employer. He  provided  copies of his bachelor’s and  master’s degrees and  his
driver’s license. Applicant’s evidence includes five reference letters in which the authors
praise Applicant’s many admirable qualities and good character. (AE A through R.)

"Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 3.a. She admitted
SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.c, 3.a, 3.b, 4.a, 4.b, 4.d, 4.e and 4.f with explanations. She partially
admitted and denied SOR ¶ 3.c and denied ¶ 4.c. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony,
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  39  years old.  She  is a  high  school graduate  and  has  earned  some
college credits. She is twice married and divorced. She has four children, two from her
second  marriage  and  two from a  relationship.1 She receives child support for all of the
children.  She  has  been  employed by  a  federal contractor,  her current  employer,  since
2018. (Tr. 26-30; GE 1
Applicant’s mother is a Polish citizen who lives in Cuba. She moved  there in  1989
after  marrying   a   Cuban   national.  They  divorced   and   she   remarried   another  Cuban
national. They are no  longer married, but her mother remained  in Cuba. Applicant has
daily  contact  with   her through   a   cell   phone   application.   She   occasionally  will   send   her
money  and   medicine,   but  never  more  than   $1,000   annually.  Her   mother  receives  a
pension  from  Germany where  she  lived  and  worked  before  moving  to  Cuba.  When  her
mother moved  in 1989,  Applicant went with  her. Applicant was 15  years old when  she  left
Cuba.  Applicant  has no  intention  of  living  there  again.  Her mother worked  for a  short time
in the clothing business but has not been employed  for a long  time. Her mother  does not
have   any  direct  ties  to   the   government  of  Cuba.  Her  mother  visited   her  in  the   United
States  in approximately 2007, and  she  visited  her mother in  Cuba  in 2019.  (Tr. 30-31,  58-
59-62, 65-69, 110)
Applicant’s half-brother was born in Cuba and now lives in Germany. Their mother
was able to get him a Polish passport due to her citizenship, which allowed him to move.
Applicant did not know when he moved. He has a family and job in Germany as a train
conductor. She does not know how long her half-brother has lived in Germany. She does
not know if he is a Cuban citizen. Applicant communicates with him about once a month
through the cell phone application. (Tr. 59,63-65, 67-68)
SOR ¶ 4.f alleges and Applicant admitted that she and her husband at the time
filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  had  approximately  $45,000  of  debts  discharged  in
December 2008. (GE 13)
Applicant was arrested and charged with battery in 2008. She testified she could
not recall the facts but believed she and a person she was in a relationship with at the
time were both arrested because they had a fight. In August 2015, she was arrested and
charged  with  felony burglary of  an  occupied dwelling  and damage to  property-criminal
mischief over $200 and under $1,000. She broke a car side mirror when she was angry
at her partner for cheating on her. She was required to pay restitution. In August 2016,
Applicant was arrested and charged with felony aggravated assault-domestic violence,
and two charges of battery-domestic violence. All of the charges for these incidents were
dismissed/nolle prossed. Applicant admitted she was arrested and charged. She stated
that she was required to pay restitution for damage she did to her boyfriend’s vehicle. All
of  these  cases  stem  from  arguments  and  disagreements  with  her  ex-husband  or  ex-
boyfriend. She testified that her boyfriend told the police lies and none of the incidents
happened the way he said they did. She is no longer with either of them, and she asserted
that she has not been involved in any criminal activity since 2016. (Tr. 31-38, 70-80; GE
4, 5, 6, 7)
1 Applicant could not recall the dates of her first marriage and did not list it in her Electronic Questionnaires
for Investigation Processing (e-QIP).
Applicant admitted that in about May 2008 she received a court-issued judgment
of eviction for failure to pay rent (SOR ¶ 4.e). She explained in her SOR answer that she
and her then husband and father to two of her children decided to divorce. She was not
working  at  the  time,  and  he  was  paying  the  bills.  When  he  left,  she  remained  in  the
apartment and looked for a job. She said she paid the delinquent rent in order to move
into a new apartment. No documents were provided. (Tr. 43; Answer to SOR; GE 8)
SOR  ¶¶  4.c  and  4.d  are  also  court-issued  judgments  of  eviction  issued  against
Applicant for failure to pay rent in February 2017  ($1,100) and January 2014 ($1,100).
She denied in her SOR answer the February 2017 eviction judgment. Applicant testified
that she resolved both of these because she would have been unable to rent a new place
or  purchase  a  home  if  they  were  still  due.  She  did  not  provide  any  documents.  The
evidence supports the eviction judgments. (Tr. 41-45; GE 9, 10)
SOR ¶ 3.c alleged that in 2018 while living in an apartment, Applicant allowed an
unauthorized person, the father of her children, to live in her residence at different times,
which was against the rules of her lease. She was accused of having loud and boisterous
discussions  outside  of  her  apartment  unit.  Her  landlord  posted  a  written  notice  on  her
apartment that said her lease was not being renewed, and she was to vacate the premises
by August 10, 2018. She did not vacate on that date and her landlord filed an eviction
notice against her on August 15, 2018. (Tr. 53-54; GE 11)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR regarding the allegation, she said that she and
her partner argued but it was never outside of the apartment. She said she went to the
rental office to renew her lease, and she was told she was not permitted to renew it. She
said she did not know why. She was aware her lease expired, and she was required to
leave  before  then.  She  said  she  was  in  the  process  of  purchasing  a  house  and  was
staying in the apartment until the lease expired. She said she was unable to pay her rent
before she moved out, but she was taking care of the debt. (Answer to SOR)
Applicant  testified  that  the  father  of  her  children  was  not  listed  on  the  lease  as
required. She said because she was in the process of purchasing a home, she was saving
her money to put a down payment on the house and was not paying her rent. She decided
to not pay the rent and instead use the money to fix her credit and make a down payment.
She figured the landlord could use her security deposit instead. She purchased the home
in July 2019. She was issued an eviction notice in July 2019. She resolved the delinquent
payments to the landlord in July 2022. At that time, she was in the process of selling her
first home and purchasing a new one. She took out a loan of $12,000 to pay some debts
to improve her credit so she would qualify to purchase a new home. She then sold her
first house and used the profits to repay the loan. She then repaid the eviction debt that
she  incurred  in  2019.  She  provided  a  document  to  show  that  she  resolved  the  2019
eviction  debt  (SOR  ¶  4.b).  The  document  she  provided  is  from  a  debt  collector.  She
testified she did not pay the debt when it was owed because she did not have the money.
She testified that she took the loan to clear her negative credit history and resolve the
financial  issues  that  were  raised  by  the  government  with  regards  to  her  public  trust
position. She contacted a company to help her resolve her debts after she received the
SOR. She did not receive any credit counseling. (Tr. 39-42, 45-47, 51-54, 98-108; GE 12;
AE D)
The debt in SOR ¶ 4.a is for a repossessed vehicle Applicant purchased for her
partner  in  2016.  It  was  repossessed  the  same  year.  Her  partner  was  to  make  the
payments.  He  did  not.  She  testified  that  she  settled  the  debt  in  September  2022  for
$1,604. She provided a document with proof of the amount paid and the debt is settled.
She  testified  that  when  she  received  notice  that  her  debts  were  a  concern  regarding
obtaining a public trust clearance she acted to resolve the debt.  (Tr. 41, 47-51; GE 14;
AE A, E)
In  January  2018,  Applicant  completed  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions (SF 86). In response to Section 22-Police Record, which asked if in the past
seven years she had been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a
criminal proceeding; or had been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, marshal, or any
other type of law enforcement official; or had she been charged, convicted or sentenced
to any crime in any federal, state, local, military, or non-U.S. court. Applicant responded
“No.” (GE 1)
Under  Section  26-Delinquency  Involving  Routine  Accounts-it  asked  in  the  last
seven years if Applicant was evicted for non-payment. She responded “No.” This section
was not alleged in the SOR and will not be considered for disqualifying purposes but may
be  considered  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  in  making  a  credibility
determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
Section 28 – Non-criminal court actions asked Applicant if in the last seven years
she had been a party to any public record civil court action not listed elsewhere in the
form. She responded “No.” (GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  on  February  26,  2019.
Applicant  completed  government
interrogatories  on  December  3,  2020.  The
interrogatories included a copy of her subject interview with the government investigator
from  February  2019.  Questions  in  the  interrogatories  asked  if  the  subject  interview
accurately  reflected  the  information  she  provided  during  the  interview.  She  indicated
“Yes.” It asked her to identify each and every portion of the report that is not accurate and
make corrections as necessary, so the report accurately reflected her interview. She did
not make any corrections. The interrogatories also provided space to provide additional
information  regarding  matters  discussed  during  her  interviews.  She  did  not  provide
additional information. It also stated that subject to any corrections, additions, or deletions
she may have made to the report, did the investigator’s summary accurately reflect her
interview.  Applicant  responded  “Yes.”  The  interrogatories  finally  asked  subject  if  she
agreed  with  and  adopt  the  report  as  an  accurate  summary  of  her  interviews.  She
responded  “Yes.” She then  signed  the  statement  indicating that the foregoing was true
and correct and that she had read the enclosed report of her interviews and either found
the report to be accurate or she amended it so it is now accurate. (GE 2)
After being  questioned  by Department  Counsel  at  her hearing,  Applicant  testified
that she  did  not agree with  the government investigator’s summary of her interview. She
said she  did  not know how important it was to  answer the  questions correctly for her job
at the  time  she  completed  the  SF  86.  Had  she  known  how  important her job  would  be  she
would have  been  more careful. (Tr. 89-91)
During Applicant’s background interview with a government investigator, she was
asked to confirm her answer in the Police Records section of the SF 86 where she did
not  disclose  any  of  her  arrests  by  the  police.  She  confirmed  her  “no”  response  to  the
investigator.  She was then confronted with her arrest from August 2016 (as noted above).
She  told  the  investigator  that  she  omitted  this  arrest  because  she  did  not  want  her
application denied, and she did not want to be denied employment due to it. Applicant
was also confronted with the August 2015 arrest (as noted above). She gave the same
response  for  why  it  was  omitted  because  she  did  not  want  her  application  denied  or
employment denied because of it. (GE 2)
At her hearing, Applicant testified that she failed to disclose her prior arrests by the
police  in  2015  and  2016  because  she  misunderstood  the  questions,  and  she  was
confused. She said her command of the English language is not good. She said she was
not convicted and did not go to jail. During her interview with the government investigator,
she explained that after she was arrested, she spent two days in jail each time. She said
someone  sat  beside  her  when  she  completed  the  application  and  was  there  to  help
explain what the questions meant if she needed help, but Applicant did not seek help for
the questions involving whether she had been arrested. Applicant testified that she had
concerns  because  she  was  not  sure  what  to  answer.  She  said  she  told  the  Facility
Security  Officer  (FSO)  after  she  had  completed  the  application  that  she  did  not
understand some questions and may have answered incorrectly about whether she had
been arrested or convicted of an offense. Applicant said the FSO told her that it was okay
and “it happens.” (Tr. 94) She said she was not told to correct it. She said she is open
about having been arrested. She also testified that she was concerned about getting the
job. She said there was no one to help her and she was told she had to complete the
application and interrogatories by herself. (Tr. 37-39, 81-84, 93-97)
Applicant was asked why she told the government investigator that the reason she
omitted her prior arrests was because she was concerned that her application would be
denied,  and  she  would  not  get  the  job.  She  denied  she  made  this  statement  to  the
investigator. She testified that if she did not answer the questions correctly it was because
she did not understand the questions and did not understand how important it was for the
job. She testified that she needed the job and was just filling out the application as was
required. When asked why she failed to disclose under Section 28 her civil court actions
for her evictions. She  repeated  that she  did not recall  answering  “No” and  she did not
understand the question. (Tr. 85-89)
I did not find Applicant’s testimony and explanations credible for why she failed to
disclose the required information. I find she deliberately failed to disclose on her SF 86
her prior arrests and civil court actions.
Applicant testified that she has worked for five years without incident for her current
employer. She has received awards for her performance.  Applicant provided copies of
the  awards  she  has  received  from  her  employer  during  her  tenure.  She  said  she  is
financially stable. She is a single mother taking care of four children. She has worked to
make a better life for her children. She said she did not know how important her job would
be for her and if she had, she would have paid more attention to the application process.

"Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  in  her  answer  to  the  SOR.  Her
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 40  years old.  She  has worked  for her current  government-contractor-
employer  since  2020. She  has a  full  employment history dating  back to  2007. She  holds
a bachelor’s degree.  She has never married  and  has no children.  (Item  2)
Under Guideline  F, the  SOR alleged  Applicant failed  to  file her 2015-2019  federal
income   tax  returns,  and   accrued   18   delinquent   debts   totaling   approximately   $76,000.
The  debts  are comprised  of collections  and  charged-off  accounts (student loans,  credit
card,   and   consumer  debt).   Some   of  the   delinquency   dates  relate   back  to   2009.  The
unfiled   tax  returns  are  established   by  her  security  clearance   application   (SCA)
admissions  and  her SOR  admissions.  The   debts   are established  by   her   admissions  in
her answer, security clearance  application  (SCA),  and  during  her  background  interview,
and  credit reports  from  October  2020  and  August  2022.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.s)  (Items 2-3, 5-
6)
Under  Guideline  J,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  was  arrested  in  February
2016 for driving with a suspended license. It also alleged that she was arrested in July
2010  and  charged  with  one  count  of  theft  and  one  count  of  failure  to  appear.  It  also
alleged that she was arrested in June 2003 and charged with one count of theft and was
placed  on  probation  for  24  months.  Her  admissions  in  her  SOR  response,  with  no
further explanations, support the allegations. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.c) (Item 1-Answer to SOR)
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material
facts in her September 2020 SCA when she failed to disclose her February 2016 arrest,
as  described  in  SOR  ¶  2.a,  in  Section  22  of  the  SCA.  It  also  alleged  that  Applicant
falsified material facts in her September 2020 SCA when she failed to list her July 2010
arrest, as described in SOR ¶ 2.b, in Section 22 of the SCA. However, that arrest was
over seven years old, and did not need to be listed on her SCA. As to this part of the
allegation, I find in favor of Applicant. (SOR ¶ 3.a)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  admitted  in  her  SCA  that  she  failed  to  file  her  2015-2019  federal
income tax returns. In her October 2020 background interview with an investigator, she
affirmed  not  filing  her  federal  income  tax  returns  for  those  years.  Her  reason  for  not
filing was that she started having financial problems because of her spotty employment.
In  order  to  continue  paying  her  immediate  bills,  such  as  rent,  she  stopped  filing  her
federal income tax returns. She also stated that now that she had her current job, she
would contact an accountant by the end of the year (2020) and file her returns.  In her
SOR  answer,  after  admitting  not  filing  those  tax  returns,  she  stated  that  she  was
“working  on having 2015, 2016, 2017,  2018, and 2019  filed by September 2022.”  She
failed to produce any evidence that those filings were made. (Items 1-3)
Appellant listed some of the delinquent debts in her 2020 SCA, but not all. During
her  background  interview,  she  admitted  all  her  SOR  debts  when  the  investigator
confronted  her  with  them,  including  her  14  delinquent  student  loans.  Regarding  her
consumer  and  credit-card  debts,  she  asserted  that  now  that  she  had  a  good  job,  she
would  look  at  her  credit  reports,  contact  the  creditors,  and  pay  the  bills.  There  is  no
evidence  that  she  took  any  of  those  actions.  She  claimed  she  was  unaware  that  her
student loans were delinquent. She  asserted she would contact her financial aid office
and  take  care  of  these  loans.  There  is  no  evidence  that  she  took  that  action.  She
claimed that her financial situation is a  work in progress, but she was in a better state
than she had been in a long time. She did not produce any evidence of debt payment,
payment plans reached, contact with any of the creditors, or any other actions she took
to resolve these debts. (Items 1-3, 5-6)
Criminal Conduct
In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  to  the  alleged  three  criminal  arrests  in
2016, 2010, and 2003. She did not provide any explanation for the arrests in her SCA,
her  background  interview,  or  her  SOR  answer.  The  source  of  the  arrest  information
comes from an FBI identification record, which lists the arrests. There is no evidence of
any criminal arrests after 2016. (Items 1, 4)
Personal Conduct
In  her  SOR answer, Applicant admitted  deliberately  omitting her  2016  arrest on
her  2020  SCA  as  she  was  required  to  list  in  response  to  Section  22.  She  failed  to
provide any explanation  for this omission during her background interview or her SOR
answer. (Items 1-2)

"Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since October 2020. He served on active duty in the U.S. military
from 2007 to 2011. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since he
was  in  the  military.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2019  and  a  master’s  degree  in
2022. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17, 49; GE 1, 9;
AE B, E, F)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  substance  abuse,  alcohol-related  incidents,  and
criminal conduct. On several occasions between about July 2010 and January 2011, he
used  synthetic  marijuana,  commonly  known  as  “spice.”  It  appears  that  the  substance
was not on the schedule of controlled substances at the time, but the military prohibited
the  use  of  any  substance,  other  than  alcohol  or  tobacco,  for  the  purpose  of  altering
mood  or  function.  He  received  nonjudicial  punishment  under  Article  15  of  the  Uniform
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in March 2011 for violating Article 92 of the UCMJ, in
that  he  was  “derelict  in  the  performance  of  [his]  duties  in  that  [he]  willfully  failed  to
refrain from using the substance commonly known as ‘spice.’” He was reduced one pay
grade, ordered to perform extra duty for 30 days, and forfeited $300. The forfeiture was
suspended.  In  May  2011,  he  was  discharged  for  misconduct  (drug  abuse)  with  a
general  under  honorable  conditions  discharge.  (Tr.  at  24-29,  49-50;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 8, 9; AE F)
Applicant  testified  that  he  consulted  with  an  attorney  before  his  Article  15
punishment and discharge. He  stated that he  “was under the impression that had  [he]
elected to talk to an attorney that it would have went down to a court. And [he] would not
have been able  to  get the general discharge.”  When he was  informed that  he initialed
the record of nonjudicial punishment proceedings indicating that he had consulted with
a lawyer, he stated that he did not recall seeing a judge advocate. (Tr. at 28-29; GE 8)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  State  A  in  December  2013  and  charged  with  driving
under  the  influence  (DUI).  The  police  report  indicates  that  Applicant  was  drinking  in  a
bar/restaurant,  when  he  was  refused  further  alcohol  service  because  he  was
intoxicated. The business called a taxi, but he did not accept the taxi. The manager told
Applicant  that  if  he  attempted  to  drive,  the  manager  would  call  the  police.  Applicant
drove away anyway and was stopped not long after when the police noticed his erratic
driving.  The  officer  noted  a  strong  odor  of  alcohol  and  other  indicators  that  Applicant
was  intoxicated.  He  stumbled  as  he  got  out  of  his  car,  and  his  zipper  was  down.  He
refused to participate in a field sobriety test, and he refused to provide a breath or blood
sample. (Tr. at 30-32, 51; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 7)
Applicant  pleaded   guilty   or  no   contest.   He  may   have   received   deferred
sentencing   in   which   he   paid  a   fine   and   court  costs,  and   he   was  on   unsupervised
probation  for a  year. He testified  that he  did  not have  a  good  memory of what led  to  his
arrest, and  he  did not  recall  if he  was intoxicated  when  he  left  the  bar. (Tr. at 30-33,  51-
53; Applicant’s  response to  SOR; GE  7, 9)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  March  2014  in  State  B  and  charged  with  public
drunkenness. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine of about $500. He does not remember
many details of what occurred other than it was outside his home. (Tr. at 33-36, 55-58;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6, 9)
Applicant  was  drinking  at  a  bar/restaurant  in  State  C  in  March  2016.  The  staff
offered him options for a safe ride home, but he refused. The staff called the police and
reported that Applicant left the establishment, was possibly intoxicated, and intended to
drive home. The police arrived, and the staff pointed out Applicant, who was not far from
his car. The police officer noted clear signs that Applicant was intoxicated, and he was
shoeless with mud around his legs up to his knees. There is a lake near the restaurant,
and  the  officer  deduced  that  Applicant  walked  into  the  lake  despite  the  temperature
being  about  44  degrees.  Applicant  told  the  officer  he  was  walking  home,  but  he  was
walking  in  the  wrong  direction.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  have  his  car  keys,  but  they
were found in his pocket. (Tr. at 37-40, 59-61; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5, 9)
Applicant  was  arrested  for  the  above  incident  and  charged  with  public
intoxication. He pleaded no contest or guilty to the charge and paid a fine of about $500.
(Tr. at 37-39, 59-61; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5, 9)
Applicant provided inconsistent testimony about the incident. He initially testified:
I  went to  another bar late  at  night  alone,  by  myself.  And  I drank  too  much,
to  excess. And  I didn’t want to  drive  home  because  I knew I had  too  much
to drink so I  attempted  to walk home.
This is when  the  officer, officer  stopped  me  when  I was  walking  home.  He
performed  a  field sobriety  test and  determined  I was intoxicated  in public.
(Tr. at 37)
Two questions later, he answered that he could not recall if he was intoxicated when he
left the restaurant. He also stated that he could not recall if he walked in the lake. (Tr. at
37, 60)
Applicant was drinking at a bar (not same bar as above 2016 incident) in State C
in January 2017. The waitress cut him off and tried to take his keys. At least one person
called  the  police  at  about  0210  and  reported  that  a  car  hit  a  curb,  and  the  driver
(Applicant)  was  standing  in  the  middle  of  the  street  and  appeared  to  be  intoxicated.
Applicant  was  extremely  intoxicated.  His  blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  was
measured at .279%. (Tr. at 40-41, 61-64; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 9)
Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI)  with  a
blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  of  .15%  or  greater.  In  February  2017,  he  pleaded
guilty to the lesser charge of DWI. He was sentenced to fines and court fees of $1,600,
confinement in the county jail for 180 days (suspended for 180 days), and probation for
one  year.  Applicant  stated  that  he  thought  it  was  a  deferred  adjudication,  but  there  is
nothing  in  the  court  records  to  corroborate  that  assertion.  (Tr.  at  40-41,  61-63;

In January 2020, police responded to a report that two individuals were fighting in
the  parking  lot  of  a  bar  in  State  C  at about 2346.  Applicant  was  found  on  the  ground.
The  other  individual  (described  by  Applicant  as  an  acquaintance)  forcibly  stopped
Applicant from driving home. Applicant admitted to the police officer that he had “a lot”
to drink, he was intoxicated, and he planned to drive home until he was stopped by the
other individual. Applicant admitted in his response to the SOR that he was drinking that
night,  but  he  “was  not  binge  drinking  or  drinking  to  excess.”  (Tr.  at  42-44,  65-67;

Applicant admitted that he had drinking issues, but he does not believe he is an
alcoholic, and he does not believe that he currently has a drinking problem.  He stated
that, except  for  his  use  of  spice  in the military,  he  has  never used illegal drugs.  In  his
response to the SOR, he indicated that “it was in his best interest to refrain from alcohol
consumption  entirely.”  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  in  August  2022  stating  that  he
discontinued drinking, and that he intended  “to abstain from alcohol use in the future.”
He has maintained his “sobriety,” which he described as not drinking to intoxication, for
more than a year. The last time he had anything to drink was in May 2023 when he had
three  beers  with  his  father  at  a  baseball game.  He  is  fitness  oriented  and  goes  to  the
gym  about  five  times  a  week.  He  is  attending  graduate  school  in  pursuit  of  another
master’s degree. (Tr. at 18-21, 27, 46-51, 69-73; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A, I,

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c,
2.a-2.f, 3.a, 3.c, and 4.d. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 3.b, 4.b, 4.c, 4.e, and 4.f.
On September 21, 2022, Department Counsel amended SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.c, 3.a, and 4.a.
The  amendment  purported  to  amend  SOR  ¶  5.f,  but  there  was  no  paragraph  5  in  the
original SOR. Applicant admitted all the amended allegations. At the hearing, Department
Counsel  corrected  the  erroneous  references  to  SOR  ¶¶  5.f  and  5.g  and  submitted  a
corrected amendment with the amended language in italics. The corrected version of the
SOR as amended before and during the hearing, with the changes in italics, is attached
to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. Applicant indicated on the record that he understood
the amendments and corrections of the SOR. (Tr. 8) His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant is  31  years  old. He  has been  offered  a  position  with  a  defense  contractor,
contingent  on   obtaining   a   security  clearance.   He   married   in   December   2014,  and   they
had  two  children, now ages 6  and  7. He divorced  his first wife  on  a  date  not reflected  in
the  record. He  married  his current wife  in November 2020, with  whom  he  has a  10-month-
old daughter.
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  June  2014  to  November
2016 and received an other than honorable discharge. He received a security clearance
while on active duty.
In April 2015, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform
Code  of  Military  Justice,  10  U.S.C.  §  815,  for  assaulting  another  sailor.  The  incident
involved a fist fight that occurred when Applicant asked a fellow sailor to help out on a
project and the fellow sailor did not respond. (GX 6 at 12) His punishment was restriction
for 30 days, extra duties for 30 days, reduction in rate, and forfeiture of one half of his
basic pay per month for two months. (GX 8 at 8)
In August 2016, Applicant and his wife had an altercation over his text messages
with another woman. At the hearing, he testified that his wife choked him, and he slapped
her to stop her from choking him. (Tr. 35-36) Applicant received nonjudicial punishment
for this incident, which consisted of reduction in rate, and forfeiture of one half of his pay
per month for two months, suspended for six months. (GX 8 at 2)
In November 2016, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery
on a family member. This incident occurred when Applicant  was playing a video game
when his wife was talking to him. When he ignored her, she broke the game controller,
and he responded by smashing the television screen. (GX 6 at 9) His wife claimed that
he struck her in the face and head, knocking her to the floor. At the hearing, he denied
hitting her, but admitted that he pushed her. He was charged by civilian authorities with
misdemeanor  assault  and  battery  on  a  family  member.  The  civilian  prosecution  was
deferred in February 2019 to enable Applicant to complete court-ordered counseling.  (GX
7 at 6; Tr. 40-41)
During  the  November  2016  altercation,  Applicant’s  wife  was  holding  their  baby
daughter. A protective order was issued against Applicant, and in January 2017, he was
listed as a child abuser in the state child abuse and neglect registry. (GX 11; GX 12) He
will remain on the registry until November 2023. (Tr. 41)
Applicant testified that he did not tell his commanding officer or the police that his
wife was the aggressor in the domestic incidents. His wife was on active duty in the Navy
and he kept silent in an effort to enable her to retain her military benefits. (Tr. 43)
On the day after the November 2016 altercation, Applicant attempted to commit
suicide by overdosing a prescribed muscle relaxant. He called his wife and told her that
he  had  ingested  the  drugs.  His  wife  called  an  ambulance,  and  he  was  taken  to  an
emergency room and then admitted to a military hospital. He received medical treatment
and  was  diagnosed  with  an  adjustment  disorder  with  depressed  mood.  He  was
hospitalized for two or three days and discharged. The medical authorities recommended
that he attend outpatient psychotherapy. He testified that he did not obtain psychotherapy
as  recommended,  but  he  began  obtaining  therapy  about  six  months  later  and  was
diagnosed with anxiety. He stopped the therapy when his therapist retired around 2019.
He resumed therapy for about six months in 2020 but stopped when his insurance would
no longer cover it. (Tr. 43-47; GX 5; GX 6 at 9)
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2012 to 2013. He resumed
his marijuana use in 2017, after he was discharged from the Navy, using it once or twice
a month. (GX 6 at 20). He testified that he has not smoked marijuana since 2020, because
most of his friends with whom he smoked marijuana are married and have children, and
several are DOD employees. (Tr. 66)
In  April  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  under  the  influence  of  drugs,
possession of marijuana, tampering with evidence, driving with defective equipment, and
operation of a vehicle with an expired license tag. The evidence tampering charge was
based  on  a  police  officer  accusing  him  of  attempting  to  eat  marijuana  that  was  in  the
vehicle when he and an acquaintance were stopped by police. (GX 6 at 14)
The  police  report for the  April 2017  incident recites that the  police  were  operating
a   driver’s  license   checkpoint,   and   they  observed   Applicant’s  vehicle  turn  around   in  a
parking   lot   in  an   apparent  attempt  to   avoid  the   checkpoint.   At  the   hearing,  Applicant
admitted avoiding the checkpoint because he knew that his license tags were expired.
(Tr. 52)
When the police officer stopped Applicant’s vehicle, he noticed a strong smell of
marijuana, and observed that Applicant’s eyes were glassy and he seemed “out of it.” He
observed small pieces  of  what appeared  to  be  marijuana  in  Appellant’s lap  and  on  his
shirt. When Applicant exited the car, the piece of marijuana that was on his lap fell onto
the ground. The police officer asked Applicant to open his mouth and he saw small pieces
of  marijuana  on  his  tongue,  and  his  tongue  was  covered  with  a  green  film.  Applicant
declined to be tested for drugs. (GX 13)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  believed  he  was  innocent  of  the  drug
charges,  but  he  was  told  that  his  trial  would  not  be  until  eight  months  later  unless  he
pleaded guilty. (Tr. 57-58) In June 2017, he pleaded guilty, was convicted of driving under
the influence of drugs, and was sentenced to eight days in jail and community service.
He was placed on probation for 60 months. For the marijuana possession, he was fined
$1,200 and placed on probation for 12 months. For tampering with evidence, he was fined
$750 and placed on probation for 12 months. (GX 7 at 9; GX 9)
In  January 2019, Applicant failed  to  report to  his probation  officer as  required. (GX
10) At  the  hearing, he  testified  that  he  failed  to  report because  he  was unsuccessful in
trying  to  contact the  new probation  officer who  was assigned  to  his case. (Tr. 60-61) The
probation  officer’s affidavit, dated  January 24,  2019, recited  that the  probation  officer had
called Applicant at least twice at a telephone  number that is the same  telephone number
as Applicant  provided  in  his answer to  the  SOR. As of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant
had  not contacted  his probation  officer. As  a  result, the  running  of his time  on  probation
has been tolled  since January 24, 2019, and  he  is still on  probation. (Tr. 63)
At  the  request  of  the  DOD  CAF,  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  psychologist  in
October 2021. The psychologist concluded that Applicant “does not appear to have any
mental  health  conditions  that  would  negatively  impact  his  ability  or  willingness  to
safeguard  classified  information.”  However,  the  psychologist  also  noted  that  Applicant
“has personality  characteristics and  behavioral tendencies that  could negatively impact
his judgment and trustworthiness.” (GX 3 at 8)
When Applicant submitted his SCAs in December 2013 and September 2018, he
did not disclose that he used marijuana with varying frequency between 2012 and 2013.
(GX 1 at  30-31; GX 2 at 19) In his answer to the SOR amendment and at the hearing,
He admitted intentionally not disclosing it in both SCAs. He testified that a military recruiter
advised him not to disclose it. (Tr. 14, 67)
Applicant admitted that he did not disclose his arrest for assault and battery in his
September 2018 SCA, because he believed it was not reflected in his record. (Tr. 68) He
disclosed his arrest for DUI and stated that he was awaiting trial. He did not disclose that
he was also charged with possession of marijuana, was convicted and sentenced, and
that  he  was  on  probation.  When  he  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in
December  2018,  he  admitted  that  he  did  not  disclose  his  probation  because  he  was
concerned that it would affect his application for a security clearance. (GX 6 at 15) When
he  was  evaluated  by  a  psychologist  in  October  2021,  he  admitted  that  he  thought  he
might be able to get by with not disclosing his probation. (GX 3 at 5)
When  Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  May  2022,  he  disclosed
that he used marijuana a few times in 2017. He did not disclose that he used marijuana
in 2020. (GX 6 at 20) During his psychological evaluation, he disclosed that he last used
marijuana in 2020, and he confirmed that disclosure at the hearing. (GX 3 at 5; Tr. 66) At
the hearing, he testified that he did not know why he did not fully disclose his marijuana
use in 2020 but he “probably didn’t think about it too hard.” (Tr. 72)
Applicant’s spouse submitted a statement describing him as an exceptional father
and husband with unwavering commitment to the wellbeing of his family. (AX A) A friend
of Applicant for more than eight years describes him as a gifted manager who is forthright,
fair, discreet, and “supremely knowledgeable.” (AX B) A former shipmate describes him
as  a  hardworking,  self-driven,  and  effective  leader.  (AX  C)  A  joint  statement  from  14
sailors  with  ratings  and  ranks  ranging  from  petty  officer  second  class  to  lieutenant
describes Applicant as an outstanding sailor and lists his multiple accomplishments while
in  the  Navy.  (AX  D;  AX  E)  A  retired  sailor  who  has  known  Applicant  for  nine  years
describes him as very respectful of privacy, classified information, rules, and restrictions.
(AX F). A petty officer second class with nine years of Navy service admires Applicant for
his exemplary work ethic, innate generosity, steadfastness, and dependability. (AX G)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.g,
2.a,  3.a,  3.b,  5.a,  and  5.b.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  4.a.  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a   38-year-old   systems   engineer  employed   by  defense   contractors
since  June  2012. He was unemployed  from  June  to  November 2014  when  he  left  a  job
by  mutual  agreement  after  he   was  accused   of  making   a   racial  comment  to   a   female
servicemember and  touching  her hair  without consent.  He served  on  active  duty  in the
U.S.  Navy  from   August  2004   to   May  2012   and   received   a   general  discharge   under
honorable conditions.
Applicant has never married. He  lived  with  a  cohabitant  from  November  2017  to
April 2020. Before they  separated, he  and  his cohabitant had  difficulties due  in part to
his sexually suggestive text message exchanges with five other women. (GX 12 at 2; Tr.
57) He has a  four-year-old son, and  he  shares custody of his son  with  his son’s mother,
his  former cohabitant. (Tr. 56)
Applicant received a security clearance in January 2006, while he was on active
duty in the Navy. His clearance was revalidated in 2013, while he was employed by a
defense contractor.
In  January  2002,  Applicant  was  charged  with  underage  possession  of  alcohol.
He  was  fined  and  his driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six  months.  (GX  1  at  43-44;
GX 13 at 2)
In  January  2003,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  reckless  driving  resulting  in  an
accident. (GX 11) The accident occurred when he drove too fast around a curve and hit
a  guardrail.  No  other  vehicles  were  involved.  He  had  not  been  consuming  alcohol
before driving. (Tr. 58)
In  August 2003, Applicant  was  convicted of  reckless  driving by  driving  92 miles
per  hour (mph)  in  a  55-mph  zone.  The  record  reflects  that  the  maximum  sentence  for
this offense was six months in jail, but it does not reflect the sentence that was imposed.
(GX 10)
In  December  2007,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  driving  under  the  influence  of
intoxicants  (DWI).  His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was  .24, well above the  legal limit.
He  was  fined  $350,  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six  months,  and  he  was
required to attend alcohol safety classes. (Tr. 59-60; GX 5 at 7-8)
In November 2009, Applicant was again convicted of DWI. He was sentenced to
jail  for  12  months  and  five  days,  all  of  which  was  suspended.  He  was  placed  on
unsupervised probation,  and his driver’s  license  was  suspended  for one  year. He  was
required to attend alcohol safety classes. (Tr. 60-61; GX 5 at 5)
In  October 2011, Applicant was charged  with  DWI,  2nd  offense  within five  years
and  refusal to  submit to  a breath  test.  He was convicted of DWI and  sentenced  to  jail for
12  months  and  five  days, with  11  months  and  15  days suspended.   His driver’s license
was suspended  for 36  months, and  he  was required  to  complete  alcohol safety classes.
(GX 5  at  5-6;  Tr. 62) Disposition  of  the  charge  of refusing  to  submit  to  a  breath  test  was
deferred and then dismissed in March 2013. (Tr. 66; GX 5  at 6)
While  Applicant  was  in  jail,  he  missed  the  sailing  of  his  ship,  and  he  received
nonjudicial  punishment  for  unauthorized  absence,  missing  movement,  and  violating  a
general  order  or  regulation.  (Tr.  64)  In  May  2012,  he  received  a  general  discharge
under honorable conditions, based on a pattern of misconduct. (GX 1 at 22)
While  Applicant  was  pending  discharge  from  the  Navy,  he  self-referred  to  the
Navy  Substance  Abuse  Rehabilitation  Program  (SARP)  and  completed  a  31-day
inpatient  rehabilitation  program.  His  alcohol  use  declined  after  he  completed  the
program. He stopped drinking between 2014 and 2016. (GX 3 at 4)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  job  for  making  a  racially
insensitive comment to a coworker, an enlisted woman in the Air Force. He considered
the coworker a good friend. While off-duty he offered his coworker a drink because he
had  two  drinks  in  front  of  him.  She  declined,  and  he  made  a  comment  that  she
interpreted  as  racial  profiling.  She  complained  to  their  supervisor,  and  he  was
terminated. Applicant disclosed this incident in his SCA as follows:
Formal  complaint  regarding  professionalism  was  submitted  by  Air  Force
member  against  me.  Terminated  by  company  without  being
fully
investigated. . . . Formal complaint stated I made racial comments towards
Air  Force  member  and  touched  her  hair  without  consent.  Air  Force
member  attempted  to  take  complaint  back  during  investigation  however
company found it easier to terminate than continue with investigation.
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  January  2021,  he
told the investigator that he offered his coworker a red fruit punch drink and, when she
declined,  he   told   her  that   everyone   loves  red   fruit  punch.   (GX  12   at  2).  He   told   the
investigator  that  he   was  called   into   his  manager’s  office  on   the   following   morning   and
told  that   he   was   terminated   effective   immediately.   He  told  the   investigator  that  his
employer  did   not  conduct  an   investigation   because   the   Air   Force   member  no   longer
worked   in  the   building.  However,  when   the   Air   Force  investigated   the   incident,   they
found   that  the   Air   Force   member’s  complaint  was  “incorrect.”  He   told  the   investigator
that  his   employer  later  determined   that  the   coworker’s  complaint   was  unfounded   and
offered   him   another  job   within  the   company,   but  he   no   longer  wanted   to   work  for  the
company.  (GX 12  at 2)  The  record  does not contain  any  documentation  of  the  complaint
against  Applicant,  the   investigation   of  that   complaint,  or   the   termination   of   Applicant’s
employment.
In August 2019, Applicant and his cohabitant hosted a joint birthday party for him
and  her  son,  which  was  attended  by  about  30  guests,  including  Applicant’s  neighbor
and his neighbor’s granddaughter. The party ended at about 2:00 am. Applicant testified
that  he  consumed  three  or  four  beers  during  the  day  but  did  not  believe  he  was
intoxicated. (Tr. 76)
Applicant  testified  that,  while  cleaning  up  after  the  party,  he  noticed  that  his
cohabitant’s son was not in his room, and he could not find him anywhere in the house.
He knew that some of the children who had attended the party were spending the night
in his neighbor’s house. He texted his neighbor, asking if his cohabitant’s son was at the
neighbor’s house. When the neighbor did not respond to the text, Applicant went to the
neighbor’s  house  and  knocked  on  the  door,  but  no  one  responded.  Applicant  then
entered the house through an unlocked back door and asked a friend of the cohabitant’s
son  if  he  was  in  the  house,  and  the  friend  stated  that  he  was  “in  the  back.”  Applicant
looked  in  one  bedroom,  but  the  cohabitant’s  son  was  not  there.  He  then  went  to  a
second bedroom and saw a person in bed who had blonde hair similar to the son’s hair.
He testified that he “just kind of peeked in,” “might have had one foot in the door to peek
around  the  door,”  and  softly  called  out  the  cohabitant’s  son’s  name.  The  neighbor’s
granddaughter, who was sleeping in the bed, was startled. He apologized and told the
granddaughter that he was looking for his cohabitant’s son, and she responded that the
son  was  “on  the  couch.”  (Tr.  42-43,  50)  He  found  his  cohabitant’s  son  under  some
blankets.  At  about  this  time,  the  neighbor  came  out  of  his  bedroom  and  confronted
Applicant. Applicant apologized, explained why he was there, and left.
The neighbor’s granddaughter called the police and told them that Applicant had
attempted  to  kiss her, caressed  her hips,  and  invited  her  to  “do  some  coke”  with  him.
The  granddaughter  also  told  the  police  that  Applicant  had  touched  her  breasts  during
the party on the previous day.
Applicant was charged with felony breaking and entering with intent to commit a
misdemeanor  and  sexual  battery.  He  was  represented  by  an  attorney  at  the  trial.
Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to trespassing and assault and battery,
both  misdemeanors.  He  was  sentenced  to  one  year  in  jail,  suspended  for  five  years,
conditioned on good behavior, completing a ten-week alcohol-abuse treatment program,
and having no contact with the victim or the victim’s family. He will be on probation until
November 2024. In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he admitted trespassing,
but he maintained that he was not guilty of the assault and battery and that he pleaded
guilty to avoid jail time.
Applicant’s neighbor testified  on  his behalf at the  hearing.  His neighbor testified
that  they  continued  to  have  casual  contact  with  each  other  after  the  August  2019
incident.  His  neighbor  also  testified  that  his  granddaughter  had  several  “traumatic
issues” in her life and that at the time of the incident, “she was seeking a lot of attention
and  known  to  tell  fibs.”  (Tr.  28)  He  stopped  short  of  testifying  that  his  granddaughter
was  lying,  but  said  that  he  was  skeptical  about  her  accusation  against  Applicant.  (Tr.
28-29, 33-34)
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  January  2021,  he
told  the  investigator  that  before  his  last  DUI,  he  drank  six  to  twelve  beers  about  four
times a  week,  but he stopped drinking for two  years beginning in 2014. At  the time of
the interview, he had resuming drinking. He told the investigator that he consumed two
or three beers about once a week, but that about once a year he drank about six beers
and became intoxicated. (GX 12 at 3)
In  November  2021,  Applicant  underwent  a  psychological  evaluation  at  the
request of the DOD CAF. The evaluation was conducted by video teleconference.  The
psychologist  noted  that  he  “presented  in  this  evaluation  with  a  moderately  antisocial
manner,” “appeared to minimize his responsibility in the problem situations described in
his  background  information,”  and  “blamed  others  in  instances  that  appeared  to  be
matters  of  his  own  lack  of  behavioral  control.”  The  psychologist  concluded  that
Applicant attempted to mislead him about the details of past events to cast himself in a
more positive light than may have been warranted by his actions.
Applicant  told  the  psychologist  that  he  suffered  an  estimated  20  instances  of
broken  bones  in  his  lifetime,  engaging  in  sky  diving,  riding  an  off-road  four-wheeler,
playing  basketball,  and  being  punched  in  the  face.  (GX  3  at  3)  At  the  hearing,  he
admitted that he has always been a high-energy, adventuresome person. (Tr. 51)
The  psychologist  found  that  if  Applicant  entered  his  neighbor’s  home  for  the
purpose  of  sexual  encounter  with  the  neighbor’s  granddaughter,  and  touched  her  and
confined  her  in  her  room  for  a  time,  particularly  if  he  was  intoxicated,  “then  this  act
would represent a nexus between his alcohol use problems, antisocial style, impulsivity,
and  stimulus  seeking  tendencies.”  He  diagnosed  Applicant  with  “alcohol-use  disorder,
severe,  in  sustained  remission  (by  subject  report).”  He  suggested  the  following  as
“diagnostic  possibilities,”  stopping  short  of  a
formal  diagnosis:  attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominately hyperactive/impulsive presentation;
and other specified personality disorder (with features of antisocial personality disorder).
The  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant’s  ADHD  symptoms  and  a  history  of
alcohol  use  did  not  present  a  significant  risk  to  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and
judgment,  but  that  “his  personality  condition  certainly  could  contribute  to  a  lack  of
trustworthiness
information.”  The  psychologist
concluded  that  Applicant’s  prognosis  “is  uncertain  given  that  he  did  not  seem  to  be
entirely forthright with [him].” (GX 3 at 9)
in  safeguarding  national  security
The  psychologist  listed  the  following  examples  of  inconsistencies  in  information
provided by Applicant that suggested a lack of candor:
•  Applicant told him that he could not remember when he last drank
more  than  three  beers,  but  he  told  an  investigator in  2021  that  he
drinks six or more beers and becomes intoxicated once a year.
•  Applicant used  the  term  “retired” to  describe  his departure from  the
Navy even though he  was discharged  for misconduct.
•  Applicant  said   that   he   “left”  a   job   in  2014   when   in  fact   he   was
terminated  because  of  a  racially related  comment, and  he  provided
an  exculpatory explanation  of the  event,  when  the  records reflected
that he “very likely” made racially offensive remarks.
•  Applicant pleaded guilty to a crime but told the psychologist that he
did not sexually assault the victim.
•  Applicant told him that he had consumed some alcohol but was not
intoxicated on the night of the alleged sexual assault in 2019.
The psychologist’s conclusion that Applicant was not “entirely forthright” appears
to  be  based  on  the  psychologist’s  conclusion  that  all  the  allegations  against  Applicant
probably  were  supported  by  the  evidence.  While  Applicant’s  guilty  pleas  at  his  trial
would justify a conclusion that he trespassed into his neighbor’s home and touched the
neighbor’s  granddaughter,  the  psychologist  apparently  believed  that  Applicant  groped
his neighbor’s granddaughter at the party, touched her inappropriately after he entered
his neighbor’s house, looking for his cohabitant’s son, and invited her to “do coke” with
him.  The  civil  authorities  did  not  charge  Applicant  with  groping  the  granddaughter  or
offering cocaine to her, and these acts were not alleged in the SOR.
The psychologist also appeared to believe that Applicant made an inappropriate
remark to a coworker that caused him to be fired.  The psychologist stated in his report
that  he  was  told  by  Applicant’s  mother  that  he  made  a  comment  such  as  “all  black
people like Kool-Aid.” (GX 3 at 3) There is no statement from Applicant’s mother in the
record.  There  is  no  record  of  the  investigation  of  the  complaint.  The  psychologist
determined  that  Applicant’s  description  of  what  he  said  to  a  coworker  was  untrue,
because  Applicant’s  mother  described  the  comment  differently.  It  is  not  clear  whether
the  psychologist  knew  that  the  complaint  was  investigated  and  determined  to  be
unfounded, or that he knew that Applicant’s employer offered to give him another job in
the company.
The  psychologist  also  concluded  that  Applicant  falsely  claimed  that  he  was  not
intoxicated on the night of the party, because Applicant admitted to his supervisor that
he  was  intoxicated.  The  psychologist’s  report  lists  a  document  from  Applicant’s
supervisor  as  one  of  the  documents  he  reviewed,  but  at  the  hearing,  Department
Counsel stated, “We weren’t able to  look at that report because  of our rules.” (Tr. 115)
The  security  investigator’s  report  does  not  include  a  statement  from  Applicant’s
employer.  There  is no documentary evidence  in  the  hearing  record  of  any  admissions
by  Applicant  to  his  supervisor  regarding  this  event,  and  no  evidence  from  other
witnesses that Applicant was intoxicated at the party.
Finally,  although  there  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  ever  was  involved  with
cocaine, the psychologist appears to have accepted the granddaughter’s assertions that
Applicant  touched  her inappropriately  and  offered  to  “do  some  coke”  with  her  as  true,
and  he  concluded  that  Applicant  was  not  being  truthful  with  him  when  he  denied  her
accusation.
Applicant  decided  to  stop  drinking  in  2022,  when  his  son  was  born.  His
cohabitant left him shortly after the birth, but they share custody of their son. (Tr. 56) He
testified that he last consumed alcohol on July 2, 2022. (Tr. 67) Applicant’s older brother
corroborated  his testimony about his decision  to  stop drinking and  the effect  it  had on
his behavior. (Tr. 98-100; 103-05)
Applicant is receiving counseling from a therapist once a week, and he receives
prescriptions from  a  nurse practitioner in the  counselor’s office.  (Tr. 72, 83) In a report
dated  August  8,  2022,  the  nurse  practitioner  stated  that  Applicant  had  abstained  from
alcohol  for  ten  weeks.  Applicant  receives  prescription  drugs  for  ADHD,  anxiety,
depressive  disorder,  and  panic  disorder.  (AX  J)  He  testified  that  he  stopped  taking
drugs  for  anxiety  and  panic  attacks  about  a  year  ago.  (Tr.  84)  Although  he  was
evaluated  for  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),  he  and  his  counselor  have
determined that he does not have PTSD. (Tr. 81, AX J
Applicant attends AA meetings once or twice a month, but he has not found the
“right group.” He testified that he has completed all of the 12-Step Program. (Tr. 74) He
sees a therapist regularly, and he realizes the negative effect of alcohol on his life. (Tr.
71-72)
Applicant  has  become  more  active  in  his  community  and  has  started  coaching
baseball. He testified, “I’m trying to be a person that I should have been a long time ago,
and it just took me way too long to get here.” (Tr. 72)
Applicant testified that he started having panic attacks in July 2022. He and his
cohabitant  had  started  seeing  each  other  again,  but  when  he  returned  from  a  30-day
deployment, he learned that she was seeing someone else and he was no longer part
of  her  life,  even  though  they  had  three  children  together. (Tr.  79)  He  admitted  that  he
still  suffers  from  panic  attacks  and  depression,  which  he  attributed  to  abstaining  from
alcohol.  He testified, “It's definitely a little harder when you have to face things  face to
face and not just hide them or drown them.” (Tr. 51)
A  friend  of  Applicant  who  has  known  him  for  ten  years  and  was  at  the  party  in
August  2019  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  good  character.  The  friend  also
stated that he did not observe any inappropriate interaction between Applicant and the
neighbor’s granddaughter. (AX G)
Applicant’s
father,  a  retired  Navy  petty  officer,
that  Applicant
meticulously  complied  with  the  revocation  of  his  driver’s  license.  Applicant’s  father,
mother, sister, and some friends drove him to and from work each day. (Tr. 91-92) His
father is proud of the progress he has made in turning his life around. (Tr. 89)
testified
A  Navy  commander  serving  as  the  combat  systems  officer  on  a  U.S.  Navy
combatant  ship,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  three  years  and  served  with  him  on
multiple  ships,  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  skill  as  a  fleet  systems  engineer
and his personal trustworthiness and integrity. She has observed Applicant’s change in
behavior during the past year. She states, “[Applicant’s] mindset has shifted away from
destructive  thought  and  behaviors  and  has  been  laser  focused  on  good  decisions,
personal growth, and impacting others by sharing wisdom he has gained on his journey
and providing motivation through all circumstances.” (AX I at 1)
A  retired  master  chief  petty  officer  who  has  known  and  served  with  Applicant
since  2020  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  technical  expertise,  dedication,
honesty, and integrity. (AX I at 2) An active-duty lieutenant commander who has known
Applicant since August 2022 describes him as a loving and doting father, who is full of
life,  energy,  and  positivity.  (AX  I  at  4)  An  active-duty  chief  petty  officer  has  watched
Applicant make  significant changes in his lifestyle and become a great father and  role
model  for  his  son  and  an  exceptionally  skilled  fleet  engineer.  (AX  I  at  3)  A  former
shipmate  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2006  believes  that  he  has  overcome  his
“personal  demons”  and  “found  love,  purpose,  and  a  peace  that  .  .  .  that  has  forever
changed  him.” He  states  that  Applicant  is  now “patient,  more  measured  when  speaks,
and  most importantly, he  thinks before [he] acts.” (AX  I at 5) A  neighbor for  two years
who has known Applicant for seven years describes him as “very dependable, selfless,
giving, trustworthy, and a joy to be around.” (AX I at 6)
The parents of Applicant’s former cohabitant are both retired sailors. Her mother
is  a  retired  Navy  limited-duty  lieutenant  with  20  years  of  service,  and  her  father  is  a
retired  senior  chief  petty  officer  with  26  years  of  service.  They  consider  Applicant  a
devoted  father  to  his  own  biological  child  as  well  as  two  of  his  former  cohabitant’s
children, treating them as his own. They have remained in contact with Applicant after
he  and  cohabitant  separated,  and  they  have  the  “utmost  respect”  for  him  and  are
confident that he has turned his life around. (AX I at 7)

"Applicant is a 33-year-old married man with one child, age three. He works for a
defense contractor as a shipping and receiving clerk.
One night in July 2011, while driving home intoxicated, Applicant blacked out and
hit the center divider with his car. (Item 3 at 2) He suffered a concussion and required
hospitalization. While recuperating, the police came to the hospital and charged him with
driving  while  intoxicated  and  reckless  driving.  (Item  3  at  2)  Subsequently,  he  was
convicted and sentenced to three years of probation. (Item 3 at 12)
In July 2012, while standing in line at a department store, Applicant’s mother got
into  a  heated  exchange  with  another  patron  about  who  was  next  in  line  to  check  out.
Angry at the woman for speaking rudely to his mother, Applicant yelled at the customer
and walked toward her, gesticulating his hands wildly, and in the process, knocking down
some water bottles from a shelf which hit the lady. (Item 3 at 3) Later that day, the police
came to his home and issued a citation for assault and battery. (Item 3 at 2) Subsequently,
after  pleading  no  contest  to  the  citation,  he  was  convicted,  sentenced  to  two  years  of
probation, ordered to complete anger management classes, and to stay away from the
woman whom he assaulted. (Item 3)
In May 2022, Applicant was charged with the separate offenses of presenting a
false  or  fraudulent  insurance  claim  and  preparing  a  false  insurance  claim.  (Item  4)
Specifically,  Applicant  is  alleged  to  have  “knowingly  present[ed]  and  cause[d]  to  be
presented, aid, abet, solicit, and conspire with another person to knowingly present and
cause  to  be  presented,  a  false  and  fraudulent  claim  for  payment  of  a  loss  and  injury,
including payment of a loss and injury under a contract of insurance.” (Item 4 at 2) There
is currently an open warrant for his arrest. Applicant denied this allegation but provided
no explanation for the basis of the denial.

"Applicant  admitted  SOR  allegations  1.a-1.f;  2.a-2.b;  3.a-3.e,  3.g,  and  3.i.  He
denied  SOR  ¶¶  3.f  and  3.h.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He has worked for his current contractor-employer since
January 2020. He served in the U.S. Army from 1991 until 2001, when he was honorably
discharged. He has worked for various government contractors since his Army discharge.
He has taken some college courses. He is divorced and has one adult child. He has held
a security clearance or a public trust position in the past. (Tr. 5, 18-19, 22; GE1-2)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  gave  false
information  on  his  March  2022  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  when  he  failed  to
disclose that he was fired from a job within the past seven years because of a positive
urinalysis test (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) and his illegal drug use (SOR ¶ 1.c). It also alleged that
he was terminated from his job in April 2019 because he tested positive for marijuana
(SOR ¶ 1.d). It alleged that he admitted to a background investigator that he intentionally
omitted  information  from  his  SCA  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  It  also  alleged  he  used  marijuana  and
tested positive for its presence in 1995 or 1996, while possessing a security clearance
(SOR ¶ 1.f). Applicant admitted all the allegations during his background interview, in his
SOR answer, and during his testimony. (Tr. 19-22; GE 2; SOR answer)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged in April 2019 Applicant failed a urinalysis test
for marijuana (SOR ¶ 2.a); and that he was arrested in August 2003 for unlawful use and
possession of a controlled substance marijuana (SOR ¶ 2.b). Applicant admitted all the
allegations during his background interview, in his SOR answer, and during his testimony.
(Tr. 19-24; GE 2; SOR answer)
Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleged the drug allegations stated in SOR ¶ 2
above (SOR ¶ 3.a and 3.j). It also alleged a series of criminal arrests as follows: a March
1992 arrest in a foreign country for misuse of privileges (SOR ¶ 3.i); a July 1992 arrest
for theft of government property (SOR ¶ 3.h); an August 1993 arrest for adultery (SOR ¶
3.g); a  December 1993  arrest  for adultery (SOR  ¶  3.f); a  June  2000  arrest  for  assault
(SOR ¶ 3.e); a July 2000 arrest for driving while license under restraint (SOR ¶ 3.d); an
April 2001  arrest  for his failure  to  appear (SOR  ¶  3.c);  and  his August  2001  arrest  for
damaging  property,  criminal  mischief,  and  making  a  false  police  report  (SOR  ¶  3.b).
Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations,  except  for  SOR  ¶¶  3.f  and  3.h,  during  his
background interview, in his SOR answer, and during his testimony. (Tr. 19-24, 26-31,
34-37, 40-42, 45-46; GE 2; SOR answer)
In 2019, Applicant was working for his employer on a government project. He held
a  position of trust at  the time.  He knowingly ingested some edible marijuana lozenges
while employed by this company. He consumed two over two days. Three weeks later,
he was assigned to drive a company vehicle  and was involved in an accident. He was
required to take a urinalysis test because of the accident. It came back with a positive
result for the presence of marijuana. His employer immediately terminated him from his
position based upon  his use of marijuana. He  was aware of the  company’s drug  policy
and knew he was not allowed to use any illegal drugs during his employment with this
contractor. (Tr. 21-22, 45; GE 2)
In  March 2022,  Applicant  completed  an  SCA  for  his current  employer.  He  gave
false information on his SCA when he deliberately failed to disclose in Section 13A and
13C that he was fired for cause in 2019 because of his use of marijuana as established
by a positive urinalysis test. He also deliberately failed to disclose his 2019 marijuana use
in Section 23 of his 2022 SCA. During his background investigation and at his hearing,
Applicant admitted knowingly making these false statements because he was afraid that
revealing  the  truth  would  jeopardize  his chances  of  receiving  a  security  clearance.  He
admitted his arrest for using and possessing marijuana in 2003 on a military installation.
He  denied  the  marijuana  was  his,  or that  he used  it  on  that  occasion,  and  there  is no
record  evidence  contradicting  his  statement.  He  admitted  using  marijuana  and  testing
positive for it in approximately 1995 or 1996 when he was in the Army. (Tr. 19, 46; GE 2)
In August 2001, he was angry with his ex-wife who was storing some furniture at
his residence. In his anger, he destroyed several pieces of furniture. He later called the
police and reported that someone broke into his house and destroyed the furniture. He
was confronted by the officers about submitting false information and admitted that he did
so.  He  was  charged  with  destruction  of  property  and  filing  a  false  police  report.  He
admitted committing these offenses. (Tr. 30-31; GE 2, 4)
Applicant admitted his arrest for failing to appear for a court appearance in 2001.
He admitted his arrest for driving while his license was under restraint in July 2000. He
admitted his arrest for assault in June 2000. He admitted his arrest for adultery in August
1993. He admitted his arrest in March 1992 for misuse of privileges. There is no additional
evidence available about these offenses. (SOR answer)
Applicant  denied  an  arrest  for  adultery and sodomy  in  December 1993,  and  an
arrest for larceny of government property in July 1992. There is no evidence in the record
to contradict his denials. (Tr. 27, 35; GE 1-4; SOR answer)
Applicant testified that he has not used marijuana since 2019. He has not been
arrested since 2003. He provided a written statement promising to abstain from using any
illegal substances in the future. (Tr. 25, 29, 33; AE A)

"Applicant  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  2.a.  and  3.  a.  After  a  thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  26-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since April of 2020. Applicant is married, and has
no  children.  (TR  at  page  14  line 14  to page 17  line  13, and  GX  1 at  pages  7,  15  and

Personal Conduct
1.a., 2.a. and 3.a. In about October of 2017, more than five years ago  while on
active duty with the Marine Corps, Applicant attempted to record and take photos of a
female sailor, while she was changing her clothes in a changing room. This attempt was
done  without  her  knowledge  or  consent.  (TR  at  page  18  line  2  to  page  29  line  17,  at
page 35 lines 19~23, and at page 37 lines 14~22.) As a result, Applicant was convicted
at  a  Summary  Court-Martial  (SCM)  for  Attempt  to  record  and  take  pictures  of  a  Naval
member of the Armed Forces without consent.  As a result of this conviction, Applicant
was  reduced  in  rank  from  a  Lance  Corporal  (E-3)  to  a  Private  First  Class  (E-2),  and
discharged in about  December of 2019 with an Other Than Honorable Discharge. (TR
at  page  45  line  8  to  page  49  line  3,  and  GXs  5  and  6.)  Applicant’s  wife,  who  was  his
girlfriend in 2017, is aware of Applicant’s criminal conduct.

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 3.d, 3.e, 3.f, and
the cross-allegation at SOR ¶ 2.a, all with explanations. He denied SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 3.a, 3.b,
and 3.c, all with explanations. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated into the findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old. He married in 2013. He and his wife separated in 2019
and divorced in 2020. They have three children, a son, age 13, a daughter, age 8, and a
son, age 7. They share custody of their children and live in the same neighborhood. (GE
1; Tr. 59-62, 68)
Applicant  earned   an   associate   degree   in   2010.   He  served   on   active   duty   in   the
U.S.  Navy  as  a   corpsman   and   psychiatric  technician   from   2010   to   2015.  He  was
discharged  honorably  as an  E-3. From  October 2015  to  October 2017, he  worked  as a
mental  health   technician   at   a   civilian   hospital   in  state   1.  Since   October  2017,  he   has
been   employed   by  a   defense   contractor  as   a   mental  health   technician  in  an   inpatient
psychiatric  unit at a  naval hospital in state  2. He held a  clearance  in the Navy. (GE 1; Tr.
9-10, 35-36, 46-50, 58, 112-114)
In 2014, Applicant took the cellphone of another sailor without her permission. He
“flipped” through pictures on her phone. Applicant said he did it as a “joke.” (GE 1 at 20)
He  was  charged  with  wrongful  misappropriation  of  the  cellphone  under  the  Uniform
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). He pled guilty, received non-judicial punishment (NJP)
of 45 days of extra duty. (SOR ¶ 1.b) (The SOR allegation references forfeiture of $858
a  month  for  two  months  but  this  is  not  established).  Applicant  was  also  transferred  to
another job location so he would no longer have contact with the female sailor. (GE 1 at
20; GE 2 at 2-3; Tr.  51) In his hearing, Applicant  testified  it was a “juvenile prank that
was very stupid.” He said he gave the phone right back and did not steal it. (Tr. 33-34,
75-79)
In  2015,  Applicant  was  investigated  by  the Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service
(NCIS)  following  an  interaction  between  himself  and  a  female  former  patient.  About  a
year  after  the  female  sailor  was  a  patient  of  his,  he  saw  her  at  a  public  library  and
engaged  her  in  conversation.  She  later  alleged  that  he  had  been  “hitting  on”  her.  His
background  interview  references  a  charge  of  sexual  assault  under  UCMJ  Article  120
(GE 2 at 3) but there are no charging documents in the record. Applicant asserted that
he did not do anything inappropriate in interacting with his former patient. (Tr. 52) The
case  was  evidently  dismissed  shortly  before Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  Navy.
(GE 2 at 3; Tr. 51-55). This incident was not alleged in the SOR.
While working at the behavioral hospital in state 1 in 2016, Applicant was verbally
reprimanded after giving his personal phone number to a female patient. He said he did
this  unprompted  so  the  patient  would  have  a  way  to  reach  out  if  she  needed  help,
because  he  felt  that  she  “did  not  have  adequate  support.”  He  denied  any  romantic
interest. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 55-56) He had not done this before. He had been trained in how
to  interact  with  patients  and  said  what  he  did  was  “not  encouraged.”  (Tr.  56)  This
incident was not alleged in the SOR.
In early July 2020, police responded to a complaint filed by a neighbor (Ms. N) of
Applicant’s, after she found inappropriate messages and photos on the cell phone of C,
her  12-year-old  daughter.  C  had  been  communicating  with  Applicant  online,  via
Facebook  Messenger,  in  June  and  July  2020.  The  N  family  and  their  children  were
friends of Applicant’s children. In August 2020, following an investigation, Applicant was
arrested and charged with (taking) indecent liberties with a child, a felony. (GE 3) (SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 2.a)
Applicant  was  interviewed  about  his  arrest  in  a  security  clearance  background
interview on September 1, 2020. (GE 2 at 7-10) (An earlier background interview, in late
July 2020, predated Applicant’s arrest). (GE 2 at 2-6; Tr. 72-73, 100)
When  prompted  at the  start of his  September 2020  interview.  Applicant reported
that  he  had  been  accused  of taking  indecent  liberties with  a  child.  He said  his wife  had
had  a  “falling  out”  with  her friend  Ms. N  (the  neighbor)  and had accused  both  Applicant
and  his wife   of  indecent  liberties   with  her   children.   The families   and   their   children   had
been  friends  and  the  families’  daughters would socialize together. Applicant  tried  to  look
after N’s daughters because  they  did  not have  a father figure.  (GE 2  at 7; Tr.,  49-50, 63-
66)
Applicant said he talked to C, the 12-year-old daughter, on a daily basis through
Facebook during June and July 2020. They discussed general topics such as daily life.
He  acknowledged  using  “inappropriate  language”  with  C.  He  said  C  had  sent  him
“pictures of herself, to show him her outfit, and [Applicant] referred to [C] as ‘sexy.’” He
said he should have used words like “beautiful” instead, and was “just trying to look out
for her by boosting her self-esteem.” He acknowledged his words were “inappropriate.”
(GE 2 at 7-8; Tr. 66-67, 69-70)
Applicant then said C volunteered to send him another picture. C then sent him a
“naked photo” of herself. He said he deleted the photo and told C to never do anything
like  that  again.  He  did  not  believe  he  had  pressured  C.  Applicant  did  not  tell  his  wife
about  the  photo  “because  he  did  not  want  to  violate  [C’s]  trust  by  getting  her  into
trouble.  [Applicant]  continued  to  have  daily  contact  with  [C]  after  she  sent  him  the
photo.” He said there was nothing further sexual and no sexual gratification on his part.
(GE 2 at 8; Tr, 69-70)
C’s family member discovered the photo on C’s phone and contacted Applicant
through  C’s  Facebook  account.  He  told  Applicant  that  “he  did  not  like  [Applicant’s]
relationship with [C] and began to get aggressive and threatening towards [Applicant].”
Applicant then said he would cut  off all contact with C, and did so. He was arrested a
few  weeks  later.  (GE  2  at  8;  Tr.  70-71)  Applicant  said  that,  as  a  father,  he  would  be
“concerned” if his child were interacting with a 30-year-old man on a cell phone. (Tr. 70)
Applicant said in the interview that he believed Ms. M was coaching C to make
these accusations. He has only been with C in person in the presence of Ms. M or his
wife,  except  once,  when  he  and  C  were  seated  on  the  couch  together  for  about  20
minutes. He said he believed Ms. M might claim that Applicant tried to kiss C, which he
denied. He said other children were present and playing in the house at the time. (GE 2
at 8-9) He got no sexual gratification from any  interaction  with  C. Applicant  said in his
interview that the criminal case was pending, he had retained counsel, and said he was
innocent. (GE 2 at 9)
In  March  2021,  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  a  lesser  charge  of  contributing  to  the
delinquency of a juvenile.  He was  fined and sentenced to two  years of probation. The
fine has been paid. (GE 2 at 17, GE 3; Tr. 62, 73-74)
In  his  hearing  testimony,  Applicant  denied  instigating  “any  kind  of  sexually
inappropriate conduct” with C. He said it was she who sent sexual materials to him. He
acknowledged that he should not have been talking to her in the first place. (Tr. 39) He
did not recall how he came to have C’s cell phone number. “I assume she just gave it to
me.” He said they interacted on Facebook, not by cell-phone texting. He asserted that C
found  him  on  Facebook  and  added  him  as  a  contact.  (Tr.  41)  Applicant  said  C  would
send her pictures and ask her his opinion and said that one time she sent him a sexual
picture,  which  he  deleted  at  once  and  told  her  that  was  inappropriate.  (Tr.  41)  He
confirmed that he was charged after C’s parents discovered the messages and pressed
charges. (Tr. 41-42)
While on probation, Applicant was required  to  “have  no inappropriate contact with
[C]   or   any   other   minors.”     He  does  not   believe   there   was   a   “stay   away”   order   put  in
place,  but  he  was  “strongly advised”  by the  judge  not  to  contact  C again,  and  he has not
done   so.  (Tr.  42-43,   94)   His  probation   was   unsupervised,   and   he   was  not  required   to
register  as  a   sex  offender.  He  said  he   did  not  have   to   attend   counseling.  He  said  he
completed   the   two   years  of   probation   in   March  2023,   (Tr.  43-44)  I  requested   that
Applicant  provide  post-hearing  documentation that he had completed  probation  fully and
successfully.   (Tr.  44)   He  did   not  do   so.  He   said  he   has  not  engaged   in   that  conduct
again  and he never will. (Tr. 39)
In April 2021, Applicant was investigated by the local police following a complaint
filed by his ex-wife, A. She had reported that their daughter, D, had told her that D had
been  sitting  next  to  Applicant  on  the  couch,  where  D  observed  Applicant  “touching
himself” while watching a “video of naked girls” on his phone. (GE 4 at 3) (SOR ¶ 2.b)
Local police interviewed all three of their children.  Only one  “made  a  disclosure
about her father showing her pornographic material”  one time. In the police report, the
circumstances  were  explained  as  “child  walked  in  on  dad  late  at  night.”  (GE  3  at  5-6)
The  district  attorney  expressed  concern  but  declined  to  prosecute.  The  investigating
officer  spoke  at  length  with  a  representative  from  the  county  department  of  social
services (DSS) and “determined [that the] biological mother [A] was feeding information
to [the] children.” The police investigation was then closed without further action. (GE 3
at 6)
Applicant  denied  the  incident  in  its  entirety  and  said  it  “never  happened.”  He
in  D’s  presence  and  denied  watching
denied
pornography on his phone in her presence. (Tr. 37-38) He said in his Answer that it was
a false claim brought by his ex-wife with no basis in fact. (Answer to SOR ¶ 2.b; Tr. 98)
touching  himself
inappropriately
Applicant  provided  a  January  2022  letter  from  county  DSS  regarding  their
investigation  of  April  2021  allegations  of  “sexual  abuse  and  neglect,  improper  care
improper supervision, and injurious involvement.”  In June 2021, Applicant’s family was
found to be in need of parenting skills, child characteristics, and communications skills.
Applicant  and  his  former  wife  completed  a  “Crossroads  of  Parenting  and  Divorce”
program  and other classes, and the DSS case was closed. (AE C; Answer; Tr. 87-88,
104-105)  DSS’s  letter  concluded  with  recommendations  that  Applicant  “continue  to
ensure to not expose your children to any pornography, sexually explicit conversations,
or  any  sexual  acts.  The  Department  believes  your  children  are  in  a  safe  environment
residing with you.” (AE C) Applicant said he has complied with these recommendations.
(Tr. 88-89) He has not participated in other family or parent counseling. (Tr. 109)
Applicant  confirmed  at  his  DOHA  hearing  that  he  was  not  charged  or  arrested
because  of  this  incident,  and  the  authorities  took  no  action  to  alter  the  child  custody
arrangement in place with his ex-wife as a result. There was no negative impact on his
probation status and he was not told to report the matter to probation. (Tr. 44-46)
Applicant  acknowledged  another  previous  incident,  in  which  another  of  his
daughters  walked  in  on  him  late  one  night  when  he  was  watching  pornography  in  the
living  room.  Anything  she  saw  was  inadvertent  and  he  thought  he  was  alone.  He  was
not aware that he had been seen until his ex-wife told him that their daughter had seen
him.  He acknowledged  that  he  should not  have  been  watching pornography  where  he
could have been discovered, and now does so in private. (Tr. 81-85, 87, 99)
Applicant has not had any allegations of misconduct made against him regarding
his children since 2021. He still has a Facebook account but uses it rarely. He does not
interact  with  children  on  Facebook.  (Tr.  86)  He  has  not  engaged  in  inappropriate
behavior  since  2021,  either  with  children  or  his  patients.  He  has  not  had  personal
relationships with patients since the incident in 2016. (Tr. 94)
Under Guideline F, the SOR concerns six delinquent debts, totaling $9,809. The
debts are established by credit reports in the record, from June 2020, November 2021,
and May 2022. (GE 5, 6, 7) (SOR ¶ 3)
Applicant disclosed  on his  SCA  that  he  had  some  delinquent debts, and  that  he
was resolving  them  with  the  assistance  of a  debt  consolidation  company. (GE  1  at  37-
39)  Starting  in July  2019, he  had  paid them $250  a  month  for about two  years to  resolve
his debts,  all  but two  of which  were resolved  by the  time  of the  hearing. (Tr. 25-26,  29)
He  is no  longer contracted  to  the  debt  resolution  company since  the  remaining creditors
would  not   settle   with   them,   and   he   stopped   paying   the   company   a   few   months   before
the   hearing.  (Tr.  28,  105)   He  acknowledged   that  he   incurred   debts  because   he   spent
more   than   he   could   afford  to   pay,   but   he   took  out   loans   for  necessary   expenses  (rent
and  a car loan), rather than  frivolous  ones.  (Tr. 59-60)
SOR  ¶  3.a  ($3,201)  is a  charged-off  auto  loan  account.  (GE 5  at 5;  GE  6  at  4)
This account was settled and now shows a zero balance. (GE 7 at 4; AE B, AE D, AE E;
Tr.  26-27)  Applicant  said  the  account  became  delinquent  because  that  was  a
requirement of entering into debt resolution. (Tr. 31)
SOR  ¶   3.b   ($2,034)   is  an   account  placed   for  collection   by  a   landlord   or  rental
property  manager. (GE 6  at  4;  GE  7 at  3)  This account  remains  pending. (AE F  at  19-
21)   Applicant  said  he   was  not  aware   of   it  until  he   received   the   SOR.  He  is  in
negotiations to address this debt. (Tr. 24, 26-27)
SOR ¶ 3.c ($1,902) is a charged-off credit card account. (GE 5 at 5) This account
was settled and now shows a zero balance. (GE 7 at 4; AE B, AE D, AE E; Tr. 27)
SOR  ¶  3.d  ($1,108)  is  a  rental  account  placed  for  collection  by  a  management
company. (GE 5 at 5; GE 6 at 1; GE 7 at 1) This account remains pending. (AE D, AE
E, AE F at 49) Applicant said the creditor would not accept a settlement so he must pay
the full balance, which he intends to do. (Tr. 26, 27, 31)
SOR ¶ 3.e ($857) is an account that has been charged off by a bank. (GE 5 at 5)
Applicant said this debt has been paid. (Tr. 28) SOR ¶ 3.f ($707) is an account placed
for collection by a debt buyer. (GE 6 at 3) This account is being settled by Applicant’s
debt  consolidator.  (AE  B;  Tr.  28)  Applicant  said  that  these  accounts  are  actually  one
debt (one to the creditor and one to the collection agency). It was a loan related to auto
repair financing. He accrued this debt because he was struggling financially. (Tr. 31-33)
Applicant works full time and currently earns about $35,000 to $40,000 annually.
He said he earns about $3,000 a month, after taxes. He estimated that he has $600 to
$1,000 left over after monthly expenses. (Tr. 90-92, 109) He pays $700 a month in child
support  and  $600  a  month  in  rent.  (Tr.  104)  He  does  not  keep  a  monthly  budget  and
has  not  been  through  credit  counseling  since  he  was  in  the  Navy.  (Tr.  93)  He  has  no
other delinquent debts and he intends to resolve what he owes. He has no unfiled tax
returns and no unpaid tax debt. (Tr. 105-109)
Applicant  accepted  responsibility  for  his  actions.  He  said  he  accepted  his
punishment and paid his debt to the state. He has never had any issue with patients he
has treated in his current job and has never had any work issues. (Tr. 46) He completed
his  probation  and  has  not  had  any  further  issues  in  the  last  three  years.  He  does  not
believe he is a liability to the government. He has worked in his field for 14 years and
does not want to lose his career. (Tr. 50, 97-98, 110-112, 126-129; GE 2 at 11, 15)
Applicant provided  a  reference  letter from  his division  officer, a  Navy Lieutenant,
G.   G  has  known   Applicant  since   May  2021.  He  regards  Applicant  as  dependable   and
proficient,   and   says   he   exercises  good   professional  judgment.  He  is  a   reliable  and
essential member  of  the  team.  (AE  A) Applicant  testified,  however, that  G is  not aware
of any of the SOR allegations.  (Tr. 75, 103-104)

"In  Applicant’s answer,  he  admitted  all of the allegations  in  the SOR,  except for  ¶¶
2.b   and   2.d,  which   he   denied.   I   adopt  his   admissions   as  findings   of  fact.   After  a
thorough   and   careful   review  of  the   pleadings  and   exhibits  submitted,   I  make   the
following  additional findings of fact.  (Item  2)
Applicant  is  38  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal
contractor,  since  March  2020.  That  contractor  is  subject  to  the  drug-free  workplace
provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. He served in the U.S. Army from 2008 to 2012 and
was honorably discharged. He is married for the second time and has one child from his
second  marriage.  Applicant  is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has  taken  some  college
courses. (Item 3)
The SOR alleged, under Guideline J, that Applicant was charged with marijuana
possession  in  March  2004;  that  he  was  charged  with  marijuana  possession  in
November  2012;  and  that  he  was  charged  with  marijuana  and  Xanax  possession  in
October  2013.  (¶¶  1.a-1.c)  In  April  2017,  he  was  charged  with  felony  possession  of
dangerous  drugs,  including  marijuana.  He  was  convicted  of  possession  of  dangerous
drugs and received a sentence that included two years of probation, which was due to
expire in July 2023. (¶ 1.d)
The   SOR  alleged,  under Guideline   E,  that  Applicant  used  marijuana   on   various
occasions  between  2003  and  2017, and  that  he  sold  illegal drugs in  2017. (¶¶  2.a  and
2.c)   The   SOR  alleged   that   he   deliberately   provided   false  information   on   his  July  2008
and   his   February  2021   security   clearance   applications   (SCA)  when   asked   about   his
illegal drug  use  within the  last  seven  years of each  SCA listed  above.  (¶¶  2.b  and 2.d)
The   SOR  also  cross-alleged   all   the   allegations  listed   under  ¶¶   1.a-1.d   supra,   and   ¶¶
3.a-3.b, infra.
The SOR alleged, under Guideline F, that Applicant failed to timely file his 2013-
2019 federal income tax returns as required (SOR ¶ 3.a). It further alleged that he failed
to file his 2013-2019 state income tax returns as required  (SOR ¶ 3.b). The SOR also
alleged Applicant was indebted on six delinquent accounts. (¶¶ 3.c-3.h)
Criminal Conduct.
Applicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline J. In March 2004, he was
arrested  when  he  was  in  his  college  dorm  room  for  suspicion  of  marijuana  use.  The
arresting  officer  smelled  marijuana,  searched  his  room,  but  did  not  discover  any
marijuana.  He  was  jailed  until his hearing  where  the  charge  was dismissed for lack  of
evidence. (Items 2, 6, p. 6)
In  November  2012,  Applicant’s  car  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer.  The  officer
believed  he  smelled  marijuana  coming  from  Applicant  and  asked  to  search  his  car.
Applicant  consented  to  the  search,  but  no  marijuana  was  discovered.  Applicant  was
given a ticket for possession of marijuana and chose to pay a fine of $150  rather than
contest the case in court. (Item 6, p. 6)
In  October  2013,  Applicant’s  car  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer.  The  officer
believed he smelled marijuana coming from Applicant and asked to search his car. No
illegal drugs were found from the search. The officer wrote Applicant a ticket for illegal
possession  of  marijuana,  based  upon  the  officer’s  observations,  and  for  illegal
possession  of  Xanax,  based  again  on  the  officer’s  observations.  Applicant  contested
these charges and they were dismissed by a judge. (Item 6, p. 7)
In April 2017, local police arrived at Applicant’s residence with a search warrant.
They  discovered  a  prescription  for  OxyContin,  in  his  girlfriend’s  name,  and  seven
ounces  of  marijuana.  He  told  the  police  he  took  the  OxyContin  for back  pain.  He  was
arrested at the time, then released.  He was charged with various felony drug charges,
including  sale  of  marijuana,  and  possession  and  use  of  marijuana  and  OxyContin.  In
April  2021,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  lesser  charges  and  was  sentenced  to  60  days  in  jail
(deferred),  two  years  of  probation,  and  fines  and  court  fees.  Probation  was  to  end  in
July 2023. There is no evidence as to the current status of his probation. (Items 6 (p. 5,
6, 13), 7-8)
Personal Conduct.
Applicant  admitted  his  use  of  marijuana  from  2003  to  2017,  and  his  sale  of
marijuana  in  2017.  He used  marijuana  recreationally  during  his high  school years  and
through the years until March 2017. He asserts that he stopped using and possessing
drugs after his felony arrest in 2017. He further asserts he has no future intent to use or
possess illegal drugs. (Items 2, 6, p. 6, 11-12)
In Applicant’s July 2008 SCA, he marked “No” to the question of whether he had
illegally  used  any  controlled  substances  within  the  last  seven  years.  In  an  earlier
question  in  the  SCA  asking  about  his  police  record,  he  identified  a  2004  arrest  for
possession  of  marijuana.  In  his SOR  answer,  he  denied  this  allegation  stating  that  he
either misread or misunderstood the question. (Item 2, 4 (pp. 25-26 of 29))
In  Applicant’s  February  2021  SCA,  he  marked  “No”  to  questions  of  whether  he
had  illegally  used,  possessed,  or  sold  any  controlled  substances  within  the  last  seven
years. In an earlier question in the SCA asking about his police record, he identified a
2004  arrest  for  possession  of  marijuana,  his  2012  arrest  for  possession  of  marijuana,
and  his  2017  felony  arrest  for  various  marijuana  possession  and  sale  charges.  In  his
SOR answer, he denied this allegation stating that he either misread or misunderstood
the question. (Item 2, 3 (pp. 47-50 of 61))
The  arrests  discussed  supra  under  criminal  conduct  were  also  crossed  alleged
under Guideline E. (See ¶ 2.e)
Financial Considerations.
Applicant admitted failing to timely file his 2013 to 2019 federal and state income
tax returns. He stated that in 2013 he became homeless and did not have an address
where  his  IRS  W-2  tax  form  could  be  sent.  He  was  unemployed  from  August  2012  to
January  2014.  He  claims  he  did  not  have  the  means  to  pay  his  taxes  during  this
timeframe. In his February 2021 SCA, he stated that he finally had the means to file his
delinquent tax returns. He stated, “I had planned to handle it and [sic] the beginning of
the  tax  year  with  a  tax  lawyer.”  He  failed  to  provide  any  evidence  that  his  2013-2019
federal  and  state  tax  returns  have  been  filed.  IRS  tax  transcripts,  generated  in  July
2022,  for  tax  years  2018  and  2019,  show  that  no  returns  were  filed  for  those  years.
Applicant’s tax filings for 2013-2019 have not been resolved. (Items  2, 3  (pp. 52-55 of
61), 5-6)
Applicant admitted owing on six delinquent debts totaling approximately $11,976.
All the debts appear on his credit reports. He stated in his background interview that his
intention was to pay the debts now that he had a well-paying job. He failed to present
any evidence reflecting the current status of these debts or if he had made any efforts to
resolve them. These debts are unresolved. (Items 2, 6, 9-11)
Applicant  has  not  received  financial  counseling  and  he  presented  no  budgetary
information. (Item 6)

"The  SOR  alleged  security  concerns  about  Applicant’s  alcohol  use  and  alcohol-
related criminal activity that occurred between 1991 and 2017. In his Answer, Applicant
admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  but  he  denied  that  they  establish  a  basis  to  deny  him
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  Based  on  Applicant’s  admissions,  his
testimony, and the evidentiary record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant,   age   57,  is  unmarried   without  children.  He  has  been   in  a   relationship
analogous to  marriage  with  his girlfriend  for the  greater part of 20  years. He received  a
Bachelor of Science  degree  in  electrical engineering  in  1987. He  has been  employed  by
the same  defense contractor since 1987. He  worked in an electrical engineering position
for several years before transitioning  into  his  current systems engineer position. He  has
maintained  a  security clearance  since  about 1987.  (AE  B; GE  1; GE  2  at 7-8; Tr. at 9, 21-
22, 61-63)
1991 charge
In about August 1991, while alone at a nightclub, Applicant consumed beer in an
amount  he  could  not  recall.  He  denied  that  he  drank  to  the  point  of  intoxication  or
impairment. While driving home from the nightclub, a police officer stopped his vehicle for
a traffic infraction in a construction zone. He was arrested after failing a field sobriety test.
A preliminary breath test registered his blood alcohol content (BAC) as “something  like
0.05” percent. He refused to submit to a breathalyzer test. (GE 1; GE 2 at 6-7; GE 5 at
14; Tr. at 23-28, 74-78)
In November 1991, Applicant pled guilty and was convicted of operating a vehicle
while impaired. He was sentenced to 15 days in jail (all suspended), one year supervised
probation,  and  fined  $150.  He  was  also  ordered  to  complete  an  alcohol  education
program and to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (GE 1; GE 5 at 14; Tr. at
27-28, 54)
Applicant  found  that  the  alcohol  program  (consisting  of  “some  meetings”  and
education  on  the  “dangers  of  alcohol  and  stuff  like  that”)  and  the  AA  meetings  were
“useful.” He refused to submit to a breathalyzer test due to concerns that it could “possibly
hurt” him. He attributed the traffic infraction to his confusion about the cones and signage
in  the  construction  zone,  and  not  to  his  alcohol  use.  He  recalled,  “I  definitely  didn't
consider myself drunk or anything like that.” (Tr. at 25, 27, 75-77)
2005 charge
In about September 2005, while alone at home watching a football game, Applicant
consumed  beer in an amount  he  could not  recall.  He  estimated  that  he  drank  “a  few.”
After  the  game  ended,  about  midnight,  he  drove  to  buy  more  beer  so  that  he  could
continue drinking to celebrate his team’s “come-from-behind” win. An officer stopped his
vehicle after observing it swerve on the road. He was arrested after failing a field sobriety
test. He did not recall his BAC. (GE 1; GE 2 at 6; GE 5 at 15-16; Tr. at 28-34, 78-81)
In  February  2006,  Applicant  pled  guilty  and  was  convicted  of  driving  while
intoxicated.  He  was  sentenced  to  180  days  in  jail  (175  days  suspended),  one  year
supervised  probation,  and  fined  $1,100.  He  was  also  ordered  to  attend  an  alcohol
treatment program and a victim impact panel. (GE 1; GE 5 at 15-16; Tr. at 31-32, 81-82)
Applicant spent two weekends in jail. He attended the alcohol program for “several
weeks,” during  which  he  learned  about  the  “dangers of  alcohol both  to  your health, as
well as being . . . very dangerous when driving after drinking.”  The family members of
drunk-driving  accident  victims  comprised  the  panel  he  attended.  He  acknowledged,  “I
should have realized I was not okay to drive,” and stated, “I guess I was just too excited.
I mean, I wasn’t okay to drive.” (Tr. at 32, 34, 80)
2013 charge
In November 2013, while alone on a day-hike, Applicant consumed beer that he
carried in his backpack, in an amount he could not recall. He estimated that he drank “at
least three” during an eight-hour period. While driving home from the hike after sunset,
he crashed into a curb on the side of the road. A police officer arrived on the scene and
arrested him after he failed both a field sobriety test and a breathalyzer test. (GE 1; GE 2
at 6; Tr. at 34-39, 82-83)
In  February  2014,  Applicant  pled  guilty  and  was  convicted  of  driving  while
intoxicated with a BAC over 0.20 percent. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail (160 days
suspended), fined $500, and his driver’s license was suspended for 12 months. He was
also ordered to complete an alcohol safety action program (ASAP). (GE 1; GE 3 at 2; GE
5 at 12; Tr. at 36-38, 82-83)
Applicant  remembered  being  “surprised”  by  his  BAC.  He  stated,  “I  didn’t
understand  how  it  could  be  that  high.”  He  could  not  recall  his  specific  BAC,  but  he
estimated it “wasn’t way over” 0.20 percent. (Tr. at 38, 83)
Applicant spent 10 days in jail. He successfully completed ASAP, which consisted
of 26 weeks of “level 0.5 DUI education” and “group psychotherapy,” in June 2014. During
intake, he agreed to abstain from alcohol while in ASAP. The record did not address any
aftercare recommendations he may have received upon discharge. Although he could not
recall for sure,  he  conceded  that he  was “most likely”  advised to abstain from drinking
after discharge. (GE 2 at 9-10; Tr. at 51-54, 97)
2016 charge
In October 2016, Applicant was involved with law enforcement while out of state
on a hiking trip with his girlfriend. One evening, after a day of hiking, they “had a real big
argument” that carried over into the next morning, while in their hotel room. Because the
argument was “real loud,” a housekeeper or fellow guest called the police. The argument
ended  by  the  time  the  police  officer  arrived.  After  questioning  both  parties,  the  police
officer arrested Applicant. (AE B; GE 1; GE 2 at 6; Tr. at 39-46; Tr. at 84-86)
In August 2017, Applicant pled guilty to three misdemeanors: domestic violence
(DV) assault, intoxication, and DV unlawful detention. After holding his plea in abeyance
for an unspecified period, the court dismissed the charges. The terms of the abeyance
required him to undergo a DV assessment, complete any recommended DV treatment,
and pay a $780 fine. His assessment did not recommend any DV treatment. He was not
ordered to seek alcohol counseling. (GE 1; GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3-4; Tr. at 42-44)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  consumed  alcohol  (“a  few  beers  or  so”)  during  the
period leading up to his arrest. He recalled that he “probably drank”  in the park during
their hike; drank “a bit” that night because he was upset; and “did get a beer” the following
morning “just to start feeling better,” because he “wasn’t feeling very well.” However, he
denied  that  he  was  intoxicated  or  unlawfully  detained  his  girlfriend.  He  acknowledged
that,  while  arguing  that  morning,  he  may  have  grabbed  his  girlfriend’s  arms  to  defend
himself.  However,  he  denied  hitting  or  otherwise  assaulting  his  girlfriend  at  any  point,
either during the argument, or ever. He has remained in a long-term relationship with this
same girlfriend. In a post-hearing letter, his girlfriend corroborated that he has never been
violent towards her and referred the incident as “an unfortunate situation” that “incorrectly
assigned”  fault  to  him.  Applicant  and  his  girlfriend  asserted  that  he  was  wrongfully
arrested and attributed his arrest to the  state’s strict DV laws, and  to  the  police  officer
deeming Applicant a danger and threat due to his intoxicated appearance. (AE B; GE 2
at 6; Tr. at 40-44, 57, 84-86)
2017 charge
In  April  2017,  while  at  home  alone,  Applicant  consumed  beer  in  an  amount  he
could not recall. He estimated that he drank “somewhere around three” in the immediate
hour or two before he left home. While driving to his girlfriend’s home, his vehicle stopped
operating due to a mechanical failure. He believes someone may have called the police
due to his inebriated state. A police officer arrived on the scene and arrested him because
he  smelled  of  alcohol  and  failed  a  field  sobriety  test.  He  refused  to  submit  to  a
breathalyzer test. (GE 2 at 5-6, 7; GE 5 at 1-11; Tr. at 46-50, 87-89)
In August 2017, Applicant pled guilty and was convicted of driving while impaired
by alcohol. He was sentenced to 60 days in jail (all suspended), one year probation, and
fined $600. He  was  also  ordered to  attend  an  alcohol education  program  and a  victim
impact panel. Due to his refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test and to install an ignition
interlock device (IDD) on his vehicle, his driver’s license was suspended for nine months.
(GE 2 at 5-6, 7; GE 5 at 6-7; Tr. at 49-50)
Applicant completed the alcohol program on an expedited basis before sentencing
as a good-faith gesture, upon the advice of counsel. Between June and August 2017, he
completed 26 hours of comprehensive alcohol education and awareness programming.
Upon  intake,  he  was  characterized  as  a  “problem  drinker”  based  on  test  scores  that
“clearly  indicated  there  is  a  serious  alcohol  problem.”  During  intake,  he  was  strongly
advised  to  abstain  from  using  alcohol.  The  record  did  not  address  any  aftercare
recommendations he may have received upon discharge. Although he could not recall for
sure,  he  conceded  that  he  was  “most  likely”  advised  to  abstain  from  drinking  after
discharge. (GE 2 at 5-6, 11-18; Tr. at 54-56, 88, 97)
The alcohol program’s director opined that Applicant “benefited from programming
and organized and increased his understanding of the need to avoid alcohol and other
drugs, further studied their negative effects on driving, one’s self, one’s family and one’s
society.”  The  director  also  remarked  that  Applicant  took  the  program  “seriously”  and
“worked hard,” as evidenced by his “voluminous handwritten notes.” (GE 2 at 16-17)
Applicant maintained that he refused the IDD because he was not driving a vehicle
at  the  time.  He  travelled  to  work  via  public  transportation  because  his  vehicle  was
unrepairable after the mechanical failure. He recalled that he “felt good and everything”
and “didn’t feel impaired” when he left home to drive to his girlfriend’s home. However, he
acknowledged that he should not have driven after drinking. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. at 87-88)
Applicant has only undergone alcohol treatment when court ordered. Although he
never voluntarily sought out alcohol treatment, he recognized that it was important for him
“to reduce or quit [his] drinking.” He could not recall any voluntary cessation from alcohol
use,  between  1991  and  2017,  except  as  mandated  by  the  courts  during  his  probation
periods. However, he stated, “[t]here may have been.” He does not attend AA meetings
because  he  finds it “very uncomfortable” to speak in front of groups. Instead,  he  reads
books on how to overcome “drinking problems,” from which he has learned the dangers
of alcohol and its negative health effects. (Tr. at 54-58, 59, 73-74, 88-90, 95, 99-102)
Alcohol Use
Applicant  first described his history of alcohol use during his June 2018 subject
interview. He first consumed alcohol at the age of 17, while in college. During college, he
consumed about three to five beers at a time, in social settings, during weekends and on
special occasions. As he grew older and his tolerance for alcohol increased, the amount
he consumed increased, but he only drank on the weekends. He would sometimes drink
to  intoxication,  which  he  defined  as  six  beers.  He  described  his  behavior  under  the
influence of alcohol as uninhibited. He admitted that he had a problem with alcohol. He
acknowledged that his alcohol use negatively impacted his relationship with his girlfriend,
due  to  increased  arguing.  He  denied  that  his  alcohol  use  impacted  his  work,  but  he
expressed concerns about his ability to maintain his security clearance. He attributed his
criminal activity to his alcohol use, and he maintained that there was no possibility of a
recurrence because he stopped drinking in October 2017. He credited his court-ordered
alcohol classes with helping him to abstain. (GE 2 at 7)
At the hearing, Applicant attributed his cessation from drinking in October 2017 to
the negative impacts it had on his life, which he defined as the drunk-driving charges and
related loss of driving privileges. He could not recall the amount he was drinking prior to
October  2017,  but  he  acknowledged  that  it  was  “definitely  too  much.”  Applicant  was
unsure  for  how  long  he  maintained  his  sobriety  after  October  2017,  but  he  estimated
“several months.” At some point, he resumed  consuming alcohol on  the  weekends. He
could not recall what prompted him to resume consuming alcohol, but he stated, “I think
maybe I was at an event with alcohol and I probably . . . started slow . . .”  He thought it
was okay to drink again because he  was doing  well and  believed  that drinking  “a little”
would  not  cause  him  harm  or  any  issues.  He  never  drove  after  consuming  alcohol
following his 2017 charge. (Tr. at 54-59, 60, 90-95, 98, 101-102)
Applicant could not recall the amount that he “normally” drank when he consumed
alcohol, he estimated that it was “a few beers” at a time. On occasion, he consumed other
types of alcohol.  He  clarified  that,  when he described himself as  intoxicated,  which he
redefined as three beers, he did not mean “super drunk or anything like that,” just “high
enough blood levels to be intoxicated.” (Tr. at 28-29, 73-75, 78, 101)
Applicant stopped consuming alcohol as of January 2022, which was also the last
time he drank to the point of intoxication. He denied that his abstinence since January
2022  was  prompted by  concerns about  his security  clearance.  He  stated,  “I had  to  be
ready to do that. And, it wasn’t until January [2022] that I was ready.” He  attributed his
abstinence since January 2022 primarily to his past “negative experiences” and “all the
problems it’s caused” him, concerns about his health, and to his girlfriend not wanting him
to drink. (AE B; Tr. at 54-60, 90-95, 98, 101-102)
On the occasions when Applicant had been in environments where people were
consuming alcohol since January 2022, he was “okay just drinking soft drinks.” Although
he  did  not  “normally”  think  about  or  crave  alcohol,  those  environments  “sometimes”
caused him to do so. His girlfriend’s alcohol consumption “doesn’t really bother” him. He
does not “normally” have alcohol in his home, where his girlfriend resides with him part
time, except “maybe a special event for her.” Recognizing that stress was a contributing
factor  to  his  drinking,  he  has  learned  alternative  ways  to  manage  his  stress  without
consuming alcohol, including hiking and photography. (Tr. at 63, 103-104)
To  Applicant’s  knowledge,  he  has  never  been  diagnosed  with  an  alcohol  use
disorder. However, he described himself as an alcoholic, which he defined as “[b]asically
not having control over your whole life. I mean, there is . . .  alcohol is just causing . . .
issues in your life that you can't control.” He defined those issues as “all those arrests and
stuff.”  He  acknowledged, “once  you're  an  alcoholic,  you're  always  an  alcoholic.”  In
professing how his commitment to sobriety is different now than in 2017, he stated,
Well, my intention is not to start again because that's where . . . it gets . . .
once you start, then . . . you can't really control it. So the important thing is
not to restart. So I intend not to restart again.” (Tr. at 59, 95, 97, 99-100)
Whole Person
Applicant  expressed  pride  in  maintaining  a  high  level  of  work  performance
throughout his 35-year career. He asserted, “I never had any issue at work or anything
on  account  of  my  alcohol  use.”  His  employer  issued  a  special  recognition  to
commemorate his 35-year anniversary milestone. In congratulating him and lauding his
work ethic, his supervisor described him as a “dedicated, detail oriented employee with a
strong technical background.” (AE A; Tr. at 60)
Applicant acknowledged that he never reported any of his arrests to his  security
officer, knowing that he was required to do so. He was concerned that he would lose his
job if he reported them. He also never disclosed his arrests to his supervisor or anyone
else at work. His security officer only knew of the arrests in connection with his review of
Applicant’s SCA before it was submitted. His security officer filed an incident report about
his 2017 charge, based upon Applicant’s SCA disclosure, not because Applicant reported
it to him directly. (Tr. at 68-70)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant’s  long-time  girlfriend  submitted  a  letter  praising
Applicant’s character and work ethic. She opined that he is a “100% changed man.” She
corroborated that, as of May 2023, he had been “totally free from alcohol and drama for
more than a year.” She believed that he consumed alcohol “to relax and relieve the stress”
associated her medical diagnosis and several deaths in their families, including his father
in 2006; his mother, her father, and her nephew in 2020; and his nephew in 2021. (AE B)
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR. His admissions are incorporated
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony,
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He attended college at various times from 1990 to 2005
but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  married  in  2014  and  has  a  stepchild.  He  has  two  adult
children from previous relationships. He has worked for his present employer, a federal
contractor, since 2018. (Tr. 16-20)
Applicant was arrested in April 1992 and charged with robbery and conspiracy to
commit robbery, both felonies. He testified he was in college and he and a group of friends
decided to order a pizza and then steal the pizza from the delivery person and not pay.
He was with the group when two people stole the pizza and beverages and they all ran
away. Applicant ran and did not get caught but later turned himself in. He admitted it was
a dumb college stunt. He participated in a pretrial diversion program. He was required to
perform community service, pay a fine, and was on probation. He successfully completed
the  program  and  in  1996  the  charge  was  dismissed.  Applicant  did  not  disclose  these
felony charges on his January 2019 security clearance application (SCA) as was required.
He testified he was aware the charge was a felony and serious. His explanation for failing
to disclose it was he marked “no” in error. He did not know why he would mark “no” and
said he did not intentionally falsify his SCA. (Tr. 23-31; GE 1, 2, 14)
In  December  1993,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  simple  assault-physical  menace.
He pleaded not guilty and was found not guilty. He could not recall this arrest or any of
the facts. (Tr. 30-31; GE 5)
In  October  1994,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  obstructing  highways/other  public
passages. He explained that he grew up in a tough neighborhood and the police were
doing a lot of sweeps in the street. He explained that if you were outside, you would get
swept  up.  and  go  to  jail.  He  was  home  from  college  and  was  with  friends  and  was
arrested. A warrant was issued in 2007 for failing to appear for this charge. He testified
he  was  unaware  of  the  notice  to  appear  because  he  likely  went  back  to  school.  The
charge was dismissed in 2008 but Applicant does not recall the situation. (Tr. 31-34; GE
2, 6)
In July 1996, Applicant was arrested for alcohol in public, bad check, and failure to
appear.  During  his  background  investigation  he  told  the  investigator  he  had  written  a
check and intended to put money in his account to cover the amount, but he had a serious
motorcycle accident and spent three months in the hospital. When he was notified about
the bad check, he went and paid it. He said this was a separate incident from the alcohol
in public charge. He stated he was probably loitering when the police came, and he likely
had a bottle in his hand. He pleaded guilty to the alcohol in public charge. Regarding the
failure to appear charge, he said he likely did not show up in court for a previous charge.
(Tr. 35-39; GE 2, 7)
In May 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled
dangerous substance, less than 50 grams of marijuana, 5 grams of hashish. He explained
he was arrested the day after his birthday. A friend had given him some marijuana as a
present, and he was stopped by the police. He had been consuming alcohol but did not
recall how much. He was searched and forgot he had the marijuana in his pocket. When
he went to court, he said the judge was angry at the prosecutor because he or she had
made an error and did not have the required original documents to prosecute the case.
The judge dismissed the charge and told Applicant it was his lucky day, and he should
buy a lottery ticket. (Tr. 39-43; GE 8)
In  response  to  questions on  his SCA that asked  if Applicant  had  ever been  charged
with  an  offense  involving alcohol or  drugs, Applicant  responded  “no.” He testified  that  he
was  not  convicted   but   he   was   charged   so   did  not   disclose   it.   He   said   he   may   have
interpreted the  question incorrectly.  (Tr. 43-44; GE 1)
In  June  2007,  Applicant  was  charged  with  public  drinking  alcohol  prohibited.
Applicant  testified  that  this  arrest  occurred  during  one  of  the  police  sweeps  of  his
neighborhood. He and friends were drinking outside a house that was close to a liquor
store. He pleaded guilty to the offense. He believed he was required to pay a fine. (Tr.
44-46; GE 2, 9)
In   June   2012,   Applicant  was  charged   with   driving   on   a   suspended
license/registration  suspended/revoked. He testified  his license  was suspended  because
of unpaid parking  tickets.  He went to  pay the  tickets and  learned  the  tickets  belonged  to
his father who  had  a  vehicle  registered  in  Applicant’s name  and  did  not pay the  tickets.
His father had moved. Applicant paid the  tickets,  and his license  was reinstated. (Tr. 46-
47;  GE 12)
In  March  2013,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  on  a  suspected
license/registration  suspended/revoked.  Applicant  testified  he  pleaded  not  guilty  to  the
charge, and it was dismissed. He stated he did not recall if his license was suspended.
When completing his SCA, it asked if Applicant had been issued a summons, citation, or
ticket  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal  proceeding  against  him.  He  responded  “no.”  He
testified  that  he  did  not  know  why  he  responded  ‘no”  and  did  not  disclose  the  2013
suspended license ticket. (Tr. 47-48; GE 1, 10)
In December 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating under the
influence  of  liquor  or  drugs  and  operation  of  a  motor  vehicle  while  in  possession  of
narcotics. Applicant testified that he was intoxicated and was pulled over by the police for
failure to maintain his lane. The police searched him and found a bag of marijuana on
him.  He  was  found  guilty  of  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  or  drugs  (DUI).  His
driver’s license was suspended. He was required to attend a 20-hour alcohol information
course. This was the first time he attended an alcohol information course. (Tr. 48-52; GE
11)
In August 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and driving while
license suspended or revoked. Applicant testified that he was drinking alcohol with friends
at a bar. He and his friend left, and Applicant was following his friend in his car to another
location. He was stopped by the police. He said he was unaware that his driver’s license
was  suspended  when  he  was  stopped.  He  learned  he  had  not  completed  the
requirements for reinstatement of his suspended license that was issued by another state.
He  said  he  took  care  of  the  requirements.  He  spent  a  couple  of  days  in  jail.  He  was
convicted  of  DUI.  He  was  ordered  to  take  two  alcohol  courses  that  required  weekly
attendance.  He  testified  he  did  not  have  a  problem  with  alcohol,  but  rather  he  had  a
problem with driving after he had consumed alcohol. (Tr. 52-56 73-74; GE 2, 14)
In November 2019, Applicant was charged with simple assault-family violence. He
was  ordered  to  attend  a  24-week  anger management  course.  He  and  his wife  had  an
argument,  and  he  tossed  a  purse  across  the  room  and  the  strap  hit  her  leg.  She  felt
threatened, called the police, and then hung up. The police arrived and he was arrested.
He  admitted  he  had  consumed  a  couple  of  beers  at  the  time.  His  wife  contacted  the
prosecutor saying she regretted her actions. Applicant’s case was nolle prosequi under a
pretrial diversion program after he completed an anger management course. (Tr. 56-58;
GE 2, 4)
In  his  March  2019  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  He
confirmed the accuracy of a summary of his interview in September 2020. Applicant told
the government investigator that he drinks one beer a day and four on the weekends. He
said he does not drink and drive and instead uses an UBER for transportation. He also
said that there was a zero-chance alcohol would have a negative impact on his life in the
future. At his hearing, he said he obviously did not adhere to that promise. (Tr. 74-75; GE
2)
Applicant was asked by the government investigator about his criminal record and
if he was ever charged with a felony, been convicted of domestic violence, or charged
with an offense involving a firearm, alcohol, or drugs and he responded “no, only the DUI
charges.”  Only  upon  being  confronted  with  the  2007  criminal  charge  of  possession  of
marijuana did he admit the offense. He did not disclose the felony robbery arrest in 1992;
the  1993  simple  assault  arrest;  the  1994  obstructing  a  public  highway;  the  1996
possession of marijuana; the 2007 public consumption of alcohol; and the 2013 driving
with a suspended/revoked license arrest. These arrests were not disclosed or discussed
during his March 2019 interview. (GE 2)
In January 2020, Applicant was interviewed again by a government investigator.
He was asked if he had been arrested, charged with, convicted of, or sentenced for a
crime,  or  received  a  summons,  citation,  or  ticket  to  appear  in  court,  or  has  been  on
probation or parole. He said “yes” and said he had previously discussed all of his criminal
activity during his March 2019 interview.  That interview included his three DUI arrests,
and the 2007 criminal charge of possession of marijuana, but did not include disclosure
of the felony robbery arrest in 1992, the 1993 simple assault arrest; the 1994 obstructing
a  public  highway  arrest;  the  1996  possession  of  marijuana  arrest;  the  2007  public
consumption of alcohol; and the 2013 driving with a suspended/revoked license arrest.
When he was asked by the investigator if he had any additional criminal activity to report,
he said “no.” He did not disclose the above arrests. (GE 2)
In December 2021, Applicant was arrested for DUI, possession of an open alcohol
container and defective tires. He testified that he was going home, and his tire blew out.
He  pulled  over  and  put  on  his  emergency  flashers.  The  police  stopped  to  assist  and
smelled alcohol on his breath.  He  said he  had  consumed two  to  three  drinks.  He  was
arrested. He said the alcohol containers found in the trunk of his car were not from that
night and were trash. He was found guilty and sentenced in October 2022. He received
credit for the time he served in jail, which was about five days and a 90-day jail sentence
that was suspended. He was required to go to DUI school and be evaluated. He testified
he did not receive a diagnosis from the evaluation. He is also required to take another
course on drugs. He said he is currently registering for the course. He received a fine of
$2,600 that he pays in installments. He is required to complete 120 hours of community
service. He has completed about 28 hours. He was required to wear an ankle bracelet for
three months in 2022 that detects alcohol consumption. He is no longer required to wear
the bracelet. When he completes the drug course, he can have his license reinstated on
a restricted basis to drive to and from work. He is required to have an interlock installed
on his car. He is on probation until October 2024. He is to abstain from alcohol while on
probation.  He  meets  with  his  probation  officer  monthly.  He  is  required  to  abide  by  the
terms of his probation. He testified that he has not consumed alcohol while on probation.
(Tr. 59-72; GE 3, 13)
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  he  used  marijuana  from  1990  to  2016  and
wrote, “recreational occasional 5.” He testified that he does not know what he meant by
“recreational occasional 5.” During his background interview he told the investigator that
he  used  marijuana  three  times  a  month.  At  his  hearing,  he  said  he  did  not  know  how
accurate that statement was. He admitted that he has used marijuana since completing
his January 2019 SCA. He was asked when his last use was, and he said he consumed
an edible marijuana in 2021 and another time in 2022. He also acknowledged he was on
probation when he consumed the edible marijuana in 2022. He consumed it while at a
family  reunion.  He  said  he  no  longer  smokes  marijuana.  It  is  unknown  if  his  use  of
marijuana is a violation of the terms of his probation. (Tr. 75-82; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  told  the  government  investigator  that  he  continued  to  associate  with
people who use illegal drugs. At his hearing, he testified that he now tries not to associate
with people who use drugs. (Tr. 80-82; GE 2)
Applicant  was  asked  at  his  hearing  why  he  failed  to  disclose  his  felony  arrest,
domestic  violence  arrest,  alcohol  arrests  and  drug  arrests.  He  denied  he  intentionally
falsified his SCA. He said he did not remember a lot of his past. He said he did not have
any  idea  why  he  did  not  disclose  them  on  his  SCA  or  when  he  was  questioned  by  a
government investigator. He said at the time he did not recall certain offenses. He said
he was not trying to hide anything from the government. (Tr. 82-84)
Applicant testified that he has regrets his past, and he wants to move on. He is
remorseful for his past conduct. He has had personal issues that he has taken care of.
He stated that if it is determined that he needs additional treatment he will follow through.
He believes the anger management class he completed has helped his marriage. (Tr. 21,
84-85)

"In  her  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  admitted  ¶  1.b
under  Guideline  J,  with  explanations.  Under  Guideline  F,  she  partially  admitted  and
partially denied the cross-allegation at SOR ¶¶ 2.a, she admitted the conduct at SOR ¶
2.b,  and  she  admitted  all  of  the  debts  alleged,  (SOR  ¶¶  2.c  –  2.aa),  all  with
explanations. Under Guideline B, she partially admitted and partially denied SOR ¶ 3.a,
and  she  denied  SOR  ¶  3.b,  both  with  explanations.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  40  years  old.  She  married  in  2013  and  was  divorced  from  her
husband  in  April  2021.  She  has  a  23-year-old  son  from  a  previous  relationship.  She
earned a bachelor’s degree in 2009 and a master’s degree in 2013. (GE 1, GE 9 at 51;
Tr. 31-33, 48-49)
Applicant has worked as a federal contractor since at least 2005. She worked for
one company from 2005-2008 and with another contractor from 2008 until 2014, both in
State  1.  In  mid-2014,  she  moved  to  Puerto  Rico  with  her  family,  for  a  job  there  with
federal contractor H. She held that job, in Puerto Rico, from mid-2014 until March 2016,
when she was fired for misusing a corporate credit card, as discussed below. (GE 1 at
20-22, 55-56, Tr. 32-33)
After losing her job, Applicant returned to the mainland United States, moving to
State 2. (Tr. 84-85) She was briefly unemployed, until May 2016. She then worked for
contractor  C  for  several  months,  until  she  was  hired  by  contractor  R  as  a  direct
employee  in  November  2016.  She  worked  there  for  about  a  year,  until  moving  to
contractor  L  in  November  2017.  She  remains  with  contractor  L,  her  current  clearance
sponsor,  as  a  senior  systems  engineer.  (GE  1  at  14-20;  Tr.  31-33)  She  has  held  a
clearance since at least 2008 or earlier. (Tr. 31, 69-70)
In  March  2016,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  company  H  for  misusing  a
corporate credit card. (SOR ¶ 2.b) She explained in her background interview and in her
Answer  that  she  used  her  corporate  card  at  a  local  grocery  store  to  buy  food  for  a
barbeque  with  other  company  employees.  She  said  each  employee’s  purchases  were
within the company’s daily limit for credit card use. When she was questioned later, she
said she used the card to buy herself food for a barbeque. She was accused of buying
food for others, which was against company policy. She was later terminated. (GE  9 at
4; Answer;) Applicant said she never received a termination letter from company H. (GE
9 at 52)
Government  Exhibit  8  is  a  February  8,  2022  e-mail  from  a  security  manager  at
company  H  to  Department  Counsel.  It  likely  responds  to  an  inquiry  for  additional
information  and  company  documents  about  the  matter.  The  security  manager’s  e-mail
references  information  “that  I  was  provided  by  our  legal  department.”  This  information
includes  “admissions”  from  Applicant  that  she  a)  charged  over  $4,100  in  personal
expenses on her company H corporate card; b) gave her corporate card to her husband
“to  charge  personal  expenses  in  her  absence;”  and  c)  “misled  her  manager  regarding
her  physical  location  during  work  hours.”  (GE  8)  However,  there  are  no  supporting
documents  provided  in  the  record  from  the  company  to  corroborate  any  of  these
“admissions.”
Applicant  said  she  received  an  e-mail alert from  the  credit  card  company  about
possibly  fraudulent  charges.  She  then  reported  the  matter  to  her  employer.  She  said,
“once  I found out  it  was  my husband  who  did  it,  I paid it  all off.”  (Tr.  45)  She  was still
fired  from  her  position,  and  she  said  it  was  because  she  used  the  company  card  for
buying people food, in preparation for a company barbeque, as she said in her Answer.
She said other company H employees were terminated for similar conduct. (Tr. 44-47)
She has not had similar allegations of credit card misuse with other employers. (Tr. 47)
On  her  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  she  had  a  roommate,  Mr.  H,  a  Cuban
citizen with U.S. residency. (GE 1 at 34-35) Mr. H’s status as a Cuban citizen is alleged
under Guideline B. (SOR ¶ 3.a). His associate, Mr. B, is also a Cuban national. (SOR. ¶
3.b) (Tr. 73-74)
Guideline J:
In February 2019, Applicant was charged in State 3 with one count of felony theft
and three counts of felony identity theft. (GE 2, GE 4) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a) The offenses
allegedly occurred in September 2018. According to the criminal information filed by the
prosecutor in a State 3 court, Applicant and two male accomplices:
used  the  financial information  of  at  least  15  people  and  used  that  financial
information   to   move   money  from   the   victim’s  savings   accounts   into   their
checking   accounts  and   then   withdraw  from   ATMs,  make   purchases.  and
obtain  money orders  over the  course  of 61  transactions removing  a  total of
$40,419.78   in  funds.”   (GE   2   at  4,  Motion   for  Arrest/Detention   (Probable
Cause))
Applicant  travelled  to  State  3  by  plane  in  September  2018  and  rented  a  car.
Using  available  information  such  as  her  driver’s  license  and  images  from  her  social
media accounts, local police identified Applicant on video at multiple area grocery stores
making money orders using cards containing the names of the alleged victims, and on
video at a local hotel. (GE 2 at 4; GE 3, police records)
It was noted that there was reasonable cause to believe that Applicant would not
appear in response to a summons, so a warrant was issued for her arrest, on $50,000
bail. (GE 2 at 6; GE 19) A January 2022 fax to DOHA from a State 3 police department
providing the police records for the case included an “arrest date” of April 2, 2019, but
also that there was a “Felony warrant active/associated with this case.” (GE 3 at 2) SOR
¶ 1.a alleges both the outstanding arrest warrant and the underlying felony charges. (Tr.
12-13)
The  warrant  first  came  to  light  through  the  DOD’s  Continuous  Evaluation
Program,  which  noted  the  charges  and  the  February  2019  warrant.  The  report  also
noted that extradition was limited to five states in the Western United States. (GE 4; Tr.
111-112) Applicant  lives  in State  2,  in the  Eastern time  zone. She has not returned to
State 3 since 2018. (Tr. 70)
Applicant  did  not  disclose  the  matter  on  her  March  2020  SCA,  and  it  was  not
raised or discussed during her December 2020 background interview. (GE 1, GE 9) She
denied  SOR  ¶  1.a  in  her  Answer,  asserting  that  she  knew  nothing  about  it  until  she
learned of it in about December 2021 or January 2022 after she received interrogatories
from DOHA. (GE 9) She said she informed her facility security officer (FSO) a few days
later.  She  has  pursued  legal  counsel  in  State  3  to  resolve  the  matter.  (Answer)
However, she testified that she has taken no further action to resolve the matter, noting
that  she  was  told  that  retaining  local  counsel  in  State  3  would  cost  between  $25,000
and  $60,000.  The  bond  is  also  about  $50,000.  She  has  about  $5,000  saved  for  this
purpose. But the bench warrant remains outstanding. (Tr. 33-39, 70-72, 105-112; AE A)
She testified that she was told that she must retain counsel in State W because that is
where the bench warrant was issued. She understands that an active bench warrant is
an ongoing security concern. (Tr. 130-131)
As for  the  underlying  criminal charges,  Applicant testified  that she  went to  State
W  with  Mr. H  in 2018, when  she  was considering  moving  there  for a  job. She  said  they
were  at  a   restaurant   and   they   “ran   into”   an   associate”   of  his  who   asked   her  to   buy
money orders  for him.  They went  to  a  store  and  Mr.  B  asked  her  to  buy a  money  order.
They  went to  several stores to  do  so.  Mr. B  had  a  card  with  his  name  on  it and  he  gave
her the  PIN number. S  he  “never expected  it to  be  fraudulent.”  (Tr. 33-39, 72-76, 99-100,
121)   She  also   purchased   a  laptop   and   a   book  bag   for   Mr.  B.   She   denied   purchasing
money  orders  for  him   12   times.  (Tr.  75)   Applicant  had   never  met   Mr.  B   before   but  “I
trusted   Mr.  H.,  so   I   assumed   everything   was  good.”   (Tr.  100)   She   asserted   that   she
cooperated  with  federal law enforcement  officials when  they asked  her about the  money
orders in State  W. (Tr.  38-39, 107-108)  The  state  elected  not  to  file  charges against  Mr.
H, who was also implicated by the  police’s evidence.  (GE 3 at 12
Applicant explained that she went with Mr. H to State 4 for vacation to visit family
in 2018. While there, she said, they “ran into” Mr. B at a supermarket unexpectedly. She
said that “the same thing happened” as in State 3: “He gave me some credit cards with
his  name  on  it,  [and]  the  PIN  numbers, and asked  me  to  do money  orders.”  She  said
Mr.  B  told  her it  was  for his family in  another state.  She did not  know they  were  fake.
(Tr. 39, 76-77, 99-102, 121; Answer)
According  to  police  records.  the  conduct  allegedly  occurred  on  numerous
occasions in October 2018. Police in State 4 had access to the records from the offense
in State 3, and, from those records, it was “immediately apparent” that Applicant and Mr.
H were seen on multiple security videos in connection with the case in State 4. Felony
warrants  for  both  Applicant  and  Mr.  H  were  then  obtained,  in  about  November  2018.

Applicant  first  learned  of  the  charges  when  “[Mr.  H]  came  back  from  Cuba  and
was  arrested,  in  2019.  She  went  to  State  4  to  get  him  out  of  jail  and  was  herself
arrested. At the time Applicant and Mr. H were living together. She reported her arrest
to her employer’s FSO when she returned to work. (Tr. 39-40, 102-105)
In January 2019, Applicant was charged in State 4 on six felony counts, including
credit  card  fraud  (over  $500),  receiving  goods  fraudulently  (over  $500),  obtaining  a
credit card number [for] larceny, and related conspiracy charges. She pled guilty to two
misdemeanor  counts  of  credit  card  fraud  (under  $500).  She  received  a  90-day
suspended  jail  term  on  each  count  and  paid  $9,000  in  restitution.  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  She
completed  the  one-year  probation  term  successfully.  (Answer;  AE  B,  AE  C;  Tr.  41-42,
102-103 110-111).
Applicant’s  petition  to  have  the  police  and  court  records  for  the  dismissed
charges  expunged  was  granted  in  March  2022.  (AE  D,  AE  BB)  She  has  not  had  any
other arrests. (Tr. 42-43, 112)
Guideline B:
Applicant  said  Mr.  H  moved  to  the  United  States  from  Cuba  in  2016.  They
became  roommates  in  December  2017  and  lived  together  until  about  October  2020.
She  denied  any  romantic  involvement.  He  now  lives  about  15  minutes  away.  They
remain  friends.  She  last  saw  Mr.  two  weeks  before  the  hearing,  and  they  spoke  two
days before  the hearing.  They speak  about once  a week. He  is a Cuban  national and
permanent U.S. resident. (SOR ¶ 3.a) He will be eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship in
2024.  She  believes he renounced  his Cuban citizenship.  (Tr.  35,  42-43,  66-67,  77-78,
97-99,  118-119)  Applicant  and  Mr.  H  were  once  both  registered  as  co-owners  of  a
motorcycle. The motorcycle is no longer in her name. (Tr. 78-80, 96-97; AE II)
Applicant said Mr. H once owned a “pizza store” in Cuba. He served a mandatory
year in the Cuban military. His mother remains there as do two brothers and two sisters.
She has no contact with them, and she has never been to Cuba. His father is recently
deceased.  Mr.  H has returned  to  Cuba  three  or four times  since coming  to  the  United
States. (Tr. 80-82) After the hearing, Applicant provided a letter from Mr. H in which he
says  he  has  been  living  in  the  U.S.  for the last  seven  years,  intends  to  apply  for  U.S.
citizenship in 2024, and does not intend to return to Cuba. (AE NN)
Applicant believes Mr. B is also a Cuban national and permanent U.S. resident.
(SOR  ¶  3.b)  They  met  with  Mr.  H  at  a  club  in  State  3.  They  met  in  passing  and  she
never  wants  to  see  him  again.  She  believes  Mr.  H  and  Mr.  B  were  associates  and
friends in Cuba. She knows little of his background in Cuba and does not know what he
does in the U.S for work. She last saw him in State 4 in about 2018. She has been told
by  law  enforcement  authorities  that  Mr.  B  returned  to  Cuba  after  she  and  Mr.  H  were
arrested. Applicant and Mr. B have no current interaction. (Tr. 66-67, 82-84, 119)
Guideline F:
On her March 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed her 2016 termination for credit card
misuse.  She  also  disclosed  federal  tax  debt  to  the  IRS,  credit  card  debts,  a
repossession, and federal student loan debts. GE 1 at 55-64)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  concerns  Applicant’s  2016  termination  for  credit
card misuse (SOR ¶ 2.b), both of her 2019 arrests (cross-alleged together under SOR ¶
2.a),  and  numerous  delinquent  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  2.c  –  2.aa)  The  debts  are  largely
established  by  several  credit  reports  in  the  record,  from  between  July  2020  and  June
2023. (GE 12-14, 15a, 15b, 15c, and 21)
Some of Applicant’s SOR debts have been paid. After the hearing, she provided
an agreement with a credit counseling service that she retained in May 2023 to address
her  remaining  debts.  She  is  to  pay  $409  a  month  into  the  plan,  according  to  the
worksheet. (AE CC at 8)
SOR  ¶¶  2.c  ($5,121),  2.d  ($5,636),  and  2.e  ($15,255)  are  all  debts  that  have
been  charged  off  by  the  same  credit  union.  SOR  ¶¶  2.c  and  2.d  are  two  credit  card
accounts  Applicant  opened  with  her  former  husband  to  build  credit  history.  When  the
family  moved  to  Puerto  Rico  in  2015,  her  husband  refused  to  find  a  job,  so  Applicant
was responsible for everything for about three years, until 2018, and they fell behind on
their  payments.  (Tr.  48-50)  Since  February 2022,  she  has  been  paying  $100  a  month
towards debts 2.c and 2.d. (Answer; Tr. 48-51; AE E, DD) She was unclear how much
she  still  owes  and  there  is  no  current  credit  report  in  the  record  to  clarify  this.  AE  CC
shows she still owes both debts in full. (AE CC at 7)
SOR  ¶  2.e  ($15,255)  is  an  auto  loan  taken  out  jointly  with  her  ex-husband.  It
concerns a vehicle, now repossessed. Her ex-husband was making payments, but the
account  went  into  default.  She  must  get  his  permission  to  be  removed  from  the  joint
account,  and  they  have  no  contact.  The  amount  owed  is  what  remains  after  the  auto
was  sold  at  auction.  (Tr.  51-53)  The  debt  remains  outstanding  and  she  has  made  no
payments. (Tr. 86)
SOR ¶ 2.f ($2,515) is a judgment obtained against Applicant by Bank A in 2019.
(GE 1 at 64) This debt (actually for $2,535 – see GE 11) has been paid. (Tr. 53-54; AE
F, AA)
SOR ¶¶  2.g  through  2.t are 14  federal student loan  debts placed  for collection  by
the   U.S.  Department   of  Education.   As  alleged,  these   debts  total  about  $131,000.
(Answer;  AE   G,   FF)   A   June   2023  CBR   shows  14   federal  student  loan   accounts,  all
listed   as  “pays  account   as  agreed.”   The   combined   total  owed   is  about   $131,000.  (GE
21)  This debt is not addressed  in the  credit  counseling  plan.  (AE CC)
Applicant said she learned in 2017 that the forbearance period was ending. She
had not been notified earlier since she had moved. She contacted the collection agency
and  began  a  payment  plan.  The  accounts  are  now  with  a  new  collector,  N.  She  is
waiting  to  make  payments  since  the  debts  were  still  under  the  COVID  forbearance
program at the time of the hearing. She has a repayment plan in place of about $10 a
month for when the plan ends in the fall and can afford to do so, though she believes
the amount will change after the forbearance period ends. (Tr. 54-56, 86-87, 112-113)
SOR ¶  2.u  ($1,726)  is an account  that  has been  charged  off.  This was a  furniture
purchase.  It   became   delinquent  in   2019,  after  Applicant  had   to   pay  the  $9,000  in
restitution  for the  criminal case  in State  4. (SOR ¶  1.b). Debt 1.u  has been  paid.  (Tr. 56-
57; AE H)
SOR ¶ 2.v ($2,995) is a credit card account that has been charged off by a bank.
Applicant said it was opened by her ex-husband in her married name and the address
for  the  account  is  that  of  her  former  mother-in-law.  (Tr.  57-58)  Applicant  paid  the
account in full as of July 2022. (AE I, Z, and EE)
SOR ¶ 2.w ($87) is an account that has been charged off by a credit union. SOR
¶ 2.x ($94) is an account that has been charged off. Applicant opened account 2.w but
never  used  it.  Account  2.x  was  opened  by  her  ex-husband  in  Puerto  Rico.  These
accounts have been paid. (Tr. 59, AE J)
SOR  ¶¶  2.y  ($261)  and  2.z  ($828)  are  past-due  debts  owed  to  unidentified
medical creditors. Both have been paid. (Tr. 59-61; AE K, L)
SOR ¶ 2.aa alleges both $8,432 in past-due state income taxes for tax year (TY)
2014 and a 2017 state income tax lien for $7,586, both owed to State 1. The 2017 tax
lien is established by GE 10, but the tax year at issue is unclear. The $8,432  figure is
taken from a May 2018 letter to Applicant from a tax collection firm. (GE 16)
Applicant  lived  and  worked  in  State  1  for  part  of  TY  2014,  before  moving  to
Puerto Rico for her job with contractor H. She believed she did not have to pay federal
taxes  (or  file  federal  returns)  as  a  resident  of  Puerto  Rico.  Further,  she  asserts  that
company  H  erred  in  reporting  that  her  income  was  earned  “outside  of  Puerto  Rico,”
which, she believes, impacted what she owed in State 1 taxes as well. (GE 9 at 5-6, 53;
Tr. 113-114) The state tax debt and tax lien in State 1 (SOR ¶ 2.aa) ultimately resulted.
Applicant testified that when she learned of the state tax lien, she contacted the
state comptroller’s office. She said she was told to work through the IRS to resolve her
federal income and the state taxes would be revised accordingly. (Tr. 62, 114-116) She
included several documents relating to her efforts to resolve her federal tax debts. This
includes her Form W-2 from contractor H for TY 2014 (AE N), correspondence with the
IRS regarding TY 2014 (AE O), her 2014 and 2015 federal tax transcripts (AE P), and a
letter from contractor H to the IRS (AE Y).
Applicant  believes   that  once   her  federal  income   for  the   years  in  question   are
clarified   and   corrected,  she   will  not   owe  anything   to   past-due   state   income   taxes   to
State  1.  The state  lien,  however, remains outstanding, due  to  the  discrepancy related  to
her income  at company H. She  said she  remains in communication  with  State  1  but has
not   paid   anything   of   what   she   currently   owes.   (Tr.   61-62,  87-8)   AE   Y   is  an   April  2022
letter from Company H  to  U.S. Social Security,  in their attempts to clarify the matter. (AE
Y)  Applicant acknowledged  that she  still owes about $8,000  in state  taxes for TY  2014,
and the  lien remains in effect.  (Tr. 114-115)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  she  did  not  include  her  income  earned  from
company H in Puerto Rico on her 2014 federal tax return because she believed she was
entitled  to  a  special  tax  status  for Puerto  Rico  residents.  (Tr. 87-92)  Similarly,  she  did
not file a federal tax return for TY 2015 when she lived there and believes she did not
have to do so. (Tr. 92-93, 117-118) (SOR ¶ 2.bb) She did file a federal tax return for TY
2014, since she lived part of the year in State 1. (AE P) She does not believe she owes
any  past-due  federal  taxes.  GE  17  is  a  2016  IRS  bill  for  $7,251  for  TY  2014.  Since
returning from Puerto Rico, she has lived in a state with no state income tax. (Tr. 93)
AN II is an IRS publication (Pub. 1321) regarding “Special Instructions for Bona
Fide Residents of Puerto Rico.” It states, in part, that
In   general,   section   933   of   the   U.S.  Internal Revenue   Code   requires  that
U.S. citizens who  are bona  fide  residents of Puerto  Rico  during  the  entire
taxable year, but who receive income from sources outside of Puerto Rico,
and/or  receive   income   as   a   civilian   or   military  employee   of  the   U.S.
Government   in  Puerto   Rico,  must  file  a   U.S.  Federal  income   tax  return.
The income  you  received  from  Puerto  Rico sources is not  subject to  U.S.
income tax. (AN I; see  also  AE LL)
Applicant lived in Puerto Rico for all of 2015 but did not establish that all of her income
that year came from Puerto Rico sources.
Applicant  submitted  a  May  2023  credit  counseling  and  budget  plan.  (AE  Q,  AE
CC). It shows a monthly surplus of about $2,000 to $3,000. She has annual income of
$139,000.  Through  her  credit  counselor,  she  has  payment  plans  in  place  for  all  the
remaining  debts  under  the  credit  counseling  plan,  and  has  continued  to  make
payments, but for SOR ¶ 1.e for $15,000 and the state tax debt for $8,000, (Tr. 64-65,
119-120)
Applicant  provided  performance  evaluations  and  awards  from  her  job.  She  is  a
“top performer” at work. (Tr. 67-68; AE V, AE HH) She also provided a reference letter
from her former husband’s son, who has known her for many years. (AE X)
",False
"Applicant's admissions in his Answer are incorporated in my findings of fact. After
a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a twice divorced 44-year-old employee of defense contractor. He has
an adult-aged son from his first marriage. He married again in 2013 and separated from
his second spouse in May 2017. The divorce was final in 2019. There are two minor-aged
children from his second marriage.  There were also two stepchildren from the second
marriage. (Tr. at 121-122; GE 1 at 36-38) He was granted a security clearance in 2008,
again in 2011, and again in July 2015. (GE 2 at 52; Tr. at 123.)
SOR ¶  1.a:  August 2021,  charged  with  driving while  license  suspended. In his
Answer, Applicant denied the charge, as to the date listed, but admitted the underlying
conduct.  He  stated  that  mitigating  circumstances  applied.  He  noted  the  underlying
incident, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, occurred over five years ago. He acknowledged that his
driving  privileges  had  been  suspended  in  another  state,  after  he  pled  guilty  to  driving
under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  He  said  that  he  had  failed  to  satisfy  all  the
requirements of his sentence, which included documenting that he had completed a court-
ordered program and paid the required processing fee. (Tr. at 169.) His suspension was
flagged  by  his  home  state’s  department  of  motor  vehicles  (DMV),  which  resulted  in
suspension of his home state driver’s license. He took the steps necessary to  reinstate
his driving privileges in the state where he had received the DUI. (Tr at 77.) He then was
able to go to his DMV and get his license reinstated. (Tr. at 169.) He stated he was never
informed about the license suspension in his home state because the notice had been
returned  to  the  DMV  as  undeliverable  by  the  U.S.  Postal  Service.  (Tr.  at  77-78.)  The
charge  was  dismissed  without  prejudice  on  December  3,  2021,  after  he  provided  the
necessary paperwork (Tr. at 78; AE G.)
SOR ¶  1.b: January  2018, charged with  Breaking and Entering;  Assault and
Battery;   and   Abduction,   and   convicted  of   Assault  and   Battery   and  sentenced  to
one  year  of   imprisonment   (with   ten  months   suspended)   and   probation.   In  his
Answer Applicant admits being charged but disputes the accuracy of the charges while
acknowledging full responsibility for his inappropriate actions, which resulted in him being
indicted by a grand jury for a Class 5 Felony (Abduction) and  a Class 1 Misdemeanor
(Domestic  Assault  and  Battery).  (GE  7  at  6-7.)  He  pled  guilty  to  the  Class  One
Misdemeanor,  Domestic  Assault  and  Battery,  and  was  sentenced  to  12  months
confinement,  with  10  months  suspended.  (GE  7  at  8-9.)  He  was  allowed  to  serve  the
unsuspended  portion  of  his  confinement  on  the  weekends.  (Tr.  at  164.)  He  asks  that
mitigating circumstances be considered. (Answer at 4.)
After almost  three  years  of  separation  from his  spouse  he  entered  her home  in
hopes  of  catching  her  with  another  man  whom  he  believed  to  be  a  drug  dealer.  In  a
statement to a deputy sheriff, he acknowledged that he knew he was not welcome in the
home and that it was a poor choice to try to go upstairs to find the man. (Tr. at 154-156;
GE 4 at 15-16; GE 13 at 4, 5.) His spouse tried to stop him.  (Tr. at 154) He stated he
never laid his hands on her. “She grabbed on to my belt and went for the ride. And …I
had so much adrenaline going through me, I carried myself and her, with her dragging up
(sic) the stairs with her holding on to my belt or my clothing or whatever it was, and – all
the way into the bedroom where she let go after we entered the door.” (Tr. at 160.) His
spouse and stepdaughter described him as dragging her upstairs by her wrists. (GE-13
at 4.) After verbally confronting the man, he left his spouse’s home. Applicant attributed
bruising on his spouse’s wrists to their rough sex that they had engaged in earlier in the
day and to her anemia that  caused her to bruise easily. (Tr. at 158.)
He was arrested and held in jail for six days. (Tr. at 161.) He testified that he had
never laid a hand on his wife and had never raised his hand to a woman. (Tr. at 160.) He
explained that he only pled guilty to avoid possibly being sentenced to 20 years in prison
and to have a chance to gain  custody of his children, which he did. (Tr. at 168.) He stated:
“So yes, I did plead guilty to it. But did I do it? No, I did not. That's that fine gray area in
life that, you know….” (Tr. at 168.)1
SOR ¶¶  1.c  and 2.a: February  2017, charged with  DUI;  DUI  with  Blood Alcohol
Content   over  .15;   Evading;   and   Hit  and   Run  Property   Damage.  Convicted   and
sentenced  to   one  day   of   imprisonment;   three   years   of   probation;   forty  hours  of
I note: “The doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies in DOHA hearings and precludes applicants
from contending that they did not engage in criminal acts for which they were convicted. ISCR Case No.
95-0817 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1997). There are exceptions to this general rule, especially with respect
to misdemeanor convictions based on guilty pleas. Relying on federal case law, the Appeal Board has
adopted a three-part test to determine the appropriateness of applying collateral estoppel to misdemeanor
convictions. First, the applicant must have been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate  the issue in
the criminal trial. Second, the issues presented for collateral estoppel must be the same as those resolved
against  the  applicant  in  the  criminal  trial.  Third,  the  application  of  collateral  estoppel  must  not  result  in
“unfairness,” such as where the circumstances indicate lack of incentive to litigate the issues in the original
trial. ISCR Case No. 04-05712, (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006).” This  allegation falls  into the  exception. I have
applied the exception with respect to misdemeanor convictions based on guilty pleas.
community   service;  required  to   attend  a   three-month  first  offender  class;   and
license  suspended for one year. In his Answer Applicant admits that he was charged
with these four misdemeanors and takes full responsibility for his actions, which occurred
on the night his oldest son informed him that his wife was having an affair. (Answer; Tr.
at  91;  GE  1  at  43-45.)  He  notes  that  he  reported  the  incident  promptly  to  his  security
manager  and  the  accident  resulted  in  no  injuries  and  very  little  property  damage  to  a
barrier.
At the hearing he explained that he decided to  drink hard liquor instead of beer
and  when  the  bar did not  have  his  preferred  brand  of  rum,  he  was  served  rum  with  a
higher alcohol content. He said, “I did not know that” the rum had a higher alcohol content.
He stated that he ended up “getting inebriated” and drove into a vehicle barrier. He was
stopped  and  arrested  by  a  sheriff’s  deputy.  (Tr.  at  91-92.)  He  pled  guilty  to  DUI.  His
license was suspended for one year. He had to pay fines, court costs, attend a substance
abuse program, and do 40 hours of community service, which he said that he completed.
(Tr. at 92.)
During his security clearance interview he told the investigator that he had been
drinking  with  a  friend  he  had  made.  He  stated  that  his  friend  had  invited  him  to  his
residence  for a  social  gathering  and  that  he  had  consumed  a  mixed  drink.  He  did  not
recall any additional information about the night due to blacking out. He stated  that he
became aware of his surroundings when he woke up in jail. (GE 4 at 8.)
He said that he does not “drink any kind of liquor whatsoever” and if he does have
any kind of alcohol, “it is a couple beers, and that is it.” He added that he drinks by himself
in  the  privacy  of  his  “own  home” except  for  at  company  events  where  he  drinks  to  be
social. (Tr. at 93.) He vowed that he would not drink and drive again. (Tr. at 94.)
SOR  ¶  1.d: April  2013,  charged with  Possession of  Marijuana, Possession of
Drug  Paraphernalia,  and Speeding. In his Answer Applicant admits being charged but
denies  committing  the  offenses.  He  said  that  he  pled  guilty  to  an  improper  equipment
violation. (GE 2 at 43.)
Applicant was pulled over for speeding. When the state trooper asked  to search
his  vehicle,  he  consented.  (Tr.  at  94.)  He  acknowledged  that  he  had  told  the  security
clearance  investigator  in  his  2017  interview  that  the  state  trooper  said  he  smelled
marijuana  in the  car and  requested to search  the  vehicle.  (GE-2  at  42-43;  Tr. at 144.)
Applicant said that he did not smell marijuana because he had suffered multiple broken
noses and was a heavy smoker. He described the trooper’s discovery “as like the smallest
little  thing  in  a  little  bag,  is  what  the  police  officer  pulled  out.”  (Tr.  at  95.)  The  trooper
reported detecting a strong  odor of marijuana  after pulling  Applicant over for speeding
and that Applicant told him that the marijuana was in the center console of the vehicle.
The trooper retrieved a glass bowl containing marijuana with a cork and a glass pipe. (GE
12  at  1.)  Applicant  said  that  after  he  returned  from  the  work  assignment,  another
employee admitted that the marijuana and drug paraphernalia belonged to him. (Tr. at
95.)  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  denied  possessing  marijuana  since  1999.  (Tr.  at  110.)
Ultimately  the  charges  were  voluntarily  dismissed,  and  he  was  cited  for  a  nonmoving
violation, improper equipment. (AE N; Tr. at 96.)
SOR ¶¶   1.e  and 2.a: April  2006, charged with DUI; failure  to  stop at the  scene
of   an  accident,  and   refusal  of   breathalyzer.   Convicted  of   the   lesser   offense   of
reckless   driving;   required  to   pay   a   fine;   and   a  six-month   driver’s   license
suspension. In his Answer Applicant admits the allegation and takes full responsibility
for this incident. In mitigation, he cites that the incident is over 16 years old and occurred
during a fifth-year anniversary celebration with his first wife where he and his wife were
harassed by a group of 10 individuals. The group assaulted him, and he and his wife fled
the area in his car. They were chased by this same group and after the group departed,
he was picked up for driving under the influence.
At the hearing, he testified that his first spouse had been driving and wrecked the
vehicle. He said that he had been prepared to fight the charges, but his lawyer suggested
that he just take the plea deal. (Tr. at 99.) He pled guilty to protect his wife from having to
go through the legal process. (Tr. at 99.) When asked by his counsel, “Were you drinking
and driving on April 2006?” he stated “No, I was not.” (Tr. at 111.)
Applicant’s wife told the police that Applicant was driving the vehicle because she
was not good with a manual transmission and that he had been attempting to get away
from a group that was trying to fight him. She described Applicant as losing control of the
vehicle at an intersection and striking a tree. Applicant told the responding police officer,
that he had been trying to get away from a group of males to protect his wife and himself
and had lost control of the vehicle while attempting to evade the group of men. (GE 11 at
4.) He explained to a police officer that he left the scene of the accident to call the police
and that he had only consumed two twelve-ounce beers. (GE 11 at 4-5.) The police officer
noted the strong smell of alcohol from Applicant, that the vehicle’s airbags had deployed,
that the  driver’s side  airbag  had  blood  on  it, and that Applicant “was bleeding from his
head.” (GE 11 at 4.)2
SOR ¶¶   1.f and 2.a: March 1999, charged  and convicted of  DUI  (under  21)
and possession of  marijuana,  and required to  pay  a  fine, attend counseling;  and

from  contending  that they  did not engage in criminal  acts  for which they  were convicted. ISCR Case No.
95-0817  at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1997). There are exceptions  to this  general  rule, especially  with  respect
to  misdemeanor  convictions based o  n  guilty pleas. Relying  on  federal  case law, the  Appeal Board has
adopted  a three-part test to determine the appropriateness of applying  collateral  estoppel to misdemeanor
convictions. First, the  applicant must have been afforded a full  and fair  opportunity  to litigate  the  issue  in
the criminal trial. Second, the issues presented for collateral  estoppel  must be the same as those resolved
against  the  applicant   in   the  criminal   trial.  Third,  the   application   of  collateral   estoppel   must  not  result  in
“unfairness,”  such as  where  the  circumstances  indicate  lack  of incentive to litigate the  issues  in the original
trial.   ISCR  Case  No.  04-05712,  (App.   Bd.  Oct.  31,   2006).”   I   have   applied  the  exception   with  respect  to

since  this  incident  as  well  as  the  mitigation  steps  he  has  taken  since  the  incident  in
January 2018. (Answer at 9.)
At the  hearing  he  explained   “I was hanging  out with  the  wrong  crowd,  and  I  -- I
had,  I think it was like  a  beer. Not  even  a   beer. I don't remember because  it was a  big
bottle but  I didn't drink  it all. So  it was just,  I had  a  couple  drinks off of it. But we drove
afterwards.” He  could not remember why   he   was pulled  over but   blamed  the  police   for
pulling  him  over on  the  basis  of  “…being  suspicious  because  it was  like  1  in  the morning
or something  like  that.  In  [...  County], back then  that was suspicious  if  you  were  driving  at
1:00  in  the  morning  in a  small  county.” (Tr.  at  102.)  He pled  guilty and  lost  his license  for
a year. He  stated  that he  was required  to  go to counselling  and  submit to “drug tests and
all  that stuff…. I think I ended  up  having  to  do  two  days in  jail or three  days in jail  because
I failed a  drug test.  Again, young, dumb, and  full of it.” (Tr. at 102-103.)
SOR  ¶¶   1.g   and  1.h:   In  June  1998,   charged   with   simple   possession   of
marijuana  (Federal juvenile),  convicted  and sentenced to  probation. As  a  result of
failing  several   mandatory   drug  urinalyses   during   probation,   sentenced  to
approximately  three  days  of  imprisonment.  In approximately  May  1997, you were
charged  with   Possession  of   Paraphernalia   and  convicted.   (Tr.  at  13)  After  the
Government’s  amendment,  Applicant  admitted  the  incidents  and  discussed  the  two
events together. At the hearing he stated, “I got caught with a marijuana roach, probably
a 32nd-of-a-gram of weed,” which was the paraphernalia charge. He described the other
incident as “…the MPs sneak attacked us in the middle of the night. And I was the only
military person there, military dependent there out of 12 people. And so I was arrested for
possession of marijuana. And there was -- they found all kinds of marijuana in the woods,
but -- so I was -- I got -- everybody there, when we went to court, pointed the finger at
[Applicant]. I was the only one with pot. How funny that works. So I took that charge, and
I did that.” He acknowledged failing a mandatory drug test required as part of his sentence
and having to serve time in jail. (Tr. at 105, 106.)
SOR  ¶   1.i:   In  approximately   March  1996,    charged  with   Possession  of
Marijuana  with  Intent  to  Distribute,  convicted  and sentenced  to  probation, which
included  a   substance   abuse   program.  During  probation,
sentenced  to
approximately   two  days   of   imprisonment   as   a   result  of   failing  a   mandatory
urinalysis.   (Tr.  at  13.)  In  his  Answer  Applicant  admits  the  conduct  and  takes  full
responsibility for his actions. (GE 1 at 30.) At the hearing he admitted to being arrested
for possessing a quarter pound of marijuana. He was charged with intent to distribute. He
acknowledged his arrest in his 2008 SCA and in his 2008 subject interview. He admitted
providing marijuana to friends but denied dealing drugs. (Tr. at 126.)  He described his
response to his sentence as “I did everything but complete it successfully. I believe that I
had to do two days in jail because I failed a drug test.” (Tr. at 110.)
SOR ¶  1.j: In  February  1994,   charged with and convicted of  Possession of
Marijuana  and  sentenced to  probation.  (Tr. at 13.) In his Answer Applicant admits to
the possession and takes full responsibility for his juvenile conduct. (GE 1 at 31.) At the
hearing  he  confirmed  his  security  clearance  interview  that  he  was  arrested  for  having
about a gram of marijuana in his possession. (Tr. at 124.) He blamed his actions on trying
to make new friends because he was new to the area. (Tr. 125.) He cited the decision-
making of a young person, who did not realize what he was doing, for his actions. (Tr. at
108.) He admitted he “went to all these classes and all that stuff. And obviously, it didn't
work for me because I was again young and dumb” referencing SOR ¶ 1.i. (Tr. at 109.)
I  found  Applicant's  responses  and  demeanor  at  the  hearing  inconsistent  with
someone who was reliably telling the truth. Inconsistencies between his testimony, prior
pleas of guilty, statements to the police and background investigators. and other evidence
in the record including witness accounts further undermined his credibility.
Applicant  offered  the  testimony  of  two  work colleagues,  as  well  as  his  father,  a
retired senior enlisted member of the U.S. Air Force. The witnesses were very credible.
They detailed their familiarity with Applicant and events in Applicant’s life that had set him
back. The witnesses understood the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and
circumstances surrounding the conduct of Applicant. They expressed their confidence in
Applicant’s ability to maintain a security clearance. (Tr. at 26-29; 36-41; 48-57.)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with
explanations, except for the allegation in SOR ¶ 3.a, which he denied. His explanations
for the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d amount to denials, and I have considered
them as such. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 26-year-old forklift operator employed by a defense contractor since
June 2016. He has never married. He has served in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) since
January 2016. His military job is culinary specialist. He received an Army Achievement
Medal in March 2019. (AX H) He has held a security clearance since October 2015. (Tr.
5, 16; GX 10). He needs a security clearance to enter the shipyard for his civilian job. (Tr.
16)
In 2014, while Applicant was in high school, one of his friends who was with him
grabbed another person’s laptop. Applicant and his friend ran away, but they were later
detained and charged with felony larceny. Because Applicant was a juvenile, the felony
charge was nolle prosequi, and he was placed on probation for six months and required
to apologize and pay restitution. (Tr. 29-30) This incident was not alleged in the SOR.
In 2015, while Applicant was still in high school, he was with a friend who started
throwing rocks at a girl. Applicant testified that he did not throw any rocks, but he was
charged with assault and battery and required to appear in court. In November 2015, the
charge was dismissed on “request of petitioner.” (AX B) Applicant enlisted in the USAR
in  August  2015,  but  his  active  duty  for  basic  training  was  delayed  until  the  case  was
resolved. This incident was not alleged in the SOR.
In  March 2017,  while Applicant  was on  active  duty,  he  attended  a  gun  show  and
attempted   to   purchase   a   firearm.  When   he   filled   out  the   criminal  consent  form   for  his
background  check, he  answered  “No” to  a  question  whether he  had  ever been  arrested
for  a   felony.  He  did  not  disclose   his  arrest  for  felony  larceny  in  2014.  Based   on   this
omission, he  was charged with  making a false statement on a firearm consent form.  (GX
5)  In June 2018, the charge was dismissed. (GX 4 at 9) When  Applicant was questioned
by  his   platoon   sergeant,   he   told   him   that   he   had   misunderstood   the   question.  At  the
hearing, Applicant testified  that  he  thought  the  2014  incident was “cleared” and  he  was
not  required   to   report  it  on   the   criminal  consent  form.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant’s  USAR
commander was informed of the felony charge, Applicant’s explanation, and  the ultimate
dismissal  of   the   charges.  His  commander  told  the   battalion   security  manager  that  he
wanted  to  keep  Applicant in the  unit and  wanted  Applicant to  keep  his security clearance.
(GX  10; AX  A)  This incident  is alleged  in  SOR ¶  1.a. In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR,
he  admitted  that he was charged  with  a felony,  and  he  apologized for his negligence.
In September 2019, Applicant was charged with speeding 82 miles per hour (mph)
in a 60-mph zone. The charge was amended to speeding 71 mph in a 60-mph zone, an
infraction. (GX 5 at 3) He pleaded guilty and was fined $66. This incident was not alleged
in the SOR.
In  October 2019,  Applicant was arrested  and  charged  with  driving  while intoxicated
(DWI) (1st  offense)  and  reckless driving.  He  was driving  at  night in  the  rain,  and  he  ran  off
the  road  and  hit a  light pole.  He testified  that he  had  not been  drinking, but he  failed  a
field sobriety test because  he  could not recite  the  alphabet backwards. Two  breathalyzer
tests failed  to  detect alcohol. (Tr. 40-41) He went to  trial, was represented  by an  attorney,
and  was  found not  guilty  of both offenses. (GX  5  at 7)  This  arrest  for DWI  was  alleged  in
SOR ¶  1.b, and  Applicant admitted  it in  his answer.  The  charge  of reckless driving  was
not alleged in the  SOR.
In  July 2020,  Applicant  was  charged  with driving  44 mph  in  a 30-mph  zone,  an
infraction.  Disposition  was  deferred  and  the  charge  was  dismissed  in  December  2020
(GX 5 at 9) This charge was not alleged in the SOR.
In   August   2020,   Applicant   was   charged   with   assault   and   battery   involving   his
girlfriend  at the  time. They began  arguing  while they were in  his car.  When  they got out
of  the   car,  the   girlfriend   threw  a   drink  at  him   and   tried   to   slap   him.  He  went  into   the
girlfriend’s house  to  retrieve  his belongings, and  when  he  stepped  outside, his girlfriend
sprayed  him  with  pepper spray.  He pushed  her away  with  the  palm  of his hand  and  hit
her nose,  which began  bleeding, and  she  fell to  the  ground. He  then  left  the  scene.  After
he  was served  with  a  warrant,  he  filed  an  assault complaint against  her. Both  parties were
represented  by  attorneys, and  they mutually agreed  to  dismiss  both  complaints.  (Tr. 48-
51; GX  3  at 7) This incident  is alleged  in  SOR ¶  1.c, and  Applicant  admitted  being  charged
in his answer  to  the SOR.
On a later date in August 2020, Applicant was in a restaurant with a female friend.
They had agreed that each would pay their own bill, but his friend left without paying her
bill. The restaurant owner demanded that Applicant pay both bills, but when he refused,
the restaurant owner called the police, who charged him with restaurant fraud. Applicant
testified that he would have paid the entire bill if he had enough money, but he was “in a
tough spot at the time.” (Tr. 54) He eventually paid it. (Tr. 55) He went to court on October
7, 2020, and was found not guilty. (GX 3 at 8; GX 4 at 10) This incident is alleged in SOR
¶ 1.d, and Applicant admitted his arrest in his answer.
In  April  2021,  Applicant  was  charged  with  evasion  of  a  traffic  control  device,
reckless  driving,  and  failure  to  obey  a  highway  sign.  The  reckless  driving  charge  was
reduced to exercising improper control. He was convicted of improper control and failure
to obey a highway sign. The charge of evading a traffic control device was dismissed. He
was fined $25 for each of the two other violations. (GX 5 at 11-15) He testified that he
was  driving  through  a  very  congested  and  confusing  construction  zone,  and  he  drove
around one of the traffic barriers. (Tr. 56-57) This incident is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, and
Applicant admitted the arrest in his answer. SOR ¶ 1.e is not fully established, because
the  failure  to  obey  a  traffic  sign  is  an  infraction,  not  a  criminal  offense.  The  reckless
driving, reduced to exercising improper control, was not alleged.
On March 22, 2022, Applicant underwent a random urinalysis administered by his
USAR  unit  that  tested  positive  for  tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC).  (GX  7)  In  a  sworn
statement  he  provided  to  his  company  commander,  he  stated  that  he  purchased  an
electronic cigarette  (vape) from a  gas  station.  He  stated  that  he  specifically asked  the
store clerk if the vape he purchased contained THC, and he was informed by the store
clerk  that  it  did  not.  The  information  from  the  store  clerk  was  incorrect,  and  Applicant
tested positive for THC. (GX 8 at 5)
In June 2023, Applicant voluntarily provided a urine sample to his civilian employer,
and  the  results  were  negative  for  cocaine,  marijuana,  opiates,  amphetamines,  and
phencyclidine. (AX E) He was screened for drug involvement and was found to have no
alcohol or other drug problem. (AX D)
When Applicant submitted his SCA in July 2020 he answered “no” to the question
asking if, in the past seven years, he had been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to
appear in court in a criminal proceeding against him; if he had been arrested by any police
officer,  sheriff,  marshal  or  other  type  of  law  enforcement  official;  and  if  he  had  been
charged, convicted, or sentenced for a crime in any court. When he was interviewed by
a security investigator in October 2020, he told the investigator that he did not realize that
he had been charged with a felony for his involvement in the laptop theft in 2014. When
the investigator confronted him with his arrest record, he told the investigator that he did
not list his arrests in his SCA because he did not read the questions carefully. (GX 3 at
7-8) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he did not disclose his arrest record in July
2020 because he misread the question.
Applicant submitted another SCA in May 2022, and he answered “no” to the same
question about his arrest record. He also answered  “no” to a  question  asking  if he had
ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs, and he did not disclose his
arrest for DUI in October 2019. In his answer to the SOR, he claimed that he misread the
questions.
After  Applicant  was  charged  with  falsifying  the  criminal  consent  form  in  March
2017, his commander requested that he retain his security clearance and remain in the
unit.  (AX  A)  Applicant  received  the  Army  Achievement  Medal  in  March  2019  for
exceptional service. (AX H) He completed a course in Security Education, Training, and
Awareness,  in  June  2020.  (AX  I)  A  fellow  member  of  the  USAR  has  known  Applicant
since September 2019 and regards him as a friend and “awesome mentor.” Her position
in the USAR is not reflected in her statement. (AX G)
One of Applicant’s co-workers states that he is a skilled forklift operator and a very
diligent  worker.  His  work  ethic  and  dedication  are  noted  and  appreciated  by  all  the
employees working with him. (AX F)

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted all the allegations under Guidelines J, G, and
H,  in  the  SOR  with  some  explanation.  He  failed  to  address  the  allegations  under
Guideline  E,  which  are  cross  allegations  previously  alleged.  I  will  adopt  Applicant’s
admissions  to  the  cross-alleged  allegations  as  his  response  to  the  Guideline  E
allegations as well. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is   27   years  old.   He   is   married   for  the   second   time.  He   served   in   the
U.S.  Marine   Corps   from   approximately   2015   to   2019   when   he   was  administratively
separated   with   a   general  discharge   as  further  explained,   infra.  He   has  worked   for   a
defense  contractor  since  June  2020.  He  has two  biological children  and  a  stepchild.  He
is a high  school graduate  and has taken some college courses.  (Tr. 6, 25-27; GE  1)
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged in January 2021, with
illegal discharge of a firearm, intoxication, and with carrying a dangerous firearm under
the influence of alcohol. He entered a plea in abeyance agreement and was sentenced
to pay fines and fees, and a term of 12 months’ probation. He was required to abstain
from  alcohol  consumption  during  his  probation.  In  about  September  2018,  Applicant,
while  serving  in  the  Marine  Corps,  was  charged  with  wrongful  use  of  controlled
substances  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ).  As  a  result  of  this
investigation, he was administratively separated from the Marine Corps and received a
general discharge. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b)
Under Guideline G, the SOR alleged Applicant was required to attend an alcohol
education  class  in  March  2019.  It  also  cross-alleged  the  firearm-alcohol  arrest  from
January 2021. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.b)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  steroids  from  September
2016  to  April  2017,  while  holding  a  security  clearance.  It  also  cross-alleged  the
September 2018 UCMJ offense. (SOR ¶¶ 3.a-3.b)
Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the allegations from SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
and 3.a. (SOR ¶¶ 4.a-4.c)
Criminal Conduct.
Applicant  testified that he was using steroids  while on active duty in  the Marine
Corps  for  about  six  weeks  in  2016-2017.  He  testified  that  he  had  access  to  classified
information  at  the  time  of  his  use.  He  admitted  in  his  August  2020  security  clearance
application  (SCA)  that  he  used  steroids  from  September  2016  to  April  2017.  He
obtained  the  steroids  from  another  Marine.  He  claimed  that  he  began  using  steroids
because  he  was  concerned  about  being  able  to  meet  the  required  physical  fitness
standards of the Marine Corps. He also received advice from former Marines whom he
considered mentors. They recommended using steroids. He stated that he has not used
steroids since this time frame. (Tr. 24-25, 31, 33-35, 40; GE 1)
While  Applicant  was  investigated  and  interviewed  by  the  Naval  Criminal
Investigative  Service  (NCIS)  for  his  steroid  involvement,  there  is  no  evidence  that  he
was charged under the UCMJ. He admitted receiving an administrative discharge with a
general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions  characterization  related  to  his  steroid
involvement. (Tr. 25; GE 1, 4)
Alcohol Consumption.
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  NCIS  regarding  his  steroid  abuse,  he  also
admitted  drinking  approximately  10  beers  the  previous  weekend  at  a  housewarming
party. This information was related to Applicant’s command who ordered him to attend
alcohol-education classes. Applicant attended the classes. (GE 2; Answer to SOR).
The  second  alcohol-related  allegation  involves  Applicant’s  criminal  arrest  in
January 2021. He stated that he and his family were at a friend’s apartment complex to
celebrate New Year’s Eve. The apartment complex was in a residential area. There was
a  vacant  field  close to the apartment  complex  that  Applicant described  as about  three
miles long. He and his friend had been drinking alcohol that evening. At approximately
midnight, Applicant and his friend fired a small caliber rifle into the air three to four times
to celebrate the new year. A neighbor called the police and Applicant was cited for gun
and alcohol violations, upon which he later entered a plea agreement, supra. (Tr. 36-37;
GE 1-3, 6-7)
Drug  Involvement and Substance Misuse.
As  stated  supra,  Applicant  admitted  illegal  steroid  use  sometime  between
September 2016 and April 2017. He was an active-duty Marine then and had access to
classified information. His use, while a Marine, resulted in his administrative discharge
with a general discharge. He stopped using steroids in 2017. (Tr. 24-25, 31, 33, 35; GE
1)
Personal Conduct.
The  factual  background  for  the  personal  conduct  allegations  have  been
previously described and will not be repeated here.
Applicant’s Mitigation.
Applicant  presented  his  2021  year-end  performance  review  and  his  2022
midpoint review. He is described as an effective team player. He makes an outstanding
contribution to the team’s productivity. He documented that he complied with the terms
of his probation and his 2021 gun and alcohol charges were dismissed. He testified that
he has had no further involvement with law enforcement since his January 2021 arrest.
(Tr. 44; AE A-B)

"Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  under  Guideline  F.  He  stated  in
response to SOR ¶ 2.a that he did not intentionally falsify his May 2019 security clearance
application  (SCA),  so I  have  construed his response  as a  denial  of  that allegation.  He
neither admitted nor denied SOR ¶ 3.a, so I have construed his silence as a denial of that
allegation. He is 31 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was not married, and he
did  not  have  any  children.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2011  and  subsequently
attended college until 2014 but did not earn a degree. He has rented his current residence
since approximately December 2022. (Answer; Tr. at 7-8, 22-23, 52-53; GE 1)
Applicant worked for a private company from approximately January 2015 to May
2019.  He  was  subsequently  unemployed  until  approximately  September  2020,  in
preparation for joining the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). He briefly served in the USMC,
from  September  2020  to  January  2021,  when  he  was  administratively  discharged  for
misconduct and received an other than honorable (OTH) discharge, as further discussed
below. In approximately 2021, he accepted a position with a DOD contractor contingent
on obtaining a security clearance, and that company was sponsoring him for a clearance
as of the date of the hearing. He was unemployed for about a month and a half while
awaiting the outcome of his clearance, and then he obtained contract work through an
employment agency. When he was in between contracts, he had one to two brief periods
of  unemployment.  In  2022,  he  began  working  full  time  for  his  employer,  a  private
company, as a security system engineer. He has never held a security clearance. (Tr. at
5, 8-10, 23-36, 52-56, 63-70, 76-77, 80; GE 1, 5; AE D)
The SOR alleged, under Guideline F, that Applicant had two delinquent  student
loans,  totaling  $17,034.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b)  It  also  alleged  that  he  had  two  delinquent
consumer  debts,  totaling  $22,395  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.e),  and  a  delinquent  $68  medical
account  (SOR  ¶  1.d). The  Guideline  F  SOR  allegations  are established  by Applicant’s
admissions in his Answer; his May 2019 security clearance application (SCA); three credit
bureau reports from May 2019, September 2021, and September 2022; and his August
2019 interview with an authorized DOD background investigator. (Answer; GE 1-5)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts primarily to his periods of unemployment
and  underemployment  since  2014,  when  he  left  college  to  begin  working.  His  parents
assisted him financially during this period. He was unaware that he had any delinquent
debts until the investigator asked him about them during his 2019 background interview.
Once he became aware of them, he started to try to resolve them. (Tr. at 23-26, 45, 48,
54-56, 58, 63-68, 75-76; GE 1, 5; AE E)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are  two  federal  student  loans,  in  collection  for  $8,676  and
$8,358,  respectively.  Applicant  attended  college  on  an  athletic  scholarship  but  lost  his
scholarship after he was injured during his freshman year. His parents bore the cost of
his college tuition at a time when they were experiencing financial difficulties. He believed
his parents paid for his college education and that his father, with whom he has the same
name, obtained these loans to pay for his last years of college. He did not recall signing
any loan paperwork, so he was unaware that he had any student loans, or that the student
loans were delinquent, until he was informed about them during his background interview.
(Tr. at 22-23, 36-42, 58-63; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A, E).
Applicant  indicated  during  his  background  interview  that  he  had  not  been
contacted to repay any outstanding student loans, but he was willing to repay them. At
the hearing, he stated that he understood the loans were his obligation since they were
reported on his credit reports. He believed his parents had been paying these loans in
accordance with a payment arrangement, and he contributed by providing them with $50
monthly,  until  payments  on  his  student  loans  were  deferred  during  the  COVID-19
payment  pause.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Education  deferred  student  loan  payments
beginning in March 2020, to provide relief to borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
See
https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/payment-pause-zero-
interest. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims of payment before
the COVID-19 payment pause. He understood that he was obligated to pay these loans

not reported on the most recent credit bureau report from May 2023. (Tr. at 22-23, 36-42,

SOR ¶ 1.c is an apartment rental account in collection for $3,924. Applicant lived
in this apartment from approximately July 2015 to March 2019, when he broke his lease
to move to a different state in pursuit of better job opportunities. He contacted the creditor
and settled the debt for $2,700, which he stated he paid with savings. As of December
2021, this debt was paid. (Tr. at 42-47, 65-66; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.d is a medical account in collection for $68. Applicant indicated during
his background interview that this debt was for treatment he received in approximately
September 2015. At the hearing, he stated that he paid this debt but he could not recall
when he did so. This debt was not reported on the most recent credit bureau reports from
September 2022 and May 2023. (Tr. at 47, 66; GE 2, 3, 5; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.e is an auto loan in collection for $18,471. In 2017, Applicant traded his
SUV for a used car. He was subsequently unable to make his monthly payments because
he signed a high interest auto loan, and he was transitioning between jobs. His car was
repossessed in March 2018. He believed that his car was auctioned and sold to cover his
outstanding  balance.  He  stated  that  he  had  never  been  contacted  regarding  any
deficiency balance and he did not believe he had one. Although this debt was reported
with a zero balance on the most recent credit bureau reports from September 2022 and
May 2023, the latter credit bureau report continues to note that this account was charged
off for $18,471. He did not provide documentation of his efforts to address this debt. (Tr.
at 47-50, 66, 75-76; GE 2, 3, 4)
The  SOR also alleged,  under Guideline  E, that Applicant  intentionally falsified  his
response   to   section   26   of  his  May  2019   SCA,   which   inquired   about  his  financial
delinquencies, when   he   marked   “No” and   failed   to   disclose   his delinquent debts in SOR
¶¶  1.a-1.e. (SOR ¶  2.a) As previously stated,  Applicant  indicated  during  his  background
interview  that  he   did   not   list  his  debts   because   he   was   unaware   of   them.  He
acknowledged   at  the  hearing   that   although  he   was   aware   the   car   securing   the  debt  in
SOR ¶  1.e  was repossessed,  he  did not  list it  because  he  was confused  by the question,
since   the   repossession   occurred   before  he   completed   the   SCA.   He  did  not   recall
completing  the  SCA, and  it was the  first time  he  had  ever completed  one. (Tr. at 40, 50-
52, 76-80; GE 5)
Applicant’s  annual  income  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing  and  since  2022  was
approximately $80,000. His monthly net pay was approximately $5,500. He anticipated
that  his  monthly  net  remainder  after  expenses,  to  include  his  monthly  rent  of  $1,200,
would be approximately $3,200. He uses a budget to manage his finances. He had $5,500
in savings. He has been working to rebuild his credit. Although he stated that he does not
have any other delinquent debts, his most recent credit bureau report from  May 2023,
which reflects a fair credit score, reports a new account in collection for $970. He has not
received credit counseling. (Tr. at 52-58, 76; AE A. C)
As discussed above, Applicant briefly served in the USMC from September 2020
to January 2021, when he was administratively discharged for misconduct and received
an OTH discharge. Records pertaining to his discharge reflect that he was the subject of
non-judicial punishment (NJP) in October 2020, for violating Article 90 (willfully disobeying
a  superior  commissioned  officer)  and  Article  91  (insubordinate  conduct),  when,  in
September  2020  and  November  2020,  he  refused  orders  to  train,  and  he  refused  to
execute such orders. He waived an administrative separation board and understood that
he received a punitive mark on his record and an OTH discharge. He stated:
I  initially  entered   the   Marine   Corps   with   a   0321   contract,  which  is
[reconnaissance]   in  infantry,   which   is  what  I  initially  signed   up   for  and
trained  for. And  then  during  the  pipeline  in my training  process, I  was then
reclassified  to  the  needs of the  Marine  Corps to  aviation  tech, an  aviation
mechanic, essentially, which  was an  undesirable position  for me  to  have.
So  I respectfully went  to  my commanding  officer to  see  if anything  could be
done    to    make    those    changes  and    if  there’s  any  way  that  I  can    either
continue   my   service   in   a   desirable field or leave   the   service   altogether. It’s
just   not   something   that   I’m   -- at   the   time, I was   29   years old, so   I didn’t want
to   be   in a   path   where I   didn’t have  any business being  in or wanted  or any
interest  in. So  my  commanding  officer put me  on  a  quote-unquote  fast track,
which  is an  NJP board, so  I would be  administratively discharged.  (SOR ¶

professional certifications. He has worked in the security field since 2010. As of the date
of the hearing and since January 2021, he has worked as an industrial security specialist
for his employer, a DOD contractor. He also has worked as a part-time security officer for
an  agency  or  department  of  the  U.S.  government  since  January  2023.  He  was  first
granted a security clearance in approximately 2011. (Tr. at 5, 20-23, 79-80, 85-87, 91-93;

Applicant’s parents separated when he was four years old. He and his three older
brothers were raised by their mother. His father “was in and out of my life growing up so
that kind of took a toll on me, didn’t understand why he didn’t want to be, you know, part
of me and my brother’s lives.” He testified:
Just –  well, my mother was always working so I kind of  –  you know, kind of
just  grew up  watching  stuff  in  the  neighborhood, you  know,  really not any
type  of, like  real discipline. I felt like  that,  you  know, kind  of led  me  down a
path of wrong  decisions. (Tr. at 24-26)
Between  2009  and  2022,  Applicant  was  involved  in  seven  alcohol-related
incidents.  In  December  2009,  at  age  20,  he  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  public
swearing/intoxication, and he was found guilty in absentia. (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 2.h) He recalled
living with his mother and believed he had just been laid off from his job as an electrician.
He  acknowledged  consuming  alcohol  before  age  21,  but  he  could  not  recall  the
circumstances surrounding this incident. (Tr. at 27-28, 80; GE 5)
In November 2010, at age 21, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor Driving
While  Intoxicated  (DWI),  1st  offense.  He  pled  guilty  to  the  reduced  charge  of
misdemeanor  reckless  driving,  and  he  was  sentenced  to  90  days  in  jail,  suspended,
unsupervised probation for one year, his driver’s license was restricted for six months, he
was ordered to attend an alcohol safety action program (ASAP), and he was fined. (SOR
¶¶ 1.e, 2.h; Tr. at 28-31, 83-88; GE 4, 5)
This was Applicant’s first DWI. He consumed around three to four 12-ounce mixed
drinks while he was at a bar with a friend for a birthday party. It was raining as he drove
home,  and  he  lost  control  of  his  vehicle  and  hit  a  street  pole.  He  was  hospitalized  for
“breaks  in  my  pelvis,  fractures  in  my  spine,  and  a  laceration  in  my  hand,”  and  the
passenger had a ruptured spleen and possibly a broken rib. Applicant testified:
Well,  in   the   past,   I   blamed   [the   car  crash]  on   the   weather.  Always
considered  myself good  enough  to, you  know, drive  that day. And  looking
back now on  it, I believe  alcohol definitely played  a  factor in my decisions
that night. I made  a  poor decision  to  make  the  turn doing  40  miles an  hour
and   having   summer  tires  on   the   vehicle   and   losing   control.   I  definitely
shouldn’t have  been  driving  if I  wasn’t  able  to  make  the  correct decision  in
the weather.   (Tr. at 28-31, 83-88; GE  4, 5)
In  March  2013,  at  age  23,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DWI,  1st
offense,  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  greater  than  .20%,  and  carrying  a  concealed
weapon, both misdemeanors. He was convicted of the amended charge of misdemeanor
DWI, 1st offense, no BAC, and sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 88 days suspended, his
driver’s license was restricted for one year, he was ordered to have an ignition interlock
device installed on his car for six to 12 months and to attend an ASAP program, and he
was  fined  $500.  The  latter  charge  was  nolle  prossed.  He  attended  and  successfully
completed an ASAP program in August 2014. He did not believe he underwent an alcohol
evaluation  at  this  time.  His  driver’s  license  was  reinstated  after  one  year  without
restriction. (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.f, 2.h; Tr. at 31-38, 89-101, 148-149; GE 1, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant consumed around three to four, 12-ounce beers earlier that day while he
was replacing  a  broken  headlight  on  his brother’s car.  Later that evening, after he had
slept for around three to four hours, he drove his brother’s car to the home of his then-
girlfriend, now fiancée. A police officer pulled him over for disobeying a traffic signal. In
response to the officer’s questioning, he admitted to consuming alcohol earlier in the day.
The officer administered a breathalyzer and conducted a search of the car, and the officer
found a butter knife in the center console. Applicant was unaware there was a knife in the
car, and he believed it belonged to his brother who owned the car. He acknowledged that
he should not have consumed alcohol when he knew he had to later drive, but at the time
he stated that he did not think he was intoxicated because he had slept  after he drank
and before he drove. (Tr. at 31-38, 89-101; GE 1, 3, 4, 5)
In  August  2015,  at  age  26,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DWI,  2nd
offense  within  five  years,  and  refusal  of  blood  or  breath  test,  2nd  offense,  both
misdemeanors.  Both  charges  were  nolle  prossed.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  2.h)  He  denied
consuming alcohol before this incident. He stated that his day was an early and  a long
one, as he drove his mother two and a half hours to see his brother, and then he drove
her back to her home where he hung out with her before driving to visit a friend who lived
near his apartment. He testified that as he was driving home:
It  was pretty  late  at  night.  I  don’t remember the  exact time.  But I  was driving,
and I fell  asleep. And  when I woke up  –  like I dozed off for a second. When
I  woke   up,  I  was  doing   probably  like   45   miles  an   hour  on   [the   highway].
Woke  up, and  at the  last minute, tried  to  correct the  steering  wheel because
there   was  like   a   concrete   barrier  on   the   side.  They   were   doing,  like,
construction. And  so  when  I did that, the  car swerved  back and  forth  and  it
hit the  concrete  barrier. The  airbag deployed.  I hit my head on  the  steering
wheel. I wasn’t wearing  a  seatbelt at the time. So  when  the  officers arrived
on  the  scene,  I was, like, leaning  on  the  car,  you  know, still  in  a  daze  from
smacking   my  head   and   having   the   airbags  flow  in  my  face.  The   officers
never asked  me  did  I need  any aid or anything. It  was just  more  so, Have
you been drinking?  Like, no.  Okay.  Do you  mind  taking  a  sobriety test?  I’m
like, I’m   not   going  to   take  one   because   you  all   didn’t  offer me  any aid.  At
that point, I was . . . arrested  and  taken  to  jail. (Tr. at 38-41, 106-112; GE  3,

In   March  2017,  at  age   27,  Applicant   was  arrested   and   charged   with   DWI,   2nd
offense  within five  years, and  refusal of breath  test,  2nd  offense, both  misdemeanors. He
pled  guilty to  the  reduced  charge  of misdemeanor reckless driving, and  he  was sentenced
to 90  days in jail, suspended, placed  on unsupervised probation, his driver’s license was
restricted  for six months, and  he  was  fined. The  latter charge  was nolle  prossed.  (SOR
¶¶  1.b, 2.h)  He consumed  around  four to  six  12-ounce  beers at a  party at a  friend’s house.
He decided  to  try to  “sleep  it off” in his car, which he  acknowledged  was “probably not the
best  idea,”   but  his  intention   was  to   leave   the   party,   otherwise  he   likely  would  have
continued   drinking.   He   left  his  keys  in  his  ignition   after   rolling   down   a   window,  but  his
engine  was  off.  He woke  up  when  a  police  officer tapped  on  his door  and  asked  if  he  had
been  drinking, to  which  he  acknowledged  that he  had.  (Tr. at 41-43, 112-115; GE  3, 4, 5)
In   September  2019,   at   age   30,   Applicant  was   charged   and   convicted   of
misdemeanor public swearing/intoxication, and  he  was fined  $50. (SOR ¶¶  1.a, 2.h) He
drank around  three  to  four 12-ounce  beers at  home  and  was  smoking  cigarettes on  the
steps  in  front  of  his  home   when   police   officers,  who   were   walking   through   the
neighborhood,  approached   and   told   him   they  had   received   a   noise   disturbance.  The
officers, who  recognized  him  from  an  incident that  occurred  in  July 2019,  as  discussed
below, “made  a  comment about [the  July 2019  incident],  to  which  I got kind  of,  you  know,
mouthy  with  them  after  that.” The  officers then  “came  up  on  the  steps and  said  that  they
smelled   alcohol.”  After  he   told  the   officers,  “Hey,   you   know,  I’m   on   my  property,  not
bothering  anybody,  not  doing  anything;  you  all came  up  messing  with  me, pretty  much,”
the  officers arrested  him.  He  stated  that  the  police  officer  who  showed  up  to  court told
him that it would only be a civil penalty and not a criminal charge, so he did not fight it
and  paid  the  fine.  He  stated  that  he  should  not  have  listened  to  that  officer.  He
acknowledged that he should have been smart when the police officers approached him
that day and either gone into his house or listened to what they had to say and tried to
diffuse the situation. (Tr. at 43-47, 69-75, 137-141; GE 1, 6)
In February 2022, at age 32, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI, 2nd
offense within five to ten years, and DWI, refusal of breath test, 2nd offense within ten
years. (SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 2.h) In December 2022, he was convicted of the amended charge of
misdemeanor reckless driving and sentenced  to 30 days  in jail, suspended,  placed on
one year of unsupervised probation, his driver’s license was restricted for six months, he
was ordered to attend a week-long ASAP program and an outpatient program, and he
was fined $250. The latter charge was nolle prossed. (Tr.at 47-52, 141-162; GE 7, 8, 9)
Earlier  that  day,  Applicant  consumed  around  two  to  four  12-ounce  beers.  That
night, he moved his car within his neighborhood to a better parking spot, and when he
got out of his car to see how close he was to the curb, he did not notice that it was still in
reverse, and it rolled back and hit the car behind it. The owner of that car witnessed the
incident and contacted the police. The officer that arrived asked Applicant if he had been
drinking,  and  he  responded  affirmatively.  When  the  officer  asked  Applicant  to  do  a
sobriety  test,  he  refused  because  he  was  not  in  the  car  when  the  officer  arrived.  He
acknowledged at the hearing that he should not have operated his car after he had been
consuming  alcohol,  even  if  it  was  to  move  his  car  to  a  better  parking  spot  in  his
neighborhood. (Tr. at 47-52, 141-162)
Applicant stated that he last consumed alcohol in December 2022. Up until then,
he had been consuming approximately four 12-ounce beers once or twice weekly. As of
the date of the hearing and since December 2022, his driver’s license was still restricted,
he  was  still on probation,  and he  was  in a  19-week  outpatient  alcohol  program,  which
required  him  to  remain  sober  and  attend  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings  twice
weekly. He paid the court-ordered fine in March 2023, and at a date not in the record, he
completed the court-ordered ASAP program. He intended to successfully complete the
19-week outpatient program. He stated that he has not received any other alcohol-related
treatment and he has never received an alcohol-related diagnosis. Although he does not
believe he has an alcohol problem, he stated that  he intends to remain sober, and his
family and friends are supportive of his decision. When asked whether he was choosing
to abstain from alcohol because he wanted to do so or because the outpatient program
required it, he responded:
I’m  doing  it  for, I would  say, both. I kind  of want to, you  know, start  making
better decisions, you  know. I had  plenty of chances, you  know, but  I think
that,  you  know,  now that this  being  the fifth time,  you  know -- or I think that
I just, you  know, just  tired  of,  you  know, making  poor decisions. (Tr.  at 51-
58, 141-162)
In  addition  to  his  alcohol-related  incidents,  Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal
involvement.  In  May  2010,  he  was  charged  and  convicted  of  reckless  driving,
endangering life, limb, and property. He was fined. He was first at a traffic light with other
cars to the side of him, and he intentionally accelerated his car to burn the rubber on his
tires when the light turned green. The police officer who pulled Applicant over told him
that he could smell the rubber from his car tires, and the officer gave him a summons to
appear in court. (SOR ¶ 2.g; Tr. at 58-60, 81-83; GE 4, 5)
In  October  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  assault  on  a  family
member,  and  he  was  found  not  guilty  in  January  2015.  (SOR  ¶  2.e)  He  and  his  then-
girlfriend, now fiancée, got into an argument. As he tried to leave through the front door,
she stood in front of it and continued to yell at him. He asked her to move, she refused,
and he “pushed her out of the way.” He spent the night at his mother’s house. His then-
girlfriend,  now  fiancée,  contacted  the  police.  The  next  day,  he  turned  himself  into  the
police  after  learning  from  his  brother,  who  was  informed  by  his  then-girlfriend,  now
fiancée,  that  there  was  a  warrant  out  for  his  arrest.  He  was  released  on  his  own
recognizance on the condition that he appear at the court date, and a “no contact” order
was issued. She testified at court that she did not recall what happened that night. (Tr. at
60-64, 101-106; GE 3)
In  January  2019,  Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  assault  on  a  family
member, and the charge was nolle prossed. (SOR ¶ 2.d) He and his then-girlfriend, now
fiancée, got into another argument and “I got really mad and I punched the glass picture
frame that was on the wall and punched a hole in the wall.” He cut his hand as a result.
She  contacted  the  police,  he  was  arrested,  taken  to  jail,  released  on  his  own
recognizance,  and  a  no  contact  order  was  issued.  She  failed  to  appear  at  court.  He
understood that he dealt with his frustration and anger, in 2014 and 2019, inappropriately.
He attended and completed an anger management class in December 2021 and learned
methods  such  as  “try  not  to  argue  back,  don’t  take  an  aggressive  tone,  and  separate
myself from the situation,” that he intends to utilize in the future. (Tr. at 64-68, 115-120;

In  April  2019,  Applicant  was  charged  and  convicted  of  misdemeanor  reckless
speeding for driving 103 miles per hour (mph) in a 65-mph zone. He was sentenced to

(SOR ¶ 2.c) He was driving home at night after spending the day with his brothers, and
he was speeding, because he was “just tired, just trying to get home.” He did not realize
how fast he was driving. The state trooper who pulled him over asked him if he had been
drinking, which he denied, and the trooper gave him a summons to appear in court. (Tr.

In  July  2019,  Applicant  was  charged  with  misdemeanor  violation  of  a  fire
prevention code, and the charge was dismissed in March 2021. (SOR ¶ 2.b) He drank
around three beers and then began working on his car that had been giving him problems.
As  he  attempted  to  trigger  his  car’s  check  engine  light  to  determine  the  source  of  the
problem, he “revved the gas on the car continuously. And then eventually the car caught
on fire.” He did not realize the car was on fire until he saw smoke, and  when he got out
of the car to try to extinguish the fire, he sustained second-degree burns to two toes on
his right foot. A neighbor contacted the fire department when Applicant could not, because
his phone and personal belongings were still inside the car. The firefighters extinguished
the fire, he was transported to the hospital and released the same night, and a fire marshal
charged him with violation of a fire prevention code the next day. (Tr. at 72-75, 124-132;

and  the  trooper gave  him  a  summons to  appear in court. He completed  a  mandated  driver
improvement  class,  and  he  understood  that  speed  limits  exist  to  protect him  and  others
on  the  road  and  he  does not intend  to  speed  in the  future.  (Tr. at  75-78,  132-137, 157-

At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that “I made some poor decisions and put
myself in some bad situations.” He stated that he has matured and “I’m hoping to show
the court that I’ve learned and grown from my prior actions and prove that it won’t happen
again.”  He  completed  106  hours  of  community  service  in  November  2020.  He  did  not
begin to receive annual security training until he started working for his current employer
in  January  2021.  Since  receiving  such  training,  he  is  aware  that  holding  a  security
clearance  requires  him  to  abide  by  the  laws,  comply  with  rules  and  regulations,  and
exercise  good  judgment  in  his  decision-making.  He  is  also  aware  of  the  reporting

Applicant  served   in   the   United   States   Air   Force  from   March   2010   to   November
2020   and   was  discharged   under  other  than   honorable  conditions.   He   was   a   highly
qualified  airman  and  attained  the  rank of staff sergeant  (E-5). He  deployed  many  times
and  had  extensive  combat experience. He  was awarded  numerous medals,  awards  and
decorations including  the  Distinguished  Flying  Cross and  multiple  Air  Medals. He received
favorable   performance   evaluations,  and   successfully  completed   extensive  military
training and education. He  served honorably during his initial term  of service  from March
2010  to  July 2017. He  has held  a  security clearance  since  2010. (Answer; AE A, G at 35-
38, 63-80; Tr. 29-34, 40)
In October 2019, Applicant was charged with one sexual act and one attempted
sexual act upon a female airman, unlawful entry, and indecent exposure in violation of
Articles 80, 120, 120c, and 129 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Those
charges were referred for trial by General Court-Martial in November 2019. On May 6,
2020,  he  entered  pleas  of  not  guilty  to  all  charges.  In  October  2020,  he  requested  a
“Discharge in Lieu of Trial by Court-Martial” pursuant to Air Force regulations. His request
was  approved in  November 2020,  and he was  discharged  under other than honorable
conditions. (Answer; AE G at 3-7, 10-17, 32-112; GE 1-3)
Sexual Behavior, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges and cross-alleges sexual misconduct by Applicant (SOR ¶¶ 1.a,
1.b,  2.a,  and  3.a)  and  that  he  was  discharged  from  the  Air  Force  under  other  than
honorable conditions in lieu of trial by court-martial (SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 3.a). In his answer
to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.b  and  denied  all  other
allegations with explanation. His admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact.
In April 2019, a complaining witness (CW1) told investigators that Applicant had
grabbed  her  waist  and  attempted  to  kiss  her  without  her  consent  in  about  June  2018.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 3.a) She stated the following. While socializing at a bar with members
of her new unit she met Applicant. When she went outside to smoke, Applicant followed
her.  He  asked  to  kiss  her,  and  she  replied,  “no,  we  work  together”  and  “no.”  He  then
“grabbed [her] around her waist and attempted to kiss her.” (AE H; GE 2 at 2) She put her
hands on his chest, pushed him away and he went back into the bar. She saw Applicant
around the squadron afterward but “[he] avoided her at all costs.” (AE H) She disclosed
this  incident  and  incidents  with  two  other  males  in  her  unit  to  her  supervisor  while
discussing reasons she wanted a transfer. (GE 2 at 2; AE H) After the hearing, Applicant
submitted a more detailed summary of CW1’s statement to  investigators reflecting  that
she  had  not  intended  to  report  the  incidents  with  Applicant  and  the  two  other  male
squadron  members,  and  only  wanted  to  better  inform  her  supervisor  why  she  thought
changing platforms was the right decision for her. (AE H)
Applicant  denied  that  he  groped  CW1,  grabbed  her  around  the  waist,  asked  or
attempted to kiss her, and did not recall any inappropriate physical contact or that CW1
pushed him. (Answer: AE G at 10-12; Tr. 35, 55-56) He said it was “possible” that they
hugged at the end of the evening in a show of friendship but did not  specifically recall
doing so. (Tr. 56) He confirmed that he first met CW1 on the evening in question. (Tr. 35,
48-49, 51, 111) He said that they were out with a group of friends but were “pretty much
just conversing amongst ourselves, talking, chatting, as well as like, the group was with
us but we were more chatting amongst ourselves.” (Tr. 35, 53) He did not recall how many
drinks he consumed that evening but said he had been socially drinking over a period of
several hours and probably drank several beers, and one or two cocktails. (Tr. 51-53) He
testified  that  when  CW1  went  outside  to  smoke  he  followed  her  because  “[he]  figured
we’d continue our conversation and also so she wouldn’t have to be standing out there
by herself.” (Tr. 54) He testified that they went back inside the bar together, rejoined their
colleagues, and went their separate ways at the end of the evening. (Tr. 35, 56-57) He
said that he and CW2 were in the same squadron for 10 months after the alleged incident
without tension between them, and that they  “had  different duties  in the  plane, but I’m
sure we flew together, deployed together and so on.” (Tr. 57) He did not recall any social
interaction with her after the June 2018 evening in the bar. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant  challenged  the  veracity  of  CW1’s  allegations,  noting  that  she  waited
more than nine months to report the alleged incident and did so in support of her request
to  be  reassigned.  (AE  G  at  10-12;  Tr.  34-35,  55-56)  He  said  that  she  also  made
uncorroborated allegations that an airman texted her an unsolicited picture of his genitalia
and  that  another airman  inappropriately  touched  her  buttocks.  (AE  G  at  11,  101-103;  Tr.
128-129) He submitted  a  November 2021  letter from  Technical Sergeant  (TSgt) H, who
had  served  with  Applicant from  2015  to  2020  and  had  been  his roommate  from  late  2016
to  early 2020. TSgt H wrote  that  “I am  aware  of  the  allegations made  against  [Applicant]
and  I believe  them  to  be  false in nature. I believe  [Applicant]  fell  victim  to  someone  who
accused  multiple  other people  of similar allegations and  that [Applicant]  told the  whole
truth  during his testimonies.” (Answer at Ex. 9; AE  G at 91-92; Tr. 35) Applicant said that
he was not questioned by investigators about CW1’s allegations against him. (Tr. 58-63)
CW1’s  allegations   were  investigated   but  were  not   included   in   the   charges   preferred
against Applicant in October 2019  and  later referred  to  general court-martial. (AE  G  at
101-103; GE  2 at 1; Tr. 128-129)
In May 2019, investigators interviewed CW2, and she said that Applicant groped
and sexually assaulted her on March 1, 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.a, 3.a) She provided the
following account to investigators. Applicant asked if he could stay at her residence after
a night out and she agreed. While in a taxi enroute to her residence she vomited. She fell
while exiting the vehicle at her residence, scraped her arm and dirtied her clothes. She
went to take a shower, and while removing her clothes, Applicant entered the bathroom
naked, grabbed her, and tried to pull her close. CW2 told him to stop, he then grabbed
her buttocks, pushed her close to a counter and tried to kiss her, while fondling and kissing
her breasts. She repeatedly told him to “stop” and “no” to which he replied, “[y]ou know
you want [to engage in sexual activity with me].” CW2’s roommate [Roommate] came out
of her room, encountered CW2 and Applicant, told him to leave and then escorted him
out of the residence. Applicant then repeatedly knocked on the door, rang the doorbell
and asked to come in to apologize. (GE 2 at 2)
Roommate’s statement to investigators is summarized as follows. In about March
2019 she saw an intoxicated CW2 leaning on a male later identified as Applicant at the
residence she shared with CW2. She then helped CW2 to the shower. CW2 told her that
“I don’t want [Applicant] here, we need to make him leave.” Roommate thanked Applicant
and asked him to leave, but he swiftly walked into the bathroom occupied by CW2 and
locked  the  door.  Roommate  heard  CW2  say,  “Hey  I’m  naked,  you  need  to  get  out.”
Seconds later the bathroom door opened, and Roommate saw CW2 attempting to cover
her naked body with a towel. Applicant ran out of the bathroom nude, covering his penis
with his hands, and then hid behind a Christmas tree. CW2 appeared sick and ran into
the  bathroom  to  vomit.  Applicant  swiftly  followed  her  and  locked  the  door.  Roommate
heard CW2 say, “I’m throwing up, don’t touch me. Go home.” Roommate then escorted
Applicant from the bathroom and outside the residence. CW2 later told Roommate that
“she never felt so close  [to] being raped,” and that Applicant had picked her up, placed
her on the counter, and attempted to perform oral sex on her. (GE 2 at 2)
Applicant  denied  any nonconsensual sexual behavior  with  CW2. He  specifically
denied groping CW2, grabbing her buttocks, fondling or kissing her breasts, attempting
to  perform  oral  sex  on  her,  telling  her  that  “[y]ou  know  you  want  [to  engage  in  sexual
activity with me].  He also testified that CW2’s statement to investigators was untruthful.
(Answer; Tr. 76-78, 83-84)
Applicant recounted the evening as follows. He and CW2 attended a colleague’s
promotion party and after several hours of drinking she asked him to stay the night at her
residence. (Answer; AE G at 105; Tr. 36, 66-68) He explained that he and CW2 had been
close friends since their deployment, that their relationship had been platonic prior to that
evening, and that he sometimes slept on her couch. (Tr. 36, 68-69) While in a taxi on the
way to CW2’s residence, the driver was concerned that CW2 might vomit, so the driver
stopped the vehicle and CW2 got out to vomit. Applicant did not recall seeing CW2 vomit
but because of concern for her safety, he exited the vehicle, helped her move away from
traffic, and watched for approaching vehicles. (Tr. 70-72, 117)
Applicant said that “[CW2] kind of stumbled [while exiting the taxi at her residence]
and I caught her . . . to prevent her from hitting her head or whatever . . .  I believe she
hit her knee or elbow or something like that, but nothing too severe.” (Tr. 72) He recounted
events at CW2’s residence as follows. She went to the bathroom alone after they entered
her residence. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 73, 80) He met and spoke with Roommate for
several minutes and decided to go home. (Tr. 78-80, 117) When he went to say goodbye
to CW2, she opened the door naked and “invited [him] inside the bathroom [and] to join
her in  a  shower”. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 37, 78-81, 83) They then mutually kissed,
and she helped him undress. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 75-77, 80-81, 83) CW2 suggested
that  they  go  to  her bedroom  because  she  did  not  want  Roommate  to  hear  them  or to
judge her for engaging in sexual activity after her recent breakup. (Answer; AE G at 106;
Tr. 78-79) While naked and on their way to CW2’s bedroom they encountered Roommate,
who scolded them both about their behavior, so he and CW2 returned to the bathroom to
get their clothes. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 36-40, 82-83) Roommate told him it was a
good idea to leave, and he agreed because CW2 “was sick and obviously drunk”. (Tr. 81-
82, 85, 120-121) He denied that Roommate told him to leave or forced him to leave. (Tr.
81-82)
After Applicant left  CW2’s residence, he  and CW2 exchanged the following text
messages.
Applicant:  Hey, your roommate said you wanted me out. I just wanted to
speak to you before tomorrow – I get that we were drunk and [stuff] but hope
you [contact me] tomorrow.
CW2: I was in the shower! Did you [taxi] home ok?
Applicant:  Yea – Sorry for being so forward – I was in the wrong and should
of recognized it – Hope if there’s any hard feelings we can chat tomorrow
or just brush it off as a drunk night
CW2: Dude we were both ducked (sic). Up lol. Make it home ok?
(AE G at 111)
Applicant explained that he sent the apologetic text because he didn’t want their
kissing and disrobing to negatively affect their friendship or  relationship at work. “And I
apologized in regards to kissing her as we were both colleagues and friends and I didn’t
want her to ruin things and be enemies. And since of her being a colleague I didn’t want
her to feel awkward in the future at work.” (Tr. 38) He also said that “[w]e were both drunk
and both decided to make a bad choice or maybe a choice that we might have regretted
as in affecting our friendship and such.” (Tr. 123) He thought that she had accepted his
explanation  based  upon  her  communications  that  night  and  later  that  weekend,  and
subsequent social interaction. (Tr. 38-39, 86-87, 122) Evidence of their social interaction
after the alleged misconduct included a photograph from about April 2019 that showed
19 people standing together in a social setting, eight of whom were positioned between
Applicant and CW2. (Answer; AE G at 113; Tr. 90-91, 114-116)
Applicant said that he did not know why CW2 or Roommate would lie about what
happened that night. (Tr. 77, 104) He claimed that CW2 and her boyfriend had broken up
less  than  a  week  earlier  and  believed  they  got  back  together  after  she  made  the
allegations against him. (Answer; AE G at 105; Tr. 91, 123-125) He said that there were
inconsistencies  between  CW2’s  and  Roommate’s  statements  reflected  in  other
documents  associated  with  the  court-martial  charges  but  did  not  specify  what  the
discrepancies were or submit corroborating documentary evidence. (Tr. 83-84) Applicant
did  not  provide  a  statement  to  investigators  or  any  testimony  regarding  CW2  or  her
allegations during the court-martial proceedings. (Tr. 84-85, 92-93)
Applicant estimated that he drank four to eight beers that evening. (Tr. 118-119)
He said that he felt the effects of the alcohol but “had full memory of the night [and] felt in
control of his faculties”. (Tr. 119-120) He saw CW2 drinking beer and shots but said she
“seemed coherent enough”, “was able to talk socially and interact”, “order [a taxi] on her
phone without any issues”, “was slightly drunk [but he] didn’t see anything abnormal or
different about it,” and that she was more drunk than him. (Tr. 69, 121)
Applicant admitted that he was discharged from the Air Force under Other Than
Honorable  Conditions  in  November  2020,  in  lieu  of  trial  by  court-martial  for  charges
preferred as a result of misconduct alleged in SOR ¶ 1.  (SOR ¶ 2.b, cross-alleged under
SOR  ¶  3.a)  In October 2019,  he  was  charged  with  one  sexual act  and  one  attempted
sexual  act  upon  CW2,  unlawful  entry  into  CW2’s  bathroom,  and  indecently  exposing
himself to CW2 and her Roommate in violation of Articles 80, 120, 120c, and 129, UCMJ.
Those  charges  were  referred  for trial  by  General  Court-Martial  in November 2019.  On
October  1,  2020,  Applicant  requested  a  Discharge  in  Lieu  of  Trial  by  Court-Martial
pursuant  to  Air  Force  Instruction  36-3208,  Chapter  4.  (AE  G  at  112)  His  request  was
submitted  after  consultation  with  his  military  and  civilian  attorneys  and  included
acknowledgments that he: (1) understood the elements of the offenses with which he was
charged; (2) had received a copy of the investigation; (3) was aware that his voluntary
request could result in an “other than honorable discharge,” and (4) that he was advised
of the “possible effects of discharge under these circumstances.” (Answer at Exhibit 29;
AE  G  at  112;  Tr.  94-95,  125-127)  His  request  did  not  include  an admission  of  guilt  or
statements of fact regarding the allegations or statements of CW2, Roommate or CW1.
(Answer at Exhibit 29; AE G at 112; Tr. 94-95) His request was approved by an Air Force
lieutenant general in November 2020 after consideration of supporting documents, and
the  recommendations  of  a  staff  judge  advocate  and  subordinate  commanders.  He
directed Applicant’s discharge be “Under Other than Honorable Conditions.” (Answer at
13-14; AE G at 37, 112; GE 3; Tr. 32)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  a  court-martial  conviction  could  have  resulted  in
imprisonment  and  a  punitive  discharge,  and  a  requirement  that  he  register  as  a  sex
offender.  He  testified  that  an  administrative  discharge  enabled  him  to  maintain  some
veteran’s benefits based upon his previous period of honorable service. He said that he
felt  confident  that  he  would  have  been  acquitted  had  the  case  proceeded  to  trial,  but
decided “the risk was not worth the reward[.]” (Answer; AE G at 36-37, 101-104, 112; Tr.
32, 39-40, 93-94, 101-103)
Alcohol Use
Applicant  acknowledged  that  “[b]oth  incidents  of  alleged  misconduct  revolved
around  alcohol,”  and  said  that  he  has  made  a  point  to  separate  himself  from  similar
situations and has surrounded himself with people that have his best interests in mind to
avoid future issues. (Tr. 129-131, 142-144) He said that prior to the allegations he would
drink about 10 beers, once or twice a week in part because of a culture of “socialization
through intoxication” viewed as critical to bonding with others in his unit, particularly those
with  shared  combat  experience.  (Tr.  43,  129-133)  He  has  significantly  modified  his
behavior  since  the  allegations  were  made.  He  abstained  from  drinking  alcoholic
beverages for approximately six months and has more recently consumed alcohol about
twice a month – usually five to six beers over a period of several hours. (Tr. 134-136) He
has not been referred for and has not sought or received counseling or treatment for his
alcohol use. (Tr. 129-131)
Character Evidence  and Credibility
Applicant  submitted  numerous
letters  of  recommendation  and  character
references from commissioned officers, non-commissioned officers and others including
his current supervisor, colleagues, friends, and neighbors that favorably commented on
his  honesty,  integrity,  trustworthiness,  judgment,  patriotism,  dependability,  work  ethic,
professionalism,  leadership,  handling  of  classified  information,  adherence  to  rules  and
regulations,  commitment  to  U.S.  national  security  and  his  mission,  and  superior
performance  in  combat  that  saved  lives  of  friendly  forces.  Many  of  the  letters  directly
recommend  or  support  approval  of  his  continued  access  to  classified  information.
(Answer; AE B-F, G at 87-100)
",False
"Applicant, age 33, is an employee of a Department of Defense contractor seeking
to  maintain  his  security  clearance.  He  has  worked  for  various  DoD  contractors  at  an
overseas location since 2015. He served on active duty in the United States Army from
2007  to  2010,  separating  with  a  general  under  honorable  conditions  discharge.  He  is
divorced and has no children. (GE 1-2; Tr. 11, 17-18, 26)
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement
Applicant admitted using marijuana with varying frequency from October 2009 to
January 2010. (SOR  ¶ 1.a,  Response  to  SOR) He  also admitted using marijuana  with
varying frequency from July 2014 to February 2021. (SOR ¶ 1.b, Response to SOR) In
April  2010,  he  was  discharged  from  the  U.S.  Army  with  a  discharge  characterized  as
general under honorable conditions due to a positive urinalysis for THC, and marijuana
use. (SOR ¶ 1.c: GE 9)
After his discharge from active duty, Applicant was arrested on three occasions
and charged with drug-related offenses to include:
SOR  ¶   1.d:   February  2015  arrest  for  Use/Possession  Drug  Paraphernalia;
Use/Possession Marijuana. Applicant failed to appear in court and a warrant was issued.
The case was nolle prossed, with prejudice in May 2018. (GE 3);
SOR  ¶   1.e:  June  2015  arrest  for  Illegal  Possession  of  Prescription  Drugs  and
Possession of Marijuana, Second Degree. He failed to appear in court and a warrant was
issued for his arrest. (GE 2 at 18; GE 5); and
SOR ¶  1.f:  May 2018 arrest for Possession of Marijuana Second Degree and Open
Container in a Vehicle. He failed to appear in court and a warrant was issued for his arrest.
(GE 2 at 19-20; GE 6)
During the hearing, Applicant testified that he first used marijuana at age 12. It was
a one-time experimental use. He did not use marijuana again until he was deployed to
Iraq in 2009. He was deployed to Iraq from approximately July 2008 to October 2009.
Although Applicant admitted the use of alcohol and marijuana was prohibited in Iraq by a
General Order, several of his fellow soldiers were drinking alcohol to blow off steam.  He
was a driver and decided it was better to use marijuana instead of alcohol even though
he was aware marijuana use was prohibited.  He estimated he used marijuana at least
once a month while deployed. (Tr. 18-19, 70-71)
Upon his return from deployment, Applicant continued to use marijuana while on
active  duty.  He  smoked  marijuana  in  social  settings,  at  parties,  and  in  the  park.  He
estimated  his  level  of  use  was  on  a  weekly to  monthly  basis.  In  early  2010,  Applicant
smoked marijuana with a fellow soldier at a party in the barracks. Soon after, his unit was
called for a random urinalysis. He and his friend both tested positive for THC, a derivative
of marijuana and both were eventually discharged from active duty. In February 2010, he
was  ordered  to  attend  ASAP  (a  drug  counseling  course  the  Army  provided),  but  was
separated from active duty before its completion.  (GE 2 at 15. Tr. 19-20)
After  his  separation  from  active  duty,  Applicant  did  not  use  marijuana  until  July
2014. He smoked marijuana on a monthly basis until February 2021. He stopped using
marijuana when he applied for his current job because he did not want to fail the drug
test. Between 2015 to 2021, Applicant worked for several DoD contractors. He was asked
whether he recalls signing a drug policy document with each employer which states that
illegal  drug  use  is  prohibited.  Subject  told  the  background  investigator  conducting  his
security  clearance  investigation  that  he  knew  marijuana  use  was  against  policy,  but
thought  his  use  was  not  hurting  anything  since  he  never  used  marijuana  at  work.  He
stopped using marijuana in hopes of being granted a security clearance. He claims he is
not dependent on marijuana and is able to stop using it. He testified during the hearing
that  the  last  time  he  used  marijuana  was  in  November  2022.  I  am  going  to  use  the
November 2022 date as the last time he used marijuana. (Tr. 22-25, 74; GE 2 at 16)
Applicant admits that he was arrested in February 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.e) but was not
sure what the charges were. He claims the police were looking for his brother. His brother
was  not home,  so Applicant  was arrested  because  the  police  discovered grinders and
papers. Applicant denies that he possessed marijuana. He did not appear in court. He
returned overseas to work. He claims that he was not aware of the outstanding charges
until he came home on vacation and was arrested for having open arrest warrants. (Tr.
26 -30; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  admits  he  was  arrested  in  June  2015,  but  denies  that  he  possessed
marijuana or illegally possessed prescription drugs. (SOR ¶ 1.e) He was driving with Mr.
M, a close friend. The car he was driving belonged to  his mother’s friend. A police car
drove in the opposite direction and noticed Applicant was driving without a seat belt.  As
Applicant pulled into the driveway of Mr. M’s house, the police approached their car.  A
subsequent search of the car revealed prescription pills.  He does not recall marijuana
being found in the car. He and his friend were arrested, booked, and spent 24 hours in
jail. He posted bond. He was given a court date, but went back overseas to work before
the court date. He failed to appear and a warrant was issued for his arrest. (Tr. 32, GE 2
at 18-19; Answer to SOR; GE 5)
Finally, Applicant admits he was arrested in May 2018 but was not sure where the
marijuana charges came from. (SOR ¶ 1.f) He was home on leave to attend his sister’s
graduation. He had several open bottles of alcohol in the car which were left over from
the graduation celebration. He was driving back from the celebration. A woman who he
had  just  met  on-line  was  in  the  car  with  him.  He  believes  she  may  have  possessed
marijuana. He denies possessing marijuana. Five minutes after he picked up the woman,
the police pulled him over and he was arrested for Open Container and Possession of
Marijuana, Second Degree. The police discovered Applicant had open warrants in several
jurisdictions. The police report indicates Applicant was searched after they discovered he
had outstanding warrants. A bundle of U.S. currency and a plastic baggie containing a
green leafy substance believed to be marijuana was found in Applicant’s right front pocket
of his shorts. (Gov 6 at 2) Applicant ended up spending four nights in jail in four different
jurisdictions in order to answer the outstanding warrants. After he was released, Applicant
returned to his overseas residence.  He did not appear at his court date and a warrant
was issued for his arrest. (Tr. 45 – 52; GE 2 at 19-20; GE 6; Answer to SOR)
Applicant returned  to  the  U.S. in  November 2020, to  spend  Thanksgiving  with  his
family. He  did  not attempt  to  resolve his open  warrants when  he  was  home. His mother
told him not to worry about it because it had  no effect on  his job or life overseas. (Tr. 54-
56; Gov 2  at 20) During  the  hearing, Applicant testified  the  last time  he  visited  the  U.S.
was May 2022. The  warrants remain outstanding. He  indicated he plans to  hire a  lawyer
to solve these issues at some point in the future. (Tr. 15, 43;  GE  4; GE 10)

qualifying  charges, conviction  or sentences in  any Federal, state, local, military, or non
U.S. court, even  if previously listed  on  this form) –  In  the  last seven  years have  you  been
or  are   you   currently  on   probation   or  parole?   –   Are  you   currently   on   trial  or  awaiting   a
criminal trial on  criminal charges?” Applicant  answered, “No” and  deliberately did not  list
his arrests alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d  and 1.e. (SOR ¶ 3.b” GE  1, Section 22, at 37)
Applicant is also alleged to have intentionally falsified his June 30, 2021, security
clearance  application  in  response  to  “Section  22  –  Police  Record  (EVER)  Other  than
those offenses already listed, have you EVER had the following happen to you . . . Have
you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?” when he answered,
“No.”  He deliberately did not list the offenses listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e and 1.f. (SOR ¶
3.c: GE 1, Section 22, at 37-38)
Finally,  Applicant  is  alleged  to  have  intentionally  falsified  his  June  30,  2021,
security clearance application in response to “Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug
Activity.  In  the  last  seven  years,  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled
substances?  Use of a  drug  or controlled  substance  includes injecting, snorting,  inhaling,
swallowing,  experimenting   with   or   otherwise   consuming   any  drug   or  controlled
substance?”  when he answered  “No.”  He  deliberately failed  to  disclose his illegal use of
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  between  July 2014  to  February 2021.  (SOR ¶  3.d:  GE
1, Section  23, at 38)
In his response to the SOR, Applicant denies the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 3.a – 3.d.
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  having  problems  with  the  e-QIP
program.  He claims he tried to put the correct information into the e-QIP, but the program
would not allow it. He states he never tried to hide his marijuana use. (Tr. 57-61)  During
his background investigation interview, Applicant told the investigator that he did not list
these  events on  his case  papers because  he  thought  they  would  reflect  negatively on
him. (GE 2 at 20)
Whole-Person Factors
Applicant provided  several character references attesting to his good character.
Mr. R., Applicant’s direct supervisor, has worked with Applicant over the past two years.
They no longer work on the same team, but he describes him as “a trustworthy, motivated,
and  hard-working  young  man.”  (AE  A  at  1)  Ms.  N.B.  is  Applicant’s  close  friend  and
neighbor.  She  has  known  Applicant  for  the  past  14  years.  She  states  Applicant  has
consistently  shown  a  commitment  to  “integrity,  leadership,  altruism,  trustworthiness,
reliability, accountability, and hard work, as well as being a great friend that always has
an open ear to listen.” (AE A at 2-4) Applicant’s sister, a former co-worker, and a friend
who served with him on active duty also provided favorable letters attesting to his good
character.  (AE  A  at  5  –  7)  Applicant  also  received  a  certificate  of  appreciation  for  his
support of the Army’s mission. (AE A at 8)
",False
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
1.d, 1.f, and 1.i. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h. He did not admit or
deny  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  2,a,  and  2.b  as  amended.  His  admissions  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  married  in
February 1988, separated in January 2017, divorced in August 2017, and remarried in
August 2020. (GX 12 at 4; Tr. 87) He has two adult children. He received  a bachelor’s
degree in mechanical engineering in August 1994 and a master’s degree in engineering
management in May 2002. He has worked for defense contractors since April 2009.
Applicant enlisted in the Navy in November 1987, was an honor graduate of  his
initial  training  classes,  received  outstanding  performance  evaluations  and  numerous
commendations,  and  was  selected  for  the  enlisted  commissioning  program.  He
completed the Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps and was commissioned as an ensign.
His  fitness  reports  through  October  2006  were  uniformly  outstanding  and  included
recommendations for promotion to commander and assignment as an executive officer
afloat. (AX C(1) through AX C(80)). He received the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement
Medal three times, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal three times, and
the Meritorious Service Medal upon retirement as a lieutenant commander in December
2007.
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  admitted  on  cross-examination  that  in  2005,  he  was
accused  of  fraternization,  making  a  false  official  statement,  and  adultery,  and  that  he
accepted a captain’s mast for those offenses. He admitted that he was found guilty and
received a letter of reprimand and forfeiture of pay, and he was removed from the ship.
(Tr.  205-06)  The  record  contains  no  documentary  evidence  of  this  action,  his  fitness
reports  for  that  period  do  not  mention  it,  and  it  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  I  have
considered  it for the  limited  purpose  of rebutting  Applicant’s evidence  of a  stellar Navy
career.
Shortly after Applicant and first his wife separated, he began dating ML, who also
was separated from her spouse. Applicant and his wife had been friends of ML and her
husband for several years, and the two couples had shared many common interests (Tr.
178-79) According to Applicant, he and ML stopped dating because ML was concerned
about her three daughters. (Tr. 180)
Before Applicant and ML started dating, he had loaned her a laptop, he had loaned
her husband a pressure washer, and he had left a set of weights in their garage. Applicant
admitted that, after asking for the return of his property several times, he sent some “pretty
pointed” emails to ML and her husband, saying that he wanted his property returned. ML’s
husband  interpreted  his  emails  as  threats,  and  he  obtained  a  protective  order  against
Applicant in April 2018. (Tr. 180-81) The protective order is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f, but the
basis for the order is not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant met TR through an online dating service, and they began dating in May
2017.  Their  relationship  ended  in  March  2018.  After  they  broke  up,  two  laptops  were
stolen  from  TR’s home, and Applicant was accused of stealing them. In April 2017, he
was  arrested  and  charged  with  grand  larceny,  burglary,  vandalism,  and  violating  a
protective order. (GX 7) In April 2019, he was convicted of breaking and entering, a felony,
and petit larceny, a misdemeanor. A sentencing hearing was conducted in August 2019.
In September 2019, he was sentenced to four years in jail for the breaking and entering
and 12 months for the petit larceny offense, suspended for five years on the conditions of
good  behavior  and  no  contact  with  TR.  (GX  6)  He  is  still  on  probation.  His  arrest,
conviction, and sentence are alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g.
On  October  25,  2020,  Applicant  was  charged  with  sending  threatening  text
messages to TR. (GX 2) On October 28, 2020, he was charged with stalking TR, and he
was served with an emergency protective order. (GX 3) The record does not reflect the
disposition of the charges of sending threatening text messages and stalking. The stalking
charge and the protective order are alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
In  September 2017, Applicant was issued  a  summons for larceny from  a  military
exchange  store. He  was accused  of  taking  a  small  box of cologne,  removing  the  cologne
from  the  box,  and  placing  it  in the  pocket of the  athletic shorts that  he  was wearing.  (GX
9) His trial was delayed  several times because  the  security officer from  the  exchange  did
not  appear.  (Tr.  175-76)   In   June   2018,   he   pleaded   no   contest,   was  convicted   of  petit
larceny,  and  was sentenced to 10 days in jail, suspended, and one year of unsupervised
probation. (GX 11 at 7;  GX 12 at 7) In his answer to the SOR, he  admitted the allegation
but   asserted   that  his  conduct   was  unintentional  and   the   result  of   inattention   and
distraction. At  the  hearing, he  testified  that he  was carrying  bottles  of wine  while in the
store, when his cellphone  rang. He  placed the  wine  on  the  checkout counter and  put the
cologne   in  his  pocket.   He  paid  for  the   wine   but  forgot  to   pay  for  the   cologne.  He  was
leaving  the  store when  he  was confronted  by a  store security officer.  The  security officer
refused  to  allow him  to  pay for the  cologne  and  called  the  police. (Tr.  171-75) The  arrest,
conviction, and sentence are alleged  in SOR ¶  1.i.
In October 2017, ML reported to the police that Applicant had posted partially nude
photos  of  her  in  front  of  a  local  business.  (GX  8)  The  charge  was  based  on  ML’s
speculation that Applicant was the only person who had the photos. When Applicant was
interviewed by a security investigator in September 2021, he told the investigator that he
believed  his  ex-wife  posted  the  photos.  (GX  11  at  9)  At  the  hearing,  he  submitted  a
statement from a friend who believed that Applicant’s ex-wife and some friends posted
the  photos,  because  he  had  observed  them  posting  the  same  photos  on  the  portable
toilets at a wine festival. (AX D(7)) Applicant was charged with obscenity by disseminating
photos to harass. (GX 8) In his answer to the SOR, he denied being convicted. The arrest,
charge, and conviction are alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h, but there is no evidence of a conviction.
In April 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation received a report that Applicant
had impersonated a federal agent. (GX 10) The record contains no evidence of the source
of the complaint or its disposition. Applicant testified that he had no knowledge of such
an incident. (Tr. 176-77) The complaint is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e.
In  about  March or April 2018, Applicant began  dating  AK, an  acquaintance  of  TR.
AK   lost  a   diamond   earring   in  Applicant’s  home,   and   he   found   it  after  their   relationship
ended.  He  offered   to   return  the   earning   to   AK   if  she   would  reimburse  him   for  lodging
expenses that he  incurred  for her son  while  participating  in  an  athletic tournament.  Even
though  AK  ignored  the  request  for  reimbursement,  he  returned  the  earring. Several weeks
later, someone  slashed  the  tires in AK’s vehicle,  and  she  told police  that she  suspected
that  her  tires were  slashed  by  Applicant.  She  admitted  that  she  did  not see  who  slashed
her tires,  but she  believed, “based  upon  their  history,”  he  was involved  either directly or
by hiring  someone. In  August 2019,  Applicant  was charged  with  vandalism. There  is no
evidence  that he  was convicted. The  police  records reflect the  disposition  as “exceptional
clearance adult.”  (GX 5) The  vandalism  charge is alleged in SOR ¶  1.c.
The SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that In July 2018, a two-year protective order was issued
against  Applicant.  There  is  no  documentary  evidence  in  the  record  reflecting  this
protective order.
In October 2020, TR reported to the police that Applicant had been sending her
threatening  text  messages  and  stalking  her,  and  an  emergency  protective  order  was
issued against Applicant. (GX 2; GX 3) The threatening messages, a stalking charge, and
the protective order are alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
An  attorney  who  represented  Applicant  in  several  matters  alleged  in  the  SOR
testified that in his jurisdiction, a protective order is granted in an ex parte proceeding in
which the respondent does not have a right to be present. He also testified that the judges
in the jurisdiction where Applicant then resided routinely granted requests for protective
orders on scant evidence, on the theory that they do not harm the respondent and they
“would rather be safe than sorry.” (AX A(1); Tr. 119-22)
Applicant’s employment  record from February 2010  to March 2023, was replete
with commendations, pay raises, and accolades. (AX B(1) through B(22) Nevertheless,
he was laid off without prior notice on March 1, 2023, when his company was acquired
by a private equity firm and the merger of the two organizations resulted in eliminating his
job. (AX E) He was hired by another defense contractor on the following day. (AX E(8))
According  to  an  incident  report  submitted  by  Applicant’s  employer’s  security
officer, dated March 13, 2023, Applicant subsequently called a business  partner of the
company  and  threatened  the  senior  executives  and  the  company.  This  incident  was
alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a, but it was later amended to allege that he called a business partner
of the company, using profanity and derogatory language, and said he intended to create
problems for the senior executives and the company. (GX 13)
Applicant testified  that  he  called  a former colleague  and  asked  about  his abrupt
termination.  The  former colleague  was  the  recipient of the  phone  call  alleged  in SOR ¶
2.a.  He knew that  Applicant  was  upset and  told  him  to  calm  down and  think  about how to
move  forward. (Tr. 168) His  former colleague  testified  that he talked  to Applicant as both
a  friend  and  a  colleague.  He explained  to  Applicant that the  company had  been  acquired
by  private   equity   firm   and   the   merger   of   the   two   organizations   resulted   in  eliminating
Applicant’s job.  He was aware  that  Applicant  received  no  advance  notice  that he  would
be  terminated. He  described  Applicant as flabbergasted  and  obviously  angry. He testified,
“There  was   no   threat,   it  was   just   an   upset  person,   as   anyone   would  be   upset  in   that
situation.”  He is  confident that Applicant was laid  off to  trim  management levels and  not
because of the conduct alleged in  the SOR. (Tr. 68)
The  former  colleague  who  received  the  phone  call  testified  that  he  has  held  a
security clearance for more than 25 years. Applicant was still on active duty, in 2008 or
2009, when they met. Their relationship started out as purely professional but then grew
into a social relationship. In his opinion, Applicant is very talented and well respected in
the entire maritime community.
The former colleague testified that he was familiar with the allegations in the SOR
and still believes that Applicant should hold a security clearance. (Tr. 44-54) He admitted
that he was surprised at some of the conduct alleged in the SOR. He testified that, if he
saw similar conduct while doing a background check, he would have to take a second
look  and  exercise  due  diligence.  (Tr.  62)  The  former  colleague  submitted  a  written
statement encapsulating the views he expressed at the hearing. (AX D(2))
Applicant also telephoned his program manager and asked him if he thought the
termination was handled properly. He testified that the program manager agreed that it
was not handled properly. (Tr. 169)
Another friend and former co-worker of Applicant, who holds a top secret clearance
and is a senior executive of a defense contractor, submitted a statement and testified at
the hearing. She has known Applicant for about four years as a friend and a business
colleague.  She  described  Applicant  as  an  honest,  thoughtful,  easy-going  person,  and
candid,  but  respectful and  considerate of  others. (AX  D(4))  She  was  unaware that  the
SOR alleged that Applicant had threatened any of the executives of his former employer.
Prior  to  reading  the  SOR,  she  was  unaware  of  any  of  the  conduct  alleged  in  it.  She
testified that the allegations gave her pause, but she believes that she knows Applicant
well  enough  to  believe  that  there  are  two  sides  to  a  story.  Aside  from  her  personal
opinions about Applicant, she believes that he enjoys a reputation for trustworthiness, as
evidenced by the fact that he was offered another job shortly after he was terminated. (Tr.
25-34) She admitted that she would have to “think hard” about hiring someone who was
convicted of a felony. (Tr. 39)
Another friend and professional colleague, who has known Applicant for ten years
and who has considerable experience in evaluating  applicants  for security  clearances,
considers Applicant to be trustworthy, reliable, and responsible. He reviewed the SOR
and opined that Applicant’s security clearance should be continued. (AX D(1))
Another  friend  of  Applicant  who  has  known  him  since  they  were  five  years  old
testified on his behalf and submitted a written statement supporting Applicant. This friend
is an Army veteran, a former foreign service officer, a former defense contractor, and now
owns his own business. He reviewed the SOR and believes that the alleged shoplifting
was  the  product  of  the  inattention  and  distraction.  He  would  not  hire  someone  with  a
record like the SOR without asking questions. He was hesitant to comment on the conduct
alleged  in  the  SOR  without  knowing  more  facts,  but  he  unequivocally  stated  that  he
believes Applicant is a trustworthy and reliable person. (Tr. 79-83; AX D(6))
Another friend, who has known Applicant for 20 years, is a licensed realtor and
executive  director of a non-profit organization,  states that Applicant  is one of the most
trustworthy and loyal people he knows. (AX D(7)
Another friend who worked with Applicant until 2019 regarded him as a talented,
resourceful, hardworking, and responsible engineer. The friend is now retired from federal
service and is a senior vice-president and program manager for a defense contractor. He
tried to recruit Applicant to work for his company but was unable because of the ongoing
issues with his security clearance. (AX D(8))
Applicant’s  son  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  and  holds  a  top-secret
clearance. He admires Applicant for his diligent and efficient work ethic. He regards him
as  a  selfless  and  generous  person.  Applicant  taught  him  to  be  respectful,  kind,  and
patient, and to “take a step back and reflect on situations instead of reacting irrationally
to difficult circumstances. (AX D(9))
Applicant met his current spouse in July 2019, and they married in August 2020.
His spouse has never held a security clearance. She testified that she was familiar with
all the conduct alleged  in the SOR, and  that  Applicant was  very open about what had
happened during his various relationships. She testified that she knew Applicant was not
guilty of slashing AK’s tires and sending threatening text messages to TR because they
were  together  when  those  incidents  allegedly  occurred.  (Tr.  93-94)  She  believes  that
Applicant is a loyal, hardworking, intelligent, generous, trustworthy person. (AX D(5))
Applicant and his current spouse were residing in a motorcoach resort  that was
recently struck by a hurricane. The officers of the motorcoach resort association and 61
residents signed a letter commending Applicant for his extraordinary participation in the
recovery and clean-up operation. (AE D(10))
",False
"Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  is  on  unpaid
leave pending the outcome of this adjudication. He attended college for a period without
earning a degree. He married in 2006, divorced in 2009, married for the second time in
2015,  and  divorced  in  2018.  He  lives  with  a  cohabitant  in  what  he  describes  as  a
common-law marriage. He has three children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17-21, 60-61; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  August  2007  until  he  was  honorably
discharged  for  medical  reasons  in  August  2008.  He  testified  that  he  served  “[a]  little
short of two years.” His DD-214 indicates that he served 11 months and 23 days. (Tr. at
19; AE A)
Applicant was still in a training command in March 2008 because of his medical
issues.  Two  soldiers  reported  that  Applicant  attempted  to  sell  them  ecstasy  (3,  4
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)), an illegal controlled substance. One of the
soldiers  stated  that  he  overheard  Applicant  tell  a  soldier that  he  had  two  more  to  sell.
Applicant then asked the soldier if he wanted some ecstasy. The soldier said, “hell no,”
and reported the incident to the sergeant first class on duty. (Tr. at 20, 41-42; GE 1, 7)
The  duty  sergeant  confronted  Applicant,  read  him  his  rights,  and  asked  him  to
empty his pockets and his wallet. The sergeant found two pills inside a plastic wrapper
in  Applicant’s  wallet  that  were  later  determined  to  be  MDMA.  The  sergeant  asked
Applicant  what  the  pills  were,  and  he  answered  ecstasy.  A  Criminal  Investigation
Command (CID) investigation was initiated in 2008. Applicant waived his right to remain
silent and provided a sworn statement. (GE 7)
In the sworn statement to the CID, Applicant stated that there was a song on that
was about ecstasy, and he asked the soldiers if either had used ecstasy before, but he
denied selling or attempting to sell ecstasy. He stated that he obtained the two pills in
January 2008 while at a strip club. Someone at the club  traded Applicant the two pills
for some beers. The individual said the pills were some kind of medication but  did not
say  what  medication.  Applicant  stated  that  he  assumed  they  were  some  kind  of  pain
pills. Applicant placed the pills in his wallet, where they were later discovered in March
2008 by the duty sergeant. Applicant specifically stated that he only received two pills,
and he never took any of the pills. He was given a urinalysis drug test that day, which
tested positive for MDMA. (GE 7)
The  CID  referred  the  investigation  to  Applicant’s  command  for  the  offenses  of
wrongful  possession  of  hallucinogens  with  intent  to  distribute,  wrongful  use  of
hallucinogens,  and  false  official  statement.  There  is  no  direct  evidence  of  any
disciplinary   action   against   Applicant,   and   he   was   discharged   with   an  honorable
discharge. I note  that the  CID reported  that he  was an  E-2  in March  2008, and  his  DD-
214 reported that he was an E-1 when  he was discharged.  (GE 7)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2021.  The
interview  was  summarized  in  a  report  of  investigation  (ROI).  Applicant  confirmed  the
accuracy  of  the  ROI  in  August  2022.  He  admitted  during  the  interview  that  several
soldiers reported that he was selling ecstasy to soldiers. He stated that people lied, that
the  military  was  a  hostile  environment,  and  he  was  not  liked.  He  stated  that  he  never
tried to sell drugs, and a drug was never obtained in the incident. (GE 2)
Applicant  provided  a  slightly  different  story  during  his  testimony.  He  denied
knowledge  that  the  pills  were  ecstasy,  and  he  denied  trying  to  sell  the  pills  to  other
soldiers.  He  stated  that  he  received  three  pills in  the  strip  club,  and  he took one  for a
headache, thinking it was pain medication. He  stated that he forgot he had the pills in
his wallet. He did not recall if he was given a urinalysis drug test, and he did not recall
being informed that he tested positive for ecstasy or MDMA. (Tr. at 41-46)
I did not find Applicant credible. I find the CID report to be far more reliable. I find
Applicant knowingly used ecstasy, had at least two ecstasy pills that he tried to sell, and
tested  positive  for  MDMA.  I  further  find  that he  intentionally  provided  false  information
about  the  incident  to  CID  (false  official  statement),  during  his  2021  background
interview, and during his testimony.
Applicant was driving with his two-year old child in a child seat in May 2019 when
he  was  stopped  by  the  police  for  defective  tail  lamps.  He  voluntarily  gave  the  police
consent  to  search  his  vehicle.  The  police  discovered  under  the  driver’s  side  seat  a
canister  of  white  powder  that  was  later  identified  through  analysis  to  be  about  three
grams  of  methamphetamine.  A  small  backpack  was  on  the  floor  by  the  front
passenger’s  seat.  There  was  a  canister  with  suspected  methamphetamine  residue  in
the backpack. A glass pipe of the type that is commonly used to smoke drugs was also
in  the  backpack.  Small  clear  baggies  were  found  in  the  driver’s  side  door  and  in  the
backpack. (Tr. at 32-41; GE 8)
When  he  was  arrested,  the  police  discovered  two  small  clear  baggies  with
methamphetamine  residue  in  his  right  front  pocket  and  a  container  with  .1  gram  of
methamphetamine  in  his  left  front  pocket.  A  med-kit  with  multiple  containers  of
suspected  THC  oil  was  found  under  the  passenger  seat.  Possession  of  marijuana  or
THC was not a violation of state law. (GE 8)
Applicant  was  charged  with  possession  of  a  controlled  substance  for  the
methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia. In June 2019, a warrant was
issued for his failure to appear at a court date, and he was arrested. He stated that he
had  moved  and  did  not  receive  notice  of  the  court date.  In  October  2019,  he  pleaded
guilty  to possession of a controlled substance, and the other charges  were dismissed.
He  was  sentenced  to  supervised  probation  for  two  years,  completion  of  a  substance
abuse evaluation with the requirement to follow any recommendations, and community
service.  He  passed  multiple  drug  tests  between  May  and  December  2019.  He
completed  the  terms  of  his  probation;  it  was  converted  to  unsupervised  probation  in
November 2020; and probation was terminated early in May 2021. (Tr. at 36, 46-49; GE
6, 8-10; AE E)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
June 2021. He reported the May 2019 arrest and subsequent conviction for possession
of  a  controlled  substance.  He  denied  illegally  using  any  illegal  drugs  or  controlled
substances in the last seven years. (GE 1)
When  he  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  August  2021,
Applicant stated that he was unaware there was methamphetamine in his car when he
was  arrested
in  May  2019.  He  denied  knowingly  using  or  possessing
methamphetamine. He stated that he let someone else use his vehicle, and the person
must  have  left  the  drugs  in  his  car  without  his  knowledge.  He  stated  that  he  did  not
know  the  friend’s  name,  and  he  no  longer  associated  with  him.  He  also  told  the
investigator that the June 2019 arrests for failure to appear were for the same incident.
(GE 2)
Applicant testified that he was going through a difficult time in his marriage, and
he used methamphetamine on one occasion before his arrest. He admitted that he had
baggies in his pocket that were from when he used methamphetamine. He continued to
deny  that  he  knew  there  was  methamphetamine  in  his  vehicle.  He  stated  he  lent  the
vehicle to the friend he used methamphetamine with, and that person must have left the
methamphetamine in the vehicle. He denied any additional drug involvement. He stated
that  he  took  responsibility  for  his  bad  decision  to  use  methamphetamine,  and  he
disassociated himself from anyone involved in illegal drugs. (Tr. at 32-40; AE E)
Applicant  denied  being  untruthful  during  his  2021  background  interview.  He
testified that he did not mention to the investigator that baggies were found in his pocket
because he did not remember that fact. (Tr. at 40-41, 49-50, 59; GE 2)
I  did  not  find  Applicant  credible.  I  find  he  knowingly  possessed  and  used
methamphetamine. I further find that he intentionally provided false information when he
failed  to  list  his  use  of  methamphetamine  on  his  SF  86,  during  his  2021  background
interview when he stated that he was unaware there was methamphetamine in his car
and  he  denied  knowingly  using  or  possessing  methamphetamine,  and  during  his
testimony.
The  SOR  alleges  a  $3,069  collection  account  to  a  bank  (SOR  ¶  1.a),  a  $483
collection  account  to  a  telecommunications  company  (SOR  ¶  1.b),  and  a  balance  of
$16,364 due on an auto loan after the vehicle was repossessed (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant
admitted owing the first two debts, but he stated that he paid the auto debt. The debts
are  listed  on  one  or  more  credit  reports.  Applicant  did  not  report  any  financial  issues
when he submitted his June 2021 SF 86, even though all the debts were delinquent by
then. (GE 1, 3-5)
Applicant  stated  that  the  $3,069  collection  account  to  a  bank  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  was
used to buy an engagement ring for his second wife. He stated that he tried to get the
ring back from her after they separated, but she told him that she lost the ring. He was
unable  to  get  her  to  pay  the  account,  so  he  unsuccessfully  disputed  it  with  the  credit
reporting  agencies.  He  stated  that  he  then  did  not  have  the  ability  to  pay  the  debt.  In
October 2023, he agreed to make partial payments of $100 a month for seven months,
with  the  first  payment  due  on  October  20,  2023.  He  testified  that  he  made  the  first
payment,  but  he  did  not  provide  any  documentary  evidence.  (Tr.  at  21-24;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B)
Applicant  stated  that  the  $483  collection  account  to  a  telecommunications
company  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  was  for  equipment  that  he  returned,  but  the  company  did  not
have  records  that  it  was  returned.  He  stated  that  if  he  was  given  a  receipt  for  the
returned  equipment, he  no  longer has  it. He unsuccessfully  disputed  the debt  with the
credit  reporting  agencies.  He  has  decided  to  pay  the  debt.  (Tr.  at  24-26;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-5)
SOR  ¶ 1.c alleges an unpaid  balance of $16,364 due on an auto loan after the
vehicle  was  repossessed.  Applicant  testified  that  the  vehicle  developed  transmission
problems,  and  he  was  told  he  needed  a  new  transmission.  He  had  an  extended
warranty on the vehicle, but the holder of the warranty told him that he did not need a
new transmission. He stopped paying the loan, and the vehicle was repossessed. The
vehicle was auctioned, and the creditor waived any deficiency, resulting in a $0 balance.
During  his  background  interview  in  July  2021,  he  stated  that  he  bought  a  more
expensive  vehicle  than  he  could  afford,  he  missed  payments,  and  the  vehicle  was
repossessed.  He  never  mentioned  transmission  problems.  (Tr.  at  26-30;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE C, D)
Applicant stated that his finances are now in order. He stated that he intends to
pay the remaining SOR debts. (Tr. at 21-32, 58)
Applicant  submitted   documents  and   letters  attesting   to   his  excellent  job
performance   and   strong   moral  character.  He  is  praised   for  his  work  ethic,   expertise,
trustworthiness,  professionalism, commitment  to  the  mission,  craftsmanship,  dedication,
leadership, reliability, and  integrity. He is recommended  for a  security clearance. (AE F-

"Applicant denied all allegations contained in the SOR except SOR ¶ 1.d. (Answer)
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  amended  his  Answer  to  change  all  of  his  denials  to
admissions under Guidelines J, G and E. (Tr. 10) After a thorough and careful review of
the admissions, pleadings, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 54 years old. He earned an associate’s degree in 2004. He has never
been married, and he does not have any children. Since September 2017, he has been
employed by a federal contractor as a machinery maintenance mechanic.  He  is in the
process of applying for a DOD security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 29-30; AE K)
Criminal Conduct:
In order to keep the events in chronological order, I will reverse the order of the
SOR allegations.
Applicant was arrested in December 1990 and charged with disorderly conduct.
(SOR ¶ 1.k) He testified that he was staying in a dormitory when a fight occurred. The
police report in evidence showed that the victim specifically identified Applicant as being
one of the main assailants. The victim had seen Applicant holding a gun, thought to be a
BB-gun, behind his back. The police found five rounds of .38spl, two WCC round nose
lead rounds with brass cases, two federal round nose lead rounds with nickel cases, and
one Winchester .38+P jacketed hollow point round, in Applicant’s pants pocket. Applicant
admitted  that  the  police  did  find  his  bullets,  but  he  claimed  that  his  bullets  were  on  a
keychain that had been discovered in his dresser drawer. There was no mention in the
police report that these bullets were found on a keychain or recovered from his dresser.
Applicant admitted he had missed the original court date, and a bench warrant had been
issued  for  his  arrest.  He  was  found  guilty  of  an  ammunitions  violation  and  disorderly
conduct. He paid restitution and a fine. He denied he had a BB gun or a pellet pistol the
night of his arrest. (Tr. 77-82; GE 2, 6, 7)
In September 1992,  Applicant was  charged with open container in a vehicle. An
arrest warrant was outstanding for Applicant’s  contempt of court charge, as noted above,
and he was taken into custody. This offense was not alleged in the SOR. (GE 2, 6)
Applicant was arrested in November 1991 and charged with aggravated assault.
(SOR ¶ 1.j) He testified that his younger sister had been beat up by a group of girls and
returned home. The parents of the girls came to his house to confront his sister. One of
the parents pushed his sister, so he got in the middle and he may have pushed the parent
off of his younger sister. He believed a neighbor had called the police and he and one of
the  parents  were  arrested.  At  court  they  both  decided  that  they  did  not  want  to  press
charges and the case was dismissed. (Tr. 74-77; GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that on September 14, 1992 Applicant was arrested and charged
with disorderly conduct. Applicant testified that he was in a group of eight friends, and
they had just finished watching a movie. They were in a strip mall playing around, acting
immature,  and  pushing  each  other  when  the  police  arrived  and  arrested  them  for
disorderly conduct. He was 23 years old at the time. They all appeared before the judge
and were found not guilty. (Tr. 71-73; GE 2)
In  about  September  1996,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  disorderly
conduct.  (SOR  ¶  1.h)  Applicant  testified  that  some  of  his  family  members  were  in  the
courtroom because the defendant had killed his father after driving under the influence of
alcohol.  Some  of  the  defendant’s  family  members  were  also  in  the  courtroom,  and
Applicant had witnessed one member shove his mother. He got in between his mother
and the defendant’s family member and a big commotion broke out in the courtroom. The
bailiff  charged  all  of  the  family  members  with  disorderly  conduct.  The  charges  were
subsequently dismissed. (Tr. 70-71)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  in  April  2004  and  charged  with
aggravated  assault.  He  explained  that  his  second  oldest  sister  suffers  from  bipolar
disorder, and she  threatened their mother. Applicant and his brother told her to leave the
house.  His  sister  called  the  police  and  reported  false  accusations  about  him  and  his
brother. They were both arrested despite neither one of them had touched their sister.
The charges against them were eventually nolle prosequi. (Tr. 66-70)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  in  June  2007  for  soliciting
prostitution. He testified that an old female friend of his had asked him to meet with her
because she had just learned that Applicant’s mother had passed away in 2006. He did
not know that she was a prostitute. He met with her in his car in front of her grandmother’s
house. The police pulled up behind him, questioned them separately, and then informed
Applicant that he was being arrested for soliciting prostitution. He claimed they had been
talking in the car for approximately 30 minutes. Applicant presumed his female friend must
have said something incriminating to the police for them to arrest him, or speculated that
maybe the police assumed he had been doing something illegal because they were aware
this female was a prostitute. Applicant stated the judge dismissed the charge against him.
(Tr. 58-66)
In October 2010, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUIA). (SOR ¶ 1.e). He testified:
I fractured  of  a bone  in  my foot and  I had a  boot cast on. So  I was  going  to
CVS  pharmacy to  pick  up  a  prescription.  And  as  I  was  coming  out  of  the
pharmacy, it was,  a  commotion  was going  on. I was in Chicago  at the  time.
It   was  commotion   that  was  going   on   in  that  area.  I  don't  know  what
happened,  but it  was  a  commotion  that  was  going  on.  Before  I  even  got  to
the  car, the  police  had  pulled, had  stopped  me  before I got into  the  car. And
as I didn't even  get into  car to  drive  it, they  were  saying  that,  you  know, they
charged  me with  a DUI. (Tr. 52)
Applicant stated that he believed he was arrested due to racial profiling, and that
the police officer did not even offer him a field sobriety test. Although there was no arrest
record provided, a certified statement of disposition showed that Applicant was found not
guilty of the DUIA. This alcohol-related arrest was not listed on his February 2022 SCA.
(Tr. 54; AE E)
In June 2011, Applicant was arrested for driving on a revoked/suspended license.
(SOR ¶ 1.d). He testified that although he was found not guilty of DUIA in May 2011, he
was unaware that his driver’s license had been suspended following this arrest. He also
was  unaware  that  he  needed  to  pay  a  fee  to  have  his  driver’s  license  reinstated.  He
explained this to the judge and was sentenced to perform community service. The charge
was subsequently dismissed. (Tr. 56-58; GE 2)
In  February  2020,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  domestic
battey/physical contact (SOR 1.c.) that led to a protective order against Applicant, and his
August 2020 arrest for the violation of that protective order (SOR 1.b). Applicant testified
that in February 2020, he resided with his fiancée (F), his fiancée’s son (FS), the son’s
partner  (SP), and  the  son’s children. At the  time, SP was  prohibited  by Department of
Children and Family Services from supervising  the children. While F and FS were away,
Applicant became upset that SP was left to care for the children. FS returned home and
he and Applicant got into an argument. Eventually F arrived home, and she called the
police to report that Applicant had just pushed her. She made additional false allegations
against  Applicant  to  police.  He  was  arrested  and  charged  with  domestic  battery.  On
February  25,  2020,  F  filed  for  a  protective  order  against  Applicant.  While  an  interim
protective order was in effect, F claimed that Applicant circled her residence in his car;
however, Applicant countered that he no longer had the make and model of car F had
identified. (Tr. 35-52; AE C, D, V, X; GE  1, 2, 5)
Applicant submitted documentation that showed his newer car, a Honda CRV, was
purchased on May 6, 2020. He possessed his original car for over two months after the
interim protection order had been issued. On February 9, 2021, this arrest was alerted
through the DOD Continuous Evaluation Program because Applicant had failed to report
it to his employer, as required. In April 2021, over a year since his arrest and due to delays
from the pandemic, the judge found Applicant not guilty of the two charges. In September
2021, his ex-fiancee filed another protective order against him for allegedly making phone
calls. She failed to appear in court and the protective order was vacated in October 2021.
Applicant listed this arrest on his February 2022 SCA. (Tr. 35-52; AE C, D, V, X; GE 2, 5)
SOR  ¶   1.a   alleges   that  Applicant   was   arrested   in   November 2021   and   charged
with  DUIA–  2nd  offense,  improper traffic lane  usage, and  operating  an  uninsured  motor
vehicle. The  police  report disclosed  that Applicant had  reported  that  he  was  on  his way
home from his  sister’s birthday  party. Applicant at first d  enied  he  consumed  any  alcohol,
but he  later admitted  to  the  police  officer that  he  had  consumed  one  alcoholic beverage.
The  police  report  also  disclosed  that  Applicant had  participated  in  a  breathalyzer test  and
appeared  to  have  urinated  in his pants. He  was placed  under arrest after his  blood  alcohol
content (BAC)  was measured  0.245%.  Applicant’s car appeared  to  have  been  involved  in
a  hit and  run  accident since  there was significant damage  to  the  front of the  car, the  front
passenger tire was blown,  and  Applicant had  been  driving  on  the  rim. Applicant testified
that he   told   the   police   officer that   he   was not  feeling   well   and   that  he   needed  medical
treatment.  The police dropped him off at his home
Applicant  testified  that  he  had  been  to  the  dentist  to  have  a  tooth  removed  on
Thursday. He went home and was not feeling well, and he was not eating or taking his
type II diabetes medication. Around 4:00 AM on Sunday, he decided to drive himself to
the hospital. He was in a state of confusion and was pulled over by the police for driving
under 20 mph in a 45 mph zone. He did not have a sister who had a birthday during the
month  of  November,  and  he  admitted  he  was  very  confused  when  speaking  with  the
police  officer.  Applicant’s  counsel  asked  him  if  he  was  familiar  with  hyperglycemia.
Applicant  stated  that  this  condition  occurs  when  your  blood  sugar  is  not  properly
controlled with medication. The symptoms include confusion, loss of motor skills, and, if
left  untreated,  it  can  ultimately  lead  to  diabetic  stroke.  He  also  stated  that  he  takes
medication  for  type  II  diabetes,  but  he  had  not  personally  experienced  symptoms  of
hyperglycemia  because,  for  the  last  15  years,  he  had  always  taken  his  diabetic
medication  as  prescribed.  The  only  time  he  did  not  take  his  diabetic  medication  was
during this particular incident while he was suffering from extreme tooth pain. Applicant
testified that he had not consumed any alcohol that night or during the past 27 years after
his father was killed by a drunk driver in 1996. (Tr. 31-38; AE Q, R, S, U; GE 1, 2, 3, 4)
Applicant testified that after the police dropped him off at his home he called 911
to go to the hospital. A blood sample was taken that showed his blood sugar was high,
reportedly  126.  He  was  held  at  the  hospital  for  about  four  hours  and  released.  He
eventually hired an attorney who recommended that he plead guilty to the reduced charge
of reckless driving. In December 2022, Applicant pled guilty to reckless driving. He was
required to enroll in an alcohol program, use an alcohol-testing device for one year, attend
a victims-impact panel, and pay fines of $2,502.  His required use of the testing device
was later reduced to six months after he successfully passed all alcohol-breath tests. He
was also placed on probation for two years. (Tr. 38-43; AE A, B, D, F, T; GE 4)
At the time of the hearing, Applicant remained on probation, which was scheduled
to terminate on December 6, 2024. He disclosed this arrest on his February 2022 security
clearance  application  (SCA).  He  listed  that  the  DUIA  charge  was pending  and  that  he
“was on medication for tooth pain from the doctor.”  There is nothing in the police report
that indicated Applicant had told the police officer that he was not feeling well or that he
needed medical attention.  He had been taken to the police station following his arrest,
and he had refused to provide another breath sample or answer police questions. After
completing the booking process the police dropped him off at his home. Applicant testified
that he was very confused, feeling terrible, and he was likely suffering from hyperglycemia
at the time of his arrest. Since he had not consumed any alcohol, he assumed diabetic
ketoacidosis could have caused him to provide a false positive on the breathalyzer test,
based on the medical reports and studies in the record. (Tr. 38-43; AE A, B, D, F, T; GE
1, 4)
Applicant testified that he did not specifically request any alcohol test or toxicology
tests when he was hospitalized following his arrest. The hospital records reflected that
Applicant  had  apparently  complained  of  abdominal  pain  following  a  motor  vehicle
accident. There was no evidence that Applicant entered the hospital due to high blood
sugar, tooth pain, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. The medical records disclosed
that  Applicant  had  no  evidence  of  acute  abnormality  in  the  chest,  abdomen,  or  pelvis
following a CT scan. His lab results showed that he scored within the normal range, low
range,  as  well  as  in  the  high  range  in  several  test  areas.  There  is  no  documentary
evidence that Applicant experienced, tested, or was treated for high blood sugar levels,
hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. (Tr. 44; AE T, Y)
The  medical  information,  studies,  and  reports  in  the  record  noted  that
hyperglycemia  occurs  usually  when  a  person  with  diabetes  skips  insulin  or  other
medications prescribed to lower blood-sugar levels. It stated that “Hyperglycemia usually
doesn’t cause symptoms until blood sugar (glucose) levels are high – above 180 to 200
milligrams…”  (emphasis  added;  AE  P)  The  lab  result  of  Applicant’s  blood  sugar  level
following  his  DUIA  arrest  was  reported  at  126.  (AE  T)  In  addition,  the  Mayo  Clinic’s
medical report stated that symptoms of hyperglycemia develop slowly over several days
or  weeks.  (AE  P)  In  this  instance,  Applicant  had  a  tooth  pulled  on  Thursday  and  on
Sunday  morning  at  4:30  a.m.,  he  was  arrested  for  DUIA  and  claimed  he  was  likely
suffering from hyperglycemia. Based on this information it does not appear, nor is there
any evidence to support, that Applicant was suffering from hyperglycemia at the time of
his  second  DUIA  arrest.  Applicant’s  systoms  are  consistent  with  a  highly  intoxicated
individual whose BAC was measured at 0.245%. (GE 4)
Another  medical  article  described  diabetic  ketoacidosis  as  a  severe  medical
condition  that  is  life-threatening.  This  condition  develops  after  an  individual  suffers
uncontrolled  hyperglycemia.  (AE  AA)  Because  the  record  evidence  did  not  establish
Applicant  suffered  from  hyperglycemia,  Applicant  similarly  did  not  establish  that  he
suffered from diabetic ketoacidosis. Therefore, the discussion of this medical condition is
irrelevant and not entitled to much weight in my decision. (AE P, W, AA, BB)
Applicant  was  sentenced  to  enroll  in  the  Level  2  intensive  outpatient  program
(IOP). The one-page IOP summary from an addiction counselor stated that Applicant had
successfully completed the program on January 27, 2022:
[Applicant]  has been  encouraged  to  regularly engage  in community support
group  meetings (e.g.  12-step  groups),  get a  sponsor; engage  regularly in
mental  health   treatment  and   continue   to   actively  apply  what   had   been
learned in group.  (AE J, Z)
There was no diagnosis or prognosis given in the IOP summary, but based on the
comments  provided,  it appears that  Applicant  was  treated  for  some  type  of  substance
misuse.  The  addiction  counselor’s  recommendation  that  Applicant  participate  in  a
continuing support group and obtain a sponsor infers that Applicant had misused some
type of substance. Applicant  did not  disclose  this alcohol treatment,  which he had  just
completed, on his February 2022 SCA. He did not provide complete treatment records
except for the one-page summary. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant is
complying with the addiction counselor’s recommendations.  (Tr. 44; AE J, Z; GE 1)
Applicant has been employed by a federal contractor for six years. He stated that
he  just  recently  found  out  that  he  is  required  to  report  any  arrest  to  his  employer.  He
initially denied that the employer provided annual security briefings, but then he changed
his mind and admitted they do have annual security briefings. The reporting requirement,
however, had not been discussed during those earlier security briefings. He did not report
his February 2020 arrest for domestic assault/physical contact, his August 2020 arrest for
violation of a protection order, or his November 2021 arrest for DUIA to his employer, as
required. (Tr. 98-100)
Alcohol and Personal  Conduct:
Paragaph 2 of the SOR (Guideline G) cross-alleged the two DUIA arrests (SOR
¶¶ 1.a and 1.e), and Paragraph 3 of the SOR (Guideline E) cross-alleged all of the criminal
allegations cited under Paragraph 1.
Applicant submitted seven character-reference letters. Three letters were authored
by  former  or  current  co-workers,  two  letters were  provided  by  his sisters,  and  another
letter  was  provided  by  a  collegue.  A  one-page  summary  was  also  submitted  from  the
Level 2 IOP addiction counselor, as previously discussed. All six references agreed that
Applicant was honest, trustworthy, and possesses a great deal of integrity. (AE J, U, Z)
Applicant provided a 2018 and 2021 employee year-end performance reviews. He
was  rated  a  “successful  performer”  those  two  years.  I  did  not  see  his  year-end
performance  reviews  for  2019,  2020,  or  2022.  Applicant  also  submitted  several
certificates of achievement, recognition and awards from 2001 to 2006. (AE H, M)
",False
"Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a;  he  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.d;  and  he
denied  the  cross-allegation  at  SOR  ¶  2.a,  all  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned
an associate degree in 2014 and a bachelor’s degree in 2018. He is pursuing a master’s
degree  through  his  employer.  He  has  worked  as  a  research  engineer  for  a  university
research institute since September 2019, with a clearance. He has an annual salary of
$105,000, plus a bonus. (GE 1; Tr. 9, 53-55, 112-113)
The  SOR  concerns  four  criminal  offenses,  three  of  which  occurred  when
Applicant was between the ages of 18 and 21. In November 2008, Applicant, then age
18, was  living  with  his parents.  Police  came  to  the  home  while  investigating  a  serious
crime  in  the  neighborhood  and  asked  to  search  the  home  for  suspects.  When  his
parents  allowed  police  to  search  Applicant’s  room,  they  found  an  ounce  of  marijuana.
Applicant  went to the  police  station for questioning,  and  he  was arrested and  charged
with possession of marijuana along with a friend. In March 2009, he pleaded guilty to a
charge of public nuisance and was fined $390. (SOR ¶ 1.d) (GE 1 at 49; GE 2 at 5, 12)
Applicant  engaged  in marijuana use between  2008 and 2011, but he has not done  so
since then. He has no other drug-related citations or charges. (Answer; GE 2 at 6, GE 3;
Tr. 86-88)
In  April  2011,  when  he  was 21, Applicant was attending  a  friend’s  birthday party
at  an   apartment   complex.  A   police   report  indicates   that   he   and   another  person   were
driving   recklessly   (“laying   drag”)   in   the   parking   lot.  A   neighborhood   “courtesy   officer,”
Mr.  K.   (an   off-duty   police   officer   who   lived   there)   gave   the   men   a   “criminal  trespass
warning”   and   warned   them   not to   return   to   the  property,  including  to   collect  their   cars,
since  the  men  had  been  drinking.  Applicant left and  walked  to  a  friend’s house  nearby.
When  he  returned  to  the  property hours later  to  retrieve  his  car and  drive home,  he  was
held at gunpoint by Mr. K  and  charged  with  criminal trespass  when  police  arrived. The
police   report  reflects  that  the   arresting   officer   smelled   alcohol  on   both   men.  The   case
was   nolle   prossed   in   July  2011   and   he   was   told   not  to   return  to   the   property.   (SOR  ¶
1.c) (Answer; GE 1  at 50-51; GE  2 at 6, 11,  GE 6,  GE  8)
Applicant was at the party and said it was “a bit loud,”  which made Mr. K upset
because he lived in the unit below. Applicant denied drag racing in the parking lot, but
said  he  pulled  out  “more  quickly  than  [Mr.  K]  had  liked.”  (Tr.  80-81)  He  denied
consuming  alcohol  that  evening,  but  said  it  was  possible  that  was  why  he  was  not
allowed to drive away or come back later for his car. Applicant went around the corner
to a friend’s house. When he returned later to get his car to go to work. Mr. K was in the
parking lot. He called police and held Applicant at gunpoint until police arrived. Applicant
denied threatening Mr. K. (Answer; Tr. 80-86, 89-93)
Months  later,  in  September  2011,  Applicant  drove  to  the  same  apartment
complex  and  dropped a  friend off.  He  was  pulled  over by  police  when he  was  leaving
the  property.  He  had  forgotten  that  he  was  barred  from  the  property  when  his  friend
asked  to  be  dropped  off  there.  He  called  it  a  “dumb,  absent-minded  thing.”  (Tr.  71)
When  Applicant  attempted  to  converse  with  the  arresting  officers  while  he  was  being
handcuffed,  he  was  subdued  with  a  taser.  He  was  arrested  and  charged  with  criminal
trespass and two counts of willful obstruction of law enforcement officers. In December
2011,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  one  count  of  criminal  trespass  and  the  other  two
counts were dismissed. He was sentenced to two days in jail (time served), 12 months
of probation and 24 hours of community service, which he completed. He was ordered
not   to   return   to   the   property.   Applicant   had   friends  who   lived   there   at  the   time,   but  he
has  never  again  visited   the   apartment  complex  in   question,   and   no   longer  associates
with  anyone  there.  (Answer; GE  1  at 51-52; GE  2  at  6-7,  12; GE  5,  GE  7;  Tr.  70-80, 93-
98, 116-117)
In March 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with two domestic violence
(DV) offenses: felony aggravated assault-strangulation and simple battery. (SOR ¶ 1.a)
He disclosed the charges on his April 2021 SCA and discussed them in his June 2021
background interview and noted that they were still pending. (GE 1 at 47-48 GE 2 at 5)
He said he kept his employer’s security office informed as to the status of the case. (Tr.
114-115)
Applicant explained that he had known C for about 15 years. They met and dated
in high school. They had dated occasionally but had spent years out of touch, until they
reconnected in April 2020  when she moved back home  from out of state. They began
dating again but Applicant did not want to renew a serious relationship. In part, he said,
this  was  because  he  had  learned  that  C  was  involved  with  recreational  drugs,  like
marijuana. (GE 2 at 5; AE 10; Tr. 56-57, 98-101)
On the night in question, in March 2021, Applicant and C went out for an evening
of bowling. He said when he picked her up at her house, she had a “big gulp” of wine or
liquor, 9-12 inches tall. He believed she was intoxicated. (Tr 45-46, 64) They each had
one long island iced tea at the first bowling alley. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 101)
Applicant  and  C  went to  another  bowling  alley  and  got  there  30 minutes  before
closing. He spoke to a woman behind the counter about keeping a lane open for them
to  use  until  closing  time.  He  said  C  was  upset  because  Applicant  was  talking  to  this
woman, and she left the bowling alley. Applicant and C then drove to his house, where
he  hoped  to  “smooth  things  over”  and  relax.  His  house  was  closer than  hers,  so  they
went there. (Tr. 59-61, 101-103)
Applicant  said   C   was  upset   and   irate   on   the   drive   home.  This  continued   when
they arrived at his house. (Tr., 62) He said  he  went to  his  room and  told  her  to  leave. He
gave  her money (for the  ride  share)  and  she  left.  He heard her outside  crying.  (Tr. 45-
48,  62-63,  104)  He  denied  grabbing  her with  both  hands,  choking  her, lifting  her up  and
slamming  her  down. He said  he  never touched  her.  He  said  she  was intoxicated.  They
each  had  a  long  island  iced  tea  at the  bowling  alley, and  she  continued  drinking  rum  at
his house  when  they  got there. (Tr. 63-64, 66)  He  did not see C again after she  left that
evening.  He   went  to   sleep.  He  denied   hearing   the   police   when   they  knocked   on   his
door. He said his first interaction  with  police  was the  next day, when  he  was arrested.
(Tr. 47, 66-67,104-105)
The police report indicates that they were called to Applicant’s apartment around
midnight. When they arrived, they found C outside crying uncontrollably. C said she and
Applicant  had  gone  to  the  bowling  alley  and  gotten  into  an  argument.  C  believed
Applicant had treated a female employee there poorly and C became upset, so they left.
(GE 4 at 4-5)
According to the police report, the argument continued at Applicant’s apartment.
They separated and C decided to leave and go home by calling a ride service. Applicant
then  re-engaged,  she  called  him  a  liar,  and  he  became  enraged  and  choked  her,
placing both of his hands on her, slamming her down on her back on the kitchen floor.
She told the officer she could not breathe, and she described her pain level as “10” on a
scale of 1-10. (GE 4 at 5)
The   investigating   officer  noted   that   he   looked   at   C’s  neck  and   “didn’t   see   any
physical  injury”   either   there  or  on   the   back  of  her  head.  C  declined   medical  treatment
and   declined   an   ambulance.  The   officer  noted   an   odor  of  alcohol  on   C’s  breath   but
noted   that  she   did not   appear intoxicated.  She   said  she   was not  sure  if  Applicant  had
been  drinking, but she  said that they  both  had  used  marijuana  that  evening. (GE  4  at 5-
6)  Applicant denied  using  marijuana  that  evening.  (Tr. 65-66)
The  report indicated  that  C  said that  Applicant  “was  a good  person  and  he  has
never physically hurt her in the past. She stated he has a good job and “didn’t  want to
ruin his life” by going to jail because of this incident. Police officers’ attempts to engage
with  Applicant  that  evening  were  unsuccessful,  as  he  did  not  come  to  the  door.  C  left
the  premises  via  a  ride  service.  (GE  4  at  6;  Tr,  104)  Applicant  was  later  charged  as
alleged. (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant  began  his  testimony  by  repeatedly  asserting  that  “the  allegations
against  me  never  happened.  They  were  fabricated,”  and  “simply  did  not  happen.”  (Tr.
41,  106; Answer) He denied  hitting  or  choking  C,  and  said,  “none of  those allegations
are true.” (Tr. 44, 118) He believes C fabricated the police report in an effort to retaliate
against him for rebuffing her romantic interest. (Tr. 56-57) He denied putting his hands
on her in any way. (Tr. 106) He and C have not spoken since that evening. (Tr. 106)
In  January  2022,  prosecutors  agreed,  with  the  victim’s  consent,  to  allow
Applicant  to  enter  into  a  diversion  program.  It  included  supervised  probation  and  40
hours  of  community  service.  He  was  also  required  to  abstain  from  alcohol  and  drugs.
He  completed  the  program,  in  June  2022.  Once  that  occurred,  the  case  was  nolle
prossed. (AE 9, 11, 18a, 18b; Tr. 68-70, 106-107)
Applicant  also  began  anger  management  counseling  in  September  2021,
following an assessment. Applicant’s explanation to the assessor about what happened
with C is fairly similar to his other explanations. He “adamantly denies not [sic] putting
his  hands  on  the  young  lady.”  (AE  19a  at  3)  He  reported  that  he  stopped  smoking
marijuana  at  age  21.  The  licensed  professional  counselor  noted  that  the  precipitating
incident appears to be “isolated and a one-time incident” though she noted that he had
an  “alleged  physical  altercation  without  diffusing  it.”  A  four-week  anger  management
course was recommended. (AE 19a at 9)
Applicant  found  the  anger  management  counseling  helpful  and  has  continued
participating  in  hour-long  counseling  sessions  long  after  his  requirement  ended.  He
documented  six  sessions  (some  double  sessions)  between  September  2021  and
November 2021, 15 sessions between February and December 2022, and six sessions
between  March  and  September  2023.  (AE  19a,  19b,  22)  He  gained  insight  from  the
classes,  and  said  they  helped  with  his  communication  skills  and  interaction  with  his
community  and  family,  and  with  awareness  of  his  emotions  and  thought  process.
Applicant denied any subsequent history of violence or issues at work. He has had no
other subsequent criminal charges. (Tr. 43, 49-50, 87-88, 106-112, 122-123; Answer)
Applicant  acknowledged  mistakes.  It  had  been  years  since  he  had  been  in
trouble  with  police.  He  had  made  many  decisions  to  step  away  from  people  and
environments of trouble and focus on his career. He allowed himself to get “sucked in”
to  a  bad  situation  that  jeopardized  his  career  and  his  family.  Applicant’s  life  is
“exponentially” better than it was when he was in his early 20s. He loves his job and is
dedicated to his profession. He does not wany to jeopardize the progress he has made
in his career. (AE 10, 21a at 5, 21b, 21c; Tr. 41-45, 117-118)
Multiple  personal  and  professional  references  provided  recommendation  letters
attesting to Applicant’s character. The letters stated that he is a leader and good human
being.  He  had  a difficult  upbringing.  He  worked  to put himself  through  school.  He  is a
success  story.  (AE  12)  His  girlfriend  has  never  witnessed  any  violent  behavior.  He  is
respectful  and  gentle.  He  takes  pride  in  his  career  and  is  very  focused.  He  would  not
jeopardize what he has worked hard for. (AE 13) He has a strong work ethic, is devoted
to his career and family. He is capable of protecting secrets and is very trustworthy, (AE
14-17)  His  supervisor  at  work,  Mr.  B.,  attested  that  he  performs  his  work,  including
classified  work,  with  responsibility  and  seriousness.  He  is  a  tremendous  asset  to  the
team and adds significant value. Mr. B strongly endorses Applicants’ continued eligibility
for access to classified information. (AE 20)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  two  cross-
allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a  and  3.a).  He  also  provided  a  narrative  statement.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. He has some college credits. He served in the military
in  the  1990s.  He  and  his  wife  have  been  married  since  1995.  They  have  two  grown
children. He has been employed with a defense contractor since 2008 and indicated on
his SCA that he has held a clearance since 2011. He lives in State 1.
In  March  2021,  City  1,  State  1  police  received  a  cyber  tip  from  the  National
Center  for  Missing  and  Exploited  Children  (NCMEC)  and  Google  regarding  possible
child  pornography  on  an  account  linked  to  Applicant.  His  name  and  e-mail  addresses
were on the account, and they were linked to an internet service provider (ISP) address
under  his  name  at  the  address  in  City  1,  State  1.  When  the  warrant  was  executed,
several family members were there but Applicant was not. He was contacted by police,
told  about  the  search  warrant,  and  was  requested  to  come  to  the  premises,  which  he
did. (Item 4 at 2)
Images downloaded via Applicant’s ISP address were deemed to be:
of  pubescent  minor[s]  and  prepubescent  minor[s]  in  lascivious  exhibition
and sex acts, sado-masochistic abuse, masturbation, breast nudity, [and]
genital  nudity.  The  minors  appeared  to  [range]  in  age  from  7-8  to  13-14.
(Item 4 at 2 (Police incident report))
This City 1 police incident report led to a search warrant signed and issued by a
judge.  The  warrant  was  executed  at  the  address,  which  led,  in  turn,  to  Applicant’s
detention  and  interview  at  the  police  station.  His  cell  phones  were  secured.  He  was
given a Miranda warning and waived his rights and agreed to speak to police. (Item 4)
Applicant  confirmed  his  name,  date  of  birth,  phone  number,  ISP,  and  three
separate  email  addresses.  He  denied  being  “into  kiddy  porn.”  He  was  asked  about
specific photos with  sexually explicit  descriptions  referencing  girls aged  9, 11,  and  12.
According to the police report, Applicant said he “would download it to see what it was
and then delete it.” (Item 4 at 3)
Applicant  was  then  placed  under arrest.  Forensic  examination  revealed  that his
phone  contained  file  names  that  matched  the  cyber  tips  from  the  NCMEC,  and
Applicant’s  name  and  one  of  his  e-mail  addresses.  Another  search  warrant  was  then
executed at the home. (Item 4 at 3-4)
On   his  SCA,   Applicant  reported   that   he   lived   at  the   address  in   question   from
about  May 2007  to  about December  2020  “until  my  father’s health  declined.”  (Item  3  at
9)   He  disclosed   the   arrest   on   his  July  2021   SCA.  He  noted   that   the   case   remained
pending  action  from  a  grand  jury. He  also  said, “there was  a  tip  from  Google that  some
obscene  photos  were downloaded  to  my router. My account  has  been  hacked  multiple
times  and  there  is no  evidence  other  than  a  tip  from  Google.”  He said he  had  informed
his employer’s  security office. (Item  3 at 27)
In  September  2021,  Applicant  had  a  background  interview  relating  to  his
clearance  application.  In  discussing  his  April  2021  arrest,  he  asserted  that  his  Gmail
account  had  been  hacked  many  times  during  2020  and  early  2021.  At  the  time  of  the
warrant,  his  daughter  and  her  fiancé  lived  at  the  residence  in  question  with  their  new
baby. He said his lawyer had explained that he had been charged because the Google
tip  had  been  traced  to  a  modem  and  IP  address  that  was  registered  in  his  name.
Applicant acknowledged that he paid for the internet service in the home. (Item 7 at 3-5)
In discussing the police interview, Applicant said he denied downloading anything
inappropriate.  He  said  anyone  at  the  home,  such  as  his  daughter,  her  fiancé,  or  any
visitors,  would  be  able  to  access  the  Wi-Fi  network  even  though  it  was  password
protected. He was told by police that the downloads occurred in December 2020, which
was  right  when  he  moved  out  of  the  home  and  allowed  his  daughter  and  fiancé  and
their new baby to move in. He was caring for his father who was in poor health and in
hospice  care.  (Item  7  at  3-4)  (On  his  July  2021  SCA,  Applicant  listed  his  father  as
deceased).
In March 2022, Applicant answered an interrogatory from the DOD CAF. Grand
jury  action  on  his  case  remained  pending.  Applicant  said  he  had  “never  downloaded
anything that was known to be illegal.” He said his grandson (12 years old at the time of
the warrant) “used to play on my phone and computer often.” (Item 5 at 2)
In discussing his police interview, Applicant said he told the police that “I had not
downloaded anything like that on my devices. I did admit that I have downloaded normal
adult pornography sometimes and that if anything was ever questionable it was deleted
immediately to remove any question.” He also said that due to his family history, he had
“zero tolerance for people doing anything with children.” (Item 5 at 3)
On  January  26,  2023,  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  the  offense  charged,  i.e.,
possession  of  obscene  matter.  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  a  10-year  jail  term,  to  be
suspended for two years, with Applicant placed on two years of probation. He was fined
and  ordered  to  pay  fees  and  court  costs.  He  was  also  required  to  register  as  a  sex
offender under the State 1 Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. (Item 6)
In addressing the SOR allegations in his Answer, Applicant said he “was not the
one that committed the infractions listed.”  His daughter and her fiancé had moved into
the  home  with  his  son  and  two  daughters.  He  asserted  that  the  fiancé’s  son  “had
downloaded pictures on  my phone that he had found on Twitter, Instagram, and other
such  sites.”  Applicant  had  confirmed  to  the  police  that  Applicant  had  previously
downloaded  adult  images  “on  commercial,  age-verified  sites”  (i.e.,  adult  pornography)
but he denied downloading child images (i.e., child pornography). He asserted that this
was because his wife had previously been sexually assaulted by a family member and
that he is protective of his wife and daughters. He asserted that his daughter’s fiancé’s
12-year-old son had admitted downloading the images. (Answer)
Applicant  asserted  that  he  pled  guilty  because  there  was  a  guarantee  of  no
prison time, and no further action would be taken. A trial would risk the jury that “would
want to go after him just based off of the charges” and the risk that he would be seen to
be “trying to throw [his grandson] under the bus to stay out of trouble.” (Answer)
In  his  FORM  Response,  Applicant  again  said  that  “I  never  downloaded  any
material  such  as  I  was  accused.”  He  acknowledged  downloading  adult  pornography
from  age-verified  sites  and  he  would  delete  any  images  of  any  females  who  looked
younger  (16-18).  He  said  he  would  never  download  “something  that  was  of  a  child.”
(i.e.,  child  pornographic  images).  He  asserted  that  during  the  investigation  he  was
concerned  that  it  may  have  been  his  son-in-law  or  grandson  (then  age  12)  who  had
downloaded  the  images,  and  that  the  grandson  admitted  weeks  later  that  he  had
downloaded the images but deleted them for fear of getting into trouble. Applicant said
he  took  a  plea  because  of  the  risk  of  jail  time  and  of  possible  charges  against  his
grandson. (FORM Response)
Applicant acknowledged that it was his responsibility and that of his son-in-law to
monitor what Applicant’s grandson was doing on the devices. Applicant asserted that he
is not vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, in part because he took the plea.
His supervisor and security department are aware of the charges and said they cannot
be used against him. (FORM Response)
Applicant asserted that he can be trusted. He has worked for his employer for 15
years, mostly with a clearance. He served in the military and has never had a security
violation. (FORM Response)
Applicant’s FORM Response included letters from his wife and his mother, and a
joint letter from his daughter and her fiancé. (AE B – AE D) The grandson’s parents said
they recently found out that their son had downloaded some inappropriate materials on
Applicant’s Google account. They talked to their son about “why it wasn’t ok to do that.”
They said Applicant did not want any “backlash” to happen to their son, so he took the
blame.  Applicant  is  a  “great  man.”  His  daughter  insists  Applicant  would  not  take
advantage of any minor over the internet. (AE D)
Applicant’s mother asserted that he never showed interest in younger females in
his  “formative  years.”  He  always  dated  older  women.  He  detests  people  who  mistreat
women and children. (AE C) Applicant’s wife offered a “guarantee [that] he has not done
what he is accused of.” He is the protector of the family and when their adult daughters
were young, he refused to change them, bathe them, or be alone with them.” She trusts
him around any child. She believes their grandson downloaded the material and thought
he had deleted everything. (AE B)
A  manager  at  Applicant’s  employer  has  known  him  for  four  years.  Applicant
possesses  integrity  and  has  healthy  boundaries.  He  is  trustworthy,  reliable,  and
concerned for the well-being of others. He is an asset to the organization. (AE A)

"Applicant is 33  years old. He  has never married, but he  is presently engaged. He
has no  children.  He attended  a  U.S. military academy (the  Academy) from  June  2009  to
November  2011.  He  played   football   at  the   Academy.  He   was  dismissed   from   the
Academy  before  he  had  earned  a  degree. In  April 2017,  he  completed  his undergraduate
courses  and   received   a   bachelor’s  degree   at  another   university.   He  also  earned   a
master’s  degree   in  October  2020.  He  has  worked   as  an   engineer  since   2017,  most

Paragraph 1  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted “with clarifications” each of the five allegations
under this guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to
the matters alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR:
1.a. March 2019  Arrest for Attempted  Assault, Resisting  Arrest,  Obstruction  of a
Police  Officer, and  Assault or Battery. Applicant engaged in a dispute with a driver from
a ride-share company (the Driver) after a night in a bar with friends. Applicant and his
friends were arguing with each other over where the Driver should go first.  The Driver
pulled over and asked the occupants to get out of his car. Applicant got out of the car and
proceeded to punch the Driver in his left cheek with a closed fist through the open window.
Applicant and his friends entered a nearby hotel. The Driver called the police, and upon
arrival  at  the  scene,  the  police  interviewed  the  Driver.  He  provided  the  police  with  a
description of Applicant’s assault and advised that Applicant and his friends had entered
a hotel across the street. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied that he punched the
Driver in the face. He also claimed it was the Driver who was being aggressive, and it
was Applicant who demanded the Driver to pull over and let the group leave the car so
they could find another ride to their homes. (Tr. at 15, 51; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 1-10.)
The police entered the hotel and identified Applicant by the Driver’s description of
him. The police attempted to question Applicant about the dispute. Applicant declined to
respond,  even  refusing  to  provide  his  name  and  identification  card.  He  testified  at  the
DOHA  hearing  that  he  was  unaware  that  he  was  required  to  provide  his  name  and
identification  to  the  police.  The  police  asked  Applicant  to  provide  his  side  of  the  story
regarding his interactions with the Driver. He refused to speak and told his friends to “shut
up.” The police further advised Applicant that he would not be allowed to leave without
properly identifying himself. He again refused. At the hearing, Applicant justified his lack
of cooperation with the police by testifying “there was a lot of racial things going on in the
nation,  and  I  didn’t  want  to  be  involved  or  be  one  of  them.”  He  also  claimed  he  was
unaware of the reason why the police were asking him questions. He was placed under
arrest for assaulting the Driver. He continued to refuse police orders and actively refused
to put his hands behind his back so that he could be handcuffed. He was so strong that
the police could not undo his grip on his hands in front of him. He continued to resist all
instructions from the police, even after being told he would be pepper sprayed in the face
if  he  did  not  cooperate.  He  was  then  pepper  sprayed  and  handcuffed  with  his  hands
behind his back. He refused to walk to the police vehicle, and due to his large size, four
police officers had to carry him to the vehicle. He further resisted the officers attempt to
have him sit in the vehicle. Instead, he laid on the back seat with his feet hanging outside
the door preventing it from closing. (Tr. at 14-17, 51-55; GE 2 at 8-9; GE 3 at 10-11; GE
4 at 1; GE 5 at 1-10.)
The  police  determined  that  based  upon  the  Driver’s  statement  regarding  the
incident that they had probable cause to arrest Applicant for assault. They also concluded
that they had probable cause to arrest him for resisting arrest/obstructing a police officer.
He was charged with those two misdemeanor offenses. Applicant’s version of the incident
with the Driver was unpersuasive, and his demeanor throughout his testimony regarding
his interaction with the police further undercut the credibility of his testimony. Moreover,
Applicant’s  behavior  was  totally  at  odds  with  his  stated  concern  about  the  police
overreacting and using excessive force against him. In reality, his behavior reflected his
abuse of alcohol that evening, which would explain why the criminal trial judge ordered
Applicant  to  abstain  from  consuming  alcohol  for  90  days  as  part  of  his  agreement  to
dismiss the charges. (Tr. at 14-17, 51-55; GE 2 at 8-9; GE 3 at 10-11; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at
1-10.)
1.b.  January 2013  Arrest for Abusive Sexual Conduct in  Violation  of the  Uniform
Code  of Military Justice  (UCMJ) Article 120. On or about May 14, 2011, Applicant, others
from the Academy, and a female civilian (the Civilian) were together drinking alcohol at a
night club. The group then went to a hotel room to continue drinking alcohol. The Civilian
was intoxicated and laid down on a bed in the room. She then fell asleep. When Applicant
and the Civilian were later alone in the room, Applicant laid down on the bed next to The
Civilian and touch her genitals through her underwear. The Civilian awoke and told him
to stop several times, which he did briefly. He continued to arouse himself against her
body and eventually ejaculated. The next day the Civilian filed a sexual assault complaint
with the local police, though she did not know Applicant’s identity. She received medical
attention, and it was noted that there were bruises on her thigh. Also, Applicant’s DNA
was found on her back. She subsequently identified Applicant when she saw his picture
on  a  television  show  in  connection  with  other  sexual  assaults.  The  local  police  ceded
primary  jurisdiction  over  the  investigation  and  charges  to  the  Academy.  Applicant  was
charged with violating Article 120 of the UCMJ. At the June 2012 courts-martial described
in SOR ¶ 1.c, Applicant was found not guilty of this charge. (Tr. at 17, 46-48; GE 6 at 2,
4; GE 10 at 1-2.)
1.c.  June  2012  Court-Martial Trial and  Conviction  for Violations of UCMJ Articles
80,  120,  and  128.  In June 2012, Applicant was court-martialed for the conduct set forth in
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d and 1.e. He was charged with violating Articles 80, 120, and 128 of the
UCMJ, and he was convicted on the specifications relating to the incidents alleged in SOR
¶¶  1.d  and  1.e.  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  dismissal  from  the  service,  six  months  of
confinement, and forfeiture  of all pay and allowances.  A punitive dismissal  is the legal
term for the dishonorable discharge of an officer or academy cadet. He appealed and his
conviction was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeals for his branch of the military. He
was dismissed from the Academy. (Tr. at 21-22, 44; GE 6 at 1-2; GE 7; GE 8; GE 12.)
1.d.   December  2011   Arrest  for  Wrongful  Sexual   Contact   in  violation   of   UCMJ
Article 120. In November 2011, Applicant was investigated for a sexual assault involving
a  female  classmate  (the  Classmate)  that  occurred  in  about  March  2011  in  Applicant’s
dorm room at the Academy. He, two male classmates, and the Classmate spent several
hours drinking alcohol and playing cards late at night. He met the Classmate for the first
time that evening. The Classmate  became intoxicated and vomited. She fell asleep on
the  bed  of  Applicant’s  roommate.  The  male  classmates  left  the  room  to  return  to  their
rooms, leaving Applicant alone with the Classmate, who was asleep. Applicant was highly
intoxicated. Applicant pulled his pants and underwear down to midthigh. The Classmate
felt Applicant entering the bed in which she was sleeping and lie behind her, pressing his
body against hers. He then took her hand and rubbed it against his genitals. After a few
seconds, she was coherent enough to realize what Applicant was doing and pulled her
hand away. She then vomited again. He claimed at the DOHA hearing that he stopped
his sexual actions when she told him to stop. Applicant testified at the DOHA hearing that
he was wrong to make the Classmate feel “uncomfortable.” Applicant was charged and
convicted  of  Wrongful  Sexual  Conduct  in  violation  of  Article  120  of  the  UCMJ.  His
conviction was upheld on appeal.  Applicant did not acknowledge that his conduct was
criminal. (Tr. at 22-24, 45-46, 50-51; GE 7 at 3; GE 9 at 2, 8.)
1.e. November 2011  Arrest for Assault by Battery and  Attempted  Sexual Contact
in violation  of  Articles  128  and  120,  respectively, of the  UCMJ. After a night of drinking
alcohol  at  a  bar  in  November  2011,  Applicant  returned  to  the  Academy  campus  with
friends from the Academy, including a former classmate (FC) who had passed out in the
bathroom  of  the  bar.  FC  had  no  memory  of  what  happened  after  she  passed  out.
Applicant and his friends carried FC to a dormitory room. The classmates left Applicant
and  FC  alone  in  the  room,  and  he  locked  the  door.  The  classmates  returned  and
demanded  that Applicant open  the  door. An  altercation  ensued  between  the  classmates
and  Applicant when  the  classmates found  the  lights were  off  in the  room. The  classmates
found   FC   unresponsive  with   her jeans   unbuttoned   unzipped   and  her shirt  pulled   up   to
chest  level.  An  ambulance  was  called,  and  FC  was taken  to  a  hospital. In  the  investigation
of the  incident, Applicant denied  that he  touched  FC, but claimed he was too  intoxicated
to   be   certain.  He   admitted   that  he   kissed   her  earlier  in  the   evening   while   she   was
incoherent.  His overall  version  of the  events  that  evening  developed  in  the  investigation
significantly   differed   in   critical  details  from   the   appellate   court’s  recitation   of  the   facts
developed  at the  court-martial. At one  point, Applicant  provided  a  statement in which  he
acknowledged   getting   into   bed   with   FC,   who   was   passed   out.   He   commented   that   “I
strongly  believe   its   possible”  that  he   unbuttoned   FC’s  jeans,  “but  I   am   not  100%  sure
because I cannot recall those events.” At the  DOHA hearing, Applicant denied he kissed
FC   and   he   otherwise  did  not  recall   what  he   did  with   FC   that  evening.   Applicant  was
charged  and  convicted  of  punching  both  classmates and  choking  one of them.  Applicant
was  also   charged   with   and   convicted   of   unwanted   sexual   conduct  with   FC,  including
kissing  her when  she  was incoherent. His convictions under  UCMJ Articles 80  and  128
were  upheld  on  appeal. See  SOR ¶ 1.c,  infra. (Tr. at 17-20, 41-45,  50-51;  GE  6  at  1-2;
GE 7  at 2; GE 8  at 2, 3.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline  D, Sexual Behavior)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the two allegations under this
guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to the matters
alleged in paragraph 2 of the SOR:
2.a.  The  SOR  cross  alleges  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.e  under  Guideline  D  in  this
subparagraph.
2.b.  Current  registration  as  a  Sex  Offender in  State  1.  Applicant was required to
register as a Sex Offender as a result of his court-martial convictions. He registered in
State 1 on June 22, 2012, and his registration requirement expires on June 22, 2027. He
claimed at the hearing that, due to a change in the laws of State 1, he was eligible to have
his name removed from the registration list at that time.  (Tr. at 25, 57; GE 3 at 7.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the two allegations under this
guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to the matters
alleged in paragraph 3 of the SOR:
3.a. Alcohol Consumption during  the  period  October 2011 to at least March 2019.
All of Applicant’s criminal conduct alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR was preceded by
his  significant  use  of  alcohol  resulting  in  his  intoxication.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant
admitted that he, at times, consumed alcohol in excess during the period alleged, but not
during the entire period. (Tr. at 25-26, 50.)
3.b. April 2019  Alcohol  Counseling. Applicant testified that he was ordered, by the
court  in  the  criminal  case  arising  from  his  March  2019  arrest,  to  abstain  from  drinking
alcohol for 90 days. He stated that he complied with this court order. Applicant claimed
that  his  participation  in  the  counseling  class  was  voluntary  and  that  he  completed  the
counseling. In a letter addressed to Applicant’s criminal defense attorney, dated April 29,
2019, the alcohol counselor wrote that Applicant “appeared to accept responsibility for his
behavior [on the day of his March 2019 arrest.]” The counselor noted that Applicant had
decided  to  abstain  from  any  further  use  of  alcohol  effective  the  night  of  his  arrest.
Applicant attended four individual counseling sessions. This letter was submitted to the
court.  At  the  DOHA  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  no  longer drinks  alcohol to  the
extent he used to drink before his 2019 arrest. He refined his comment about his drinking
habits to say that he only consumes alcohol on rare occasions, such as at a wedding.
(Answer at 6; Tr. at 26-27, 33-34, 56; AE A.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the single allegation under this
guideline.  The  SOR  cross  alleges  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.e  under  Guideline  E  in  this
paragraph.
Mitigation and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant provided extensive evidence in mitigation and in support of a favorable
whole-person  assessment.  I  have  carefully  reviewed  all  of  the  evidence  and  note  the
following specific items:
Applicant provided a written statement of his intent to  modify his drinking habits
and attend counseling.  He also  wrote that he  understood  that any inappropriate future
involvement  with  alcohol  may  be  grounds  for  the  revocation  of  his  national  security
eligibility, if granted to him. Applicant provided no evidence of any alcohol counseling or
treatment subsequent to the four sessions in March and April 2019.
In addition, Applicant provided six character-reference letters. A former classmate
at  the  Academy  wrote  a  letter  prior  to  Applicant’s  2019  arrest  praising  Applicant’s
“determination and perseverance  to  reach  his  goal of  becoming  an  engineer.”  He also
wrote that he has been impressed by Applicant’s “unwavering devotion to overcoming his
past.” In an undated letter, Applicant’s former girlfriend praised his character and “ability
to be respectful.” She commented that Applicant “did not allow his past to determine who
he is, and it is not an accurate reflection of what he will be in life.” A friend of ten years
wrote that Applicant is passionate and determined to reach his goals. Applicant’s fiancée
wrote  two  letters  that  were  submitted  into  the  record.  In  her  most  recent  letter,  she
commented that the couple recently purchased a home.  She wrote  that Applicant  was
completely  transparent  before  they  began  their  dating  relationship  about  his  past
problems that are the subject of the SOR allegations. She also confirmed that Applicant
no  longer  abuses  alcohol.  She  describes  Applicant  as  “a  respected  member  of  his
community,  both  personally  and  professionally.”  A  longtime  close  friend  also  praised
Applicant’s  outgoing  personality  and  willingness  to  help  others.  This  friend  also
commented on Applicant’s perseverance.  (AE F at 3-5; AE S; AE BB at 1-3.)
Applicant also submitted a lengthy letter from a licensed clinical social worker (the
LCSW), who described the incidents leading up to Applicant’s court-martial and provided
her  analysis  of  Applicant’s  qualifications  under  the  adjudicative  guidelines  for  Alcohol
Consumption  and  Sexual Behavior.  Her recitation of  the  facts  was sometimes  at odds
with the facts set forth in the official records submitted by the Government. Her version of
the  facts  was generally  quite  favorable  to  Applicant,  minimizing  the  seriousness of  his
actions.  Applicant  specifically  denied  to  the  LCSW  that  he  had  ever  “engaged  in  any
sexual assault.” Also, he only reported to the LCSW one incident at the Academy and
advised her that he had  “blacked  out” after excessive alcohol consumption and did not
recall the details of the incident, which occurred in November 2011 and is the basis for
the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.e. The LCSW wrote in her letter that despite his court-martial
conviction and the adverse decision on appeal, Applicant still maintains that he is innocent
of all of the charges. She wrote that the accusations against him were “unfounded.” She
explained in another part of her letter that Applicant believes he was set up by a classmate
who was acting as a confidential informant. The LCSW concluded that despite Applicant’s
history,  he  has  “no  probability  of  sexual  addiction”  or  “alcohol  use  disorder.”  He  also
denied to the LCSW that he assaulted the Driver in 2019. (AE P at 3-8.)
The LCSW also reported that according to Applicant he has never engaged in any
habitual or binge consumption of alcohol. He advised the LCSW that, as of the date of his
November 2021 interview with her, he drinks alcohol two to four times a month and drinks
three to four drinks when he does consume alcohol. (AE P at 5, 8.)
Applicant also submitted evidence of his community involvement, specifically with
an orphanage founded by his parents in the country of his birth.  He is a member of the
Board and assists with fundraising, among other activities. (AE H, AE Y, AE Z.)

"Applicant  is  42   years  old,  and   unmarried  with   no   children.    He  obtained   a   high
school   diploma   and   completed   some   college.     Applicant   is  employed   by  a   defense
contractor  as  a   Aircraft   Structural  Mechanic.     He   is  seeking   to   obtain   a   security
clearance in connection  with his  employment.
Guideline J  –  Criminal Conduct
The  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  has  engaged  in  criminal  activity  that
creates doubt about a  person’s judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  and  calls  into
question a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.
Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct
The Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in conduct which shows a
lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  that
raise  questions  about  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to  protect  classified  or
sensitive information.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  conduct  that  include  three  Driving  Under  the
Influence  of  Alcohol  (DUI)  convictions,  and  two  convictions  for  Possession  of  a
Controlled Substance, all occurring over an  18-year span.  Applicant admitted each of
the  allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR,  except  2.a.,  which  he  failed  to  answer,  and  2.b.,
which  he  denied.  Applicant  began  working  for  a  defense  contractor  in  October  2022.
He applied for a security clearance for the first time in November 2022.
Applicant started using marijuana in about 1996, at the early age of 15, while in
high  school.
In  about  May  2005,  he  was  charged  with  Possession  of  a  Controlled
Substance,  (methamphetamine)  and  Possession  of  Marijuana.  Applicant’s  car  was
pulled  over  by  police  and  during  the  search  of  his  vehicle,  they  found  marijuana  and
methamphetamine.  Applicant  claimed  the  methamphetamine  was  not  his.  He  was

program  for  the  charge  of  Possession  of  a  Controlled  Substance  and  placed  on
probation for a period of five years.
In  about  June  2007,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Driving  Under the  Influence  of
Alcohol.  Applicant testified that prior to the arrest, he consumed about a case of beer
and a bottle of liquor.  He was convicted of the offense, placed on probation for a period
of  five  years,  and  ordered  to  complete  an  18-month  alcohol  program.  Following  the
arrest,  Applicant  tried  to  stop  drinking  and  was  completely  sober  for  about  one  year.
(Tr. p. 39.)  Then, little by little he returned to heavy drinking.  (Tr. pp. 42-43.)
In  May  2008,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Possession  of  Marijuana.  Applicant
was  in  violation  of  his  five-year  probation  imposed  by  the  court  in  2005  for  his  earlier
conviction.  Applicant was convicted of this offense, and placed on probation for another
five years.
In about October 2009, Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence
of  Alcohol.  He  was  convicted  of  the  offense,  placed  on  house  arrest,  placed  on
probation  for  a  period  of  five  years,  and  ordered  to  complete  an  18-month  alcohol
program.  Following this arrest, Applicant stopped drinking for about a year and a half.
(Tr.  p.  44.)  When  he  started  consuming  alcohol  again,  this  time  it  was  different.  He
would  force  himself  not  to  leave  the  house  if  he  was  drinking  alcohol.  He  would  only
buy a six or twelve pack at a time if he went to the store.  This pattern has continued to
the present.  He reduced his alcohol consumption but continued to drink and at time to
excess.
In June 2018, Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.
Applicant  explained  that  he  was  out  of  town  and  went  to  visit  a  friend  who  does  not
drink.  Applicant wanted to relax and celebrate his birthday, so he purchased a six pack
of  beer and  consumed  it.  Later  that  evening,  Applicant  went  to  the  store  to  purchase
another six pack of beer and was pulled over by police.  He was intoxicated at the time.
He was convicted of the offense, ordered to complete a DUI program, and sentenced to
10 days in jail and five years of probation.  He has recently completed probation for the
offense.  Following this arrest, he was able to remain sober for five or six months before
returning to consuming alcohol.  Now, he only drinks socially.
In response to interrogatories dated April 10, 2023, Applicant stated that he last
consumed  alcohol  in  June  2018.  This  statement  is  not  accurate  since  Applicant
returned to  drinking some five or six months following the  2018 arrest for DUI.  (Tr. p.
51.)  He deliberately failed to disclose that he consumed alcohol approximately monthly
and that he continues to consume alcohol to the present.
Applicant has not been formally diagnosed as an alcoholic, but he has seriously
contemplated  the  issue.  This  is  the  main  reason  he  tries  to  abstain  from  drinking
because  he  does  not  want  it  to  control  his  life.  He  has  not  received  inpatient  or
outpatient  treatment  for  his  alcohol  problem  but  he  has  thought  about  it.  He  has  not
received  therapy  or  counseling  for  his  drinking  problem.  He  has  not  attended  an
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting for about a year.
Applicant stated that he is trying to improve himself and his lifestyle.  Since 2018,
he  has  obtained  his  high  school  diploma.  He  graduated  from  an  apprenticeship
program through work, and he enrolled in community college to try to get an Associate
Degree  in  Airframe  Structures.  He has  also  attended  AA  meetings  and  church men’s
groups.

ages 22 and 18. (Item 2)
Applicant has been employed by a federal contractor as a financial analyst since

Department of the Navy as a hardware acquisition lead. She was suspended without pay

Financial Considerations,  Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant fraudulently withdrew $9,724 from
the bank account of a youth activities club between 2017 to 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that,
in  2017,  she  began  to  gamble  to  obtain  funds  to  pay  back  the  money  she  had  taken.
(SOR ¶ 1.b) Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleges the conduct in SOR ¶ 1.a (SOR ¶
2.a), and that in about 2021 she was charged with two counts of Felony Theft and ordered
by the court to pay $20,000 in restitution (SOR ¶ 2.b). Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-
alleges the conduct in SOR ¶¶ 1 and 2 (SOR ¶ 3.a). Applicant admitted all the allegations
in the SOR, with some explanations. (Item 1)
Applicant  volunteered  as  concession  coordinator  and  treasurer  for  a  youth
activities club from 2012 to March 2020. From 2017 to 2019, she wrongfully issued club
checks  totaling  about  $10,000  that  were  made  payable  to  herself  or  to  others  for  her
personal expenses, including a home mortgage, auto loan, and utilities. During this same
timeframe she began to play the lottery with the hope of winning enough money to pay
back  the  money  she  had  stolen  from  the  club  before  anyone  noticed.  She  started  by
occasionally  spending  $20  to  $50  on  lottery  tickets  or  playing  lottery  numbers  and
progressed to playing lottery games every other day and spending $100 to $200 per week
on lottery tickets. (Items 1-5)
In 2019, the new club president  discovered some club funds were unaccounted
for.  He informed board members and Applicant that about $10,000  in club  funds were
unaccounted for, and that it would be investigated. In March 2020, he fired Applicant from
her club positions and reported her suspected fraud to local police. In about May 2020,
she was informed by the police that she would be charged for stealing about $10,000 and
then hired an attorney (Items 3-5)
On August 23, 2021, Applicant was charged with “Theft Scheme: $1,500 to <25K”
and  “Theft:  $1,500  to  under  $25,000”  in  violation  of  the  state  criminal  code,  and
summoned  to  appear  in  court  in  October  2021.  (Item  4  at  2-3)  Each  offense  was
punishable by up  to  five  years  imprisonment  and a $10,000  fine. Each charge  alleged
that from about January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019, Applicant stole $9,754 from the
youth club. The first charge included the additional language that her theft was “pursuant
to a scheme and continuing course of conduct.” A local news outlet reported her name
and case details the next day. (Items 4-5)
On September 8, 2021, Applicant sent an email to a Navy security official admitting
she  had  made  fraudulent  withdrawals  from  the  youth  league  bank  account  totaling
$9,724. She also stated that:
My family was struggling  at  this time  and  I didn’t want to  lose  our house  or
our means  of transportation  to  get to  and  from  our employment.  At the  time
I was struggling  with  a  gambling  addiction. Once  my husband  found  out,  I
almost  lost  my family and  everything  else.  He  has  stood  beside  me, and  I
haven’t gambled  in over a  year and  a  half. As distorted as it is, my thought
process at the  time  was, I would win  enough  gambling  to  back anything   I
took from the [club]  account  plus more.  I know this doesn’t sound  right,  but
my  mind   was   messed   up   at  the   time.   I   do   believe   these   charges   will   be
dropped or dismissed, as full restitution will be made to the league.  Per my
attorney,  there  is  a   possibility  that  the   [district  attorney]   may  say  that  we
need  to  pay  more to  league, and  we  are prepared  to  do  that if that is what
it  takes  to   make   this  go   away.  I  have   never  been   so   ashamed   and
disappointed   in  myself.  I   have   never been   in   any   trouble   before   and   fully
intend to never be in any trouble again, ever. (Item  4  at 1)
Applicant  disclosed  she  had  been  charged  with  stealing  money  from  a  youth
organization in her August 2022 security clearance application (SCA). During a November
2022,  subject  interview  (SI)  with  a  government  investigator,  she  made  the  following
statements.  She  started  stealing  club  funds  because  she  could  not  pay  the  family’s
monthly expenses after her husband’s commission-based income dropped from $5,000
to $2,000 a month. She did not tell her husband that she could not pay the family’s bills
because she did not want to hear from him about why they did not have enough money
when their shortfall was attributable to his income reduction. She acknowledged that her
gambling during this timeframe  did not help their financial  situation but  wanted  to play
because of the chance to win big and to repay the stolen money. She denied stealing the
funds to support her gambling or being addicted to gambling and said she did not go to
gamblers anonymous. She was never late on her bills from 2017 to 2019. She stopped
stealing club funds and quit playing the lottery in 2019 after her pay increased and her
husband found a better paying job. Although she was then able to pay the family’s monthly
bills, she did not have sufficient funds to start repaying the stolen club funds. She did not
tell anyone about her misconduct, including her husband, until after she was fired as club
treasurer in March 2020. (Item 2 at 33-34, Item 3 at 7-10)
Applicant said that she never went to court because the matter was settled out of
court and that the settlement required her to pay $20,000 even though she stole about
$10,000. She estimated that she paid the settlement in about July 2021 but provided no
documentary evidence of a settlement agreement or restitution payment. Based upon her
statement to Navy security personnel, I find that no restitution payment was made before
September 8, 2021. She said she paid restitution with funds obtained through loans. She
reported in her SCA and told the government investigator that the charges were dropped
and had been expunged from her record. In November 2022, she told the investigator the
charges had been expunged in December 2021 and  that she would provide evidence.
The  government  investigator  reported  receiving  documents  subsequently  provided  by
Applicant including “expungement paperwork, copies of her bank statement to show proof
of  payment  to  [her  friend],  and  [her]  loan  paperwork”  and  the  investigator  reported
attaching those documents to the SI, but those documents were not included in the FORM
or submitted by Applicant. (Item 2 at 33-34, Item 3 at 6-10, 12)
In response to the SOR, Applicant explained that it had been more than three years
since she stole from  the  youth  club  and  that  she  “was not ordered  by the  court to  pay
restitution, this was an  agreement between  myself and  the  organization.” (Item  1  at 4)
Her response to the FORM included the following: She reiterated that “payment of the
funds was by agreement and not court ordered as the case never went to trial [and that
she]  was  willing  to  make  any  restitution  required  to  make  things  right.  As  far  as  the
gambling, I was not a gambler before the incident, and I have not gambled in almost 3
years.”  She  noted  that  she  had  always  intended  to  repay  the  money;  that  she  can  be
trusted to report negative conduct because she had reported this incident in the past and
had previously reported an old bankruptcy to a prospective employer. She acknowledged
exercising poor judgement and said her actions negatively affected her entire life. She
said  that  nothing  like  this  would  ever  happen  again  and  that  her  trustworthiness,
judgement,  and  reliability  had  not  otherwise  been  called  into  question  during  her
approximately 30  years  of  working  for the  government  or as  a  government  contractor.
She stated her desire to continue supporting the government. Her responses to the SOR

He  pled  guilty  to  larceny  of  checks  and  identity  theft  in  November  2019,  and  he  was
sentenced  to  five  years  in  jail,  suspended,  and  one  year  of  probation.  The  remaining
charges were nolle prosequi. He was consequently administratively separated from the
Reserve in early 2021, with a general discharge under honorable conditions by reason of
misconduct - commission of a serious offense. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a; Answer; Tr. at 17-18,
30-31, 33-35, 38-49, 61-66; GE 1-2)
This is Applicant’s sole  criminal offense.  He completed  probation  without  issue. As
of the  date  of the  hearing, he  was three  years  into  his five-year deferred  sentence, which
he  expected  to  complete  in February 2025.  He disclosed  this information  on  his March
2021  security clearance  application. (SOR  ¶¶  1.a, 2.a;  Answer;  Tr. at 17-18,  30-31,  33-
35, 38-49, 61-66; GE  1-2)
Applicant stated that he acted rashly, and he could not provide a good explanation
for  his  actions  as  he  was  not  experiencing  financial  troubles  at  the  time.  He  was
remorseful, candid, and took responsibility for his poor judgment. He described it as “the
worst lapse of character that I’ve ever had in my life. If, the only time where I’ve actually
done something like this.” He stated, “I almost ruined my marriage of, at that time, eight
years.” He went to counseling, where he learned to slow down his thought process and
be more deliberate in his actions. He stated, “I’m trying to not let that define me, and also
trying not to let that be the end all. It ruined my [military] career . . . .” He endeavored to
be a positive role model for his children and the children for whom he serves as a sports
coach. (Answer; Tr. at 17, 30-31, 38-49, 61-66)
The SOR also alleged that Applicant had five delinquent consumer debts, totaling
$10,292 (SOR ¶¶ 3.b-3.f), and a $151 delinquent medical debt (SOR ¶ 3.a). Applicant’s
delinquent  debts  are  established  by  his  admissions  in  his  Answer;  his  March  2021
security clearance application (SCA); and credit reports from July 2021, February 2022,
August 2022, and May 2023. All of the SOR debts are reported on the July 2021 credit
bureau report. SOR ¶¶ 3.a-3.e are reported on the February 2022 credit bureau report.
Only  SOR  ¶  3.d  is  reported  on  the  August  2022  and  May  2023  credit  bureau  reports.
(Answer; Tr. at 17-18, 31; GE 1, 3-6)
Applicant  stated  that  SOR  ¶¶  3.b-3.f  were  credit  cards  that  were  fraudulently
opened  in  his  name,  and  he  did  not  learn  about  them  until  he  underwent  the  security
clearance process in 2021 and the background investigator informed him about them. He
stated  that  he  has  a  common  name  and  “my  information  has  been  in  so  many  data
breaches.”  He  initially  disputed  these  debts  directly  with  the  creditors  and  with  Credit
Karma, but then he elected to pay them because he had the financial means to do so,
and  the dispute  process  took  too  long.  He stated  that  he  was  communicating  with  the
creditor for SOR ¶ 3.d and attempting to recoup the money he paid to resolve that debt
because  he  did  not  recognize  it  as his,  as  he  has  only one  credit card  with  this same
creditor. He also stated that he has had ongoing issues with not receiving medical bills
related to one of his child’s frequent visits to various doctors for a medical condition, and
that  the  medical  debt  in  SOR  ¶  3.a  was  one  such  bill.  He  acknowledged  that  he  was
previously not the best at monitoring his credit report. (Tr. at 17-18, 31-33, 49-61)
Applicant  stated  that  he  paid  all  the  SOR  debts  prior  to  receiving  the  SOR.  He
provided documentation reflecting that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 3.a-3.c and 3.e-f are resolved
as of June 2023; he resolved the debt in SOR ¶ 3.f in 2021; and he disputed the debt in
SOR ¶ 3.b in June 2023. (Tr. at 17-18, 31-33, 49-61; AE L)
Applicant stated that his finances are in order, and he does not have any delinquent
debts. He and his wife have a budget that they utilize to “account for everything that we
can as possible.” It reflects a joint monthly income of $9,368 and a monthly net remainder
of  $3,085  after  expenses,  to  include  their  monthly  mortgage  of  $1,590.  They  have
approximately $30,000 in savings. He also has a health savings account from which he
promptly pays his son’s medical bills. He regularly monitors his credit report to keep track
of any fraudulent activity. He has not received credit counseling. (Tr. at 18, 31-33, 53, 55,
60-61, 64, 66-68; AE A-B, E-F, H-J, L)
Two  family  members,  close  friends,  and  a  colleague  of  three  years,  attested  to
Applicant’s  trustworthiness,  reliability,  and  judgment.  The  former  president  of  the
organization  for  whom  Applicant  has  served  as  a  sports  coach  also  vouched  for
Applicant’s honesty and commitment. (AE C-D, G, K, L)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  SOR  ¶¶  4.a-4.g,
and  he  denied  SOR  ¶¶  2.a  and  3.a,  all  with  explanations.  SOR  ¶  3.b  is  a  cross-
allegation that he did not answer, so I consider that he denied it. Applicant’s admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. He graduated from high school in 1997 and has taken
some  college  classes.  He  has  been  married  since  2008,  and  has  a  son,  18,  and  a
daughter,  15.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  October  1997  to  November  2016.  His
DD-214  discharge  form  reflects  that  he  received  the  Navy  and  Marine  Corps
Commendation  Medal, Joint Service Achievement  Medal,  five  Navy and  Marine Corps
Achievement  Medals,  and  six  Good  Conduct  Medals,  along  with  appropriate  service
medals.  (AE  R)  Applicant  received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions
following “Misconduct (Serious Offense).” He was unemployed for about seven months
after  he  left  the  Navy,  until  beginning  his  current  position  with  a  large  defense
contractor, in June 2017. He held a clearance in the Navy. (GE 1, GE 5, GE 6, GE 7; Tr.
10, 34, 46-47, 66-69; AE R)
In  September  2015,  Applicant  was  a  chief  petty  officer  (E-7)  on  a  U.S.  Navy
aircraft  carrier  at  sea.  Sailors  were  on  a  “holiday  schedule”  and  were  free  to  watch
movies and television. (GE 7 at 2) Applicant and several male sailors were at his work
area watching a football game. At about 2100 hours, Sailor S (E-3) went to Applicant’s
work area to use a  computer. Applicant was her mentor at the time. She was wearing
unauthorized  clothing  to  transit  the  ship,  including  Navy  physical  training  sweatpants
and a t-shirt. (GE 5 at 11; Tr. 39, 48-50, 113)
When  Sailor  S  sat  down,  Applicant  said  to  her,  “What  happened  to  [your]  ass,
you  really  don’t  have  any  back  there.”  Other  sailors  laughed.  Moments  later,  Sailor  S
asked  Applicant  for  some  candy  he  was  eating.  Applicant  asked  her,  “What  are  you
excited about?”, referring to the fact that her breasts were visible beneath her shirt. (GE
5 at 11)
Applicant  then  walked  towards  Sailor  S  with  the  bag  of  candy.  She  later  told
Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service  (NCIS)  investigators  that  he  grabbed  her  right
breast while handing her the candy. She said, “he laughed when he grabbed my breast
and the other guys did too.” She pushed his hand away and said, “What the f---? Why
would you do that?” Sailor S then left, went to her own work center, and wrote Applicant
an  e-mail  telling  him  she  found  his  behavior  inappropriate,  offensive,  and  humiliating.
(GE 5 at 11)
Sailor  S  reported  the  matter  the  next  day.  NCIS  investigators  interviewed  the
three other sailors present that evening and obtained a sworn statement from Applicant.
Only  one  of  the  sailors  could  speak  to  the  allegations.  Witness  1  said  Applicant  told
Sailor  S  to  “pull  her  pants  up  over  her  flat  ass.”  Witness  1  was  unable  to  observe
whether Applicant grabbed Sailor S’s breast. (GE 5 at 11; GE 6 at 11-12)
In  her  sworn  statement  provided  to  NCIS,  Sailor  S  said  she  felt  humiliated  and
embarrassed  on  the  night  in  question.  She  said  Applicant  began  making  sexually
inappropriate comments towards her in about April 2014. She detailed an incident when
she was in the hospital and Applicant came to visit her. She said he sat on her bed, ran
his  fingers  through  her  hair,  and  called  her  “beautiful”  and  “sexy.”  She  found  his
behavior  offensive  but  did  not  report  it  since  she  thought  of  him  as  a  mentor.  His
grabbing her breast was the catalyst for her report. (GE 5 at 12) She was transferred to
another ship following her report. (GE 6 at 3)
Applicant  acknowledged  in  his  own  sworn  statement  to  NCIS  that  he  asked
Sailor S, “why are your pants sagging around  your flat ass?”  He also admitted that he
asked her if she was excited about something because he noticed that her “headlights
were on”  (meaning her nipples were showing through her shirt). He said he may have
“grazed  her  breast”  while  handing  her  the  bag  of  candy,  but  he  told  NCIS  that  any
contact was unintentional. He received the e-mail from Sailor S but did not respond, as
he planned to discuss it with her in person. (GE 5 at 11-12; GE 6 at 15)
In the NCIS interview, he said,
I handed  the  bag  to  her with  my right  hand  and  she  grab[bed]  with  her left
because   her  right  hand   is  in   a   [cast].  While   reaching   and   returning   my
hand,  she   pushed   my   arm   away  in  a[n]  upward   manner  because   I   had
grazed   her   breast.   I  didn’t   think   much   of   it  at   the   time,  this  was  not
intentional   or  a   purposely  done   act   to   degrade   her.   I   did   not  squeeze,
grab,  pinch, or grope  her  breast in any way. (GE 6  at 15)
Applicant’s  interactions  with  Sailor S  led  to  charges  under  the  Uniform  Code  of
Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 92 (Failure to Obey Order or Regulation), by “wrongfully
making  inappropriate  sexual  comments  to  [Sailor  S]  about  her  body  parts,  creating  a
hostile  work  environment”;  and  Article  120  (Abusive  Sexual  Contact)  by  touching  the
breast of Sailor S without her consent. In December 2015, at a nonjudicial punishment
(NJP)  proceeding  (captain’s  mast)  under Article  15  of  the  UCMJ,  he  pled  not  guilty  to
both  specifications  but  was  found  guilty  by  the  ship’s  commanding  officer  (CO).
Applicant was put on restriction for 45 days and forfeited $2,764 in pay for two months.
(GE 5. Tr. 48-49, 66-69) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 3.b)
The  CO  found  that  the  witnesses’  statements  at  the  NJP  proceeding  were
consistent with their statements to NCIS. Applicant admitted at the captain’s mast that
his  comments  to  Sailor  S  that  evening  were  inappropriate  and  offensive.  He  admitted
that  he  had  allowed  their  relationship  to  become  unprofessional  and  unduly  familiar.
(GE 5 at 12)
The CO found that “it is clear that [Applicant] made inappropriate comments of a
sexual  nature  about  [Sailor  S’s]  buttocks  and  breasts,  engaged  in  an  unduly  familiar
relationship with her, and fostered an environment where she was comfortable ignoring
the uniform restrictions in his work center.” He found that Applicant was not credible in
asserting that he may have accidentally touched Sailor S’s breast, “in light of his sexual
statements  made  immediately  before  the  incident  and  the  evidence  of  fraternization.”
(GE  5  at  12)  He  found  that  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  supported  the  charges.
(GE 5 at 9)
The CO found that Applicant’s behavior
impacted   good   order  and   discipline,   goes  against   the   U.S.  Navy’s  Core
Values,  and   distracts   from   the   Navy’s  mission.  His  behavior  clearly
violated   the   Navy’s  sexual  harassment   policy,  created   a   hostile   work
environment,   and   violated   all   bounds  of  decency.  He  abused   the   trust
placed  in  him by  this command  as a  Chief Petty Officer. He further abused
his position  as a  mentor to  junior sailors. This behavior has  no  place  in our
Navy.  He must  be held  accountable  for his actions. (GE 5  at 13)
Applicant  retained  legal  counsel  and  appealed  the  NJP  findings  to  the
commander of the carrier strike group, but his appeal was denied. (GE 5) Based on the
CO’s findings, Applicant was recommended for administrative separation (ADSEP) from
the Navy. In March 2016, the ADSEP board convened and found sufficient evidence of
misconduct  due  to  his  commission  of  a  serious  offense.  The  board  recommended  a
general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  (GE  6  at  5)  Applicant  was  discharged
from  the  Navy  as  recommended  in  November  2016.  (AE  R)  (SOR  ¶  3.a)  He  was
discharged  after  serving  19  years  and  two  months  in  the  Navy,  with  the  rank  of  chief
petty officer (E-7). (AE R; Tr. 34-35, 66-69, 71-73)
Applicant  adamantly  denied  Sailor  S’s  allegations  in  his  security  clearance
background  interview.  (GE  7  at  4)  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted
receiving  captain’s  mast  but  denied  the  underlying  conduct,  asserting  that  the  CO  did
not properly consider the evidence presented.
Applicant  began  his  hearing  testimony  by  asserting  that  the  allegations  were
“very  much  fabricated.”  (Tr.  29)  He  acknowledged  using  “a  poor  choice  of  words”  by
telling  Sailor  S  to  “pull  your  pants  up  on  your  ass,  and,  hey,  your  headlights  are
showing.”  He  said  his  “intent  was  to  just  make  her  aware  of  her  unform  appearance.”
(Tr.  30,  45)  He  denied  approaching  Sailor  S  in  any  sexual  manner  or  making
advancements  towards  her.  He  believes  it  was  “unfair”  for  her  to  have  made  those
allegations. (Tr. 30) He feels the Navy did him a disservice, and he believes people do
not want to make statements (in his favor) and jeopardize their own career. (Tr. 30-31)
Applicant  said  Sailor  S  was  in  his  department  on  the  ship,  one  of  about  400
sailors.  He  said  he  was  not  her  supervisor,  but  she  asked  him  and  another  sailor  to
mentor her. Initially he told her she should be mentored by a first class or second class
petty  officer,  but  he  agreed  to  mentor  her  as  a  chief  petty  officer.  He  saw  her  in  his
department  “all  the  time,  two  of  three  times  a  week.”  (Tr.  38-39)  Applicant  said  their
relationship  was  a  strictly  professional,  mentor-mentee  relationship  and  they  were  on
good terms. (Tr. 50-51, 64)
Applicant  testified  that  on  the  evening  in  question,  the  ship  was  on  “holiday
routine”  on  a  Sunday  evening.  Applicant  and  some  junior  male  sailors  were  watching
football and relaxing. When Sailor S sat down, he said she needed to “pull your pants
up on your ass” and that “your headlights are on” because her nipples were protruding
from  her  shirt.  He  said  he  wanted  her  to  be  mindful  of  her  appearance  around  junior
male  sailors.  (Tr.  39;  51-53)  He  did  not  recall  any  of  the  other  sailors  laughing  or
reacting at the time. (Tr. 54)
Applicant said Sailor S asked if he had any candy, and he had some on his desk
and he reached over to where she was sitting and gave her some. One of her arms was
in a cast. He handed her the candy and she took it. (Tr. 53-56) He denied grabbing her
breast.  He  told  the  NCIS  investigator  that  he  doubted  that  he  accidentally  grazed  her
breast  but  that  it  was  a  possibility.  He  said  he  “never  grabbed  her  [and]  never  did
anything to her physically. I simply handed her the candy.” He said he hit or grazed her
arm that was in the cast. (Tr. 57-62; GE 6 at 15-16)
Applicant  said  that,  afterwards,  Sailor  S  sat  at  the  computer  for  another  30-45
minutes.  He  later  learned  that  she  was  upset  and  went  to  her  division  office  and  was
crying, but she was not upset or emotional when she left his office. (Tr. 62-64)
The  next morning  Applicant  was told by NCIS  that Sailor S had alleged  that he
had  grabbed  her  breast.  He  cooperated  with  the  investigation.  He  was  scheduled  to
transfer to another duty station, but the investigation put the transfer on hold. He denied
going to the emergency room in the hospital with Sailor S. rubbing her hair and calling
her “beautiful.” (Tr. 39-43)
Sailor  S  was  transferred  off  the  ship  within  72  hours  after  she  made  the
allegations against Applicant, per Navy policy. Applicant said he did not want to be seen
as  someone  who  “goes  around  grabbing  on  people,  especially  females.”  He  asserted
that  Sailor  S  had  “character  problems,”  had  twice  been  to  captain’s  mast  herself,  and
had  been  released  from  the  Navy  for  performance  issues.  He  did  not  believe  he  was
being treated  equally  and  fairly,  as  he  felt the  allegations  were  based on  hearsay and
without concrete evidence. (Tr. 43-45, 114)
At captain’s mast, Applicant was asked by the CO about the incident with Sailor
S and he said it was fabricated, and he did not know why she would not have done this.
He  suggested  during  his  testimony  that  it  was  because  she  wanted  to  get  out  of  the
deployment, but he does not know that. (Tr. 63-64)
With  respect  to  Sailor  S’s  allegations about  the  incident  in the  hospital  in  2014,
Applicant said he escorted her to the hospital once because she was on restriction from
a  previous  captain’s  mast.  He  remained  in  the  lobby  for  about  two  hours.  The  doctor
came  out  and  asked  him  if  he  knew  of  any  reason  that  she  would  not  be  able  to  get
underway  (with  the  ship).  He  denied  that  he  visited  her  in  the  hospital  and  was  only
there to escort her as an E-7 as required. (Tr. 65-66; GE 7 at 4-5)
Applicant said he “went into a spiral” of depression after he was discharged from
the Navy after 19 years and two months of service. He said he is a top performer at his
job.  He  also  depleted his  savings  during his  period  of  unemployment  after  leaving  the
Navy. He is currently seeing mental health therapists with the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA). (Tr. 32-33, 74, 99-101, 115-116)
Applicant said that after leaving  the  Navy, he  had no  income  and  was  “obsessed”
with   trying   to   clear  his   name   and   get  his   discharge   status  overturned   (i.e.,  upgraded).
(Tr 32)  He also  said he  was helping  family members financially and  he  took a  large  pay
cut  after   leaving   the   Navy,  from   $76,000   to   $47,000   annually.   He  said  he   had   settled
and  cleared up  about $19,000  of his $31,000  in delinquent debts. (Tr. 33, 36-37, 105-
106)   He  paid  his  lawyer  about  $13,000   to   appeal  the   captain’s  mast   and   to   represent
him during  and after his ADSEP  board proceeding. (Tr. 72-74
Applicant  does not  receive  retirement pay from the  Navy, but he has a  service-
connected disability for which he receives $1,907 a month from the VA, with an annual
cost of living adjustment. His annual salary at his job is $67,815, up from $47,000 when
he was hired. His wife is a nurse, earning about $30,000 annually. They pay household
expenses  jointly.  (Tr.  35-36,  73-77,  108,  117;  AE  K,  AE  P,  AE  Q)  Applicant’s  work
evaluations  reflect  that  he  is  an  outstanding  leader  who  makes  a  significant  positive
impact. (AE M – AE O)
Under Guideline  F, the  SOR  concerns  seven  delinquent debts,  totaling  just  under
$32,000. The  debts are  established  by  credit  bureau  reports (CBRs) in the  record, from
March  2022, June 2021, November  2020, and  August 2023. (GE 2-GE  4, GE  8) (SOR ¶
4)  Applicant disclosed  some debts on  his SCA. (GE  1)
Applicant made payments on most of his SOR debts, but only did so days before
the hearing. He financed these payments with a $19,000 loan, in late August 2023. (Tr.
87-88,  93,  109)  He  plans  to  continue  to  work  to  resolve  his  debts  and  improve
financially.  (Tr. 115)  He  is  to repay  the  loan with  $487 payments  over  60 months.  (Tr.
121; AE L)
SOR  ¶  4.a  ($2,511)  is  an  account  placed  for  collection.  It  relates  to  a  furniture
purchase. Applicant said the furniture began to come apart a month after he bought it,
so  he  stopped  paying  on  the  account.  He  made  a  settlement  agreement  with  the
creditor for $2,260. The account was resolved with a payment in late August 2023. (Tr.
77-80; GE 2 at 4; GE 4 at 3, GE 8 at 4; AE A, AE B)
SOR ¶  4.b  ($2,378)  is an  account that  has been  charged  off. (GE 2  at  4,  GE  3,
GE  8  at  5)  Applicant paid this  account  in late  August 2023. (AE  A, AE G,  AE  H; Tr.  81-
83)
SOR  ¶  4.c  ($1,147  past  due,  total  balance  $3,957)  is  a  financial  account,
probably a loan, money Applicant used for vehicle maintenance and repairs. (GE 2 at 5,
8  at  8)  A  civil  judgment  was  issued  in  April 2022.  Applicant  did  not  appear  in  court  to
defend  himself  since  he  was  overseas.  He  went  to  court  and  paid  the  full  amount  in
August 2023. (Tr. 81-85; AE A, AE F)
SOR  ¶  4.d  ($14,267)  is  a  military  exchange  account  placed  for  collection.  The
account was pending when Applicant separated from the Navy and he was allowed to
defer  payments  until  he  found  employment,  but  he  did  not  follow  up  and  the  account
became past due. He settled the debt for $12,096, in August 2023. (Tr. 85-88; GE 2 at
7, GE 3, GE 4 at 2, GE 8 at 5; AE A, AE C, AE I, AE J)
SOR ¶ 4.e ($5,184) is an account that has been placed for collection. (GE 2 at 7,
GE 3, GE 4 at 2) Applicant believes he took out this loan to provide financial assistance
to a family member with a serious medical issue. He settled the debt for $777 in August
2023. (AE A, AE D, AE E; Tr. 88-90)
SOR ¶ 4.f ($328) is an insurance debt placed for collection. It last appeared on a
CBR in June 2021. (GE 3, GE 5) Applicant admitted the debt in his Answer to the SOR
and  said  he  would  settle  it.  He  said  at  his  hearing  that  he  still  has  insurance  with  the
creditor and is unsure what this debt is about. (Tr. 90-92)
SOR ¶ 4.g ($3,350) is a debt placed for collection by a loan company. (GE 4 at 3)
Applicant  said  in  his  Answer  that  he  intended  to  resolve  it.  In  his  hearing  he  said  he
wants  to  clear  it  up  but  is  not  sure  if  he  owes  the  debt  or  not.  He  last  contacted  the
creditor in May or June 2023. (Tr. 90-92)
In  about  2015,  before  he  left  the  Navy,  Applicant  said  he  got  about  $100,000
from a settlement of what he said was a class- action lawsuit relating to the short sale of
some  real  estate.  He  said  he  used  the  proceeds  to  pay  off  debts,  buy  a  car,  and  for
some other expenses. (Tr. 95-98, 103-107)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  about  $13,000  in  past-due  federal  income
taxes  that  resulted  from  that  windfall.  He  said  he  has  been  on  a  payment  plan  since
2018 and pays $406 a month. At the time of the hearing (August 31, 2023), he had not
filed his 2022 federal income tax return and had not sought a filing extension. He said
he had been sent on an overseas assignment for his job that was extended for several
months. He missed the filing deadline and neglected to speak with his accountant about
it.  (Tr.  93-97,  102-107)  This  is  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  will  not  be  considered  as
disqualifying conduct.
Applicant  has  participated  in  credit  counseling  in  recent  months.  After  the
hearing,  he  provided  monthly  budget  information  detailing  his  VA  benefits  ($1,907),
income  from  his  job  ($2,061  biweekly  =  $4,122)  and  monthly  expenses,  including  his
mortgage  and  the  $487  monthly  payment  on  the  loan  he  used  to  address  his  SOR
debts. (Tr. 108-110; AE L)
Applicant closed his testimony by asserting that if he could go back to September
2015 and do things differently, he would. His work with his counselors has helped him
realize that he has responsibilities. He let his personal pride get in the way. He wants to
upgrade his discharge and also to address his financial shortfalls. He is valued at work
and up to the point of his NJP he was a stellar performer in the Navy. (Tr, 119-120)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through
1.d,  and  1.f,  and  he  denied  the  remaining  SOR  allegations.  (HE  3)  He  admitted  the
allegations in the Amended SOR. He also provided mitigating information. His admissions
are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  maintenance  technician  who  has  worked  for  federal
contractors since 2009. (Tr. 25, 68-70; GE 1) In 1991, he graduated from high school.
(Id.)  In  2005,  he  completed  an  apprenticeship.  (Id.)  From  2017  to  2020,  he  was  self-
employed in addition to his employment by a contractor. (Id.) He has not served in the
military. (Id.) His resume and biography provide additional details about his background
and professional experience. (AE J; AE N)
For  many  years,  Applicant  was  an  elite  athlete  who  competed  in  international
competitions on behalf of the United States. (Tr. 18; AE L) As part of his sports career,
he  met  the  President and  First  Lady  at  the  White  House.  (AE  L; AE  M)  He  ended  his
competition in the sport three years ago. (Tr. 19)
In 2002, Applicant married, and in 2015, he was divorced. (Tr. 19; GE 1) One of
his children was born in 2002, and the other five children were born in 2006 (quintuplets).
(Tr. 20-21; GE 1; AE F; AE O) He has held a security clearance since 2009. (Tr. 71) He
has had access to a military base; however, he never had access to classified information.
(Tr. 26, 44, 71-72)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Criminal Conduct
Applicant said he  does  not currently use  illegal drugs. (Tr. 34, 42; AE  B; AE  M; AE
Q) He said he  ended  his use  of illegal drugs  when  he  was arrested  for driving  under the
influence of alcohol (DUI) in 2019. (Tr. 35)  He first used  marijuana  around 1994 or 1995.
(Tr. 75) In  March 1997, he  was  arrested  for  possession  of drug  paraphernalia.  (Tr. 73;
GE   2)   His  first  driving   under  the   influence   of  alcohol  arrest  was   in   1998.   (Tr.  75)  His
driver’s license  was suspended  for two  years. (Tr. 76) In  2000, he  received  a  ticket for
driving  with  a  suspended  driver’s license. (Tr. 76) In  2002, he  was arrested  for DUI,  and
he  pleaded  guilty to  negligent driving. (Tr. 77; GE  2) He said he  only used  marijuana  once
before 2005. (Tr. 74) Multiple  complaints and  allegations were  made  against  Applicant
from   2008   to   2016   from   a  neighbor,  church  members,   and   family  members   about  his
treatment of his former wife, children, or both;  however, none  of  the  complaints resulted
in  convictions.  (Tr.  78-85)  He  said   he   could  not  remember  half   of  his  arrests  and   “the
years all  run  together.”  (Tr. 77)  As  to  those  making  complaints  about  him,  he  said  “They’re
cop callers. They call them all the time  for nothing.” (Tr. 85)
Applicant had difficulty remembering dates of events and periods of sobriety. He
said,  “I have  no  recollection  of what year was what.  The  years, they’re  written  down.  I
could look at it and read them and know them. But that’s how I’d have to do it. If I’m just
picking it out of the air, out of the sky and trying to remember, I have no . . . recollection.”
(Tr. 98-99) The years were  “just a blur” to him. (Tr. 104) He said the SCAs are a good
source for dates of events. (Tr. 103)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used marijuana with  varying  frequency  from about
April 2005 to about May 2020. He occasionally used marijuana during these timeframes.
(Tr. 28) When he was in international sports competitions, he refrained from marijuana
use for extended periods of times, sometimes for five to seven years. (Tr. 29) He said his
actual marijuana usage  was “very minimal.” (SOR response)  A June 1, 2017 Chemical
Dependency Assessment Summary (CDAS) states Applicant “reports smoking marijuana
for the first time at age 18. Recent use is described as a few puffs three times a week.
His last reported use was February 2017.” (GE 13 at 1)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant used methamphetamine with varying frequency from
about April 2005 to about May 2020.  After his divorce in 2015, he was involved with a
woman  who  introduced  him  to  methamphetamine.  (Tr.  32-33,  106)  He  said  he  used
methamphetamine about two or three times. (Tr. 33, 107) He said the last time he used
methamphetamine was around the 2019 DUI arrest when methamphetamine were found
in  his  pocket.  (Tr.  107)  He  does  not  associate  with  the  woman  who  gave  him
methamphetamine. (Tr. 107)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  Applicant  used  cocaine  with  varying  frequency  from  about
December 1993 to about December 1996. He admitted the alleged cocaine usage, and
said he  was not using cocaine  “with  any frequency.” (SOR response) He has not used
cocaine after 1996. (Tr. 42) A June 1, 2017 CDAS states Applicant “reports occasional
snorting cocaine in his 30’s.” (GE 13 at 1)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant was arrested in about September 2020 and charged
with DUI. SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant tested positive on a urinalysis test in about May
2020 for marijuana, methamphetamine, and amphetamine. Department Counsel moved
to withdraw SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e because  more accurate  information was contained in
Amended SOR ¶ 2.b. (Tr. 112) Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion. (Tr.
112)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  Applicant  used  amphetamine,  methamphetamine,  and
marijuana from about January 2018 to about May 2019 while granted access to classified
information.  He  admitted  the  SOR  allegation,  and  he  said,  “I’m  not  an  everyday  every
month  user.  I  was  hanging  around  the  wrong  person  and  made  bad  choices  on  two
occasions. (SOR response)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  Applicant  received  alcohol  and  drug  counseling  from  about
September 2020, and he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder in early remission and
cannabis  use  disorder  in  early  remission.  (Tr.  38;  GE  11  at  7)  He  received  inpatient
treatment for five or six weeks. (Tr. 30)
Applicant provided urine samples on September 15, 2020, and August 25, 2023,
which  tested  negative  for  the  use  of  illegal  drugs;  however,  he  may  have  received
advance  notice  of  the  tests.  There  was  no  evidence  presented  about  the  detection
windows  for  use  of  marijuana  and  methamphetamine  related  to  these  two  drug  tests.
(SOR response; AE M)
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant engaged in criminal conduct as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.f. He is not currently attending drug or alcohol counseling or therapy. (Tr. 105)
Amended SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that on or about May 20, 2019, Applicant was arrested
and charged with DUI. “The blood test taken incident to [his] arrest revealed the presence
of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), methamphetamine, and amphetamine[s]. [He] pled guilty
to a lesser offense and was placed on probation for two years.” (Amended SOR ¶ 2.b)
The police report for the May 20, 2019 arrest states that the police officer noticed
the smell of marijuana emanating from Applicant’s vehicle; Applicant was not alone in the
vehicle; he asked Applicant when he last smoke marijuana; and Applicant told the police
officer that he “ha[d] a few hits from a joint” about five hours earlier. (GE 8 at 2) Applicant
said  he  had  marijuana  inside  the  vehicle.  (Id.)  The  police  officer  asked  Applicant  how
often he smoked marijuana, and Applicant initially said he smoked weekly, and then he
clarified,  “he  smoked  nightly  before  bed.”  (Id.)  The  police  report  does  not  indicate
marijuana was found in his vehicle. (GE 8)
A September 2, 2020 progress note from his drug and alcohol treatment, states
that Applicant said he “smokes nightly” and “started out smoking weed on weekends then
smokes before bedtime.” (GE 11 at 2, 4) He also indicated he stopped using marijuana.
(GE 11) The treatment summary states:
[Applicant]  reports  smoking  marijuana  for  the  first  time  at  age  18,  and
became  a  regular  user  at  age  20  when  he  would  use  cannabis  on
weekends. He reports his cannabis use to have decreased in the past  10
years. His last reported use was in May 2019 when he would occasionally
use cannabis at nighttime for relaxing. (GE 11 at 6)
Applicant  agreed
the  May  20,  2019  blood
test  results  reflected  THC,
methamphetamine, and amphetamines. (Tr. 38) He tried some drugs shortly before the
arrest. (Tr. 40) He was unsure of the disposition of the charges or allegations. (Tr. 40)
After the successful completion of probation and an eight-hour defensive driving course,
the DUI charge was reduced to negligent driving. (SOR response; AE C; AE D)
Amended SOR ¶ 2.c alleges on about March 23, 2017, Applicant was “arrested for
and charged with two counts of Domestic Violence Assault, 4th degree. [He] entered into
a Pre-Trial Diversion Agreement.” Applicant’s children called their mother and complained
that Applicant was assaulting them. (Tr. 36-37; 45-51, 86-90) His former spouse and her
boyfriend arrived, and a physical altercation between Applicant and the boyfriend of his
former  spouse  and  Applicant’s  former  spouse  ensued.  (Id.)  Applicant  said  his  former
spouse’s boyfriend was the aggressor. (Id.) He accused his former spouse, her boyfriend,
and his children of lying about his behavior. (Id.) The police arrested Applicant. (Tr. 37)
When  the  police  searched  him,  they  found  methamphetamine  in  his  pocket.  (Tr.  47)
Applicant said his girlfriend put the methamphetamine in his pocket. (Tr. 47) He pleaded
guilty  to the two domestic  violence  charges  in  return for having the methamphetamine
charge  dismissed.  (Tr.  55)  He  entered  a  diversion  program.  (Tr.  55)  He  successfully
completed a one-year anger management program and a 10-week parenting class. (Tr.
55; AE E) He is on good terms with his former spouse and children. (Tr. 56)
Amended SOR ¶ 2.d alleges on about October 6, 2014, Applicant was “arrested
for contacting [his] ex-wife in violation of a no-contact order then in place.” Applicant said
he  was  assisting  his  daughter,  and  he  was  falsely  accused  of  violating  the  restraining
order. (Tr. 59-60) The charge was dismissed. (Tr. 58, 61) There is currently no restraining
order on Applicant. (Tr. 61)
Applicant said he   “will  never misuse   substances in   the   future.   This shall   include
use  or possession  of  any illegal  drug  or the  use  of a  legal  prescription  drug  without  a  valid
prescription   or  in  a   manner  inconsistent  with   their   intended   purpose.”  (AE   A)  He
“acknowledge[d]  that  any  future  involvement  or  misuse   is  grounds  for  revocation   of
national security eligibility.” (Id.)
Personal Conduct
Applicant said he filled out five SCAs from 2018 to 2022. (Tr. 62) However, only
two SCAs were admitted into evidence. (GE 1; GE 2) Applicant said he did not report his
involvement with illegal drugs on his SCAs because he hurried through the SCAs, and he
was complacent.  (Tr. 63) He revealed  his arrests to  security when  they occurred. (Tr. 64)
He believed  he  did  not need  to  disclose  information  that  was  previously disclosed.  (Tr.
64)  He said he  was honestly trying  to  disclose  accurate  information  on  his SCAs. (Tr. 65)
Amended  SOR ¶ 3.a  supersedes and  replaces SOR ¶¶  3.a, 3.b, and  3.c.  (Tr. 113)
Amended  SOR ¶  3.a  alleges Applicant falsified  material facts on  his September 30, 2020
SCA when  he  responded  to  the  following  question  in  Section  23  –  Illegal Use  of  Drugs  or
Drug Activity  as follows:
“In the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled
substances?  Use  of  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  includes  injecting,
snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming
any  drug  or  controlled  substance.”  [He]  answered:  “No,”  and  thereby
deliberately failed to disclose that information as set forth in [SOR ¶¶] 1.a
through 1.f. above.
In   his  September  30,   2020   SCA,   Applicant   disclosed   that   in   March  2017,  the   police
arrested   him   for  possession   of   methamphetamine   (one   count),   and   domestic  violence
assault in  the  4th  degree (two counts). (GE 1  at 34) In October 2017, he was found guilty
of  the   two  assaults.  (Id.) The  methamphetamine   charge   was  dismissed.   (Id. at  35) He
completed  two  years of  probation.  (Id.) In  May 2019, he  was arrested  for DUI,  and  he  was
pending   trial,  which  was  scheduled   for   October  2020.   (Id.   at   36)   However,  he   did   not
disclose  any  possession  and  use  of  illegal  drugs which  was  unrelated  to  the  charges in
law enforcement and court records. (Id. at 37-38)
Amended SOR ¶ 3.b alleges Applicant falsified material facts on his April 19, 2018
SCA when he responded to the following question in Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or
Drug Activity as follows:
“In  the  last seven  (7) years, have  you  illegally used any drugs  or controlled
substances?   Use   of   a   drug   or  controlled   substance   includes  injecting,
snorting,  inhaling, swallowing, experimenting  with  or  otherwise consuming
any  drug   or  controlled   substance.”   [He]   answered:  “No,”  and   thereby
deliberately failed  to  disclose  that information  as set forth  in [SOR ¶¶] 1.a
through 1.f. above.
In his April 19, 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed the March 2017, arrest, charges,
and disposition in October 2017, as indicated on his September 30, 2020 SCA, supra.
(GE 2 at 31-32) He disclosed the following criminal charges: his March 1997 possession
of drug paraphernalia charge and conviction; his April 1998 DUI charge and conviction;
and  his  April  2002  “DUI  Possible  paraphernalia”  charge,  which  resulted  in  a  reckless
driving  conviction.  (Id.  at  33-36) He  disclosed  treatment  for  “THC  (Such  as  marijuana,
weed, pot, hashish, etc.)” in January 2005. (Id. at 37) However, he did not disclose any
possession  and  use  of  illegal  drugs  which  was  unrelated  to  the  charges  in  law
enforcement and court records and the 2005 drug treatment records. (Id. at 36-37)
Amended SOR ¶ 3.c alleges Applicant falsified material facts in his responses to
DOHA  Interrogatories,  signed  by  him  on  August  9,  2022,  in  response  to  the  following
question:
“Have  you  EVER … illegally used  any  drugs or controlled  substances?  Use
includes  injecting,  snorting,  inhaling,   swallowing,  experimenting   with,  or
otherwise  consuming   any  drug   or  controlled   substance?”  [He]   answered
for
“Yes,”  but  deliberately  provided   only  partial  dates  of  use
methamphetamine   and   marijuana,  and   deliberately   omitted   [his]  use   of
amphetamines and cocaine.
Applicant  wrote  in  his  response  to  the  DOHA  interrogatory  about  his  history  of  drug
involvement that he used methamphetamine twice in October 2017, and marijuana four
times in May 2019. (Tr. 92; GE 4 at 4) At his hearing, he said he went through the DOHA
interrogatory quickly because he was trying to get the document completed. (Tr. 92-93)
He believed the government already had the information about his drug involvement. (Tr.
93, 96)
For the  falsification allegations, Applicant said, “[i]t’s not done  on  purpose. It’s not
trying to say that I didn’t do anything. I’ve said that I’ve done all of these things. I own up
to  them. I had  a  lapse  of judgment at these  times. I’ve  done  the  wrong  thing, you  know,
when  I’ve done  stuff that I shouldn’t have done. . . . I’m  not trying  to cover it up.” (Tr. 96-
97)
Character Evidence
Applicant loves his job, and he would like to continue in his current employment.
(Tr.  67,  111)  He  received  a  coin  and  a  letter  of  appreciation  from  his  employer  for
voluntarily working overtime, showing initiative. and resolving problems. (Tr. 67-69, 109;
AE P) He is trustworthy, reliable, and responsible. (Tr. 67) He does not believe he is a
risk to security. (Tr. 67)
Applicant provided 12 character statements from friends, family, and coworkers.
(SOR response; AE F; AE O) The general sense of their statements is that he is friendly,
hardworking, honest, and family oriented.
",True
"In   Applicant’s  answers   to   the   SOR  and   the   amended   SOR,  he   admitted   all   the
allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March
1996  to  April  2019  when  he  was  involuntarily  retired  with  a  general  discharge  under
honorable conditions. He was a senior chief petty officer (pay grade E-8) when he retired.
He held a security clearance during his military service.
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  April  to  August  2019.  He  worked  for  federal
contractors from August 2019 to July 2023. The record does not reflect the circumstances
of his termination from employment in July 2023. At the time of the hearing, he had been
offered a job by another defense contractor, contingent on favorable adjudication of his
application to continue his security clearance. (Tr. 18)
Applicant married in April 2000 and has two daughters, ages 22 and 18. He and
his wife have lived separately since December 2021, but they are not legally separated.
(Tr. 14-15) He attended college from July to September 2008 but did not receive a degree.
(GX 1 at 10-11; Tr. 15-16)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to
the point of intoxication, from about May 2017 to at least January 2022. Applicant admitted
this allegation in his answer to the SOR. At the hearing, he testified that he was drinking
every night during this period and that he was “getting close” to drinking every night to the
point of intoxication. (Tr. 25).
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of
an  incident  that  led  to  nonjudicial  punishment  for  sexual  assault  in  February  2018,  an
incident leading to a charge of assault and battery on a family member in August 2020,
and an incident leading to a charge of assault and battery on a family member in October
2021. These allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions in his answer to the
SOR.
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  that  Applicant  was  arrested  for  abusive  sexual  contact  in
October  2017  and  that  the  arrest  occurred  in  the  United  States.  Although  Applicant
admitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR, I doubt that he fully understood what
he was admitting, because when he was asked at the hearing to describe what happened,
he described the sexual assault alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b, which occurred in May 2017, while
he was assigned overseas. (Tr. 19) The FBI arrest record reflects an arrest that occurred
in the United States in October 2017, but it does not list the offense that was the basis for
the arrest. (GX 3) There is no documentary evidence in the record reflecting the basis for
this arrest. I conclude that the part of SOR ¶ 2.a that alleges an arrest is established, but
the part alleging that the arrest was for abusive sexual contact is not established by his
admissions in his answer to the SOR or any evidence in the record.
SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  that  Applicant  received  nonjudicial  punishment  in  February
2018 for sexual assault in violation of Article 120, Uniform Code of Military Justice. The
assault occurred in May 2017. Applicant and group of fellow sailors were at a party, and
Applicant was intoxicated. He came up from behind a female sailor, hugged her, touched
her breast, and asked her if she would go to bed with him. Applicant appeared before his
commanding  officer,  was  found  guilty  of  a  sexual  assault,  and  received  nonjudicial
punishment  of  a  forfeiture  of  $2,618  of  his pay.  In  March  2018,  he  was  referred  to  an
administrative separation board, which determined that he should be retained in the Navy.
Shortly after Applicant was punished, he was transferred to another command. In
March 2019, he was notified that he was required to retire. He retired in April 2019 and
received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  (AX  A)  The  Certificate  of
Release  or  Discharge  from  Active  Duty  (DD  Form  214)  recites  that  the  reason  for
separation was “sufficient service for retirement.” (AX A) The DD Form 214 reflects that
during  his  military  service,  he  received  the  Good  Conduct  Medal  (six  awards),
Outstanding Military Volunteer Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal
(three  awards),  the  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  Commendation  Medal,  two  letters  of
appreciation  and  commendation,  and  various  service  medals  and  qualification  badges
and ribbons.
Applicant testified that his marital problems began after his retirement. While on
active duty, he was deployed frequently, and it was not until he was at home for a while
that he realized that his wife and a neighbor were drinking heavily and using drugs during
the  day.  He  believed  that  they  had  been  drinking  and  using  drugs  for  a  couple  years
before his retirement. (Tr. 40)
Applicant  attributed   all  the   domestic  violence   incidents   to   his  heavy  drinking,
followed  by  arguments  with  his wife.  He  testified  that  the  incident alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.c
occurred  in  August 2020, when  he  was working  nights and   came  home  at  about  11:30
pm. He  testified  that his wife  and  her friend  had  been  “getting  wasted  all  day.” He started
drinking  and  began  arguing  with  his wife. His wife  claimed  that  he  pushed  her, and  he
claimed  that he  pushed  her away when  she  was screaming  “in  his face.” His wife  called
the police, and  they  told  him, “they got to  take  somebody,” and  he  was arrested. (Tr. 26-
27)
The domestic incident in October 2021, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, was another instance
of heavy drinking, arguing, and fighting. Applicant’s wife accused him of throwing a beer
can at her. Applicant’s daughter called the police, and they arrested Applicant for assault
and  battery on  a  family  member. (Tr.  29) At  a  court hearing  a  couple  of  months  later,
adjudication was deferred, conditioned on good behavior for two years. (Tr. 30)
Applicant testified that he stopped drinking heavily after he and his wife separated.
He testified that he now limits himself to a couple beers while watching football and no
longer drinks hard liquor. He has not received any formal counseling or treatment for his
alcohol consumption. He is not involved with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or any similar
organization. (Tr. 33-34, 42)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  sole  Guideline  J  allegation,
(SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  noted  that  the  case  remained  pending  in  court.  He  denied  the  four
debts  alleged  under  Guideline  F  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d)  noting  that  they  had  all  been  paid.
His  admission  is  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is  47  years  old.  He earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in 2017.  He has worked
as an  instructor with  a defense  contractor  on  a  military base  since  February 2019,  and
he has had  several  prior jobs in the  defense  industry. After eight years on  active  duty in
the  Marine  Corps  (1994-2002), he  served  in  the  National Guard and  Reserve  from  2003
until July 2016, when  he  retired  as a  staff  sergeant  (E-6). He deployed  to  Iraq  in  2004-
2005   and   again  in   2009-2010. He  worked  as  a  police  officer   from   2014-2017.   His  first
marriage   ended   in   divorce   (1999-2004).   He  remarried   in  2009.  They  have   two   young
children.   (GE  2;  Tr.  12   36-40,  61-62)   He  has  held  a   clearance   since   his  time   in  the
military,  and  was  most  recently  granted  a  clearance  in  2015,  without  any  security
violations. (Tr. 12, 85-86)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  concerns  four  delinquent  debts,  totaling  $11,790.
The  debts  are  established  by  an  April  2021  credit  report.  (GE  4)  (SOR  ¶  2)  Applicant
denied all of the debts, and said they had been paid. (Answer; Tr. 43)
Applicant provided an e-mail about his attempts to contact his creditors. (AE A).
He attached photographs of letters from two of the creditors (AE B, AE C) along with his
credit  score  as  of  June  2023.  (AE  D)  I  was  unable  to  print  a  “clean  copy”  of  these
exhibits for the case file, but they are part of the record in e-mail form, and they can be
reviewed on appeal if needed.
SOR ¶ 2.a ($7,283) is a charged-off consumer credit account. Applicant e-mailed
a photo of a letter from the creditor, documenting that the account was paid and settled
in December 2021.  The  account number on the letter is the same account number for
this debt in GE 4. (AE A) This was a personal loan. It was the first debt he addressed
after ending his contract with a debt consolidation firm, discussed below. He settled the
debt for 35% of what he owed, and he paid it off. (Tr. 52-55)
SOR ¶ 2.b ($1,640) is a charged-off credit card account with a department store.
Applicant  e-mailed  a  photo  of  a  letter  from  the  creditor,  documenting  that  the  account
was paid and settled in July 2021. (AE B; Tr. 55)
SOR ¶ 2.c ($1,171) is a charged-off credit card account with a bank. SOR ¶ 2.d
($1,696)  is a  charged-off  credit  card  account with  a  bank.  Applicant  said  he  paid  both
debts in 2021 but was not able to document it. (Tr. 32-33; 55-57)
When   asked   how he   got   into   debt,  Applicant   explained   that  he   wanted   to   get   a
better handle  on  his finances and  cut  down  on  high  interest  rates.  He learned  about a
debt  consolidation  program  through  an  acquaintance. He signed  up  for the  program  in
January  2020. The monthly fee  was $700  a  month. Applicant had  seven  or eight debts
in the  program. He  was told  to  stop  paying  on  his debts so  the  service  could  negotiate
settlements.   This  led   to   a   significant  drop   in   his  credit  score,  from   about  700   to   about
500. The  company  also  kept  27%  of any negotiated  settlement  amount.  He  believes he
got  bad   advice,   and   he   thinks  he   got   scammed.   Applicant   was   not   happy   with   the
program’s  progress,   so   he   paid   all   of  the   SOR  debts  himself   by  the   end   of  2021,   well
before  he  got the  SOR.  His credit score has improved  to  682  as of June  2023. He  said
he  pulls his credit  score  “daily”  through  a  credit monitoring  service.  (GE  2; Tr. 31-35, 44-
57, 63; AE D)
Applicant’s  finances are  now in good  condition. He has no  charged-off debts or
debts in collection and his expenses are current. He used money from his 401(k) plan to
pay  some  of  his  debts.  Taxes  were  taken  out  when  he  withdrew  the  money.  He  has
several thousand dollars in savings and checking accounts. (Tr. 57-59)
Applicant  earns  an  $80,000  annual  salary.  He  also  has  a  100%  service-
connected  disability  and  receives  $4,500  a  month  in  disability  compensation  from  the
VA.  He  no  longer  works  at  his  friend’s  nightclub.  (Tr.  39-43)  His  wife  is  a  registered
nurse. She works full time and earns $65 an hour. (Tr. 60)
Applicant was given the opportunity to submit post-hearing documents, such as
an  updated  credit  report,  but  did  not  do  so.  The  April  2021  credit  report  (GE  4)  is  the
only one in the record.
In  February  2020,  Applicant  was  working  as  a  security  manager  (bouncer)  at  a
friend’s nightclub. (GE 2 at 2) He disclosed on his SCA that one evening that month, he
had a physical altercation with an “unruly patron,” D, who refused to leave the premises.
He said that D “took an aggressive stance attempting to fight me and I went hands on
causing  him  to  have  a  hard  landing  on  a  take  down.”  D  “is  now  said  to  be  paralyzed
from the neck down.” Applicant was later charged with aggravated battery. He said he
believes this is because of the nature of the injuries, and because Applicant used to be
a police officer. (GE 1 at 31-33)
Applicant  provided  further  detail  in  his  background  interview.  (GE  2)  He  said  D
had been arrested and banned from the premises by police two months beforehand for
fighting. (GE 1, GE 2) On the night in question Applicant was on duty at about 4 am. He
was  told  by  another  security  guard,  W,  that  D  was  on  the  premises.  They  agreed  to
leave him alone and let the police deal with him in the parking lot once he left. (GE 2)
About  15  minutes  later,  another  security  guard,  C,  was  in  an  argument  with  a
female patron, and was trying to get her to leave. The female patron was married to D,
but Applicant was not aware of this. D was in the corner with several other patrons. D
challenged  Applicant  with  an  “aggressive  position”  towards  him.  Applicant  was  aware
that D had assaulted other security officers. (GE 2)
Another  security  guard,  B,  grabbed  D’s  arm  and  said,  “Hey,  man,  let’s  get  you
out of here.” D then swung his arm at B and hit his arm away. Applicant then punched D
and D fell down. When D got up, he put his hands into fists, so Applicant put him into an
arm  hold.  D  fell  down  and  hit  his  head  and  was  knocked  unconscious.  Applicant
dragged D out into the parking lot where police could render him assistance. (GE 2)
Applicant was questioned by police at the scene and the next day. He was told
he did nothing wrong. Days later he was told to come to the police station and explain
what happened and he did so. He was then arrested and detained in county jail for four
weeks  until  he  could  post  bond.  Applicant  believes  D’s  family  made  complaints  to  the
police about Applicant getting special treatment as a former police officer. (GE 2)
Applicant  believes  that  D  and  his  family  are  accusing  Applicant  of  being  the
aggressor,  that  D  was  trying  to  leave,  that  Applicant  attacked  D unprovoked,  rammed
his  head  into  the  bar,  and  stomped  and  kicked  him.  Applicant  said  that  the  family  is
claiming that D is now a quadriplegic as a result. They have filed suit against him and
the  club,  claiming  several  hundred  thousand  dollars  in  medical  expenses,  damages,
and lost wages. (GE 2)
Applicant said he was acting in self-defense. He said he has used the arm hold
numerous  times  before  in  prior  law  enforcement  positions  and  no  one  has  fallen  as  a
result.  He  said  in  his  interview  that  information  available  to  him  is  that  D  is  a  known
gang member, he has been jailed numerous times for gun, drug, and assault charges,
and has a violent history of fighting security guards and police officers. He also believes
D’s  alcohol  level  was  “two  times  over  the  legal  limit”  on  the  night  in  question.  (GE  2)
These assertions are uncorroborated.
A police report narrative from that evening indicates that D and his wife got into
an  altercation  with  club  security  after  D’s  wife  had  an  argument  with  another  female
patron. D approached security in an aggressive manner. Security asked D and his wife
to leave, but his wife did not want to. Security then grabbed D’s arm to escort him out. D
swatted  the  officer’s  hand  away.  “Security  took  that  as  an  act  of  aggression  and
preemptively  struck  [D]  before  he  could  strike”  the  officer.  D  had  consumed  alcoholic
beverages prior to this incident. (GE 3)
D  attempted  to  snatch  his  arm  away  from  security  “to  escape  while  being
escorted. At that time, an arm bar take down was used to subdue [D] where he landed
headfirst  onto  the  establishment[‘s]  floor.”  Surveillance  footage  showed  that  D  “had
gone limp upon contact with the floor. Security then [dragged D towards the door, where
he was placed outside.” He was placed in a chair and an ambulance was called. “There
was  visible  swelling  and  bleeding  on  [D’s]  forehead  and  lips.”  While  waiting  for  the
ambulance,  D’s  wife  could  be  heard  screaming  and  cursing.  An  ambulance  took  D  to
the hospital. (GE 3)
D was  arrested and  charged  with  disorderly conduct.  The  report  lists  D and his
wife  as  “Suspects.”  A  female  patron  is  listed  as  “victim”  and  Applicant  is  listed  as
“Other.”  The report  states, “[t]his is the second  time  that deputies know of  that [D  and
his wife] have caused an incident” with the security staff at this club. In a prior incident,
D  was  arrested  for  disorderly  conduct  at  the  same  establishment.  The  police  report
noted  that  Applicant  was  6  feet  tall  and  weighed  230  pounds.  D  was  listed  as  5  feet,
seven inches tall, and weighed 140 pounds. (GE 3) The security officer(s) involved are
not identified in GE 3.
Applicant  was  later  arrested  and  charged  with  aggravated  battery.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)
Other  than  GE  3,  there  is  no  police  report,  indictment  record,  or  other  documentary
evidence  providing  details  of  the  incident  relating  to  Applicant  as  a  suspect,  charged
individual, or defendant.
Applicant’s  criminal  defense  attorney  made  certain  representations  about  the
current  status  of  the  case  and  about  its  procedural  history.  He  said  that  the  case
remains pending. He has asked for a dismissal. He essentially asserted that it is difficult
in the current political climate to avoid criminal charges when a former police officer (like
Applicant)  is involved. The case  was  passed  to  several  prosecuting  attorneys  before an
indictment was brought in  September 2022  but there is no  pending  court date. (Tr. 64-
68, 75-76)
The  attorney  confirmed  that  the  alleged  victim  has  brought  a  civil  suit  against
Applicant.  There  are  multiple  witnesses  to,  and  videotapes  of,  the  incident.  (None  of
them  are  in  evidence  here).  He  believes  that  police  officers  who  are  familiar  with  the
incident  (on  scene  or  having  viewed  the  videos)  would  regard  Applicant’s  actions  as
“textbook.”  The  other  party  has  a  prior  record.  The  attorney  believes  he  has  a  strong
case. He expressed doubt as to the severity of the alleged victim’s injuries. (Tr. 68-70)
Applicant  confirmed  he  is  being  sued,  along with  the  county,  the  nightclub,  and
the  property  owner.  He  was  not  working  as  an  off-duty  police  officer  at  the  time.  He
believes  he  was  charged  because,  since  he  was  a  former  county  police  officer,  the
department did not want to be seen showing favoritism towards him. (Tr. 70-72)
Applicant  affirmed  what  he  said  previously about  the  incident,  both  on  his  SCA
and in his background interview. He was in a working capacity, and said, “I did my job.”
He  does  not  believe  it  should  have  gone  this  far and  turned  into  criminal  charges.  He
believes the victim was banned from the property two months prior and chose to return.
Applicant said his only intent “was to get him out the door, not to injure him. So it was a
freak accident. He went down wrong and landed the way he did.” (Tr. 80-81) Applicant
denied committing the crime as alleged and as charged. (Tr. 82)
Applicant  had  an  alcohol-related  driving  offense  in  the  mid-1990s.  He  said  he
was found not guilty. He was charged with domestic violence in about 2000 but he said
the case was dismissed. (Tr. 83-84)
Applicant  attested  to  his  long  service  in  the  military,  with  a  clearance.  He  has
taken many  security  courses.  (Tr.  31) He  wants  to  keep  his  clearance and his career,
and he wants to protect his assets and his reputation. (Tr. 85, 93-94)
",True
"Applicant is a  39-year-old employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  served  on  active
duty   in  the   U.S.   military  from   2003   until  he   was   discharged   with   a   general   under
honorable  conditions  discharge   in   2009.  He   has  worked   for  his  current  employer  or  a
predecessor   company   on   the   same   contract   since   2009.   He   seeks   to   retain   a   security
clearance,  which   he   has  held   since   he   served   in  the   military.   He  is  a   high   school
graduate.  He  has never married. He has one  child.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  at 22-23, 27-28, 46-
47; GE 1)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  criminal  conduct.  He  was  arrested  in  1999,  when  he
was about 14 years old, and charged with felony burglary, graffiti, and criminal mischief.
He  and  some  friends  broke  into  an  elementary  school,  stole  several  items,  and  spray
painted  a  building.  In  2000,  when  he  was  about  15,  he  was  charged  with  terroristic
threat  and  deadly  conduct.  He  shot  a  mail  truck  with  a  BB  gun.  He  was  placed  on
probation. (Tr. at 23-26; GE 6)
Applicant submitted a security clearance application in December 2002 when he
was going through the enlistment process.  He did not report his  criminal conduct as a
juvenile because his recruiter told him it was not required. (Tr. at 12, 26-27; GE 9)
Applicant  had   alcohol-related   disciplinary  problems  in  the   military.  In   January
2005, he  drove  to the front gate of a  military installation  while drunk. He was arrested  for
driving   under  the   influence   (DUI).  He  admitted   that  he   was  intoxicated,   and   his  blood
alcohol   concentration   (BAC)   was  about  .2%.  He   pleaded   guilty  in   front   of  a   federal
magistrate   and   was  sentenced
in  an   alcohol
education/treatment program  as directed, and  a  $25  special  assessment.  (Tr. at 13,  28-

to   probation,   participation
Drinking  was  prohibited  while  Applicant  was  deployed  to  Bahrain  in  2008.  In
August 2008, he drank with some other servicemembers and got into an altercation. He
was required to attend a two-week outpatient substance abuse program. (Tr. at 13-14,
31-33; Applicant’s response to amended SOR)
Applicant  had  another  alcohol-related  incident  in  December  2008.  He  was
drinking  and  got  in  a  fight  outside  a  bar.  He  was  discharged  with  a  general  under
honorable conditions discharge as an alcohol rehabilitation failure. (Tr. at 14-15, 33-35;
Applicant’s response to amended SOR)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  December  2014  and  charged  with  driving  while
intoxicated  (DWI).  He  admitted  that  he  was  drinking  and  “doing  donuts”  on  the  beach
when his truck got stuck in the sand. He refused a breathalyzer test. He was accepted
into a pretrial diversion program in August 2016. The charge  was dismissed in August
2017  following  the  completion  of  the  pretrial  diversion  program.  (Tr.  at  16,  21,  36-38;
Applicant’s response to amended SOR; GE 7)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
October  2015.  (GE  5)  He  did  not  report  any  of  his  criminal  charges  under  any  of  the
questions, including questions that asked:
In the  past seven (7) years  have  you  been  arrested  by any police  officer,
sheriff, marshal or any other type  of law enforcement official?
In  the   past  seven  (7)  years   have   you   been   charged,  convicted,  or
sentenced of a crime in any court?
Are you currently on trial or awaiting trial on criminal charges?
Have   you   ever   been   charged   with   any  felony  offense?   (Include   those
under the  Uniform  Code  of Military  Justice  and  non-military/civilian  felony
offenses)  and
Have you  ever been charged with  an  offense involving  alcohol or  drugs?
Applicant testified  that  he  did not  intentionally  provide  false information  on  the  SF
86.  He   stated   that   he   put  “no”   to   every  question   under  the   assumption   that  the
government  already knew everything  about him. (Tr. at  15-16)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  January  2021.  The  police  report  indicates  that  three
men  reported  that  they  worked  in  a market in  an  area  where burglaries  had occurred.
An individual later identified as Applicant pulled his vehicle into the back of the market.
They were suspicious and followed him home after he left. They went up to him after he
pulled  into  his  driveway.  They  described  Applicant  as  belligerent  and  yelling,  and  he
then  pulled  out  a  shotgun  and  loaded  it.  One  of  the men  reported  that  Applicant  said,
“I’ve  got  something  for  you,”  and  pointed  the  shotgun  at  him.  Applicant  then  fired  the
shotgun at the man’s vehicle, damaging a tire with the birdshot. Another man stated that
Applicant  pointed  the  shotgun  at  him,  kicked  him,  and  struck  his  truck’s  tail  lamp  with
the shotgun, damaging the vehicle. (GE 2)
Applicant  was  charged  with  three  felony  counts  of  aggravated  assault  with  a
deadly weapon. He was required to wear an ankle monitor. In June 2021, an indictment
was  filed;  Applicant’s  attorney  entered  an  appearance;  a  $40,000  bond  was  set;  and
Applicant had an arraignment hearing. He was admitted into the state’s veterans court
program  in  September  2022  and  received  a  pretrial  diversion  program  for  24  months.
He  handwrote  a  non-judicial  confession  as  follows:  “Got  chased  to  my  house  by  3  or
more individuals – I was intoxicated and when things [calmed] down, they walked away
and I shot their truck with my shotgun because I was upset.” (Tr. at 18; GE 2-4)
Terms  of  the  pretrial  diversion  program  include  that  Applicant  report  to  a
supervision officer at least once a month; not commit any crime; not travel out of state;
abstain  from  alcohol  and  illegal  drugs;  undergo  screening  and  evaluation  and  any
alcohol  or  drug  rehabilitation  program  ordered  by  the  probation  department;  complete
an  anger  management  program;  submit  to  a  random  urinalysis;  perform  180  hours  of
community service; observe a curfew from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.; grant permission for
any probation or pretrial services officer to enter his dwelling at any time to search the
premises; and pay $850 as a veterans treatment court fee. If he successfully completes
the program, the charges will be dismissed. (Tr. at 18, 44-45; GE 2)
Applicant’s  current  version   of  the   January  2021   events  differs  from   the   three
men’s  statements   and   from   his  own  non-judicial  confession.  On   March   20,  2023.  he
wrote  in his response to  DoD  interrogatories:
On   1/12/21   I   went duck  hunting   for the   majority  of  the  day and   then   to   a
restaurant to  have  dinner. After dinner I drove  to  a  fish  market  and  marina
to  visit a  friend  who  had  a  houseboat at the  back of  the  small  property. At
this point I  was unaware that the  property had  been  burglarize[d]  recently.
I  drove   my   truck  to   the   back  of  the   property  where  the   houseboat  is
located,  I   realized   the   person   I   was   there   to   see   was  not   at   the   boat.   At
this  point  it  was   dark  out,   I  turned   my   truck   around   to   leave   and   drove
back the way  I came.
Upon   getting   back  to   the   parking   lot   three   men   came   out  of  the   building
and   continued   to   walk  towards  my  truck  in an   aggressive  manner   yelling
as I  was leaving  the  property.  I could  see  the  men  get in  their  trucks and
start to follow me  as  I drove  away.  I  started  to  speed up  as  they got  closer,
the  situation  turned  into  an  aggressive and  fast chase, I  started  to  fear for
my safety.
They  continue[d]   to   chase   me   back  to   my   house   and   to   my  driveway
where I  exited my  vehicle and  went  inside  my  garage  with my shotgun  that
I had  in my truck from  duck hunting. Two  trucks pulled  up  to  my driveway
and  house,  one  of the  men  got  out [and] walked  up  my driveway and  into
my  garage   in   an   aggressive  and   threatening   manner.  At  that  point  I  was
afraid  for  my  life   and   my  family  inside   the   house.  I  loaded   the   shotgun
pointing   it  at  the   man   in  my  garage,  yelled   at  the   man   to   get  out   of  my
garage  and  off  my property. He turned  around  and  walked  back down my
driveway as I  follow[ed]  from  a  distance. At this point I was  yelling  at the
men   to   leave,  I   was   scared,   the   circumstances   had   my  adrenaline
pumping  giving me shakes.
That  is  when   the   gun   that  was  pointed   down   misfired   and   hit  one   of  the
truck[’]s  wheels  a   few   feet  away   at   the   end   of   my  driveway.   One   of   the
other  men  got out of another truck  [and] chased  me  back to  my house, I
felt  threatened   and   kicked   at   the   man   yelling   at   him   to   leave.  I  hit  the
taillight with  the  butt  of  the  shotgun  and  broke  the  taillight.  The  men  drove
away in  their  trucks  and  shortly  after  the  police  arrived.  (I  have  broken  one
long   paragraph   down   into   four   shorter  paragraphs   for   ease   of   reading.)
(GE 4)
Applicant’s  testimony  was  not  completely  consistent  with  his  above  statement.
He stated that he went duck hunting earlier in the day and had some drinks, but he was
not  intoxicated  during  the  incident.  He  stated  that  he  was  duck  hunting  for  10  to  12
hours  and  had  “[n]o  more  than  maybe  one  [drink]  per  hour.”  He  stated  the  shotgun
discharged accidentally when one of the men started fighting with him. He admitted that
he  hit  one  of  the men’s  truck  with  the  butt  of  his shotgun, and  he  “maybe  punched  or
kicked  one  of  the  other  guys.”  He  stated  that  he  wrote  in  the  non-judicial  confession
“what the lawyer told [him] to write down.” (Tr. at 16-18, 38-43)
The DoD learned of the 2021 arrest through the Continuous Evaluation Program.
On  February  5,  2021, the  DoD  reported  the  arrest  in  the  Defense  Information  System
for  Security  (DISS)  and  requested  an  incident  report  on  the  arrest,  with  supporting
documentation. (GE 8)
Applicant  submitted an  SF 86  in July 2021.  (GE 1)  He did not report any of his
criminal charges under any of the questions, including questions that asked:
In the past seven (7) years have you been arrested by any police officer,
sheriff, marshal or any other type of law enforcement official?
In  the  past  seven  (7)  years  have  you  been  charged,  convicted,  or
sentenced of a crime in any court?
Are you currently on trial or awaiting trial on criminal charges?
Have  you  ever  been  charged  with  any  felony  offense?  (Include  those
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and non-military/civilian felony
offenses)
Have  you  ever  been  charged  with  an  offense  involving  firearms  or
explosives? and
Have you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?
Applicant denied that he intentionally provided false information on the SF 86. He
stated his attorney told  him that he did not have to report the 2021  arrest because he
had  not  been  charged  or  convicted.  He  did  not  have  a  good  explanation  for  why  he
failed  to  divulge  the  arrest.  Additionally,  he  had  not  been  convicted,  but  he  had  been
charged  and  an  arraignment  hearing  was  held  in  June  2021,  the  month  before  he
submitted the SF 86. He stated that he forgot about the older  charges; he thought the
government already knew about the information; and the 2014 DUI had been dismissed
and it was past the seven-year reporting period. (Tr. at 18-22)
I did not find Applicant credible. I find the police report of the 2021 arrest to be far
more reliable than Applicant’s recent versions of the events. His recent descriptions of
the  January  2021  events  are  not  logical;  there  are  inconsistencies  between  his
response  to  interrogatories  and  his testimony;  and  his  response  to  interrogatories  and
testimony are both inconsistent with his non-judicial confession  (three distinct versions
of how the shotgun was fired). I also find that he intentionally provided false information
about  the  incident  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  when  he  stated  the  shotgun
“misfired.” I further find he intentionally provided false information on the 2015 and 2021
SF 86s (discussed further in the analysis).
Applicant submitted letters attesting to his excellent job performance and strong
moral character. He is praised for his attention to detail, leadership, respect for others,
work ethic, and trustworthiness,  He is described as  “a family-oriented person  who has
always presented himself with levelheadedness and grace.” (AE A-C)

"Applicant is 68 years old. He holds two bachelor’s degrees. He earned them from
different U.S. universities. He married in 1981 and divorced 2020. The couple separated
in  2015  and  they  initiated  divorce  proceedings  in  2016.  There  was  one  child  of  the
marriage, who is now in her thirties and has developmental issues. Applicant remarried a
citizen of [Country C] in 2021 and he has a stepchild from this marriage, who recently
turned 18. His current wife resides in a property he owns in [Country M] and he spends
about half of his time there. His stepchild also resides in his [Country M] property. His
current  wife  is  a  homemaker  and  both  she  and  the  stepchild  are  in  the  process  of
immigrating to the United States. (Tr. at 20-23.)
Applicant  held  his  first  security  clearance  in  the  mid-1980s.  He  held  a  security
clearance for about 30 years when it lapsed in 2018 due to employment issues. His area
of  work  involves  negotiating  international  agreements.  His  work  required  international
travel. (Tr. at 27-31.)
Applicant  admits  all  of  the  Guideline  J  allegations  with  explanations,  which  are
cross alleged under Guideline E, SOR 3.a. The Guideline J and cross alleged Guideline
E allegations are supported by GE 1 – GE 4, GE 13, and GE 15 – GE 17.
SOR 1.a, Applicant was charged in December 2015 with domestic violence and a
protective order was issued against him. In his Answer, he admits the allegation and he states
an attorney  advised his wife to file a protective order against him in retaliation for him filing
one against his wife the day prior. (GE 2; Tr. at 46-47, 110.)
SOR 1.b, Applicant was charged in June 2016 with driving under the influence (DUI)
and convicted of DUI in August 2016. He cites  as mitigation that he has not had another
incident in the past six years. (GE 3.; Tr. at 56-57.)
SOR 1.c, Applicant was arrested in November 2016 for driving on  a suspended
license and pled guilty to the offense in 2017.  (GE 4.) He offered an explanation in his
Answer that the interlock system was unreliable, so in October 2016 he decided to “take
a  period  of  license  suspension  in  its  place.”  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  he
requested a license  suspension, but he admits that  in November 2016 he drove to his
condominium  to  prevent  his  ex-wife  from  taking  his  remaining  personal  belongings,
including roughly $10,000 in gold and silver bars. (Tr. at 62, 64.) He was subsequently
cited for driving on a suspended license. He offered in his Answer that his concern was
justified because he later had his ex-wife charged for breaking into the condominium, but
he then dropped the charges on the basis he felt sorry for his ex-wife.
SOR 1.d, a  warrant for Applicant’s arrest was issued  in June  2018, in [State  N], for
felony extradition  as a  fugitive  from  another state.  He was  unaware  at  the  time  he  was
traveling   that   a   warrant  had   been   issued.   He  had   to   return   to   the   United   States   from
Country M  to  accept  the  charges.  The  charges were  dismissed  without leave  in July 2018
when  he  turned  himself in to  the  seeking  state. (GE 15  at 4, 8.)  As an  explanation  in his
Answer,  he   denies   he   fled   the   country  to   avoid  trial   on   charges  of   altering   documents
related  to  property in Country M,  as his ex-wife  claimed, and  had  only gone  to  [Country
M] to  deal with their property in Country M. He  acknowledges he  was convicted  of felony
fraud  but  notes he  did  receive the property in  Country M in divorce. (Tr. at 65-74.)
SOR 1.e, Applicant was charged in 2018 with felony fraud and received probation
before  judgment.  In  his  Answer  he  explains  he  entered  an  Alford  plea  and  received  a
$150  fine,  40  hours  of  community  service,  and  an  agreement  the  matter  would  be
expunged, which it was. (GE 13 at 1-3; AE I; AE J; and AE K.) He states he would now
have  contested  the  charges  had  he  known  they  would  be  discoverable  in  the  security
clearance application process. (Tr. at 69-70; GE 15 at 1.)
Applicant  admits  all  of  the  Guideline  F  allegations  with  explanations,  which  are
cross alleged under Guideline E, SOR 3.a. The Guideline F and cross alleged Guideline
E allegations are supported by GE 1, GE 2, and GE 9 – GE 12.
Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that, as of March 2017, Applicant filed
five bankruptcy petitions. He filed two Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions. The first in March
2017 (SOR 2.b; GE 6), and the second in November 2017 (SOR 2.c; GE 7). The March
2017 filing was dismissed in October 2017 for failing to complete required forms and the
November 2017 filing was dismissed for failure to attend a meeting of creditors. He filed
three  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petitions.  The  first  in  November  2003  (SOR  2.a;  GE  5)
involved about $90,000 of debt, which was discharged in February 2005. (Tr. at 78.) He
noted he was granted a top-secret clearance in 2005 with a bankruptcy on his record.
The second in February 2018 (SOR 2.d; GE 8.), which was dismissed in April 2018 for
failure  to  provide  the  required  documents,  had  issues  surrounding  the  signatures
involving the application. (Tr. at 84-90.) The third in November 2018 (SOR 2.e; GE 9),
was discharged in February 2019. He stated when got himself “to a point where [he] was
eligible for bankruptcy and did do a Chapter 7, which cleared some debts.”  (Tr. at 80.)
For the bankruptcy filings after 2003 (SOR 2.b-SOR 2.e) he offered the same explanation;
that  when  his  wife  left  their  home  in  December  2015  she  dumped  all  financial
responsibility,  and  refused  to  work,  so  in  order  to  put  themselves  in  the  best  position
financially he pursued bankruptcy. (Tr. at 80; Answer at 4.) He testified “after the marriage
and  the  relationship  was  gone,  I  just  said  to  hell  with  everything.  I'm  just  going  to  let
everything go and move on with my life and establish a new life for myself.” (Tr. at 81.)
In two separate court actions Applicant was obligated to pay over $168,000. The
first court action (SOR 2.f) was a judgment in the amount of $72,600 entered against him
for wrongfully converting funds held for his disabled adult daughter. (GE 10 at 3; GE 14
at 19; AE K at 16.) He admits the allegation and acknowledges comingling her accounts
with his investment accounts and that he sustained losses he could not cover. He testified
he never provided the court with “a sufficient explanation. And I can’t provide a sufficient
explanation here today.” (Tr. at 96.) He is saving money to be able to pay off this debt.
(Tr.  at  96-97,  99-100.)  The  second  court action  (SOR  2.g)  involves  unpaid  alimony  of
$96,000.  (GE  14  at  2,  19.)  AE  K  states  his  former  spouse  was  granted  an  amount  of
$147,500 and any unpaid amount would be converted into a monetary judgment. (AE K
at 16.) The SOR alleges a $96,000 alimony award. In his Answer he admits the allegation
and offers that all “alimony including all back alimony is being faithfully paid in accordance
with the court order. (Answer at 5; Tr. at 103.)
Applicant admits SOR 2.h, which declares despite his financial situation alleged in
SOR 2.a through 2.g, he provided approximately $54,000 in financial support to foreign
nationals  he  dated  between  2015  and  2020.  In  his  Answer  he  explains  that  after  he
separated, he worked through a marriage service which specialized in placing American
men  with  foreign  women.  He  notes  he  had  two  long-term  relationships,  the  second  of
which resulted in marriage, and that he was working “the majority of time” and could afford
to help support these women. (Answer at 6; Tr. at 106.)
Applicant did not admit or deny the Guideline E allegation in  his Answer. He did
admit to allegations that comprised SOR 3.a. I applied those facts discussed above to the
Guideline E allegation, which I consider as a denial based on his nonresponse.
Applicant in his Answer and testimony attributed the allegations in the SOR directly
or indirectly to events surrounding his divorce from his wife of 34 years. He described the
divorce as a “five-year acrimonious, destructive, intense, bitter, and litigious divorce.” (Tr.
at 14.) He insists he has changed his circumstances for the better now that he is no longer
in a bad marriage and has happily remarried. (Answer; Tr. at 102.)

"Applicant  is  a  24-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  working  as  an
inspector. He has worked for his current employer since 2017. He seeks to reestablish
his security clearance. He earned his high school diploma in 2017 and has completed
some apprentice courses but has not obtained a degree. He previously held a security
clearance from December 2017 until it was suspended in September 2021. He is single,
lives with his partner, and they have three young children. (GE 1 at 12, 14, and 21; Tr.
17-18.)
In  Applicant’s Answer to  the  SOR, he  admitted  the  three  Guideline  H allegations.
SOR  ¶   1.a,  that  he   purchased   and   used   marijuana   with   varying   frequency  from   about
January  2012  through January 2019.  SOR ¶ 1.b,  that he purchased  and  used  marijuana
as set forth  in subparagraph  1.a  after being  granted  access to  classified  information  in
2018.  SOR ¶  1.c, that  in  January  2019  he  was arrested  and  charged  with  (1) sell, give,  or
distribute  more  than  one-half ounce, but less than  five  pounds of marijuana, a  felony,  and
(2) carrying  concealed  weapon. He pled  no  contest to  a reduced  drug  charge  of sell, give,
or distribute  less than  one-half ounce  (misdemeanor). He  was  sentenced  to  12-months'
confinement (11  months suspended), and  three-years'  probation, which  ended  in October
2022.
Applicant stated he started to use marijuana when he was 13 and from 2012 to
2017 he smoked marijuana on a daily basis (Tr. at 18-19.) He stopped smoking marijuana
from March 2017 to about February 2018, which was around the time he was hired by his
employer, but he could not recall why he stopped. (Tr. at 20.)  In his security clearance
interview  he  told  the  investigator  he  stopped  to  prepare  for  attending  college  and
apprentice school where he knew he would be required to pass a drug screening. (GE 3
at 6.) After February 2018 he described his usage as “more of a weekly basis…not every
day.” (Tr. at 20.) He estimated he would probably purchase about an ounce of marijuana
a week. (Tr. at 20-21.) When he resumed smoking marijuana in February 2018 he held a
clearance;  had  been  granted  to  classified  information,  and  he  acknowledged  in  his
testimony it was not allowed. (Tr. at 21-22; GE 1 at 27.) He explained his duties generally
and generally what his security clearance had allowed him access to inspect until it was
suspended. (Tr. at 22.)
In January 2019, Applicant was pulled over and the officer smelled marijuana in
the vehicle. A search of the vehicle found about seven ounces of marijuana in a glass
cistern, which he purchased for about $1,000.  (Tr. at 24, 25-26; GE 5.) He denied any
intentions to sell the marijuana. (Tr. at 26.) He told the investigator he would purchase
enough  to  avoid  the  long  drive.  (GE  3  at  5.)  The  felony  charge  was  reduced  to  a
misdemeanor as  part of  a  plea  agreement. He  served  the  unsuspended  portion  of  his
sentence on weekends, paid a fine, and served probation for three years. (Tr. at 24.) The
carrying  a  concealed  weapon  charge  was  dismissed.  He  claimed  that  he  was  legally
carrying the weapon. He testified; “trying to do my due diligence in reading it upon the law
on how to carry my weapon. And, I believe I had it contained legally. It was in a bag that
was zipped up that I couldn’t reach in the back of the vehicle.” (Tr. at 27.) It was inside
the bag with the marijuana. (Tr. at 34.) The weapon was not registered in his name but
stated it was a gift to him  from his brother. (Tr. at 27, 34; GE 3 at 7.) He reported the
incident to his supervisor and no action was taken by his employer. (GE 3 at 7.)
Applicant  stated  he  stopped  using  marijuana  after  January  2019  because  the
arrest was “like a reality check, you know, how fast things can go wrong.” (Tr. at 28.) He
explained to the investigator that he has his children to live for now and cannot risk  being
fired because of illegal drugs. He does not want his children around illegal drugs. (GE 3
at 7.) He has not attended any substance abuse courses. He no longer associates with
people who use marijuana. He has never failed an employer drug test. (Tr. at 29.) There
are  no  further  terms  on  his  conviction.  (Tr.  at  39.)  He  stated  in  response  to  DOHA
interrogatories he had no intention of further use of marijuana. (GE 3 at 13.)
Applicant in his Answer denied SOR ¶ 2.a. Department Counsel queried Applicant
about the denial and pointed out this was a cross-allegation of SOR ¶ 1.c. In response to
Department Counsel’s question, Applicant responded he is not disputing the Guideline J
allegation. (Tr. at 28.)
SOR ¶  3.a cross-alleges the SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c, which Applicant denies but
admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c.  The  underlying  facts  were  discussed  above  under
Guideline H. I applied those facts discussed above to SOR ¶ 3.a.
Applicant denies SOR ¶ 3.b, that he: Falsified material facts on a  Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF-86) executed on August 18, 2021, by answering “No”
to:
Section  23-Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or
Controlled Substances: In the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used
any drugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance
includes  injecting  snorting  inhaling,  swallowing  experimenting  with  or
otherwise consuming any drug or controlled substance?
He testified  he  believed  it was a  clerical error and  “when  [he] first lied  about
it in 2017. When  [he] went back and  when  [he] went to  refill  this out, a  lot  of things
[he]   didn’t  change,   and   [he] believe[s]  this is   one   of  the   pages [he]   missed,  just
skipped through.” (Answer and  Tr. at 30-31.) He believed  he  was being  open and
honest  in   his  application   when   discussing   the   discrepancy  with   the   security
clearance investigator. (GE 3  at 6.)
Applicant denies  SOR ¶ 3.c, that he: Falsified material facts on an  SF-86 dated
August 18, 2021, by answering “No” to:
Section  22-Police  Record  Police  Record  (EVER):  Other  than  those
offenses already listed, have you EVER had the following happen to you?
Have  you  EVER  been  charged  with  an  offense  involving  firearms  or
explosives?.”
Applicant reported the incident in the drug section of the SF-86. (GE 1 at 27, 34.)
He testified “I didn’t state something, but I believe it was stated in another question, and
that’s why I didn’t restate it.” (Tr. at 16-17.)
Applicant admits SOR ¶ 3.d, that he: Falsified material facts on an SF-86 executed
on September 26, 2017, pertaining to “Section 23-Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity”
when he stated “No” to whether he had illegally used drugs or controlled substances in
the last seven years. (Answer and Tr. at 30-31.) He acknowledged the lie in his testimony,
“When I filled out the one in 2017, I did lie knowingly about my marijuana usage. I was
18, freshly coming out of high school, and really didn’t know  what I was getting into when
I done that one.” (Tr. at 16.) His reason for not revealing his marijuana use at the time; “I
thought it would affect my employment.” (Tr. at 31.)
Applicant very credibly described the difference between the man he was in 2019
and the man he has become. Four years ago, he would come home, smoke marijuana,
and go to sleep. He would get off work, smoke and sleep until about 1800, 1900, 2000,
then get up and eat, maybe smoke again, and just do nothing, lay around the house all
day. (Tr. at 38.) He is now a father of three, his oldest child was born in August 2020. He
normally works during the week from 0500 to 1300. When he gets home, he takes care
of the yard and works on his truck because the children are napping until 1600. When
they wake up he is with the children making them a snack and taking them to an activity
like a jump park, painting, or playing in the sprinkler and after that it would be dinnertime.
After dinner there is some more playtime and then it is time to  “change diapers, [and] get
ready to go to bed.”  (Tr. at 38.) Typically, the weekend is spent just trying to keep  the
children  busy  and  “not  making  a  mess  inside  the  house.”  (Tr.  at  36)  He  offered  as
examples attending group children’s readings at a local bookstore or going to the beach.
His hobby is working in the driveway on his two vehicles. Aside from a “cold beer on a hot
day” otherwise he does not drink. (Tr. at 37-38.)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  welder  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  April
2018.  He  has  worked  as  a  welder  for  various  contractors  since  November  2009,  with
periods of unemployment between contracts. He received a certificate in welding from a
technical school in September 2013.  He attended a community college for about three
months  in  2016  but  did  not  receive  a  degree.  He  married  in  March  2023  and  has  no
children. (Tr. 20). He has never held a security clearance.
The SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.o) and failure to file a federal
income tax return for tax year 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.b). The delinquent debts are reflected in
credit reports from June 2021, June 2022, and March 2023. (GX 4, 5, and 6) The evidence
concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.e:  student   loans   referred  for  collection  of   $9,059;   $4,186;
$3,863;  $3,392;  and  $1,926.
Applicant testified that these debts were incurred while he
was  attending  technical  school  and  community  college.  (Tr.  21)  All  of  the  loans  were
delinquent before the COVID-19 deferment of collections because of Applicant’s erratic
employment, which consisted of multiple short-term, low-paying jobs. (Tr. 30) In October
2023, Applicant was approved for the Fresh Start program, and the loans were taken out
of default status and transferred to a loan servicer. On October 13, 2023, Applicant was
notified that his monthly payments of $239.40 would begin on November 7, 2023. (AX F)
SOR  ¶   1.f:   payday   loan  referred  for  collection  of   $1,062.   Applicant  admitted
that this debt was valid, but that he had taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 36)
SOR ¶  1.g: telecommunications debt  referred for collection of  $807. Applicant
submitted proof of a payment of $1,537 to a collection agency collector for the original
creditor on October 13, 2023. (AX P)
SOR ¶  1.h: collection  account  for $462. Applicant provided no evidence of action
on this debt.
SOR  ¶¶   1.i-1.n:   medical   debts   referred  for  collection   of   $411,   $215,   $121,
$115, $87,  and $50. All these debts have been delinquent since 2017. Applicant testified
that  he  made  payment  agreements  for  these  debts  in  September  2023,  with  the  first
payments  due  in  October  2017.  The  payment  agreements  were  telephonic  and  not
reduced to writing. (Tr. 33-34) There is no documentary evidence in the record showing
that any of these debts are resolved or are being resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.o:  debt   to   fitness   club  referred   for  collection  of   $160.  Applicant
testified that he had forgotten about this debt and has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr.
39)
SOR ¶  1.p: failure  to  file  federal income  tax  return for  tax  year  2018.  Applicant
admitted that he failed to file his federal returns for 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. He filed
all the past-due returns in February 2023. He estimated that he owes about $40,000 in
federal taxes. (Tr. 43-45) He submitted evidence that he had a payment agreement with
the IRS to pay $390 per month by direct debit. (AX E) He submitted bank records showing
that he had made the agreed payments in July, August, September, and October 2023.
(AX R, S, T, and U)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  indebted  to  two  insurance  companies  and  had
taken no action to resolve these debts, which were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 47-48)
After the hearing, he submitted evidence that he had resolved both debts. (AX I) I have
considered the evidence of these unalleged debts for the limited purpose of  evaluating
his evidence of mitigation and in my whole-person analysis.
Applicant  submitted  evidence  that  he  has  engaged  a  credit-repair  company  to
assist  him.  (AX  H)  The  debts  being  handled  by  the  credit-repair  company  include  the
collection agency for five medical debts alleged in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, and
1.n). He also submitted evidence of a payment to a medical group not alleged in the SOR
(AX N) and payments to several creditors not alleged in the SOR. (AX I through M)
In June 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery on a
family  member,  abduction  by  force  and  intimidation,  strangling  or  wounding  causing
injury, and destruction of property of a value less than $1,000. The incident occurred when
Applicant decided to leave a cohabitant. His cohabitant did not want him to leave, and
she started hitting him. No injuries were inflicted. (Tr. 49-50) As they were fighting and
wrestling,  his  cohabitant’s  daughter  arrived   at  the   scene,  and   they  stopped   fighting.
Applicant  found   out  three   days  later  that  his   cohabitant  had   filed   a   criminal  complaint
against  him.   (GX  7   at   4)  The   assault   and   battery   charge   was   dismissed,   but   he   was
referred  to  a  battery intervention  group  and  placed  on  supervised  probation  for two  years.
(GX 3  at 17-18) The  abduction and  strangling  charges were  nolle  prosequi. (GX  3  at 19-
22). Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  destroying  a  cellphone.  He  was sentenced  to  12  months
in jail, suspended for 12  months, and placed on  supervised  probation  for two  years. (GX

"Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged that in August 2020, Applicant was charged
in State A with felony malicious wounding, felony use of a firearm in the commission of a
felony, misdemeanor brandishing of a firearm, and misdemeanor assault and battery on
a family member. Further, it was alleged that in March 2022, he was arrested in State B
and extradited to State A, where he pleaded guilty to the two misdemeanor charges and
was sentenced to 12 months in jail with 10 months suspended (SOR 1.a).
Also under Guideline  J, the  SOR alleged  that  Applicant was  incarcerated  in  State
C between  December 2007  and  November 2009  for multiple burglary offenses (SOR 1.b);
that  in  November  2002,  he   was  arrested   in  State   C  and   charged   with   burglary  and   a
parole  violation  (SOR 1.c); that in  November 2001, he  was  arrested  and  charged  in  State
C with  felony  burglary,  resisting  and  officer,  and  simple  battery  (SOR 1.d);  that in  February
2001,  he   was  arrested   and   charged   in  State   C  with   felony   forcible   rape,   to   which   he
pleaded  guilty and  served  six months in jail (SOR 1.e); and  that between  1989  and  2000,
he   was  arrested   and   charged   on   multiple   occasions   with   various  crimes,  including
burglary, theft, and  forgery (SOR 1.f).  In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant admitted  each
of these allegations and  provided  a  lengthy explanation of the  events addressed  in  SOR
1.a.  (FORM, Items 1  and 3)
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant intentionally made false official
statements to a government investigator during a November 21, 2022, personal subject
interview (PSI) regarding the events addressed in SOR 1.a (SOR 2.a). He admitted this
allegation  with  an  explanation,  a  plain  reading  of  which  indicates  he  reaffirms  his
statement to the investigator. Accordingly, I have interpreted his response as a denial of
the requisite intent to falsify. (FORM, Items 1 and 3)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant owes $15,754 for 11 delinquent
or past-due debts. (SOR 3.a –  3.k) In response, he admitted each of those allegations
and claimed he has paid the debts at SOR 3.a and 3.k, and that he is resolving the debts
at SOR 3.d and 3.g. (FORM, Items 1 and 3)
In  addition  to  the   facts   established  by  Applicant’s admissions,   and  based  on  my
review of the information  presented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  53  years  old.  He  is  being  sponsored  for  a  clearance  by  a  defense
contractor in State B, where he has lived since October 2021. He was born in State C in
1970.  State  and  federal  criminal  records  obtained  during  Applicant’s  background
investigation show that since early 1989, when he was 18 years old, he has been arrested
and  charged  more  than  30  times  with  various  criminal  offenses,  including  burglary,
assault, use of a weapon in the commission of a felony, forgery, trespassing, and forcible
rape. It further appears that he has been incarcerated for criminal offenses for periods
ranging from two months to  almost two years. The  Government’s information  supports
the allegations of multiple criminal charges presented in SOR 1.a – 1.f. (FORM, Items 1,
3, 5 – 9)
Applicant’s most recent arrest arose from his conduct in August 2020 in State A.
He assaulted his former girlfriend by hitting her in the head with a handgun. He did so
after becoming angry when she told him she was seeing someone else, even though they
had parted ways eight months earlier. A photo included in the police report compiled on
the night of that incident shows the victim with blood on her face and shirt. A responding
police  officer  observed  that  there  was  a  gash  in  the  victim’s  head  that  would  require
medical treatment and that the victim appeared concussed. Applicant had left the scene
before police arrived and was subsequently determined to be a fugitive. He was arrested
in State B in March 2022 and extradited to State A where the two felony charges listed in
SOR  1.a  were  entered  as  nolle  prosequi,  and  he  pleaded  guilty  to  the  misdemeanor
charges. All but two months of a 12-month jail sentence were suspended. (FORM, Items
4 – 7, 9, and 10)
When Applicant listed the August 2020 incident in his e-QIP, he stated only that
he was charged with simple assault and battery, and that he was released after he was
arrested. He further stated that the victim initiated the incident and that he was arrested
“because  she  was  a  female  and  she  started  it.”  During  his  PSI  with  a  government
investigator, Applicant discussed this event and characterized it as a “cat fight” in which
the  victim  started  slapping  him,  so  he  slapped  her  back.  He  claimed  that  he  only
accidentally  scratched  her  in  the  process  and  may  have  drawn  a  little  blood.  In  his
response to SOR 1.a, he repeated this version of events. (FORM, Items 3 – 5)
The  Government’s  information  and  Applicant’s  SOR  admissions  support  the
allegations under Guideline F. Applicant did not list any adverse financial information as
required by e-QIP Section 26 (Financial Record). Nonetheless, he admits the allegations
that  he  owes  the  debts  listed  in  SOR  3.a  –  3.k.  In  his  PSI,  he  stated  that  he  started
experiencing financial difficulties in about July 2020 after a contract he was on ended. In
response to the SOR, he claimed he had paid the debt at SOR 3.a. Information included
with his response to DOHA interrogatories coupled with a recent credit report provided by
Department Counsel supports his claim of payment. However, he also claimed to have
paid the debt at SOR 3.k and that he was resolving SOR 3.d and 3.g. He did not provide
information that supports those claims or that indicates the current state of his personal
finances. (FORM, Items 3, 5, 11 – 13)

"In Applicant’s answer, he admitted some of the SOR Guideline J allegations, with
explanations, (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.f) and denied others (SOR ¶ 1.d). He admitted the
Guideline  G  allegations,  with  explanations,  consistent  with  his  Guideline  J  answers
(SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.c). His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful review of the testimony, pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He married in 2021, after a 15-year courtship. He has
no children. He is currently employed by a government contractor, where he has worked
for approximately two years. He holds two associate degrees and a bachelor’s degree.
This is his first application for a security clearance. (Tr. 6, 20, 28; GE 1; AE K-L)
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged with alcohol-related
criminal offenses  on  six  occasions:  (1) in  November 2003,  he  was charged,  convicted
and  sentenced  for  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI);  (2)  in  March  2011,  he
was charged with DUI and refusal to take a chemical test for alcohol, for which he was
convicted and sentenced; (3) in August 2011, he was charged with DUI, which charge
was  dismissed;  (4)  In  December  2013,  he  was  charged  with  intoxication  and  criminal
trespass,  for  which  he  was  convicted  on  the  intoxication  charge  and  sentenced;  (5)  in
September 2017, he was charged with public intoxication, which charge was dismissed;
and (6)  in  June  2020, he  was  charged with  intoxication, which  charge  was reduced to
disorderly conduct as part of a plea in abeyance. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f)
Under Guideline  G, the SOR:  (1) cross-alleged  the  Guideline J allegations above;
(2) alleged that Applicant consumed  alcohol to  the  point  of intoxication,  at  various  times,
from   2003   to   September  2022;  and   (3)  alleged   that  he   was  court-ordered   to   attend
substance-abuse   outpatient  counseling   from   August   2011   to   about  February  2012.
(SOR ¶¶  2.a-2.c)
Applicant began drinking alcohol when he was 18 or 19 years old, in about 2001
to 2002. He did this to socialize with friends. Starting in about 2010, he would consume
about a six-pack of beer or a few shots at social gatherings. During this time, he would
typically  drink  to  intoxication.  He  would  become  intoxicated  after  drinking  four  to  six
beers,  or  three  glasses  of  wine.  He  became  louder  and  less  inhibited  when  he  was
intoxicated.  During  the  end  of  his  college  days  in  2015,  he  was  drinking  8-12  beers a
day, four to five days a week. In 2022, he was consuming one to  two glasses of wine
one to two times a week, and one to two bottles of wine over the weekend with his wife.
He testified that his current consumption of alcohol is “a few beers, here and there on
weekends with my wife.” (Tr. 20; GE 2)
The details of his arrests and alcohol consumption of concern follow:
June 2020  Intoxication Charge  (SOR ¶ 1.a)-Applicant had an argument with his
fiancée  (now  wife)  and  left  his  home  to  go  drink  at  a  bar.  During  his  statement  to  an
investigator,  he  claimed  he  drank  three  beers  and  two  shots  in  a  three-hour  period.
During his hearing testimony, he stated he drank five to six beers on that occasion. He
became loud and disruptive and the police were  called. He was arrested and taken to
jail,  where  he  was  released  the  next  day.  A  plea  agreement  was  reached  and  the
intoxication  charge  was  dismissed  and  he  pleaded  to  a  disorderly  conduct  charge,
which  was  held  in  abeyance  for  a  year.  He  completed  the  year  without  any  violations
and the disorderly charge was dismissed. (Tr. 33-34; GE 1-2; SOR answer; AE I)
September  2017   Intoxication  Charge   (SOR  ¶  1.b)-During  his  background
investigation,  Applicant  admitted  being  at  a  bar  from  about  10  pm  to  11  pm.  He
consumed  two  to  three  pitchers  of  beer.  He  left  the  bar  and  someone  from  the  bar
called the police registering a noise complaint. The police arrived and gave him a ride to
his  home.  He  was  later  cited  for  intoxication.  The  citation  was  dismissed  for  lack  of
evidence. (GE 2; SOR answer)
December   2013   Intoxication   and  Criminal  Trespass   (SOR   ¶  1.c)-During  his
background investigation, Applicant admitted that he had been drinking 8 to 10 beers at
his home when he decided to walk to a local store to purchase more beer. At the store,
he encountered people outside who he believed were selling drugs. He confronted the
people and eventually the police were called. When the police arrived, he was arrested
for being intoxicated. He pleaded no contest to the intoxication charge and the criminal
trespass  was  dismissed.  He  was  also  ordered  to  undergo  an  alcohol  evaluation.  He
participated in an evaluation in April 2014, and no program referral was recommended.
(GE 2; SOR answer; AE H)
August  2011   DUI   (SOR  ¶   1.d)-Applicant  denied  this  arrest  in  his  answer  and
there  is  no  discussion  of  this  incident  during  his  background  interview.  An  FBI  report
supports that this incident related back to his March 2011 arrest, infra, and was not an
independent charge. I find for Applicant on this allegation. (GE 2-3; SOR answer)
March 2011  DUI  and Refusal  of Chemical Testing  (SOR ¶ 1.e)-Applicant and a
friend went to a club in March 2011. Applicant drank several beers and had some shots
before  leaving  the  club.  Applicant  was  driving  and  was  stopped  immediately  upon
leaving  the parking  lot by  law  enforcement. Applicant  was  told  the reason for  the  stop
was because he spun his tires coming out of the parling lot. He refused a breathalyzer
test at the scene and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of DUI. Blood was later
drawn from him. The results of the blood test are not in the record. He was charged with
DUI and pleaded guilty to the charge  in July 2011. His other charges were dismissed.
The court treated this conviction as a second  DUI for sentencing purposes because of
his November 2003 DUI,  described  infra. He  was  sentenced to  180 days  jail  time, but
170 days were suspended. He was also sentenced to one year of probation, fined, and
ordered  to  attend  alcohol  counseling.  He  participated  in  a  group  alcohol  counseling
program from August 2011 to February 2012. No treatment records were made apart of
this hearing record. He provided two negative urinalysis tests that he took as part of the
counseling  program.  Applicant claims he  was  not  diagnosed  while in  the  program and
that no recommendations were made about his future alcohol consumption. (Tr. 23-24;
GE 2; SOR answer; AE E-G)
November  2003  DUI  (SOR ¶ 1.f)-At 1:30 am, Applicant was driving home from a
friend’s house where he had been drinking alcohol. He was under the legal age to drink
alcohol at  the  time.  His  car  was  stopped  by law  enforcement  for  a  traffic violation.  He
was  given  a  breathalyzer  test,  which  produced  a  result  of  .16  percent  blood  alcohol
content  which  is  over  the  legal  limit.  As  a  minor,  no  amount  of  alcohol  in  his  blood
system  is  permitted.  He  admitted  drinking  approximately  32  ounces  of  beer  at  the
gathering.  He  was  charged  with  DUI  and  pleaded  guilty  in  January  2004.  He  was
sentenced  to  30  days  jail  time,  suspended;  probation  for  one  year;  and  fined.  (GE  2;
SOR answer; AE D)
Applicant also testified that he has not attended any additional alcohol treatment
programs  other  than  described  supra.  He  also  claimed  that  he  abstains  from  drinking
alcohol  periodically  for  about  60  to  90  days  at  a  time,  but  no  specific  dates  were
provided. He did not provide any corroboration for these claimed periods of abstinence.
His  wife  provided  a  written  statement  and  claimed  that  he  “rarely  indulges  in  alcohol,
especially not to excess. . . .” He admitted that he last drank alcohol three weeks before
his  hearing  and  that  he  was  last  intoxicated  from  alcohol  between  one  and  two  years
ago  when  he  drank  a  few  beers  and  had  a  few  shots  of  whiskey.  His  background
investigator  noted  that  when  he  contacted  Applicant  in  early  2022  to  set  up  the
interview, Applicant told the investigator that he was finishing up his workday and was
working  on  his  second  bottle  of  wine.  He  was  working  from  home  that  day.  The
investigator noted the call was at 3:30 pm. At his hearing, Applicant testified that the call
was after his work hours, but he admitted drinking that much wine that day. He was not
disciplined for the incident by his employer. (Tr. 21, 26-28, 31, 36, 39-40, 47; GE 2; AE
V2-V3, V4)
Applicant  does  not  attend  Alcoholics  Anonymous  meetings  (AA).  He  does  not
believe that the AA program is a good fit for him. He relies on support from friends and
family to  refrain  from  making  alcohol-related  mistakes.  He  drinks alcohol less frequently
because   he   is  trying   to   live  a  healthier   lifestyle.   His  wife   “keeps   him   in  check.”   In
September through  October  2023, he  attended  six  counseling  sessions with  a  licensed
clinical social worker  (therapist). This counseling  was provided  through  his employment.
He admitted  the  sole  reason  he  sought this  counseling  was  due  to  having  this hearing.
The   therapist   provided   a   letter  stating   that   Applicant   is  doing   well  in   therapy.   He  also
stated  that he  was pleased  Applicant  made  the  decision  to  remain alcohol free. (Tr. 20-
21-22, 24-25, 37; AE  W)
Applicant presented six character letters from family, friends, a former coworker,
and his current team supervisor. They describe Applicant as intelligent, responsible, and
someone who is dedicated, hard-working, and trustworthy. Several commented how he
has  improved  himself  over  the  years.  His  current  supervisor  recommends  that  he  be
considered  for  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  also  provided  two  certificates  he  was
awarded. (AE M-N, P-S, U-V2-V3)

In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all of the SOR allegations. His
SOR admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. (Item 1) After a thorough review of
the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Guideline J –  Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges:   On  January  27,  2020,  you  were  arrested  and  charged  with
Solicitation of a Prostitute, Disorderly Conduct, Attempting to Engage in Prostitution, and
Engaging  in  Prostitution.  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  Solicitation  of  a  Prostitute.  He  was
ordered to complete a Human Trafficking Course and to complete one year of supervised
probation. He completed a four-hour Prostitution Prevention Class on August 15, 2020.
(Item 1; Item 4; Item 5; Item 3 at 9)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges:  From  October  1998  to  January  2020,  Applicant  solicited
prostitutes with varying frequency, likely around 100 times total.  He estimates he solicited
and hired prostitutes approximately 100 times. (Item 3 at 6-7, 10)
On February 13, 2023, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator conducting
his  background  investigation.  During  the  background  investigation  interview,  he  was
questioned about his arrest for Solicitation of a Prostitute in January 2020. He responded
to an online advertisement from a woman. He was told by the woman to meet her at a
hotel.  His  intent  was  to  pay  the  woman  to  have  sexual  intercourse  with  him.  Once  he
arrived at the hotel, he texted the woman who provided him the room number where she
was  located.  He  agreed  to  spend  30  minutes  with  her.  As  he  was  taking  his  coat  off,
several  police  officers  came  into  the  room  and  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  the
offenses as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. He spent the night in jail and was released the following
morning. His girlfriend is aware of the arrest and is not very happy about it. In response
to  DOHA  interrogatories  dated  July  18,  2023,  Applicant  reviewed  a  summary  of  the
interview  and  indicated  that  he  found  it  to  be  accurate  after  adding  some  additional
information. (Item 3 at 6-10)
Applicant  told  the  background  investigator  that  he  searched  for  and  hired
prostitutes online approximately 3-4 times a year over the past 10 years. His late wife was
aware that he was hiring prostitutes during their marriage and was not pleased with his
conduct. He was looking for prostitutes because he was looking for a good time and he
wasn’t getting  what  he  needs at  home. He  understands  soliciting and hiring prostitutes
was illegal. He competed a human trafficking course which was required by his employer.
(Item 3 at 10) In his response to interrogatories, dated August 21, 2023, he estimates he
solicited and hired prostitutes approximately 100 times. (Item 3 at 6) In his Response to
the SOR, he claimed he took a break from soliciting prostitutes during the period of 2008
to early January 2020. (Item 1)
Applicant voluntarily sought counseling with a therapist who is an expert in sexual
problems. He met with the therapist once a week. The duration of the therapy sessions
is unclear. (Item 3 at 10) He did not provide more details about his therapy. He did not
obtain a letter from his therapist explaining the extent of the therapy and whether he made
progress during his therapy sessions.
Applicant has held a security clearance on and off since 2001. He indicated on his
January 2023 security clearance application that his security clearance was suspended
in May 2009 after a polygraph. He admitted during a post-polygraph interview that he had
conducted illegal activities in the past but has stopped the illegal activities. (Item 2 at 41-
44) In his August 2023 response to interrogatories, he mentioned the illegal activities he
disclosed during the post-polygraph interview was related to the solicitation and hiring of
prostitutes. (Item 3 at 7)
In his response to the SOR, Applicant indicates his probation was terminated after
one month because he had no prior arrests or convictions, and he promptly completed
his court-ordered human trafficking course.  He states he has not solicited prostitutes in
three and half years. He is in the process of requesting his arrest be expunged from his
records. He does not intend to solicit and hire prostitutes in the future. (Item 1, Response
to SOR)

"Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer or a predecessor thereof since about January 2011. He earned a
high school diploma in 2004 and has taken some college courses but has not earned a
degree.  In  2004,  after  high  school,  he  enlisted  with  the  Navy  and  was  on  active  duty
until  2008,  when  he  was  discharged  for  failing  to  report  for  duty  because  he  had
“alcohol on his breath.” He was “forced out of the Navy” for alcohol-related reasons. He
claimed  he  received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  He  has  been
married since 2008. He has three children, ages thirteen, nine, and one. (Tr. 22, 25-29,
35-36, 71-72; GE 1, 2)
From May 2007 until at least March 2020, Applicant regularly consumed alcohol
in excess and drove while intoxicated. During this timeframe, he normally drank two to
three times per week and again on the weekend. He estimated that he often drank 10 to
15  beers  over  a  two-hour  timespan  and  then  drove  home.  He  has  been  arrested  and
charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) four times between May 2007
and  March  2020.  Police  arrested  him  and  charged  him  with  DUI  in  May  2007,  April
2014,  July  2016,  and  March  2020.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  was  convicted  of  the  2007
DUI,  pleaded  guilty  and  received  a  deferred  adjudication  of  the  2014  DUI  charge,
pleaded nolo contendere  to the 2020 DUI charge, and the disposition of his 2016 DUI
charge  is  unclear.  Regardless  of  the  outcome  of  the  charges,  he  was  driving  while
intoxicated on all four occasions he was charged with DUI. He was involved in vehicular
accidents on two of these occasions, in which he collided with a parked car (2014 DUI)
and  a  pole  (2007  DUI).  With  respect  to  the  2014  DUI,  he  claimed  that  he  had  being
drinking heavily, passed out at a friend’s house, and then “woke up” while driving his car
right before getting into an accident. (Tr. 22-25, 37-73; Answer; GE 1-3)
After  his 2020  DUI,  Applicant  knew he  had  to  address  his  alcohol consumption
issues. About a month after his 2020 DUI arrest, Applicant sought and received mental-
health  and  alcohol-related  counseling  from  a  neural  therapist  until  about  December
2021.  He  stopped  attending  this  counseling  because  he  could  not  afford  it.  He
contemplated  attending  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings  but  has  not  done  so
the  aforementioned  mental-health  and  alcohol-related
because  he  considered
counseling  to  be  sufficient.  He  has  access  to  alcohol-related  treatment  that  he  can
afford  through  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  but  he  does  not  know  how  to  begin  the  process
and  has  not  looked  into  it.  After  his  2007  DUI,  the  Navy  required  him  to  attend  a
Substance   Abuse   Rehabilitation   Program   (SARP),  and   an   Alcohol  Dependency
Program  (ADAPT). He  completed  both  of these  requirements.  (Tr. 34-35,  47-50, 63, 70-
71, 75-78; Answer; GE 1-3)
Applicant also has been attending marital counseling for an unspecified period of
time. While he claimed that he was never told to abstain from alcohol or that he suffered
from an alcohol use disorder, he did abstain from alcohol for about six months after his
2016  DUI,  and  from  March  2020  until  December  2023.  During  his  personal  subject
interviews in late 2021 and early 2022, Applicant told a DOD investigator that he vowed
to stop drinking and had no desire to start drinking again. However, in December 2023,
he had a glass of wine with his wife to celebrate his wedding anniversary. He also had a
glass  of  wine  on  New  Year’s  Eve  2023.  He  acknowledged  that  he  should  not  be
consuming  alcohol  but,  paradoxically,  is  not  sure  whether  he  will  abstain  in  the  future
because he  does not have an urge to drink and thinks he  is in control. He claims that
counseling  has  taught  him  to  use  more  healthy  coping  mechanisms.  He  also  claimed
that  he  has  not driven  after  consuming  alcohol  since  his  2020  DUI.  (Tr.  29-31,  49-62,
73-82; Answer; GE 1-3)
Applicant acknowledged that he has made poor choices involving alcohol in the
past, but he believes that he has remedied the underlying issues that caused them. He
claimed that he had undiagnosed and untreated mental health issues that contributed to
his  overdrinking.  Sadly,  within  a  six-month  period  prior  to  his  2016  DUI,  his  sister,
grandmother, and best friend passed away. He claimed that these losses contributed to
his mental-health issues, which resulted in him drinking more. He claimed that he does
well at work, has never shown up to work intoxicated, and has been entrusted to be a
union representative for about 700 people over the last eight years. (Tr. 22-25, 29, 35,

Alcohol Consumption  and Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  under  Guideline  G  that  in  about  July  2022,  Applicant  was
arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). He pleaded guilty,
and in March 2023, he was sentenced to three years of probation and to attend six months
of first offender alcohol program. SOR ¶ 2.a cross-alleged the conduct in SOR ¶ 1.a under
Guideline J.
Applicant does not have any other arrests or convictions. (Tr. 25, 27) No friends or
family have expressed a concern to him about his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 29) He rarely
consumed alcohol because his employer required him to work in a country that does not
permit alcohol use. (Tr. 30) When he consumed alcohol in July 2022, he had not had any
alcohol to drink for six months. (Tr. 31) He claimed he drank one beer and two hard drinks
in a bar. (Tr. 31, 36) His ticket for the DUI offense states he weighs 235 pounds; and he
said at the hearing he weighed about 300 pounds in July 2022. (Tr. 32; AE B)
Applicant left the bar about midnight, and he believed it was safe for him to drive.
(Tr. 32) He said he did not feel any effects from his previous alcohol consumption at the
time he left the bar. (Tr. 33) His hotel was about 15 miles from the bar. (Tr. 33) After about
five minutes, he felt ill, and he pulled over onto the side of the road. (Tr. 34) Applicant’s
vehicle was at an off ramp where truckers park, and the vehicle may have been slightly
over  the  line.  (Tr.  40)  He  felt  like  he  had  been  drugged  or  was  suffering  from  food
poisoning. (Tr. 34, 37) He felt it was unsafe to drive, and he fell asleep at about 1:00 a.m.
(Tr. 34, 41) He did not remember if he turned off the ignition of his vehicle. (Tr. 39-40) At
about 3:00 or 4:00 a.m., the police woke him. (Tr. 34, 41) He had a breath-alcohol test
(BAT) at the site of his arrest, and the officer said it showed he was over the legal limit;
however, he said he did not remember the BAT result. (Tr. 42) He received another BAT
at the police station, and the result was over the limit. He said he did not remember the
result of the second BAT.
Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he did
not receive a blood-alcohol test, and he could not remember the alcohol content for his
breathalyzer tests. (GE 2) Two weeks after his arrest, he returned to the foreign country
where he is employed. (Tr. 48) He returns to the United States about every six months to
be with his family.
Applicant  pleaded   guilty  to   DUI.   (Tr.  44)  He  received   three   years  of  informal
probation. (AE  D)  His probation  permits  him  to  drink alcohol.  (Id.) He was sentenced  to
pay fines  and  court costs of $1,545, and  to  attend  a  six-month  alcohol program. (Id.) The
six-month   alcohol  program   is  required   when   a   driver’s  blood-alcohol  content  (BAC)   is
“between  0.15% and  0.19%.” (HE  5) Applicant  believes he  can  successfully complete  the
three-year probation period, and the DUI conviction will be removed from his record. (Tr.
25) He is not permitted  to  drive  in the  state  where he  was arrested  for  DUI for three  years.
(Tr. 46) He  does not  have  a  probation  officer.  (Tr. 46)  He  acknowledged  that driving  after
drinking alcohol was “extremely stupid.” (Tr. 49)
Applicant provided court documents after his hearing which indicated his BAC was
.16 percent. (AE C at 5) He acknowledged it was not possible for a person who weighs
300  pounds  to  drink  three  drinks,  stop  drinking  about  1:00  a.m.,  and  provide  a  breath
sample several hours later to test above the legal limit. (Tr. 54-55) He stood by his claim
of only consuming three drinks. (Tr. 56)
On  June  27,  2023,  Appellant  completed  the  six-month  First  Offender  Alcohol
Program. (SOR response) He paid the fines and costs and completed all requirements of
his sentence except for the three years of informal probation.
In  response  to  a  question  on  January  23,  2024,  about  when  he  most  recently
consumed alcohol, he said:
Honestly,  I  do   not  remember  the   exact  date,  but  I   believe   it  was   holiday
season  of 2022  going  into  2023.  And  even  then  it was  only wine/champagne
to  celebrate  the  season. Since  the  event that had  happened  to  me  it has
been  a  real  eye  opener &  rude  awakening. I  have  since  refrained  &  been
trying  to  get healthier &  lose  weight.  Both  for my career &  for my children.
Being   overweight &   having   sleep   apnea   is bad   enough. You  add   alcohol
into the  mix it only heightens the risk for medical issues.  (AE  G)
Applicant’s  manager  served   with   him   in  Europe   when   they  were   both   on   active
duty and  supervises him in his current overseas employment. He  described  Applicant  as
follows:
During  the  time  I have  known Applicant  I could  always count on  him  to  get
the   job   done   and  done   right.   [He] gives 100%  in everything  he   does  and
makes  security of the  systems he  works a  priority.  He is  always willing  to  let
our  customer  know  what  the   requirements  are  and   ensures  we  are  in
compliance   with   all   requirements.   Please   consider  [him]   for  his  security
clearance.  (AE  E)

"Applicant is a 48-year-old, single man. He has been married twice previously. Both
marriages ended in divorce, most recently in 2019. (Item 3 at 26-27) He is a veteran of
the U.S. Air Force, serving from 1995 to 1999. He was discharged honorably. (Response
to Interrogatories (Item 3 at 11).He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2016 and a master’s
degree in 2018. (Item 3 at 13) He has been working for a defense contractor as a data
analyst since 2016. (Item 3 at 14)
The SOR alleges Applicant has been struggling with recurrent financial problems
for  more  than  15  years.  In  July  2011,  he  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  protection,  as
alleged in subparagraph 1.k. (Item 1 at 41; Item 1 at 5) In October 2011, the court granted
the petition, discharging approximately $41,000 of delinquent debt. (Item 11)
In
the  seven  years  after
the  bankruptcy  discharge,  Applicant
incurred
approximately  $19,000  of  additional  delinquent  debt,  including  the  debts  alleged  in
subparagraphs 1.e, totaling $2,335; 1.f, totaling $863; 1.h, totaling $2,589; and 1.i, totaling
$13,543. (Item 8 at 1-3) Applicant enrolled in a debt-consolidation plan and began making
payments through the plan in 2018. (Item 8 at 6) Although he made consistent payments
for four years, he never finished the payment plan because he became ensnared in an
online  romance  scam  in  2022  in  which  he  was  duped  into  sending  multiple  payments
totaling  $15,000  to  an  anonymous  online  person  masquerading  as  a  potential  love
interest.  (Item 4 at 2;  Item 8 at 6)  Because  of the  scam,  two additional accounts, as
alleged in subparagraphs 1.g, and 1.j, totaling approximately $1,800, that Applicant had
opened after the debt consolidation, became delinquent. Both were charged off  by the
fall of  2022. (Item 5 at 10; Item 6 at 5)
In October 2022, Applicant consolidated all his delinquent SOR debts into another
payment plan. (Item 2 at 69, 84, 91) He has been paying $176 per month towards the
plan  since  November 2022.  By  September 2023,  he  had  satisfied  the debt  alleged  in
subparagraph 1.f. (Response at 3)
In   addition   to   the   delinquent   commercial  debts,   the   SOR  includes  delinquent
federal   and   state   income   tax  debts,   as   alleged   in   subparagraphs  1.a   through   1.d.
Specifically, SOR subparagraph 1.a alleges a $4,524 federal income tax delinquency for
tax year 2021  and  a  $511  federal income  tax delinquency for tax year 2018. (Item  4  at
28) Applicant has  been making  $51  monthly  payments  to  the  IRS through  an  installment
agreement since  June  2019.  (Item 4  at 30-35)  When  he  did not satisfy the tax year 2021
delinquency  on  time,  it  was incorporated  into  the  installment agreement.  Apart from  six
payments   that  were   dishonored   for  insufficient  funds,   Applicant   has  been   making   the
payments, as agreed. (Item  4  at  31, 46-48)  The most recent  dishonored payment was in
November 2022. (Item  4 at 31)
Subparagraph 1.c alleges that Applicant owes $1,967 in back state taxes for tax
year 2021. It remains outstanding.
SOR subparagraph 1.d alleges that Applicant had two business tax liens entered
against him in 2016 and 2020, totaling $198. This debt constituted a tax on a business
that Applicant’s ex-wife owned, which he financed. (Item 12) When Applicant discovered
these liens, he contacted the municipality and satisfied them. (Item 2 at 2)
Applicant continues to work on paying off his debts. In September 2023, he made
payment arrangements to satisfy a $650 debt that was not listed on the SOR. (Response
at 3)
SOR  Paragraph   3   alleges  two   domestic  violence   allegations.   Specifically,  on
December  17,   2018,   Applicant’s  estranged   wife,  a   foreign   national,   filed   a   request  for
domestic violence  protective  order, alleging  that  on  December 11,  2018,  around  6:00  am
in the  morning, he  assaulted  her  in the  parking  lot  of  his apartment  complex.  (Item  13  at
8)   At  the   time   of  the   alleged   episode,  Applicant  and   his  wife   had   been   separated   for
approximately  eight   months.  That  morning,  she   had   gone   to   his  apartment   without
notifying   him   in  advance   to   retrieve   her  immigration-related   documents.  (Item   13   at   8)
When  she  rang  the  doorbell, he  did not  answer it, nor did  he  invite  her in.  Shortly after
she  rang, however, he  walked  out of the  home  towards his car. Applicant’s estranged  wife
asked  him  about the  documents  that she  needed  and  followed  him  to  his car. She  alleged
that Applicant,  while walking  to  his car, suddenly became  enraged, threatened  to  kill her,
and  began  strangling  her. (Item  13  at 8).  After he  stopped, he  punched  her in the  face.
(Item  13  at 8) After the  assault,  Applicant’s estranged  wife  alleged  that he  entered  his  car
and drove  away, whereupon  she  got into  her  car and  “tried  to  follow him  so he  could not
get away.” (Item 13 at 8) After losing him in traffic, Applicant’s estranged wife alleged that
she then drove towards her immigration attorney’s office, called him from the car and told
him what happened. He advised her to return to the scene and call the police. (Item 13 at
8-9)
Applicant’s estranged wife followed the immigration attorney’s advice and returned
to  Applicant’s  apartment  complex.  At  approximately  8:45  am,  an  apartment  complex
maintenance worker noticed Applicant’s estranged wife in the parking lot crying, and he
called the police. (Item 13 at  17) The  police  arrived, and  after taking  Applicant’s wife’s
statement,  prepared  a  domestic  violence  report.  In  the  report,  Applicant’s  wife  was
characterized as “upset,” “crying,” “fearful,” and “nervous.” (Item 13 at 14) Moreover, the
officer noticed that Applicant’s wife had lacerations on her neck, a swollen right eye, and
scrapes and bruises on her palm and lower left arm. (Item 13 at 17) The police then called
an  ambulance  for  transport  to  the  local  emergency  room.  (Item  13  at  16)  Before  the
ambulance arrived, the police officer took pictures of the injuries, completed an incident
report,  including  a  “strangulation  documentation  form,”  and  issued  an  emergency
protective order. (Item 13 at 17, 22, 24)
Applicant’s  estranged  wife  was  treated  at  the  hospital and  discharged  that  day.
The  intake  staff  noted  multiple  contusions.  (Item  13  at  26)  On  December  17,  2024,
Applicant’s estranged wife filed a request for a domestic violence restraining order against
him. (Item 13 at 31) The court originally scheduled the hearing for January 2, 2019, and
granted a temporary restraining order pending the hearing. (Item 13 at 31) The case was
continued until March 2019. (Item 13 at 52)
On February 2, 2019, Applicant responded to the request for a domestic violence
restraining order, denying the allegations, and moving for a restraining order against his
estranged wife. (Item 13 at 43) He admits that his estranged wife came to his home the
morning of December 11, 2018, at approximately 6:00 am. However, he denies harming
or threatening her. Instead, he said that she repeatedly hugged him, begged him for help
to prevent her from being deported, and asked him to kiss her. Intent on getting away,
Applicant closed his apartment door and ran to his car with his estranged wife in pursuit.
(Item 13 at 47) After he entered the car, she then allegedly jumped into his lap before he
could close the door, while continuing to exclaim, “help me, baby!” and “kiss me, baby!”
(Item  13  at  47)  He  then  lifted  and  pushed  her  off  him,  removing  her  from  the  car.  He
contends  that  he  did  not  injure  her  in  the  process.  Applicant  then  exited  the  car.  Per
Applicant, his estranged wife continued to put her arms around him and beg him for help.
(Item 13 at 48) Fearing that they were waking up the neighbors, Applicant exhorted his
estranged  wife  to  calm  down,  and  suggested  that  she  follow  him  in  her  car  to  a
commercial establishment where they could talk in public.(Item 13 at 48) After Applicant
and his wife got into their respective vehicles, Applicant intentionally turned in a direction
opposite from the street that led to the location where he had asked her to meet, and then
intentionally lost her in traffic.
Later that day, Applicant returned  home, packed  his belongings,  and  moved  to  a
friend’s house. (Item  13  at  48) He did so  because  he  was terrified  that his estranged  wife
“and/or her boyfriend could do something” to him. (Item 13 at 48) (Applicant’s discovery
of his wife “in an intimate embrace” with a lover several months earlier had prompted him
to separate from her. (Item 13 at 46))
On  March  2,  2019,  the  local  court  held  a  hearing  regarding  the  competing
protective  order  motions.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  hearing,  the  court  ruled  against
Applicant’s estranged wife, concluding that she did not meet her burden of proving by a
preponderance of evidence that abuse occurred within the meaning of the state statute,
or that she was placed in a reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm  by any actions of
Applicant.  (Item  13  at  54)  The  court  reached  this  conclusion  “despite  the  injuries
admittedly present” on Applicant’s estranged wife and finding ‘the testimony of [Applicant]
to  be  sufficiently  more credible  than  the  testimony of  [the estranged  wife]  to  preclude
[her]  from  meeting  her  burden  of  proof.”  (Item  13  at  54)  The  local  court’s  decision
constitutes the evidence Applicant offered in support of his denial of the allegations set
forth in SOR Paragraph 2, and cross-alleged in SOR Paragraph 3, that he choked and
punched his wife.
In Applicant’s reply to the FORM, he stated that his estranged wife was not injured
when  he  left  her on  the  morning  of  December 11,  2018, and  that “whether or how she
received those bruises or lacerations was not from me.” (Reply at 1) Contrary to his earlier
statement when he suggested that she follow him to a nearby commercial establishment
where they could talk without disrupting the neighbors, Applicant, in his reply, stated that
he left the apartment complex to go directly to work. (Reply at 1)
During Applicant’s estranged wife’s interview with the police officer who filed the
December 2018 incident report, she told him that the episode where Applicant choked
her was not the first time he physically abused her. Specifically, one morning in  March
2018, he punched her on the shoulder “a couple of times” after she would not get out of
bed  to  move  her  car  away  from  his  car  so  that  he  could  drive  to  work,  as  alleged  in
subparagraph 2.b. (Item 13 at 9)

"Applicant  is  29  years  old.  She  is not  married  and  has  no  children.  She  has  a
Master’s  degree.  She  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  Scheduler  and  Risk
Analyst  (Junior  position).  She  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection
with her employment.
Applicant’s  recent  criminal  conduct  on  July  31,  2022,  involves  retail  theft  and
receiving  stolen  property.  She  has  not  been  open,  honest,  and  upfront  with  the
Government about this misconduct.  She has no prior military service.
Applicant graduated from college  with her Masters degree in 2022.  She began
working  for  her  current  employer  in  November  2022.  She  has  never  held  a  security
clearance before.
On September 8, 2022, Applicant was charged with Retail Theft-Alter Label/Price
Marking  and  Receiving  Stolen  Property.  She  admits  to  being  charged  and  sentenced
for committing these two criminal offenses as set forth in allegation 1.a., of the SOR, but
denies  that  she  knowingly  and  intentionally  changed  the  bar  code  stickers  on  the
merchandise to steal the items, as set forth in allegation 1.b., of the SOR.
A  police  report  of  the  incident  indicates  that  on  about  July  31,  2022,  a  suspect
was  observed  placing  different  bar  code  stickers  on  approximately  19  items  of
merchandise at a Walmart.  The stickers were of low dollar value, (94 cents which was
a  bar  code  for  a  side  plate,  97  cents  which  was  a  bar  code  for  a  balloon,  and  $1.57,
which  was  a  bar  code  for  a  vase).  These  low-priced  bar  codes  were  used  by  the
Applicant and placed on 19 other items, some which were higher priced items to include
a 65-inch television, a vacuum cleaner, and a bed in a bag, among  other things.  The
value  of  the  19  underpriced  items  combined  was  about  $872.67.  The  police  officer
investigating this case found Applicant to be the suspect and confronted her.  Applicant
did not refute the narrative the police confronted her with.  She told the police that she
immediately wanted to pay Walmart back and not be charged.  The police told her that
avoiding charges was not an  option.  Applicant gave her address to the police so that
they could send her citation to her.  (Government Exhibit 6.)
In  response  to  interrogatories  dated  June  21,  2023,  Applicant  was  less  than
candid with the Government in explaining her version of the event.  She stated that she
used a self-checkout register at a Walmart.  After scanning all of the items in her cart,
she  paid  and  left  the  store,  thinking  that  everything  had  been  accounted  for  as  usual.
She received a citation for her criminal conduct months later.  She stated that she could
not  understand  how it  happened  other than a  possible malfunction with  the  self-check
out  machine.  (Government  Exhibit  5.)  Applicant  was  not  truthful about  how  this  theft
occurred.  She  did  not  admit  her  misconduct  nor  was  she  upfront,  candid,  or  honest
about it.
In  her  personal  subject  interview  dated  January  18,  2023,  Applicant  stated  that
the incidents occurred the day before she was leaving the state, and she was in a hurry.
She  stated  that  she  knows  she  scanned  all  of  her  items,  but  she  is  not  sure  how  the
items  registered  differently  on  the  system  of  receipt.
(Government  Exhibit  8.)  Any
reasonable  person  would  know that  if  you  purchased  19  items  and  some of  the  items
were  large  items,  you  should  expect  to  pay  a  fairly  large  bill.
Instead,  Applicant
changed  the  stickers  to  be  able  to  purchase  multiple  items  of  merchandise  at  a  lower
price.  She deliberately changed the stickers.  She knew what she was doing.  If there
had been a mistake of some sort, or a misprint on something that she did not cause, a
reasonable person would have flagged down the store clerk to report the discrepancy.
Applicant has hired an attorney to have her case dismissed and expunged from
her  record.  Because  Applicant  had  no  prior  criminal  history,  she  was  given  some
leniency  on  her  sentencing.  On  November  2,  2022,  Applicant  was  accepted  into  the
Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition program, placed under 12 months of supervision,
ordered to perform one day of community service, complete an online course on Retail
Theft, pay about $872 in restitution to Walmart, and pay about $1,243 in other costs and
fees.  Applicant  is  either  currently  still  on  probation  or  has  just  recently  completed  her
probation for committing these offenses.
Applicant was not completely truthful when she answered interrogatories in June
2023,  when  she  failed  to  disclose  the  full  extent  of  her  criminal  conduct  as  discussed
above.  She  failed  to  disclose  that  she  changed  the  price  codes,  and  then  scanned
these  erroneous  price  codes  for  merchandise  in  order  to  obtain  about  $872  worth  of
items at a Walmart or about July 31, 2022.  Applicant was not truthful about her criminal
conduct.  In fact, Applicant attempted to deceive the Government by not fully disclosing
the truth about it when she answered the interrogatories.

Personal Conduct Allegations
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducted an investigation regarding
Applicant’s failure to  disclose  on numerous official government documents that  he had
been terminated from a job due to absenteeism.  The investigation found that Applicant
intentionally  provided  false  information  about  his  employment.  A  copy  of  the  notice  of
disciplinary  action  and  termination  letter  he  received  from  his  employer  for  excessive
absenteeism shows he signed it and dated the letter in July 2017. Applicant denied he
intentionally  falsified  the  government  documents.  The  SOR  alleged  the  specific
documents were a June 2018 resume, a July 2018 Optional Form 306, a September 2018
Optional  Form  306,  a  September  2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  and  a
November  2018  SCA.  I  was  provided  a  copy  of  the  November  2018  SCA  and  the
September 2018 Optional Form 306. I was not provided copies of the other documents
alleged  in  the  SOR.  My  findings  are  based  only  on  the  two  documents  provided.  The
documents show he did not disclose on these documents that he was terminated from
his employment. (Tr. 47-49; GE 1, 3, 6, 7)
Applicant’s testimony was that it was a misunderstanding, and he did not believe
he was terminated. He said he thought it was a “mutual separation.” He said he stands
by his belief he left by mutual agreement but understands now he was terminated. On his
November 2018 SCA he was asked if in the past seven years he had left a job after being
fired; quit after being told he would be fired; by mutual agreement following charges or
allegations  of  misconduct;  or  mutual  agreement  following  notice  of  unsatisfactory
performance.  He  responded  “no.”  The  September  2018  Optional  Form  306  asked  a
similar question, if in the past five years he had been fired for any reason, quit after being
told he would be fired, leave any job by mutual agreement because of specific problems
or been debarred from Federal employment. He responded “no.” I did not find Applicant’s
explanations credible. I find he intentionally failed to disclose on his November 2018 SCA
and September 2018 Optional Form 306 that he was terminated from a job. (Tr. 47-49;
GE 1, 3, 6, 7)
In  January  2020,  OPM  directed  that  Applicant  be  separated  from  government
employment  and  debarred  from  government  employment  for  three  years  for  falsifying
government documents. In March 2020, his debarment was reduced to 18 months. (SOR
¶ 2.a) (Tr. 47-49; GE 1, 3, 6, 7)
In  March  2020  and  February  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  improper
equipment,  speedometer,  or  other  traffic  violation.  He  was  convicted  of  improper
equipment, speedometer in August 2021 and June 2017, respectively. (SOR ¶¶ 2.b and
2.e) (Tr. 49GE 4)
In  July  2019,  December  2014,  April  2014,  September  2012,  October  2011,
October 2010, August 2010, April 2008, February 2008, and December 2004, Applicant
was charged and convicted of speeding. In February 2015, after his speeding conviction,
the Department of Motor Vehicles placed him on probation for obtaining two convictions
for speeding within 12 months. (SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.f, 2.g, 2.h, 2.i, 2.j, 2.k, 2.n, 2.o, 2.q) (Tr.
49-51; GE 4)
In March 2019, Applicant was charged with a traffic violation in connection with a
vehicle accident. (SOR ¶ 2.d) (GE 4, 5)
In November 2008 Applicant was charged with driving with no/expired operator’s
license and failure to wear a seat belt. Later in November 2008 he was  again charged
with no operator’s license. In March 2009 he was convicted of both offenses. (SOR ¶¶ 2.l
and 2.m) (GE 4, 5)
In November 2006, Applicant was charged with expired registration card/tag and
expired/no inspection. In about February 2007, he was convicted of both offenses. (SOR
2.p) (GE 5)
Financial
The  SOR  alleged  seven  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately  $28,719.
Applicant resolved the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($138) in August 2023, after receipt of the SOR
(AE  I).  He  has  a  payment  agreement  to  pay  $36  a  month  for  SOR  ¶  1.g  ($362).  He
provided proof he has made four payments since December 2023. (AE I, J) He has three
delinquent debts from approximately 2009 or 2010 owed to a credit union in the amounts
of $8,282, $8,246, and $10,131. (SOR ¶¶ 3.c, 3.d, 3.e). He testified that at this time, he
does not intend to pay these debts because he does not have the money.  He said he
would pay them, if he had the money. He testified that he got behind on these debts when
he  broke  up  with  his younger daughter’s mother.  He also has a medical debt for $513
(SOR ¶ 1.b) and a cell phone bill for $1,047 (SOR ¶ 1.f) that are unpaid. He testified that
he has a history of some negative debts, but he also has a history of paying his debts too.
He provided a document to show he had a large car repair expense. He took a loan from
his pension plan to pay it. (Tr. 21-25, 55, 57-63; GE 10-13; AE N)
His latest credit report from January 2024 reports that since receiving the SOR, he
has  incurred  three  more  delinquent  debts,  including  one  for  a  car  repossession  for
$14,367. Applicant was asked if he had filed his past income tax returns, and he testified
that he has not yet filed his 2022 income tax return but intended to do so with his 2023
returns. (Tr. 63-71; GE 13)
I have not considered for disqualifying purposes any derogatory information that
was not alleged in the SOR. I may consider it in the application of mitigating conditions,
in making a credibility determination, and in my whole-person analysis.
Applicant testified that he takes full responsibility for his conduct over the past 20
years, including his financial problems. He said he has changed and is trying to get his
life together. He said many of the criminal charges and violations were many years ago
and he has done good things since getting in trouble.  He provided character letters. In
them,  he  is described  as  admirable,  dependable,  honest,  kind,  generous,  responsible,
hardworking,  caring,  professional,  courteous,  disciplined,  proficient,  knowledgeable,
dedicated, proficient and honorable. (Tr. 18-19, 75-76; AE B, H)

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  with  clarifications.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. He married in 2000 and divorced in 2005. He has two
children  from  the  marriage,  ages  15  and  24,  and  a  26-year-old  child  from  a  previous
relationship. He earned an associate’s degree in 2016 and a bachelor’s degree in 2018.
He has been employed by a federal contractor since June 2021. (Tr. 15, 21GE 1)
Applicant  served   in   the   military  from   1999   to   2020   and   retired   honorably   in  the
paygrade  E-7. His career was in the  financial field,  with  responsibilities over the  years as
a  financial analysist,  budget manager and  budget officer. He testified  he  was responsible
for operating  budgets in  the  amount of $315  million. He received  numerous awards and
certificates during  his military service, including  a  Bronze  Star in support of the  mission  in
the  Middle East.  He received  disciplinary action  under the  Uniform  Code  of Military Justice
Article 15  twice  early in his  military  career.  The first Article  15  related to  illegal marijuana
use.  He admitted  he  was aware  that using  marijuana  was against  the  law.  He  said  he
used  it  “probably once  or twice”  before he  received  his Article 15. His second  Article 15
was for  illegally  viewing  pornography  on  a  government  computer.  (Tr. 17-20,  37-39,  48-
49; GE 10; AE D)
In  June  2013,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  assault  causing  bodily
injury/family member, criminal mischief between $50 and $500, and interfering with an
emergency  call.  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  he  was  in  an
argument with his girlfriend at the time, and she attempted to call the police. He stated,
“at no time did I interfere with her making that phone call.” (SOR answer) He further stated
in his answer that during the argument, she threw a lamp at him that was still plugged into
the wall, and it traveled backwards and caused property damage and minor injuries to
her. He further stated:
After this event,  I was not questioned  by  the  police, Instead, they  arrested
me  and  charged  me  with  Assault,  Criminal Mischief, and  Interfering  with  an
Emergency Call. The  charges against me  were dismissed  and  I agreed  to
perform   100   hours  of  community  service,  which  I   completed.  (Answer  to
SOR)
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  and  his  girlfriend  got  into  a  heated
argument, and he attempted to leave. He admitted he slapped her phone out of her hand
while she was attempting to call the police. He testified he did not perceive this as a violent
act. He said she threw a lamp at him that was still plugged into the wall, and she then
pushed him  as he was walking down the stairs. He testified that  he went to the police
station  to  press  charges  against  her,  and  he  was  arrested.  He  said  she  had  already
contacted the police about pressing charges, so he was arrested. He was asked what
happened to the charges. He testified that “The charges were dismissed after a domestic
violence class and then paid a fine and 100 community service hours.” He further testified
he is no longer involved with this woman and has had no subsequent domestic violence
issues. (Tr. Tr. 26-29)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in  January 2022 and in
his  September  2022  interrogatories,  he  adopted  the  summary  of  his  interview.  When
questioned by the investigator about the domestic violence events from June 2013, he
did not tell the investigator or add to his interrogatory statement that he had slapped the
phone out of his girlfriend’s hand to prevent her from calling the police. He also said he
immediately left the residence and walked two blocks to his home.  He said he went to
bed and the next morning he went to the police department to file a complaint against his
girlfriend. When he arrived, he said he was told there was a warrant for his arrest. He was
advised the police attempted to contact him at his residence the night before, but he failed
to answer the door. He said he was asleep. He told the investigator that he went to the
county court the same month that the offenses occurred, and the charges against him
were dropped.1 (GE 3, 7; Answer to the SOR)
When Appellant was cross-examined at his hearing about what happened to the
charges  from  the  June  2013  incident,  he  admitted  his  January  2022  statement  to  the
government  investigator  did  not  include  that  he  had  slapped  the  phone  out  of  his
girlfriend’s hand when she was attempting to call the police. When he was further asked
about what happened in court he testified “the case was dismissed after completion of a
class and 100 hours of community service.” (Tr. 84-85) He was then asked “Did you ever
plead guilty to any of the three charges?” He responded, “I don’t remember.” He explained
he could not remember because it was ten years ago and could not recall what his pleas
were but did recall the outcome of the case. (Tr. 84-85)
The court documents reflect that in January 2014  Applicant was represented by
an  attorney,  and  he  entered  pleas  of  guilty  to  assault  on  a  family  member,  criminal
mischief, and interfering with an emergency call. He received a deferred disposition for
18  months,  which  required  that  he  complete  120  hours  of  community  service  and
probation for 18 months, which required he report monthly and be tested for drugs and
alcohol. After he completed the terms of his sentence and probation, in accordance with
the deferred disposition agreement, his pleas of guilty were amended to not guilty and the
charges were dismissed. (Tr. 85-90; GE 4, 7, 8)
1  In Applicant’s  statement to the   government investigator, he   listed   the offenses  as  occurring   in October
2012  and he  went to the  county  courthouse also in October 2012  and  the  charges  were dropped. He was
obviously mistaken  as to the actual date  of the offenses.
In September 2021, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).
Section 22: Police Record inquired if he had ever been convicted of an offense involving
domestic  violence.  Applicant  responded  “yes.”  He  disclosed:  “I  was  charged  with
[d]omestic violence to ex-girlfriend to whom we did not live together nor share children.
The charges were later dismissed.” (GE 1) The SCA further inquired:
Please   provide   all   charges  brought  against   you   for  this  offense,  and   the
outcome  of  each  charged  offense  (such  as found  guilty,  found  not-guilty,  or
charges dropped  or “nolle  pros,” etc.) If  you  were  found  guilty of or pleaded
guilty  to   a   lesser  offense,  list  both   the   original  and   the   lesser  offense
separately.  (GE 1)
Applicant disclosed the offense was a misdemeanor and the charge was domestic
violence. He then stated, “Outcome: charges dropped.” He further disclosed on the SCA
“Case  went  before  judge  and  charges  were  dropped.”  He  did  not  disclose  all  the
information about his guilty pleas, deferred disposition, and probation for 18 months. (GE
1)
In  April  2020,  while  on  terminal  leave  from  the  military  and  awaiting  his  final
discharge  on  April  30,  2020,  Applicant  was  traveling  outside  of  his  home  state.  He
attempted to put an address into his global positioning system (GPS) while he was driving
in a high-traffic area, and he hit an 18-wheel tractor-trailer truck from behind. Applicant’s
vehicle left the road. The semi-tractor-trailer truck stopped. Applicant testified that when
he came to his senses, he began walking along the roadway and railroad tracks to his
friend’s  house.  He  did  not  remain  at  the  scene  of  the  accident.  He  was  experiencing
concussion symptoms. He did not have his cell phone with him or any identification. He
said he walked between an hour or an hour and a half and arrived at his friend’s house.
He used her telephone to contact another friend whose house he had been at before the
accident. He asked his friend to pick him up and take him to the hospital where he was
diagnosed with a concussion. Applicant testified that he has had concussions in the past
and has post-concussion syndrome and is more susceptible to them. (Tr. 29-34, 39-41;
GE 4, 5, 6; AE G)
Applicant testified that later while at the hospital, he contacted the police advising
them he had been involved in a vehicle accident. He provided the police his address and
they spoke with him later. He testified that he was told he would be charged with hit and
run, failure to stop, and possession of marijuana. He testified that the police told him that
several items had been found outside of his vehicle and that marijuana was found around
the area as well. He denied to the police that the marijuana belonged to him. During his
January 2022 background interview, he told the investigator that he was told by the police
that the marijuana was found either in or around the backpack. The police report stated
that,  a  pistol  magazine  with  9  mm  bullets  loaded  into  it  was  found  in  the  glove
compartment. The report also stated that about 30 feet away from the car in the woods,
the  police  officer  found  a  backpack  that  contained  a  loaded  Ruger  P95  pistol  with  a
matching magazine and an orange vial with a green, plant-like material inside. It was field
tested and found to be marijuana. (Tr 34-37, 54-58; GE 3, 6)
The handgun found  in Applicant’s backpack was legally licensed. In the trunk of
his vehicle, he had an AR-556 assault rifle, which was also legally licensed. He admitted
the backpack and the weapons belonged to him, but not the marijuana. Applicant testified
that, “I am not even saying that the marijuana was in my backpack.” He did not know if
the police planted the marijuana in his backpack or who it belonged to. (Tr 34-37, 54-59,
71; GE 3, 6)
Applicant was charged with  felony failure to stop/accident, following too closely,
and possession of marijuana. He testified that he did not intentionally leave the scene of
the accident. Rather when he walked away it was “unknowingly,” presumably due to his
concussion. He was represented by an attorney and pursuant to a plea agreement, he
pled guilty to misdemeanor failure to stop/accident, the felony was reduced, and the other
charges dismissed. The sentence was not part of the plea agreement. He was sentenced
to six months in jail. Five and a half months of the six-month jail sentence was suspended
“for a  period  of  five  years conditions  upon  being  of  good  behavior,  keeping  the  peace,
obey  this order,  and  paying  fines  and  costs.”  He was also placed on probation for five
years. He paid the fine. The suspended sentence and probation continue until September
2025.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  aware  he  had  a  suspended  sentence  but  was
unaware how long the suspension was for. He also testified that he did not know he was
on probation because he did not to have to report to anyone. He said he was never told
by his attorney he was on probation. (Tr. 42-44, 51, 62-69, 81-83; GE 3, 5, 8)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  September  2021  SCA  that  he  was  charged  with  a
misdemeanor in March 2021 for failure to stop.2 He admitted he was sentenced and under
the section: Conviction Details he wrote: “Judge sentenced me to 5 days in jail.” No other
information about this conviction was provided. (GE 1)
In Applicant’s SOR answer, he stated:
While   at   the   hospital,   I  was   informed   by  the   investigating   officer  that
marijuana  was found  outside  of my vehicle  at the  scene  of the  accident.  I
denied  the  marijuana  belonged  to  me, and  the  charge  was dropped  by the
prosecution.   I  pled   guilty  to   the   Failure   to   Stop   and   complied   with
sentencing. (Answer to SOR)
Applicant  was  asked at  his hearing  if he  had  been  arrested  for any  other traffic
incidents. He said he had received a speeding ticket, which is not a criminal traffic offense.
He was then asked if he had any traffic charges such as reckless driving, driving while
intoxicated, or driving on a suspended license. When questioned further, he admitted he
had been stopped by police, given a field sobriety test and breathalyzer, which he passed.
He had been drinking before he was stopped but there is no evidence he was intoxicated.
He was arrested for reckless driving. This charge was later reduced to a lesser offense
of improper driving. (Tr. 91-93; GE 9)
2 Based on the records, it is apparent Applicant reported the incorrect month of the incident.
Applicant  provided   copies  of  his  military   discharge   record,  awards,  certificates,
resume, work evaluations,  disability status,  and  concussion  diagnosis. He also  provided
character  and   reference   letters.  In   them,   he   is  described   as  an   asset,  an   exemplary
noncommissioned   officer,  professional,  stellar,  conscientious,  flexible,  open-minded,
efficient, detailed-oriented, extremely competent,  likable,  knowledgeable, loyal, honest,
compassionate, disciplined,  hardworking, trustworthy, and  a  person  of integrity.  (Tr. 22-
24; AE B-N)
I did not find Applicant credible. Any derogatory information that was not alleged
will not be considered for disqualifying purposes but may be considered in the application
of  mitigating  conditions,  in  making  a  credibility  determination,  and  in  a  whole-person
analysis.

"Applicant is a 33-year-old cyber operations lead analyst who has been employed
by  a  defense  contractor  since  September  2022.  He  seeks  to  retain  his  Top
Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) Clearance, which is requirement
of his continued employment. (Tr. 17-18, 83, 96-99) Applicant successfully held Secret
and  Top  Secret  clearances  while  he  was  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army,  discussed
below. (Tr. 97)
Applicant graduated from high school in May 2009. He was awarded a Bachelor
of  Science  Degree  in  Criminal  Justice  and  Cyber  Security  in  August  2018;  and  a
Master’s  Degree  in  Organizational  Leadership  in  August  2019.  At  the  time  of  his
hearing, Applicant was pursuing a Ph.D. in Cyber Security. (Tr. 19-20; 22-25) Applicant
has  been  married  two  times.  His  first  marriage  was  from  August  2012  to  December
2017,  and  his  second  marriage  was  from  March  2019  to  May  2022.  Both  marriages
ended  by divorce. Applicant  does not have any  children.  (Tr. 25-26,  32-38, 44-45,  55-

Applicant’s first wife  was an active duty Army soldier, who he met on  post. She
has  since  separated  from  the  Army.  Applicant’s  second  wife  was  a  Japanese  flight
attendant, who he met  online. When Applicant and his second wife  divorced, she was
working  in  a  Japanese  restaurant.  (Tr.  74-76,  78-79,  83)  Applicant  initiated  divorce
proceedings  to  end  both  of  his  marriages.  Neither  of  his  wives  wanted  a  divorce.  (Tr.

Applicant served  in the Army from November 2009 to January 2017, and in the
Army Reserve from January 2017 to January 2020.  He was honorably discharged as a
sergeant (pay grade E-5). He was subsequently awarded a Veterans Affairs (VA) 100%
disability rating as a result of injuries he sustained on active duty. (Tr. 26-29) Since his
release from active duty, he has worked exclusively for defense contractors. (Tr. 97-98)
Criminal Conduct/Personal Conduct
The  concerns  identified  under  these  Guidelines  are  listed  as  three  separate
allegations  and  are  discussed  in  order  as  listed  in  the  SOR.  Applicant  testified  on  his
own behalf, and I found his testimony to be credible.
SOR ¶  1.a  –  In May 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with abuse of a
family member and household members, and a temporary restraining order (TRO) was
entered again him. The complainant was Applicant’s first wife. The charge was initially
dismissed without prejudice and later dismissed with prejudice. (Tr. 39-43; GE 2, GE 5,
AE  A,  AE  F)  Applicant  was  not  required  to  attend  domestic  violence  counseling
following this arrest. (Tr. 79-80)
SOR  ¶   1.b   –   In  July  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  abuse  of
family and household members. The complainant was Applicant’s second wife. (Tr. 50-
51, 57-59) The charge was dismissed with prejudice for lack of evidence. (Tr. 103; AE
A)
SOR  ¶   1.c  –   In  February  2020,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  a
domestic  violence  crime  and  a  TRO  was  entered  against  him.  Again,  the  complainant
was Applicant’s second wife. (Tr. 52, 59; GE 6; AE E). The charge was dismissed with
prejudice,  as  in  the  two  previous  cases,  because  his  former  spouse  failed  to  appear.
(Tr. 60, 101; AE A)
All  three  arrests  were  subsequently  expunged,  and  the  records  of  arrest  were
annulled. The State’s Attorney General issued Applicant expungement certificates. The
certificates authorized Applicant to state in response to any question or inquiry, whether
or not under oath, that he had no record regarding these arrests. Applicant testified that
his case was dismissed because his former spouses failed to appear and added, “[y]es,
[a]nd I just didn’t do the crime.” (Tr. 43-44, 49-50, 79-83, 101-102; 103, GE 1, GE 8; AE
A, AE C, AE D)
Following  his  TRO  hearing  in  February  2020,  Applicant  volunteered  to  attend
domestic  violence  classes.  He  did  so  for  the  duration  of  the  active  restraining  order.
These classes were online and consisted of sharing experiences with other people and
teaching  different  approaches  to  communicating  with  one’s  spouse.  In  August  2020,
Applicant’s  TRO was dismissed, and he  stopped  taking  the online classes. (Tr. 49-50,
79-83, 101-102; GE 1, GE 8)
Applicant  reiterated  the  reason  the  domestic  violence  charges/TRO  petitions
were  dismissed  in  all three  cases  was  because neither of his wives  appeared in  court
because “there wasn’t any proof that [he] actually did these (offenses).”  He added that
he was never abusive to either of his wives. (Tr. 101)
In November 2021 Applicant applied for, and in December 2021 he received, an
eight-year  restraining  order  until  December  2029  against  his  second  spouse.  Since
Applicant’s  appearance  in  divorce  court  in  May  2021,  he  has  had  no  contact  with  his
second spouse and has no idea where she is. (Tr. 70-74, 76-78; AE C, AE B)
During  the  timeframe of  August  2017 to  December 2017,  Applicant  consulted  a
psychiatrist  at  the  VA  for  stress  related  to  his  2017  divorce.  Applicant  does  not  recall
being  given  a  diagnosis  but  was  provided  medication  to  help  him  sleep  that  he  no
longer takes. At the time of his hearing, Applicant was seeing a psychologist on an as-
needed basis to help him cope with depression following his divorces. (Tr. 47-49, 101;
GE 1)
Applicant asserts that he is a law-abiding citizen who respects the law. He added
that  he  is  a  ten-year  Army  veteran  who  lived  by  Army  core  values  of  loyalty,  duty,
selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. He acknowledges making poor
choices in his personal life but is not a threat to national security. He considers himself a
patriot and loves his country. (Tr. 102; AE A)

Applicant also owns and manages a consulting business.  He married in 1993 and has
three children, ages 18 to 25. He currently has a secret security clearance. His security
eligibility was previously suspended in 2006 and reinstated in 2009.
The SOR alleges under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) that (SOR ¶ 1.a) on at least
three occasion between August 2006 and September 2006, Applicant videotaped up the
skirts  of  unsuspecting  women  without  their  consent;  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  in  September  2006,

February 2018 with filming a nude person without consent. Finally, the SOR cross-alleges
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a and 1.b. He denied SOR
¶ 1.c, filming women in 2017 at a department store, but admitted to being charged. He
noted the charge was dismissed and that he is applying for an expungement of the record.
He generally admitted SOR ¶ 2.a consistent with his admissions in SOR ¶ 1. He submitted
background information about himself, a “life synopsis,” and performance evaluations with

2006 Episodes of Criminal Sexual Conduct
In September 2006, while on active duty, Applicant was arrested at an airport after
a  passenger  notified  police  that  Applicant  was  using  a  camcorder  placed  underneath
women’s dresses to record them (known as “up skirting”) while they picked up bags at a
baggage carrousel. Applicant was traveling on official Government business. Applicant
was confronted by police at the scene, and he denied that he had taken pictures or filmed
anyone or anything. Applicant also denied possessing any tapes or media memory cards
for the camcorder.
During questioning by police, Applicant moved from his seat and a videotape fell
out from his pocket underneath him. When confronted by a police supervisor, Applicant
changed his story and confessed to filming women by sliding his bag underneath their
skirt without their consent or knowledge. Applicant consented to a search of his bag, and
a  video  camera  and  several  tapes  were  found.  The  police  viewed  the  recordings  and
confirmed that Applicant positioned the camera inside of his bag with the camera lens
facing up, and recorded five women. Applicant admitted that one tape was from another
airport  where  he  conducted  the  same  activity.  His  confiscated  videos  also  showed
evidence of taping inside of a mall and possibly a military department store.
Applicant  was  charged  and  found  guilty  at  trial  of  five  misdemeanor  counts  of
unlawful  videotaping.  Applicant  sought  counseling  and  treatment  during  the  pre-
sentencing  process,  and  his  attorney  requested  sentencing  be  deferred  pending
completion  of “mental  evaluations and  treatments.” (GE 4; Incident Data Sheet Report
pg.  10.)  Applicant  was  sentenced  on  March  20,  2007,  to  confinement  for  two-years,
suspended, with the charges dismissed pending successful completion of probation for
two years and no further incidents. (GE 9.)
Applicant testified to filming six to seven women during about 40 minutes at the
airport  in  which  he  was  flying  for  Government  business.  Applicant  admitted  to  filming
women at another airport after returning from his father-in-law’s funeral. He then admitted
to “possibly” traveling to an electronics store where he filmed additional women. Applicant
denied filming women at any other location, despite the evidence on the video recordings.
Applicant hid the tapes from his spouse, and “struggled” to keep them from her. Applicant
learned about up skirting from the internet, and investigators found 1,700 searches for
“up skirting” on his personal computer. Applicant testified that he last watched up-skirting
videos while on probation in 2007, and has not recorded additional videos since 2006.
In September 2006, Applicant’s security clearance was suspended. In June 2007,
Applicant attended an administrative Board of Inquiry to show cause as to why he should
be retained in the military. After a hearing, he was retained on active duty and his security
clearance  was  reinstated  in  2009.  In  Applicant’s  eligibility  determination  letter,  he  was
“cautioned that receipt of any derogatory information in the future, especially of a similar
nature, will be cause for reconsideration of your eligibility for a security clearance and/or
special access.” (GE 8.)
In  2008,  Applicant  was  directed  to  undergo  a  medical  evaluation  at  a  military
behavioral healthcare center. He was evaluated by a staff psychiatrist. (GE 6.) Applicant
attributed his behavior of filming up women’s skirts in September 2006 as a response to
stress  related  to  difficult  work,  not  being  promoted,  and  difficulties  with  a  child  with
physical disabilities. On the day he was caught, Applicant worried about being late for a
flight so he rescheduled for a later flight. As he sat at the airport “waiting and working,” he
was  overcome  with  worry  and  had   an  impulse  to  film  under   women’s  skirts  for   an
adrenaline rush. He filmed six to seven women for 40 minutes, but felt worse afterwards.
Applicant reported to the psychiatrist three incidents where he videotaped women
without their consent. He described the “most recent incident” as occurring in September
2006. He noted that prior to the September incident, he had “videotaped the private areas
of unknowing women in public.” He described that in August 2006, he was feeling guilty,
sad, and frustrated about having to return early from the funeral of his father-in-law due
to  work  requirements,  so  he  videotaped  unsuspecting  women  at  the  airport  for  an
“immediate  rush.”  That  day,  he  also  went  to  an  electronics  store  and  proceeded  to
videotape underneath women’s skirts at the store.
Applicant relayed to the psychiatrist that when he was approached by police at the
airport in September 2006, he was evasive in answering questions, but “was certain that
he  did  not  deny  having  videotaped  these  women.”  (GE  6.)  After  the  “last”  incident,
Applicant reported seeing a psychologist once a week or on alternating weeks for one
year, from 2006 to 2007. (GE 6.) Applicant participated in couples counseling, and was
involved with his church. (GE 6.)
The psychiatrist concluded that Applicant had been “experiencing  overwhelming
stressors that contributed to his having videotaped unsuspecting women underneath their
skirts.” She credited him with “voluntarily” seeking help and “underwent treatment for one
year under the care of a psychologist [which] suggests good insight into how inappropriate
his actions had been and that to seek mental health counseling to address this behavior
in order to prevent it showed good judgment.” She noted that “three episodes occurred
within the context of multiple stressors,” and “this makes the episodes appear to be more
circumscribed  and  as  a  response  to  stressors.”  Finally,  she  recommended  “regular
monitoring by a mental health specialist to ensure that he is addressing the stress in his
life productively and is aware of controlling  his impulses, especially under stress.”  The
psychiatrist made no DSM diagnosis or prognosis.
2017 Episode of Criminal Sexual Conduct
In  June  2017,  Applicant’s  daughter  was  playing  in  a  lacrosse  tournament  in
another city. Applicant and his family drove to the tournament to watch. At about 5pm the
same day of the tournament, a customer at a nearby department store reported  that a
man used his cell phone facing up in a red shopping basket to film up the skirt of women,
without their knowledge or consent. The store security officer interviewed the witness and
personally observed the man place a basket on the floor behind several women with the
camera facing up. The man then moved away to look at merchandise and returned to the
basket after the women left the spot. At one point, the man attempted to pull a women’s
skirt open to enhance the view.
The man was recorded by store security cameras and identified as he exited the
store. A close up, color photo of the man was submitted to local police, and distributed
via  an  online  crime  solvers  network.  The  photo  shows  a  man  that  clearly  resembles
Applicant, wearing a shirt bearing the name of a small college located in another state
from which Applicant’s son attended. As a result of the photo being displayed on social
media by the police, at least 100 friends, associates, and coworkers contacted Applicant
and his spouse and identified him as the person in the picture.
Applicant “does not recall” being at the store, but agreed that the picture “looks like
me.” The police also interviewed Applicant’s coworkers who clearly identified him as the
man in the photo. Applicant testified that he owns a similar shirt as that in the photo, but
his shirt adds the word “lacrosse” near the name of the school. He testified that he was
at his daughter’s lacrosse tournament that day, and although he owns a car similar to the
one described in the police report, he “would have” driven a minivan with his family. He
“does not believe” he ever left the tournament that day or visited the department store.
Applicant’s  spouse,  who  was  apparently  with  Applicant,  did  not  testify  or  otherwise
corroborate Applicant’s account, however Applicant stated that his spouse believes the
picture  was  of  him,  and  that  he  owns  a  shirt  as  shown  in  the  picture.  Applicant  was
arrested and charged in February 2018 with misdemeanor filming a nonconsented nude
person. The case was dismissed as nolle prosequi in April 2018. Applicant denied going
to the store or committing the offense.
Applicant was interviewed by Government security investigators in 2014 and 2018.
He admitted that the 2006 up-skirting videos were taken for an “adrenaline rush” and were
not harmful to anyone. In his 2018 interview, Applicant denied the 2017 incident photo
was of him, although it looked like him. He described the incident as a “coincidence.” He
stated that he was not attempting to victimize anyone in his 2006 up-skirting behavior. He
claimed  that  it  impacted  his  marriage,  but  had  no  impact  on  his  home,  school,  work,
friendships,  physical  or  emotional  health,  reputation,  judgment,  reliability,  finances,  or
ability to hold a security clearance. He said it was “an isolated incident,” but he knowingly
participated in the conduct. In testimony, he admitted his 2006 filming was harmful to his
victims, but denied telling the investigator that it was an isolated incident. He denied that
his 2006 behavior was a pattern, and said his involvement was “risk taking behavior” that
he no longer engaged in.
Applicant testified that he attended personal talk-therapy and marriage counseling
from  2006  to  2009.  This  is  contrary  to  the  one-year  counseling  he  told  the  military
psychiatrist in 2008. He claimed he left counseling in 2009 feeling “on top of his life.” No
counseling records from 2006 to 2009 were offered into evidence.
In August 2017, after being identified in the latest up-skirting incident,  Applicant
stated that he began talk therapy counseling and mediation to “get at the root cause” of
behavior, and to better communicate with his wife and children. He also sought help with
viewing pornography, and attends Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings from two to three
times  per  week,  or  up  to  five  times  per  week  on  occasions,  to  address  all  levels  of
inappropriate conduct. He is working on the 12-step program, and talks with his priest.
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant described his current counselor as a “certified
sex addiction therapist.” He stated that he has been attending counseling since August
2017; initially for marriage counseling but it evolved into individual counseling. Applicant
claims  his  counselor  diagnosed  him  with  “general  anxiety  disorder.”  No  medical  or
counseling  record  were  offered  into  evidence  by  Applicant  to  support  any  diagnosis.
Applicant stated he was referred to Sex Addicts Anonymous with the primary purpose to
stop addictive sexual behavior through the 12-step program, and to help others recover
from sexual addiction. He has attended two weekend retreats and has a sponsor. (Ans.)
Applicant’s  counselor  testified  at  the  hearing.  The  counselor  stated  that  he  is  a
licensed  clinical  professional  counselor  (LCPC),  with  a  master’s  degree  in  pastoral
counseling awarded in in 2013, and an undergraduate degree in biology. No Curriculum
Vitae  was  provided  showing  the  counselor’s  education,  expertise,  or  qualifications.  He
has worked as a counselor since 2013, and Applicant began seeing him in August 2017.
He  sees  Applicant  for  “general  counseling,”  once  per  week.  Applicant’s  spouse  was
included in one session, despite efforts to invite her for marriage counseling. He testified
that at times Applicant attends group counseling, and “may be”  involved in group sex-
addiction counseling. The counselor refused to disclose details of Applicant’s admissions
or treatment, other than to say he is counseling him for “trauma anxiety for life issues and
incidents.”  The  counselor  believes  that  there  is  no  need  for  continued  therapy  as
Applicant  has  a  deepening  understanding  of  others,  and  more  compassion  and
understanding with his spouse. He believes Applicant is truthful, has grown in maturity
and ability to connect with others, and he has no concerns regarding Applicant’s future
behavior and ability to protect sensitive information.
Applicant’s  supervisor
testified  about  Applicant’s  work  and  exceptional
performance ratings over the past two years. The witness was not aware of the security
concerns  alleged  in  the  SOR,  or  the  2006  and  2017  up-skirting  incidents.  Applicant
testified that the 2006 incidents resulted from depression, and that his up-skirting behavior
was  not  about  sex,  rather  it  was  about  participating  in  “risky  behavior.”  He  expressed
remorse  and  shame  for  the  behavior  to  which  he  admitted.  He  continues  to  attend
counseling and is involved in church activities. However, he also continues to deny his
presence at or participation in the 2017 up-skirting incident.

"Applicant is a 49-year-old aircraft painter for a defense contractor, employed since
2015. Applicant graduated from high school in 1991. He was married in 1992 and divorced
in  2009.  He  remarried  in  2012  and  was  divorced  in  2018.  He  has  one  adult  child.  His
second spouse had a daughter that lived with them until 2018. Applicant currently has a
secret security clearance.
The SOR alleges under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) that Applicant was arrested
in  January  2016  and  charged  with  felony  indecency  with  a  child/sexual  contact.  He
pleaded guilty and is on community supervision until August 2024. The SOR alleges the
same facts under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).
Applicant’s second spouse had a 15-year-old daughter that suffered from Postural
Orthostatic  Tachycardia  Syndrome  (POTS)  caused  by  poor  blood  flow.  This  condition
apparently  caused  pain  in  her  arms  and  legs.  To  relieve  symptoms,  Applicant  often
rubbed her arms, legs, and scalp, at her request and often in front of his spouse. On one
occasion in December 2015, Applicant  intentionally grazed the side of the girl’s breast
over  her  shirt  while  riding  together  in  a  truck.  On  another  occasion  in  January  2016,
Applicant stated he was alone with the girl and began rubbing her while she was in bed
sleeping. During this occurrence, he used his hand to touch the bottom of her breast and
between  her  legs  several  times.  He  did  not  penetrate  her  or  pass  over  her  breasts  or
vagina.  Shortly  thereafter,  he  was  concerned  about  the  criminality  of  his  conduct,  and
apologized to her.
The  girl  reported  the  incidents  to  her  school  authorities,  and  the  police  were
notified. A warrant was issued for Applicant’s arrest and he turned himself into police on
January 20, 2016. Applicant was not indicted, but entered a guilty plea to an information
charging him with injury to a child  with intent to commit bodily injury (injury to child), a
third  degree  felony.  Applicant  received  a  deferred  finding  of  guilt,  and  was  placed  on
community supervision for seven years, known as deferred adjudication probation. The
conditions  of  probation  include  inter  alia,  submission  to  a  clinical  assessment  and
treatment  program  with  a  court-appointed  sex  offender  treatment  provider;  complete
clinical polygraph examinations as directed by the therapist; have no contact with children
under 17 years old; submit a DNA sample; submit to alcohol and drug testing; permit a
probation  officer  access  to  his  residence  for  examination  of  computers  and  electronic
media; and refrain from access to pornography, certain places, and personal use of the
internet. Applicant’s probation period ends in August 2024.
Applicant  began  counseling  with  the  court-appointed  provider  on  January  19,
2016. He completed 185 treatment sessions and one year of aftercare on August 2, 2020.
He will continue to attend one group session per month until 2024 when his probation
ends.  Applicant  was  initially  evaluated  as  having  an  “excellent  chance  of  successfully
completing treatment and community supervision,” and had a “low risk to re-offend.” She
noted that  from the  beginning,  he “took full responsibility  for  his  actions and has been
completely honest in all matters.” Applicant complied with state standards for sex offender
treatment,  and  successfully  passed  several  maintenance  polygraphs  throughout
treatment, the last in February 2020. The polygraphs are intended to measure the honesty
and complying with conditions of treatment and supervision. Applicant also passed a sex
history polygraph that indicated that he had no other victims or abhorrent sexual behavior.
Finally, Applicant took a penile plethysmograph to assess his sexual arousal. The results
showed that Applicant “did not have any deviant sexual arousal.”
The counselor noted that Applicant was the “most compliant client I have ever had
in my 38 years of experience.” She noted that it was very rewarding to work with such a
motivated  client  atypical  of  the  majority  of  offenders  she  has  treated.  The  counselor
reported  that  Applicant  has  no  other  victims,  was  successfully  rehabilitated,  and
represents an extremely low risk to re-offend. She noted that due to his openness and
honesty, he does not present a security risk. She stated that this was Applicant’s first and
only  offense,  and  there  is  no  evidence  of  questionable  judgment,  irresponsibility,  or
emotional instability. (AE A, B, D)
Applicant’s probation officer noted that he is in full compliance of the conditions of
probation,  successfully  completed  sex  offender  treatment,  and  has  no  concerns
pertaining  to  Applicant.  (AE  C,  E)  County  policy  requires  Applicant  to  remain  in
maintenance group sessions once per month until his discharge from probation on August
23, 2024. (AE C)
Applicant disclosed his conduct to his family and friends. After the incidents, the
victim’s mother wrote a letter to the criminal court judge in support of Applicant to retain
his employment and avoid severe criminal penalties. She noted that Applicant had been
a “wonderful father” to her children, and  that he is “truly remorseful” and  in  unbearable
pain for his conduct. She divorced him two years later and she and her daughter live apart
from him. His sister-in-law noted that Applicant made a mistake in judgment, expressed
regret and remorse to the girl,  and he has been  “completely honest and upfront about
what has transpired with the courts, his family, and his counselor.” Similar sentiments and
support were expressed by Applicant’s father, daughter, brother, brother-in-law, cousins,
and friends.
Applicant lives alone in a home located in a remote rural environment. He has no
contact  with  the  victim  or  her  family,  and  does  not  allow  unaccompanied  contact  with
children  or  personal  internet  access.  The  victim  is  now  an  adult  attending  college  and
Applicant  has  not  had  contact  with  her  since  the  incidents.  Applicant  paid  a  $20,000
settlement to her in exchange for a waiver of any claims. Applicant stated that he is well
liked at  work, but does  not get regular  written  evaluations.  Applicant  did not report his
arrest to security personnel at his company until January 5, 2017, almost one year after
his arrest, on advice of his counsel. He has not disclosed the incidents to his supervisor
or coworkers for fear of retribution and ridicule.

"Applicant  is  59  years  old,  and  married  with  three  adult  children.  He  has  a  high
school  education  with  additional  college  classes.  Applicant  is  employed  by  a  defense
contractor as an Analyzer and is seeking to obtain national security eligibility for a security
clearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. 17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline  D, Sexual Behavior)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he engaged in sexual behavior that reflects a lack of judgment, or may subject
Applicant  to  undue  influence  or  coercion.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  two
allegations in the SOR under this guideline with exceptions and explanations, stating in
his Answer,  “I admit to a sexual relationship for 6 months, [approx.] 1989 to 1990.”  He
also submitted additional evidence to support his request for a finding of national security
eligibility.
Applicant testified that he was sexually involved with his sister-in-law (Ms. One)
approximately 20 to 50 times between 1993 and 1994. At that time she was 14 and 15
years old, being born in 1978. Applicant was in his late 20s at the time of their involvement
and in the Navy. With regard to the relationship, Applicant stated, “It was wrong. It was
totally  wrong.  I  have  no  excuses.”  I  have  compared  Applicant’s  testimony  of  the
relationship with the statements of Ms. One to local and Naval authorities. Many of the
claims made by Ms. One appear to be exaggerations, particularly about the number of
times they had sexual intercourse. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4; Tr. 19-21, 40-46.)
In  May  1995  Ms.  One’s  parents  found  out  about  her  sexual  relationship  with
Applicant and reported it to the local police. The local police coordinated with the Naval
authorities  and  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  Unlawful  Sexual  Intercourse,
Oral Copulation of a Person Under 16, and Lewd Act Upon A Child. From the available
evidence, including Applicant’s testimony, it appears he pled guilty to Lewd or Lascivious
Acts With a Child 14 or 15 Years of Age, and Sexual Intercourse With a Child 14 or 15
Years of Age. He was sentenced to one year in the county jail. He ended up serving eight
months  on  work  release.  Applicant  also  served  probation  successfully.  He  has  had  to
register yearly as a sex offender since that time as required by state law. Applicant has
been consistent in fulfilling his legal responsibilities. (Government Exhibits 5, 6, and 7; Tr.
21-27, 29-31, 40.)
During the time he was incarcerated Applicant was separated from the Navy for
misconduct with a General Discharge (Under Honorable Conditions), as supported by his
DD Form 214. (Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 27-28.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant’s conduct alleged under
Paragraph 1 was also criminal activity that creates doubt about his judgment, reliability,
and trustworthiness. By its very nature, such conduct calls into question Applicant’s ability
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant denied this allegation.
Paragraph 3  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,
dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations.  In  his  Answer,
Applicant denied all three subparagraphs under this guideline.
3.a.   The   Government  alleged   in   this  subparagraph  that  Applicant’s  sexual
relationship with Miss One, as set forth above, was also cognizable under this guideline.
3.b   and  3.c.  Applicant   was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  from  the   Office  of
Personnel Management on June 20, 2017. A Report of  Investigation (ROI) was prepared
by the investigator, which Applicant certified to be accurate on September 28, 2019. The
investigator  prefaces the discussion about the above events as follows, “He [Applicant]
offered the following detailed information to the best of  his memory: in  approximately 1985
(exact date  not recalled) he was in the navy [sic] and  was stationed  in  Redding,  CA.”  The
ROI goes on to state  that Applicant  became involved with Ms.  One in  1985  (when  she
would have been eight years old). The  ROI  reports that  Applicant further stated that the
relationship  lasted  six   months  or  less.   These  statements  are  factually  incorrect.
(Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 33-39.)
Applicant  was  extensively  questioned  about  the  differences  between   the
statements   in   the  ROI   and   the  facts  as  presented  by  other  exhibits,  and   agreed   to  by
Applicant in his testimony. Applicant  adamantly stated he simply could not remember the
exact years things happened  when he was questioned  in 2017, or when he prepared his
Answer. He  particularly stated that he did not have  access to the exhibits presented by
the Government, which  contained accurate dates. Applicant testified, “I’ve  never denied
any  wrongdoing.”   When  asked  by  Department  Counsel  if  he  was  downplaying  what
happened between himself and  Ms.  One he testified, “No. I would never downplay this.
It’s  not  something  that’s  taken  lightly  at  all.  I  would  never  take  this  lightly.  So,  I  would
never downplay anything. Like I said, I would rather  get it right the first time instead of
having to reopen this over and over again. But, I will if I have to.” (Tr.  36-39.)

all say he has paid a severe price over many years and has learned from  his mistakes.

States. From 1996 to 2000, he made multiple month-long trips to Russia, UAE, Indonesia,
China,  and Taiwan to attend  trade fairs and  arrange shipments  of goods to Russia. (GX
5 at 1-2.)
Applicant  worked  for  a  telecommunications  company  in  the  United  States  from
March  2001  to  December  2007,  when  he  was  laid  off.  He  was  unemployed  from
December 2007 until he was hired by his current employer. His SCA reflects that he was
reemployed by his former employer from January to June 2018. (GX 3 at 13.) However,
during a personal subject interview (PSI) in August 2018, he told a security investigator
that the information in the SCA was incorrect and that he was unemployed during that
period. (GX 4 at 7.) He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant  has  lived  with  his  wife  since  1995,  and  he  considers  himself  married
under Islamic law, he but has never registered his marriage in the United States. He and
his wife have a 22-year-old son.
From  December  2007  to  January  2010,  Applicant  and  his  wife  supported
themselves with their savings. Since January 2010, they have lived with his wife’s family
free of charge, taking care of his elderly father-in-law, who is an alcoholic and incapable
of caring for himself. Applicant’s  mother-in-law is deployed overseas in support of U.S.
forces  as  a  linguist.  During  a  counterintelligence  screening  interview  in  July  2018,
Applicant  explained  that  he  was  unemployed  because  he  lost  his  certificate  of
naturalization in January 2010 while moving to another state, could not afford the fee to
obtain a replacement copy, and was embarrassed to ask for money so that he could pay
the fee for a replacement. He did not provide any evidence of the cost of a replacement
certificate, but it would have been relatively expensive. The current fee for a replacement
certificate  is  $555.  (www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees.)  In  April  2018,  a  friend  gave
Applicant the money to replace the certificate of naturalization, enabling him to obtain his
current job in June 2018. (GX 4 at 6; GX 5 at 3.)
Between  March  2007  and  September  2018,  Applicant  was  involved  in  several
incidents of criminal conduct, which are alleged in reverse chronological order in the SOR.
The evidence concerning these incidents is summarized below.
SOR  1.f:  In  March  2007,  Applicant  uttered  an  insufficient-funds  check,  was
charged with a felony bad-check offense, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He has
given  several  somewhat  different  explanations  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  his
uttering an insufficient-funds check. During the counterintelligence screening interview in
July 2018, he stated that he cashed a $1,200 check at a casino so that he could pay a
utility bill. (GX 5 at 10.) In a personal subject interview (PSI) in August 2018, he told a
security investigator that he gave the check to his wife for delivery to her father. (GX 4 at
12.) In his response to the FORM, he stated that he wrote the check to pay a utility bill,
not realizing that he had insufficient funds to cover the check. (FORM Response at 7.)
Applicant agreed to repay the bad check over a six-month period, but failed to do
so. (GX 5 at 10.) In September 2011, after he had moved to another state, he was stopped
for a traffic violation, the outstanding warrant was discovered, and he was arrested. At his
trial,  adjudication  was  deferred,  conditioned  on  restitution  and  good  behavior.  He
completed paying the restitution in October 2014 and the charge was dismissed. (GX 11.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: In January 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with burglary
after  stealing  diabetic  test  strips  from  a  retail  store,  intending  to  sell  them  because  he
needed money. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of shoplifting and was sentenced to
confinement for 10 days, payment of fines and restitution totaling $1,140, and ordered to
have no direct or indirect contact with the retail store. He spent five days in jail. The court
records  reflect  that  Applicant  had  made  no  payments  on  the  fines  or  the  restitution
requirement as of February 7, 2020. (GX 12.)
SOR  ¶  1.d:  In  July  2012,  Applicant  was  charged  with  felony  possession  of
methamphetamine. He gave two explanations for this incident: (1) that he was alone and
disposing  of  his  wife’s  methamphetamine  pipe  after  she  had  abstained  for  two  years
(FORM Response at 6; GX 4 at 13); and (2) that he was walking with his wife, they were
stopped by a policeman for jaywalking, and he took the pipe from his wife to shield her
from being charged (GX 5 at 9). He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of drugs
and  was  sentenced  to  imprisonment  for  three  days,  credited  with  time  served,  and
required to attend drug-education classes. (GX 10.)
SOR  ¶  1.c:  In  July  2012,  Applicant  was  charged  with  petit  larceny  for  stealing
diapers from a store. The purpose for stealing diapers is unclear, because his only child
would have been 14 years old at the time. (GX 3 at 23.) He pleaded guilty and was ordered
to attend drug counseling and to stay out of trouble for six months. (GX 9.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: In July 2013, Applicant was charged with domestic battery. His wife
and  intoxicated  father-in-law  were  arguing,  and  his  father-in-law  was  shouting  and
cursing. Applicant pushed his father-in-law while trying to keep his wife and his father-in-
law separated, and his wife called the police. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated
that that he declined to press charges against his father-in-law and that his father-in-law
did not press charges against him. During the counterintelligence screening interview, he
told the investigator that the charges were dismissed because his father-in-law was too
drunk to appear in court. (GX 5 at 10.) However, the court records reflect that a criminal
complaint was filed against Applicant, an arrest warrant was issued, he was taken into
custody,  and  a  public  defender  was  appointed.  On  request  of  the  defense,  he  was
released on his own recognizance, on the condition that he could not live in the same
house  as  his  father-in-law.  In  August  2013,  the  charges  were  dismissed  “per
negotiations.” (GX 8.)
SOR  ¶  1.a:  In  September  2018,  after  Applicant  submitted  his  SCA  and  had
undergone  his  counterintelligence  screening  and  a  PSI,  he  was  charged  with  felony
larceny, after stealing a music compact disc worth about $25 from a store. In his answer
to the SOR, he stated that he intended to give the compact disc to his wife as a birthday
gift. In his response to the FORM, he stated that he tried to return the compact disc to the
store for store credit so that he could buy personal necessities. He pleaded no contest to
misdemeanor petit larceny and was sentenced to confinement for 60 days, suspended;
fined  $500,  satisfied  by  transfer  of  cash  bail;  and  ordered  to  have  no  contact  with  the
store. (GX 7; Response to FORM, AX D.)
The SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income
tax returns and owes federal and state taxes. The evidence concerning each allegation
is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 2.a (federal tax debt) and 2.d (failure to timely file returns for 2006,
2007, and 2008). When Applicant submitted his SCA in July 2018, he disclosed that he
did not file any income tax returns after he was laid off in November 2007, and that he
believed he owed about $1,200 in state or federal income taxes. (GX 3 at 36-37.) During
his  counterintelligence  screening  interview,  he  stated  that  he  visited  an  IRS  office  in
February 2018 and was informed that his tax debts for 2006, 2007, and 2008 had been
charged  off  as  bad  debts  and  were  treated  as  income.  (GX  5  at  16.)  It  is  likely  that
Applicant misunderstood the IRS employee, because the IRS subsequently informed him
that he owed $49,637 for tax years 2006, 2007, and 2008.
On February 27, 2018, Applicant made an installment agreement with the IRS to
resolve his tax debt by paying $50 per month beginning in April 2018 (GX 4 at 18; GX 13;
AX  H.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  submitted  an  Annual  Installment  Agreement
Statement from the IRS reflecting payments between July 2018 and July 2019, reflecting
two payments of $100 and $350. (Answer at 6-8.) He also submitted copies of 14 money
orders,  two  of  which  were  illegible.  They  were  issued  between  January  2018  and
November 2019. All are for $50, except one for $82 that was issued in April 2018. The
copies do not reflect the payee, except for the one dated June 23, 2019, on which he
wrote “United States Treasury.” (Answer at 9-11.) Finally, he submitted copies of his bank
statements reflecting eight payments to the U.S. Treasury between April and December
2019, in amounts varying from $20 to $100. (Answer at 15-37.) In his response to the
FORM,  he  submitted  an  e-file  signature  authorization  (IRS  Form  8879)  dated  June  1,
2020, for a 2019 federal tax return reflecting taxes of $540 withheld and claiming a refund
of $540. (AX H.).
SOR  ¶¶  2.b  (failure  to   timely   file  state  income  tax  return  for  2006)  and   2.c
(state tax debt of $2,595).  Applicant  failed  to timely file  his state income tax  return for
2006, incurring a delinquent tax debt of $2,595. In January 2019, he submitted a request
for   an   installment  agreement  providing  for  monthly  payments  of   $250.  (GX   14.)   In   his
answer  to  the  SOR,  he  submitted  copies  of  his  bank  statements  reflecting  six   $250
payments to  the state tax  authority between March and  November 2019. (Answer at 15-
36.) In his response  to  the FORM, he submitted evidence that he made $250  payments
in   September  2020,  October  2020,  and   December  2020.  (AX  G.)  He   also  submitted
photocopies of money orders for  $250 purchased in  March,  April, June, September,  and
October 2020, but the  photocopies do not reflect  the payees  for  those money orders. (AX
H.)
In  July  2020,  Applicant  completed  a  computer-based  course  of  instruction  on
financial management developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. (AX K.)
In November 2020, he submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) dated November
20, 2020. It reflects net monthly income of $5,100, debt payments of $525 ($250 to IRS,
with a balance of $49,000; $250 to state tax authority, with a balance of $14,000; and $25
to a credit-card account with a balance of $1,000). The PFS reflects monthly expenses of
$2,025 and a net monthly remainder of $3,075. (AX J.) A November 2020 credit report
from Experian reflects only two open accounts (one credit card reflected in the PFS and
another credit card with a zero balance), no adverse entries, and a FICO score of 789.
(AX I.)
Applicant has served as a linguist in Afghanistan since February 2019. He received
a certificate of appreciation for his expertise, professionalism, and dedication from June
2019  to  June  2020.  (AX  A.)  His  linguistic  services  manager,  a  civilian,  and  military
supervisor¸  an  Army  lieutenant  colonel,  submitted  a  joint  letter  attesting  to  Applicant’s
linguistic  skills,  cultural  awareness,  calm  and  focused  demeanor,  integrity,  and
professionalism. They strongly support his application for a security clearance. His two
linguist  supervisors,  an  Army  major  and  an  Army  lieutenant  colonel,  also  strongly
recommend that Applicant receive a security clearance. (AX B.)...
A friend of Applicant, who has known him for 35 years, is now serving at the U.S.
Embassy  in  Kabul,  Afghanistan  and  holds  a  top  secret  clearance,  submitted  a  letter
strongly supporting Applicant’s application for a clearance. He has reviewed the SOR and
does not believe that the allegations are reflective of Applicant’s character, patriotism, or
willingness to protect classified information. To the contrary, he believes that Applicant is
a hardworking, honest, and reliable person who should be granted a clearance. (AX C.)
This friend is the person who gave Applicant the money to obtain a replacement for his
lost naturalization certificate. (GX 5 at 3.)

"Applicant,  age  32,  is  divorced  with  one  minor  child.  He  received  a  high  school
diploma  in  2006.  He  has  been  employed  as  an  avionics  technician  by  a  defense
contractor since May 2018. Applicant previously held a security clearance while serving
on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps from October 2007 until September 2017, when
he was discharged under other than honorable conditions. (Item 2)
In 2012, Applicant drove to a friend’s house after a 24-hour work shift to help his
friend with yard work. After completing the yard work, Applicant watched television for a
time and then left to go home. During his drive home, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit
a neighbor’s truck. He  attributed the incident to his lack of  sleep. He  was charged with
reckless driving – wanton disregard. A court found him guilty of the charge. (Item 1; Item
3 at 7).
In 2014, Applicant  consumed four mixed drinks over four and one-half hours while
at  a  restaurant  with  coworkers.  He   then  drove  back  to  base.  Because  he  smelled  of
alcohol  when  he  presented  his  identification  at  the  gate,  he  was  administered  a  field
sobriety test,  which  he failed. He  was also administered a breathalyzer, which registered
a  .14  blood  alcohol   count   (BAC).  He   attributed  the   incident  to   poor  judgment  and
intoxication.  He   received   a  Non-Judicial  Punishment   (NJP)  for  Drunken  or  Reckless
Operation of Vehicle  (Article  111)  under Article  15  of the  Uniform  Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ). The  NJP  resulted in  a reduction in  rank, forfeiture of $2,426,  45 days of restriction
and  extra duty. Applicant’s driver’s license was suspended  for  six  months, and  he was
ordered to take alcohol-education courses.  (Item 1; Item 2 at 21-22, 33-34; Item  3 at 5-6,
8)
In  2017,  Applicant  consumed  six  beers  while  at  a  few  bars  by  himself.  While
walking  outside  one  of  the  bars,  two  men  unknown  to  Applicant  approached  him  and
asked if he wanted to go to a party. Applicant agreed and entered their car, which was
parked in the parking lot outside of the bar. The men offered Applicant cocaine, which he
accepted.  He  felt  sick  after  consuming  the  cocaine  and  immediately  exited  the  car  to
vomit. He then walked back to his car, which had been parked in the same parking lot.
He decided to sleep in his car until morning, and then he drove home for the weekend.
When  he  returned  to  work  the  following  Monday,  he  was  subjected  to  a  random  drug
screening. He tested positive for cocaine. He attributed the incident to being intoxicated.
He  received  an  NJP  for  Wrongful  Use  of  a  Controlled  Substance  (Article  112a)  under
Article 15 of the UCMJ. The NJP resulted in a reduction in rank, forfeiture of $2,534, and
45  days  of  restriction  and  extra  duty.  He  was  subsequently  discharged  from  the  U.S.
Marine Corps under other than honorable conditions for this misconduct. (Item 1; Item 2
at 22, 34-36; Item 3 at 4-6; Item 4)
In  December  2018,  Applicant  consumed  four  mixed  drinks  and  two  to  three  tall
beers while at a bar by himself. He went outside of the bar to retrieve a pack of cigarettes
from his car and decided to leave to go home. While driving home, an officer stopped him
for failure to maintain his lane. After refusing to take a field sobriety test, he was arrested
and  transported  to  the  police  station.  While  at  the  station,  he  was  administered  a
breathalyzer, which registered a .17 BAC. He was then charged with Driving Under the
Influence (DUI) and spent two days in jail. He self-reported the incident to his employer
the day following his release from jail. The charge was scheduled for disposition in April
2019, which was not pronounced in the record.  (Item 1; Item 3 at 12)
There is no mention in  the record of the specific day that Applicant’s December
2018 DUI occurred. Applicant was interviewed on December 4, 2018 (Interview #1) and
December 12, 2018 (Interview #2) in connection with the background investigation of his
security  clearance  application.  He  did  not  discuss  his  December  2018  DUI  during
Interviews  #1  and  #2.  In  April  2019,  he  was  interviewed  specifically  to  discuss  the
December 2018 DUI. There is neither an indication in the record nor any allegation that
he intentionally omitted the December 2018 DUI during Interviews #1 and #2. (Item 3)
Applicant first consumed alcohol in 2008 at age 20. Because it made him sick the
first time, he did not consume it again until his 21st birthday. From ages 21 through 25,
he consumed approximately six beers once per week. From age 25 through September
2017, he consumed approximately 12 beers two times per week. From September 2017
through at least December 2018, he consumed six beers two times per week. Applicant
admitted that he consumed alcohol to intoxication twice per month between age 21 and
December 2018. He defined intoxication as slurred speech and stumbling. He estimated
that it takes approximately eight beers for him to become intoxicated. Applicant does not
feel  that  he  has  a  problem  with  alcohol.  He  has  not  had  any  alcohol  counseling  or
treatment. He has no intent to drive under the influence in the future. (Item 3 at 8, 12)
Applicant acknowledged that his 2017 cocaine use was “wrong and stupid” and
vowed never to use it or any other illegal drugs again. He asserted that he used cocaine
only once, but admitted that he used marijuana two times in 2006. He has no intent to
use any  illegal  drugs  in the  future because of the  negative effect it  had on his  military
career, his life, and prospective employment opportunities. (Item 2 at 35-36; Item 3 at 8)
